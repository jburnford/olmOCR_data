Amery\nPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nAnnual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting was held at the Society's rooms at 5 p.m. on Friday, 11th February, 1921.\n\nPRESENT: Dr. R. O. Winstedt, (Vice-President for Singapore) in the chair, and some 20 members.\n\n1. The minutes of the Annual General Meeting of February 26th 1920 were read and confirmed.\n\n2. The Annual Report and Statement of Accounts were taken as read and duly adopted, on the motion of Dr. Winstedt seconded by Mr. Robinson.\n\n3. Dr. Winstedt proposed and Mr. Burkill seconded that Rule 5 should be amended by the addition of the words:\u2014\n\n\"Societies and institutions are also eligible for ordinary membership.\"\n\nThis was carried unanimously.\n\n4. Arising out of a letter from Mr. Conlay a discussion took place regarding the election of Vice-Presidents. The meeting favoured the following amendment to Rule 8:\u2014\n\n\"Substitute for lines 3 and 4 the following:\u2014\n\n\"Vice-Presidents not exceeding six, ordinarily two each from (i) the Straits Settlements, (ii) the Federated Malay States, and (iii) the Unfederated or other Protected States, although this allocation shall in no way be binding on the electors.\"\n\nAs no notice had been given of this proposed amendment it was agreed that this meeting had no power to vote on it. It was therefore decided to bring it forward at another General Meeting.\n\n5. A letter was read from Dr. Hanitsch thanking the Society for the honour they had conferred upon him in electing him an Honorary Member.\n\nIt was agreed to add his photo to the Society's gallery of portraits of past distinguished Officers of the Society.\n6. On the motion of the Hon. Mr. Hayes Marriott, seconded by Dr. Winstedt, the following Honorary Members were elected:\n\nH. H. the Sultan of Perak, K.C.M.G.\n\nDr. Ph. Van Ronkel, Professor of Malay, Leiden.\n\nDr. Renward Brandstetter, Luzern.\n\nProf. Dr. Snouck-Hurgronje, Leiden.\n\n7. The election of Officers and Members of the Council for the current year resulted as follows:\n\nPresident - - - - The Hon. Sir J. W. Murrison.\n\nVice-President for Singapore - Dr. R. O. Winstedt.\n\nVice-President for Penang - The Hon. Mr. G. A. Hall.\n\nVice-President for the F.M.S. - Mr. C. Boden Kloss.\n\nHon. Secretary - - - Major J. C. Moulton, O.B.E.\n\nHon. Treasurer - - - Mr. C. Bazell.\n\nHon. Librarian - - - Mr. J. Johnston.\n\nMembers of Council\n\n- The Hon. Dr. Lim Boon Keng, O.B.E.\n\n- Mr. I. H. Burkill.\n\n- Mr. J. E. Nathan.\n\n- The Rev. A. J. Amery.\n\n8. Mr. Colleuette suggested the holding of monthly meetings at which papers might be read. After some discussion it was decided to recommend the suggestion for the consideration of the incoming Council.\n\n9. On the motion of Dr. Winstedt, seconded by the Hon. Mr. Nutt, a hearty vote of thanks to Mr. See Tiong Wah for kindly auditing the Society's accounts was passed.\n\n10. On the motion of the Rev. A. J. Amery, seconded by Mr. Burkill, a vote of thanks to the retiring Council was passed.\n\n11. A vote of thanks to the Chairman, proposed by Major Moulton and seconded by Mr. Bazell, terminated the proceedings.\n\nAnnual Dinner.\n\nBy kind permission of the Committee of the Singapore Club, a dinner was held by the Society at that Club on Friday, February 11th 1921 at 8 p.m.\n\nDr. Winstedt, Vice-President for Singapore, presided over a company of 30. The following Members attended the dinner:\u2014 Messrs. Adelberg, Amery, Bazell, Finlayson, Gallagher, Hall,\nHamilton, Hughes, Johnston, Lowther Kemp, Boden Kloss, Lewton-Brain, Macalister, Miller, Moulton, Nathan, Nutt, Robinson, Santry, Scharff and Collenette.\n\nThe following attended as guests of various Members:\u2014Messrs. Day, Figart, Ham, Penman, Quance, Smith, Wolskel and Dr. Holt.\n\nAfter the usual loyal toast, Dr. Winstedt proposed the health of the F.M.S. Members of the Society. He mentioned that this was probably the first dinner ever held by the Society and he hoped it would become an annual function.\n\nHe commented on the successful career of the Society and drew attention to the wide circulation of the Society's Journal and in particular to the fact that it is evidently appreciated by various learned institutions in Europe and elsewhere. He instanced the Professor of Malay at Leiden, who had written to him quite recently in appreciation of our Journal. Dr. Winstedt remarked on the general rise in cost of printing and said that the only way to combat that was to obtain more members for the Society. He regretted the absence of Sir William Murison their President, now on a holiday, and said he was confident that if the dinner became an annual and assured success, H. E. the Governor, their Patron, who took a keen interest in Malay matters, would consent to attend.\n\nMr. C. Boden Kloss replied in suitable terms on behalf of the F.M.S. Members and proposed the health of the Straits Members, coupled with the name of the Hon. Mr. Nutt.\n\nMr. Nutt, in replying to this toast, expressed a hope that the day would come when the \"Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society\" would be known as the \"Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\" Our membership list and our field of work covered a wider area than the Straits Settlements. He alluded to his own failure to form a \"Malayan Association\" but congratulated the Society on being in fact, if not actually in title, a Malayan Scientific Society. He proposed the health of the guests, to which Dr. Holt replied, congratulating the Society on its past achievements and future prospects. He only regretted that duty took him to India, which would thus prevent him from taking closer interest in the Society in future.\n\nMr. Bazell proposed the health of the Hon. Secretary, who, he said, was mainly responsible for getting up the dinner. The Hon. Secretary acknowledged the compliment and tactfully moved an adjournment to the billiard and card rooms, where a pleasant evening was brought to a close shortly before midnight.\n\nMembers agreed that the particularly apt speeches of the three principal speakers contributed in no small measure to the success of the evening.\nANNUAL REPORT\n\nof the\n\nSTRAITS BRANCH, ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nfor 1920.\n\nThe membership of the Society at the close of the year stood at 329, comprising 10 Honorary Members, 4 Corresponding Members and 315 Ordinary Members.\n\nDuring the year under review 55 new members (4 Corresponding Members and 51 Ordinary Members) were elected by the Council. This total compares very favourably with an average, over the last five years, of 22 new members per annum. The report for 1909 recorded a total of 46 new members for that year as the largest number elected in any one year in the history of the Society up to that date. In 1910 this number was easily surpassed, no less than 73 new members being added in that year. Since then the annual infusion of new blood has been less pronounced. The total of 55 for 1920, however, indicates a healthy revival in the activity of the Society.\n\nThe names of the new members elected during the year are:\n\n**Corresponding Members.**\n\nDr. N. Annandale. Dr. E. D. Merrill.\nDr. F. F. Laidlaw. Mr. J. P. Moquette.\n\n**Ordinary Members.**\n\nMr. Zainal Abidin bin Ahmad. Mr. F. H. Kortright.\nMr. P. M. Adams. Capt. H. R. S. Law.\nDr. T. Barbour. Mr. W. H. Lee-Warner.\nMr. Rai Sahib S. N. Bardhan. Mr. J. Lendrick.\nMr. C. L. Collenette. Raja Mahmud bin Raja Ali.\nMr. W. S. Cotterill. Mr. G. T. M. MacBryan.\nMr. A. H. Dickinson. Dr. J. McCabe.\nDr. H. B. Dodds. Miss Agnes McIver.\nDr. W. J. Geale. Mr. Vivian Mackie.\nMr. W. A. Gordon-Hall. Mr. W. Marsh.\nMr. G. F. Hill. Mr. J. W. R. Millar.\nMr. C. B. Holman-Hunt. Mr. H. F. Monk.\nMr. James Johnston. Mr. A. G. Morkill.\nDr. A. F. G. Kerr. Mr. G. A. de Ch. de Moubray.\nMr. E. M. King. Sir William Murison.\nMr. A. W. Neubronner. Mrs. J. W. Scharff.\nMr. C. A. Neubronner. Dr. George Waugh Scott.\nMr. F. de la Mare Norris, B.Sc. Mr. Soh Yiew Jin.\nHon'ble Mr. W. Nutt, O.B.E. Mr. F. G. Stevens.\nMr. Megat Osman. Mr. H. W. Thomson.\nMr. E. A. O'Sullivan. Mr. H. Weisberg.\nMr. C. J. Perkins. Mr. A. J. Weller.\nMr. A. D. Peskett. H. E. Mr. R. J. Wilkinson, C.M.G.\nMr. E. V. Peters. Mr. G. C. Woolley.\nMr. M. Sathasivam. Capt. J. C. Yewdall.\nDr. J. W. Scharff.\n\nDr. R. Hanitsch was elected an Honorary Member in recognition of his many services to the Society.\n\nThe Council regrets to report the death of 5 members during the year: Sir Evelyn Ellis, the eminent Singapore lawyer, who joined the Society in 1909; W. H. Mackray, F. M. S., Civil Service, a member since 1908, who in joint authorship with C. W. C. Parr, contributed a valuable paper to the Society's Journal, entitled the \"History of Rembau\" (Journ. No. 56, pp. 1-157); H. Lupton, S. S., Civil Service, Dr. J. M. Handy and R. W. Munro, who had all been members for the last ten years.\n\nIn addition to the above the Society lost 29 members by resignation during the year. Of these, 19 names were removed under Rule 6. This somewhat large number is due to the fact that this Rule has not been enforced during the last few years, so that our membership roll remained fictitiously large. Some members, who had not paid their subscriptions for as many as seven years were retained on the list, while others have left this country and cannot now be traced. It is believed that the present total of 329 members now represents accurately the active membership of the Society.\n\nH. E. Sir Laurence Guillemand, K.C.B., graciously consented to become Patron of the Society in succession to Sir Arthur Young who left the country in 1919.\n\nDuring the year Mr. C. Boden Kloss was co-opted to fill the post of Vice-President F.M.S. in place of The Hon'ble Mr. W. G. Maxwell who proceeded on leave. Messrs. Makepeace and H. C. Robinson resigned from the Council on proceeding to Europe on leave. Mr. A. S. Haynes was co-opted to fill the place of one of them.\n\nTwo Journals, Nos. 81 and 82, were issued during the year (March and September). Together they amounted to 226 pages, against 168 in 1919 and 192 in 1918. These figures do not compare favourably with those for the first 40 years of the Society when the average number of pages published each year amounted to 306.\n\nThe variety of subjects dealt with was well maintained. There were fourteen papers on Malayan folk-lore, literature and local history, four on philology, three botanical papers and two on\nzoological subjects. A short article by Dr. Gimlette on a curious Kelantan charm and another by Mr. Hamilton entitled \"The Boria\" extended the range of interesting material published.\n\nThe fact, however, remains that the burden of authorship falls on too few. The papers published during the year came from twelve authors. In 1918, ten, and in 1919 seven, members contributed papers. Our membership list shows that about 83 per cent reside in Malaya and are therefore to a large extent in touch with or in reach of all sorts of subjects which are well worth study and writing up. But only about 3 or 4 per cent of our members contribute papers during the year.\n\nThe Council is aware that some members criticize recent numbers of the Journal on account of the somewhat large proportion of technical papers which fill its pages. The publication of such papers naturally forms an important part of the Society's work and is in itself a valuable contribution to Science. Earlier Journals, however, contained a large number of non-technical papers on travel, local customs, natural history, etc., which could not fail to interest all members. They make remarkably good reading now. On the other hand some of our more technical papers are admittedly indigestible and not likely to be read by, say, one per cent of our membership, if that. The remedy lies with Members. Our field of work is wide. It embraces the Malay Peninsula and neighbouring Malayan countries. Many interesting tales of travel therein, of their history, their peoples, geographical, zoological, botanical, geological peculiarities, remain to be told.\n\nThe success of the Society depends on three factors: large membership roll, plenty of funds, and, thirdly, active assistance of members in providing material for the Journal. In the first two the position of the Society is satisfactory, in the third the Council feels that there is room for improvement. Papers already received for 1921 indicate that the supply has by no means run dry. But it is hoped that more sources of supply may yet be tapped.\n\nThe Treasurer's statement of accounts for the year 1920 shows balances carried forward to the total of $8,309.27 against $7,142.89 at the end of the year 1919. Of this amount, $2,500 has been invested in Victory Loan, $2,200 remains invested in S. S. War Loan, while the Fixed Deposit at the Mercantile Bank has been reduced from $2,500 to $2,000.\n\nThe total of $1,670 for subscriptions received during the year shows a satisfactory increase over an average total of $1,127 for the previous five years. This was in part due to the payment of $435 arrears of subscriptions for 1915-1919. Five members compounded for life membership. Receipts from sale of Journals and Maps, amounting to $765, showed a slight increase over the average of $716 for the previous five years.\nThe two Journals (236 pages) published during the year cost $1,153. A long paper by Dr. E. D. Merrill on the Flora of Borneo, which has been in the press for the last two years, should be finished early in 1921. It will amount to some 600 pages; the cost will absorb a large proportion of our balance. Owing to the still further rise in cost of paper and printing, the price of further Journals in 1921 will be about 120 per cent more than the cost of the last pre-war Journal. So long, however, as the membership list remains above 300 subscribing members, the Council hopes that it will be possible to maintain an output of 300 pages of Journal per annum, at any rate for a short time, without having to follow the lead of so many other scientific societies and recommend an increase in subscriptions.\n\nThe Society's Exchange List was revised during the year, several scientific Institutions and Societies being added to the list, while others were removed.\n\nThe Council felt that the Society's Library was not fulfilling as useful a function as it might, owing to the fact that so many members reside away from Singapore. The Council therefore considered that it would be in consonance with the original aims of the Society and would meet the wishes of present members if steps were taken to make portions of the Library more easily available to those who would appreciate this action. With this end in view the Council has offered certain botanical journals (e.g. Missouri Garden Bulletin, University of California Records, etc.) on indefinite loan to the Director of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore; certain geological journals (e.g. Canadian Geological Survey, Geological Survey of India, etc.) to the F. M. S. Geological Department; certain Museum journals (e.g. those published by the Smithsonian Institution, New York Museum, Indian Museum, Colombo Museum, etc.) to the Director, Raffles Museum, Singapore. These offers have been gratefully accepted.\n\nIt is hoped to publish an up-to-date catalogue of the Society's Library at an early date. All publications on indefinite loan will be included, so that members of the Society may borrow them, if they wish, on application made through the Society's Librarian.\n\n5th January, 1921.\n\nJ. C.

HUMPHREYS.\n\nMalayan Civil Service.\n\nWhen stationed at Alor Gajah in 1908, I heard an old Malay, named Ungkai Lisut, recite at a wedding-feast a pleasant speech of Menangkabau customary sayings. He afterwards repeated the recital for my benefit (it was printed, with a translation, in Number 72 of this Journal), and some time later gave me the tattered manuscript of a longer and 'deeper' speech\u2014the text now published. The restoration of the manuscript has been a difficult task: Ungkai Lisut's memory of the sayings proved, in fact, more accurate than his document; and the present version contains several passages that came back to his mind (after a special discipline of prayer and fasting) during a visit he paid me at Singapore in the year 1914.\n\nAn explanation of all the references in the recital would fill a small volume, but a few words will make it intelligible.\n\nNaning, now included in the Settlement of Malacca, was formerly one of the Nine States\u2014the original Negri Sembilan\u2014founded by Sumatran immigrants, who crossed the Straits of Malacca in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and brought with them the Menangkabau Custom (Adat Menangkabau) of exogamous tribes, descent of property through females, and mild criminal procedure of compromise and reparation. Naning came under Portuguese influence, and afterwards (by treaty made in 1643) paid nominal tribute to the Dutch conquerors of Malacca; but remained in effect an autonomous and semi-democratic State, with a constitution of Chief (the Dato' Naning), Heads of Tribes, and Elders of Clans.\n\nAfter the East India Company had replaced the Dutch, attempts to levy a full tribute led to the Naning War of 1831-1832: Dol Said, the Dato' Naning, made a stubborn resistance to the Indian troops, but finally succumbed; the tribal constitution was abolished (even the use of 'the terms Dattoo and Sookoo' was forbidden); and Naning became a Malacca 'District', divided into Mukims under territorial Penghulus.\n\nIn spite of political annihilation and the steady pressure of Colonial Courts and Law, the tribal Custom still survives with remarkable vitality in all matters affecting property, marriage and inheritance. The survival is due partly to the neighbourhood of Rembau, where the fuller Adat still survives; but it must also be\nattributed in part to the natural fitness of the Custom for regulating the life of a peasant community of exogamous clans. Changed economic conditions are weakening its hold (ten years of the rubber industry, for example, have already left their mark); but it is the union of ancient customary law with a lenient British rule that has given the Naning peasantry so comfortable a lot with so few regrets for the past. When the Attorney General(1) referred to them a few years ago in the Legislative Council of the Colony, he quoted the famous lines:\n\nO fortunatos nimium, sua si bona norint,\nAgricolas!\n\nThis speech (or, rather, poem) is intended for recital by the Elder of a Clan at the formal ceremony of marriage, when the bridegroom, his clansman, comes in torchlight procession to the bride's house for payment of the bride-price. The escort, armed with spear and kris, and waging a realistic sham fight with the retainers of the bride, forces its way slowly through the crowded kampong, with charges, retreats and rallies; the torch-lit space under the coconut palms is filled with the swaying crowd of fighters; drums, fifes, guns, gongs and Chinese crackers make a continuous din; and the sorak war-cry or the shrill voices of the dzikir-singers round the bridegroom rise at intervals above the general tumult. At length the steps of the house are reached, a fee is paid to open the cord across the entrance, and the bridegroom, dressed in silks and loaded with armlets and anklets, is led up into the house by his friends. The Elder of the bride's clan is seated with his clansmen at the far end of the brightly lit verandah, and to him the speaker addresses the recital, pausing and raising his hands together in salutation (sembah) at each recurrence of the words 'Homage, O Chief!'.\n\nUngkai Lisut informed me that these recitals are less regarded now than when he was young\u2014wedding guests are more impatient for the arrival of curry and rice\u2014and that he had recited the full speech only on two occasions. The first was the wedding of the daughter of Kathi Ahmad\u2014a man of great note in the Kelemak Mukim in those days; the second, a marriage at Jelatang. On this latter occasion a 'very clever' man from Brisu, famous for his knowledge of customary sayings, was known to have been engaged 'to receive the bride-price' (mengrima adat): he would undoubtedly make an oration and put the bridegroom and his people to shame if they could not produce a rival speaker.\n\nIn these circumstances, although the bridegroom was not of his own clan, Ungkai Lisut was called on for help and invited 'to pay the bride-price' (mengisi adat); he accepted the invitation and delivered this recital. At the end of it the clever man from Brisu sat as discomfited and dumb as the Queen of Sheba\n\n(1). The Hon'ble Mr. J. R. Innes (formerly a District Officer of Alor Gajah), in proposing an amendment of the Malacca Lands Ordinance, designed to secure the Naning Malays in safe enjoyment of their ancestral holdings.\nafter hearing all the wisdom of Solomon; there was no more spirit in him.\n\nUngkai Lisut's own account of his triumph was as follows:\n\n\"'What is this?' I said, 'No answer? Surely a drum should be beaten at both ends, not at one end only? Have I been displaying fine clothes to the blind, showing off a fine voice to the deaf? Am I both to spin the top and peg it as well? If you can go higher, show me the branches: if you can go deeper, show me the roots!'\n\nThe Brisu man made a sour face and kept absolutely dumb. When my people saw that he could not give an answer they raised three loud cheers, and then I paid over the bride-price and we went on with the wedding.\"\n\nThe recital falls naturally into three divisions:\n\nFirst, a prelude, addressed to the Elder of the bride's clan and the wedding guests (lines 1 to 51);\n\nSecond, a Song of Origins (T\u00ebromba), telling the myth of the two Malay Customs (the law of Talion and the law of Reparation) and the coming of Menangkabau immigrants to the Peninsula (lines 52 to 276);\n\nThird, a peroration, telling of the speaker's present purpose\u2014the marriage of his clansman (lines 277 to 330).\n\nIt is not easy to find an English parallel to this form of composition, but the 'Song of Origins' recalls at times the tone and mood of an older Oriental poem\u2014the 'historical' Psalm:\n\n\"I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;\n\nWhich we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us...........\n\nWhen there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;\n\nWhat time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another people...........\n\nThat their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn.\"\n\nIf we want to feel whether the 'Song of Origins' is good poetry or not we must picture the crowded wedding-feast, and the old man reciting the tale of the Custom (with gesture and beat of drum at each cadence of the rhythmical accented verse) to the sons of Menangkabau 'in a strange land': only then can we understand how good the work is, how fitted for its time and place, how full of true pleasure.\n\nI am indebted for suggestions to several friends, in particular to Mr. J. E. Nathan, District Officer of Kuala Pilah, whose inquiries with Negri Sembilan Chiefs have greatly helped the elucidation of some obscure passages in the Malay text.\n\nR. A.

Lines 9-10. There may be a hidden reference to the 'dark' bridegroom and the 'fair' bride: compare lines 294-302.\n\n2. Line 32. The Muhammadan hours of prayer.\n\n3. Line 35. The cycle of eight Muhammadan years (and the method of computing it) is described in The Acehnese, Vol. 1, page 197.\n\n4. Line 41. Under Menangkabau exogamous custom the bridegroom on marriage enters into the tribe of the bride, is subject to her family, lives in her house, and tills her fields. On divorce the children of the marriage remain with her, the husband removes his personal property, joint earnings or debts are divided.\n\nSee Naning Proverbs (Journal No. 67), and A Naning Wedding-speech (Journal No. 72).\n\n5. Lines 42-44. The meaning is: a stranger entering a Menangkabau country or colony must attach himself definitely to some clan that will 'support' him by going surety for his debts and provide a 'mooring' where he may be found. Only then can he be accepted in marriage by another exogamous clan. Without such ties he is called 'a stroller' or 'a drifter' (dagang wanyang, dagang hanyut).\n\n6. Lines 46-48. These lines (of which there are several versions) are very difficult. Mr. I. H. Burkill, Director of Gardens, S. S., has in reply to inquiries sent me the following note which supports the translation given:\n\n\"The Nau, or Kabong (Arenga saccharifera), certainly dies downwards. It does not flower until it is aged and then it sends out bunch after bunch of flowers from dormant buds, commencing at the top and exhausting itself with the lowest.\n\nThe Pulai (Alstonia scholaris), like most forest trees, when it dies... dies first at the top.\"\n\nMr. A. Caldecott in his Jelebu Sayings (Journal No. 78) gives:\n\nPulai nan pangkal naik,\nManusia berpangkal turun,\n\nand translates,\n\nThe pulai tree broadens as it goes up,\nFamily trees as they descend.\n\nA similar text is given in Kitab Kiliran Budi, No. 627; both readings seem defective.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n7. **Line 50.** Of the original twelve tribes only four are now known in Naning\u2014the Seri Melenggang, Tiga Batu, Mungkal, and Anak Melaka; but each has many exogamous sub-clans in many different Mukims. Their heads were known as the 'Pillars of the Hall' of the Dato' Naning (Tiang Balai); the word *telapakan* appears to mean the outer platform that surrounds the *Balai* slightly below the level of its floor.\n\nA full description of the twelve tribes in Rembau is given by Parr and Maekray in Rembau (Journal No. 56); see also Notes on the Negri Sembilan, Part 2, in Papers on Malay Subjects (F. M. S. Government Press).\n\n8. **Line 61.** Maharaja Di Raja was the mythical Sultan of Menangkabau who\u2014according to Naning tradition\u2014divided the empire of the world with his two brothers Maharaja Depang (Emperor of China) and Maharaja Alif (Emperor of Rome and Byzantium). All three (according to the same tradition) were sons of Alexander the Great; who was himself the ninety-first and last child of Father Adam, and\u2014the ninety elder offspring having been paired off in Ptolemaic fashion\u2014was provided (on the special intercession of the Prophet Muhammad) with a heaven-sent wife known as Tuan Puteri Siti Kayangan.\n\nNewbold gives a somewhat similar tradition. All the Peninsular Sultans claim descent from Alexander the Great through the Sassanidae; the mythical ancestry of the Negri Sembilan Rulers is given in Seri Menanti (Papers on Malay Subjects, F. M. S.).\n\n9. **Line 63.** This line might be translated\u2014'where swarming bees have stings of steel', and this would agree in sense with the two following lines; but the translation in the text is most probably correct. Trees where bees regularly hive are in some places considered a perquisite of the Raja, and pegs (*pating*) are hammered into the trunk to facilitate climbing. So too *durian* trees in the jungle: a line frequently found with the line in the text is\u2014\n\n*Tempat durian di-takok Raja,*  \nWhere the *durian* trees are notched by the Raja.\n\nThe three lines 63 to 65 convey the idea of forbidden Royal ground (*tanah larangan Raja*).\n\n10. **Lines 69-71.** These three lines are now a proverbial expression for the three stages of Menangkabau jurisdiction. They are clearly out of place in this context.\n\nThe word *sesap* means (like the more common word *tebas*), 'to fell small scrub, clear undergrowth'. *Berpemarasan* refers not to the levelling of earth, but to the cut ends of the severed trunk and the stump.\nThe lines are a noted crux and have received many translations, none of them very satisfactory. Mr. J. E. Nathan informs me that the three lines mean in Negri Sembilan the Lembaga, the Undang, and the Raja respectively (the Tribal Head, the Chief, and the Ruler, lines 37-39 above); but no Malay can explain how they came to get this secondary meaning.\n\nI suggest that the connection is as follows: the three lines describe three stages of clearing and preparing land for a grave, viz., cutting down the scrub (tebas), felling the trees (tebang), digging the pit (pendam); and so, metaphorically, the graded jurisdictions of the Tribal Head, Chief, and Ruler. They might be paraphrased:\n\n'Where scrub has been cut, stubble is found;\nWhere stumps remain, trees have been felled:\nOnly where a pit has been dug is a grave made'.\n\nIn other words, the jurisdictions of the Lembaga and Undang are limited, and their decisions are not final ('stubble' or 'stumps' are left): it is the Raja who is the ultimate fountain of justice (keadilan) and the final court of appeal.\n\nSee also note on lines 268-275, below.\n\nAs to the respective jurisdictions of the three Courts, see Rembau, chapter 2 (Journal No. 56), and Notes on the Negri Sembilan, Part 2.\n\n11. Line 79. For the use of ceremonial rice-paste and Malay building ceremonies see Malay Magic (Skeat).\n\n12. Lines 88-90. The magic Palace of Pagar Ruyong\u2014one of the royal marvels (kebesaran) of the Sultans of Menangkabau. The miracle was the supernatural size of the nettle, mallow, and star-apple, that could furnish pillars and drums. The drums were covered with the 'skin of lice' (kulit tuma).\n\nThe Menangkabau Regalia included (among other childish prodigies) 'the diadem of the Prophet Solomon; the mountain where grow the plaintive bamboos which entrap wild birds by the fascination of their melody; the elephant Sakti; the padi, Sitanjo Bani, on which His Majesty feeds at mid-day; the flower Seri, the odour of which extends a day's journey\u2014it is sown, grows up, produces leaves, flowers and fruit, in a single day'; and many other strange and curious things. A list of the Regalia is given in Newbold, who translates from a Malay document. See also a footnote on page 28 of Malay Magic.\n\nThe Malay text from which Newbold translates will be found in Volume 921 of the Society's Library in Singapore, a very interesting work.\nA curious corruption of line 89 may be found incorporated in a charm addressed to the Demon Sungkai (Malay Magic, page 105):\n\n*Bertabarkan batang purut-purut,*  \ntranslated 'Strewn over with the stems of *purut-purut*?'\u2014whatever that may mean!\n\n13. **Lines 91-92.** It has been suggested that the 'killing' of the architect does not seem a Malay idea\u2014and that *bunoh* here means only that he was prohibited from practising his art. That is a possible translation of *bunoh*; but (apart from the fact that most Malay romance is borrowed from the Hindu), I think the meaning here is the primary one of kill. There is a parallel in the story of Awang Sulong Merah Muda: a tooth-filer is hired for him at a fee of $28 and then killed\n\n*(Sa-hari sudah tukang di-bunoh,  \nJangan tertiru di-Mengkasar)*,  \nshrouded, buried, and feasted over for seven days. And in the story of Anggun Che' Tunggal, for the building of the hero's ship\u2014\n\n*Tiga-puloh di-bunoh tukang  \nBaharu di-ambil tukang bongkok*\n\n(Dr. Winstedt translates:  \n'Thirty craftsmen slain, they summoned Hunch-back exile from Macassar.')\n\n14. **Line 106.** *Besi penindeh* seems to mean the iron prong used to 'hold' an *amok* runner.\n\nBut it might also mean iron weights used for torture, similar to the *peine forte et dure*, a form of torture that was legal in England until the reign of George III.\n\n**Lines 104-107** are out of their context: the 'cord' belonged to the Lembaga, the 'kris' to the Undang, and the 'sword' to the Raja. See Rembau, page 104, and Notes on the Negri Sembilan, pages 40-42.\n\n15. **Lines 120-121.** The 'Chieftains Twain' are the famous lawgivers of Malay myth.\n\nNewbold says: \"The lawgivers, Kai Tumungong and Perpati Sabatang, were brothers, and pretended, by Mohammedan writers, to have been among the forty persons who went with Noah into the ark. Some say that Perpati was no other than Japhet; others, with more plausibility, affirm that Perpati is a corruption of the Hindoo Prajapati, signifying Lord of creatures; and that the two brothers were ministers of one of the Hindoo sovereigns of Menangkabau, who reigned long before the introduction of Islam.\"\nThe Javanese, however, claim the names Perpati and Tumungong as appertaining to two high officers still extant in that country, viz. Pati, a minister, and Tumungong, an inferior sort of ruler and magistrate. The latter of these titles is in common use in Malayan countries; for instance, the Tumungong of Johore.\"\n\nThe word *sila* is used as a numeral coefficient for Chiefs\u2014 an interesting use not, I think, recorded in dictionaries.\n\n16. Lines 141-144. This *pantun* seems to be a commonplace for deprecation of a Raja's wrath; it is used by the midwives in the Hikayat of Awang Sulong Merah Muda (Malay Literature Series, No. 5).\n\n17. Line 145. The 'climber' (*sigai*) is a bamboo pole by which the tapper climbs to tap the blossom of the palm (*mayang*) for the sugar-juice; two poles to one tree imply either a thief or a disputed claim: in Naning the line is a proverb for a lady with a lover as well as a husband. (See Malay Proverbs, 42, in Journal No. 67).\n\n18. Lines 180-183. For a discussion of the *Adat Temenggong* see Papers on Malay Subjects, Law, Introductory Sketch (Wilkinson). Mr. Wilkinson considers that the *Adat Temenggong* is simply the *Adat Perpateh*\u2014the true law of the Malays\u2014in a state of disintegration after exposure to the influence of Hindu despotism and Moslem Law, and administered on autocratic lines.\n\nThe *Adat Temenggong* is, in fact, the law of a sea-faring mercantile community; the *Adat Perpateh* is the democratic Custom of an inland folk away from foreign intercourse. Hence the well known proverb\n\n*Bodoh Menangkabau yang tiada menumpoh laut*\n\n(Stupid the Menangkabau folk that have no footing on the sea)\n\n\u2014a proverb very pleasantly illustrated by a Rabelaisian dialogue in Tjakap-tjakap Rampai-rampai (Batavia, 1868).\n\n19. Lines 186-202. These lines, describing Malay forest where the upper waters of a river narrow to rapids, are one of the most famous passages in Malay literature; fragments appear in many forms in many Hikayat.\n\n20. Lines 205-212. The strange fowl, observing everything and visible to all, is a symbol of the mild democratic *Adat Perpateh*, impartial, even-handed, and understood of every peasant.\n\n21. Lines 217-219. The principle of reparation and restitution under the *Adat Perpateh* extended even to crimes of homicide. See Rembau, page 27:\n\n'Death is regarded by the Custom as a diminution of tribal wealth.' Hence in the case of murder an equivalent return was exacted from the murderer's tribe: not the death\nof the murderer but the transfer of the slayer's blood-relation to the tribe of the slain. The murderer cannot make the substitution in person\u2014his tribe must make good the damage inflicted. Hence his son\u2014who (under the exogamic custom) cannot be a member of his father's tribe\u2014is exempt, and his nephew suffers vicariously.\n\nOn the Adat Perpatel principles of compensation and restitution see Rembau passim, and Papers on Malay Subjects, Law, Introductory Sketch.\n\n22. Lines 228-231. These lines are a moral for judges\u2014let inquiry be cautious and thorough. The metaphor is of a wriggling lizard (biawak bengkong), climbing slowly from the base to the top of a tree\u2014a type for the cautious seeker after truth, not ashamed to retrace his steps when the line of inquiry has proved wrong.\n\nSee Malay Proverbs, 73, Journal No. 67.\n\n23. Line 240. Bertempek is probably a phonetic form of bertepat, and has been translated accordingly.\n\n24. Lines 250-254. The influence of Johor over the Menangkabau colonies of the Negri Sembilan probably dates from their foundation; it became weak after the installation of Raja Melewar as the first Sovereign of Negri Sembilan in 1773, and (in spite of some attempts by the late Sultan Abubakar to revive it) is now extinct.\n\nThe references to Johor and Siak have been usually explained (Rembau, page 101; Sri Menanti, pages 12 and 13) in relation to the appointment of the first Yam Tuan (Raja Melewar) in 1773; but the expression 'Johor our Raja' seems inconsistent with this explanation.\n\nMr. Wilkinson refers the lines\n\nMalacca our landing-place,\nNaning our mother\n\nto the same historical event. It is much more probable that the lines were in existence before that date and refer to the founding of the Negri Sembilan colonies in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\n25. Lines 258-261. These are the hereditary titles of the Chiefs (Undang) of Sungai Ujong, Johol, Rembau, and Jelebu.\n\n26. Lines 262-264. The pavilions erected at Sri Menanti for the four Undang (of Sungai Ujong, Johol, Jelebu, and Rembau), when they come there for the installation of a Yam Tuan or for a periodical audience, are each of special design and position. See Journal No. 19, page 50; Negri Sembilan Government Gazette, August 1898; and Sri Menanti, section XII.\n\nThe Sungai Ujong pavilion is built at right angles (meliang) to the pavilion of audience (balai pengadapan).\nsignificance of this position is variously explained; probably the suggestion is that the Dato' Klana can bar innovations by the Raja.\n\nThe Johol pavilion is built with a tier. No one can explain this feature\u2014not even the present Dato' Johol, whom Mr. Nathan consulted. It is thought by some to be connected with the tradition that the first Dato' Johol was a woman, whose balai was built with a raised floor screened by a curtain. I think this is probably correct. The shrine of the famous Kramat Hidup of Sungai Barnu, Alor Gajah, was built in this fashion. When I visited her in 1908, the Kramat, a very handsome girl, was seated in her shrine within a yellow mosquito curtain, but emerged later to give me curry and tea.\n\nJelebu balai balairong\u2014a 'hall of assembly'; another reading is balai berlorong, which gives no satisfactory sense.\n\nThe pavilion is actually a balai serong, 'a hall aslant', built at an angle to the Johol and Rembau pavilions. No good explanation has yet been given.\n\nRembau tanah berkerojan. Berkerojan is probably a phonetic corruption of berkerjaan, and the reference seems to be to the installation of Raja Melewar at Penajis in Rembau, in 1773.\n\n27. Lines 268-275. This rather cryptic passage seems to contrast the long drawn out litigation of contentious persons (through the Courts of the Lembaga, Undang, and Raja) with the Menangkabau ideal of a quick and peaceful settlement by compromise.\n\nSee Malay Proverbs 51-89, in Journal No. 67, referred to above. The ideal is summed up in the following proverb:\n\nMenang berkechundang,\nAlah berketundokan,\nSa-rayu berjabat tangan.\n\nVictory\u2014a defeated foe;\nDefeat\u2014a bowed head;\nAgreement\u2014a joining of hands.\n\nThe point is: even successful litigation is unsatisfactory\u2014it leaves an embittered foe.\n\n28. Lines 290-291. In tuba fishing the juice of the pounded tuba root is poured into the river far upstream; the fish to escape the stupefying juice flee downstream and are stopped by a barricade and speared. A delightful account of a Tuba-fishing is given in Mr. W. G. Maxwell's book \"In Malay Forests\".\n\nThe connection between the two halves of this verse lies in the suggestion of the bridegroom coming from far upriver to win a bride downstream.\n29. Lines 303-306. The sense of this verse is probably a risqu\u00e9 suggestion that the bride and bridegroom have already met together, while the old man, the speaker, was delayed by his winding (imaginary) journey downstream.\n\n30. Lines 310-328. A fuller account of the adat of Naning marriage is given in my paper 'A Naning Wedding-speech', in Journal No. 72.\n\n---\n\nA Note on the Pantun and the prosody of the Teromba.\n\nThe quatrains of the prelude and peroration are rough and rather bucolic verse, poor specimens of the Pantun art. They may be well compared with the very similar quatrains used at an Aceh wedding, and quoted by Snouck Hurgronje(1) with the following words:\n\n'....the first two lines are not in any way connected in point of sense with the second pair but serve chiefly to supply rhyming words.'\n\nThis criticism is now hardly acceptable; and it seems possible without very strained interpretation to trace something more than mere assonance in the structure of most of the Pantun in the text. An attempt has been made in translation to bring out what element of sense-connection could be discovered in the couplets, but lost topical or local allusions (in lines 1 and 2, or 286 and 287, for example) make it impossible to recover the full intention of their author.\n\nMarsden in dealing with Malay versification(2) recognised only two forms\u2014the shair and the pantun, and remarked: \"Rhyme is an essential part of Malay metrical composition, blank verse being unknown to the Malays\". This judgment takes no account of such compositions as the present Teromba, or of the metrical passages that occur in romances like Awang Sulong Merah Muda or Malim Deman. The truth is, as Mr. Wilkinson has noticed, that 'much Malay prose-literature is in a transition stage'; it contains metrical and, occasionally, rhyming passages; it was composed not for reading but for recitation by a rhapsodist; and its appeal was to the ear and not to the eye.\n\nThe language of the Teromba is clearly metrical (in the sense of 'measured') throughout, and analysis shows the essential principle of the verse to be the recurrence in the lines of a regular number of stressed or accented syllables. The number varies\u2014according to the length of the lines\u2014from two to four. For example in the lines\n\n---\n\n(1) The Acehnese, Vol. 1, page 312.\n(2) A Grammar of the Malayan Language, page 126.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nA NANING RECITAL.\n\nSa-lilit Pulau P\u00e9cha\nSa-l\u00e9mbang Tanah Mel\u00e1yu\n\nthere are two accented syllables in each line; in the lines\n\nTempat s\u00e9sap berjer\u00e1mian,\nTempat tunggul berpem\u00e1rasan\n\nthere are three; and there are four in the lines\n\nTempat si\u00e1lang berl\u00e1ntak besi,\nTempat kewuntong membilang bungkur.\n\nI noticed in Ungkai Lisut's recitation of the verses that the accented syllables were strongly emphasized and that a distinct caesura was made in each line (in the lines containing three or four accented syllables it occurred after the word containing the second). The effect produced was a rhythmic recitative, slightly reminiscent of an intoned Psalm. In the lines with four beats it was observable that the second and fourth were much more emphatic than the first and third, and in the lines with three beats that the second and third were much more emphatic than the first. Further examination of the verses shows that in each case the most important words in the sentence are so placed that the accentual beat falls inevitably upon them, and they are lengthened in pronunciation, or pronounced with greater force, by a natural union of sense and rhythm.\n\nIt would, perhaps, be true to say that it is whole words (or word-roots), rather than syllables, that are accented, and that in each line\u2014whatever its length\u2014there are two key-words that both give its meaning and sustain the principal accentual beats.\n\nFor example, in the specimen lines already quoted\n\nTempat sesap berjeramian,\nTempat tunggul berpemarasan\nTempat si\u00e1lang berlantak besi,\nTempat kewuntong membilang bungkur,\n\nit is the eight underlined words\n\n........clearing...........stubble..........\n........stumps............severing..........\n........hiving-trees........iron............\n........wasps..............nodes..........\n\nthat are chiefly stressed in recitation, just as it is these words that convey\u2014in the elliptical or 'telegraphic' Malay idiom\u2014the essential meaning of the lines. The metrical system is, in fact, bound up with the two main principles of Malay composition, balance and antithesis, on which a most interesting note will be found in Dr. Winstedt's Malay Grammar.\n\nThere is little doubt, I think, that this composition (like the metrical passages in Malay romances such as Seri Rama or Malim Demau) was originally intended for singing or recitative, with a beat of the drum (rebana), as in pantun singing, to mark each accented word.\nIn lines with four beats, such as\n\n....Turun ka-laut ka-Bandar Rokan,\nTempat perahu yang silang-sali,\nTempat dayong yang lentang-lentong....\n\nthere is observable a certain superficial resemblance to the four-foot trochaic metre, most familiar in the song of Hiawatha\u2014\n\n....She was thinking of a hunter,\nYoung and tall, and very handsome,\nWho one morning in the Spring-time\nCame to bury her father's arrows....\n\nand the resemblance has led translators to adopt this rather monotonous metre for their versions of Malay metrical romances and Teromba. It is, however, clear that the Malay verse is not 'metrical' (in the sense of resolvable into 'feet' that scan), but accentual. As such it may be compared with an only slightly less primitive form of composition\u2014the old English accented and alliterative verse, such as Beowulf:\n\n....Wallowing waters, coldest of weathers,\nNight waning wan, while wind from the North,\nBattle-grim blew on us; rough were the billows....\n\nor Piers Plowman:\n\n....Deeth can dryvynge after, and al to duste passhed\nKynges and kynghtes, kayseres and popes,\nManye a lovely ladye and lemmans of knyghtes\nSwowned and swelled for sowe of hise dynyes.\n\nApart from the alliterative principle, and the far greater majesty of the English verse, there is a similarity of rhythm in the two forms. Just as the emphatic words in the Malay lines are marked by beat of the rebana, so were the accented and alliterated syllables of the English verses marked by a stroke of the harp. And it may be remarked in passing that although the Malay verse is primarily accentual there are evident traces in it of both the intermediate ornaments between vers libres and perfect rhyme, viz. assonance and alliteration. Both may be seen in the lines already quoted:\n\nTempat sialang berlantak besi,\nTempat kemuntong membilang bunqkur.\n\nThe whole system of Malay prosody\u2014including pantun structure\u2014deserves more examination than it has yet received. The Jelebu Sayings, recorded by Mr. A. Caldecott in Journal No. 78, are particularly worthy of close study in this respect; so too are the metrical passages interpolated by Raja Haji Yahya ('an incorrigible rhymester,' as Dr. Winstedt calls him) in the various Hikayat edited by Dr. Winstedt and published in the Malay Literature Series.\n\nTrengganu.\n\nJuly, 1919.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nReport on Malay Studies.\n\nBy C. O. Blagden.\n\n(Read at the joint session of Orientalist Societies at Paris, July, 1920.)\n\nI have been asked to contribute a report on the progress of Malay studies in recent years. This is a branch of research that is not often mentioned in meetings of Orientalist Societies; it plays but a very small part by the side of larger subjects as India, Islam, China, and the like. I am glad, therefore, to comply with the request. For practical reasons I must confine myself to Malay studies properly so called, excluding the numerous other languages and peoples of Indonesia. Even in regard to Malay studies proper, I can venture to deal only with the work done by British scholars; to take a wider range would occupy more time than I have at my disposal, and I must therefore omit from my survey the excellent work done by many eminent Dutch and other foreign scholars in this and the cognate lines of research. The Dutch, owing to their extensive possessions in Indonesia, naturally take the lead in this department, and their great names, among whom I cannot refrain from mentioning those of H. N. van der Tuuk and of my old friend Dr. H. Kern, will always be regarded with reverence. If I omit to deal with the work done by Dutch and other non-British scholars, it is not for want of appreciation but merely because I could not do justice to it in the time at my command.\n\nWithin the last few years British research in this branch of studies has received a new and remarkable impetus. This has been due to several causes, but chiefly to the fact that the growth of the British sphere of administration and influence in the Malay Peninsula has brought home to the local Governments the desirability of encouraging by all possible means the systematic study of the Malay language and people. It was felt that the haphazard way formerly pursued of allowing individual officers of Government to pick up at first hand, each one for himself alone and without assistance, such information as he could acquire, was inadequate to the growing needs of our time. The interests of good administration demanded that an attempt should be made to collect and co-ordinate all such information in a methodical manner. The senior officers of Government realized that the younger men were tending to lose touch with native life. In former days a junior Government officer was often stationed in a district where he was the sole European; he was thus almost inevitably forced to learn something about his Malay neighbours. Nowadays that seldom happens; he is surrounded by European neighbours, and has not the same compelling incentive for interesting himself in the native population. His official routine duties also have increased materially and leave him less time and energy for individual research.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nAccordingly it was decided to set up a Committee for Malay Studies in the Federated Malay States which should encourage and assist the collection and publication in a systematic form of all manner of information on such subjects as Malay life, customs, history, language, literature, etc. This committee was set up a few years ago and the results have been very satisfactory, both from the practical and the scientific point of view.\n\nThe movement I have referred to arose out of the actual practical needs of the situation. But movements are generally inspired by individuals, and in this case the chief merit is due to one man, Mr. R. J. Wilkinson, now Governor of Sierra Leone. A Malay scholar of distinction, author of an excellent Malay-English dictionary, he had also planned a comprehensive work on the Malays of the Peninsula, but eventually decided to issue it provisionally in the more manageable form of separate monographs. In 1906 he published his \"Malay Beliefs,\" a stimulating and interesting pamphlet on the subject of Malay religion and folklore, in which he describes and assesses the relative importance of the influence of Islam, the present official faith of the Malays, and of the surviving relics of their former faiths, such as Hinduism and Animism. This was to have been the first of his series of monographs, but it was also the last. The work of continuing the series was taken up by the Committee for Malay Studies, of which he became the leader and virtually the motive force. Interesting and valuable pamphlets were now brought out in quick succession under the Committee's auspices, on Malay History, Literature and Law, Malay Life, Customs and Industries, and on the Aboriginal Tribes of the Peninsula, and these were followed by another series of monographs dealing with the history and constitution of several of the Malay States of the Peninsula individually.\n\nMore than half of these opuscula are from the pen of Mr. Wilkinson himself, and they all mark a considerable advance both in the collection of material and in the critical treatment of it. That one should always find oneself in agreement with every word contained in such an extensive range of monographs, was not to be expected, nor were their authors all equally qualified to do full justice to their subjects. Mr. Wilkinson, in particular, sometimes disposes too hastily of the views of his predecessors and occasionally fails to give them the credit which was their due. But no one who studies his work will come away from it without having derived new information, and what is even more important, fresh stimulus from its perusal. On the whole Mr. Wilkinson was also fortunate in his collaborators, among whom one must specially mention Dr. R. O. Winstedt. That gifted scholar's contributions to this series of \"Papers on Malay Subjects,\" as they are modestly styled, are of peculiar value owing to his exceptionally intimate acquaintance with native life and his complete mastery of the language, both colloquial and literary. He has also to his credit an excellent grammar of Malay, published in 1913 by the Clarendon Press, an English-\nMalay dictionary based on Wilkinson's Malay-English dictionary but containing many additional words, and a number of minor works, some of which I shall have to refer to presently.\n\nPari passu with the issue of the \"Papers on Malay Subjects,\" the Committee for Malay Studies undertook the publication of another important series, styled the \"Malay Literature Series,\" containing a number of Malay texts mainly printed in the Roman character. The population of the Peninsula is very cosmopolitan. Nearly half of it, in these days, is non-Malay. Yet Malay is the lingua franca of the country; everybody speaks it, more or less correctly, whenever it becomes necessary to communicate with a person of another race who does not happen to know the speaker's own mother-tongue. Europeans, Chinese of different dialects, Indians of various provinces of India, Indonesians from the different islands of the Archipelago, and all other strangers, use colloquial Malay freely as a means of intercommunication. Now, for the last five centuries or so Malay literature has been written in the Arabic character, a script hallowed by religious prestige but ill adapted to the phonetic requirements of the language. There was of course no idea of suppressing the use of this script, but the Government felt that its exclusive use constituted a barrier to the exchange of knowledge which had to be surmounted. True, certain of the Government officials had always been required to master it, but the rest of the non-Muslim community declined to do so. Accordingly it was decided to issue a number of Malay texts in the Roman character, which is far better suited for the expression of Malay sounds than the very imperfect Arabic script.\n\nMoreover, without dropping the teaching of the latter, the study of the Roman script was introduced beside it into the Malay vernacular schools, where it has been found to assist considerably in the acquisition of the power of fluent reading. In this matter we followed in the Peninsula the precedent set by the Dutch in their Indonesian dominions years ago. Although at first the ancient prejudices against the use of the Roman character found some expression, no serious opposition was encountered, and the two scripts now subsist side by side without friction or difficulty of any kind. While the study of Malay in the Arabic character is actively pursued in the schools, a number of text books in Roman script are also in use. Several of these, as well as others in the Arabic script, are from the hand of Dr. Winstedt, and one in particular, a history of the Malays in Malay, deserves special mention as an excellent introduction to the subject.\n\nFrom the starting of the \"Malay Literature Series\" in 1906 up to the present time fifteen texts have been issued in it in the Roman character. These include both works that had been published before, such as the classical Sejarah Melayu and Hang Tuah and the modern writings of Abdullah bin Abdulkadir, and also various hitherto unpublished texts, both traditional and modern, as well as collections of riddles, quatrains, etc. In the editing of\nmany of these texts Dr. Winstedt has again played a great part. His Introduction to the collection of quatrains in the pantun form is a very valuable critical account of the subject founded in part on the work of his predecessors but adding much that is both new and illuminating.\n\nI have attempted to do justice to the new-born activities of the Committee for Malay Studies. But meanwhile the old established Straits Branch of our Royal Asiatic Society steadily continued its labours in the same field. That branch was founded in 1877, and its Journal with its 81 numbers now fills quite a respectably sized shelf. In the last ten years it has issued about 25 numbers of very varied contents. A great part of its activities has always been devoted to Natural History, a subject on which I will not enlarge, as it does not concern the studies with which we have to deal here. But it has also issued a number of valuable papers on matters that interest us more directly, and has published a good many Malay texts. I must particularly mention the S\u00ebri Rama, printed (in the Arabic character) in 1916, from the early 17th century MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. No existing Malay MS. is much older than this one, and the work, which is a Malay prose recension of the R\u00e3m\u00e3yana, is interesting from several points of view. It illustrates the changes of style, language, and orthography that have taken place in Malay in the last three centuries, and it is a good example of the way in which the ancient Indian epic has been remodelled to suit Malay ideas. The recension was, of course, made after the Malays had already been converted to Islam, but in spite of consequent anachronisms it still retains much of the flavour of its old Indian original. An analytical comparison of the two made by its editor, Dr. W. G. Shellebear, in No. 70 of the Journal will be found of interest to Indianists who care to follow up the fortunes of the old Sanskrit epic in foreign lands.\n\nTwo other texts of more local interest published in the Journal are the histories of K\u00ebdah and Pasai, both of which had already been issued in the Arabic character but had long been out of print. Amongst a large number of miscellaneous articles that have appeared in the Journal there are several which owe their origin to the extension of British influence over the North-Eastern States of Trengganu and Kelantan, where a very curious dialect of Malay is spoken that differs considerably from the Malay of the Southern States. I may perhaps be permitted to mention that a paper containing specimens of this dialect recorded phonographically and expressed in the symbols of the international phonetic alphabet will appear before long in the Bulletin of our London School of Oriental Studies. In the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society Dr. Winstedt has found another outlet for his superabundant intellectual activity, and the last few numbers contain many articles from his pen, all of them contributing something to our knowledge of Malay life, customs, history, or language.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nWhat I have mentioned goes to show that there is no lack of good work in this particular field: there is plenty of enthusiasm locally, but unfortunately it inspires only a rather limited number of workers. That is a criticism that may legitimately be made, but one may hope that other recruits will be enlisted. A gratifying aspect of the matter is the growing tendency on the part of the workers to co-ordinate their work amongst themselves and also to link it up with that of Orientalists in other fields. It is quite impossible to do justice to Malay studies if one neglects either the element of Indian civilization that influenced the Malay race for at least a thousand years up to the close of the 14th century, or the more recent and now all-pervading factor of Islam, which supervened upon the decline of Indian influence and replaced it as the dominant ideal. I am glad to see that local students have begun to realize to the full the great importance to their studies of understanding these two factors.\n\nConversely, I would turn to the Indianists and the Islamic scholars here, and suggest that for them too Malay studies have interest and value. They will see therein, if they care to look, some curious specimens of the application and development of their own systems, working on an alien population, blending and intermingling with local customs and ideas in a very peculiar way. I venture to think that it is part of the functions of Societies like ours to co-ordinate studies, to take broad and comprehensive views of them, and to think (as it were) in continents. It will give a much needed stimulus to local students in a distant corner of the Asiatic field, if they know that the headquarters staff is interested in their work and has its eye upon them. On these grounds I feel I need make no apology for having taken up some of your time with this necessarily brief and inadequate notice of what has recently been achieved by British scholars in the part of the world with which, as Reader in Malay in the University of London, I am most directly concerned.\nContraband.\n\nBy W.

The Chinese wear padded clothes in winter time and the diagram A shows an ordinary coat, into which are sewn thin slabs of opium. This is rather dangerous as the Revenue officers in the course of their searching duties often pass their hands over a person. The more ingenious way however is to take out the lining, soak it in liquid opium or chandu, dry it in the wind and repad the coat. The lining is afterwards taken out, immersed in boiling water and the drug is extracted. The same method is employed with towels and clothes used to stuff mattresses and pillows.\n\nIt is a common sight to see a Chinese carrying about his mat and pillow, and no uncommon thing to find bladders of chandu concealed in the stuffing.\n\nB. Shows the ordinary Chinese shoe, the soft cloth sides lined with packets of morphia and the sole has a slab of opium inside.\n\nC. The soles of European shoes have often been used to conceal slabs of opium.\n\nD. The heel of the wooden clog or trompak hollowed out to contain morphia; there is nothing uncommon or suspicious in seeing Chinese carrying their clogs when not in use.\n\n5. On examining some barrels of dried walnuts A and dates B it was found that the shells of the walnuts and husks of the dates had been all carefully prized open, the dried fruit extracted and a small quantity of opium wrapped up in paper in their place.\n\nThe preparation must have taken a considerable time and shows how profitable the smuggling of opium is, as well as an example of celestial patience.\n\n6. A is meant to represent three ordinary ducks one of which was found to be dead and very heavy, its inside had been extracted and live bladders of chandu \"b\" placed there instead.\n\nThe live ducks were to do the quacking and thus allay suspicion.\n\nB. shows a fish treated in the same fashion with bladders of chandu at \"b.\"\n\n7. The diagram represents a book which one expects to see in the hands or with the luggage of most travellers; a certain portion of the reading matter is treated as shewn.\n\nA similar device is used to conceal an outfit for injecting morphia or cocaine.\n8. A represents a Chinese saw; the centre piece (shaded) is hollowed out and filled with opium.\n\nB is a chisel; the wooden handle filled with opium.\n\n9. A shows one of the most laborious and ingenious methods of smuggling I have yet seen. Deep holes were drilled in between the dovetailing of a cabinet and tubes containing chandu were inserted. B shews a section of the dovetailing and X the position of the tubes as they lay on the top and sides of the cabinet.\n\n10. Another well constructed piece of work entailing much time and patience was disclosed in some barrels of fruit. The staves were all carefully hollowed out to take a tin made to size, the bottom of the barrel was treated in a similar manner, and the whole carefully fitted together. The ends of the staves were planed down so that on looking down into the barrel the thickness at the centre would not be so noticeable.\n\n11. Saucers would hardly be expected to be of use to the smuggler, but when one has the Chinese saucer or cup stand to deal with it becomes quite another matter; the method of packing is simple.\n\nTake half a dozen or so of European saucers and place them at the top and bottom of a stack of Chinese saucers (which have a hole in the centre into which the cup fits); the space made by the saucers is filled up with bladders of chandu and the whole carefully done up with straw packing.\n\nA shows the stack, B a European saucer and C a Chinese saucer.\n\n12. All bamboo furniture is highly suspicious; it is usually cheap to buy and one wonders why some people bother to move old tables and chairs; however the bamboo legs tell their tale.\n\n13. Chinese go in for poultry a great deal and make a great success of it. One man had a sitting hen, which he must have prized, and it was not surprising as her eggs were found to be worth their weight in gold, for these eggs were pots of chandu worth $12 each. He depended on the reluctance of the sitting hen leaving her eggs, or of letting any one touch them.\n\nB represents a pail of rice. Fowls are usually kept in pens on a ship for the use of the larder and they naturally require food, but an inquisitive Revenue Officer interfered with their meal just before the ship was leaving port and found a valuable lot of chandu concealed at the bottom of the pail under the cooked rice.\n\n14. The Chinese employed in packing the chandu for sale to the public resort to every means to steal it. The Chinese say of any one who has anything to do with opium that, some of it is bound to stick to the fingers. (Therein lies a double meaning).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nWhat easier than to put a plaster on the leg, and chance being asked to show the sore place?\n\n15. A shows a strainer with a double side.\n\nB the handle of an old kerosine oil tin converted into a tin for water carrying. Chinese travelling about often use such tins for packing up their odds and ends. This handle was detachable, so that it could be used on several occasions.\nA Vocabulary of Brunei Malay.\n\nBY\n\nH. B. MARSHALL.\n\n(With notes by J. C. Moulton).\n\nThis list of Brunei Malay words represents the work of several years. It was undertaken at the suggestion of Mr. W. H. Lee-Warner, then Assistant Resident, and compiled by the author when he was travelling throughout the State of Brunei prospecting.\n\nMr. I. H. Burkill, Director of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, has kindly named the fruits and plants, while Dr. R. Hanitsch and Major J. C. Moulton, respectively the late and present Directors of the Raffles Museum, Singapore, are responsible for the identifications of the shells.\n\nH. B. MARSHALL.\n\n[Mr. H. B. Marshall has kindly permitted me to annotate his interesting vocabulary. He tells me it was intended to be a list of words peculiar to Brunei. But in addition to the parallels mentioned by Mr. Marshall, I have found a great number of words identical with those used by Sarawak Malays. In some the origin is obviously Dayak, while others have parallel words in the Malay Peninsula, very close if not identically the same both in form and meaning. The residue of true Brunei words, i.e., those without any obvious connection with neighbouring dialects is comparatively small.\n\nThe letter 'S' after a word indicates that it is also used in that form and sense in Sarawak; the letter 'W' that it is given in Wilkinson's Malay Dictionary. I have relegated to foot-notes any suggestions as to parallels in Sarawak and Malay Peninsula Malay, and as to possible derivation from other languages. Out of the 505 words given by Mr. Marshall, about 35 per cent are now without the letter 'S' or 'W' or a foot-note. These are, so far as I know, true Brunei words for which parallels and possible derivations are still to be sought. No doubt this number can be still further reduced without much difficulty. On the other hand there are undoubtedly many more peculiar Brunei words to be recorded.\n\nMr. H. S. Haynes published in this Journal (No. 34, 1900, pp. 39-48) a list of 295 Brunei words, of which 93 are given by Mr. Marshall. Mr. Lee-Warner has recently supplied a list of 33 words, of which 24, new to this vocabulary and not given by Mr. Haynes, have now been incorporated. The letter a immediately\nafter the number denotes them. Mr. C. N. Maxwell has kindly allowed me to make use of a list of Brunei Malay words compiled by him at Limbang in 1893. Out of 138 words in this list I have added 23 to Mr. Marshall's vocabulary, which are not given by Mr. Haynes; they are denoted by the letter b immediately after the number.\n\nIn annotating this list I must acknowledge valuable advice and assistance received from Mr. H. B. Crocker of the Sarawak Civil Service].\n\nJ. C. MOULTON.\n\nSingapore, 1st February, 1921.\n\n1. Aga. S. Bring, conduct, go. Aga tah = \"Off with you then.\"\n2. Agan. S. W.

The Malay transitive suffix -kan. Apparently one of the many Brunei words which have a long a prefixed to them, e.g. amun instead of the ordinary mun, which is used commonly in Sarawak for \"if.\"\n5. \"To admit\" rather than \"to agree\" in Sarawak, where mengaku is also used for the same, perhaps more commonly. The Dayak has the same word for \"admit\" in the sense of \"confess,\" viz. aku or ngaku.\n7. In a translation by Sir Stamford Raffles of the more important passages of the Malacca Maritime Codes (Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Str. Br., No. 3, pp. 62-84, 1879), there is the following passage under the heading \"The Division of a Prahu\":\u2014\n\n\"The Alang' muka (the place before the Nakhoda's Cabin) is appropriated for the Tukang tenguh, Tukang-kanan, and Tukang-kiri. If any of the Crew go there they shall be punished with three stripes.\"\n\nThe general meaning of alang in Malay is \"across\" or \"at right angles to anything,\" hence the specialized use for it in the above passage and in Brunei Malay as the \"space across the fore-part of the ship.\"\n\nJour.

(Oxon.).\nDirector of the Raffles Museum and Library, Singapore.\n\nSome seven years ago I made a note of the Malay words used for the points of the compass by Brunei Malays. In Sarawak the ordinary dictionary words are used, but in Brunei they have a slightly different system. A curious feature of it is that in nearly every instance the points of the compass are moved round one place, either \"upwards\" or \"downwards:\" thus utara, \"North\" in ordinary Malay, is \"North East\" in Brunei Malay, while selatan, \"South,\" becomes \"South East\" in Brunei Malay. The following table shows the two systems:\n\n| Dictionary and Sarawak Malay | Brunei Malay |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|\n| North                       | Utara        | Iraga        |\n| North East                  | Timor laut   | Utara        |\n| East                        | Timor        | Timor        |\n| South East                  | Tenggara     | Selatan      |\n| South                       | Selatan      | Barat daya   |\n| South West                  | Barat daya   | Barat tapat  |\n| West                        | Barat        | Barat laut   |\n| North West                  | Barat laut   | Angin laut   |\n\nIt will be seen that the two systems agree on one word only, viz. timor for \"East.\" The four words for South, South West, West and North West are all moved round one place in one direction, while utara for North is moved one place in the opposite direction. I can offer no suggestion as to the reason for this rather curious difference in the two systems, and I only call attention to it in the hope that someone else may be able to throw some light on it.\n\nFor \"North\" the Bruneis introduce a new word Iraya (sometimes Uraga), for which I have been unable to find any parallel or possible derivation in other Malayan dialects.\n\nThe Brunei use of barat tapat for South-West is interesting in view of the fact that tapat means literally \"due,\" \"exact;\" thus barat is \"West,\" and barat tapat \"due West\" in ordinary Malay.\n\nOn the coast of Northern Sarawak both systems are known. In that part of Borneo there must be many instances of Sarawak and Brunei Malays working together in the same ships and one would imagine that some confusion must arise over the similarity of the two systems, which however differ from one another in such important details.\n\nMessrs. C. D. Adams and F. H. Kortright, of the Sarawak Civil Service have been kind enough to verify the accuracy of my notes from Brunei Malays in their districts (Baram and Miri). I have also received independent confirmation from Mr. W. H. Lee-Warner who made a note of the Brunei system when he was Assistant Resident in that District.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A.

Length, \u2640 3.5 mm., width 3 mm.\n\nLawas, Northern Sarawak,\n\nAllied to *T. luminatus* Mont., but it is a much smaller and more shining species with shorter anteocular part of head and more transverse eyes, the yellow pronotal apical border and discal fascia are not united by a short vitta, the yellow discal spots of the scutellum are not rounded, but obliquely transverse, and its yellow apical border is broader and anteriorly notched.\n\nOf *T. luminatus* I have a female Malaccan specimen, determined by Montandon himself and agreeing with his good and detailed description. Distant (Rhynch. Brit. Ind. I, p. 15) describes under this name a Burmese species which has very little resemblance to the true *luminatus*, having the yellow markings of the pronotum quite dissimilar and partly punctured with black, the basal scutellar spots also punctured with black, and no spots at all on the disk of the scutellum.

Penrissen, Sarawak.\n\nWith the many Bornean specimens of both sexes before me\u2014all taken at the same time and locality\u2014I do not hesitate to unite C. armillata Bredd. with variipes Westw. (annulipes Dall.). It is\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nmore variable than any other *Colpura* known to me. The pronotal apical angles are usually shortly produced in a right-angled prominence, but sometimes more acutely, dentately projecting, the tooth being directed forwards, rarely slightly outwards. The lateral ruga of the pronotum is usually concolorous, but occasionally luteous anteriorly. The third antennal joint is either concolorous or pale at the base. The two pale annulations to the tibiae are in some specimens less distinct or even entirely wanting. All these varieties agree in the structure of the male and female genital segments.\n\nThe species has also been recorded from Malacca, Cambodia and Java.\n\n19. **Colpura scrutatrix** Bredd.\n\nKuching, Sarawak.\n\nOriginally described from the small island of Banguey, off the northern cape of British North Borneo.\n\n20. **Stenocolpura annulata** n. sp.\n\nElongate, parallel from humeral angles to apex of fourth abdominal segment, black, membrane (excluding interior basal area, basal border, and basal half of interior border) brownish-ochraceous, the somewhat callose scutellar apex, a small spot near middle of apical margin of corium, orificial tubercles, base of second and third antennal joints, fourth antennal joint (except base), rostrum, trochanters, base of femora, and two annulations to tibiae yellowish, abdomen with a very obscure paler spot at the apical angles of the segments, tarsi brown; above moderately thickly punctured, scutellum more remotely and more finely so, but along apical half of lateral margins with a row of deeper and larger punctures; beneath rather densely punctured with cinereous, more coarsely so on the pleurae; sparsely clothed with short and narrow yellowish scales. Head two-thirds longer than broad, first antennal joint as long as head, second two-fifths longer than first, third scarcely shorter than first and a little longer than fourth, rostrum reaching base of fifth ventral segment. Prothorax three times higher than head, pronotum strongly declivous, broader than long, transversely impressed before middle, posterior lobe a little convex with a longitudinal impression within the rounded, not prominent humeral angles, lateral margins straight, lateral ruga narrow, but in its anterior half distinctly visible also from above, apically obtuse-angled, not at all dentately prominent, evanescent towards the humeral angles. Elytra almost reaching apex of abdomen. Metapleurae with straight posterior margin. Abdomen beneath deeply grooved down its whole length, the groove shallow only in the last segment. Femora unarmed, the anterior pair beneath only with very few minute granules bearing a short seta. Length, \u2642 12 mm.\n\nMale: genital segment with the apical margin evenly rounded, neither sinuate nor impressed at apex.\nMt. Penrissen, Sarawak.\n\nAllied to *S. stenocephala* Bredd., from which it differs by smaller size and in having the head a little shorter, the pronotum less convex with the lateral ruga distinctly visible from above in its anterior half, the femora unarmed, the antennae and tibiae much more distinctly palely annulated, and the pale spots at the apical angles of the abdominal segments scarcely distinguishable. It is very similar in colour to *Colpura variipes* Westw., but is at once distinguished by the generic characters.\n\n*Stenocolpura* was originally described by Breddin (Revue d'Ent. 1900, p. 203) as a subgenus of *Colpura*, but in agreement with his later suggestion (Ann. Soc. Ent. Belg. 1906, p. 55) I consider it generically distinct. It differs from *Colpura* principally in the structure of the head and the sexual characters of both sexes. The head is longer and narrower than in *Colpura*, the eyes are more removed from the base, the lateral margins behind the eyes are only slightly rounded without the conspicuous postocular callus so characteristic of *Colpura*, the apical margin of the male genital segment is evenly rounded, not at all sinuated, the sixth female ventral segment is not cleft in the middle, as in *Colpura*, but posteriorly triangularly incised with the basal plica reaching the incisure, and the latero-apical lobes of the female genital segment are much broader than long. To this can be added that the prothorax seen in profile is higher compared with the head, the pronotum strongly sloping, the rostrum very long, and the venter deeply grooved almost down its whole length.\n\nThe Coreidae of the division *Hygiaria* are apparently more frequent, both as to species and specimens, in mountain regions than in the lowlands. In addition to the five species recorded above there is in the Sarawak Museum a specimen (from Trusan) of the Bornean *Colpura pacalis* Bredd.\n\n21. *Dasynus shelfordi* n. sp.\n\nBrownish-ochraceous, the narrow costal margin of corium and the leigate veins and apical margin of corium and clavus, and a percurrent longitudinal band on each side of venter between its middle and lateral margins of a lighter ochraceous colour, a narrow percurrent vitta immediately within pronotal lateral margins fuscous, membrane brown with its inner basal area olivaceous-black, the two pale ventral vittae at their exterior margin with a series of short fuscous streaks, one in each segment, the spiracles pallid; antennae fuscous, first joint brownish ochraceous, apex of the three first joints fuscous-black, fourth joint black with a broad subbasal pale ochraceous annulation; rostrum and legs brownish ochraceous; above, excluding head and apical pronotal area, rather thickly punctured with fuscous-black, plente coarsely and thickly punctate with pale fuscous. Head slightly broader than long, very distinctly produced beyond antenniferous tubercles, above almost impunctate, beneath obscurely conceolorously punctured, bucculae un-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\narmed, obtusely subangular anteriorly, antenn\u00e6 slender, longer than the body, first joint as long as head and pronotum together, second much shorter than first and a little longer than third, fourth a little longer than second, rostrum reaching anterior margin of metasternum, first joint reaching posterior margin of eyes, second much longer than third which is slightly shorter than fourth. Pronotum somewhat broader than long, lateral margins straight, slightly raised, humeral angles obtuse-angled, a little acuminate at apex, scarcely prominent. Elytra almost reaching apex of abdomen. Metapleurae with straight posterior margin. Abdomen beneath finely alutaceous, impunctate, male genital segment with the rounded apical margin acute-angularly incised in the middle.

It is somewhat variable in colour and still more so in size, and I am convinced that P. biguttata Reut. is the same species.\n\n25. Sastrapada oxyptera n. sp.\n\nNarrow, ochraceous, elytra whitish grey mottled with pale brown, a lateral band to head crossing eyes, the transverse veinlet separating the discal cell from the interior membranal cell, a small oblong spot near middle of exterior membranal cell, some more or less distinct longitudinal lines on pleur\u00e6 and on ventral lateral areas, a band running through middle of sterna and venter, a small spot at apical angles of abdominal segments, spiracles, and a small basal sublateral spot to ventral segments dark fuscous; antenn\u00e6, rostrum, and legs ochraceous, second antennal joint toward apex, third and fourth antennal joints, apex of rostrum, two rows of short streaks on upper side of front femora, under-side of these femora including the small spinelets, apex of tibiae, and tarsi fus-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ncous, the four anterior coxae (except apical margin) blackish, the larger spines of the fore femora whitish. Head a little shorter than pronotum, anteocular part as long as postocular part with the eyes, unarmed beneath, postocular part very distinctly longer than broad, first antennal joint as long as head, second joint more than half as long again as first, third about one-third the length of first, fourth one-half longer than third. Pronotum twice longer than broad, humeral node angular and subacuminate at apex. Elytra (\u2642) reaching base of last dorsal segment, the membrane pointed at apex, its interior margin more or less sinuate before the tip. Abdomen (\u2642) with the last dorsal segment parallel, its apical margin broadly sinuate, the apical angles subacute. Fore coxae not quite reaching posterior margin of prosternum; fore femora as long as the distance between anterior margin of eyes and base of pronotum, a little incrassated, about eight times longer than broad. Length, \u2642 16.8 mm.\n\nKuching and Santubong, Sarawak.\n\nThis species comes very near to S. bipunctata Bredd. (nec Walk.), but the fore and middle tibiae are not blackish at base and the last male dorsal segment is sinuate, not truncate, at apex. It is remarkable by having the membrane pointed at apex owing to the inner margin being a little sinuate before the tip. This character occurs, as noted by St\u00e5l, in some Neotropical genera of the Pygolampinae, but it is also met with in certain Old World species, although not mentioned in the descriptions.\n\nThe Bornean S. brevicornis Bredd. is represented in the Sarawak Museum by specimens from Baram.\n\nI suppose Distant has correctly identified S. bipunctata Walk. with the South Asiatic species which he regarded as belonging to S. baerensprungi St\u00e5l, but in Rhynch. Brit. Ind. V, p. 185 he wrongly places also S. bipunctata Bredd. as a synonym of that species. The species described by Breddin is totally different both in its structural and colour-characters, being narrower with much longer basal antennal joint, longer pronotum with acuminate humeral nodes, longer and less incrassated fore femora, and quite differently constructed last male dorsal segment. As to S. baerensprungi Dist., it will probably prove to be distinct from the true South European baerensprungi (of which Reuter in Ofv. Finsk. Vet. Soc. F\u00f6rh. LV, 14, pp. 64\u201465 has given a detailed redescription), but whether the Asiatic species should bear the name incerta Sign., or bipunctata Walk., or a new name, can be decided only after a thorough re-examination of Signoret's and Walker's types. S. bipunctata Bredd. must be renamed unless bipunctata Walk. proves to be the same species.\nIndia and Malay Beliefs.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt., (Oxon).\n\nBy the kindness of Dr. O. Schriek, Assistant Adviser for Native Affairs to the Government of the Dutch Indies, I have had my attention drawn to an article by M. Winternitz\u2014\"Bemerkungen zur malaischen Volksreligion\"\u2014being a review of Mr. Skeat's \"Malay Beliefs,\" in Wiener Zeitschrift fuer die Kunde des Morgenlandes, XIV Band, pages 243-264: Wien 1900. I am further indebted to the Batavian Society for a loan of the journal, since no library in the Peninsula possesses it. I propose here to summarize the conclusions of the reviewer, author also of \"Altindisches Hochzeitsrituell\" (Denkschriften der kais. Akademie d. Wiss., Wien 1892, page 68) as contributing further evidence on a subject I handled in a paper on \"Hindu Survivals in Malay Custom\" (Journal of the Federated Malay States Museums, Volume IX, part I). And I add some additional matter.\n\nIn a Javanese version of \"the churning of the ocean\" Wiseco (= Visvesa) or Brahman is still the highest of the Gods and supplies Batara Guru or Siva with the water of life wherewith to sprinkle the Gods and restore them to life (E. Metzger, Globus Bd. 44 (1883), p. 171 ff.). But in another Javanese legend Brahman and Visnu are sons of Batara Guru (ib. page 184). And in the Ht. Sang Samba, the Malay version of the Bhaumakavya, Batara Guru is the supreme God and as such is accepted by Malay magicians (Skeat pages 86-87). Now, Skeat says, \"I was repeatedly told that the Spectre Huntsman was a God, Batara Guru.\" In Malay legend the Spectre Huntsman is not only a God, Batara Guru, but known by other appellations of that God, such as \"King of the Land-folk\" (ib., page 120) (= To' Panjang Kuku, page 90), and identified at times with the Raja Hantu (page 418) who is sometimes said to be Batara Guru. Skeat compared the Malay legend with the English legend of the wild huntsman and his dogs or Gabriel's hounds (page 113): Sir William Maxwell opined it was of Aryan origin. In European folklore the wild huntsman is identified with historical or half-historical personages and a connection between him and the old German God Wodan can be traced (Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie 4. Anfl., page 766 foll.) Now Batara Guru or Siva is Rudra of Vedic times, Rudra \"the roarer, the terrible,\" the God of storms (Dowson's \"Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology\"). And it has been pointed out that in Rudra we find the same characteristics which are found in the German Wodan or Odin (and in the classical myths of Dionysus and Mars) namely those of a storm-god followed by hosts of spirits, a leader of lost souls, identified both in Malay and German legend.\nwith the Spectre Huntsman. Accordingly it has been surmised that we must premise an Indo-Germanic storm-god, the common source of the Indian and German myths (L v. Schroeder: Wiener Zeitschrift fuer die Kunde des Morgenlandes Bd. IX, 1895, pages 235-252). The identification by the Malays of the Spectre Huntsman with Siva clearly corroborates the relationship between Siva or Rudra and Odin.\n\nAgain just as in German folklore there are various versions of the tale of the wild huntsman, so Malay legend sometimes identified him with Rama and even made him a descendant of the Prophet Joseph (Skeat, page 119).\n\nFurther evidence that Malay magic came from India is the practice of Malay magicians declaring they know the source of the spirit they would exorcize or repel (ib. page 117): parallels for this occur in the Atharvaveda e.g., I, 3; VII, 76, 5. Compare also the use of hong = om in Malay charms. \"The syllable om is the door of heaven. Therefore he who is about to study the Veda shall begin his lesson by pronouncing it. If he has spoken anything else than what refers to the lesson, he shall resume his reading by repeating the word om: thus the Veda is separated from profane speech. And at sacrifices the orders given to the priests are headed by this word. And in common life at the occasion of ceremonies performed for the sake of welfare the sentence shall be headed by this word\" (Apastamba p. 49, \"Sacred Books of the East vol. II). In this context I would quote two sentences from Havell's \"Aryan Rule in India\" (pages 46 and 118) on the mantra, the Vedic forerunner of the Malay magician's charm:\u2014 \"A mantra could bring victory or defeat in wars, assure the prosperity of a State or the destruction of its enemies; it could be used to win votes in a popular assembly or to silence the arguments of an opponent and either by itself or in conjunction with medicinal prescriptions it could stop a cough or promote the growth of hair. It lost its efficacy if a single syllable were incorrect in expression or intonation.\" Moreover it had to be kept secret. In every respect the Malay charm corresponds with it. (Cf. J. R. A. S., S. B. 81, p. 8).\n\nThe idea that eclipses of sun or moon are due to the attempt of a dragon to swallow those bodies is not now associated by Malays with Indian legend. But there is a Javanese legend (Metzger, op. cit. page 186) practically identical with the Indian legend of Rahu quoted by Skeat (page 11).\n\nBelief in were-tigers or were-wolves is worldwide. It was current in India in Vedic times: in the Vaja-saneyi-Samhita XXX and the Satapatha-Brahmana XIII 2, 4, 2 are mentioned puru-savaghra or \"men-tigers.\" (H. Oldenberg, Religion des Vedas, Berlin 1894, p. 84).\n\nTabu vocabularies are employed in all departments of Malay magic (Skeat, pages 35, 139, 192, 315, 253, 523). They were\ncommon in ancient India:\u2014Satapatha, Br. VI, 1, 1, 2, etc.; the Mantrapatha (Anecdota Oxoniensia) Oxford 1897, p. 29. The Shataka or young Brahman, who had concluded his study of the Vedas and taken vows, had to observe many such tabus:\u2014he must say bhagala for kapala \u201chead,\u201d manidhanus for indradhanus \u201crainbow,\u201d dhenubharya \u201ca cow which will become a milch-cow,\u201d instead of adhenu \u201ca cow which gives no milk\u201d (Gautama Dharmasastra IX, 19-22; Apast. Dharmas. I, 31, 11; 12; 15; 16;\u2014\u201cThe Sacred Laws of the Aryas\u201d Part I, pages 216-224, 92-98, Oxford; Baudh. Dh. II, 6, 11, 18; Vasistha Dh. XII, 32).\n\nWinternitz finds parallels for the figurative language of Malay betrothal verses (Skeat pages 364 and 634), where the girl is called a calf, in the language of the Ests where the wooer pretends to search for a lost calf (L. v. Schroeder, Hochzeitsbrauche der Esten, Berlin 1888, page 36); of the Finns where the wooer pretends he wishes to buy a bird; of the Sardinians, where the wooer asks for a white dove or a white calf.\n\nThe mimic combat for the person of a Malay bride (Skeat, page 381) is widespread, of course, even in Europe: it was practised in ancient India (Winternitz: Altindisches Hochzeitsrituell, page 68). The throwing of rice over the head of the bridegroom (Skeat, page 382) is commonly observed by all Indo-Germanic peoples. Confarreatio forms part of a Malay wedding as of marriages among so many races: it was a ceremony known in ancient India (Winternitz, op. cit., page 79). Malay bride and groom are princes for the wedding-day (Skeat, page 388). In Kashmir the bridegroom is entitled for the day Maharaja:\u2014cf. A. Stein\u2019s Rajatarangini I, page 131. In the Ramayana \u201ca marriage-crown\u201d is mentioned:\u2014Growse\u2019s \u201cRamayana\u201d Book I, page 182 (Allahabad 1877). In Modern Bengal the poorest bridegroom wears a tinsel crown (Lal Behari Day, \u201cBengal Peasant Life\u201d 1884, page 88)\u2014A similar custom obtains in Russia, Scandinavia and parts of Germany.\n\nWinternitz notes that Malay animistic beliefs concerning trees and plants are derived neither from Islam nor from Brahmanism\n\nThere are other customs and beliefs which the reviewer might have noted, had he found space. The belief in the need for human sacrifice at the founding of a building is common to East and West:\u2014Skeat, page 144; Crooke\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Popular Religion and Folk-lore of Northern India\u201d page 237 and Index; Robertson Smith\u2019s \u201cReligion of the Semites\u201d page 158; Greek modern folk-songs (Passow Carm. Pop. Gr. 512, and \u201cFolklore\u201d 1899). The Malay notion of a mousedeer in the moon (Skeat, page 13) must be derived from the \u201chare\u201d in the moon common in Indian folk-lore and found in the Sanskrit epithets sasin, marganka, harinanka \u201chaving the mark of a deer.\u201d The Brahman held the work of a police officer to be degrading:\u2014Gautama,\nXVII, 17 (\"The Sacred hands of the Aryas\" Volume I, Oxford). So to this day does the Malay. In the code of Manu among persons to be avoided were physicians, sufferers from phthisis, elephantiasis, epilepsy, leprosy and erysipelas, persons with thick hair on the body, a one-eyed man, a usurer, a mariner, a gambling-house keeper and dancers. Even now the Malay regards the professions of physician and sailor as degrading, and distrusts one-eyed men and hairy persons.\n\nThe Brahman student \"shall not eat food offered at a funeral oblation\" (Apastamba, pp. 7 and 43, \"Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. II): there are Malay rajas who observe this tabu. \"He shall not sit on a seat higher than that of his teacher\" (ib., p. 30); \"he shall not drink water standing or bent forward\" (ib., p. 57); \"sheep's milk is forbidden\" (ib., p. 83). All these tabus are common among Malays. The Brahman student, \"may not feed a thief, an emnuch, an outcast, an atheist, a destroyer of the sacred fire, the husband of a younger sister married before the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose youngest sister was married first, a younger brother married before the elder brother, an elder brother married after his younger brother\" (Gautama, ib., p. 254). The objection to younger children, especially girls, marrying before elder is called by Malays langkah batang and universally disliked.\n\nThe henna dance with lighted candles (Wilkinson's \"Incidents of Malay Life, 2nd ed., p. 58 and Skeat's \"Malay Magic\") is hardly likely to have been invented by a primitive people to whom candles were unknown. A dance with lighted candlesticks is common in Persia (Hales' \"From Persian Uplands,\" p. 121, London 1920) and the Malay dance would seem to have come with other marriage-ceremonies from India.\n\nThere would seem to be a similarity between the outlook of those of Hindu faith towards Mahameru, the abode of Indra and Vishnu, the pivot of the universe, (Dowson op. cit.) and the outlook of the Greek towards Olympus. \"Whatever the original meaning of Olympus may be, it seems clear that the Olympian gods, wherever their worshippers moved, tended to dwell on the highest mountain in the neighbourhood and the mountain thereby became Olympus\" (Gilbert Murray's \"Four Stages of Greek Religion\": cf. Journal 81, page 26).\n\nThough I do not suggest its introduction to have been of early date, yet perhaps one may note in a paper dealing with India and Malay beliefs the fact that the language of signs practised in Malay intrigue is identical with that practised in Kandy:\u2014 \"Kandian girls make almost imperceptible signs to each other. If without moving the head, the eyes be momentarily directed towards the door, the question is asked, 'Shall we go out?' An affirmative reply is given by an expressionless gaze, a negative one by closing the eyes for an instant\" (Parker's \"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\" Volume II, page 32).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nThe Folklore of the Hikayat Malim Deman\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt., (Oxon).\n\nIn the Malay folk romance *Malim Deman* (ed. R. O. Winstedt and A. J. Sturrock, Singapore 1908) the hero from whom the tale takes its name finds the ring and a tress of hair of the princess he is fated to wed in a golden bowl afloat on a stream. He fumigates them with incense whereupon their owner and her six sisters fly down from fairy-land. Malim Deman steals the magic flying raiment of the youngest princess and so wins her for his bride. Owing to neglect she flies home to fairy-land with her child. Malim Deman borrows a *borak*\u2014the flying animal whereon the Prophet Mohamed ascended to heaven\u2014from genies, pursues and regains his wife and brings her back to earth.\n\nNow the episode of a prince falling in love with a princess from finding her hair floating downstream, besides occurring in an Egyptian romance three thousand years old (*Clouston\u2019s \u201cPopular Tales and Fictions,\u201d* vol. I, p. 351), is common in Indian folklore:\u2014No. 4 of Lal Bahari Day\u2019s \u201cFolk-tales of Bengal,\u201d and the second story of the Tamil romance \u201cMadana Kamaraja Kadai,\u201d translated by Pandit S. M. Natesa Sastry. In a Sinhalese folk-tale a king finding a hair in a fish\u2019s belly wishes to wed the owner (*Parker\u2019s \u201cVillage Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\u201d* vol. II, p. 168, Tale 111). Incidentally one may note that a hair in a bowl is one of the regalia of the Yauntuan of Negri Sembilan.\n\nMagic flying raiment (*baju layang kain layang*) is part of the stock-in-trade of the world\u2019s folk-lore. Nymphs, apsaras or fairies bathing, and one of them having her clothes (*Tawney\u2019s Katha Sarit Sagara,* vol. II, p. 452 and 576; a Bengal story in \u201cThe Indian Antiquary,\u201d vol. IV, p. 54; Thornhill\u2019s \u201cIndian Fairy Tales\u201d p. 15) or flying garments (*Swynnerton\u2019s Indian Nights \u201cEntertainments,* p. 343) stolen by a man who marries her is a very common plot in Indian folk-lore and literature. In the Persian romance of King Bahram Ghur and Husin Banu the hero obtains his fairy bride by filching her dove-dress (*Clonston op. cit.,* vol. I, pp. 182-191). There is a Santali version of the story and a Japanese (B. H. Chamberlain\u2019s \u201cClassical Poetry of the Japanese\u201d). Cf. also Parker *op. cit.,* vol. II, Tale 152, p. 359. But of course the classical story of the bride-maidens is the tale of Hasan of Bassorah in the \u201cArabian Nights\u201d (*Burton,* vol. VIII, p. 7).\n\nThe world-wide circulation of the myth of the swan-maiden and its various forms and stages is discussed by Hartland on pages 255-332 of \u201cThe Science of Fairy Tales\u201d (London 1891).\nThe Princess of Gunong Ledang.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt., (Oxon).\n\nIt is related in the \"Malay Annals\" (Shellabear's Romanized edition, vol. II, page 177, 1910: chapter 27) that Sultan Mahmud of old Malacca wished to wed the fairy princess of Gunong Ledang. She replied to his messengers, \"If the prince of Malacca desires me, make me a gold and a silver bridge from Malacca to this mountain: for a betrothal gift I want seven trays of mosquitoes' livers, seven trays of lice's livers, a tub of tears, a tub of the juice of young betel-palms, a basin of the prince's blood and a basin of the blood of his son Raja Ahmad.\"\n\nThere is a parallel to this episode in the Persian Sindib\u00e1d Nama. \"A merchant arriving at Kashgar sells his stock of sandalwood to a rogue, who persuades him it is valueless, on condition that he give in return 'Whatever else he may choose.' Finding himself swindled he resorts in disguise to the house of the blind chief of the rogues and hears him rate his subordinate, 'You are a fool; for instead of this merchant asking a measure of gold, he may require you to give him a measure of male fleas with silken housings and jewelled trappings and how will you do that?' Next day before the Kadzi the merchant makes this demand and gets back his sandal-wood. The same story contains the incident of a worsted gambler being required to drink up the sea.\" (Clouston's \"Popular Tales and Fictions,\" Vol. II, pages 105-106).\nHikayat Abu Nawas.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt., (Oxon.)\n\nIn Journal No. 81, pp. 15-21 I gave an outline of the two Malay recensions of the Hikayat Abu Nawas. In the present paper I propose to give further parallels for some of the tales in the second version, my references being to pages in the former Journal.\n\n(a) \"p. 18, Tale IV. Harun A'r-Rashid orders Abu Nawas to tell him the number of the stars of heaven and to determine the centre of the world.\"\n\nThis story with the same solution to the two problems occurs in Sinhalese folk-lore (Parker's \"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\" vol. I. p. 152):\n\n\"The king asked, 'Dost thou know the centre of the country and the number of the stars?'\n\nThe youth fixed a stick in the ground, and showed it. 'Behold! Here is the centre of one's country. Measure from the four quarters, and after you have looked at the account if it should not be correct, be good enough to behead me.' The king lost over that.\n\nThen he told him to say the number of the stars in the sky. Throwing down on the ground the goatskin that he was wearing, 'Count these hairs and count the stars in the sky. Should they not be equal, be good enough to behead me.' The king lost over that also.\"\n\nThe two stories are identical. Parker adds variant versions, one collected in Colombo, one in Cairo.\n\n(b) p. 20, Tale XIV. The episode of a clever brother taking service under a cruel master, who has mutilated a foolish brother by cutting off his nose, a hand or an ear or plucking out an eye, and then retaliating on the master in kind is a common plot in Indian stories e.g. \"Folktales of the Santal Parganas\" (Bodding) pp. 124 and 258 and 497; \"Folk-Tales of Kashmir (Knowles) 2nd ed., p. 98; \"Indian Nights' Entertainments\" (Swynnerton) p. 106; \"The Orientalist,\" vol. I, p. 131.\n\n(c) p. 21, Tale XXII. In \"The Indian Antiquary\" vol. I, p. 345, in a Bengal story, a shepherd discriminates a demon from a man whose form he has taken,\u2014living with his wife during the man's absence,\u2014by boring through a reed and saying that the true person must be one who could pass through it. In the South-Indian \"Tales of Mariyada Raman\" (P. Ramachandra Rao)\np. 43 the test between husband and demon is entering a narrow-necked jug. In \"Folk-Tales of Bengal\" (Day) p. 182 a similar story is found.\n\n(d) I gave a parallel for the story of Abu Nawas sewing a broken mortar in my last article. I have since come across several more. In the Persian metrical Sindib\u0101d Namah a rogue produces a stone\u2014for some reason not mentioned in the MS.\u2014and says to him, 'Make me from this piece of marble a pair of trousers and a shirt.' Taking his cue from the rogue's chief, he asks first for an iron thread to sew them with. In the Talmud there is the story of an Athenian who walking about Jerusalem picked up a broken mortar and asked a tailor to patch it. 'Willingly' said the tailor, taking up a handful of sand, 'if you will make me a few threads of this material.' (Clouston's \"Popular Tales and Fictions,\" vol. II, pp. 105 and 112). In Muhammadan legends of Putri Balkis, one of the problems she gives Solomon is to thread a diamond (Weil's \"Biblical Legends of the Mussulmans,\" London 1846).\n\n(e) p. 20 Tale XIII. This tale is told of Abu'l-Husin in the \"Arabian Nights\" (Payne's \"Tales from the Arabic,\" vol. I, pp. 31-42) in a far more spirited fashion.\nHikayat Puspa Wiraja.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt., (Oxon).\n\nThere is a MS. of this tale at Leiden (Codex 1401, Juynboll's \"Catalogue\" p. 156, CXXIX): it was written at Krokot in A.H. 1237. No other MS. of the work is recorded in any public library. J. C. Fraissinet printed it as the Hikayat Bispu Raja at Leiden in 1849. A fragment was published in Meursinge's \"Maleisch leesboek\" I, 2nd ed., pp. 20-44. A version was printed in 1899 at the Government Press, Singapore. This paper will not deal with textual criticism and I have not had access to Fraissinet's text. But by the kindness of the Batavian Society I have been able to consult van der Tuuk's criticism of Fraissinet's text in the \"Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indie\" 1849 II, p. 1-15:\u2014no copy of the volume exists in the Peninsula! From that paper I infer that the Singapore text is certainly of the same recension and may perhaps be Fraissinet's text corrected by a Malay pundit. Both texts are entitled Hikayat Bispu Raja and both read \u062c\u0631\u0645 \u0641\u064a.\n\nThe Singapore text retains the Leiden MS.'s ganti baginda k\u0113raja-an (p. 12, l. 11) where Freissinet wrongly alters to ganti k\u0113rajaan baginda (p. 15, l. 1). On the other hand it follows Fraissinet's ayah h\u0113ndak bawa (p. 15, l. 6) for h\u0113ndak bapa of the MS.\n\nVan der Tuuk has elucidated and amended names of persons and places. For \u0643\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0633\u0646 (or \u0643\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0633\u0646 of the Singapore ed.) he would read \u0643\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0646 \"lovely\" of a woman. For \"Astana Pura N\u0113gara\" he would substitute \"Hestina Pura N\u0113gara.\" \"City of Elephants,\" pointing out how the author has borrowed two other words out of the Hikayat Pandawa Jaya, the Malay version of the Mahabharata,\u2014chochor the name of a swallow (p. 6, l. 18) rajasa the name of a tree. He translates \"Samanta Pura N\u0113gara\" as \"Frontier City\" and derives \u0643\u0631\u062f (or \u0643\u0631\u062f Singapore text, p. 7), the name of a tree, from the Indian nyagrodhah. He detects in the Leiden MS. traces of a Javanese copyist, m\u0113rentahkan for m\u0113m\u0113rentahkan, masang for m\u0113masang, confusion between b and p leading in the title to \"Bispu Raja\" instead of the correct \"Puspa Wiraja.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe tale purports to be from the Siamese. Certainly van der Tuuk is right in doubting such an origin not only from the lack of any Siamese word or title in the text, to which he calls attention, but also from the closeness of resemblance between Malay and Perso-Indian versions, which render an intermediate Siamese channel highly improbable. He adverts to the Indian names in the tale and surmises that the bare plot of the story, disaster following children's molestation of young birds, may have come from the Pali. He suggests that the word \"Taksla,\" which is given in the tale as the Siamese equivalent of \"Astana Pura N\u0113gara,\" may be \"Takshasila\" the great Indian university of Buddhist literature.\n\nI propose here to give an outline of the story and deal with it only from the standpoint of comparative folklore.\n\nIn Astana Pura N\u0113gara 'the City of Palaces' called in the Siamese language Taksla, lived Raja Puspa Wiraja with his consort Kemala Kisna Dewi and their two sons Jaya Indra and Jaya Chandra. One day Antaraja, his brother and heir-apparent, plotted with the young men to dethrone Puspa Wiraja and steal his consort. Puspa Wiraja determined to vacate his throne and flee, so as to avoid civil war. His consort agreed\u2014\"Where you go, I will go. For I am as it were a shoe: if the shoe is left behind, the foot is hurt\"\u2014a simile found also in the XVIth century Malay version of the Persian \"Tales of a Parrot\" (Hikayat Bayan Budiman, p. 31, ed. Winstedt). They fled into the forest and at dawn rested under a tree by the side of a river three miles broad. In the tree was a parroquet's nest, in which were two young parroquets twittering for their mother. The young princes begged for the birds, though their father warned them that to separate nestlings from the mother bird was unlucky. However he gave them to the boys and a little later restored them to the nest; when their mother returned, she detected the smell of man's hands on her offspring and pecked them. The prince carried his consort across the river, leaving his two sons to be fetched next. Before he can return, they are found and taken away and adopted by two fishermen. While he is searching for them, a sea-captain carries off his consort from the opposite bank. The prince is left desolate and wanders on, till one day he comes to a small pavilion outside a city and climbs into it and falls asleep. Now the king of that country had been dead three days leaving no heir. So the chiefs harnessed an elephant with the royal trappings and let him loose to choose a king. The elephant went straight to the pavilion wherein Puspa Wiraja slept and lifted him up on his back. So he became king of Samanta Pura N\u0113gara. One day the fishermen who had adopted the two little princes they found beside the river determined to take them to court and offer their services to this new just king. They are rewarded and the boys, who they swear are sons of their loins and not adopted, become royal heralds:\u2014(in this part of the story apparently only one\nfisherman is spoken of but it is not quite clear if there are still two.) The captain who had carried off Puspa Wiraja's consort heard of the fame of the elephant chosen king and sailed off to Semanta Pura N\u00e8gara. He was well received and feasted. As the feasting was to last all night, the king sent his two young heralds to guard the captain's ship. Keeping watch on board outside the cabin wherein their mother unknown to them was confined, the two young men talked and the elder to keep the younger awake told him who their parents really were. Their mother, waking from a dream that a young man gave her two flowers (bunga tanjong) overheard their talk, recognized that they must be her sons and rushing out of her cabin embraced them to the scandal of the crew who reported to their master. The king in a rage at the loose conduct of his young heralds ordered their execution. In vain their mother cried out the truth: the captain kept her on board. The boys were led to execution, but the watchman at the eastern gate of the city refused egress, declaring it was an old custom that execution might not take place at night, and in the morning the king might change his mind. He points the moral with the tale of the golden plantain.\n\n\"Once a prince ordered his chief astrologer to choose an auspicious moment for commencing to build a palace. 'Begin to build when I strike my magic gong and the palace will be golden,' said the astrologer. On the sound of the gong the first post was planted but the palace did not turn to gold and the astrologer was executed. One day an old husbandman brought a golden plantain to the prince. 'I got it,' he explained, 'from a sucker I planted at the stroke of the gong beaten when the building of your palace commenced.' Then too late the prince repented of the execution of his astrologer.\"\n\nSo the executioners went to seek egress from the southern gate. \"These boys accused of making love!\" said the gate-keeper. \"Besides, executions may not be carried out at night, and the king may repent of his haste. Have you not heard the tale of the magic mango.\n\n\"Once a prince had a pet parroquet, which would fly into the forest and bring him fruit. One day the parroquet came to a mango tree and heard the birds in its foliage say, 'Whoever eats the fruit of this tree, his body will become golden.' So he took a mango back in his beak and told his master. 'We will plant the mango and get many fruit,' said the king. When the tree grew up, the prince ordered an old man to go out and eat the first ripe mango which had fallen. It had rolled unnoticed into a cobra's nest and there was venom on it. The old man fell dead. In fury and suspicion the prince killed his parroquet. 'The fruit of this tree shall be used instead of the creese for executions,' he ordered. But the first robber ordered to eat of the fruit turned golden. Only then did the prince, sorrowing for his parroquet, make enquiries and discover the existence of the cobra's nest.\"\nThis story occurs in the Persian \"Tales of a Parrot,\" where a sick prince sends a parrot to get fruit of the tree of life. The parrot gets it but tells the story of Solomon and the Water of Life\u2014which inset tale alone occurs in the Malay *It. Bayan Budiman*. The first fruit taken by an old man had been poisoned by a serpent. The parrot doomed to death gets another fruit and by it restores an old woman to youth and beauty, and so the parrot escapes death. In a Canarese story *Katha Manjari* the fruit is a youth-giving mango; the parrot is killed; the real virtue of the fruit is discovered by a washerman's mother who eats it to commit suicide but finds herself restored to youth. The king stabs himself for sorrow. There is a similar story in the Tamil *Alakesa Katha* (pp. 174-6 Clouston's \"Flowers from a Persian Garden,\" London 1890 and \"Group of Eastern Romances and Stories,\" 1889).\n\nSo the executioners took the lads to the western gate. Here again the keeper refuses to open the gate and tells the tale of the snake and the mongoose.\n\n\"Once a peasant and his wife went to work in the rice-fields, leaving their baby in the care of a pet mongoose. A snake crept out and bit the child so that it died. The mongoose thereupon tore the snake to pieces and hid his body underneath some rolled-up mats; after which the mongoose with bloodied mouth lay to rest in the doorway. The peasants returned, saw the dead baby and the bloodied mongoose and, suspecting him of killing the baby, slew their pet.\n\nThen opening the mat to make a shroud for the baby's corpse they saw the dead snake and realized too late how the mongoose had fought for their child.\"\n\nSo the executioners turned to the north gate, where the keeper hearing there has been no proper trial tells the tale of the faithful watch-dog.\n\n\"Once a poor man and his wife owned a pet dog. The man went to sea to earn a livelihood and the wife encouraged a lover. At last the husband returned and was made welcome by his false wife. At night he had to return to watch his ship. So the woman's lover came. The dog killed false wife and lover. In the morning the man came up from his boat, saw his wife's corpse and speared the dog before he discovered her lover's body. His remorse for killing the faithful dog was great.\"\n\nDay broke and the four gate-keepers went to the chief astrologer and arranged to intercede for the two lads. The king consents to hear their case, discovers to his joy that they are his sons; sends for their mother and believes the captain when he declares a fierce heat has always prevented him from approaching her. Amid great rejoicings the royal family is re-united.\n\nAfter some years Puspa Wiraja grows old and resolves to abdicate in favour of Jaya Indra, his son. An elaborate bathing-house (*puncha persada*) of 17 tiers is erected and after ceremonial bathing with limes the young prince is installed.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nAntaraja, the usurper, dies and Jaya Chandra the younger son of Puspa Wiraja is raised to the throne in the city of palaces.\n\nThere is another Malay version of the story in that pastiche, the *Hikayat Maharaja Ali*, but details differ.\n\nMaharaja Ali and his queen were banished because of an unruly son. Twelve thieves robbed the royal fugitives as in a tale of the *Hikayat Bayan Budiman*. The unruly son is lost and becomes later keeper of the prison into which his two brothers are thrown for execution. The queen begging alms at a mosque is carried off by Raja Sirdala king of the country and delays his advances by relating how Solomon detected and sentenced thieves who tried to steal a dream princess from her husband; when the king persists, she prays that his arms may be shortened so that he may not embrace her, and her prayer is fulfilled. Meanwhile Maharaja Ali has been devoured by a crocodile and his two sons adopted by a ferryman. Maharaja Ali\u2019s skull rolls at the feet of the Prophet Jesus and its owner is restored to life, (an episode borrowed from the *Hikayat Raja Jumjumah*) and placed by Jesus on his former throne, unrecognized and unrecognized by his people who had banished him. Raja Sirdala comes to Maharaja Ali for medicine for his shortened arms, bringing the chaste queen in his ship. Her two sons are put to guard the ship, talk of their origin, are embraced by their mother and sentenced to death. The keeper of the prison proves to be their eldest brother. He takes them before the king and all comes right, as in the other version. Raja Sirdala is kindly treated and married to a vizier\u2019s daughter.\n\nIn this recension the incident of the crocodile bears some relation to a Kashmirian version (*vide infra*).\n\nThere is yet another Malay version of the tale in the *Hikayat Bakhtiar*, which is far closer to that of the *Hikayat Puspa Wiraja*. It is shorter and omits the names of people and places, trees and birds. One fisherman, not two, rescues the two young princes. Their mother tells her story to the sea-captain and is honoured and respected. There are three gate-keepers, not four: the order of the tales they recite as a warning against hasty action is different, and the tales differ slightly in detail. The first gate-keeper tells the story of how a baby killed by a snake was avenged by a cat, not a mongoose; and the baby is motherless. The second tells the story of the dog killing a faithless wife and her lover: it is not stated that the husband is a sailor. The third watchman tells the story of the palace which did not turn golden; and this version is clearer in that it is related how the old man whose plantain did turn golden deliberately arranged to plant his sucker at the exact moment prescribed by the astrologer for commencing to build the palace and how the builders of the palace in their excitement were just too late. The plot of a queen being caught kissing a tall son by a previous husband or lover occurs in the Persian, \u201cTales of a Parrot\u201d and in the *Bakhtiar Nama* (Clouston\u2019s \u201cTales from a Persian Garden,\u201d pp. 166-172).\nNow as Brandes noticed, the *Hikayat Bakhtiar*, the *Hikayat Gholum*, the older Malay version of the *Kalila dan Damina*, all have a very remote origin in the Persian *Bakhtiar-Namah*, though now they differ from it entirely and variously in framework and in tales. That the Malay *Hikayat Bakhtiar* is somewhat nearer the Persian than the *Hikayat Puspa Wiraja* may be inferred from a conclusion drawn by Clouston (\"Popular Tales and Fictions,\" vol. II, pp. 166-186). He points out how in the India Office copy of the Persian *Sinbad Namah*, written in verse in 1374 A.D., there is a story of a cat saving a baby from a cobra, whereas in the *Panchatantra* it is an ichneumon or mongoose, in the *Hitopadesa* a weasel, in a Chinese version a mongoose, in Syriac Greek Hebrew and old Castilian versions a dog. Again. Only in the Persian version is the baby motherless, its mother having died in childbirth. Clouston gives the following abstract of the story as told in *Sinbad Namah*:\n\n\"In a city of Cathay there dwelt a good and blameless woman and her husband, who was an officer of the king. By-and-by she bore him a son and thereupon died and the officer procured a nurse to bring up the child. Now he had a cat of which he was very fond, and to which his wife also had been much attached. One day he went out on some business and the nurse also left the house, no one remaining but the infant and the cat. Presently a frightful snake came in and made for the cradle to devour the child. The cat sprang upon it, and after a desperate fight succeeded in killing it. When the man returned, he was horrified at seeing a mangled mass lying on the floor. The snake had vomited so much blood and poison that its form was hidden and the man thinking that the cat, which came up to him, rubbing against his legs, had killed his son, struck it a blow and slew it on the spot. Immediately after he discovered the truth of the matter, how the poor cat had killed the snake in defence of the boy; and his grief knew no bounds.\"\n\nThis is very close to the version of the Malay *Hikayat Bakhtiar*. But unlike this Persian version and the *Panchatantra* and a modern Indian version quoted by Clouston from \"Past Days in India\" and a Sinhalese recension collected by Parker (\"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\" vol. III, pp. 27-28) and the versions which are current in Europe, both of the Malay recensions mar the plot by allowing the snake to kill the child!\n\nThe main plot of the *Hikayat Puspa Wiraja* is also with minor alterations the framework plot of the Malay *Hikayat Bakhtiar*. In the latter story a king dies leaving two sons, of whom the younger plots against the elder. The elder son abdicates and enters the forest with his queen, who there bears a son she is forced in their flight to desert. A childless merchant Idris and his wife Siti Sara adopted the infant and call him Bakhtiar. The royal wanderers reach a land, whose king has just died without issue; and they are selected to succeed to the throne by a sagacious ele-\nphant. One day Idris goes to court. Bakhtiar insists on accompanying him and unrecognized is given the post of chief vizier to his own royal father. The older viziers are jealous and get him imprisoned and sentenced to death on a false charge of having an amour with one of the king's mistresses. He postpones his execution (for 17 days) by telling (4) tales, the last of which is the shorter version of the *Hikayat Puspa Wiraja*. Finally the king discovers Bakhtiar is his own son.\n\nAn outline of the Persian *Bakhtiar Namah* or \"History of the Ten Viziers,\" the Muhammadan imitation of the Indian story of *Sinbad* or \"The seven Viziers\" may be read in \"The Encyclopaedia of Islam,\" (Houtsma and Arnold, No. X, pp. 602-3) together with references to literature on the work. The writer of that article remarks, \"The story was originally written in Persian, and the older Persian version, which we possess, seems to have been composed about 600 A.H.\" Brandes has constructed a *stemma codicum* for the Malay version (translated from the Arabic) called *Ht. Gholam* (Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal Land en-Volkenkunde, Bat. Gen. XXXVIII, p. 191) and he has written on the Malay versions termed *Ht. Bakhtiar* (ib., p. 230 and XLI, p. 292). It may be noted that in Ouseley's later Persian redaction from India, as also in most well-known editions of the \"Arabian Nights,\" in the *Ht. Gholam* and in the older Malay *Kalila dan Dam\u00eena*, the tale with which the Puspa Wiraja is perhaps connected, that of Abu Sabar, is the third inset tale. None of these tales of Abu Sabar are so close to the Puspa Wiraja as tales to be found in Indian folk-lore.\n\nIn \"Folk-Tales of Kashmir\" (Knowles, 2nd ed., p. 154) an exiled king with consort and two children takes a passage by a vessel, which sails away with the queen, leaving her husband and children behind. She is sold to a merchant whom she consents to marry if she is not reunited with her family for two years. The king crossing a river to fetch his sons is carried away by the stream, and is swallowed by a fish; when the fish dies on the bank, he is saved by a potter and trained to that trade. He is selected to be king of the potter's country by a royal elephant and hawk. The fisherman who had reared his sons brings them to court and unrecognized they become pages. They are set to guard the ship of the merchant who had bought their mother. She overheard the older telling the younger of their lineage and fate. Persuading the merchant to complain to the king of their conduct, she gets the chance of revealing her story and the royal family is re-united.\n\nIn Boddings' \"Folklore of the Santal Parganas\" (p. 183) the same story occurs, with a few minor alterations.\n\nTwo Sinhalese versions, identical in plot but damaged in the telling, are recorded in Parker's \"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon\" (vol. III, pp. 380-383 and pp. 91-92), an exhaustive collection of tales, enriched with references among which are many of those quoted in this paper.\nA version fairly near the Malay may be read in Payne\u2019s \u201cTales from the Arabic of the Breslau an Calcutta editions of the 1001 Nights,\u201d vol. II, pp. 66-80, (London 1884). The hero is a king of Hind. The queen is persuaded to go aboard the merchant\u2019s ship by the treachery of an old man with whom she and the king lodged after the loss of their children at the river. The king is chosen to a vacant throne by an elephant. There is a proper trial of the two pages who are the king\u2019s sons, and they are acquitted. The merchant, a Magian, is tortured to death. No tales are inset.\n\nIn the \u201cArabian Nights\u201d (Lady Burton\u2019s ed., vol. III, p. 366) a poor Jew with his wife and two sons are wrecked, and separated. The father becomes king of an island where a voice reveals to him buried treasure. His sons, not knowing that he is their father or they are brothers, take service at court. They are set to guard their mother who is brought by a merchant. Conversing they discover they are brothers and their mother overhearing them recognizes them to be her sons. She persuades the merchant to complain to the king of their improper conduct and so they are revealed to the king as his sons and she as his wife.\n\nThe selection of a ruler by a sagacious elephant is common in Indian stories:\u2014Parker, op. cit., vol. I, p. 81; Natesa Sastri\u2019s \u201cThe Story of Madana Kama Raja,\u201d p. 125, ff., a Tamil story; Day\u2019s \u201cFolk-Tales of Bengal,\u201d p. 99. Sometimes a festal car drawn by horses takes the place of an elephant. \u201cIt is said that in Benares, when a king died, four lotus coloured horses were yoked to a festive carriage, on which were displayed the five emblems of royalty (sword, parasol, diadem, slipper and fan). This was sent out of a gate of the city and a priest bade it proceed to him who had sufficient merit to rule the kingdom.\u201d (The Jatakas, No. 445, ed. E. B. Cowell IV, 25; cf. also Francis and Thomas\u2019 \u201cJataka Tales,\u201d p. 418).\n\nThat the insetting of plot within plot is Indian is remarked in my paper on the Hikayat Nakhoda Muda.\nHikayat Nakhoda Muda.\n\nBY R. O. WINSTEDT, D. LITT., (OXON.)\n\n\"When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never'.\"\n\nAll's Well that Ends Well, Act III, Sc. II.\n\nIt was Dr. H. H. Juynboll in his Catalogue of Malay manuscripts in Leiden University Library (p. 171) who pointed out how the plot of Shakespeare's play occurs also in a Malay romance, the Hikayat Nakhoda Muda.\n\nHe might have added that the plot which Shakespeare got from Boccaccio is common in Indian tales. In Mary Stokes' \"Indian Fairy Tales\", p. 216, a merchant going on a long journey tells his wife that on his return he shall expect to find a well built and a son born. By a trick the woman got money to build the well. Disguised as a milk-maid she met her husband's boat and was taken by him to live on it; when discarded, she went home taking his cap and portrait. Returning from his long journey, the merchant found a well built, a child born and his own cap and portrait\u2014evidence of its parentage. A similar plot occurs in \"The Story of Madana Kama Raja\", edited by Natesa Sastri, p. 246, and in Knowles' \"Folk-Tales of Kashmir\", 2nd edition, p. 104 and in Sinhalese folklore,\u2014Parker's \"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon\", vol. II, No. 92, pp. 81-2, and vol. III, No. 249, pp. 235-327. In the Katha Sarit Sagara of the 11th century Kashmirian poet Somadeva (Tawney's ed. vol. II, p. 620) a Brahman deserts his wife, whereupon she goes to his native town and establishing herself as a courtesan rejects all visitors till her husband unaware of her identity stays with her: she bears him a child who reconciles them.\n\nThere are two manuscripts of the Malay tale, (which is also known as Hikayat Siti Sara), one at Leiden (Cod. 1763 (1)) written at Batavia in 1825, one in the Batavian Library (Bat. Gen. 77) copied at Macassar in 1814. The plot is summarized by Juynboll (p. 171) as follows. Sultan Mansur Shah of Ghazna (\u063a\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0648\u064a) dreamt of a princess and sent Husain Mandari and Husain Mandi, sons of his vizier, to search for her. In Batlawi they find Siti Sara who resembles the princess of the Sultan's dream. Sultan Mansur Shah weds the princess but deserts her.\nfor barrenness, sailing off to the island Langkawi with his treasure and a mare. He declares that he will return only when his treasure-chamber shall be refilled, his mare be with foal and his wife with child. Disguised as sea-captain (Nakhoda Muda) she visits Langkawi, and beating her husband at chess wins his treasure and his mare. Pretending to be the unfaithful mistress of the sea-captain, she visits the Sultan by night and becomes with child. Then she summons him home, saying that his three vows are fulfilled.\n\nIt may be remarked that the Ghaznevid dynasty (976-1186 A.D.) founded in Afghanistan by a Turkish slave ruled for a few years from Lahore to Samarcand and Isfahan, and permanently established Islam in the Punjab: its court in the 11th century formed the rallying-point of all that was best in the literary and scientific culture of the day (A. R. Nicholson\u2019s \u201cA Literary History of the Arabs\u201d, pp. 268-9). So it would not be surprising to find a Ghaznevid playing a part in an Indian Moslem romance.\n\nThe Batavian MS. reads Ajnawi for Ghaznawi, Sahel for Husain Mandari, Nain for Husain Mandi, Patalawe for Batlawi, Birandewa for Langkawi and Bujangga Indramuda for Nakhoda Muda. The names Sahel and Nain show that the story has been confused with the tale of another dream princess, No. 24 in my edition of the Hikayat Bayan Budiman, the Malay version of the Tutti Nameh or \u201cTales of a Parrot\u201d.\n\nThis identification is corroborated by a third version of the Hikayat Nokhoda Muda in a Batavian MS. of the Hikayat Bayan Budiman (Collectie v.d. Wall 173, No. LXIX, v. Ronkel\u2019s Cat., pp. 82-84), where it actually takes the place of that story. The name of the king is \u0639\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0648\u064a of Ghazna. Two sons of a vizier \u0647\u06cc\u0627\u0633 and Husain (or \u062e\u0631 ) Mandi go to seek his dream princess and get locked up by an old fellow who mistakes their talk for lunatic raving. The old fellow\u2019s daughter, Siti Sara, sends them dainties by her maid Dalimah. They discover in Siti Sara the princess of the king\u2019s dream and one of them takes back her portrait to show. The Mantri and the Mangkubumi fetch her to marry the king. One day hunting the king kills a deer and seeing her fawns bewail her thinks of his own childlessness and sails off to the island Birama Dewa. His consort disguised as a sea-captain, under the name of Dabu Jangg\u00ebla Indra Muda, sails after him, wins at chess his mare, which becomes with foal; then passing herself off as the faithless mistress of the sea-captain whom\nshe is impersonating sleeps with the king and finally still unrecognized returns him his mare and his ring and departs. She bears a son \u0633\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0644\u0647. The mare foals. The princess has fulfilled her lord's seemingly impossible conditions that on his return he shall find a son, a foal by his mare, and his ring on his own finger. This recension as outlined in van Ronkel\u2019s catalogue, is closer to Shakespeare\u2019s version than the two former in that the episode of the ring is mentioned though apparently bungled.\n\nYet another version of the tale is given in van Ophuijsen\u2019s Maleisch Leeshock, No. 52. Sultan Mansur Shah ruler of \u2018Aznavi dreams of a girl standing at a door, holding a fried sheep\u2019s liver and dressed in red cloth (g\u0113rim). The sons of his vizier, Husain Mandari and Husain Mandi, go in quest of her. Like the youth in my version of Musang Berjanggut (J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 52, p. 122) they enquire of an old rustic for the house that has no kitchen, call a railless bridge a monkey\u2019s bridge, put on their shoes when passing through a stream and open their umbrellas in the forest shade. The rustic\u2019s daughter Siti Sarah explains their strange conduct and sends them for several days, by her maid Si-D\u0113lima, thirty cakes, seven bowls of palm-sugar, and a vessel of water, always giving the same message, \u201cThe month has thirty days, the week seven days and the tide is full and not ebbing.\u201d One day Si-D\u0113lima meets a lover, gives him four of the cakes, a bowl of sugar and a drink of water. The sons of the vizier send a return message, \u201cThe month lacked four days, the week lacked a day and the tide ebbed before its time.\u201d The maid\u2019s pilfering is thus revealed by parable to her mistress. Exactly the same episode, with 31 loaves a whole cheese a stuffed cock and a skin of wine instead of the Eastern fare, occurs in a modern Greek tale of a prince who marries a clever village girl skilled in figurative speech. (E. Legrand\u2019s \u201cReceuil de Contes Populaires Grecs, Tale IV, Paris 1881, quoted on pp. 276-7 Clouston\u2019s \u201cFlowers from a Persian Garden\u201d; cf. Parker op. cit., vol. III, pp. 112-114 for a clever girl solving enigmas). One day Siti Sarah invites the sons of the vizier to a meal and awaits them at the door clothed in red cloth, with a fried sheep\u2019s liver in her hand. They recognize her as the dream princess and despatch her picture to their king, who sends his vizier to Betalawi to fetch her. He marries her, but one day killing a fawn thinks of his childlessness and sails to Langkawi, swearing he will not return till his consort has born a son, his treasuries are full, his mare has foaled and the ring he always wears is found in the palace where he leaves his consort. As in the other versions she follows him, disguised as Nakhoda Muda (from the land of Ardap) and fulfils the hard conditions. In this excellent little version of the tale the parallel with Shakespeare\u2019s plot is exact.\nFalling in love through a dream is a common incident in Indian romance, e.g. in the Vasavadatta by Subhandu, 7th century, (Colebrooke 'Asiatic Researches' vol. X): the motive is found also in Tale XI of my edition of the Hikayat Bayan Budiman, and in that pastiche, the Hikayat Maharaja Ali.\n\nThe title Nakhoda Muda is also given to a Malay romance known too as the Hikayat Maharaja Bikrama Sakti. Of this tale there are five manuscripts at Batavia (van Ronkel's \"Catalogus\", pp. 135-138), one manuscript in the Bibliotheque Royale at Brussels, No. 21512, and a version lithographed at Singapore for the second time in 1900 A.D.: of the tale inset in the Singapore version van Ophuijsen has printed a romanized text, No. 50 in his Maleisch Leesboek. The following is an outline of the Singapore text.\n\nMaharaja Bikrama Sakti and his consort Sinar Bulan, daughter of the ruler of Juita, reign over Maha Hairan (or Mihran) Langkawi. They die, leaving a son Maharaja Johan Shah and a daughter Ratna Kemala. The son sets out to travel under the name of Nakhoda Lela Genta, comes to Rumenia (-in the MSS. Rumbia\u2014van Ronkel, p. 135) Island, where pips of the fruit from which the island takes its name, if cast to the ground, spring up immediately as trees. Taking some of the pips he sails to Beranta Indra where reigns Maharaja Dekar (= Pendekar, 'Champion'\u2014Malayalim) 'Alam, the father of prince Bikrama Indra. There he stakes self and ship on the magic property of the pips; loses his wager and is made a groom. His sister disguised as a sea-captain (Nakhoda Muda), with a female crew also disguised, goes in quest of her brother, comes to Rumenia Island, discovers the magic trees and taking pips and soil together sails on to Beranta Indra where her faithful parroquet finds her luckless brother at work as a groom. Staking self and ship on the rumenia pips, she wins and recovers her brother and his ship by sprinkling secretly the spot where the pips are to be sown with soil from their native island. After that she would sail away to Langgadura (= in the MSS. Langga Widura and Langkadura, ib., pp. 136-7) to the court of Sultan Mengindra Sakti, father of prince Dewa Laksana and princess Indra Madani, to ask the hand of the latter for her rescued brother. But the crown prince Bikrama Indra, detains her, suspecting that she is a girl and loving her, though unaware that she is actually his betrothed.\n\nHis father tells him how to test her sex but her parroquet overhears all their plots and forewarns her. She does not pick and choose her food; she gambles, heedless as to luck or loss; when jewels are offered to her, she does not select but takes a handful at random; she displays skill at cock-fighting, climbs a tree, plucks flowers carelessly fresh and faded, races on a pony, bandies quatrains, dances, jumps over ditches, and being trapped into retiring to the prince's chamber whiles away the night by telling a tale or rather two tales in one:\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nOnce a king died, bequeathing each of his three sons a treasure-house (gudang) and a magic stone (k\u00e9mala). The eldest son plots to rob the youngest of his inheritance who resists. The vizier advises them all to take the case before a neighbouring just king. The eldest and second brother travel to his court with a retinue. The youngest on foot and alone encounters a headless corpse and the tracks of a buffalo. Two men ask him if he has met their brother. \u2018No\u2019 he replies, \u2018but I saw just now the corpse of a confirmed betel-eater with a moustache and black teeth\u2019. Seeing that the corpse is headless, they infer he must have been the murderer and arrest him. Two more men come up and ask if a stray buffalo has been noticed. \u2018No\u2019 replies the prince, \u2018but I passed the tracks of a toothless old buffalo, blind in the right eye\u2019. They think he must be the thief. He is carried off to prison in the country of the righteous king, who tries the case. The prince explains that he recognized the headless corpse as that of a betel-eater, because the first finger was red and the finger-nails full of lime; his teeth would be black, because the ring finger was black with burnt coconut-shell (gerang): he must have had a moustache because his chest was hairy. As for the buffalo, he was large because his tracks were large, and blind in one eye because he fed only on one side of the path, and toothless because he failed to bite the grass clean. He is acquitted of murder and theft. The just king proclaims that whoever can settle the dispute between the three brother princes shall be made vizier. A merchant\u2019s son undertakes the task, choosing the sea-shore for the trial. The eldest prince produces two magic stones and says the third is lost. The judge snatches them, runs off and pretends to throw them into the sea. The eldest prince stands still, the two younger race to save the stones. The judge declares that indifference shows the eldest prince must have had his stone; he lies in denying he ever had one.\n\nThe night spent in story-telling, the disguised sea-captain returns to her ship. Her parroquet hears that the next test of sex is to be bathing. She arranges that all shore-boats be made unseaworthy and that her ship shall seem afire as the bathing, which is by her request to be on the shore, begins. At the cry of fire she hurries back to her ship. Other boats follow to help dolt the fire but sink. The onlookers from the shore see blazing coconut husk cast overboard, the fire douted and the captain with loosened woman\u2019s hair preparing to sail away. Bikrama Indra faints and his father distracted cries, \u201cWhat mountains do you climb? What plains do you traverse that your ears are deaf to my cries?\u201d\n\nMaharaja Johan Shah marries princess Indra Medani of Langgadura and returns home with his bride and her brother Dewa Laksana. Ninety-nine princes (as in the Hikayat Indraputra\u2014Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s \u201cThe Achinese\u201d vol. 88, p. 148) come to woo the heroine, Ratna Kemala, their boats meeting at sea \u201clike buffaloes on a plain\u201d. Her brother announces that by his father\u2019s will his\nsister is to marry the archer who can cleave a hair at the first shot. All the suitors fail except Bikrama Indra who thus wins his love:\u2014 later the suitors try to wrest her away at sea but are defeated by her husband and his friends after battle in which genies and fairies take part. Dewa Laksana marries Lela Mengerna daughter of Raja Mengindra Dewa of the country of Merta Indra. On pages 80-90 there is a spirited picture of the princess' maids frightened by the parroquet, which reminds one of the comic interludes in such Malay folk-tales as Awang Sulong and Raja Donan. (Papers on Malay Subjects; Literature II. p. 32: R. O. Winstedt).\n\nThis lithographed version would appear to correspond closely with one only of the Batavian MSS. (Collectie v. de Wall 166; van Ronkel Catalogue CXCIX, p. 137), as in other MSS. the 99 suitors do not occur, Gardan Shah Dewa of the land of Belanta Dewa taking their place and being slain in an attack on Miiran Langgawi.\n\nThe episode of the seeds which cast to the ground spring up immediately as trees must be based on the well-known mango trick of Indian conjurers. Another reference to it occurs in the III. Hang Tuah (Shellabear's ed., Singapore 1909, part III, p. 143) where the hero amuses Kishna Rayana with the trick.\n\nThis tale of Maharaja Bikrama Sakti, like the tale of Siti Sara, is evidently from an Indian source. The insetting of a long tale within which is yet another tale is in a fashion which research has shown to be specifically Indian, the sole example of such a device outside Indian influence being Ovid's Metamorphoses. (\"Encyclopaedia of Islam\", No. 4, p. 254, Alf-laila wa-laila). Other examples of such insetting of tale within tale in Malay romances translated or adapted from Indian originals are found in the Hikayat Kulita dan Damina, the Hikayat Bayan Budiman, the Hikayat Bakhtiar, the Hikayat Puspa Wiraja i(Bispu Raja).\n\nAgain the winning of a bride by skill at archery is no more Malay than are bows and arrows but it is a common episode in Indian tales and occurs in the Malay version of the Ramayana (J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 70, p. 192).\n\nSeeing so many India folktales are now becoming accessible, it is to be hoped that parallels may some day be found for the version of the Nakhoda Muda known also as the Hikayat Maharaja Bikrama Sakti with its inset tales of the three princes.\nHikayat Hang Tuah.\n\nPART I.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt., (Oxon.)\n\nNewbold in his \"British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca,\" Vol. II, page 327, comments as follows on the Hikayat:\u2014\"Valentyn thus speaks of the Hikayat Hang Tuah: 'I know not who is the author of the book, but must declare it is one of the most beautifully written I ever perused'. Mr. Crawfurd, in allusion to this remark, observes, 'This favourite of Valentyn to my taste is a most absurd and puerile production. It contains no historical fact, upon which the slightest reliance can be placed; no date whatever; and if we except the faithful picture of native mind and manners, which it unconsciously affords, is utterly worthless and contemptible'. The work, however, appears to me to merit the sweeping censure Mr. Crawfurd has bestowed on it, as little as the enthusiastic Valentyn's unqualified praise. Leyden, speaking of these historical romances, observes justly, particularly of the Hang Tuah, that, 'though occasionally embellished by fiction, it is only from them that we can obtain an outline of the Malay history and of the progress of the nation'.\" The book is peculiarly a book of British Malaya, but Newbold's comment is still after ninety years the last word of British criticism, and the Hikayat Hang Tuah has been left unheeded under what Newbold reluctantly called \"the Upas tree of British apathy.\" However a Dutch scholar G. K. Niemann has given us fragments of the Hikayat with notes in his Bloemlezing (4e druk 1892 I, p. 103, and II, pp. 54-116). R. Brons Middel has published an abbreviated edition, Hikajat Hang Tuwah, Leiden, 1893. Dr. Brandstetter has given us a useful outline in his \"Malaio-Polynesische Forschungen III,\" Luzern, 1894. Professor Dr. van Ronkel has written a paper on Hang Tuah's visit to the country of the Tamils (Shellabear, Vol. II, pp. 121-146) and discussed several difficulties (Bij. T. L. en V. K., N. I. Kon. Inst., No. 7, Vol. II, p. 311: 1904). Above all, Shellabear has published a complete text. References to MSS. and brief notices of the romance will be found in Juynboll's \"Catalogus van de Maleische en Sundaneesche Handschriften der Leidsche Universiteits Bibliotheek,\" CXVIII, pages 147-8.\n\nI give here an outline of the tale and propose in a later paper to furnish critical notes on a work of very considerable literary merit in parts, compounded by various hands of Indonesian folklore, Moslem legend, voyagers' tales, authentic history and reminiscences from such literature as the Javanese Panji cycle and the Malay version of the Ramayana (e.g. Vol. II, page 196).\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nOn the advice of astrologers, a princess, Gemala Rakua Pelinggam by name, had been put by her parents on an Island Biram Dewa. Thither to hunt came a prince from keindraan, called Sang Pertala (Perta or Perma, Niemann) Dewa. He wooed and wedded the earthly princess, who bore a son Sang Peri (Perba or Sipurba, Niemann) Dewa. That child was made king at Bukit Si-guntang Mahamern and married a girl born of the vomit of a bull that came down from heaven. The fruit of their marriage was four children, Sang Saniaka, Sang Jaya Nantaka, Sang Maniaka, Sang Satiaka. A nakhoda from Palembang saw the four boys and took them to be demigods (anak dewa). Later, chiefs came from Bentan and Singapore to Palembang to ask for one of the youths to be their king. Sang Maniaka was chosen and appointed his court.\u2014four ministers: Bendahara Paduka Raja, Ferdana Manteri, Temenggong Sri diraja, Tun Pikrama; four captains (hulubalang): Tun Bijaya Sura, Tun Bijaya diraja; four orang besar: Tun Aria, Sang Jaya, Sang Utama, Sang Derma.\n\nHang Tuah was the son of Hang Mahmud and Dang Merdu Wati. Hang Mahmud removed from his home at Sungai Duyong to Bentan. One day he dreamt that the moon fell and illumined the head of his son. So Hang Tuah was dressed in white and prayers were offered for him. When he grew big, he became a hewer of wood for the Bendahara Paduka Raja. He had four friends: Hang Jebat, Hang Lekir, Hang Kasturi, and Hang Lekawa. One day they sailed for Pulau Tinggi in a perahu lading. They were attacked by three boatloads of pirates from Siantan and Jemaja, subjects of Majapahit, under two leaders Penghulu Aria Negara and Aria Jemaja, who were bound for Palembang to raid it by order of the minister Pateh Gajah Mada of Majapahit. They beat off the pirates and sailed with ten prisoners for Singapore. The Batin of Singapore, who was sailing to Bentan with 7 boats, saved them from pursuit. Hang Tuah and his friends become pupils of a pandita, Adi Putera, whose eldest brother Pertala was an ascetic on Gunung Merda Pura in Majapahit and his next brother, Radin Aria, an officer under the Betara of that kingdom. One day Hang Tuah killed a man, who was running amuck, with his wood-chopper. Later he and his comrades saved the Bendahara from being murdered by four pengamok. The Bendahara protested that he was unaware the boys were sons of kakak Dollah, kakak Mansor, kakak Shamsu and kakak Rejeling (or Sumut Nie.) Hang Tuah finds a chintamani snake. The five youths enter the service of the Raja of Bentan.\n\nThe Ratu of Lasam in Jawa once ordered Pateh Kerma Wijaya to repair the land wasted by Radin Inu Kuripan. The Pateh went to Pachang and there falling sick sent to Lasam for his daughter Ken Semerta. The Ratu of Lasam saw and seized her. In anger Pateh Kerma Wijaya left Lasam and refusing Sang Agong's invitation to stay at Tiban passed on to Jaya Katra, where he was welcomed by the Adipati; and thence to Bentan. Now\nhaving hunted for Radin Galoh Puspa K\u00ebnhana all over Java, Radin Inu Wira Nantaja had gone to Tuban, Jaya Katra, Palembang and finally Bentan, where he was given the title of Ratu Melayu. One night after hearing of Hang Tuah's prowess, he made Pateh K\u00ebrma Wijaya relate how he had attacked Bali. The Raja of Bentan went one day with the Ratu Melaya to Pulau Ledang to hunt. A white mouse-deer turned on their dogs and the prince decided to found a settlement, calling it Malacca after a tree on the spot where Hang Tuah and his friends afterwards built his palace.\n\nHearing from Radin Daha that Radin Galoh had met Radin Imu Kuripan at K\u00ebg\u00eblang, Ratu M\u00eblaka proceeded thither by way of Tuban.\n\nThe Raja of Malacca (and Bentan) sends for his brother, Sang Jaya Nantaka, to become Raja Mnda of Malacea. They feast and get drunk. Sang Jaya Nantaka is stripped of his honours on account of his popularity with the people.\n\nBut a Tamil merchant, Perma Dewan, who has three sons, Madiran, Kadiran, Kalidan, seeing in his astrological tables that the land of Kalinga should have a prince from Si-Guntang, comes and picks out the discredited Sang Jaya Nantaka, disguised as a poor fisherman. At Kuala Nilapura they encounter and capture F\u00ebringgi ships; whose captain Sang Jaya Nantaka later ennables with the title S\u00ebtia N\u00ebgara, commissioning him to ward (payar) at sea and collect a 10% customs duty (sa-puloh suatu). Sang Jaya Nautaka rules over the land of Bijaya (or Wijaya) Pikrama, with Perma Dewan for his B\u00ebndahara, Perma Disa as Paduka Raja and two other sons of the merchant appointed Maharaja Ind\u00ebra and Maharaja Lela S\u00ebtia.\n\nNow the Raja of Malacca sent an offer of marriage to Tun Teja, daughter of B\u00ebndahara S\u00ebri Buana of Ind\u00ebrapura. But the lady declined, saying that she a sparrow should not mate with a hornbill. So he despatched Pateh K\u00ebrma Wijaya, with Hang Tuah and his comrades, to Majapahit to ask for the hand of a princess there, Radin Galoh or Mas Ayu. The embassy got a favourable answer owing to the wit of Hang Tuah in criticizing and curing of vice a horse, the present of another suitor from Kalinga. The embassy returned by way of Tuban, Jayakatra and Palembang. The Raja of Malacca then went to Majapahit, taking Hang Tuah, on whose life many attempts were made by Javanese warriors. Hang Tuah killed one assassin, Taming Sari. The B\u00ebtara of Majapahit presented him with the island of J\u00ebmaja. Hang Tuah and his poor friends became pupils of Sang P\u00ebrsanta Nila on the mountain Wirana Pura. One Sang Bimasina was sent to steal Hang Tuah's cheese. Constant efforts were made to make him drunk. Seventy assassins attacked him in vain. A champion Sang Winara S\u00ebm\u00ebntara engaged him, changing himself into a fire-fly and then a cat and later a tiger, but he fell and was buried on the mountain Isma\nGiri. Hang Tuah and his four friends retaliate, wrecking the pleasance of the B\u0113tara of Majapahit and defeating 1,000 men. Pateh Gajah Mada commissions Rangga, Pateh S\u0113rangka Dohan and Kiu T\u0113mind\u0113ra, to escort the Raja of Malacca home.\n\n(P. 215) Hang Tuah was slandered by Pateh K\u0113rma Wijaya, as having an intrigue with a girl in the Raja\u2019s Palace. The Raja condemns him to death but the B\u0113ndahara sends him away. He determines to go to Ind\u0113rapura to get the hand of Tun Teja, daughter of B\u0113ndahara S\u0113ri Buana, for his master the Raja of Malacca. Arriving there he makes friends with her duenna, Dang Rakna, who tells him the princess wants to poison herself as she does not wish to marry Panji \u2018Alam, a M\u0113gat of Tr\u0113ngganu to whom her father has betrothed her. Hang Tuah plays sepak raga with Tun Jenal, a son of B\u0113ndahara S\u0113ri Buana, and the T\u0113m\u0113ng-gong called Tun M\u0113gat. He tells them who he is but adds he will serve no master who is not descended from the royal house of Bukit Si-Guntang (p. 223). Hang Tuah asks to hear singing. The five singers say, \u201cOur tunes are not Malayan; for we are half-caste Malays (M\u0113layu kachokan) and not true Malays like the people of Malacca.\u201d Hang Tuah replies, \u201cMalacca Malays are also half-castes, mixed with Javanese from Majapahit\u201d (p. 225). One of the tunes is called \u201cS\u0113ri Rama m\u0113nambak tasek. Tasek di-tambak Langkapuri,\u201d composed by the Dato\u2019 B\u0113ndahara Paduka Raja. The B\u0113ndahara takes Hang Tuah before the Raja, who offers to give him a court office.\n\nHang Tuah afraid that he will be sent back a prisoner to Malacca, pretends he is on his way to Trengganu. He tells how the Raja of Malacca has sent two emissaries to Siam to get elephants from the Phra Chan. The Raja of Ind\u0113rapura promises him protection. He dresses entirely in white and goes to the market and buys civet, and makes a love-charm to win Tun Teja. Dang Rakna smears it on Tun Teja\u2019s bed and she falls in love with Hang Tuah. He refuses to eat with her, saying that it is tabu (pantang) for him to feed with any woman, even his own daughter (p. 252). For three nights she visits him but he discourages her advances, meaning to take her to Malacca for his Raja. The two-emissaries of the Raja of Malacca call at Ind\u0113rapura on their return. Hang Tuah puts Tun Teja and her maids on board their boat and they sail to Pulau Tinggi (p. 258). By order of the Raja of Ind\u0113rapura they are pursued by the Laksamana, the S\u0113ri Maharaja Lela, Tun Jinal and Tun Pikrama. Laksamana lets fly his 990 arrows at them and finally a storm divides the combatants. The Ind\u0113rapura chiefs return and their Raja decides to inform Panji \u2018Alam of Trengganu. Hang Tuah arrives at Malacca and with bound hands falls before the Raja, and asks for pardon, saying he has brought the \u2018arrow of love\u2019 which transfixed his highness\u2019 breast of yore and \u2018the glass of form\u2019 he has longed for. Tun Teja still wants to marry Hang Tuah, till he reads charms (pustaka), blows into her cabin and makes her loathe him. Tun\nTeja is taken to the palace. Hang Tuah is created Laksamana and given three streams (to rule). The duenna is created Paduka Mahadewi and given 100 slaves and 20 catties of gold and silver.\n\nWhen the Raja of Trengganu hears from Sang Ferdana and Sang Sura, the emissaries from Indrapura, then his son Megat Panji \u2018Alam dons his long Minangkabau creese and mounts his elephant Shah Kertas and sets out with 4,000 soldiers and 2,000 bearers to attack Malacca. He is advised to start at that propitious moment \u201cwhen the snake is worsted by the frog\u201d on the 9th day of Jamadi\u2019l-awal, a Sunday, when \u201cthe shadows are 13\u00bd paces.\u201d He goes first to Indrapura \u201ccamping across the river\u201d (p. 272). His relative, Megat Kembar \u2018Ali, interviews the Raja, and asks for audience for Megat Panji \u2018Alam. It is admitted that when anak raja come from Trengganu, they may come with drums and processions and sit beside the Raja Muda of Indrapura.\n\nNews of the intended attack reaches Malacca. The Laksamana, Tun Jebat and Tun Kasturi sail for Indrapura in the ship Mendam Berahi, calling at Pulau Tinggi. Tun Utama, Tun Bija Sura, Hang Lekir, Hang Lekiwa and 3,000 men go overland. The Laksamana rows up the river and decides to wait on the Raja of Indrapura on the morrow \u201cwhen the shadows are 7 paces (tapak), and the Geroada is worsted by the snake\u201d (p. 278). The Raja of Indrapura says that Megat Panji \u2018Alam is setting out on the 9th of Jemadi\u2019l-awal to attack Malacca. The Laksamana returns to his ship and reads his mustaka, and Tun Jebat and Tun Kasturi keep watch on one leg (beramal dengan kaki tunggal) till day-break. They set out for the Raja of Indrapura\u2019s palace, when the shadows are 12 paces. Megat Panji \u2018Alam comes and is stabbed to death on the palace steps by Hang Jebat and Hang Kasturi, who then kill Megat Kembar \u2018Ali. The Raja of Indrapura orders them to be impaled for murder before his eyes; but the Laksamana and his 40 warriors draw their daggers, march out and, taking the elephant of the murdered prince, set sail for Malacca. The Raja honours them and bestows raiment on Adipati Jemaja and 6 Batins who bore titles and the 40 warriors (p. 290).\n\nThe wife of the Raja of Malacca, Radin Mas Ayu, was with child and longed for the fruit of a coconut palm a nyior gading which grew in the middle of Malacca beside a melaka tree. The palm was thin and eaten by fire in the middle; no one dared to climb it and it would be unlucky to fell it. Hang Tuah climbed the palm (p. 292). The princess, now called Radin Galoh, bears a son, Radin Bahar. Ambassadors are sent by way of Toban to inform his grandfather the Betara of Majapahit. Patch Gajah Mada receives them and the Betara sends 40 maids and 40 youths and a tezi horse to his grand-child. Only Laksamana dares ride the horse.\n\nRadin Mas Ayu bore another son, Radin Bajau. One day a horse belonging to the boys fell into a midden. Wrapped in 7\ncloths Hang Tuah rescues the animal and then bathes 7 times and is bathed by the Raja from 7 jars of scented water (p. 299).\n\nHang Tuah remonstrates with the Raja for neglecting Radin Mas Ayu in favour of Tun Teja. The B\u0113tara hearing his daughter is neglected sends Rangga and Barat K\u0113tika to Malacca to enquire why his son-in-law never sends embassies to Majapahit. Hang Tuah with Hang J\u0113bat and Hang Kasturi are sent. The B\u0113tara and Pateh Gajah Mada try in vain to slay him. The letter from the Raja of Malacca is escorted on an elephant to the p\u0113seban, where Radin Aria reads it. Various champions P\u0113rwira Jafra, Samirang, Sangga Ningsun and bands of 40 and 7,000 warriors are set to steal Hang Tuah\u2019s weapons and to kill him but all fail. He returns to Malacca with a letter from the B\u0113tara to his Raja inviting him to go to Majapahit. Three vessels, the Siru\u2019l-\u2018alamin, M\u0101ndam B\u0113rahi, and Maratu\u2019s-safa are prepared. T\u0113m\u0113nggong, Maharaja S\u0113tia, Tun Utama, Sang Raja, Tun Raja \u2018d\u012braja are left to guard the harbour; Sang Raja and Tun Bija Sura to guard Bukit China; Tun Utama in charge of the palace. The Raja takes leave of his wives. Radin Bahar runs up to his father, holds his hand and begs him to bring him a prancing white pony (p. 35).\n\nThey sail, stay three days with the Adipati of Palembang and thence go to Jaya Katra, and then sail on to stay with the Sang Agong of Toban. Radin Aria is sent to escort the Raja from Toban. As he passes through the street of Majapahit, the people whisper in pity that he is going to be killed for having another wife besides the B\u0113tara\u2019s daughter. On an elephant called Indera Chita he goes to the palace, Karang Daru\u2019s-Salam, prepared for him. The next day 40 warriors are sent to create a disturbance in the town, which Hang Tuah is asked to quell. He quells it. Then a warrior P\u0113tala Bumi is sent to slay him. P\u0113tala Bumi transforms himself into a cat and his comrade Barat K\u0113tika into a rat and so they enter Hang Tuah\u2019s room; then P\u0113tala Bumi becomes in turn a stump, a dog and a tiger (whereupon Hang Tuah becomes a bigger tiger), and finally a raksasa, in which shape he is sorely wounded. Commending his son, K\u0113rtala Sari, who is away in Daha, to the care of the B\u0113tara, he prepares to slay every one in the compound, but is himself killed by Hang Tuah.\n\nThe B\u0113ndahara Paduka Raja despatches Tun Utama to Majapahit to say that Radin Bahar is sick from longing for his father. The Raja of Malacca returns home. M\u0113rga Paksi and six warriors are sent from Majapahit to capture Malacca and kill Hang Tuah: they hide on Bukit China outside the town, slaughter a stray buffalo and steal a jar of spirit from the town; nightly they rob and ravish. Hang Tuah promises to kill them within seven days. Dressed in black and pretending to be a liberated gaol-bird he carries a sack of rice and two irang of spirit on his shoulder, waylays them and becomes an accomplice of the gang. He helps them to rob the houses of the B\u0113ndahara and T\u0113m\u0113nggong and\nfinally breaks into the Raja's palace and carries off eight chests of treasure. He learns all the robbers' magic arts, then drugs and kills them.\n\nAll the officers of the court hate Hang Tuah and tells Pateh K\u00ebrma Wijaya he is a \"a fence eating the crop,\" an officer of the court who seduces the Raja's concubines. Hang Tuah went to the ulu of Malacca and was fishing with a cast-net, when Hang Jebat and Hang Kasturi arrived to recall him. The raja orders the B\u00ebndahara to slay him and confers his creese of office on Hang J\u00ebbat. The B\u00ebndahara hides Hang Tuah in an orchard seven days' journey up-country, where a religious teacher Shaikh Mansur prophesies that in 20 days he will return to Malacea.\n\nThe Raja spoils Hang J\u00ebbat who takes liberties in the palace. The Raja styles him Paduka Raja, the title of the B\u00ebndahara's house. He is rude to courtiers and runs loose among the Raja's women. At last the Raja detects Tun J\u00ebbat's madness and removes to the B\u00ebndahara's house. Hang J\u00ebbat sits on the ruler's mat, bathes in his jar, wears the royal raiment and sleeps on the royal couch (p. 75). Pateh K\u00ebrma Wijaya leads an assault upon the traitor in the deserted palace but fails. Hang Kasturi, Hang L\u00ebkir and Hang L\u00ebkiwa then attack but fail. The T\u00ebnggong attacks. Hang J\u00ebbat leaps down like a tiger, his blade flashing like a volcano in eruption (p. 80). The Raja sends for the Laksamana's son Tun Kadim and adopts him, repenting of killing his father. \"If Hang Tuah were alive, I should feel as though my revered ancestor on Mt. Si-Guntang were restored to life.\" The B\u00ebndahara hints (di-kilat-kilatkan) he is alive. Tun Pikrama and Tun Kasturi go and fetch Hang Tuah. He gives a knife to Shaikh Mansur and the shaikh gives him a shabby praying mat (musalla). Hang Tuah is welcomed by the Raja. Stiff for lack of practice of fencing, he is massaged for five days. He cannot find a creese that suits him. Hang Kasturi enters the palace and is allowed by Hang J\u00ebbat to get (boleh p. 91) a creese, an heirloom from Mt. Si-Guntang. For three days the two weapons selected by Hang Tuah are sharpened. At midday when the low sound of a single drum shows that Hang J\u00ebbat sleeps, Hang Tuah enters the palace. Hang J\u00ebbat stabs the 700 girls in the palace and their blood runs through the floor of the palace like rain. Hang Tuah protests. The traitor replies, \"Cracked by a pounding or a sweeping blow, crockery still becomes a shard (di-litek b\u00eblah, di-palu pun b\u00eblah, t\u00ebmbekar juga akan sudah-nya). I'll sin thoroughly (sa-pala-pala nama jahat: jangan k\u00ebpalang).\" Hang Tuah leaps up into the palace. They fight, eyeing one another \"like hawks,\" \"spinning round like wheels,\" \"the lunges as swift as a boomerang\" (baling-baling). The crowds gets under the palace and stab at Hang J\u00ebbat's feet but endanger Hang Tuah too. The two fighters stop and get four large brass trays and lay them down. Standing on the trays they renew the fight. They talk. The traitor says his behaviour was due to the injustice done to Hang Tuah. Now he has fallen from\npride like a \"bulb crushed by the weight of its bloom\" (rosak bawang di-timpa jambak-nya). Hang Tuah replies with the proverb \"Better death with honour than life with shame, so that one may enter heaven.\" (Baik mati dengan nama yang baik; jangan hidup dengan nama yang jahat, supaya masok shurga jemah).\n\nHang Jebat asks Hang Tuah to adopt his unborn child, if a boy, offspring of him and a waiting-maid Dang Baru. Hang Tuah snatches his own creese from his opponent and gives him another. Hang Jebat's creese gets stuck into a tray as he lunges. Hang Tuah stabs him. The crowd starts to mount the palace but seeing Jebat still alive flees in panic; \"some fell on their faces, some in a sitting posture, some broke their legs, others their arms, others their backs; some fell on their backs, some broke their noses, others their foreheads. When each got home, his wife asked, 'What broke your nose, father of Awang?' kissing him and exclaiming, 'Oh! it must hurt!'\" (p. 105). Jebat leaps down from the palace and slays every one he meets for three days, while Hang Tuah has retired into his house and sits in seclusion, refusing to speak. On the fourth day, as Hang Tuah is going to the river to bathe, he sees Jebat stabbing at people in the market, and calls out to him to cease. Jebat comes and falls at Hang Tuah's feet. Hang Tuah takes him to his house and gives betel. Jebat renews his request that Hang Tuah shall adopt his unborn child, and after that begs that his bandages be undone. He dies on Hang Tuah's lap. The Raja has his corpse placed in the middle of the main gate and after seven days hanged on the main road. Laksmana Hang Tuah is high in royal favour, and bears himself humbly.\n\nNow the S\u00ebri Betara of Majapahit and Patch Gajah Mada desired revenge for the death of P\u00e9tala Bumi and the six swash-bucklers killed by Hang Tuah at Bukit China. They send P\u00e9tala Bumi's son, K\u00ebrtala Sari, who has just devastated Daha. He mixes with the Javanese colonists, Patch K\u00ebrma Wijaya's men, and perpetrates a series of robberies. Hang Tuah protects the palace by hanging a row of spears that move and lunge all round it.\n\nHang Tuah lies like a corpse in the middle of the market and as Kertala Sari passes jumps up and stabs him. He mutilates the robber (di-hiris-nya p\u00e9sawat K\u00ebrtala Sari) and takes his creese (p. 118). So he proves that he killed the robber against others who finding the corpse cut off ears and head and hand and claimed to have done the deed.\n\nThe Raja sends Hang Tuah, who can speak Tamil, with Tun Kasturi, whom he makes Maharaja Stia, to the land of the Klings, Bijaya Nigrana. A royal letter to the ruler is escorted down to Hang Tuah's boat. After seven days' sail they reach the island Biram Dewa, \"looking like an elephant,\" and go ashore. There he meets the Prophet Khidhir who foretells his safe return from this embassy to India and from a later embassy to China. The prophet also tells him to take seeds from a tree in the island which will burgeon and flower and fruit as soon as planted i.e. perform\nthe mango trick (p. 124). They reach the land of the Klings. The port-officer takes them to a merchant Nala Sang Guna who regales them with dainties made in Nagapatam fashion (p. 129), gives them anchorage at the spot reserved for the Franks, and announces their arrival to the king, Kishna Rayana (p. 130). The king summons his champions from Malabar and Kandi. Hang Tuah and his followers go several days' journey up to the palace.\n\nThe gates of Bijaya Nigara were painted with incidents from the stories of Sri Rama and the five Pandavas. And there were thousands of idols and a temple. Laksamana gets his interview with Kishna Rayana (? = Krisnaraja, v. Ronkel) and speaks the Nigrana language which only princes and ministers know:\u2014he learnt it from a religious pundit (l\u0113bai) at Majapahit. Kishna Rayana complains that when at Malacca he got interviews only with the B\u0113ndahara and (?) a fisherman (si-p\u0113ngail). Hang Tuah gives the wife of Nila Sang Guna (? = Narasinggan, v. R.) medicine to enable her to bear a child. 70,000 Franks, and thousands of soldiers from Malabar and Khalilat (? = Pulicat v. R.) wait on Kishna Rayana. Laksamana shows his horsemanship. Kishna Rayana declares he will visit the house of Nala Sang Guna but privately forbids all people to sell him firewood. Hang Tuah solves the problem by bidding him pour oil on bales of his cloth and so cook fare for royalty. Hang Tuah does the mango trick (p. 143). He kills a swashbuckler. They visit a temple (rumah b\u0113rhal\u0101 m\u0113njadi s\u0113ndiri). Captains of vessels and merchants who may lack capital, borrow gold from the god of the temple, Sang Brahma (p. 146) and, on pain of disaster for breach of faith, repay it with interest. Hence the wealth of the temple. In it, too, was a reservoir for oil for its lamps. They visit an alms-house (balai d\u0113rma) where the poor are fed.\n\nKishna Rayana sends Hang Tuah on an embassy to China. Trade with China brings tenfold profit (\u010dsa jadi sa-puloh). Hang Tuah is to declare one of his ships belongs to Nala Sang Guna, so that it may escape the heavy port duties (p. 148). After two months Hang Tuah reaches that port of China called Bakang Hitam (p. 149) and is ordered to anchor upstream at the place reserved for the Franks.\n\nHang Tuah presents his credentials to the four viziers, Wang Kam Seng, Pang Seng, Lu Ti and Sam Pi Pat. There were seven forts of white stone with doors of brass and gold, and all the houses of the people were dressed with white stone. The emperor grants them an interview. Hang Tuah eating beans contrives to lift his head to see the emperor seated in the mouth of a bejewelled golden dragon (p. 154). Hang Tuah sees thousands of people collecting the tears of a large idol, the father of all China, who weeps to see the sins of his children; bathe in his tears and sins are washed away. With rich presents and a letter for the Raja of the Klings Hang Tuah departs. At the mouth of the estuary 40 Portuguese ships attack the Malays. By reading a charm Hang Tuah stops\nthe fire of their guns, and defeats the ships all save three which sailed away. \"There was one big tall captain, very brave. He cut at the Laksamana with a shaky arm. The Laksamana cut him in two\" (p. 158).\n\nHang Tuah reaches the land of the Klings. Thanks to his herbs the wife of Nala Sang Guna has conceived, and her husband piles gold and silver round Hang Tuah up to his neck.\n\nHang Tuah returns to Malacca. The S\u00ebri B\u00ebtara of Majapahit had died and Pateh Gajah Mada asks for Radin Bahar to succeed him. Hang Tuah escorts him. On his return a Brunei raja, Adipati Solok, sails with fifteen ships given by his father Adipati Agong, to the cape of Jaya-Katra, called Tanjong Kerawang and there waylays the Malacca fleet. Hang Tuah shoots one arrow that breaks the mast and one that breaks the rudder of the Adipati's boat. He captures him. The Raja of Malacca sends Hang Tuah to escort Adipati Solok back to Brunei. The Raja of Brunei sends the Raja of Malacca 3 pikul of camphor, 500 kendaka each worth a takil, 10 blow-pipes mounted with gold, 200 kodi of mats (likar pachar) and 3 Brunei slaves, with 90 slaves and camphor for Hang Tuah (p. 174).\n\nHang Tuah is sent to Siam for elephants. He reaches Ujong Salang and lands at Patani, whose great gate is adorned with a carved dragon. He comes to Siam where Awi Phra Klong tells him he must crawl on his knees into the presence of the Phra Chau unattended. He refuses and is allowed to present himself in Malay style. Viziers, captains and court officers (abu-abuan, ukun-ukun, umbum-umbum) receive him. Hang Tuah speaks Siamese fluently. Hang Tuah fences with a Japanese bravo and kills him and five of his followers. Two survivors flee to Kuala Kemboja. Hang Tuah remarks on the broken coinage (benda yang pechah belah) and persuades Phra Chau to substitute the shells he got from Brunei (kendaka). He is sent home with six elephants for his Raja and four for himself. The two surviving Japanese attack his ships but Hang Tuah's magic lets only smoke issue from their guns and makes their swords drop. Hang Tuah presents the elephants to his Raja. The largest is called Podi Manikam and another Permata Selan.\n\nRadin Mas Ayu bears a daughter, Puteri Gunong Ledang; Tun Teja bears Sultan Mahmud and Sultan Muhammad. The Raja of Malacca sends Tun Rakna 'diraja and Tun Maharaja 'diraja to Ceylon to buy precious stones.\n\nHang Tuah opens a settlement for his Raja at Mt. Lingga.\n\nThe king of Ceylon sends his son Raja Chulan to Malacca in a ship so large that betel-trees and vines were planted on its decks with hundreds of fighting-cocks:\u2014when they crowed, the ship listed. Having been welcomed at Malacca, he asks leave to sail to Tr\u00e9nggama, where he worsts the cocks trained by Pa Si-Molong, the Raja's trainer. The Raja puts out the eyes of his\ntrainer and retires sulking to Pulau Sakti. He promises the trainer four mistresses if he can find a cock which will defeat Raja Chulan\u2019s birds. \u2018I cannot see them\u2019 says Pa Si-Molong amid laughter (p. 194). He buys a fowl tied with a string of molong, which crows in his hand and tells the Raja it is a cock that cannot be conquered. The Raja dreams that the ships of Raja Chulan are devoured by a geroada, and takes his fighting-cocks to Pulau Sakti confident of victory. The leg of his fowl is broken, when Pa Si-Molong describes him as \u2018The prince with the iron crutch\u2019; his wing is broken and droops like \u2018A sail that waits the wind\u2019; his crop is pierced and the rice falls out of it\u2014he is \u2018an overladen ship being lightened\u2019; his thigh is wounded\u2014he is \u2018a prince wearing a sword\u2019; his head is wounded\u2014he is \u2018a prince that has been cupped.\u2019 Raja Chulan\u2019s victorious bird flies to his ship whereupon it sinks with its 90,000 soldiers; and thence he flies to the palace of the Raja of Tr\u00e9ngganu, which is set on fire and burnt with all the houses in the port (p. 196).\n\nUrged by the princess of Gunong Ledang the Raja of Malacca sends the Laksamana with 70 ships to conquer Tr\u00e9ngganu. He brings captive the princes S\u00e9ganda Jaya Leka, daughter of the B\u00e9ndahara, and M\u00e9gat Ma\u2019asum son of M\u00e9gat K\u00e9mbar \u2018Ali. Sultan Muhammad, son of the Raja of Malacca, is married to princess S\u00e9ganda Jaya Leka and given the throne of B\u00e9ntan. Sultan Mahmud is married to the daughter of the B\u00e9ndahara of Tr\u00e9ngganu (?), and reigns at Lingga.\n\nInd\u00e9rapura is attacked by todak fish (p. 206). Hang Kadim son of Hang Jebat advises a wall of banana stems. Hang Kadim is entitled Sang Si-Tuah. The T\u00e9m\u00e9uggong is jealous and accuses him of an intrigue with a girl in the palace and he is beheaded. Hang Kamar, a Malacca man trading there, reports the execution to the Raja of Malacca who sends Laksamana to conquer Ind\u00e9rapura. Laksamana anchors at Pulau Tinggi and thence sails up to Ind\u00e9rapura where he exacts tribute and leads captive 1608 persons, the families of those concerned in the death of Hang Kadim.\n\nThe Raja of Malacca and all his house sail for Singapore. On the way, while he is looking at a golden-scaled fish, his crown falls into the sea (p. 219). Laksamana dives for it, fights a white crocodile but fails to recover the crown and loses his creese.\n\nDang Manila and Dang Ch\u00e9ralo, who had escaped from China, reach Manila and complain to the Portuguese Governor, who gets the King of Portugal to send 40 ships against Malacca. Two boatfuls of Sakai fishermen capture 10 Portuguese and, by order of their Batin headman at Bentan, report the intended attack of an \u2018Armada\u2019 at Malacca. Laksamana, though sick, repels the invaders. The \u201cCaptain Governor\u201d is killed and Dang Shala badly wounded. They return to Portugal. Laksamana is wounded but recovers.\nThe Sakai always catch fish near the sunken crown of the Raja of Malacca, because they float up to avoid its brightness. The Raja is always sick after the loss of his crown and Laksamana after the loss of his creese.\n\nThe Laksamana is sent to Rum to buy cannon. He arrives at Aceh and meets Sultan Silahu\u2019d-din (who was deposed in 1539 A.D., R. O. W.). Thence he sails to Pulau Dewa and the sea of Mukha. He comes to Juddah where is the tomb of Siti Hawa (Eve). He goes ashore and the port officer takes them to Malik Astur, who takes them to Mecca. At that time 886 A.H. (= 1481 A.D.), Sharif Ahmad son of Zainul-abidin ruled Mecca, and another son Sharif Baharu\u2019din ruled Medina\u2014both under the suzerainty of Rome. On the way the Laksamana meets Nabi Khidlir, who gives him a flask of water wherewith to moisten lips and ears so that he may speak and understand foreign tongues (p. 240). Deputations from Egypt and Syria bring the sacred carpet to Mecca. The Malay visitors go to all the sacred places (p. 242) and to Shaikh Jamalu\u2019d-din, keeper of the Prophet\u2019s tomb.\n\nThey reach Istanbul where the port-officer takes them to Ibrahim Khakan, who describes the glories of Istanbul, the royal garden called Taman Ghairat Berahi, with its gate Naga Indera Paksi, its river Dar\u2019u-l-ashikin, the mountain Jabalu\u2019l-\u2018ala, its river adorned with flower-pots called Rambat Kamali and stone banks called Tebing Singga Safa, its rock Tanjong Indera Bangsa where the Sultan sits to fish, the island Singga Marmar, with its lake Singga Tasek Kunkuma; the banks of the river called Ratna Chuacha and Sembeka, its market-place Medan Hairani, and its orchards full of Malay fruits (pp. 252-8). They are taken to the four Mangkubumis and lastly into the presence of the Sultan. They return with rich presents and guns (bedil), reaching Malacca after a voyage of four months.\n\nThe princess of Gunong Ledang is installed ruler of Malacca (p. 279); Tun Mat, son of the Bendahara, is made Bendahara Paduka Raja; Tun Karim, son of the Temenggong, is styled Temenggong Sri Seraja; and Tun Kadim, son of the Laksamana, gets the title of Laksamana.\n\nThe Raja of Malacca offers a reward to whosoever will consent to be buried alive and bring him news from the grave. Laksamana consents and on the way gives a cake (apam) to a poor dervish (p. 282). He is buried with a string to pull and communicate with the Raja who holds the other end. He pulls and the grave is opened whereupon the Laksamana is found naked with a broken pot (belanga) in his hand. He tells how two fiery volcanoes attacked him in the grave and he kept them off with the pot he found in his hand and how the fire passed the chipped pot and burnt his clothes.\n\nThe Bendahara retires to Tanjong Keling, the Temenggong to Tanjong Tuan and the Laksamana to Tanjong Jugera, where he lived a hermit with his teacher, a Hadramaut Shaikh, who had\ncome to Malacca from Aceh. All sailors fired a shot and cast a wooden spear in honour of them, when they passed the Tanjong; failure to do this entailed storms (p. 285). The Ruler of Malacca wandered about as a dervish. One day he was given a gourd, whereupon he took a bite of it and carried the rest with him. The Prophet Khidhir, disguised as a youth, tells him he is carrying not a gourd but a skull. He opens his bundle, finds a skull and faints. A voice tells him that dervishes trust in God and do not carry food. The Raja wandered on and was never again heard of. The princess of Gunong Ledang ruled Malacca.\n\nA Portuguese ship came from Manila and touched at Malacca. Next year another ship came and bought as much land as an oxhide would cover, and the captain cut it into five strips and built a large warehouse which he equipped with cannon. In the night he fired the cannon and destroyed Malacca. The Princess of Gunong Ledang fled and came to a great forest near the land of the Bataks, who made her their queen.\n\nBendahara Tun Mat opened Johore. Sultan Mahmud left Bentan and ruled over Johore.\n\nThe Dutch with the help of the Johore Malays ousted the Portuguese from Malacca. The gold leaf on which the treaty was made is still in the possession of the Dato' Paduka Raja of Johore, who led the attack on Malacca.\n\nTun Tuah is not dead. He is a saint and lives near the source of the Perak river, where he is prince of all Bataks and jungle folk. Sometimes folk meet him and enquire if he wants a wife. He replies, \"I do not wish to marry again.\"\nSungai Ujong.\n\nBy R. J. Wilkinson, C.M.G.\n\nPART I.\n\nThe Dato' Klana Putra, territorial chief of Sungai Ujong, ranks as the premier chief of the Negri Sembilan, though there is nothing to show how he obtained this precedence. He possesses a modern title and an ancient chieftaincy: as far back as the fifteenth century there were rulers of Sungai Ujong, who bore the title of Penghulu Mauteri and acknowledged the Sultan of Malacca as their overlord. In those days the country was an appanage of the Bendaharas of Malacca, and the chiefs sent to govern it were members or vassals of that distinguished house. The seal of the Rulers of Rembau quotes as its authority \"the grace of the Bendahara Sri Maharaja\", apparently with the date 1707 A.D.; that of the Dato' Bandar quotes Sultan Abdul-Jalil III, 1715; that of the Dato' of Jelebu quotes Sultan Abdul-Jalil V (who flourished in 1758); that of the Dato' of Johol is dated 1778. There is the contemporary evidence of the \"Malay Annals\" as to the political position of Sungai Ujong in 1612 A.D. and as to the semi-mythical Dato' Sekudai. Finally in the early days of Sungai Ujong, descent was not traced through the female line. So one may brush aside the claim of some Negri Sembilan chiefs that they govern their territories by virtue of descent in the female line from the aboriginal Batins, the primeval owners of the country.\n\nAccording to one story the origin of the Biduanda is ascribed to a Batin Sri Alam who met a walking tree-trunk near the waters of the River Langat. He captured and kept it in captivity till it laid eggs, forty-four in number. He buried the eggs till they were hatched, when there emerged forty-four children, the ancestors of the Biduanda. Batin Sri Alam brought up these children and supplied them with garments of bark-cloth to cover their nakedness. When they grew up, twenty-two of the children crossed to Sumatra and colonized the coast as far as the borders of the Batak country: the remaining twenty-two stayed in the Peninsula and became Biduanda or Rayat\u2014the latter word being said to mean \"sons of the soil\". Another story explains that every man falls from heaven, either on his feet as a raja, or on his seat as a Batin, or on his face as a slave. Batin Sri Alam rose from his seat and went round the world ruling the slaves\u2014the Bedouin in Arabia, the biduan in India and the Biduanda in Malaya, the three words being translated \"serf\"! Folklore and etymology are, of course, irreconcilable enemies.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nBut these legends of the Creation are not the only tales connected with Batin Sri Alam. He is said to have led an expedition into Jelebu. There he found trays of food waiting for him, served up and ready to eat, but with no one present to explain whence the food came. Batin Sri Alam did not enquire; he ate the food and named the place Kuala Dulang, the place of plates, as a record of his gratitude. He showed less thankfulness in his next adventure. The Muhammadans of Jelebu did their best to bring Batin Sri Alam round to their religion. They induced him to repeat the Confession of Faith; but when the mudin explained the uses of the penyepit, Batin Sri Alam vanished. One rumour has it that he reappeared on Mount Si-Guntang Mahameru; another that he disappeared into the caverns of Kota Glanggi in Pahang. But whatever his fate, he was never seen again by the Moslems who effected his conversion or by the land he did so much to people.\n\nNext in this aboriginal genealogy comes Batin Berchanggai Besi whose wife was Berduri Besi and whose brother-in-law was Ketopong Besi\u2014the Iron-clawed Chief, with his Iron-quilled wife, and her Iron-helmeted Brother. The legend however adds that they were primitive people, unacquainted with the use of iron or even of fire, and that they ate their food raw. One day when hunting they found a fairy-child hidden in the cleft of a rock. They adopted her though she showed her real origin by declining to partake of the bestial repasts of the Sakai and by living on a diet of fruits and shoots, till the prince of destiny appeared and won her as his bride. That prince was the Sultan of Johor. He saw her in a dream and traced her by weighing the river-waters and selecting the lightest. A son of this marriage was the Bendahara Sekudai, the reputed ancestor of the rulers of Sungai Ujong.\n\nTradition traces a relationship between this Batin Berchanggai Besi, and the legendary figures associated with the origin of the other States: Dato' Jelundong, founder of Jelebu; Nenek Kerban, founder of Johol; To' Tukul and To' Landas, founders of Klang. The two first were the Batin's sisters, while To' Tukul and To' Landas derived their titles from the hammer and the anvil with which they rendered to Batin Berchanggai Besi the service that Batin Sri Alam vanished to avoid. So invulnerable are these tough old aborigines, according to Malay belief, that circumcision is a matter of difficulty.\n\nBatin Berchanggai Besi was the father of To' Dara Derani whose daughter, Batin Na-ribu Jaya or Sibu Jaya, married the Dato' Sekudai. It is related of these last two ladies that they fled in terror from Sang Kelambai who was striding through the country, turning all he met into stone. \"Why flee\"? asked an Acehnese saint who lived at Sungai Udang between Pangkalan Kempas and Permatang Pasir, \"I have a charm that no Kelambai can face. A candle will keep him away.\" So candles were lit nightly; the population was saved from a stony fate; and the place is called Pengkalan Dian to this day. The sceptic may see\nthe petrified properties of this ancient saint, his sword, his stocks, his spoon and his buckler lying round his tomb at Pengkalan Kempas.\n\nIn those early years the seat of power was not where it is now. Ching, Beranang, Pajam, Gibok, Kechau, Langlang, Langkap Berjuntai, Lubok Bergoyang, Subang Hilang, Merbok Kerawang, Tunggul Si-jaga, are the places to which tradition gives importance. Few of them are to be found on maps of the State; some lie outside the Negri Sembilan in the Kajang district of Selangor. Doubtless they were old Biduanda communities. The names of one or two are explained in the native way so common to folklore: *Tunggul Si-jaga* was the place where a small Bugis force frightened the people out of the country by putting torches on tree-slumps and creating the impression that they were a huge camp surrounded by thousands of sentries; *Subang Hilang* was a place where a Biduanda princess lost her earring. All that we can infer is that the ancient Biduanda or Belanda tribe\u2014now represented by a few Mantra in Malacca and a few wandering Kenaboi in the Jelebu mountains\u2014was once important in that part of the Negri Sembilan which lies between the modern settlements of Kajang and Seremban.\n\nThe following is the genealogy of these early heroes as adapted and arranged by tradition.\n\n**Batin Sri Alam.**\n\n```\nBatin Berchanggai Besi (of Sungai Ujong.)\nTo' Jelundong (founder of Jelebu.)\nNenek Kerbau.

Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nThe name Sungai Ujong is modern and is due to the association of Malay States with river-basins. There is no River \"Ujong\". Old traditions speak of the State as S\u0113mujong; the \"Malay Annals\" of 1612 A.D. call it S\u0113ngang Ujong; ancient books of navigation refer to it by variants of the same old name. What the real name was, is uncertain.\n\nAll accounts\u2014even those of the aboriginal Blandas\u2014agree that a Dato' K\u0113lambu was the first to \"open\" Sungai Ujong. A place has been found for him in the pedigrees as a son of the Bendahara Sekudai; and the Rulers of Sungai Ujong who claim him as an ancestor still preserve his tomb as a place of pilgrimage. Tradition tells us also that the Dato's name was Muhammad Tumbu and that he was known as To' J\u0113bat because of his brother To' Musang, and as Dato' K\u0113lambu because he lived at Kuala Sungai K\u0113lambu.\n\nThe genealogy, more regular than ever, is as follows:\n\nBendahara Sekudai.\n\n(m. Batin Sibu Jaya.)\n\n| Md. Tumbu. | To' Musang. | To' S\u0113m\u0113rga. | To' S\u0113ri Mani. |\n|------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|\n| (m. To' Chumbu a (m. To' Jerumbu, (m. L\u0113bai (m. a Terachi Batin's daughter.) sister of To' Mamat, an man and Chumbu.) Ach\u00e9hinese.) adopted.) |\n\nTo' Dara Mudek. m. Penghulu S\u0113lat. Dato' K\u0113ling. Dato' Anduleka Manduleka.\n\nthe Klana family. the Bandar family. the Anduleka Manduleka family.\n\nIn spite of its artificial appearance this pedigree has points of interest. It suggests that the people who invented it were people who gave little heed to Sumatran law and custom. To' Dara Mudek and Penghulu S\u0113lat belonged to the same uterine family (p\u0113rnt); their marriage would be incest according to Minangkabau custom: they were the children of two brothers and as such within the prohibited degrees of affinity. They were the children of two sisters; and, as such, again within the prohibited degrees. Such marriages are common in Peninsular Malaya but would be triply incestuous according to Minangkabau adat. The later Negri Sembilan Malay, follower of Sumatran matriarchal law, has invented these traditions of descent from Sakai princesses but has omitted to be consistent. In the days of the Dato' Sekudai it was the male line that was important. Not till the days of Engku Sabun, hardly a century ago, was the adat p\u0113rpateh introduced into Sungai Ujong.\nDato' Sekudai flourished in the first half of the seventeenth century and possessed two married children when the \"Malay Annals\" were written. Sungai Ujong tradition would have us believe that he wedded Batin Sibu Jaya in the presence of Sultan Abdul-Jalil II (1639-1673), and brought up in Sungai Ujong a second family who elected to be known as To' Musang and To' Jebat\u2014\"the Polecat\" and \"the Skunk\"\u2014instead of bearing the title of Tun by which members of the great Bendahara family were known. This is hard to accept. If the Dato' Kelambu did \"open\" Sungai Ujong he must have lived long before the seventeenth century, and been confused with some other person\u2014possibly a real Muhammad Tumbu or To' Jebat\u2014who obtained from the Bendahara Sekudai a hereditary right to the ancient title of Penghulu Mant\u00e9ri. Anyhow from this time we get a succession of Rulers of Sungai Ujong:\n\nPenghulu Selat;\nPenghulu Kadim;\nPenghulu Pandak;\nPenghulu Chantek;\nPenghulu Rumah Gedang (or Rumah Bertalah).\n\nThey are names and little more. Tradition varies as regards the order in which they ruled; it tells nothing of their relationship to one another; it is uncertain if Penghulu Chantek and Penghulu Rumah Gedang may not have been one and the same person; and it cannot tell us if the names\n\nPenghulu hilang di-Diwa,\nPenghulu hilang di-Gayan,\nPenghulu hilang di-Danau Buaya,\n\nrepresent additional rulers or are descriptions of those already mentioned.\n\nIn all this mass of doubt there are one or two grains of definite evidence. It is said that the Bugis invasion of Sungai Ujong took place in the days of Penghulu Chantek; that the first Dato' Klana (Badur) was the son of Penghulu Chantek; that the second Klana (Leha) was the son of Penghulu Rumah Gedang; and that it was in the time of this second Klana the Linggi settlers came. It is said also that the first Klana (Badur) was installed during the lifetime of his father; but this may be an etymological theory to explain the word Putera in the Klana's title. This evidence does not take us far. The Bugis invasion may have occurred at any date between 1725 and 1770 A.D.; and the coming of the Liuggi settlers at any time between 1775 and 1790 A.D. One fact of importance stands out, namely the acquisition of the title of Kelana Putera by the ruling house of Sungai Ujong. Who conferred it? When was it conferred? And why? Tradition sometimes ascribes the title to Sultan Abdul-Jalil II who was far too early (1639-1671 A.D.) ; at other times to Raja Melewar (1773-1795 A.D.), who was\nperhaps a little too late. An impression of the seal of an old Klana might settle the point. But no such impression is obtainable. The Dato' Penghulu of Jelebu and the Dato' Bandar of Sungai Ujong obtained seals from Johor,\u2014the second in 1715 from Abdul-Jalil III, the first about 1739 from Abdul-Jalil V. The latter prince, who was only a Regent, was so lavish with his treaties, seals and dignities that one would attribute to him the bestowal of the title of Dato' Klana, if it were a Malay title. But it is a Bugis dignity. The first Bugis Yantuan Muda of Riau bore the title of Klana Jaya Putra. Significant is the local assertion that the rank of the Dato' Klana is that of a Raja Muda. Is it a coincidence that the ruler of Sungai Ujong bears the title and rank of a Klana Jaya Putera, Yantuan Muda of Riau? The evidence is in favour of the belief it was from the Bugis chiefs of Riau that the old Penghulu Manteri obtained his higher title.\n\nThere was, it is true, the Bugis invasion of Sungai Ujong: they advanced as far as Pantai, where the site of their fort is still shown opposite the site of the house of the ex-Klana Lela Stia. But tradition says that at the time of that invasion the Penghulu of Sungai Ujong was not in the country, but at Singapore, where he had gone \"to see the swordfish attack the island\". Even a Batin would hardly go to Singapore on such a fool's errand. It would appear almost that the Klana was serving in the ranks of his country's enemy.\n\nDato' Klana Badur was followed by Dato' Klana Leha whose reign was signalized by the settlement of the Linggi and Labu districts. The Linggi settlers came because the Dato' of Rembau refused to permit them to live under their own law, the adat temenggong, and insisted on their adopting the matriarchal law of Minangkabau. This incident corroborates tradition that the adat perpateh was not adopted in Sungai Ujong till a later date.\n\nDato' Klana Leha was succeeded by Dato' Klana Bahi. There is no evidence of the relationship of this chief to his predecessors; but it is recorded that he belonged to the waris hilir while the Klana Leha belonged to the waris hulu. What this means may be conjectured. Dato' Klana Bahi obtained the title by virtue of relationship to his predecessors in the male line. At his death the rule of succession was altered to that of uterine descent. Ultimately there was the usual compromise\u2014the gilir\u2014under which the two families, that of Klana Leha (waris hulu) and that of Klana Bahi (waris hilir) took it in turn to succeed. This rule is still recognized but it has not been consistently observed, as the following tables will show.\n\n| Waris hulu. |\n|-------------|\n| D. K. Leha (II) | To' Tepi (f) | To' Lembut (f) |\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIt will be seen that the death of Dato' Klana Bahi was followed by two successive appointments from the *waris hulu*, and we are left to wonder if the theory of the *giliir* was not put forward first by the Arab, Saiyid Abdu'r-Rahman, to whom it meant so much.\n\nThe days of the fourth Klana, Dato' Kawal, were troubled by petty wars. The first was a war against the Dato' of Ulu Muar who favoured the cause of Raja Radin as Yamtuan Besar while the Klana favoured Yamtuan Sati. Raja Radin was driven out. The second was a war against Yamtaun Sati who had offended the Klana; Yamtuan Sati was driven out. The third was a war against Raja 'Ali in the interests of Raja Radin; Raja 'Ali was expelled from Sri Menanti and Raja Radin placed on the throne by the Klana and the Dato' of Rembau. Dato' Kawal waged three successful wars with the futile result that he replaced matters exactly where he first found them. His next contest was even less satisfactory. He quarrelled with the Dato' Bandar and plunged the country into civil war. Yamtuan Radin, who was invited to arbitrate, seems to have settled the dispute by appointing the Klana and Bandar joint rulers of Sungai Ujong. This compromise created an impossible position; the rivalry of the joint rulers gave the people no peace, till the British intervened.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nMalay historians give few dates. Dato' Klana Kawal's first war followed the death of Yamtuan Lenggang in A.D. 1824; his last war included Raja Radin's arbitration in 1849. The date of his death is not recorded.\n\nHe was succeeded by his brother, Dato' Klana Sanding. It was during the reign of this\u2014the fifth\u2014Klana that Yamtuan Radin died and Tengku Antah, his son, claimed the throne of Negri Sembilan. The claim was disputed by Raja Alang Sohor, son of Yamtuan Beringin. The Dato' Klana set aside both claimants and nominated Yamtuan Imam to the vacant throne.\n\nThe next Klana, Saiyid Aman or Abdu'r-Rahman, had continual wars and troubles with Dato' Bandar. He was an Arab, while the Bandar was a Malay; he was clear-sighted enough to desire the par Britannica, while the Bandar and his friends welcomed every Selangor freebooter who sought asylum in the country. Such a state of affairs could not last. The British intervened; and the Klana sacrificed his popularity by supporting them. It is to Saiyid Aman we owe the introduction of the Residential system into Sungai Ujong in 1874.\n\nPART II.\n\nCeremonially the Dato' Klana of Sungai Ujong counts for little when compared with the Yamtuan.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{Sa-k\u0113chil-k\u0113chil anak put\u0113r\u0113, sama b\u0113sar d\u0113ngan undang;} \\\\\n&\\text{Sa-k\u0113chil-k\u0113chil anak undang, sama b\u0113sar d\u0113ngan l\u0113mbaga;} \\\\\n&\\text{Sa-k\u0113chil-k\u0113chil anak l\u0113mbaga, sama b\u0113sar d\u0113ngan ibu bapa.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\"A prince's child however small ranks as high as a territorial chief\". So runs a royalist saying, hardly consonant with Minangkabau custom which traces descent through the mother. Only when dealing with ceremonial should the non-royal status of the Klana be emphasized. He had the office of a Raja Muda but was not personally sacrosanct. He was wakil k\u0113rajaan, Regent; when a Yamtuan died, it was the Dato' Klana who sent the envoys to Siak to ask for a successor:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hilang raja, b\u0113rganti raja; m\u0113nj\u0113mput ka-Minangkabau.}\n\\]\n\nIt was a Klana (Dato' Klana Kawal) who broke the \"tie with Siak\" and stopped the missions to Minangkabau. To this day it is the Ruler of Sungai Ujong who formally nominates a Yamtuan. He is the \"Imam\" of the four great chiefs, the pillars of the State; he is their leader and their spokesman.\n\nWithin his own territories the Dato' Klana used to be an absolute ruler. He still claims to be b\u0113rundang b\u0113rk\u0113adilan, technical terms implying that he is head of the legal systems of the country. He was not b\u0113rk\u0113adilan under the constitution of A.D. 1773; the head of the courts was the Yamtuan. But Sungai Ujong ceased to recognize the supremacy of the Yamtuan after the death of Tengku Imam and did not give up its autonomy under the treaty.\nof 1898. The mosques and kathis of Sungai Ujong are not controlled by Sri Menanti. The Klana was, of course, head of the waris who drew so large a portion of the revenues of the country, but in addition to his share of this income he was entitled to the proceeds of all farms and monopolies, of all poll-taxes and of all fines under the religious law.\n\nImport and export duties were divided: those collected on the Linggi River were shared between the Klana, the Bandar and the To\u2019 Muda Linggi; those on other rivers between the Klana and the Bandar.\n\nAn anomalous element has been introduced into Sungai Ujong government by the rise of the Dato\u2019 Bandar to a position of equality with the Klana. In the euphemistic language of Sungai Ujong jurists, the country is under the care of both rulers equally:\n\n*Telor sa-biji sama di-tatang;\nP\u00e9saka satu sama di-b\u00e9la;\nHilang di-darat, di-ayer m\u00e9nchari;\nHilang di-ayer, di-darat m\u00e9nchari;\nLaksana mata hitam dengen mata puteh.*\n\nBut Malay common-sense, in proverbs as well as in law, declaims against the folly of dividing sovereignty. Sometimes the dictum is a homely caution against putting two cocks into one yard; sometimes it is a solemn legal maxim about the powers of life and death:\n\n*Pantang dalam \u2018alam m\u00e9nduakan p\u00e9dang p\u00e9manchong;\nPantang dalam luak m\u00e9nduakan k\u00e9r\u00eds p\u00e9nyalang.*\n\nBritish protection has put an end to this rivalry by giving the Klana and the Bandar allowances of exactly the same amount and by dividing equally among their waris their commuted share of the revenue.\n\nIn the days of the Johor supremacy the Ruler or Penghulu Mant\u00e9ri is said to have sent biennially to the Sultan the famous bunga mas or golden tree of submission. Tradition points out the spot where the gold was obtained\u2014the valley between the hill of Shaikh Abdu\u2019r-Rahman and the Seremban Residency. During the Minangkabau period the Klana was expected to send the mas manah to the Yamtuan Besar as well as gifts of buffaloes on the occasion of the marriage or circumcision of a prince of the blood.\n\nAll this came to an end when Sungai Ujong became independent of Sri Menanti at the accession of Tengku Antah. The treaty of A.D. 1898 (under which the present Yamtuan was installed) did not alter the position materially. Mas manah is paid now out of the general revenues of the State and the Klana\u2019s gifts are formal and ceremonial. The great Chiefs pay no tribute to their titular overlord.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nOnce a year at the hari raya besar the ruler of Sungai Ujong gives a reception or mengadap, at which all the lesser Chiefs of his territory are expected to do him obeisance. This ceremony is emblematical; it typifies the harmonious working of the machinery of State.\n\nSemenda sujud kapada lembaga-nya;\nLembaga sujud mengadap undang-nya;\nItu-lah tanda:\n\nAdat dalar, muafakat esa;\nBumi senang, padi menjadi.\n\nThe ceremonial at this reception is of interest as showing the relative precedence of the various Chiefs of the country.\n\nThe kebesaran or emblems of rank to which a Klana is entitled are the following:\u2014\n\n1. two yellow flags (merual);\n2. two black flags (tunggul);\n3. two pennons (ular-ular);\n4. two streamers (panji-panji);\n5. two fringed umbrellas (payong ubur-ubur);\n6. two tufted spears (tombak bend\u00e9rang);\n7. two drawn swords (p\u00e9dang b\u00e9rchabut);\n8. two long creeses (k\u00e9ris panjang t\u00e9rsampai);\n9. two fajar m\u00e9nyenseng;\n10. a salute of five guns;\n11. a dais of five tiers or steps;\n12. insignia-bearers (juak) at court ceremonies;\n13. certain pillows and cushions (bantal b\u00e9rsusun, gunong b\u00e9rangkat);\n14. mattresses (tilam b\u00e9ruh\u00ed);\n15. yellow wrappings for insignia;\n16. a canopy over his dais;\n17. curtains round his dais;\n18. wrappings round his house-pillars;\n19. a marquee over his lawn;\n20. a going to announce his movements.\n\nThese emblems are common to all the four undang and seem to date back to the constitution of 1773 A.D. The Klana possesses also an heirloom in the form of a spear (changgai put\u00e9ri) presented to one of his predecessors by the Yamtuan Raja Melewar.\n\nIn accordance with the local dictum:\u2014\n\nPatal, tumboh; hilang b\u00e9rganti;\n\n\"a broken twig grows again, a lost life must be replaced,\"\u2014the death of a Klana is the signal for the appointment of a successor. There must be no interregnum; the new Ruler's first duty is to bury the Chief whom he follows:\nBertanam undang dengan undang.\n\nThe successor is chosen in alternation from the two branches of the waris di-darat family, the waris hulu and waris hilir; the legal phrase being:\n\nHilang di-hulu, timbul ka-hilir;\nHilang di-hilir, timbul ka-hulu.\n\nThe electors are three in number: a representative of the waris hilir (usually the Dato' Maharaja Lela); a representative of the waris hulu (usually the Dato' Johan); and a third party selected for his age, impartiality and knowledge of custom. These three must be unanimous. When they have come to a decision they announce their choice to the four principal Chiefs or tiang balai who proceed to bear the newly elected Klana in the funeral procession of his predecessor often on the bier. If the three electors fail to agree, the four tiang balai may nominate a Klana of their own choice. When the funeral is over, the Chiefs and the waris in attendance do homage to their new ruler. The formal installation comes later. It includes ceremonial ablutions at the \"Klana's well\" (telaga undang), a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Penghulus of the past, and a reception (mengadap) at which all the magnates of the country tender homage.\n\nThe chiefs of Sungai Ujong subordinate to the Klana may be divided into five classes according to their order of precedence:\n\n(a) the four territorial lembaga;\n(b) the two heads of the Klana's waris;\n(c) the three tribal lembaga;\n(d) the miscellaneous titles;\n(e) the Klana's court officials.\n\nThe four territorial lembaga or \"pillars of the Court\" (lembaga tiang balai) were:\n\n(1) the Dato' Sri Maharaja Diraja who was also Bandar;\n(2) the Dato' Anduleka Manduleka of Pantai;\n(3) the Dato' Akhir-zaman of Rantau;\n(4) the Dato' Amar of Klawang.\n\nTime has played havoc with this list. The mukim of Klawang is no longer included in Sungai Ujong; and the Dato' Amar is now a Jelebu Chief.\n\nThe dignities of Bandar and of Dato' Sri Maharaja Diraja are no longer held by the same person: the officers themselves have lost importance. It is their antiquity that gives to these titles the precedence they continue to possess.\n\nThe office of Dato' Bandar dates from 1715 A.D. and was conferred by Abdul-Jalil III, Sultan of Johor. It carried with it great powers and revenues.\n\n\"Wherever the waves break,\nAnd the sands of the beach are broken,\"\nWhere the wind blows into the estuaries,\nAnd the polers work, and the oarsmen ply,\nAnd the quays are lined with ordered ships.\nAnd the measures are filled, and the scales are used,\nAnd buyers and sellers agree on the price,\u2014\nThose are the realms of the Bandar\u2019s rule.\u201d\n\nThe Shahbandar levied his toll on the commerce and shipping\nof the country; and since the wealth of a Malay State depended\nmainly on its development by foreign traders and settlers, his office\nmight easily become the most profitable post in the land. It was\nwealth that raised the Bandar to the position of a ruler of Sungai\nUjong.\n\nThe following is a list of the traditional holders of this office:\n\n1. Dato\u2019 Kling,\n2. Dato\u2019 Lujar,\n3. Dato\u2019 Sangkut,\n4. Dato\u2019 Karang,\n5. Dato\u2019 Bangkit,\n6. Dato\u2019 Nahar,\n7. Dato\u2019 Megat,\n8. To\u2019 Bandar Tedoh,\n9. To\u2019 Bandar Lebai,\n10. To\u2019 Bandar Tunggal,\n11. To\u2019 Bandar Ahmad.\n\nThe first six are said to have held the office of Shahbandar and\nthe title of Dato\u2019 Maharaja Diraja. The seventh, Dato\u2019 Megat,\nbegan by holding both; but the dual position alarmed Dato\u2019 Klana\nLoha who divided it up, giving the office of Bandar to Dato\u2019 Megat\nand the dignity of Dato\u2019 Sri Maharaja Diraja to the Bandar\u2019s\nbrother, Sohor. In those days the Shahbandar ranked as a simple\nlembaga, his only distinction being a right to a salute of four (in-\nstead of three) guns.\n\nIn the days of Dato\u2019 Klana Sindang troubles arose over some\nRawa settlers and the Dato\u2019 Bandar Lebai refused to aid the Klana\nwith men, money and gunpowder. A waris di-ayer named Manja\nKhatib came forward with the requisite help, thus enabling the\nGovernment to tide over the crisis.\n\nIn gratitude the Klana deposed Dato\u2019 Bandar Lebai, conferred\nthe vacant office on Manja Khatib, and raised him to the position\nof joint-ruler of the country. That is one story of a change which\nothers attribute to Klana Kawal and Yamtuan Radin. Manja\nKhatib came to be known as Dato\u2019 Bandar Tunggal and was the\nchief whose turbulence and lawlessness led to British intervention\nin the Negri Sembilan. His character makes it improbable that he\nacquired power in any pacific way; but whatever may have been his\nmethods, he was successful in raising his position to an equality\nwith that of the Klana himself.\n\nThe title of Dato\u2019 Sri Maharaja Diraja has been held by the\nfollowing persons since the eighth Dato\u2019 relinquished it in order to\nretain the position of Bandar:\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n9. Sohor,\n10. Sitam,\n11. Che Ara (a woman),\n12. Gudam,\n13. Subom (deposed),\n\n14. Said,\n15. Haji Ahmad,\n16. Mat Sah,\n17. Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Dato' Klana Kawal.\n\nNow that the Bandar has been raised above the rank of a lembaga, the Dato' Sri Maharaja may be regarded as the principal lembaga of the waris di-ayer. This family is divided into five branches,\u2014one keturunan and four p\u00e9rut,\u2014the traditional pedigree being as follows:\n\nBendahara Sekudai\n\nTo' S\u00e9m\u00e9rga\nm. Rambutan Jantan or L\u00e9bai Mamat of Pasai.\n\nTo' Sulong (f.) Dato' Kling To' Susu To' Susu To' Susu\n(Bandar). Tunggal (f.) Ganda (f.) Dara (f.)\n\nIn the days of succession through the direct male line the titles of Bandar and Sri Maharaja Diraja were monopolized by the descendants of Dato' Kling. Now, under the adat p\u00e9rpateh, the descendants of Dato' Kling's sisters also claim to be waris di-ayer. Historically those claims may not carry weight, but doubtless there were good reasons why they should be taken seriously. There does not appear to be any system of gilir or rotation between the various branches of this large and ancient family.\n\nThe title of the Dato' Anduleka Manduleka also is ancient. This Dato' governed the mukim of Pantai and was one of the four principal lembaga or tiang balai of the Klana's court; the members of his family were included in the waris di-darat or Klana's own house. But they were not allowed to succeed to the position of Klana, an anomaly explained by the theory that this family descended only by adoption from To' Sri Mani, daughter of the Bendahara Sekudai and reputed foundress of the Anduleka Manduleka family. The reputed holders of the title are given in the following list:\n\n1. Dato' Lantur,\n2. Tebu Amba,\n3. Dengut,\n4. Jadi,\n5. Jaya,\n6. Segar,\n7. Ulang,\n8. Alang,\n9. Lembing,\n10. Gentum,\n11. Minah,\n12. Chantek,\n13. Haji Muhammad Rashid.\n\nThe Dato' Akhir-zaman of Rantau, another of the lembaga tiang balai, counts as a waris di-ayer though there does not appear\nto be any historical basis for this classification. There have been eight holders only of the title, the first six being members of the same uterine family or p\u0113rut. But by a recent arrangement four families are to hold the dignity in rotation. The names of these chiefs were:\n\n1. Pasar,\n2. Ranjau,\n3. Bongkok,\n4. Kahar,\n5. Lajim,\n6. Miin,\n7. Simbok,\n8. Jamat.\n\nThe fourth of the l\u0113mbaga tiang balai, the Dato' Amar of Klawang, is now a Jelebu magnate.\n\nIt will be noticed that applied to these four major chiefs the words l\u0113mbaga and waris bear a very loose sense. A Sungai Ujong l\u0113mbaga is not headman of a matriarchal tribe as in Rembau and Kuala Pilah, nor is every waris di-darat eligible for the position of Dato' Klana. The adat p\u0113rpateh did not obtain over Sungai Ujong the power that it possesses in Rembau; and the long period during which the adat l\u0113m\u0113nggong was followed, has introduced a number of anomalies into the Government of this small State.\n\nNext in precedence after the tiang balai come the two representatives of the Klana's own family\u2014the Dato' Maharaja Lela of the waris hiliar, and the Dato' Johan of the waris hulu. These men are usually electors at the appointment of a Klana and possess a certain importance as such; but they have no territorial authority. From the family pedigrees it would appear that the two titles date back to the days of Dato' Klana Bahi when the law of rotation in families and of succession by female descent was introduced into Sungai Ujong. They are really the ibu bapa of two important p\u0113rut.\n\nBelow these two ibu bapa come the l\u0113mbaga tiga di-Pantai who are really tribal headmen of the Rembau type, though the number of their clansmen is small and their titles are modern. These three l\u0113mbaga are:\n\nDato' Mant\u0113ri (Sri Melenggang),\nDato' Raja 'di-muda (Buduanda),\nDato' Maharaja Ind\u0113ra (Batu Hampar).\n\nThey were appointed originally under other designations by the Dato' Anduleka Manduleka of Pantai and exercise no authority outside his mukim; but their present titles were created by the Klana.\n\nThe family of the Dato' Mant\u0113ri goes back to a certain Dato' Alun Tujoj who lived in the days of the Bendahara Sekudai and Penghulu Selat. One of this Dato's descendants accompanied the Anduleka Manduleka to Kuala Pedas to interview Raja Melewar and acquired the title of Dato' Umbi or \"the Root\" because he sat with his tongue rooted in his mouth and said nothing! At a later date the title of \"Root\" was turned into Dato' Mant\u0113ri.\nThere have been six Dato' Mant\u00e9ri; one of them was Kasim, father of the present Klana of Sungai Ujong.\n\nThe family of Dato' Raja'di-muda traces its origin to a Batin Maabud and held a number of minor dignities under the Dato' Anduleka Manduleka before receiving from Dato' Klana Kawal the l\u00e9mbara\u2014ship of the Biduanda and the title of Dato' Raja 'di-muda. This title has been held by four persons up to the present (1. Pendita, 2. Butang, 3. Muhammad Saleh, and 4. Kulup Laboh), but the gilir covers eight families in all.\n\nA long story is attached to the dignity of Dato' Maharaja Ind\u00e9ra. The founder of the family was a certain Gemaboh, khatib and mudin to the Sultan of Johor in the days of Batin Sri Alam. This man was sent by the Sultan to Pahang and Negri Sembilan as a missionary to remove reproach from the uncircumcised. He wandered up to Penjum, then to Kuala Dulang in Jelebu where he built a mosque, and finally settled with his wife in the Pantai mukim. One of his descendants accompanied the Dato' Anduleka Manduleka on the mission to Raja Melewar, and, like the Dato' Umbi, was nicknamed Dato' Pikir because he thought so much that he never spoke at all! This hereditary nickname was changed recently into the title of Dato' Maharaja Ind\u00e9ra, l\u00e9mbara of the Batu Hampar tribe;\u2014there have only been two bearers of the newer name,\u2014To' Gudoh and To' Daud.\n\nThe miscellaneous titles are hard to classify, and may be given in order of precedence.\n\nThe Dato' Dagang of Parui is said to owe his title to the fact that Raja Melewar once passed through Parui and found no one there whose business it was to receive him. He complained to the Klana of this inhospitable treatment, with the result that this frontier village was provided with a chief, the Dato Dagang, whose duty was the entertainment of distinguished guests. The precedence attached to this dignity is doubtless due to the comparative age of the office.\n\nNext after the Dato' Dagang of Parui comes the Penghulu Muda of Labu. The history of this title is lengthy and dates back to the days of Dato' Klana Leha. The mukim of Labu was first settled by a certain Dato' Mangkun, a waris di-ayer, who obtained from Klana Leha a concession of the locality. The first title given to the family was won by Dato' Mangkun herself; she killed an elephant with one tusk and presented the trophy to the Klana who dubbed her on the spot the Dato' B\u0113rgajah Tunggal, the lady of the Solitary Elephant. The higher title, that of Penghulu Muda, was conferred by Dato' Klana Kawal on Dato' Mangkun's grandson Sindeh, with the following emblems of rank: one spear, and\nthe right of having a State umbrella held over his head twice a year when the minor dignitaries of Labu came to pay their respects. Sindeh became blind and was succeeded by his cousin Si-Adil of Sungai Ujong. At Si-Adil's death, one Sohom became To' Muda but went on a pilgrimage to Mecca, leaving Paduka Besar Hasan to act for him. On Sohom's return the country was in a state of civil war and no resumption of the title was possible. When Captain Murray became Resident of Sungai Ujong and the country had peace, he was approached on the subject of this office and nominated Imam Prang Kasim and afterwards one Raja Layang to be Penghulu Muda of Labu, both appointments turning out badly and ending in the deposition of the holders. Then a child named Kosin was named To' Muda and Haji Abdu'r-Rahman, a brother of the Bandar, became To' Mangku or Deputy Penghulu. Kosin was lost sight of for many years; but when Haji Abdu'r-Rahman was deprived of his office, Kosin came forward and claimed Labu. Enquiry elicited the fact that Kosin was illegitimate; so he was deprived of his title. After this incident a man named Mahmud was made To' Mangku.\n\nThe title of To' Paduka was created by the Bandar in connection with the dignity of To' Muda Labu and has been held by two members of the family of the waris-di-Ayer. Theoretically the title of Penghulu Muda of Labu should be held alternately by the descendants of To' Mangkun and her sister To' Wi.\n\nThe Dato' Andatar is headman of the village of Situl and is chosen from the family of the patriarch who founded the village.\n\nThe Dato' Lela Perkasa holds a similar position at Mandum. He is chosen from the waris of an aboriginal Chief named Batin Kamat.\n\nThe Dato' Muda Linggi, who occupies a position of semi-independence in Sungai Ujong, usually settles the question of his precedence by staying away from the great audiences at which the issue might be raised. Outside the Klana's Court he is a dignitary of considerable importance. The history of his title is interesting. About A.D. 1775 a number of settlers from Riau came to Penajis in Rembau and established a colony there. They seem to have been law-abiding people but they would not conform with Rembau matriarchal custom which treats as incest the marriage of members of the same uterine family. Tradition has it that the ruler of Rembau at that period was Dato' Uban and that he refused to tolerate their presence in the country unless they accepted the adat perpatih in all its rigour. The Riau colonists left Penajis and took refuge in Sungai Ujong where the patriarchal adat temenggong was still in force. They were welcomed by Dato' Klana Leha who gave them a tract of country on the Sungai Ujong side of the\nLingga River, bounded upstream by Kuala Selebu, downstream by Bukit Tiga and Sungai Serban, and inland by Tampin Kechil opposite Permatang Pasir. Within these frontiers they govern themselves, and are allowed to marry their cousins even to this day. They recognize however a certain vassalage both to Rembau and to Sungai Ujong,\u2014b\u00ebribu kapada Rembau, b\u00ebrbapa ka-Sungai Ujong,\u2014and are expected to furnish assistance to the rulers of those countries, should they ever desire to visit Malacca. The year of this Settlement is said to have been 1783 A.D. and helps us to date both Dato\u2019 Klana Leha and Dato\u2019 Uban of Rembau. The leaders of the settlers were Dato\u2019 Awaludin and his sister, Dato\u2019 Sri. At a later date (1798 A.D.) the present site of the village of Linggi was opened by To\u2019 Lebai Dulaman who received the title of Penghulu. He was a grandson of Dato\u2019 Sri. He was succeeded by To\u2019 Juragan Abdu\u2019r-Rahman, his paternal uncle, who died about 1824 A.D. The next chief of Linggi Muhammad Atas was a Rembau man who had married a daughter of To\u2019 Juragan Abdu\u2019r-Rahman, but he was styled only To\u2019 Muda. This To\u2019 Muda Katas, as he was called, played an important part in local politics at the time of the Naning War and did much to thwart the ambition of Saiyid Shaaban. In A.D. 1833 the village of Kuala Linggi was founded by settlers from Langat. The successors of To\u2019 Muda Katas have been\n\n2. To\u2019 Muda Haji Muhammad Saleh,\n3. To\u2019 Muda Muhammad Peral,\n4. To\u2019 Muda Muhamad Bastam.\n\nWe now come to the titles of the officers attached to the court of the Klana and Bandar. Two of these are of the first importance.\n\nThe Dato\u2019 Laksamana Raja di-laut is the chief minister of the Klana; indeed his office is regarded as a stepping-stone to the rulership. He is, of course, a member of the inner circle of the waris-di-darat. He receives the envoys of foreign chiefs as well as the magnates of his own state, and is entitled himself to certain marks of high rank\u2014a spear and a black flag (tunggul). The dignity was created by Dato\u2019 Klana Kawal and its holders have been\n\n1. Sinding, afterwards Klana;\n2. Saiyid Aman, afterwards Klana;\n3. Nadim, deposed for recognizing Tengku Antah;\n4. Puput;\n5. Ahad (the present holder).\n\nThe Dato\u2019 Penglima Besar holds in the Bandar\u2019s Court the position that the Dato\u2019 Laksamana holds in the Klana\u2019s. The present Bandar was Penglima Besar to his predecessor.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nThe other officers of the Court call for little notice. They are juak or attendants whose humble status is hidden under high-sounding designations such as Sultan B\u00e9ndahara, Divangsa, Maharaja, Maharaja Singa, P\u00e9nghima Awan, Imam P\u00e9rang Kanan, and so on. Some of these titles have elaborate histories attached to them; and all are p\u00e9saka or heirlooms in certain families.\n\nThe matter of the dispossessed family of Beranang and Semunyeh deserves attention, if only from the amount of official correspondence it has caused. The ancient boundaries of the State of Sungai Ujong differed greatly from the modern. The frontier ran from Jugra to Mt. Tunggul Si-jaga, thence to Merbok Krawang, thence by Rekok and Subang Hilang, thence to Mt. Perhentian Berhimpun in Jelebu. It included the Lukut mukims\u2014and most of the Langat districts of Selangor. But the Bugis ruler of Selangor carved out a kingdom for themselves without reference to the rights of the To\u2019 Engku of Klang or the Penghulu Mantri of Sungai Ujong. The coast fell into their possession; they held Jugra Lukut and even at one time Cape Rachado. They did not however penetrate to inland territory much of which remained unoccupied by Bugis and Malay.\n\nThe first attempt to colonize Semunyeh and Beranang was made in the days of the Dato\u2019 Klana Saiyid Aman who handed the district over to Raja Husain, a waris of Sungai Ujong. This chief levied a toll on all settlers in his mukims; but a territory cannot be developed in this primitive way, and the country remained a waste till the establishment of a settled government under the British protectorate.\n\nWhen the frontier between Selangor and Negri Sembilan came to be defined, the mukims of Beranang and Semunyeh were included in Selangor and some portions of the coast district were ceded to Negri Sembilan. Raja Husain was offered a choice between the position of a Selangor Penghulu and the sinecure office of Dato\u2019 Laksamana of Sungai Ujong. He elected to serve under Selangor. Unfortunately he was extremely incompetent. After a long and patient trial his services were dispensed with, and his post was given to one of his relatives. That relative also was a failure. The position of Penghulu of Semunyeh passed out of the hands of Raja Husain\u2019s family; and Raja Husain himself died shortly afterwards, leaving a large family to nurse a grievance.\n\nBut it is an interesting point in local custom that Raja Husain\u2019s children have no valid grievance over this lost inheritance. Raja Husain was a waris of Sungai Ujong through his mother, Che\u2019 Angsa; his children (under the law of uterine succession) are not waris at all. The adat p\u00e9rpateh of their native country\nwould have disinherited them quite as surely as British dislike for the inefficient. Their genealogy is interesting however on other grounds, as the following table will show:\n\nRaja Adil of Rembau.\n\n| Raja Hasil, Yamtuan Muda, of Rembau. | Tengku Kadim, Tengku Kechil Muda of Rembau. |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Tengku Jafar.                        | Tengku Minah.                                 |\n|                                      | m. Tengku Dzia-alam.                          |\n| Tengku Timah m.                     | Tengku Kechil Muda m. Che' Angsa Tengku Laut. |\n|                                      | Raja Husain.                                  |\n\nIt is this family which possesses the seals and traditions of the disinherited house of Raja Hasil through his grand-daughter, Tengku Timah. None the less, Raja Husain personally has no claim on the ground of descent from the deposed Yamtuan; and even his descent from Raja Adil is not in the direct male line.\n\nThe interest of the Semunyeh-Beranang question is more official than historical. Raja Husain never obtained a title from any Negri Sembilan chief and has no position, except as a waris, in the court of the Klana.\n\nIt remains only to touch on the ceremonial at the Klana's Court.\n\nThe Ruler's insignia (k\u0113b\u0113saran) have been enumerated already.\n\nThose of a l\u0113mbaga are:\u2014\n\n1. a salute of three guns;\n2. a sword;\n3. a long kris;\n4. an umbrella;\n5. a banner (tunggul);\n6. a pennon (ular-ular);\n7. a streamer (awa-awa?);\n8. certain cloth decorations.\n\nThese marks of greatness are common to the l\u0113mbaga of all the Negri Sembilan States. The duties differed. The great l\u0113mbaga of Sungai Ujong (tiang balai) were hereditary territorial chiefs and not tribal headmen. They received no fees such as the mas tukul lantak of Rembau, and did not have their authority limited to any one tribe.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nOccurrence of the Malayan Badger or Teledu in Borneo.\n\nBy J. C. Moulton, M.A., B.S.E. (Oxon).\n\nDirector, Raffles Museum and Library, Singapore.\n\nDuring a recent collecting expedition into the interior of Northern Sarawak I heard from the natives there of the existence of a cave-dwelling animal, remarkable for its powerful and disagreeable odour. Subsequently I was fortunate enough to obtain two flat skins from a native chief (in exchange for a pair of trousers). Although the head and hind-legs have been cut off, the skins are in comparatively good condition and quite recognizable as those of the Malayan Badger.\n\nThis Badger differs from the true Badgers of Europe and Asia in having a long pointed mobile muzzle and a very short tail. It is only found in Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Great Natuna Islands and Palawan*. The Javanese species was described by Desmarest as long ago as 1820. It appears to be by no means uncommon in that island, where it is known as the Teledu or Sigoeng.\n\nIn Borneo, however, it is evidently a great rarity. Only two specimens appear to be known hitherto. They are in the British Museum and were described by Oldfield Thomas in 1902 as *Mydaus lucifer*. One is a female collected by Sir Hugh Low in 1876 \"from the mainland near Labuan,\" and the other from Papar (North Borneo), collected by A. H. Everett.\n\nThe two skins now obtained for the Raffles Museum, Singapore, agree well with the description of *M. lucifer*, except in size. Oldfield Thomas gives the dimensions of the type (in skin) as follows:\n\nHead and body 340 mm.; tail 35 mm.; with hairs 90 mm.\n\nThe Raffles Museum skins are much bigger:\n\nNeck and body 540 mm.; tail 40-45 mm.; with hairs 80-85 mm.\n\nThe light marking is very broad and conspicuous on the nape, 95 mm. across widest part narrowing on the middle of the back down to 20 mm. in one skin and to 10 mm., followed by a very short break altogether, in the other. This marking becomes slightly\n\n* Dr. Hanitsch records one captured in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore in 1909. He suggests that it was probably a specimen escaped from captivity. It is the Java form; its natural occurrence in Singapore would certainly be curious. On the other hand it is difficult to imagine anyone attempting to keep such an odoriferous animal as a pet or indeed for any purpose!\nwider again on the lumbar region, whence it passes on to the tail. In one skin the hairs at the base of the tail are dark, forming a basal ring which Oldfield Thomas notes is absent in his lucifer. In the other the underside only of the tail is brownish.\n\nOldfield Thomas comments on the roundness of the skull of his type, which he says is generally a youthful character. He adds, however, that \"the type seems fully adult, its sphenoid suture being quite and its basilar partly closed.\"\n\nIf he is right in regarding his two specimens as adults, then the two skins in the Raffles Museum possibly represent a new species, or subspecies, twice the size of that described by Oldfield Thomas from Borneo as lucifer. I would suggest naming this new form Mydaus javanensis montanus.\n\nI am inclined to think that it would be more correct to relegate all the Mydaus \"species\" to subspecific rank, regarding them all as geographical races of but one species, which would be known by the oldest name, viz. M. javanensis Desmarest.\n\nThe exceptional size of montanus however might perhaps entitle it alone to specific distinction, but until a complete skin with skull is seen, I prefer to regard it as the Bornean mountain form of javanensis, while the name lucifer must be restricted to the Bornean lowland form.*\n\nLife in the mountain fastnesses of the interior of Borneo, undisturbed or perhaps less harassed by native hunters, who alone would constitute their real danger, might well have favoured the development of a larger and presumably stronger race, whose chances of survival were greater than those of their less favoured relations living in the more populated lowland country.\n\nEvidently both forms are rare and much restricted in their distribution; probably they are dying out. Collectors in Dutch Borneo and Sarawak have apparently failed to find it in that part of Borneo, but from inquiries made recently in North Borneo it seems to be known there still. One correspondent, Mr. R. J. Cockrill, writes from Lahad Datu, British North Borneo (4th January, 1921):\n\n\"I have twice seen the animal, called here \"Singgoeng\" in this District, East Coast.\n\n\"The first occasion was some years ago when one came under my Bungalow in Lahad Datu at night. It was attacked by my dogs and emitted the very strong smell you mention,\u2014so much so that my guests and myself had to clear out until the atmosphere was less 'thick.' We killed the animal in my garden.\n\n* The introduction of a new name based on such inadequate material is usually difficult to defend. I would, however, quote as a precedent the Argus Pheasant (A. bipunctatus) described some 50 years ago from a single feather, which is still the only known \"specimen\" of that mysterious species and still to be sought for in this part of the world.\n\"A few weeks ago I came across a recently killed one near our cattle sheds on the Segama River, about 8 miles from Lahad Datu.\"\n\nAnother correspondent, Mr. E. Stuart Young, who spent eleven years in British North Borneo, gives me the following interesting note:\n\n\"It was in 1915 near the banks of the Pegallen River some ten miles as the crow flies above Tenom, that one of my natives met this beast at the foot of a big tree. As he got up to it the powerful odour you mention was emitted and he was rendered unconscious for about an hour. The animal ran into a hole at the base of the tree and the man was carried away by his companions.\n\n\"The native, who was very intelligent, was a Kadayan brought up amongst the Dayaks in Sarawak and had been all over the jungles whose water flows into Brunei Bay. He had never seen or heard of such an animal before.\"\n\nThe Kalabits informed me that, so far as they knew, these Badgers, including the two skins they gave me, were only found in caves on Mt. Murud, a mountain which forms the northern and highest end of the Pemabo Range at the headwaters of the Baram River, Long $115^\\circ 30'$ E & Lat $3^\\circ 50'$ N. This mountain has never been visited by Europeans, although one or two Sarawak Government Officers have been within sight of it and passed close to it.\n\nThe Kalabits told me of the powerful smell emitted by this Badger\u2014\"Dengan-ruit\" is their name for it. They said it was so bad that dogs, on entering a Badger's cave, had actually been killed by the poisonous smell. I am afraid I did not treat this part of their tale as seriously as perhaps it may have deserved. However, they assured me that it was strictly true. I was therefore particularly interested to receive Mr. Stuart Young's account quoted above and to find the following note published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1879 (pp. 664-5):\n\n\"The following extracts from a letter addressed to the Secretary by Mr. Henry O. Forbes, dated \"Kosala, Bautam, W. Java. July 27, 879,\" were read:\n\n\"My present residence is about 2,000 feet above the sea. Many, many times, especially in the evening just after dusk, the Mydlaus has discovered its proximity to us by its extremely disagreeable and peculiar odour. So powerful indeed is this that natives attempting to catch these animals, often fall down insensible if struck by the discharge from their anal battery. Even at the distance of half a mile and more the stink, as I must call it, permeates the atmosphere so thickly that it is plainly discernible by the taste.\"\n\nIn regard to the altitude at which this Badger is found, Forbes writes in the above-quoted letter:\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\n\"The following note as to the distribution of the Badger-headed Mydaus (Mydaus meliceps), called by the Sundanese \"Sigoeng\" (Dutch spelling), may not be without interest.\n\n\"Horsfield says that this species is confined exclusively to those mountains which have an elevation of more than 7,000 feet above the surface of the ocean. There it occurs with the same regularity as many plants. The long extended surface of Java, abounding with isolated volcanoes with conical points which exceed this elevation, affords many places favourable to its resort.\"\n\nLydekker makes the following statement in the Royal Natural History, 1897, Vol. II, p. 88:\n\n\"The Malayan badger appears to be confined to the mountains of Java, Sumatra and Borneo, ranging in the former island from an elevation of about five hundred to upwards of seven thousand feet above the level of the sea. In Borneo it is found at elevations of not more than eighty or one hundred feet, and in Sumatra does not ascend above one thousand feet.\"\n\nI do not know on what authority Lydekker makes the above statement regarding the Bornean species. The two skins from Mt. Murud would not come from an elevation of less than 3,000 ft., as the country slopes up to the foot of the Pemabo Range, which rises from a base about 3,000 feet above the sea level to an altitude of over 6,000 feet. The height of Mt. Murud is probably about 8,000 feet. The Kalabits told me that these badgers were found in caves on the mountain, but I did not ascertain how far up.\n\nAs noted before, only two Bornean specimens have apparently found their way to European Museums. They are both in the British Museum, whence Mr. Oldfield Thomas writes to me in a letter dated 1st January 1921:\n\n\"I am sorry to say that with regard to Mydaus we are where we were when I wrote my paper in 1902.\n\n\"We have had no more specimens and I can say no more than I did then. So Mydaus is evidently a rare animal.\"\n\nThe Director of the Zoological Museum, Buitenzorg, Java, informs me that they have no specimens of Mydaus from Borneo in that Museum.\n\nThe nearest allies to the Malay Badgers (Mydaus) are the Hog-Badgers or Sand-Badgers (Arctonyx), of which species occur in China, India, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo.* They are distinguished from the Malayan Badgers by their longer and more bushy tails, although they resemble them in the long and naked muzzle.\n\n* According to Trouessart and Gyldenstolpe, but no definite record of any specimen from Borneo is given.\nBibliographical Note.\n\n1820.

Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nI have for examination a small series of Malaysian bearded pigs from the Bornean-Sumatran area: those from Borneo are *Sus barbatus*: pigs from Sumatra and Sumatran islands have been named, and determined as, *Sus oi*\u00b9: the latter series is not homogenous and it is open to anyone to say that the island animals are of the Bornean form\u2014but a topo-type of *Sus oi* is still more like the latter than are the animals from the islets.\n\nWhen Miller wrote his \"Notes on Malayan Pigs\"\u00b2 he defined *Sus barbatus* of Borneo (after examining 27 skulls of adults) as having \"the posterior molar, both above and below long, the upper tooth containing a compressed anterior median ridge, a middle median ridge, and a large terminal median heel in addition to two well-developed bicusped cross ridges, the lower tooth containing three large bicusped cross ridges and three smaller median ridges, the last of which forms the terminal heel.\"\n\nOf *Sus oi* he wrote in the same article (nine specimens examined from E. Sumatra, Banka and Kundur Id.: but only two adults with the last lower molar in good condition) \"last molar both above and below smaller than in the Bornean animal, the upper tooth retaining all its elements, but with its posterior portion much narrowed, the lower tooth lacking the terminal heel, but with the third transverse ridge reduced to a terete heel-like remnant.\n\n\"This species is distinguishable from *Sus barbatus* chiefly by the reduced size and complexity of the posterior lower molar, as shown by the type and by one of Doctor Volz's Palembang specimens, the only adults yet known with this tooth in good condition. No tendency toward a similar reduction could be detected in any of the twenty-seven adults of *Sus barbatus* that I have examined. It is very probable that, as Doctor Jentink states, the skull is more elongated than in the Bornean animal.\"\n\nIn his key he summarises the differences as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Third lower molar with three cross ridges and a terminal heel....\"\n\n*Sus barbatus.*\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, XV, 1902, pp. 51-2.\n\u00b2 Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. XXX, 1906, pp. 737-758, pls. XXXIX-LXIV.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nThird lower molar with two cross ridges and a terminal heel.... \"Sus oi.\"\n\nOf still larger series of Sumatran and Bornean material Lyon wrote\u00b3 \"The specimens indicate that the members of the Sus barbatus group of pigs are somewhat more variable than was at first supposed. The characters pointed out by Mr. Miller, however, appear as a rule to hold good. The most reliable character for distinguishing between Sus oi and Sus barbatus is the size and the shape of the last lower molars. This tooth averages longer in the Bornean pigs and in the majority of the specimens shows three distinct cross ridges and a terminal heel, while in the Sumatran Sus oi most specimens have this tooth shorter, with only two cross ridges and a terminal heel, or sometimes what appears like three cross ridges and no heel. As for actual size of the skulls, the largest in the U. S. National Museum comes from Borneo (Cat. No. 142351, upper length 487 mm.) It does not, however, reach the extreme length (505 mm.) given by Mr. Miller for Sus oi. All the pigs of this group recently taken by Doctor Abbott on Sumatra or the adjacent islands are distinctly smaller than is the type of Sus oi.\"\n\nMy Bornean series consists of five adult skulls with mandibles and one mandible from the southern half of Sarawak (one with exceedingly worn teeth, one just adult) which should all be Sus barbatus; and my Sumatran set\u2074 of a topotype of Sus oi and two adult skulls with mandibles and one skull only (with very worn teeth) from Tanjong Batu, south east of Great Durian Id., Rio Archipelago, which should also be Sus oi. To these may be added Miller's description combined with his figures of skulls and teeth which are very large and clear.\n\nThe Tanjong Batu examples agree with the topotype and the figures and descriptions of Sus oi\u2014and so do three of the six Bornean specimens!\n\nOf the remaining Bornean specimens two clearly have the mandibular teeth of barbatus of Miller, and another with the detail worn away has the teeth nearly as long; but of the last all one can say of its exceedingly worn teeth is that the posterior lower molar is very large and apparently has the form of barbatus though it is abnormal, ending with a pronounced outward curving spur, whereas the last lower molar in all the others is rounded. Its posterior upper molar is truncated and terminates squarely: the remainder agree with each other in having the end of the last upper molar rounded.\n\n\u00b3 Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. XXXIV. 1908, p 626.\n\u2074 Lent by Raffles Museum, Singapore.\nRecent writers on Bornean pigs have agreed that *S. longirostris*, Nehring, is only a synonym of *S. barbatus* which Miller says is a large-toothed animal. Is there another pig in Borneo (besides *S. barbatus* and *S. gargantua*) or is the last molar in the Bearded Pig as variable as it is in some species of *Presbytis*\u2014as variable as many of the characters of the skull? This latter supposition seems more likely.\n\nAs far as the teeth go I am unable to separate my material into two forms but there appear to be other characters by which it may be possible to maintain the Sumatran animal as a slightly differentiated subspecies.\n\nAs compared with *S. b. barbatus* it has the muzzle (front of *pmx* to anterior alveolus of canine) longer\u2014and perhaps a little broader; the mandibular symphysis longer; the mandible a little deeper; while the profile of the face is perhaps a little more concave. And though fewer Sumatran than Bornean animals have been measured *S. b. oi* also appears to be a little larger. The maximum upper length of skull in the U. S. National Museum series is 490 mm, for *barbatus* (27 specimens): 505 for *oi*. My series shows 480 for *barbatus*: 520 for *oi* (from Tanjong Batu).\n\nWhat is *Sus gargantua* Miller\\(^5\\), a name based on a very large skull from S. E. Borneo (the type locality of *Sus barbatus*)? Its molars in no way differ from those of *barbatus* and *oi*, the unique skull possessing a posterior lower molar with three bicuspid ridges and a terminal heel.\n\nIts distinctness rests on the size and shape of the skull and while, though adult, it is only a young adult yet the upper length of the skull measures some 570 mm. (22\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.) against 490 (19\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in.) in *S. barbatus* and 520 (20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.) in *Sus oi*. As for the shape of the skull it differs from that usual in the others principally in having that part of the cranium lying behind the orbits pushed backwards and downwards so that it is more prolonged posteriorly and not so high there, the bottom of the condyles being scarcely above the alveolar line of the cheek teeth; while lines drawn through the lower edge of the zygomata and of the alveolus are either parallelled or, if produced, meet posteriorly whereas the same lines produced in *barbatus* and *oi* always seem to meet anteriorly.\n\nIn spite of the skull being larger than the known skulls of the others the teeth do not exceed theirs in size.\n\nIf the type of *S. gargantua* is not an example of *barbatus* of abnormal shape and size (and there is no reason to believe that it is) it must be a distinct species since *gargantua* and *barbatus* occur side by side. Perhaps marked external differences will later be found.\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) Miller, t. c. p. 743 and plates.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nIn this connection it is interesting to note that the Malays inhabiting the central parts of Eastern Sumatra and some of the islands closely adjacent report the existence there of another pig much larger than *Sus b. oi* and regarded by them as quite distinct from it\u2014the \"Babi branti\"\u2014in habits nomadic and consorting in droves\\(^6\\). There is no reason to doubt the statements which indicate a Sumatran analogue to the Bornean *Sus gargantua*, thus paralleling the case of *oi* and *barbatus*.\n\nExcluding\u2014their position being uncertain\u2014*Sus gargantua* of South-eastern Borneo, of huge size, and *Sus branti* of Eastern Sumatra, breast high at the shoulders and decreasing towards the rump, it appears to me that there are only three real species of pig in the Malaysian sub-region (not including the Philippine Islands and Celebes): these are *Sus scrofa* (to which belong *S. cristatus*, *S. vittatus* and all the \"species\" or forms of common wild swine that have been described from the area\\(^7\\)), *Sus barbatus* of Borneo and Sumatra and *Sus verrucosus* of Java.\n\n**Literature Consulted.**\n\n*Rolleston*, *Transactions of the Linnean Society: Zoology*, Vol. I, pt. 5, Oct. 1877, pp. 251-286, pls.

Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nAmongst the mammals recently obtained by Major J. C. Moulton in North Sarawak, mostly of fairly well-known species\u2014though some, such as the series of *Sciurus prevostii baluensis* and *S. p. suffusus*, are of considerable interest from the point of distribution\u2014are two examples of a squirrel which, when seen in the forest, must bear a close superficial resemblance to the more rusty-bellied individuals of the very variable local form of *Sciurus vittatus*, i.e. *S. v. dulitensis*. They are, however, considerably smaller than this animal and rather more brightly coloured and have, moreover, large buff patches behind the ears.\n\nOn the other hand they are much larger and more richly coloured beneath than *Glyphotes simus* from Kinabalu\u00b9 (still known only by the type specimen) which, besides lacking the buff patches, has markedly distinct cranial and dental characters. As they appear to occur side by side with *S. v. dulitensis* I feel compelled to regard them as a distinct species\u2014a thing I am loth to do whenever I can avoid it.\n\n**Sciurus adamsi** sp. nov.\n\nSuperficially resembling *S. vittatus dulitensis* Bonhote, in colour but the grizzled areas rather brighter and less olivaceous, the yellow element being ochraceous instead of buff. Underparts of body and limbs orange-cinnamon to cinnamon-rufous (Ridgway), but the chin and throat somewhat greyish. Tail as in *S. v. dulitensis* but the grizzle more tawny and the extremity without any rufous suffusion. Round the eyes a tawny ring, the ears with fronts and edges distinctly tawny and behind the ears a large clearly-defined patch of pure buff, partly on the metectote and partly on the side of the neck. Lateral stripes of buff and black (the latter slightly grizzled with rufous) as in *S. v. dulitensis*.\n\nSize much smaller than *S. v. dulitensis*.\n\nSkull and teeth as is *S. v. dulitensis* but smaller.\n\nCollector's external measurements of the type taken in the flesh:\u2014head and body 176; tail (imperfect) 72; hindfoot, s.u., 48; ear 15 mm.\n\nSkull measurements\u00b2:\u2014greatest length, 42.5, 41.0; condylobasilar length, 36.0, 34.8; basilar length, 34.4, 32.0; palatilar length, 17.7, 16.3; diastema, 9.8, 9.0; upper molar row (alveoli),\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Thomas, Ann. and Mag.

The only possibility of the three specimens being of the same species is that *Glyphotes simus* has been described from an extremely juvenile individual: but Thomas states that the type is an adult.\n\nAt Major Moulton's request I have named this squirrel in honour of Mr. C. D. Adams, District Officer, Baram, to whom Major Moulton was indebted for exceptional facilities accorded to him during his expedition in that district.\n\nThe type and paratype are, for the present, in the Raffles Museum, Singapore, and the Selangor Museum, F.

S. respectively.\nChinese Marriages, as regarded by the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements.\n\nBy Roland St. John Braddell.\n\nWhen Penang and Singapore were first settled by the English, they were for all practical purposes uninhabited islands or at all events they were without settled institutions, as our Courts here and the Privy Council in England have held. In either view the Colonists brought with them as part of their baggage the Common Law of England, which is the birth-right of every subject and is portable property. But they carried with them only so much of the English law as was applicable to their own situation and to the conditions and wants of the inhabitants of the new Settlements. Furthermore in applying such law as was so applicable the Courts had to modify it to suit the above circumstances.\n\nA part of the Common Law so imported into the new Settlements was the Statute of Distributions which regulates the distribution of the estate of an intestate amongst his next of kin and it is in connection with the application of this Statute to the Chinese race that the Courts in their reported decisions have considered the Chinese institution of marriage.\n\nThis Statute (22 and 23 Car: 2. c. 10) was passed by a Christian legislature for a Christian people and doubtless without any thought of its ever being applied to non-Christian peoples but from the time that the English became a colonizing race and the principles of the Common Law as applying to our new territories became settled our Courts and lawyers held that the English laws of inheritance were part of the general law applicable to the new plantations; as to which Blackstone is clear. The Statute of Distributions had, therefore, to be applied by the Judges in Penang and Singapore to the non-Christian and polygamous races in the Settlements over which their jurisdiction extended.\n\nNow, the Statute contemplated marriage only in its Christian sense, that is to say, \"the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others\", to use Lord Penzance's classic definition in Hyde v Hyde and Woodmansee, L. R. 1 P. & D. 133. Further polygamy had always been considered by the jurists as outside the pale of Christian Courts and international comity, as to which more will be said later. How then were the Courts of the Colony to apply this Statute based on monogamy to a state of polygamy?\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nHere was a Statute which spoke of one wife and gave to her a share in her intestate husband's estate; here was a Statute which, by common legal consent, when it spoke of children meant in England legitimate children to the exclusion of bastards and adopted children. How was such a Statute to be applied to the estate of a Chinese who died leaving a principal wife (t'sai) and several secondary wives (t'sip)? How was it to be applied to the adopted son of a Chinese when such a son by Chinese law and custom was as much legitimate as one born of the flesh? These and others were the knotty points which for the past hundred years the Courts of this Colony have had to settle and it is the purpose of this article to show from their recorded decisions how they have done so and how they have sought to justify themselves in so doing.\n\nPenang was founded in 1786 and became a separate Presidency in 1805; in 1807 the Crown granted to it a Charter of Justice, which the lawyers here commonly call the first Charter. In 1819 Singapore was founded and in 1826 the Crown granted a second Charter of Justice to the two Settlements and to Malacca. These Charters contained clauses directing the Courts to have regard to the several religions, manners and customs of the inhabitants, and in particular to exercise their ecclesiastical jurisdiction only so far as such religions, manners and customs would permit.\n\nIn considering the question of the distribution of the estates of Chinese intestates our Judges had, therefore, to bear in mind the words of the Charters as well as the general common law rule which required them to modify English laws to suit the condition of the inhabitants of the Settlements. There was also a further principle by which one at least of them allowed himself to be guided, that of international comity.\n\nWith these preliminary observations it will be possible now to pursue our main subject.\n\nIn 1843, sitting at Malacca, Sir William Norris (Recorder, 1836-1847) held that the adopted son and daughter of an intestate Chinese (who left behind him no widow or widows apparently) were jointly entitled to letters of administration to his estate in preference to his lawful nephew and that the assets were to be divided between them to the exclusion of the lawful nephew. Sir William based his decision upon the Charter of which he took the same view as had been expressed by Sir Benjamin Malkin (Recorder, 1833-1835) in the case of In the goods of Abdullah, 1835, 2 Ky. Ec. 8, where Sir Benjamin observed \"In the general expression the Charter seems to have intended to give a certain degree of protection and indulgence to the various nations resorting here, not very clearly defined, yet perhaps easily enough applied in particular cases, but not generally to sanction or recognize their law.\"\n\nWe have to wait until 1858 for the next recorded decision. In that year Sir Benson Maxwell (Recorder, 1856-1866; Chief\nJustice, 1867-1871), unaware of the above decision, decided that an adopted child was not entitled to share. In the course of his monumental judgment in Regina vs. Willans, 3 Journ. Ind. Archip. 41, and 3 Ky. 16, he reconsiders his decision in the light of Sir William Norris' view with which however he still disagrees. The law is now definitely settled as Sir Benson Maxwell held it and the final recorded decision is that of Sir Theodore Ford in 1877 in Khoo Tiang Bee et uxor vs. Tan Beng Gwat, 1 Ky. 413.\n\nIn Regina v Willans Sir Benson Maxwell went into the question of the recognition by our Courts of Asiatic laws and customs very fully. The following passages, perhaps, illustrate his views sufficiently:\n\n\"The law of England, wheresoever administered, respects, either ex comitate or ex debito justitiae, the religions and usages of strange sects and nations to the extent to which the Charter requires that they shall be respected.\"\n\n\"It does not seem to me that the Charter has in any respect modified the law of England by any exceptional adaptation of it to the religions and usages of the East.\"\n\n\"Thus if a Mahomedan or Hindoo or Chinese marriage, celebrated here according to the religious ceremonies of the parties, be valid, it is not because the Charter makes it so for, as I have already observed, it makes no exception in favour of native contracts of any kind\u2014but because the law of England recognizes it.\"\n\nHe then points out that the general rule of that law is that the validity of a marriage is to be determined by the lex loci celebrationis and cites a passage from the judgment of Lord Stowell in Dalrymple v Dalrymple, 2 Hagg.: 59.\n\n\"But where the law of the place is inapplicable to the parties, by reason of peculiarities of religious opinions and usages, then from a sort of moral necessity, the validity of the marriage depends on whether it was performed according to the rites of their religion.\"\n\n\"In this place where the law of England has been for the first time brought to bear upon races among whom polygamy has been established from the remotest antiquity, the Court has had to consider the question, and has always held polygamous marriages valid. Whether the local Judicature erred, or not, in coming to this decision, I do not stop to consider. It is enough to say that if it decided rightly, it is not because our Charter demands an exceptionally indulgent treatment of the question, but simply because the principle which makes the validity of a marriage to depend upon the religions of the parties, extends to polygamous marriages; while, if the Court has been wrong, it has erred, not in adopting a principle foreign to, and at variance with the law of England, but in stretching beyond its legitimate limits, a perfectly well established one.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nSir Benson, then, justified the recognition of polygamy in the Colony on the grounds of international comity and how bold and vigorous a decision that was will be seen when the state of legal opinion in England at the time (1858) is examined. Great writers on international law such as Kent, Burge and Story, put polygamy outside the pale of the comity of Christian nations without qualification, as did all the recorded decisions of the English Courts up to that time.\n\nIn 1861 Sir Benson Maxwell had an interesting Chinese case before him in Penang, the case of Nonia Cheah Yew vs. Othmansaw Merican and anor, 1 Ky. 160, in which he held that a Chinese female in this Colony is at liberty to marry, after being divorced from her former husband, notwithstanding that no guardian was present at such second marriage, the law of China to the contrary not being applicable to this Colony.\n\nIn Sir Benson\u2019s judgment he holds that by the law of China to render a second union a marriage there must be a person to give the woman away to the new husband and a delivery of marriage presents; otherwise it was considered simply as a case of concubinage.\n\n\u201cIf this rule were in force here, it was plain that the marriage set up could not be sustained, for the plaintiff admitted that neither her uncle, the head of the family, nor any one else, gave her away. But the rule could not be held essential here under English law, where a very different degree of liberty and respect was accorded to women than in China or other parts of the East. In China a woman appeared to be, as in India, in a state of perpetual tutelage, and to be either under a general incapacity to contract, or to have no right to dispose of her person as she pleased. The necessity of giving away was not so much a part of the ceremony, as a consequence of the general law relating to the status of a woman. But here this must be determined by the English and not by the Chinese law.\u201d\n\nThe Recorder went on further to find that as a matter of fact no second ceremony of marriage took place at all, apart from the question of its legality.\n\nThe first part of the decision involved Sir Benson in a strange departure from the principle of comity which he had laid down in Regina vs. Willans. If the marriage was bad according to Chinese law, how could it have been valid according to the English Common Law?\n\nChinese law and custom, however, are rejected by the Court and an artificial creation substituted.\n\nThe above is the only recorded case in which the question of divorce amongst the Chinese has arisen. In it the judgment shows that a divorce paper was produced in evidence but how, or even if, the divorce was proved to have been valid according to Chinese law the report is quite silent.\nIn 1867 Sir Benson gave his famous decision in the case of In the goods of Lao Leong An, W.O.C. 35, 1 S.S.L.R. 1, in which he decided that the secondary wife (t'sip) of a Chinese intestate was entitled to an equal share of the intestate\u2019s property with the principal wife (t'sai).\n\nIn that case it was urged in resisting the claim of the secondary wife (t'sip) that her condition was not that of a wife but a concubine, that is to say, that her status was not a legal one at all and that she was without legal rights at all; a mere mistress, indeed. Sir Benson over-ruled the contention and held that she was a lawful spouse. He arrived at this result from a perusal of Sir George Staunton\u2019s translation of the Chinese Penal Code. It is unnecessary to go into his reasoning here as the matter will be dealt with later.\n\nFor forty years the Courts acted on this decision and it remained unchallenged until the famous Six Widows\u2019 case. Before turning to that case there are, however, one or two other decisions of the Court that need short consideration.\n\nIn 1887 in the case of Lee Joo Neo vs. Lee Eng Swee, 4 Ky: 325, Sir John Goldney held that in distributing the estate of a Chinese dying intestate domiciled in the Colony and leaving property in it, the Statute of Distributions is the only rule, and the exclusion of females in sharing in such estate according to Chinese law and custom will not be recognized.\n\nIt will be convenient, therefore, to observe here that the law of this Colony as it now stands gives to the widows, principal and secondary, the widow\u2019s share under the Statute to divide equally amongst them, whereas Chinese law would give them merely a right to maintenance. Again under Chinese law female next of kin are excluded, save in exceptional circumstances, from any share in the estate, though they may have claims to maintenance, whereas by the law of this Colony they take equally with males.\n\nOur law is, therefore, very clearly neither English nor Chinese law but a mixture of the two.\n\nIn 1890 the question was raised in Penang before Mr. Justice Wood in the case of Regina vs Yeok Boon Leng, 4 Ky: 630, as to whether a Chinese could be convicted of bigamy. The accused was acquitted because the prosecution omitted to bring evidence that by Chinese law or custom the second marriage was void by reason of its taking place in the lifetime of the first wife.\n\nIn 1901 the same question arose at Malacca in the case of The King vs Sim Boon Lip, 7 S.S.L.R. 4, with most unfortunate results to the accused who was sentenced to three months\u2019 simple imprisonment. The accused was at first acquitted before Sir Archibald Law by a majority of four to three, but this majority being insufficient, a new trial was ordered which duly came on before Sir William Hyndman-Jones. It would appear, though it is not\nexpressly so stated in the report, that the accused took a second t'sai or principal wife in the lifetime of the first. By Chinese law this offence is punishable with ninety blows of the bamboo and the lady must be returned to her parents. The Acting Consul General for China at that time gave evidence that the second marriage was illegal according to Chinese law.\n\nThe conviction was most unsatisfactory and the defence of the accused would not seem to have been conducted too skilfully though very possibly the report does not do justice to the counsel concerned.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the custom in Penang, according to sworn evidence recorded in the Supreme Court there, is that a Chinese can have a t'sai in Penang provided his other t'sai is in China. The Penang t'sai would then be called a peng t'sai.\n\nThere are no other reported decisions on the law of bigamy as applicable to the Chinese but the present position in this regard can only be considered as very unsatisfactory.\n\nWe come now to the great Six Widows' Case as it is commonly called from the fact that in it six women claimed to be the lawful widows of the late Mr. Choo Eng Choon, a very wealthy and well-known Chinese gentleman, who was a British-born subject and domiciled in the Colony. The case is reported in Volume XII of the Straits Settlements Law Reports, where it occupies one hundred and six pages; it lasted from October 1905 to June 1909.\n\nA determined attack was made on the settled law of the Colony by counsel for the son of the deceased by his first t'sai, and by counsel for a second t'sai whom the deceased married after the death of his first. The settled law was upheld by counsel (of whom the writer was one) for the women who claimed merely to be t'sips; and the attack upon it was over-ruled by Sir Archibald Law on appeal from Mr. Registrar Velge's findings, and by Sir William Hyndman-Jones and Sir Thomas Braddell on appeal from Sir Archibald Law.\n\nFor the sake of convenience the unsuccessful parties will be called the appellants, though before Sir Archibald Law all the parties concerned were appealing, and in the Court of Appeal several of them.\n\nThe first main argument put forward by the appellants was that the Chinese are not a polygamous race and that the expression polygamy imports an equality amongst the wives. They called a somewhat formidable array of expert witnesses amongst whom were Messrs. Tso Ping Sing, Consul-General for China, Suen Sze Ting, Acting Consul-General for China, and Lo Tseng Yao, a former Acting Consul-General for China.\n\nThe views of these three gentlemen may be summed up as follows and undoubtedly accord with a strong body of opinion amongst the educated Chinese of this Colony at the present moment.\n(1) According to the law of China a man can have only one lawful wife;\n(2) If the husband is of official rank, she is entitled to official honour through her husband;\n(3) The proofs of a legal marriage according to Chinese law are the three marriage documents, the six stages of the marriage ceremonies, the go-between and the fetching of the bride from her guardian's house in procession accompanied by a band;\n(4) In addition to his wife a man can take as many concubines as he pleases;\n(5) A concubine is only entitled to official honour through her sons but not through the father of her children who is not her husband but her lord and master;\n(6) A concubine may be purchased with money without any ceremony at all.\n\nThis seemed strong evidence that the Chinese are monogamous, but as Sir William Hyndman-Jones in his judgment said \"however great the respect we may have for the opinions of the Chinese gentlemen who have given evidence upon the subject\u2014all of them, excepting one, holding high official rank and one of them Mr. Lo Tseng Yao, being not only a high official of his own country and versed in its laws, but also, as I understand, a barrister-at-law of the Inner Temple\u2014I say however great a respect we may entertain for the views of these gentlemen, we cannot allow them to decide this question for us. On the contrary, it is our duty to consider the position which the law of China has given to these women so far as we can gather it from all the sources above indicated and in the light of that law and having regard to the position and being aided but not restricted by the evidence to which I have referred, decide for ourselves the question whether the Chinese as a race are monogamous or polygamous.\"\n\nIn addition to the oral evidence of the experts, a large mass of written evidence was used in the course of the case in the shape of books and treaties upon Chinese law and custom.\n\nIt may be said at once that every Judge who has ever sat on the Bench of this Colony has, so far as is known, held the Chinese to be polygamous and so treated them. What these Chinese gentlemen who gave evidence overlooked was that the Chinese law gave to the women whom they called concubines a very definite legal status, not as high as that of the tsai or principal wife it is true but such as to show that they stood in a very different position to that of mere mistresses or the subjects of casual connections.\n\nThere was, further, an even more important point which these gentlemen overlooked. The children of the tsip are legitimate according to Chinese law and share with the children of the tsai in their father's estate. How then are you to regard an union as\nillicit when the offspring of it are legitimate? To declare the union of a Chinese with his tsip as being outside the pale of the law of the Colony would be to bastardise a large proportion of Chinese born in the Colony, and to deprive of all rights numbers of women, most of whom have devoted years of their lives to the men with whom they lived.\n\nTaking all the facts concerning the position of the tsip into consideration Sir Benson Maxwell's view that they were lawful wives was upheld on reasoning similar to his. Sir William Hyndman-Jones summed the position up thus:\n\n\"I have already said that in the diversity of opinion before us we must decide the question of monogamy or polygamy mainly by a consideration of the position which the law assigns to these women: and it appears to me that when you find that concubinage is not only tolerated by the law but recognised as a legal institution, then concubinage ceases to be that which Western nations are accustomed to understand by that name and becomes polygamy.\"\n\nThe argument that polygamy imports equality amongst the wives was quite unsupported by authority and over-ruled. Indeed there was a clear English authority against it, the strange case of Christopher Bethell which may be considered with regard to this argument as well as with regard to the second main argument of the appellants namely that if the Chinese are polygamous then, as English Courts cannot recognise polygamy for any purposes, the Courts of this Colony cannot recognise their union at all.\n\nIn dealing with Regina vs Williams it was pointed out that up to the date of that case, 1858, all jurists put polygamy outside the pale of Christian nations. It is now necessary to see how the law in England had dealt with the matter between 1858 and the time when the Six Widows' Case was being argued.\n\nIt is obvious that in England a marriage might come before a matrimonial Court or might come before a Court which had merely to decide on rights arising out of the marriage. The English matrimonial Courts are purely Christian Courts and their machinery and weapons are only intended for use in dealing with monogamous unions; it is obvious that they would withdraw from any consideration of a polygamous union as between the parties to it. Whether the rest of the English Courts would refuse to adjudicate in any circumstances upon the rights of the issue of a polygamous union is another matter and as yet unsettled.\n\nIn 1866, in the case of Hyde v Hyde and Woodmansee, already referred to, a Mormon husband filed a petition for dissolution of his marriage on the ground of adultery. Lord Penzance said that it was obvious that the matrimonial law of England was adapted to the Christian marriage and wholly inapplicable to polygamy. In rejecting the prayer of the petition on this ground he was careful to add at the end of his judgment these words \"this Court does not profess to decide upon the rights of succession or...\"\nlegitimacy which it might be proper to accord to the issue of the polygamous unions nor upon the rights or obligations in relation to third persons which people living under the sanction of such unions may have created for themselves. All that is intended to be here decided is that as between each other they are not entitled to the remedies, the adjudication, or the relief of the matrimonial law of England.\"\n\nThe only case in which the rights of the offspring of a polygamous union have come before the English Courts is that of In re Bethell, Bethell v Hildyard, L.R. 28 Ch. Div. 220, but unfortunately in that case counsel for the issue of the union made the admission that if the union was held to be polygamous there was an end to his client's case. Again, as will be seen, it was not a case of two members of a polygamous race marrying according to their own rites but of an English Christian making a union with a woman of a polygamous race.\n\nChristopher Bethell left England for the Cape of Good Hope in 1878 and never returned: he was killed in Bechuanaland fighting as a trooper in the mounted police in an encounter between his force and the Boers. In 1883 he had gone through a form of marriage at Mafeking according to the custom of the Baralong tribe with a girl named Teepoo by whom he had a child. As he was the legatee of property in England under his father's will it became necessary for the English Court of Chancery to decide whether in the eyes of the law of England this child was legitimate, and an enquiry by the Chief Clerk of the Court was ordered. This Official certified that the Baralongs had no religion nor any religious customs and that polygamy was allowed in that tribe. He also certified that Christopher Bethell's domicile at the time of his marriage was English.\n\nThe evidence before the Chief Clerk showed that amongst the Barolongs \"each male is allowed one great wife and several concubines who have almost the same status in the home as the great or principal wife\" and the chief of the tribe in his evidence said \"there are those who have two, three or four wives but the first is the principal wife.\"\n\nMr. Justice Stirling, as he then was, agreed that upon this evidence the Chief Clerk was right in finding that the Barolongs were polygamous: and he held that the law of England could not recognise the union. All the miserable infant got was its costs out of the estate! This is not the place to discuss the judgment, though it may be observed that the learned Judge held himself bound by the decisions of matrimonial Courts, in particular, by Hyde v. Hyde and Woodmansee, and that he made no mention of the saving clause already quoted at the end of the judgment in that case.\n\nThis case, however, was really the only one that the appellants in the Six Widows' Case could rely on as being in any way on all fours with the case which they were arguing.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nOn the other hand, in his work on Extraterritoriality Sir Francis Piggott, late Chief Justice of Hongkong and a jurist of considerable eminence, gives some very cogent reasoning to the effect that for the purposes of succession the English Courts would recognise the offspring of the union of, say, a Turkish man and woman as legitimate and entitled under the Statute of Distributions, while Professor Dicey regards the whole question as doubtful, certainly not as decided by Bethell's case or the matrimonial cases.\n\nThe Court of Appeal had little difficulty in over-ruling the appellants and they based their decision not on international comity, as Sir Benson Maxwell had done, but on the Charter, which he had refused to do. This charter was the third one of 1855.\n\nThe Six Widows' Case, however, added one new decision to the law relating to Chinese marriages. The Court held that a child legitimised per subsequens matrimonium according to Chinese law is legitimate and entitled to share in the two-thirds share which the Statute of Distributions gives to the children of a deceased intestate. In doing so the Court followed the well-known English case of In re Goodman's Trusts, L.R. 17 Ch. Div. 267, where a child similarly legitimised under Dutch law was held to be legitimate and entitled to share under the Statute in English property.\n\nIt now remains to notice the last two cases in the Colony, those of Ngai Lau Shia vs. Low Chee Neo in Singapore and Cheang Thye Phin vs. Tan Ah Loy in Penang, in both of which the author appeared as counsel for the claimant ladies, both here and in the Privy Council. Neither case is as yet locally reported but the decision of the Privy Council will be found in the Law Reports 1920 A.C. 369.\n\nNgai Lau Shia claimed to be a lawful daughter of the late Mr. Low Kim Pong, a wealthy Singapore merchant; she had attempted to prove a ceremony between the deceased and her mother as a tsai but the evidence was disbelieved. It was then argued on her behalf that her mother should be presumed to have been a tsip of the deceased from cohabitation and repute, in which she succeeded, the Court holding that such a presumption may be made upon proper evidence. It also decided that the Courts here will now take judicial notice of the fact that the Chinese are a polygamous race.\n\nTan Ah Loy claimed to be presumed to be a tsip of the late Mr. Cheang Ah Quee, the last Captain China of Perak. She failed to prove a ceremony of any sort and Mr. Registrar Gibson found against her, as he was unaware of the decision in Ngai Lau Shia's case and thought that the Six Widows' Case had decided that some ceremony was necessary to constitute a proper secondary marriage. Her claim was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council both of which held that no proof of a ceremony is essential, and presumed for her a marriage as a tsip from cohabitation and repute.\nIn the case of Ngai Lau Shia the scholarly pen of Mr. Justice Ebdon has illuminated and summed up the whole views of our Courts on the subject of Chinese secondary marriages; and an article such as this would be quite incomplete and ineffective without reprinting in it the following passage from his judgment.\n\n\"The Chinese equivalent of the English word \"marriage\" in its most careful sense is used only of the man and only with reference to his union with the t'sai, the principal wife, chosen for him by his father or by the person under whose patria potestas he happens to be.\n\n\"If the man enters on a second kit-fat union [full marriage] during the lifetime of his t'sai he is punishable with 100 blows of the bamboo (the usual instrument) and the union is null and void.\n\n\"The man who degrades a t'sai to the level of a t'sip or raises a t'sip to the level of a t'sai is punishable with 100 or 90 blows according to the respective offences, and the ladies in each case are to be replaced in the position to which they are originally entitled. The process of elevation or reduction is not defined but the provision indicates that the t'sip has some position from which she can be wrongly elevated and to which she can be reduced.\n\n\"The t'sai becomes a relative of her husband's family and a 'senior to be treated with respect.' The t'sip does not enjoy these privileges. She cannot share the man's honours. She can attain to honours only through her sons.\n\n\"A man having married a t'sai at his father's choice may buy or 'acquire' as many t'sips as he pleases at his own. The t'sai is chosen from his own rank: he may take his t'sips from a lower class. But the t'sip may not any more than the t'sai be taken from the Seh [family name] of the man.\n\n\"As to this the \"Book of Rites\" mentions an interesting injunction by Confucius:\u2014\n\n\"'In marrying a t'sai do not marry anyone of the same family name so as to make a distinction.\n\n\"'So in the purchase of a t'sip whose name is unknown find it out by divination.'\n\n\"This because the t'sip may be drawn from a class in which girls are the subject of barter and sale in their childhood with the result that her Seh may have been lost.\n\n\"The Manchu Code accepts the t'sip as having an established position in the Chinese family system and protects her in that position though it does not define it.\n\n\"Scholars and lexicographers have not hesitated to define the concubinage of the patriarchs as amounting to legitimate marriage though implying an inferior condition of the wife to whom the\nhusband does not convey his rank or quality: vide, e.g. definitions of 'concubine' and 'concubinage' in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary and in Wharton's Law Lexicon quoting John's Biblical Antiquities.\n\n\"If this view is true of the concubine of the Pentateuch it is certainly true of the t'sip. Abraham from motives of policy presented Sarai his wife, \"a fair woman to look upon\" as his sister to more than one royal suitor. The Pharaoh of the period met with great plagues in consequence\u2014Ahimelech of Gerar received timely warning \"in a dream by night.\"\n\n\"Under the Manchu Code Abraham would have received one hundred blows even for dealing by Hagar or Keturah his t'sips as he did by Sarai his wife.\n\n\"Again, if Staunton is right in his interpretation of section 116 of the Code, Abraham would have suffered castigation for his action in turning Hagar out into the wilderness merely to appease the jealousy of Sarai.\n\n\"Sentiment and the material feelings are doubtless often influences in the selection of a t'sip. The man's guardian chooses his t'sai. He chooses his t'sip for himself. There is a proverb to the effect that a t'sai is taken for her virtue, a t'sip for her beauty.\n\n\"But it seems to be fully accepted that the taking of a t'sip is authorised in order to the fulfilment of the dictates of filial piety which requires male issue for the purpose of ancestor worship.\n\n\"There does not seem to be any need to review what has been shown before the Courts on former occasions as to the status of the children of the t'sip. It is enough to say that in some respects there is no distinction drawn between them and the children of the t'sai while the sons of the t'sip have their place in the order of succession to the inheritance and to hereditary dignities. They also share, though not on equal terms, in the patrimony.\n\n\"Herr von Mollendorf has compared the unions of the t'sai and of the t'sip to connubium and concubinatus respectively. This may stand as a rough comparison. The union of the t'sai approaches justae nuptiae as nearly as the East can approach the West. But whereas the offspring of concubinatus did not come under the patria potestas except by process of legitimation, the offspring of the t'sip are subject to it as an incident of their birth.\n\n\"English law cannot conceive of varying degrees of legitimacy of birth or marriage. Birth can be either legitimate or illegitimate and the union between man and woman can be either lawful or illicit. There is no middle state. It does not seem possible to interpret the status of the children of the t'sip as anything but that of legitimate children. They are fully recognised. Nor does it seem possible to hold that children whom we must accept as legitimate can have sprung from an union which remains illicit,\"\n\"China is a land of general inversion according to Western ideas. In the West legitimacy of offspring depends on the lawful character of the union from which they come.\n\n\"Conversely, the offspring of the t'sip being recognised as legitimate, the union from which they come must be regarded as lawful.\n\n\"English law again does not recognise any intermediate system between monogamy and polygamy and I cannot see how it is open to us to attribute to the t'sip any status than that of a polygamous wife.\"\n\nIt will be seen, then, that English law has been mated by our Judges to Chinese law and from the union a half-caste offspring has resulted. It is no fault of the Judges; they have had the almost impossible task of welding Eastern ideas into Western law. What they have done has resulted in very fair justice and those who readily clamour for legislation on the subject of Chinese marriages would do well to remember that several of the best lawyers we have had here have tried their hands on the subject and dropped it. The plain unvarnished fact that governs the whole matter is that the views of the Chinese of this Colony are so very divergent that legislation is practically impossible.\n\nIn the Federated Malay States Chinese custom is alone observed but, then, the common law of England does not run there, as it does here.\n\nIn conclusion it may be observed that the Manchu Code (Ta Ching Lu Li), the most comprehensive source for Western students of Chinese Law, was promulgated in 1647 by the Chinese Justinian, the Emperor Shun Chi. It consists of the Lu, corresponding to the first three parts of Justinian's Pandects, and the Li, answering to that Emperor's Novellae. It was to the Lu, as translated by Sir George Staunton and published in London in 1810, that our Courts have gone chiefly for their information. Staunton was, as is well known, an attach\u00e9 of the first British diplomatic mission to China in 1793. Practically no epitome of Chinese law has appeared since his work.\n\nLastly it must be remembered always that in the Chinese mind law (lu li) and general custom (kuei chu) are mixed up and cannot be separated. Chinese family law, in particular, is not purely a matter of law but includes a large number of general usages.\n\nThe difficulties which our Courts have had to overcome cannot be understated and the writer can speak with very personal feeling as to the difficulty in arriving at the precise Chinese law on any subject that presents itself to any one who can neither read nor speak the Chinese language.\nOdoardo Beccari.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill and J. C. Moulton.\n\nAt the age of seventy-seven, on October 26th, 1920, Odoardo Beccari, the great naturalist and traveller, died unexpectedly of heart failure in Florence.\n\nBeccari obtained a degree in the Natural Sciences at the University of Bologna in 1864; and immediately after that met in Genoa the Marquis Giacomo Doria, already a traveller of note: there they planned together the first of Beccari's four journeys to the wonderful East.\u2014Beccari the botanist, and Doria the zoologist. The preparations for it took Beccari to London, and caused the commencement of his life-long connection with Kew. The two explorers set out in April, 1865, spent a short time in Ceylon, and reached Sarawak in June via Singapore, thereby starting Beccari's fifteen years of busy collecting and travelling. It is well before anything else to state whither those years took him:\u2014(1) in Sarawak with Doria until March, 1866, when the latter's health gave way, and in Sarawak alone to January, 1868: (2) in Eritrea in the company of the Marquis O. Antinori from February to October, 1870: (3) eastwards again, to New Guinea from November, 1871, with L. M. D'Albertis, who like Doria broke down; in the Aru and Kei islands from February to September, 1873; in Celebes to June, 1874: in the Moluccas to January, 1875: in Dutch New Guinea to March, 1876: and then back to Florence in July of the same year: (4) in 1877 across India to Australia and New Zealand with E. D'Albertis; and parting in Java at Batavia in 1878, alone for a final exploration in southern Sumatra.\n\nThe wealth of the material got upon these travels was enormous: his first journey resulted in 20,000 botanical specimens representing 3,300 species of the Higher Plants, in a collection of 800 fruits in spirit, in a big collection of timber samples, and in his 48 orang-utans: his collections from Eritrea ran to 600 numbers; and his later collections were upon the same scale, both botanical, zoological and ethnological. This vast store, so much of it got together in the Dutch Indies, the Government of the Netherlands, it is said, wished to buy: but Beccari preferred that it should go to Italy, whence he distributed his duplicates liberally. The botanical and ethnological parts now lie at Florence, and the zoological part at Genoa.\n\nIntrepid, and yet very wise in his dealings with the wild tribes, Beccari wandered almost alone where few white men have been able to go. His visit to the Kapuas region of central Borneo is a case in point; his climbing of the Arfak mountains in New Guinea\nwith five natives another: and his penetration of southern Sumatra a third. When, and in a large part where he travelled, head-hunting was among the inhabitants an honourable pastime. In Sumatra he discovered the Aroid, *Amorphophallus Titanum*,\u2014the tuber so heavy that it required two men to carry it. In Borneo it was his wont to fell the enormous Dipterocarps and other forest trees, that the material which he collected might be perfect. He never missed an opportunity of collecting and though Singapore was to him but the means of getting into the wilder lands, he collected not a little in the island.\n\nRepatriating himself finally in 1880, Beccari settled down in Florence to study his immense collections, and to publish his results, his home an old castle, and his way of living very simple. There he married: and three sons fought for the Allies in the Great War.\n\nIn the first short interval between his expeditions, he had founded the *Nuovo Giornale botanico Italiano*, which is still published as the organ of the Societa botanica Italiano. On his return from his second expedition to the Far East he commenced his \"Malesia,\" being essays on groups of interesting Malayan plants, beautifully illustrated, by his own pencil, the cost of reproduction met in part by means of a grant from the Bentham Trustees in London: the first volume appeared at Genoa in 1877, the second from 1884 to 1886 and the third from 1886 to 1890. In 1892 he was occupied jointly with Sir Joseph Hooker in monographing the Indian palms for the *Flora of British India*. In 1902 he published his *Nelle foreste di Borneo*, which was translated into English (1904) by Dr. E. H. Giglioli in a somewhat modified form under the title of \"Wanderings in the Great Forests of Borneo.\" In 1908 and 1914 the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, published his two magnificent monographs upon the rattan-palms. The plates for these were executed from photographs taken by Beccari with the use of an ingenious apparatus for removing shadows. In 1912 he monographed the palms of Madagascar for the Museum of Natural History in Paris. He published many smaller works, chiefly in the journal *Webbia*, and for the most part upon palms.\n\nIt is significant of this\u2014his great interest\u2014that *Malesia* opens with an account of the palms of New Guinea, and with the words \"a predilection for the plants of this family has made me on all occasions to ensure that they should be represented in my collections by complete specimens........and that I should always re-\n\n---\n\n1 This great tuber reached Marseilles alive, but perished there because of the inflexibility of the laws against importing living plants. Beccari, however, had sent seeds to his friend the Marquis Corsi Salvatori; and the huge herb flowered at Kew from them in 1889, eleven years from the date of Beccari's finding it.\n\n2 George Bentham, co-author with Sir Joseph Hooker in the great *Genera Plantarum*, bequeathed in 1884 a sum of money for the provision of illustrations to botanical works.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 83, 1921.\ncord their appearance alive.\" After this essay on palms come others on various natural groups of plants, selected in each case with the idea of clearing ground where the difficulties lay thick. The second volume of *Malesia* is occupied by his classical essay entitled \"Pianti ospitatrici,\" that is plants which provide hostels (for ants, etc.). The third renews the subject of the Palms, and is like the first, a series of systematic studies in difficult groups of plants.\n\nHe prefaced his essay on \"Plants which provide hostels\" by a discussion upon the part stimulation or irritation by insects could have had in calling into existence characters now inherited, such as hollow stems and hollow tubers, eminently prepared as it were, for the insects to occupy them. In this his views were Lamarckian,\u2014that is to say he accepted Lamarck's \"inheritance of acquired characters\" as a working force in the shaping of this world. Such views have long been unacceptable to the majority of workers on Evolution: but he set them forth again in his *Nelle Foreste di Borneo* where the possibility of the pull of river currents in giving submerged leaves length that becomes ultimately inherited, is among further illustrations one of the more striking.\n\nDeath found him engaged in preparing for the press his New Guinea diaries; and in putting the last touches to two further monographs of palms, one on the Lepidocaryae in English, and the other on the Areceae in Italian. These monographs are likely to be published shortly. A third on the Borassineae was left somewhat advanced.\n\nIt is intended in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, to make, with palms first described by Beccari a small avenue as a memorial to this great naturalist, who ever since Singapore had a botanic department has been a frequent correspondent, and was always ready to give the assistance of his profound knowledge.\n\nI. H. Burkill.\n\nIn the foregoing pages Mr. Burkill has summarized the travels which occupied the earlier years of Beccari's manhood and the botanical work which filled the remainder of his life. But it is as no ordinary traveller or worthy botanical systematist that his name will live or indeed that he himself lived. For an insight into the true nature of the man one must read his \"Wanderings in the Great Forests of Borneo\"\u2014a veritable Natural History epic, replete with a mass of most varied observations, original and inspiring theories, and as the narrative of a born naturalist, worthy to rank with the more widely read nature-diaries of Darwin, Wallace, Bates or Belt.\n\nThis book appeared first in 1902 in Italian under the title of \"Nelle foreste di Borneo.\" The English edition, translated by Dr. E. H. Giglioli and F. H. Guillemand and enlarged or other-\n\n---\n\n3 The well-known naturalist, author of the \"Cruise of the Marchesa,\" and himself a traveller of no mean repute in Borneo some twenty years after Beccari.\nwise modified by Beccari was published in 1904. It is dedicated to \"Marquis Doria, Macaenas of naturalists,\" and the dedication is perhaps the clearest indication of the happy conditions under which Beccari commenced his wanderings abroad. The solitary traveller misses much\u2014Guillemard in his editorial note says \"What would I not have given for the companionship in my journeys of so skilled a botanist and so enthusiastic a nature-lover as the author of this volume.\" One can imagine the keen enthusiasm and abounding energy of youth: the interest in everything so new, the questions and problems which crowded in on Beccari at every turn, and then, beside him, Doria, the trained naturalist-explorer companion, whose maturer views and sound reasoning must have served as a wonderfully safe guide to useful observation and as an ever-present stimulus to further research on steady lines into the wonders of Nature, just as no doubt Beccari's own youthful enthusiasm and fertile imagination must have kindled anew the keenness of his older companion.\n\nSmall wonder then that under these conditions his diaries are so full of varied and suggestive information. The lapse of some 40 years between those days and the time of writing his book was an advantage in that he has allowed the wisdom of later years to develop and modify the immature reasonings of his youth; but at the same time none of the freshness of a narrative written on the spot is lost.\n\nAs is well known, Wallace's essay on Natural Selection, which was read before the Linnean Society in conjunction with Darwin's essay in 1858, was written at Ternate. It is, however, not so often remembered that his earlier essay on the Origin of Species, which may be said to have foreshadowed that of 1858, was written at Santubong, Sarawak, three years before. We may be sure too that this problem must have received many hours of careful thought during his four weeks stay on Mt. Serambu in Upper Sarawak. Just as Galapagos and Ternate will share the fame of being the birthplaces of the Darwin-Wallace Theory of Natural Selection, so too should Sarawak be remembered as the germinating ground, so far as Wallace was concerned, for this remarkable Theory.\n\nIt is therefore of particular interest to read of Beccari's visits to Santubong and Serambu just ten years after Wallace. He too formulated a theory of his own in regard to the formation of species, one, however, which has failed to find the same general acceptance as has that of his famous predecessor. He believed in the theory \"that the environment, in the widest sense of the word, has been the most powerful and principal agent in causing animals, as well as plants, to assume their present form and structure;\" that the organized \"beings now living have been originated through the action exerted on them by the external world,\" and that species are \"merely the result of a plasmative force exerted by surroundings on primitive beings.\" He did not believe in the present variability of species in Nature, but returned to the opposite and long-\nheld idea \"of the nearly absolute fixity of existing species.\" In support of this idea he held that heredity today is the great obstacle in the transmission of individual variations. To fit in this idea with a theory of evolution he postulated an early \"plasmative\" period in the history of the world, when exactly opposite conditions prevailed. During this plasmative period or in the \"primordial epoch of life,\" as he also terms it, the power of adaptation and response to environment was great, while heredity was correspondingly feeble: \"the further we go back towards the origin of life the less strong it must have been, is only a logical sequitur of the admitted strength of the force heredity now exerts.\"\n\nHis views on the origin of Man are of particular interest. When he was in London in 1865 Sir Charles Lyell, the great geologist, urged Beccari to explore the caves of Borneo for fossil remains. He argued that just as all the fossil mammals yet found in Australia are marsupials, which Order predominates in Australia today, so too in Borneo where anthropoid apes now live, one would probably discover the remains of some extinct species belonging to the same Order and perhaps taking us back a stage nearer to the ape-like common ancestor of man and apes. The interesting fossil remains of a primitive type of man from Java, known as Pithecanthropus erectus, had not then been discovered.\n\nSir Charles Lyell died in 1875. Three years later a \"Borneo Caves Exploration Committee\" was formed under the presidency of Mr. John Evans, F.R.S.; grants from the Royal Society and the British Association were given. A distinguished naturalist, A. H. Everett, for many years a member of this Society and contributor to its Journal, was entrusted with the work. The results of his exploration of Bornean Caves were published in our Journal No. 6, December 1880. Although interesting fossils were found, none threw any light on the early history of man.\n\nBeccari's view was that it was \"very improbable that primitive Man can have originated in the eminently forestal region to which Borneo belongs, a region which could not only never have promoted any aptitude for running or bipedal progression, but also could never have made him feel the need of a terrestrial (as opposed to an arboreal) existence.\"\n\nHe argued further that the ancestor of the orang-utan was terrestrial, not arboreal, and that it reached Borneo from regions less covered by trees. \"Thus the orang-utans in Borneo would have diverged from the old anthropoid type instead of approximating to it, and in this case the orang would be, not a progenitor, but a collateral of man.\"\n\nBeccari's many-sided inquiries suggest the delightful, restless, inquisitive mind of boyhood. The call of the mountains was naturally irresistible to such a temperament. Just exactly what is the actual attraction in climbing mountains seems difficult to\ndefine. It is undoubtedly very real. Beccari suggests among other things contributing to the pleasure of it is \"the sensation of exultation at having reached the upper dominating regions of the atmosphere, and vanquished Nature which has tied man down to the earth. Or it may be,\" he continues, \"that our gratification is merely the outcome of those ambitious feelings which spur on so many to endeavour to rise above their fellows.\" But can we go no further than this?\n\nSir Martin Conway, a great traveller and inveterate mountain-lover, perhaps touches the secret when he writes:\n\n\"At such times Nature gathers her lover unto herself, transforming his self-consciousness into consciousness of her. The landscape becomes the visible garment of a great personality whereof he himself is a part. Ceasing to think, while Nature addresses him through every sense, he receives direct inspiration from her. The passage of time is forgotten in such nirvana, and bliss is approximated if not attained.\"\n\nThe mountains of Borneo run to no great height and offer no great difficulty in climbing as a rule. But the fascination of attaining their summits is the same. The pleasure of standing on the top of Snowden 3,000 ft.,\u2014even though one may have been conveyed thither by the mountain railway!\u2014is much the same as that experienced in reaching the top of, say, Mt. Kinabalu, 13,455 ft., the highest point in Borneo\u2014in fact the highest in all Indo-Malaya, from the Himalaya to New Guinea.\n\nBeccari climbed many mountains in Sarawak: Matang (3,050 ft.), Santubong (2,650 ft.), Poi (5,600 ft.), Wa (4,000 ft.), close to Penrissen, Tiang Laju (4,000 ft.), Lingga (3,000 ft.). Those who have had the good fortune to follow Beccari's footsteps to the summits of these mountains have compared, and no doubt will continue to compare, with keen interest the notes he made thereon now over 50 years ago. The Journals of this Society contain descriptions of subsequent explorations of some of these mountains.\n\nThe ascent of mountains within easy reach evidently did not satisfy his appetite for exploration. An account of his travels in Sarawak would not be complete without mentioning a remarkable journey he made from Bintulu, at that time the northern boundary of Sarawak, right across the whole State of Sarawak to Kuching the capital, a distance of some 300 miles. This he did in 1867 starting from Bintulu on September 15th and arriving in Kuching on November 20th. His route lay up the Bintulu river across to Belaga, down the Rejang River to Sibu, thence across country to Simanggang, Banting and Kuching.\n\n---\n\n4 Mountain Memories by Sir Martin Conway, pp. 217-218.\n5 Mt.

Soc., No. 83, 1921.\nAnother interesting excursion he made was up the Batang Lupar River to its source and across the Dutch border to the lakes on the great Kapuas river.\n\nAlthough his book is rich in botanical notes, as Mr. Burkill has already mentioned in this article, the large zoological collections and notes he made testify to the wide interest he took in every phase of Nature. His reptile collection from Borneo contained 88 species, of which 19 were new to science. His collection of bird-skins totalled some 800, representing 226 species. The orang-utans particularly interested him; he collected no less than 48. To pick out a selection of his more interesting zoological notes is a difficult task. To illustrate the variety of his notes one may refer the reader to his description of the \"sumpitan fish\" which gains its insect food by squirting a jet of water at them; the edible birds nests; the symbiosis of ants and \"hospitating\" plants such as *Nepenthes*; the cause of eyespots on the wings of pheasants and butterflies.\n\nHis notes on the natives of the country, their origin, customs, languages, etc. are equally varied.\n\nBeccari tells us in the introduction to his book that if it had not been for a happy chance that led to his meeting the Ranee of Sarawak in Florence, who urged him to the task, he would never have put together the notes of his youthful travels for publication after the lapse of some 40 years. He dedicates his book to the Ranee, and it is thus to that talented lady that we owe this intensely interesting narrative of Bornean life, besides her own delightful book on Sarawak also written many years after her last visit to that country.\u2076\n\nBeccari visited Sarawak first during the reign of the first White Rajah, Sir James Brooke, who at the time however was in England where he spent the last five years of his life. His nephew, Charles Brooke, then Tuan Muda, practically assumed the reins of Government in 1863, although he did not become Rajah until the death of his uncle in 1868. The remarkable policy laid down by the first Rajah and so faithfully carried out by his nephew the late Rajah over a long period of 54 years excited Beccari's warmest admiration, as indeed it has in many other writers. This policy was to rule the country for the benefit of its people. The advantages to be derived by foreigners settling in the country under the Rajah's flag, were a secondary consideration. I cannot do better than quote Beccari's remarks. He revisited Sarawak at the end of 1877 and found that his earlier favourable impressions of the Brooke rule were fully confirmed:\n\n\"The Rajah considers himself the father of his people, who have all his thought and care, and he does his utmost to lead his subjects along the road of progress and civilisation, though without sudden or violent changes, to which he is ab-\n\n\u2076 *My Life in Sarawak*, by the Ranee of Sarawak.\nsolutely opposed on principle. He has no wish that the country he rules should be taken advantage of by unscrupulous speculators of European nationalities for their own special benefit alone... Any honest trader, and better still any able agriculturist, who earnestly wishes to deal well with the natives, may always be sure of a hearty welcome in the dominions of Rajah Brooke.\n\n\"The Rajah's Government is eminently impartial towards the many and varied races it has to rule. In Sarawak all religions are tolerated and equally protected... And on his part, the second European Rajah of Sarawak, devoted to the sole task of increasing the welfare of his native subjects, by directing the energy of the Dyaks and Kayans towards peaceful avocations, by favouring Chinese immigration, and by developing trade and encouraging agriculture has given to the country he rules a prosperity which could hardly have been hoped for, when one looks back at the condition of Sarawak prior to the advent of the Brookes.\"\n\nThe death of Beccari removes one of the last connecting links with the period of Sarawak's romantic up-hill struggle against difficulties of every conceivable kind. His name will live in the annals of that country together with the names of Hugh Low, Spenser St. John and Wallace, whose narratives have done much to give us a true idea of the conditions prevailing in Sarawak during its early years under the White Rajahs.\n\nBeccari's connection with our Society, although not personal, is none the less intimate and lasting both on account of his botanical work and his travels in this part of the world. His adoption of the name \"Malesia\" for this zoogeographical subregion is of interest in view of the remarks of our Society's first President, Bishop Hose, who, in his inaugural address to the Society in 1878, commented on the need for some collective name. He selected \"Malaya\" as the name which appeared to him most suitable. Recent writers, including Mr. Boden Kloss, have adopted \"Malaysia\" for the more restricted area comprising the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Java and adjacent small islands. Both Beccari and Bishop Hose embraced the islands as far East as New Guinea in their names.\n\nAlthough Beccari is dead, his work lives. The problems which interested him will continue to interest Members of this Society, and reference to his opinions will long be made. To those of us who have felt the fascination of Malaysia it will cause no surprise that Beccari maintained his interest in this our chosen field of work throughout his long life.\n\nJ. C.
