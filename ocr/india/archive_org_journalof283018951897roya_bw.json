O. ANTHONISZ,\nHonorary Treasurer.\nMEMOIR OF CAPTAIN FRANCIS LIGHT,\nWHO FOUNDED PENANG.\n\n[DIED OCTOBER 21ST, 1794.]\n\nFRANCIS LIGHT was born at \"Dallington (? Dallingho) in Suffolk\" about 1745, and came to the East at an early age in the Marine Service of the East India Co.\n\nThere is scarcely one of our Straits worthies of whom so few personal particulars are known. He has of course left official records, and several of his private letters have been printed and preserved. There is also the official Diary he kept during the first few months in Penang, which is printed in Logan's Journal Vol. III; but this is all. Captain Light belongs to the \"active period\" of the Straits, to which, as in other places, the \"literary period\" succeeded. The latter began with Marsden and Leyden of \"many-languaged lore,\" who commenced his journeys in Sumatra and the Peninsula in 1805. During the next fifty years there was no lack of scholars and writers in these countries.\n\nBut before their time almost the only English literature of the Far East consisted of accounts by ship captains, like Dampier and Forrest, of their own and others' voyages. In these narratives there is much that is useful; but we miss the literary side and the personal details that make Leyden, Marsden and Raffles seem so much more familiar to us than their predecessors.\n\nThe first heard of Captain Light is in 1771, when he states he entered into correspondence with Warren Hastings as to the desirability of a repairing harbour in these waters, recommending Penang as a \"convenient magazine for the Eastern trade.\" There was no doubt negotiation for many years after in the intervals of trading tours.\nIn 1779, we come across Captain Light in one of these voyages; more than one reference being made to him in the Journal* of Dr. Koenig, the Danish Botanist, during that year. He met Captain Light trading at Junk Ceylon in May, and at Malacca in November, 1779; and he refers to him in terms that show there was friendship between them, and that the Botanist found him an enlightened and sympathetic companion. It is curious that this MS. also contains for the first time a tolerably full mention of Penang and of the deep-water approaches in the North channel, which justified its selection by Captain Light seven years later.\n\nIn 1780-1, a scheme had at last been matured for settling Junk Ceylon, through private subscription but with the consent of the Governor-General in Council (then Warren Hastings). There is in the British Museum a Paper which bears on this scheme, being a description of Junk Ceylon transmitted by Captain Light to Lord Cornwallis in his letter of 18th June, 1787.\u2020 The wars with the French and Dutch in 1781-3 delayed its execution, and shortly after Captain Light decided on the superior merits of Penang harbour. He was at first for settling at one and the same time in both places; but when the friendly ruler of Junk Ceylon died in December, 1785, it was finally resolved by the Governor-General to make the experiment at Penang alone, which the young Raja of Kedah had offered to cede for $6,000 a year.\n\nIn June, 1786, Captain Light left Calcutta with Sir J. Macpherson's authority to act. He was given 100 Native \"new-raised Marines\" and 30 Native Lascars, as well as 15 Artillerymen (European) and 5 Officers to support him in his undertaking to carry out the settlement of Penang. He first proceeded to Kedah. There he completed his negotiations, and provisioned his party. Sailing thence with three vessels on the evening of the 14th July, 1786, he anchored off Pulau Tikus the following day. The first two days he stayed on board, and was busy surveying the harbour and testing the\n\n---\n\n* In MS. in British Museum (translated S. A. S. Journal 27.)\n\u2020 See Logan's Journal, Vol. V, and p. 11 infra.\nanchorages. At last, on the 17th, he \"disembarked Lieut. Gray with the Marines upon Point Penagger\u2014a low sandy point covered with wood\u2014and employed them in clearing the ground.\" This ground is the present Esplanade, which with great foresight he reserved when so freely giving away all other lands. He took formal possession of the Island on the 11th* August.\n\nThe place was practically unoccupied; the only Malay inhabitants heard of were 52 Malays who came over, apparently from near Tanjong Tokong, to help in felling the forest.\n\nShortly afterwards an ancient clearing with coco-nuts, fruit trees and a burial-ground came to notice at Datoh Kramat; and in 1795 a grant of this clearing (measuring 13 orlongs) was given to Maharaja Setia, on the express ground that he was a \"relation by descent of the Datoh Kramat who cleared the ground 90 years before.\"\n\nWith these exceptions, the whole place was one great jungle.\u2020 Clearing went on with energy; wells were dug which yielded water that was fit to drink, but uninviting through being stained red by the roots of the penaga tree. Huts were run up for the marines and lascars, the tents which the settlers had brought not affording sufficient room. A month passed away quietly enough in the performance of these first labours, and the little party on the point was still unmolested by prying and undesirable intruders. But this was not to last long. Writing to Mr. Andrew Ross of Madras, Captain Light says: \"Before we could get up any defence we had visitors of all kinds, some for curiosity, some for gain, and some for plunder.\"\n\nNo Malay wearing a kris was at first allowed ashore, and care was taken to confine to their boats parties of those Achinese\n\n---\n\n* By a curious error this event came afterwards to be celebrated on the 12th August, and is so kept in Penang even now. It is easy to explain how the mistake occurred; the 12th August was the Prince Regent's birthday, after whom the Settlement was named. So far back as 1823, the 12th is given as the date of foundation in a minute on Land Administration by Mr. Phillips, who came to Penang with Sir George Leith in 1800.\n\n\u2020 The island had been cleared by Kedah of its piratical inhabitants about 1750.\nand other warlike spirits who were above using the *bliong* in the jungle. Captain Light had seen too many ruins of the old factories which these gentry had \"cut off\" to trust them as settlers. To encourage the wood-cutters, he is said to have ingeniously loaded a gun with a bag of dollars and fired it into the jungle. It is mentioned also that the Malays provided *nibongs* for the stockade which was the precursor of Fort Cornwallis. On the 10th August, two of the Company's ships, the *Vansittart* and the *Valentine*, hove in sight, and Captain Light, thinking the occasion a favourable one for the christening of the infant colony, invited the Captains ashore to assist in the ceremony on the 11th August. \"At noon,\" he tells us, \"all the gentlemen assembled under the flagstaff, and unitedly hoisted the flag, taking possession of the island in the name of His Britannic Majesty and for the use of the Honourable East India Company, the artillery and ships firing a Royal salute, the marines three volleys.\" The following day being the birthday of the Prince of Wales, it occurred to our founder to name the island in his honour; but this name has been unable to compete with the shorter one of native origin, and exists only in official documents. Once the establishment of the Settlement became known, people began to flock in from all quarters to live under the protection of the British flag.\n\nHis work progressed favourably, especially in the matter of health. The early entries in his Diary often express surprise at the absence of all serious sickness; until the following year. Then the dry season affected many, and struck him down with fever very severely in January, 1787. About the same time he began to feel the want of support from Calcutta. In February, 1787, he writes to Mr. A. Ross, of Madras:\u2014\"I have received nothing from the Bengal Government since my departure from Calcutta.\" But the Settlement prospered and grew notwithstanding, the number of settlers being stated at \"about 10,000\" by the end of 1789, and at over 20,000 in 1795.*\n\n* Of this number the Chinese were then not much over 3,000; and Captain Lennon, R.E., who visited Penang, in November, 1795, expressly states, That the Chuliahs were more numerous. (S. A. S. Journal, vol. 7.)\nThe task of governing this mixed multitude fell entirely on the shoulders of Captain Light himself, for he received but little encouragement from the Indian Government, who long regarded the Establishment at Penang with doubts and even with jealousy. There had been a rival settlement formed at the Andamans in 1791, under the patronage of Admiral Cornwallis; but it never prospered, and in 1796, was abandoned. Meanwhile Penang had natural advantages which served it better than any patronage. The Superintendent, as he was called, lost no opportunity of assuring the East India Company of the success of his beloved Settlement as a commercial enterprise, and implored the Directors to establish a proper Government and to make provision for the administration of justice. This was a difficulty most keenly felt, but in spite of his earnest recommendation no proper remedy was applied. The sole tribunal up to the beginning of the 19th century was an informal kind of Court Martial, composed of Officers and respectable inhabitants. All the minor offences and petty disputes were adjudicated by the \"Captains\" or headmen of the various nationalities inhabiting the island; and there was no regularly organised judicial system in the island till the establishment of the Recorder's Court in 1805. In Captain Light's time persons convicted of murder were sent prisoners to Bengal; and by the express order of the Indian Government it was \"made understood upon the island for the sake of example that they were to remain in slavery for life.\" This bugbear of slavery in Bengal was a childish subterfuge wherewith to maintain the majesty of the law; but Light was no party to such folly; and continually urged his Government to provide proper Courts endowed with full authority.\n\nEarly in 1788, the financial question confronted the Superintendent of the new Colony. He was much averse to laying burdens on the people, and especially to interfering with the freedom of the port, and expresses his regret at the insistence of Government. In a despatch addressed to Lord Cornwallis, dated 20th June, 1788, he urges: \"Some reasonable time should be allowed the first settlers to enable them to bear\n\"the expense of building, &c. I arrived here in July, 1786. \"It is now almost two years, but the inhabitants have not \"slept in their houses more than twelve months. I should \"not have scrupled to give my word to them that they would \"not be taxed in three years, but as the necessities of gov- \"ernment will not admit of a delay, I offer the following \"modes to your Lordship's consideration.\" He suggests twelve possible methods for raising revenue, including ground-rent on houses, shop-tax on retailers, a spirit farm, duties on alienation and succession, and import duties on foreign goods. The Government approved of these, but consented to postpone the evil day. Later on, however, in 1801, Penang became a \"customs port;\" and was not set free from this obstruction to its trade till 1826.\n\nIn 1789, Captain Light went to Calcutta, and was closely questioned by the Government as to the capabilities of Penang. Thus challenged, he proved equal to the occasion, and eulogised his Settlement in a voluminous reply. He concludes a despatch by the following optimistic summary of such advantages as, he says, are visible and undeniable:\n\n\"1. A harbour with good anchorage, secured from bad weather and capable of containing any number of vessels.\n\n\"2. An island well watered, of excellent soil, capable of sustaining 50,000 people and abounding in all necessary materials for their service and security.\n\n\"3. A port favourable to commerce, the present imports amounting to upwards of $600,000 per annum.\n\n\"4. A place of refuge for merchant ships where they may refit and be supplied with provisions, wood and water, and protected from the insults of enemies.\n\n\"5. An emporium centrally situated where the merchants of all nations may conveniently meet and exchange their commodities.\"\n\nLight's instincts were true; yet he failed to convince his Government, and for many years the life of Penang hung on a thread; indeed it was not till recently that revenue began to cover expenditure, and that our founder's forecast was justified in this respect.\nIn 1790, Light began to find that the duties of Superintendent of the growing Settlement were incompatible with his position as a merchant,* while the small salary (Rs. 1,000 per month) which he received from Government was insufficient to warrant his giving up trade. So strongly did he feel this that we find him proposing to the authorities in Calcutta that he should be precluded from engaging in trade, receiving \"such increase of salary as will support the office with 'decency and enable me to make a small provision for approaching old age.'\" Few of his acts reveal an honourable and upright character more clearly than this. His combined position of Superintendent and principal merchant in Penang gave him abundant opportunity of enriching himself; and in those lax days, with examples like Vansittart and Macpherson before him, such scruples must have seemed to many almost Quixotic. In the following year there was trouble with Kedah. The Raja of that country, grown jealous of the prosperous Settlement that had sprung up in his neighbourhood, collected a force, and in 1791 instigated a fleet of twenty Lagoon boats to enter Pry River. These were joined by the Kedah Bandahara. A land force also came down to the banks of the river and threw up entrenchments. Light's force numbered 400 men, all well armed and disciplined. He took the initiative and attacked by land and sea the force at Kuala Pry, which had swelled to the number of over 8,000 Malays. After a few hours fighting the enemy were dispersed, notwithstanding their great preponderance of numbers. Since that day Penang has remained free from the attack of any enemy, native or foreign, even when the Siamese troops of the Phya Ligor were over-running Kedah in 1821. Light was justly proud of his victory and called his next son Francis Lanoon Light in honour of it.\n\nIn a despatch dated 24th August, 1792, Captain Light continues to sound the trumpet of his little Colony and to predict for it that success which it has since attained. One admires the earnest way in which its earliest ruler stood\n\n\u2020 He was partner with James Scott in Scott & Co., afterwards Brown & Co.\nforth as the champion of Penang. We have had other champions since, and ardent ones too, but must give Francis Light the palm. In the same despatch he alludes to the discovery of tin on Bukit Timah (the spur to the north of the \"Crag\" where the new Sanitarium of the Pulau Tikus College now stands), and the discovery of a wild nutmeg \"whose fruit so nearly resembles a nutmeg that the Buggesses and a Dutchman who had been at the spice islands declared to be the real nutmeg.\" He goes on to say: \"I have great hopes that the fruit may be improved so as to become an article of commerce.\" This prediction was verified, but not for some years after, till Mr. Christopher Smith's Agricultural Mission in 1802; and then it was the imported nutmeg plant from Amboyna which for a time flourished so greatly in the island. The whole tone of Captain Light's letters bears testimony to the singleness of purpose and administrative insight that characterised this remarkable man, and it is matter for deep regret that he was not spared longer to bring his labours to full fruition. The use he made of his short period of power in the Far East, and his great capacity as a leader of pioneer enterprise, prove him a worthy forerunner to Sir Stamford Raffles, who founded Singapore, 35 years later, on very similar lines.\n\nCaptain Light died at Penang, like so many of the early Chiefs of the Settlement, on the 21st October, 1794. Some fever like that severe one recorded in his Journal in February, 1787, probably caused his death; at any rate he was able to make a Will on the previous day.\n\nA letter to Government published in Vol. V of Logan's Journal, p. 7, is the last official record of his work, bearing date 25th January, 1794. In this he pleaded that a Civil Assistant trained to the work might be his successor, \"in case of his removal by death or otherwise,\" instead of the Officer Commanding as arranged in 1787. He also advocates \"a mild and at the same time an active Government\" as necessary for the \"most wealthy and useful inhabitants\"\u2014that is, the Chinese, whose numbers he estimated at about 3,000.\nHe ends with the following characteristic paragraph:\u2014\"A regular form for administering justice is necessary, both for the peace and welfare of the society and for the honour of the nation who have granted them protection; it is likewise improper the Superintendent should have it in his power to exercise an arbitrary judgment upon persons and things; whether this judgment is iniquitous or not the mode is still arbitrary and disagreeable to society.\"\n\nUnder date August 1st, 1794, the Governor-General, Lord TEIGNMOUTH, replied that \"he did not at present think himself authorised to establish formal and regular Courts,\" but passed, and transmitted to Captain LIGHT, certain Regulations for preserving the peace of the island. These long remained effective; and Mr. Justice DICKENS, on 22nd October, 1805, eleven years after, declared them to be the only laws even then in force. These Regulations must have reached Captain LIGHT just before his death, and the establishment of Mr. MANNINGTON as Magistrate with the first approach to regular law in his infant Settlement appropriately closes the public career of such a man. His chronicler\u2014Colonel LOW\u2014thus sums up his character and work:\n\n\"Although the rather implicit credence which he gave at first to the Rajah of Kedah's assertion of his independence of Siam, might have led to more serious consequences than it did, still it would appear that he was a man of sound sense, probity and judgment\u2014active, practical, and moderate. That certainly reprehensible credence, however, secured to the British merchant and to the world the port of Pinang, the most eligible one at this extremity of the Straits. (Vol. III of LOGAN'S Journal, 1848).\n\nThis seems to be a just and friendly reference as regards him personally. But in estimating the political criticism it must be remembered who it is that writes. Colonel LOW was an avowed partisan in the curious political controversy of his time regarding the status of Kedah. This matter bears so closely on Captain LIGHT's principal works, and on his judgment and sincerity in carrying it out, that it must not be passed over in any account of his action as the Founder of the Settlement.\"\nThe old controversy upon the point has long subsided. As a matter of practical politics, the general \"suzerainty\" of Siam is now, and since the Malay Restoration in 1842, expressly admitted; but that in 1786 it was admitted, or even claimed, in any European sense of the word, \"suzerainty,\" cannot be maintained. The view favouring Captain Light's direct negotiation with Kedah was supported by Mr. J. R. Logan, and was held by those best-informed in Straits affairs when the dispute arose. The opposite case, of which Colonel Low, a Siamese scholar, made himself the chief exponent, is best disposed of by quoting his own admissions in his paper on the question in Vol. III of Logan's Journal:\n\nP. 602. He admits that \"no coercion or intimidation was employed to obtain the cession of Penang in 1786.\"\n\nP. 601. That the Rajah protested his independence, and was believed by the Government of India (after enquiries protracted during 1778-86); while \"Siam would readily have consented\" if consulted.\n\nP. 613. That there was an \"ancient dependence, and a rebellion against Siam in 1720,\" which shews the unpractical character of the claim, so many years after.\n\nPp. 603-13. In fact the triennial \"bunga mas\" remains the sole piece of evidence on which the whole figment has been constructed. The value of this evidence can be gauged by Colonel Low's own reference (p. 613) to \"the rival nations of Ava and Siam\" both receiving this token (see also p. 610 where the Rajah of Kedah claimed our help against both Burmese and Siamese). The bunga mas was no more than a token of inferior pretensions, offered by a second-rate to a first-rate Eastern Power, in the same way as it was formerly offered by Siam to China.\n\nIt is clear from many of these passages (pp. 600 to 609 and elsewhere) that Colonel Low imported into his chronicle in Logan's Journal questions which sixty-five years before had never been raised* at all, but which afterwards excited\n\n* In 1802 the Advocate-General at Calcutta advised on the question whether the sovereignty of the Island had been ceded to Britain, and in the course of his formal \"Opinion\" the very existence of the Siamese is ignored.\nmuch feeling in the controversy of his day. So also it must be confessed did Mr. Secretary ANDERSON and the partisans on the other side.\n\nThe unfairness of this as affecting Captain LIGHT'S action is obvious: especially because the strongest argument for his view of the independence of Kedah lay just in the fact that the question of dependence was never raised at all in the early days. In the later controversy, at a time when the Siamese invasion was pressing and the Dutch power had passed away from the Peninsula, it was forgotten that in the eighteenth century things were different. Far more important then than Siam stood out the other factor in the question\u2014the Dutch\u2014who in 1783\u20135 were engaged in active hostilities* with Selangor and Rio. It is stated in ANDERSON'S \"Considerations,\" (1824) on the authority of a letter from LIGHT to the Governor-General, that the Dutch in 1783 wrote to the Rajahs of Kedah and Tringganu for assistance, and fearing Dutch hostility when the Malacca siege was over, those Rajahs made in 1785 spontaneous offers of a British settlement in their respective States.\n\nOne thing is certain\u2014that in writing his criticism in 1848, Colonel LOW was ignorant of Captain LIGHT'S despatch to Lord CORNWALLIS in 1787; and in consequence misrepresents the whole of the official negotiations respecting Salang and Penang as though these had turned upon \"whether the islands formed a portion of the Siamese Empire.\" The printing of this despatch in a later volume of LOGAN'S Journal at once made it clear that nothing of that kind came into the question; its entire absence is in fact most noticeable. Captain LIGHT explained fully the whole of the circumstances of his selecting these islands in the official letter mentioned above, dated 18th June, 1787 (published in LOGAN, Vol. IV, p. 634). This letter shows that in 1780 WARREN HASTINGS' Council sanctioned \"in a public letter\" Captain LIGHT'S \"plan for employing subscriptions,\" already actually raised for a Settlement on\n\n*See S. A. S. Journal, Vol. XXIV, \"Raja Haji's War.\"\nSalang (Junk Ceylon); which was in course of being carried out when \"before the troops and ships were made ready, the war with France in 1781-2 led to its being neglected.\"\n\nThe letter adds how, at the conclusion of the war, Hastings took the matter up again. \"But for the death of a friendly Governor of Salang in December, 1785,\" Captain Light\u2014who had however in the meanwhile been struck by the superior advantages of Penang \"as a barrier to the Dutch encroachment\"\u2014would, he says, \"have taken both islands.\"\n\nIn the end, Sir J. Macpherson, Hastings' successor, \"readily accepted Penang, but declined taking Salang\" on the two grounds:\n\n(1)\u2014that \"it required a greater force\" to keep;\n(2)\u2014that \"as Government required a naval port with a port of commerce, Penang is more favourable than Salang.\"\n\nThere is no doubt that Captain Light honestly believed it to be within the competence of the Rajah of Kedah to make over to the East India Company the island of Penang, and that nobody then questioned it. It is also certain that when his ships\u2014the Eliza, the Prince Henry and the Speedwell\u2014came to Penang, they went there with the Rajah's full consent and support, though after some opposition from the Laxamana and the Chiefs. Captain Light's Journal shews that the 11th, 12th and 13th July, 1786, were spent at Kedah \"in embarking the people and provisions\" for this expedition. There was nothing secret about it. Once arrived in Penang, he very wisely acted with a sole view to the success and safety of his young Settlement. His Diary describes the numerous risks incurred in such an undertaking, and shows how piracy, scanty provisions, disease, the hostility of the Dutch in Malacca, the jealousy of Kedah, had to be encountered in turn.\n\nOne story that has obtained currency perhaps deserves contradiction, for strange to say it is repeated in a Work like Balfour's \"Encyclop\u00e6dia of India\" (Vol. III), 1885, published by Bernhard Quaritch:\n\n\"Penang.\u2014It was an uninhabited forest, when given 'by the King of Quedah to Captain Light in 1785, as the marriage portion of the King's daughter whom Captain\n\"Light married; but it was sold to the British by the King in 1800.\"\n\nThe statement about \"the marriage portion\" is of course unfounded. It has been repeated from old gossip* on this subject in a way that is as discreditable as the other obvious errors in the dates, &c. Captain Light certainly allied himself in 1772 with Martina Rozells, but she was neither a Malay nor a Princess, but was apparently a Portuguese Christian of the Roman Catholic Mission at Kedah or Junk Ceylon. The old Junk Ceylon Mission removed about that time to Kedah, and in 1786 to Pulau Tikus village at Penang. She lived with him to his death, and inherited his house \"Suffolk\" and other property. She bore him five children, one of whom at least he took care to bring up in England\u2020\u2014Colonel William Light, born in 1784, died 1839. This son followed in his father's steps; for it was his pride to be the \"Founder of Adelaide.\" As the companion and \"Surveyor-General\" of Sir J. Hindmarsh, first Governor of the new Colony of South Australia, he selected the site of the new Capital on December 28th, 1836.\n\nThe success of Captain Light's enterprise in establishing Penang was already clear at the time of his death. This is shown by Admiral Cornwallis' rival Settlement at the Andamans being abandoned two years later in favour of Penang. It is also testified to in the account of no less a personage than the great Duke of Wellington (then Col. Wellesley) which is to be found, under date 1797, in Vol. I of Gleig's \"Supplementary Despatches.\" Finally it was made manifest to all the world in the despatch of the Court of Directors on establishing the Presidency Government at Penang, in September, 1805. (Published in Logan's Journal, Vol. V.)\n\n* No doubt the story was honestly accepted and propagated by Colonel Light, and his English friends, when having distinguished himself in the Peninsular War he became the Duke's confidential A.D.C.\n\n\u2020 It appears from his Will that \u00a32,000 was provided for this purpose. The other domestic facts are also gathered from it and from some Memoranda industriously collected by Mr. F. Light, a direct descendant.\nThis despatch gives no mean tribute to Captain Light's work; and it deserves to be quoted at some length, for it explains with curious minuteness the policy of the East India Company during the first nineteen years of Penang history. It testifies that \"from the spirit of British rule, even when imperfectly administered, industry, enterprise and improvement have appeared to a considerable extent on the island, and its population, produce and commerce are already very respectable.\" As regards the future, it adds: \"The position of this island, its climate, its fertility, its harbour, its produce of large timber, its contiguity to Pegu which contains the most abundant of teak forests in Asia, have long pointed it out as an acquisition of very great importance in a commercial and political view, being situated in a most favourable situation for an emporium of commerce in the Eastern seas.\"\n\nThis important document, of 14 closely printed pages and 74 paragraphs, must have been framed in the latter part of 1804, just ten years after Captain Light's death. It is difficult to conceive a better testimony to his work and to the merits of his young Settlement. Among other things, it describes minutely how \"no Import and Export duties were imposed up to the time of the 2 per cent. ad valorem duty levied in 1801, on the importation of tin, pepper and betelnut, which in that year produced $13,076\"; and also how \"upon our first taking possession of the island............. ground was said to be of such little value that to ask was to have, or to appropriate was equivalent to legal right.\"\n\nTo check this some instructions had been invited and a Regulation had been passed on August 1st, 1794, \"respecting grants of land for the period of 5 years\"; and resolving that for the future \"no grant of land be made to Europeans exceeding in quantity 300 orlongs, preferring to encourage the clearing and cultivation of the island by making small grants of land to the industrious Chinese.\"\n\nUnfortunately for this policy, the Chinese would not look at such short leases. The emergency thus created at the close of\nhis life brought out the resource and political courage which were the secret of Captain Light's success. This Regulation stopping perpetuity grants in favour of five-year leases was to take effect from 1st January, 1795. When the Resolution arrived he allowed it to be known and stopped issuing grants; but at the same time he informed Mr. Young and others that he would not promulgate it, but would get it rescinded: \"well knowing (says Mr. Young) the publication would instantly stop all further advance,\" and especially the pepper-planting near Glugor which he had started in 1790 and had done so much to promote. Before the Resolution could come into force, he had died. But his immediate successor Mr. Mannington took the same view; and on the 22nd August, 1796, \"the Governor-General in Council rescinded his Resolution of the 1st August, 1794,\" viz., that no allotments of land be made in perpetuity. (Papers relating to Land Revenue Administration, published 1884.)\n\nIt has since been contended that these Perpetuity Grants were a mistake; but the contemporary evidence points entirely the other way. In any case the blame would fall on his superiors. The responsibility for that policy lies with Sir J. Macpherson, who, when Captain Light sounded him in April, 1786, before he started on his expedition, as to \"granting settlers a portion of land,\" replied \"That would be proper;\" and with his successor, Lord Cornwallis, whose first despatch to Captain Light dated 22nd January, 1787, stated: \"We leave it to your discretion to receive such colonists as you may think it safe and advisable to admit and to give each family such portion of land as circumstances will allow and you may judge expedient.\" To Lord Cornwallis' wise and liberal statesmanship on this and similar points the Settlement owes much of its rapid progress. His preference for \"perpetuity settlement\" may have carried him too far in an old country like Bengal. But in a new Colony it is the only policy that can succeed; as was soon made clear at Penang when he left, and when Lord Teignmouth endeavoured to reverse it and adopt restrictive measures.\n\nIn this matter as in so many others Captain Light did his\nduty well, as the local Chief, in saving the Government he served from making what would have been a very serious mistake. This was frankly admitted in paragraph 164 of Lord AUCKLAND'S well-known minute of 1837.\n\nBut this controversy belongs to a later chapter. The Founder's work was done, and it did not \"follow him.\" He had been entirely successful in a kind of enterprise in which disastrous failure has been so common.\n\nHis \"infant Port,\" once made a Presidency Government, lay very snugly under the shelter, not only of Penang Hill but of the \"Honourable Court\" itself. What the Treaty of Holland effected for the security of Singapore, the recognition given in 1805 by this new Commission of Government effected for Penang. Henceforth experiments could be tried without risking the very life of the Settlement. Some of them succeeded\u2014like that of receiving Indian convicts, and like the \"forward policy,\" which culminated in our occupying Java, and afterwards Singapore. Some of them failed\u2014like the attempts to evacuate Malacca in 1808, and to federate with Acheen in 1811-18. Most of the experiments encountered, as usual, something both of failure and success. Among these may count the rage for nutmeg-planting, in 1802-20, and the Honourable Court's attempt to make Penang pay its way by Customs duties and otherwise.\n\nNo period of its history can better illustrate \"the spirit of 'British rule even when imperfectly administered'\" than that in which Captain LIGHT played his part alone. Those first eight years form a truly successful record of what British courage and perseverance, local experience amounting to adroitness, and a large-minded sense of public duty can achieve, even when almost unsupported. These qualities are shewn by the public records.\n\nThe inscription to his memory at St. George's Church by a contemporary Penang resident\u2014ROBERT SCOTT\u2014adds to the favourable impression made by the public records a warm testimony to his worth:\u2014\nMEMOIR OF CAPTAIN LIGHT.\n\nIN MEMORY\n\nOF\n\nFRANCIS LIGHT ESQ.\n\nWHO FIRST ESTABLISHED THIS ISLAND\n\nAS AN ENGLISH SETTLEMENT,\n\nAND WAS MANY YEARS GOVERNOR.\n\nBORN IN THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK IN ENGLAND,\n\nAND DIED OCTOBER 21ST, 1794.\n\nIN HIS CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR,\n\nTHE SETTLERS AND NATIVES WERE GREATLY ATTACHED TO HIM\n\nAND BY HIS DEATH, HAD TO DEPLORE THE LOSS OF ONE\n\nWHO WATCHED OVER THEIR INTERESTS AND\n\nCARES AS A FATHER.\n\nThe best part of his life\u2014from 1771 to 1794\u2014had been given to this place, and he rests in our old Cemetery. His grave and the brief Inscription on it (the first four lines as printed above) are well kept. Next to him lies PHILIP DUNDAS, the first Presidency Governor; and within a few yards are the tombs of Captain SCOTT and Captain GLASS, his earliest fellow settlers.\n\nIt is only right that his successors should gratefully recall those who came first and bore the hard work of Pioneers; and should give special honour to so worthy a \"Founder,\" upon the hundredth Anniversary of his Death.\n\nA. M. S.\n\nPenang, 21st October, 1894.\nADDRESS\n\nBY\n\nMR. J. A. KRUYT,\n\nDELIVERED BEFORE THE INDIAN SOCIETY,\n\nON\n\nTHE STRAITS SETTLEMENTS\n\nAND\n\nTHE MALAY PENINSULA.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of our East Indian possessions lie the Straits Settlements, an English Crown Colony, of which Singapore and Penang are the chief ports. These are often touched at by passing Civil Servants, Officers and other Dutchmen on their way to Holland, and also on the way to or from Acheen or the East Coast of Sumatra. They see then in a cursory way something of these English trading places, but in general Dutchmen still know very little of this Colony, and of the adjacent Malay Peninsula. I was astonished to see how little of the literature that exists on this subject is to be found in Holland. If the contents of the library of this Society disappointed me in this respect, and those of the Library of the \"Koninklijk Instituut voor taal-land-en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie,\" I was still more disappointed, when I came to enquire in the Royal Library, as to what was to be found of this part of the world upon this subject.\nAnd yet these regions should inspire us with especial interest not only as belonging to our closest neighbours, but also because they belong to a world-nation, to the first Colonial power, and are governed in an entirely different way to our possessions.\n\nThe influence that for years has spread of its own accord and in a natural way from there to our Colonies, ought not to be under-estimated. To enquire into these influences, to put to a certain extent on a safe footing the relations between both Colonies, is naturally the delicate task of the Dutch Consular Officials in Singapore and Penang, who are, as it were, our advance guards there. For some years I have been honoured with this trust in Penang.\n\nFor this reason, I wish this evening, at the solicitation of your Committee, to draw your attention to this interesting part of the English transmarine possessions, in the hope that this lecture may contribute in some degree to increase your interest in these regions, and may perhaps induce you to make a closer investigation into the present condition of things prevailing in the Straits Settlements and in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nI would ask your indulgence for any deficiencies and shortcomings which may be found in this contribution, which had to be compiled from scattered notes.\n\nThe Malay Peninsula, formerly called the Malacca Peninsula, or simply Malacca, by which is understood the portion of Further India to the South of the Isthmus of Kra, is washed on the West by the Gulf of Bengal and the Straits of Malacca, and on the East by the Chinese Sea and the Gulf of Siam. It is 600 English miles long, near Kra 40 miles broad, and further down averages 150 English miles in breadth, giving an area of about 75,000 English square miles, of which 40,000 are under Siam, and 35,000 under England, with a population of about one-and-a-half million souls. To Siam belong, on the West Coast, Kedah with Perlis and Situl, Junk Ceylon with Tongkah, Renong with Trang and Kra, and, on the East Coast, Tringganu, Kelantan, Patani, Singgora and Ligor.\nWe shall leave these undiscussed, so that we can confine ourselves exclusively to the English portion.\n\nThe mountain ranges that run through the whole length of the Peninsula are continuations of the mountain land of Further India, chiefly of granite formation, not subject to volcanic influences, and varying in height from 4 to 12 thousand feet. The highest peaks are in Kedah, Perak and Tringganu. These mountain ranges are bordered on both sides by alluvial plains from 10 to 30 English miles broad, broader as a rule on the West than on the East Coast. The hills are covered with rich forests, in which the wild tribes that live from the chase lead a wandering life; the plains, with their fertile soil and rich tropical cultivation, are inhabited by the more stationary population. The wild tribes (Negritos), which are but scanty in numbers, are called Sakais North of the Perak River, and South of that Semangs; older Malay hill-dwellers are distinguished as Orang Benua. The stationary population consists in the North to the 8th degree North latitude of pure Siamese, between the 7th and 8th degree of latitude they are called Samsams, a mixture of Siamese and Malays, and South of that the population is Malay. In addition, there are to be found settlements of aliens, chiefly Chinese, Klings and Arabs.\n\nNumerous but necessarily small streams, flow from the mountains to both coasts. The Perak and Pahang Rivers are the most considerable and the most navigable. They have more value for drainage and irrigation purposes than for purposes of communication, and provide the plains with a plentiful supply of water. The mouths of the rivers are, on both coasts, nearly everywhere shallow, and blocked by sand and mud banks. Those on the East coast are, during the whole of the East monsoon, closed to navigation, but on the West coast are generally well protected, and only now and then rendered less secure by heavy short squalls known as \"Sumatras.\" Towards the North, on both coasts, there are numerous coral reefs and islands.\n\nThe soil is rich in minerals, especially tin, gold, silver,\nlead, etc. The land is adapted to nearly every kind of tropical cultivation. In the animal kingdom are to be found the rhinoceros, the tapir, the elephant, the tiger, the bison, the wild bull, apes, snakes, etc. Further, a rich variety of birds, fish and splendid butterflies is to be found.\n\nThe climate is warm and damp, especially on the South, but the nights are very cool. The dry weather of the North-East monsoon prevails from the middle of October to the middle of April, the wet weather of the South-West monsoon during the rest of the year.\n\nThe digging of a ship canal through the Isthmus of Krah has been for some years the subject of enquiry and discussion, and was especially a favourite idea of the French. The journey from Europe to Siam and China would thus be shortened by 660 miles. The plan that is now in view of a railway connection between Penang and Singgora is, on the other hand, more in accordance with English ideas.\n\nThe Malay Peninsula, long before Europeans came there, was, like many other countries in Eastern Asia and many islands in the East Indian Archipelago, tributary to China to a certain extent. In spite of the fact that its coasts and harbours were from the earliest times visited by navigators and traders, and subsequent to the voyages of discovery by Europeans, more especially by Spaniards, Portuguese, English and Dutch; in spite of the fact that it has repeatedly been the scene of sanguinary conflicts between these nations, as well as between Javanese, Malays, Siamese and Achinese; in spite of the fact that we Dutch for two and a half centuries were in almost unbroken possession of Malacca, and maintained trading relations with the surrounding States of Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Johor, Junk Ceylon, Patani, Tringganu and Kelantan, where we had factories for shorter or longer periods\u2014in spite of all this, it remained till our own times pretty well a terra incognita.\n\nIn his treatise on Malacca in 1795, the English Admiral MAINWARING says:\u2014\"Malacca, although excellently situated \"and for more than 250 years in the hands of Europeans,\n\"Is, outside the town, desert and uncultivated, as if there had never been a settlement there. This is to be attributed to the narrow policy of the Dutch at Batavia, who make it their duty to concentrate everything in Java, and to make everything dependent upon it.\"\n\nIt was under the English that all further development of this portion of the East took place. We have contributed almost nothing to this, and confined ourselves almost exclusively to the town of Malacca, where all our Government and trading influence in that district were concentrated. In Malacca itself there was no further extension than was absolutely necessary, and indeed, on many occasions, the interests of Malacca were sacrificed to those of Java. Tin, pepper, and also gold were already then the most considerable articles of export, and our efforts were directed to obtain the monopoly of these in every way. A Chinese influence was at first great on the Peninsula, so that it was even necessary to obtain the sanction of the Sultan of Acheen to trade either with Perak or Kedah. The role which we played here was not always a brilliant one, as may be seen from an article entitled \"The Dutch in Perak,\" written, for the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, by the present Acting Governor of the Straits Settlements, Mr. W. E. Maxwell.\n\nThe proportion of English trade at this period in these parts was small, although they, the indefatigable rivals of the Dutch, also had their factories in many places. Indeed, India took up nearly all their attention, just as Java and the Moluccas did with us.\n\nMr. Skinner writes as follows in his \"British Connections with Malaya\" (a name first given, a short time ago, on the founding of the above-mentioned Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, to the whole of the countries where Malay or one of its related dialects is spoken, viz., the Malay Peninsula from Tenasserim and the great India Archipelago, from Sumatra to New Guinea):\u2014\"The contact of the English with this part of the world may be divided into three periods\u2014\n\"I.\u2014That of individual trade, 1602-1684.\n\"II.\u2014That of the trade of the East India Company, 1684-\n\"1762.\n\"III.\u2014That of political and military interference, 1762\n\"till now.\"\n\nThus this contact was of a purely commercial character till 1762, when the consolidation of the position of the English in British India, and circumstances in Europe, led them to pay more attention to Eastern lands, and politics came more into the front.\n\nThe first expedition of the English against Manila took place in 1763. Their fleet had stopped at Penang, and they were struck with the importance of the position of that place. This expedition ended with the occupation of the island of Balambangan, opposite Marudu Bay in North Borneo. It was abandoned again in 1804, on account of its unhealthiness. The island of Labuan was then occupied, but was almost immediately abandoned, and in 1846 was again taken possession of.\n\nThe desirability of obtaining some fixed place in or near the Straits of Malacca was the more evident from the circumstance that the trading fortresses in Sumatra, of which Bencoolen, raised in 1763 to an independent Presidency, was the capital, were less suited for that purpose. Acheen was chosen, but the negotiations with the Sultan of that kingdom led to no satisfactory result. Now, Francis Light, of the British India Marine, who was acquainted with the trade of Kedah, came with the proposal to choose for this the island of Penang, which was to be acquired by a payment to the Sultan of Kedah. It was then a desert, uncultivated, almost uninhabited island, and was only touched at by ships to take water or to wait for good weather. The first Englishman whom we know to have done this was Captain Lancaster of the Bonaventura, who visited Penang in 1592, and the first Dutchman was Cornelis Matelief, who went there in 1607.\n\nThe East India Company agreed to Light's proposal, and in August, 1786, took formal possession of Penang, in consideration of the payment of a fixed annual sum to the Sul-\ntan of Kedah. Pulau Pinang was christened Prince of Wales' Island, and the Settlement of the English George Town, but up till the present day it has been called Penang. In 1791, a stretch of land, now Province Wellesley, or simply the Province, on the mainland just opposite Penang, was purchased from the Sultan of Kedah, and in 1823 was considerably extended. The Straits Government pays up till the present time to him a rent or hire of from 10,000 to 12,000 dollars.\n\nFor political reasons, the British Government did everything in its power to further British influence in these parts, and Penang was the starting point for several expeditions during the great war. In 1795, Malacca was taken from us from there, and other possessions on the West coast of Sumatra came into the hands of the English. In 1797-98, a second expedition against Manila was prepared. The later expeditions against Java and the Moluccas were also got together and prepared in Penang.\n\nPenang was at first governed in a very irregular way by commercial superintendents. In 1796, it was established as a Penal Settlement for Indian convicts, and remained so till 1857, the year of the Indian Mutiny. In 1800, it was put under a Lieutenant-Governor, and in 1805 was promoted to be a Presidency, but still placed under the East India Company in Bengal.\n\nIt is natural that Penang, through one thing and another, should become a place of importance as a free port. Its trade had at once become noticeable as a trading centre for the neighbouring coasts, and it soon not only took the place of Malacca, but the merchants from still more distant places, came to trade in free Penang.\n\nMalacca was given back to us by the English in 1818, after they had made agreements with Perak and other States, which made it impossible for us to regain or improve our former position. In 1825, it was given over to them by us for good, but has remained what it still is, a place of small commercial importance with only limited local sources of trade and cultivation.\nFrom the beginning, the object and aim of the English in these parts was the overthrow of the trade monopoly of the Dutch, and this was joined to a hatred born of jealousy or ignorance, and a contempt which shows itself in almost all writings of this period. Thus one may read the following, in a letter of Sir Francis Light, in 1787, from Penang:\u2014\u201cI suspected the Dutch would throw obstacles in my way. The contempt and derision however with which they treat this place and the mean dirty acts they use would dishonour any but a Dutchman.\u201d\n\nAs a consequence of the so-called free-trade commercial policy, which however, as has been observed before, was dictated by political considerations, the commercial treaties with Perak and Selangor were concluded in 1818. England obtained for herself, by these, the position of the most-favoured nation, and thus prevented the granting of monopolies or favours to others. In 1819, Singapore was founded by Raffles, after he had been obliged to give back to us Java and the other Dutch possessions. This island, on which the town of Singapore stood in the twelfth century, he had purchased from Johor, which, at the same time, came under English influence and has remained so since. In 1820, a sort of treaty was made with Acheen, by which England stipulated or got the right to place a Resident in Acheen, and to exclude other European nations from establishing a Settlement there. The English, however, have never carried this treaty out. In 1826, the independence of Perak, which had been to a certain extent tributary to Siam, was recognised by treaty, and protection against Siam and Selangor was guaranteed. The English obtained by it the right to establish a Settlement on the island Pangkor, which we had previously repeatedly occupied. The remains of this occupation\u2014kept in repair by the English\u2014are to be seen at the present day.\n\nIn all this, the chief aim of the English was the weakening of Dutch interests, and the breaking up of their monopoly system\u2014an aim that was pursued by Raffles with indefatigable zeal, and was finally crowned with wonderful\nsuccess, although he often had to meet obstruction and misunderstandings even from his own countrymen. The founding of Singapore is a proof of this enterprising spirit and clear sight. It took place in opposition to instructions from Bengal, and completed the downfall of Malacca, which, lying between Penang and Singapore, lost its value and importance. It also neutralized to some extent the surrender of Java to us, an action that, to this day, no Englishman can remember without vexation and remorse.\n\nIn a letter in the Raffles Museum in Singapore, we read the following on this subject:\u2014\"Not our interests alone have suffered by this unexpected return (of the Dutch to Java) but those of humanity and civilization suffer more deeply. They (the Dutch) ought to have had some common feeling for humanity, some object in view beyond the cold calculations of profit and loss\" etc.\n\nFirst Singapore came under the Presidency of Bencoolen; in 1823 it came with Penang under the Government of Bengal, and in 1825 Penang, Singapore and Malacca were united as a Presidency with Penang as capital, until 1837, when Singapore, which had developed very rapidly, was appointed the seat of Government as it now is.\n\nHowever, it was not till 50 years after the English had become masters of the Straits of Malacca that they busied themselves directly with the affairs of the Peninsula. Different forms of Government were in use during this interval until 1st April, 1867, when the three Settlements, under the name of the Straits Settlements, were separated from British India, and as a Crown Colony, were brought under the direct authority of the mothercountry.\n\nAlthough during this time the local Government attempted on several occasions to extend its jurisdiction, these plans never met with the sanction or approval of the Home Government, and accordingly the policy of non-intervention in the Malay Peninsula was observed. The so-called Naning War, which ended in an extension of the territory of Malacca, formed an exception to this. Naning, one of the Negri Sembilan hereafter mentioned and a real nest of robbers, was then incorporated with Malacca. In view of the fact that the British India Government had to pay the cost of this, and had always, even in ordinary circumstances, to lend the three Settlements pecuniary support, the expenses were limited to what was strictly necessary, and these possessions were left to themselves \"to develop on their own resources.\" Thus the development of Penang and Singapore as trade centres became almost\nthe only aim. In Calcutta, very little was known of this portion of the globe. In 1837, an official wrote of them to his chief as follows:\u2014\"These details may appear petty to your Lordship, but then everything connected with these States is petty, except their annual surplus cost to the Government of India.\"\n\nAlthough it falls outside the proper province of what concerns the Straits Settlements, I must add the following, as it is altogether in accordance with the later programme of the English in this part of the globe. In 1842 James Brooke took possession of Sarawak and in 1846, Labuan was occupied by the English. There were incessant attempts made by individuals from the Straits to establish themselves in different points in our territory, just as James Brooke did in Sarawak, especially on the East Cost of Sumatra. These proceedings gave rise to much trouble, and on several occasions we were obliged to drive these fortune hunters by force from there. They frequently used as a pretext their ignorance of the boundaries of Acheen.\n\nA new period begun in the history of these places with the establishment of the Straits Settlements as a Crown Colony. We have chosen this evening as a subject for further discussion the remarkable progress which this Colony has enjoyed in the last years, by which it has become the most flourishing of all the English Crown Colonies, and the almost entirely peaceful growth of its influence upon the Malay Peninsula.\n\nLet us now pass over the five years before the Straits Government interfered actively and formally with the affairs of the Independent Native States, and the policy of non-intervention made way for that of \"active advice, assistance and control.\"\n\nThe occasion for this was given by the piracies along the coast, the general insecurity in which British subjects and British interests were placed, the state of anarchy, the wars between chiefs, the oppression, slavery, bondage, and poverty to which the people were a prey. Attacks upon vessels under the British flag occurred, and even upon the boats belonging to men-of-war, and upon British Settlements.\n\nThe knowledge that existed regarding the Malay Peninsula was then very small. The issue of the Journal of the Indian Archipelago had contributed somewhat to spread this knowledge, although this as well as other writings of this period dealt chiefly with our possessions, but after this publication ceased, nothing more was done during 20 years. The present Resident Councillor\nof Penang could say with truth in his address before the Royal Asiatic Society \"a long night has since settled down upon the 'Straits lasting some 20 years.' The Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society has since done a great deal to spread knowledge in this direction. A change in the right direction was due to the initiative of Sir Andrew Clarke, who still could speak of \"our absolute ignorance of geographical and physical features of those countries.\"\n\nMeanwhile it is very apparent that the English themselves troubled very little, after the time of Raffles, about \"humanity and civilisation,\" about which he was so hard upon us, and that with them, too, \"trade and commerce\" were the only \"objects in view.\"\n\nWhen we look at the map of the Malay Peninsula, we see between Province Wellesley (opposite Penang) and Malacca, Perak first, with a coast line of 80, then Selangor with a coast line of 120 English miles, and the little State of Sungei Ujong with Jelebu. Further inland, bordering Malacca, are the so-called Negri Sembilan, now consisting of six States. Between Malacca and Singapore lies Johor, with a coast line of 120 miles (English), and further up the East coast is Pahang. Under Siam, to the North of the Province is Kedah, with several other small States: and North of Pahang are Kelantan, Tringganu and Patani. Different agreements with England have given Tringganu, Kelantan and Kedah certain rights to British protection.\n\nThe state of insecurity mentioned before resulted in several punitive expeditions by men-of-war, but this led to no permanent improvement. In 1871, on account of piracies and other acts of violence, the expedition from Langat took place, and in 1872 and 1873, those at other places on the Jugra River in Selangor. In five large districts, of which it then consisted, great discord, civil war, and anarchy reigned. All of these districts considered themselves independent. The hasil was here, in general, the origin of disputes. The same condition of things prevailed in Sungei Ujorg which was also mixed up in these quarrels, and was, in addition continually at war with Rembau. Both of these States border upon the territory of Malacca. Linggi was also in a state of insecurity; also the more inland States, particularly Jelebu, Sri Menant and Muar, were constantly in a state of arms against one another. All of these received criminal refugees and vagabonds from the Straits, and only gave them up on payment of ransom.\nThe demands of British subjects upon their Chiefs met with no attention. The then Governor of the Straits, Sir Harry Ord, wrote in November, 1872:\u2014\"If persons, knowing the risk they run owing to the disturbed state of these countries, choose to hazard their lives and property for the sake of the large profits which accompany successful trading, they must not expect the British Government to be answerable if their speculations prove unsuccessful.\" Things were as we found them in Acheen, and these little States also provided themselves with weapons and even with combatants from the neighbouring Settlements.\n\nThe Chinese tin-miners in Perak, who had immigrated by thousands to different parts of the Peninsula, were especially the cause of great disorder; their tribes or kongsis had been for years in conflict with one another, with varying success, over the question of the possession of the tin mines. The Prince of Perak and his Chieftains had taken sides in the matter; with them the question was who should appropriate the export duties. Thus the Mantri of Larut, then the richest tin district, where about 40,000 Chinese of the Go Kwan tribe lived, had declared himself, in 1871, in favour of these, and, by appropriating the rich revenues, had been able to make himself independent of the Sultan, who, in the interior had allied himself with the more warlike Si Kwans. Battles in which, it is said, that more than 3,000 Go Kwans perished, brought the Si Kwans into Larut; they took possession of the forts and of the river; robbery, murder and assassination became the order of the day, and a general cessation of business and flight of population ensued. The Mantri who, among others, had English Officers in his service, was a prisoner in his own country and found himself shut in on all sides at Kotah, the then Capital.\n\nWhen these Si Kwans had been insolent enough to extend their devastations and plunderings beyond Perak, and even in Penang and its harbour attacks and kongsi fights occurred, in 1873, their fortifications were taken and destroyed by the English under Captain Woolcombe, and the Mantri came again into possession of his river.\n\nThanks to the influence of the Straits Government, the only orderly State being situated in the immediate neighbourhood of Singapore was Johor. But even here disputes as to boundaries, &c. could not be altogether prevented.\n\nThere was thus every inducement for the Governor, Sir Andrew Clarke, to interfere and to endeavour to put an end once and for\nall to this unsatisfactory state of things, and to prevent the Chinese from forming themselves, as it were, into independent colonies on the mainland. Their secret societies would be a danger to the British Settlements, and the inland Chiefs were quite unable to control them and to keep them under. Sir Andrew Clarke said in the sitting of the Legislative Council, in September, 1874:\u2014\n\n\"Our mission as a civilized nation in the middle of semi-civilized people is not only that of trade, but the higher duty, which we as Englishmen owe to our flag and our Queen. By the spread of other European nations in this part of the world our interests also want a larger field of operation.\"\n\nAfter the punishment of the Chinese disturbers in Perak, he called the heads of the kongsis together to Pangkor and the result of this was that piracy and wars among the Chiefs ceased, and a year later Larut had again a population of 35,000 souls, and a revenue of $30,000 a month. Indeed, the Chinese were beginning themselves to have enough of it, and it only required a strong leading and organising hand to settle the existing differences. One of their Chiefs was heard to exclaim at this time:\u2014\"When the British flag is seen over Perak and Larut, every Chinaman will go down on his knees and bless God.\" This was probably a Go Kwan.\n\nNow an attempt had to be made to settle the differences of the Malay Chiefs in Perak. They too all came to Pangkor and their mutual relations towards one another and towards England were defined by the Treaty of Pangkor of the 25th January, 1874. By it Perak came under English protection, a piece of land in Perak on the other side of the Krian River was joined to the Province, and the Dinding Islands and a piece of the mainland on the Pangkor River under the name of the \"Dindings\" were joined to Pangkor, where now for the first time an English Settlement was established, at first under the authorities at Singapore, and afterwards and now under Penang. The different States had to pay the cost of the former armed interference. At the request of the Sultan of Perak, the Straits Government sent a Resident there in 1874 to lend the Native Government \"active advice and assistance.\"\n\nSelangor and Sungei Ujong, too, placed themselves under British protection, after Ka Langat, the place of residence of the Sultan of Selangor, having been punished again for the usual acts of robbery and some disturbances in the interior having been settled by the intervention of the Straits Government.\nBritish Residents were put in Selangor in 1874, and in 1875 in Sungei Ujong.\n\nThese Residents were placed, and are still under the supervision and guidance of the Governor of the Straits, and are responsible to him.\n\nMeanwhile it was soon evident that this settlement with the Chiefs of Perak was only satisfactory on the surface. In November, 1875, at Pasir Sala, the first Resident, Mr. Birch, was treacherously murdered, and the whole of Upper Perak rose against the English. The British Government was compelled to send an important expedition there in order to punish this crime and to restore order in the country. The Sultan was taken prisoner and banished, and another was appointed in his place. As there were at the same time appearances of disorder in Sungei Ujong and the Negri Sembilan, it was not till 1877 that it can be said that quiet and order returned to all these countries.\n\nIt was then that the rapid development in progress and well-being began, which has never since been disturbed by any resort to arms.\n\nIn 1883, the then Governor Sir Frederick Weld, after various preliminary discussions, induced the so-called Negri Sembilan to enter into an agreement and to place the Government under the protection and guidance of the Straits Government represented by a Resident. This was first carried into execution in 1887.\n\nThe independent State of Pahang, situated to the North of Singapore, refused stubbornly, till, 1888, to enter into a treaty with the Straits Government. The misgovernment and insecurity that prevailed there formed a marked contrast to the condition of things in the neighbouring State of Johor. On several occasions the relations between Pahang and Singapore itself were very strained, and the interference of France was once spoken of. However that may be, Pahang acknowledged the sovereignty of England in 1888 and signed an agreement similar to that of Johor, which, in 1885, had come definitely under British influence.\n\nIn 1892, serious disturbances took place in Pahang, which had every appearance of insurrection against the English, and led to the so-called Pahang war, which ended in the restoration of the former order of things. It is remarkable that almost exclusively Perak Police was employed against Pahang.\n\nThere came no change in the relations with Tringganu and Kelantan. The friendly influence of the English, through peaceful\nmeans, and through the example of the well-being of the Native States, is very great there.\n\nOutside the Straits, in 1880, a portion of North Borneo was occupied by the recently formed \"North Borneo Co.,\" and in 1888 followed by a British protectorate over this portion of North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak. The Governor of the Straits was then appointed Consul-General in these lands, just as the Resident Councillor of Penang is, for the so-called Siamese States on the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula. This, in view of the existing ex-territorial rights, gives them great power over the thousands of Natives who call themselves British subjects, and at the same time over those States themselves, and, in my opinion, prepares the way for future annexation.\n\nIn 1885, England established herself in the Eastern portion of New Guinea. In 1886, she took possession of the Cocos or Keeling Islands to the South of Java, which were joined to the Straits and in 1888 of Christmas Island, which is also situated in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is my pleasant duty to add here that the Straits authorities have always maintained a most considerate and friendly attitude towards us, especially during the AChinese war.\n\nLet us now return to the Colony as it now is. It is impossible for any one who travels now through the Protected States of the Malay Peninsula and sees everywhere the outward signs of civilization and meets with an industrious, contented population, to picture to himself what their condition was a short time ago under the Native Government. Without any military assistance, the Residents have been able to bring their residencies to a flourishing condition and continual progress. Surrounded by a staff of able Europeans and Natives, they formed part of the legislative and executive power, the State Council, or rather, with their powerful personality, they alone represented it. Indeed the articles of the above-mentioned Pangkor Treaty left great power to the discretion of these Residents, whose advice had to be sought and followed by the Princes in all questions which did not affect religion and custom, while the collection and control of the revenues, as well as the general government of the land, depended upon their advice. They were responsible for everything to the Governor of the Straits.\n\nThe present Resident of Perak has recently spoken of this as follows:\u2014\"I have spoken of the Residential system, but in real-\n\"ity there was no system, what there is now, has grown of experience in attempting the untried. A British Officer acting under the instructions of a distant Governor is sent to advise a Malay Ruler and his Chiefs. The Officer is told he is responsible for everything, but he is not to interfere in details. His advice must be followed, but he must not attempt to enforce it, and so on. He must keep the peace, see that justice is administered, respect vested interests, do his best for the State, and obey instructions he receives from Singapore, and with all this he is at peril to remember that he is only the adviser of the Malay Ruler. Out of this difficult position has grown the present administration.\" The Residents supported by the confidence of the Governor, have made use of their power with great tact. They took measures to further and extend trade, cultivation and industry, and to develop the resources of the country, to maintain order and justice, to facilitate communication by roads, railways and telegraph, and to improve the education and instruction, and thus the material and moral condition of the people.\n\nSixteen years ago there was almost no roads: one had to travel on foot or by elephant, armed, and generally accompanied by an armed escort, and to take shelter in the best native house one could find. The whole population went about armed. Now there are everywhere to be found in all the States broad, hard, carriage roads, railways, and free Government buildings, schools, hospitals and police stations, and these like all other works of evident utility are being continually extended. The population has increased, and security reigns everywhere. Slavery and bondage have completely disappeared, while it was calculated that even in 1882, one-sixteenth of the population was still in slavery. Armed Natives are now never seen.\n\nThe development of the Protected and Native States was naturally accompanied by increased prosperity and progress in Penang and Singapore. This was enhanced by the contemporaneous success of the Deli tobacco cultivation, the improvement in the tin-mining industry and land cultivation on the example of its neighbours, in Kedah and other small Northern States tributary to Siam, and the late opening for trade, industry and cultivation of a greater part of British and Dutch Borneo, of Palembang, Indragiri, the Rhio Islands, Singkep, etc.\n\nWhat Singapore now is many of us know from our own observation. Always extending and beautifying itself, with its splendid\nharbour and docks, as a free port and centre of commerce, it draws towards itself more and more the fruits of the development of the surrounding countries. It stands in commercial importance on the same footing as Malta and Hongkong, and surpasses all the ports of the other Crown Colonies in importance. As the seat of Government, and a strongly fortified \"coaling station\"\u2014ships take in in New Harbour from 1,600 to 1,800 tons of coal in four hours\u2014it forms one of the most strategical points of the English, on the great highway of traffic between Europe, British India, and East Asia. It may be seen from the following figures how greatly it has grown:\u2014The population of the town and island, 27 miles broad and 14 miles long, amounted in 1819 to 150 Malays, in 1821 to nearly 5,000 souls, in 1871 to nearly 100,000 and in 1891 to 185,000. The amount of import and exports was in 1823, $12,000,000, in 1860 $51,000,000, and in 1890 had risen to $200,000,000.\n\nThe shipping without counting the numerous Native coast vessels, amounted in 1879 (earlier figures are not at my disposal) to 4,443 ships with a tonnage of three millions, and in 1891 to 8,339 ships with a tonnage of nearly seven millions.\n\nPenang, which also profited from the development of the countries in her neighbourhood, increased as much in size, prosperity and well-being. The population of the town and island, 15 miles long and 9 miles broad, amounted, with Province Wellesley, in 1786 to 600 Malays, in 1812 to 27,000, in 1871 to 133,000, and in 1891 to 235,000 inhabitants. The amount of imports and exports was in 1790 $240,000, in 1867 $20,000,000, and in 1888 $95,000,000. The shipping rose from 1,900 ships with a tonnage of 970,000 in 1872, to 3,400 ships with a tonnage of 1,765,000 in 1878, and 6,078 ships with a tonnage of 3,500,000 in 1890. It seems, to put the mildest construction upon it, to be a gross error to say that the trade of Penang has seriously suffered through the Acheinese war. This complaint has several times been made to the English Government by Penang agitators, and unfortunately has been supported by some of the authorities. Sir Frederick Weld said in a lecture at the Royal Colonial Institute in London on the 10th June, 1884:\u2014\"The pepper trade of Penang with Sumatra has suffered most seriously from the Acheenese war.\"\n\nMalacca, which up till the present day has preserved its Portuguese Dutch features, remained a station of less importance. It was thrown upon its own resources, and made but slow progress.\nThe development of the Negri Sembilan and of Pahang by the construction of a railway will probably result to her advantage, in view of the fact that there are no good ports in Pahang. Its population in 1817 was 20,000, in 1871, 77,000, and was in 1891, 92,000. The trade in 1826 was $1,590,000, in 1860 $4,600,000, and in 1889 nearly $5,000,000. The shipping consisted in 1878 of 1,173 ships, with a tonnage of 340,000, and was improving somewhat, but not much.\n\nAlthough Penang and Singapore thus took an important position, the Protected Native States afforded a no less remarkable spectacle of progress.\n\nLet us begin with Perak. Its population was at first estimated at very different figures, but we may take it that, without counting the wild tribes living in the forests and which were reckoned to comprise 6,000 souls, the Malay population amounted to from 25,000 to 50,000, to which later 40,000 Chinese were to be added. In 1891, this had risen to 213,000, of which 100,000 were Malays.\n\nThe Revenues, arising chiefly from export duties and from the farms, amounted in 1875 to $226,000, and increased continually till they reached in 1891 the figure of 2\u00bd millions. The export duties upon tin are very high, and amount to from 12 to 15 per cent. There seems to be an inexhaustible supply of this metal. More than two-thirds of the tin of the whole world comes from the Straits. The output amounted in 1892 to 636,000 pikuls, representing a value of about 24 million dollars.\n\nAfter paying all its debts, and the costs of the war to England, after having constructed roads and railways, and after having carried out all the other works of public utility and general advantage, Perak still possessed on the first of January, 1891, a cash surplus of $2,000,000. It possesses among other things an excellent little force of 1,000 Sikh soldiers under English Officers. Four hundred of these, almost unaided, brought the Pahang war to an end. On receiving sudden orders, they were, in the space of one hour, ready for marching, and remained four months in the wilds of Pahang, without one of them having to be sent back during that time on account of illness. The figure for export and import was in 1876 one-and-a-half million dollars, ten years later, in 1886, fifteen, and in 1891 it had risen to 18\u00bd millions. Perak possesses excellent ports in Port Weld (in Larut) and Telok Anson on the large and deep River Perak. Both of these are the termini of the existing railways to the tin districts.\nIn Selangor, which in 1891 had a population of 140,000, the number was 30,000 in 1879, and the Revenues, which in 1875 amounted to about $100,000, had risen in 1890 to nearly two millions. The duties upon tin and the farms contributed chiefly to this. Gold mine workings are also found here, and more agriculture than in Perak. It is for this reason that the economical condition of this country is supposed to be healthier than that of Perak. Trade here increased in the same proportion, and you find here in other respects the same favourable state of things as in Perak. Selangor had on the 1st January, 1887, still a debt of $500,000, and on the 1st of January, 1891, a cash surplus of $720,000. The port of Selangor is Klang, the terminus of the railway to the capital of the country, Kuala Lumpur, which is situated inland. The Klang River is shallow higher up, and there is for this reason a proposal to extend the railway to the Kuala, and to make a new port there.\n\nOf Sungei Ujong and the Negri Sembilan, with respective populations of 24 and 40 thousand (the latter having come so much later under British protection), there is not much to say, except that, with the construction of railways and roads, by the help of advances from the Straits Government, the exploiting of tin and agriculture promises them (especially the last mentioned) a good future. Jelebu, one of the Negri Sembilan, which is rich in tin mines, was, in 1885, joined to Sungei Ujong, which possesses little mineral wealth, and is thus thrown more upon agriculture. It (Sungei Ujong) had formerly not 4,000 inhabitants. The revenue in 1886 was $120,000, in 1887 $141,000 and in 1890 had risen to $278,000. On 1st January, 1891, it still owed the Colony $190,000. The port of Sungei Ujong is Port Dickson, with a splendid and safe harbour, from which a railway leads to the capital\u2014Seramban.\n\nThe Negri Sembilan had, in 1886, an income of scarcely $2,500, which, in 1890, had risen to $170,000. On the 1st of January, 1891, it owed $180,000 to the Colony. They are thus just beginning, but are on the right way.\n\nPahang, which possesses rich gold mines, with a population of 35,000, had, in 1890, an income of $62,077 and a debt to the Colony of $372,000, to which are to be added the cost of the last war.\n\nIt remains only to mention Johor. This little State with its population of about 100,000 under its enlightened and energetic\nSultan, surrounded by a capable staff of Europeans, has derived every advantage from its position in the immediate neighbourhood of Singapore. Chinese capital and labour have been attracted there and have brought it to a state of great prosperity and wealth, especially through the cultivation of pepper, gambier and tapioca, as minerals are not found there. The Sultan stays a good deal in Europe, and returned a short time ago from England.\n\nI can add here that the Chinese, who have done everything under British guidance, and still do so, are the pioneers of progress in the Malay Peninsula and in the Settlements. Sir Charles Dilke says of this in his \"Problems of Greater Britain\":\u2014\"Our great success in the Malay Peninsula has lain in enlisting upon our side the warm and ever enthusiastic co-operation of the Chinese. In no part of the world can we point to more obvious results from good government than throughout the Malay Peninsula, where England, in fact, presides over a federation of Malay Princes, to whom we have taught the art of success, but to whose former subjects we have added a vast population of Chinese. The future of Malaya lies in the development of great natural, mineral and agricultural wealth by patient Chinese labour.\"\n\nThis is the case too in Kedah and in the more northern Siamese States, in some of which Penang Chinese have been able to get themselves appointed Rajas. Chinese, too, are members of the Legislative Council, of the Municipal Councils, and of the State Councils. There can be no doubt as to the future of the Malay Peninsula, outside the towns of Penang and Singapore, under an enlightened and liberal-minded Government.\n\nWe have seen that in the Native States, and also in Kedah, the tin industry has been the principal one of the country up till now. However, considerable experiments have been made in the cultivation of rice, pepper, sugar, tapioca, gambier, tobacco, coffee, tea, cocoa, etc., but by far not on a sufficiently large scale to be regarded as a permanent form of cultivation. This can be said of the islands of Singapore and Penang, and of the districts in their immediate neighbourhood\u2014the Province, Malacca, Johor and Kedah\u2014as regards sugar, pepper, gambier and tapioca; in Perak too the cultivation of sugar may be regarded as permanent, but the Straits planters have much to learn from Java as regards cheap and increased production. Cheap transport, local markets, and a low rate of exchange are factors in their favour. Arabian and especially Liberian coffee has been started in all the States. Perak tea has\nbeen very favourably judged in the London market. Pepper is planted everywhere on a small scale; tapioca grows especially in Sungei Ujong and the Negri Sembilan. Experiments with silk worm binding have been made in Perak, and are said to have given good results. Experiments with tobacco, on the other hand, have not been successful. Coco-nuts, betel-nuts, fruits, especially pine-apples, the preserving of which has become a considerable industry, and vegetables are cultivated everywhere and supply chiefly local requirements.\n\nIn the Straits Settlements, one-third is cultivated, and in the Native States scarcely one two-hundredth part. There is thus an abundance of waste land waiting to be developed by capital and enterprise. The Government does its best to encourage this, being convinced of the desirability of obtaining a more permanent form of revenue from agriculture, in view of the uncertainty of tin, the supply of which must some time be exhausted. This has already happened, for instance, in Larut. The income from the opium farm is also dependent upon the tin mines. Land can be obtained everywhere. The first pioneers in the Native States received pieces of land of 1,000 acres (one acre is about $1\\frac{3}{4}$ bouws) quite free. Those who came later paid a rent of 20 cents an acre after the second year, for opening up the land, or three dollars per acre at once, which made them owners of the land. The Government can demand $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. as export duty upon the produce.\n\nThe population of the English part was in 1891, 512,342 for the three Settlements; for the Native States with Johor 518,644; thus about 1,000,000 in all.\n\nThe area of the three Settlements is 1,310 English square miles, and of the Protected States 85,509 square miles. There are thus in the three Settlements, counting the towns of course, nearly 400, and in the States only 15 inhabitants to the English square mile.\n\nFrom this it may be seen that the Malay Peninsula is thinly inhabited, and but little cultivated. By far the largest proportion of this population consists of Chinese, who live at the mines, in the cultivated districts, and especially in the towns along the coasts. Fishing is practised by them on a large scale, and is an important means of existence, and a considerable branch of industry.\n\nMalays live further away from the towns, and supply, just, as in Deli, the daily necessities of the industrial centres, among others ataps and other building materials for the East coast of Sumatra. Cattle rearing is also in their hands, and is a very considerable in-\ndustry, while formerly jungle produce was collected and exported by them on such a large scale that it degenerated into depredation. In Perak, for instance, the export of gutta had to be forbidden to prevent the further destruction of the gum trees. In Perak and Kedah there is an old population settled there centuries before Europeans came. In Selangor and Sungei Ujong, and especially in the Negri Sembilan, much younger settlements are to be found. They are chiefly from Java, Borneo, Celebes, the highlands of Padang, Batta, Korintji, Jambi and elsewhere in Sumatra. Two-thirds of the Malay population of these States were originally Netherlands Indian subjects. In the beginning of the 18th century a settlement of Bugis from Goa in Celebes established themselves in Selangor.\n\nIf agriculture is to be extended as in the case of mining, labour must be imported, chiefly Chinese and Kling, and this is the great difficulty. The Government accordingly spares no pains to meet the planter and assist him in this respect. However, as long as the tin mines last, the Chinese will prefer that kind of work, just as is the case with tobacco on the East coast of Sumatra.\n\nThe Government of the Straits Settlements depends directly, as we have seen, upon the Mother-country, and is carried on by a Governor appointed by the Queen, supported by a Legislative and Executive Council. The majority of the members of the Legislative Council\u2014the \u201cOfficial members\u201d\u2014are so by virtue of their position. They form the Executive Council. The unofficial members, who form the minority, are private individuals, and are partly nominated by the Government and partly elected by the Chambers of Commerce. All bills, all important Government measures, as well as the budget, are laid before the Council and dealt with, and must, after approval, be sanctioned by the Government of the Mother-country; although the official members nearly always vote with the Government, and the opposition can thus have but little influence in any other direction, still its existence has this indisputable advantage, that all Government matters are treated, discussed and decided upon publicly, and this compels the Government to consider carefully what it brings forward, and abstain from everything that will not stand the test of publicity.\n\nYoung officials, after passing an examination in England, are sent out as \u201cCadets\u201d to the Straits, and are there employed in most of the Government positions, except legal, military, and some technical ones. The Judges come from other places. The Colony\ndoes not possess its own army or fleet. The Colony pays a fixed contribution towards the support of the garrison of the Straits which belongs to the English army. The men-of-war of the China squadron visit from time to time different parts of the Colony, whenever it is necessary or desirable. The excellently organized Police, with European officers and staff, consists of Europeans, Sikhs, and Malays, and fulfils all requirements.\n\nIn Penang and Malacca, the Government is represented by Resident Councillors, and though the Governor occupies this place in Singapore, affairs are usually managed, to a certain extent, by the Colonial Secretary, who is the highest official after the Governor. Under these are Magistrates, Collectors and District Officers, who with all others except the Municipal officials are nominated by the Governor. The paid Presidents of the Municipal Council are appointed by the Governor, just as the Residents are in the Native States. One-half of its members are appointed by the Governor, and the other half elected by the voting members of the community.\n\nThe officials in the Native States are appointed by the Sultan after consultation with the Resident. The budgets and laws in these States have to be sanctioned only by the Governor. The Police are under the direct orders of the Resident.\n\nThe Revenues of the Colony, which are contributed to by the three Settlements alone, and are derived from the farms, especially for the sale of opium, stamp fees, land rents, harbour and port duties, fines, &c., amounted in 1868 to about one-and-a-half, and in 1890 to four million dollars. At the end of 1891, the Colony possessed a surplus of two and a quarter million dollars of which, it had but one-and-a-half million as advances to Municipal bodies and Native States.\n\nThe Municipal revenues reach about the following amounts yearly: \u2014Singapore, $500,000; Penang, $300,000; Malacca, $30,000. They are derived from assessment of houses, local land rents, taxes upon vehicles, horses and dogs, the letting of Municipal property, such as markets and sheds, and finally the proceeds of passes, licenses, certificates, water rates, &c.\n\nFrom these are paid the salaries of the Municipal Officials, the contributions to the Colonial Police, the cost of the keeping up of buildings and other institutions, the public roads and bridges, draining and cleansing, street lighting, the fire brigade, &c.\n\nWe have thus in the immediate neighbourhood of our posses-\nsions (where also changes in administrative matters, and decentralisation are being prepared) a remarkable instance although upon a small scale, of administrative and financial decentralisation which works successfully\u2014a central Government with central revenues and budget for the whole Colony, with three Municipal administrations for Singapore, Penang and Malacca, and the five separate Governments of the Protected States, besides the State of Johor, which is independent as regards administration and where everything also goes as well as one can wish.\n\nStill neither here all is perfect, and complaints occur. The Settlements complain that the Protected States do not contribute directly to the Colonial Treasury, although they enjoy the advantages which are derived from the order of things that has been called into existence through the agency of the Straits Settlements.\n\nThis is still less the case with Johor. It is probable that these States will, after some time, either be incorporated in the Colony, or will form with it a federation. Circumstances, too, such as the recent complications between France and Siam, may soon lead the way (which is already prepared) to the annexation of the Siamese Malay States, from Kedah to Mergui and Tringganu with Kelantan all of which are rich in gold and lead. In a speech to the Legislative Council in Singapore in 1887, Sir Frederick Weld, while discussing the policy of the last years, said:\u2014\u201cThis policy will extend itself from Burma southwards, and from Pahang northwards until it includes the whole Peninsula and embraces also those dominions which are now nominally under Siam.\u201d\n\nOther parties, for instance, in Penang, insist upon a further separation in matters of administration, so that the contributions of one Settlement towards the central Treasury may be employed more in and for that Settlement than is the case at present. Out of the central revenues are paid the expenses for salaries and pensions of officials, the cost of the military garrison, the expenses of Justice and Police, the medical service, education, harbours, coast lights and beacons, roads and bridges outside the Municipality, gaols, hospitals, schools, Government buildings, Colonial vessels, etc., etc. Penang pretends that Singapore, the lion town, also gets the lion\u2019s share, much more than is proportionate to her contributions. Thence in Penang a cry for Home Rule. It may be seen from this, that however much decentralisation there may be there will be always parts which consider themselves placed in a disadvantageous position with others.\nThat many affairs are better arranged by our older Colonial Government than by our English neighbours, is recognised by Englishmen of authority, for instance, by Kensington (1892), Money and Boys. I need only mention the government of the Native population through the direct agency of their chiefs\u2014a system that is followed in the Native States.\n\nA bonus of $500 has recently been offered to any officials in the Straits who learn and shew a knowledge of our language, in order to make the Dutch Colonial literature more accessible to the English.\n\nBut there is, I think, also something for us to learn from our neighbours, especially now when we seem to have arrived at an epoch of transition, and therefore I think it would be advantageous if our officials were to go there a little more than they do now, and enquire into and compare the state of things there with that of our own Colonies, and if such visits were not only facilitated but also encouraged. The new regulations on leave are already a step in that direction.\n\nThey would remark, among other things, how the advancement of British trade is the chief aim with every Government, in the Straits or elsewhere, wherever the British flag waves, and that every governing official, however much he may talk of \"humanity and civilisation,\" devotes his attention in the first place to this.\n\nTrade has been the chief factor in making the greatness of that \"Greater Britain\" that Sir Charles Dilke has sketched for us.\n\nEvery official is impregnated with this idea, and nothing strikes an observant and unbiassed visitor to the English Colonies so much as the zealous and indefatigable devotion of all, each in his own circle to the furtherance of this greatness of the British Empire, even when such endeavours are frequently made at a sacrifice of personal interests and comfort.\n\nThis is the cause of the great national pride that Englishmen possess, which may appear silly and narrow to the foreigner, but fills them however with that prodigious self-confidence, which leads to great deeds.\n\nThis British Empire forms a body of which England is the heart. Whatever forms of Government the different parts may assume, as regards the important points of protection, free trade, Imperial federation, still every man in England follows with interest the events in these parts, and every one outside of it thinks with love, reverence and pride of his \"old England\" and always goes back there. We might well learn that from them. How often do we\nhear the Motherland spoken of depreciatingly and ungratefully in the Colonies? What little interest again, do most Dutchmen show in Colonial matters?\n\nThanks to the circumstance that young people in England are not unnecessarily crammed with all sorts of learning, but try to acquire what is useful for a definite sphere of work, so that most of them are behind other nations in so-called general development they have always time for healthy exercise, for their \"sport,\" and thus become accustomed to privation, are strong, hardy, enterprising, sober, and little given to sensual enjoyment, pleasure-seeking or excessive sentimentality.\n\nThus in different English Colonies may be seen how old and young, high and low, ladies and gentlemen, and even natives, take part in this \"sport,\" and how the courage, strength, agility, dexterity and \"pluck\" of their European rulers excites the admiration and especially the sympathy of the Natives.\n\nIndeed the intercourse between the higher and lower grades in both the official and military classes is quite different to what it is with us. There is much more mutual confidence and comradeship in it, more good nature, if I may so speak. The same may be observed in the intercourse with the Natives. There is one law for all without distinction of race or religion, and it is quickly acted upon.\n\nGood officials in the Straits are kept as long as possible in the same posts, and when they go on leave, which occurs frequently (so that they keep touch with the Mother-country, and do not become Indians) the post is generally filled up by an acting officer until they return. They are thus altogether intimate with the duties attaching to that post, and are quite absorbed, in the interest that are entrusted to them, which they can and often do watch during their leave. From 1878 to 1889 there was one Resident in Perak, Sir Hugh Low, and from 1885 to 1890, I knew four different Residents in the much more important Residency of the East Coast of Sumatra; they had no time to become duly acquainted with the country.\n\nIn conclusion, I must finish with a word that has no direct bearing upon the subject under discussion, but which, I feel, I must not leave unsaid.\n\nThe same policy that Sir F. Weld described as the goal to be aimed at on the Malay Peninsula is consolidating itself also in North Borneo, in New Guinea, and is surrounding our Archipelago\nelsewhere with a girdle of English possessions.\n\nThis and other circumstances mentioned in this paper should remind us as a small nation, but with rich and large Colonies, and as the second colonial power of the times in which we live, to caution and urge us to move with the times.\n\nIn our East Indian possessions, where there are such great resources, and there is such a rich field for work, we shall, I think, accomplish better results, if we recognize more generally, that the time is past for maintaining our power by artificial means, and if we give our governing officials (especially those outside of Java) opportunities, each in his own sphere, to act more independently and thus, with the means at their disposal in their sphere, by decentralization, to further the development of the immeasurable resources of the country, to the good of the population, and the welfare of the Mother-country.\n\nThis can then be, in the words of Mr. Van Genner, in the sitting of the First Chamber of the 28th December, the beginning of a new period, of which we may expect the best results in the fields of politics, economics, and finance.\n\nSteam and electricity have abolished distances. The press discusses everything. The Natives know what occurs elsewhere and thus as a Madurese Chief once expressed himself \"by building our forts in the hearts of the Natives\" we can strengthen ourselves and meet the future with confidence.\nDISCUSSION\n\nON\n\nMR. KRUYT'S PAPER.\n\nMr. G. E. V. L. van Zuylen.\u2014As none of the gentlemen present seem disposed to discuss any of the points raised in Mr. Kruyt's excellent address, may I be permitted to ask the honourable reader of the address one question as to a matter of detail, viz., how matters stand at present as regards the digging of a canal through the Isthmus of Kra? There were two plans in connection with the isthmus\u2014one to dig a canal through it, and the other to construct a railway for ships across it as has been done in Canada. Is either of these plans still spoken of?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014I believe the plans have been given up. Anything of this kind would not be in accordance with the interests of England, and as the influence of England there has greatly increased it is not likely that the scheme will be brought into prominence again. There is a Chinese Raja there who is Penang born and a British subject. He will take good care that nothing happens that can be in conflict with the wishes of the British.\n\nMr. van Zuylen.\u2014I ask the question, as I imagine that if the canal were dug it would be a matter of no small importance to us.\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014I agree with you that it could be of some importance to us.\n\nMr. P. J. van Houten.\u2014I should like to ask Mr. Kruyt the following question. What does the honourable gentleman think about Pulau Weh? Can this port attain to any importance? Could it in future be detrimental to Penang and Singapore? I doubt it myself. It is useless to make of it a coaling-station for Ombilien coals which cannot be employed in every kind of steamship traffic. It is necessary therefore to bring in the first place Newcastle and Cardiff coals there suitable for long voyages. This, however, can only be done at a great cost, as transport to Pulau Weh would be dearer than to Singapore, because in the latter port ships would be sure of getting a cargo. This would not be the case in Pulau Weh. I do not therefore anticipate much in the future\nfor Pulau Weh. Is that opinion shared by the honourable gentleman?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014I also do not anticipate any great future for Pulau Weh. The first condition necessary for the development of Pulau Weh is wanting. First of all an orderly state of things in Acheen must be established, and then with careful management\u2014it being of course taken for granted that there is a coaling depot there\u2014the pepper trade of Acheen might gradually be concentrated there. It is of course a matter of indifference to the Chinese whether they sell their pepper at Penang or at Pulau Weh, provided they get a proper profit. But the Achinese ask for more. They do not go to Penang to sell alone, but also to buy. They take this opportunity of making a little journey. A journey of this kind to Penang is a pleasure-trip; they go to the wayang, to the Malay comedy, and to other places. When they are able to find all this at Pulau Weh, it might become the central port for North Sumatra. Would Pulau Weh then become an important port for European ships?\n\nThe only foreign ships to whose interest it might be to take coals at Pulau Weh at dearer prices are the Russian and French men-of-war and perhaps some tea-steamers as the island lies in a better position than Singapore as a half-way place on the route between Europe and North China. I do not believe, however, that Pulau Weh will ever become the trade emporium that some people imagine.\n\nMr. van Zuylen.\u2014If I have understood you rightly, you mean to say that if Achinese affairs are put in a better state this port might be one of importance for North Sumatra.\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014Yes, if the business is taken seriously in hand and the circumstance is not lost sight of that the Achinese must find the same facilities and the same treatment as he has always met with in the Straits.\n\nMr. W. Elout van Souterwonde.\u2014If I venture, Mr. President, to put a question with reference to one of the many subjects touched upon by the honourable gentleman, I must first say that his excellent address has interested me in the highest degree. One subject touched upon by him especially struck me, viz., the prosperous condition of the Chinese in the Straits and their influence there. We have heard that Sir Charles Dilke in his \"Greater Britain\" praised the Chinese for having been the means of developing the Straits and we have been told of a Chinaman, born in the\nStraits, who has become a Raja of one of the Native tribes. Now I should like to hear from the honourable gentleman, especially with regard to the opium-farm, if the influence of the Chinese is about the same in his opinion over the Natives as it is in Java. Further, I should like to ask if the other farms are in the hands of the Chinese, and if the Government has ever experienced any trouble from the presence of the Chinese in the Straits in such large numbers. If I am not mistaken it has been more than once necessary to take active measures against the secret societies? The Chinese have, I believe, in the Straits their own chiefs to a certain extent, but I gather from what Mr. Kruyt has told us that they have the same position as regards the Courts of Justice as Europeans. I should very much like to be further enlightened upon this matter. It is, Mr. President, certainly somewhat indiscreet on my part to put all these questions, but the Chinese seem to be so much better received on the Peninsula and so much more favourably judged than in other places they have gone to, that it would be most interesting to learn something more on the subject.\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014The Chinese in the Straits are perfectly free except the Chinese secret societies, which are under strict surveillance. Those who do anything contrary to the regulations in this matter are dealt with very severely, and the leaders are often banished to China. The farms are all in the hands of the Chinese. The native Malay population is small compared to the Chinese. The Chinese are not under their own chiefs, but are under the same laws as the rest of the population. The Chinese have a high sense of their own worth. I have often observed that people from our Colonies, for instance, naval officers and officials, were annoyed that the Chinese did not shew them a sufficient politeness, for instance, that they did not make way for them. I have always found the Chinese most polite, but it depends upon how one treats them. They possess, and one should not forget this, a feeling of equality.\n\nThe authorities in British India and in the Straits would not like to see the opium revenues decrease, as these form the most important source of revenue and if they fell off the whole financial system would fall into confusion. In Penang, there is a Chinese bank. The only European who is there is one of the junior clerks. The bank is in prosperous circumstances, due, most likely, to the activity of the directors. The Chinese are from early morning till late in the evening on the spot, while Europeans open late and close early. If you come to their place after closing-time, you hear\nvery soon \"Come to-morrow, the office is open at 10 o'clock.\" The Chinese look on Penang and Singapore as Chinese places, the administration of which is left to the English.\n\nMr. G. A. de Lange.\u2014Do the Chinese live in different quarters?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014No.\n\nMr. Elout van Souterwonde.\u2014Are other farms besides the opium farm in the hands of the Chinese?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014There are in the Straits somewhat the same farms as we have\u2014gambling, pawn-houses, spirits, etc. All these are in the hands of the Chinese.\n\nMr. T. H. der Kinderen.\u2014I should like to hear from the honourable gentleman something as to the legal position of the Chinese, not only in Penang and Singapore, but in the whole of the Straits Settlements where they form a considerable portion of the population. Are they under the English law as regards civil matters as well as regards criminal law? How are they situated particularly as regards their personal rights? For instance, by what restrictions and rules are their marriages governed? How do they stand as regards their laws of inheritance? Are their own customs and institutions, as they are in China, followed, or are the English laws adhered to?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014The civil and criminal law is the same for all; all come before the same Judge. The place is full of lawyers. The Chinese are, by nature, fond of litigation. For a trifle, for a fowl that is not worth a guilder, they will run to a lawyer and pay $50 to fight the matter out. As regards marriages, etc., Chinese customs are adhered to, but there is an institution there that is unknown in Java, viz., the Chinese Protectorate. The Protector of Chinese, is as it were, the head of the Chinese. Assisted by a good staff, he looks after everything that concerns the Chinese, for instance, in matters connected with the rights of inheritance in which Chinese customs are followed as far as they do not conflict with the usages of civilised nations. This is a good institution.\n\nMr. der Kinderen.\u2014There are then no special Judges for Natives and Chinese?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014No.\n\nMr. der Kinderen.\u2014How is justice administered in the States where a Resident is at the head of affairs?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014The State Court is there with a Chief Magistrate and in smaller places there are District Courts with Magistrates\nat the head supported by Native assessors. There, justice is administered according to the same laws and regulations as in the Straits, but with reference to \"adat\" and religion. In this respect, Natives and Chinese are on the same footing as Europeans.\n\nMr. der Kinderen.\u2014Is the adoption of children regulated by law? Are the usages of China followed?\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014I cannot say that. I know there are Chinese who adopt children but I do not know what the laws are as regards the adoption of children.\n\nMr. van Houten.\u2014Mr. President, there is still another question that I should like to ask the honourable gentleman. It is said that three-fourths of the trade of Penang is with Sumatra. That is perhaps exaggerated on our side, but if half of it is with Sumatra it is important enough, and for that reason I should like to ask the honourable gentleman if, in his opinion, it is not possible to divert a part of that trade to our territory by making either Belawan or Telok Semawe free ports, so that we could have great dep\u00f4ts where ships could unload, and what was sold could be shipped to the different districts in the neighbourhood.\n\nPerhaps other means might be found and employed, as the portion of Penang is naturally very strong. The commercial houses there are now firmly established and have a fixed business with all kinds of steam and sailing vessels; they have their agents and correspondents everywhere, so that it will be difficult to win trade away from them. However, I think the matter is worth some exertion, as we should get not only the export trade into our hands but the import trade too, which is certainly not less important.\n\nMr. Kruyt.\u2014Pepper can certainly be brought elsewhere. Since the establishment of the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Paketvaartmaatschappij, a step has been made in that direction, where the freights are not opposed to it. It is established that cheap freights are the most important factor in this matter, and now that the ships of the Paketvaartmaatschappij visit the whole island of Sumatra, this is, in a great measure, in their hands. Trade generally goes where it is served most quickly, most easily and most cheaply. Where these factors exist, viz., cheap, quick and easy dealing, there will trade certainly be attracted. As soon as articles can be obtained as cheap and as good from Batavia as from Penang, they may be brought from there to Deli. The creation of free ports will, I believe, be of little assistance. The declaring of Belawan to be a free port will not divert trade. Many\nyears must pass before trade can be diverted. The great advantage of the ports in the Straits is that they are centres of trade, and that they lie on the great highway of traffic and close by. No day passes without ten, twelve or fifteen steamers going in and out of Penang and Singapore.\n\nMr. Van Houten.\u2014After the last answer of the honourable gentleman, I may observe that I do not see any great objection to the low import duties levied at our Indian custom-houses\u2014one can always leave wares in the depot\u2014but I think that at all places where custom duties are levied the formalities which one has to comply with during importing and exporting prevent trade from being drawn thither.\n\nMr. Kruijt.\u2014The journey from Belawan to Batavia lasts three or four days, and if there were need for it more steamers would soon be put upon this run. As soon as the planters in Deli can provide themselves as well and as cheaply from Batavia they will probably get things from Java. But this condition does not exist at present. The nearer ports in the Straits offer also greater facilities in other respects.\n\nThe President.\u2014As no one wishes to make any further remarks, I close the meeting with a vote of thanks to Mr. Kruijt for his interesting and instructive address.\nAturan Sungei Ujong.\n\nThis is the origin of the Waris Sungei Ujong in their two branches, that is to say, the Waris di Darat and the Waris di Ayer.\n\nA Sultan of Johor had three children\u2014the eldest a daughter, the second a son, and the third a daughter.\n\nThe eldest Princess had a son, to whom was given the title of Bendahara. The Prince succeeded his father as Sultan, and had sway over three kingdoms. The younger Princess had two children: the elder, a son, was given the title of Temenggong, and founded the State of Muar. The younger, a daughter, married her cousin the Bendahara, and bore a daughter, named To\u2019 Tunggal Titek. The Tungku Bendahara, with his wife and child and his five chiefs, came to Kuala Linggi. These were the (titles of the) five chiefs. First, the Dato\u2019 Raja Mambang; 2nd, Sri Maharaja Chulan; 3rd, Paduka Raja; 4th, To\u2019 Gantam Saribu; 5th, Panglima Besar Laut. Now when the Bendahara had ascended the river as far as Sempang Rembau he debated with his five chiefs as to how they should proceed, and while they were discussing, some sugar cane refuse and a head of jagong (Indian corn) came floating past them. Then said the Tengku Bendahara: \u201cThere must be inhabitants up the left branch of the stream; let us ascend it,\u201d so he gave the order, and they ascended the river to Pengkalan Durian, where they made fast their prahu, and landed and followed a beaten track till they were close to the Batin\u2019s house.\n\nTengku Bendahara then proceeded to fire a shot from his gun, and hid himself in the jungle. The Batin hearing the shot came out to see where it came from, but seeing no one, returned to his house. The Bendahara then fired three shots more and again concealed himself. The Batin came out as before and seeing no one he cried out, \u201cWho is this that has fired twice and remains invisible? Come out, whether he be man or spirit, and thou shalt be my master\u201d (Penghulu). When the Tengku Bendahara heard that, he came out at once and presented himself to\nthe Batin. The Batin looked at him, and prostrating himself said: \"O my lord, you shall indeed be my Penghulu.\" So the Batin went with Tengku Bendahara to his prahu where they feasted and ate and drank. And when the Tengku Bendahara asked him, the Batin said, \"My name is Saribu Jaya and I am 'the Penghulu of all the Jakuns in this country.' \" So the Tengku Bendahara, after he had remained there a while entertaining the Batin, asked the Batin to lead him up-stream to some place where he could make a settlement. The Batin gladly consented to accompany him, and they went further up the river to Silian. There the Tungku Bendahara built an Istana, and many people came to pay their respects to him, and the country was named Sungei Ujong. And the Tengku Bendahara married his daughter Tunggal Titek to Raja Mambang, who was of the Benor (?) people.\n\nThey had five children\u2014the eldest of whom was Penghulu Silian; the second, Penghulu Salat; the third, a daughter, named Dato' Semarga; the fourth, a son, named To' Mohamad Jumbu who was styled Penghulu Klambu; and the fifth, a daughter, named the Dato' Sri Mani.\n\nNow after a time the Tengku Bendahara sent for the To' Batin, and thus spoke to him: \"O my brother, I have sent for you because I desire to leave to you the care of my children such as they are. You know them, and, O my brother, treat them not other than your own children and teach them.\" The To' Batin prostrated himself and said, \"I will carry out whatever my lord has ordered.\" Then the Tengku Bendahara sailed away to Pahang and returned no more, and from the time of his going the To' Batin ever continued to look after the children and grandchildren of Tengku Bendahara. Pengulu Silian returned to the Mercy of God and was buried at Silian. His brothers, Penghulu Selat and Penghulu Klambu sent for the To' Batin Saribu Jaya to come to Sungei Ujong, and when he had come, Penghulu Selat said: \"O nenek (grandfather), I have sent for you because I desire to seek some other place to live in. Help us to find some other favourable place.\" The Batin replied \"I will go with you wherever you desire.\" Then Penghulu Selat and Dato' Klambu and Dato' Semarga, and Dato' Sri Mani went up the river till they came to Rahang. There they determined to settle, and the To' Batin returned to Pengkalan Durian. And after\nPenghulu Selat and Dato' Klambu had made a settlement at Rahang many of the Jakun people came to them and were received into the faith of Islam and many traders also visited them. The Dato' Semarga, sister of Penghulu Selat, was married to an Acheene from Pasi who was styled Dato' Rambutan Jantan. From these came three children: the first, Dato' Kling; the 2nd, a daughter, named Dato' Dara Darani; the 3rd, a daughter, styled Dato' Pinang Panjang Rambut. The Dato' Sri Mani, who married Perdana Amping, having no children, adopted the Dato' Pinang Panjang Rambut as her daughter, and lived at Ampangan. Penghulu Selat made a settlement at Setul, and married the daughter of a Batin. They had no children, but Penghulu Selat adopted a Jakun of his wife's family, who had adopted the faith of Islam, as his son and gave him a place in his house. When Penghulu Selat returned to the Mercy of God Most High his adopted son inherited all his kampong and other property. He married and his descendants multiplied. Now as to Dato' Klambu, on a certain day he went to Sempang Ampat, near Beranang, and there he saw a Jakun woman, the daughter of Batin Raja, the Jakun Penghulu. Her name was Ma' Seraya and she found favour in the eyes of Dato' Klambu. He asked the Batin to give her to him in marriage, and, with the Batin's consent, took her to Rahang, where he married her and she adopted Islam. They had three children: the first, a son named Jintek; the second, a daughter, named Dara; the third, a son, named Musang.\n\nOne day the Dato' Klambu sent for the To'Batin Saribu Jaya, and To'Batin Mambut, and Nenek Jenang; and when they had come he thus spoke to the two Batins: \"I have sent for you, Nenek, to consult you about the titles and dwelling-places of my children and my 'anak buah,' the children of Dato' Semarga. I am going to send all my children to live at Pantai Layang, and to appoint Jintek to be Penghulu for all of them that dwell in the country of Batin Mambut, and one of my nephews (anak buah) shall be Bandar to govern all who live in the country of Batin Saribu Jaya.\" Then Dato' Klambu enquired what were the boundaries of the Batins' countries, and the Batins told him. \"From 'Jeram Jipon, Bukit Sepam, Ginting Paung towards the ulu as 'far as Bukit Bukan; the hills and valleys (Gaung Gun tong) be longed to Batin Mambut; and from there downstream to the sea 'belonged to To'Batin Sribu Jaga.\" Dato' Klambu said, \"Be it\n\"so, but my children (by the Batin's daughter Ma'Seraya) and \"my 'anak buah' (relations on the male side) will have hence \"forth their separate districts. If there is ever any question \"that concerns the whole country, they must consult together, \"and not act separately. Also, the Raja, who shall be guided by \"the 'adat Temenggong,' must be from Johor.\"\n\nThen D\u00e2to' Klambu fixed the titles and dwelling places of his descendants, and the Batins returned each to his own place. His children were taken by the To'Batin to Pantai Layang and were looked after by the Old Man (Nenek) Jenang. In course of time D\u00e2to' Klambu returned to the Mercy of God Most High and was buried at Rahang, and the place is named Klambu even to this day.\n\nPenghulu Jintek married the daughter of To' Alun Tujoh, and D\u00e2to' Musang married the daughter of Batin Mambut, and D\u00e2to' Dara married the son of Nenek Jenang.\n\nNow after the death of D\u00e2to' Klambu, Penghulu Jintek addressed the Bandar as follows: \"By the dying directions of our father, D\u00e2to' Klambu, we are to be vassals of the kingdom of Johor; what is to be done, O brother?\" So they consulted, and finally Penghulu Jintek went to Johor, and the Bandar Kling, remained in charge of the country. When Penghulu Jintek got to Johor he presented himself before Sultan Abd-el-Jalil, who declared as follows: \"The four Penghulus of Sungei Ujong, Johol, Naning and Jelebu are no longer subject to me, for I have transferred my authority over them to the Raja of Menangkabau. Let the four Penghulus address him.\" Then the Sultan explained to Penghulu Jintek how he came to transfer his suzerainty to Menangkabau: \"On a certain day a man came to present a nangka (Jackfruit) to my father the Sultan at Kota Tinggi. On the way he met the wife of Mokeh Segama, who being great with child, desired the nangka, and asked for a piece of it. He gave her a little of it, and then went on, and presenting himself before my father, asked him to accept the nangka. My father accepted it, and then saw that the nangka was not a whole one. 'What is this?' he said, 'how does this nangka come to have a piece out of it?' 'O my lord,' the man said, 'this is nothing, only that the wife of Mokeh Segama being great with child, wanted some nangka and asked your slave for a little, and your slave being sorry for her gave her a little. O my lord, have mercy on your slave and\n\" forgive this offence.\" When my father heard that, wrath arose in him, and he ordered the wife of Mokeh Segama to be arrested. So they went out and searched for her, and brought the woman before my father, and my father ordered her to be cut open. And they had her cut open according to my father's order, and they found the child in her womb holding the nangka with both hands. It was also dead, and they buried them with the usual rites. Now when this happened Mokeh Segama was away, and on his return my father summoned him to his presence. Mokeh Segama presented himself before my father who said to him 'I have sent for you, O Mokeh Segama, to announce to you that I have caused your wife to be cut open because she took a piece out of my nangka.' Mokeh Segama bowed low and said 'O my lord, I am beneath your feet, and whatever the justice of my lord has ordered, to that do I bow my head.' Then the Mokeh Segama asked leave to withdraw himself.\n\nIt fell on a day after this that my father was going to bathe in state accompanied by his chiefs and Mokeh Segama and a retinue suited to his dignity, and while he was on the way Mokeh Segama attacked and stabbed him on the leg. The white (royal) blood was shed, and thus he died, and returned to the Mercy of God. Then Mokeh Segama ran amok and threw himself upon our people. Many perished and many were wounded in the fighting that followed. I myself was nearly overcome, and sent for assistance to the Raja of the Buggis and the Raja of Menangkabau. Both of them came, bringing their people and munitions of war, and made war against Mokeh Segama who was at length captured and put to death, and his followers scattered. Now after the capture of Mokeh Segama, the men of the Raja Buggis and the Raja of Menangkaban's men fell out over the division of the spoil. The Buggis men said they had captured Mokeh Segama and the Menangkabau men said they had. And becoming enraged in the dispute, they ran amok, and many men were slain and wounded. I, therefore, sent word to both the Rajas to withdraw their people, as they were violating the laws of my country; so the two Rajas withdrew their people, and put an end to the disturbance. For this reason I made concessions to the two Rajas. To the Raja Buggis I granted the sovereignty of Rhio, because his rule is over the sea. To the Raja of Menangkabau I granted the four countries of\n\"Sungei Ujong, Johol, Naning and Jelebu, because he is an inland Raja. And I myself, in succession to my father, ascended to the Rajaship of Johor. The two Rajas retired, each to his own country, and thus it is that the four States have been handed over to Menangkabau, and the four Penghulus must go and present themselves before the Raja of Menangkabau.\"\n\nAfter this, Penghulu Jintek returned to Sungei Ujong and held a consultation with the other three Penghulus. They decided to do as Sultan Abdul Jalil had advised, and sent an Ambassador to the Raja of Menangkabau. The Ambassador departed, and while he was away Penghulu Jintek died and was succeeded by Penghulu Musang.\n\nNow when the Ambassador reached Menangkabau he was refused audience by the Raja. He, therefore, went to Siak and, presenting himself before the Raja of Siak told him what Sultan Abdul Jalil had said. So the Raja of Siak, brought the Ambassador with him and presented him to the Raja of Menangkabau. And when the envoy had humbly declared the objects of his mission, the Raja of Menangkabau ordered that it should be done as the four Penghulus wished, and added that if they would adopt his customs he would himself visit their country.\n\nThen the envoy was sent back, and the Raja of Menangkabau promised to send one of the Rajas under him to the country of the four Penghulus. So the envoy returned to the four Penghulus and related what had occurred, and the four Penghulus issued a Proclamation to all their people: \"Our allegiance to Johor is broken. We are vassals to the Raja of Menangkabau and our ties (bertali) are with the State of Siak.\" And each departed to his own country.\n\nIn due time after this, Raja Kasah came from Menangkabau, sent by the Raja of that country, and the four Penghulus received him. He was unable, however, to introduce the laws of Menangkabau as the four Penghulus desired. At this time Bandar Kling died and was succeeded by Bandar Saleh. After Rajah Kasah, came Raja Adil. He fixed his dwelling-place at Danan Boya where the four Penghulus and the Bandar went to pay their respects to him and to ask him to introduce his laws. He also was unable to revise the customs of the country, and the four Penghulus and the Bandar each went back to his own State. Penghulu Musang died, and was succeeded by Penghulu Kadim, during\nthe Bandarship of Bandar Saleh. After this, Raja Adil went back to Menangkabau and was succeeded by Raja Khatib. He also did not know how to introduce new customs. And the four Penghulus were amazed and said: \"The Raja of Menangkabau promised he would grant us a Raja who would establish his laws in the four countries; now we have had three Rajas who have done nothing at all.\" Then Raja Khatib went away and after him came Raja Malewa, who established himself at Penajih in Rembau. Penghulu Kadim died and was succeeded by Penghulu Bertatah, the Bandar being Bandar Locho.\n\nRaja Malewa subsequently went to Jelebu and dwelt beside a certain river, and sent for the four Penghulus. The four Penghulus and the Bandar set out in obedience to the order of the Raja, and having arrived at a certain hill, they halted and held a consultation as to what Raja Malewa could want with them. Then they proceeded on their way, and the name of that hill is now Perhentian Terhimpun, because the four Penghulus and the Bandar assembled there.\n\nAnd when they had reached the presence of the Raja he addressed them as follows:\u2014\"We have been commanded by the Raja who is at Pagaruyong to visit the D\u00e2to' of these coun-tries and we have been commanded to establish there the law of Menangkabau, that is, the law of To' Perpateh. Now, O D\u00e2to', do you wish to adopt these laws or not?\" The four Penghulus and the Bandar replied: \"We all desire the custom of To' Perpateh.\" Thus was the law laid down by Raja Malewa. In the first place, it was ordained, that a man who marries should refer as to his wife's property to his wife's relations (tempat semunda). Secondly, in case of divorce, the property must be divided; the wife's property to be returned (to her family), what remains, to be divided between the two. Thirdly, he who wounds shall be wounded, he who kills shall give a life in compensation (mati berdendang.) Fourthly, inheritance shall not be through the children (but through the brother's children), and the waris (heirs) on the female side shall succeed in turn (bergelar). Fifthly, compensation (balasan) shall not be sought from a man's children but from his blood relations on the wife's side. When Raja Malewa had declared the above laws he enquired of the Penghulu Rumah Bertatah and Bandar Locho from whence they derived their origin, and the Penghulu related\nto him his history, as has been stated. \"O my lord, I am a\n\"grandson of Penghulu Klambu, and my brother the Bandar is\n\"grandson of D\u00e2to' Semarga. The D\u00e2to' Klambu and D\u00e2to' Se-\n\"marga were brothers, and the children of D\u00e2to' Klambu inherit\n\"the Penghuluship, while the children of D\u00e2to' Semarga inherit\n\"the Bandarship. They rule separately. From Jeram Chipan,\n\"Bukit Sepam, Ghinting Paung to the Ulu is under my authority,\n\"from there down to the sea belongs to the Bandar. This is\n\"clear and understood by each. In any matter that concerns the\n\"whole country, I must consult with the Bandar, not act without\n\"him. This is a tradition handed down from my ancestors.\"\n\nWhen Raja Malewa heard this and understood that there\nwere two branches of the Waris Sungei Ujong\u2014the descendants\nof D\u00e2to' Klambu and of D\u00e2to' Semarga\u2014he named one the\n\"Waris di Darat\" and the other the \"Waris di Ayer.\"\n\nHe also conferred titles on the four Penghulus. The Peng-\nhulu of Sungei Ujong he styled \"Orang Kaya Klana Petra\nPetrakutuan.\" He so styled him because he was of Raja origin,\nand settled that if the Rajaship of the four countries should ever\nbe unfilled, the Klana should act in place of the Raja for the time\nbeing. The Penghulu of Johol he styled \"Orang Kaya Mentri\nJohan Pahlawan Leila Perkara.\" The Penghulu of Naning\nbecame \"Orang Kaya Maharaja Murah,\" and the Penghulu of\nJelebu \"Manek Mentri Akirzaman.\" The Bandar alone received\nno new title.\n\nThen Raja Malewa desired the Klana and the Bandar to\nappoint chiefs amongst the Waris to exercise authority under\nthemselves. They held a consultation and finally selected a\ngrandson of D\u00e2to' Sri Mani, and a grandson of D\u00e2to' Semarga.\nThe former received from the Raja the title of \"Mandika,\" as a\nLembaga (chief) under the Klana; the later was styled \"Mahar-\naja di Raja,\" as Lembaga of the Waris di Ayer. These titles\nare handed down amongst the respective Waris.\n\nRaja Malewa also conferred insignia on the four Penghulus\nand the Bandar, viz., 2 spears (benderang), 2 swords, 2 long\nkrises, 2 tongkuls, 2 pajar machin siang, 2 ular-ular, 2 flags, and\nauthorised them to fire five guns on State occasions.\n\nTo the Lembaga he allowed the same insignia as above, but\nthey may only fire three guns and no more. Having conferred\ntitles and insignia, Raja Malewa confirmed each of the four Peng-\nhulus in the government of his own country, nor did he impose any taxes, reserving only certain dues to himself as suzerain. He directed that in the event of any war or disturbances the Penghulu should refer to him.\n\nRaja Malewa then returned to Penajih in Rembau, and when he had arrived there the Penghulus and the Bandar met (again) in conference, and elected Raja Malewa to be their Raja with the title of \"Yam Tuan.\" They invited him as Yam Tuan to live at Sri Menanti, and Rembau became known as the \"Tanah Karaja'an\" (the Raja's country), while Sri Menanti was the \"Tanah Mengandong\" (the Raja's abode).\n\nWhen the Klana Rumah Bertatah had returned to the Mercy of God Most High, he was succeeded by Klana Badur in the Bandarship of Bandar Bangkit. In course of time Raja Malewa returned to Menangkabau, and in his stead came Raja Lenggang to dwell in the Istana of Yam Tuan Raja Malewa. The four Penghulus met and elected Raja Lenggang to the Yam Tuanship in succession to Raja Malewa.\n\nRaja Lenggang married, and the name of his son was Raja Radin. And when Raja Lenggang died the four Penghulus assembled and elected his son Raja Radin to succeed his father as Yam Tuan. Now Raja Radin having become Yam Tuan, another Raja named Sati came from Menangkabau in order to succeed Raja Lenggang as Yam Tuan. The four Penghulus refused to receive him, as they had already elected a Yam Tuan of the Raja stock of Menangkabau. Then Raja Sati was wroth and had recourse to arms. In the fighting that ensued he was defeated and fled, and the son of Raja Lenggang was established in the Yam Tuanship. Since that time there has been no other Raja from Menangkabau.\n\nBandar Bangkit died and was succeeded by Bal'dar Mogah. Now the Yam Tuan Rajah Radin paid frequent visits to Sungei Ujong, and used to halt for the night at Parui in Sungei Ujong. He was displeased that there was no one there to provide him with lodging and food and drink, so the Klana and the Bandar consulted together to appoint a Penghulu Dagang for Parui who should attend to the wants of the Yam Tuan in his journeys to and fro. Having consulted they appointed as Penghulu Dagang the grandson of Batin Ghalong, (\u0646\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064f\u063a\u0652) and for his subsistence\nallowed him to collect taxes on the produce of the district.\u2014fowls, and ducks, and goats and buffaloes, and tin, etc., etc.\n\nKlana Badur died and was succeeded by Klana Leha in the Bandarship of Bandar Mogah. It was the Klana Leha who consulted with the Bandar about appointing chiefs to have authority under the D\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Maharaja di Raja. They appointed the D\u00e2to\u2019 Mentri and D\u00e2to\u2019 Leilah Bangsa, and D\u00e2to\u2019 Ma\u2019raja Leilah and D\u00e2to\u2019 Johan, and D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja di Muda, each to be head of his respective suku (tribe) in the Waris di Darat. The Bandar appointed, under the D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Si Ma\u2019raja, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Paduka Raja, and D\u00e2to\u2019 Panglima Besar (for the Waris di Ayer). Now when in time the Klana Leha had returned to the Mercy of God, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika took counsel with the I\u00e2to\u2019s under him, and without consulting the Bandar or the D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja, they chose Klana Bahi to succeed Klana Leha. Upon this the I\u00e2to\u2019 Ma\u2019raja di Raja went to the I\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar, and the Bandar having ordered him to make inquiries, he went to Pantai to question the I\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika. \u201cWho has elected the Klana?\u201d he said, and the I\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika answered \u201cKlana Bahi has been elected.\u201d To this the I\u00e2to\u2019 Raja replied \u201cWait, D\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika, till the guns are ready,\u201d and then departed.\n\nSoon after this, one day when Klana Bahi had gone to bathe, Kawal appeared at his house and asked the Klana Bahi\u2019s wife to show him the Klana\u2019s seal. The Klana\u2019s wife fetched the seal, and while she was showing it to him, he snatched it away, and made away with it straight to the I\u00e2to\u2019 Raja. The D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja took it to the Bandar who thereupon ordered that Kawal should be made Klana. This was done, and Kawal was declared Klana and proceeded to Pantai. A fight ensued, in which Panglima Besar Hadji Saleh was wounded in the arm by a bullet. By the intervention of the I\u00e2to\u2019 Raja, a meeting was arranged between Klana Pabi and Klana Kawal, and hostilities were suspended. Finally, Klana Bahi retired in anger to Setul, and shortly afterwards he died there, and no one was afterwards elected Klana in his stead. Now Klana Kawal appointed his younger brother named Sindarg to be Laksan ana with the same rank of Panglima Besar, and he was the first Laksan ana in the State. The Laksan ana is the first of the Klana\u2019s officers, and the Panglima Besar is the first of the Pandar\u2019s (kepala juhak). And because the descendants of the adopted son of Penghulu Salat had be-\ncome numerous, the D\u00e2to' Klana and the D\u00e2to' Bandar consulted what should be done with them. They named them the Waris Si Silah because they were not the direct descendants of Penghulu Salat, but only by adoption. They inherited the titles of To' Batin, and To' Leila Perkara, and To' Datar. The To' Batin was their Penghulu or Undang and had jurisdiction over the hills and valleys of the deep forest. The To' Leila Perkara and the To' Datar were their Lembaga, and ruled the cultivated kampongs and fields (kampong yang bersudut, sawah yang berlo-pak.) It was ordered that they should appear with the D\u00e2to' Mendika to pay their respects (to the Klana) at the Hari Raya, and should any quarrel or disturbance arise which they might be unable to settle they were to refer the matter to the D\u00e2to' Klana and the D\u00e2to' Bandar. On the occasion of the Klana's feasts or ceremonies they were expected to provide saffron and pepper and yams and kladi, and other jungle produce for his use.\n\nWhen the Klana Kawal died he was succeeded by Laksamana Sindang\u2014who's title was assumed by Sayid Abdulrahman, in the Bandarship of Bandar Nuggal, whose Panglima Besar was Ahmed.\n\nKlana Sindang was succeeded in the Klanaship by Laksamana Sayid Abdulrahman and Raja Hussein became Laksamana. Shortly after his appointment, Klana Sayid Abdulrahman visited Singapore, and on his return he held a meeting of the D\u00e2to' Bandar, and the Lembaga and the Waris of both branches, and thus addressed them: \"Our country is small, and our means of defence are little. It were better, I think, for us to make friends with the English and to take shelter under their flag; we would then live in security and fly our own flag in peace.\" The Dato' Bandar made answer: \"If this is what is going to happen it is against my wish. It is not according to our constitution to take shelter with the English. We are vassals of the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti, and the question must be referred to him.\" So nothing was settled, and the chiefs separated.\n\nAfter this, while the Klana was seeking for some way of carrying out his wishes in the matter, a letter came from the Governor in Singapore, to request that the Klana would not allow Raja Mahmud and his people, who were hostile to the Raja of Selangor and Tunku Kudin, to enter Sungei Ujong, and to say that the Governor would not be responsible if anything\nhappened in consequence of such a proceeding.\n\nThe D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana accordingly informed the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar of the Governor\u2019s wishes and the Dato\u2019 Bandar replied as follows: \u201cIt is indeed true that Raja Mahmud is an enemy of the Raja of Selangor and of Raja Kudin and has been driven from the country by them, but he having come to this country as a stranger, is it proper that we should turn him out who has done us no harm?\u201d\n\nThis letter filled the Klana with anger, and he summoned the Pantai Lembagas and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja of the Waris Ayer, and Panglima Besar Ahmad [the present D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar.\u2014R. B.] and thus addressed them, when they had presented themselves:\u2014\u201cI have sent for you because I have received a letter from the Governor asking me not to give shelter to Raja Mahmud, who is an enemy of the Raja of Selangor. I have requested the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar to cease doing so, and he has refused to obey my order. Now I ask for your advice what is to be done. If we continue to shelter Raja Mahmud, we will most certainly have to fight Raja Kudin\u2014and I think it will be better for us to have Raja Mahmud as an enemy than Raja Kudin. Raja Mahmud is being supported by the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar, and it seems to me that we had better make the Panglima Besar here Bandar. If a Bandar has to be supplanted, it should be by a Bandar, a Klana by a Klana.\u201d Then the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana appointed Panglima Besar Ahmad as D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar and told him that he might have to fight with the other Bandar. The Panglima Besar (Ahmad) replied that he gladly accepted the office that the authority of the Klana had conferred upon him according to right and custom, and asked that a written confirmation of his ancient rights, as between Klana and Bandar might be granted to him. This was agreed to and a written letter of agreement* was given to Panglima Besar Ahmad who was then formally appointed to be Bandar. Shortly after this, the Klana and Bandar Ahmad and all the Lembagas commenced operations against the Bandar, but for some ten or fifteen days nothing happened. Then the Bandar sent Raja Mahmud to attack the house of the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana, and Raja Mahmud nearly took it\u2014most of the Klana\u2019s people having run away\u2014but before he had taken it, an order came from the Bandar to Raja Mahmud not to destroy the Klana\u2019s house that\n\n* This letter has been seen by me.\u2014R. N. B.\nday; so Raja Mahmud returned home.\n\nRaja Mahmud having retired, the Klana sent a letter to the Governor asking for assistance from Singapore. This having been obtained, the war against the Bandar was renewed, and not long after, the Bandar fled to Singapore and Raja Mahmud with him, and both were detained there.\n\nAfter this came the war with Sri Menanti. The cause of this was that when Tengku Antar became Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti, the Dato' Klana refused to recognise his authority over Sungei Ujong and thus incurred the Yam Tuan's displeasure. He attacked Sungei Ujong, but in the end he was defeated and compelled to fly, and from that time there has been no Raja over Sungei Ujong.\n\nThe Dato' Klana Sayid Abdulrahman went to Mecca on a pilgrimage, and died there. He was succeeded by Dato' Leilah Setia Mohammad Usuf. He, after some time, was compelled to resign because he did not adhere to the ancient customs of the State, and was succeeded by the Klana Mamur, who is Klana at the present time.\n\nThe following are the chiefs who, under Malay rule, were entitled to share in the State revenues. The Klana and the Dato' Bandar had the right to collect dues (import and export) in their own markets. The Dato' Si Maraja collected at Liat. The Dato' Kanda (Laksamana) at Ampangan. Panglima Besar at Ranak, and the Waris Pantai at Sikamat. Each collected his own dues. The Linggi dues were divided into three parts, one went to the Dato' Klana, one to the Dato' Bandar, one to the Dato' Muda and his Waris. The share of the latter was obtained because it was the duty of Dato' Muda to collect all the Linggi taxes. The poll tax of $1 a year on all Chinese went to the Klana only, while the taxes on all boats went to the Dato' Bandar only; the tax was $3 on each boat. The Panglima Besar levied taxes on the road to Lukut, 15 cents a man. The Waris (di Darat and di Ayer) had a right to taxes on the produce of their respective lands.\n\nThis information relative to Sungei Ujong has been collected for me by Haji Bakar, whose title is Dato' Maraja, a Lembaga\nof the Waris di Ayer, by order of the Penghulu Haji Abdulrahman, Penghulu in the District of Labu.\n\nR. N. BLAND,\nOfficer in charge at Kwala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan.\n\nMarch, 1895.\nThe Dato' Muda of Linggi.\n\nA little has hitherto been stated about the Dato' Muda of Linggi. I add the following note*:\n\nThe lower part of the Linggi seems to have been left mostly to the \"Orang Rayat\" or Jakun, under their Batin, till towards the close of the last century. About the year 1783 a colony of Buggis from Rhio settled there under five headmen, during the war between the Raja Muda of Rhio (Raja Haji) and the Dutch. Their kampong was Permatang Pasir, about ten miles from the mouth of the River, some four or five miles above Sempang Linggi. One of the five headmen, Inche Ahman, was appointed by the Klana as Ketua'an Kampong, and afterwards received the title of Dato' Linggi. The Dato' of Rembau had nothing to do with this Settlement. The settlement of Langat people at Kuala Linggi did not take place till much later\u2014about 1833. A Rembau man named Che Mohamed Katas, married one of the Iato' of Linggi's daughters, and settled in Linggi, at Pengkalan Kundong above Pengkalan Pasir, with one Haji Mohamed. About 1824 Dato' Ahman died, and Che Mohamed Katas was appointed Dato' Muda Linggi by the Klana\u2014probably with the consent of the Penghulu of Rembau. There has been since no Dato' of Linggi other than the Iato' Muda. There are two branches of the Waris\u2014the Waris Ulu and the Waris Solok\u2014from which the Dato' Muda may be elected.\n\n---\n\nAdat Sungei Ujong.\n\nThe following is the order of ceremonies to be observed by the Waris di Darat and the Waris di Ayer of Sungei Ujong at the Hari Raya.\n\n* Taken chiefly from Newbold.\nAs regards the Waris di Darat:\u2014\n\nOn the 30th day of Ramathan, the Lembaga, and the D\u00e2to\u2019 and the Waris, and the Orang Dagang (Foreign Malays) living at Pantai, if they desire to slaughter a buffalo, shall bring the same to the Klana\u2019s house, and, having slaughtered it, shall present a portion (ramik-ramik daging bertundok) to the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana and some of the steak to the Chiefs and Lembagas present without requiring payment. This having been done, the buffalo meat may be sold.\n\nOn the 30th of Ramathan, at two or three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana shall fire the five guns allowed to him as insignia of his rank in order to warn all inhabitants of the country that the next day will be Hari Raya. When these signal guns have been fired by the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika shall fire three guns, and then all the other D\u00e2to\u2019 shall reply. At five o\u2019clock next morning five guns shall be fired, as a signal that the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana is going to bathe, accompanied by the Laksamana and the officers of his retinue (juhak) bearing the two benderong, the two swords, the two long krises, the two umbrellas, the two tunggul, the two pajar machin, and the two ular-ular. When the Klana has bathed, five more guns shall be fired, and then the Klana shall return and all his chiefs and officers shall pay their respects to him.\n\nOn the 1st of Shawal, at 7 or 8 in the morning the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana goes to offer up the \u201csunat\u201d prayers at the mosque. Five guns are fired and he is accompanied by the Laksamana and all his officers carrying the State insignia. When the prayers are over five more guns are fired and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana returns and proceeds to read Kotubah at the Telaga (well). This Telaga is at Inche Zeinab\u2019s house, and he is accompanied by the Lembaga, and all the chiefs and elders and his officers bearing the insignia of State. When he arrives at the house where the Telaga is, he is greeted with five guns, and invited to sit and read the Kotubah. When that has been done, five more guns are fired, and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana returns to his house, and the people who are with him separate.\n\nOn the 3rd of Shawal, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Mentri, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja di Muda, D\u00e2to\u2019 Johan, D\u00e2to\u2019 Leilah and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Dagang bring their people, men and women, (to pay their respects). The D\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika carries one benderong (spear with\ntuft) as his insignia, and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Johan one benderong, so also the D\u00e2to\u2019 Leilah. The other D\u00e2to\u2019s have no insignia. They march in procession with guns, and when they approach the Klana\u2019s house, the Klana\u2019s officers, bearing a spear (benderong) come out to meet them and salute the insignia borne by the D\u00e2to\u2019 visiting the Klana. Five guns are fired, and all are invited to come up into the Klana\u2019s house. The Laksamana enters to pay his respects, and is invited to take a seat near the Klana on the raised dais. The officers stand on the right and left of the Klana, holding the swords and long kries and spears unsheathed.\n\nThe D\u00e2to\u2019 Mendika first approaches the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana to do reverence in the ceremonial manner. He squats in the manner known as \u201cbersila\u201d and also on his knees (telimpoh) raising his hands joined together to the level of his nose and doing obeisance with them five times towards his front, and five times turning backwards. When the D\u00e2to Mendika has performed this ceremony, the other D\u00e2to\u2019s rise and go through it in turn, then the Waris and any of the men present who desire to pay their respects.\n\nWhen all the men have finished, the Laksamana invites the Klana to the inner room where he takes his seat on a raised pile of mats and cushions (kabesaran) and all the women present pay their respects to him in the same way as the men. When all is over the Klana comes down from his raised seat and five guns are fired as a sign that the Klana has held his levee. Food is provided for everyone, and when the eating is over, five more guns are fired and everyone prepares to leave. When this has been done, people are free to pay ceremonial visits to their relations for a space of seven days.\n\nBetween the 4th and 7th days, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Akir of Rantau, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Dagang of Parui, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Datar of Setul, and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Dagang (Lenggong) come to pay their respects to the Klana, bringing their people, men and women, with them. Sometimes they all come on the same day sometimes on different days, but they must always come between the 4th and 7th Shawal. The D\u00e2to\u2019 Akir of Rantau is the only D\u00e2to\u2019 who is allowed to bring his insignia consisting of one spear \u201cbenderong.\u201d This D\u00e2to\u2019 is received in the same way as the others (as above) with one spear \u201cbenderong,\u201d and a salute of five guns. The other D\u00e2to\u2019s carry guns only. They are received with five guns, and\ninvited to enter the Klana's house. They pay their respects in the same way, and are entertained and saluted with five guns in the same way.\n\nOnce in three years the Dato' Bandar goes to the Klana's house, and the proper ceremonial for him to observe is stated hereunder in dealing with the Waris di Ayer. From the 1st to 7th days of Shawal five guns must be fired at 6 o'clock in the morning as a signal for placing the State insignia in the open space (halaman) before the Klana's house, and at six in the evening five guns are fired as a signal for taking them up again.\nCeremonies of the Waris di Ayer.\n\nThese are much the same as in the case of the \"Waris di Darat,\" and may be briefly stated as follows:\n\n1.\u2014Waris slaughtering buffaloes on 30th Ramathan near the Dato' Klana's kampong must send certain portions to the Dato' Bandar, and to the Dato' Raja.\n\n2.\u2014On that day also people must assist to hang the langit-langit (canopy) cloths in the verandah of the Dato' Bandar's house and arrange the \"kabesaran\" (insignia and State mats and pillows.)\n\n3.\u2014As soon as the Dato' Klana has fired the first five signal guns on the 30th Ramathan, the Dato' Bandar may fire five guns, then the Dato' Raja three guns, and the other Lembagas entitled to, three guns.\n\n4.\u2014On 1st Shawal five guns are fired at 5 a.m. as a signal that the Dato' Bandar is going to bathe. He is accompanied by the Panglima Besar and his officers bearing the Bandar's insignia the two spears, \"benderong,\" two swords, two long krisses, two umbrellas, two \"tunggal,\" two \"pajar machin,\" two small flags. When the Dato' has bathed five more guns are fired.\n\n5.\u2014At six o'clock, the insignia are displayed in the \"halaman,\" or enclosure round the house. At 7 or 8 a.m., the Dato' Bandar with his officers goes to the mosque; five guns are fired when he sets out and five on his return. On this day the Bandar entertains his officers.\n\n6.\u2014On the 2nd Shawal, the Waris and elders and whoever wishes to do so, go to the house of Dato' Paduka Raja in procession. They are received with three guns, and the Dato' entertains the people with food.\n\n7.\u2014On the 3rd Shawal, the Dato' Paduka Raja goes in procession to the house of the Dato' Raja and is saluted with three guns. The Dato' Raja sits in State in the verandah of his house with his officers bearing the spears and swords on his right and left. The Dato' Paduka Raja pays his respects first, squatting on his knees, raising his hands towards his chin three times to his front and three times turning backwards. He is followed by all the men present. The Dato' Raja then goes inside the house and all the women present approach him in the same way, one after the other. The people are afterwards entertained, and three guns are fired as a signal for them to take leave.\n8.\u2014On the 4th Shawal, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja, with Paduka Raja and the Waris, and their people, men and women, pay their respects to the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar. They come in procession, each D\u00e2to\u2019 bringing one spear, kris paujang, sword, etc., etc. The insignia of the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar are sent out to meet them, a salute of five guns is fired, and the people are invited to come into the verandah of the house. The Panglima Besar brings the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar to sit in State, and the spear and sword bearers stand in order on the right and left. The D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja does reverence, raising his hands five times forwards and backwards to the level of his nose. He is followed by the D\u00e2to Si Ma\u2019raja and the Mentri Penghulu (Ampangan) and by the other chiefs and Waris in order. When all the men have presented themselves the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar goes within the house and receives the women in like manner. When this ceremony is over, five guns are fired, then food is served, and five more guns fired before the people depart.\n\n9.\u2014Once in three years the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar goes to the Klana\u2019s house accompanied by the D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja, and To\u2019 Paduka Raja, and To\u2019 Si Ma\u2019raja, and the Mentri Penghulu and his people generally. The insignia are brought in procession, two spears, swords, krises, &c. The Klana\u2019s insignia go out to meet them, and a salute of five guns is fired. The Laksamana brings the Klana to his seat under the canopy, together with the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar, the Klana sitting on the right, the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar on the left. The D\u00e2to\u2019 Raja pays his respects first (in the usual manner) to the D\u00e2to\u2019 Klana, and then to the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar; then D\u00e2to\u2019 Paduka Raja and the rest in order. After the men, the women perform the same ceremony inside the house. After a salute of five guns, food is served, the Klana and the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar being served from the same tray (bertudong handong). A final salute of five guns is fired and the people are free to depart.\n\n10.\u2014From 1st to 7th of Shawal, five guns are fired (by the D\u00e2to\u2019 Bandar) at five o\u2019clock, morning and evening, when his insignia are taken out and brought back into the house.\nTHE CROCODILES AND LIZARDS OF BORNEO\n\nIN THE SARAWAK MUSEUM,\n\nWITH\n\nDESCRIPTIONS OF SUPPOSED NEW SPECIES,\n\nAND\n\nTHE VARIATION OF COLOURS IN THE SEVERAL SPECIES DURING LIFE.\n\nBY EDWARD BARTLETT,\n\nCURATOR OF THE SARAWAK MUSEUM.\n\nAPRIL, 1894.\n\nLizards at all times are lively, harmless and interesting reptiles, their movements are graceful and smooth, in some genera, while others are rather uncouth, but all have that cunning quick attractive eye which calls one's attention to them at once.\n\nThere is no doubt that a large proportion of the lizards are more or less chameleon-like as regards the habit of changing colour, but at the same time there are many whose colours are permanent or attained during the breeding season; and these permanent colours are assumed by gradual development and age.\n\nIf ornithologists are justified in making three species of *Halcyon torquatus*, *H. fortesi*, and *H. molimbicus*, on such slender variations,* I consider that where we find a considerable number of different constant (permanent) colours in these lizards we are equally entitled to treat them as separate species.\n\n* To quote another instance of species differing in colour only\u2014and that to a trivial extent\u2014it becomes a question in my mind whether it is age or sex that causes the distinction between *Eurystomus orientalis* and *E. calonyx*, the two species being found together.\nThe number of species of lizards found in Borneo, is not very great considering the size of the island, viz.:\u2014\n\n1. Crocodile.\n1. Gavial.\n\n61 Lizards, two of which are doubtful Bornean species, viz., Tarentola Delalandii, and Mabuia Delalandii.\n\nTo facilitate quick reference, I have retained Mr. Boulenger's nomenclature of the species; each species will be found with a reference to the pages of the three volumes:\n\nCatalogue of Chelonians, 1889.\nCatalogue of Lizards, 1885-7.\n\nThose marked S.

M.\n\nThe crocodile is plentiful along the sea coast, and in all the rivers of Borneo. It attains a great length in this country, and also becomes very robust. One specimen in this Museum from the Baram river, obtained by Mr. C. Hose measures over 17 feet.\n\nSarawak river (*E. Bartlett*); Baram River (*C. Hose*).\n\nAnother species is reported to exist in some parts of the country, which I presume must be *Crocodilus palustris*, by the description of it, viz.:\u2014 \"that the head is much longer and narrower,\" but up to the present moment I have not discovered any difference in the series we have in the Museum.\n\nMany instances of its ferocious habits are reported from time to time; it generally catches bathers who are unaware of its presence. One curious rescue of three little children occurred some time ago; it appears that they were bathing together when a crocodile seized one of them; one got hold of its legs while the other, a little girl, got on top of its head and gouged its eyes until the brute released the other; they were all saved.\n\n2.\u2014*Tomistoma Schlegelii*, Boulen., Cat.

Mabuia Rugifera.\n\n*Male.*\u2014Tail, carinated to tip. Nearly black above; immaculate above and below.

Throat, chrome yellow.\n\n*Female adult.*\u2014Highly polished above; sides of body closely covered with white black sided rectangular spots from corner of mouth to base of tail. Throat, greyish white.\n\n4. Mabuia rudis.\n\n*Male.*\u2014Not polished above (dull); tail, tri-bi-and unicarnated from base to tip; no white spots on the sides; a few yellow edged scales on the sides of the base of tail. Throat, blue.\n\n*Female.*\u2014Dull above; a yellowish white line from corner of mouth, which passes the shoulder and ends in yellowish white tipped scales in front of the hind leg. Throat, greenish-brown.\n\n5. Mabuia Lewisi. n. sp.\n\n*Male adult.*\u2014Not polished above (dull); Tail, tri-bi-and unicarnated to the tip; no spots of white on the sides, a few\nwhite-tipped scales on the sides of the base of tail.

B. Sharpe in the British Museum Catalogue.\n\nThis lizard is certainly not so abundant as *M. rugifera*, although it inhabits the same sandy lanes and jungle paths about Kuching, and the district.\n\nI have examined the sexes of a large series.\n\nKuching, Sarawak (*E.

I have carefully examined hundreds of them and find a great variety of colours in the males, some with metallic green and red bands on the sides of the neck, while others are brilliant, brick-red on the sides of the neck, and above the shoulders; at the same time they are easily distinguished from all the other males by the smooth terminal half or two-thirds of the tail.\n\nSarawak, (H.

It is without the four or five longitudinal rows of small black specks on the back, which is always present in *M. rudis*; and easily distinguished when alive by its bright-red throat and other colours.\n\nThis fine species I procured on Santubong at about 200ft., others near Kuching.

I have examined all our specimens carefully and cannot find a trace of the latter colours on the tail-feathers; and certainly no greyish blue on the primaries.\n\nI have much pleasure in naming this new species after the Hon'ble F. R. O. Maxwell, Resident of Sarawak.\nOCCASIONAL NOTES.\n\nTHE INDONESIAN NUMERALS.\n\nIn a pamphlet* recently presented to the Straits Asiatic Society, Dr. T. H. PARDO DE TAVERA, of Manila, discusses the origin of the names of the numerals in the Tagal and (incidentally) in the other Indonesian languages.\n\nThe following short table will illustrate the wide area over which these or kindred numerals are used:\n\n| Malay | Maori | Tagal | Malagasy | Formosa | Fiji |\n|-------|-------|-------|----------|---------|-----|\n| 1 Sa  | Tahit | Isa   | Iray     | Sha     | E-dua |\n| 2 Dua | Rua   | Dalaua| Roa      | Lua     | E-rua |\n| 3 Tiga| Toru  | Tatlo | Telo     | Telu    | E-tolu |\n| 4 Ampat| Wha | Apat | E-fatra | Pat     | E-va |\n| 5 Lima| Rima  | Lima | Dimi     | Rimi    | E-lima |\n| 6 Anam| Ono   | Anim | Enina    | Num     | E-ono |\n| 7 Tujuh| Whitu| Pito | Tito     | Pitu    | E-vitu |\n| 8 Delapan| Waru | Walo | Valo    | Waro    | E-vala |\n| 9 Sembilan| Iwa | Siyam | Sivi    | Iwa     | E-siwa |\n| 10 Sapuloh| Ngahuru | Sangpulo | Tolo | Pulu | E-tini |\n\nThe origin of these numerals is also discussed by the Rev. D. MACDONALD, of Efate, New Hebrides, in the Journal of the Polynesian Society for June, 1893.\n\nDr. PARDO DE TAVERA points out that the Indonesian numerals were originally substantives, such as \"a couple,\" \"a trio,\" \"a dozen,\" rather than numerals in the ordinary sense of the word. In the languages of Timor Laut and Fiji the article is still used before these numerals. In the Pampango language (Philippines) it survives in *a-dua*, *a-tlo*, *a-pat*, *a-nim*, *a-pulu*. In Malay it is still used in *sa-puloh* and\n\n---\n\n* \"Consideraciones sobre el origen del nombre de los numeros en Tagalog\" \u2014Manila.\nprobably survives in *ampat* and *a-nam*. In some languages a second article has even been added when the first has become incorporated in the numerals.\n\nDr. DE TAVERA also draws attention to the quinary system upon which the original numbers were based doubtless owing to the convenience of using the hand in enumeration. The word *lima* or *rima* still means \"hand\" in many of the dialects of Formosa, the Malay Archipelago and Polynesia. The inhabitants of Triton Bay in New Guinea, of Santo, Efate and Ambrym in the New Hebrides, of the Island of Engano near Sumatra, and some of the wild tribes of Formosa still use quinary systems. The Malay *delapan* (8), derived by RIGG from *dua-lepan* (two turned down), takes us back also to a time when the fingers were used in counting. *Sa-lepan*, *Sem-bilan* (*sa-ambilan*), and the AChinese *Sa-kurang* (9) are all extensions of the same idea.\n\nThe etymologies suggested by Dr. DE TAVERA for the Philippine (and Oceanic) numerals are as follows:\n\n*Lua*, *dua*, or *rua* (2) from a root signifying a double or copy, as in the Philippine *ka-lu-lua*, a ghost.\n\n*Telo*, *tolu*, *toru* (3) from a root signifying triple connected with *toli* a rope (triple strand).\n\n*Pat*, *fa*, *ha* (4) from a Polynesian root signifying \"a complete set,\" \"a company.\" The Javanese *sa-kawan*, Hawaii *sa-kauna*, has these meanings.\n\nThese were the oldest numerals. For higher quantities the hand was used in enumeration.\n\n*Lima*, *rima* (5) the hand.\n\n*A-nam*, *ono*, *ne* (6). The root appears to be *ne*, but the meaning cannot be traced.\n\n*Pitu*, *hitu*, *titu* (7) from an old Polynesian root *fia*, \"three,\" and the root *tu* \"to shorten\" (*tua*, to shorten, Tahiti).\n\n*Walo*, *varo* (8) from the Polynesian *wa* \"a space,\" and *rua* or *lua* \"two\"; two spaces, i.e., *dua-lepan*.\n\n*Siam*, *siwa*, *iwa* (a), the \"s\" and \"m\" being accretions, from *wa* \"a space,\" and the article \"i.\"\n\n*Pulo*, *fulu*, *hulu* (10) from a root meaning totality (*pulus*, all, Tagal.)\nThe Abb\u00e9 Favre in his Dictionary is guilty of two errors in assuming sa \"one,\" to be a contracted form of suatu, and dua, \"two,\" to be derived from the Sanscrit dwi. Suatu, he subsequently admitted to be a corruption of sa-batu, as the Javanese sa-wiji or siji is a corruption of sa-biji.\n\nThe Rev. D. Macdonald of Efate, New Hebrides, going further than Dr. Pardo de Tavera, suggests a Semitic origin for the Oceanic numerals. The theory is a very daring one, for the Oceanic languages with their simple constructions and soft syllables are utterly unlike the Semitic languages with their harsh consonants, elaborate grammar,* and complicated vowel inflexions, and no ethnologists would be likely to support a theory that the Dyaks, for instance, are the lost ten tribes of Israel. The points also to which Dr. de Tavera has drawn attention combat this theory, for the Arabic numerals are not collective nouns, nor do they show any connection with quinary system.\n\nThe resemblances traced by Mr. Macdonald between Oceanic and Semitic forms are not so clear as to necessitate his opponents explaining them away by any theory of coincidences.\n\nThe following table shows the \"original forms\" suggested by him, together with the nearest existing forms in the Semitic and Oceanic languages respectively:\n\n| Original form | Nearest Semitic form | Nearest Oceanic form |\n|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| 1             | 'd'                  | Ihda (Arab)          | Aida (Timor) |\n| 2             | r'                   | Tarawah (Socotra)    | Roa (Maori)  |\n| 3             | t'l'                 | T'laa (Syriac)       | Telo (Malagasy) |\n| 4             | 'b't                 | Arbaat (Arab)        | Bate (Efate) |\n| 5             | k'm'                 | Khams (Arab)         | Ikma (Aneit) |\n| 6             | t'                   | Sitt (Arab)          | Butanga (Gilolo) |\n| 7             | b't'                 | Sabat (Arab)         | Mbut (Malicolo) |\n| 8             | l'p'n                | T'man (Arab)         | Delapan (Malay) |\n| 9             | s'm                  | Esro (Syriac)        | Siyam (Tagal) |\n| 10            | s'n'                 | Eseru (Amharic)      | Sarone (Timbora) |\n\nThese resemblances hardly carry conviction. In fact the\n\n* \"There are thirty-three ordinary methods of forming the plural.\"\u2014Socin's Arabic Grammar.\nattempt to connect *anam* with *sitt* by means of the word *butanga* is apt to recall the sarcasm of Voltaire \"pour Messieurs les etymologistes les voyelles n'y sont pour rien et les consonnes pour tr\u00e8s peu de chose.\" The selection of the Malay \"l'p'n\" as an original root is singularly unfortunate in view of the well-known derivation of *delapan* from *dua lepan*. A reference to a table of Indonesian numerals will show that the forms selected are, in several cases, the exception rather than the rule. As for the Semitic numerals Mr. Macdonald has been in one or two cases misled by the transliteration. The \"t'\" in *t'laa* is not \"t\" (\u062a) but \"th\" (\u062b) and generally corrupts to \"s\" in other languages as *hari thalatha*, for instance, becomes *hari selasa*; Othman corrupts to Osman. The \"k\" also in *Khamis* is not the Indonesian \"k\" in *Ikma*. The Malay language contains some of the Semitic numerals in the names of the days of the week, but they do not corrupt to the forms suggested by Mr. Macdonald.\n\nIt would be unsafe to base any arguments as to the origin or movements of the Indonesian races upon the resemblances between the numerals alone. The numerals, however, illustrate very fairly the theory of Polynesian migrations expounded by M. de Quatrefages,* in that they are used by the Melanesian tribes who lie along the routes which the migrating tribes from Ceram and Bourou are believed to have followed on their way to the South Seas. Mr. A. R. Wallace, while unwilling to admit the common origin of the Indonesian and Polynesian races, fully recognised the remarkable similarity in language, a similarity, as he points out, of \"words\" not mere roots, and which he explains by suggesting that Malay traders must have visited the South Sea Islands. Of this, however, there is no historical evidence, and the primitive condition of the Polynesians when first visited by Europeans militates against the theory that they had commercial dealings with the comparatively civilised Malays. The resemblance in language cannot be a mere coincidence. Attempts have been made to minimize its extent and importance by writers who argue in favour of the Oceanic races being the relics of the autochthonous\n\n* \"Les Polynesiens et leurs migrations\"\u2014by M. A. de Quatrefages.\ninhabitants of an old Pacific continent; but the connection between the Indonesian and Polynesian languages is now becoming more generally recognised. The numerals furnish perhaps the best illustration of this relationship.*\n\nR. J. W.\n\n*The Indonesian numerals can be found in the following works, most of which are in the Society's Library:\n\nSumatra, Java, and Adjacent Islands.\u2014Favre's Javanese Grammar gives the numerals in Javanese, Kawi, Sundanese, Batak, Lampong, Madurese, and Balinese. The Nias Island numerals may be found in J. S. B. R. A.

In addition to these regular journals, the Council of the Society under Rule 24 have sanctioned the separate publication of four works\u2014a Monograph on Wai-seng Lotteries by Mr. G. T. Hare; a Malay Tale, edited by Mr. Hugh Clifford; a translation of the same tale by Mr. Clifford; and a Life of Sir Stamford Raffles by the Rev. G. M. Reith. The three first have been already published; the fourth will, it is hoped, appear in the course of the next two months.\nA proposal was made during the year by the Government of Perak that the Native States Governments should undertake the work of preparing the map of the Malay Peninsula. To this the Council agreed, offering to place all the material now in possession of the Society at the disposal of the Survey Offices of the Native States. The scheme was, however, recently abandoned by the Government owing to its cost.\n\nThe Council are unanimously of opinion that the following be substituted for Rule 6:\n\n\"No member shall receive a copy of the Journal or other publication of the Society until his subscription for the current year has been paid.\"\n\nThe Council also unanimously recommend that members be allowed to compound for life membership of the Society on payment of $50.\n## STRAITS BRANCH OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\n\n### Honorary Treasurer's Cash Account from 1st January to 31st December 1895.\n\n| Description                                                                 | $   | c. |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|----|\n| To Balance on 1st January, 1895:                                          |     |    |\n| in Chartered Bank                                                          | 673 | 31 |\n| in Mercantile Bank                                                         | 296 | 28 |\n| with Honorary Treasurer                                                    | 8   | 65 |\n| Subscriptions for 1893,                                                     | 20  | 00 |\n| \"                                              1894,                                        | 80  | 00 |\n| \"                                              1895,                                        | 310 | 00 |\n| \"                                              1896,                                        | 5   | 00 |\n| Proceeds of Sales of Journals,                                              | 39  | 00 |\n| Indo-China Essays,                                                          | 21  | 60 |\n| Maps,                                                                       | 21  | 00 |\n| Koehler's Antiquarium in settlement of outstanding account (\u00a31.15),        | 16  | 27 |\n| Interest on Cash Balances,                                                  | 6   | 16 |\n| By Salary of Clerk from October, 1894, to November, 1895,                   |     |    |\n| Commission to Collector                                                    |     |    |\n| Advertising General Meeting                                                 |     |    |\n| Postage on letters and Journals and Clerk's sundry expenses                |     |    |\n| Binding publications                                                        |     |    |\n| Draft to Mr. Davies Sherborn for Bibliography of Malaya, \u00a330.10            |     |    |\n| American Mission Press for printing Journal No. 28                         |     |    |\n| \"Koh Yew Hoon\" Press for paper                                            |     |    |\n| Remuneration to Compositors, Government Printing Office, for setting in type paper on \"Wai Seng\" Lottery |     |    |\n| Cheque Book                                                                 |     |    |\n| Balance in Chartered Bank                                                  |     |    |\n| Balance in Mercantile Bank                                                 |     |    |\n\nTotal: 1,492 27\n\nJ.

I do not propose here to give a complete survey of the subject, but merely to offer a few notes illustrating the general character of Malay ideas and customs under this head so far as they have come within my own personal observation.\n\nA good deal has been written on these matters, and amongst other papers I would refer particularly to that by Mr. W. E. Maxwell, which appeared in the seventh number of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, in 1881. The chief point made in that paper is the thoroughly non-Muhammadan character of many of the common Malay beliefs and practices. That characteristic is also perhaps the only one that I can claim to illustrate.\n\nMalays in the country districts are in fact only superficially Muhammadan. It is true they often carry out all the ritual precepts of that religion: many of them pray the required number of times daily, most attend the Mosque with decent regularity on Fridays, and a fair proportion (but by no means all) keep the fast of Ramadhan. But to their Muhammadan observances they superadd a good many practices which, from the Muhammadan point of view, are at least unorthodox, in fact almost pagan, and which can often be traced to a heathen origin.\n\nFor instance, although officially the religious centre of the village community is the Mosque, there is usually in every\nsmall district a holy place known as a kramat, at which vows are paid on special occasions, and which is invested with a very high degree of reverence and sanctity.\n\nThese kramats abound in Malacca territory; there is hardly a village but can boast some two or three in its immediate neighbourhood, and they are perfectly well known to all the inhabitants.\n\nTheoretically, kramats are supposed to be the graves of deceased holy men, the early apostles of the Muhammadan faith, the first founders of the village who cleared the primeval jungle, or other persons of local notoriety in a former age; and there is no doubt that many of them are that and nothing more. But even so the reverence paid to them and the ceremonies that are performed at them savour a good deal too much of ancestor-worship to be attributable to an orthodox Muhammadan origin.\n\nIt is certain, however, that many of these kramats are not graves at all: many of them are in the jungle, on hills and in groves, like the high places of the Old Testament idolatries; they contain no trace of a grave (while those that are found in villages usually have grave-stones) and they appear to be really ancient sites of a primitive nature-worship or the adoration of the spirits of natural objects.\n\nMalays, when asked to account for them, often have recourse to the explanation that they are kramat jin, that is, \"spirit\"-places; and if a Malay is pressed on the point and thinks that the orthodoxy of these practices is being impugned, he will sometimes add that the jin in question is a jin islam, a Muhammadan and quite orthodox spirit!\n\nThus on Bukit Nyalas, near the Johol frontier, there is a kramat consisting of a group of granite boulders on a ledge of rock overhanging a sheer descent of a good many feet; bamboo clumps grow on the place, and there were traces of religious rites having been performed there, but no grave whatever. This place was explained to me to be the kramat of one Nakhoda Hussin described as a jin (of the orthodox variety) who presides over the water, rain and streams. People occasionally burned incense there to avert drought\nand get enough water for irrigating their fields. There was another kramat of his lower down the hill, also consisting of rocks, one of which was shaped something like a boat. I was informed that this jin is attended by tigers which guard the hill and are very jealous of the intrusion of other tigers from the surrounding country. He is believed to have revealed himself to the original Pawang of the village, the mythical founder of the kampong of Nyalas. In a case like this it seems probable that the name attached to this object of reverence is a later accretion and that under a thin disguise we have here a relic of the worship of the spirit of rivers and streams, a sort of elemental deity, localized in this particular place and still regarded as a proper object of worship and propitiation, in spite of the theoretically strict monotheism of the Muhammadan creed. Again, at another place, the kramat is nothing but a tree, of somewhat singular shape, having a large swelling some way up the trunk. It was explained to me that this tree was connected in a special way with the prospects of local agriculture, the size of the swelling increasing in good years and diminishing in bad seasons! Hence it was naturally regarded with considerable awe by the purely agricultural population of the neighbourhood.\n\nAs may be imagined, it is exceedingly difficult to discover any authentic facts regarding the history of these numerous kramats: even where there is some evidence of the existence of a grave, the name of the departed saint is usually the one fact that is remembered, and often even that is forgotten. The most celebrated of the Malacca kramats, the one at Machap, is a representative type of the first class, that in which there really is a grave: it is the one place where a hardened liar respects the sanctity of an oath, and it is occasionally visited in connection with civil cases, when the one party challenges the other to take a particular oath: a man who thinks nothing of perjuring himself in the witness box and who might not much mind telling a lie even with the Koran on his head, will flinch before the ordeal of a falsehood in the presence of the \"Dato' Machap.\" The worship there, as with most other kramats, consists of the burning of incense, the\noffering of *nasi kunyet* (yellow rice) and the killing of goats; but I also noticed a number of live pigeons there which illustrate the practice, common in Buddhist countries, of releasing an animal in order to gain \"merit\" thereby.\n\nTo return to the elemental spirits: it was explained to me by a Malay, with whom I discussed the subject at leisure, that apart from the spirits which are an object of reverence and which when treated with proper deference are usually beneficent, there are a variety of others. To begin with, spirits (the word used on this occasion was *hantu*) are of at least two kinds\u2014wild ones, whose normal habitat is the jungle, and those that are, so to say, domesticated. The latter, which seem to correspond to what in Western magic are called \"familiars,\" vary in character with their owners or the persons to whom they are attached. Thus in this particular village of Bukit Senggeh, a few years ago, there was a good deal of alarm on account of the arrival of two or three strangers believed to be of bad character, who were supposed to keep a familiar spirit of a particularly malignant disposition which was in the habit of attacking people in their sleep by throttling them. One or two cases of this kind occurred, and it was seriously suggested that I should make the matter the subject of a magisterial enquiry, which, however, I did not find it necessary to do. But familiar spirits are by no means necessarily evil: indeed the *Pawang* (a functionary of whom more will be said later on) keeps a familiar spirit, which in his case is a *hantu p\u00fcs\u00e1ka*, that is, an hereditary spirit which runs in the family, in virtue of which he is able to deal summarily with the wild spirits of an obnoxious character. The chief point of importance is to keep these wild spirits in their proper place, viz. the jungle, and to prevent them taking up their abode in the villages. For this reason charms are hung up at the borders of the villages, and whenever a wild spirit breaks bounds and encroaches on human habitations it is necessary to get him turned out. Some time ago, one of these objectionable *hantus* had settled down in a *k\u0115rayong* tree in the middle of this same village of Bukit Senggeh, and used to frighten people who passed that way in the dusk: so\nthe Pawang was duly called upon to exorcize it, and under his superintendence the tree was cut down, after which there was no more trouble. But it is certain that it would have been excessively dangerous for an ordinary layman to do so.\n\nThis point may be illustrated by a case which was reported to me soon after it occurred and which again shows the intimate connection of spirits with trees. A Javanese coolie, on the main road near Ayer Panas, cut down a tree which was known to be occupied by a hantu. He was thereupon seized with what from the description appears to have been an epileptic fit and showed all the traditional symptoms of demoniac possession. He did not recover till his friends had carried out the directions of the spirit (speaking through the sufferer's mouth, it seems), viz., to burn incense, offer rice and release a fowl. After which the hantu left him.\n\nIn many places there are trees which are pretty generally believed to be the abodes of spirits, and not one Malay in ten would venture to cut one down, while most people would hardly dare to go near one after dark. On one occasion an exceptionally intelligent Malay, with whom I was discussing the terms on which he proposed to take up a contract for clearing the banks of a river, made it an absolute condition that he should not be compelled to cut down a particular tree which overhung the stream, on the ground that it was a \"spirit\" tree. That tree had to be excluded from the contract.\n\nThe accredited intermediary between men and spirits is the person who has already been referred to several times as the Pawang: the Pawang is a functionary of great and traditional importance in a Malay village, though in places near towns the office is falling into abeyance. In the inland districts, however, the Pawang is still a power, and is regarded as part of the constituted order of society, without whom no village community would be complete. It must be clearly understood that he has nothing whatever to do with the official Muhammadan religion of the Mosque: the village has its regular staff of elders\u2014the Imam, Khatib and Bilal\u2014for the Mosque service. But the Pawang is quite outside this system, and belongs to a different and much older order of ideas; he may\nbe regarded as the legitimate representative of the primitive \"medicine-man\" or \"village sorcerer\" and his very existence in these days is an anomaly, though it does not strike Malays as such.\n\nVery often the office is hereditary, or at least the appointment is practically confined to the members of one family. Sometimes it is endowed with certain \"properties\" handed down from one Pawang to his successor, known as the kabes\u00e1ran, or, as it were, regalia. On one occasion I was nearly called upon to decide whether these adjuncts\u2014which consisted, in this particular case, of a peculiar kind of head-dress\u2014were the personal property of the person then in possession of them (who had got them from his father, a deceased Pawang) or were to be regarded as official insignia descending with the office in the event of the natural heir declining to serve! Fortunately I was spared the difficult task of deciding this delicate point of law, as I managed to persuade the owner to take up the appointment.\n\nBut quite apart from such external marks of dignity, the Pawang is a person of very real significance. In all agricultural operations, such as sowing, reaping, irrigation works, and the clearing of jungle for planting, in fishing at sea, in prospecting for minerals, and in cases of sickness, his assistance is invoked. He is entitled by custom to certain small fees: thus, after a good harvest, he is allowed, in some villages, five gantangs of padi, one gantang of rice (b\u0113ras) and two chupaks of \u0113mping (a preparation of rice and coco-nut made into a sort of sweetmeat) from each householder. After recovery from sickness, his remuneration is the very modest amount of tiga wang baharu, that is, 7\u00bd cents.\n\nIt is generally believed that a good harvest can only be secured by complying with his instructions, which are of a peculiar and comprehensive character.\n\nThey consist largely of prohibitions, which are known as pantang. Thus, for instance, it is pantang in some places to work in the rice-field on the 14th and 15th days of the lunar month; and this rule of enforced idleness being very congenial to the Malay character is, I believe, pretty strictly observed.\nAgain, in reaping, certain instruments are proscribed, and in the inland villages it is regarded as a great crime to use the sickle (sabit) for cutting the padi: at the very least the first few ears should be cut with a tuai, a peculiar small instrument consisting of a semi-circular blade set transversely on a piece of wood or bamboo, which is held between the fingers and which cuts only an ear or two at a time. Also the padi must not be threshed by hitting it against the inside of a box, a practice known as banting padi.\n\nIn this, as in one or two other cases, it may be supposed that the Pawang's ordinances preserve the older forms of procedure and are opposed to innovations in agricultural methods. The same is true of the pantang rule which prescribes a fixed rate of price at which padi may be sold in the village community to members of the same village. This system of customary prices is probably a very old relic of a time when the idea of asking a neighbour or a member of your own tribe to pay a competition price for an article was regarded as an infringement of communal rights. It applies to a few other articles of local produce* besides padi, and I was frequently assured that the neglect of this wholesome rule was the cause of bad harvests. I was accordingly sometimes pressed to fine transgressors, which would perhaps have been a somewhat difficult thing to do. The fact, however, that in many places these rules are generally observed is a tribute to the influence of the Pawang who lends his sanction to them.\n\nIn agricultural operations the animistic ideas of the Malays are clearly apparent: thus, before the rice is cut, a sort of ritual is performed which is known as puji padi, and which is regarded apparently as a kind of propitiatory service, a sort of apology to the padi for reaping it. The padi is usually\n\n---\n\n* In Bukit Senggeh the articles subject to this custom are priced as follows:\n\n| Article          | Price       |\n|------------------|------------|\n| Padi             | 3 cents a gantang |\n| Beras            | 10 cents a gantang |\n| Kabong sugar     | 2\u00bd cents a \"buku\" of two pieces and weighing a kati |\n| Coco-uuts        | 1 cent each |\n| Hen's eggs       | 0\u00bc cent each |\n| Duck's eggs      | 0\u00bd cent each |\nsprinkled with t\u00e9pong t\u00e1war (flour mixed with water) before the reaping is commenced, and the first lot cut is set apart for a ceremonial feast.\n\nAt planting there are also ceremonies: as a rule the beginning of the planting season is ushered in by a visit of the whole body of villagers to the most highly revered kramat in the neighbourhood, where the usual offerings are made and prayers are said. Sometimes, however, there is a special service known as b\u0103pu\u00e2,* consisting of a sort of mock combat, in which the evil spirits are believed to be expelled from the rice-fields by the villagers: this is not done every year but once in three or four years.\n\nAnother occasional service of a peculiar character which is not of very frequent occurrence is the ceremony which would perhaps be best described as the propitiation of the earth-spirit. Some years ago, I happened by chance to be present at a function of this kind, and as its details may be of some interest as illustrating the wide dispersion of certain points of ritual, I will end these notes by giving a full description of it, as noted down at the time. It was in the month of October, and I happened to be out shooting snipe in the padi-fields of the village of S\u00ebb\u00e2tu on a Sunday morning, when I was met by the Penghulu, the headman of the village, who asked me to leave off shooting for an hour or so. As I was having fair sport, I naturally wanted to know the reason why, so he explained that the noise of gunshots would irritate the hantu and render unavailing the propitiatory service which was then about to begin. Further enquiry elicited the statement that the hantu in question was the one who presided over rice-lands and agricultural operations, and as I was told that there would be no objection to my attending the ceremony, I went there and then to the spot to watch the proceedings. The place was a square patch of grass-lawn a few yards wide, which had evidently for years been left untouched by the plough, though surrounded by many acres of rice-fields. On this patch a\n\n* Menangkabau and Naning pronunciation for b\u00ebrpuar. Puar is the name of a jungle plant, said to be akin to cardamum, the stem of which is used as a sort of javelin in this mock combat.\nsmall wooden altar had been built: it consisted simply of a small square platform of wood or bamboo raised about three or four feet above the ground, each corner being supported by a small sapling with the leaves and branches left on it and overshadowing the platform, the sides of which appeared to face accurately towards the four cardinal points. To the western side was attached a small bamboo ladder leading from the ground to the edge of the platform. At the four corners of the patch of grass were four larger saplings planted in the ground. On the branches of all these trees were hung a number of ketupats, which are small squarish bags plaited of strips of the leaves of the screw-pine (mengkuang) or some similar plant, like the material of which native bags and mats are made. A larger ketupat hung over the centre of the altar, and all of them were filled with a preparation of boiled rice.\n\nOn the altar were piled up various cooked foods laid on plantain leaves, including the flesh of a goat, cooked in the ordinary way, as well as rice and different kinds of condiments and sweetmeats. The Pawang was present as well as a number of the villagers, and soon after my arrival with the Penghulu the ceremony began by some of the villagers producing out of a bag the skin of a black male goat with the head and horns attached and containing the entrails (the flesh having been cooked and laid on the altar previously). A large iron nail four or five inches long and thick in proportion was placed vertically in a hole about two feet deep which had been dug under the altar, and the remains of the goat were also buried in it with the head turned towards the east, the hole being then closed and the turf replaced. Some of the goat\u2019s blood, in two coco-nut shells (tempurong), was placed on the ground near the south side and south-west corner of the altar close to the ladder.\n\nThe Pawang, after assisting at these preliminaries, then took his stand at the west side of the altar, looking eastwards: he covered his head, but not his face, with his sarong wrapped round it like a shawl, and proceeded to light a torch, the end of which was tipped with incense (kemenyan). With\nthis he touched the bottom of the altar platform four times. He then took a cup of t\u00e9pong t\u00e1war and dipped in it a small bundle of four kinds of leaves, with which he then sprinkled the north-west and south-east corners of the platform. He then coughed three times\u2014whether this was part of the ritual, or a purely incidental occurrence, I am unable to say, as it was not practicable to stop the ceremony for the purpose of asking questions\u2014and again applied the torch under the altar and sprinkled with t\u00e9pong t\u00e1war all the corners of it, as well as the rungs of the ladder.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings four men stationed in the rice-field beyond the four corners of the patch of turf, each threw a k\u00e9tupat diagonally across to one another, while the rest of the assembly, headed by the Penghulu, chanted the kalimah, or Muhammadan creed, three times.\n\nThen a man holding a large bowl started from a point in the rice-field just outside the north side of the patch of turf, and went round it (first in a westerly direction). As he walked, he put handfuls of the rice into his mouth and spat or vomited them out, with much noise as if to imitate violent nausea, into the field. He was followed closely by another who also held a bowl filled with pieces of raw tapioca root and b\u00e9ras bertih (rice roasted in a peculiar way) which he threw about into the field. Both of them went right round the grass-plot. The Pawang then took his cup of t\u00e9pong t\u00e1war and sprinkled the anak padi, that is, the rice-shoots which were lying in bundles along the south and east sides of the altar, ready for planting. Having sprinkled them he cut off the ends, as is usually done; and after spitting to the right and to the left, he proceeded to plant them in the field. A number of others then followed his lead and planted the rest of the rice-plants, and then a sweetmeat made of coco-nut and sugar was handed round and Muhammadan prayers were said by some duly qualified person, an orang \u2018alim or a lebei, and the ceremony was concluded.\n\nIt was explained to me that the blood and the food were intended for the hantu and the ladder up to the altar was for his convenience: in fact, the whole affair was a propitiatory\nservice, and offers curious analogies with the sacrificial cere-\nmonials of some of the wild aboriginal tribes of Central India,\nwho have not been converted to Hinduism or Islam. That\nit should exist in a Malay community within twenty miles of\nthe town of Malacca, where Muhammadanism has been\nestablished for about six centuries, is certainly strange. Its\nobvious inconsistency with his professed religion does not\nstrike the average Malay peasant at all. It is, however, the\nfact that these observances are not regarded with much\nfavour by the more strictly Muhammadan Malays of the\ntowns and especially by those that are partially of Arab des-\ncent. These latter have not very much influence in country\ndistricts, but privately I have heard some of them express\ndisapproval of such rites and even of the ceremonies perform-\ned at kramats. According to them, the latter might be\nconsistent with Muhammadan orthodoxy on the understand-\ning that prayers were addressed solely to the Deity: but the\ninvocation of spirits or deceased saints and their propitiation\nby offerings could not be regarded as otherwise than poly-\ntheistic idolatry. Of course such a delicate distinction\u2014almost\nas subtle as that between dulia and latria in the Christian\nworship of saints,\u2014is entirely beyond the average Malay\nmind; and everything is sanctioned by immemorial custom,\nwhich in an agricultural population is more deeply rooted\nthan any book-learning; so these rites are likely to continue\nfor some time and will only yield gradually to the spread of\neducation. Such as they are, they seem to be interesting\nrelics of an old-world superstition.\n\nI have mentioned only a few such points and only such as\nhave been brought directly to my knowledge: there are hosts\nof other quaint notions, such as the theory of lucky and\nunlucky days and hours, on which whole treatises have been\nwritten, and which regulate every movement of those who\nbelieve in them; the belief in amulets and charms for averting\nall manner of evils, supernatural and natural; the practice\nduring epidemics of sending out to sea small elaborately con-\nstructed vessels which are supposed to carry off the malig-\nnant spirits responsible for the disease (of which I remember\na case a few years ago in the village of Sempang, where the beneficial effect was most marked); the widespread belief in the power of *menuju*, that is, doing injury at a distance by magic, in which the Malays believe the wild junglemen especially to be adepts; the belief in the efficacy of forms of words as love-charms and as a protection against spirits and wild beasts\u2014in fact, an innumerable variety of superstitious ideas exist among Malays, and, of course, it is quite impossible even to refer to them all here. I must also leave to others the task of citing parallels from the folk-lore of other races and can only conclude this paper by expressing the hope that some of the facts I have mentioned, though in themselves trivial, may derive additional interest from such comparisons.\n\nC.

In inserting, therefore, every publication that has come under his notice, the compiler hopes that the entries will prove of considerable assistance; but as a large proportion of the literature of this district, either never reaches England at all, or else arrives so long after as to be too late for examination for this purpose, he begs the reader's indulgence for any error that may be present. His thanks are due to M. Martinus Nijhoff of The Hague for information as to some of the more recent books.\n\nA.\u2014De exploitatie van gronding en bevolking in de Kodjawendsa's der Vorstenlanden.

A. O'Brien, and the Hon'ble Martin Lister.\n\nBoth gentlemen from time to time wrote papers for the Journal and contributed in no small degree to the information that has of recent years been obtained about the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBefore the Society was founded in the year 1875 Mr. O'Brien accompanied the late Mr. Daly on an expedition across the Malay Peninsula, via the Muar and Pahang rivers. The results of their joint expedition were recorded in the first Map of the Peninsula which was published by the Society in 1879. At that time the interior of the Peninsula was a terra incognita and the expedition was the first attempt to explore the interior and involved no small amount of danger and hardship. From an attack\nof dysentery contracted on that expedition Mr. O'BRIEN never really recovered his health. After a severe illness he was invalided home, and his name first appears amongst the list of members of the Society in the December number of the Journal for 1878.\n\nIn the June number of the Journal for 1883 he published a most valuable paper on the obscure nervous disease of Latah, which is universally admitted to be an excellent attempt to elucidate one of the most interesting mental anomalies in the Malay character.\n\nIn No. 14 of the Journal Mr. O'BRIEN published some interesting notes on the History of the Constitution of Jelebu, accompanied by a sketch survey of the Sungei Triang which was published with Journal No. 15. At this period Mr. O'BRIEN was acting as Resident of Sungei Ujong and while so acting the agreement was concluded with Sir. F. A. Weld under which Jelebu was administered under the advice of the Resident in the same way as Sungei Ujong.\n\nA fall from an elephant, which bolted in the jungle with him, in Jelebu, led to a series of complications which terminated in an attack of abscess of the liver. From that time Mr. O'BRIEN was no longer capable of much physical exertion and though he took a keen interest in everything connected with the Society he was no longer able to contribute in the way he would have wished, namely by personal observation and exploration of the Peninsula.\n\nWhile acting as Col. Treasurer in 1891 some old documents had to be destroyed to make room for new ones and while investigating the blurred and moth-eaten records of 50 years before he came across the interesting minutes of Sir Stamford Raffles, which was published in No. 24 of the Journal. This was his last contribution to the Journal.\n\nThe Hon'ble MARTIN LISTER, whose death took place in Egypt on his way home, in the spring, was also a well-known contributor. He took a deep interest in the Negri Sembilan States and what Mr. O'BRIEN did for Jelebu and Sungei Ujong and Mr. HERVEY for Rembau, Mr. LISTER did for the Sri Menanti and Johol group, with which he was for a long time intimately connected. His\nprincipal contribution was his paper on the Negri Sembilan in Journal No. 19, which he further expanded in his paper on \"Malay-Law in Negri Sembilan,\" in Journal No. 22.\n\nBoth Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Lister possessed to a prominent degree that sympathetic manner which renders Europeans popular with Malays, and their loss is equally mourned by Europeans and Natives.\n\nH. T. H.\n\nWe regret to have to record the death of Mr. Hn. Vaughan Stevens, an ethnological collector in the Malay Peninsula, well known to Members of the Society. He spent many years investigating the ethnology of the Sakais, visiting all parts of Malay Peninsula. His collections were chiefly sent to the museums of Berlin and St. Petersburg and accounts of them were published in the \"Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen aus dem K\u00f6niglichen Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde\" (Berlin), the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie, and Archiv der Pharmacie.\" (1893).\n\nMany members will remember a very interesting exhibition of his Pahang collections, held at the Raffles Library, in June 1890, under the auspices of the President and Council of the Society. His illness, due to the hardships he had undergone in his explorations was of some months' duration, and he expired at Kuching, Sarawak, on April 29th, at the age of sixty-two.\n\nH. N.

O. ANTHONISZ,\nHonorary Treasurer, Straits Branch Royal Asiatic Society.\nA Vocabulary of the Dusun Language of Kimanis.\n\nThe Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society No. 5 (June 1880) contained a list of Dusun words, collected by Mr. W. H. Treacher at the Tampassuk river. The author then added the following note to his vocabulary: \"I believe there are various dialects of D\u00fbs\u00fbn, more distinct the more inland the tribes live. The Vocabulary is from D\u00fbs\u00fbns in the constant habit of seeing Ir\u00e2n\u00fbns, Bajaus, and Brunei Malays.\"\n\nThe following list of words was collected in Kimanis, British North Borneo, in the year 1891. There is no doubt that the language to which these words belong, is spoken in various dialects by the so-called Dusuns of that region. They call themselves uhlun Kadusan and utterly deny the statement that they are descended from early Chinese settlers on the coast of Borneo which has often been made by European travellers. Their language certainly does not permit the least doubt as to their genuine Bornean origin. In many particulars it is one of the oldest and purest in all Malaya. Philology proves in regard to its languages what botany and zoology has proved with regard to its flora and fauna, that Borneo was separated from the western portion of Malaya, i.e., the Peninsula and Sumatra, at a very early period. This early separation has caused many primitive forms of speech to survive which have disappeared in the western territories.\n\nIt is a cause of regret that sufficient material has not yet been collected or published by philologists and travellers, to enable us to fix beyond the possibility of doubt the position of\nthe Bornean languages in relation to the entire Malayan family. Yet the material which has been collected so far seems to indicate that such a classification will not be a very difficult task. The languages of Borneo proper and those of the migratory Bajaus or Sea Gipsies and of the inhabitants of Butong (on the maps: Bouton) form one distinct group, which is intimately related to two other distinct groups, that of the Philippine and of the Sula-Amboyna languages. These three groups are evidently derived from a common source to which the name Austro-Malayan language might have been applied; had not this term lately been used to signify something very different. I propose therefore to call it the Eastern branch of the Malayan family of languages. There is also a corresponding Western branch, of which modern Malay may be regarded as type. From a comparison of these two branches the Proto-Malayan language may be philologically reconstructed. Such a task will, in the end, prove very useful in the examination of the relation of the Malayan languages to either the Indo-Chinese or the Polynesian families of languages.\n\nNo such comparison is possible now, and if attempted would only resemble the unsystematic researches of the past, when writers put the Hebrew or Turkish into juxtaposition to one or more of the Indo-European languages.\n\nIn the following pages I have abstained from entering into the domain of comparative philology, and the Malay words have been given in the vocabulary rather for the purpose of showing how far the Kadasan is separated from the lingua franca of this archipelago. For those who are desirous of studying the connection between the Dusun language and the languages of the Philippine group I can recommend a comparison of the words I have given with those of the Sulu, English and Malay Vocabulary published by Mr. T. H. Haynes in the Nos. 16 and 18 of this Journal.\n\nIn explanation of my statement above, that the Dusun\n(Kadasan) language contains some very old forms of words, I may be permitted to give at least one example:\n\nThe word for egg is: *antahlok*, which may be compared with Bajau *untello* (better *untelok*) and Bouton *ontolo*. The Southern Dayak form *t-anteloh* is augmented by a peculiar prefix not uncommon in Bornean languages.* Here we see in Dusun the fullest form with the strongly sounded h before the l, which all other Malayan languages have discarded at an early period. Remains of it may yet be recognized in a peculiar combination of sounds in some of the languages of the Sula-Amboyna group, expressed by Mr. A. R. Wallace by the letters *rh*. All these languages have not only preserved the first syllable, but have added a common prefix *m*. Sula: *met\u00e9lo*, Liang *muntiro*, Morella *muntirhui*, Batu-merah (Amboyna) *muntelod\u00e1*, Lariki *momatiro* (According to A. R. Wallace.)\n\nOn the other hand the Philippine group preserved the first syllable less carefully. Tagallo and Bisaya both have *itilog*, Sulu *iklog*. The final *g* corresponds to the final *k* of *antahlok*, while Sulu *k* represents only a local variation of the original *t*, as in *lubik* = *lubit*, string, rope. In the Philippine languages the word can be traced back to a primitive form *itilog*. An explanation of the change in the first syllable may seem desirable. The *an-* being short and unaccentuated gradually changed into *en-* which would be represented in Indo-European comparative philology as *n* = vowel-*n*. This sound always changed into a short vowel, mostly a, but it became i in a good many instances. I need but to allude to Greek and Latin\n\n*This prefix seems to have had the character of an article. It is also found in that dialect of the Dusun language of which Mr. W. H. Treacher has given a list of words: *tulun* (*uhlun*) man, *tandoh* (*onduk*) woman, female, *tinan* (*inan*) body, *tul\u016b* (*ulu*) head, *tuntulo* (*antahlok*) egg, *tumau* (*omau*) oil, *t\u0101dau* (*adau*) sun, day, *t\u0101po* (*apo\u00eb*) fire: etc.*\nreduplications like gign\u014dsk\u014d, to know, Latin gigno, to bring forth, where gi- stands for gn.\n\nFrom all the forms here given the original form can be derived, representing the Eastern branch of the Malayan languages, which in fact is the same as the Dusun (Kadasan) word.\n\nIt cannot escape the readers of the following vocabulary that the language described in this article, possesses a number of fuller forms than is found in most Malayan languages. Cf. sumumpah, Mal. sumpah, to swear; sumakit, Mal. sakit, sick; susuduk, Mal. suduk, spoon; etc., etc.\n\nAnother peculiarity needs to be mentioned, namely the prefix a\u2014which before adjectives intensifies the meaning of the word, while in other cases the signification remains the same. e.g.:\n\nAfagat besides fagat (Mal. brat, b\u0113rat) heavy.\nApodos , podos (Mal. p\u0113das) pungent.\nAninek , ninek small.\nAbok , b\u016b\u014dk (Treacher) hair, etc., etc.\n\nPronunciation.\n\nThe simple vowels have the Italian sound, only e is short as in Malay menang, or pedas. \u0113 is English a in race.\n\n\u0101 is the Swedish \u00e5, Danish aa, English aw (in law.)\n\n.. over a vowel does not modify the sound, but simply denotes di\u00e6resis e.g. tah\u014di pron. ta-h\u014d-i.\n\nThe hyphens are to be absolutely disregarded in the pronunciation, they are only employed to separate the root from prefixes and suffixes, e.g. m-iad must be read miad.\n\nThe consonants have the sound now almost universally recognized by philologists. I might add that h is always distinctly breathed, while \u1e25 is much stronger. It\nVOCABULARY OF THE DUSUN LANGUAGE.\n\nresembles Scotch or Swiss ch or Arabic \u0686.\nk is always audibly pronounced, final k is soft like Malay final \u06af but somewhat more distinctly pronounced than is customary at Singapore.\n\nRev.

plants, and hitherto these names have either been incorrectly determined or not determined at all in the few dictionaries in which one might expect to find them. This is the more regrettable since these names often possess a considerable amount of interest, as they often occur in Malay writings and a very large number of names of places are based on names of plants, such for instance are Malacca, Pekan, Setul, Penang, Changi, Cape Rumenia, Tanjong Ru, Gunong Pulai. The importance of correctly correlating the native names of drugs, timbers and other economic products with the scientific ones needs no explanation. Dictionaries and Vocabularies, such as those of Marsden and Favre, contain indeed a number of plant names, many of which are derived from Pijnappel, Klinkert, and Horsfield, but a considerable proportion of these appear to be Sumatran, and Javanese. Nor does Filet (Plantkundige Woordenboek) help much, for most of his Malay words are, as far as I have seen, not known in the Peninsula, or if they are in use are applied to a totally different plant from that which he gives. Thus the well-known plant Ampalas, the leaves of which are used for polishing wood, is given as signifying one or other of about ten kinds of fig trees, only one of which, as far as I know, is found in the Malay Peninsula, while the name is generally used here for a climber *Tetracera* belonging to quite a different order, viz: *Dilleniaceae*. Curiously, Filet does not appear to have made much use, if any, of Rumph\u2019s Herbarium Amboinense, a work containing a very large number of native names. Rumph gives a good many Malay names for his plants, and some of these are decidedly nearer those in use in the Peninsula than Filet\u2019s\nMalay words. I have not incorporated these however as there is no reason to think that they belong to the Malay of the Peninsula.\n\nA list of Malay plant names from Maingay's manuscripts at Kew was published in the Kew Bulletin 1890 p. 112-134, but in many cases these names were miscopied so as to be unidentifiable and in some are evidently wrongly identified with the plants.\n\nIn Jack's descriptions of Malay plants (Malayan Miscellanies, Bencoolen 1820-22) reprinted in the miscellaneous papers of this Society, Series II. Vol. II. pp. 209-295, several native names are given and these where they are given for Penang plants I have incorporated, adding Jack as authority, some of these being otherwise quite unknown to me and perhaps erroneously applied.\n\nFrom this list I have excluded some Persian and Hindu words, which have been included in some Malay Dictionaries and Vocabularies, as the plants intended either do not occur here at all or if they do are known under some other name. Javanese words usually in use here for cultivated plants, are excluded unless often employed, or used for well-known plants. I have added a few words which are almost certainly Sakai, when I have been able to come across them.\n\nThe list is very far from perfect, for not only have I been unable to procure many names from some of the Native States, but also a number of plants for which I have native names, are either as yet unidentified botanically or absolutely undescribed. Many of the timber trees and the rattans too have names only used for the trade product, and it is by no means easy in our present state of knowledge to identify accurately the prepared timber with the tree from which it came, which often has in the jungle an entirely different native name.\n\nMost plants have more than one name, and many have a\nconsiderable number. This is sometimes due to dialectic variation:\u2014thus the horse-mango is called Bachang, Machang, Hembachang, Membachang, etc., according to locality. But often the local names have no connection with each other, being evidently derived from different roots. Again, a Malay may call a plant by different names according to the products or properties of it he may be thinking of: thus the Gelenggang, *Cassia alata*, is also known as Daun Kurap\u2014the leaf for the cure of the disease Kurap.\n\nAgain, sometimes one name is used for several trees with apparently no connection, as Resak, which includes one species or more of *Shorea (Dipterocarpus)*, an oak, and one or two unidentified plants, the name really being applied to the timber which in these trees is somewhat similar. It is probable that in all these cases the different Resaks will be found to have qualifying words to distinguish them apart, but these are known to but few Malays. While many of the names are remarkably opposite others are either apparently meaninglessly obscene, or their signification is quite obscure. I have added translations of such as are translateable, but many of these are only tentative.\n\nIn some cases the obscurity arises in the following way. A plant originally receives a suitable name, such as Ati-Ati (hearts) for the garden coleus, because of its heart-shaped leaves, but some resemblance is noticed between this plant and another (*Sonerila*) and though the leaves of this are not heart-shaped, it is called Ati-Ati hutan, that is to say really jungle coleus. The Malay has on the whole a very good eye for resemblance in plants and some of his identifications are really quite remarkable: thus Kerubut is applied to the *Rafflesia* and a shrub known as *Thottea*, two utterly different looking plants to the eye of an ordinary observer, but which are considered in botany to be allied. Again, he is seldom wrong when\nspeaking of an orchid (Anggrek) though I have more than once known educated Europeans sadly at fault.\n\nTo all the names given in the list the word Pokok, tree or shrub, must be added, unless the plant is a climber, when Akar is used, or it is small and herbaceous when Rumput is added. There are several Malay words which appear to have special meanings when applied to plant-names. Jantan (male) appears usually to mean that the fruit is less abundant or conspicuous in the species than it is in some other which is qualified by the name Betina. Gajab (elephant) conveys the idea of large. Tikus or Tupai, (mouse or squirrel) small. Hantu (ghost) corresponds to our word \"false\" as applied to plant names. Hutan signifies wild, as opposed to cultivated. Antan, a word sometimes used, I have been unable to get any meaning for, though there is a word spelt in the same way which signifies a pestle: as applied to plants it seems to bear the same meaning as \"false.\"\n\nTill we know more of the Malay and allied languages it would be premature to form any deduction as to the origin of many of the plant-names, or their primitive meaning. Some it is true, like Nyur (cocoanut), Nanas (pine apple), Nona (custard apple), have evidently accompanied the plants from afar and have been introduced with them, and in some cases may possibly throw light on the original home of some of the rather numerous cultivated plants not known to be wild anywhere, and whose origin is not yet known. Other names have evident reference to the various properties or the appearance of the plant.\n\nThis list must be considered only a preliminary one which, it may be hoped, will be considerably augmented as our knowledge of things Malayan increases.\nADAL-ADAL.

Besides there are a number of trade names applied to the rattans as brought into the market, which apply to the form of the rattan rather than to the kind.\n\nGriffith (Palms of British India) describes and figures a number obtained in Malacca; to these he gives in many cases Malay names, but I cannot find that these names are now at least applied to the species he describes even in Malacca.\n\nROTAN BAKAU\n*Daemonorops propinquus* Becc.

In starting planting operations, however, the object is if possible to coincide with the season when the West wind blows, because at that time there are frequent rains and accordingly the earth of the rice-field becomes soft and easy to plough. Moreover in planting rice it is an invariable rule that there must be water in the field, in order that the rice may sprout properly; though on the other hand if there is too great a depth of water the rice is sure to die. It has also been observed that as a rule the season of the West wind coincides with the fourth month\u2020 of the Chinese calendar, and sometimes also with the month of Zilkaidah or Zilhijah.\n\n2.\u2014In olden time the order of planting operations was as follows:\u2014First the elders had to hold a consultation with the Pawang; then the date was fixed; then Maulud prayers were read over the \"mother seed\" and benzoin, supplied by the pawang: was burned; then all the requisites for rice planting were got ready, viz:\u2014\n\n(1) A strong buffalo (to pull the plough);\n(2) A plough with its appurtenances (to turn over the earth and the short weeds);\n(3) A harrow with its appurtenances (to level and break up small the clods of earth left by the plough);\n\n[*In 1893 these months extended from the 17th May to the 14th July. C. O. B.]\n\n[\u2020In 1893 from the 16th May to the 13th June.\u2014C. O. B.]\n(4) A roller with its appurtenances (to knock down the long weeds, such as sedges, in fields that have lain fallow for a long while);\n(5) A wood cutter\u2019s knife to mend any of the implements that may get out of order at the time of ploughing;\n(6) A hoe to repair the embankments and level the higher ground.\n(7) A scythe to cut the long weeds;\n(8) And a whip to urge the buffalo on if he is lazy.\n\n3.\u2014When the proper season has arrived for beginning the work of planting and the elders have come to an agreement with the Pawang, then on some Friday after the service in the Mosque the Penghulu addresses all the people there present, saying that on such a day of the month, every one who is to take part in rice-cultivation must bring to the Mosque half a quart of grain (for \u201cmother seed\u201d) in order that that Maulud prayers may be read over it. (At that time Ketupats and Lepats are prepared for the men who are to read those prayers).\n\nWhen the Maulud prayers are over, every man goes down to the rice-field, if possible on the same day or the next one, in order to begin ploughing the nursery plot, that is the plot which is near his house or in which he has been in the habit of sowing the seed every year.\n\nBut if a man has a great number of plots, he will begin by ploughing half of them and then at the end of the month of Zil-hijah he must diligently prepare the nursery plot, so as to be ready in about ten days\u2019 time.\n\nOf Sowing.\n\n4.\u2014Before sowing one must first of all lay out the grain, both the seed-grain and the \u201cmother-seed,\u201d each separately, to dry. It must then be soaked in a vessel (a bucket or pot) for two days and two nights, after which it is taken out, strained and spread quite evenly on a mat with fresh leaves (areca-nut fronds are best) and every afternoon one must sprinkle water on it, in order that the germ may quickly break through, which will happen probably in two days\u2019 time or thereabouts.\n\n5.\u2014While the seed is soaking, the nursery plot must be\ncarefully prepared: that is to say, it must be ploughed over; again, harrowed, levelled, ditched, and the soil allowed to settle; the embankments must be mended and the surface made smooth. When the germs have sprouted the seed is taken to the nursery plot. Benzoin supplied by the Rawang is burnt and the plot sprinkled with *tepong tawar*. Then a beginning is made by sowing the \"chief of the seed\" [*i.e.* \"mother-seed\"] in one corner of the nursery, prepared for the purpose and about two yards square; afterwards the rest of the seed is sown all over the plot. It is well to sow when the plot contains plenty of water, so that all the germs of the seed may be uppermost and the roots may not grow long but may be pulled up easily. The time for sowing must be during the dark half of the month, so that the seedlings may be preserved from being eaten by insects.\n\nThree days after the seed is sown the young shoots begin to rise like needles and at that time all the water should be drawn off the plot; after seven days they are likened to a sparrow's tail, and about the tenth or fifteenth day they break out into blades. At that period the water is again let into the plot, little by little, in order that the stalks of the seedlings may grow thick.\n\nThe seedlings have to remain in the nursery for at least forty or forty-four days from the time of sowing, before they are sufficiently grown: it is best to let them remain till they are about seventy days old.\n\n6.\u2014While the seedlings are in the nursery, the other plots are being ploughed, one after another: and this is called the first ploughing. Then the embankments are mended and reformed with earth, so that the water in the field may not escape and leave it dry. After the embankments have been mended the harrowing begins: a start is made with the plot that was first ploughed (other than the nursery plot) for there the earth will have become soft and the weeds being rotten after many days of soaking in the water will form a sort of manure. Each plot is so dealt with in its turn. Then all have to be ploughed once more which is called the second ploughing) and harrowed again; for the first harrowing merely breaks up the clods of earth and a second is required to reduce them to a fine state and to kill the weeds. Most people, having first used an iron harrow, use a\nwooden one for the second harrowing in order that the earth may be broken up quite fine. Their rice is sure to thrive better than that of people who are less careful: for in rice-planting, as the saying goes there is \"the plighted hope of good that is to come,\" in the way of bodily sustenance I mean. So day by day the different plots are treated in the way that has been described in connection with the nursery plot in paragraph 5 above.\n\nOf Planting.\n\n7.\u2014When the seedling rice has been in the nursery long enough and the fields are clean and ready for planting (which will be about the month of Safar or August) the seedlings are pulled up and tied together with strips of dried palas leaves into bundles of the size known as sachekak. If the roots and blades are long, the ends can be clipped a little, and the roots are then steeped in manure. This manure is made of buffalo bones burnt with chaff till they are thoroughly calcined, and then pounded fine, passed through a sieve and mixed with mud: that is the best kind of manure for rice-planting and is known as stock \"manure.\" (It can also be applied by merely scattering it in the fields. In that case, after cutting off the ends of the blades, the seedlings are planted and afterwards, when they are green again and appear to be thriving, the manure is scattered over the whole field. There are some places too where no manure at all is used, because of the perennial richness of the soil.)\n\nAfterwards the seedlings are allowed to remain exposed to the air for about two nights and then taken to the field to be planted. The bundles are broken up and bunches of four or five plants together are planted at intervals of a span all over the different plots till all are filled up. If there are very many plots, ten or fifteen female labourers can be engaged to assist in planting, and likewise in pulling up the seedlings, at a wage of four cents for every hundred bundles.\n\nOf the Rice after it has been Transplanted.\n\n8.\u2014Ten days after the young rice has been transplanted it recovers its fresh green colour; in thirty days the young shoots come out; in the second month it increases more and more, and\nin the third it becomes even all over. After three months and a half its growth is stayed and in the fourth month it is styled bunting kecil.\n\nAt that stage the stalk has only five joints, and from that period it must be fumigated daily till the grain appears.\n\nAbout the time when the stalk has six joints, it is called bunting besar; in forty days more the grain is visible here and there, and twenty days later it spreads everywhere. At this time all the water in the field must be drawn off so that the grain may ripen quickly. After five or six days it ripens in patches and a few days later the rice is altogether ripe.\n\nFrom the time of transplanting to the time when it is ripe is reckoned six months, not counting the days spent in ploughing and in growing it in the nursery, which may be a month or two, or even (if there are many plots) as much as three months to the end of the ploughing.\n\nOf Reaping and Taking the Soul of the Rice.\n\n9.\u2014When one wishes to begin reaping the grain one must first have the Pawang\u2019s permission, and burn benzoin supplied by him in the field.\n\nThe following implements must also be got ready, viz.\n\n(1) A small basket to hold the rice cut first known as the \u201cSoul of the Rice.\u201d\n\n(2) A jari lipan to put round the small basket:\n\n(3) A string of terap bark to tie up the rice that is cut first.\n\n(4) A small stem of bamboo, of the variety known as buloh kasap, with a flag attached, which is to be planted in the small basket as a sign of the \u201csoul of the rice\u201d that has been cut first;\n\n(5) A small white cloth to wrap up the \u201csoul of the rice\u201d;\n\n(6) An anchak to hold the brasier;\n\n(7) A brasier, in which to burn the incense provided by the Pawang;\n\n(8) A nail and a kind of nut, known as buah keras, to be put into the anchak together with the brasier.\n\nWhen the rice is ripe all over, one must first take the \u201cSoul\u201d out of all the plots of one\u2019s field. You choose the spot\nwhere the rice is best and where it is \"female\" (that is to say where the bunch of stalks is big) and where there are seven joints in the stalk. You begin with a bunch of this kind and clip seven stems to be the \"soul of the rice\"; and then you clip yet another handful to be the \"mother seed\" for the following year. The \"Soul\" is wrapped in a white cloth tied with a cord of terap bark and made into the shape of a little child in swaddling clothes, and put into the small basket. The \"mother seed\" is put into another basket and both are fumigated with benzoin and then the two baskets are piled the one on the other and taken home and put into the kepuk (the receptacle in which rice is stored).\n\n10.\u2014One must wait three days (called the pantang tua\u00ef) before one may clip or cut any more of the rice. At first only one or two basketfuls of rice are cut: the rice is dried in the sun, winnowed in a winnowing basket and cleaned in a fanning machine, pounded to free it from the husk so that it becomes beras and then boiled so that it becomes nasi, and people are invited to feast on it.\n\n11.\u2014Then a bucket is made for the purpose of threshing the rest of the rice, and a granary built to keep it in while it remains in the field, and five or six labourers are engaged to reap and thresh it. Their hours of working are from 6 to 11.30 a.m. and all the rice they thresh they put into the granary.\n\n12.\u2014If the crop is a good one, a gallon of seed will produce a hundred fold. Each plot in a field takes about a gallon of seed.\n\n13.\u2014When the rice has all been ent, it is winnowed in order to get rid of the chaff and then laid out in the sun till quite dry so that it may not get mouldy if kept for a year.\n\nThen the wages of the labourers are taken out of it at the rate of two gallons out of every ten. When that is settled, if the rice is not to be sold, it is taken home and put into the rice-chest.\n\nWhenever you want to eat of it, you take out a basketful at a time and dry it in the sun. Then you turn it in the winnowing basket and clean it in the fanning machine, pound it to convert it into beras (husked rice) and put a sufficiency of it in a pot and wash it. Enough water is then poured over it to cover it and it\nis put on the kitchen fire till it is boiled and becomes nasi, when it can be eaten.\n\n14.\u2014The custom of reaping with a sickle and threshing the rice as described in paragraph 11 is a modern method and is at present mainly practised by the people living in the neighbourhood of the town of Malacca, in order to get the work done quickly; but in olden times it was not allowed and even to this day, the people who live in the inland parts of the territory of Malacca prefer to clip their rice with a tuai, and put it into their baskets a handful at a time [i.e. without threshing it]. (If labourers are employed to do this, their wage is one tenth of the rice cut). It takes ever so many days to get the work done, but the idea is that this method is the pious one, the \"soul of the rice\" not being disturbed thereby. A good part of the people hold this belief and assert that since the custom of threshing the rice has been introduced, the crops have been much less abundant than in years of olden time when it was the custom to use the tuai only.\n\n15.\u2014If a man has broad fields so that he is unable to plant them all by his own labour, he will often allow another to work them on an agreement, either of equal division of the produce (each bearing an equal share of the hire of a buffalo and all other expenses incidental to rice-planting) or of three-fold division (that is, for example, the owner bears all expenses, in which case the man who does the work can get a third of the produce; or the latter bears all expenses, in which case the owner only gets a third of the produce). Or again, the land can be let: for instance a field which ordinarily produces a Koyan* of rice a year will fetch a rent of about two hundred gallons, more or less.\n\n16.\u2014Every cultivator who does not act in accordance with the ordinance laid down in paragraphs 9 and 10 above will be in the same case as if he disregarded all the prohibitions laid down in connection with planting. If a man does not carry out this procedure he is sure to fail in the end; his labour will be in vain and will not fulfil his desires, for the virtue of all\nthese ordinances and prohibitions lies in the fact that they protect the rice and drive away all its enemies, such as grubs, rats, swine and the like.\n\n[*A Koyan, as a measure of weight, contains 40 pikuls = 5333\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) lbs. Rather over 20 gallons (gantang) of rice (padi) go to a pikul. The term Koyan is also used as a measure of capacity, in which sense it contain 800 gantangs.\n\nThe term gantang has been rendered here by \"gallon\" of which it is at present the legal equivalent, but the native gantang had a standard varying according to locality.\n\nC. O. B.]\nNOTES AND QUERIES.\n\nProtective Charm\n\nIf a child has to be taken out late in the afternoon so that it will probably be out at nightfall it is usual among Malays in Malacca to put on the top of its head and just under and behind the two ear-lobes a little red betel-juice, to ward off evil spirits.\n\nWith this custom cf. Crooke, \"An Introduction to the Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India,\" p. 201. \"Colours are scarers of evil spirits. They particularly dread yellow, black, red and white... The parting of the bride's hair is stained with vermilion, though here, perhaps, the practice is based on the symbolical belief in the blood covenant,\" and ibid p. 197, where betel is mentioned as a scarer of evil spirits.\n\nIt would be interesting to learn whether this charm is used in other parts of the Peninsula?\n\nEarthquakes.\n\nAccording to some Malays the earth rests between the hours of a gigantic bull; when he shakes himself, either through lassitude or for some other reason, the result is an earthquake.\n\nCf. Crooke, op cit. p. 19. \"The common explanation of these occurrences in India is that Vishnu in his Var\u00e1ha or boar incarnation is changing the burden of the world from one tusk to another. By another account this is done by the great bull or elephant which supports the world.\"\n\nThe South.\n\nCrooke, op cit. p. 219, states \"The South is the realm of death, and no one will sleep or have their house door opening toward that ill-omened quarter of the sky.\"\n\nCompare with this the following extract from a Malay treatise on these matters:\n\nBermula jika pintu rumah mengadap ka-mashrik baik,\nalamat beruleh anak chuchu banyak lagi sentosa: jika mengadap ka-utara baik alamat beruleh mas perak lagi semperna: jika mengadap ka-maghrib bertambah-tambah alamat baik atau orang alim datang kapada-nya lagi salamat; jika mengadap ka-selatan malang pada barang kerja-nya; tiada semperna maksud-nya.\n\nNames of Months.\n\nIn the inland villages of Malacca the names of the Muhammadan months are as follows:\n\n1. Bulan Muharram\n2. \" Safar\n3. \" Sulong Maulud\n4. \" P\u0101d\u016ba (or Sengah) Maulud\n5. \" Per\u016bga (or Alang) Maulud\n6. \" Bongsu Maulud\n7. \" Aruah\n8. \" Khenduri\n9. \" Puasa\n10. \" Raya\n11. \" Berapit\n12. \" Haji\n\nbut for the 7th month Rej\u0101h is the more general name and Sha'aban is perhaps more commonly used for the 8th.\n\nAre the above terms usual in other districts?\n\nBenzoin.\n\nMr. Groeneveldt in the Appendix to his \"Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca,\" (Essays relating to Indo-China, series II. vol I. p. 261) remarks under this head:\n\nBenzoin, gold and silver incense. It is described as follows in the \"Tung Hsi Yang K'au\" Book 3 p. 23: \"Inside this incense are white spots as clods of white wax; the best sort has much of this white, and the inferior sorts but little. When burnt it is very fragrant.\" We think this description cannot but apply to the gum benzoin.\nMr. Groeneveldt does not point out that the name given to it in the Chinese text affords a strong corroboration to this identification. It may be questioned indeed whether the Chinese nomenclator meant the words here rendered gold and silver to be read phonetically, or whether he himself assumed this ingenious transcription to be a true etymological rendering of the Malay name, which is Kemenyian. Either way, the Chinese name* is phonetically near enough to the Malay name to make it certain that benzoin is meant.\n\n* Cant.\u2014Kem ngen.\nHak.\u2014Kim ngyn.\nHok.\u2014Kim gun.\nHail.\u2014Kium ngien.\n\nBatara Guru.\n\nIn a Mayang Invocation published in the Selangor Journal of the 7th Sept., 1894, the following interesting passage occurs:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0643\u0648\u0643\u0648 \u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0643\u0648\u0643\u0648 \u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0641 \u0646\u064a\u0646\u0642 \u0643\u0648\u0643\u0648 \u064a\u063a\u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u062a\u0631\u0627 \u0643\u0648\u0643\u0648 \u0643\u0648\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\n\n\u0645\u062c\u0627\u062f\u064a \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u062a \u062f\u063a\u0646 \u062c\u0633\u062f \u062c\u0627\u062f\u064a\n\n\"H. C.\" translates this:\n\n\"Peace be unto thee! I am about to remove from thee, my Grandsire, who art styled P\u0113\u1e6d\u0113ra G\u016bru, the original teacher, who art from the beginning, and who art incarnate from thy birth.\"\n\nI am inclined to read the adverbial Arabic \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u0644 with the following word \u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0644 rather than with the preceding word \u0643\u0648\u0631\u0648 \u0643\u0648\u0631\u0648.\n\nThis, however, does not alter the general sense of the passage beyond bringing out more clearly the fact that \"Guru\" is used as a proper name.\n\nIn the Selangor Journal of the 22nd February, 1895, the following passage occurs in an article on the invocation of the Padi Spirits, over the signature of \"W. S.\"\n\n\"When the jungle is first cleared for the forming of a new Padi swamp, importance is attached to the invocation of certain mythical personages who may have probably been the\n\"deities of the Malay in the pre-Mohammedan epoch. These\nthe Pawang should invoke by name as follows:\n\n\"'Toh Mentala Guru!\n\"'Sarajah (? Si Raja) Guru!\n\"'Gempitar A'lam!\n\"'Sarajah (? Si Raja) Malek!'\n\n\"All that I can find out about Toh Mentala (here called Toh\nPetala Guru) is that he was the all-powerful Spirit who took\nthe place of Allah before the advent of Mohammedanism; a\nspirit so powerful that he could restore the dead to life and to\nwhom all prayers were addressed. This name is said to be still\npreserved among the genuine Orang Laut. ....... The old\ncustoms are fast dying out, and very few Malays I have met\nnow know the names of the four deities (or demons) given\nabove.\"\n\nA note is appended to the word: \"Toh Mentala guru:\"\n\"These four titles are said to refer to four different deities but\nI see no reason why the next two should not be merely epi-\nthets of Toh Mentala.\"\n\n\"Batara Guru,\" or \"Sang-yang Guru\" is the name by\nwhich Siva is known to his worshippers who constitute the vast\nmajority of the Balinese, and who probably constituted the bulk\nof the old Javanese. About his identity with the \"P\u0113t\u0113ra Gu-\nru\" of the Mayong invocation, and with the \"Petala Guru\" or\n\"Mentala Guru\" of the Pawang's appeal, there can be very\nlittle doubt. I would suggest the following version of the\nlatter:\n\n\"To' Batara Guru!\n\"Sang-raja Guru!\n\"Gempitar alam!\n\"Sang-raja malik!\n\nThe four lines refer to the same deity; \"Malik\" being merely\nthe Arabic for \"King\" and not a proper name.\n\nMalay theatrical performances and dances owe so much to\nJavanese influence that it would be dangerous to infer from a\nMayong invocation that Batara Guru was necessarily known to\nthe pre-Mohammedan Malays. Nevertheless it is possible enough\nthat they were of the same religion as their neighbours the Javanese. The formula uttered by the Pawang goes far to show this; and I concur with Mr. Skeat in expressing a hope that something will be done to rescue these fragments of old Malay folklore from the destruction with which they are threatened.\n\nBatara Guru plays a considerable part in Malay literature, but as that literature is so often merely translated from the Javanese, no conclusion can safely be drawn from it regarding the ancient religion of the country. In the Hikayat Sang Samba (the Malay version of the Bhaumakavya) Batara Guru appears as a supreme God with Brahma and Vishnu as subordinate deities. It is Batara Guru who alone has the water of life (ayer utama (atama) jiwa) which brings the slaughtered heroes to life. This attribute corresponds closely with the account of \"Mentala Guru\" given by the pawang to Mr. Skeat.\n\nThe following pantuns given me by a comparatively illiterate Malay are of some interest in connection with this question of Batara Guru. I give the text as I received it, but it bears signs of being corrupt in parts:\n\nAmbil golok kupas kelapa,\nP\u011brah santan ambil pati;\nNaik ka gunong p\u011brgi bertapa\nMenghadap B\u011brahmana, maharaja Sakti.\n\nP\u011brah santan ambil pati\nKasih makan Dato' P\u011bnghulu;\nB\u011brapa di tanya ta-biar b\u011brmimpi\nKapada B\u011brahmaua Sang Raja Guru!\n\nBersanding di g\u011bt\u0101 Raja M\u011blayu\nB\u011brukir bunga tampok p\u011brada\nBerkata uleh Sang Raja Guru\n\"Galo m\u011bnj\u0113lma di manjapada!\"\n\nThe story goes on to relate how the Galoh (princess) whose name is given as Galoh Chandra Kirana is transformed by Batara Kala into a man and how her betrothed, Panji Misa K\u011blana wanders distractedly in search of her with the poor consolation.\nRaut raut daun k\u0115lapa\nH\u0115ndak dibuat lidi p\u0115nyapu;\nTujoh tahun sudah bertapa,\nK\u0115m\u016ddian chari buleh b\u0115rt\u0115mu.\n\nUltimately the lovers are reunited. The references in these pantuns will easily be understood by those acquainted with the leading incidents in the \"Panji Cyclus\" of tales\u2014(v. Essays relating to Indo-China, Second Series, Vol. ii. p. 40) It is noteworthy however that Batara Guru is identified in the pantuns with \"Berhmana.\" \"Brahma\" is usually \"B\u0115rma\" or \"B\u0115rma Sakti;\" and the author of the pantun appears to have been a comparatively modern Malay who attempted to improve on the old legend which did not explicitly state who Batara Guru was.\n\nAnother point of interest is the expression \"Batara\" or \"Sang-yang\" which is prefixed to \"Guru.\" \"Yang,\" of course, is not \"yang,\" who,\u2014but \"Yang,\" a deity (compare Sembahyang, ka-yang-an.) \"Sang-yang\" is never (in Malay literature, so far as I am acquainted with it) applied to any demi-god or inferior deity. Thus we have \"Sang-yang Guru,\" \"Sang-yang Bisnu,\" but never \"Sangyang Hanuman,\" or \"Sang-yang Dermadewa.\" These inferior divinities are merely \"Sang,\" (e.g. Sang Dermadewa, Sang Samba, Sang Sri Hanuman)\u2014a honorific also applied to mortals, e.g., Sang Sapurba, Sang Ranjuna Tapa; and even to animals in fables, e.g., Sang Kanchil, Sang Tikus. The expression \"Batara\" is also limited to the greater Hindu divinities (except when used as a royal title), e.g., Batara Guru, Batara Kala, Batara Indra, Batara Bisnu, etc. Thus the expressions \"Sang-yang\" and \"Batara, are fairly coincident in their application. But there are a few deities of whom the honorific \"Sang-yang\" is used but not \"Batara,\" e.g., \"Sang-yang Tunggal,\" the only God, \"Sang-yang Sokma,\" etc. Thus \"Batara\" would seem to be limited in use to the actual names of Hindu deities as distinct from epithets describing those deities. \"Batara Guru\" would seem to be an exception\u2014the only one\u2014to this rule and to point to the fact the original meaning of \"Guru\" had been lost sight of and that the expression had come to be regarded only as a proper name.\n\nIn the \"Sila-silah Raja-raja di tanah Jawa\" (v. Indo-China\nEssays, Series II, vol. ii. p. 20) an extraordinary genealogy is given representing Adam as the father of Seth, Seth of \"N\u00fcrchaya,\" N\u00fcrchaya of Sang-yang Wenang Sang-yang Wenang of Sang-yang Tunggal, Sang-yang Tunggal of Guru, and Guru of Sangyang Sambu, Brahma, Mahadewa, Bisnu, and Dewi Sri.\n\nIt is impossible to do much with this genealogy except to notice that \"Guru\" is treated as distinct from the \"Mahadewa,\" another name for Siva. Thus Guru is represented as the father of the Hindu Trinity, and also of Sambu (whom I cannot identify) and Sri, who is the Hindu Sri, the goddess of grain and therefore a deity of immense importance to the old Javanese and Malays' \"Sri\" is the goddess invoked in another invocation in the Selangor Journal article of the 22nd February, 1895; where the Pawang addresses the padi:\n\n\"Lagi di dalam Shurga\n\"Bernama buah khaldi (?)\n\"Sampai ka-dunya bernama\n\"Buah Sri, t\u00eanyang Sri.\"\n\"Jangan rosak jangan binasakan\n\"Buah Sri, t\u00eanyang Sri.\"\n\nTo this passage Mr. Skeat adds a note: \"The Sri fruit may mean the blessed fruit (in the ordinary sense of Sri or Sri) and be given as a euphonious title to padi, but it reminds one strangely of 'Ceres,' the goddess of grain.\"\n\nR. J. W.\n\nCalanthe vestita Lindl. in Selangor.\n\nThis well-known and popular orchid has rather a remarkable distribution, being found in Tenasserim and Borneo, and it might well be expected to occur somewhere in the intermediate region, especially in limestone districts. It does not occur, so far as is known in the Lankawi islands, where it might have been expected, being replaced there by the pretty C. rubens Ridl., but I found a single plant in a crevice in a tree on the top of the limestone rocks at the Kuala Lumpur caves (Guabatu). It was in perfect flower in December, and was a very fine form. The upper part of these rocks is in many places quite inaccessible, and indeed it is in but few places one can get\nto the top. The flora there is very different from anything we have even at the lower part of the cliffs, and in many respects is similar to that of the limestone rocks of the Lankawi islands.\n\nIn recording this discovery of a connecting link between two regions so far apart as Tenasserim and Borneo, I may mention another, viz. that of *Dendrobium heterocarpum* Wall, (*D aureum* Lindl.) which was known to occur in India (Nepal, Assam, Malabar and Ceylon), in Java, and the Philippine islands, and which has recently been found by Mr. A. B. Stephens in Perak, on the Thaiping hills.\n\nH. N. R.\n\n**Boriah.**\n\nIn part II. of Clifford and Swettenham's Malay-English Dictionary, under the head of Boriah, I find Boriah,\n\n\u0628\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0647 A topical song. B\u00e1cha boriah \u0628\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u062c To sing a topical song.\n\nNo derivation of the word is given. The use of the word is chiefly confined to the pantomimes or mimic plays which are acted by Malays in Penang Town during the month of Muharam. It is of Persian origin, according to Forbes, and means a \"mat\" in Hindustani. The following account of the word which I have received from an Indian in Penang will throw some light on the subject, as I believe, fanciful derivations of the word have been suggested.\n\n\"The plain meaning of the word Boriah in the Hindustani and Deccan language is a place of prayer (praying carpet), and in Malay they call it Tikar (a mat). Formerly in the year 1845, the 21st Regiment was transferred from Madras to Penang. The Muhammedans of the Regiment used to be given ten days' leave in the month of Muharram for the purpose of mourning for the grandsons of the prophet. These military men used to form parties and sing songs of mourning. For instance, representing four persons, Nanak Shah, Jogi Majnun, Balva Ghaghri, and Boria, they used to dress up in clothes made of mats and mourn for Husain, and used to recite the following piece of poetry\u2014\n\"Boria the best of its kind;\n\"Boria everywhere in the world;\n\"Boria the beautiful (was) seen;\n\"Sacred and pure Boria.\n\n\"In the countries of Madras\n\"The Boria is made of grass;\n\"Fences are made with bamboo;\n\"Boria is green in colour. etc., etc.\n\n\"But in Penang the name of Boria is from the 21st Regiment, and has become celebrated. Now-a-days the Malays have given their own different names to it, but they call all of them Boria for the purpose of asking charity for them. In Madras wherever the Regiment is the Boria play is performed.\"\n\nH. T. Haughton.\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE SOCIETY.\n\nJOURNALS.
