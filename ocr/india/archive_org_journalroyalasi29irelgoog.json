The original P\u0101li Text, with an English Translation. By V. Fausb\u00f6ll.\n\n[Read February 17, 1870.]\n\nThe two J\u0101takas I here lay before the public contain, as will be seen, two fables which, in the tale that forms the framework of the second book of the Pancatantra, were combined into one. Only the main features, however, are the same, the details differing greatly; and the same is the case in all the other tales which the J\u0101takas have in common with the Pancatantra and the Hitopade\u00e7a. But, as the MSS. of these two works disagree so much that there are almost as many texts as there are MSS. (\"ut poene quot codices, tot textus esse dicere possis,\" Kosegarten, p. vi), new editions of both of them, based on the oldest MSS. that can be found in India, would be of great value; and if once the oldest MS. in existence had been discovered, I should particularly recommend its publication without any alloy from other MSS., that we might be sure we have one clear, self-consistent text. I think that if this had been done, the similarity between the Singhalese (P\u0101li) and the continental (Sanscrit) fables would appear greater; the Pancatantra being originally, as Prof. Benfey has clearly shown, a Buddhistic work. If we look at the first of the two following fables, it will be seen that the truth to be expounded is the old one, couched by Sallust\nbahi positabba\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101nam atthi mam\u00f1\u0113\u201d ti \u0101ha.

Sammodam\u0101naj\u0101takam.\n\n\"Agreeing.\" This the Master related, while living in the grove of banyan-trees, near Kapilavatthu, in reference to a dispute about wreaths. This (dispute) will appear in the Kun\u0101la-J\u0101taka. At that time, namely, the Master admonishing (his) relations (said): Emperors! dispute between relatives mutually is, surely not becoming; even (some) animals which had conquered (their) enemies at the time of concord, when quarrelling, suffered great destruction, (and) so having said, (when) called upon by (his) royal relatives, he told a story:\n\nIn (times) past, when Brahmadatta reigned in B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b, Bodhisatta, having been born a quail, lived in the wood with an attendance of many thousands of quails. Then a quail-hunter, after going to their dwelling-place, (and) having counterfeited the cry of quails, and seen that they had assembled, threw (his) net over them, (and) after drawing it together at the sides (and) uniting all in one (heap), he filled his basket, went to (his) house, sold them, and (thus) had his livelihood with that money. But one day Bodhisatta said to those quails, \"This fowler destroys our kin; I know a means by (employing) which he will not be able to catch us. Henceforth as soon as the net is thrown over us by him, you, having each of you put (his) head into one mesh of the net (and) lifted the net (and) carried (it) to whatever place you choose, cast (it) on a thorn-bush. This being (done) we shall escape each from under his place.\" (Saying) Very good! they all promised (to do so). The next day when the net had been thrown over (them), then having lifted the net in the way mentioned by Bodhisatta (and) having cast it on a thorn-bush, they themselves fled away from underneath. While the fowler was extricating the net from the bush, it had become dark. He went away empty-handed. From the following day the quails act in the same way. And he until sunset (being busy) extricating the net, without having got anything, goes to (his) house empty-handed. Then his wife,\nbeing angry, said, \"You come empty-handed every day; I think that outside (this place) there must be (another) for thy sustenance.\" The fowler (said), \"Dear! there is no other place for my sustenance; those quails indeed live in harmony, (and) taking (away with them) the net (as soon as it is) thrown by me, they cast (it) on a thorn-bush and go (away). But surely they will not always live in harmony. Thou must not grieve. When they fall into disunion, then, having taken them all, I shall come and make your face smile;\" (and) thus saying he repeated this stanza to (his) wife:\n\n\"(While) agreeing the birds go (away)\ncarrying off the net,\nbut when they quarrel\nthey will then fall into my power.\"\n\nWhen a short time had passed, one quail, descending on the pasture-ground, unawares trod on the head of another. The other was angry (and said), \"Who trod on my head?\" and although the first said, \"Be not angry, I trod (on it) unawares,\" yet he was angry. They, again and again talking (together), quarrelled with each other, saying, \"(It is) thou, I suppose, (that) liftest the net.\" While they were quarrelling, Bodhisatta thought, \"For those who quarrel there is no safety, now they will not lift the net, then they will incur great destruction, the fowler will have a (good) chance. I cannot stay in this place (any longer).\" So he took his retinue and went elsewhere. But the fowler, after a little while, came and counterfeited the cry of the quails, and when they had assembled he threw the net over (them). Then one quail said, \"While lifting the net, the feathers on thy head fell off, now lift (it again).\" Another said, \"While lifting the net, thy wings on both sides dropped, now lift (it again).\" Thus while they were saying, \"Lift (the net again),\" the fowler threw (his) net, and after uniting all in one (heap), and filling (his) bag, he went home and made (his) wife smile.\n\nThe Master (said), \"Thus, O Emperor! the dispute of relatives is not becoming, dispute is the root of destruction; (and) so (saying and) having given this moral instruction, he wound up the J\u00e1taka by saying: \"At that time the unwise\nquail was Devadatta, but the wise quail I.\u201d\u2014The Sammodam\u00e1na-Birth.\n\nNOTES ON JATAKA 33.\n\n*Nigrodha*, Abhidh\u00e1n. by Subb\u00fati, vv. 551, 1042; in Sanscrit nyagrodha, ficus religiosa. In J. Lindley\u2019s \u201cA Natural System of Botany,\u201d 2 Edit. p. 177, we read the following passage: \u201cThe celebrated banyan-tree of India is Ficus religiosa. Prince Maximilian, of Wied Neuwied, says that the colossal wild fig-trees are one of the most grateful presents of nature to hot countries; the shade of such a magnificent tree refreshes the traveller when he reposes under its incredibly wide-spreading branches, with their dark green shining foliage. The fig-trees of all hot countries have generally very thick trunks, with extremely strong boughs, and a prodigious crown.\u201d That *cumbata* means a wreath may be seen from J. 471, where we find the following passage: \u201c\u015b\u0101 tesam gatak\u0101le n\u0101n\u0101-pupph\u0101ni gahetv\u0101 pupphacumbatakam katv\u0101,\u201d etc. The word is still preserved in the Mah\u0101r\u0101thi, where *cumbala* or *cumbala* means a circlet or ring of cloth, to be put on the head under a load to be carried; see Molesworth. *Tiracch\u0101na* (from *tira\u00e7a* + *ana*), an animal, Abhidh\u00e1n. v. 648. *Paccedita*, see \u201cFive J\u0101takas,\u201d p. 23. *Vattaka*, S. vartaka, a sort of quail, Wilson. *Vassita*, S. v\u0101cita, Abhidh\u00e1n. v. 130. *Madd*, S. mard (mrd); see Bohtl. and Roth\u2019s S.W. *Pacchi* means, according to Abhidh\u00e1n. v. 524. a basket. I am at a loss to find a corresponding Sanscrit word. In elucidation thereof, I quote the following passages, J\u0101taka 78: mah\u0101jano pacchisambhak\u0101d\u012bni gahetv\u0101 gehadv\u0101re sannipati. J. 368: attte B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asiyam Brahmatte rajjam k\u0101rento Bodhisatto p\u0101r\u0101patayoniya\u1e41 nibbatitv\u0101 B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi-setthino mah\u0101n\u0101se m\u0101lapaciya\u1e41 vasati. J. 381: kapp\u0101sakhetta\u1e41 pacchip\u016bra\u1e41 kapp\u0101s\u0101p ad\u0101ya. J. 5: handa d\u0101ni tvam eva sal\u0101ka dehi\u1e6di sal\u0101k\u0101paechin adamsu. *Vikkhi\u1e47tv\u0101*, one would expect *vikkhipitv\u0101*, but it is almost always written with a short *i*, so I dare not alter it. *Mila*, Abhidh\u00e1n. vv. 471, 851. *Jieikam*, the MS. reads *jieitam*. *Kappeti*, from kapp, S. kalp (klrp), Clough, P\u0101li Verbs, p. 4. *Sakkhisati*, the future tense of sak, S. \u00e7ak; see \u201cFive J\u0101t.\u201d p. 27. *Gumba*, Abhidh\u00e1n. vv. 550, 861, S. gulma for gumla; compare P\u0101li amba = S. \u00e1ma, \u201cFive J\u0101t.\u201d p. 21. *Upari j\u0101le khitte*, so I have corrected in accordance with the above phrase: upari j\u0101le khittamatte; the MS. has j\u00e1lamkhitte, perhaps it would also do to alter this only to j\u00e1lakhitte. *Punadive-sato patth\u0101ya*, etc., there must here be some corruption of the text. I suppose, as Prof. Westerg has suggested to me, that the words I\nhave put between brackets have been repeated by a mistake of the transcribers. *Sammodam\u00e1no*, rejoicing together, agreeing, living in harmony; compare Burnouf's Lotus, p. 316, where *sammodam\u00e1no* is explained by *avivadam\u00e1no*, not disputing, not quarrelling. In elucidation of these two verbs, I quote the following verses from J. 467:\n\n```\nIcc-eva phandano isam\niso ca pana phandanam\nam\u00f1amamp\u00f1am viv\u00e1dena\nam\u00f1amamp\u00f1am agh\u00e1tayum.\nEvam eva manussesu\nviv\u00e1do yatha j\u00e1yati\nmay\u00faranaccam naocanti\nyath\u00e1 no isaphandan\u00e1.\nTam vo vad\u00e1mi bhaddam vo,\ny\u00e1vant' ettha sam\u00e1gat\u00e1\nsammodatha m\u00e1 vivadittha\nm\u00e1 hotha isaphandan\u00e1.\n```\n\n*Sabbev\u00e1dd\u00e1ya*, I suppose, must be dissolved into sabbe eva \u00e1d\u00e1ya, and therefore written sabbe v\u00e9d\u00e1ya, as the commentary has *to gahetad*. *Eh\u00ednti*, see Dhammapadam, p. 369. *Katip\u00e1ha*, see \"Five J\u00e1t.\" p. 26. *V\u00e9d\u00e1ka*, I think the transcriber must here have made a mistake, and that we are to read: *viv\u00e9dakassu*. *S\u00f3thi*, see Dhpd. p. 363. *Bhariyam h\u00e1dayam\u00e1no*, the MS. has h\u00e1sm\u00e1no. *Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1* I suppose to be a mistake of the transcriber, instead of *mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1no*, as at the beginning of the J\u00e1taka. *Anusandhim gh\u00e1tetva* occurs often at the end of a story in the same connexion as here, but as yet I have not been able to make out the meaning of this phrase. . I suppose, however, it means something like making application, bringing the story told to bear upon the then existing circumstances. *Samodhdnessi*, see \"Five J\u00e1t.\" p. 30.\n\n---\n\n**201.

Kurungamigaj\u0101takam.\n\n\"Therefore the leathern trap.\" This the Master related, while living at Veluvana, in reference to Devadatta. For at that time the Master, having heard that Devadatta endeavoured to kill (him, said,) bhikkhus, not only now Devadatta endeavours to kill me, (but) also formerly he endeavoured (to do so, and) so having said he told a story:\n\nIn (times) past, while Brahmadatta reigned in B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi,\nBodhisatta, having become a Kurunga-deer, took up (his) abode in the wood, in a thicket not far from a lake. At the top of a tree not far from that lake sat a Woodpecker, and in the lake there lived a Tortoise. Thus those three companions lived pleasantly together. Then a Deer-hunter, roaming in the wood, having seen Bodhisatta\u2019s footmarks near a water-pool, (and) having placed a trap made of leather (thongs, and as strong) as an iron-chain, went (his way). Bodhisatta, having come to drink water, (and being) caught in the trap during the first watch (of the night), shrieked (frantically) as a prisoner. At his shriek the Woodpecker, coming down from the top of the tree, and the Tortoise out of the water, consulted (together, saying) what is to be done? Then the Woodpecker, addressing the Tortoise (said), \u201cFriend, you have teeth, cut this trap; I will go and manage (it so) that he shall not come; thus by the efforts made by us two our companion will obtain life;\u201d (and) explaining this matter (he) pronounced the first stanza:\n\n1. \u201cTherefore the leathern trap\n   Cut with thy teeth, O Tortoise!\n   I will manage (it) so\n   That the Hunter shall not come,\u201d\n\nThe Tortoise began to gnaw at the leather-thongs. The Woodpecker went to the village where the Hunter dwelt. The Hunter at dawn, having taken (his) hunting-knife, went out. The Bird, perceiving that he was about to go out, shrieked aloud, shaking (his) wings, and struck him in the face when he was going out at the front-door. The Hunter (said to himself), \u201cI have been struck by a bird of bad omen,\u201d (and) so (saying) he returned, lay down a little (while), and then got up again and took (his) knife. The Bird (thought), \u201cthis (man) went out the first (time) by the front-door, now he will go out by the back-door,\u201d (and) seeing this he went and sat down at the back-door. But the Hunter thought, \u201cwhen I went out by the front-door, I saw a bird of bad omen, now I will go out at the back-door,\u201d (and) so (thinking) he went out by the back-door. The Bird again shrieking aloud went and struck (him) in the face. The\nHunter, again struck by the bird of bad omen, (thought), \"this (bird) will not allow me to go out,\" (and) so returning he lay down until daybreak, and (then) at the dawn of morning took (his) knife and went out. The Bird went away hastily, and told Bodhisatta that the Hunter was coming. At this moment, with the exception of one thong, the other thongs had been cut by the Tortoise. But his teeth looked as if they were going to fall out, (and his) mouth was soiled with blood. Bodhisatta, seeing that the Hunter had taken (his) knife, and was coming on with the speed of lightning, burst that thong and entered the wood. The Bird (now) set himself on the top of a tree. But the Tortoise from weakness lay down there. The Hunter, after throwing the Tortoise into (his) bag, fastened (it) to a post. Bodhisatta, on (his) return, seeing (what had taken place) and knowing that the Tortoise had been caught (thought), \"I will preserve (my) companion's life,\" (and) so, feigning to be weak, he appeared before the Hunter. He (thought), \"this (deer) must be weak, I will kill him,\" (and) so, taking (his) knife, he followed (him). Bodhisatta, neither going very far (away) nor very near, entered the wood, taking him (with him). (But) when he knew that he had gone a great distance he changed his pace and went (back) with the rapidity of the wind another way, (and) when he had thrown up the bag into the air, with (his) horn, and let it fall and be torn on the ground, he drew out the Tortoise. The Woodpecker descended from the tree. (Then) Bodhisatta said admonishingly to the two (others), \"I got life through you; by you has been done unto me what ought to be done to a companion; now when the Hunter comes he will seize you, therefore, friend Woodpecker! take your children and go to another (place), and you, friend Tortoise! go into the water.\" They did so. The Master having become enlightened, pronounced the second stanza:\n\n2. \"The Tortoise went into the water,\n   The Deer entered the wood,\n   The Woodpecker from the top of the tree\n   Carried (his) children far away.\"\nThe Hunter coming (back) to that place, (and) not seeing any one, took (his) torn sack and went to his house, seized with distress. The three companions, on the other hand, without breaking off (their mutual) confidence during life, (at last) passed (away) according to (their) deeds.\n\nThe Master having given this moral instruction, wound up the J\u0101taka thus: \"At that time the Hunter was Devadatta, the Woodpecker S\u0101riputta, the Tortoise Moggall\u0101na, but the Kurunga-deer (was) myself.\" The Kurungadeer-Birth.\n\nNOTES ON JATAKA 201.\n\n*J\u0101gha*, see Abhidh\u0101n. v. 1157 (codane) and Clough's Pali Gram. p. 72. *Vaddha*, S. vardhra. *Parisa\u1e45kati*, compare Dhammapadam p. 331. *Kurunga*, S. kura\u1e45ga. *Gumba*, see note on J\u0101t. 38. *Satapatta*, S. \u00e7a\u1e6dapatra. *Luddaka*, see Five J\u0101t. p. 38. *Padava-la\u1e45ja* I think to be the correctest form of this word, but it is sometimes written padavala\u1e45ja, compare Preface to Dhpd. p. viii.; in this place B has vala\u1e45cha, and C vala\u1e45cha.

II.\u2014On an Ancient Buddhist Inscription at Keu-yung kwan, in North China. By A. Wylie.\n\nTravellers from the city of Peking to the town of Kalgan on the great wall of China, must make the journey by the rugged defile known as the Nankow Pass. Five miles north of the entrance, where the village of Nankow stands, is the smaller village of Keu-yung kwan. Fortifications there run up the steep slopes of the mountains on both sides of the valley; and besides arched gateways at the two ends of the village, the highway passes under a limestone archway of a much more striking appearance. This is covered with mythological and symbolic sculptures of obviously Indian origin. The tradition of the natives in the neighbourhood asserts it to have been the basement story of a pagoda which stood there; and the name by which it is still designated, \u904e\u8857\u5854 Kw\u014d keas t'a, \"Pagoda crossing the street,\" bears out the statement. We are told that this pagoda, though erected for the benefit of the locality, proved an object of such terror to the superstitious Mongols, coming south from their native wilds, that they could not be induced to pass under the ominous-looking structure; and thus it was found necessary in the early part of the Ming dynasty, to remove the upper stories of the erection; the policy of the government being to conciliate and attract these wild nomades.\n\nKeu-yung kwan was once a place of much greater pretension and importance than it is at present; and it can boast of historical memories of considerable interest; not the least being the fact that there Genghis khan was successfully resisted in his attempts to force the pass.\n\nSeveral Europeans who have passed that way, have noticed the village and the archway, in recounting their travels. Father Gerbillon, who was there on his way to Mongolia in 1688, says\u2014\"The village might pass for a little town. The\ngate by which it is entered is very like a triumphal arch. It is all marble, and about thirty feet thick, with figures in half relief up to the spring of the arch.\"\u00b9 The same father, returning that way in the suite of the emperor in 1697, remarks:\u2014\"The heir apparent, accompanied by five of his brothers, and some magnates of the empire who had remained at Peking, came to meet the emperor in the middle of the Pass, in a village, named Kiu yium quan, where they remained some time.\"\u00b2 Bell of Antermony, who accompanied the Russian embassy to Peking in 1720, speaks of it as the town of Zulin guang, where he says they passed the night of November 15th.\u00b3 Timkowski, who headed a similar embassy in 1820, speaks thus of the place:\u2014\"Here the road begins to be very difficult, especially for carriages, and does not change for a distance of about five verst, as far as the fort of Kiu young (kouan), the principal defence of this passage. The interior of the middle gate is ornamented with figures of heros sculptured on the walls.\"\u2074\n\nNone of the preceding writers however, nor others who had been there, seem to have thought it worth while to direct attention to the inscription which is found on this archway; and the first notice of it brought before the European public, so far as I am aware, was in a paper by myself, published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1860.\u2075 I had found it registered in a Chinese work on stone inscriptions, published towards the close of last century.\u2076\n\nWhile on my return from England to China, via Siberia and Mongolia, in 1863, I first saw this arch.\u2077 At that time\n\n\u00b9 Du Halde. \"Description G\u00e9ographique, Historique, Chronologique, Politique, et Physique de la Chine, etc.\" Hague.

J. Edkins, of Peking, in anticipation of my arrival,\nI could only succeed in getting an impression on paper of a portion of the inscription on the west side of the archway; which was exhibited at the first meeting of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at Shanghai, in 1864. A short paper on the same was published in the Society's Journal for that year.\\(^1\\)\n\nhad come to the Mongolian plateau to meet me, but being a fortnight too early, he left a note for me at Kalgan, which, however, I never received. In that note he called my attention to the inscription on the arch, which he had observed in passing.\n\nAn engraving of the arch has recently been published by Professor Pompelli, who saw it in the spring of 1863. In his new work, \"Across America and Asia,\" he thus describes the place:\u2014\u201cThe next morning, leaving the plain, we entered the narrow valley, winding for several miles through a desolate gorge, enclosed by lofty walls and yellow cliffs of limestone. The mountain torrent, which at certain seasons dashes wildly through the valley, makes the construction of a durable road almost impossible, and it was only with difficulty, and with faith in the sure feet of our horses, that we managed slowly to pick our way through the long and narrow valley of sharp-edged boulders and masses of fallen rock. After several miles of this work we came to a point where the remains of an ancient road rising some distance above the bed of the valley was preserved along the mountain side. Ascending this by a long flight of steps, of highly polished blocks of limestone, granite, and porphyry, we passed through a gateway in an inner branch of the great wall, and came soon after to a beautiful white marble arch built during the Chin dynasty. This structure is remarkable from the fact that while its blocks are cut for a circular arch, the inner surfaces are hewn to produce a ceiling of semi-hexagonal form. It is interesting also to the student of the Chinese language, from the fact that the interior contains inscriptions in an ancient Chinese character. As Dr. Pogojeff wished to photograph this monument, we remained here till the next day, etc.\u201d\n\nIn the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, vol. ii. p. 190, are the following remarks in the journal of a missionary lady who lately passed Keu-yung kwan on her way to Kalgan:\u2014\u201cThe inner line of the great wall is at the entrance to the Nankho, and three or four branches cross it. We passed through ten gateways. These are double, as is customary with cities. The wall is dilapidated in some places, but the gateways are all solidly built, and in good repair. One was very fine, having much carved work, and inscriptions in six different languages. One of these European scholars cannot read.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, New series, No. 1, pp. 138\u2013136.\nAs there stated, the inscription is engraved in the characters of six different nations, and covers the greater part of the inner facing of the structure on both sides, from the basement to the spring of the arch. Two of the parts are inscribed in horizontal lines at the top, in antique Devanagari and Tibetan characters respectively, twenty feet long on each wall. Below these are four compartments inscribed respectively in Mongol, Onigour, Neuchih and Chinese characters, all in vertical lines.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, when on a visit to the north of China, I succeeded in completing my impression of the four last-named parts of the inscription, but could not get the Sanscrit and Tibetan portions, on account of their great height from the ground. At a subsequent period, however, these were procured by Mr. Edkins, and he has kindly sent me a hand tracing by a Chinese, from his impression.\n\nIt will be seen that the great interest of this inscription is the large and correct specimen it offers of the Neuchih character, the national writing of the Kin dynasty Tartars, the knowledge of which is now absolutely lost in China, and very few specimens are known to exist or to be accessible.\n\nThe great age of this piece of art however,\u2014more than five centuries,\u2014taken into consideration, it is not surprising that it has suffered much from various causes; large portions of the stone have dropped out in many places; the surface, especially towards the base, is much chipped and defaced, and in some places the characters have become so filled up with hard matter, as scarcely to give any legible impression on the paper. The numerous lacun\u00e6 thus produced form the chief difficulty in the decipherment.\n\nA slight comparison of the different parts was sufficient to show that they were all transcripts of a Sanscrit original. On the eastern wall the correspondence for the greater part is tolerably close throughout. That on the western side is much less regular, no one version being the exact counterpart of any other, gaps and redundancies occurring in many places, especially in the latter part.\n\nThe present paper then will be occupied specially with the\neastern side of the archway, leaving the opposite one as a subject for future investigation; as I find each side is complete in itself.\n\nOutside the original inscription, there is an intimation in smaller Chinese characters, on the right-hand border, towards the top, to the effect that the structure was \"repaired with funds given by the meritorious and believing official Lin P'oo-heen, on the 15th day of the 5th month of the year 1445.\" It is to be noticed, that this is exactly a century after the date of the original inscription, 1345, which by a singular accident is preserved, in a line where little else is legible.\n\nAs the Chinese characters were more easily intelligible to me than any of the others, and consequently promised the readiest key to the mystery, I naturally turned to that part of the inscription first. Unfortunately I found it specially faulty and illegible; and it was necessary to supply large lacun\u00e6 by analogy, and with the aid derivable from the transcripts in the other characters. There are twenty-one columns of large characters, which are succeeded by twenty columns of a smaller size; and with the exception of the Sanscrit, which consists entirely of large characters, all the other compartments have, like the Chinese, part in large characters and part in small. Of the large character portion, which it was at once obvious was a mere transcript of Sanscrit sounds, I have lately found another rendering in a Chinese ritual, the \u7985\u9580\u65e5\u8aa6 Shen mun jih sung, \"Daily recitations of the Shen sect,\"\u00b9 in which it is spelt out with a set of characters differing almost entirely from those on the inscription; so that it is only by the phonetic approximation that the identity can be detected. The title of the piece, as given in the ritual,\u2014but omitted in the inscription,\u2014is \u4f5b\u9802\u5c0a\u52dd\u5927\u9640\u7f85\u5c3c Fuh ting tsun shing ta to lo ne, \"Great dh\u0101ran\u012b of the honoured diadem on Buddha's cranium.\"\u00b2 It may be remarked that in every instance where a\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Edkins identifies the Shen sect with the Jains of India.\n\u00b2 In another ritual, the \u745c\u4f3d\u7130\u53e3 Yu kee yen kow, \"Flaming mouths of the Yoga,\" in the possession of W. Lockhart,\ncompound character is used in the Sanscrit,\u2014and such instances are very numerous,\u2014the same is expressed by two Chinese characters in the column, followed by two smaller ones, \u4e8c\u5408 urh h\u014d, \"two combined,\" placed horizontally. This practice is invariable, both in the inscription and in the ritual. The copy in the ritual is marked off by stops, into words or clauses throughout. By the discovery of this duplicate, I have been enabled to fill up the gaps in the Chinese part of the inscription almost without the chance of error.\n\nHaving ascertained that all the different portions were transcripts or transliterations of a Sanscrit original, the importance of restoring and analyzing this original was apparent; and for this purpose I have turned to account the tracing sent to me by Mr. Edkins. This consists of five horizontal lines of characters, each two inches in depth and twenty feet in length. Besides being in an obsolete form of the Devanagari, the Chinese copyist, as might be expected, has made numerous errors in his endeavours to extricate the complex characters from the half-obiterated legend on the stone. So great was the confusion thus produced, that it would have been hopeless for any but a Sanscrit scholar to have succeeded in restoring the half-obscured forms. At this stage I was under obligation to Dr. E. Haas, of the British Museum, who kindly identified the greater number of the characters for me. Having this clue to start with, by a comparison of the several transcripts, I was able to make an approximate restoration of the whole, and wrote out the same in English letters. Being in G\u00f6ttingen shortly after, I showed this transcript to Professor Benfey, who readily gave me a partial translation, and pointed out many errors in the proposed restoration; although a failure of eyesight, from which he was at the time suffering, prevented him entering so minutely into the details, as he otherwise would willingly have done.

A few places, and only a few, have persistently refused to submit to the rigour of grammatical laws; and it is not surprising, in the case of a dead language being traditionally preserved for centuries among a people by whom it is not understood, that a few errors should creep in. It is rather to be wondered at, and indicates a remarkable veneration for the sounds of the sacred language, that the text as preserved should be able to give out such a complete and intelligible meaning.\n\nTRANSLITERATION.\u00b9\n\nOm namo bhagavate savvatailokyasprativisht\u0101ya buddh\u0101ya te namah tadyath\u0101 om bh\u016br om bh\u016br om sodhaya visodhaya visodhayasama samant\u0101vabhaddevarana gatigaganasvabh\u0101vavi\u1e63uddhe abhi\u015binchena\u00b2 tu m\u0101\u1e43 savatath\u0101gata sugata varavachan\u0101m\u0101rit\u0101bhisekair mah\u0101mudr\u0101\u00b3 mantrapadai\u1e25 \u0101hara \u0101hara mam\u0101yu\u1e25 sant\u0101ra\u1e47i sodhaya visodhaya visodhaya gaganasvabh\u0101vavi\u1e63uddhe ushnishavijayapari\u1e63uddhe sahasarasa\u1e43s\u0101mpchodito savatath\u0101gatavalokini \u015batp\u0101ramit\u0101parip\u016br\u1e47a\u1e25 savatath\u0101gata\u015bat\u0101d\u0101sa\u00f1\u0101hi\u1e63\u1e6dhite savatath\u0101gata\u015bat\u0101day\u0101dh\u012bhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101dh\u012bhi\u1e63\u1e6dhite mudre mudre mah\u0101mudravejyak\u0101ya\u015bamhatanapari\u1e63uddhe savakarm\u0101vara\u1e47avi\u1e63uddhe pratinvartaya mam\u0101yu\u1e25 vi\u1e63uddhe savatath\u0101gatasamay\u0101dh\u012bhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101dh\u012bhi\u1e63\u1e6dhite om muni muni mah\u0101muni vimuni vimuni mah\u0101vimuni\u2074 mati mati mah\u0101mati mamati\u2075 sumatit\u0101t\u0101bh\u016bte kotipari\u1e63uddhe visbudabuddhi\u1e63uddhe\u2076 he he jaya jaya vijaya vijaya samara\n\n\u00b9 The italics represent the restorations, which are illegible in the Sanscrit.\n\u00b2 Dr. Haas corrects this to abhi\u015binches.\n\u00b3 Dr. Haas adds m here.\n\u2074 Dr. Haas thinks the inscription is in error here, and that the preceding six words should end in ne instead of ni.\n\u2075 Dr. Haas thinks this word should be mah\u0101mati.\n\u2076 I understand that sva is an impossible combination in Sanscrit; and although the Sanscrit character is missing on the stone, yet the several transcripts in the other characters are so distinct that I do not feel at liberty to abandon it.

Suffice it to say that, according to the general definition, they are certain mystical formul\u00e6, supposed to carry with them a magical influence in the recitation, and this influence is not simply dependent on their utterance as a whole, but is supposed to be inherent in the single words, and even in the separate letters of the forms. In a system where all the objects of sense are but so many ideas in a world of unreality, words constitute not merely names, but the actual essence of the things named; and the possession of the name is consequently the possession of the object. This may account for the incoherent and almost meaningless ejaculations observable throughout the inscription; and it is but a refinement of the same notion to attribute a similar virtue to the elements of which the words are made up. From words and letters, the same occult efficacy was transferred to symbols made by a particular placing of the fingers, which is called mudr\u0101, or \"the seal,\" and this appears to be personified here as an object of adoration.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe above translation seems to be tolerably near the meaning of the text; and although after every effort at reconstruction, a few grammatical solecisms still remain, yet I believe there are very few places now, where the original syllables are not correctly restored. It is indeed interesting to have an exact interpretation of the text; but the main thing for our present purpose, is to identify the vocables without error; and when once assured of the powers of the Sanscrit characters, we can proceed with confidence to the analysis and restoration of the several transliterations.\n\nThe dh\u0101rani concludes near the end of the fourth line on the stone, thus:\u2014\"with the words of mystic prayers (mantra). Sodh\u0101.\" The doxology that follows is only found in one of the transliterations. From the remarks of Burnouf on the subject,\\(^2\\) I am inclined to think that this concluding piece is the mantra alluded to in the final sentence of the dh\u0101rani.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Vassilief's \"Le Bouddisme,\" translated by La Comme, p. 141, passim.\n\n\\(^2\\) Introduction \u00e0 l'histoire du Bouddhisme Indien, p. 540.\nIt may be remarked that the invocation Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101, by which the Chinese and three of the others commence, is omitted in the Sanscrit.\n\nImmediately below the Sanscrit text is the transcript in three horizontal lines of Tibetan characters, below which are four lines of Tibetan in smaller characters. The Tibetan character being a direct derivative from the Devanagari,\u00b9 it might be expected that this would prove the most important of the transcripts for identifying the original text. Unfortunately however, the breaks in the face of the stone are so extensive, that not much more than half of the writing is preserved; and the indistinctness of that, probably, has led the copyist into so many errors and omissions, that the tracing serves for little more than mere hints; but it may in great part be corrected by the other transcripts. This contains the introductory invocation Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101, and the dh\u0101ran\u012b occupies about two lines and a third; the remaining portion being totally different from the Sanscrit, though it is evidently Sanscrit also.\n\nThe first of the vertical portions below the preceding, beginning from the left hand, is in that form of the Mongol known as the B\u0101shpah\u00b2 alphabet. This consists of twenty lines in large characters, the lines succeeding from left to right; which are followed by eight lines of Mongolian in a smaller character. The transcript commences with the invocation Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101, and contains the whole of the dh\u0101ran\u012b, but nothing additional.\n\nAlthough the history of this alphabet and writing is dis-\n\n\u00b9 The Tibetan characters were invented by Thumi Sambhota, the Prime Minister of Srongtsan Gampo, King of Tibet, from the Devanagari alphabet, about the middle of the seventh century.\u2014Schlagintweit. Buddhism in Tibet, p. 65.\n\n\u00b2 This is a Sanscrit name \u092c\u093e\u0936\u094d\u092a: B\u0101shpah, which is transferred into Chinese by the characters \u516b\u601d\u5df4 Pa-sse-pa and \u5e15\u514b\u65af\u5df4 Pa-lth-sse-pa. Pallas writes the name Pagba. Remusat gives it Phaspa, Paspa, B\u0101shpah, and Pa-sse-pa, in different places of his Recherches sur les langues Tartares. Klaproth uses Bh\u0101chbah, as the Tibetan transcript of the original Sanscrit. Pauthier uses Pa-\nsse-pa.\ntinctly related in the Chinese annals, yet its actual existence seems, up to a very recent period, to have been a matter of doubt with European writers.\n\nChinese history tells us that the emperor Kubla commissioned the Tibetan lama Bashpah to construct an alphabet or syllabary specially adapted to the Mongol language. His task was completed, and the alphabet initiated for public use by an imperial decree in 1269. Schools for the study of this character were also instituted the same year. Several notices on record lead us to believe that the Chinese never took willingly to the use of this alphabet; but there is no doubt it was the official writing during the Yuen dynasty; and it appears to be the one known as the Mongolian character in the Chinese records of that period.\n\nPallas gives the same account of Bashpah's invention,\\(^1\\) derived apparently from a Mongol source; and the last plate in his work contains what he calls a specimen of Bashpah's square character,\\(^2\\) but he does not tell us where he got it. That plate has been repeatedly quoted as the first specimen of Bashpah's alphabet published in Europe; but I am very doubtful if Bashpah had anything to do with the character there given,\\(^3\\) or if Pallas had ever seen the writing invented\n\n\\(^1\\) Sammlungen historischer Nachrichten \u00fcber die Mongolischen V\u00f6lkerschaften, vol. ii, p. 358.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. vol. ii. plate 92.\n\n\\(^3\\) When on a visit to the great lamasary Yung-ho-kung, in Peking, I observed in one of the temples a pall inscribed in the common Tibetan character, with a horizontal heading in a character which was unknown to me. I thought it of sufficient interest to take a copy of it, which I give here:\n\n```\nom a d e i l u b o o k k h n g c h c h g n t t h n\np p h m y r l b v j s y a g d a d w a h h b\nr i r l i l l k r\n```\n\nSubsequently, when I saw Pallas' work for the first time, I was surprised to find my copy almost identical with his plate, except\nby that celebrated lama; for it will be observed that all the known examples resemble much more closely the common Tibetan character, than does that of Pallas, which is evidently a modification of the Scharr form.\n\nIn the Appendix to Courtin's \"Encyclop\u00e9die Moderne,\" Klaproth, in an article on \"Grammaire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\" gives an alphabet which he calls \"Square Landsha,\" being nearer in resemblance to B\u0101shpah's than the preceding; but though some have taken it to be identical with his invention, I do not believe there is any direct connection between the two.\n\nSchmidt seems to ignore the existence of a separate alphabet under the name of B\u0101shpah, as having been ever used among the Mongols.\n\nRemusat says this alphabet was never used out of Tibet, notwithstanding the reiterated orders of the emperors. He promises to give an exemplar of the alphabet in his second volume, from the Suh hung keen lub, together with some explanatory details; but the second volume never appeared. Never having seen an instance of the employment of this character, he seems to have been unable to divest himself of the idea, that the invention of B\u0101shpah was nothing more than the application to the Mongolian language, of the common characters used by the Tibetans at the present day. That hypothesis however is totally refuted by the present inscription, where we have the Tibetan portion in the identical character used by that people now, and the Mongol portion in the B\u0101shpah character.\n\nKlaproth, while arguing for this writing having been used in China, says there are a great many medals of Kubla khan in existence, of which the legend is entirely or in part in the\n\nthat he gives an additional portion at the beginning and end; but he gives no explanation of what are the characters. I conclude, from examination, that they are simply the alphabet, and have identified the greater number with tolerable probability; believing that the additional ones given by Pallas are compounds.\n\n1 Plate 7.\n2 Forschungen im Gebiete der \u00e4lteren religi\u00f6sen, politischen, und literarischen Bildungsgeschichte der V\u00f6lker Mittel Asiens.\n3 Recherches sur les langues Tartares, p. 193.\nsquare characters.\u00b9 These seem to be the only evidence that he was able to adduce of the use of this character in China. While I think it very doubtful however, whether there be any such medals of the reign of Kubla, it is very easy to understand how Klaproth should have been led into such a mistake. I have never seen any, or a description of any in Chinese books on medals; but I have a number of coins in the B\u0101shpah character, dating at various periods from 1308 to 1354.\n\nI have seen several stone slabs inscribed with this character, and notices of a good many more, the present one dating so late as 1345. In 1307, it is recorded that Polo Timor, a high dignitary, presented to the emperor a copy of the Heaou king, or \u201cBook of Filial piety,\u201d written in the B\u0101shpah character, which the monarch ordered to be printed and circulated. I am only aware of one little book in that character having survived to the present day, i.e. the Pih kea sing, or \u201cBook of Surnames,\u201d which has been preserved by being reprinted in the King chuen pae peen, a work in 120 books, published in 1581, consisting of extracts from other works on every class of subjects. The eighty-first book is occupied exclusively with the reprint of the Pih kea sing; but so unmercifully mutilated are the characters, that without the Chinese key, it would have been an utter impossibility to have deciphered them. These facts then leave little doubt that this character was used to a considerable extent in China, till near the end of the Yuen dynasty.\n\nIn 1838, H. Conon von Gabelentz published the first specimen in Europe, of the actual employment of the character.\u00b2 This was an inscription in the Mongolian language, which he had extracted from a reprint of the Shih mih tsuen hwa, a Chinese work on lapidary inscriptions, first published in 1618.\n\nA silver plate with a gilt inscription in this same character, was found in 1846, in the district of Minusinsk and govern-\n\n\u00b9 M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019Asie, tome ii.\n\u00b2 Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. ii. p. 1, etc.\nment of Jenissei, in Eastern Siberia. This was deposited in the Asiatic Museum of the Academy of Sciences at Petersburg; and gave rise to a protracted controversy in various periodicals between Messrs. Habakkuk, Grigorief, Hyacinth, Schmidt, Schott, and Banzarof. Mr. Grigorief published a facsimile and an essay on the subject, in the Journal of the Administration of the Interior.\n\nAn edict in honour of Confucius published by the emperor Woo-tsong on his accession in 1307, was engraved in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese and Bashpah Mongol characters. An impression of the same is preserved in the Asiatic Museum at Petersburg, and a copy of it was given by Father Hyacinth in his work on the statistics of the Chinese empire.\n\nIn 1853, another silver plate, with an inscription similar to the preceding, was discovered at Verchni Udinsk, to the east of Lake Baikal; and is now preserved in the Hermitage Palace in Petersburg. An account of this was given by Mr. Sav\u00e9lief in the fifth volume of the Transactions of the Archaeological Society at Petersburg. These plates seem to have been signets given to military envoys, and those holding imperial commissions.\n\nIn an article on Sanscrit and Mongolian characters by Mr. Edkins, published in 1855, he has given a facsimile reproduction of the Pth kea sing, from the King chuen pae peen.\n\nWithout knowing anything of what had been done by Von Gabelentz and the Russian orientalists, I chanced one day during the occupation of Shanghae city by the Triad rebels in 1854, to notice in the Confucian temple, an inscription in this character, which proved to be a transcript\n\n---\n\n1 Journal Asiatique, 5\u00b0 serie, pp. 527-558.\n2 Ibid. p. 526.\n3 Ibid. pp. 527-558.\n4 Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, part v. pp. 101-108 and 5 plates.\n5 The Confucian temple was afterwards burnt down, and this slab was broken and otherwise injured by the fire. When Shanghae was retaken by the imperialists, the temple was rebuilt in another part of the city, and most of the old tablets found a place in the\nof an edict by Kubla khan, the Chinese original of which was engraved below it. At some risk and trouble I procured a few impressions from this stone, and sent one of them, through Sir John Bowring, to the Royal Asiatic Society in London, where it still remains. A short article on the subject, by myself, appeared in the \"Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\"\u00b9 for 1855, giving a copy of the inscription in the Mongol and Chinese characters, and also cuts of several coins of the Yuen dynasty.\u00b2 There is also a restoration of the commencement of the Pth kee sing noticed above.\n\nIn 1860, M. Pauthier gave a French translation of the inscription which I had published in the Hongkong Transactions. This appeared in the Journal Asiatique,\u00b3 together with some interesting details on the Bashpah alphabet.\n\nThe same year a very neat fount of type for this character was cast at the Imprimerie Imp\u00e9riale at Paris, under the instructions of M. Pauthier.\n\nAn article which I had written on the Mongolian inscrip-\n\nnew erection. This place was afterwards used as a lodging for the British officers during the military occupation of that city; and in their little arrangements to make things comfortable, all the inscribed tablets in the walls had been covered with plaster and whitewash. The Mongolian slab I could never find again, and on a visit to the place in company with Dr. Lamprey, he told me he had seen the stone in question used as a block for chopping on.\n\n\u00b9 Part v. pp. 65-81.\n\u00b2 I may be allowed here to notice some confusion that has taken place in the printing of that article. The cut of the coin to note || on page 55 is erroneously placed as note * on page 58. The note marked || at the foot of page 55 should be referred to the word Pth, in the third line of page 56. The Mongol letter p, placed on its side, thus ||, on page 64, should be ||. The four Mongol characters at the top of page 65 are upside down. Engravings of some of these coins may be seen in an article by C. B. Hillier, on \"Chinese Coinage,\" in the Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, part ii., 1848-50, pp. 105-110; also in the works of De Chaudoir, Endlicher, and others, on Chinese numismatics. A special article by Pauthier, on one of these coins, appeared in the Journal Asiatique, 5me. serie, tom. xv. pp. 321-337, 1860.\n\u00b3 Vol. xix. pp. 5-47.\ntion, translated and published by Von Gabelentz, in the \"Zeitschrift,\" was translated into French by M. Pauthier, and appeared in the Journal Asiatique for 1862.\n\nBoth this inscription and the edict of Kubla were reproduced with the new type, in the Appendix to Pauthier's splendid edition of Marco Polo.\n\nThe vertical portion to the right of the Mongol is in the Ouigour character, consisting of twenty lines in a large type and twelve in a smaller. The large character part corresponds almost literally throughout with the Sanscrit. There is no initial invocation, and the doxology at the end of the dh\u0101ran\u012b is a transcript of the Sanscrit, with one slight deviation.\n\nThe Ouigour branch of the Turkish race seem to have been in close proximity and intercourse with the Mongols during the Yuen dynasty. They are reported to have been in possession of an alphabet and literature from an unknown antiquity; and scholars are divided in their opinions as to the origin of their written character. The Syriac, the Sabean, and the Zend, have each been proposed as the most probable source whence derived. The earliest mention of Ouigour literature is to be found in the Chinese records, about the middle of the fifth century, at which time we are informed, that they possessed in their language Maou's \"Book of Odes,\" the \"Confucian Analects,\" and the \"Book of Filial piety,\" besides some Poets and Historians.\n\nIn giving an analysis of a catalogue of Buddhist works, published in China in 1306, Professor Julien makes the following interesting remarks, bearing on Ouigour literature:\n\n\"The last preface dated in 1306, gives the names of twenty-nine savans versed in the Tibetan, Ouigour, Sanscrit, and Chinese languages, who were charged, as appears by the\n\n1 Vol. xix. pp. 461-471.\n2 Remusat, Recherches sur les langues Tartares, p. 29, passim.\n3 Klaproth, Abhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren, p. 53.\n4 Davids, Grammaire Turke, p. xvi.\n5 Remusat, Recherches, etc. p. 284.\npreface of 1289, to compare the texts with each other, to collate the translations, and to revise and fix them definitively for the general reimpresion. Their work, begun in 1285, was finished in 1287. Among these savans, we observe a Buddhist priest from Tourfan, versed in the knowledge of every branch of the sacred literature, who was charged by imperial order to verify the Indian words, and an academician, named To-in-tou-tong, who was commissioned to translate the Ouigour words. An extremely curious fact, unknown hitherto, seems to result from the last-named fact, that is, that the greater part of the Buddhist books must have been translated into Ouigour for the use of the subjects of the Chinese empire who spoke that language. This conjecture is fully justified by the following testimony. I read in the history of celebrated Buddhists, published under the Sung in 983, a passage which shows that anciently the Buddhist books were translated, not only in Tibetan and in Chinese, but also in the languages of people now under submission to the Chinese, and whom the latter treated as barbarians:\u2014'When the Sutras and works on discipline from India were taken to Koutch\u00e9, on the north of the Tsung-ling mountains, to L\u00e8ou-lan, to Kharachar, to Khotan, and to Khashgar, the natives not understanding the language of India, the books were translated for them into the barbarian languages which they spoke.' Now several of the above-named countries, which at present form part of Bucharia, were previously occupied by Ouigour tribes, at the epoch when our catalogue was published. Scarcely more than two or three Ouigour manuscripts are known in the great libraries of Europe; should there exist then at Peking any considerable portion of the Buddhist books in this ancient dialect of oriental Turkish, so precious for philology, and so little known, it would be an object of the highest interest, to purchase them there at any price, and to place them within the reach of scholars.\"\n\nOf the very few specimens of the ancient language and\n\n1 M\u00e9langes de G\u00e9ographie Asiatique, pp. 223, 224.\nliterature of the Ouigours known in Europe, the oldest of\nthe manuscripts does not date earlier than the 10th century.\\footnote{David, Grammaire Turke, p. xviii.}\n\nWhen the Mongols under Genghis khan began to attain\ntheir immense power, they were a comparatively unpolished\npeople, and possessed no literature of their own. On the\ndefeat of the Naimans by that nation, Tatatonggo, the secre-\ntary of the Naiman prince, a Ouigour by birth, was made\nprisoner; but was instated by Genghis as Professor of the\nOuigour language and literature, for the benefit of his sub-\njects, the princes and nobles of the Mongol nation.\\footnote{Ibid. p. xviii. Klaproth, Abhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren, pp. 54, 55.}\n\nBeing thus initiated into the literature of the Ouigours, as a matter\nof necessity the Mongols had naturally fallen into the habit\nof using the same character for the purpose of committing\ntheir own language to writing; and this practice continued\nto prevail during the supremacy of Ogdai, Guyu, and Manggu,\nthe three successors of Genghis khan. Ruysbruk, who went\non an embassy to the Mongolian court, from France, in 1258,\nspeaking of the Ouigour characters, says:\u2014\u201cMangu khan has\nsent to your Majesty (St. Louis) letters written in the Mongol\nor Tartar language, but in Ouigour characters.\u201d\\footnote{Klaproth, Abhandlung, etc. p. 56.}\n\nWhen the dynasty took possession of China, under the\nsucceeding monarch, Kubla, and the exigencies of a fixed\ngovernment were more urgent, the inadequacy of the Ouigour\ncharacter fully to express the articulations and vocables of the\nMongol language were felt to be a source of embarrassment.\nAs, it would seem, no man among the Mongols was found to\npossess sufficient philological tact and inventive skill to remedy\nthis inconvenience, the venerable Tibetan lama Saadja Bandida,\nunder special invitation, took up his residence at the\ncourt of Kubla, and applied himself to the task of so modi-\nfying the Ouigour character as to adapt it to the require-\nments of the Mongol. In his scheme, he had retained the\nfourteen Ouigour consonants, but he died while engaged on\nthe work, leaving it still incomplete. The result was, the\nscription now under consideration. As we know that the use of the Ouigour character on these signets was prohibited in 1278, it must have been made previous to that date:\n\nThe portion to the right of the Ouigour is in the Neuchih character, consisting of twenty-seven lines of large size and twenty-one lines of a smaller type. The large character portion is almost a counterpart of the Sanscrit, down to about the middle of the twenty-fifth line, where the dh\u0101rani concludes. It commences with the invocation Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101, the same as the Chinese and others, and the portion following the dh\u0101rani is evidently a doxology, though I have only succeeded in identifying a small portion of it.\n\nAlthough the name of this writing is not unknown to orientalists, yet beyond the name very few facts have been gathered; and this inscription I believe to be unique, not only as giving a correct specimen of the caligraphy, but as being the only piece yet discovered, in which there is any clue to the powers of the characters.\n\nThe Neuchih Tartars succeeded the Tsitans as the dominant power in the north of China, in the early part of the 12th century, under the name of the Kin dynasty. Originally a rude unlettered tribe, they were dependent upon the Chinese and Tsitans for their correspondence and literary negotiations; but they learned to rise with their position, and it was not long ere they began to feel the inconvenience of transacting their diplomacy through interpreters in an alien language. Impressed no doubt with the importance of possessing a national literature, the preliminary necessity of a written character capable of expressing the sounds of their language became apparent. They saw that their predecessors and vanquished rivals, the Tsitans, had been placed at a similar disadvantage at the beginning of their rule, and had invented a character which had been the national writing of the Leaou dynasty for about two hundred years. Following their precedent, Akuta, the founder of the Kin, resolved upon\n\n---\n\n1 I only know of the existence of one inscription in this character, and as there is no translation of it in Chinese or any other language,\nhaving special resources for reducing to writing the language of his tribe; and having among his captives many subjects of the Chinese and also of the Leou, a special study was made of the literature of these two nations. The result was that an imperial commission, consisting of Ouy\u00e9, Moulianho, and Kuhshin, was appointed to form a new set of symbols, from the elements of the Chinese pattern-hand characters, on the same principle as those of the Tsitan, but adapted to the sounds of their national language. In a few months the characters were formed, and an imperial decree issued in the eighth month of the year 1119, ordered their general adoption. In 1138, Ha-tsong, the third emperor, originated a new set of characters for the Neuchih language, and these were named Small Neuchih characters; while those which Kuhshin and his colleagues had invented were termed the Large Neuchih characters. The Small characters were brought into use officially, in the fifth month of the year 1145.\n\nThe Vandalism attendant on the overthrow of dynasties in China, has been especially destructive to the literary productions of the conquered party, and it is scarcely to be expected that many traces of the literary ingenuity of the Neuchih would survive their subjection to another race. A note to the Suh wan keen t'ung k'aoou tells us that the Chinese Classics and Histories were translated in this character; and a catalogue of the imperial library during the Ming gives it remains at present a dead letter. The following five characters are preserved with their interpretation in the Chinese \"Topography of Ching-tih prefecture.\"\n\nAn imperial order; \u652f To run; \u9a6c Horse; \u594f Urgent. The history of the Leou dynasty speaks of an edict having been engraved on stone, in the characters of the Tsitans, Turks, and Chinese, but I am not aware if that inscription is still extant.\n\n1.

Rosny expresses a more hopeful view of the case.\n\nThat the language and literature of the Neuchih did not at once disappear with the extinction of the dynasty we have evidence, for in 1407, when a translatorial institution was established by the Ming, for the purpose of facilitating correspondence with foreign nations, one of the languages to which special attention was directed was the Neuchih. The students were examined periodically, and the most efficient appointed to offices in connection with the embassies. In 1470 seven interpreters were officially designated for the Neuchih language, and the number was afterwards increased to nine. The translatorial office was re-established on the accession of the present dynasty in 1644, with a president and corps of fifty-six professors. Long before this, however, it is probable that the cumbrous Neuchih character had become obsolete, for in the accounts we have of the invention or rather adaptation of the present Manchu character, there is no hint of any kind of writing in existence peculiar to the tribe. The Manchus being the actual descendants of the Kin dynasty Neuchih, there would scarcely be a distinct language, and we consequently find the Neuchih department of the translators' office suppressed in 1659, and the ancient Neuchih character entirely superseded by the modern Manchu.\n\nRemusat, in his \"Recherches sur les langues Tartares,\" has written at greater length on this subject than any other European author, having collected together what few notices he could find in Chinese works; but having never seen a\n\n---\n\n1 He says: \"When the friends of science shall have undertaken scientific journeys, for the purpose of exploring the great public and private libraries of China, libraries whose number is immense, and the preservation of which has been the object of the greatest care and attention, we shall doubtless find the greater part of the literary monuments for which we are now anxious, and a number of others, which will prove so many revelations in the midst of this old Chinese world, whose destiny on earth may probably have been to preserve to us vestiges of primitive and forgotten ages in the history of the globe.\"\u2014Revue Orientale et Americaine, 1\u00e8re s\u00e9rie, tom. vi. pp. 386, 387.\nspecimen of the Neuchih writing, he was induced by the descriptions to believe that the character now used by the Koreans was identical with that of the Kin dynasty. This hypothesis at least we are now in a position to meet with a direct negative. An inscription in an unknown character, at the Imperial Mausoleum at Keen-chow, in the Province of Shense, has been preserved to us in a Chinese work published in 1618, the \u77f3\u58a8\u942b\u83ef Shih mih tseuen hua. From a Chinese translation and note given on the tablet, we learn that this is an inscription in the Neuchih or national character of the Kin dynasty. The date given is 1134, from which we see that it was cut previous to the invention of the Small Neuchih character; so that there is no doubt we have there a specimen of the Large Neuchih character, invented by Kuhshin and his colleagues.\n\nA facsimile of this inscription from the Che p\u00fch ts\u00fch chae ts\u2019ung shoo, was published by Professor Neumann in 1837, in regard to which he remarks:\u2014\u201cI am not able to read the Kin writing, much less to translate it; but it is obvious from the frequent repetitions of characters in the text of our memorial that this Kin writing consists of a syllabary composed of abbreviated and modified Chinese characters.\u201d\n\nShortly after this the same inscription seems to have attracted the attention of the Archimandrite Habakkuk, while he was residing at Peking, and he communicated it to Father Hyacinth at Petersburg in 1841. The latter gave a facsimile of the same in his work on the statistics of China.\n\nI was not aware of this inscription having been noticed or\n\n---\n\n1 This work was reprinted during the present dynasty, in a collection entitled \u85dd\u5703\u641c\u5947 E poo sow ka.

The same inscription is reproduced in the \u91d1\u77f3\u8403\u7de8 Kin shih tsuy pien, published in 1805. It is noticed in several other works on lapidary inscriptions.\n\n2 Asiatische studien, p. 41.\n\n3 See Journal Asiatique, 5e s\u00e9rie, tom. 17, p. 532.\npublished by any one in Europe, when it occurred to me to collect what information I could regarding the system of writing used by the Neuchih; and the inscription in question, which I found in the *Shih mih tseuen hua*, being the only specimen of the character that I could discover, I forwarded a facsimile, with some remarks, to the Asiatic Society in 1859. The same appeared in the Society's Journal the following year.\n\nIn 1861, Professor De Rosny, of Paris, published an article on \"The Neuchih, their language and literature,\" by which it appears he has misunderstood my remarks; but he expresses, with considerable confidence, his belief that the writing is ideographic and not alphabetic. Although my opinion was decidedly in favour of the Neuchih being an alphabetic or syllabic writing, I find, on referring to my former article, that I scarcely expressed such a view, preferring to leave the question to be decided when we should acquire more light on the subject. It was something novel to me to find M. de Rosny advocating the ideographic as the most probable, to the exclusion of the alphabetic, and I regret that he has not given us a fuller development of his reasons, for, from his extensive knowledge of the written characters of various nations, probably few are in a more favourable position to form a correct appreciation of the matter.\n\nIf my tendency was formerly towards the alphabetic theory, my views are now so far modified by the analysis of the newly-found inscription, that I incline to the view at first expressed by Professor Neumann, that the Kin was a syllabic writing.\n\n---\n\n1 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 17, pp. 331 passim.\n2 \"Revue Orientale et Americaine,\" 1\u00e8re s\u00e9rie, tome 6, pp. 379\u2013387.\n3 The accompanying cut, taken from a Chinese brochure on coins, which has merely the title \u5916\u570b\u9322\u6587 *Wai ku\u00f3 tseuen wan*, \"Superscriptions of foreign money,\" is termed a \"Sanscrit character coin;\" but as the character bears no resemblance to any known form of Sanscrit writing, and as it presents a strong similarity to that on the Keen-chow tablet, I am induced to think it is\nHaving ascertained, then, with tolerable certainty that the preceding inscription is a specimen of the Large Neuchih character; and being assured that the one with which we are now occupied is also Neuchih\u2014observing the radical difference in the formation of the characters; we are shut up to the conclusion that this is a specimen of the Small Neuchih character, invented in 1138. The date is more than two centuries later, being 1345.\n\nThanks to the transcripts in the other characters, and especially the Sanscrit, there are scarcely any of the Neuchih in the larger size part to which I cannot attach the sounds with a high degree of probability, if not absolute certainty. The conclusion at which I have arrived is given in the plate facing this page.\n\nThe last character in the list \u975e to which I have not put any sound, is one of very frequent occurrence, being found 39 times; that is, it is distinctly legible 33 times, and in six other places I have supplied it, as I think, on unquestionable authority. It is to be noticed that in every case this is written smaller than the other characters; a peculiarity which belongs only to two or three others in certain places, and appears to me to indicate that the sign so written plays a secondary part in the syllable. Another peculiarity which attaches to \u975e is, that while every other Neuchih sign is represented by a corresponding one in Chinese, there is in no case any counterpart to this in Chinese. Of the 39 places where it is found, 30 times it stands against the long vowel \u0101; i.e. in \u0101, 2; b\u0101, 1; d\u0101, 1; d\u0101h\u0101, 1; h\u0101, 7 (3 of which I have supplied); k\u0101, 1; m\u0101, 2; n\u0101, 3 (one of which I have\n\na relic of the Kin. The paucity of documents in that character may warrant its insertion here.

Seven times it is found appended where there is no long vowel in the Sanscrit, of which four of the syllables end in a; i.e. na, 1; ra, 1; ta, 1; ya, 1;\u00b9 one ends in e; i.e. ddhe; and two end in i, i.e. ddhi, 1; and ti, 1 (which I have supplied).\n\nFrom the preceding analysis of 39 occurrences of this character, I am disposed to think that it is a sign indicating the lengthening of the vowel in the syllable to which it is attached, and that the seven (or perhaps six) exceptions are irregularities.\n\nSuch is the result of the inscription on the east side of the arch, and the decipherment of the west side would probably add a few more to the number of the identified vocables. From an examination of these 81 characters, I am convinced that the Neuchih writing was pre-eminently syllabic, and not alphabetic, as I inferred on a former occasion. The selection of symbols appears to me to be the most arbitrary, nor can I see any approach to principle or mutual relation in comparing the one with the other. Not only do we find the utmost diversity in the forms of any series of syllables we may select, classified either according to their initials or finals, or any other principle that I can think of; but there are also characters nearly similar in form, which express widely different sounds.\n\nThus the characters \u9f8d ea and \u9f8d wa, although nearly allied phonetically, are yet totally unlike in every part. If there is any difference in sound between \u9f8d m\u0101n and \u9f8d m\u0101n, it is merely one of tone, as indicated by the Chinese equivalents; and yet their forms would never lead anyone to suspect a phonetic connection. So also the two characters for ga \u9f8d and \u9f8d, although so utterly dissimilar, yet they represent precisely the same syllable. Again, if we have diversity of forms corresponding to similar sounds, there are also similar forms answering to very different sounds; thus \u9f8d ki only differs by one stroke from \u9f8d ea.\n\n\u00b9 It is doubtful if this syllable ought not to be y\u0101.\nIt would seem as if a number of Chinese characters had been selected to represent the sounds in the Neuchih language, on the plan adopted by the Japanese, but abbreviated and disfigured after a fashion of their own, to which we have now no key. While the original or Large Neuchih characters, of which the specimen at Keen-chow has been published, show some traces of the form of Chinese, this latter invention of the Small Neuchih characters appears to be a more elegant and abbreviated form, in which the slight traces retained in the earlier invention are altogether obliterated, and the faintly-pictorial forms of which each character was made up are represented by merely conventional collocations of strokes. Thus we have all the cumbrous variety of a pictorial system adapted to the expression of a simple series of vocables. The scheme is, probably, unique in the history of chirography, and is not a little suggestive in reference to the condition of the people among whom it took its rise. It seems strange that a complex syllabary like this should have been adopted by a people living so near the tribes who were using the simple Ouigour alphabet, and would imply a very restricted intercourse with such tribes. Instead of wondering that such a method of writing should be neglected and become obsolete, we may rather be astonished that it was able to maintain its ground for two centuries and more, as is proved by this inscription.\n\nIt is probable that the eighty-one signs here given are but a small portion of the Neuchih syllabary, as it is not at all likely that the simple sounds of the Sanscrit alphabet would anything like exhaust the vocables of the Neuchih language. Accordingly we find in the twenty-one lines of small characters at the end of the large, a great number of new ones which do not occur in the preceding portion. Now as every several character has to be learned by itself, and the knowledge of any one or more gives no clue to what is the sound of another, here is a study of a much more difficult nature.\n\nI have mentioned that each of the parts except the Sanscrit concludes like this, with some lines in a smaller size character. On looking over the Chinese part, I saw at once that\nthat was not a mere transcript of foreign sounds, but a veritable piece of composition in the Chinese language. Although very much defaced and obliterated, I have been able to get an approximate sense out of the several detached fragments, though the omission of so many links necessarily prevents a perfect translation even of what remains.\n\nHaving shown the Tibetan portion to Professor Foucaux, at Paris, I ascertained from him that that was in the Tibetan language, and not a transliteration from another tongue. From a cursory inspection of that hopelessly imperfect portion, he could give me the meaning of such fragments, that I felt assured, if it was not the exact translation of the Chinese, it was at least the same in substance.\n\nA superficial examination of the Mongol portion satisfied me that that was also in the Mongol language; and the Ouigour portion seems to be in the Ouigour language. Under these circumstances, the presumption is almost a certainty that the small-size Neuchih is a specimen of the Neuchih language as well as writing. This imparts an additional interest to it; and while the difficulty of interpretation is thereby increased, its philological value is greatly enhanced.\n\nAppended is an interlinear restoration of the inscription, and the sounds of the syllables given in Latin characters, according to the Sanscrit. The columns coincide in length and number with the original lines of the Neuchih portion, and the corresponding syllables in each of the six lines are placed horizontally opposite, as near as the peculiarities of the respective systems will admit. The portion in black is what is preserved of the original inscription, and the missing parts which have been supplied are represented by the red.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 A reduced facsimile of the four vertical portions of the inscription, produced by photo-lithography, from the original rubbing, will appear in Col.

The reading followed by Davis, as appears from his translation, is: \u0928\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0938\u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u092f\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d \u0935\u093e \u091a\u0947\u0924\u094d \u092f\u093e\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093f, which is mentioned also in the Var. Lect. to the edited text. The comparison of the MSS. leaves little doubt that this reading is a correction, suggested by the remark of Utpala, that in case the planet should set in one and rise in another Nakshatra, only that name must be taken which agrees with the order of the month. It may happen that the Jovial year is called M\u0101rga\u015b\u012brsha, although the planet sets in it, and this does not seem to agree with the author's rule, but only those names of Nakshatras can be used, from which the names of the lunar months are derived; even if Jupiter rises in Rohi\u1e47\u012b, the year cannot be called Rauhi\u1e47a, there being no month of the name. The addition of the word \u092e\u093e\u0938\u0915\u092e\u0947\u0935 implies the rule which is expressed in the reading followed by Davis.

Vishnu, B\u1e5bhaspati, Indra, Agni, Tvashtar, Ahirbudhnya, the Ancestors, Vi\u1e63ve-Devas, the Moon, Indra-Agni, the A\u1e63vins, and Bhaga, are indicated to be the lords of the lustrums, successively.\n\n24. The (first year of each lustrum called) Samvatsara is (ruled by) Agni; the second, Parivatsara, by the Sun; the third, Id\u0101vatsara, by the Moon; the fourth, Anuvatsara, by the Creator; and the last, Udvatsara,\u00b9 by Rudra.\n\n25. In the first year of a lustrum there is indifferent rain; in the second, rain falls only in the beginning of the season (i.e. in \u0100r\u0101vana and Bh\u0101drapada); in the third, rain is very copious; the fourth year brings rain in the later season (i.e. only in A\u1e63vina and K\u0101rtika); the fifth year is said to give very little rain.\n\n26. Amongst these lustrums there are four excellent, viz., those ruled by Vishnu, Indra, B\u1e5bhaspati, and Agni; the four middlemost are indifferent, and the four last are reputed to be very bad.\n\n27.

At some places, however, will be drought, and raging of storms and fires; plagues of the country also and phlegmatic diseases are found in the course of this year of Prabhava; yet people will feel no serious grief.\n\n29. The year following is known as Vibhava; the third is \u00c7ukla; after it, Pramoda; and, finally, Praj\u0101pati. These years and their effects are happy in an always increasing degree.\n\n30. Over countries where rice, sugar-cane, barley, and other corn produce good crops, where dangers are past, hostilities stilled, mankind rejoicing, where the miseries of the Iron Age have disappeared, the monarchs then hold their sway.\n\n31. In the second lustrum, the first year is Angiras; the two following \u00c7rimukha and Bh\u0101va; then Yuvan; finally, Dh\u0101tar; these are the five years in due order. Three out of them are excellent; the two remaining middling.\n\n32. In the former three years\\footnote{R. in the printed text, \\textit{\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\u0915\u092e\u094d}, as the Comm. has.} it rains sufficiently, and people live free from affliction and dread. In the latter two also it rains indifferently well, but diseases prevail and war is impending.\n\n33. In the lustrum presided over by Indra, the first year bears the name of \u012a\u00e7vara; the second, of Bahudh\u0101nya. The three following years, as measured by the motion of Jupiter, are known as Pram\u0101thip, Vikrama, and Vrsha.\\footnote{This word is constantly written \\textit{\u0935\u093f\u0936} in one MSS. of the Comm. This in addition to the Var. Lect. The word is introduced into Tamil in the form of \\textit{\u0935\u093f\u0936}.}\n\n34. The first and second are good years, and bring back the Golden Age, as it were, amongst mankind. Evil is Pra-\nm\u0101thin, but Vikrama and V\u1e5bsha bestow copiousness of food, although at the same time they cause dangerous diseases.\n\n35. The first year of the fourth lustrum, which they call Citrabh\u0101nu, is excellent; the second, named Subh\u0101nu, is middling; it brings sickness, yet causes no mortality.\\(^1\\)\n\n36. Then follows T\u0101r\u0101na, which gives copious rain; further, P\u0101rthiva, joyful, with the luxuriant growth of grain. The fifth year, Vyaya, is held to be a happy one: love reigns supreme, and festivities follow one another without interruption.\n\n37. In the lustrum of Tvash\u1e6dar, the first year is termed Sarvajit, the second Sarvadh\u0101rin; on this follow Virodhin, Vikrta, and Khara. Of these the second is auspicious, the others are dangerous.\n\n38. Then (in the lustrum allotted to Ahirbudhnya the years are:) Nandana, Vijaya, Jaya, Manmatha, and Durmukha. The first three in this lustrum are beneficent; Manmatha produces indifferent effects; the last year is very bad.\n\n39. In the seventh lustrum are Hemalamba; farther Vilambin, Vik\u0101rin, and \u010carvar\u012b;\\(^2\\) the fifth Jovian year in the cycle is known by the name of Plava.\n\n40. During the first year there will be a great many plagues in the country and rains accompanied with much wind. In the second year there will be but little corn and not much rain;\\(^3\\) the third will be very rich in terrors and rain; Plava, finally, is beneficent, and gives plenty of rain.\n\n41. In the lustrum ruled by the Vi\u1e63ve-Devas the first year is called \u010cobhak\u1e5bt,\\(^4\\) the second \u010cubhak\u1e5bt, the third Kro\u1e0dhin; the succeeding are Vi\u1e63v\u0101vasu and Par\u0101bhava.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Comm. follows a wholly different reading.

The first and second bring pleasure to the people; the third many evils; the last two are indifferent, but in Par\u0101bhava will be fires, distress owing to war and sickness, and danger to Brahmins and kine.\n\n43, 44. The first year in the ninth lustrum is Plavanga, the second Kilaka; farther, Saumya, S\u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e47a, and, lastly, Rodhak\u1e5bt. Kilaka and Saumya bestow hail; Plavanga is unfortunate for mankind, in many respects; S\u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e47a brings little rain and plagues of the country. As to the fifth year, Rodhak\u1e5bt, the rain in it and the thriving of the crops will be unequally divided.\n\n45. In the tenth lustrum, which is sacred to Indra-Agni, the first year has the name of Paridh\u0101vin. Then comes Pram\u0101din and \u0100nanda; the following are R\u0101kshasa and Anala.\n\n46. In Paridh\u0101vin, the middle-country is ruined, the king lost, the rain deficient, and fire shows its fury. In Pram\u0101din men are indolent; there will be riots, and loss of red flowers and seeds.\n\n47. The following year makes all men rejoice. Both R\u0101kshasa and Anala bring damage; the former produces summer corn, the latter excites conflagrations and pestilence.\n\n48. In the eleventh lustrum are Pingala, K\u0101layukta, Siddh\u0101rtha, Raudra, and Durmati. During the first year there is excessively much rain, theft, asthma, cough, and shaking of the jaws.\n\n49. K\u0101layukta has many evils, but in Siddh\u0101rtha are many good things. Raudra is declared to be very cruel and pernicious. Durmati brings, moderately, rain.\n\n50. In the lustrum lorded over by Bhaga, the first year, called Dundubhi, greatly promotes the growth of the grain.\n\nSome MSS. of his commentary prefers \u0936\u094b\u0915\u093f\u0930\u0941\u0924\u0941, but according to other copyists, \u0936\u094b\u0915\u093f\u0930\u0941\u0924\u0941. The Tamil has borrowed this and the following name in the form of \u015bubakiru\u1e6du and \u015bobakiru\u1e6du, consequently in inverse order.\nThe following, termed Udg\u0101rin,\u00b9 is baneful to sovereigns, whilst the rains during it will be unequally distributed.\u00b2\n\n51. The third year is Raktaksha, in which there is danger caused by mordacious animals, and sickness. The fourth, Krodha, arouses much wrath, and depopulates kingdoms through wars.\n\n52. The last year of the last lustrum is styled Kshaya. This, the originator of manifold loss, causes danger to Brahmans, though it makes cultivators thrive, and augments the profits of Vaicyas, \u00c7\u016bdras, and thieves.\n\nHerewith I have given, in a succinct form, the whole of what is contained in the work, \u201cthe Cycle of Sixty Years.\u201d\n\n53.

But (in our opinion) the wild elephant's path includes Sv\u0101ti, Bharani, and K\u1e5bttik\u0101; the three following paths comprehend each three mansions, beginning with Rohini.

Others say that the paths and roads are north, middle, or south, according as the junction stars of the mansions are in the north, middle, or south of the girdle of asterisms.\n\n6. Some others again define the roads in this way: the northern road commences with Bharani (and goes to Magha included); the middle road begins with P\u016brva-Phalguni; the southern road extends from P\u016brva-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101 (to the end of A\u1e63vini).\n\n7. (But enough); the science of stars is founded upon tradition, and where the authorities disagree it does not become us to make our own choice either way. My task is to mention the different opinions.\n\n8. The planet Venus setting or rising in the northern paths, produces abundance of food and happiness; in the middle paths, it has indifferent effects; in the southern ones, it has a miserable influence.\n\n9. One may state the effects to be very excellent, excellent, a little less, indifferently good, middling, less than this, bad, miserable, and utterly miserable, in the northern paths, and so on, in succession.\n\n10. The first division (of the cluster of Nakshatras) consists of the four mansions, Bharani, K\u1e5bttik\u0101, Rohini, and Mrga\u015biras. It brings abundance, but causes terror in the countries of Vanga, Anga, Mah\u0101s\u0101ha, B\u0101hlika, and Kalinga.\n\n---\n\nThere is a considerable discrepancy between this passage of Garga's and the one quoted immediately before. The word \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e in the second stanza means \"indifferent, neuter, neither good nor bad.\"\n\nThis is a very elliptical way of speaking for \"the planet standing in this division.\"\n11. If another planet overtakes\\(^1\\) Venus after the latter has risen in this division, it will destroy the kings of the Bhadr\u0101-\u00e7vas,\\(^2\\) \u00c7\u016brasenas, Yaudheyas, and of Ko\u1e6divarsa.\n\n12. The second division is made up of \u0100rdr\u0101, Punarvasu, Pushya, and Agle\u015bh\u0101; it brings immense rain and good crops; to Brahmins, especially to such as are cruel-minded, it is disastrous.\n\n13. When Venus is assailed\\(^3\\) in it by another planet, distress presses the barbarians, savages, horsekeepers, possessors of kine, the Gonardas, proletaries, \u00c7\u016bdras, and Videhas.\n\n14. The planet if rising in Magh\u0101, P\u016brva-Phalgun\u012b, Uttara-Phalgun\u012b, Hasta, or Citr\u0101 (forming the third division), causes the loss of the crops, danger of famine, and robbery, the rise in rank of low-born people, and confusion of the different classes of society.\n\n15. The same being checked\\(^4\\) in Magh\u0101, etc., by another planet, strikes the shepherds, \u00c7abara-savages, \u00c7\u016bdras, (barbarous) Pundr\u0101s, the savages of the western marches, the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Utpala: \u091a\u0935\u094d\u092f\u094b \u091a\u0935\u094d\u092f \u0906\u0930\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0941\u092a\u0930\u093f \u092a\u0924\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964 \u0905\u092f\u0924\u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0903\u0964\n\n\\(^2\\) The Bhadr\u0101-\u00e7vas are a mythical people, fabled to live in the remote East, or, according to the phrase of the astronomical Siddh\u0101ntas, at 90\u00b0 E. from Lank\u0101, in the region where Yamakot\u012b, \u201cJava Point,\u201d is situated. (The r. Yamakot\u012b is erroneous, for Yama\u2019s kingdom is in the South, not in the East; and, besides, the compound Yamakot\u012b is devoid of sense.) The origin of the Bhadr\u0101-\u00e7vas dwelling near the Udayagiri may be traced, I think, to Rgveda, i. 115, 2, seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) The term \u0101kramate\u2014\u201cjumps up against, assaults, attacks, overpowers\u201d\u2014is synonymous with \u0101rohati (v. 11), \u201cjumps upon, overtakes.\u201d\n\n\\(^4\\) Avash\u1e6daddha is another synonym to \u0101kr\u0101nta and \u0101r\u0101dha.\n2. **Venus**, as it were, the penance of \"wearing guilt,\" as though she had committed sin.\\(^1\\)\n\n3. Venus, at reaching Mrgaciras, is said to be pernicious to enemies and grain; by standing in \u00c1rdra, the planet hurts the Kosalas and Kalingas, and gives plenty of rain.\n\n4. When the same stands in Punarvasu, the A\u1e63makas and V\u0101larkas suffer great distress; when in Pushya, there is copious rain, and warfare betwixt the hosts of the inhabitants of Fairyland.\\(^2\\)\n\n5. Venus, moving in A\u015blesh\u0101, makes men suffer horribly from serpents. By cleaving the star Magh\u0101,\\(^3\\) the same is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This stanza of our author's is cited in the Pancatantra (i. st. 289), and that in a corrupt form.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Vidyd\u0101haras are more especially the \"wise\" elves of Teutonic mythology; etymologically, the elves, Icel. Alfar (the Gothic form of which cannot be Alb\u016bs, as Grimm supposes in D. Myth. p. 243, but must have been Albjus, sing. Albus), are the Skr. Rbhus, a word that likewise means \"clever, skilful.\" King Alfred the Great, or, as the Northmen called him, Elfr\u0101dr hinn Riki, rightly bore his name, \"having the wisdom of an elf.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) Upala gives in a quotation the definition of the cleaving, alias occultation, of the junction star of Magh\u0101 by a planet: \u0935\u0948\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0927\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964\n\n\"The definition of the occultation of the star in question is, according to the scientific astronomers, as follows:\" \"A planet occults the junction star of Magh\u0101 (Regulus) when its own rectified latitude, being in the same direction (north), is more than half the latitude, and less than one and a half the latitude of the star.\" From this we may deduce that the author of the stanza, whoever he may have been (probably Brahmagupta), had a still more accurate knowledge of the real latitude of Regulus than the \u015a\u0101rya &c. has, in which the latitude is stated to be 0. Another stanza defines the latitude of the Moon when causing the occultation of certain stars:\n\n\u0935\u0948\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0927\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964\n\n\u090f\u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0917\u0941\u0923\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964\nmischiefous to the great treasurers (alias, prime ministers), but bestows much rain.\n\n29. In P\u016brva-Phalgun\u012b the planet annihilates the savage \u00c7abaras and Pulindas, and promotes the fall of rain; in Uttara-Phalgun\u012b it brings rain and strikes the inhabitants of Kuru-field and Panc\u0101la.\n\n30, 31. By Venus standing in Hasta, the Kurus and painters suffer, and the rain is prevented from falling; in Citr\u0101, affliction comes to diggers of wells and to birds, but there will be a fine rain; in Sv\u0101ti the rain will be plentiful, and distress reigns amongst messengers, merchants, and skippers; in Vi\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101 also the planet gives nice rain, though merchants, to be sure, incur peril.\n\n32. The planet, when in Anur\u0101dh\u0101, occasions strife between the potentates; in Jyesh\u1e6dh\u0101, grief to great monarchs; in M\u016bla, to druggists and physicians; in all three there is drought.\n\n33. In P\u016brva-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, aquatic animals are vexed; in Uttara-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, diseases rage; in \u00c7ravana, sickness of the ear prevails; in Dhanish\u1e6dh\u0101, danger awaits the infidels.\u00b9\n\n34. In \u00c7atabhishaj, Hesperus afflicts distillers; in P\u016brva-Bhadrapad\u0101, gamblers from profession, as well as the Kuru-Panc\u0101las; at the same time he brings rain.\n\n35. The same, when in Uttara-Bhadrapad\u0101,\u00b2 damages fruits and roots, and, when in Revati, such kings as are to undertake a campaign; when in A\u1e63vini, horse-keepers; and, in Bharu\u1e47i, the Kir\u0101tas and Yavanas.\u00b3\n\n\"The Moon occults the third star of Magh\u0101 when she has her greatest latitude north; so she does Pushya, Revati, and \u00c7atabhishaj, when she has no latitude.\" From this we must conclude that the third star of the mansion Magh\u0101 is \u03b3 Leonis.\n\n\u00b9 To understand the quibble, we must bear in mind that another name of Dhanish\u1e6dh\u0101 is \u00c7ravish\u1e6dh\u0101, and that Buddhas are \u00c7r\u0101vakas. Cf. ch. viii. 12.\n\n\u00b2 In the printed text \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0927\u093f is an erratum for \u0906\u0930\u094d\u0927\u093f.\n\n\u00b3 We see that not only in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a the word Yavana is quibbled upon by being connected with \u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928, for \u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u0940 is synonymous with, or\nTHE MEHA-SANHITA.\n\n1. When Venus becomes visible, or sets on the 14th,\n   or 15th, or 16th day of the month, then the earth\n   will be covered with a heavy rain.\n\n2. When Venus and Jupiter stand, one in the west, the\n   other in the east, in the seventh asterism (alias, at six signs\n   apart), then the people, oppressed with\n   sickness, sorrow, and grief, look in vain for rain from the\n   heavens.\n\n3. When Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn move, all\n   together before Venus, then arise conflicts among men,\n   disputes, and the inhabitants of Fairyland, and storms caus-\n   ing the downfall of all that is high.\n\n4. Friends will be fickle in their friendship; Brahmans\n   will not attend to their work; and not the slightest rain\n   will be caused by the Thunderer, who, with his thunderbolt,\n   will destroy the tops of the mountains.\n\n5. As Saturn advancing before Venus, the barbarians,\n   elephants, asses, buffaloes, dark sorts of grain, hogs,\n   Kudra-savages, Cidras and inhabitants of the Dekkhan,\n   will be destroyed by the outbreak of ophthalmia and rheumatic\n\n6. Venus proceeding Saturn, destroys the people by fire,\n   sword, famine, drought, and robbers, and hurts mov-\n   able and immovable things in this world, and the northern\n   country, and the space around by fire, lightning, and dust.\n\n7. The same staying behind Jupiter, ruins everything\n   white Brahmans, cows, temples, and the East; the clouds\n   pour showers of hailstones; diseases of the throat prevail;\n   but the autumnal corn will be plentiful.\n\n8. Mercury standing before Venus, at rising or setting,\n   brings rain, and occasions different kinds of jaundice of\n\nat least figured by. That \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0935\u0940 once must have been a common\nword for womb may be safely inferred from the fact that \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0935\u0940 really\noccurs as part of, \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0915\u094b, Rigveda, x. 31, 6.\n\n\"The author \"intimates herewith,\" says Utpala, \"that one of them\nmust be on the eastern, the other on the western horizon\"\u2014\u0924\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092e\u094d\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u093e\u0935\u093f \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0935\u0940\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d \u091a \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u093e\u0932\u093e\u092f\u0947\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f \u091a\u094b\u0926\u094d\u092f \u090f\u0935\u0902\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964\nbilious origin, promotes the growth of summer corn, is deadly to monks, keepers of sacrificial fire, physicians, stage performers, horses, Vaipyas, cows, kings along with their vehicles, to yellow things, and the West.\n\n44. When Hesperus is red, like fire, there is danger of fire; when blood-red, the sword will rage; when pale, like a gold line on a touchstone, diseases reign; when greenish yellow or russet, asthma and cough rage; when ashy, coarse, or dusty in appearance, no water falls from heaven.\n\n45. But when the brightest of planets shows the hue of curdled milk, the white water-lily, or the moon, has distinct and far expanding rays, and a large orb, occupies a favourable position amid the stars, is free from unnatural signs and victorious, then it brings about a state of things similar to that in the Golden Age.\n\nChapter X.\n\nSaturn's Course.\n\n1. In staying in \u00c7ravana, Sv\u00e2ti, Hasta, \u00c1dr\u00e2, Bharan\u00ee, and P\u00fbrva-Phalguni, Saturn, if bright, makes the earth to be covered with plenty of water.\n\n2. The same, standing in A\u00e7lesh\u00e2, \u00c7atabhishaj, and Jye\u015bth\u00e2, brings safety, but no abundant rain; in M\u00fbla, he brings famine, the sword, and drought. I will also state the effects (of Saturn) in each mansion separately.\n\n3. By moving in A\u00e7vini, Saturn destroys horses, grooms, poets, physicians, and kings' counsellors; by moving in Bharani, dancers, musicians, singers, outcasts, and reprobates.\n\n4. At Saturn standing in Krttik\u00e2, such as are dependent upon fire in their profession (smiths, etc.) and generals\n\n---\n\n1 The r. \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0932\u0902 \u091a is wrong; r. \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0932\u093e\u092f with the Comm., or, as some MSS. have, \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0932\u093e\u092f.\n\n2 A planet is styled \"victorious\" when it shows the signs enumerated in ch. xvii. 10.\nsuffer; so do the Kosalas, Madras, K\u0101cias, Panc\u0101las, and waggoners during the planet's stay in Rohin\u012b.\n\n5, 6. The Vatas, sacrificers, their employers, noblemen, and the inhabitants of the Middle-country suffer, when Saturn is moving in Mrga\u00e7iras; likewise the P\u0101rataas, R\u0101ma\u00f1has, oil-millers, bleachers, and thieves, during the planet's stay in \u0100rdra; so do the Panjabees, the inhabitants of the Western Marches, Surashtrians and Sindhu-Sauviras, when Saturn stands in Punarvasu; and when in Pushya, bell-ringers, public criers, Yavanas, merchants, gamblers, and flowers.\n\n7, 8. The planet's motion in A\u015blesh\u0101 causes affliction to aquatic animals or products, and snakes; in Magh\u0101, to the B\u0101hl\u012bkas, Chinese, Gandharians, S\u016blikas, P\u0101rataas, Vai\u00e7yas, to storehouses and merchants; in P\u016brva-Phalguni, to vendors of liquors, women of the town, damsels, and the Mahrattees; in Uttara-Phalguni, to kings, sugar, salt, mendicant friars, water, and the district of Taksha\u00e7il\u0101.\n\n9. By the planet standing in Hasta, barbers, potters (or oil-millers), thieves, physicians, tailors, elephant catchers, harlots, the Kausalakas, and makers of garlands are afflicted.\n\n10. When Saturn is staying in Citra, the same occurs to women, writers, painters, and variegated vessels; when in Sv\u0101ti, to bards, spies, envoys, squerries, shippers, mimics, and such-like people.\n\n11. By the planet's stay in Vi\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101, the Trigartians, Chinese, Kul\u016btas, saffron, lac, corn, madder, and safflower are lost.\n\n12. When the planet stands in Anur\u0101dh\u0101, the Kul\u016btas, Tanganas, Kashmirians, along with kings' counsellors, magicians, and bell-ringers, come to grief, and discord arises between friends.\n\n---\n\n1 Utpala differently: \u0930\u0938\u0903: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0925\u093e\u0903\u0964\n\u090f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0923\u0903\u0964\n\n2 Utpala: \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0923\u0940 \u092d\u093e\u0917\u093e\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093e\u0903\u0964 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0940\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0903\u0964\n\n3 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0924\u0903: are, according to the Comm., \u0938\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092d\u094c: \u0915\u091a\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092d\u093e\u0903 \u091a\u0964\nthey combine, however, both qualifications.\n\n4 Otherwise the Comm. \u0915\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0940: \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0925\u0903\u0964\n13. Kings, priests, men honoured by kings, heroes, associations, families, and guilds come to grief by Saturn standing in Jyesht\u0101; so do the K\u0101cis, Kosalas, Panc\u0101las, fruits, herbs, and soldiers, by his stay in M\u016bla.\n\n14. When the planet is moving in P\u016brva-Ash\u0101dha, the Angas, Vangas, Kausalas, Magadhas, Pundras, Mithilas, the inhabitants of the district of Girivraja and T\u0101malipt\u0101 come to grief.\n\n15, 16. Saturn moving in Uttara-Ash\u0101dha, destroys the Da\u015b\u0101r\u1e47as, Yavanas, Ujjain, the \u010cabaras, the mountaineers of P\u0101riy\u0101tra, and the Kuntibhojas; in \u010cravana, judges, eminent Brahmins, physicians, chaplains, and the Kalingas. When the planet stands in Dhanishth\u0101, the king of Magadh\u0101 conquers, and treasurers thrive.\n\n17. During the planet\u2019s remaining in \u010catabhishaj and P\u016brva-Bhadrapad\u0101, some among the physicians, poets, distillers, traders, and politicians are distressed; so are rivers, cartwrights, women, and gold, by Saturn moving in Uttara-Bhadrapad\u0101.\n\n18. When Saturn is moving in Revat\u012b, persons maintained by kings, the inhabitants of Kraunca-dv\u012bpa, the autumnal corn, \u010cabaras and Yavanas are crushed.\n\n19. When Jupiter is moving in Vi\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101, while Saturn stands in K\u1e5bttik\u0101, then most horrible calamity befalls the people; when both planets are staying in one mansion, there will be civil feud.\n\n20. If Saturn is variegated, he destroys the birds; if yellow, he causes danger of famine; if blood-red, he threatens danger of the sword; and if ashy-coloured, he occasions many quarrels.\n\n21. If he is spotless bright, showing the lustre of the beryl, he brings good to the people. He is also auspicious if showing the hue of the blue Barleria and flax-flower. Agreeably to the statements of the Seers, Saturn is destructive to the members of such and such a caste, the colour of which he happens to assume.\n\n1 \u0928\u0935\u0940 in the printed text is an erratum for \u0928\u0935\u0940.\n2 In the text \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u093e\u092a\u093f is an error for \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093e\u092a\u093f.\nChapter XI.\n\nThe Course of Comets.\n\n1. After a previous study of the Course of Comets by Garga, Par\u0101cara, Asita-Devala, and many other authorities, I undertake now to treat this subject in such a way as to remove perplexity.\n\n2. The rising or setting of comets cannot be known by astronomical rule, as there are three different kinds of them; celestial, atmospheric, and terrestrial.\n\n3. Anything which, without fire, has an igneous appearance, is a species of blazing star, except glow-worms, meteors on the graves, gems, jewels, and the like.\n\n4. Atmospheric lights are such as are (occasionally observed) on banners, swords, dwellings, trees, horses, elephants; celestial ones are seen among the asterisms. Such as do not belong to these two descriptions are terrestrial Ketus.\n\n5. Some state that there are 101 comets; others, that there are 1,000; the Seer N\u0101rada declares there is only one comet, which assumes different shapes.\n\n6. What does it matter, whether there is but one or more?\n\n---\n\n1 These are, according to Utpala, K\u0101ty\u0101ya\u1e47a, R\u0101hulaputra, N\u0101rada, Vajra, etc. From Vajra very little is known. I surmise that it is synonymous with Par\u0101cara (cf. Atharva V. 6, 65, 1) and Garga (see footnote at ch. 1.3).\n\n2 The term pi\u1e63\u0101c\u0101laya is, to my knowledge, nowhere explained. As the Pi\u1e63\u0101cas are supposed to have their favourite abodes in the cemeteries, I think that phosphorical phenomena so common in burial grounds are so termed.\n\n3 From this definition it appears that the term ketu admits of no exact rendering; generally it denotes \"comets,\" but the terrestrial and atmospheric ketus are most likely phosphoric and electric phenomena, as well as falling stars and gaseous lights in morasses. I cannot forbear recalling to the memory of the reader the lines in Byron's \"Manfred\": \"When the moon is on the wave,\" etc.\nThe effects, though, should at all events be told, along with their rising, setting, place, contact, hazy covering and colour.\n\n7. The number of months wherein the comets show their influence is equal to the number of days during which they are visible; in the same manner the number of years corresponds to that of months. The effects begin to take place after forty-five days.\\(^1\\)\n\n8. A comet which is short, small, serene, glossy, not crooked, white, and appearing but for a short time, or only perceived just rising,\\(^2\\) brings abundance and happiness.\n\n9. If a comet shows an appearance the reverse of the forementioned, it is not auspicious, especially if it resembles a rainbow, or has two or three crests.\\(^3\\)\n\n10. Twenty-five comets with crests, and shining like a necklace of pearls, jewels or gold, are termed \"the Kiranas.\" They are visible in the eastern and western region,\\(^4\\) and occasion quarrels amongst sovereigns. They are the offspring of the Sun.\n\n11. Even as many stars resembling in colour to parrots, fire, the Dophariya-flower, lac or blood, are visible in the south-west, boding danger of fire. They are the sons of Fire.\n\n12. As many others, with crooked crests, and rough and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Comm. confesses that the statement is not very clear\u2014\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092d\u0940\u092f\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u092f\u092e\u0915\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\\(^2\\) i.e. in common parlance, \"tail.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) Utpala remarks that the whole number of them is not visible at the same time, but each of them separately. This rule is of general application: \u090f\u0924\u093f\u0926\u0902 \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0928 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0917\u092a\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0935\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0947\u0926 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0938\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0964\n\n\\(^4\\) Utpala r. \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u0941\u0903; and explains \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941 \u0907\u0937\u094d\u091f\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e \u092f\u0926\u093f \u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964\ndark, appear in the south. Being the sons of Death, they forebode pestilence.\n\n13. Twenty-two stars, radiant, but without crest, in appearance round, like a mirror, and resembling water or oil, visible in the north-east, are the children of Earth, and threaten with famine.\n\n14. Three comets shining like to moon-light, silver, hoarfrost, the white lotus or jessamine, show themselves in the north. They are the sons of the Moon, and bring plenty.\n\n15. There is a single comet, with three crests and three colours, the offspring of the Creator. Know that this star, which may rise in any quarter, is called \"Brahma's rod,\" and foretells the end of the world.\n\n16. Herewith are enumerated the 101 comets. I shall now proceed to indicate the tokens by which the 899 (other) comets may be clearly recognized.\n\n17. In the north and north-east rise the so-called eighty-four comets, the sons of Hesperus. They show large and white stars, a soft brilliancy, and produce hard effects.\n\n18. Sixty stars, termed \"the Gold comets,\" children of Saturn, are glossy, repleendent, and double-crested. They may appear in any quarter, and have a most deleterious influence.\n\n---\n\n1 The same number is given by Par\u0101\u00e7ara; yet the enumeration differs in detail: \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903 | \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0937\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0937\u093e \u092d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f | \u0924\u093f\u0935\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u091a\u094b\u0926\u092f \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d: \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u0935\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092f \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923\u0947 \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092d\u094d\u0930\u094b\u092a\u0915\u093e: \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u092e\u093e\u0939\u0903: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u091f\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928\u0940\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0936 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u093e: \u092c\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d \u092e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d\u092f-\u0915\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0903: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u091f\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0903: | \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u0941\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e: | \u0927\u0942\u092e\u094b-\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0940\u092f\u0903: | \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0936 \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947 - \u092f\u0941\u0917\u094d\u092e\u0947 \u0938\u094b\u092e\u0947\u0928 \u092f\u0939 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0942\u0924\u0903: | \u090f\u0915\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941-\u0915\u094c\u0937\u0932\u0903: | \u0907\u0924\u093f || The R\u0101hi Audd\u0101lik\u0101 is only another form of Udd\u0101laka, for in mythology father and son, i.e. the earlier and later phases of the same phenomenon, get naturally confounded. \u00c7veta-ketu, \"the white comet,\" the well-known fabled teacher in the Upanishads and Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, is, as the name by itself clearly shows, a star, and not a man. Cf. v. 37 below.\n19. The \"hairless\" comets, the offspring of Jupiter, have no crest, and one bright nucleus. These, sixty-five in number, are fulgent, appear in the south, and are of evil augury.\n\n20. The fifty-one, named the \"Thieves,\" sons of Mercury, are faint, not very clear, long and white; they may rise in any direction, and produce evil effects.\n\n21. Ill-omened, too, are the children of Mars, sixty in number, who look like blood or fire, and show three crests and three kernels. These, styled the \"Saffron-coloured\" comets, are visible in the north.\n\n22. The thirty-three sons of R\u0101hu, nominated the \"Opaques wedges,\" show themselves on the disk of sun and moon. What they presage, has been told in the chapter headed\u2014The Sun's Course.\u00b9\n\n23. A hundred-and-twenty others, called the \"Omniform\" comets, are the offspring of Fire. They are enwrapt in a blazing circle, and occasion dreadful fires.\n\n24. Seventy-seven comets, of dark red hue, without a nucleus, with diffuse rays, and in the shape of chowries, are the sons of Air. These, known by the appellation of the \"Red,\" are rough in appearance, and bring evil.\n\n25. Eight other comets, named the \"Heap,\" because resembling a cluster of stars, are children of the Creator. The 204, called the square comets, are likewise his offspring.\u00b2\n\n26. Thirty-two, sons of Varuna, termed the \"Herons,\" have the shape of a bamboo or shrub. These, brilliant as the moon, are said to have cruel effects.\n\n27. Ninety-six, styled the \"Tranks,\" as bearing the shape of headless bodies, are children of Time. These comets, whose nucleus lacks distinctness, are malign and dreadful.\u00b3\n\n28. The nine comets, rising in the nine quarters, show one bright and great star. So much for the general description of the thousand comets; I shall now enter into details.\n\n\u00b9 ch. iii. 7.\n\u00b2 It is to be understood, as the scholiast adds, that these have an evil influence: \u092a\u093e\u092a\u0915\u0932\u093e \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u091c\u093f\u092f\u093e:\u0964 \u0924\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0926\u093f\u0915\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u0903\u0964\n\u00b3 Utpala follows another reading (see Var. Lect.) and explains accordingly, \"bring safety to the Pu\u1e47\u1e0dras.\"\n39. The Fat comet rises in the west, stretching far to the northward; is large and of glossy appearance. It causes instant mortality, yet egregious abundance too.\n\n40. The Bone comet, having the same characteristics, save that it is rough, is said to bring frightful famine. Another, known as the Sword comet, having the same appearance, except that it is smooth, and rises in the east, occasions affrays and pestilence.\n\n31. The Skull comet, with purple-tinged rays and crest, becomes visible at the day of new moon, in the east, and extends its course through half the heavens; it causes famine, mortality, drought, and sickness.\n\n32. The comet of Rudra rises in the east, on the path of Fire, with a crest in the shape of a trident, and with a blackish, rough or red glare. It extends its course over a third part of heaven, and has the same effects as the former.\n\n33. In the west rises the Movable comet, whose crest is an inch high, and turned to the south. It is steadily increasing in length the more it proceeds to the north.\n\n34. As it has come near the asterism of the Great Bear, the pole-star and Abhijit (Vega), it goes back, and having moved through half the firmament, sets in the south.\n\n35. It will destroy the country from Pray\u0101ga, on the Ganges, as far as Ujjain and Pushkar\u0101r\u0101ya, and northwards up to the river Devik\u0101, along with the greatest part of the middle country.\n\n36. Some parts of other countries, too, will be stricken by diseases and famine. Its influence will be felt for ten months, or, according to others, for eighteen.\n\n37. The White comet will be visible in the east, at midnight, with a crest pointing to the south, and another, named Ka, resembling a yoke, in the west. Both will be seen at the same time, during seven days.\n\n---\n\n1 In the printed text r., of course, \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u0930\u094d. As to the path of Fire, cf. ch. lx. 3.\n\n2 The erratum in the text needs scarcely to be pointed out.\n\n3 In Pargana is added, \"Ka, the son of the Creator,\" \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0924\u093f-\n38. Both bring plenty and luck, if they be smooth. Should Ka be seen for a longer period, then he bodes distress from the fury of the sword during ten years.\n\n39. When the White comet resembles a tuft of hair, is rough and darkish, and when, after moving through a third part of the firmament, it retrogrades from right to left, then it destroys two-thirds of the population.\n\n40. A hairy star with purple-tinged crest, becoming visible near the Pleiads, is known as the Radiant comet. It has the same effects as the last-mentioned.\n\n41. The Dhruva-ketu has no determined course, dimension, colour, or form, and may appear in any direction, as well in the heavens as in the sky, or on the earth. If fulgent, it has agreeable results.\n\n42. But the princes on whose warlike equipments, the countries on whose dwellings, trees, and hills, and the householders on whose implements this luminary is seen, are doomed to destruction.\n\n43. The comet termed the Water-lily, as bearing the hue of that flower, appears for one night in the west, with its crest tending to the east. It brings surely uncommon abundance throughout ten years.\n\n44.

At rising it brings abundance for four months and a half. Sometimes, however, it gives rise also to the prevalence of noxious animals.\n\n46. The Water comet appears likewise in the west; it looks glossy, and wears its crest erected in a westerly direction. It produces for nine months plenty and tranquillity among mankind.\n\n47. The Bhava-ketu, showing a faint nucleus, and shedding a soft lustre, is visible for one night in the east. Its crest, turned to the right, is like a lion's tail.\n\n48. One may predict uncommon abundance during a number of months, corresponding to that of hours for which the star continues visible. In case the comet looks rough, one may expect deadly diseases.\n\n49. The Lotus comet, white, like the fibre of the nymph\u00e6s, will be seen for one night in the west; it brings plenty and joy during seven years.\n\n50. The comet styled Avarta rises in the west, at midnight, shining bright, red-coloured, and with its crest turned southward.\\(^1\\) The abundance caused by it lasts as many months as is the number of hours the star is visible.\n\n51. Another, styled Samvarta, bears a purple red crest, and shows itself at twilight, in the west. After percurring a third part of the heavens, this horrible comet makes a stand, showing a crest in the shape of a trident.\n\n52. Throughout a number of years, equal to that of hours it is visible, it will slay monarchs by the sword, and vex the asterism in which it rises.\\(^2\\)\n\n53.

When a comet hurts Citra, those who are well up in the lore may predict the death of the ruler of Kuru-field. The kings of the Kashmirians and K\u00e2nbojas are annihilated, in case an evil comet stands in Sv\u00e2ti.\n\n58. If such a one stays in Vi\u00e7akh\u00e2, the sovereigns of the Ikshv\u00e2kus and of Alaka\u00b2 are killed; if in Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2, the Pundra chieftain; and if in Jyeshth\u00e2, the emperor is slain.\n\n59, 60.

It is he who, in the days of yore, at once heightened the splendour of the ocean, by causing the water to vanish: the rocky peaks, scooped out by the claws of sea-monsters, were no longer covered with waves, but with a rolling tide of the choicest gems and jewels, blended with dropping pearls, as if to abash the gods with their bright jewelled crowns.\n\n2. It is he who increased the magnificence of the sea, although he bereft her of the water, since the treeless cliffs showed coral-trees, precious stones, and jewels, and glittering snakes coming forth in long rows.\n\n3. It is he who, by swallowing the waters of the great\n\n\u00b9 i.e. in common parlance, \"bright Canopus.\" Agasti, of which agastya is a produced form, is derived with suffix (or seeming suffix) asti, like gahasti, from the base aj, asti, \"to brighten,\" a meaning especially apparent from \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f. Thus agasti signifies bright, shining. From the same base is \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f \"fire,\" \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f \"an ornament,\" and probably \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, as well as Greek \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd.\n\n\u00b2 The myths alluded to are so well known, chiefly from the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, that they require no other indication.\nocean, brought it to grief, but, at the same time, to a state of lustre, such as immortals only know, through the sparkling dolphins, water-elephants, serpents, and the jewels scattered round about.\u00b9\n\n4. The ocean, bereft, indeed, of its water, but covered with floundering dolphins, pearl-oysters, and conch-shells was lovely as the lake in autumn, with its rippling waves, water-lilies, and swans.\n\n5. It is he who made the sea shine as heaven, with dolphins for its white clouds, with precious stones for stars, with crystal for its moon, with its drained bottom for a serene harvest sky, and with the radiant gems in the hoods of snakes for comets and planets.\n\n6. The Vindhya stands raising its shaking summits, in order to mar the road to the Day-god's chariot; like banners gaily float on high the garments which support the disturbed Elves (in moving through the sky), who are eagerly pressing to their bosom their dear loves clinging to their shoulders; the mountain waterfalls, issuing from the caves, are haunted by lions, from whose heads hang, like chaplets of blue Barlerias, clusters of bees following the scent of the elephant's frontal juice mingled with the quaffed blood; it seems as if\n\n\u00b9 The scholiast understands \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092b\u0941\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u092d\u093f\u0937\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903 to have a double meaning: the first and natural one as rendered above; the other, as referring to \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940, as follows: \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092b\u0941\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u092d\u093f\u0937\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903\u0964 \u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0939\u0928\u093e: \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0938\u093e \u0928\u0926\u0940\u0964 \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e: \u092a\u093e\u0923\u0940\u092f\u0915\u0903\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u0903\u0964 \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0943\u0926\u093f\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0926\u0943\u0922\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092b\u0941\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u092d\u093f\u0937\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903 \u0915\u0941\u091f\u093f\u0932\u0902 \u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0924\u093f \u091c\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0938\u093e: \u0915\u0941\u091f\u093f\u0932\u0917\u0924\u092f\u0903\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u092d\u094b\u092e\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0938\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u0903 \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0964 || Now, waiving some minor points, e.g. the inaccuracy of identifying prasphurat with calat, it will be observed that the animal on which an image is represented to sit has little to do with the god's \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940; most certainly the retrogradation of Mars does not show his \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940.

Such was the Vindhya, when he was stemmed by Agastya. Listen ye now to the description of the Seer's appearance.\n\n7.

In the same manner the Agyins restore youth to Cyavana or Cyavana (alias Bhrigu's son), i.e. Bhrigu (Hesperus) is born again as Bhrigu-putra (Lucifer).\n\n2 \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u094b\u092a\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0942 \u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0930\u0923\u093f has a double meaning.

At the eastern extremity stands Marici; next to him in westerly direction is Vasishtha; next to whom Angiras; then Atri, next to whom Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu, in regular succession, beginning from the east. Arundhati, that pattern of spouses, is seen next to Vasishtha.\n\n7. When these luminaries are pale, devoid of beams, faint or vexed by meteors, thunderbolts, haze, and such-like, they will destroy each their own dependency; on the contrary, they tend to make the same prosper, in case they seem large and bright.\n\n8. Marici is understood to have power of doing harm to Gandharvas, gods, demons, spells, herbs, angels, goblins, dragons, and elves.\n\n1 Cf. Colebrooke, Misc. Essays, ii. p. 356. The other reading of the latter part is rendered by Colebrooke, \"Being connected with that particular Nakshatra, to which, when it rises in the East, the line of their rising is directed.\" This does not agree with the Sanskrit words, as given by Colebrooke in a foot-note, but these are evidently misprinted.

Now, we have to r. \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0903: in the text, for \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0903: in the Comm. \u0924\u0947\u0937\u093e\u0903 is, in both instances, an error for \u0930\u0947\u0937\u093e (\u0930\u0947\u0937\u093e), and this the word by which \u0938\u0942\u091a\u0941 of the text was rendered. The passage is debased to such an extent that the hand of Utpala is only partially visible.\n\n2 Consequently, the stars \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, and \u03b7 of the Great Bear, correspond to Kratu, Pulaha, Pulastya, Atri, Angiras, Vasishtha, and Marici. Arundhati must be the small star near \u03b6 called Alcor or \u03b3.\n\n3 Mentioned in the subsequent verses.\n9. Vasishtha, when hurt, is deadly to the Scythians, Yavanas, Dards, P\u0101ratas, K\u0101mpbojas, and hermits living in the wilderness; he gives prosperity, when he is radiant.\n\n10. Scholars, wise men, and Brahmans are enumerated as belonging to Angiras; and foresters, aquatic produces, the sea and rivers are allotted to Atri.\n\n11. To Pulasty\u0101 are said to belong giants, devils, children of darkness, fiends and serpents; to Pulaha, roots, and fruits; and to Kratu, sacrifices and sacrificers.\n\nChapter XIV.\n\nDivision of the Globe.\u00b9\n\n1. Each group of three lunar mansions, to begin with K\u1e5btik\u0101, forms a ninth of the whole series; to each of these groups corresponds a part of the countries, the division of which begins at the centre in Bharata-varsha, proceeding hence to the eastward, south-eastward, and so forth.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 The word k\u0101rma is the specific Sanskrit form of a word once common to all Indo-European tongues, viz. kurma, Lat. culmus, Teuton. holm, etc. It does not originally denote the \"tortoise\" itself, but its back, for the proper meaning is \"mound, buckle, half-globe, holm.\" Even in Sanskrit, in such compounds as k\u0101rmannata, the word signifies the form of the back of the tortoise. At the time when the term \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0917 became current, k\u0101rma was taken in its proper sense. Yet in later times they wholly mistook the meaning, and made an absurd drawing, representing a tortoise, as if k\u0101rma could denote a level! The rendering by \"globe\" is not wholly exact, since properly only a half-globe, a holm, is supposed to be raised above the waters. Cf. Ind. Stud. x. 209.\n\n\u00b2 The astrological use of this partition is, that, a particular group of Nakshatras being vexed, the corresponding group of countries suffers too, or, as Garga puts it:\n\n\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0917\u0935\u0924\u094b \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0917\u0923\u093f \u091a\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0964\n\u092a\u093e\u092a\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0924\u094b \u0939\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0938\u092f\u093e\u0926\u0964\n\u0930\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0915\u094b \u0939\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u0964\n\u0906\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e \u091a\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0924\u093e\u092e\u094b \u0926\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0915\u093e\u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0965\n2, 3, 4.

In the west are the Ma\u00e7imat and Meghavat hills,\n\n\u00b9 It is strange here to find Sinhala after the occurrence of Lank\u0101 in v. 11.\n\u00b2 The Balaipatna of Ptolemy, so that the r. Palalpatna, preferred by Lassen, is proved to be a false form; see Lassen, Altert. iii. pp. 181 and 183.\n\u00b3 The Comm. sees two words in the compound, viz. Taimingilas and Sanas or \u00c7anas, whatever this may be.\n\u2074 Some of the countries enumerated do not lie in the S.W., e.g. the K\u0101mbojas, Yavanas, Ambashthhas, and others.\n\u2075 In the astronomical Siddh\u0101ntas Vajav\u0101mukha is the supposed abode of the dead at the South Pole.\n\u2076 Synonymous with Karnapr\u0101veya is Karnapr\u0101vara\u1e47a. Now, pr\u0101vara\u1e47a is synonymous with pr\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6dha, so that pr\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6dha either stands for pr\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6dha, or pr\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6dha and pr\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6dha are derived from the same base with pr\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6dha. The M\u0101rkandeya-Pur\u0101\u1e47a 58, 31, has Karnapr\u0101dheya, in which dh is a misread v.\n\u2077 Or, as another MS. has, Dramid\u0101s. There must be some Dravidian tribe in the West, perhaps the Brahui in Beluchistan, who belong to the Dravidian stock. See Caldwell, Drav. Grammar, p. 11. It is worth while remarking that Par\u0101\u00e7ara in his enumeration mentions Dramid\u0101s, Dravidas in the East too; those seem to be the tribes of the R\u0101jmahal hills. See Caldwell, l.c.\nVanaugha, Mount Kshur\u0101rpa\u1e47a, the Mountain of Sunset, the Apar\u0101ntakas (i.e., people of the western marches), \u010c\u0101ntikas, Haihayas, Mount Pra\u1e63\u1e6da, the Vokk\u0101nas, the Panj\u0101b, Ramathas, P\u0101ratas, T\u0101rakshiti, the J\u1e5bngas, Vai\u00e7yas, Gold-Seythians,\u00b9 and all the lawless hordes of barbarians living in the west.\n\n22, 23. In the north-west are the M\u0101ndavyas, Tukh\u0101ras, T\u0101las, Halas (or Lahas), Madras, A\u1e63makas,\u00b2 Kul\u016btas, Lah\u0101da (or Ladaha),\u00b3 the kingdom of the Amazons, the Man-lions, the Woods,\u2074 the inhabitants of the sky, the rivers Ve\u1e47umati, Phalgu\u1e45uk\u0101, and Guru\u1e25\u0101,\u2075 the Marukuceas (or Murukuceas), Carnarangas, the One-eyed men, the S\u016blikas (or M\u016blikas), the Long-necks, Long-faces, and Long-hairs.\n\n24-28. In the north lie the mountains known as Kail\u0101sa, Him\u0101laya, Vasumat, Dhanushmat, Kraunca and Meru, the Hyperboreans, Kashudraminas, Kaikayas, Vas\u0101tis, those who live near the sources of the Jamn\u0101, Bhogaprasth\u0101, the \u0100rjun\u0101yanas, \u0100gnidhras (or Agniy\u0101s), \u0100dar\u00e7a, Antardv\u012bpa, Trigarta, the Horse-faced, Dog-faced,\u2076 Long-haired, Flat-noses, D\u0101serakas, V\u0101\u1e6dadh\u0101nas, \u010caradh\u0101nas, Taksha\u010dil\u0101, Pushkal\u0101vat\u012b, the Kail\u0101vatas, Kan\u1e6dhadh\u0101nas, Ambaras, Madrakas, M\u0101l\u0101vas, Pauravas, Kacch\u0101ras, Dandapingalakas, M\u0101nahalas,\n\n\u00b9 The Comm. explains differently, \u201cthe region of Gold\u201d and \u201cSeythians.\u201d\n\u00b2 The Assakanoi of the Greeks.\n\u00b3 This seems to be Lahara, so frequently mentioned in R\u0101ja-taran-gin\u012b, e.g., 7, 912, 1373 (Lahara \u201cLaharian,\u201d 1173). It is a borderland betwixt Kashmir and Dardist\u0101n; to this identification of Lahara and Lah\u0101da, it will not be objected that our author, committing the grave blunder of placing Kashmir and Dardist\u0101n in the North-east (v. 20), should needs have assigned a wrong situation to Lah\u0101da too.\n\u2074 The Comm. takes \u0928\u0943\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923 for one word.\n\u2075 Guru\u1e25\u0101 (also Garu\u1e25\u0101) is, to my apprehension, the Garoigas of the Greeks; the river district they called Goryaia. Lassen, in his Altert. iii. p. 127 and 136, identifies the Greek name with Gauri. It need not be pointed out how exactly both forms coincide with Garu\u1e25\u0101 and Guru\u1e25\u0101.\n\u2076 R. with one MS. of the Comm. \u0924\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0917\u093e\u0932\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0932\u093e:.\nHuns, Kohalas, \u00c7itakas (or \u00c7\u00e2takas), M\u00e2ndavyas, the city of the Spirits,\u00b9 the Gandharians, the town of Ya\u00e7ovati,\u00b2 the Hemat\u00e2las, Kahatriyas,\u00b3 the inhabitants of the sky, Gavyas, Yaudheyas, D\u00e2sameyas, \u00c7yam\u00e2kas, and Kshemadh\u00fbrtas.\n\n29-31.

In case these groups, the first of which consists of Krtik\u00e2, Rohi\u00e7a, and Agvini, and so forth, suffer from evil planets; then the following monarchs, in regular order, are to perish; to wit: the kings of Panc\u00e2la, Magadha, Kalinga, Avanti, Anarta; farther, he of the Sindhu-Sauviras, H\u00e2ra-hauras, Madras; and, finally, he of the Kugindas meets his fate.\n\n\u00b9 Par\u00e2\u00e7ara has: \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d \"the city of the gods, of the Spirits,\" etc.\n\u00b2 A mythical city of the Elves.\n\u00b3 The Chatraloi of Ptolemy.\n\u2074 R. \u092a\u0932\u094b\u0932; palola must be the vulgar pronunciation for the Skr. palasa, \"swamp, marsh.\" The modern name is Terai, the eastern part of which, near Coosh Behar, seems to be meant by palola in our list.\n\u2075 In all likelihood a mythical land; with Ptolemy it is called Chryse (cf. Lassen, Altert. iii. 243), which is not to be confounded with the real island and peninsula Chryse. The latter is held to be Malakka; the Golden Island, however, the existence of which is denied by Lassen (Altert. iii. 247), but sufficiently attested not only by the Greeks, but also in the Kath\u00e2sarit-s\u00e2gara x. 54, 99; 56, 69; 57, 72; xviii. 128, 110, cannot be but Sumatra, including, perhaps, Java.

IV.\u2014The Pongol Festival in Southern India.\n\nBy Charles E. Gover.\n\nRead November 29, 1869.\n\nLong before I had set foot in India I had been greatly struck by the exceedingly different statements regarding its people which were made by those who knew them best. Some, and notably the missionaries, could find no language strong enough to express the utter abomination of Hindu life and custom. Every chapter of Ward's great work teems with phrases of the strongest reprobation. The ceremonies he describes are indeed vile, and it cannot be said that his condemnation is too strong. On the other hand, civil and military officers, of the highest integrity and the closest observation, have set up the Hindus as models which it would be greatly to the benefit of Europeans to follow. They saw in the Hindu village system, and the ordinary life of the villagers, a living type of patriarchal happiness, uprightness, and wisdom. Major Scott Waring may be taken as a type of such men. The discussions in Parliament upon the clauses of the great India Bill that permitted the appointment of Bishops, and opened India to mission work, are full of illustrations of this contradiction; and I can well remember when, as a boy, I waded through the reports, being struck with wonder that men who had lived side by side in India, who had gained enormous experience and possessed the ability to learn the lessons that experience should teach, could, by any possibility, arrive at conclusions so diverse. After many years spent in close intercourse with the people of India, I do not wonder now. On one occasion both views of the question were brought vividly before me. I had seen the Pongol, the touching domestic festival it is now my chief object to describe. It had proved by its simple pathos that the Hindus were akin to the noblest nations of the world, and that in their\nantiquity they were worthy of the honour that has come to them, of being the best and the least altered representatives of the *Juventus Mundi*, which all nations count to have been the Golden Age.\n\nFrom this, by the rapid transition afforded by the modern railway, I went straight into the great temple of Seringham, near Trichinopoly. What a new world was this! The idol car, bright with gilt and gaudy colours, was loaded with carvings of the obsceneest possible character. Vice was rampant there. It rioted in the *phallus*. As I passed the gigantic monolithic gates, which admitted the devout from enclosure to enclosure, it was impossible to escape the brilliant frescoes which adorned (?) the roof, far up, the nearest thing to heaven, in all that temple! How can I describe, or even hint at, what was there? In the most sacred shrine of Southern India, which contests the palm of sanctity with holy Benares\u2014carved and painted in every ring, increasing in abomination as the shrine was approached\u2014above the heads, on every side, yes, and under the feet of the thousands of men, women, and children who throng the place\u2014the application and essence of every Pauranic story told by the priests\u2014were these paintings, larger than life, with every detail of obscenity magnified out of all proportion. It required no very close observation to learn that these were but outward signs of what was daily performed and honoured within the holy precincts. Here was ample justification for every epithet employed by Ward, Dubois, or Wilberforce. Yet the Pongol declared, with equal force, in favour of domestic love and chastity, of simple thanksgiving and rural contentment. Both are right. Both are wrong. The key of the anomaly lies in this fact\u2014that Brahmanism is not Hinduism\u2014that the theocracy of the sacred caste has not permeated and indurated the other castes, that is, the mass of the people\u2014that the religious and social aspects of society are vastly different. The Brahmans are so much more intelligent, learned, supple, and pleasant to deal with than the common people, that almost all writers have confined themselves to Brahmanical life, and (though not often saying so)\nhave led most people to imagine that India is what the Brahmans are. It has thus come to pass that those who have not deliberately set themselves to try to understand the people, that is the nineteen out of every twenty of the population, have taken all their ideas from a class. The recent spread of Sanskrit knowledge has tended to the same end, for none but Brahmans know Sanskrit, and the whole of its more recent literature is Brahmanic, written to forward the purposes of the sacred caste. The civil and military servants of Government have always been so overworked that they have had no time to write, except on official subjects. While they lived, they, almost to a man, were stout defenders and apologists of the Hindus, but their evidence was but verbal; writ in water, it perished with them. There has, therefore, been no counterpoise to the pressure of Brahmanic influence. The result has been that there is, at the present time, next to nothing known of the common people, the Vaisyas and Sudras of the Hindu economy. This is the more to be regretted, because it not unfrequently happens that the lowest strata of society contain fossilized remnants of Aryanism as it was first introduced into India. The present Brahmanic system is the result of centuries of steady growth. The stages of this growth may be traced. As Brahmanism arose, Aryanism decreased. The Vedas were superseded by the Puranas, and Vedic ceremonies have given way to the monstrous pile of devotion built upon the deeds of Vishnu and Siva, Rama, Krishna, and Kali. The result of this has been that there may often be found, among the masses, types of primitive custom, which have long ago passed from the literature and practice of the priest caste. There is much reason to suppose that the Pongol is one of the most complete and interesting of these remnants of primitive life. That it is primitive is shown by the fact that the old Vedic deities are alone worshipped. Indra is the presiding deity; Agni is the main object of worship. A further proof of this point is given by the efforts that have constantly been made by the Brahmans to corrupt the ritual, and introduce Panuranic deities. Krishna is always declared by the Brahmans to be the Pongol god, but the tradition itself bears\nwitness that the feast is older than the god. The tale is, that when the great wave of Krishna worship passed over the Peninsula, the people were so enamoured of him that they ceased to perform the Pongol rites to Indra. This made the latter deity so angry that he poured down a flood upon the earth. The affrighted people ran to Krishna, who seized the great mountain Govardhana, wrenched it from its place, and held it aloft on the tip of his little finger, like some huge umbrella. The people then ran beneath with their flocks and were saved, until Indra saw that his wrath was vain.\n\nThus runs the story, and the conclusion is, that a grateful people dethroned Indra from his presidency of the Pongol and placed Krishna in his stead. Though the whole influence of the Brahmans has been brought to bear upon the point, the rustic conservatism of the cultivators has been able to withstand it, and everywhere Indra is the King of the Pongol. In very Brahmanic districts a compromise has been effected, by which Krishna and Indra share the honours of the feast.\n\nThe occasion of the festival is also primitive, for the Pongol is another feast of ingathering, the centre of Hebrew festivals, as this is of those of Southern India. Just as, when the Hebrews passed from their bondage into the land flowing with milk and honey, their joy at the change showed itself in the \"ingathering,\" so did the Aryan wanderers from the plains of Central Asia, and their hard fare and scanty crops, hail with joy the fruitful plains of India. It was indeed to them the blessed land. As they found that \"when they tickled the ground with a plough, the fields laughed with golden crops,\" they could not but celebrate the beneficent return of the seasons, and adore the elemental gods that blessed them. This of itself, however, will not prove the festival to be Aryan, although, combined with the proofs already and to be given, it will help to deepen our conviction of the recognition. But there can be no doubt that the Indian immigrants were previously a pastoral tribe, rich in horses, cattle, and sheep, and proud of the four-footed friends that carried them to the hunt or the battle, fed their families with milk and\nbutter, and were their indefatigable servants in the field. Hence they would bring with them an almost Arab love of animals. When they rejoiced over their ingathering they would not forget the dumb friends of their pastoral homes. However that may be, the Pongol is remarkable, as will be seen when the description is given, for the strange combination of pastoral, hunting, and agricultural life. There are \"Harvest Homes\" in almost every nation that owns fruitful fields, but I do not know of any other example of the combination. The great days of the feast are two\u2014one of these is devoted to the new crops, the other to the cattle alone. As will be seen, the cattle are treated with every imaginable honour, while the feast winds up with a grand hunt, first, of the cattle themselves, and next of a hare.\n\nThe exceeding simplicity of the ritual is another point to which I would ask attention. All who have studied the subject know that Brahmanism is remarkable above all things for its wondrous complexity.\n\nSo marked is this that after every important ceremonial the officiating priest has to offer a last oblation, and repeat a parting mantra to cleanse the guilt that must accrue from any forgetfulness on his part. The rosary is as much used by them as by Roman nuns, and for the same purpose.\n\nLong before the commencement of the feast, an unwonted activity pervades native society. The Pongol is the social festival of the year, and must be celebrated with due honour, else an ineffaceable stain will rest on the family name. It is the Christmas and Whitsuntide of England made into one, and must be treated accordingly. So as soon as the rains have finished, and this may be expected by about the first week in December, the carpenter, the builder, and the artist, are in full work repairing the houses. The inner walls of the verandah are adorned with the brilliant water colour drawings which take the place of the frescoes of Pompeii. The village soucar's house must be especially grand, else folks would doubt his ability to lend his usual advances upon the next crop. A very favourite representation is that of an English soldier prostrate beneath the feet of an infuriate tiger,\nwho glares at the sepoys who is bravely trying to rescue his pale comrades. Incidents in the life of Krishna are very frequently given, while Ganesa the bellygod squats on his feet over the door.\n\nWhen the house is ready, the housewife takes up the work. She has to buy new vessels of every kind, for it would be dreadful if the new rice were to be boiled in an old vessel. So the sides of the road in the bazaar are heaped with \"chatties\" of all sizes and shapes. Meanwhile the father of the family goes to buy new clothes for the children. The little girl, just beginning to walk, must receive her first bangle or necklace; the eldest boy must have a gold mohur to hang from his ear, or serve for a button on his vest. The master himself wants a new turban or cummerbund. All these must be bought at Pongol. Nor is this all. The family is an undivided one, and some of its younger members are serving as writers in the Hoosoor Cutcherry twenty miles away, striving to eke out small salaries. A present must go to each of them. They have no fields of their own from which to get their rice, so a sack of the new grain from the ancestral acres goes off to each. To this is added a pot of ghee, a set of brass pots, or perhaps a jewel; that the Pongol may not lack wherewith to make it joyful. This universal kindness is most pleasant to see, and of course still more gratifying to give and take. Nor does the gentle and kindly influence of the time cease here. The files of the Munafs' court will have been crammed with cases from litigious enemies or greedy money lenders. But as Pongol comes round many of them disappear. The creditor thinks of his debtor, the debtor of the creditor. The one relents, the other is ashamed, and both parties are saved by a compromise. Often it happens that a process is postponed \"till after Pongol.\"\n\nAll must be ready by the early part of January, when, according to the Hindu astrologers, the sun enters the tropic of Capricorn. The feast hangs upon this, and it will be seen that the most interesting event of the celebration must exactly coincide with the passage of the sun. The festival com-\nmences on the previous day, and lasts for seven days; of which the second marks the sun's passage, and is called Mah\u0101 (or Great) Pongol. For some days previously, however, the boys have been busy gathering sticks, straw, bratties (cakes of cowdung), dead leaves, and everything else that will burn. These have been carefully hidden and guarded, lest those whose heap of \"plunder\" was small, might poach upon their neighbours' preserves. Even the old folks are not supposed to know anything, so that their first view of the pile may have all the charm of novelty. We will suppose then that all is ready on the eve of the feast. Next day is Bh\u014dgi Pongol or Pongol of Rejoicing, but it is equally well known by the name of Indra, to whom the day is dedicated. Long before sunrise all are awake, the boys first of course, for they are the heroes of the hour. Routing out their elders from their places of repose, they lead them with shouting and leaping to the pile they have collected. When all are gathered shivering in the cold morning air, the leading youngster applies the torch, and in a moment a vivid flame leaps up into the sky. At the same time every street and lane has its bonfire, and far away to the horizon the gleam of the fires reddens the murky gloom. The young folks leap over the fire as it sinks, or heap on fresh fuel. The old folks stand around and tell of the glorious fires they made in \"the good old times,\" when men were different from what they are now. This fire is the oblation to S\u016brya, the Sun-god, or rather to Agni, and wakes him from his sleep, calling on him to again exert his power and gladden the earth with his light and heat. It is not easy to discover the origin of this curious feature of the day's proceedings, but there are very many passages in the Rig Veda which prove that something similar preceded every great festival. Compare, for instance, Rig Veda, i. 44, 9 (Wilson's translation, vol. i. p. 120), \"Thou, Agni, art the protector of the sacrifices of the people, and the messenger (of the gods); bring hither to-day the gods awaking at dawn.\" Again, Rig Veda, i. 45, 7 (Wilson, i. p. 122), \"The wise have placed thee, Agni, in (their) sacrifices as the invoker.\" Again, Rig Veda, i. 36, 2 (Wilson, i.\np. 100), we find\u2014\"Men have recourse to Agni, the augmenter of vigour; offering oblations, we worship thee; do thou, liberal giver of food, be well disposed to us here this day, and be our protector.\" In fact, there are many passages that would seem to show that Agni held among the Vedic races the position now filled by Ganesa, the god of good luck, the averter of obstacles, the messenger to and from the gods, who must be propitiated before any attempt is made to adore another god, else the prayer of the devotee would be spoiled in the carriage to the localities where the gods dwell, and be rendered a source of ill rather than of good. There are other passages which will be quoted further on, which prove that the crops, the cattle, and generally the provision of food, was under the control of Agni, and thus his worship at the ingathering assumed and maintained unwonted importance.\n\nThere is, however, one S\u016bkta, in the first Mandala of the Rig Veda, which seems clearly to point to some such universal bonfire as that which now marks the advent of Pongol. It is Rig Veda, i. 140 (Wilson, vol. ii. p. 63 ff), the second verse of which runs thus\u2014\"Agni the two-fold generated, devours the triple (sacrificial food), and when the year expires renovates what has been eaten.\" There is here a plain reference to the period of the year represented by the ingathering \"when the year expires.\" The \"renovation of what has been eaten\" is the harvest. Verses 4 and 5 point clearly to some vast celebration. \"The (flames of Agni) light-moving, dark-tracked, quick, capricious, restless, lambent, fanned by the wind, wide-spreading and ensuring liberation (to the devout), are kindled for (the benefit of) the pious reverencer of (holy) priests. Thereupon those (flames of Agni) extend together in all directions, dispersing gloom, and spreading great light along the path of darkness; when (Agni) illumines repeatedly the whole earth, and proceeds panting, thundering, and roaring aloud.\" The following verses beautifully describe the rushing of the fire, and its effect upon the earth. The last verse again draws us to the occasion and object we have in hand\u2014\"Agni, be propitiated by this our earnest praise, and may heaven and earth and the spontaneously\nflowing (streams) provide for us the produce of the field; and may the purple coursers (of the dawn) bestow upon us abundant food through a length of days.\u201d There are other passages, which need not be quoted, which show that it was common to light fires to Agni before the dawn, during the darkness of the night (Wilson, vol. i. pp. 119, 161).\u00b9 There is more difficulty in discovering why on this particular day the fires should be lighted by the boys. But perhaps even this point may be elucidated. I would only refer to the fact that Agni is frequently called the youngest of the gods, he is invoked as \u201cJuvenile Agni,\u201d as knowing \u201call that are born.\u201d The very season may have something to do with it. Harvest is the \u201crenovating\u201d period, the time of reproduction, the provision for children; and, as in many other countries, it was natural that the rejoicings of the ingathering should be initiated by the boys, who, alone in a Hindu household, may without shame exhibit tokens of exuberant joy. There are no dancing maidens; no light-heeled men. Manhood with the Hindu is a time of gravity and self-respect, and women may never join in a public celebration. Others more learned than myself may be able to follow up this part of my subject.\n\nThe feast is now begun, and all turn from the fire as it is extinguished by the rising sun, to the bath with which every\n\n\u00b9 In Max M\u00fcller\u2019s elaborate paper on the sixth hymn of the first book of the Rig Veda in the Journal R.A.S. for 1867, page 225, occurs the following translation:\u2014\u201cThou, O Agni J\u00e4tavedas, hast carried, when implored, the offerings which thou hast rendered sweet. Thou hast given them to the fathers, they fed on their share. Eat thou, O god, the proffered oblations. Our fathers who are here and those who are not here, our fathers who are below, and those who do not know, how knewest how many they are, O J\u00e4taveda, accept the well-made sacrificial portions. They who, whether burnt by fire or not, burnt by fire, rejoice in their offering in the midst of heaven, give to them, O king, that life, and thy (their) own body, according to thy will.\u201d The first two sentences clearly point to Agni as the messenger to and from the gods, and therefore to be invoked at the commencement of the sacrifice. The next phrase\u2014\u201cEat thou, O God, the proffered oblations,\u201d is still the ordinary form in which the offering is made. Can the next very remarkable phrase refer to a family gathering, when \u201cour fathers who are here and those who are not here, our fathers who are below, and those who are dear, are called to the festival, and is it meet agreeant to the gods the generations who have been blessed?\u201d The last sentence, \u201cwhether burnt by the fire, or not burnt by the fire,\u201d is equally striking. Can this refer to such a bonfire as I have described, and to the leaping over it, which is the constant accompaniment of the ceremonial? \u201cRejoicing in their offering in the midst of heaven\u2014whether burnt or not,\u201d is a very curious phrase, and would seem, on the face of it, to point to some popular ceremony, in which fire was an essential point.\nWhen this is over the ordinary morning prayers and mantras are repeated, and a special prayer is chanted to Shiva or Ganesha, that he will be pleased to remove all obstacles from the way of the successful accomplishment of the ceremony. It is necessary to say here that the image is used during the whole course of the celebration, except that of Ganesha, and this is simply adored because nothing whatever can be expected to go right if he be not propitiated. Shiva is represented on ordinary occasions as a white man sitting on an elephant. In his left hand is a bow, and in his right a thunderbolt, while his body is studded with a thousand eyes. Agni has also his special image, that of a stout man, red and hairy as Esau, riding on a goat. Surya is also a red man sitting on a water-lily. He has four arms and three eyes. But none of these are known at Pongol any more than they were at the time when the hymns of the Rig Veda were composed. In fact, we see them here only in the form of the deities. Indra is the rain which fell to cause the new spring. Siva or Agni, for the two are united, is the sun which ripened the grain. Does not this also point to a close connexion to the modern Hindu pantheon, which first admitted the Aryan gods into India, and then very nearly merged them altogether?\n\nThe same care previously the wife and her assistants have been busy preparing all kinds of sweetmeats, and while the husband is engaged in bathing and tooth cleaning, the accumulated store of sweets is parcelled out for presents to neighbours, friends and colleagues. Every European with whom she thinks she has the slightest connexion, or from whom she has a possibility of the slightest favour, must be carefully remembered. The gifts are laid out on trays. In the midst of these lies a sugar; or, perhaps, the vase gives way to an enormous elephant, round which will be grouped smaller vessels of sugar for the children; then plantains, bananas, and every other fruit in season. One thing may not be forgotten, it is a house. This must be as large as money can buy, and then be carefully encased in gold leaf, till it looks like one of the golden apples of antiquity. The whole\nare bound, adorned, and crowned by thick wreaths or rather chains, for many of them are a yard and a half long, of chrysanthemums thickly strung on a cord. Oleanders and other flowers are intertwined, but the golden chrysanthemum is the main and essential thing. When all is ready the servants are dressed in their best, and are sent with the trays to the houses of those who are invited to join the family party in the evening, for the Pongol is the great visiting time of the year, and the first day must be wound up by a family party. If the present is for a European or superior, the head of the house, or his grown-up sons, must go with the present. As soon as the present is brought in to the patron, the heaviest of the chains, and it is as long and heavy as the Lord Mayor's badge of office, is taken from the tray and thrown over the neck of the person to be honoured, and smaller chains are given to the children. A few fulsome compliments pass, and then leave to retire is given, and the ceremony is over.\n\nThus the day passes. With evening commences the party (a naucht very probably if the entertainer be rich). It is not within my purpose to describe details of etiquette and ordinary social life, and I therefore pass on, only stating that each evening of the feast there is an entertainment given, first by one and then another, of each group of friends.\n\nNext day is Mah\u00e0 (or Great) Pongol. It is also often called S\u00fbrya Pongol. At noon the sun will cross the equator, and bring the culminating glory of the feast. So great a day must commence with appropriate ceremonial, and in this instance it is bathing.\n\nIn country places the women run early in the morning to the nearest sacred tank and plunge bodily in without undressing. Usually the women are very particular not to wet their clothes, and an innovation so uncomfortable, and possibly dangerous, could not have been borne without good cause. The men also bathe very carefully, as if the occasion were very solemn. We have the reason in Rig Veda, i. 23, 15-24 (Wilson, vol. i. pp. 57, 58), \"Verily he (Agni) has brought to me successively the six (seasons) connected with the drops (of\nThe women next go in a household repeatedly ploughs (the earth for barley). Mothers in law who are desirous of sacrificing the animals waters (flow by the paths of sacrifice), making the milk of lime with sweetness. May these waters which are auspicious to the Sun, and those with which the land is consecrated, be propitious to our rite! I invoke the divine waters in which our souls drink; offer oblations to the flowing streams. Ambrosia is in the waters, in the waters are medicinal herbs; therefore, divine (priests), be present in their places. Waters, take away whatever has been done in me, whether I have (knowingly) done wrong or have pronounced imprecations (against holy men), or have spoken incantations. I have this day entered into the waters, we have immersed with thy essence: Agni, abiding in the waters, approach and fill me, thus bathed, with vigour. Agni, enter in the vigour, prosperity, and life, so that the gods may know the sacrifice of this my employer, and thou with the Brahmans may know it.\" If this passage refer to the water mentioned above, and the resemblance is so strong that its resemblance can hardly be accidental, we learn that the bathing is at once a part of the worship of Agni and a means of that greatest cleansing without which gods, the more in these times, would not be propitiated. The washerman must himself be pure. The passage also explains why the washer takes a portion in the Pongol ceremonial.\n\nIt will be seen shortly that the remaining work of woman in the house is the duty just described in the verse beginning \"Ambrosia is in.\"\n\nHaving thus the women proceed, without changing their clothes, to prepare the feast. It must be remembered that we are speaking of the very coldest time of the year, when the climate was a most serious inconvenience. It has been said that new earthen, or earthen vessels, had been purchased for the occasion. One of these is now taken and is filled with cow milk, sugar, jaggery or clarified butter, gram, and other substances calculated to produce a tasty dish. This is the work of the \"mother-in-law,\" and her object is \"to qualify the milk and rice with sweetness.\" The Pongol\ndish of rice is as important a test of housewifely skill in the Madras Presidency as the Christmas plum-pudding in English homes. New rice must alone be used\u2014in fact care should be taken that every constituent of the mess is the produce of the season just closed\u2014the ingathering must be celebrated with things that have just been garnered. (Usually Hindus will not eat new rice, as it is indigestible, bearing the same resemblance to rice that has been kept twelve months as a waxy new potato bears to its well kept-senior.) Meanwhile, as soon as the morning meal is finished, the men set up a fireplace in the yard of the house. This is no difficult matter, as nothing is required beyond a few bricks or stones and a little mud. Fancy a dozen horse-shoes, a foot across, placed one upon another and the top one bearing three or four knobs, so that the circular bottom of the pot shall not absolutely close the upper opening. Imagine this pile made of clay, strengthened and bounded by a few brickbats, and we shall have a pretty good idea of an Indian fireplace, such as is employed for all purposes of cooking, even in the kitchens of the best European houses. Such, at all events, is the contrivance used at Pongol. It is erected in the centre of the court, and open to the sun and sky. Here also we obtain a token of primitive origin, for usually, indeed we may almost say invariably, the Pauranic ceremonies are done within doors. In most respectable houses there is a small room set apart for such things. In it is the household god before which the master of the house performs his worship. In this room the family priest performs his rites, and instructs the growing lads in their religious duties. But then these household gods are Pauranic, while Indra, Agni, and Surya are Vedic. The latter worship, and apparently all the more important portions of\n\n1 Not only is it necessary to eat the new rice now, but the recent crop may not be tasted till now, however poor or stinted the owner may be. The first fruits must go to God, and the taste of the crop may not be used till the cattle in the dairy have been duly satisfied. In this way the feast shows the closest likeness to the Jewish celebration\u2014Leviticus, chapter xxiii., verses 10\u201314, \"When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest... And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the self-same day that ye have brought an offering unto your God.\"\nthe worship of Agni, were chiefly in the open air. The sun, rain, and wind have ripened the crops and caused the rejoicing of the Harvest Home, and surely the thanksgiving should be in the face of sun, rain, and wind, so that Indra and his fellows may see and help the ceremony, accepting the praise it is meant to show. (The circumstances of the case have been powerful in aiding the conservatism which leads the Hindu to oppose every innovation, and hence the scene of the ceremony has continued unaltered in spite of centuries of opposition.)\n\nWhen the fireplace is finished, attention must again be given to P\u00fclli\u0101rw\u0101mi. The approaching operation is the most important of the feast, indeed we may say of the year, while the month in which the feast falls is the most unlucky of all. Every day produces evil unless sufficient precaution is taken and suitable oblations offered to the gods. If this be so it behoves all good Hindus to be particularly careful now. So the women, who have to perform most of the ceremonies belonging to Ganesh, because no one has yet been found willing to marry a deity so hideous in outward shape, prepare a great ball of cowdung, which is supposed to represent faithfully a being whose elephant's head and huge stomach render him beyond the power of being improved or made presentable. This ball is then set upon a stone in the yard opposite to the fireplace. The surrounding area is carefully swept and watered. Then the orange-coloured flowers of the citron are taken in considerable quantity and the largest is stuck into the top of the ball. A woman now brings a small pot of rice flour, takes a pinch between her thumb and forefinger, and then proceeds to drop the flour on the ground in a regular geometric pattern. The flour is not sprinkled, but laid on the ground in a true, fine, continuous line. Wonderful skill is often exhibited in the drawing, if such it may be called when nothing touches the ground but the dropping powder, and the patterns are very complex. Yet there is in almost every house one or more women who will run through the whole figure without hesitation or mistake. A store of cowdung is nigh, and the remainder of the citron\nflowers. Of the former she makes a number of small balls about twice the size of a marble. In each ball she sticks a citron flower, and then deposits one at every point in the drawing where the lines intersect. Lastly some oil is poured over the larger lump that represents the god, and then all is complete. I should say here that every day during the month a similar drawing, adorned with its tiny balls crowned with the golden citron, is made on the ground in front of the house door. This is done so that \u015aiva, the destroyer, to whom the month is dedicated, may not be able to enter the house without having been appeased by the propitiated Gane\u015ba. Each day a fresh drawing is made, and new balls adorn it; but those used on former days are not forgotten. They are collected carefully each day, and preserved until the last day of the month, when they are all placed in a basket and carried by the women of the house to the nearest tank, into which they are thrown, carrying with them the ill-luck of the month, and permitting the incoming month to be free from fear or sorrow.\n\nWhen all is complete, the head of the house approaches the image and performs p\u016bj\u0101 in this way:\u2014Standing in front of the idol, just beyond the drawing, he folds his arms across his breast, laying the right hand on the left shoulder and the left hand upon the right shoulder. He then bows his head and seizes each ear by the hand that rests upon the shoulder nearest it, saying the while a mantra, which consists almost entirely of the words \u201cOh Vighn\u0113\u015bvara, Oh Ganapati, Oh Pillaiy\u0101r, help us this day. Avert all obstacles and help us.\u201d This he repeats three times as he bows lower and lower, till he is in danger of falling. Thus propitiated, there need be no further fear from Gane\u015ba.\n\nYet a third work has occupied the morning, for all are busy. This is purely a work of mercy. Those who know aught of India are aware that the lot of a young married woman is by no means enviable. She knows nothing of her husband, and dare not speak to him save at night. She is delivered over, body and soul, to the mercies of her mother-in-law; and the tender mercies of Hindu mothers-in-law are\nThe young wife, she is but a girl, must bear revilings and even beatings at the hand of her tyrant, and has no appeal. She must hew wood, pound rice, and fetch water. She must always be at the beck and call of her husband's mother and may never complain. A gentle girl under a shrewish mother-in-law endures martyrdom every day of her life. Not a week passes in any considerable town, but some young wife drowns herself in well or tank to rid herself of her tormentor. There is no redress even then, for when the coroner holds his inquest, there are always a score of old women to swear that she had complained of \"belly-pain,\" and had threatened to destroy herself in consequence. No coroner's jury can ease or redress the \"heart-pain\" that led to suicide. All this is well known, and when the joy of Pongol comes, mothers' hearts turn to their despised daughters, and try to devise some means of pleasing the she-tyrant. So a present, the best the house can provide, is carefully put together on a tray. It may be fruit, or brass pots, or ghee, or whatever else may be thought most acceptable. Then a small procession is formed. In front go three or four men beating tom-toms and blowing pipes. Then follows the gift held aloft. Over it, if the family be respectable, is held an umbrella, carried by a servant who walks behind the bearer of the gift. Next comes a tiny crowd of friends\u2014brothers, uncles, etc.\u2014numerous in proportion to the position or ferocity of the dame who is to be propitiated. Arrived at the house, the present is offered and accepted. Then the nearest relation present steps forward and asks that the daughter and her husband may come to the \"boiling,\" to fill up the family circle.\n\nAll this is done betimes, and then all gather in the court. The time of the passage is near, when the pot is placed in position. Beneath it is a store of wood. Around it are heaped as many bratties (cakes of dried cow-dung used as fuel) as will stand. At the proper moment fire is applied, and a curl of smoke tells that the \"boiling\" has commenced, and that the sun has made the passage. From this portion of the ceremony, the festival is known in Mysore as the\n\"Sankranti,\" from the Sanskrit word for a \"passage.\" Now every eye is fixed upon the pot. Crowded round it is the whole of the household, from the hoary grandsire to the child just able to walk. Even the infants are there in their mothers' arms, for women have as much place in the Pongol as the men. In front and nearest the pot ought to be the elders of the house, but the habitual reverence paid to age is for the nonce forgotten, and the boys have pushed through, and form the front rank. The house-mother trims the fire and maintains a glorious blaze. As the milk boils, so will the coming year be. Should the process be rapid, prosperity and peace will fill the house till Pongol comes again. Should the fire burn slowly, and the milk lie sullenly in the vessel, clouds of sorrow, shafts of destruction from the great Indra, lord of the lightning and rain, will overwhelm the family.\n\nAs the fire burns down, for the pot is large, a little ghee will be thrown on the fire, at once an offering to Agni and the means of more rapid boiling.\n\nIn the presence and activity of the women, we again see tokens of primitive origin. There is no doubt that in the Vedic period, the women had a special share in the worship of Agni. Compare, for instance, Rig Veda, i. 14, 7 (Wilson, vol. i. p. 35), \"Agni, make those objects of veneration, augmenters of pious acts (participant of the offering), together with their wives. Give them, bright-tongued, to drink of the Soma juice.\"\n\nAgain, Rig Veda, i. 72, 5 (Wilson, vol. i. p. 191), we read, \"The gods discovering thee (Agni) sat down, and with their wives paid reverential adoration to thee upon their knees.\" The same S\u00fbkta also contains an allusion, in verse 8, to the fact that Agni was esteemed as the deity who had given milk to mankind\u2014\"For thee (Agni) Saram\u00e1 discovered the abundant milk of the kine with which man, the progeny of Manu, still is nourished.\"\n\nAs the fire burns up, and it is clear that before long the milk will boil, the men-folk standing round mutter mantras or prayers, almost in the very words\u2014they cannot give them exactly, as the Vedas are a sealed book to all but Brahmans\u2014\nwhich so touchingly close the last two and other S\u016bktas of the second Ashtaka. \"Grant, Agni, to the offerer of the oblation, the earth, the bestower of cattle, the means of many (pious rites), such that it may be perpetual: may there be to us sons and grandsons born in our race, and may thy goodwill be ever upon us.\" Now every neck is bent, for the surface of the milk is disturbed. One bubble, and then another, rises to the top. Dead silence prevails\u2014a terror of waiting thrills the assembly. Then, with a heave, a hiss, and a surge of bubbles, the seething milk mounts to the top of the vessel. Before it has had time to run down the blackened sides, the air resounds with the sudden joyous cry of \"Pongol, Oh Pongol, S\u016brya, S\u016brya, Oh Pongol!\" The word Pongol means \"boiling,\" from the Tamil word Pongu, to boil; so that the joyous shout is, \"It boils, Oh S\u016brya, it boils, it boils!\" In a moment a convulsion of greetings animates the assembly. Every one seizes his neighbour and asks, \"Has it boiled?\" Both faces gleam with delight as the answer comes\u2014\"It has boiled.\" Then both shout at the top of their voices\u2014\"Oh Pongol, Pongol, Oh S\u016brya, Oh Indra, Pongol, Pongol!\" It is thus that the tiny boy greets his grandsire, and the father hails his son. The festival is fortunate. The great gods, through whose mercy the next and all succeeding harvests alone may come, have accepted the thank-offering. Indra is propitious. The heavy clouds shall come, gravid with rain, when the next season shall come. Seed-time and harvest shall not fail. The garners shall still be crammed with grain, the udders swelled with milk for the sustenance of man. Agni, S\u016brya, Mitra\u2014for it matters not by which name the god shall be called\u2014will still shine upon the earth, drying up the waters when the grain comes into the ear, gilding and ripening the bending shocks, and making the whole earth laugh for very gladness. The time of fear has gone. Magha can no longer hurt. The king of the gods is satisfied, why should men tremble for the rest?\n\nWhen the excitement has somewhat subsided, the pot is lifted from the fire and placed before the image of Ganesa, through whose grace no obstacle has prevented the boiling.\nAs soon as the mess is a little cooled, a portion is taken out of the pot and placed in a leaf platter before the god, who is asked to eat of it. When time has been given, and no movement is made, the share of the deity is taken away and given to the cow. Meanwhile, the second courtyard has been swept and prepared for the feast. In the centre is a huge dish, if such it may be called, when it consists only of some scores of leaves sewn together. Round the circumference of a circle, of which the dish is the centre, are set as many plates (sewn leaves) as there are persons in the house, counting women, servants, visitors, and relations. Then the pot is carried in, followed by the trooping guests. As soon as the vessel is emptied on the dish, each reaches his hand and crowns his platter with enough of the savoury and steamy food. When all are served, a moment's silence ensues, and then the master of the house lifts his plate in both his hands above his head. The guests do the same, and then all shout together, \"S\u016brya, S\u016brya, Oh S\u016brya, we offer this to thee. Eat thou, Oh god, the food we offer. Thou didst give to us.\" This done, the plates are again laid on the ground, and the meal commences. In five minutes the platters are clean and the meal is done. The dish, with as much rice as remains, is then taken outside, and either given to the cows or bestowed upon the mendicants, whose golden season is passing swiftly from them.\n\nSuch is the festival of the Pongol or boiling, and such it has been for thousands of years perhaps. Is not its mere description sufficient to mark it as altogether different from every Pauranic celebration? Does it not bring back to us something of what the Jewish feast of ingathering was in the times of Hebrew glory? I have not been able to trace many actual notices of the feast from such Vedic literature as is at my disposal, but there are many points in the narration which cannot be other than primitive, so contrary are they to modern Brahmanism, and so consonant with what we know to have been the custom of the Aryan race. First, with regard to the glad shout which hails the boiling, may we not see something like it in the last verse of Rig Veda, i. 141 (Wilson, vol. ii. p. 71), where we read\u2014\n\u201cAgni, possessing eminent (fitness) for supreme sovereignty, has been glorified by us with holy rites and with hymns. Let all who are present, as well as we ourselves, enriched (by his favour), shout aloud (the praise of Agni) as (loudly as) the sun (causes) the rain cloud (to thunder).\u201d This passage exhibits the worship and praise of Agni as being performed by visitors and servants\u2014\u201cLet all who are present, as well as ourselves.\u201d It exhibits them as joining in the shout of praise. The \u201cenriching by his favour\u201d is the harvest, the \u201crenovation of all that is eaten.\u201d We have seen the holy rites\u2014the hymns alone are missing. How remarkable is the common feast at which women and servants\u2014men of inferior caste\u2014may sit and eat! Does not this remind us of a time when, bound by a common danger, fighting a common enemy, and looking for a common good, the race was one differing in wealth and position, but not in blood or caste? At other times the wife may only eat her husband\u2019s leavings; the servant may not touch his master\u2019s food, or be seen eating his own. Now all sit at one repast. There is no question of superior or inferior. God has blessed them all alike with food. The rain descended, and the sun shone on the evil and on the good. There are, it is true, unholy rites among the Brahmans, where, under cover of the night, deeds are done that set at nought all laws of caste, religion, or the plainest morality. But these are modern. They are hidden in darkness, and their very perpetrators are ashamed to have their doings known even to their co-religionists. But the Pongol is domestic. It is open to the day. It is old, and opposed to every tenet of their religion as popularly taught. The levelling of distinctions of sex and caste is for a good purpose, and based on a fact of universal importance. The ingathering is as old as the race in India, and there can be little doubt that the feast has come down from primitive times, bearing witness against caste as an innovation, a thing unknown to their early forefathers.\n\nBut again. No Brahmans are present. The master of the house is the leader of the feast. Gifts are made in profusion, but they are to mothers and sons-in-law, to cows,\ncalves, and beggars. The very offering to Pillaiy\u0101r or Ganesa, which at all other times is a perquisite of the priest, is now given to the cows or to the poor. There is a purohita or \"man put forward,\" but he is not a Brahman; he is the master of the house or his eldest son.\n\nThere is no image but that of Ganesa. Lapse of time has run Agni and S\u016brya into one, but the process is apparent in the Rig Veda. Indra is universally accepted as the presiding deity, but appears to have subsided into the silent king of the gods, and almost every rite is dedicated to the Sun-god, who is, as it were, the active deputy, the functionary who is the sole means of approach to the higher deity. The messenger of the gods can make or mar the message he carries, and it is better to please him than to adore the more dignified but less active members of the Pantheon. Puranism has done something to degrade the ceremony, for while the people know that they must worship Agni, they have forgotten why; and the modern Mercury\u2014Ganesa\u2014has been introduced to perform the very work for which Agni was first invoked; to remove obstacles, protect the ceremony, and carry to Swarga (the abode of the gods) the adoration offered. There is, therefore, now a curious duplication of deities, to perform the same duty, in which the gross Pauranic idol has occupied the place of the elemental deity. To put the fact in Indian official language, we may say that Ganesa has been appointed averter of obstacles, vice Agni, promoted.\n\nBut we must return to the feast. As soon as the meal is despatched, there is quiet for a time, while exhausted nature recruits itself with a siesta. As soon, however, as the sun has well declined towards the west, every house is again in a bustle; men, women, and children put on their best. This is saying no slight thing, for the store of jewels is the store of wealth. Where banks are unknown, and the remembrance of plundering Mahrattas and Pindarries has not died away, wealth must be kept in small compass. It must not be trusted to the care of others. It is not long ago since every house had its cache\u2014a secret recess or pit, or may be some cunningly hidden hole under the wall, or among the roots of the mango\nor palmyra tree. On the eve of great festivals, the night was the scene of soft stealing to these hiding-places, and taking thence the jewels that were to give due honour to the day. When they were put away again, some moonless night was waited for, so that no neighbour or friend might have it within his power to confess, under the tortures of ingeniously cruel marauders, where the prize was secreted. Now, each house has its strong box, well clamped and bound with iron or brass, and guarded by some complex letter-lock, which no illiterate servant can decipher. The box is frequently the couch of its owner, so that it may not be stealthily conveyed away while he sleeps. However that may be, all its treasures are given up now, golden-threaded turbans, heavy bullioned sarees, rings for nose, ears, fingers, wrists, and ankles; chains for the neck; gold plates for the crown of the head, and jewelled rosettes for the forehead; buttons and rosaries of dragon guineas or Australian sovereigns\u2014all are produced and applied to the purpose for which they were designed; and soon the men appear, white and glistening, and the women bowing down almost under the weight of their ornaments. The occasion is a special one, so is the display. The Hindus are not a visiting nation by any means, and they suffer in consequence; for no nation can, with impunity, forget the great fact that mankind is one great family. The isolation which is produced by unsocial habits has been one great cause of the utter helplessness of the nation in the presence of invaders or usurpers. But in the Pongol we again see traces of better times, when, as a pastoral race, the Aryans knew how sweet was sympathy, how strong the tie of hospitality. The Pongol is one long series of visits, entertainments, and social joys. So now, when the air is cool and pleasant, the males of every family\u2014that is the young men\u2014proceed on a round of visits. In every case a present must be given and received. If the village be rural, and manners have not been corrupted by Western innovations, a couple of men with pipe, tom-tom or guitar, precede the party, and give notice of its coming. At Pongol every musician is fully employed, and the discord which fills the streets, while the visits are being paid,\nis ear-rending. The presents are borne by a servant, and consist of new chatties, spices, or other portable articles of value, proportioned to the means of the giver. When two parties meet in the street they halt, and a colloquy ensues after this fashion, \"Has the milk boiled?\" \"It has boiled through God's grace and your favour.\" \"Did the milk bubble soon?\" \"Yes, the deity is propitious, because of your favour.\" After a few more words, they each give the parting benediction\u2014\"May good luck rest on the year for you!\"\u2014and move on to fulfil their errands. At each house the same dialogue takes place. In every house of every street from tongue to tongue flies the same question, solemnly put, \"Has the milk boiled?\" Equally solemn comes the invariable answer, \"It has boiled.\" Even strangers meeting in the street ask and answer the question as they pass, it matters not what their caste. But I have forgotten the main object of the visit, to ask for \"the pleasure of their company\" at the evening's entertainment. With the latter the day closes, and before ten o'clock all respectable folk have retired for the night.\n\nWith earliest dawn on the following morning all are stirring. This, the third day of the feast, is M\u00e2\u021bu Pongol, or the Pongol of cattle. The slow but hard-working bullock is to have his holiday, though no little teasing, and perhaps torment, is first to give him a relish for his unwonted delights. In what follows we see again a time when cattle were the staff and stay of their masters\u2014when, without their milk and clarified butter, the gods could not be worshipped\u2014when those same things were food and wealth\u2014when without them no journey could be made in safety, no field could be ploughed, no fire could be made, and no corn could be trodden from the ear. So strong is the instinct, that the ceremonial belongs to another life and religion to that they now see in India, that, as far as I am aware, there is no legend at all widely received that attempts to account for the cattle holiday on Pauranic principles.\n\nAs soon as the male population have cleaned their teeth\u2014and the operation is so prolonged and elaborate that\nit deserves to take the highest place in the Hindu toilet\u2014they betake themselves to the nearest sacred tank, driving or dragging with them the whole bovine possession of the village. Now takes place a general wash. As on the previous days their masters had taken special care to ensure cleanliness of person, so now each cow and bullock must undergo a most searching lavatory process. A wisp of straw serves for the rubbing, and before long every part of the long-suffering animals is as clean as clean can be. Then all are driven home and the adornment commences. First the horns are carefully painted red, blue, green, or yellow. If the owner be rich, gold leaf is employed, or brilliant tinsel. Then heavy garlands of flowers are brought forth and placed on the horns, round the neck, or over the quarters of the patient beast. Meanwhile, the women have prepared another new chatty, filling it with water, and then steeping within some saffron, cotton seeds, and margosa leaves. When the water is yellow and bitter, it is ready. The master of the ceremonial, usually the head of the house, comes for it, and places himself at the head of a procession of all the men\u2014the women may not see the rite we now describe. In solemn silence they march round each animal four times, while the first man sprinkles the bitter water upon it and the ground as often as they pass the four cardinal points of the compass. This done, the pot is placed on the ground, and each male in turn performs to each animal the S\u0101h\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45gam or prostration of the eight members of the body. This is the highest possible token of reverence, and receives its name from the mode in which it is performed. The person first falls on his knees, and then, stretching out his arms, he bows to the ground until his forehead touches the soil. At the same moment by bending inwards, he causes his stomach to touch the ground, and thus at that instant, his feet, knees, stomach, forehead, and arms (from the elbow to the fingers), or eight members in all, are as lowly bent as is possible, betokening the greatest depth of humility and reverence. As Dubois very properly says\u2014\"It is used nowhere but in the presence of those to whom an absolute and unlimited deference is due.\"\nThis done, the public\u2014that is, the women and children\u2014are again admitted, and to the juveniles the most exciting ceremony of the feast is commenced. The patient cattle are led out one by one into the street, and there receive their final adornment. Strings of cocoanuts, plantains, bells, or anything else that will swing from neck or horns, are fastened as securely as may be under the circumstances. As will be imagined, the cattle are not very patient under the process, but they are usually very good-tempered and hurt no one. Soon every animal in the village is duly bedizened and discomforted. A moment of silence succeeds, while the villagers look on or wonder among themselves whose son will be most distinguished in the affray that it is to follow. Then, at a given signal, every rope is untied\u2014every tom-tom, pipe or guitar is banged or blown to the extreme of its endurance\u2014every woman screams and every urchin yells, and in an instant the herd\u2014hitherto so patient\u2014is careering down the street in an extremity of terror. But their flight brings new sufferings. The cocoanuts swing at every lurch, and bruise nose and knees, or thunder on the horns. New terrors urge on the crowd, for to every tail is clinging some eager boy, eager to rob the plantains, bells, or nuts. The glory of the day is, that every one who can may possess himself of whatever is carried by the cattle, and boast of his prowess and his spoils. No little skill and a vast amount of courage are shown by the \"timid\" Hindus in this dangerous and exciting pell-mell, and soon peace reigns again, when the oxen have returned to their pristine nudity. Their troubles are over, and a holiday of the best possible character succeeds. The cows may go where they like\u2014into field, garner, or shop. They may eat whatever their souls incline unto, so long as they can get it without help from men. The chetties (shopkeepers) tremble to-day; for many a sly push is given to direct the cattle to the stores of a hard creditor, or usurious grain-dealer, and woe be to the man if he would drive away by stroke or word the marauding bullock.\n\nThe next day is Kanru Pongol, or Pongol of calves. In this the rising herd receive treatment as kind and yet as\ncruel as fell to the lot of their parents on the preceding day. Again the boys gorge themselves with stolen, but well-earned fruit, and again there are a score of hair-breadth escapes from broken limbs or gored bodies.\n\nOn the evening of this day we find the only token of corruption in the ceremonial. In almost all the public festivals it is the custom for the Brahmans to carry the temple idols through the streets, attended by dancing girls, torches, blue lights, Bengal fires, and the dense but good-humoured crowd which the sight is sure to attract. After having thus perambulated the town, the images are carried back to their places and a great portion of the crowd is sure to enter the temples and make those offerings of pice, ghee, and rice, which it is the object of the priest to gain. On the last great night of Pongol, this ceremony is gone through. Both oxen and calves are collected at the end of the town, opposite to the temple, and then, in grand procession, come all the deities of the locality; the reflexion of the lights brightens the sky, as if some house were on fire. The crowd is so dense that locomotion becomes almost impossible, as the procession slowly surges along. At every hundred yards or so, a halt is made, and the dancing girls go through their most admired postures. It is the fashion to call these dances lascivious, and I may not run counter to it; but I have seen many a dance (at Nautch) in procession, and in the hall of some of the most ancient temples, without ever seeing anything that could by any possibility be called indecent. The postures resemble most of all the solemn minuets in which our grandmothers sailed across the floors of the ball-room, and are religious exercises compared with our polkas and waltzes. It is true that the songs are bad enough, but they are no worse than the stories contained in our university text books. Besides, even here the songs have the best of it, for the dancing girls suffer under the infirmity which afflicts almost all our own lady-singers, they cannot give the words of their songs so that they may be understood. Be this as it may, the procession creeps along till it reaches the assembled herd. A long halt is now made, and dances and songs begin afresh. Dubois describes a ceremonial as\noccurring at this time, which I have not seen; as, however, it is interesting, and the Abb\u00e9 is seldom incorrect, I will add the account in his own words (Dubois, 2nd ed., 1862, p. 286).\n\n\"The whole terminates with a piece of diversion, which appears to be waggishness, rather than any part of the ceremony. The numerous rabble who are present form themselves into a ring, and a live hare is let go in the midst of it. Poor puss, finding no outlet by which it can escape, flies to one side and the other, sometimes making a spring over the heads of the throng, which produces incredible mirth in the crowd, till the creature is at length worn-out and caught.\"\u00b9\n\nThe procession now wends its way back to the pagoda, and the outward ceremonial of the Pongol ceases. The whole population rests for three more days, and unlimited hospitality is the rule. Every evening is devoted to visiting, and usually a set of friends arrange that while each gives but one entertainment, the whole enjoy a feast every night. Caste is for the nonce forgotten, but as throughout the year intimate friendship has been limited by caste, and new friendships cannot be made all at once, it is not often that the ordinary rules of caste are absolutely broken. At every visit presents must be given and received, and as they frequently take the form of ornaments moulded in pure sugar, it may be imagined that the children have a fine time of it. On the evening of the last day there is a feast for the girls alone\u2014the only time in the year when their separate existence is remembered. They\n\n\u00b9 M. Sonnerat, who, in his \"Voyage aux Indes Orientales et \u00e0 la Chine\" (Paris, 1782), gives a brief account of the Pongol (vol. i. p. 240), mentions another ceremony in connexion, it would seem, with the one here described. He says\u2014\"Le soir on porte la figure du Dieu, processionnellement dans les campagnes. L'idole est plac\u00e9e sur un cheval de bois, dont les pieds de devant sont lev\u00e9s comme s'il galop\u00e2t, ceux de derri\u00e8re sont pos\u00e9s sur une table de bois, avec des sabots de bois, et une queue d'osier ou de jonc. Elle est mont\u00e9e comme un cheval qui se cabre et qui rue; l'idole tient une lance \u00e0 la main, et elle est cens\u00e9e aller \u00e0 la chasse; on tue un animal r\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour cette f\u00eate; il doit \u00eatre quadrup\u00e8de, choisi indiff\u00e9remment depuis le tigre jusqu'au rat. On examine surtout le c\u00f4t\u00e9 qu'il prend, quand on le l\u00e2che, pour en tirer des augures. Ce m\u00eame jour les Braumes jettent des sorts pour conna\u00eetre les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de l'ann\u00e9e suivante. Les animaux et les grains sur lesquels ils tombent, deviendront, disent-ils, tr\u00e8s-rares; si c'est sur les boeufs et le N\u00e9ly (riz en paillie), les boeufs p\u00e9iront et le n\u00e9ly sera tr\u00e8s-cher; s'ils tombent sur les chevaux et les \u00e9l\u00e9phants, c'est signe de guerre.\" I have made every inquiry regarding the practice described by Sonnerat, but can find no evidence that it is observed now.\nmay not go out, except to pass quickly from one house to another, and look forward with longing indescribable to this their solitary festivity. A picture of a peacock, resplendent with tinsel and colour, is hung up in one of the rooms, and as evening draws on, the girls assemble before it. They bow to the picture in turn, and imitate, as well as they can, the ceremonial adopted by their fathers and brothers in their worship. Sweetmeats are handed round, and if the host be rich, presents of cloth, jewels, bangles, &c., are made to each visitor. Then the house-mother tells some story about the blessings that must fall to an obedient wife; or perhaps the father reads a chapter from the more romantic portions of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata or R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. The evening winds up with chat as to the husbands each girl would like, or fears to have, and many a stern mother-in-law is dissected and favoured with due maledictions. By nine o'clock all good folks should be in bed, and before that hour the party has broken up.\n\nAs the last visitor enters the door of her home the Pongol ceases. The stern duties of life have been thrown into a week's arrears. Brahmanical and Pauranic ceremonial take the place of the simple Vedic festivity.

VI.\u2014Essay on the Creed and Customs of the Jangams.\n\nBy Charles P. Brown.\n\nThe various Brahmanical creeds prevailing among those Hindus who worship Vishnu and Siva have been amply illustrated by Colebrooke and other eminent scholars. When I was in England in 1836 the learned H. H. Wilson desired me to ascertain and describe the peculiarities of the Jangams or anti-brahmanical worshippers of Siva, whom he had but slightly noticed in his Essay on Sects, in the seventeenth volume of the Asiatic Researches.\n\nThere are brief notices regarding this sect in the Italian travels of Della Valle, (chap. xxii. Letter 5, of Nov. 1623) also in Buchanan Hamilton's description of the Mysore, written in 1800, in Colonel Wilks's Mysore, and in the Abb\u00e9 Dubois. These merely record the stories told by their enemies the Vaishnava brahmans. But wishing to learn their own tale I applied to the religionists themselves and shall record their statements.\n\nOriginally the Hindus in Southern India were partly Jainas, but some worshipped Siva, and a larger number adored the petty village goddesses, who are honoured even to the present day by Sudras and Pariars.\n\nThe Vaishnava religion was introduced in Southern India about the time when the first crusade in Europe began. A Jaina raja embraced it, between the years eleven hundred ten and eleven hundred twenty of the Christian era, changing his name from Betteda Raya to Vishnu Vardhana. The Jangam religion began soon after about the year eleven hundred and sixty.\n\nIt was instituted by Basava, the son of a Saivite brahman, a native of Bagwari in Belgaum, in the Southern Marata country. When he was a boy (the legends state) he refused\nto wear the brahmanical thread; because the rites that confer this mark of initiation require the adoration of the sun, in the manner prescribed in the Vedas. He then fled to Kalyanam, near Banavasi, in the Sunda country, where the reigning raja was Bijjala or Vizzala, a Jaina by creed, whose minister, a brahman, was Basava's maternal uncle and bestowed on him his daughter in marriage. On his decease Basava succeeded him as minister.\n\nHis father being a Saivite was a worshipper of the Lingam, the most ancient idol known among the Hindas: and which may be seen (a large block of marble) in the market-place of most Hindu villages. This symbol is as separate from indecency in the Hindu mind as circumcision is in the Musulman mind. The huge marble image (Sthivara lingam) is viewed with dread, and to move it is a crime. Drawings of it may be seen in Buchanan Hamilton's Eastern India, (which Montgomery Martin published as if he himself were the author) in Moor's Pantheon and Coleman's volume: and there are several images in the British Museum, at the India House and elsewhere. To shew his scorn of superstition Basava made images the size of an acorn, and distributed such to his followers, both men and women,\n\n'Hanging a golden stamp about their necks\nPut on with holy prayers.' (Macbeth iv. 3.)\n\nAnd this he called \"Jangama lingam\" as being peripatetic. He called himself and his followers Linge-jangams (not Jangams) or Lingavants: some call them Lingayats.\n\nThe adventures of Basava, and his death in A.D. 1168 (several with that of Thomas-a-Becket) are narrated in the Basava Puran: of which I many years ago printed an abridgment in English.\n\nThe learned Richard Payne Knight wrote an elaborate enquiry into the Symbolical language of ancient Art and Mythology: reprinted by an accomplished scholar Mr. H. Barker, in 1836. It is a pity a system so very ingenious should be utterly unknown to learned Hindas.\n\nIn reading their books written in Kannadi and Telugu\nmetre, I soon perceived why the Lingavants are abhorred by those who worship Vishnu and Siva.\n\nThe Brahmanical creed teaches the worship of the sun and fire; of many gods and goddesses; the system of castes; the doctrine of transmigration; the divine origin of Brahmans; their holiness; the terror of their curse; penances, pilgrimages, the sanctity of particular places; the inferiority of the female sex; the laws of consanguinity; the use of holy water; the entire system of feasts and fasts, purity and impurity; of omens; of lucky and unlucky days; the vast importance of funeral ceremonies.\n\nBasava rejected all these as useless delusions: he declared that all holiness consisted in three things \u201cGuru, Linga, Jangam\u201d\u2014that is The Guide, the image, and the fellow-religionist.\n\nThe Guide or Confessor may be any man or woman who is in the creed: who whispers the sacred (mantram) spell in the ear of the Jangam or worshipper: and hangs the image on the neck, or binds it on the arm. A guru is forbidden to eat flesh, to chew betel, or touch liquor.\n\nMarriage is held in high honour by orthodox Hindus. But in the South-west provinces the rite is merely nominal: and the woman is always free to take up with any man as soon as she is married\u2014except her husband. This pernicious fashion has been imitated by the Jangams, who began in that neighbourhood: they did this as an open defiance of Brahmanical tenets.\n\nBasava being by birth a Brahman had many friends and followers of that caste: who are called \u0100r\u0101dhya, meaning, Reverend. But these would not give up caste, and eat with Pariars. And they continued to wear the sacred thread laid on the shoulder, with the spell called G\u0101yatri. He admitted them as half converts: and they certainly are scorned by other Jangams as being neither one thing nor the other. Yet in the Prabhu Linga L\u012bl\u0101 (chap. 1,) Basava is characterized as an \u0100r\u0101dhya. No idolatrous creed is free from discrepancies.\n\nThe brahmanical funerals being performed with fire,\nBasava ordered that burial should be used: very probably imitating the Jews or the Musulmans. And the widows formerly were burnt alive: he allowed them to be buried alive: in either case all Hindus consider the woman a free agent, a voluntary suicide: such a death is always held in honour.\n\nBasava went further, and made an innovation shocking to all Hindus: for he permitted widows to marry again.\n\nTheir literature consists of less than half a dozen volumes: written in Kannadi, and translated into Telugu, Tamil and Marata. The oldest is the Basava Puran, containing about a hundred tales of their gurus, or saints: many stories are miraculous and several are comic parodies on legends in the Bhagavat or Ramayan. The language is rather antique: it dates perhaps from A.D. 1400.\n\nThe Chenna Basava Puran is a modernized comic version or imitation of this book.\n\nAlso the Pandit Aradhya Charitra, a voluminous but illiterate record which is their Golden Legend and is very dry reading. There are other smaller poems.\n\nThese books are chiefly read for amusement. In these anecdotes the brahmanical god Siva is often introduced, not as an object of reverence, but as a humble mean servant of the various \"Bhachts\" or Saints who work miracles; usually of a comic description. But there is nothing indecent or obscene.\n\nSome of the anecdotes are parodies of legends held in reverence by brahmans.\n\nThe Prabhu Linga Lil\u00e0 is the most pleasing of these volumes: in which the female sex is treated with respectful delicacy. This book describes the adventures of Allama who is represented as an incarnation of the deity. He becomes visible at the wish of Siva, in Kailasa or Olympus. There is no tale of his birth, death, or final disappearance. On one occasion he appears as Anteros, the Amricide, or Slayer of Lust: and the goddess May\u00e0 (or Delusion) is enamoured of his beauty. Then he disappears and visits a 'bhact' or devotee in a distant town: again vanishes and visits another: he assumes no pomp, has no followers, and manifests no power.\nBasava is a ruler, a warrior, a king's minister, the head of a family, fervent in his vows to nourish Jangams and to vanquish Jainas. But Allama is marked with peace, benignity, humility, and gentleness; he is perpetually sued by various female saints but remains unmarried; he has disciples, but no relations. He has an invulnerable body.\n\nPrecisely in this style do Musulman authors write regarding our Lord; and this may account for a Hindu poet's description of Allama: a character so strongly opposed to human nature as seen among Hindus. The Jangam authors strive in vain to account for the name; but it has occurred to me that Basava took it from 'A-la-ma' three mysterious syllables which commence the second sura of the Koran. See the Mishcat-ul-Musabih, Book viii. cap. 1, part 2, on Alif, L\u00e2m, M\u00eem.\n\nOriginating in the South-west of India, in the Kannadi country (which we call Carnatic), the Jangams are widely spread through the Dakhan, the Marata and Gujarati country, also among the Malayalas, Tamils and Telugus. At my request a Jangam poet wrote a Telugu metrical version of the Gospel of St. Luke which has been printed. But a German missionary informs me that he found the Jangams too proud to embrace Christianity: some few appeared willing to be baptized, but soon desisted, on finding that it would not suit the Epicurean liberty which they prize.\n\nIt remains to speak of \"The Four \u0100r\u0101dhyas,\" personages of great importance in the creed. These are named Revan \u0100r\u0101dhya, Marut \u0100r\u0101dhya, Ekor\u0101ma \u0100r\u0101dhya, and Pandit \u0100r\u0101dhya. These four appeared in four successive ages, as precursors of Basava. Among Jangams and \u0100r\u0101dhyas, at all their celebrations of marriage, birth, initiation, or funerals, four vases of water are solemnly set up in honour of these four: who seem to be like the \"Four Prophets\" (p\u00eer) of the Musulmans, described in p. 287 of the Customs of Musul-\n\n---\n\n1 Compare Dens, Theologia Moralis vii. 327 de dotibus corporis gloriosi. And compare the character of Siegfried of the Nibelungen Lied. In Wilson's Essay on Religious Sects of Hindus, article \"Yogis\" in a note he gives a genealogy of the N\u0101thas: the 8th is Goraksha; the 26th is Allama and the 26th is Prabhu Deva.\nmans, published by Dr. Herklots: or like the 'heft tan,' the 'seven bodies' buried at Shiras: who are much reverenced. In one point all these saints are alike: that nothing whatever is known about them.\n\nThe Jangams have not always adhered to the rules given by Basava. For, like other Hindus they celebrate the Sivar\u00e2tri feast which Tod, in his Rajasth\u00e2n, has so fully described. And they imitate their neighbours in making pilgrimages to Sri Sailam, K\u00e2labasti, and some other sacred places. I could easily have added many other particulars, but they might not seem worth perusal. Those who converse with Vaishnava brahmans will hear very rough language regarding the Jangams: but having been acquainted with both parties, and having written a translation of the L\u00eel\u00e2, I consider them quite as good as other Hindus: and the English who have occasion to study Telugu or Kannadi will find agreeable and profitable reading in the volumes written in verse by the Jangams.\nART. VII.\u2014On Malabar, Coromandel, Quilon, etc.\n\nBy C. P. Brown.\n\nThe Arabs and Africans who first visited the west coast of India, came \"Mu-abbar\": \"from beyond\" the sea. In the voyages of Ibn Batuta, translated by Dr. Lee, the country is called Muabbar, without any surmise that this is Malabar. The Syrian Christians who live in Travancore wrote the word in Syriac characters, and it has occurred to me that in careless writing this may have been altered into Malabar: a name unknown to the inhabitants; who fancy it is the European name for their country and language. The Eastern shore of India also was visited by men \"from over the sea:\" and the name Malabar has also been wrongly applied to the Eastern coast.\n\nBut the name underwent another change. The Tamils in those lands could not pronounce the ain, or the letter B, and Muabbar was softened into 'M\u0101pila' the name borne by these descendants of Africans: who are now called Moplas.\n\nThe children borne to these foreigners by Hindu women were in Hindi called \"Do-bhashi,\" or \"two-languaged;\" hence Dobhash, or Dubhash, an interpreter: bilingues is the phrase used by Virgil. This word also was hard to the Tamils, who could pronounce neither D nor Bh. They changed the word (such is my opinion) into To P\u0101si and hence the name Topass; which was applied afterwards to such persons of the mixed blood.\n\nThe name Maabar is correctly explained in Wright's edition of the English version of Marco Polo's Voyages, (in Bohn's Library, 12mo. p. 395): but in a learned essay translated from Arabic, in Prinsep's Journal of the Asiatic Society (Aug. 1836, p. 458) the coast is called M\u014dnib\u0101r: which is\nthere misprinted Monembar. The Arabs also called this country \u0628\u064a\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0641\u0644 Bilid ul Falfal, 'the land of pepper' (see Sir Wm. Jones's Description of India, chap. iii. which is in his Works xii. 387). The Hindus call the western r\u0113vu, or coast 'Korohi R\u0113vu,' which we call Cochin: while 'Calicut' is properly Kallee K\u014d\u1e6da; Aulay-polay has been corrupted into Alleppie; and Kollam is modernized into Quilon.\n\nA mile or two north of Madras-town there is a fishing village called Kuru manil \u0915\u0941\u0930\u0941\u092e\u0923\u093f\u0932 or 'Black sand;' the earliest Portuguese sailors pronounced this Coromandel, and called the whole coast by this name: which is unknown to the Hindus. At a later day 'Shozha Mandal' has been assigned, denoting 'the land of the grain called maize:' but that grain is peculiar to no district. Some have proposed the etymon 'Kuru-Mandal,' but the Kuru race were in the north not the south of India.\nART. VIII.\u2014On the Treatment of the Nexus in the Neo-\u0100ryan Languages of India. By John Beames, B.C.S.\n\nRead February 21, 1870.\n\nIn the following remarks the term \"nexus\" is employed to denote a conjunction of two or more consonants in one word without the intervention of a vowel, as \\(kt\\), \\(dhy\\), \\(rn\\), etc.\n\nI divide the neo-\u0100ryan languages of India into two classes. The Pr\u0101krits and P\u0101li are called the \"languages of the first period;\" Hindi, Beng\u0101li, \u016ariy\u0101, Panj\u0101bi, Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, Sindh\u012b, Gujar\u0101t\u012b, are the \"languages of the second period.\"\n\nIn assuming that the languages of the first period are later than Sanskrit, I do not lose sight of the fact that historically they were contemporaneous with it. But I call them \"neo-\u0100ryan,\" because the majority of their forms exhibit a decadence from some more perfect condition. It is true that not only in classical, but even in Vedic, Sanskrit forms are found which exhibit a perfect Pr\u0101krit type; but this does not prevent the general run of Pr\u0101krit from showing unmistakable signs of having degenerated from a purer and stronger ancient language, which we cannot call Sanskrit, because it is older still than even the language of the Vedas, and which therefore may, when necessary, be called \"Old \u0100ryan.\"\u00b9\n\nIt is a highly probable theory that the Old \u0100ryan, like all other languages, began to be modified in the mouths of the people as early as the Vedic period, and that the Brahmins, at a subsequent date, in order to prevent the further\n\n\u00b9 Es kann aber die Sprache wiederum, je h\u00f6her ins Alterthum aufgestiegen wird, als Dialect oder gar Mundart einer fr\u00fcheren, weiter zur\u00fcckliegenden erscheinen. Grimm, Gesch. d. Deutschen Sprache, p. 574 (\u00a727).\ndegeneration of their language, polished, elaborated, and stiffened it into the classical Sanskrit. We cannot, however, suppose that they brought any new material into the language, but simply that they reduced to rule what was till then vague and irregular, that they extended to the whole of the language euphonic laws which had been till then only of partial application, and so forth; all the while, however, only working upon already existing materials.\n\nIt will, therefore, not militate against the established contemporaneous existence of learned Sanskrit and popular Pr\u0101krit, to consider the former as in general the representative of the original Old \u0100ryan, and, consequently, as so far older than the Pr\u0101krit; because, ex hypothesi, in Sanskrit most of what existed in Old \u0100ryan has not only been preserved, but worked up and expanded, while in Pr\u0101krit, on the contrary, not only has much been absolutely lost, but that which remains has been corrupted and debased. Besides, as nothing whatever of the Old \u0100ryan has been preserved, or is likely to be discovered (although much may be, and has been, guessed at from analogy), we are driven, whether we like it or no, to look to Sanskrit for the oldest extant forms; and we do, undoubtedly, find them there, as contrasted with Pr\u0101krit and P\u0101li. In the following remarks, therefore, which make no pretence to rise to the level of the higher philology, I take Sanskrit as my starting-point, and place the Pr\u0101krits and P\u0101li on the first downward step, or, in other words, in the first period of Neo-\u0100ryanism.\n\nWith regard to the languages of the second period, it must be explained that I do not intend to touch on the obscure question of how far non-\u0100ryan elements enter into their composition. Much there is which is still doubtful, but this is admitted on all hands, that a very large proportion of their constituent parts is of \u0100ryan origin, and to that the present notes will be confined.\n\nIt has been customary with some writers to derive all the \u0100ryan words of the languages of this period from the Sanskrit through Pr\u0101krit; but on a closer survey, I think it will be seen that this idea is erroneous.\nThe languages of the first period have been studied, and the laws of their formation analyzed, and written down. Knowing this much, therefore, we can see that in the second period there are two grand classes of words, one of which has evidently been derived through the medium of Pr\u0101krit, the other not. It often happens that a Sanskrit word, for instance, re-appears in Hindi under two forms, one of which shows signs of having been in existence in the Pr\u0101krit period; while the other, by retaining consonants which have been lost in Pr\u0101krit, shows that it cannot have reached its present position through that language. As a general example, the word \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903 \u201ca house,\u201d may be given. This word in the first period becomes \u0917\u093f\u0939\u0903 and \u0917\u093f\u0939\u0903, with total loss of the cerebral semi-vowel. In the second period, however, the word appears as \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903 and \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903.\u00b9 The \u0930 could not here re-appear unless recourse had been had to the ancient Sanskrit fountains; and this opens the way to a theory which will account for the occurrence in the second period of words far better preserved than they are in the first. I conjecture that in the revival of Brahmanism which followed the expulsion from India of the Buddhists, efforts were made by the Brahmans to re-establish in the mouth of the people, in their pure Sanskrit form, words which they had long been familiar with in their corrupted Pr\u0101krit shape. It would be thought advisable to discountenance the use of words deeply impregnated with Buddhistic associations, the more so as Buddha had made the vernacular of his native province into a sacred language in opposition to Sanskrit. This practise of resuscitating words having once begun, has lasted down to our own times.\n\nWe find, therefore, three classes of words in the languages of the second period,\u2014\nFirst,\u2014Words which existed in Pr\u0101krit, and passed from and through it into the modern languages.\n\n\u00b9 Chand. Prithir. 23.20. One MS. reads \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903; another \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903; the whole passage is \u0906\u0926\u0940 \u091a\u0948\u0924 \u0938\u0941\u0939\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0940\u0964 \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903 \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0905\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0903\u0965 \u201cPleasant thoughts came\u2014in every house was joy.\u201d\nSecond,\u2014Words which have not passed through Pr\u0101krit processes at all, but came direct from Sanskrit, at the commencement of the second period.\n\nThird,\u2014Words imported at later dates from Sanskrit, chiefly by pedants, and which have therefore an artificial character and appearance.\n\nIn an investigation like this, which is still in its infancy, it would be, however, premature to lay down absolutely a date for the origin of the second period. We hold two ends of a chain, the centre of which is hid from us. We have at one end Sanskrit, the Pr\u0101krits, and P\u0101li, all languages of an inflectional character; by degrees we lose sight of them and several centuries of absolute darkness follow, and when light dawns again we find a mass of local tongues all more or less analytical in their type. When or how the change took place we cannot find out from any literary monuments. A long and patient inquiry may, however, hope at length to bridge over the chasm. The first step in such an inquiry is the analysis of the forms of stem words; that of grammatical forms is the second. The treatment of the nexus affords the most solid and important results to begin with; and it is to this point that I wish to contribute a few observations.\n\nThree kinds of nexus may be distinguished in Sanskrit.\n\nI. The strong nexus, i.e. the combination of two or more strong letters, e.g. \u0936\u094d\u0935\u0938, \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, \u0935\u0930\u0923, \u0918\u091f\u094d\u091f.\n\nII. The mixed nexus, i.e. the combination of a strong with a weak letter, e.g. \u092e\u093e\u0923\u093e, \u092c\u093e\u0923, \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0924\u094d, \u092c\u093e\u0923.\n\nIII. The weak nexus, i.e. the combination of two or more weak letters, e.g. \u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u092e, \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0915\u0943\u0924, \u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u092e.\n\nThe strong letters, it should be understood, are the letters of each of the five vargas, with the exception of the nasals; the weak letters are all the rest, viz., nasals, sibilants, semi-vowels, and the aspirate \u0937.\n\nThese three kinds of nexus differ from each other in their method of treatment, in both periods, in the manner which I now proceed to show.\n\u00a7 I.\u2014The Strong Nexus.\n\nA. In the First Period.\n\nThe treatment of the strong nexus is uniform and invariable throughout the first period. The rule, though variously stated by different writers, from Vararuchi downwards, is substantially the same; to wit, that the first member of the nexus is assimilated to the second: e.g. \u0915\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0924 becomes \u0915\u094d\u0930\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0924.\u00b9 The strong nexus is of rarer occurrence than the others, because it is limited by the euphonic laws of Sanskrit, which prohibit the combination of a media with a tenuis, or the placing of an aspirated letter as the first member in the composition.\n\nVararuchi in his third chapter gives a string of rules, arranged without much reference to the character of the nexus, but from which the following general view may be deduced:\n\n\u0915, \u0917, \u0922, \u0924, \u0926, \u092a, are elided before another consonant and the second letter is doubled. This is rather a round-about way of putting it, and he omits all mention of \u091a, \u091b, \u091d, and \u091e. In Pr\u0101krit \u092c is identical with \u0935, and the rules given for \u092c therefore apply; \u092c in iii. 3 is elided (or, as we should say, assimilated), whether it be the former or latter member of a nexus, and \u091a consequently does the same; thus, Skr. \u0932\u0941\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0915 tubdhaka = Pr. \u0932\u094b\u0927\u0915\u0940 loddhao, and Skr. \u092a\u0915\u0935\u093e pakwa = Pr. \u092a\u093f\u0915\u092e pikam; Skr. \u0932\u0941\u092d\u093e lubha = Pr. \u0932\u0941\u0927\u0940 luddho.\u2014Var. iii. 51.\n\nAs to \u0930 it so seldom occurs as the first member of a nexus (except in combinations where \u0936\u0937\u094d \u201csix,\u201d constr. \u0936\u0937\u094d forms the first element), that Vararuchi probably thought it useless to mention it. Similarly I am not aware of any cases where the palatals form the first member of a nexus. By Sandhi they would migrate into gutturals in composi-\n\n\u00b9 In virtue of this rule, we find in Pr\u0101krit that when the second member of a nexus is an aspirate, the first member is changed into the homogeneous lenis; thus, \u0915\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0924 kth = \u0915\u094d\u0930\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0924 tth, not \u0915\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0924, which would be an impossible nexus.\ntion; e.g., \u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u091a twach + \u0926\u094b\u0936\u093f\u0928 doshin = \u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u091a\u0926\u094b\u0936\u093f\u0928 twachdoshin,\n\u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f v\u0101kya + \u092f\u093e ya = \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f v\u0101ky\u0101. So that probably no instances exist of palatais as initials in a nexus. Vararuchi's examples are: \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092e\u0939\u0940, \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0935\u091a = \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0935\u091a\u0940, \u092e\u0941\u0930\u0917 = \u092e\u0941\u0930\u0917\u0940, \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0938 = \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0940, \u0916\u0921\u093c = \u0916\u0921\u093c\u0940, \u092a\u0942\u091c = \u092a\u0942\u091c\u0940, \u091a\u092e\u0915 = \u091a\u092e\u0915\u0940, etc.\n\nLassen, p. 239, repeats Vararuchi for the most part, but shows some consciousness of the difference between a strong and a weak nexus. He gives (p. 235) five classes of nexus, among which is No. II., \"Complexus consonantium quaternarum ordinatarum,\" which corresponds to my \"strong nexus.\" His list of examples is different from Vararuchi's, but does not add anything to the general rule already obtained from the Indian author.\n\nHoefer, de dialecto Prakrit\u0101, p. 90, \u00a7 73 b, gives a list of words in which the Sanskrit form of the nexus is retained in Pr\u0101krit, but this list has no value, as it rests upon incorrect readings. The principal instance is \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u092a in Vikramorva\u015bi, 110, 2 (edition Calcutta), which Lassen concludes to have arisen \"ob negligentiam editorum,\" or, perhaps, rather from the proclivity of the scribe towards Sanskrit forms, a fertile source of bad readings in the plays. We should undoubtedly read \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u092a\u0903. Hoefer's work does not appear to be one of much value.\n\nIf now we turn to P\u0101li and the Pr\u0101krit of the Jain writings, we find the same principle carried out. Instances from the Dhammapadam and Bhagavati (ed. Weber) are,\n\n\u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0928\u0947 = \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0928\u0947, \u092c\u0938 = \u092c\u0938, \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a = \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a (or in Bh\u0101g. \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0935\u0924\u0903), \u0935\u093e\u0938 = \u0935\u093e\u0938, \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0935\u093f\u0928 = \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0935\u093f\u0928\u0903, \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937 = \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937 (\u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920 is probably for \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920, hence the aspirate).\n\nP\u0101li seems to have the best claim to be considered as pure M\u0101gadhi, and in the Mahawanso, one of the chief works in that language, we find the same rule, e.g. \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0935\u093f\u0928 = \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0935\u093f\u0928\u0903, \u092c\u0938 = \u092c\u0938, \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937 = \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937. Numerous instances may be\n\n1 Vide Weber. \u00dcber ein fragment der Bhagavati, aus d. Abh. d. k. A. d. W. Berlin, I.

U. and B. \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924 in both senses.\n\nThe Sanskrit words \u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936, \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e, \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936, \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936, \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e occur in their original forms in nearly all the languages, but with slight modifications in some. They do not, however, offer much that is noteworthy.\n\nFrom the examples collected above certain laws may be deduced, keeping in mind the distinction already drawn between words which show traces of Pr\u0101krit influence (class 1), and those which do not (class 2).\n\nHindi, in class 1, rejects the first of the two consonants of Pr\u0101krit, and as a compensation lengthens the preceding vowel, e.g. \u0938\u093e\u0924\u094d, \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0942\u0933\u094d, \u092c\u0943\u0939\u0924\u094d, \u0917\u094b\u0932\u0924\u094d, \u092d\u093e\u0930\u094d, from \u0938\u093e\u0924\u0940, \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0940, \u092e\u0942\u0933\u0940, \u092c\u0943\u0939\u0924\u0940, etc. At the same time the final short \u0101 is cut off in nearly every instance in substantives, but not, as a rule, in adjectives.\u00b9\n\nIn class 2 the compound consonant of Sanskrit is split up by the insertion of a short \u0101, e.g. \u0916\u0930\u0917 kharag, \u0916\u0926\u0917 khadag, \u0916\u0926\u0917 cabda, \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924 bhakta. In the case of \u0916\u093e\u0902\u0921 kh\u0101nd, the last member of the nexus has been rejected, and the vowel lengthened, as in class 1, but this is merely an exception. In \u0916\u0941\u092c\u094d\u092c\u0924 also the last member has disappeared, but in place of the customary compensative lengthening of the vowel we have the well-known Hindi familiar or diminutive particle \u091c\u093e added, so that we may assume the existence of an intermediate form \u0916\u0941\u092c\u094d\u092c\u0924\u093e, which, however, is only found in Panjabi.\n\nThe series of \"seven\" and its derivatives belongs to\n\n\u00b9 In the case of adjectives the neuter in am appears to have been accepted as the basis of the modern system, just as in the Romance languages the Latin neuter in um has been selected, and results in a termination o. (That this o came from um, and not from the masculine ae, is proved by the existence in the earlier stages of the Romance languages of a separate masculine nominative in s, e.g. mails for maila.) The neuter am of Sanskrit modulates in the first instance into o, and in this stage Marathi, Sindhi, and Gujarati still have it, but in Hindi it has further migrated into \u0101.\nclass 1, in so far as it has everywhere lost its first member \u092a\u094d. This is only natural; a numeral being, next to a pronoun, the most commonly used description of word, and hence not to be changed by authoritative interference, such as I have assumed in the case of class 2.\n\nThe variations may be thus analyzed:\n\n- \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e satta-, in the words 70, 70th.\n- \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e sat\u0101-, in the words 7, 7th.\n- \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e sat\u0101-, in the words 27, 57, 87, 97.\n- \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e sat\u0101-, in the words 37, 47.\n- \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e sat\u0101-, in the words 17, 67, 77.\n\nOf these, \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e is simply the assimilated form of the first period, which in the compounds modulates into \u0939\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930, a form which is found even in the first period. This word is noticeable as the solitary instance in Hindi of a change of the initial \u0938\u094d into \u0939\u094d, though in Panjabi the change is so common as to be regular.\n\n\u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e is the regular form of the 1st class, like \u092d\u093e\u0924\u094d and others. In \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e we have rather a curious phenomenon which requires fuller analysis; the words are \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0924\u093f, \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0902, \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0902, \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0902. In the first period we do not uniformly find the long \u0905, e.g., satt\u0101v\u012b\u1e41\u015bat\u012bmo, 27th, but satt\u0101v\u0113ve, 97. But there is a remarkable uniformity in all the seven languages of the second period. We find the long \u0905 in all of them for 27; in all but Panj. and S. for 57; in all for 87 and 97.\n\nJudging at first from \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0924\u093f only, and the Hindi chiefly, I thought this abnormal long \u0905 arose from the \u0905 of \u0935\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0924\u093f amalgamating with the inherent \u0905 of \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e, first from au (satt\u0101vinsati) into au (satt\u0101vais), and thus, according to the usual Hindi analogy, into \u0905. But this suggestion broke down in two ways\u20141st. Because the Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b has both the long \u0905 and the \u0909 in \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0924\u093f; so also have the Sindhi and Gujar\u0101t\u012b; and 2nd. Because we have the long \u0905 in words where there existed originally no \u0909 to coalesce with it into au.\n\nThe opinion I am at present most inclined to is that the presence of the long \u0905 is due to the accent of the Sanskrit.\nSaptan is undoubtedly oxytone, and though I have not been able to find in the dictionaries or other published works any instance in which the accent of saptavin\u1e63ati is given, yet I have no reason to doubt that, as in Greek, the accent remains in the compound word just as it stood on each member when separate. In Greek the rule which forbids us to place an accent further back than the ante-penultima obscures the analogy, but in Sanskrit we have no such restriction, and \"saptavin\u1e63ati,\" with the major accent on the penultima, and the minor on the prae-ante-penultima is quite possible. Assuming this, and seeing that the two last syllables \"ati\" have disappeared, the word would fall into the form of a paroxytone, and the accent on the syllable ta being the only one left, would assume such prominence as to insure its remaining long throughout the ages. I own I was unwilling to admit this possibility of the influence of the accent, and sought for some time for another solution; I was unwilling to admit into the discussion of a question, already sufficiently complicated, the disturbing influence of another unknown quantity in the shape of the Sanskrit accent; but I fear there is no help for it. That a subtle and apparently irregular system of accents haunts and flavours the pronunciation of modern Hindust\u0101n\u012b is as evident as in the case of modern Greek. Why do we say k\u0101h\u0101n, laying the accent on the first syllable though short? why k\u0101ho, not kah\u014d? why a dozen other anomalies? This unwelcome conviction thrusts back my lucubrations on the nexus till the Sanskrit scholars of Europe are kind enough to dig out and impart to us more facts and laws about the accents of that language.\n\nWe next come to the curious form \u0936\u0943\u0902, only found in 37 and 47. In these two sets of numbers we find that all the odd numbers except the first take this form in ain, thus,\n\n| 33. \u0924\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0938 | taintis. |\n| 35. \u092a\u0948\u0924\u093f\u0938 | paiitits. |\n| 37. \u0938\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f\u0938 | saintis. |\n| 43. \u0924\u0940\u0924\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0938 | taitatalis. |\n| 45. \u092a\u0948\u0924\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0938 | pa\u00eftatalis. |\n| 47. \u0938\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0938 | sa\u00efntatalis. |\n\nThe other languages offer only faint indications of simi-\nlarity. P. has \u0938\u0902\u0924\u094b, B. \u0938\u093e\u0902\u0924\u094b, U. \u0938\u0902\u0924\u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f, but none of the others. I think it has arisen from a sort of rhyming propensity, sometimes observable in Hindi. From \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f or \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f the transition to \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f was easy, the insertion of the nasal in season and out of season being a weakness of that language. In the word for 35 they had at first panchatriinsat, which soon got altered into panchtis; but here they had a strong nexus, \u091a+\u0924\u094d. The \u091a therefore dropped out, and the resulting double \u0924 was reduced to a single, and the preceding vowel compensatorily lengthened, so that the form \u092a\u093e\u0902\u0924\u0940\u0938 arose; to make which rhyme with the word for thirty-three would be irresistible. So also the 37, which was probably \u0938\u093e\u0924\u0940\u0938, was dragged into the scheme, and became \u0938\u0948\u0924\u0940\u0938.\n\nThe only remaining form \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e is found in 17, 67, 77. In 67 the word was originally sapt\u0101\u015ba\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, with two accents close to one another, the latter of which, so to speak, kills the former, so that when by the usual Prakrit process the first member is modified into satta, the second a, being atonic, falls out; and though the first t also falls, yet, as it is in the first syllable of two, the latter of which is accented, no compensatory lengthening can take place.\n\nIn 77 we ought to have \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e, and probably such a form did once exist, but was crushed into sat by the weight of the double tt of hattar so close after it. Only Marathi retains a form satyadhattar. Similarly, the form for 17 was originally satt\u0101ra\u1e25, and is so still in Panjabi; perhaps some obscure idea of its similarity in sound to sattar, \u201cseventy,\u201d may have operated in the minds of the people to shorten it. For your Hindustani is a dreadful jingler: he twists his words into absurd semi-rhymes, as bortan-ortan, for bortan, \u201ca plate;\u201d g\u0101r\u012b-w\u0101r\u012b, for g\u0101r\u012b, \u201ca cart;\u201d ult\u0101-pult\u0101, for ult\u0101, \u201creversed,\u201d and so on.\n\n[Here, for the present, I must stop, reserving the analysis of the mixed and weak nexus for a future occasion, as I am obliged to return to India immediately. I hope to be able in a few months to send home the remainder of the argument, together with the rules deducible therefrom.]\nART. IX.\u2014Some Remarks on the Great Tope at Sanchi.\nBy the Rev. S. Beal.\n\nDr. Fergusson's book on \"Tree and Serpent Worship\" has opened a large field for inquiry and research. After looking through the photographs and lithographed scenes relating to the Sanchi Topes, two questions naturally suggest themselves, viz.: What was the idea which suggested the peculiar form of the Indian Tope? and, What are the scenes so carefully represented on the rails and gateways at Sanchi and Amravati?\n\nWith respect to the first question there is no need to say much, as at best we can only speculate where there is no possibility of proof. But it would seem that the symbolism of the Tope is like that of other sacred edifices, viz., to figure out an idea of the world, or the heavens and the earth. R\u00e9musat, in one of the valuable notes found in the Fo-koue-ki (p. 92), has observed: \"St\u016bpas are not erected on the tombs of religious persons or laymen, but only simple stones, which by their form symbolize the five elements, viz.: ether, wind, fire, water, and earth; they are called St\u016bpas by analogy. Their figure is this: The lowest portion represents the earth, this is surmounted by the emblem of water; the triangle represents fire, the crescent is wind, and the cone denotes ether. Hence, instead of Chinese characters, it is the custom to inscribe on these several portions of the monument Sanscrit characters indicating the several elements; on the highest the letter \u0905 to indicate 'ether,' on the second \u0906 to denote 'wind,' on the third \u0907 to denote 'fire,' on the fourth \u0914 to denote 'water' (sc. Varuna), and on the lowest the letter \u0905 [which being the first vowel symbol-\nizes the first element, i.e. earth]. This quotation has been noticed by Dr. Fergusson (p. 106, *Tree and Serpent Worship*), but he simply founds on it a theory for the origin of the Trisul. I would rather see in this record an explanation not only of the earliest religious structures, symbolical of the Elemental Universe or Nature, but also of the Tope. The Great Sanchi Tope rests upon a square base or plinth 14 feet high and 121 feet square, round which is a procession path 5 feet 6 inches wide. This portion of the building would therefore symbolize the first element, \"earth.\" Above the square rises a great dome or hemisphere to a height of 39 feet. This dome represents the second element, \"water.\" It would be impossible to place a complete circle of stone on the square plinth, the hemisphere therefore is used to indicate the element.\n\nDr. Muir has observed, that \"when the idea of Varuna as the all-embracing Heaven had been established, and on the other hand the observation of the Rivers flowing towards the ends of the earth and to the sea had led to the conjecture that there existed an Ocean inclosing the earth in its bosom, then the way was thoroughly prepared for connecting Varuna with the Ocean.\" [Compare the entire account given by Dr. Muir, J.R.A.S. vol. i. part i. N.S. pp. 77, ss.]\n\nAbove the dome, at Sanchi, we have a Toran, respecting which I will quote from Hodgson: \"Between the hemisphere and the pyramid is a short square basement for the latter, upon each of the four sides of which a pair of eyes is graved.\" The hemisphere is called the 'garbh,' the basement the 'Toran,' and the pyramid the 'Chura-mani' (p. 43, Collected\n\n---\n\n1 I refer to Logan stones, etc., but principally to those primitive structures called \"Baitulia\" or \"Bortyia.\" I take the rows of stones represented in p. 206 of Sir J. Lubbock's work \"On the Origin of Civilization, etc.,\" to be Bortyia, or \"mounted stones\"\u2014the red mark round the black (which Colonel Forbes Leslie compares to \"spots of blood\") being in fact the \"marks of consecration\" or \"amounting.\" It is well known that \"idols\" or \"josses\" in China are consecrated by a dash of red or vermilion across the eye. With regard to the derivation of the word \"Bortyia\" as signifying \"elemental stones,\" whilst it is generally referred to a Semitic root, I venture to suggest \u092e\u0924 + \u0930\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0937 or \u0930\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0937, as denoting that these stones in the first instance represented the \"Elemental World.\"\n\n2 These eyes evidently denote the watchful care of the \"Four Kings\" (Chaturmaharajahs) over the affairs of men.\nThe T\u00f4ran is merely a contraction of the Sanscrit T\u00f4ranya or T\u00f4rana [\u0924\u094b\u0930\u0923], \"an ornamented gate or entrance,\" and denotes the entrance or door to the abode of the celestials.1 [Around Japanese temples are erected gateways called \"T\u00f4ris,\" evidently derived from the same root.]\n\nAbove the T\u00f4ran rises the pyramid or cone, which Hodgson calls the Chura-mani, [\u091a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0923\u093f] denoting the element \"fire;\" and above this the mysterious Trisul, combining the two elements of \"air and ether,\" and used by accommodation as the emblem of the \"Highest.\" If these several elemental emblems be thus united, we have the figure of the \"Tope.\"\n\nIn confirmation of this argument, we observe that Mr. B. Hodgson explains the division of the cone which surmounts the \"garbh,\" or \"dome,\" of the Tope, as symbolical of the thirteen heavenly mansions above the sky (p. 43, Collected Essays). But if this be the true explanation, it seems to follow that the lower portion of the Tope must represent the \"lower world.\"\n\nThis opinion is borne out by the use of the word \"ts'a,\" in Chinese, for a Pagoda, or Tope. This symbol represents the Sanscrit \"kshetra,\" a land of Buddha,\" and comprehends the entire chilicosm, over which S\u00e2kya Tath\u00e2gata is supposed to rule. Now this was the idea of the expanded form of the Tope, from which the Pagoda, in China, is derived; but the expansion of an idea necessarily assumes\n\n---\n\n1 Compare the remarks of Mr. Baring-Gould (\"Origin of Religious Beliefs,\" pp. 98, 99): \"The localization of the Deity in heaven gave birth to a number of other names. From the first moment that the consciousness of a God rose upon man's soul, like the morning sun, he lifted his head on high and sought him in the sky. That vast uplifted sphere, now radiant with light, now twinkling with countless stars, attracted the wonder of mankind, and it was placed the house of his gods. Heaven was an upper world inhabited by Deities. The Ethiop supposed it to be a blue Tent, behind which Ukko the Ancient, and the sustainers of Sun, Moon, and Stars and the guardians of the clouds, dwelt in splendour. Men for a long time supposed that the earth was a flat plane, surrounded by the sea, and that the sky was a roof on which the heavenly bodies travel, and from which they are suspended as Lamps. The Polynesians, who thought, like so many other peoples, ancient and modern, that the sky descended at the horizon and inclosed the earth, will call foreigners popotangi, or heaven-boundaries, because they came from another world or country. The sky is to most savages what is called in a South American language something that is, the-earth-on-high [compare \"heaven,\" that which is \"heaved up\"]. There are holes or windows through this roof or firmament, where the rain comes through, and if you can climb high enough, you can get through and visit the dwellers above, who live, and talk, and look, very much like people upon earth.\"\nthe germ as a constant, and this germ I take to be the primitive symbolism of which we are speaking.\n\nThis position is strengthened by some indirect considerations; take, for example, the description of the kshetra of the Tath\u0101gata Padmaprabha, found in Burnouf, *Lotus*, f. 38, b. The kshetra, we must bear in mind, is the Chinese ts'a, and this is the common term for a Pagoda or Tope. Now, the *Lotus* describes the land of Padmaprabha in the same terms as the Chinese accounts represent the \"happy lands\" or \"domains\" of the various Buddhas, \"surrounded by inclosures, and rows of trees covered with flowers and fruits, the whole composed of the seven precious substances;\" but the *Lotus* adds a peculiar item in this description, \"the inclosures are traced in the forms of a square draughtsboard\" (\"d'etoffe a carreaux pour jouer aux dames ou aux d\u00e9s,\" *Lotus*, note, p. 363). If we now turn to the 88th plate, fig. 1, *Tree and Serpent Worship*, we see at once that the inclosure of the Amravati Tope was precisely planned according to the description of the inclosure of a kshetra of Buddha. The Lotus-discs, in the plates 48, 49, etc., are precisely the \"asht\u0101pada\" of the *Lotus*, the discs representing \"draughts\" as they are carved even down to this day in the East. We argue, therefore, that the inclosure at Amravati was designed to represent the inclosure of a Buddha-kshetra, and if so the Tope itself symbolized the kshetra.\n\nThis is illustrated further by *Figs. 1 and 2, Plate xci.*, of the same work. Dr. Fergusson speaks of \"the crowd of umbrellas which crown the Tee in these cases as a curious ebullition of Hindu fancy;\" but I conceive the intention was quite in agreement with the general symbolism of the structure. The single umbrella (chhatra) denoted dominion over \"one world;\" the exaggerated system of worlds, known as a chiloecosm (of which such repeated mention is made in all the later Buddhist S\u016btras), was, therefore, denoted by the \"crowd of umbrellas,\" which we see in *Plate xci*. And the rule of increase will be observed, from the single chhatra to four, (denoting the four cardinal points), and from four to eight\n\n---\n\n1 Translated, we must remember, from Sanscrit.\n(including the half points), and from eight to an indefinite number, agreeing accurately with the actual expansion of belief which occurred (relating to the composition of the Universe) in the History of Buddhism.\\(^1\\)\n\nBut the general argument that religious structures were in the first instance symbolical of the upper and lower world, is strengthened by considering that this was the allowed meaning of the figure and furniture of the Jewish Tabernacle. Josephus and Philo Judeus both assert the fact, and it is insisted on by the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Cosmas also, in his Topographia, labours to prove that the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a pattern of the Universe (Yule's Cathay, etc., xlvii). We are told by Porphyry (de antro Nymphaeum), that Zoroaster consecrated a natural cell, adorned with flowers, to Mithras, for he thought a cavern to be a fit emblem of the world fabricated by Mithras. Plutarch, in his account of the old Temple of Vesta, says it was constructed of an orbicular form, to shadow out by its shape not so much the world as the Universe (de Iside et Osiride, p. 67; Maurice, Indian Antig., iii. p. 504). And Maurice concludes generally that all circular temples symbolized the Universe (iii. 508).\n\nSo, again, says Pliny, when speaking of the Pantheon, \"the dome was of a convex form, that it might be the model of the Heavens\" (ut fastigiatam celli similitudinem ostenderet) [quoted by Maurice, as above]. Such are some general observations in proof of the theory that we may detect the idea of a cosmographic symbolism in all sacred structures, and not the least in the form and developed portions of the Indian Tope.\n\nI proceed to make some reference to the scenes of the sculptures on the gates and beams at S\u00e2nci. But before doing so, I would start the query, whether there is any proof to be gathered from the character of these sculptures, that the followers of Buddha worshipped either the Tree or N\u00e2ga? If they did, nothing in the world would more effectually destroy the theory of their religion. The Buddhist convert, theoretically at least, acknowledged no superior to himself in heaven or earth. The N\u00e2gas were saved from the power\n\n\\(^1\\) This expansion is fully related in all the later S\u00fbtras. Vid. s.gr., Lotus, p. 113.\nof the Garu\u1e0das by believing in Buddha, and becoming his disciples; and as for Trees, in so far as they were associated with the history of the emancipated Buddha, doubtless, they were \"objects of worship,\" but it was a worship of association, just as the wayfarer bows before the symbol of the Cross, or as the pilgrim, on the first glimpse of the sacred city, flings himself on the earth. We do not worship the building in which we say our prayers; it is a sacred building, just as the Tree in the eyes of the Buddhist was a \"sacred tree,\" but he did not worship it.\n\nBut to pass on to some identifications. The scene depicted in Fig. 2, Plate xxxii., is a lithograph taken from one of the sculptured architraves of the Northern Gateway, rear-view; it is not copied from the photograph, but is the only part of the horizontal architraves drawn by Colonel Maisey; the difficulty of getting up to them was so great, that nothing more than this was attempted; it is, however, a very valuable excerpt, and helps to unriddle the entire scene, which occupies both the front and rear face of the beam. Both these scenes embody the history of S\u0101kya, when he was born as Vessantara. This birth was the one immediately preceding his incarnation as Buddha. It will be necessary to make some reference to this J\u0101taka, so far as it is related or referred to in works bearing on the subject. Burnouf (Lotus, 411) refers to it in these words: \"C'est dans ce sens que Mah\u0101n\u0101ma parle de la derni\u00e8re existence de S\u0101kyamuni, avant qu'il vint au monde comme fils du roi Suddhodana, 'vessantarattabhb\u0101v\u0113 thit\u014d,' quand il \u00e9tait dans le corps de Vessantara. On sait en effet que Vessantara est, chez les Bouddhistes de Ceylon, le nom d'un personnage sous la figure duquel l'\u00e2me de S\u0101kyamuni parut au monde.\" Again, this J\u0101taka is referred to by Bigandet (Legend of the Burmese Buddha, p. 83) in these words, \"Without alluding to those great offerings I have made during several previous existences, I will but mention the seven great ones made whilst I lived as Prince Wethandra (Vessantara).\"\n\n1 In cases where the N\u0101ga, the Horse, the Throne, etc., occupy the place of honour on the Dugoba (as in Plates lxxx., xc., etc., Tree and Serpent Worship), I should suppose the association to be with the history of Nuchilinda, Kuptaka, the Vajrasana, etc.\nAgain, on p. 165 of the same work, we read, \"He then caused a shower of red rain to pour down over the assembled multitudes... This is not, said Buddha, the only time when such a wonder has happened; the same thing once took place when I was Prince Wethandra. He went on relating the most interesting circumstances of that former state of existence.\"\n\nAgain, in the account of the mission of Song-yun, p. 195 (Travels of Buddhist Pilgrims), we have an allusion to the sacredness of the spot, where Vessantara underwent his self-imposed sufferings. This place, according to Julien, was called Dantal\u014dka (Jul. ii. 122). The Prince, both in Song-yun and Julien, is called \"Sudatta,\" but I have identified this personage with Vessantara (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 194, note), on grounds that will not be disputed. But, finally, the best and fullest account of the Vessantara J\u0101taka is found in Hardy's Manual, p. 116. It will be necessary, for the purpose of identification, to give a pr\u00e9cis of this relation. \"In former times, in a city called Jayatur\u00e9, reigned a king called Sanda or Sanja; his principal queen was called Phusat\u00ed, and their son was called Wessantara, so named from the street in which his mother was passing at the time of his birth. [Observe the very curious similarity between this name and Wessanagara, the old Besnagar, close to S\u0101nchi; compare Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 90.] From the moment he could speak he gave proof that his disposition was most charitable. [Compare the Chinese Shen-chi, \"the charitable one\" (Song-yun, p. 194).] When arrived at the proper age he married Madri-d\u00e9wi, the daughter of the King of Chetiya. [Compare, again, the singular coincidence in the account of Mah\u0101n\u0101ma: \"Asoka, when sent to be Governor of Ujjeni, tarried at Chaityagiri, and there married Devi, the daughter of the chief.\"] They had a son J\u0101liya, and a daughter Krishnajin\u0101. At this time there was a famine in K\u0101linga from the want of rain; but the king, having heard that Wessantara had a white elephant that had the power to cause rain, sent eight of his Brahmins to request it. Wessantara at once gave it up, on which he was banished from the kingdom to the rock Wanka-giri. His\nwife, Madri-dewi, refused to forsake him, on which all their treasures were collected and given away in charity to the mendicants, and they, with their two children, retired into banishment. The nobles then brought a chariot, and Madri-dewi, taking her daughter in her arms, and her son by his hand, entered it. Two Brahmans followed them, and requested the gift of the horses that drew the chariot. Without hesitation they were given, but Sekra, observing what was taking place, sent four Dewas under the disguise of horses, that yoked themselves to the chariot and drew it. Again, another Brahman cried, 'Sir, I am old, sick, and wearied, give me your chariot.' The chariot was readily given up. The Prince then carried his son, and the Princess his daughter, and so set off on their journey to Wanka-giri. Wiswakarma had prepared for them two Pansals (leafy huts). Here they dwelt with their children in the garb of ascetics. At length an aged Brahman, called Jujaka, set out to ask the gift of the two children, as slaves. Wessantara, in the absence of his wife, resolved to give up the children, who had fled away and hid themselves. He went forth and called them back and delivered them to the Brahman. The children, however, seeing the Brahman stumble and fall as he went down the hill, ran away and came back to their father; the father again gave them up, and the Brahman, tying their hands together, drove them along with a stick, beating them as they went. At length, when Madri-dewi was about to return home, Sekra sent four Dewas to assume the form of wild beasts, to delay her return. When Sekra perceived that Wessantara had given away the children, he assumed the appearance of an aged Brahman, and went to the rock. Wessantara asked, 'Why have you come?' To which he replied, 'I have come to receive the Princess as my slave.' On this he gave her up also. As the result, both Madri-dewi and the children were restored to Wessantara, and all returned safe and sound to Jayatara.\"\n\nLet us now compare this account with the sculptures. We read (p. 101, *Tree and Serpent Worship*), \"the central compartment of this beam has on its right the gateway and\nbuildings of a walled city [Jayaturd]. Inside are numerous spectators, and some figures apparently doing homage to two sacred elephants or their riders. [The two elephants differ from the account in the J\u0101taka, where only one is mentioned.] Near the outside of the gate stands a male personage, wearing the Dhoti and large turban [Vessantara], attended by respectful figures in various attitudes. The Chaori and Chatta which accompany him mark him either as a king or a saint. There are also a number of women with covered jars or vases. [Madri-devi giving away her treasures.] Next appears a four-horsed chariot of a different shape from those seen elsewhere. It contains a man dressed as above, attended by Chatta and Chaori bearers, and two children with tufts or plumes on their heads. [Madri-devi and her husband, with their two children.] On the left, another stage of the ceremony is apparently represented. The same chariot is seen unharnessed, the yoke held up by a woman. The two children still occupy it, but the king, or whoever he may be, is standing near the pole with his arm stretched over the yoke, and is apparently conferring some grant or gift to the priest or ascetic before him, into whose hand he is pouring water, an ancient mode of sealing a gift. [Vessantara giving away his horses.] The costume of this last figure is what is usually seen in the only class that can be identified with priests, ascetics, and saints. Above this group, and facing towards the city, is another empty chariot, which a man, dressed as the preceding, is about to harness. [The four Devas sent by Sakra in the shape of horses.]\n\nThis portion of the scene is tolerably complete. Colonel Maisey refers the plot to the dedication of the chariot to the Sun. Dr. Fergusson regards it as a meeting between Asoka, or some Hindu prince, with the Dasyn chief of the place. It is tolerably plain, however, that the scene represents the first part of the history of Vessantara. Let us now turn to Plate xxxii. Fig. 2, which is a lithograph representing the rear-view of the same architrave. On the extreme right we observe the two Pansals, built by Visvarkarma. Vessantara and Madri-devi are seen on the left in their social relations, sitting to-\ngether in front of one of the Pansals (in which scene Madri-\ndevi is probably relating her dream), and also engaged below\nin some domestic pursuits with their fire-pot and chatties. A\nlittle further on the left we see Vessantara sealing the gift\nof his children to the Brahman, by pouring water on his\nhand. Further to the left we see the Brahman beating the\nchildren with a stick because they had run away from him.\n[Compare Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 195.] On the left, again,\nwe see Vessantara giving away his wife to Sakra. In the\nupper division of the scene we observe the beasts sent by\nSakra to delay the return of Madri-devi; whilst the Brah-\nman with his water vessel, plotting to arrive when Madri-\ndevi is out, is seen in close contact with the lady; the\npresence of the water vessel in his hand illustrates the\ntext of the J\u0101taka, \u201cWhen the prince saw the Brahman\napproaching, he told his son J\u0101liya to go and meet him and\ncarry his water vessel.\u201d The scenes on the extreme left re-\npresent the happy termination of the whole adventure, and\nthe restoration of Vessantara, children, wife, and elephant, to\nthe kingdom of Jayat\u016bra.\n\nThere can be no reasonable doubt, I think, that this is the\nreal history of the sculptured scene on this architrave, rear\nand front. It follows, then, and this is an important con-\nsideration, that whatever age is assigned to the gateways of\nthe S\u0101nchi Tope, the same antiquity, and greater, must be\ngranted to the J\u0101takas in point. And if to the J\u0101takas, then\nto all the legendary history of Buddha. This explanation\nalso militates against the theory of a Dasyu element in these\nsculptures. The Dasyus, in fact, are Buddhist mendicants.\n\nI am inclined to refer the scene, Plate xxxvi. Fig. 1, to the\nS\u0101ma J\u0101taka. This fable is given by Spence Hardy (Eastern\nMonachism, p. 275) in these words, \u201cWhen G\u00f4tama Bodhisat\nwas born in a former age as S\u0101ma, son of the hermit Dulhula,\nhe rendered every assistance to his parents, who had become\nblind when he was sixteen years of age. It happened that as\nhe went one day for water to the river, the king of Benares,\nPiliyaka, entered the forest to hunt, and as S\u0101ma, after ascend-\ning from the river, was as usual surrounded by deer, the king\nlet fly an arrow which struck S\u00e1ma just as he was placing the vessel to his shoulder. Feeling that he was wounded, . . . he called out, 'Who is it that has shot me?' and when he learned that it was the king, he related his history to the monarch, and said that his greatest grief arose from the thought that his blind parents would now have no one to support them. When the king perceived the intensity of his grief, he promised that he would resign his kingdom, and himself become the slave of his parents. Meantime a Dewi, descending from the Dewa loka, remaining in the air near the king without being visible, entreated him to go to the Pansal, and minister to the wants of the blind parents of S\u00e1ma. He was obedient and went. . . . The body of S\u00e1ma having been brought to the huts, was restored to life by the united Sachikeriyas of the Dewi and the parents. The parents also received their sight, and the Dewi repeating the ten virtues of a king to Piliyaka, enabled him to reign in righteousness, and after death to be born in heaven.\"\n\nIn the Lithograph referred to, we observe the parents of S\u00e1ma seated outside their Pansals. They are evidently blind, for the monkeys are stealing the fruit and playing mischievous tricks close to their persons without interference. In front of their huts is the forest, full of deer. The river flows through it, and we observe S\u00e1ma just coming from the bank and raising the water vessel to his shoulder. The Devi (or Deva), standing close to the boy (and probably unseen by him), is introduced to indicate the pious act of the child, and the reverence due to such piety. On the left of the scene is the same boy, wounded by an arrow: his identity with the first figure is shown not only by the likeness and dress, but by the water vessel lying on the bank, evidently fallen from his shoulder at the moment when he was shot. The archers are just above. It does not appear that the king is one of them, but this is not material to the history. In the rear, on the left, we see the king, with his water vessel, ready to resign his kingdom, and become the slave of the blind hermits. The Devi is standing close by. Finally, in the left corner, we see the happy termination, the parents\nrestored to sight, and the boy come back to life. This comparison appears also tolerably evident, and tends again to establish two points\u20141. The primitive age of the J\u0101takas; and 2. The style of dress worn by Buddhist hermits, viz., the kilt and a sort of sarang worn over the left shoulder (probably from motives of modesty).\n\nI now pass on to identify some other scenes, beginning with the Northern Gateway. The subject of the top rail is adoration to five Dagobas and two trees. To illustrate this, compare Bigandet (Legend of the Burmese Buddha, p. 100), and Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p. 51). Fah-Hian (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 125) also mentions the several localities round the sacred tree, consecrated by the erection of towers or Dagobas. There are two lists of seven places; first of all those spots which were the scenes of events previous to Buddha's inspiration; and, secondly, seven others sanctified by his presence after arriving at complete wisdom. The two lists are as follows:\n\nFirst List.\n\n1. The place where he practised austerities for six years.\n2. The place where he bathed and the Deva assisted him.\n3. The place where the two shepherd girls gave him milk and rice.\n4. The place where he ate the rice.\n5. The place where he sat at the entrance of a cave.\n6. The place where the Devas gave him the grass mat.\n7. The place where he sat under the Pei-to tree.\n\nOn each of these spots, Fah-Hian says, towers are erected.\n\nSecond List.\n\n1. Where he sat for seven days beholding the B\u00f3dhi tree.\n2. Where he walked for seven days.\n3. Where the Devas built him a hall.\n4. Where the Dragon Muchalinda protected him.\n5. Where Brahma saluted him.\n6. Where the Four Kings gave him an alms-bowl.\n7. Where the merchants brought him wheat and honey.\nFrom these lists we may select most of the incidents sculptured on the S\u00e2nci gates.\n\nAnd so we have in the Burmese Life of Gau\u1e0dama, by Bishop Bigandet, a list of seven trees, under which certain occurrences took place connected with Buddha's history, and also in the Sinhalese accounts. These lists are as follows. (The figures denote the pages of the book.)\n\n**BURMESE ACCOUNT.**\n\n1. The Gniasong tree under which he received the nogana 75\n2. The Sala tree .................................................. 77\n3. The Gniasong tree to which he removed from the Sala tree 77\n4. The Atzapala tree ............................................. 95\n5. The Kun tree, close to the N\u00e2ga's tank .................. 95\n6. The Linloon tree .............................................. 100\n7. The Atzapala tree where Brahma visited him .......... 104\n\n**SINHALESE ACCOUNT.**\n\n1. The N\u00e2ga tree, Aj\u00e2p\u00e2la, Manual of Buddhism ........... 167\n2. The Sal tree .................................................... 170\n3. The B\u00f3 tree .................................................... 170\n4. The Aj\u00e2p\u00e2la tree ............................................. 182\n5. The Midella tree .............................................. 182\n6. The Kiripalu tree ............................................. 182\n7. The Aj\u00e2p\u00e2la tree ............................................. 183\n\nProbably the seven trees on the middle architrave of this gateway (front view) may be referred to one of these lists.\n\nThe elephants pouring water from chatties over the figure seated on a lotus, on the square blocks, illustrate the expression found in Southern records, \"pouring water from a vessel shaped like the trunk of a Chhadanta elephant\" (Tennent, Christianity in Ceylon). Compare also the account found in the Vishnu Purana (Wilson, p. 76, line 21). This vessel of consecration, which is several times visible among the sculptures, owes its shape therefore to this comparison.\n\nThe subject of the intermediate rail (rear view) of this gateway is probably the temptation scene of B\u00f4dhisatwa.\nBigandet's account of this incident is as follows: \"At that time Nats (Devas) surrounded Phralaong (Bodhisatwa), singing praises to him. The chief Thagia was playing on his conque, the chief Naga was uttering stanzas in his honour, a chief Brahma held over him a white umbrella... Manh Nat (Mara), turning to his followers, cried to them, 'there is indeed no one equal to the Prince Theiddat (Sidhartha), let us not attack him in front, let us assail him from the north side!'\" (p. 81.)\n\nIn the sculpture we see the Prince seated on his throne in the centre; the Devas in front are inviting him to advance to the tree; the chief Brahma holding a white umbrella over his head, and the Naga just in front reciting his praises; on the right is the ghoulish army of Mara, preparing to attack him, directly he takes his seat under the Bodhi tree.\n\nI consider this explanation tolerably certain. The female figure on the left of the tree is perhaps intended for Sujata, with her gift of Nogana (Manual of Buddhism, p. 168, Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 121).\n\nI also identify the scenes on the inner face of the left-hand pillar of this gateway. They are designed to represent events connected with the conversion of the Kasyapas. As these events may be found in all \"Lives of Buddha,\" it will only be necessary to allude briefly to them.\n\nThe upper scene represents the preparation of an offering to be made to Kasyapa. We read in Bigandet (p. 132), \"On a certain day the people of the country had prepared offerings on a large scale, to be presented to Kasyapa,\" or, as Spence Hardy gives it, \"One day great multitudes came from Anga and Magadha, with offerings for Uruvel.\" (Manual of Buddhism, 190.) As to the character of these offerings, we are told, in another place, \"they consisted of bulls, cows, goats, calves,\" etc., (ibid. 272), and we may reasonably suppose that cakes would be included in the list. The upper portion, therefore, of this series of sculptures may well refer to the \"preparation of offerings for the Kasyapas.\" There is an altar, but no tree, from which we may suppose that Buddha was not the object of the intended ceremony, and the group-\ning generally seems to indicate a levity of character, inconsistent with anything we know respecting his worship.\n\nIn the next scene we have Buddha's adventure with the N\u0101ga (the object of the K\u0101\u015byapas', and the other fire-worshippers', reverence). In the Pasaal or hut, on the right, is seated K\u0101\u015byapa (Bigandet calls it \"a cell,\" p. 131). In the centre are various animals assembled in the hall for sacrifice. We must not wonder to see the elephant there, for we read (Manual of Buddhism, 150): \"On their arrival the animals were all assembled in the place of sacrifice; but when he lifted up his knife to slay the elephant, the affrighted beast cried out,\" etc.\n\nIn the upper centre is the N\u0101ga Temple; the flames issuing from the roof denote the victory of Buddha. The five men on the right, with closed hands and gratified countenances, denote the five disciples converted in the Deer Park, and the three men on the left, whose hands are unclosed, and whose faces indicate bewilderment rather than joy, would represent the three K\u0101\u015byapas, who were converted only after a series of subsequent miracles. The figures in front may well represent the disciples of K\u0101\u015byapa flinging the fire-worshippers' utensils into the water\u00b9 (vid. Bigandet, p. 131, and Manual of Buddhism, p. 191).\n\nThe lower group I take to be a representation of an immediate preparation of a sacrifice among the fire-worshippers. We have an account of such a scene described in the Manual of Buddhism by Spence Hardy, p. 190. The splitting and non-splitting of the wood, the burning and non-burning of the fire, seem here to be indicated. Dr. Fergusson says, with respect to the central figure, that \"he is pouring something into his fire-pot.\" I take it, however, that the old man is simply blowing with his bellows (observe the primitive form of these bellows, both in this figure and in the hands of the old man just below him) into his fire-pot, but the fire won't light, whereas the other fires are burning brightly, according to the words of the legend; and so in the case of the wood-splitting on the right, one of the j\u00f3tis seems to be labouring\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Fergusson however does not agree with this, and I do not wish to urge it.\nin vain to split the log at his feet, whilst the other has it all his own way.\n\nThe lower scene in front on the left-hand pillar of this Gateway I consider to represent life among the Devas. Compare the following extract from the Chinese: \"Persons who die pure in word, deed and thought, are born after death in Heaven. When transported to that higher world, if born of the male sex, they find themselves seated on the knees of lovely women; if born as women, they find themselves seated on the knees of the Heavenly Kings.\" (Hi-Shai Sutra, quoted in the Fish-kai-lih-to.)\n\nIn this case, we have the scene artfully placed in the lowest compartment of the pillar, so as to engage the attention of devotees and visitors, and tempt them with a very pretty exhibition of \"joys in store\" for the faithful; but the similar scene on the fallen pillar of the western gateway, is portrayed in the upper compartment. The latter picture (Plate xxxvii. fig. 2) is so literally described in a Chinese account of the Triyastrinshas heaven, that I cannot do better than bring it in here to illustrate the whole subject. \"In the centre of the Triyastrinshas heaven, is the city of Sakra, called Sudarsana; around this city, are the abodes of the Devas, arranged in a circular order. There are four parks, viz., the Chariot Park for driving and riding, the Park for athletes or the Gymnasium, the Forest Park for rustic pleasures, and the Joy Park, where the Devas and Devis give way to every kind of pleasurable indulgence. Each of these parks has a delightful pleasure-bath in the centre of it... At the time of being born in this heaven, a flower is produced in the middle of the hand of one of the Devis, by which she knows that a Deva will be born. Accordingly, after seven days, the child is born. He is perfectly acquainted with the divine law, and proceeding to the middle of the palace selected for him, he is met by a goddess, who welcomes him, and serves him. At the time when the Devas wish to go out, the females surround them, they amuse them with every kind of music, they wander from palace to palace, they partake of divine food and drink heavenly nectar, whilst the women afford them every species of delight! Every palace is provided\nwith precious ornaments of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, etc., and each has a lovely park and precious trees belonging to it.\" Again, the same work has the following description of the life of the four heavenly kings (chaturmah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101s). \"When first born, they are only of a diminutive size, but being provided with vessels full of divine food,\\(^1\\) they become like other Devas. When they have bathed themselves, they lounge below fragrant trees, which bend down their branches to perfume their bodies. They then repair to trees that provide them with clothes; to the adorning trees, to the music trees, to the hair-dressing trees; they wander from one to the other, partake of every species of sensual pleasure, enter delicious baths, and wander from palace to palace.\" (\\textit{Fuhkai-lih-to}.)\n\nThese descriptions seem to tally very well with the luxurious scenes on the pillars alluded to, and may help to redeem the credit of the Buddhist church-militant from the slur to which these representations might otherwise subject it.\n\nBut it may be asked, did Buddhists encourage themselves by hopes of such joys as these in a future world? We find the following quotation in the Chinese work already alluded to. \"The Great \u0100gama S\u016btra\" says, \"Whoever practises the moral discipline enjoined by Buddha, even though he be not a professed disciple, shall be born in the Triyastr\u012b\u1e47has heaven.\" The S\u016btra of good rules says, \"Whatever priest or priestess observes the 250 rules (viz., of the Pratimoksha) shall be born in the Triyastr\u012b\u1e47has heaven.\" The miscellaneous \u0100gama (Samyukt\u0101gama) says, \"Whoever bestows charity, although engaged in worldly pursuits, provided he does not break either of the great commandments, after death shall be born in the world of the Devas.\" Again, it is said, \"If any man observe the commandment against killing, then he is born in the heaven of the four great kings; if he neither kills nor robs, he is born in the Triyastr\u012b\u1e47has heaven; if he neither kills, robs, slanders or lusts, he is born in the Yama heaven; if he neither kills, robs, slanders, lusts, or lies, he is born in the Tusita heaven.\"\n\nFrom these extracts (and Burnouf, \\textit{Lotus}, 219, will confirm\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare the result of the food given by Thetis to the infant Phoibos (Coxe, \\textit{Mythology of the Aryan Nations}, vol. ii. p. 22).\nthem) we gather the object of the sculptures before us, viz. to remind spectators, by representations (oculis subjecta fidelibus), of the reward even of limited obedience.\n\nThe upper compartment of the left-hand pillar evidently alludes to the descent of Buddha from the Triyastri\u00f1shas heaven, on the beautiful ladder which Sakra and Brahma provided (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 63, etc.). The lowest tablet of this face of the pillar may be intended to describe the joy of the followers of Buddha, on his return from the thirty-three-heavens. They are therefore paying their adoration to the sacred fig-tree.\n\nThe Dagoba scene on the inner face of this pillar perhaps refers to the Dagoba erected on the spot where Buddha alighted from the ladder on which he came down from heaven. At least, Bigandet notices that \"on the spot where all the Buddhas set their feet when coming from the seat of Tawadeintha, a Dzedi has always been erected.\" (Legend of the Burmese Buddha, p. 214).\n\nThe monkey scene below this (Plate xxvi. fig. 2) refers to the legend of the monkeys, who took the p\u0101tra of Buddha and filled it with honey, and then brought it to Buddha (Jul. ii. 387).\n\nThe next scene (Plate xxvi. Fig. 1) alludes, I think, to the honour paid to Buddha by Brahma, related by Fah-Hian (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 125), whilst the square stone in the rear may refer to the seat which Buddha occupied on this occasion.\n\nI might proceed, if space allowed, to speak of the sculptures on the other gateways; but perhaps enough has been said to establish a probability that these scenes are really quasi-historical, and not mere inventions or meaningless grouping of figures according to the taste of the donor or the artist; and if so, they serve to fix a date, even it be only an approximate one, for the development of the fables to which they allude. We are thus enabled to refer the several records of the adventures of Buddha in his early career to a period at least not later than the Christian era. How much before this we cannot say, but it seems likely that Dr. Fergusson is correct in dating many of the scenes from about the time of Asoka.\nART. X.\u2014Ancient Inscriptions from Mathura. Translated by Professor J. Dowson.\n\nThe Inscriptions which are the subject of the following observations were collected by General Cunningham at Mathura, in the execution of his functions as Archaeological Surveyor to the Government of India. The account of his visit to Mathura is given in his report for the season 1862\u20133. It is not my intention to do more with these Inscriptions than to offer decipherments and translations, with a few remarks upon their character and language. General Cunningham himself will sum up the results derivable from them. His intimate knowledge of Mathura and other similar localities, his long study of Indian antiquities, and his acquaintance with the coins of the period in public collections and in his own private collection, will enable him to do this much more effectually than I could hope to accomplish.\n\nThe Inscriptions are all Buddhistical, and, like Buddhist inscriptions in general, they commemorate acts of pious devotion. Some of them contain the names of the kings in whose reigns or to whose vih\u0101ras the gifts were made; and, what is of more importance, they give the dates in those old Indian numerals which have been the subject of so much study and controversy. These numerals, although pretty accurately determined, cannot as yet be said to be decisively settled; but the examples which the present Inscriptions supply will afford much help to that desirable object.\n\nProceeding now to the Inscriptions, those containing numerals being of the chief importance, are taken together first in order. The numbers correspond with those on the Plates.\n\n1. Inscription on Base of a Pillar.\n\nSan X I Gri \u03a8 Di \u03a8 Mah\u0101-r\u0101jasya R\u0101j\u0101tir\u0101jasya Devaputrasya Huvishkasya Vih\u0101re d\u0101nam bhikshusya Jivakasya Udayanakasya kumbhako \u0398 \u03a0 Sarva-hita-sukham bhavatu.

Year 47; summer season 4th (month); day 25.\nPart of the last figure is defaced so that the unit is illegible. What remains seems to indicate a 5.\n\n3. Fragment. Stone Ladder.\n\nThis Inscription has been partially cut away and mutilated, the stone having been applied to a new purpose. The initial letters of the word Samvatsara (year), the word divase, followed by the numeral \u03c9 (10), and the words asya purvvaye, d\u0101nam bhikshusya buddha sarvavasa are legible, but they do not yield any complete meaning, though the general purport of the legend is sufficiently obvious.\n\n4. Rough Slab.\n\nMah\u0101r\u0101jasya R\u0101j\u0101tir\u0101jasya Deva-putrasya V\u0101su-devasya Samvatsara X 4 Varsham\u0101se-prathame divase tris?

On this holy day .\n\nThis record is incomplete, and nothing can be made out of the few mutilated words at the end of the fragment. They apparently contain the names of the donors.\n\n5.

May the pious action here performed\ntend to the welfare of my parents and all. For the acquisi-\ntion of the irrefragable doctrine.\n\nThis inscription is of a later date, and is one of the most\nimportant of the series, as it gives the date in words as well\nas in figures. The name of the reigning monarch is not\nrecorded. The inscription is imperfect, but, fortunately, the\ndefective portion is apparently of no importance, as what is\nleft of it consists only of pious aspirations. The sentence in\nthe second line, which clearly reads \"anuttara-jn\u0101-s\u0101ptaye,\"\nis inaccurate. Its correct wording will be found in the fol-\nlowing inscription, but more clearly still in No. 18. It is a\nprayer for the ar\u0101pti, that is, the acquisition, or, as probably\nhere meant, the spread of the \"anuttara-jn\u0101na.\" Jn\u0101na, or\nknowledge, may be translated as doctrine. Anuttara admits\nof two interpretations, being either that which cannot be excelled, or that which cannot be answered.\n\n9. Well at the Kattr\u0101.\n\nDey\u0101-dharm\u0101yam Yas\u0101-vih\u0101re S\u0101kya-bhikshumyaka yana ya Yad atra punyam tad bhavatu sarvasatwat\u0101m Anuttara-jn\u0101nav\u0101ptaye. Samvatsarah 280.\n\nThis is a votive offering to the Yas\u0101-vih\u0101ra by the mendicant priest of S\u0101kya. . . . May this virtuous action tend to the general good. For the acquisition of the irrefragable doctrine.\n\nThere is a faint mark following the figures 280, which may, perhaps, be the remains of the numeral 1; making the date 281.\n\n10. Base of Pillar.\n\nD\u0101nam bhikshusya Buddha-d\u0101sasya Sangha-maitrasade vih\u0101re. Sa(m)panchatrisasya sat\u0101 rahpetraivasyavyasya.\n\nGift of the mendicant priest Buddha-d\u0101sa to the Sangha-maitrasada vih\u0101ra. In the year 35? hundred??\n\nThe values of most of the old Indian numerals have been settled by the researches of Mr. Thomas, Bh\u0101u D\u0101j\u012b, and others. I lay no claim to the discovery of any of those now given, for the values of all were marked on the impressions when I received them from the hands of Gen. Cunningham. These Mathura Inscriptions confirm several of the values previously assigned, and they furnish some new and some varying forms. The following are the numerals here found:\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n| 3 | \u2261 |\n| 4 | \u2021 |\n| 5 | \u1e5a |\n| 6 | \u03b5 |\n| 7 | \u0399 |\n| 10 | \u221e |\n\nThe second form of the 5 is slightly variant. The plain cross for the 40 is new, but it is a simpler form of the figure given by Bh\u0101u D\u0101j\u012b. The figure for 30 is more elaborate\nthan the form hitherto discovered, and so is the figure for 100 used in the same inscription. In fact, the figures for 100, 30, and 5 used in this inscription would have been doubtful if the value of them had not also been expressed in words.\n\nThe remaining inscriptions are of less interest, and several of them are not given in the Plates. I append transliterations and translations so far as they are intelligible.\n\n11. Base of Pillar.\n\nD\u0101nam bhikhusya Buddha-ghoshasya phala . . .\nGift of the mendicant priest Buddha ghosha, the fruit.\n\n12.

The stone upon which it was graven seems to have been very cleanly cut through, and the first part of it carried off. There can be no certainty as to how much has thus been lost, but probably very little. The following is a transcription:\u2014\n\n. . . sw\u0101misya mah\u0101-kahatrapasya \u015a\u0101nd\u0101sasya Gajavarena Brahmanena Sangrava-sagotrena.\n. . . rani. Im\u0101 j\u0101yamada pushkaranain\u0101m paschim\u0101 pushkaranim udap\u0101no \u0101r\u0101mo stambhah.\nPart of the inscription being lost, it is not possible to give a translation, but its general meaning is sufficiently manifest. It records (a gift) by the brahman Gaja-varena of the Sangrava gotra in the time of the great Satrap Sandasa, (lieutenant) of the lord paramount (sudami). . . . The gift appears to have consisted of tanks called Jaya-mada, a western tank, a well, a garden, a pillar; but in the absence of a verb no definite meaning can be attached to the words. The absence of this part of the inscription is of no consequence, but it would be interesting to see who was the sudami or lord paramount of the Satrap Sandasa.\n\nThe language of all the inscriptions is Sanskrit, not Pali, but it shows some interesting deviations from the classical forms. For Rajadhira we find Rajatiraja, but this may be an unusual though legitimate form, the preposition ati being used instead of the commoner adhi. The word bhikshu in a few instances has its proper genitive form bhikshoh, but it generally appears as \"bhikshusya,\" following the declension of the much more numerous class of nouns in a. Muni, in the only instance in which it appears, has similarly the genitive \"munisya,\" instead of the proper form muneh. The word vihara appears in the locative form where the dative might be expected, showing a leaning to the Prakrits, which reject the dative.\n\nThe seasons of the year are used for the purposes of dates. Some instances of this use are given by Bhau Daji from the Western Caves. These inscriptions show that the division of the year into three seasons was the one employed.\n\nPS.\u2014Some months after the preceding notes had been read before the Society, I received from Babu Rajendra Lal a copy of a paper on several of the same Inscriptions which he published in No. II. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1870. His Essay and mine, therefore, represent two entirely independent investigations of the same set of Inscriptions. As the Babu's paper arrived before this had been set up in type, I take the opportunity of\nmaking a few remarks upon some parts of it, which seem open to objection.\n\nThe translations of the Inscriptions are generally in accordance, but there are several important points of difference. I have weighed the B\u00e1b\u00fa's readings very carefully and candidly, but in no case have I felt constrained to surrender my own versions.\n\nGeneral Cunningham in his note following this has remarked upon the B\u00e1b\u00fa's very incorrect rendering of the numerals, which are the most valuable portions of the Inscriptions. I may say at once that I give up the B\u00e1b\u00fa's renderings as beyond my understanding. The \"40th day of the year 59,\" and \"the 80th day of the year 59,\" are forms of dates which are new to me, and for which I can find no warrant in the Inscriptions. Though the B\u00e1b\u00fa shows that he is acquainted with Bh\u0101u D\u0101j\u012b's investigations of the Inscriptions in the Western Caves, where the Seasons of the Year are employed in the dates, he has failed to perceive that the same custom is observed in these Inscriptions. So, the following difficulty is encountered. The word varsha means both year and rainy season, but the applicability of the latter sense not having been seen, the B\u00e1b\u00fa explains the sentence in which it occurs, and which begins with the distinct word sameatsara (year), by saying varsha \"is used very much in the same way as if a man were to say 'in the year 44 Anno Domini.'\"\n\nAnother reading of the B\u00e1b\u00fa's is most important if it could be substantiated. He reads in one Inscription the date \"140th \u015aaka year,\" and thereupon proceeds to argue that the \u015aaka was the era employed. If this could be proved, it would have a most important bearing on Hindu Chronology. I failed to perceive either the word or the figures in the paper impression of the inscription; and on referring to the B\u00e1b\u00fa's engraving, I find the word which he reads \u015aaka, to be written with the dental s (\u1e63), not, as it ought to be, with the palatal \u1e63 (\u1e6d). This is fatal to his reading. Further, the word so read follows the word dinam, intervening between that and what is evidently part of the donor's name. No\ndate could be inserted in such a position. I have no doubt whatever that these obscure letters are parts of the donor's name or title.\n\nThe B\u0101b\u016b, while stating the inscriptions on the pillars to be records of gifts, raises the question \"whether in the case of inscriptions, recording gifts (d\u0101na) without specifying their nature, they are to be taken as mere records of gifts, or of the gift of the objects on which they occur.\" He then goes on to say, \"Gen. Cunningham is in favour of the latter alternative... There is generally, however, no pronoun of any kind in such inscriptions to fix such a meaning, and it often happens, that a single bar of a railing records two or three or more gifts of a different date, each in the usual form of gifts of so and so.\" He then notices the Inscription No. 12, in which the inscription on the base says, Gift of so and so, and that on the plinth, Gift of some one else. A single railing bearing records of several gifts of different dates has never come under my notice; but, dealing with the Inscriptions before us, there seems to be no reason why two persons, naturally or spiritually related, might not agree to contribute separate parts of a column. The B\u0101b\u016b's reading of this short inscription is rather different from mine. I find that the two donors are connected by a common patronymic Vasu-mihira. What can the words \"Gift of,\" inscribed upon a pillar or anything else, mean, unless it be that the object so inscribed is the thing given? If we find a stained window inscribed \"Gift of\u2014;\" do we understand that something else was given, not the window? It might have been convenient to make records of gifts on pillars, railings, or other conspicuous objects; but, unless the object inscribed were the one presented, some mention would undoubtedly have been made of what the gift really was. The earliest researches of Prinsep showed the gift of a pillar to be a favourite act of Buddhist devotion, and two of these Inscriptions (1 and 23) distinctly state the base of the pillar to have been the donation. The B\u0101b\u016b seems not to have been aware that the word kumbha or kumbhaka,\u00b9 has \"base of a pillar\" among its other meanings;\n\n\u00b9 See Rothlingk and Roth.\nand so in Inscription No. 1, he has read kumbhaka 25 (base of pillar 26) as kumbhaka-sanjna, which he translates \"breath suspended,\" and applies it as an epithet to the donor.\n\nTo the Inscriptions from Mathura the B\u0101b\u016b has added one obtained by General Cunningham from S\u0101het M\u0101het which place the General identifies with the \u015ar\u0101vasti of the Buddhist records. This Inscription General Cunningham has introduced at the end of Plate III., and I now proceed to offer a transcription and a suggestive translation. B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101jendra has done the same before me, and we agree in some words; but as he considers the \"document very puzzling,\" and \"the translation a mere guess,\" I refrain from quoting his version. General Cunningham himself, in his Report, gave readings of the names and other portions of the Inscription, including the name of \u015ar\u0101vasti in the second line.\n\n... ... ... Ktaye purvaye bhikshusya Pushpa ... sya Saddhy\u0101 Mihirasya bhikshusya Bapusa Trepitakasya d\u0101nam. Buddhisatwo chatram d\u0101no\u015bu \u015bavastiye bhagavato chankame. Komumba kutiy\u0101 Achayy\u0101no sarvast\u012b dinam parigr\u0101he.\n\nSuch is the transliteration of the Inscription as it appears in the engraving. The commencement is wanting, but there are traces of figures, one of which seems to be 10. I have not had the advantage of seeing the impression, or it is possible I might have detected some rudimentary signs which would justify the reading of Bodhisatwo instead of Buddhisatwo and \u015ar\u0101vasti instead of S\u0101vasti, etc. The engraving is much superior to that accompanying B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101jendra's paper, but the letters in italics remain uncertain after a comparison of both. In the B\u0101b\u016b's copy an additional letter ta appears between sarvasti and dinam.\n\nI am unable to extract any continuous sense out of this legend. The first part records the fact of the statue being the gift of the mendicants\u2014Mihira and Bapu Trepitaka. After this follows the word Buddhisatwo for Bodhisatwa, and the word chakram, disciple in the accusative case. There is no verb, however, to govern this accusative, and so the dot representing it may possibly be an accidental addition. Next comes a doubtful word, then \u015br\u0101vastiye bhagavato chan-\nkame. This may mean that the donors were disciples of the bodhisattva, and their donation was made to the holy chankama, whatever that was, at \u015ar\u0101vasti. In the following line, kosumba-kutiy\u0113, may be translated as \u201cto the flowery dwelling,\u201d which is probably the name of the temple. This last sentence probably means, \u201cFor the regular use of the disciples of the deh\u0101rya (teacher) at the Kosumba-kuti.\u201d\n\nThe language of this Inscription bears strong signs of the transition from Sanskrit to P\u0101li. The compound letters of the Sanskrit keep their place, but besides the genitive bhikshusya, we have satwo and bhagavato followed by a hard consonant, and the dative forms \u015br\u0101vastiye and kutiy\u0113.\n\nNote on the preceding Mathura Inscriptions.\u2014By Major-General A. Cunningham.\n\nThe circumstances under which these inscriptions were discovered are detailed in my Archaeological Report for 1862-3, par. 159-184.\n\nProfessor Dowson\u2019s translations were handed over to me in the end of April last, and I read them at a meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 5th of July, just four months before the receipt of B\u0101bu R\u0101jendral\u0101l\u2019s translations, which appeared in the Bengal Asiatic Society\u2019s Journal for 1870, p. 117-130. But the B\u0101bu\u2019s translations are confined to the inscriptions which I first made known to Mr. E. C. Bayley in November or December, 1860, by the copies which are now engraved in the Bengal Journal. Mr. Bayley visited Mathura early in April, 1861, and made independent copies of most of these inscriptions; and in 1863 a considerable number of the inscribed stones were forwarded to Calcutta, where B\u0101bu R\u0101jendra had the opportunity of studying them at leisure. The B\u0101bu mentions that the inscriptions which he has translated are taken from my transcripts, \u201cwith such corrections and emendations as a careful examination of the\noriginal and comparison with Mr. Bayley's transcripts would warrant.\" As a single specimen of the nature of the corrections and emendations effected by B\u0101bu R\u0101jendra, after this careful examination of my transcripts, I need only refer to the first inscription, in which the vowel \u0113 in r\u0101jatirdeja, and the compound letter sya in bhik\u1e63a\u1e63aya, both of which were accidentally omitted in my hurried transcript sent to Mr. Bayley, are also omitted in the present Calcutta transcript, which the B\u0101bu professes to have corrected and amended from the original. The only alteration which he has made is in the final letter s, which he has changed to t, although he reads it as f.\n\nThe Plates of these inscriptions, which accompany the present translations by Professor Dowson, have been reduced by photography from paper-impressions of the originals. About one-half of these inscriptions, including several of the most important, were discovered by me in 1862 and 1865, and were unknown to B\u0101bu R\u0101jendra. Amongst these new inscriptions is one (No. VI.) of Mahar\u0101ja Vatsadeva, dated in the year 83; the previously discovered inscription of the same king (No. IV.) being dated in the year 44. No. VIII. inscription is of special value, as the date, 165 Samvat, is given in writing as well as in figures. No. XXIX., which is the earliest inscription yet found at Mathura, belongs to a Matrap named Sand\u0101ga, of whom I possess several coins. This inscription is probably as early as B.C. 100. Inscriptions XXX. and XXXI. are simply the numbers 118 and 127.\n\nIn the translations of these inscriptions, Professor Dowson has adopted, without a single alteration, the whole of my readings of the dates, which I communicated to him at the rooms of the Royal Asiatic Society, where I met him by appointment, for the purpose of making over the paper-impressions of the inscriptions. My readings of the dates had long before been noted on these impressions. I mention this fact because, at the end of the translations, Professor Dowson states that the values of most of the old Indian numerals have been settled by the researches of Mr. Thomas, Bh\u0101u D\u0101j\u012b, and others. Of how little assistance this \"settle-\nment\u201d of the numerals has been in the case of the Mathura inscriptions, may be seen on comparing B\u0101bu R\u0101jendra\u2019s readings of the dates with my readings now given by Professor Dowson.\n\nI do not presume to offer any verbal criticism on the translations of these two well-known scholars; but I may note a single misreading into which both of them have fallen. It is in the last word of No. I. inscription, which should be chatur-di\u1e63\u1e6da, \u201cin the four quarters,\u201d and not chatur-d\u0101ya, \u201cthe fourteenth.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, I am so pressed for time by my approaching departure for India, that I cannot do more than offer a few words on the historical importance of these inscriptions. In No. I. we find that Mathura possessed a Vih\u0101ra of the great king Huvishka, whose name is also found in the Aryan Pali inscription of Wardak, near Ghazni, and who is no doubt the Hushka of the R\u0101jatarangini and the Oerke of the Indo-Scythian coins. In this inscription therefore we have proof of the accuracy of the Chinese accounts of the Turushka Indo-Scythians, that they had conquered the whole of Northern India. Nos. IV. and VI. belong to king V\u0101sudeva, who takes the title of Deva-putra, which is given to Kanishka in the Bah\u0101walpur Tope inscription. His dates of 44 and 83 show that he enjoyed a long reign, which we learn also from the abundance of his coins. The name is written BAZO-AHO in corrupt Greek both on the gold and copper coins, and this reading is confirmed by a few of the gold coins which also bear a part of his name in Sanskrit characters, V\u0101su, written perpendicularly, as on the well-known coins of the Guptas. From the pure Hindu name of V\u0101sudeva, we might suppose that he was a Hindu; but as the coins give him the well-known tribal title of Korano, which was borne both by Kanishka or Kanerke, and by Huvishka or Hoerke, it seems certain that V\u0101su-deva, in spite of his pure Indian name, must have been an Indo-Scythian. If so, may we not suppose that the descendants of the Indo-Scythians gradually became Indianized, and that they must now be sought for amongst some of the inferior\ntribes in the North-West, such as the Jats and Gujars, with whom I have already proposed to identify them?\n\nI will conclude these remarks by referring the reader to the Samudra Gupta inscription on the Allahabad Pillar, in which the king, after mentioning the Saka, speaks of the Pasupata Shaiva Shakti, who must therefore have been the Turushka king of the Punjab. This has an important bearing on the age of the Guptas, as it makes Samudra Gupta a contemporary of the Turushka kings, whose dominion, according to the Chinese authorities, had already passed away in the beginning of the third century after Christ.\n\nThe dates in these inscriptions I refer to the era of Vikramaditya, as we know that both Kanishka and Huvishka preceded the establishment of the Saka era. Vamsadeva's reign would therefore have extended from B.C. 13 to A.D. 26, and his name were the immediate precursors of those of Ghatotkacha, the father of Chandragupta I., who probably reigned from A.D. 38 to 75.\nART. XI.\u2014Specimen of a Translation of the \u0100di Granth.\n\nBy Dr. Ernest Trumpp.\n\nIn offering to the learned public a specimen of a translation of the \u0100di Granth (or first holy book of the Sikhs), we premise a few words on the language in which that work is composed, as hitherto wrong notions have been entertained on this point. The language of the \u0100di Granth is not the old Hindi, as has been recently stated, if the old Hindi (if it may be called so) is taken identical with the Hind\u012b, the language of the middle age of India, from which the present Hindi has sprung, and which is now nearly extinct. Even the learned Garcin de Tassy was of opinion that the \u0100di Granth was written in Hind\u012b, but he had apparently not paid any attention to the study of this work, and his statement can, therefore, be only a surmise.\n\nThe language in which the \u0100di Granth is composed we would propose to call the old Gurmukh\u012b, for it is in reality the mother of the modern Gurmukh\u012b, and it differs as much from the Hind\u012b (the term \"old Hindi\" we will discard, to avoid misconceptions) as the modern Gurmukh\u012b differs from the Hind\u012b. It is true there is a close relationship between the old Gurmukh\u012b and the Hind\u012b, especially in the nomenclature; but the grammatical forms, on the other hand, differ so much, that they can hardly be identified, as little as the modern Gurmukh\u012b can be classed under the Hind\u012b. We will not enter into details here to prove our assertion; for\n\n5 Garcin de Tassy: Rudiments de la langue Hindou\u00ef, p. 4, note 5.\nevery one who has read the Hind\u00fbf compositions, as contained in Garcin de Tassy's \"Chrestomathie Hindie et Hindouie,\" will perceive at once the difference. We will only adduce a few striking points of difference between the old Gurmukh\u00ee and the Hind\u00fbf: The old Gurmukh\u00ee has a regular Passive voice (like the Sindhi), the Hind\u00fbf only the compound Passive voice; the whole conjugation of the old Gurmukh\u00ee differs considerably from that of the Hind\u00fbf; the old Gurmukh\u00ee uses pronominal suffixes with the verbs, especially the past participle, which is quite unknown in Hind\u00fbf, but current in Sindhi. As regards the declensional process, the old Gurmukh\u00ee has, like the Sindhi, a regular Locative, Ablative, and Instrumental (plur.) case, which are not to be found in Hind\u00fbf. Besides the (adjectival) Genitive case sign \u06af\u0627, \u06af\u06cc, etc., we find already the modern Gurmukh\u00ee form \u06af\u0627, \u06af\u06cc. The idiom which stands nearest the old Gurmukh\u00ee is not the Hind\u00fbf, but the Sindhi; in fact, without a knowledge of Sindhi the old Gurmukh\u00ee cannot be understood at all. We allow that also specific Hind\u00fbf forms are to be met with in the \u00c2di Granth; but we have no doubt that such like forms point to a later origin, and are to be considered as interpolations. The matter is quite different with the Dasv\u00e9d p\u00e2ts\u00e2h k\u00e1 granth, the composition of Govind Singh; this work is (with the exception of the Persian portion) written altogether in Hind\u00fbf. The language of the \u00c2di Granth is now totally antiquated, and may be considered as dead, for the Sikhs themselves, when quoting a passage from the \u00c2di Granth, add a regular translation.\n\n1 And even with nouns; examples of this kind are even found in the MSS. of the \u00c2di Granth.\n\n2 Very important in this respect is the work printed at Ludh\u00een\u00e2 (Loodiana), a.d.1868, and composed by Pandit Sardh\u00e2 R\u00e2ma, under the title \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0631\u0627\u06a9\u06be \u062f\u06cc \u0648\u06cc\u0634\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0627, history of the Sikh power. It gives various passages from the \u00c2di Granth, with a translation, from which we may see that even the learned Sikhs frequently misinterpret the words of the \u00c2di Granth, and are not always sure of the meaning of difficult words and passages.\nThe translation offered here we would only call a first attempt; for we had only the manuscripts before us, without any commentary or any other help whatever. There is neither a grammar nor a dictionary of the old Gurmukhi, and we had to find out the different grammatical forms by mere comparison with the Sindhi, Hindustani, and the modern Gurmukhi. Besides the difficulties arising from the more or less unknown or doubtful grammatical forms, the manuscripts, without exception, are written in such a way that all the words in a line are joined together, so that it is often difficult to separate the words, as occasionally, as a letter more or less may be added or cut off, the sense will become quite different. We trust, however, that these and other difficulties will be speedily overcome, when we shall have the assistance of a learned Sikh priest in India.\n\nFor want of Gurmukhi types, we have made a literal transcription in the ordinary Devanagari character.\n\nOm!

XII.\u2014Notes on Dhammapada, with Special Reference to the Question of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. By R. C. Childers, late of the Ceylon Civil Service.\n\nI have given in the following pages some of the results of a careful study of the text of Dhammapada, rendered necessary by the preparation of a P\u0101li Dictionary. In endeavouring to elucidate some of the obscure or difficult points of this important text, I have given prominence to a few passages enabling me to test the theory of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a which I propounded last year in the columns of a periodical. Verse 203. Jighacch\u0101paran\u0101 roga, sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101 param\u0101 dukha, Etam \u0101tav\u0101 yath\u0101bh\u016btam nib\u0101nam paramam sukham.\n\nThe sense of this verse is, \u201cAs hunger is worse than any disease, so existence is worse than any pain; to him who has realized this truth extinction is the greatest bliss.\u201d If any proof is wanted that the author of Dhammapada believed Nirv\u0101\u1e47a to be the annihilation of being, it is surely here. When he says in the same breath that existence is the acme of suffering, and that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is consequently the highest bliss, it follows logically and inevitably that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a must be the cessation of existence. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a must here be taken as Anupadhi\u1e63\u1e6dhanirv\u0101\u1e47a. Sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101 (in the plural) is used almost in the sense of \u201corganic life.\u201d The comment says, \u201cthe five Skandhas,\u201d which amounts very much to the same thing; for the Skandhas are the attribute of every organized being, however low in the scale of animal life. Compare the expression sabbe sa\u1e45khatisa\u1e45khataudhamma, \u201call things organized and unorganized,\u201d or \u201call things animate and inanimate,\u201d which includes, of course, the whole realm of creation. I take this opportunity of re-stating the theory of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a which I published in the July and October numbers of Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s Record for 1870; and I may observe that my\ntheory meets, as far as I know, all the difficulties of the question, and holds good in every instance in which I have tested it.\n\nNirv\u0101\u1e47a means extinction or annihilation. It is the ultimate goal of Buddhism, the supreme reward of the highest spiritual development, the *sumnum bonum* to which the follower of \u010c\u0101kyamuni is taught to look. What, then, is this Nirv\u0101\u1e47a or extinction which is the reward of virtuous action? It is twofold\u2014Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the extinction of human passion; and Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the annihilation of being. There are eight progressive stages of sanctification, called the Four Paths and the Four Fruitions:\u00b9 the last and highest of these stages is called Arhattavaphala, or \u201cfull fruition of final sanctification,\u201d and this is Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or, as it is also called, Kle\u00e7aparinirv\u0101\u1e47a. Arhatship or Arhattavaphala is admittedly a state of the highest happiness and perfection, and its identity with Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or, as it is more generally called, simply Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, cannot be too strongly insisted upon, since it accounts for the frequency with which Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is spoken of as a state of bliss. This, then, is one of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47as, the other is Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a or Skandhaparinirv\u0101\u1e47a,\u00b2 which it is impossible to explain as anything but absolute annihilation. The Arhat, or being who has attained final sanctification,\u00b3 though wholly free from human passion, and possessed of superhuman faculties, is still a man, and liable, like all other men, to death. Nor is his life necessarily prolonged beyond that of his fellows; \u010c\u0101kyamuni himself, the Great Arhat, died at an age not exceeding the common lot of humanity. But the Arhat, alone of men, when he dies ceases to exist. The oil in the lamp of life is burnt out, the seed of existence is withered, he enters the vast portals of Nothingness and Void, and entering vanishes from creation,\u2014he has attained to Skandhaparinirv\u0101\u1e47a, the annihilation of the elements of being. I have said that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is twofold; but is it not also one? for Skandhaparinirv\u0101\u1e47a is\n\n\u00b9 In P\u0101li Caitdro Magga and Caitdro phal\u0101ni.\n\u00b2 Generally called simply Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\n\u00b3 Arhattavaphala or Kle\u00e7aparinirv\u0101\u1e47a.\nthe necessary complement of Kle\u00e7aparinirv\u00e1na, as the latter is of the former. Without Arhatship there can be no cessation of existence,\\(^1\\) just as there can be no Arhatship that does not terminate in extinction. Viewed, therefore, from a distance as it were, as the goal of the pious Buddhist, Nirv\u00e1na is one; it is a brief period of the highest bliss on earth, ending in eternal death. It may here be objected\u2014Must not great confusion be created by using one and the same term for two things so different as \u201cbliss\u201d and \u201cannihilation\u201d? I reply that in reality there is no such confusion, since the context will readily determine whether, by the word Nirv\u00e1na, Upadhi\u00e7esha or Anupadhi\u00e7esha Nirv\u00e1na is intended. And in a vast proportion of instances the term embraces both Nirv\u00e1nas. Thus in such a sentence as \u201cNirv\u00e1na is the reward of a virtuous life,\u201d it is clear that both Nirv\u00e1nas are meant, since they are inseparably connected, and the one involves the other as a necessary consequence. There are, however, occasions when one of the Nirv\u00e1nas is distinctly alluded to, and then the context determines which of them is meant. Thus in verse 89 the word l\u00f3ke specifies Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e1na, while in the verse we have been considering Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e1na is clearly indicated by the use of the word sahkh\u00e1v\u00e1.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to add that the much contested word Parinirv\u00e1na means \u201cthe attainment of Nirv\u00e1na,\u201d or simply Nirv\u00e1na. Like Nirv\u00e1na it is twofold, Kle\u00e7aparinirv\u00e1na, \u201cattainment of the extinction of human passion,\u201d and Skandhaparinirv\u00e1na, \u201cattainment of the annihilation of the elements of being.\u201d When the Parinirv\u00e1na of an Arhat is spoken of, it may be translated \u201cdeath\u201d; for in the case of an Arhat, death and the attainment of Nirv\u00e1na are simultaneous. The word Mah\u00e1parinirv\u00e1na merely means the death of Buddha.\n\nVerse 89. Te l\u00f3ke parinibbut\u00e1, \u201cthey attain Nirv\u00e1na in this world\u201d; that is they attain Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e1na or Arhatship, which is compatible with existence. Parinibbuta (pari-+nis+vrita) is always used for the part. perf. pass. of parinibbd\u00e1ti, \u201cto attain Nirv\u00e1na.\u201d The regular p.p.p. would be parinibbd\u00e1no,\n\n\\(^1\\) I mean, of course, on this earth, since, for instance, an An\u00e1g\u00e1min attains Skandhaparinirv\u00e1na from one of the Brahma heavens.\nbut there is a confusion in P\u0101li between the compounds nirv\u0101\u1e47a and nirv\u012b\u1e47a, so much so that nibbuti (nirv\u1e5bti) means both happiness (or tranquillity) and annihilation. It is well known that this sort of confusion is frequent in P\u0101li. An important reason against the use of parinibb\u0101na as the p.p.p. of parinibbati is that it would be readily mistaken for the noun parinibb\u0101na. When used of an Arhat parinibbuta may be translated \u201chaving died,\u201d e.g. Lokan\u0101tha dasabale satt\u0101ha-parinibbuta, \u201cwhen the world\u2019s protector endowed with the ten forces had been dead seven days.\u201d\n\nVerse 153. A\u1e45kaj\u0101tiss\u0101s\u0101ram sandh\u0101rissam anibbisam\n\nGuhakirakam gareanto dukkha j\u0101ti punappunam.\n\n\u201cI have run through the revolution of countless births, seeking the Architect of this dwelling and finding him not, grievous is repeated birth.\u201d Fansb\u00f6ll takes sandh\u0101rissam as a conditional, but the sense imperatively requires an aorist, and Mr. Trenckner pointed out to me some time ago that sandh\u0101rissam in this place is a true aorist, the Sanskrit aorist in -isham. The third persons sing. and plur. of this aorist occur pretty frequently in P\u0101li, and end in -isi and -isum respectively. The doubled s has many analogies in P\u0101li. The learned Sthavira Dhamm\u0101r\u0101ma of Y\u0101tr\u0101mull\u00e9 has favoured me with a long extract from Culla Saddan\u012bti, in which the author, misled by the doubled s, calls sandh\u0101vissam \u201ca future in a past sense\u201d (atitatthe bharissanti hoti), and cites a passage from the Tripi\u1e6daka book Vim\u0101navatthu containing an analogous example. The passage is as follows:\n\nCutt\u0101dasi\u1e43 pa\u00f1c\u0101dasi\u1e43 y\u0101ra pakkhassa atthami\nP\u0101\u1e6dihariyapakkha\u1e47 ca att\u0101hangasusamahitam\nUpasatham uparasi\u1e63sam sada silsu samrut\u0101.\n\nHere Culla Saddan\u012bti remarks, Imiss\u0101 Vim\u0101navatthup\u0101liy\u0101 attham somanassenthi \u201cuparasi\u1e63sam ti uparasi\u1e63am attitatte hi idam amiguttaracuman ti cuttan\u201d ti saccam cuttam, \u201cthe com-\n\n1 See Abhidhanappadipik\u0101, v. 1015.\n2 Mah\u0101sausa, p. 11.\n3 In P\u0101li the 1st pers. fut. \u0101tmane, and the 1st pers. cond. (parassa and \u0101tmane) both end in -isum. In the cond. the augment may be dropped, so that sandh\u0101vissam might be a future or a conditional.\n4 Sanskrit it (for id\u0101), and id\u0101su.\n5 Compare Dh. p. 404.\nmentators upon this passage of Vim\u00e1navatthu observe with truth that *upac\u00e1issam* is for *upavasim*, for here the future is used in a past sense.\"\n\nVerse 166. *Attadattham paratthena bahund pi na h\u00e1paye*\n\n*Attadattham abhi\u00f1\u00f1aya sadatthapasuto siy\u0101.*\n\nI think the meaning of this verse is, \"Let him not forego his own spiritual good for the sake of another man's, however great; when he has discerned his own spiritual good, let him devote himself thereto.\" This is, I think, in accordance with the comment, and makes the sentiment one to which no exception can be taken, even from a Christian point of view. *Attha* is constantly used in P\u00e1li in the sense of spiritual good, and this very word *sadattha* (sva-artha) is used at page 12 of Turnour's Mah\u00e1vamsa, where Arhatship or spiritual perfection is intended. The words are:\u2014\n\n*Sce sannipato, Ananda; sekhena gamanam tahim*\n\n*Na yuttan te; sadattthe tevan appamatto tato bhava.*\n\n\"To-morrow, Ananda, is the convocation, it is not right that thou shouldst attend it while yet imperfect, strive earnestly therefore for thy spiritual good.\"\n\nVerse 32. *Appam\u00e1darato bhikkhu pam\u00e1de bhayadassiv\u00e1*\n\n*Abhabbo parih\u00e1naya nibb\u00e1nass' eva santike.*\n\nThe meaning of *parih\u00e1na* here is \"falling away,\" \"falling off,\" \"regression.\" The comment says, \"A priest who is in this state is not liable to fall away either from the state of tranquillity and contemplation, or from the Four Paths and their fruition: if he has attained them, he cannot lose them; if he has not yet attained them, he cannot fail to do so.\" Compare the passage at Dham. p. 254, where Godhika Thera is said to have attained the first Jh\u00e1na and then fallen away from it: the expressions used are, \"*samadhih\u0101ya cetovimuttim phusitte tato parih\u00e1yi;\"* \"*chakkhattum jh\u00e1nam nibbattev\u00e1 pari-hino;\"* \"*jh\u00e1na parihino.\"*\u00b9 I would render the whole verse \"The recluse who delights in diligence, who sees danger in sloth, is not liable to fall away from holiness, but is close upon\n\n\u00b9 Compare also Dham. verse 364, *Dhamman anussaram bhikkhu saddhamma na parih\u00e1yiati,* the recluse who remembers the Law will never fall away from true religion.\nthe attainment of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\u201d That is to say, his salvation is assured, nothing can prevent its accomplishment. Nibb\u0101na here means kle\u00e7aparinirv\u0101\u1e47a or Arhatship (see the comment).\n\nVerse 55. Candanam tagaram v\u0101 pi uppalam atha vassik\u0101\n\nEtesam gandhaj\u0101t\u0101nam silayandho anuttaro.\n\nThe meaning of the second hemistych is, \u201cThe perfume of virtue (s\u012bla) far surpasses the perfume of these spices.\u201d There is a confusion in the construction, as the literal rendering would be, \u201cOf these sorts of perfumes (gandhaj\u0101t\u0101m), the perfume of virtue is the best.\u201d I do not see how s\u012bla can be taken as anything but the Sanskrit \u015b\u012bla; the commentator takes it so, and the analogy of the preceding and following verses requires it.\n\nVerse 71. Na hi p\u0101pam katam kammam sajjukhiran va muccati\n\nDaham tam b\u0101lam anveti bh\u0101smacchamno va p\u0101vako.\n\nThe word muccati, in P\u0101li, when applied to milk, means \u201cto curdle,\u201d literally, \u201cto be got rid of,\u201d I suppose because, in the process of curdling, the milk in great measure disappears and is replaced by curds. The Sthavira Subh\u016bti informs me that the true version of the comment is, Sajjukhiran ti ta\u1e45khanam yeva dhenuy\u0101 thanehi dhovite gahitakhiram, na muccatt\u012b na parinamati na pakatibh\u0101vam jahati na dadhihavam \u0101pajjati, \u201cSajjukhira means milk just drawn from the previously washed udder of the cow; na muccati means that it does not change, does not leave its original state, does not turn into curds.\u201d This explanation makes sajju not an independent word qualifying the sentence na hi p\u0101pam katam kammam muccati, but the first part of a compound word sajjukhira, meaning \u201cnew milk.\u201d It is a satisfactory solution of the difficulty, and the sense of the whole verse would be, \u201cAs newly drawn milk will not curdle for a long while, as fire covered by ashes goes on smouldering for a long while, so it takes a long while to get rid of the consequences of an evil action.\u201d Of course in a translation the play upon the two meanings of muccati is lost, and the simile is deprived of most of its force. It is worthy of notice than in the Sinhalese Prakrit m\u016bd, the equivalent of muc, means, according to Clough, \u201cto loosen, to release,\u201d and also \u201cto congeal, to coagulate.\u201d\nVerse 252. Sudassam vajjam a\u00f1\u00f1esam attano pana duddasam\nPareyam hi so vajjani opun\u0101ti yath\u0101 bhusam\nAttano pana ch\u0101deti kalim ca kitav\u0101 sattho.\n\n\"The faults of others are easily seen, our own are difficult to see; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff, his own he keeps out of sight as the fraudulent gambler hides his loaded dice.\" Faustboll translates yath\u0101 bhusam, \"as much as possible,\" taking it as a compound word, the equivalent of which would be yath\u0101bhrigam in Sanskrit. But bhusa in P\u0101li means also \"chaff,\"\u00b9 and the use of opun\u0101ti almost positively demands that yath\u0101 bhusam should be translated \"like chaff.\" The commentator takes this view in the most decided and unmistakable manner, for he says bhusam opunanto viya opun\u0101ti, \"winnows them like one winnowing chaff.\" The force and beauty of the metaphor is obvious enough.\n\nVerse 257. I do not see how dhammassa gutto can be rendered \"custos legis,\" since gutta (gupta) is used only in a passive sense. I would translate the passage, \"The wise man who is guarded by justice (or by the Law) is called just.\" A man guarded by justice would of course mean a man whose actions or words are directed by a sense of justice. The comment says dhammagutto dhammarakkhito, which can only mean \"guarded by dhamma, kept by dhamma.\"\n\nVerse 272. Dhamm\u0101r\u0101ma informs me that the true reading of the last line is bhikkhu viss\u0101sa m\u0101 ap\u0101di appatto \u0101sacakkhayam, or rejecting sandhi bhikkhu viss\u0101sam m\u0101 ap\u0101di appatto \u0101sacakkhayam, \"priest, be not confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desire.\"\n\nVerse 283. Vanam chindatha m\u0101 rukkham vanato j\u0101yati bhayam\nChet\u0101 vana ca vanatha ca nibb\u0101na hotha bhikkhave.\n\n\"Cut down the whole forest, not the tree, danger comes out of the forest; when ye have cut down both the forest and its undergrowth, then shall ye be free from passion.\" Half the force of this passage is lost in a translation, from the impossibility of rendering the play on the two meanings of vana. It is doubtful whether nibb\u0101na or nibban\u0101 (nis+vana) be the right reading. Vana\u00b2 means \"desire\" in P\u0101li as well as\n\n\u00b9 See Abhidh\u0101nappadipika, 453: it is the Sanskrit busa. \u00b2 Abhidh\u0101n, 163.\nvana, and nibb\u0101na would not be a participle, but an adjective meaning \"free from p\u012bna or lust.\"\n\nVerse 344. Subh\u016bti informs me that the true reading is nibbanatho, and the first line means, \"he who having got rid of desire hankers again for desire.\" The readings of Fausb\u00f6ll's three manuscripts are nibbanatho, nibbanato, and nibb\u0101nato. Mr. Fausb\u00f6ll now agrees with me in thinking that the two last are obvious copyists' errors.\n\nVerse 289. Nibb\u0101nagamanam maggam khippam eva visodhaye.\n\nThis is an instance of Nibb\u0101na, meaning both Nirv\u0101\u1e47as. (See my remarks at p. 221).\n\nVerse 331. Tu\u1e6d\u1e6dhi sukha y\u0101 itaritarena, \"A blessed thing is joy, whatever be the cause.\" Itaritura in P\u0101li does not mean \"mutual,\" but \"any whatever.\" Thus in the text of one of the Buddhist classifications we have Idh' \u0101vuso bhikkhu santu\u1e6d\u1e6dho hoti itaritarena cicarena, \"contented with whatever robe he is presented with,\" that is, whether they be of fine or of coarse material. In this verse k\u0101ra\u1e47ena might be supplied after y\u0101 itaritarena. The comment says parittena v\u0101 vipulena eda, \"caused by a small or a great matter.\" Any one who has seen a child in ecstasies of delight over the merest trifle will agree that \"a blessed thing is joy, whatever be the cause.\"\n\nVerse 369. Chetv\u0101 r\u0101ga\u00f1 ca dosa\u00f1 ca tato nibb\u0101nam ehi\u1e63i. \"When thou hast rooted out lust and hate then shalt thou go to Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\" Here Skandhaparinirv\u0101\u1e47a or Anupadhi\u1e63e\u1e63anirv\u0101\u1e47a is intended, for he who has rooted out r\u0101ga and dveha is the Arhat (ritar\u0101ga), who \"afterwards\" (tato, or, as the comment says, aparabh\u0101ge, viz., at the end of the few years he has to live), attains the annihilation of being. The comment distinctly specifies this Nirv\u0101\u1e47a to be Anupadhi\u1e63e\u1e63anirv\u0101\u1e47a: the words are r\u0101gadosabandhan\u0101ni chindit\u0101 arahattam patto tato aparabh\u0101ge anupadhi\u1e63e\u1e63anibb\u0101nam ehi\u1e63iti atho, \"having severed the bonds of lust and hate and attained Arhatahip, thereafter thou shalt go to Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\" It will be observed that the P\u0101li equivalent of upadhi\u1e63e\u1e63a is up\u0101dis\u0113sa. This is a compound of s\u0113sa (s\u0113ha) with up\u0101di, a masculine noun formed from the root p\u0101 \"to take\" with \u0101 and upa. Up\u0101di\n\n1 See Dham. p. 466.\nis closely allied with *upadd\u0101na*, the more regularly formed derivative of *upa-\u0101-d\u0101*, and is used to designate the Five Skandhas. This word is interesting because it is one of the forms which give evidence that the P\u0101li or southern recension of the Buddhist scriptures is the original one, and that the oldest Sanskrit texts of Northern Buddhism are translations from it, possibly made some time after the P\u0101li text of the Tripi\u1e6daka had been settled. *Up\u0101di* is one of the unclassical forms which abound in P\u0101li, and restore to it so much of the wealth it loses from assimilation and other causes. The final syllable *di* must be formed from *d\u0101*, on the analogy of *dhi* from *dh\u0101*. I imagine, then, that the translators of the P\u0101li religious texts into Sanskrit, meeting with this word, and unable to make anything of it, replaced it by the nearest approach they could find to it in classical Sanskrit, viz., *Upadhi*. Other instances might be adduced; thus the word *ph\u0101suvil\u0101ra* occurs frequently in the P\u0101li Tripi\u1e6daka with the meaning of \u201clife of ease or happiness.\u201d *Ph\u0101su* is a P\u0101li neuter noun, meaning \u201ccomfort, ease, happiness,\u201d the etymology of which I have failed to discover. The author of Saddharmapundarika, meeting with the word *ph\u0101su*, took it for the equivalent of *spar\u00e7a*, and rendered the compound *ph\u0101suvil\u0101ra* by *sukhaspar\u00e7avil\u0101rat\u0101*, \u201clife of agreeable contacts.\u201d But *ph\u0101su* can really have nothing to do with *spar\u00e7a*, first because its meaning and use are totally distinct from those of *spar\u00e7a*, and secondly because the regularly formed equivalent of *spar\u00e7a*, namely *phassa*, is in constant use in P\u0101li in the sense of \u201ctouch\u201d or \u201ccontact.\u201d Again, the P\u0101li word *p\u0101ramit\u0101*, \u201cperfection,\u201d is formed by adding the suffix *t\u0101* to *p\u0101rami*, an anomalously formed derivative of *parama*. The author of Saddharmapundarika probably found the form *p\u0101rami* very puzzling, for he almost entirely ignores it, and employs the longer form *p\u0101ramit\u0101*, which he takes to be a\n\n---\n\n1. Upadhi is used also in P\u0101li in a metaphysical sense, the four *Upadh\u012bs* being the Skandhas, the K\u0101magu\u1e47as, Kle\u015ba, and Abhisamk\u0101ra.\n2. Lotus, p. 425\u20137.\n3. For instance, *ph\u0101sugamanam*, \u201cpleasant journey,\u201d *ph\u0101sukam th\u016bnam*, \u201ccomfortable quarters.\u201d Besides *ph\u0101su* is properly an adjective, see Abhidh\u0101n, p. 16, note.\n4. Intr. p. 464. *P\u0101rami* is a feminine noun, the plur. is *p\u0101ramigo*.\ncompound of p\u0101ra and ita, like p\u0101ragata. The circumstance that p\u0101rami is much more frequently used in P\u0101li than p\u0101ramit\u0101, is almost conclusive against this derivation. Again, the well-known P\u0101li word uposatha is simply a contracted form of upavasatha, but the o in the second syllable evidently misled the Sanskrit translators, for the North Buddhist equivalent is uposhadha, which seems to be a sort of compromise between the P\u0101li form uposatha and the Sanskrit part. perf. pass. uposhita.\n\nVerse 295. M\u0101taram pitaram hantv\u0101 r\u0101j\u0101no dve ca sotthiye\nVeyyagghapa\u00f1camam hantv\u0101 anigho y\u0101ti br\u0101hma\u1e47o.\n\n\"The true brahmin goes scatheless though he have killed father and mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides.\"\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that \u010c\u0101kyamuni, though never remiss in declaiming against the errors of the Brahmans, adopted the word br\u0101hma\u1e47a, with all its sanctity and prestige, into his own system, but made it a denomination of the Arhat, or devout Buddhist who has attained to final sanctification. Buddha even applied the epithet to himself in a Ud\u0101navag\u0101tha, \"hymn of joy,\" he uttered after his attainment of omniscience.\n\nYad\u0101 have p\u0101\u1e6dubhave\u1e47i dhamma\n\u0100t\u0101pino jh\u0101yino br\u0101hma\u1e47assa\nAth' assa kankh\u0101 'o' apayanti sabb\u0101\nYato paj\u0101n\u0101ti sahetudhammam.\n\n\"When the Truth is made manifest to the striving, the meditating brahmin, then his doubts all flee away when he knows existing things and their causes.\" The Br\u0101hmanavagga of Dhammapada tells us that the true Brahmin is not he who is born of Brahmin parents, but the man in whom passion is destroyed\u2014khi\u1e47\u1e47\u0101savum arahantam tam aham br\u0101mi br\u0101hma\u1e47am. But to return to our verse: Faub\u00f6ll thinks the sentiment it conveys inconsistent with Buddhist doctrine, though quite in accordance with the Brahminical system. This, however, is on the assumption that the word br\u0101hma\u1e47a is taken in its natural sense, whereas we have seen that it may perfectly mean an Arhat, and the comment says nikkilesa, which is the\n\n1 See Burn.

In my judgment this verse is intended to express in a forcible manner the Buddhist doctrine that the Arhat cannot commit a serious sin.\\(^1\\) It is as much as saying, \"An Arhat cannot commit sin, but were he to commit even sins so dreadful as parricide and murder he would be scatheless,\" that is, as Dr. Max M\u00fcller has observed, if he does commit these crimes, it must be by accident, so that no guilt would rest upon him. *Veyaggha* is a derivative of *vyaggha*, and means, I think, \"an eminent man,\" literally, \"a tigerish man.\"\n\nVerse 302. I think the comment affords a satisfactory explanation of this difficult verse, \"The traveller on the long road of Sams\u0101ra meets with nothing but pain; painful is the life of the recluse, painful is the life of the householder, painful is association with those who are not our equals: therefore let him travel no more, and so he will not be exposed to suffering.\" That is, let him obtain Nirv\u0101na, and bring to an end his journey through Sams\u0101ra. Compare p. 280 of Dhammapada, where it is said that there are two sorts of roads on which a man may be a traveller, *kant\u0101radh\u0101*, a road though a difficult country, and *vattaddha*; the road through Samsara.\n\nVerse 368. *Adhigacche padam santam sankh\u0101riyopasaman sukham*.\n\n\"He will attain the tranquil, blessed lot, where existence is no more.\" Here I believe Skandhaparinirv\u0101na to be intended, as in the verse which immediately follows, and which we have already considered. From a Buddhist point of view there is really no reason why annihilation should not be spoken of as \"blessed,\" or even as \"bliss\"; it is a \"happy release\" from suffering which without it would be endless.\n\nVerse 394. *Kin te ja\u1e6d\u0101hi dummedha kin te ajinasatiya Abbhantaram te gahanam bahiram parimatijasi*.\n\n\"Thou fool, what dost thou with the matted hair, what dost thou with the raiment of skin? thine inward parts are full of wickedness, the outside thou makest clean.\" *Abbhantaram* is a noun, and means \"inner man,\" \"heart.\" It is, I think, best to take *gahanam* as an adjective in agreement with\n\n\\(^1\\) *Abhabbe khindavu bhikkhu sa\u00f1cicca ponam jivit voropetum*, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Vritta*, \"the circle of Samsara\" + adhan.\n\nVOL.

Bhov\u0101di n\u0101ma so hoti, \u201che is called Arrogant.\u201d In the P\u0101li texts bho is a familiar term of address used to inferiors or equals. The compound bhov\u0101din would mean \u201cone who says bho,\u201d and the comment on this verse says, Bhov\u0101diti yo pana \u0101mantan\u0101d\u012bsu bho ti ratv\u0101 vicarati, \u201ca man is called Bhov\u0101din who goes about saying Bho when he accosts people or otherwise addresses them.\u201d\\(^2\\) Brahmins not converted to Buddhism are always represented as saying bho Gotama to Buddha,\\(^3\\) and this address must have greatly jarred upon pious Buddhists, who never spoke to their master but with the highly reverential epithet of Bhante, \u201cLord.\u201d Buddhists therefore in calling Brahmins Bhov\u0101din meant, I suppose, to imply that they were a proud and haughty class, so proud as to address even the Buddha with familiarity if not disrespect.\n\nVerse 339. Subh\u016bti informs me that the right reading is not man\u0101passa van\u0101, but man\u0101passav\u0101na, \u201cflowing in the channels of pleasure.\u201d Man\u0101passav\u0101na is a compound of man\u0101pa and savana,\\(^4\\) and is an adjective in the nom. fem., agreeing with tanh\u0101, understood.

Subh\u016bti informs me that sarita is, as conjectured by Fausboll, the part. perf. pass. from \u201csara-gatimhi,\u201d viz., sri.

It mentions the importance of offerings and prayers in maintaining spiritual harmony. The text also refers to specific religious texts such as the Vedas and Upanishads, indicating their role in guiding religious practices.\n\nThe text concludes with a note about the origin of some works, suggesting they may have been translated or compiled from earlier sources.\nDandaka, K\u0101ntipura, the Barbarians, half-castes, townspeople, agriculturists, P\u0101ratas (or quicksilver), people using fire in their trade, professional soldiers, foresters, fortresses, boroughs (or the Karv\u0101\u1e47as), slayers, cruel men, arrogant fellows, kings, princes, elephants, hypocrites, riots,1 blows, herdsmen, red fruits and flowers, coral, generals, sugar, spirits, anything sharp, treasuries, keepers of holy fires, mines, Buddhist monks, thieves, false, vindicative, and gluttonous persons; all these have Mars for their lord.\n\n16\u201320.

Since the verbal base \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0943\u0927\u0928 is stated to mean \"to extend,\" like \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0943\u0927\u0928, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0943\u0927\u0928 or \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0943\u0927\u0928 must be a regular derivative of it, or the base may have been made in order to explain the existing noun.

How and when a conflict (of the planets) will take place, according to the teaching of the sages who know past, present, and future, has been explained by me in the Astronomical Treatise, after the S\u016brya-siddh\u0101nta.\n\n2. The planets move in the firmament in severally higher and higher orbits, but owing to the great distance they seem, to our sight, to move in the same plain.\n\n3. According to the degree of their (seeming) approachment, there are four kinds of conflicts, as stated by Par\u0101\u015bara and other sages, to wit, cleaving (i.e., occultation), grazing, clashing of the rays, and passing southward.\u00b9\n\n4. At the occurrence of an occultation the rains will fail and discord prevail among friends and powerful families. When planets graze one another, there is danger from the sword, dissension amongst royal councillors, and dearth.\n\n5. At a clashing of the rays there will be war between kings, and desolation by sword, disease, and famine. Likewise there will be hostile encounters between monarchs at the planetary conflict termed passing southward.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Utpala: \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964\n\n\u00b2 Utpala says: \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0903\u0964\n\nCf. comment. on S\u016brya-siddh\u0101nta, vii. 18, seq. The apasavyam or asavyam yuddham takes place, when the interval is somewhat less than a degree; at a greater interval there is no conflict at all. This statement of the S\u016brya-siddh. is more explicit than our author's; yet it is clear that the asavyam or apasavyam in this chapter is that kind of conflict which occurs at the greatest interval allowable. About the words apasavya and asavya, see next note.\n6. The Sun, when standing in the meridian, is (compared to) an ally coming to the rescue; when in the east, he is (like a king) staying in town; in the west, he is (a king) marching off. Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn are always staying in town, and the Moon is always an ally.\n\nThis is not difficult to understand, for the moon leaving, in her eastward course, a planet or star at her own right (i.e. standing north from the planet or star), may be said to make a pradakshina; standing to the south, i.e. leaving a planet or star at her left, she makes an apasaya. Thus apasaya means \"from the left, at the left,\" and, in a special application, \"at the south side;\" but from this it does not necessarily follow that apasaya originally was simply the opposite of savya, \"left.\" Yet it cannot be doubted that they have taken apasaya as the reverse of savya, or, in other words, that apa was understood to mean, not \"from, from the side,\" but \"not;\" therefore azayya was considered to be simply synonymous with apasaya. Moreover, savya has got the meaning of \"right,\" precisely the reverse of its most common acceptation, viz. \"left.\" Savya, \"right,\" e.g. from hands, arms, etc., as opposite to vima, \"left,\" occurs, e.g. in Brh. Sanh. li. 41; avayya, \"left,\" 43. Savya, \"right,\" also in R\u0101ja\u00e7ekhara's drama of B\u0101laram\u0101ya\u1e47a, Act i. 33 (ed.

Not to be confounded with this acceptation of savya is its use in augury. Applied to augural birds, etc., savya is strictly and properly \"left,\" but as birds first appearing from the left of the observer move in the direction of his right, and keep him at their own right, savya, \"left,\" and pradakshina, \"moving to the right,\" imply the same, without being the same.

In case of their being victorious, they bestow victory also upon those of their own class.\n\n8. When a stationary planet is overpowered by another of the same description, then kings keeping the town will kill others in the same predicament. The Sun produces the same effects on marching chieftains, and the Moon on allies; the same applies to stationary and marching planets.\n\n9. A planet is overcome when he is standing south, rough, quavering, retrograding, small, covered, of unnatural appearance, without brilliancy, and colourless.\n\n10. He is termed victorious when he shows signs the reverse of those aforementioned; also, if he be large, glossy, and brilliant, in spite of his standing south.\n\n11. Where two planets at their conjunction are radiant, large, and glossy, there is mutual love; whereas, in the contrary case, they destroy those who belong to their own party.\n\n12. If, owing to the indistinctness of the tokens, it cannot be made out whether a conflict or a conjunction is taking place, the effects concerning the potentates on earth are said to be equally uncertain.\n\n13. When Mars is overcome by Jupiter, the B\u0101hlikas, chieftains taking the field, and people dependent upon fire, are vexed; the C\u016brasenas, Kalingas, and S\u0101lv\u0101s suffer from Mars being vanquished by the Moon.\n\n14. Should Mars be defeated by Saturn, citizens (and kings staying in town) are victorious, but the country people cast down; should he be so by Venus, granaries, barbarians, and knights come to grief.\n\n15. When Mercury is beaten by Mars, trees, rivers, ascetics, A\u1e63mak\u0101-land, monarchs, the Northerners, and persons initiated for a sacrifice, are to suffer.\n\n---\n\n1 The comm. explains \u0915\u094b\u0937\u093e\u0930 as \u0905\u0935\u093f\u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \"a village not received in fief,\" which implies, I suppose, that such a village is exempt from tributes.\n16. In consequence of Mercury being overcome by Jupiter, the barbarians, \u00c7\u00fbdras, thieves, wealthy men, citizens, Trigartians, and P\u00e2rvatiyas are vexed, and the earth shakes.\n\n17. If Mercury is quelled by Saturn, shippers, soldiers, aquatic products, rich men and pregnant women will suffer; if he is overcome by Venus, fires will rage, and corn, rain-clouds and marching kings be lost.\n\n18\u201319. When Jupiter is overpowered by Venus, the K\u00fbl\u00fbtas, Gandharians, Kaikayas, Madras, S\u00e1lvas, Vatasas, Vangas, cows and grain, are destroyed; so are the Middle country, sovereigns and kine, when Jupiter is defeated by Mars, and the \u00c1rjun\u00e2yanas, Vas\u00e2tis, Yaudheyas, \u00c7ibis and priests, when the same is vanquished by Saturn.\n\n20. But should Jupiter be overcome by Mercury, then the barbarians, truthful persons, swordsmen and the Middle country, will be ruined, apart from the results following from what has been stated in Chapter XVI. (v. 41.)\n\n21\u201322. When Venus is defeated by Jupiter, an eminent chieftain on march finds his death, discord reigns betwixt Brahmans and Kshatriyas, and the Rain-god yields no rain; the Kosalas, Kalingas, Vangas, Vatasas, Matayas, the Middle country, eunuchs and \u00c7\u00fbrasenas, suffer severely.\n\n23. In case of Venus being vanquished by Mars, commanders of armies will be slain and kings wage war. If Venus is overcome by Mercury, the P\u00e2rvat\u00eeyas are lost, the cows yield no milk, and there is but little rain.\n\n24. By Venus being defeated by Saturn, foremen of corporations, military men, Kshatriyas and aquatic beings are afflicted; moreover, the general effects (taught) in Chapter XVI. take place.\n\n25. When Saturn is subdued by Venus, the prices rise, snakes, birds, and proud men will suffer; likewise the countries of Tankana, Orissa, K\u00e2\u00e7i and Balkh.\n\n26. The Angas, merchants, birds, cattle, and elephants will suffer, should Saturn be defeated by Mercury; but should he be so by Jupiter, then countries where women are predominating in numbers, the Mahishakas and Scythians, will be afflicted.\n27. Herewith are described the special results of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, if worsted. The other (general) effects must be determined from Chapter XVI. The more any planet is stricken, the more he will ruin whatever belongs to his department.\n\nChapter XVIII.\n\nConjunction of Moon and Planets or Stars.\n\n1. The Moon, when moving more or less to the north of the stars or planets, i.e. keeping them at her right side, brings good to mankind; going at the outside, she is not auspicious.\n\n2. If the Moon stands north from Mars, the P\u0101rvatiyas and commanders of powerful armies will conquer, knights and marching kings be cheerful, and the earth rejoice at the multitude of corn.\n\n3. The Moon, when north from her own son (Mercury), brings victory to chieftains keeping the town, and causes plenty, increases the stores of grain, the happiness of the people, and the treasures of the rulers.\n\n4. When the Moon stands at the north of Jupiter, homesaying monarchs, Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and scholars will thrive, as well as justice and the Middle country; there will be abundance of food, and gladness amongst the subjects.\n\n5. The Moon, in moving north from Venus, makes horses, elephants, and hoarders of wealth thrive. Then, also, chiefs on march and warriors will conquer, and the crops prove most excellent.\n\n1 Cf. ch. xvii. 5, note, and the following lines:\n\n\u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u092e\u0903:\n\u0928\u091a\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e \u091a \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0923\u093f\u0964\n\u0924\u0924\u094d \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u093d\u0930\u094d\u092d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0937\u0941\u0927\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0965\n\u0928\u091a\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e \u091a \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094b \u092c\u091c\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\u0905\u092a\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0926\u093f\u0935 \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u092d\u092f\u0932\u0902 \u091a\u093e\u092f\u092e\u094d\u0965\n6. Should the Moon leave Saturn at her right, then sovereigns keeping the town will triumph, and the Scythians, B\u0101hl\u012bkas, Sindhians, Pahlavas, and Yavanas be joyful.\n\n7. The Moon profits those chieftains, whether marching or not, those things and countries that belong to the domain of the planet or star to the north of which she happens to move, provided she be unhurt. The same are crushed by her, if she stands south.\n\n8. All the effects announced in case of the Moon standing north from a planet become inverted when she stands south. Herewith are enumerated the Moon\u2019s conjunctions with stars and planets; a hostile conflict between the Moon and planets or stars is wholly out of question.\\(^1\\)\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XIX.**\n\n*The years presided over by each of the Planets, and their results.*\n\n1.

The water-sheets are decked with lotuses, nymphaeas, and water-lilies; the trees are blossoming and the bees humming in the parks; the cows yield abundant milk; lovers unceasingly delight their delightful paramours by amorous sports; the sovereigns rule an earth rich in (flourishing) towns and mines, in wheat, rice, barley, Kalama rice, and plantations of sugar-cane, whilst she is dotted with fire-piles, and resounding with the noise of greater and smaller sacrifices.\n\n7\u20139.

The clouds, although bulky in appearance and piled up, yield nowhere rain in great quantity; the corn may shoot out, perhaps, at the boundary, but will wither, and even if it grow up, will be pilfered by others. Kings do not properly attend to their governing duties, bilious diseases prevail, and snakes are raging. Such calamities befall the people, whose crops, moreover, have failed, in a year presided over by Mara.\n\n10\u201312. Enchantment, magic, jugglers, mines, townspeople, singers, writers, arithmeticians, and military men prosper; monarchs wish to exhibit to each other wonderful and pleasant shows in order to make friends; business in the world is carried on honestly; the threefold science of religion is in a perfect state, and human justice is duly administered, as if by Manu himself. Some apply their minds to the knowledge of the highest Word (and Principle), or try to attain the highest rank in the study of logic. To jesters, envoys, poets, children, eunuchs, perfumers, those that live near dikes, water, and mountains, Mercury brings joy, and to the earth abundance of herbs, in a year or month of his own.\n\n13\u201315. Continually many sounds emitted by the priests at the sacrifices go up to heaven, rending the hearts of evil spirits, but gladdening the gods partaking of the offerings. The earth is so provided with excellent grain, so teeming with elephants, horse and foot, so stored with wealth and large herds of kine, and so prosperous owing to the protection of her rulers, that her inhabitants seem to vie with the gods in heaven. The sky is covered with many towering clouds, that refresh the soil by raining, and the exceedingly fertile fields produce plenty of corn, in the happy year presided over by Jupiter.\n\n1 Comm. \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0915\u0941\u0936\u0932\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902\u0964 \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902\u0964 \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0940\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902\u0964\n2 Comm. \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0941 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0964\n3 Comm. \u0906\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u092f \u0924\u0930\u094d\u0915\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964 Cf.

Earth is decked with rice and sugar-cane, for the fields are copiously watered by the rain poured from mountain-like clouds; by her numerous tanks adorned with beautiful lotuses, she shines like a woman brilliant with new ornaments. The rulers of the country destroy their powerful enemies amidst the numerous cries of victory resounding in the air. Owing to the protecting care of the kings, the good rejoice and the wicked are put down in the kingdoms where cities and mines are in a flourishing state. At spring-time there is much sipping of sweet wine in company with dear loves, much delightful singing accompanied by flute and lute, much feasting in company with guests, friends, and kinsfolk, and Love's shouts of triumph are ringing in a year ruled by Venus.\n\n19\u201321. Throughout the course of a year ruled by Saturn the countries are disturbed by unbridled bands of robbers and by many battles, and plundered of cattle and goods; the inhabitants, whose kinsmen have been killed, are sorely crying, and whole families are heavily tried by disease and hunger. The sky shows no clouds, as these are chased by the wind; the soil is covered with heaps of branches torn off; the beams of Sun and Moon are invisible in the firmament, concealed by a dense mass of dust. The reservoirs are without water and the rivers shallow. In some parts the products of the field perish from want of rain; in others they get on (only) after being watered (artificially), as the Rain-god gives but little rain.\n\n22. If a planet is small, with faint rays, standing in his lowest mansion, or overcome, he produces no full effect; in the contrary case, he causes great prosperity. The evil effects of a month increase in an evil year; the same applies to the good effects; should the one neutralize the other, then the results are trifling.\n\n1 The compound \u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u0915\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f is irregular, inasmuch as it ought to be \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u0915\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f. The same irregularity is met with also in Mrchakat\u012b (p. 10, ed. Stenzler), where \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092f\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0915\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0932\u0938\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0940 has the meaning of \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092f\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0915\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0932\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0943. In both instances grammar has been sacrificed to the exigencies of prosody.\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nThe planetary triangle.\n\n1. In any quarter where all the planets together either appear or set heliacally, will be danger from the raging of the sword, from famine, and calamities.\n\n2. The configurations termed discus, bow, triangle, staff, town, dart, and thunderbolt, bring famine and drought to mankind, and promote war.\n\n3. In any quarter where a cluster of planets is seen at sunset, there will be another king and great calamity from foreign hosts.\n\n4. When planets come together in one asterism, they will be fatal to the people standing under that asterism's influence, but suspicious to the same if they shed bright rays and do not occult one another.\n\n5. I shall now describe the tokens and effects of the (six) constellations, called planetary concourse, gathering, tarnishing, meeting, encounter and fellowship.\n\n6. The conjunction of four or five planets, marching or stationary, in one asterism, is styled a \"concourse.\" If combined with a comet or R\u0101hu, it becomes a \"tarnishing.\"\n\n7. When a stationary planet comes together with another stationary planet, or one on march with another of the same description, the conjunction is named a \"meeting.\" When another accedes to the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, there is a \"fellowship.\"\n\n8. One (of two planets in conjunction) rising (heliacally) from the south, and the other doing so from the east, make an \"encounter.\" In a \"gathering\" the planets are auspi-\n\n1 According to ch. xiv. and xv.\n2 K\u014dya, \"fellowship,\" especially secret fellowship, or the German Br\u00fcderschaft, also R\u0101jatarangin\u012b 5, 325; pit\u0101ko\u1e0d\u1e0dha are those who have drunk the cup of secret fellowship.\n3 The definition is simply omitted. Utpala: \u090f\u0924\u093f\u091a\u094b \u092a\u0935\u093e\u0923\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e-\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093e\u092e\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0947 \u091a\u094b \u092f\u0939\u0938\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0903 \u0938 \u092f\u0939\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0926\u0943\u0924\u093f \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093f\u091a\u0903\u0964\ncious if they be large, resplendent, and natural in appearance.\n\n9. The constellations termed \"concourse\" and \"gathering\" are indifferent; \"tarnishing\" and \"fellowship\" are dangerous to the people; the \"meeting\" is said to be good middling; but at \"encounter\" one may with certainty expect the raging of hostilities.\n\nChapter XXI.\n\nPregnancy of the Clouds.\n\n1. Since food is the world's life and dependent upon the rains, the setting in of the rainy season deserves to be carefully investigated.\n\n2. Having read the works composed by Garga, Par\u0101\u00e7ara, K\u0101\u00e7yapa, V\u0101tsya,\u00b9 and other sages, in which the symptoms of the future setting in of the rains are described, I now proceed to treat this subject.\n\n3. The prediction of an astrologer who day and night attentively watches the signs of the pregnancy of the clouds, will prove true like that of a sage, when he determines the fall of rain.\n\n4. Indeed, is there any science that could surpass this, by knowing which one becomes a seer of past, present, and future, even in this time of perdition, the Iron Age?\n\n5. Some\u00b2 say that the days of pregnancy begin after the end of the light half of Karttika. This, however, is not the opinion of the majority. I will tell Garga's opinion.\n\n6. In the (first) days after the first of the light half of M\u0101rga\u00e7irsha, or at the time of the Moon's conjunction with P\u016brva-Ash\u0101dha (after that date), the symptoms of the pregnancy of the clouds ought to be observed.\n\n\u00b9 Another reading has Vajra.\n\u00b2 Comm. \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903 || \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0947\u0928\u0903\n\u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u092e\u0924\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0935 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u092f\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0964\n\u0917\u092d\u094b\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935 \u0938\u0916\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0915\u092e\u094d\u0964\n7. The fetus formed during the Moon's stay in a particular asterism will be born 195 natural days hence, the Moon standing again in the same asterism, according to the laws of her revolution.\n\n8. The fetuses of the light half come out in the dark half, those of the dark in the light half, those of day-time at night, of night at day-time, of evening twilight at dawn, of dawn at twilight.\n\n9. The fetuses from M\u0101rga\u015b\u012brsha and the light half of Pausha are of little consequence. The dark fortnight of Pausha corresponding to the time of conception, the light half of \u00c7r\u0101vaka may be fixed upon as the period of birth.\n\n10. The fetuses from the bright half of M\u0101gha are born in the dark fortnight of \u00c7r\u0101vaka. The former part of Bh\u0101dra-pada may be fixed upon as the period of birth corresponding to the dark half of M\u0101gha.\n\n11. The fetuses conceived during the bright fortnight of Ph\u0101lguna are to come out in the latter half of Bh\u0101dra-pada; but those from the dark fortnight are born in the former half of \u0100\u00e7vayuja.\n\n12. The fetuses from the light fortnight of \u0100\u00e7vayuja will be produced as rain in the dark half of \u0100\u00e7vayuja; those coming into existence during the dark part of Caitra fall down as rain in the light half of K\u0101rttika.\n\n13. The cloud embryos formed in the eastern quarter will issue in the west, those formed in the west will issue in the east. In like manner the other directions and the winds are reversed (at the two periods compared).\n\n14. (Good symptoms, generally, are:) A refreshing soft breeze from the north, north-east or east; a clear sky; a Sun or Moon surrounded by a sleek, bright, and thick halo.\n\n15.

A rainbow, rumbling of thunder, lightning, a mock sun, beautiful twilight, troops of birds and wild deer emitting auspicious sounds from the north, north-east, or east;\n\n17. The planets large, beaming brightly, moving at the north (of the asterisms) and unhurt; trees with shoots unimpaired; men and quadrupeds merry:\n\n18. Such are the general symptoms announcing the prosperous development of all rain-embryos. There are, however, some special rules arising from the particular nature of the season, which I am about to propound forthwith.\n\n19. (Good symptoms are:) In the months of M\u0101rga\u015birsha and Pausha a red glow of the horizon at morn and evening, clouds and halos, not too severe a cold in M\u0101rga\u015birsha, and not too much snow in Pausha.\n\n20. Happy tokens in M\u0101gha are: a strong wind, a sun or moon dim by hoar frost, great cold, and a sun rising or setting with clouds.\n\n21. In Ph\u0101lguna are auspicious: a rough, violent gale, thick clouds showing a smooth surface, halos broken off, and a russet or red sun.\n\n22. In Caitra fetuses forming among wind, clouds, rain and halos are of good augury; in Vai\u1e63\u0101kha, such as are attended with clouds, wind, rain, lightning, and thunder are favourable.\n\n23. Clouds that at the period of embryo formation show the colour of pearl or silver, or the hue of Tamal, blue lotus or collyrium, or those that resemble aquatic animals, contain copious rain.\n\n24. Clouds shone upon by sharp sunbeams and riding on a soft breeze will, at the time of birth, pour out water, as if with a vengeance.\n\n25, 26. The signs of the miscarrying of the fetuses are meteors, thunderbolts, dense dusk, red glow of the quarters, earthquake, Fata Morgana, opaceous wedges (appearing on the Sun's disc), comets, planetary war, tornados, a porten-\ntous rain of blood or the like, a cloudy bar crossing the Sun's disc, a rainbow, an eclipse: by these and similar portents of three kinds an embryo gets destroyed.\n\n27. Signs precisely the reverse of those, both general and special for any particular season, by which the growth of an embryo is assured, produce the contrary results.\n\n28. A fetus commencing its development at (the Moon's standing in) the first and second Bhadrapada, first and second Ashadh\u00e2 and Rohini, in whatever season it may happen, will yield much rain.\n\n29. An embryo formed at \u00c7atabhishaj, Aclesh\u00e2, Ardra, Sv\u00e2ti and Magha is said to occasion fertility for many days, if unimpaired; but it will be disastrous, if hurt by portents of three kinds.\n\n30. Fetuses coming into being at (the Moon's conjunction with) one of the aforesaid asterisms during the months of Marga\u00e7irsha, Pausa, and the four following, will produce rain (after 195 days) for eight, six, sixteen, twenty-four, twenty, and three days severally.\n\n31. If the asterism is occupied by an evil planet, the embryos will result in hail, thunderbolts, and rain of fishes; but if the Sun or Moon be in conjunction with or looked at by a benign planet, in copious showers.\n\n32. Too much rain, without apparent cause, at the forming of fetuses, tends to their destruction; if the quantity of rain fallen (as measured in a basin used for the purpose) exceeds an eighth of a Drona, the fetus gets dissolved.\n\n33. If a fetus, prosperous in other respects, is, at the time of birth, prevented from producing rain in consequence of planetary and other evil influences, it will (afterwards) give rain mixed with hail, and that at the same period as when it first developed.\n\n34. As the milk of the milch cow grows hard, if retained too long, so does the water, kept back beyond its time.\n\n35. An embryo, if attended with five phenomena, will\n\n1 To wit, celestial, atmospheric, and terrestrial; cf. ch. xi. 2; xvi. 2.\n2 See ch. xxiii. 2.\n3 Viz. wind, rain, lightning, thunder, and clouds; see ver. 37.\nextend its rain over a hundred *yojanas*, and for every phenomenon less, over half the extent of the former,\\(^1\\) but, if it has only one concomitant, over five *yojanas* around.\n\n36. The quantity of rainfall will at the season amount to a Droga (in basin measure), if the embryo has five concomitants; three \u0100dhakas are the results of wind, six of lightning, nine of clouds, twelve of thunder.\n\n37. An embryo has five concomitant signs, if it develops amidst wind, rain, lightning, thunder, and clouds. Such a one brings much rain. One which at the time of formation loses too much water, produces at the period of birth a drizzling rain.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXII.**\n\n**Pregnancy of the Air.**\n\n1. The eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh days of the bright half of Jyaishtha are the days of the air's pregnancy, which are auspicious if the breeze is gentle and favourable, and the sky covered with smooth clouds.\n\n2.

For eliciting this meaning he must have recourse to the quite fanciful and unwarrantable supposition that *erire* implies, though not formally expresses, a causative sense. But it is sufficiently clear that garbhatvam *er* is only a variation of such common expressions as garbhatvam *ay\u0101*, *\u0101gam*, *apad*, or *y\u0101*, *gam*, or *upay\u0101*, *upagam*, etc. Garbhatvam *erire* is, according to English idiom, simply, \"they became garbus.\" The Maruts become garbus again, in other words, \"retire to their place of birth\" (mythologically, Pri\u1e63\u1e47i's womb, e.g. R. V. 6, 66, 3), or \"disappear.\" The whole verse in English is: \"And after they disappeared again of their own accord, rendering their name to be revered.\"\njunction with) Sv\u0101ti, Vi\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101, Anur\u0101dh\u0101 and Jye\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101, then the rain-embryos,\\(^1\\) melting away, are lost for the months of \u00c7r\u0101vana, Bh\u0101drapada, \u0100\u00e7ayuja and K\u0101rttika, successively.\n\n3. The four days mentioned are lucky if uniform, but bode no good if varying, in which latter case they are stated to bring danger from robbers. Let me quote the following stanzas of Vasishtha's:\n\n4. \"Such days of pregnancy as are accompanied by lightning, trickling drops, masses of dust and wind, the Sun and Moon being overcast, contain in them the germs of happiness.\n\n5. And when most splendid flashes of lightning keep near the good regions (viz. north, north-east, and east), then also the discriminating observer may announce the prosperous growth of all products of the field.\n\n6, 7. A rain of dust and water; gentle motions of young children; good-sounding notes of birds and their frolicking in dust, water and the like; halos, sleek and not too much impaired, round the Sun and Moon: from such signs is to be anticipated with certainty a (future) rain promoting the growth of all products of the field.\n\n8. If the clouds are sleek, compact and tending to turn from east to south, there will be a plenteous rain, causing the full development of all crops.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXIII.**\n\n*Prognostics for the Quantity of Rainfall.*\n\n1. From the quantity of rain falling at (the Moon's conjunction with) P\u016brva-A\u015b\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, etc., directly after the day of full moon of Jyaish\u1e6dha, should be told by the experts the\n\n\\(^1\\) Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, agreeably to its grammatical form, properly means \"bearing\" and \"womb,\" but in the same manner as racan\u0101, properly \"composing,\" has got the passive notion of \"composition,\" so dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 may have been taken in the passive sense of \"what is borne.\" In no other way can I account for its construction with parir\u016bpa, which applies also to receptacles, wombs; but in this instance dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 hardly denotes that which contains the embryo.\nquantity of water (to be expected) during the rainy season, along with the good or evil omens.\n\n2. The quantity of water must be determined by taking a basin, a *hasta* (cubit) in diameter, for hydrometer. Fifty Palas are equal to one \u0100\u1e0dhaka, by which standard the water that has fallen is to be measured.\n\n3. The prognostication of the quantity of rain is to begin as soon as there has been rain sufficient to make impressions in the soil\u00b9 or leave drops on the grass sprigs.\n\n4. Some say (that the measure is to be taken), whatever may be the extent of land rained upon;\u00b2 others propose a region of ten *yojanas* around;\u00b3 the opinion of Garga, Vasishtha and Par\u0101\u015bara is that the circle shall be one of twelve *yojanas* at the utmost.\u2074\n\n5. Generally it will rain again (in the season) at (the Moon\u2019s conjunction with) that same particular asterism (P\u016brva-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, etc.), at which some (previous) rain has been falling. If it does not rain at P\u016brva-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101 and the rest, there will be no rain at all (during the season).\n\n\u00b9 In the printed text \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0923\u0940 is erroneously separated from \u0938\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e (i.e. \u0938\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0903).\n\n\u00b2 Utpala: \u0915\u094c\u0936\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0915\u093e\u0936\u094d\u092e\u092f\u092e\u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u092f\u0925\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u092f\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0947 \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0915\u0925\u092f\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u092f\u0925\u093e\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0930\u093f\u092a\u093f \u092e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0902 \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0936\u094b\u092d\u0928\u0902 \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0915\u093e\u0936\u094d\u092e\u092f\u0903\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u091a\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0923 \u091a\u092f\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0907\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0935\u093e\u092f \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0935\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0965\n\n\u00b3 Comm. \u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947\u092f \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0932\u093e\u092d\u0903\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0926\u0936\u094d\u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947\n\n\u2074 \u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0902 (\"the quantity of rain to be announced for the rainy season\") \u0928\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0939\u0941 \u0928\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0903\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923\u0947 \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0926\u0936\u094d\u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u092e\u092a\u0926\u0932\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0935\u093e\u092f \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0935\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0965\n\n\u2075 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092d\u0903\u0964 \u0905\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0903 \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0936\u094b\u092d\u0928\u0902 \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0965\n6-9. The quantity of rain at the asterisms Hasta, P\u016brva-Bhadrapad\u0101, Mriga\u015biras, Citra, Revat\u012b and Dhanishth\u0101 is stated to be (normally) 16 Dronas; at \u00c7atabhihasj, Jyeshth\u0101 and Sv\u0101ti 11; at K\u1e5bttik\u0101 10; at \u00c7ravana, Magha, Anur\u0101dh\u0101, Bharani and M\u016bla 14; at P\u016brva-Phalguna 25; at Punarvasu 20; at Vi\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101 and Uttara-Ash\u0101dha 20; at \u0100c\u0101lesh\u0101 13; at Uttara-Bhadrapad\u0101, Uttara-Phalguna and Rohi\u1e47\u012b 25; at P\u016brva-Bhadrapad\u0101 and Pushya 15; at \u0100\u00e7vini 12; at \u0100rdra 18 Dronas, provided all these asterisms are free from baneful influences.\n\n10. The asterism being vexed by the Sun, Saturn, a comet, or hurt by Mars, or portents of three sorts, there will be no weal, nor rain; but good will ensue, if the same is in conjunction with a benign planet and unscathed.\n\nChapter XXIV.\n\nThe Moon's Conjunction with Rohi\u1e47\u012b.\n\n1-3. On the top of the mountain where the gods have their abode, the parks of which resound with the humming of the bees upon the blossoms of the trees grown in the dells of the golden hills, and ring with the bustle of many birds and the sonorous notes of the song of Heaven's nymphs,\u2014there it was that Brhaspati told the matters concerning the Moon's conjunction with Rohi\u1e47\u012b. Having duly taken cognizance of them, as well as of those taught by Garga, Par\u0101\u00e7ara, K\u0101\u00e7yapa and Maya to the crowds of their pupils, I shall attempt to treat of the same subject in a (comparatively) short composition.\n\n4. It is by observing Rohi\u1e47\u012b in conjunction with the Moon in the dark half of Ash\u0101dha, that the astrologer must predict weal or woe, according to the teachings of authoritative works.\n\n5. How a future conjunction can be foretold has been shown by me in my Treatise under the head of \"Conjunction with Fixed Stars.\" The practical results, however, must be set forth as deduced from the Moon's (apparent) size,\nbrightness, colour, road, and also from omens and the direction of wind.\n\n6, 7. The divining Brahman, going to a spot north or east from the town, staying there three nights, attentive to the holy fire, is to draw a diagram of the planets and cluster of asterisms, and worship them by oblations with incense and flowers. He must occupy the sacred plot strewn with sacrificial grass, and adorned, at the four quarters, with vessels kept clean, and not blackened at the bottom, filled with gems, water, and herbs, and covered above with sprouts of trees.\n\n8. After taking all sorts of seeds, while delivering the Mah\u00e2vrata prayer, and putting them in a pot, he must immerse them in the water mixed with sacrificial grass and gold. Thereupon an offering with prayers to the Maruts, Varuna and Soma (i.e. the Moon).\n\n9. He should prepare a thin, black streamer, four hastas (cubits) long and three times as much raised above the ground. Having first ascertained the precise direction of the quarters, he should by means of that instrument observe the wind during the Moon's conjunction.\n\n10. For prognostics of the rains, the watches (\u00bc of the day) ought to be counted as corresponding to as many half-months,\n\n---\n\n1 The comm. intimates that tryahoshita implies fasting:\n\n2 The Comm. mentions a r. \u0939\u094c\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0915\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0902, which cannot be but a superficial innovation by some one whom the construction struck as very abrupt. The common r. is undoubtedly right, because a prayer to the Maruts may not be omitted from the ceremony.\nand the subdivisions of a watch as answering to days.\\footnote{i.e. the wind being favourable during the first watch, rain will fall during the first half of \u0106r\u0101vapa; in the contrary case, there will be no rain during the same period; and so forth.} The wind when tending to veer round from east to south is favourable. A wind is \u201csteady\u201d if it is constant.\n\n11. As for those seeds kept in the waterpot, such as have sprouted at the end of the conjunction will grow prosperously, and that for such a part only as has sprouted.\n\n12. The air resounding with the cries of tranquil (i.e. not vexed) birds and animals, a clear sky and a favourable wind, are blessed signs at the Moon\u2019s conjunction with Rohin\u012b. Forthwith I will tell the effects of the clouds and wind.\n\n13. Big clouds that, resembling snakes, some of whom are coiled, others showing only their bellies, others again their backs,\\footnote{The belly of the snake is fair, the back dark.} appear somewhere spotted, elsewhere white, at other places again dark, while surrounded by glittering flashes of lightning which cover the heavens.\n\n14. Or the sky is studded, as it were, with variegated clouds fair as the calix of the expanded lotus and tinged at the outer edges by the gleam of the morning sun, or showing the dark lustre of bees, saffron, the blossom of \\textit{Butea frondosa}.\n\n15. Or the firmament is occupied by gloomy clouds and illumined at the same time by flashing lights and a rainbow, as if it were a forest that, crowded with elephants and buffalos, stands in full blaze.\n\n16. Or the canopy is shrouded by clouds bearing likeness to mounds of collyrium or imitating the brightness of snow, pearl, mussel-shells and moonbeams.\n17. Or it is decked with clouds dark like Tam\u0101l or bees, and comparable to elephants, having lightning for golden girdles, (white) cranes for prominent tusks, trickling rain for frontal juice, the moving extremities for trunks, the varicoloured rainbow for a banner erected by way of ornament.\\(^1\\)\n\n18. And also when heaps of clouds, in a sky tinged red by the gleam of dawn and twilight, show the deep hue of blue lotuses, or when they appear to have appropriated to themselves the lustre of Hari (the Sun) clad in yellow.\n\n19. If clouds with (alternately) deep and sharp sounds that blend with the cries of peacocks, c\u0101taka-birds, and frogs, stretch all over the sky, hanging down to the horizon, they will pour on the earth a flood of rain.\n\n20. If the heavens are occupied by a multitude of such-like clouds as described, during three days, or two, or one day, there will be plenty of rain, abundance of food, and gladness among mankind.\n\n21. Neither good nor rain is to be expected from clouds rough, small, shattered by the wind, noiseless, and resembling camels, crows, spectres, monkeys, or other sinister creatures.\n\n22. The Sun darting fierce rays in a cloudless sky brings rain; so, too, a nightly canopy bright with stars like a lake that, abounding in white lotuses, shines in full bloom.\n\n23. Clouds coming up from east make the field products ripen; those which arise from south-east cause the raging of fires; by those which come from the south, the corn is ruined; by clouds issuing from south-west, the prices go down;\\(^2\\) clouds which originate in the west bring a choice rain.\n\n24. Clouds looming up from the north-west result in a rain seconded by a strong wind, and that only here and there; a thick rain follows upon clouds in the northern region; exceedingly good corn may be expected from clouds gathering to the north-east. The wind, too, in the different quarters, produces similar results.\n\n25. Falling meteors, lightning, thunderbolts, red glow of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0903 \u0928\u0943\u092a\u0917\u091c\u093e\u0903 \u092e\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\\(^2\\) Comm. r. \u0905\u0927\u093f \u201chalf,\u201d viz. of the crops, which r. seems preferable.\nthe horizon, tornadoes, earthquakes, and sounds of wild deer and birds, should be observed, as well as the clouds.\n\n26. The water-jars spoken of before, placed north, east, etc., and marked with the names (of the quarters), foreshow the months of \u00c7r\u0101vana, Bh\u0101drapada, and so forth. If a jar proves full, the month denoted by it will yield rain; if empty,\\(^1\\) there will be no rain; if diminished in volume of water, one must make a calculation in proportion.\n\n27. By means of water-vessels marked with the king\u2019s name, and others marked with the names of the quarters, should be foretold the fortunes (of the king and members of the four classes), in proportion to the pots being broken, empty, diminished, or quite full.\n\n28. If the Moon, while standing on the northern road, either far off or near, makes her conjunction with Rohini, one may decisively announce nothing but woe to mankind in every way.\n\n29. If the Moon, trenching on Rohini, moves northward, there will be a good rain, but, at the same time, numerous disasters. By entering into conjunction from the northward, without touching, she produces plenteous rain and blessing.\n\n30. Should the Moon take her stand in the midst of Rohini\u2019s wain,\\(^2\\) men, having no drink but water from sun-heated vessels, and rendered helpless, run about, the little children begging them for food.\\(^3\\)\n\n31. If Rohini goes after\\(^4\\) the Moon-god just rising, then good ensues, and maidens, love-sick, wholly yield to their lovers\u2019 power.\n\n32. Should the Moon-god follow Rohini from behind (\\(i.e.\\) from the west), like a wooer his dear love, then men, wounded by Cupid\u2019s shafts, will stand under the sway of womankind.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0936\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915 in the text is, of course, a misprint for \u0936\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915\u093f.\n\n\\(^2\\) See ch. ix. 25, footnote.\n\n\\(^3\\) This means, in common prose, that there is drought, and in consequence thereof hard times.\n\n\\(^4\\) \\(i.e.\\) if Rohini at the Moon\u2019s rising is seen at the west side.

When the Moon stands south-east from Rohini, there is to be great calamity; when south-west, the products of the field, smitten by land-plagues, are lost; when north-west, the gathering of grain is middling; when north-east, there are to be many advantages, good growth of the products, higher prices fetched, and the like.\n\n34. It may happen that the Moon touches the junction star, or that she screens it by her disc. At the former contingency they assert the peril to be dreadful; at an occultation, the king is killed by his wife.\n\n35. If at the time of the cows coming home, a bull, or even any black beast,\\(^1\\) takes the lead, there will be much rain; if the animal be black and white, the rain is middling in quantity; and if white, there will be no rain at all. A proportionate estimate (of rain to be expected) is to be made with cattle of other colours.\n\n36. If the Moon, when in conjunction with Rohini, is not seen in the overclouded sky, great danger from sickness is imminent, but, at the same time, the earth will be provided with plenty of water and grain.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXV.**\n\n*The Moon's Conjunction with Sv\u0101ti.*\n\n1. The same effects as at the conjunction with Rohini has the Moon's conjunction with Sv\u0101ti and Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, which all of them ought to be observed in the bright half of the month of Ash\u0101\u1e0dha. How far there is a difference, I am now going to set forth.\n\n2. If it rains in the first part (terce) of night (during the Moon's stay) in Sv\u0101ti, all field products will thrive; if in the second part, sesamum, beans, peas; if in the third, there will be summer corn, but no autumnal growth.\n\n3. Rain falling during the first part of the day produces excellent rain (for the future); that which comes in the second part brings the same, but insects and snakes too.\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0917\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0903.\nModerate rain will result from rainfall during the last part. If it rains both day and night, there will be (afterwards) an uninterrupted rain.\n\n4. There is a star due north of Citr\u0101 (Spica Virginis), called Ap\u0101nvatsa. The conjunction with Sv\u0101ti taking place when the Moon is not far from the said star, is beneficial.\n\n5. If on the seventh day of the dark half of M\u0101gha snow falls, the Moon standing in Sv\u0101ti, or if the wind is vehement, or a rainy cloud is incessantly rumbling; or if the heavens, wherefrom sun, moon, and stars, have disappeared, are scattered over with garlands of lightning, one may be sure that the rainy season will be rich in all sorts of crops, so as to gladden the country people.\n\n[6. In the same manner one must consider the Moon's conjunction with Sv\u0101ti, when occurring in the month of Ph\u0101lguna, Caitra, or dark half of Vai\u00e7\u0101kha, and particularly in \u0100sh\u0101dha.]\n\nChapter XXVI.\n\nThe Moon's Conjunction with \u0100sh\u0101dha.\n\n1. At the time of full moon in \u0100sh\u0101dha, some seeds, weighed in equal portions, should be kept for a night. Such seeds as prove the next day to have increased will thrive; such as have diminished will not flourish. The spell used as incantation to the balance is as follows.\n\n2. \"To be praised by the spell is Sarasvat\u012b, the truthful goddess.

Maybe that Sarasvati in older times had the attributes of the Greek goddess Themis. To explain the cosmical function of the goddess is no less difficult. Since Tul\u0101 (i.e., an attribute or part, an\u00e7a, of Sarasvati) is the daughter of Aditi (i.e., Not-light), and of the family of Ka\u00e7yapa (i.e., Crepusculum), she may denote the horizon, the limit between day and night; hence the words in v. 3. About Aditi and Ka\u00e7yapa, cf. preface to the text, p. 41. I will add here that Aditi is the same idea as in the later Sanskrit ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, the unseen, highest power or eternity. It is a general rule that the \u201cunseen\u201d is higher than the \u201cvisible,\u201d the latter being only a part (an\u00e7a) of the former. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is higher than Arjuna, though both are essentially the same and inseparable.\n\n2 i.e., the receptacles wherein the things to be weighed are put.\n\nComm.: \u092f\u091a\u094d\u091a \u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0923\u093f \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n3 Comm. \u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u0940\u0928 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947\u0964\n\n4 Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0903:\n\n\u0938\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0940\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0938\u0916\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u094b \u0927\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u0947\u0964\n\u0928\u093e\u0926\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0924\u094d \u0915\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0926\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0965\n\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0936\u093f \u092e\u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0964\n\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0936\u093f \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0940\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902 \u0917\u0943\u0939\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u092f\u092e\u0965\n\nVOL.

In case these are not procurable, one should make one from Acacia Catechu, or from a shaft by whom a man has been wounded. The measure is a span (=12 digits.)\n\n10. Such substances as, being weighed, prove to have diminished in weight, will be lost; such as have increased will thrive; such as continue in the same condition will but indifferently come on. This is called the mystery of weighing with the balance, which one may apply also at the Moon's conjunction with Rohini.\n\n11. Evil planets standing in Sv\u0101ti Ash\u0101dha or Rohini, are mischievous. If an intercalary month (intercalary Ash\u0101dha) is the cause that there are two conjunctions, one should, after devotional fasting, observe both conjunctions.\n\n12.

Bombay, 1865), the example given is: \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f \u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f; with the derivative \u0915\u094b\u0937\u0903. Cf. B. and R. Skr.

Apparently a different word is ko\u1e63a, kosha, \"the interior of something, calice, case,\" which is etymologically identical with English house, whence follows that the orthography and pronunciation ko\u1e63a, though Vedic, is as far removed from the original form as gva\u1e63ura, gushka, etc.\nAsh\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101), the consequences are (successively): good harvest, raging of fires, little, middling, very good rain, much rain, seconded by wind, abundant and good rain.\n\n14. If after the full moon of Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, on the fourth day of the dark half, at the asterism of P\u016brva-Bhadrapad\u0101, the Rain-god pours his showers, the rainy season is favourable; otherwise not.\n\n[15.

When an easterly wind\\(^1\\) blows from heaven, rolling on, dashing the tops of the eastern ocean's billows, at the same time clashing with the dense beams of Sun or Moon, then one may be sure that the earth, covered by a roof of dark clouds extending all around, will abound in autumnal field products, and her surface be adorned with luxuriant vernal\\(^2\\) corn.\n\n2. When at the period of the conjunction (with Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101) a south-eastern wind, battering the peaks of the Malaya mountains,\\(^3\\) blows at the time the Day-god is about to disappear, then the earth, in continual blaze from the flames sweeping along her surface, emits (as it were) a heap of ashes along with the glowing sighs heaving up from her body.\n\n3. When at the said conjunction a very rough, blustering south wind flutters through the leaves of the corypha, the awnings of creepers and trees, making the monkeys dance, then the clouds, rising with great difficulty, and rubbed as\n\n\\(^1\\) On the day of full moon in \u0100sh\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, it is to be understood, here and in the sequel.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0935\u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924 in the printed text is an error for \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924.\n\n\\(^3\\) An error, committed also by Sabandhu, in his V\u0101savadatt\u0101 (p. 196, sq.).\nelephants by the sharp points of the T\u0101l,\\(^1\\) niggardly yield but few water-drops.\n\n4. When unremittingly a south-west wind hovers at sunset, tossing up and down in the sea heaps of small cardamoms, averrhoas and cloves, then the earth, decked by a heavy load of scattered broken bones of men who have perished by hunger and thirst, appears wild and restless, like a spouse maddened by grief at the loss of her husband.\n\n5. When there is a strong gale from the west about sunset, stirring every now and anon with heavy squalls, and hurling up the dust, then the earth, albeit stored with grain, will have to sustain the battles of mighty monarchs, and show everywhere an unbroken row of flesh, fat and blood.\n\n6. If at full moon in \u0100sh\u0101\u1e0dha a north-west wind blows about the time of sunset, vehement in his course like an eagle, one may be certain that earth, glad of the briskly-falling drops of rain, and noisy with the loud sounds of the frogs, and showing everywhere the brilliant verdure of the corn-fields, will, for the multitude of pleasures, seem to possess the fullness of blessings.\n\n7. And when, at the end of summer, a northerly breeze is blowing, fragrant with the sweet-scented flowers of Nau-clea Kadamba, while the sun's crown of rays is screened by Mount Meru, then the clouds, enraged that by the roaming flashes of lightning all becomes illuminated, will fill, as in a fury, the earth with showers, by which the lunar beams are concealed.\n\n8. When there is a blustrous north-easterly wind, cool, courted by the gods and scented by the blossoms of Punn\u0101g, agallochum and P\u0101rij\u0101ta, then earth, restored to youthful vigour by the abundance of water, will have a profusion of ripe grown corn; the sovereigns will curb their foes and protect the classes of society with the utmost justice.]\n\n\\(^1\\) The poet quibbles upon t\u0101la, \"Borassus flabelliformis,\" and \"flap, slap.\"\nChapter XXVIII.\n\nForetokens of Instant Rain.\n\n1. If in the rainy season the Moon, occupying an aquatic asterism\\(^1\\) of the ecliptic, at the time of prognostication, is on the horizon, or, during the bright month-half, in the fourth, seventh, or tenth mansion, she will presently send forth water, and that in great quantity, if she be looked at by benign planets; in little quantity, if looked at by evil ones. Venus does the same when under the same circumstances.\n\n2. If the person inquiring touches any wet object or water, or anything termed after water,\\(^2\\) or if he stands near water, or is about to do some humid work, or if at the time of consultation the word \"water\" is being heard, the inquirer may be sure that without doubt it is going to rain very soon.\n\n3. When the Sun, in the rainy season, dazzling by extreme splendour, while lingering on the Mountain of Sunrise, shines like molten gold or lustrous beryl, he procures rain on the same day. So, too, when, high in the meridian, he is darting forth most keen rays.\n\n4. The water tasteless, the sky coloured like cows' eyes or crows' eggs, the air serene, moisture of salt, calmness of wind, much tumbling of fishes ashore, repeated croaking of frogs, these are tokens of coming rain.\n\n5. Cats strongly scratching the ground with their nails, rust and a musty smell of iron implements, and dikes made by children in the high road, announce rain to be approaching.\n\n6. Mountains resembling heaps of collyrium, or their cloughs wrapt in vapour, and halos of the colour of cocks' eyes round the Moon, bring rain.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cancer, Capricorn, or Pisces.\n\n\\(^2\\) Comm. gives for examples: \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0927\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093e \u0905\u092e\u0943\u0924\u093e\u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0964 The dictionaries only mention \u0905\u092e\u0943\u0924\u093e, Cassia Tora; but pa and pilaka are synonymous, and therefore interchangeable terms.\n7. Ants shifting their eggs without mishap, snakes copulating and climbing upon the trees, and cows frisking, are signs of rain.\n\n8. Rain will fall very soon, when the lizards on the tops of the trees keep their eyes fixed upon the firmament, and cows are looking up to the Sun.\n\n9. If cattle are unwilling to leave the house, shaking their ears and hoofs, and similarly dogs, one may state that rain is about to come down.\n\n10. When dogs are standing on the thatches or look steadily up to the heavens, or when lightning at day-time arises from the north-east, the earth's surface will be levelled by exceedingly much rain.\n\n11. When the Moon is hued like the eyes of a parrot or dove, or honey-coloured, and when a mock-sun appears in the sky, then rain will ere long fall from heaven.\n\n12. When there is thunder at night, blood-red and perpendicular lines of lightning at day-time, and a fresh easterly breeze, rain is at hand.\n\n13. Fall of rain is near, if the shoots of creepers erect themselves aloft, the birds bathe in water and dust, and creeping worms betake themselves to the sprigs of grass.\n\n14. At dawn or twilight clouds showing the same colour as peacocks, parrots, blue jays or c\u00e2taka-birds, or having the lustre of roses and red lotuses, and resembling in shape waves, hills, crocodiles, tortoises, boars, fishes, and piled up with manifold breaks, yield water within short time.\n\n15. Such clouds also as, being white at the ends like stucco or moonlight, lustrously black in the middle as collyrium or bees, with many breaks, sleek, trickling, divided in stairs, issue from the east and move to the westward, or after looming up from the west veer eastward, presently send forth plenty of rain upon earth.\n\n16.

If the sky wears the tinge of francolines' feathers, and the crowds of birds warble forth merrily at sunrise and sunset, day and night, the clouds will pour out rain very soon.]\n\n18. The so-called \"unerring\" sunbeams,\\(^2\\) stretched upward like the hands, as it were, of the Mountain of Sunset, and clouds sounding hollow as the ground, are important signs of (instant) rain.\n\n19. If the Moon, during the rainy season, stands in the seventh mansion from Venus, and is looked at by a benign planet, or stands in the fifth, seventh, or ninth mansion from Saturn, there is a tendency to rain.\n\n20. Not unfrequently rain ensues at the planets' heliacal rising or setting, their conjunction, and their entering in a new division,\\(^3\\) or at the end of a half-month, of a half-year, and certainly at the Sun's staying in \u00c1rdr\u00e1.\n\n21. Rain falls also at a conjunction of Mercury and Venus, of Mercury and Jupiter, and of Jupiter and Venus. From a meeting of Saturn arises peril from wind and fire, unless they are looked at by, or in conjunction with, good planets.\n\n22. When the planets tend to cling\\(^4\\) to the Sun, forward or backward,\\(^5\\) then they will make the earth, as it were, one sea.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXIX.**\n\n*Prognostics from Flowers and Plants.*\n\n1.

The time during which the stars are indistinct, before sunrise and after sunset,\\(^1\\) is the time of dawn and twilight.\\(^2\\) The signs of it, which produce effects, are the following:\n\n2. Wild deer, augural birds, wind, halos, mock suns or moons, cloudy bars crossing the solar orb, tree-shaped clouds, rainbows, Fata Morgana, peculiar solar beams, staffs in the air, dense dust, glossiness and colour.\n\n3. A wild beast, repeatedly uttering loud and horrible shrieks, bespeaks the destruction of a village; being blasted\\(^3\\) by the sun and screaming from the right side,\\(^4\\) he makes the military forces to be slain.\n\n\\(^1\\) The expression in the original is, properly, \"having half set,\" i.e. \"half the orb still appearing above the horizon.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0903:\n\n\u0905\u0939\u0940\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e \u092f\u093e \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0903 \u0938\u093e \u091a \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0964\n\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0921\u093f\u0915\u093e \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u0941 \u092f\u093e\u0935\u0926\u094d \u091c\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0924\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0936\u092e\u094d\u0965\n\nThe word jyoti, instead of jyotis, is worth being remarked.

If the animal does so from the left, there will be a battle. If he happens to be on the right side and unmolested, an encounter of armies will ensue. Should a great many animals or the wind stand in mixed quarters, during dawn or twilight, then there will be rain.\n\n5. A twilight during which wild beasts and birds, vexed, raise cries from the east, bodes the ruin of the land; one resounding with the screams of animals, blasted by the sun, from the southern region, points to the capture of the town.\n\n6. Ill-omened is the twilight, if a strong wind, raising dust and clods, with great noise shakes dwellings, trees, and gateways, and vehemently throws the birds down.\n\n7. Auspicious is the twilight, if animals and birds, unafflicted, send forth soft notes, and if there is no wind, or only a gentle breeze by whose rubbing the foliage of the trees is being slightly moved.\n\n8. Sleek staffs in the air, lightning, fish-like clouds, a mock-sun, a halo, a rainbow, straight lines resembling fragmentary rainbows and distinct sunbeams, at the time of twilight, bring speedy rain.\n\n9. The Sun's rays being broken off, unequal, dissipated, unnatural, crooked, turned to the leftward, thin, short, crippled, and dimmed, bring war and drought.\n\n10. The Sun's beams being brilliant, clear, straight, long, turned to the right, in a cloudless sky, tend to the weal of mankind.\n\n11. The bright, distinct, unbroken, straight sunbeams that extend from the horizon up to the midst or over the whole of the heavens, are the so-called \"unerring\" beams. These produce rain.\n\n12.

Copper-red sunbeams cause the death of a general; yellow and rosy ones, his ill-fortune; greenish-yellow ones, the ruin of cattle and crops; dark purple ones, the loss of kine; madder-coloured rays occasion consternation, owing to the sword and fires; tawny ones, a rain with wind; ashy-coloured ones, drought; spotted and greyish rays\\(^1\\) cause slight rain.\n\n15. If at the time of twilight dust, tinged like the blossom of Pentapetes Phoenicea, or like collyrium powder, goes up to the Sun, mankind will be afflicted by hundreds of diseases. White dust presages men's prosperity and bliss.\n\n16. A compound of solar rays, clouds and wind, in the shape of a staff, is called an (airy) \"staff.\" If seen in the intermediate regions, it is baleful to monarchs; if in the cardinal points, it is so to Brahmans, Kshatriyas, etc.\\(^2\\)\n\n17. A staff appearing at the beginning, middle, or end of the day,\\(^3\\) causes danger from the sword and grief. If white, it destroys the Brahmans; if red, the Kshatriyas, etc., and that in the direction to which it is turned.\n\n18. A dark blue tree-like cloud, with milk-white top, in the midst of the canopy, and screening the Sun, as well as clouds with yellow streaks and big at the bottom, procures much rain.\n\n19. If a tree-like cloud arises behind a sovereign on march, he will be killed; if it looks like a young tree, the prince royal or minister will die.\n\n20.

Dawn in the rainy season being attended with ill-shaped clouds, Fata Morgana, mist, dust and smoke, puts a stop to the rain; in any other season, it occasions the raging of the sword.\n\n22. The natural colour of twilight during the different seasons, to begin with the cold season, is red, yellow, blank, variegated, nelumbium-hued and crimson, each of which is favourable in the proper season. Any deviation from this rule is portentous.\n\n23. A cloud fragment in the shape of a man with a weapon, and tending to the Sun, points to danger from the foe. When a bright airy city (i.e. Fata Morgana) is approached by the Sun, a (beleaguered) town will be taken; when the same is crossed by the Sun, the town will be destroyed.\n\n24. The Sun being concealed by white and far-stretching clouds on the right side\\(^1\\) bestows rain; so, too, does the Day-god, being covered by clouds resembling tufts of Andropogon grass, and issuing from a quarter not blasted.\\(^2\\)\n\n25. A white cloudy bar through the Sun's orb at the time of his rising causes disaster to the king; one of bloody appearance occasions the raging of armies; one shining like gold makes armies prosper.\n\n26. Two colossal mock-suns, one on either side of the Sun, bring plentiful rain; but if mock-suns surround the Sun in four directions, there will not be one drop of rain.\n\n27. Clouds at dawn or evening twilight, in the form of banners, umbrellas, rocks, elephants, or horses, bode victory; blood-red ones, a battle.\n\n28. Clouds suspended like heaps of smoke from straw fire, and smooth in appearance, make the armies of monarchs prosper.\n\n29. Clouds at twilight hanging down, or tree-like, or\n\n\\(^1\\) From the south.\n\n\\(^2\\) About \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 and \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0923, cf. ch. lxxxvi. 12, and Ind. Stud. x. p. 202.\nrough in appearance and rosy, are auspicious; such as resemble towns, bring good luck.\n\n30. A twilight accompanied with the cries of vexed birds, foxes, and wild beasts, with airy staffs, dust, cloudy bars, and the like, or with daily recurring unnatural solar phenomenas, foreshows the ruin of land, king, and welfare.\n\n31. Dawn produces its results immediately; evening twilight the same night, or after three days; halos, dust and cloudy bars show their effects either instantly or a week after. The same with solar beams (of peculiar cast), rainbows, lightning, mock-suns, clouds, and wind. Birds do so the same day or that day week; wild beasts in a week.\n\n32. Twilight sheds its gleam (and shows its effects) over one yojana; lightning illumines by its flickering six yojanas; the sound of thunder extends over five yojanas; no limit can be assigned to the falling of meteors.\n\n33. The circle termed a mock-sun shines three yojanas far; a cloudy bar, five; a halo is visible five or six yojanas; the rainbow shows its lustre for ten yojanas.\n\nChapter XXXI.\n\nThe Glow at the Horizon.\n\n1. The glow at the horizon, if yellow, presages peril to the king; if fire-red, the ruin of the country; if rubiound and observed with wind from the left, it occasions the loss of the crops.\n\n2. One that makes its appearance with great brilliancy, and distinctly sets off shadow, as the Sun does, bodes great danger to the king; if bloody-red, it betokens the raging of the sword.\n\n3, 4.

The asterisms Uttara-Phalguni, Hasta, Citra, Svati, Punarvasu, Mrigasira and Agyini constitute the division ruled by Vayu. The foretokens belonging to it show themselves a week before the event, and are the following:\n\n9. A wind that raises the dust of the earth into a most hazy sky, and bruises trees in his course, while the Sun shines with faint rays.\n\n10. By an earthquake of Vayu's, it is said that crops, rain, woods and weeds get damaged; merchants are to suffer by intumescence, heavy sighing, madness, fever, and cough.\n\n11. Handsome persons, men of arms, physicians, women, poets, singers, dealers, artisans, the Surashtrians, Kurus, Magadhas, Da\u00e7arpas, and Matsyas have to suffer too.\n\n12.

The firmament, covered with falling stars and meteors, stands in a blaze, as it were, by the glow of the quarters; fire, seconded by wind, stirs abroad for a week.\n\n14. By an earthquake ruled by Agni, the rain-clouds vanish, the water-reservoirs become empty, the potentates quarrel, herpes, scab, fever, erysipelas eruptions and jaundice prevail.\n\n15. Ardent and fierce characters, the Acmakas, Angas, Bahlkas, Tanganas, Kalingas, Vangas, Dravidas (or Dramidhas), and various tribes of \u00c7abara-savages are to suffer.\n\n16.

Clouds that, bulky as mountains in motion, similar in colour to buffalo's horn, swarms of bees or snakes, emit a deep sound and lightning, and pour out rain.\n\n18. An earthquake during Indra's division destroys such as are renowned by learning, family and lineage, sovereigns and headmen of corporations. It produces dysentery, influenza, mouth disease, and violent vomiting.\n\n19. It afflicts the K\u0101cis, Yugandharas, Pauravas, Kir\u0101tas, K\u012bras, Abhis\u0101ras, Halas, Madras, Arbuda, Suv\u0101stu, and M\u0101lava, but yields desirable rain.\n\n20.

Its signs are:\n\n21. Thick, soft muttering clouds, showing the dark lustre of blue lotus, bees or collyrium mixture, illumined by lightning, and diffusing prickly drops.\n\n22. An earthquake at Varu\u1e47a's division hurts the denizens of the seas and rivers, bestows very much rain, and strikes the Gonardas, Cedis, Kukuras, Kir\u0101tas and Videhas; at the same time, however, quarrels cease.\n\n23.

Meteors are the dropping fruits of merit enjoyed in heaven, in visible form. They are divided into five kinds: ignescent balls, meteors, thunderbolts, lightning, and (shooting) stars.\\(^1\\)\n\n2. A meteor (in restricted sense) produces its effects in a fortnight; likewise an ignescent ball; a thunderbolt in three half-months; lightning in six days; a (shooting) star the same.\n\n3. Three out of the five phenomena of meteors have full effects, viz., lightning, meteors, and thunderbolts; a shooting star is said to produce the fourth part of the full effect, and an ignescent ball the half.\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u092e\u094d \u091a \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0932\u094b\u0915\u092a\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u0941\u092d\u093e\u0937\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0932\u0942\u091a\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u091c\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0903\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092d\u0903\u0964\n\nThe explanation of these mythological phrases is not difficult. Ulka, in the most common acceptation of the term, is a \"shooting\" or \"falling star.\" Now, the notions of star, ray and darted weapons are generally expressed by the same word. One instance may suffice, viz., the etymological identity of Sanskrit \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d and Greek \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. Hence an ulka may be called an astrom. The notion of \"shooting\" or \"shot\" finds its expression in \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d; that of \"falling,\" in \u0935\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0941\u0924\u093f and \u092a\u0924\u094d.\n4. A thunderbolt comes, crackling, down upon men, elephants, horses, wild beasts, rocks, houses, trees, or cattle, at the same time wheeling and rending the surface of the earth.\n\n5. Lightning frightens on a sudden animals by its crackling, moves flaming in wide zigzags, and falls down upon living creatures and faggot piles.\n\n6. An ignescent ball is small, with a short tail, and continues visible over a space of forty cubits or more. It looks like a burning coal, and measures two cubits.\n\n7. A (shooting) star is (apparently) a cubit in extension, and white, red, or of the colour of lotus filaments. It moves in the heavens horizontally, downwards or upwards, as if being drawn.\n\n8. A meteor (in restricted sense) is large at the top, and increases in size in falling, dragging all along behind itself a very thin tail. Its length (the tail included) is three cubits and a half. There are many sorts of it.\n\n9. Such as resemble spectres, weapons, asses, camels, crocodiles, monkeys, boars, ploughs, wild beasts, great lizards, snakes, and smoke, have evil consequences, as well as such as have two crests.\n\n10. Such as appear like banners, fishes, elephants, mountains, lotuses, the Moon, horses, glowed silver, or are shaped like the figures called \u010crivatsa, thunderbolt, conch and cross, bring times of plenty.\n\n---\n\n1 What here is called \"tail\" (pucca), is not to be confounded with the tail, or rather crest (gikha, c\u016bla) of a comet. The former is simply a result of optical illusion.\n\n2 Utpala r. \u010crivatsa, about which he remarks that it is well known, (prasiddha). From other passages it appears that he takes \u010crivatsa to be synonymous with \u010civ\u0101la, Eggle Marmelos. Cf. Weber, Fragment der Bhagavati, pp. 306, 312. The compound \u010civ\u0101la\u015br\u012bk\u1e63a\u1e47a\u015br\u012bp\u0101da\u015br\u012b, I presume; whereas Weber proposes to read \u010civ\u0101la\u015br\u012bk\u1e63a\u1e47a\u015br\u012bp\u0101da\u015br\u012b. The compound is a Bahuvr\u012bhi, and may be rendered \"whose \u010civ\u0101la\u015br\u012bk\u1e63a-figure possesses the proper marks.\"\n\n3 Comm. t\u0101pa\u015bc\u0101 kar\u1e63ya:\n\n\u091a\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0938\u092e\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a \u092a\u0924\u093f\u0924\u0935\u093e\u0964\n\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0938\u092e\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a \u0930\u093e\u092f\u0938\u0902\u092f\u0941\u0924\u093e\u0965\n11. Meteors, dropping in great numbers from the midst of the canopy, are pernicious to king and land. By whirling high in the sky, a meteor presages commotion among mankind.\n\n12. One coming in contact with the Sun or Moon, or issuing from either at the time of an earthquake, causes a hostile invasion, the king's death, famine, drought, and unsafety.\n\n13. A meteor destroys monarchs staying in town or those on march, according to its passing the Sun or Moon to the right. One dropping from the Sun in front of the traveller brings good.\n\n14. A meteor, being white, ruins the Brahmans; being red, the Kshatriyas; being yellow, the Vaigyas; and, being black, the C\u016bdras. The members of the four castes are also hurt, severally, by meteors falling upon the head, shoulder, side, and behind.\n\n15. A meteor of coarse appearance brings woe to Brahmans, by falling in a northerly direction; in an easterly direction, to Kshatriyas, and so forth. If it appears sleek, not crooked, entire, and is moving low, it tends to the prosperity of the same.\n\nIt is not necessary to point out how closely our author has imitated this passage.\n16. One that is grey, rosy, blue, crimson, fire-red, dusky, or ashy, and rough, visible at dawn or day-time, broken and moving in a crooked way, bodes danger from hostile invasion.\n\n17. In hurting asterisms or planets, a meteor is stated to be disastrous to whatever belongs to their department. By dashing against the Sun or Moon at the time of rising or setting, it is deadly for monarchs staying in town or on march.\n\n18. If P\u016brva-Phalguni, Punarvasu, Dhanish\u1e6dh\u0101, and M\u016bla are scathed by a meteor, damsels are to suffer. Brahmins and knights come to grief if Pushya, Sv\u0101ti, and \u010crava\u1e47a are attainted.\n\n19. The (so-called) constant and kind asterisms being hurt, sovereigns are afflicted; the harsh and cruel mansions being struck, thieves are to suffer; whereas artisans will suffer, should the swift and neutral asterisms be in the same predicament.\n\n20. By falling upon idols, meteors cause danger to king and land; by coming down upon an image of Indra, they occasion distress to sovereigns; by falling upon dwellings, they bring affliction to the owners.\n\n21. By hurting the planet of a particular region, a meteor causes suffering to the people in that quarter. If it comes down on a threshing-floor, agriculturists are to suffer. If it falls on a holy tree, the beings worshipped there are distressed.\n\n1 As enumerated in ch. xv. and xvi.\n\n2 Among the asterisms are called constant (\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924): Rohi\u1e47\u012b, Uttara-Bhadrapad\u0101, Uttara-A\u015b\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, and Uttara-Phalguni; kind (\u0938\u094c\u0926\u094d\u0927, \u0938\u0942\u091a\u0941): Mrga\u00e7iras, Citr\u0101, Anur\u0101dh\u0101, and Revat\u012b; harsh (\u0915\u0937\u094d\u091f): Bharani, Magh\u0101, P\u016brva-Bhadrapad\u0101, P\u016brva-A\u015b\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, and P\u016brva-Phalguni; cruel (\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0923, \u0926\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0918, \u0915\u094d\u0930\u0942\u0930): \u0100rdr\u0101, A\u015ble\u1e63h\u0101, Jyeshth\u0101, and M\u016bla; swift (\u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u091a\u0924\u0941): \u0100c\u0101ni, Tishya, Hasta, and Abhijit; neutral (\u0938\u093e\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0923, \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925): K\u1e5bttik\u0101 and Vi\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101. Cf. ch. xciii. 6-11; also Weber, Jyotisha, p. 95; and Naxatra, ii. 385.\n\n3 The planets of the eight regions, east, south-east, etc., are the Sun, Venus, Mars, R\u0101hu, Saturn, the Moon, Mercury, and Jupiter.\n22. A meteor, if coming down upon a city gate, bespeaks the ruin of the city; if on a bolt, the destruction of the people; if on a shrine of Brahma, it crushes the Brahmans; if on a cow-house, the cow-keepers.\n\n23. If at the moment of a meteor falling are heard such sounds as roaring, claps, instrumental music, song and clamours, they augur danger to the land and its ruler.\n\n24. A staff-like meteor, whose train continues for a long time visible in the sky, is dangerous for the king. So, too, one that appears in the air as though it were drawn by a thread, or one that resembles the banner of Indra.\u00b9\n\n25. By going backward, a meteor ruins head merchants; by going in a horizontal direction, king's wives; by tending downward, kings; by moving upward, Brahmans.\n\n26\u201328. A meteor shaped like a peacock's tail brings destruction to mankind; one creeping like a snake, is disastrous to women; a circular one, is fatal to the town; one in the form of an umbrella, to the court priest; one resembling a tuft of bamboo, is noxious to the kingdom. Mischievous also is one that bears a likeness to beasts of prey, or boars, and shows a crown of sparks, or is shattered to pieces, and attended with noise.\n\n29. One that looks like a rainbow, destroys the empire; one that dissolves itself in the heavens, undoes the clouds; one moving against the wind, in a crooked way or backwards, is not auspicious.\n\n30. Danger threatens the king from the quarter from which a meteor is approaching the town or host, but if the monarch marches off to the quarter where a meteor comes down blazing, he will ere long conquer his foes.\n\nChapter XXXIV.\n\nSigns of Halos.\n\n1. Halos consist of solar or lunar beams that, reflected by the wind, take a circular shape and show themselves in a slightly clouded sky in various colours and forms.\n\n\u00b9 About the banner of Indra, see ch. xliii.\n2. They are crimson, deep blue, pale yellow, dove-coloured, darkish, speckled grey, greenish, yellow or white, according to their being produced by Indra, Yama, Varuna, Nir\u1e5bti, V\u0101yu, \u015aiva, Brahma, or Agni.\n\n3. Kubera is the author of one having the hue of a peacock's neck; others produce halos of mixed colours. V\u0101yu's work also is a halo that ever and anon is fading away, having trifling results.\\(^1\\)\n\n4. A halo shining like the blue jay, peacock, silver, oil, milk, or water, being glossy and entirely round, bestows welfare and plenty, if appearing in its proper season.\\(^2\\)\n\n5. Mischievous is one that extends its course through the whole firmament, shining, variegated or blood-red, rough, broken, having the shape of a cart, bow, or triangle.\n\n6. On the appearance of a halo tinged like the peacock's neck, follows much rain; of a varicoloured one, the death of the king; of a dark purple one, unsafety; of one coloured as the rainbow or the red \u0100coka, war.\n\n7. When there is a glossy, thick halo, which shows the natural colour of the season, and is overcast with stratified clouds, it brings rain on the same day. So, too, does a yellow one, when the Sun is shining fiercely.\n\n8. A huge, hazy halo seen at dawn, noon, or twilight,\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0903:\n\n\u0938\u093f\u0924\u0926\u0940\u0924\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0938\u093f\u0924\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0924\u0935\u092d\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903\u0964\n\u0936\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093e\u092f \u0935\u093f\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u092f \u0917\u0941\u0923\u093e\u0935\u0927\u0903\u0965\n\n\\(^2\\) Much more perspicuous is the following passage from K\u0101cyapa:\n\n\u0936\u093f\u0916\u093f\u0930\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u092a\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093e\u092f \u0935\u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0936\u093f\u0916\u093f\u0938\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092d\u0903\u0964\n\u092a\u0940\u0935\u0947 \u0930\u091c\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0938\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0903\u0965\n\u0936\u094b\u0937\u093f\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0903\u0965\n\u0936\u093f\u0916\u093f\u0930\u0947 \u091c\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0935\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0917\u0941\u0923\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0935\u0903\u0965\n\nCurious are \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f and \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0903, instead of the locative, instrumental, or even accusative case.\nwhile blasted birds and wild deer emit their cries, causes unsafety, and, if hurt by lightning, meteors and the like, it slays the king by the sword.\n\n9.

If seen in the west, a rainbow announces rain at any time.\n\n7. A nocturnal rainbow in the east brings distress to the king; such a one being observed in the south, west, or north, will crush a chief commander, a grandee, or minister (severally).\n\n8.

XIV.\u2014On the Origin of the Buddhist Arthakath\u00e1s.\nBy the Mudliar L. Comrilla Vijasinha, Government Interpreter to the Ratnapura Court, Ceylon. With an Introduction by R. C. Childers, late of the Ceylon Civil Service.\n\nAbout eighteen months ago I was engaged in preparing an edition of Brahmaj\u00e1la Sutta, and of Buddhaghosa's commentary upon it which forms the first section of the Sumangala Vil\u00e1sini. Buddhaghosa's commentary upon Brahmaj\u00e1la Sutta is one of the most important of his writings, since it contains a detailed account of the First General Council, held immediately after Buddha's death for the purpose of settling the text of the Buddhist Scriptures. Intending to publish this work in the same volume with the Brahmaj\u00e1la which it comments upon, I began, and made considerable progress with, a translation of it. At the very outset I met with a difficulty, in the shape of an historical statement in Buddhaghosa's introductory verses which seemed in the highest degree improbable and untrustworthy. The first ten stanzas of the introduction run as follows:\u2014\n\nKarun\u00e1sittalahadayam pann\u00e1ppajottavihatamo hatamam\nSanar\u00e1mara lokagarum vande sugatam gativimuttam.\nBuddho 'pi buddhabh\u00e1va\u00f1 bh\u00e1veva ca eva saachik\u00e1te ca\nYam upagato gatamalo vande tam anuttaram dh\u00e1mmam.\nSugatassa oras\u00e1nam putt\u00e1na\u00f1 m\u00e1rasenam athan\u00e1nam\nAthannam pi samiham sirasa vande ariyass\u00fangham.\nIti me pasannamatino ratanattayavandamayam pu\u00f1\u00f1am\nYam suvilantarat\u00e1ya hitv\u00e1 tass' \u00e1nubh\u00e1vena,\nDighassa dighasutta\u00f1kitassa nipunasso dgamarass\u00e1\nBuddh\u00e1nubuddhasamvanpitassa saddh\u00e1cahagu\u00f1assa\nAthappak\u00e1sanatham athakath\u00e1 \u00e1dito casisatehi\nPa\u00f1cahi y\u00e1 sangit\u00e1 anusangit\u00e1 ca pacch\u00e1 pi,\nS\u00edhaladipam pana \u00e1bh\u00e1t\u00e1 'tha vasi\u00f1\u00e1 mah\u00e1mahindena,\nThap\u00edt\u00e1 S\u00edhalabhd\u00e1saya dipac\u00e1sinam ath\u00e1ya,\nApanetv\u00e1 tato 'ham Sth\u00e1jabh\u00e1d\u00e1m manoramanam bh\u00e1sam\nTantinay\u00e1nuccarikam \u00e1ropento, vigatadosam\nSamayam avilomento ther\u00e1nam theravamsapadip\u00e1nam\nSunipunainicchay\u00e1nam mah\u00e1vih\u00e1r\u00e1dh\u00eddasinam,\nHitv\u00e1 punappun\u00e1gatam atham, atham pak\u00e1sayiss\u00e1mi\nSujanassa ca tu\u1e6d\u1e6dhattham cirat\u1e6dhitattha\u00f1 ca dhamnassa.\n\n\"I make obeisance to Him whose heart is tempered with mercy, in whom the darkness of error is dispelled by the lamp of wisdom, the teacher of the world with its men and angels, the welcome Being who is released from the bonds of existence.\u00b9 I revere the spotless and perfect Truth, by contemplating which, beholding it face to face, the Enlightened attained to perfect knowledge. I bow my head before the holy Church, that congregation of eight orders of men, true sons of Buddha, who have trampled on the hosts of sin. While thus with a heart full of faith I render honour to the Three Jewels, if there be any merit in the deed, by the virtues thereof may all dangers be averted from my path.\n\nThe commentary intended to explain the meaning of the noble Long Collection, that scripture distinguished for its long discourses, subtle of meaning, praised by Buddha and his apostles, possessed of the qualities that sustain faith,\u2014the commentary, I say, upon this Scripture was at the first Council rehearsed by five hundred holy elders, and in later times rehearsed again and yet again.\u00b2 And it was carried by the saintly Mahendra to the island of Ceylon, and for the sake of the dwellers in that isle translated by him into the Sinhalese language. And now rejecting the Sinhalese tongue, adopting the graceful language that accords so well with the order of Scripture, not contradicting the faultless conclusions of the elders of the priesthood who dwell at the Great Monastery,\u00b3 who are bright lights in the apostolic succession, men of skilful and subtle judgment,\u2014for the edification of righteous men, and to the end that religion may\n\n\u00b9 Released from the five Gatis or states of existence, i.e., existence as a deva, as a man, as a preta, as an animal, or as one suffering in hell.\n\u00b2 Viz., at the 2nd and 3rd Councils.\n\u00b3 In Ceylon.\nlong endure, I proceed to expound the meaning of my text, omitting all unnecessary repetitions.\"\n\nWe find here a distinct statement that a commentary on that portion of the Buddhist Canon which contains the Brahmag\u0101la was rehearsed, and its text settled, at the First Council; so that, unless some explanation of the passage be found, we must suppose that Buddhaghosa, the Augustine of Buddhist divines, believed that a commentary on Buddha's sermons actually existed during Buddha's lifetime, and that its text was settled immediately after his death. After vainly endeavouring to solve the problem, I wrote to my friend Mr. J. F. Dickson, of the Ceylon Civil Service, and asked him whether he could obtain for me from any of his native friends a satisfactory, or at any rate a probable, explanation of the difficulty. After a long delay I received from Mr. Dickson, on the 15th of April, a paper on this subject by a Sinhalese native gentleman which seemed to me so able and scholar-like, that, although it was only intended for my perusal, I lost no time in obtaining permission to publish it in this Journal. A singular interest attaches to this essay from the circumstance that it is the work of a liberal Buddhist. I print it unaltered, only transliterating the P\u0101li citations.\n\nR. C. Childers.\n\nOn the Sumahgala Vit\u0101sini, and its allusions to an ancient \u0100\u1e6dhakath\u0101.\n\nIt must be admitted that the point raised by Mr. Childers is one of grave importance as affecting the credibility of Buddhaghosa and the authenticity of all the commentaries on the Tipitaka. From a missionary point of view, the astounding statement that a commentary on Buddha's discourses existed during his lifetime, and was rehearsed along with those discourses at the First Great Council, appears so improbable and unnatural as at once to justify one in discrediting the testimony; and I doubt not that missionary orientalists will hail the discovery as a valuable addition.\n\n1 Immediately after Buddha's death.\u2014R. C. C.\nin their stock of arguments against the genuineness and authenticity of the Buddhist Scriptures. Indeed I found it difficult at first to obtain the opinions of some of my learned friends of the Buddhist priesthood on this point, as they seemed to regard it as another thunderbolt intended to be hurled against their religion by some enthusiastic mission-\n\nI was only after explaining to them the object of the inquiry and the literary character of the gentleman who raised the apparent difficulty, that I could induce them to look me in the face.\n\nI am glad to say that most of my clerical Buddhist friends who have consulted on this subject agree with me in the sense of giving a wider and more extended signifi-\n\nThe word Atthakatha as used in the passage cited,\n\nThe word is a compound of two terms, meaning a statement, explanation, or\n\nThe literal meaning of\n\nThis wider sense of the\n\nI think the\n\nThe view given by Buddha-\n\nIn the famous Councils in the\n\nthis view\n\nIt must be\n\nin the sense that the\n\nwhich has been\n\neither in the\n\nafter his death. The\n\nare over-\n\nwe suppose that by the word\nAtthakath\u0101 in his preface Buddhaghosa only meant to convey the idea that at the various Councils held for the purpose of collocating the discourses and sayings of Buddha, the meanings to be attached to different terms\u2014chiefly those that appear to have been borrowed from the Hindu system of ascetic philosophy\u2014were discussed and properly defined, then the difficulty of conceiving the contemporaneous existence of the commentaries and the Pitakas would be entirely removed.\n\nThis view of the subject will appear still further borne out if we briefly glance over the history of the First Convocation, as narrated by Buddhaghosa himself. The first proposal to hold an assembly of priests for the purpose of collocating Buddha's discourses was made by Mah\u0101 Kassapa, the chief of the seven hundred thousand priests who assembled at Kusin\u0101ra to celebrate the obsequies of the departed saint. Seven days had hardly elapsed after that mournful occurrence, when signs of discontent at monastic restraint manifested themselves, and a disaffected disciple of Buddha named Subhadda openly proclaimed that now their master was no more the ties of discipline should be relaxed, if not broken. The words of consolation offered by this old monk to his brethren in distress are certainly remarkable, as it would be difficult to say whether they betoken more the callousness of his feelings or the depravity of his heart: \"Brethren, enough of this sorrow, weep not, lament not. We are well rid of that Arch-priest, having been in constant dread of his declarations, This befits you, this befits you not. Now, therefore, what we desire we shall do; what we do not desire that shall we not do.\" To a sagacious mind like that of Mah\u0101 Kassapa it was not difficult to perceive what language like this foreshadowed, and he instantly formed the resolve to congregate the priesthood, and to collect and arrange the laws and doctrines proclaimed by his Master. Hardly two months had elapsed before this active mind brought about\n\n---\n\n1 See note A.\n2 Alay devu na socittha mi paridevitha, upadduta ca homa \"idam vo kappati idam vo kappati,\" idini pana mayum yom icchissama tam karissima yom na icchissama tam na karissima.\u2014Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dika.\n3 See note B.\nwhat it had contemplated, and the result was the Council of the Five Hundred, convoked at R\u0101jagaha, under the auspices of King Aj\u0101tasattu, for the purpose of collecting and arranging the doctrines and discourses of Buddha.\n\nThe proceedings of this Council appear to have been conducted in a very orderly and systematic manner, which is the more surprising when we consider that monastic autocracy was about to give place to a form of church government prescribed by the great Founder himself, but which was now to be established and tested for the first time. Mah\u0101 Kassapa, whom Buddha indirectly indicated as his equal in point of superhuman mental acquirements, assumed the office of Moderator, and by the unanimous consent of the synod Up\u0101li was elected as the best qualified of their order to repeat the Vinaya, and \u0100nanda the Dhamma; the Council having previously decided that the Vinaya was the most material for the permanence of Buddhism. Now it is important to observe that the catechetical form was used in the collocation of both the Laws and Doctrines. \"Afterwards Mah\u0101 Kassapa, having seated himself in the presidential chair, questioned the venerable Up\u0101li respecting the Vinaya in this wise. Brother Up\u0101li, where was the first P\u0101r\u0101yika promulgated? My lord, at Ves\u0101l\u012b. On whose account? On account of Sudinna, the son of K\u0101landa. With regard to what offence? To fornication. Then did the venerable Mah\u0101 Kassapa question the venerable Up\u0101li on the offence, the cause, the offender, the primary law, the secondary law, the transgression and the non-transgression, relating to the first law enacted against mortal sin. And the venerable Up\u0101li explained as he was questioned.\" Such was also the method employed in the synod in the collocation of the Dhamma:\n\n1. \u0100ham bhikkhave yeva eka ak\u0101k\u0101dmi vivive \"evo k\u0101mehi-Pe-pathanam jh\u0101nam upasapajja viharanti Kassapo pi bhikkhave yeva eka ak\u0101k\u0101dhi-Pe-viharati.\u2014Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101.\n\n2.

Though it is subsequently added that \u201cat the conclusion of the questions and answers the five hundred Arhats repeated the texts together in the order in which they had been collocated,\u201d it is difficult to believe that all the five hundred rehearsed the long narratives prefixed to some of Buddha\u2019s discourses in the same words and style that they are now clothed in. Buddhaghosa\u2019s account of the synod is gathered from tradition, which was very probably embodied in the Sinhalese atthakath\u0101s, and there can be little doubt that the main facts are correct; but that he drew largely from tradition, written and oral, and possibly in some instances from imagination, will I think appear clear to any careful reader of the commentaries. Witness for instance his relation of \u0100nanda\u2019s mysterious entrance into the assembly: pathaviyam nimujjited attano d\u0101sane yeva attanam dassesi, ak\u0101sena gantv\u0101 nisiddhi pi eke, \u201cHe plunged into the earth and showed himself in his seat, and also some say he went through the air and sat down.\u201d He does not say which version is correct, but is quite satisfied with both accounts, and is evidently quite willing to let his readers choose whichever they like. Buddhaghosa throughout all his writings appears to have set one great object prominently in view, namely to inspire reverence for what he considered as supreme authority. When he came to Ceylon for the purpose of translating the Sinhalese commentaries, he found a great many extant at that time, and out of these commentaries, embracing no doubt various shades of opinion, and representing different schools of thought, he had to expunge, abridge, enlarge, and make a new commentary. Now how could he do all this, and at the same time preserve undiminished among future generations the same reverence and authority in which the older commentaries were held\n\n1 Pucchivissajjanapariyodne pa\u00f1ca arahantasatdmi suyagham doppitanayam eva g\u0101pasa\u00f1j\u0101yam ak\u0101niu.\n2 These are distinctly enumerated by him\u2014Mah\u0101-atthakath\u0101 d\u2019eva Mah\u0101paccavim eva ca Kurund\u0101 c\u0101ti tiso pi Sihal\u0101tthakath\u0101 ind.\u2014Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101.\n3 See note C.\nby the Buddhists of that age? The thought struck him, as no doubt it would strike any careful reader of the Buddhist Scriptures, that a large portion of the writings contained in that canon appear to be explanations and definitions of terms used by Buddha, and also that a great many discourses said to have been delivered by Buddha to certain individuals have not been recorded. Now what more easy to conceive, or what more probable, than that they formed the nucleus of matter for the formation of a commentary, and that at the First General Council, which lasted seven months, the elders, who had all seen and heard Buddha, should have discussed them, and decided on the method of interpreting and teaching the more recondite portions of Buddhist philosophy? and what therefore if he should say in somewhat exaggerated language, \"the commentary on the Digha Nik\u0101ya was at the beginning discussed (or composed, or merged into the body of the Scriptures) by five hundred holy elders\"?\u2014for the original words may admit of such a construction. Nor will this opinion appear merely hypothetical if we carefully peruse the account given by Buddhaghosa of the commentaries in his Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101. In his metrical introduction to that work, after the usual doxology, he explains the necessity of having a proper P\u0101li Commentary on the Vinaya, and then proceeds to set forth what he is about to do:\n\nSamvannanam ta\u00f1 ca sam\u0101rabhanto tassa mah\u0101-atthakatham sarivam\nKatv\u0101, mah\u0101paccariyam tath' era kurundin\u0101m\u0101disu vissut\u0101su\nVinicchayo atthakath\u0101su vutto yo yuttam attham apariccajanto,\nTato pi antogadhatherav\u0101dam, sanvannanam samm\u0101 sam\u0101rabhissam;\nTam me nis\u0101mentu pasannacitt\u0101 ther\u0101 ca bhikkh\u016b navamajjhim\u0101ca\nDhammapaddipassa tath\u0101gatassa sakkaassa dhammam patim\u0101nayanta.\nBuddhena dhammo vinayo ca vutto, yo tassa puttehi tath' eva \u0101tto,\nYo yehi tesam matim accajant\u0101 yasm\u0101 pure atthakath\u0101 ak\u0101psu\n\n1 See note D.\n2 Atthakatha adito va\u015bisatehi p\u0101cahi sa\u1e45g\u012bta.\nTasm\u0101 hi yam \u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101su vuttam tam, va\u1e6d\u1e6dayitv\u0101na pam\u0101-\ndalekham,\nSabbam pi sikkh\u0101su sagarav\u0101nam yasmat pam\u0101\u1e47am idha pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101-\nnam.\nTato ca bh\u0101santaram eva hita, vi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101ramagg\u0101 ca sam\u0101sayitv\u0101,\nVinicchayam sabbam asesayitv\u0101, tantikamam ka\u1e47ci avokkamitev\u0101,\nSuttantikamam vacaninam atham sutt\u0101nur\u016bpam paridipayanti\nYasmat ayam hessati va\u1e47\u1e47an\u0101 pi sakkacca tasma ca anusikkhitabb\u0101.\n\nThe translation is rather difficult, owing to the complexity\nand conciseness of the construction, but it may be rendered\nthus:\u2014\"In commencing this commentary, I shall, having\nembodied therein the Mah\u0101 \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101, without excluding\nany proper meaning from the decisions contained in the Mah\u0101\nPaccari, as also in the famous Kurundi and other com-\nmentaries, and including the opinions of the Elders,\u2014perform\nmy task well. Let the young, the middle-aged, and the\nelderly priests, who entertain a proper regard for the doctrines\nof the Tath\u0101gata, the luminary of truth, listen to my words\nwith pleasure. The Dhamma, as well as the Vinaya, was\ndeclared by Buddha, his (sacerdotal) sons understood it in the\nsame sense as it was delivered; and inasmuch as in former\ntimes they (the Sinhalese commentators) composed the com-\nmentaries without disregarding their (the sacerdotal sons') opinions,\ntherefore, barring any error of transcription, every-\nthing contained therein is an authority to the learned in this\npriesthood who respect ecclesiastical discipline. From these\n(Sinhalese) commentaries, after casting off the language,\ncondensing detailed accounts, including authoritative deci-\nsions, and without overstepping any P\u0101li idiom (I shall pro-\nceed to compose). And as this commentary will moreover\nbe explanatory of the meaning of words belonging to the\nSuttas in conformity with the sense attached to them therein,\ntherefore ought it the more diligently to be studied.\"\n\nNow, in this important passage, Buddhaghosa make men-\ntion of three distinct commentaries, and refers to others then\nin existence, besides naming another authority called Thera\nV\u0101da (the opinions of the Elders). The three commentaries\nenumerated are\u20141, Mah\u0101 \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101; 2, Mah\u0101 Paccari;\n3, Kurundi. Were these three commentaries separate works on the Vinaya, the Sutta, and the Abhidhamma respectively, or did they each embrace the whole of the Tipitaka? It is difficult to answer this question with positive certainty, but there are good reasons to incline to the latter opinion. The glossarists (authors of the Tikas) give but a very imperfect account of these works. However, it will be well to hear what they say of them:\u2014Mah\u00e1 atthakath\u00e1 n\u00e1ma pa\u00f1\u00f1amah\u00e1sangiti-\u00e1ruh\u00e1 mah\u00e1kaesapapamukhehi therehi kat\u00e1 mah\u00e1-mahindena \u00e1netr\u00e1 Sihalabh\u00e1s\u00e1ya kat\u00e1 mah\u00e1-atthakath\u00e1 ndma j\u00e1t\u00e1, \u201cMah\u00e1 Atthakath\u00e1 is evidently what was gathered in the first great Council. It was made by the elders, with Kassapa as their chief. Having been brought by Mah\u00e1 Mahinda, and converted into the Sinhalese language, it was called Mah\u00e1 Atthakath\u00e1.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that this is the same commentary (atthakath\u00e1) referred to by Buddhaghosa in his Sumangala Vil\u00e1sini. Mah\u00e1paccari n\u00e1ma Sihalabh\u00e1s\u00e1ya ulumpam kira atthi tasmim nisidit\u00e1 katatt\u00e1 mah\u00e1paccari n\u00e1ma j\u00e1t\u00e1, \u201cIt is said that there was a raft called in the Sinhalese language Mah\u00e1 Paccari; as this work was composed on that raft, it was called Mah\u00e1 Paccari.\u201d Kurundattjakath\u00e1 n\u00e1ma Kurundavelith\u00e1ro n\u00e1ma athi tasmim nisidit\u00e1 katatt\u00e1 kurundi n\u00e1ma j\u00e1t\u00e1, \u201cThere is a vih\u00e1ra called Kurundavelu; as the work was composed there, it was called Kurundi.\u201d In their remarks on the word \u00e1di in this verse, the authors of the S\u00e1rattha D\u00edpan\u00ed and the Vimati Vinodani Tikas enumerate two works called Andhakaatthakath\u00e1 and Sa\u0144khepatthakath\u00e1, but the Vajira Buddhi Tik\u00e1 gives Cullapaccari and Andhakaatthakath\u00e1.\n\nThus it will be seen that the information furnished to us by the glossarists respecting these lost works is very meagre, and leads one to suspect that at their time almost all traces of them had disappeared, although in the P\u00e1li Muttaka (a work written by one of these glossarists) reference is made to all the three commentaries. Mention is also made of the Mah\u00e1 Atthakath\u00e1 and another commentary called M\u00falatthakath\u00e1 at the end of the Digha and Majjhima\n\n1 See Preface to Minayeff's P\u00e1timokkha, pages vii and viii, notes 9, 10, 11, 12.\u2014B.C.C.\nNik\u0101yas. In the Sammoha Vinodan\u012b (commentary on the Vibha\u1e45ga), Buddhaghosa states that he composed that work \"by taking the substance of the old commentaries.\" It appears pretty clear therefore that all the Sinhalese commentaries enumerated by Buddhaghosa were each separate works on the entire body of the Tipi\u1e6daka. Those comments were probably more or less directed to the elucidation of one or more of the Pitakas, but that each of them purported to be a separate and independent commentary on the entire Tipitaka I think there can be little room to doubt.\n\nIn his introduction to the Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101, Buddhaghosa uses the following words: \"The Dhamma as well as the Vinaya was declared by Buddha, his sacerdotal sons understood it in the same sense as it was delivered; and, inasmuch as in former times they (i.e. the Sinhalese commentators) made the commentaries without rejecting their (i.e. Buddha's immediate disciples') opinions, therefore, etc.\" This passage will, I think, explain the sense in which he uses the word Atthakath\u0101 in his preface to the Suma\u1e45gala Vil\u0101sin\u012b. For two things are clearly deducible from the passage, viz., that when Buddhaghosa speaks of the Atthakath\u0101 that existed in the earliest days of Buddhism, and almost contemporaneously with Buddha, he only refers to the method of explaining and interpreting the Buddhist Scriptures adopted by Buddha's immediate disciples, and also that Mahinda was not the sole composer of the commentaries, but that there were others who, either jointly with Mahinda or separately, composed comments on the Sacred Canon. One of the glossarists in expounding this passage takes a very sensible view of the matter. His words are:\u2014Buddhena dhammo vinayo ca vutto ti p\u0101lito ca aththato ca buddhena bhagavat\u0101 vutto, na hi bhagavat\u0101 ary\u0101kata\u1e47\u0101 tantipadam athhi, sabbesam yeva aththo kathit\u014d, tasma sammadambuddhen' eva tinno pitak\u0101nam aththavanpan\u0101kam\u0101 pi bh\u0101sito ti datthabbam, tattha tattha bhagavat\u0101 pavattit\u0101 pakinnakadesan\u0101 yeva hi atthakath\u0101, \"The Dhamma as well as the Vinaya was declared by Buddha; that is, it was declared\n\n1 M\u016blatthakath\u0101s\u0101ram addya, etc.\n2 Pota\u1e47\u1e47atthakath\u0101dy\u0101n edram addya.\n3 See note E.\nby the blessed Buddha in words as in sense, for there is not one scriptural term which has not been defined by the Blessed One: the sense of all words has been truly expounded. Therefore it should be borne in mind that it is by the all-perfect Buddha himself that even the method of interpreting the three Pitakas has been propounded. In fact, the desultory discourses made by the Blessed One here and there, are what is meant by the word Atthakath\u0101.\" My view of this subject therefore receives additional weight from the exposition given of Buddhaghosa's meaning by his glossarist.\n\nNor will this view receive less support from collateral facts connected with the life and ministry of the \"Great Sage,\" who gave to the world a creed that has stood the test of time and the progress of the human intellect during upwards of twenty-four centuries. He renounced the world and all its pleasures in the vigour of life, being then in his twenty-ninth year, passed his days for six long years in a wilderness, subjecting his delicate frame to a severe course of mortification and penance, and at length, receiving the light of that philosophy by which he thought himself capable of explaining all the mysteries of nature, he entered upon a career of religious reformation which lasted for forty-five years. During this long period of uninterrupted labour, he not only preached and argued and conversed and travelled, but also legislated, and gave to his disciples a code of monastic discipline surpassed by no other system of monachism either in the East or West. Can it be imagined then that the Tipitaka contains all the words of Buddha? Undoubtedly not. To the followers of that faith it may contain \"all that is necessary to salvation,\" but it assuredly does not record all and everything done and spoken by this almost superhuman intellect. If John could say of the pious Nazarene of Jud\u00e6a that if all the things he had done should be written every one, the world itself could not contain the books, what length of hyperbole must be used in reference to the doings and sayings of the great philosopher and teacher of India, whose term of unremitting labour so greatly exceeded that of Jesus of Nazareth?\nIt is a hopeless task, as Mr. Childers says, to inquire into what has become of the old Sinhalese commentaries. No trace of them now exists. The early diffusion of the P\u0101li language among the priesthood and learned laity, and the subsequent introduction of Sanskrit literature and Sanskrit verbiage into the once pure Elu,\\(^1\\) must have so choked that language that it died out early, and its memory was cherished only by the lovers of Parnassus. For all philosophic and religious purposes the P\u0101li and the Sanskritized Sinhalese began to be used from a very early period, and continue to be used to the present day.\n\nL. Comrilla Vijasinha.\n\nRatnapura, Feb. 21, 1871.\n\nNOTES.\n\n(By the Author.)\n\nNote A.\u2014It is my opinion, although contrary to that of orthodox Buddhists, that the Buddhistic philosophy, in so far as regards its asceticism and self-purification, is derived from the Hindu system of Patanjali. I think a perusal of the Patanjali Yoga and its Commentary by Bh\u014dja R\u0101ja will instinctively lead one to this conclusion, taking for granted, as it undoubtedly appears, that the Patanjali Yoga S\u016btra was anterior to the Buddhistic era. It is quite clear that Buddha's first ascetic teachers, \u0100\u1e37\u0101ra K\u0101l\u0101ma and Uddakar\u0101ma Putta, were followers of this system.\n\nNote B.\u2014It is evident from Buddhaghosa's narrative of the convocations that the Council of the Five Hundred (pa\u00f1casa\u00f1\u00f1ikasangiti) assembled within two months from the date of Buddha's death. The proposal by Mah\u0101 Kassapa to his brethren to go to R\u0101jagaha for the purpose was made fourteen days after Buddha's death:\n\nAtho tath\u0101gatassa parinibb\u0101nato sattasu s\u0101dhuk\u0101janadiasesu sattasu d\u0101tupuj\u0101d\u012bvasesu v\u012bvacattesu addham\u0101so atikkanto. After coming to R\u0101jagaha the Theras were occupied during the first month in causing repairs to be made to the monasteries already abandoned by the priests, and afterwards informed the king Aj\u0101tasattu that their work was over, and requested him to furnish a hall of assembly (sannisajjatth\u0101nam):\u2014Ther\u0101 pathamam\u0101s\u0101m sabbavih\u0101ra-patisankharanam k\u0101r\u0101petv\u0101 ra\u00f1\u00f1o droceum.

No great ability was required for this purpose, much less extraordinary talents. In his introduction to the Vinaya \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101, he tells us briefly what he undertook to perform, \"to translate, abridge, collate, systematize, etc.,\" in fact, to make a P\u0101li variorum edition of the Sinhalese commentaries. No wonder that the learned Sinhalese priests of that period thought it prudent to test beforehand his latent talents by giving him a text from the sacred canon as a subject for a thesis. The result of this test was, as we know, the Visuddhi Magga, embodying the entire system of Buddhism.\n\nNote D.\u2014Ekamantam nisinmassa kho Yasassa kuloputtase Bhagav\u0101 anupubbikatham kathesi, sevyathidam d\u0101nakatham silakatham sagga-katham, k\u0101madnam d\u012bnavam okram sa\u1e45kileam nekkhamme anisameam pak\u0101sehi: yadda Bhagav\u0101 a\u00f1\u00f1\u0101si Yasam kulopittam kallacittam mudu-cittam vintaranacittam udaggacittam pasannacittam atha y\u0101 buddhanam \u015bimukk\u0101seik\u0101 dharmade\u015b\u0101d tam pak\u0101sehi, dukkham samudayam nirodham maggam, \"Then the Blessed One related to the gentle Yasa, who sat by his side, an orderly series of narratives, viz.: regarding charity, restraint, and heavenly pleasures; he discoursed on the evil, the vanity, the pollution of sensual pleasures, and the blessing of self-abnegation.

During this long interval a goodly number of works on the tenets of Buddhism must have been composed. Perhaps the frequent allusions to the Mah\u0101 \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101 and M\u016blat\u0101\u1e6dhakath\u0101, the \"great commentary\" and the \"original commentary,\" refer to Mahinda's original work, and the Paccari, Kurundi, etc., refer to subsequent compilations.\nART. XV.\u2014The Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, of Arragon.\n\nBy the Right Hon. Lord Stanley of Alderley.\n\n(Continued from p. 140.)\n\nThe portion of Rabadan's poem given in the present part of the Journal relates the history of Shaibeh or Abdulmutalib, the son of Heshim, and of his son Abdullah, the father of the Prophet. It contains a narrative of the offering up of Abdullah in sacrifice by his father, with regard to which see the following observations of Sir Wm. Muir, vol. i., p. cclix. That writer believes the story, because, as he says, \"the simple desire to establish an analogy (between it and Abraham's intended sacrifice), had there been no facts to found the story on, would have led to a very different fiction; for Abraham was commanded to offer up his son, and the Mussulmans believe he acted piously in obeying; whereas they hold Abdulmutalib, who was borne out by no such divine order, to have been wrong both in the vow and in his attempt to fulfil it.\" These observations are supported by this poem, for Rabadan does not appear to draw any analogy between the sacrifice by Abraham and that by Abdulmutalib, whereas by using similar expressions he seems very clearly to intend to point out the analogy between the Deluge and the end of the world. The opinion which Sir W. Muir describes as the prevailing one with respect to Abdulmutalib's act is here spoken by the sage Ykrama. It was with reference to the incident related in this poem that Muhammad spoke of himself as \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0630\u0650\u064a \u064a\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0631\u064f, or as the son of the two offered up in sacrifice; this is not considered by some as necessarily implying that Ishmael and not Isaac was the son offered up by Abraham, since Isaac might, according\nto Arab custom, be spoken of as an ancestor equally with Ishmael. Though it is not expressly stated that Ishmael and not Isaac was offered up in sacrifice, the majority of Mussulman writers believe that it was Ishmael, and consider this view as borne out by the words of Genesis xxii. 2, \"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac.\"\n\nThe latter portion of this part of the poem describes the marriage of Abdullah with Eminah, and his death.\n\nI hope that in the next part of the Journal the publication of Rabadan's poem may be concluded: it will contain the life of Muhammad, and two short poems, one of which is wanting in the Paris MS.\nISTORIA DE

Maca\nY en todas las demas tierras\nTenido el hombre sin hijos\nPor hombre de baxas prendas;\nY es cierto que si otra cosa\nSu contrario conociera\nQue mas afrenta le hacian,\nOtra peor le dixera;\nPor que en tales ocasiones\nSuele la colera ciega\nProvocar palabras tales\nQue, \u00e1 quien las dice, afrenta;\nY \u00e1 un hombre de tanta estima,\nComo Abdulmut\u00e1lib era,\nFu\u00e9

la ocasion primera,\nPor do despues le obligase\nA satisfacion tan fiera;\nPero fu\u00e9 mucho arrojarse,\nDerog\u00f3 su gran prudencia;\nQue fu\u00e9 temeraria cosa\nEl ofrecer vida agena,\nCosa incierta de cumplir;\nY en caso que la cumpliera,\n\u00c1 todos sus descendientes\nDaba ejemplo de crueza.\nEjemplo que tanto obliga\nA dar ejemplarias muestras\n\u00c1 los que para dechado\nLos puso

XVI.\u2014Proverbia Communia Syriaca. By Captain R. F. Burton.\n\n\"The genius, spirit, and wit of a nation are discovered in its proverbs.\"\u2014Bacon.\n\nA writer remarks, \"If men at the lowest as well as the highest stage of civilization enunciate the same truths, the fact goes to prove that these truths are unimportant.\" I can hardly assent to the conclusion, even were the premise correct, whereas it is not. Those familiar with proverbial literature have remarked that some aphorisms are common in matter, and a few even in actual manner and form, to almost all nations and languages. The Syrian, for instance, will say, \"The egg of to-day, not the hen of to-morrow;\" and \"A live dog is better than a dead lion.\" On the other hand, the points of difference are far more important. Setting aside the sayings which \"bear the stamp of their birthplaces, and which wear the colouring and the imagery of their native climes,\" we find that there are proverbs peculiar to every race\u2014proper to it, as are its syntax and its idiom; that each people speaks out the truth or the half-truth which is in it, and, consequently, that for the most part neither the idea nor the wording bear comparison. Moreover, were it a fact that all enunciate the same truth, it by no means proves the latter to be unimportant, except to the few. The student of the nineteenth century will not, for higher thought, consult proverbs or proverbial philosophy, or other saws and instances; but he will treat not a few of them as chapters of anthropological and ethnological history; showing how truth arose in the silent education of the world; how the experience of every-day life gradually took shape and status; how the appreciation of experience became concrete in the pithy\naphorism, till at last the \"wisdom of many\" gained life by the \"wit of one.\" In it he sees the process of a pencil of light stealing into the child-like savage brain, slowly but surely dispersing the fatal glooms of ignorance and prejudice, of falsehood and barbarism; assuming various degrees of illumination, and at last becoming the perfect day of wisdom and judgment, of truth and civilization. No wonder, as Count Lucan observes, that proverbs have ever been so popular with the human race.\n\nAs regards these Proverbia Communia. The labours of Poeck, Erpenius, Freytag, and others, have introduced to Europe the repertories of classical Ams\u00e1l (\u0623\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644), in which the Arabs delighted from the days of the Khalifah Ali to those of El Maydani. My object is not so high. Returning to Western Asia, and resuming the studies which had been interrupted by long service in Africa and South America, I at once recommenced them at the commencement\u2014the colloquialisms of a people new to me. Presently I remembered Burekhardt's Amsal el Masr (Arabic and English, 1830), which aimed at illustrating manners and customs from proverbial sayings current at Cairo, and it appeared to me that the same might be done for Syria.\n\nThe modern dialect of Syria retains distinct traces of the old Aramaean, and, as may be expected in a land where men live much at home, every great city\u2014Damascus, for instance\u2014preserves peculiar words and phrases. And without living interpretation it is impossible to master sayings of purely local use and unfamiliar allusion, further mystified by proverbial sententiousness and conciseness. They must, however, be learnt, and even committed to memory, before a stranger can feel himself at home with the people. Here proverbs have not passed from the learned to the vulgar tongues; they are in universal circulation, amongst all degrees, from the ignorant to the man of highest cultivation; and the apposite use of aphorisms is, like wit and eloquence, a manner of power. Some of the sayings are mostly confined to women, and the\n\n1 His \"Amsal el Arab,\" in four vols. octavo, is an excerpt from the vast collection of El Maydani.\nnursery; not a few of them have some popular tale whose point they resume. Many are quoted only in part, the rest being suppressed for some obvious reason. So we, for instance, might say \"facil per alium.\" As will be seen, the peculiar vagueness inherent in Arabic speech allows them an immense range of application, and permits them to be used in a variety of senses, which require from us a certain amount of study. Nor is the labour of studying them for their own sake in vain. It is highly interesting to observe the modern succedaneum for the old aphoristic philosophy of Syria, which in some form or other has overspread the civilized world.\n\nOf all the races known to me, the Syrians and certain West African tribes are those who delight most in proverbs. The Spanish type, immortalized in Sancho Pan\u00e7a comes next; the Portuguese loses much of the characteristic; and the Brazilian, his descendant, has wholly lost it. When visiting Goruba I was so much struck by the speeches and harangues\u2014mere conglomerates of quotations\u2014that I persuaded Messrs. Tinsley to publish, in 1865, a collection of 2859 proverbs, popular amongst seven Negroid and Negro nations. The volume, which bore the title of \"Wit and Wisdom from West Africa,\" was not so successful as the Adagia of Erasmus, and of course brought out the remark that the \"sparkles of wit were few and faint, and the wisdom of the mildest order.\" This was to be expected. But my object was to make the people describe themselves, to put them, as it were, in the witness-box upon their racial trial. Pace the critics who differed from me, I cannot but think that the idea of the compilation was good. At any rate, it obtained the approval of one whose opinion in such a matter is worth a thousand cavils of men, who, ignorant of the subject, must borrow from the book itself the arms with which they would assail it. I need hardly mention the name of Mr. William Stirling, now Sir William Stirling Maxwell, of Keir.\n\nThis little repertory of proverbs, which I hope soon to supplement with others, was supplied to me by Mr. Hanna Mish, honorary dragoman of H.B.M.'s Consulate, Damascus.\n1. \"She who hath her husband with her, shall turn the moon with her finger.\"\n\n2. \"Bring girls, and sit not to no purpose.\"\u2014It is better (for a woman) to bear girls (if she cannot have boys), and not to remain childless.\n\n3. \"Girl upon girl, and not retaining (barren) for a year.\"\u2014Meaning the same as No. 2.\n\n4. \"My lady without (the) queasiness (of pregnancy) is unwell?\"\u2014Said of a woman who affects to be an invalid; to be delicate, to be interesting.\n\n5. \"Love and pregnancy, and riding upon a camel, cannot be hid.\"\u2014Similar to the Persian \"Musk and murder cannot be concealed.\"\n\n6. \"However much the brown woman works, it will not pay for her eye-paint and rouge.\"\u2014Applied to men and women who spend more than they make. So the Turkish proverb, Fantasia chok, parah yok.\n\n7. \"Go the round way, though (it be) long, and marry the daughter of a house (i.e. good family), though she be stale (or has lain fallow, from \u064a\u0648\u0631)\n\n8. \"The scald-headed woman prides herself on the hair of her (maternal) aunt's daughter.\"\u2014Said about a small or a bad man who boasts the greatness or the goodness of his relatives.\n\"The ass prides himself upon the horse being his (maternal) uncle.\"\u2014Meaning the same as No. 8.\n\n\"Like the Jew who (ever) chooses the meanest work.\"\u2014Said of one who neglects important for trivial matters.\n\n\"Like Jew beggars, who enjoy neither this world nor the next.\"\u2014Said of a man who fails in life. So they also say *Miel el Fawakhireh* (plur. of *Fakh\u00fari*, a jar-maker) *wa la duniy\u00e1 wa la \u00e1khireh*. The jar-maker is proverbially a rascal, and his calling is a poor one. The first three words are generally found sufficient; and to make it more offensive to the Jews, Moalems say, *Miel el yahid*.\n\n\"Be wroth, O aunt! (here means a stepmother) for all thy curses are in vain.\"\u2014Said to any one who curses or uses bad language. *Fi\u0161fi\u0161* means literally \"vapid wine.\"\n\n\"A thousand curses never tore a shirt.\"\u2014So our adage, \"Hard words break no bones.\"\n\n\"The mouse is not pure, nor is her prayer answered (by heaven).\"\u2014Said to a bad man who curses.\n\n\"Turn the jar mouth downwards: the daughter will turn out like the mother.\"\u2014The first half is merely for the purpose of rhyme. *Li ummih\u00e1* is also said, instead of *Miel ummih\u00e1*.\n\n\"Girl, who raised thee (so high)? Thine honour (i.e. husband) and the house of thy mother-in-law.\" (*Bayt Hamd*, the husband's family; *Hamu*, father-in-law; and *Ham\u00e1*, mother-in-law.)\n17. \"Let a man wear) foul rags, but not show (a naked) skin.\"\u2014Said, for instance, to woman. Meaning that though poor she may be honest.\n\n18. \"Girl! don't exult in thy wedding dress. Ah! how much trouble is behind it.\"\u2014Said to a man enjoying himself without thought of the future.\n\n19. \"Go not amongst the tombs; nor smell evil odours.\"\u2014Said to one, for instance, who wishes to meddle in troubles which do not concern him.\n\n20. \"Say not to the singer, sing, nor to those praying, pray.\"\u2014Meaning, it is useless to ask a man to do what he is compelled to do; he will only make excuses, and perhaps refuse.\n\n21. \"Instead of saying to the hen Kish (pst! be off), strike her and break her leg.\"\u2014Spoken by one asking a favour from another; and when the latter, who can grant it, makes excuses and puts him off.\n\n22. \"Befriend the cock, and see where he bears you.\" Evil communications corrupt good manners. (Sh\u016bf for sh\u016bf: others say \u064a\u0648\u0645 the owl.)\n\n23. \"Every goat is stuck to her circle.\"\u2014Said after giving good advice to a man who will not take it.\n\n24. (Or, Kull ad dur\u016bb ala 't 'Tahun.) \"All the roads lead to the mill.\"\u2014Spoken to a man who tries roundabout ways, when he can go straight to the point.\n\"There is no rising up without a falling down in front of it.\"\u2014Meaning, that any man will have his turn of good and bad fortune.\n\n\"The tiyak (Mithridate) will not come from Irak (where it is made) till the man bitten by the snakes is released (by death).\"\u2014Said by a man whose important business is deferred. Others say, *Malsu' el haw\u00e1*, i.e. the victim of love.\n\n\"According to the size of your carpet stretch your legs.\"\u2014The same as our \"Cut your coat according to your cloth.\"\n\n\"Like a cobbler's scissors, which cut nothing but the impure (leather).\"\u2014Spoken of a foul-mouthed man. Often the first half of this proverb is found enough.\n\n\"Every dog is better than Haym\u00far (proper name of dog, generally pronounced Hamm\u00far).\"\u2014The speaker is supposed to declare his dog worse than all others. Said by a man who complains of his wife, children, friends, and so forth.\n\n\"Like dogs, full or empty (it is all the same).\"\u2014Benevolently said of a poor man, or of one who wants everything.\n\n\"Gifts to the convent and filth (polite people prefer *El bal\u00e1d*, toil and trouble) for Samaan (proper name of the convent servant).\"\u2014Said of a servant or a slave working for his master.\n\n\"All the cocks crow, but honour is given to the crested cock (*Abu kumburah*, a bird with feathered tuft, and there-\nfore more remarkable).\u201d\u2014Spoken of a man who carries off honours or profit from those more deserving.\n\n33. \u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0635\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0646\n\u201cEverything is soap to the Arab.\u201d\u2014Meaning, all is fish that comes to his net.\n\n34. \u062d\u062a\u0627 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0623 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0634 \u0623\u0644\u0641 \u0648\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062c\u0627\u0648\u0632\u0647\u0627\n\u201cHann\u00e1, son of Mann\u00e1, who lived a thousand one hundred years, and never enjoyed himself.\u201d\u2014Said to one complaining of a little misery. The Spanish Ommiad Khalifet el Nasr, \u201cthe heir of prosperity,\u201d was more easily contented; he owned to the happy days in a reign of fifty years and seven months.\n\n35. \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u0644\u062a \u062d\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0647\u064a\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0647\n\u201cWhen the Hauran (plain) fails, Hijaneh (the swampy region east of Damascus) supplies (provision).\u201d\u2014Popularly said in praise of Hijaneh.\n\n36. \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0632 \u0637\u064a\u0632 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0644\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\n\u201cMy rump is my rump, and the land is the Sult\u00e1n's.\u201d\u2014Spoken by a man, for instance, when another would turn him out of his place or property.\n\n37. \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u062e\u0631\u062c \u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0644\n\u201cThe tassel of a saddle-bag, which cannot straighten nor incline (the saddle).\u201d\u2014Applied to a ne'er-do-weel, a useless fellow, a man of no consequence.\n\n38. \u0631\u063a\u064a\u0641 \u0628\u0631\u063a\u064a\u0641 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0628\u0627\u062a \u062c\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u062c\u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646\n\u201cA loaf for a loaf (i.e. lend him a loaf), and let not thy neighbour remain hungry (for he will return thy loan).\u201d\u2014Meaning, assist thy brother man, and he will assist thee.\n\n39. \u062e\u0628\u0632\u0643\u0645 \u0627\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0628\u0632\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0628\u063a\u064a\u0641\n\u201cIf your bread be greater than our bread, shame us with a loaf!\u201d\u2014Said to one from whom a favour is wanted, and who boasts that he can do it.\n\u201cYour neighbour who is near, and not your brother who is far.\u201d\u2014Meaning, your neighbour who does you good is better than a brother who does not.

A kind of Vicar of Bray. Said of one from whom you cannot escape.\nART. XVII.\u2014Notes on an Ancient Indian Vase, with an Account of the Engraving thereupon. By Charles Horne, F.R.A.S., late of the Bengal Civil Service.\n\nThis curious and, I believe, unique relic of antiquity is in the form of an ordinary Indian lotah, and measures as follows: Total height, 6\u00bd in.; diameter, 5\u00bd in.; ditto at neck, 2 in.; with a projecting circular lip of \u00bd in. It is apparently wrought in some fine alloy of brass, copper, and spelter (?), the brass prevailing, and has resisted corrosion in a very remarkable manner; for the date which I would, from external evidence, assign it is between 200 and 300 A.D. It has evidently been treated with the greatest care; for we do not find upon it any signs of the constant polishing with sand and ashes which the lotahs of the natives undergo when in constant use, and which in a few years wears them quite thin.\n\nBefore I enter upon any description of the engraving upon it, I may as well mention how and where it was found. In 1857 Major Hay, then in Political employ in the K\u00fbl\u00fb country, which comprises the districts of Lahoul and Spit\u00ee, in the Him\u00e2leh, happening to be near Goondlah, heard that some curious ancient vessels had been found near the junction of the Chandra and Bhag\u00eer rivers not far distant. It would appear that upon the spot had formerly stood a Buddhist monastery, and that owing to a great landslip a vaulted chamber or hollow had been laid bare, in which were found this brass vase, and some dishes of kassa, or mixed metal. There were some, doubtless, of the more precious metals, but these had disappeared before Major Hay could reach the spot. He was, however, fortunate in being able to secure the object now under notice, which he has kindly placed in my hands for description, and that, if possible, it might find a resting-place in some museum.\n\nThe whole of the exterior, with the exception of a part of\nthe neck, is covered with engraving, effected with a graving tool or fine chisel. The upper part is occupied with six spaces of geometrical ornament running around it, consisting of crossings, lines, circles, and the like. This may take one-third of the space, whilst the lower two-thirds are filled with a spirited representation of a royal progress.\n\nWe have first a young prince in a chariot or car drawn by four horses abreast, attended by his chowrie-bearer (a female) and his charioteer. The style of the chariot and the drawing of the steeds, perspectively, is most decidedly Greek; whilst the harness of the latter is very peculiar, and I have not been able in any work to meet with similar headstalls or bridles. In the sculptures from Amravati there are many harnessed horses, but all their headstalls are square in character; as are those from the Nineveh sculptures. The passing of the reins through a \"terret\" or ring on the withers of the horse exactly resembles the manner of the Romans, as well shown in a plate in Hope's \"Costumes of the Ancients,\" as does the breastband before alluded to. In the Nimroud sculptures the horses' heads when abreast only just project before one another; but here we have nearly half the shoulder visible. There is no slavish conventionalism, and the horses of the mounted men are each in a separate attitude\u2014the one prancing with arched neck, whilst the other is trotting very high. In no case have they any martingale, although almost every horse at Sanchi is shown as having one. The breastbands are set with large studs, probably bosses of metal; whilst the crupper strap is also shown to be ornamented. A large tassel hangs from the shoulder at the junction of the ornamented girth and the breastband. The manes appear to be plaited, and the tails of the chariot horses tied up; whilst those of the steeds of the horsemen are flowing free, being combed out.\n\nWhilst on the subject of the horses, I would draw attention to the representation of colour, both of the riders' horses being fleabitten or grey, whilst those in the chariot appear to be pure white. On the head of one is manifestly a grand plume of feathers, and on the other a strange kind of ornament, with backward flowing streamers, surmounted by,\nperhaps, the tied-up top-knot. The horses all appear to be stallions. But the most curious point is the introduction of stirrups. These are either of rope or of bamboo, but most probably of the latter, from the stiffness with which they stand out.\n\nEven in so small a matter as this is the skill of the artist shown; for in the prancing horse the foot pressing heavily bends the stirrup to its shape, whilst in the case of the trotting one the foot lightly placed does not spoil the curve of the bamboo or rope.\n\nThe saddle-cloths do not cover any saddle, and are, doubtless, ornamented pads, which are even now much used in the East. No girths are shown in the drawing. In the Sanchi representation, all the horses are saddled, although nowhere are stirrups to be found. The Greeks and Romans, as far as my knowledge extends, did not use them, for I have never seen them figured; although, perhaps, on the same principle that the nude was preferred to the highly-clad figure for representations, the horses were drawn as far as possible without trappings, as in the Elgin marbles.\n\nThe action of the animals is well represented when we consider the rough tool with which the incising has been effected. They have a large tassel hanging at the ear, and a species of horned erection of, perhaps, plumes on the forehead or top-knot, as has been used for State by all nations in all ages. Each is driven with two reins, four being held in one hand by the driver, and four in the other. The chariot is of a rather uncommon form, very large, and has none of the angularity so general in those of Greece and Rome. From the marking it almost looks as though the upper portion was made of basket-work. The front is ornamented by perpendicular lines of work, probably of wood; and there is a hand-rail upon which the young prince is leaning. It, however, much resembles in its general form one represented in Plate xxxiv. of Tree and Serpent Worship, from the bas-reliefs at Sanchi; and still more so one spoken of as the only one at Amravati, and figured in Plate lxxvi. of the same work. This, however, has only two horses.\nThere is no connexion between the reins and the mouths of the horses, but the arrangement represented would seem to imply some species of bit. These were, doubtless, in use at the time to which I would assign the work, long after the time of Arrian, whose remarks are quoted by Mr. Fergusson.\n\nOver the prince, held in the left hand by his chowrie-bearer, is a very large umbrella of bamboo, neatly made, presenting no peculiarity, but very much resembling those now in use in most parts of the East. He wears no clothing above the waist, except a light scarf thrown over the shoulders, whilst the lower part of his body is covered with a dhoti, or waistcloth, as far as can be seen; neither has he any ornaments on his arms or wrists. Around his neck is a mala, or necklace, made of gems, probably of amber or turquoise, of the shape of truncated cones strung transversely through the thick end, and he would appear to have had his ears lengthened and split, as in the order of his kamphati, or, perhaps, caused to present that appearance, in consequence of the former wearing of heavy earrings, now abandoned, as we so often see in figures of Sakya Muni. Some may, however, hold that the elongation represents rings worn in the ear. I, however, think that they do not. He appears to have no head-dress, but merely his long locks twisted up into masses around his head in a neat manner.\n\nAt his left hand stands his charioteer, a character often alluded to in the four predictive signs shown to Sakya before he finally left the Palace at Kapila. This person, whether male or female, for there is little to distinguish the sex, and the dress and ornament rather seem to indicate a woman, may possibly be his wife Yasodav\u0101. He (or she) appears to be speaking to the Prince, who looks sad and thoughtful. He wears heavy bangles, a necklace much resembling that of the master, and immense lobes or earrings almost reaching to the shoulder. Besides this, he has a fine gold chain, similar in character to that worn by the musicians, which rather favours the presumption of the charioteer being a female. A grand Turkish turban crowns his head, such as Bishop Bigandet speaks of as being worn by men at the time of\nSakya in his Life of Gautama. As before stated, four reins are held in each hand, and the right also carries a long stiff whip without any lash.\n\nBehind the Prince stands a female attendant, with the large umbrella supported with her left hand, whilst the right grasps a *choorie*, or fly whisk of hair. She wears the same prodigious lobe or ear ornaments as the charioteer, with similar bangles on her wrists. Her hair is most elaborately done up in two horns, with a streamer coming through the midst of each erection, and hanging down far below the waist, whilst many (five are shown) others float on the breeze from the back of the head. Her body is bare to the waist, as was common at the date to which I would attribute this vase; whilst below, a *sari*, or petticoat, tightly girt round the hips, flows freely by reason of the rapid motion of the vehicle.\n\nThe whole forms a very complete and carefully drawn group, and tells its story quite graphically.\n\nIt might well represent Phralong when he saw the first of the four \"signs\" as he drove to his gardens in state, with his four beautiful white horses, accompanied by guards and musicians.\n\nImmediately behind the car rides a horseman wearing no ornament whatever. He has long slit ears, with his hair curiously twisted up about his head, and a light scarf over his shoulders, the ends of which stream behind him. Below this is a *dhoti*, or waistcloth, which completes his clothing.\n\nIn his right hand he carries a very curious highly-finished weapon, somewhat resembling a halberd, consisting of a long staff tipped with a spear-head. A little below the head on one side is a sharp projecting recurved instrument like a rein-cutter; and on the opposite side, still lower down, is an axe-head. I have in my researches found one or two representations of a spear with an axe on one side of the staff, but never one with this strange hook, which cannot possibly be used as an *ankus*, or elephant goad, the staff being too long. There are some celebrated tridents, one in Gurwhal, 21 feet high, which has the axe-head on one side; and another at\nGopeswara, 16 feet high, with a similar appendage,\\(^1\\) which slightly reminds one of the Roman *fasces* carried by the Lictors; and upon a Bactrian (?) coin, shown me by Mr. E. Thomas, we found a weapon possibly similar, but very indistinct. The handle is neatly finished off at the bottom, and the weapon would seem to be one of the State insignia.\n\nThe second horseman has rings in his ears of a moderate size, and a scarf of another pattern, wearing only a *dhoti* in addition by way of clothing. His head is, however, covered by a handsome turban, unless, indeed, his hair is so neatly done up as exactly to resemble one, which I much doubt. He is closely followed by another Prince, or noble person, mounted on an elephant, which steps nimbly along. A male attendant sits behind him on the pad or *guddi*, for there is no howdah, the elephant being very small, holding an umbrella over him of exactly the same character as that used by the principal person, with his left hand, whilst in his right hand he grasps a *chowrie*, or fly whisk, with which he fans his master. As it is, he sits in a most uncomfortable position, and it is not clear how he balances himself.\n\nThe driver of the elephant, evidently some great man, has elongated slit ears, without earrings, like the Prince, one of the horsemen, and another attendant not yet described; and the same wild arrangement of hair as the second horseman and the chief Prince. The scarf, necklace, and *dhoti* are all the same. In his hand he carries a very long *ankus*, or goad, and he wears no bracelets. The elephant he bestrides, which is evidently reduced in size for the sake of the picture, has short ears with a prodigious trunk, which is adorned with lines of paint, and a frontlet carrying bells, which comes over the ears at the side of the head. His tail is tied up very curiously by a rope under the belly to the head. This is often done to prevent its being moved when one is getting on to the beast's back thereby, at the present day; and it would almost seem to indicate that this was a portrait of an elephant which needed to be so treated. The arrangement of the hair of the attendant is different from that of any other person in the\n\n\\(^1\\) *Vide* J.A.S. vol. v. p. 482.\npicture, and two short streamers hang down from it behind. These streamers deserve a word, for they are probably the same as the ornament carried in the hand of the priest, the *utpala padma*, or \"water-lily jewel and tree leaf put together in the form of a nosegay,\" mentioned by Alexander Csoma K\u0151r\u00f6se, in J.A.S. vol. vii. p. 143, marking the subdivision of Buddhism, to which the people belonged, viz., the Rahula (*syra-gchan-hidain*), the son of Sakya, and helping to fix the date as very early. This man also probably wears earrings of no great size, and hence not very distinctly portrayed.\n\nFollowing the elephant is a priest or *Sram\u0101\u1e47a* of some rank, holding in his left hand the ornament above described. The right side certainly, and probably the whole front of the head, is shaven, as shown by the little bristles; whilst the hair from the back is made up into two great rolls, and brought forward on the left side. The slit-elongated ear also marks this man, who has not an article of ornament upon him. He wears the scarf and the long flowing *dhott*, and, like all the others, goes barefooted.\n\nBehind him come the two female musicians. Their dress is rather difficult to describe. Around their heads are fine turbans with flowing scarfs and pendent ornaments, above described as the *utpala padma*. They wear prodigious earrings or lobes, almost resembling dice-boxes, and reaching to their shoulders. (How these were suspended is not very clear, although the elongation of the ears may account for this in part.) They also have necklaces of amber or turquoise strung transversely like those of the men, heavy bracelets or bangles, and anklets. These last-named lie loosely on the ankles. They each have in addition a fine gold chain round the neck, which falls naturally between the fully-developed breasts, as in the dancing girl of the Bhilsa Topes, so ably figured in Gen. Cunningham's work; and they are nude to the waist, below which, and reaching to the ankle, is worn a very thin and transparent striped *sari*, or petticoat, fastened at the hips with a band and buckle, and scolloped in its lower edge.\n\nThe former of these women plays upon a *vina*, or lute, of a very curious shape, held horizontally, but somewhat re-\nsembling one in the plates of carvings at Amravati (Plate lxxii. fig. 1, Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship). It also slightly resembles the Egyptian form. I have, however, not been able to meet with its exact counterpart.\n\nThe second is well represented as performing on a very long and peculiar flute, projecting at either end. Her attitude and fingering of the instrument are very good; and I have not been able anywhere to find a similar flute. Its length is from four to five feet!\n\nAll the space not occupied by the drawing is filled in with Buddhist emblems, such as small circles, chakras or wheels, vessels, flowers, the sun, fruits and boughs, giving it a particularly rich effect. Amongst these, the vessels are curious, as being of exactly the same shape as those at present in use amongst the natives of India; thus showing how little the modern Hindus have changed their forms and patterns from of old.\n\nThe lips of the vessel are engraved all round with geometrical patterns formed of lines, and are much broken. The vase is also cracked. It was, I am told, in this condition when found; but I also heard that Gen. Cunningham had broken off portions for analysis, the reports of the result of which I have not able to obtain.\n\nThe metal must, however, have been very pure, or it had never resisted corrosion as it has done.\n\nIt is well known that, from very early times, and probably during the Gupta period, Buddhist erections stood on the spot where the vase was found, which buildings have long since gone to ruin, the spot itself being now held sacred to Triloknath; whilst there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the relic, of its being of very great antiquity.\n\nThe absence of Janaos or Brahmanical threads, as well as of all teekas, or caste marks; the costumes of the parties, both men and women, nude to the waist; the arms and musical instruments\u2014all point to a very early date.\n\nGreek art had by this time permeated that part of the country, having had its head-quarters at or about Peshawur; and I see nothing in the subject to lead me to fix a later date\nANCIENT INDIAN VASE.\n\nthan about 200\u2014300 A.D., or during the Gupta dynasty. The drawing appears to me to indicate a period somewhat earlier than that of the carvings on the Sanchi Tope; and although I am of opinion that the scene represents Saky\u0101 himself, I am bound to admit, there is nothing in the group which might not be held to apply to any other prince of the period referred to. Many of the details distinctly point to that time, such as the flower ornament held by the Sraman\u0101, and before described, the emblems, etc.\n\nThe drawing is fine, bold, free, and spirited; and it is much to be desired that this very interesting specimen of ancient work should be deposited at the India-house Museum, where all might see and study it. There is no inscription of any kind upon it to fix the date, so that my approximation refers rather to the date of the scene represented than to the manufacture of the vase itself. They may have been later, and the subject a reproduction of some well-known picture.\n\nThe photographs which accompany, and which need no special explanation, are executed by Mr. Griggs, of Peckham, the one from the vase itself, and the other from a larger drawing, by an artist, of the royal procession.\nART. XVIII.\u2014The Bhar Tribe. By the Rev. M. A. Sherring, LL.D., Benares. Communicated by C. Horne, M.R.A.S., late B.C.S.\n\n(Read December 4th, 1871.)\n\nThis race, variously known by the terms R\u0101jbhar, Bharat, Bharpatwa, and Bhar, once inhabited a wide tract of country extending from Gorakhpur in Northern India to Saugor in Central India. Other tribes, such as the Cher\u0101s, the Majhw\u0101rs, and the K\u014dls, were, in places, associated with them, or contiguous to them; but there is good reason to believe that the Bhars greatly outnumbered them all. They were very powerful in Oudh; and the country lying between Benares and Allah\u0101b\u0101d, on either side of the Ganges, a tract of about seventy miles in length, was almost exclusively in their possession. The entire district of Allah\u0101b\u0101d also was originally in their hands, and traces of them are still to be seen in every pargannah, more especially in those situated across the Ganges and Jamna. Their forts there, called Bhar-d\u012bh, some of which are of vast size, are very numerous; and they have the credit of having excavated all the deep tanks which now exist. The pargannah of Khairagarh bears very abundant traces of their toil and enterprise. The stone fort of that name, of immense proportions, is said to have been their work.\u00b9\n\nIn the district of Bandah, on its eastern side, are extensive hill forts, which Dr. Wilton Oldham, formerly Assistant Magistrate of that district, informs me are of Cyclopean dimensions, and are attributed to the Bhars. In particular, he mentions Lukwa, situated in the Chib\u016b pargannah.\n\nVestiges of this race are found in many places in the districts of Mirz\u0101pur, Jaunpur, Azimgarh, Gh\u0101zipur, Gorakhpur, and in the province of Oudh, where numerous embankments, tanks, subterraneous caverns, and stone forts, still exist, and\n\n\u00b9 Report of Revenue Settlement, Allah\u0101b\u0101d, vol. ii., part i.\ntestify to their energy and skill. The present inhabitants of Azimgarh have a tradition that their country, in the time of R\u00e1m, with whose kingdom, Ayodhya, it was formerly connected, was occupied by R\u00e1jbhars and As\u00fbrs. The Bhars have left behind them large mud forts, of which specimens may be seen at Harbanspur and Unchg\u00e2on, near the town of Azimgarh, and also at Ghoori. The Kunw\u00e1r and Manghai rivers of the district seem to have been connected by a trench, called Asur\u00ee\u00e1n, the work, it is said, of its primitive inhabitants. The Hari Bandh, or dam, at Amin-nagar, in the Niz\u00e2m\u00e1b\u00e2d pargannah, is an embankment generally ascribed to them.\u00b9 The Bhars once possessed the northern portion of the present district of Gh\u00e1zipur, now divided into the pargannahs of Sh\u00e2df\u00e2t\u00e2bd, Pachotar, Zuh\u00fbr\u00e2bd, while another occupied the fort of Laknesar-d\u00eeh, the deserted village of Laknesar.\u00b2\n\nYet the race, in association with other aboriginal tribes, was not confined to this united tract, but was once spread abroad in various directions in that part of the country. \"The Hindu land-owning tribes,\" says Dr. Oldham, \"all agree in stating that at the time of the first immigration of their forefathers, the entire country\u2014except a few tracts held by Brahmans so far as the forests had been cleared\u2014was occupied by aborigines, not of the Aryan race, who were in the habit of eating the flesh of swine, and using intoxicating drinks, and were called Scroes, Bhars, and Cher\u00fbs.\"\u00b3 This tradition is current, says the same writer, throughout the Benares Province, Oudh, and Behar.\n\nHow far the extensive District of Gorakhpur was occupied by the Bhars is uncertain. We know that the Kansik tribe of R\u00e2jpoots ousted them from a portion of their territory, and retain possession of it to the present day.\n\nRespecting the Bhars of Oudh, Mr. W. P. Carnegy, Deputy-Commissioner of Fyz\u00e1b\u00e2d, remarks that the ruins of their former masonry forts are to be traced by scores in\n\n\u00b9 Settlement Report of the Azimgarh District, vol. i., sec. 23, 24.\n\u00b2 Dr. Oldham's Memoir of the Gh\u00e1zipur District, part i., p. 46.\n\u00b3 Dr. Oldham's Memoir of the Gh\u00e1zipur District, part i., p. 46.\nour districts, and the name of their former capital, where they were finally overthrown by the Mahomedans, after being, according to popular tradition, artfully plied with spirits, was Kasbhawanpur, the modern town of Sultanpur, destroyed by us after the re-occupation of the province.\"\n\nThe Bhar r\u0101j, or dominion, included the whole of Eastern Oudh. Every great natural work or ancient relic there is attributed, says Mr. C. A. Elliott, in his Chronicles of Oonao, either to the Devil or the Bhars. He states, moreover, that \"almost every town whose name does not end in pur, or \u1e0d\u0101\u1e0d, or mow, or is not distinctly derivable from a proper name, is claimed by tradition, in the east of Oudh, as a Bhar town. The district of Bharaich is (if we may trust its traditions) their oldest abode, and the name of the town of Bharaich is said to be derived from them. From thence they spread southwards through the districts of Fyzabad and Sultanpur, and it is in the latter district that they maintained themselves latest, being only finally extirpated in the reign of Alamgir. It is said that some of their number may be found there even now, living a wild gipsy life in the jungles.\"\n\nThe district of Mirzapur exhibits traces and remains of this people to a greater extent than of any other tribe. The pargannah of Bhardohee, or more properly Bhardohi, is called after them. Mr. Duthoit, late deputy-superintendent of the family domains of the Maharaja of Benares, in his recent elaborate report on this pargannah, says that traces of the Bhars abound on all sides, in the form of old tanks and village forts. \"One cannot go for three miles in any direction without coming upon some of the latter.\" Their tanks are Suraj-bedi, that is, longer from east to west than from north to south; and thereby distinguishable from modern tanks, which are Chandr-bedi, and lie north and south. The bricks found in the Bhar-d\u012bha, or forts, are of enormous dimensions, and frequently measure nineteen inches in length, eleven in breadth, and two and a quarter in thickness.\n\n1 Mr. P. Carnegie's Races of Oudh, p. 22.\n2 Chronicles of Oonao, p. 26.\nquality and size they are similar to bricks often seen in ancient Buddhist buildings.\\footnote{Report on the Bhadohee Pargannah, p. 2.}\n\nThis \\textit{pargannah} stretches along the north bank of the Ganges; yet on the south side of that river, likewise, Bhar forts and towns are met with. One of their principal cities was situated about five miles to the west of the modern city of Mirz\u00e2pur, and was evidently of great extent. Its brick and stone \\textit{d\u00e9bris} is scattered over the fields for several miles. This old city is called Pamp\u00e2p\u00fbr\u00e2 by the people now living in the neighbourhood. It is probable that the original name has been lost, and that this name was given to it by the R\u00e2jpoots who took the country from the Bhars. From its size, and the substantial nature of the buildings which, judging from the relics, it contained, the city must have been of sufficient importance to be the capital of the country. It included within its circuit the ancient town of Vindhyachal, famous in the Pur\u00e2nas, and still celebrated throughout a great part of India for its shrine of the goddess Vindhyeswari, which many thousands of pilgrims from every quarter visit yearly. To the east of the town are the remains of the fort, from which spot, in a westerly direction, \\textit{d\u00e9bris} is found in great abundance.\n\nTradition says that the city once possessed one hundred and fifty temples, all of which were destroyed by that indomitable enemy of idolatry, the Emperor Aurangzebe. This is perhaps an exaggeration; yet that there were formerly magnificent temples on this spot is indisputable. Below the Ashtbh\u00fbji bungalow, a sanatorium erected on a spur of the ridge immediately above the site of the ancient city, by a public-spirited native gentleman of Mirz\u00e2pur, for the especial benefit of its European residents, is a massive square building, having the appearance of a fort. It is, however, a Hindu monastery, with a temple on its summit, reputed to be of some sanctity. This edifice has in its walls, breastworks, and foundations, a multitude of carved stones and figures, while many more cover the ground in its vicinity. The sculptures found here, and elsewhere in many\nplaces among the outlying fields for a great distance, are not of modern Hindu style; indeed, in point of design and skilfulness of execution, are far superior to the productions of Hindus of later times. Some of the figures are of that curious type described, hesitatingly, by Mr. Fergusson, in his \"Tree and Serpent Worship in India,\" as Dasyas, or aborigines, in contradistinction to the immigrant tribes of Hindus. They are readily distinguishable by their peculiar head-dress and long pointed beards. They constitute, however, but a small portion of the figures, which are for the most part representations of Hindu men and women, with most elaborate turbans and head-dresses, while exceedingly few apparently are of a sacred character. It is probable that nearly all these relics point to a later period of Bhar history, when Hindus had come and settled among them. The contrast between the long-bearded figures and the Hindu figures is very striking. It is questionable whether at the date of most of these sculptures the Bhars were still in possession of the country; indeed, I am inclined to the supposition that it had in part, or in whole, already passed from them into the hands of the Rajpoots, who are known to have been the rulers over this tract for a period of five hundred years. At the same time, the position and attitude of the Bhar figures on these sculptures indicate that at the time of their execution the Bhars were still a people of importance. It is right to add, however, that a few of the sculptures, yet only a few, represent the Bhars as the superior race, and attached to the Buddhist or Jain religion.\n\nMy friend C. J. Sibold, Esq., of Mirzapur, has made an excellent collection of sculptures from the numerous remains at Pampapura, from which a few admirable drawings by a native artist have been selected for description. I have chiefly chosen those which exhibit the bearded figures. Some of these are evidently of a sacred character. It will be observed that the cast of countenance of all the bearded figures is of a peculiar type, differing considerably from the Hindu countenances, with which, in some instances, they are associated, and also from Hindu faces of the present day.\nFigures Nos. 1 and 2 are probably Bhar Rajas; the same may be said of the bearded figure No. 3: the other figures in which are of a Hindu cast. Moreover, while the Bhar is seated, and occupies an honourable position, the Hindu to the left is standing, and is probably an attendant. The sharply-pointed beards of the Bhars in most of these sketches are very curious, being altogether unlike anything seen among the natives of India of modern times; their head-dresses, too, are singular\u2014the lower part of that of No. 1 looks like a crown.\n\nThe bearded figure in No. 4\u2014judging from his elaborate turban and long earrings\u2014is a person of some distinction. His short beard has the appearance of a neckerchief. The artist has, I suspect, hardly caught its true expression; the Hindu attendant is presenting something kneeling. In the compartment to the left, the figure with a Hindu countenance is seated cross-legged; it is four-armed, and therefore a deity, perhaps the household god of the Bhar chief. If this be so, it shows that the sketch represents a period when the Bhars worshipped Hindu idols.\n\nFigures Nos. 5 and 6 seem to be at their devotions: one has his hands united together open, according to the fashion adopted by Hindus now-a-days, as expressive of adoration or obeisance; the other has one elbow resting on hand. But we are not left in the dark either as to the act of worship or as to the object reverenced. No. 5 occupies a lower niche of a series of sculptures, the most prominent of which is a large and well-defined figure of Buddha seated. The head of this figure, which has not been figured, is manifestly of a genuine Buddhist type, with curly hair and nimbus. Moreover, it has the conventional elephant depicted to the right above, so frequently found in ancient Buddhist sculptures. An interesting question is thus incidentally started, namely, what was the primitive religion of the Bhars? In the instance before us, Buddha is the object being worshipped. If such is the case, we are carried back to a period before the Rajputs had arrived with their Hindu deities, and had induced the Bhars, whether by fair means or foul, to\nembrace Hinduism, as, from information derived from some of the sculptures, we have every reason to suppose they subsequently did.\n\nFigure No. 6 is in contemplation. He is not a devotee, as some might perhaps be inclined to imagine; for he has several bracelets and armlets on his wrist and arm; nevertheless, it is probable that he is religiously employed. Figures Nos. 7 and 8, display a considerable difference of head-dress. Their physiognomies are not of a Hindu type; the second has his beard closely cut, though still well defined. The head, No. 7, is remarkable for the size of its earrings. The small figure, No. 84,* has a head-dress, and what seem to be side-ornaments, different from all the rest. In appearance he is worshipping a round object before him on a low altar. Is it a relic casket?\n\nThe central figure in No. 9, compared with the remaining figures, is of colossal proportions. Being headless, it is impossible to speak about it with precision. The stumps of its four arms indicate that it was a divinity, but of what religion? The elephant and deer were sacred animals with the Buddhists, and are very frequently found on their sculptures. The four arms, however, seem to point to a Hindu deity. Of the thirteen subordinate human figures, the three upper ones are beardless, and most likely represent Hindus. Two of these are worshipping the central figure; the ten lower figures have all pointed beards, and present a great similarity of physiognomy. Those in an erect posture are perhaps intended to represent priests, or, it may be, men of rank in attendance on the god; one of them holds in his hand a flag, and another grasps a kind of club. All have on their heads a high conical cap or turban. The four-headed personages seated below display a very different style of head-dress, and seem to be of a humbler position in life. It is remarkable that the erect figures and the divinity also are adorned with what has the appearance of the sacred thread, while the sitting figures above and below are destitute of it. The Bhar figures, Nos. 1 and 4, have the thread also; but Nos. 2 and 3\n\n* Not figured.\nare without it. I am at a loss to explain this very singular circumstance. My own impression is, that the Bhars learnt the custom of wearing the thread from the R\u0101jpoots who came amongst them. But this must have been done before the Bhars were subdued, and while the R\u0101jpoots were mere servants to them; for it is hardly likely that the R\u0101jpoots, after they had subjugated the Bhars, would have suffered them to wear a sacred badge which only Hindus of good caste were permitted to assume.\n\nFigures Nos. 10 and 10\u00bd* are four-armed divinities, yet they exhibit the Bhar type of countenance, seen in Nos. 8 and 9; their conical caps and pointed beards are much like those observed in the erect figure of No. 12. Both are decorated with the sacred cord. The figure to the left is four feet four inches in height. The other has a massive jewelled ornament on the upper part of one of his left arms.\n\nThe sitting figure, No. 10\u00bd*, with four hands, is, I suppose, either intended for Buddha, or for one of the twenty-four subordinate divinities of the Jain religion. The hair is gathered up into a knot and tied by a fold. The double-beaded garland over the chest, passing round the waist, must not be confounded with the sacred thread.\n\nNo. 10\u00bd* presents the head of Buddha, already referred to. The entire figure seated, together with various emblematical figures on the sides and base, is a beautiful specimen of ancient sculpture. From the circumstance that one of the Bhar bearded figures of this series occupies a niche at the base of this sculpture, there is good ground for supposition, as already remarked, that the ancient Bhars were, to some extent, Buddhists.\n\nIt will be readily perceived that the beautiful figure No. 11 displays a very different countenance from any of the Bhar figures described above. I believe it to be a likeness of a Gaharw\u0101r R\u0101jpoot, probably of a chief of the family that took possession of the Bhar territory of Kantit. The conical head-dress is of the same description as that worn by Bhar chiefs in the sketches already noticed, but is more ornamented\n\n* Not figured.\nand magnificent. The figure is a divinity, as is manifest from the third eye set in the middle of the forehead, and represents, very probably, Sheva as Trilochoau, or the Three-eyed. As a specimen of art the relic is worthy of study. It is of colossal size, and originally belonged to a statue some ten or twelve feet in height.\n\nMr. Woodburn, Settlement Officer in Oudh, in his Report on the Mangalai pargannah of the Fyzabad District, has some interesting, though somewhat fanciful, observations on the nature and use of the Bhar forts in that part of Oudh. \"Bhar forts, as they are called, are common in the pargannah. They are in general simple rounded mounds, more or less lofty, strewn with broken brick. The mounds appear to be in the main artificial, and their area is never large. If the dwellings of the Bhars were confined to the mound, the population of that day must have been very scanty. This is hardly consistent with the revenue returns of Akbar's reign for the neighbourhood; and yet, according to the corroborative accounts of the Rajpoot tribes, the Bhars were dominant till Akbar's time. Impressed, however, with that idea, and feeling it hard to believe that a small population, living on an exuberant soil, could have lived in a state of constant strife, I conceived that the mounds were possibly constructed as a sanitary precaution against the malaria of a region of marshes and forests. The theory is scarcely justified by the position of some of the mounds with which I became acquainted. But, however this may be, there can be no doubt a great change has taken place in the habits of the people since the days of the mound-makers. Brick strongholds have been succeeded by clay huts; and, as in the case of Kalaparpur (where there is a Bhar fort), the people have formed the notion that evil and misfortune haunt the dwelling-places of their forerunners. It is strange how the name of the Bhars should have adhered to places that now know them no more.\"\n\nThat the Bhars were not a barbarous race, but were partially civilized, is sufficiently proved by the numerous works of skill which they have left. Their massive forts, found\nthroughout the country which they once inhabited, testify to their warlike propensities; yet they were probably erected chiefly as means of defence and as places of refuge: for in their later history it is certain they were exposed to fierce attacks from their Rajpoot neighbours. The same energy and talent which they exhibited in defending themselves against their enemies they also displayed in more peaceful pursuits. Whence this people obtained their civilization, which placed them much above the condition of many other aboriginal tribes, it is hard to say, unless we suppose that it had its origin in themselves. I know not why we should be so ready always to ascribe all the ancient civilization of India to successive troops of Hindu immigrants. The more I investigate the matter, the stronger do my convictions become, that the Hindu tribes have learnt much from the aboriginal races: but that, in the course of ages, these races have been so completely subdued, and have been so ground down by oppression, and treated with such extreme rigour and scorn, that, in the present condition of abject debasement in which we find them, we have no adequate means for judging of their original genius and power. Mr. Thomason, late Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, in his Report on the Ceded Portion of the District of Azimgarh, says of the Bhars and the tribes associated with them, \"The inhabitants of the country, by whatever name they are distinguished, were a powerful and industrious people, as is evident by the large works they have left behind them.\"\u00b9\n\nHow long prior to the Rajpoot invasions the Bhars had occupied this tract of country cannot be ascertained; yet the prosperity to which they had attained and the civilization they had acquired are sound reasons for thinking that they had held possession of it for a protracted period. Six, or at the most seven, hundred years ago, the whole of the Benares Provinces, a large portion of the Province of Oudh, and perhaps a considerable portion of outlying territories, were beyond all dispute chiefly in the hands of the Bhars and other aboriginal non-Aryan tribes. The fall of Kanouj and\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Thomason's Report on the Ceded Portion of the District of Azimgarh, p. 13.\nDelhi at the end of the twelfth century set free the great Rajpoot families, and sent them wandering all over the country in quest of new homes. These came in contact with the aboriginal tribes, and either subdued them at once, or, as was probably more frequently the case, obtained employment and lands from them in the first instance, and afterwards, as opportunity served, by degrees seized their possessions, overthrew their owners, and expelled them. This process was a long or short one, according to circumstances. In some instances, several hundred years elapsed before the end was gained. Yet finally the same conclusion was attained everywhere.\n\nThe traditions of all the land-owning tribes of the tracts referred to accord with these statements, bearing united testimony to the fact, that a few hundred years ago the middle Ganges valley was occupied by non-Aryan aboriginal races. The history of the period preceding the Rajpoot immigrations is partly historical and partly conjectural. During the prevalence of Buddhism in Northern India, the Aryan races appear to have been everywhere dominant. Some of the aboriginal tribes blended with them, though to what extent is uncertain. As Hinduism began to re-assert its authority and claims, on the decay of Buddhism, a fierce struggle seems to have arisen between the two religious factions. Yet how far the Aryans had cultivated the soil and spread themselves out into villages and towns is, strictly speaking, unknown. Whether, indeed, the country was well or only scantily populated is equally uncertain; most probably the latter supposition is the correct one. This, however, is tolerably clear, that the aboriginal tribes were in a subject condition. We have trustworthy information respecting the kingdom of Benares and a portion of that country of which Ayodhya was the capital. They were governed by Hindus. Both were originally chief seats of Hinduism; afterwards, in both places, Buddhism was very powerful; and, lastly, in both kingdoms Hinduism became once more in the ascendant. Nevertheless, the Aryan race, in its tremendous efforts to shake off the Buddhist creed, greatly\nenfeebled itself, and was consequently unable to cope with the aboriginal tribes, which, taking advantage of the religious and political strife which was destroying the life of the Hindu nation, endeavoured to regain their ancient lands, from which, ages before, they had been driven away into the forests and mountains.\n\nThe remarks of Dr. Oldham respecting the district known by the modern name of Gh\u00e2zipur are equally applicable to the whole of the Benares Provinces. \"On the downfall of Buddhism in this part of India, the distinction between the Aryans and the aborigines became as marked as ever. The former, weakened by their internecine war, were unable to hold the country; the latter, removed from the civilizing influences to which they had been subjected, relapsed wholly or partially into barbarism; and hence it was that this district, which thirteen hundred years ago formed an important part of a civilized Aryan monarchy, eight hundred years ago was under the sway of a number of petty semi-barbarous aboriginal chiefs, and had a very small Aryan population; while, on the other hand, the upper valley of the Ganges was filled with a teeming population of Hindus, who were in a position to send out colonies even before the coming of the Mussulmans, but who on their coming were compelled to do so.\"\u00b9 In this passage Dr. Oldham, I think, somewhat under-rates the civilization of the aboriginal tribes, which, as before remarked, judging from existing remains, was considerable.\n\nTo the same purport are the observations of Mr. C. A. Elliott respecting the changes in the distribution of the races of Oudh. The two periods in the history of that country, namely, Aryan and post-Aryan, he describes as follows: \"When the Aryan race,\" he says, \"invaded the Gangetic valley and the Surajbansi settled in Ayodhya, the natural resource for the aborigines would be to fly to the hills, and find refuge in their impenetrable fastnesses, girded about with the deathly Terai. When the curtain rises again, we find Ayodhya destroyed, the Surajbansi utterly vanished,\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Oldham's Statistical Memoir of the Gh\u00e2zip\u00fbr District, p. 49.\nand a great extent of country ruled over by aborigines, called Cher\u00fbs in the far east, Bhars in the centre, and Rajpusis in the west. This great revolution seems to be satisfactorily explained by the conjecture, that the Bhars, Cher\u00fbs, etc., were the aborigines whom the Aryans had driven to the hills, and who, swarming down from thence not long after the beginning of our era, overwhelmed the Aryan civilization, not only in Sahetan and the other northern towns, but in Ayodhya itself, drove the Surajbansis under Kanak Sen to emigrate into distant Gujerat, and spread over all the plain between the Himalayas and that spur of the Vindhya Range which passes through the south of Mirzapur.\"\n\nThese aboriginal races, having once re-entered the tracts of country which they had wrested from the Aryan tribes, settled upon them, and remained comparatively unmolested for a long period extending over hundreds of years. All this is plain when it is considered how firm was the hold which they had on the country when the wave of Rajpoot immigration began to flow in upon them. Their cities and towns, their industrial arts, their huge earthworks, their canals and trenches, connecting rivers, and so forth, are irrefragable proofs of their permanence and prosperity.\n\nBut it must not be imagined that the land was cleared and cultivated to the extent in which we now see it. On the contrary, it is likely that not only during this period of non-Aryan occupation of this portion of India, but also during the preceding period of Aryan occupation, the country had not been largely brought under cultivation, and that immense forests abounded, extending over many miles. My own conviction is, that only in comparatively recent times, especially since the reign of Akbar, have the vast plains of Northern India been subjected to the plough and the harrow. The Emperor Baber, the grandfather of Akbar, in his Memoirs, says that while at Chunar, a lion, a rhinoceros, and a wild buffalo were seen close on the edge of his camp, and that many elephants roamed in the jungle around Chunar, and\n\n1 Mr. C. A. Elliot's Chronicles of Oonao, p. 27.\napparently even as far as and beyond Benares. Elephants are known to have frequented the jungle between Chunar and Allahabad in the sixteenth century; and the hills to the south of the Ganges must at that time have been almost unapproachable.\n\nIt is certain, therefore, that at the time when the Bhars and other industrious aboriginal races planted their villages and cultivated the lands around them, vast tracts infested by wild beasts remained uncleared. They inhabited, in short, an illimitable forest, which they cleared in places and cultivated, subduing the untamed land, providing against dearth by digging splendid tanks, banking up morasses, utilizing water-courses, and thus laying the foundations of social happiness and comfort. \"All inquiry,\" says Mr. G. Ricketts, \"shows that the civilization of this district, namely, Allahabad, and its reclamation from the primitive jungle, was of comparatively recent date, that is, within four hundred and fifty years. Very few of the Mahomedans claim descent from the followers of Shahab-ud-din; but few Hindus date back beyond the reign of Jai-Chand, of Kanouj, whose followers, when defeated by Shahab-ud-din, populated a portion of this district; but almost all state that their ancestors took possession of those jungle tracts which form their present estates within this period.\" If our own remarks respecting the social condition of the Bhars be correct, the estimate Mr. Ricketts forms of the cultivation of this tribe, and of others in this neighbourhood, is altogether unsatisfactory.\n\nSir Henry Elliot considers it strange that so little notice is taken of the Bhars in the Puranas. The fact may be accounted for in two ways: in the first place, Brahmanical writers generally speak of the Dasyas and Asuryas, and all other non-Hindu races, with superciliousness and contempt, and consequently rarely exhibit a particle of interest in their welfare; and in the second place, the abandonment of a considerable tract of country on the part of the Aryans, who\n\n1 Census Report of the North-Western Provinces for 1865, vol. i., Appendix B., p. 127.\noccupied them, or their expulsion therefrom by aboriginal races, was an act of such little honour that it was natural not only that the circumstance should not be referred to in records devoted to the purposes of the Hindu tribes, but also that the aborigines themselves who had profited by it should be unnoticed. Sir H. Elliot conjectures, however, that an obscure reference to the Bhars is to be found in the Brahma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, where it is said, among \u201cthe descendants of Jayadhwaja are the Bharata, who, it is added, are not commonly specified from their great number.\u201d So also the Harivansa says of the Bharata, i. p. 157, \u2018They form an immense family, whose numbers it is impossible to mention.\u2019 Or they may, perhaps, be the Bhargas of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, subdued by Bh\u012bm Sen, on his eastern expedition.\u201d\n\nWith all this industry and capacity, the Bhars were destined to perish. The chief cause of their destruction was doubtless, as already stated, the success of the Mahomedan invasions of India, whereby the great R\u0101jpoot rulers of Kanouj and Delhi were overthrown, and the R\u0101jpoot tribes generally of Upper India coming into collision with a foe stronger than themselves, were compelled to surrender their old possessions and to seek out new homes. Being driven from their own countries, they fled into the more secure regions of the east, where, coming in contact with aboriginal tribes, they gradually subdued them.\n\nIn the Gh\u0101zipur and Azimgarh districts a fierce and prolonged contest was carried on between the Bhars and the Sengarh R\u0101jpoots, from Phaphund in the District of Etawah. These latter first entered the northern part of Gh\u0101zipur, in the employment of the Bhar Raja who resided there. After a time, receiving some provocation from the Raja, they killed him, and endeavoured to seize his territory. The Bhars, however, bravely defended their lands; but the superior military skill of their enemies was more than a match for their courage and numbers, and they were obliged to submit to the yoke of the conqueror. The Sengarhs had two chiefs, Hari Thakur and Bir Thakur. The descendants of the former\n\n1 Elliot\u2019s Supplemental Glossary, p. 83.\noccupy the Laknesar pargannah, while those of the latter are found partly in the Zuhurabad pargannah of the Ghazipur District, and partly in a portion of Sikandarpur, in the Azimgarh District. They reckon fifteen generations since their arrival in these parts, which shows that the Bhar rule lasted until a comparatively recent period.\n\nThe extensive pargannah of Kantit, in the Mirzapur District, derives its name, according to tradition, from the famous Raja Karn, who, it is said, came on a tirth, or pilgrimage, to the island of Ram Gyah, in the Ganges, near Vindhyachal. Karn-tirth has been contracted into Kantit. Formerly this tract was in the possession of the Bhars, but was wrested from them by the Gaharwar Rajpoots, under their chief, Gudhan Deo, of the family of Raja Jai-Chand, of Kanouj, who massacred the Bhar ruler, together with his relations and attendants. The capital of the Bhar kingdom in these parts was, I conjecture, the extensive city of Pampapura, from which the sculptures were brought which have already been described. Gudhan Deo built forts on his domains, portions of which are still standing. This chief also took from the Bhars the lands of Khairagarh\u2014now a pargannah in the Allahabad District\u2014which afterwards fell to one of his sons.\n\nThe number chaurasi, or eighty-four, was applied to so many villages. Hence there is a Tuppeh Chaurasi, or sub-division, consisting of eighty-four villages, both in the pargannah of Kantit and Khairagarh. This family became very powerful, and spread over a wide extent of country, occupying large tracts in the districts of Allahabad, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, and Benares. The present Raja of Manda, one of Gudhan Deo's descendants, possesses a small portion only of this territory; yet it consists of six hundred and seventy-five square miles.\n\nIt has been said that the Gaharwar Rajpoots once ruled from old Kanouj to Allahabad and Mirzapur; but this, perhaps, is only conjecture.\n\nTo the north of the Ganges, in what is now the Badohi\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. Oldham's Statistical Memoir of the Ghazipur District, chap. iii. sec. ix.\n2 Mr. C. Raikes' Settlement Records of Kantit Pargannah, sec. 4. Report of Revenue Settlement, Allahabad, vol. ii., part i. sec. 29.\npargannah, the Bhar principality was destroyed by the Monus Rajpoots, who came from Amber, or old Jaipur, where the elder branch of the clan still exists. The tradition of the circumstance\u2014universally believed in the neighbourhood\u2014is as follows:\u2014Five persons of the Mon race undertook to perform a pilgrimage from their own country to Benares. Passing through the Bhar territory, they were attracted by its advantages, and determined to remain there, and to settle among its inhabitants. They were joined by other members of their tribe, whom they invited over. As they increased in numbers and importance, the Bhars sought to make alliances with them; but their overtures being discountenanced, disputes at length arose on the subject of intermarriage which increased to blows. This seems to have been the signal for a general attack upon the Bhars, and in the struggle which ensued the Monus people were so successful that they not only completely subjugated the aborigines, but utterly destroyed them. At the present day scarcely a Bhar is to be found from one extremity of the pargannah to the other, so absolute and entire has been their extermination.\n\nFortune, however, is a fickle goddess, and the fate of the Monus Rajpoots of Bhadohi, and also of the Gaharwar Rajpoots of Kantit, affords a notable instance of her inconstancy. The former, calling in the aid of Pirhipat Singh, Raja of Partabgarh, to settle their family disputes, fell into his power; and, in the year 1751, the pargannah passed from his hands into those of Balwant Singh, Raja of Benares, with whose descendants it still remains. This powerful and ambitious chieftain also obtained possession of the Kantit lands, driving out the Gaharwar Raja, Vikramajit, who, with his attendants, sought safety in flight. For nearly five hundred years the Raja and his predecessors had occupied the country. On the rebellion of Raja Cheit Singh, of Benares, Warren Hastings sent for Raja Gobindjit, son of Vikramajit, from his hiding-place, for the purpose of restoring to him his patrimonial estate of Kantit. The new Raja of Benares, however, had sufficient influence with the British Government to hinder its restoration; and he only received\na tenth part of its original receipts. His successors now reside in the old Gaharw\u00e2r Fort of Bijapur, the domains of which were afterwards given as a commutation of the tenth. The prestige of the ancient Gaharw\u00e2r family in the flourishing commercial city of Mirz\u00e2pur is very great; and when the Mutiny was at its height, the Government wisely availed themselves of it in preserving order among the people.\n\nIt is greatly to the credit of the R\u00e2ja of Benares, that during the time of his occupancy of the Kantit estate, he exerted himself most energetically in promoting the prosperity of the new and rising city of Mirz\u00e2pur. He sent over traders of various kinds from Benares, and a detachment of horse and foot was stationed there for the security of its inhabitants. The trade of the city rapidly increased, and it is not too much to say that its present important position as one of the chief centres of trade in this province is mainly the result of the R\u00e2ja's enterprise.\n\nAgain, in the district of Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d several tribes of R\u00e2jpoots at various times ejected the Bhars. For instance, the Bais R\u00e2jpoots are found in Jhansa pargannah; the Monus R\u00e2jpoots, in Kawai; the Sonak, in Meh; the Tessyal, in Sikandra; and the Nauwak, in Nawab Gunj. The Bisen R\u00e2jpoots have settled in Karra, and Atharban in the Doab.\n\nThe Bais R\u00e2jpoots of Oudh were very ruthless in their treatment of these industrious aborigines. Mr. Patrick Carnegy, in his \"Historical Sketch of Fyz\u00e2b\u00e2d,\" gives a particular account of the successful raids by members of the Bais tribe in that part of Oudh now known as the district of Fyz\u00e2b\u00e2d. The Bais of Malethu overthrew and dispossessed the Bhars only two hundred years ago; whilst the Bhars of Sohwal and R\u00fbr\u00fb aided in the suppression of the Bhars four hundred years since. The Bais of Uchh\u00e2pali did the same about the same period. The Bais of R\u00e2mp\u00fbr Bhagun Tikvi fought the Bhars in the time of the Emperor Jeh\u00e2ng\u00eer.\n\n1 Report of the Bhadohi Pargannah, pp. 4, 5, 8.\n2 The same.\n3 Report of Revenue Settlement, Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, vol. ii., part i., sec. 45. Settlement Report of the Azimgarh District, vol. i., sec. 24.\nfor depressing them as low as possible. The mental superiority of the Aryan races over the Bhars, and other similar aboriginal tribes, admits of no dispute; and it is equally certain that, in industry and practical sagacity, they were barely equal to them. This is proved by the fact, patent to all residing in those parts of India to which special reference has been made in this essay, that there are more numerous remains of their mechanical ability and scientific attainments in that tract than of all the Rajpoots and other Aryan tribes that have succeeded them. In the view of the writer, special measures should be adopted by philanthropists for the social and political regeneration of the Bhar, the Seori\u2014which has suffered a like degradation\u2014and other aboriginal tribes. Well-informed and generous Hindus, who are deriving incalculable benefits from British rule in India\u2014aspirants for political distinctions and favours, men animated, or professing to be animated, with noble desires for the enlightenment of their fellow-countrymen\u2014may fairly be called upon to render efficient aid in this great enterprise. Nor should the Government withhold a helping hand. It has paid little practical attention to these despised classes hitherto. This is a grave though unintentional error. Why should not the Bhar and Seori have a chance to recover their lost social position? The Government has it in its power to afford them this chance. Has it yet the will?\n\nA few of the Bhar tribe, although they may not have saved themselves from social contempt, are still in possession of property and comparative independence. While not a single Bhar landed proprietor exists in the Bhadohi pargannah of the Mirzapur District, there are two Bhar land-holders, or were not long since, in the neighbouring pargannah of Kantit, in the same district. But these men, disloyal to their tribe, though wise in their generation, feeling the grievous burden of their social position, affect a Rajpoot title, notwithstanding that it is well known they are directly descended from the Bhars. The extensive tract in the Vindhya Hills, known as the Tall\u00fbg\u00e2 of Koindih, belongs to a Bhar clan.\n\nIn the Allahabad District this unfortunate race seems to\nhave been well nigh extinguished. There are, however, three Bhar villages in the Khari\u0101garh pargannah, namely, Majera, Kaly\u0101npur, and Omraicha, the families of which are said to have right to six others, although in reality only occupying these three. It is probable that the Bhars, driven away from more civilized regions, retreated into the wild jungle of Khari\u0101garh, and remained there long after multitudes of their race in other places had been destroyed. But they were finally expelled by the present R\u0101ja of M\u0101nd\u0101, to whom reference has been already made. The Arail and Barrah pargannahs have also Bhars residing in them. They are likewise met with in every village of pargannah Salimp\u016br, Majhohi in the Gorakhpur District. In Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d they still hold a portion of the extensive domains formerly in the possession of the tribe. A pargannah of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur is called Bharwa.\n\nIn fact, the Bhars still cling with pertinacity to the country in which their more fortunate ancestors flourished for so many generations. In most of the cities and towns, and in not a few of the villages likewise, scattered members of the tribe are found. They exhibit little tribal cohesiveness or esprit de corps, and are utterly destitute of spirit and enterprise. In the Gh\u0101zipur District alone there are fifty-six thousand Bhars; in Gorakhpur, sixty-three thousand; in Azimgarh, sixty-nine thousand; in Benares, thirty-three thousand, and many more in other places. Bhars are commonly employed as village policemen, and also as ploughmen. It is said that there are properly two divisions of them, the Bhars and the R\u0101jbhars, the latter differing from the former in not eating swines' flesh, and being regarded, consequently, as more honourable than the latter. It is not improbable that they may be descended from the old Bhar nobility. Rajpoots are in the habit of purchasing female children from the R\u0101jbhars and marrying them to their sons; this arises from the habit of infanticide which has existed for so long among some of the Rajpoot tribes.\n\nIn spite of the pertinacity with which, if tradition is correct, the higher castes kept aloof from Bhar alliances, they\nwere not always successful in doing so. In the Allahabad District, for instance, three examples are found of unions with Bhar families. Mr. G. Ricketts in his memorandum states that three influential castes or clans claim an admixture of Bhar blood. These are the Bharors, Garhors, and Tikaitz. The two former are not numerous; they are landed proprietors in the southern portion of this district, and appear to be a connecting link between the higher castes, who are generally landed proprietors, and those inferior castes, whose lot is servitude. The Tikaitz are numerous and possess much influence. A Chauhan leader carried off his Bhar chief's daughter. The descendants are still proprietors of a portion of that Bhar chief's possessions.\n\nMr. P. Carnegy, in his \"Notes on the Races of Oudh,\" indulges the strange notion that the Bhars are of Rajpoot origin, and the Cher\u00fas also, \"and such like.\" And yet he acknowledges that the \"weight of opinion seems to be in favour of the belief that the Bhars may have been the so-called aborigines of Eastern Oudh, which formerly included Azimgarh and Gorakhpur.\" This view he dissents from, holding that if they were \"not the aborigines of Eastern Oudh, they were at any rate Rajpoots in Rama's time, or long before the Christian era.\"\n\nIt is a question of considerable ethnological interest whether the Bhars were originally connected with the Cher\u00fas, Seoris, and other ancient races of Northern India. The Cher\u00fas are sometimes spoken of as a branch of the Bhars; and as to the Seoris, it was the opinion of Sir H. Elliot that there was great reason to suppose that Cher\u00fas and Seoris were formerly one and the same; yet he says it is very difficult to trace the connexion between these tribes. It is certainly remarkable that the pargannah of Barhar, in the Mirzapur District\u2014which I have no doubt should be Bharhar; the second syllable, \"har,\" being the reduplication of the \"har\" of the first syllable\u2014is at the present time partly inhabited by a race of Seoris.\n\nMy own belief is, that many of the aboriginal tribes of\n\n1 Mr. Ricketts' Report, p. 128.\nIndia were originally blended together. All investigation into the races of India goes to prove that at various epochs separate tribes have spread over the land, one pushing forward another, the weaker and less civilized retreating to the jungles and hilly fastnesses; and the stronger, in their turn, giving place to fresh and more vigorous clans. It may be impossible to prove, therefore, what is nevertheless highly probable, that in very ancient times most of these tribes were exceedingly few in number; for it is a singular circumstance, opposed, indeed, when regarded superficially, to the assumption I am making, that the races of India, whether Aryan or non-Aryan, for a long succession of ages, have largely maintained their distinctive individuality, notwithstanding the fluctuations in their respective histories. Still, to some extent, they have united with one another, and it is indisputable that a large number of the low castes of India have sprung from unions between the races. In many instances a careful scrutiny can detect in these castes, not only their special differences, but also the very names by which the clans they represent were primarily designated.\n\nThis scattering of tribes over the country has produced a result which perhaps is not found on the same scale in any other part of the world, namely, that every district in India has its peculiar clans, with their own traditions and annals; and has, in addition, a host of fragmentary and isolated remnants of lost or vanquished tribes, like the Bhars, of which, in some cases, scarcely more than their bare names can now be traced.\n\nBut the subject of the history of the aboriginal races of India is one which, although material is being gradually collected for its elucidation, is nevertheless so intricate and involved that it will require long and patient research before satisfactory conclusions are attained. The unravelling of the tangled skein of Indian history is necessarily a work of time, and of great difficulty. Yet something has been already accomplished by earnest, conscientious, and painstaking labourers. Exceedingly harassing as the task undoubtedly is, still knot after knot of the disordered thread is being gradually\nunloosed. The enterprise is one demanding perseverance and industry, which will achieve in this, as in most pursuits, far greater and more brilliant results than the sudden efforts of an intense and fitful enthusiasm.\n\nIn addition to my own independent investigations on the subject of this essay, I have received considerable assistance in its preparation from the following works:\u2014Mr. Plowden's General Report of the Census of the North-West Provinces, for 1865; Mr. G.

Carnegie's Races, Tribes, and Castes of the Province of Oudh.\nART. XIX.\u2014Of Jihad in Mohammedan Law, and its application to British India. By N. B. E. Baillie.\n\nThe term Jihad is technically applied to warfare carried on for the propagation of the Mohammedan religion. As such warfare is unlawful, unless the people against whom it is about to be waged have been first summoned to embrace the faith, this summons has entered into the legal definition of the term. Jihad is accordingly defined to be a call to the true religion, and war with those who refuse to accept it in their persons or property,\u2014that is, by professing the faith themselves, or by submitting to pay the jizyut or poll-tax, by means of which they are rendered free to the open profession of their own religion.\n\nTwo conditions are required to the permission or legality of Jihad. One of these is the refusal of the enemy, when called upon, to submit to the proffered terms, together with the absence of any agreement or treaty between them and the Mussulmans; and the other is good ground for hope on the part of the latter that they will be able to contend successfully against the enemy, should the terms be rejected. Subject to these conditions, aggressive warfare against infidels is lawful according to the Soonnees. But the Sheeahs add a further condition, namely, the presence of the Imam, or of some one appointed by him to conduct the Jihad; and as that cannot be had while he remains concealed from the eyes of the faithful, Jihad, according to the Sheeahs, is, under present circumstances, positively forbidden. It is, I think, commonly assumed by Soonnee writers, at least by those of the Hanifite or prevailing sect in India, that Jihads are directed and organized by the Imam or head of the whole Mussulman community. But as in these times there is no\n\n1 Futawa Alum-geeree, vol. ii., p. 266. 2 Hamilton's Hedayat, vol. ii., p. 141. 3 Shuraya-ool-Islam, p. 136.\ngenerally acknowledged head of the whole community, it is held that the duty of Jihad, which is in a manner incumbent on all true believers, is sufficiently satisfied if any one koum or tribe of Mussulmans is engaged in it. It follows, therefore, that Jihad may be proclaimed and organized by the Imam or head of any tribe or nation of Mussulmans who is able to conduct it with a reasonable hope of success; without which, indeed, Jihad is positively unlawful, as a useless imperilling of the lives and property of the faithful.\n\nWhen the Imam has determined on a Jihad, he should review and number his army, to ascertain its strength in horse and foot, and enter the names of his soldiers in a general muster-roll. He is then, upon entering the enemy's country, to call upon the people in the terms before mentioned, and if they should reject both alternatives, and are conquered, their persons and property are at his absolute disposal. It is important to observe that if there should be any among the conquered people who have embraced the faith, though themselves and their infant children are free, and they are allowed to retain possession of their movable property, yet all of it that is immovable becomes, like the rest of the conquered territory, fei, or confiscated for the benefit of the conquerors.\n\nFrom what has been said it is obvious that Jihad is public warfare, and as it is permitted only under conditions which a State alone is capable of satisfying, it is evident that it is only in such circumstances that it can ever be the duty of individual Mussulmans to join in it. Even then it is only a general duty, and does not become special, so as by its neglect to bring guilt on individuals, so long as it is engaged in by any one tribe or people of Mussulmans. The only case in which, from being a general duty, it becomes special, is that of a nufier or alarm that the enemy are coming to attack a country, and the persons, families, and property of its inhabitants. It then becomes the duty of all who are able to go out to the Jihad. But even in such circumstances, it is not the duty of the whole Mussulman community to come to\n\n1 Fut. Alum., vol. ii., p. 268. 2 Hodays, vol. ii., p. 170.\ntheir aid. Only those who are near the enemy, and able to contend with them, are bound to join in the contest. With regard to all the rest, the duty remains as before, *furz-i-kifayut*, that is, one which is sufficiently fulfilled, if observed by any tribe belonging to the community.\n\nThese are the only two cases that I have met with in the books in which *Jihad* is permitted or lawful, and they afford no sanction to the idea that Mussulmans living under a foreign government are allowed to rise up against it unprovoked; while it is to be observed that permission is absolutely necessary to the legality of *Jihad*, for the destruction of human life is in itself a positive evil.\\(^1\\) Much less can such a rising be considered a duty under such circumstances. Indeed, to suppose that it can be so is little short of a libel against the Mohammedan Law and Religion.\n\nI have hitherto assumed that there is no treaty or agreement between the people against whom the *Jihad* is carried on and the general body of Mussulmans. Though Mohammedans have long ceased to be under the sway of one sovereign, they are so bound together by the common tie of Isl\u00e1m, that as between themselves there is no difference of country, and they are therefore said to compose one *dar* or mansion; and in like manner, all who are not Mohammedans, being accounted by them as of one faith, however much they may differ from each other in religious belief, are also said to be of one *dar*. The whole world, therefore, or so much of it as is inhabited and under regular government, has been divided into the *Dar-ool-Islam*, which comprehends Arabia and all other countries subject to Mussulman rule, and the *Dar-ool-Hurb*, which comprehends all countries that are not subject to such rule.\n\nThough *hurb* means literally enmity, and all foreigners are *hurbees* or enemies in the eye of the law, yet Mohammedan governments have found it necessary, from the earliest times, to enter into treaties of peace with foreigners. It is true that the Imam may, if he deem it to be for the advantage of the Mussulmans, withdraw from such treaties by giving due\n\n\\(^1\\) *Heday\u00e1*, vol. ii., p. 140.\nnotice of his intention; but while the treaties remain in force they are strictly to be observed, and are binding on the whole community. The notice of withdrawal must be such as to enable the king or ruler of the people with whom the treaty was made, to give his subjects timely warning throughout his dominions, and thus put them on their guard against a renewal of hostilities. Without such notice the renewal would be *ghudr* or perfidy, for which the Prophet has indicated his special abhorrence in terms that will be noticed more particularly hereafter.\n\nThe exigencies of commerce have also rendered it necessary to sanction the residence of foreigners in Mohammedan countries, when similar privileges are allowed to Mohammedans in these countries. In such circumstances, when a Mohammedan is allowed to reside in a foreign country, he is strictly prohibited by his own law from molesting in any way, either in their persons or property, the people among whom he is permitted to dwell. The reason or principle of the prohibition is this, that by *isteeman* or obtaining protection, he has become in a manner a *samin*, or surety to the people for his peaceable conduct towards them, and any molestation by him of them, under such circumstances, would be a breach of suretyship, and an act of *ghudr* or perfidy.\\(^1\\) The principle is therefore quite general,\u2014suretyship being the co-relative of protection,\u2014and it is equally applicable to all persons, whether merchants or not, and whatever be their numbers, who have obtained, or are in the enjoyment of, the protection. Being the co-relative of protection, it is binding only so long as that is afforded. If, therefore, the sovereign of the country should break his engagement by seizing the property of a Mussulman resident, or throwing him into prison, or others should do so with the sovereign's knowledge and without his preventing them, the person subjected to such treatment would be freed from his counter-obligation, and might lawfully retaliate by molesting the people of the country in their persons or property. But until this takes place, the resident under protection, or *moostamin* as he is\n\n\\(^1\\) Hidayah (original), vol. ii., p. 716.\ntermed, is bound to refrain, and any breach of his obligation of suretyship is, as already observed, *ghudr* or perfidy.\n\nNow Mohammed has marked his special abhorrence of this offence by declaring that the *ghadir* or perfidious person shall be set up on a stake, that is impaled, at the day of final retribution, in order that his perfidy may be publicly made known to the assembled universe.\\(^1\\)\n\nSo much for the general law of *Jihad*. Let us now see how far it is applicable to the relation in which the British Government stands to Mohammedan countries, and the Mussulman subjects of our Indian Empire stand towards the Government of that country.\n\nWith regard to the first point, there are subsisting treaties of amity between the British Government, on the one hand, and the Turkish Empire and the kingdoms of Persia and Afghanistan on the other. These treaties are binding on the whole Mussulman community; in so much that while they subsist, *Jihad*, or warfare for the purpose of propagating the Mussulman faith among the subjects of the British Government, is prohibited to all Mohammedan States. If, therefore, the *Sultanah* camp, which is said to be formed on our north-west frontier, for the purpose of invading our territories, is to be considered as a Mohammedan State, having a duly constituted Imam at its head (and it is only on such a supposition that *Jihad* by it would be lawful), then the people assembled in it are bound by the said treaties, and are actually prohibited by their own law from making any assault of a religious character upon us. It cannot therefore be lawful for other Mussulmans to assist them in any attempt of the kind, and much less so for our Indian Mussulmans, who are under a further restraint by the protection afforded them by the Government of that country.\n\nThat they enjoy the fullest protection under the British Government cannot be denied. Nor has it ever been alleged that they are exposed to any kind of molestation in their persons or property by the Government, or by any other persons with its knowledge or connivance. They are thus\n\n\\(^1\\) *Kifayah*, vol. ii., p. 762.\nclearly under the obligation imposed upon them by their isteeman or enjoyment of protection. Any act of hostility in their own persons, or by money or other assistance given to enemies, would therefore be an act of ghudr or perfidy on their part, and thus expose them to the doom denounced against the ghadir by their own Prophet.\n\nBefore concluding these remarks, I will briefly advert to a question that has been lately revived amongst Mussulmans in India, viz., whether so much of that country as is subject to British rule has become Dar-ool-Hurb, or is still Dar-ool-Islam. Prim\u00e2 facie, every country under any other than Mussulman government is to be accounted Dar-ool-Hurb. But, according to Aboo Huneefa, a country which, like British India, was once Dar-ool-Islam, does not change its character merely by passing under the government of infidels. Other conditions are required, which can hardly be said to be fully satisfied in the case of British India. According to his two disciples and companions, Aboo Yoosuf and Mohammed, these conditions are not required, simple conquest being all that they deem necessary. Analogy is in favour of their opinion, but the results to which their doctrine would lead are rather in favour of that of their master. By conquest the whole property, public and private, of the conquered people, passes ipso facto to their conquerors; and this holds good of conquests by infidels over Mohammedans, provided that the property is secured within the infidel territory. Now this condition is satisfied at once if the country in which the property is situated becomes Dar-ool-Hurb, and the Mussulman owners thus lose all right to reclaim their property, if it has been divided, as it legally may be, among the soldiery. Be that as it may, there is, however, no doubt that when the two disciples concur in opinion against their master, a judge is at liberty, according to the general rule, to adopt whichever of the opinions he thinks best. A Mohammedan leader disposed to attack British India is therefore not unlikely to treat it as Dar-ool-Hurb. Let us assume, then, that British India is Dar-ool-Hurb, and, further, let us suppose that the threatened Sittanah invasion has been made and is successful,\nwhat are likely to be the consequences of such an event to Mussulmans in British India? The Sitanahs are Wahabees, that is, Sunnites of the strictest sect of the law, who wish to restore all things to their pristine vigour. According to the Mohammedan law the conquered country, with all the property, public or private, of its inhabitants, would immediately pass by the mere fact of conquest to the conquerors. There would be an exception to this in favour of the Mussulmans, so far as regards their movable property, but none as to their lands. These, as already mentioned, would, like the rest of the land in the country, become fei, or be confiscated for the general purposes of the State. In particular, all permanent settlements of the revenue would be swept away; and last, but not least, all La Khiraj tenures, which, if extended beyond the life of the grantee, are utterly void at Mohammedan law, might be at once cancelled. Further, the Mussulmans in particular, might be subjected to a rigid exaction of the zukat or poor's-rate from all persons possessed of property to the value of 200 dirhems (about ten pounds); which would be more than any income-tax that is ever likely to be imposed upon them by their Christian rulers. So that, on the whole, it might be better for our Indian Mussulmans, in a worldly point of view, as well as more conformable to the precepts of their Prophet, to remain contented with their present condition under the British Government, than to take their chance of what might befall them under conquerors of their own religion.\nART. XX.\u2014Comments on Recent Pehlevi Decipherments. With an Incidental Sketch of the Derivation of Aryan Alphabets. And Contributions to the Early History and Geography of Tabaristan. Illustrated by Coins. By E. Thomas, F.R.S.\n\nThe plates which accompany this article have only recently been rescued from an obscure corner, where they had lain for years unappreciated. They originally constituted one division of a comprehensive medallic series, illustrative of the annals of the Sassanian Kings of Persia, which were prepared under the supervision of the late J. R. Steuart, from specimens in his own cabinets, and executed by the same conscientious Italian artist who engraved the copper-plates of the Saurashtran coins inserted in one of the earliest numbers of our Journal (vol. iv. p. 273, o.s.).\n\nThe two engravings, which now appear for the first time, embrace the concluding section of the series of ten 4to. plates devoted to the coins of \"the Sassanian dynasty,\" and represent the specially transitional period immediately succeeding the Arab conquest. They furnish choice and consecutive examples of the introductory Muslim mintages, ranging from the crude imitative reproductions of Sassanian money by the first Muhammadians in Persia, and mark, in their gradations, the progressive stages of the Pehlvi mintages of the more settled rulers, up to the final adoption of the Kufic of the Kur\u00e1n as the official alphabet of the expanded dominions of the Khalifs.\n\nThe majority of these pieces have already been described in our pages (vols. xii. p. 253, xiii. p. 373); but as I hesitated to burden the Society with such costly and elaborate designs, these engravings may, even at this distant date, fitly contribute to the elucidation of the general subject, and serve to\n\n1 These plates are now the property of that enterprising collector of Oriental antiquities, Col. S. C. Guthrie, who has freely permitted them to be used, in transfer, on stone, by the Royal Asiatic Society.

I propose to restrict the present notice of the coins to little more than a mere recital and explanation of their legends, with occasional references to the general progress of the study of the Pehlvi language that has marked the interval since the publication of my later papers on these subjects. As regards the purely numismatic aspect of the question, I am the more anxious to reserve any extended remarks, as our Society will be glad to learn that the illustration of this period of the history of the East is likely to receive considerable accessions, in the description of the magnificent collection of the late M. de Bartholomai, which is already in an advanced stage towards publication under the practised treatment of our learned Foreign Associate, Dr. Dorn, of St. Petersburg.\n\nAs preliminary and introductory to my special subject, I have to advert prominently to the discovery of the day, the \"Moabite Stone,\" and the bearings of its typical alphabet upon the later developments of cognate Semitic characters on coins and other contemporary records; and somewhat unwillingly to reply, as briefly as possible, to certain criticisms which have appeared of late upon the Palaeographic definitions and deductions put forth in my previous essays in this Journal.\n\nThe proclamation of Mesha, engraved on the now unhappily defaced monolith of Dibon, which has created so great a sensation in the Biblical world, presents but little of novelty to advanced students of initiatory Greek Numismatics, or\n\n1 La St\u00e8le de Dhiban, M.

From the latter I extract the following close summary:\n\n\"An alphabet common to all the Semitic populations of Syria\u2014an alphabet from which were derived the Greek letters on the one side, and all the later alphabets of the East on the other.\n\n\"This alphabet is, doubtless, almost, if not absolutely identical with that employed by the poets, prophets, and historians of the kingdom of Judah and Israel, when they committed their works to writing; and it may be well for scholars to bear this in mind while attempting conjectural emendations upon the Biblical texts.\"\u2014North British Review, October, 1870.\nPaleographers who are able to trace the offshoots of the Phoenician alphabet from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Jumna. Nevertheless, its contributions are varied and valuable, presenting us with a complete alphabet of an ascertained date, some century and a half earlier than any other parallel document, a singularly close association in the configuration of some of its letters with the most authentic forms of Archaic Greek, and a new geographical site of dominant Semitism on the frontiers of Cuneiform strongholds.\n\nBeyond the ordinary identities with the early Greek characters already freely recognized, the forms of the letters \u0393, \u0394, \u039b, and \u039e, are specially marked; we have new outlines of the digamma \u03a8 and the \u0397, a modification of the \u0391, and a varied definition of the \u03a4, many of which peculiarities connect this most authoritative exemplar of the normal alphabet with the more clearly defined Aramaean and Persian types of Semitic writing.\n\nMore than twenty years ago I ventured to dissent from De Sacy's identification of the Sassanian letter \u03c1 as m n; an interpretation which he had adopted on the faith of Anquetil du Perron, who had derived his knowledge of Pehlvi from the imperfect teachings of the Parsis of Bombay. Although I was in a position to determine that De Sacy was in error,\n\n1 Num.

Burrows, Yaqut, p. x. Dr. Lezeg gives a promising period for this statement in his note. \"The European reader may be a little astonished to learn that Anquetil's work was regarded afterwards as a kind of authority by the Dasturs themselves.\" (\"Sacred Language of the Parsis,\" Bombay, 1863, p. 21.)

In support of these binary identifications, I re-examined the question under its various aspects, somewhat at large, in a late number of this journal,\\(^1\\) as I was aware that there was a disposition to adhere to the old reading among many who had compromised themselves by accepting the original definition, even to the extent of its reception and incorporation into modern grammars and glossaries.\\(^2\\) The question has lately been revived by the direct negation of my justification for this correction by Dr. Martin Haug,\\(^3\\) with a reiteration of the claims of the Parsi rendering of \\( m n (man) \\).\n\n\\(^1\\) Vol. iii. n.s. p. 260.\n\n\\(^2\\) I conclude it is to some such feeling of hostility at my venturing to differ, not only from certain Continental professors, but more expressly from their masters in Bombay, that I owe an amusingly rabid attack in the \"Revue Critique\" (27th March, 1869), by M. Justi. The tone of this article would not prevent my making any serious notice; but it is not within my object only be obtained by my entering upon a discussion with the author, or those who accept his interpretations upon texts the very alphabet of which is still in dispute. So that, although M. Justi's eccentric lubrication has received the commendation of M. Renan (Rapport, Journal Asiatique), I am content to surrender the writer to the more congenial conflict with his countryman, Dr. Haug, who has already sounded the note of defiance, about the \"grave errors\" of my \"vicious\" critic, whom he contemptuously designates as \"a mere follower of Spiegel.\" (Pahlavi-Zand Glossary, pp. 25, 32.)\n\n\\(^3\\) Dr. Haug is scarcely candid in affirming that \"the phonetic value of the character \\( \\text{\u0686} \\) has been thought to be \\( i \\), chiefly on account of its resemblance in form to the Zend letter \\( \\text{\u0633} \\)\" (An Old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary, 1870, p. 44). There is far more varied testimony towards the identification than this abrupt utterance would imply, as I have, in effect, repeated above. My first acceptance of the letter as \\( i \\) dates from 1862 (Journal Royal Asiatic Society, xiii. p. 375); and I find Dr. Haug confessing in 1862 (Essays on the Sacred Language of the Parsees, Bombay, p. 45) that \\( \\text{\u0686} \\) \\( \\text{\u0628\u0632\u062c} \\) is the Chaldee \\( \\text{\u0628\u0632\u062c} \\), \"son,\" (\\( \\text{ben} \\) in Hebrew and Arabic); the \\( j \\) at the end is another pronunciation of the relative \\( i \\) (or \\( \\text{iqdfat} \\)) above mentioned [in \\( \\text{\u0686} \\) \\( \\text{\u0628\u0632\u062c} \\) \\( \\text{\u0628\u0632\u062c} \\)]. It is curious that the Professor should at this period have so accurately realized and defined the mission of the letter and its direct association with the short \\( i \\), and yet have failed to detect its positive import. It was reserved, however, for his later baptism in the fire-worship of the Gujarati Destors to convert him from his hard-earned European knowledge to their atmosphere of placid ignorance, and the restoration of the contested symbol\nI have held from the first that the idea of combining consonants, for the purpose of eliding the inherent short \\(a\\) of the conventional Aryan speech, was altogether undeveloped in the Semitic alphabet of the Sassanians, though the system had already been elaborated in the more critical Bactrian adaptation of the old Phoenician characters in its parallel contact with the contrasted \\(L\u00e1t\\) or \\(P\u00e1h\\) character of the Indian provinces. This tendency is readily exemplified in the practical transcription of Greek names on the local coinage, where we find the Bactrian \"Eukratides\" and the Indian P\u0101li \"Agathokles\" coalescing the consonant succeeding to the \\(k\\), in either case to denote emphatically the absence of the soft \\(a\\). Here the object of compounding and connecting letters is obvious enough; but the most singular fact which the advocates of the rendering of the Sassanian \\(p\\) as \\(p = m n\\) are altogether unable to explain is, if, as they confess, the two simple letters \\(p m\\) and \\(p n\\) were written separately in the parallel text, with an optional value of \\(man\\) or \\(min\\), why, or for what possible object, an arbitrary compound should have been introduced to convey the self-same sounds, a resulting alphabetical combination, moreover, which, according to their own showing, did not necessarily elide the short vowel. If this particular sign \\(p\\) had been a composite character for \\(m n\\), matured during the progressive manipulation of the normal alphabet, it ought to show some traces of the parent letters, whereas the simple \\(p\\), in its various gradations, flows easily to Anquetil du Perron's faulty version of \\(man\\), contributed of old by the less dependable representatives of the P\u0101li faith in 1759.\n\nMr. E. W. West, C.E., whose good service to the cause of Indian paleography in his facsimiles and decipherments of the inscriptions on the walls of the Western Cave Temples, I can freely bear testimony to, has lately undertaken the study of Pehlvi, in concert with Dr. Haug, of Munich, and has argued the question of the value of the character under discussion with much patience and ingenuity in opposition to my interpretation. I am unable to discover that he has at all shaken my position, and I regret to find that he ignores, or unduly subordinates, the very important evidence in favour of the \\(t\\), to be drawn from the previous identities of the Phoenician and other derivative forms of \\(p\\). (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 1876, p. 394.)\n\n---\n\n1 A larger assortment of these compounds is given in my plate of the Bactrian alphabet (Num. Chron. iii. n.s. plate vi.), and the particular instances above cited may be consulted in Gen. Cunningham's plate v. vol. vii. of the same journal; and the facsimiles illustrating Professor Downson's article on Bactrian Inscriptions, J.R.A.S. xx. o.s. p. 221. See also Professor Wilson's Kapurdigiri Inscription, J.R.A.S. xii. p. 153.\nfrom the archaic model on the Moabite stone to the crystal-\nlized forms of the Pehlvi and Zend type letters \u03c1, \u03c2 (in some\nfounts more distinctly \u03c1 = \u03c2), which were based on MS.\nwriting, and engraved by independent parties on the Con-\ntinent, altogether prior to any suggestion of this unpre-\nmeditated controversy. In addition to this difficulty\nabout the m n, Mr. West has introduced a new element of\ndiscord in summarily attempting to convert the very palpable\n\u03c1 = \u03c2 of the Chaldee-Pehlvi into a \u03c1; and, finally, Dr. Haug\ndesires to elevate a badly defined \u03c1 = k in the Sassanian text\nof the inscription into a new and extraneous letter, represent-\ning the sound of \"kat.\" It may be said that this does not\npresent a very long list of variants, after all; but the deter-\nmination of the value of the most important of these char-\nacters as m n, or i, constitutes a positively vital question, as\nits decision in a measure carries with it the determination of\nthe structure of the language itself.\n\nUp to this time the Inscription Paleography maintains its\narchaic features in the absolute isolation of letter from letter.\nThe tendency to continuous MS. writing, due to the con-\nsecutive flow of the pen upon a smooth surface, has already\nbeen adverted to (J.R.A.S. iii. n.s. p. 252). Its effect was\nspeedily to reduce the Sassanian Pehlvi into the irrepress-\nible conjunction of consonants and general reticulation of\nletters, which has added an adventitious obstacle to the free\ndecipherment of the ancient writings in their modern garb.\nThis tendency may be traced, in its progressive action, in the\naccompanying plates, and in its more ample development in\nthe limited table of compounds prefixed to the description of\nthe coins, in my previous article (vol. xii. p. 274). But the\nlater Parsi complications may be exemplified by the demand\nof Dr. Haug upon his European printers for several hundred\ndifferent forms to secure sufficient ambiguity for his client's\ninterpretations.\n\nHad the Bombay Parsis really understood the language they\npretended to interpret, they might have printed every text\nin their possession, and at the same time have secured far\ngreater legibility, with the detached letters of their limited alphabet, instead of complicating the decipherment by the use of imitative MS. interlaced forms, for the partial definition of which no less than sixteen pages of modern type were required.\n\nFinally, to reduce me to definite extinction, under the Pahlavi aspect, MM. Haug and West have put forth a trial piece, or competitive essay, in the form of a new and improved version of the bilingual inscriptions of Sapor engraved on the smoothed inner surface of the cavern at H\u00e1jib\u00e1d. My own tentative reading of this confessedly obscure text,\u2014a text, be it remembered, that had set European linguists at defiance for half a century,\u2014was given with sufficient reserve, a feeling which does not seem to be shared by later interpreters. All I can say is, that if this translation, revised by Dr. Haug in 1870, after a preliminary ventilation by Mr. West in our pages in 1869, really and truly represents the purport of the original inscription, the \"divine\" King Sapor must have arrived at a very advanced stage of dotage before he could have consented to put his hand to such a document.\n\n1 The Old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary devotes sixteen pages (25-41) to \"the various phonetic powers of the letters and their compounds occurring in the glossaries,\" etc., and its Editors confess that the list of needless obscurations is far from complete.\n\n2 In 1858 it was said in my edition of \"Prinsep's Essays,\" ii. p. 108, \"Of all those who are learned in Zend and its cognate languages\u2014of the various professors who edit Pahlvi texts, or who put together grammars of that tongue\u2014no single individual has to this day been able to add one line of translation to the bilingual inscriptions of H\u00e1jib\u00e1d, beyond what De Saey had already taught us in 1793. In brief, our power of interpretation fails us exactly where the Sassanians have omitted to supply us with the Greek translations they appended to some of the parallel texts.\"\n\n3 R.A.S. iii. n.s. p. 339.\n\n4 Let the readers should suppose that I am exaggerating in this matter, I append M. Haug's revised version in his own original words:\u2014After titles, etc., \"the king. As we shot this arrow, then we shot it in the presence of the satraps, the grandees, peers and noblemen; we put the foot in this cave; we threw the arrow outside that it should reach the target; the arrow (was) flying beyond that (target); whither the arrow had been thrown, there was no place (to hit), where if a target had been constructed, then it (the arrow) would have been manifest (?). Afterwards it was ordered by us: an invisible target is constructed for the future (?); an invisible hand has written: 'do not put the foot in this cave, and do not put this arrow in this place,' after this invisible arrow has been thrown at this target;\"\u2014Haug, Pahlavi General Glossary, p. 64. This reads like a very chaotic version of the ancient fable of Minuchehar, whose arrow from the peak of Damavand was to settle new boundaries, but whose progress through the air the incredulous reduced from the pretended Divine\nOne of the most curious points in this controversy is that Dr. Haug, whose accepted local oracle denounces in unmeasured terms\\(^1\\) the ignorance of his fellow P\u0101rs\u012bs of Bombay\u2014proposes, like myself, to rectify their orthographical errors by an appeal to the unpolluted sources of \"Sassanian Inscriptions.\"\\(^2\\) It is clear that, under these conditions, the typical alphabetical scheme ought to be subjected to the most rigorous and thoroughly independent criticism; otherwise, if it be allowed in any way to lend itself to the needs of preconceived P\u0101rs\u012b interpretations, it not only fails in its appointed mission, but perpetuates the very faults it is invoked to correct.\n\nI have shown (p. 411, note 3) that Dr. Haug was very nearly fathoming the real import of the ancient character \\(\\text{\ud800\udfa0}\\); but what shall we say of his elected antagonist,\\(^3\\) M. Spiegel, who, after unconsciously admitting the mechanical configuration, and recognizing the true value of the sign in question, still theoretically hugged the ancient delusion of Anquetil in an opposite sense, despite of a second proof, amid his new materials, of its patent fallacy, in the obvious existence of a fourth vowel in his own Pehlvi MSS., to which he was obliged to concede an independent value amounting to something more than the force and effect of a short \\(i\\), thereby confessing, in the very fact, that the normal language he was dealing with required some such additional letter, which he clearly did not\n\n\\(^1\\) For the last 500 or 600 years, the knowledge of P\u0101zand, or pure Persian, has gradually declined amongst Persian scholars in general, and especially amongst P\u0101rs\u012b priests; so much so, that very few of the Dest\u016brs can now either write or understand it correctly, as can readily be seen from their imperfect notes in Pahlavi books, and other modes of expression in other writings. This ignorance has prevailed to such an extent, that though the priests learn this glossary, parrot-like, off by heart, yet they cannot critically make out the exact meanings of many words, but are satisfied with mere guesses, etc.\u2014Dest\u016br Hoshang Jamasp, in his Old Pahlavi-P\u0101zand Glossary, p. ix.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. p. vii.\n\n\\(^3\\) There has been a good deal of needless acerbity introduced into these discussions, and Dr. Haug seems to exist only in a permanent state of warfare with the rest of his countrymen. Spiegel, however, is more distinctly singled out for condemnation, and amusingly says the following: \"In regards his views of the character of the language, and his explanation of the same, I believe the linguists are not likely to feel satisfied.\" \"The title of (a later) work, 'The Traditional Literature of the Parsis,' in its connexion with the contemporaneous literature, is therefore more pretentious than appropriate,\" etc., etc. (An Old Pahlavi-P\u0101zand Glossary, pp. 16, 20.)\nknow how to provide for in his vague alphabetical reconstructions.\n\nIn his first publication, the P\u0101rs\u012b Grammar (1851), M. Spiegel expressly declared that the identical character was the Y\u0101\u2019i m\u2019arif, or known y\u0101\u2019, as opposed to the Y\u0101\u2019i majh\u016bl, or unknown y\u0101\u2019, represented by the Zend \u03be. In his subsequent work on the \u201cHuzv\u0101resch-sprache\u201d (1856), he servilely adheres to Anquetil\u2019s Boman \u064a\u0645 for \u064a\u0645 (pp. 169, 172); but simultaneously enters in his Pehlv\u012b alphabets the letter above referred to outlined as , to which he assigns the value of \u0113 (pp. 27, 48, 53). This letter, as I have attempted to prove in my previous article, is, however, nothing more than i final, or the iz\u0101fat which plays so important a part in old and new Persian vernaculars, and which may be traced in the accompanying plates from the final \u0649 in Khusrui, figs. 1, 2, to the positive conjunctive but instructively isolated iz\u0101fat in figs. 3, 4, etc. I must, however, do M. Spiegel the justice to say that he has discarded the obnoxious Boman from his latest Pehlv\u012b vocabularies.\n\nThe Editors of the Old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary, though they do not admit the letter to a place in their table of alphabets, are constrained to recognize its true import amid the list of compound characters, where is acknowledged to represent the sounds of \u201cal, hi, or kht.\u201d Why then, by parity of reasoning, should not be equal to the ii, or, in\n\n1 Grammatik der P\u0101rsisprache (Leipzig, 1851), p. 22.\n\n(a) l. oder \u064a\u0645 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647 ist der Zend vocal 10, z.

I, on the other hand, aim at the more comprehensive criticism afforded by the dialects of immediately proximate lands, and the inductive teaching of the earlier alphabets, preserved on medals, seals, and other antiquarian remains, which come down to the confessed starting-point of the attempted neo-Persian reconstruction of the ancient rituals, under Ardashir B\u0101bak and his immediate successors. The representatives of the archaic creed to whom this duty was entrusted are most candid in their admissions of the difficulties they had to encounter consequent upon the pretended destruction of the scriptures of the old Fire-Worshippers by Alexander the Great,\u00b2 and the unavowed but more important influence of 557 years of discouragement and obscuration of the religion itself, which succeeded, under the Seleucidae and Arsacidae, up to the date of the attempted revival of their ancestral faith.\n\nNor did the ancient tongue itself fare better than the lost books which embodied the primitive rites. So long as the original Pehlvi maintained its position as the ruling vernacular,\u00b9 there is no possible pretence for saying that Alexander destroyed the ancient literature of the land; the single Palace and the Royal Archives at Persepolis were burnt; but so far from the Macedonian conqueror having proposed to himself any mission of eradicating old creeds, he rather took to them under their pleasant aspects. The real destroyers of the primitive lore were the Muslims, who nevertheless reverenced, and for a time preserved, and finally translated all that was worth having in the accessible Pehlvi MSS. It would rather seem that the new Zoroastrianism ought to take its date from the latter period of depression; for there clearly were plenty of Pehlvi MSS. still extant in A.H. 318 = A.D. 930.\u2014See Reinoud, Abulfed, p. lxv. note 2.\ncular utterance, current among all classes of the nation, the limited seventeen letters of the coeval alphabet fully sufficed to convey any required sense to the comprehensions of those who thought and spoke in the common language. We have a nearly parallel illustration of this faculty of using short-hand notation in the colloquial Hindi of the present day, which resolutely refuses to avail itself of the intricacies of the more elaborated Sanskrit characters, and adheres consistently to the simple detached consonants of antiquity, with all the associate uncertainty of intonation. But the typical Persian language clearly became degraded on its own soil, under the action of successive waves of conquest, irregular hostile occupation and the introduction of foreign speech into the official documents of court and camp, as alien rulers chanced to dominate. Such influences, apart from the general depression of the religious communities, who alone had an interest in the preservation of the sacred texts, must have rendered any satisfactory reconstruction of the earlier rituals a task far beyond the powers of the degenerate Mobeds of the scattered Fire-temples, even if the old letters of the alphabet had not been then, as now, altogether insufficient to define obsolete grammatical inflexions, and still less competent to restore the purport of a lost tongue.\n\nThe language of the inscriptions, under these conditions, may be held to have primarily followed the mixed speech of the head-quarters, which consisted of a sort of Eastern Lingua Franca or Mesopotamian Uriti, abounding in Aramaisms, and in the selected epigraphs under review, freely interspersed with independent religious texts, which were by no means necessarily Zoroastrian.\n\nThe language of the books, on the other hand, if they truly reproduced the ancient texts, should have presented a modified form either of primitive Pehlvi, archaic Zend, or, at the lowest, a dialect but little removed from the Persian Cuneiform. But, to judge by its composite character, it would seem as if the dry bones and disjecta membra of the old Iranian rituals had been galvanized into a specious vitality by the introduction of Semitic verbs with Persian terminations, added to which the practice of writing one word and\npronouncing another savours strongly of priestcraft, whose revision in this case was neither competent nor honest. If to construct grammars and dictionaries out of such materials be a labour of high ingenuity, I can concede that much credit to our modern authorities; but I must be excused if I remain incredulous as to the value on finality of the results thus obtained.\n\nIf I have had to suggest anything derogatory to the attainments of the modern P\u0101rsi teachers in the Western Presidency, I am glad to have the opportunity of quoting, with renewed hope, our own Royal Asiatic Society's motto, \"Ex Oriente lux,\" as, by a singular chance, I have this day (11th Jan., 1872) received from Bombay a comprehensive series of the publications of the later earnest revivers of the old lore, in their adopted home under the British flag\u2014in the shape of even more difficult reading than the Pehlv\u012b itself, as explained and illustrated by Guzr\u0101t\u012b commentaries; but I recognize with satisfaction the conscientious endeavours of the present representatives of the archaic faith in Bombay to encounter, and I trust overcome, many of the difficulties inherent in their ethnic language\u2014in this I am the more encouraged by the tone of mixed frankness and confidence disclosed in Dest\u016br Behr\u0101mji Sunjana's preface to his new Pehlv\u012b Grammar, which augurs well for the future, in a seeming aspiration of the local P\u0101rsis to free themselves from European dogmatism, and to rehabilitate their national speech by their intuitive hereditary perceptions, from independent\n\n---\n\n1 A Grammar of the Pahlavi Language, by Peshotun Dustoor Behramjee Sunjana. (Bombay, 1871.) Preface, p. iii.: \"The pronunciations of the Semitic terms as used by the Dastoors of Ir\u0101n and of India are founded on the well-known authority of Malik Namah Assoores, which, as will be mentioned hereafter, is now more than 1200 years old, and at the time when this work was written the Pahlavi language was in its pristine use amongst the Zoroastrians of Ir\u0101n. The modern Orientalists of Europe, however, have introduced modifications, but such modifications I do not feel justified in recommending to my Zoroastrian brethren.\" Of course, I am not likely to endorse all our new grammarian's notions, many of which are clearly crude, and require for their correction that foreign travel and outside ventilation which I have advised above; but not the less may I welcome an effort at free thought, and a seeking after the truth, which I admire above all things. One word of warning, too, I must add to those who may be disposed to over-estimate the advantages of Iranian descent, in the revival and reconstruction of their ancient tongue, as they must bear in mind that for many centuries past they have been obliged to acquire their knowledge and learnt from their cradles to frame their ideas in an alien idiom; so that their ancestral language, or even its modern representative, has to be acquired anew.\nsources and the extant documents of their creed. I am sanguine that these records may be largely augmented when the less passive members of the community undertake to scrutinize their own Indian depositaries, or boldly seek to penetrate into other closed receptacles of the obscure literature of the past,\u2014in lands to which they have preferential access.\n\nIn concluding this branch of a single alphabetical controversy, I may be permitted to reproduce a more comprehensive view of the general question, which I submitted *viv\u0101 voce*, but with scant preparation, to the Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 9th April, 1866.\n\nAs this merely suggestive outline has never been formally incorporated in our *Transactions*, I make no apology for quoting in full the semi-official report of the proceedings of the meeting of that date from the *Athen\u00e6um* newspaper.\n\nThe Right Hon. Viscount Strangford in the chair.\u2014Mr. Thomas, adverting to recent controversies respecting the parentage of the various modes of writing in use in ancient India, spoke \"On the Adapted Alphabets of the Aryan Races.\" These were the results of his palaeographical investigations: The Aryans invented no alphabet of their own for their special form of human speech, but were, in all their migrations, indebted to the nationality amid whom they settled for their instruction in the science of writing: (1) The Persian Cuneiform owed its origin to the Assyrian, and the Assyrian Cuneiform emanated from an antecedent Turanian symbolic character; (2) the Greek and Latin alphabets were manifestly derived from the Phoenician; (3) the Bactrian was adapted to its more precise functions by a reconstruction and amplification of Phoenician models; (4) the Devanagari was appropriated to the expression of the Sanskrit language from the pre-existing Indian P\u0101li or L\u0101t alphabet, which was obviously originated to meet the requirements of Turanian (Dravidian) dialects; (5) the Pehlevi was the offspring of later and already modified Phoenician letters; and (6) the Zend was elaborated out of the limited elements of the Pehlevi writing, but by a totally different method to that followed in the adaptation of the Semitic Bactrian.\n\nMr. Thomas then proceeded to advert to the single point open to discussion involved under the 4th head, tracing the progress of the successive waves of Aryan immigration from the Oxus into the provinces of Ariana and the Hindu Kush, and the downward course of the pastoral races from their first entry into the Panjab and the associate crude chants of the Vedic hymns to the establishment of the cultivated Brahmanic institutions on the banks of the Sarasvati, and the elaboration of Sanskrit grammar at Taxila, connecting the advance of their literature with the simplified but extended alphabet they constructed in the Arianian provinces out of a very archaic type of Phoenician, and whose graphic efficiency was so singularly aided by the free use of birch bark. This alphabet continued in use as the official writing under the Greek and Indo-Scythian rulers.\nof Northern India, until it was superseded by the superior fitness and capabilities of the local Pali, which is proved by Asoka's scattered inscriptions on rocks and monoliths (Lats) to have constituted the current writing of the continent of India in c.250, while a similar, if not identical, character is seen to have furnished the prototype of all the varying systems of writing employed by the different nationalities of India at large, from Sind to Ceylon, and spreading over Burmah, till the Indian Pali meets Chinese alphabets on their own soil in Annam. In conclusion, Mr. Thomas pointed out the importance of the discoveries of Norris and Caldwell, derived from completely independent sources, regarding the Scythic origin of the introductory Indian alphabets.\n\nNo substantive article was ever prepared or published in further development of the somewhat comprehensive theory thus enunciated; but its purport has been quoted with seeming approval, and, as far as I am aware, without hostile comment in France and Germany. The subject has likewise been discussed at two several meetings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. With the general tenor of these quasi conversational proceedings I have no possible cause of dissatisfaction. Naturally, the living representatives of the Indian Aryans resented any notion of their ancestors having borrowed, even more convenient mechanical vehicles for the expression of thought, from the ignorant Dravidians of the south; but the facts are cumulatively against them, especially\n\n1 Journal Asiatic Society, Bengal, and Meeting, 6th Feb., 1867, p. 33.\n2 The subjoined quotation is in so far a virtual reproduction of my letter, inviting the discussion, in situ, of the comparative priority of Indian alphabets, which was read at the Meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal on 5th February, 1867. It had been taken thereupon of liberty with the printed report, to rectify the singular error of the local press, which contrived to arrange my data in the directly opposite sense to the concurrent argument; and as chance would have it, by a casual transposition of the descriptive headings of the alphabets, to obscure completely the whole question, either to Eastern or Western comprehensions. I have, perhaps, been over-confident of the strength of my position, in abstaining, until this moment, from any protest against an editorial blunder, which, in mild terms, left me in a complete minority. But I am quite confident to reverse this complete inversion in a burst of enthusiastic attention, and I am most curious to learn the course the discussion took at the Meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal; more especially as I am now following out the Indian section of the inquiry, and have arrived already at some unexpected results, tending to confirm the original Dravidian derivation of the Sanskrit alphabet. The readers of our Journal will not fail to call to mind that Prinsep, in his early comments upon the Lat alphabet, pointed out that, in many instances, the aspirate letters were formed by a duplication of the lines of their corresponding simple letters. The question then arises, to what extent these aspirates had been developed, but the inference was, that they had been formed simultaneously with the simple letters, and out of the same elements. I have a different theory to propose, which I submit for the examination and comments of your members: it is to assume that all the simple letters were Dravidian, and constituted a complete and sufficient alphabet for that class of languages, while the aspirates were later additions required for the due expression of Magadhi and other northern dialects, as the Sanskrit in after-times added its own sibilants to the latter alphabet.\nas they have now an opportunity of selecting new adversaries\n\nA glance at the subjacent comparative alphabets will show the twenty consonants (out of the full twenty-three) of the Dravidian system, as opposed to the thirty-one consonants of the Prakrit or Asoka's edition. Of the additional aspirates of the latter scheme, two only can in any way claim to be ordinarily derived from the Sanskrit and Tha; while a more simple origin might be sought for the latter in a common circle: dh, dh, and ph may fairly be taken as intentional modifications of their corresponding normal letters; but kh and gh, like th and th, have more in common as fellow aspirates than association with their own leading consonants; and, finally, jh and bh seem to have been unfettered adaptations. The e (c) again differs from the y (y) only in the reversal of the leading lower limb. As the alphabetical data, upon which we have now to rely, are derived from inscriptions embodying a different language, and dating so late as B.C. 250, we can scarcely expect to recover the missing Dravidian consonants; but one, at least, of the vowel tests is significant in the extreme. The Dravidian vowels, as contrasted with the Sanskrit series by Caldwell, arrange themselves as follows:\n\nSanskrit, a, \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, r\u012b, \u1e5b\u012b, \u1e5d\u012b, \u2014, \u0113, ai, \u2014, \u0101i, au, u, ah.\n\nTamul, a, \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u0113, ai, o, \u0113, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\n\n\"The value of the simple e, in the Lat character, admits of no doubt, the outline of the letter takes the form of P, while the elongated vowel is constructed by a duplication of the sound, effected by the addition of a medial e, thus P = ee, apparently the original Dravidian \u0113 (or possibly ai), but which, in Asoka's inscriptions, is made to do duty for ai. In the more distinctly Sanskrit adaptations of the Devanagari Bactrian alphabet, the initial a (?) formed the basis of all the other vowels, whose varying values were discriminated by their several vowel marks.\n\n\"I am unwilling to enlarge upon an avowedly speculative suggestion, but I think few will fail to detect the contrast between the archaic crudeness of the simpler forms of the various consonants and cursive varieties of the same signs in the Lat alphabet. Had the latter class of characters uniformly followed the typical design of their corresponding simple letters, there would have been more reason to have assumed a simultaneous and congruous initiation; but the introduction of anomalous signs among the gutturals, the remarkable cursive development assigned to the aspirates, as opposed to the stiff outlines of their simple prototypes (an advance equal in degree, but less obviously marked in the dh and dh), and the inconsistent development of the bh, upon the basis of the old d, all seem to indicate a later and independent elaboration of the aspirates.\n\nThe Normal Dravidian Alphabet.\n\nConsonants.\n\n+ k ,, ^ g ,, C n. + \u1e0d kh ^ \u1e0d gh C\n\nd ch ,, \u03b5 j ,, \u1e0d n. d \u1e0d chh \u03b5 \u1e0d jh \u1e0d\n\n( t ,, \u1e5b d ,, \u1e5b n.

The derivation of the term has hitherto been considered uncertain; the dictionaries give one of its variants as \"Ignis cultor\"; but the simple version here seems to be \u0633\u0627\u0646 \"light,\" with the conjunction of \u064a\u0631 from \u064a\u0631 \"to bear,\" or \u064a\u0631 \"with fire,\" in the Biblical form. Though the \u0633\u0627\u0646 as a Semitic word might seem out of place in combination with an Aryan termination, I should feel no difficulty in this respect, as the languages were conterminous and interchangeable in many quarters.

Rawlinson's discoveries in 1866,1 prominently\n\n---\n\n1 \"The belief in a very early empire in Central Asia, coeval with the institution of the Assyrian monarchy, was common among the Greeks long anterior to Alexander's expedition to the East, and could only have been derived from the traditions current at the court of the Achaemenian kings. This belief, again, is connected through the names of Oxyartes and Zoroaster with the Iranian division of the Aryan race, and receives confirmation from the earliest memorials of that people. . . . It is with the Eastern Iranians, however, that we are principally concerned, as the founders of Central Asian civilization. This people, on the authority of the Vendidad, may be supposed to have achieved their first stage of development in Sughd. Their language was probably Zend, as distinguished from the Achaemenian Persian and somewhat more archaic than the dialects of the northern lands of the Aryans of the south. A more striking evidence, however, of the very high state of power and civilization to which they attained is to be found in the information regarding them preserved by the celebrated Abu Rihan Al Biruni, himself a native of the country, and the only Arab writer who investigated the antiquities of the East in a true spirit of historical criticism. This writer supplies us with an extensive specimen of the old dialects of Sughd and Kharism. He gives us in those dialects the names of the twelve months, the names of the thirty days of the month, and the five Epagomenae, together with the names of the signs of the Zodiac and of the seven planets; and lastly the divisions of the year. The portion of his manuscript is original, and offers a most curious subject for investigation; but the majority of the names can be compared, as was to be expected, with the Zend correspondents, and, indeed, are much nearer to the primitive forms than are the better known Parsee equivalents.\n\nAccording to Abu Rihan, again, the solar calendar of Kharism was the most perfect scheme for measuring time with which he was acquainted; and it was maintained by the astronomers of that country that both the solar and lunar Zodices had originated with them, the divisions of the signs in their system being far more regular than those adopted by the Greeks and Arabs. Abu Rihan asserts that the Kharismians dated originally from an epoch anterior by 980 years to the era of Seleucia, a date which agrees pretty accurately with the period assigned by our best scholars to the invention of the Jyotisha or Indian calendar.\"\n\n\u2014Quarterly Review, October, 1866, p. 488, etc.\n\nThis last is, perhaps, the most interesting item we gain from Al Biruni's revelations. That there should have existed, in Kharism, a serial system of dating, commencing from 980 years anterior to the official epoch of the Seleucid (312\u2014311 B.C.) = 1304 B.C., was startling enough; but it is seldom that a given theoretical position attains such minute details as to establish, beyond its own mission, a distinct an identity between scattered and seemingly isolated facts and the same section of the human family; and it is something more than a curious coincidence to associate with this independent method of reckoning the fact that the Oriental world has been wearing itself, for a long time past, to explain whence, how, and why, a fixed sacrificial date, variously calculated by modern astronomers, and possibly, but imperfectly, sustained in the transmuted versions of the old texts, should have developed so close an identity, in its latest and most matured average, with the original numbers of 1304 B.C.; but such would seem to be the result of the independent tests applied to the Jyotisha observations of the Colossi still in use in the Vedic ritual of India under the confession of the later Brahmanical exponents of the ancient creed.\n\nSee also Num.

Meanwhile, we welcome a contribution from the improved text of the Arab geographer, Al Istakhri, which affirms independently the early traditions of Aryanism of speech in those distant lands, and brings me face to face with an identification, which may chance to prove of considerable importance in the general inquiry: that is, the association of the ancient name of the kingdom of Kh\u0101rizm itself, with the misinterpreted modern\n\nSanskrit Literature (1859), p. 521; Text of Rig Veda, vol. iv., preface, p. lxiv.; Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Dr. Whitney, vol. i. n.s. p. 316; Sir Edward Colebrooke, \"Note on the preceding article,\" p. 382; Strabo, ii. c. i. 15, xi. c. vi. i, c. vii. 3, c. xi. 5; Pliny, vi. 18, 19; Arrian, iii. c. 29, vii. c. 16; Chronique de Tabari, i. 119; Wilson, Ariana Antiqua, 144; Rawlinson's Herodotus, i. 664; Journal Royal Geographical Society, xix.

Rawlinson has continued the publication of his expositions of the ancient Geography of the Oxus, in a paper contributed to the current number of the Edinburgh Review (Jan., 1872), from which I extract the subjoined notice: but, in explanation of a somewhat dubious expression in the context, I am given to understand that the emplacement of the original \"Oromasian\" \u1e24apta Hindu on the Upper Oxus, is not in any way to be understood to conflict with the later Vedic designation of the Sapta Sindhu of the Panj\u0101b.\u2014As these identifications are all new and contravene the criticism of the last hundred years, it may be necessary to cite some additional support. In the first place, the indication of the name of \u1e24apta Hindu, or 'the seven rivers,' to the Upper Oxus, there is the direct authority of Abu Rih\u0101n.\" See Elliot's Histories, i., p. 49. \"India, or the Panj\u0101b, had been previously understood by the critics.\" (p. 13.)\n\n2.

Bir\u016bni's information on this subject is alike new and important, for these countries were the homestead of Zoroastrianism and the focus of Central Asian civilization, which, shortly before it was trodden down by the Mongols and Tatars, struck a traveller, like Yakut, with admiration.

See also Prof. N\u00f6ldeke's review of this work in the Academy, Oct. 1, 1871, p. 461.\n\n4. \"In the Scythic version of the Behistun cuneiform inscription of Darius, the name of the province of Kh\u0101rizm is expressed by \u1e62ar\u1e63arayi, admitting a free and optional interchange of the consonants m and v or w; the parallel Persian\nterm of \"Huzvarish,\" ordinarily applied to one of the divisions of Pehlvi writing. If the archaic Oriental names, which I have subjoined into a foot-note, confess to an identical derivation and primary purport, we may have to bring the written language, the cognate alphabet embodied on the banks of the Euphrates, into closer relations with the undetermined palaeography of the Eastern nidus.\n\nFor a long time past a vague impression has prevailed that the sister dialect, expressed in the kindred Pehlvi character, might likewise be connected with the geographical limits of the less disturbed settlements of the Aryan Fire-worshippers. A curious confirmation of this supposition has lately been contributed by the publication of the Arabic text of Ibn Khordadbeh, a man in a manner born in the faith, as his name implies, who classes the sanctuaries of Zoroastrianism under the emphatic topographical designation of the \"land of the Pehlvins.\" I reproduce the passage from the excellent French translation of the unique Oxford M.S. by M. Barbier de Montpensier:\n\n\"Le nom de Huzvarish est une d\u00e9formation de Varazm, ou Varazmish.\"\n\n\u2014(Mr. Norris, J.R.A.S., xv. pp. 28, 97, 191.)\n\nMr. Norris and myself have since discussed this question, and I find that he was under the impression that he himself had already conceived such a solution. However, as we have both sought for any published declaration to that effect, we are quite content to concur in the probable coincidence now put forth.\n\n1. Destir Hoshanghi Jamaspji, in his Omyat, Bombay, 1867, preface, p. iii., asserts, that \"Huzvarish means nothing, and can neither be explained from the Persian nor from a Semitic language.\" The latest Parsi attempt at the explanation of the term is that of Dastur Sanjana, who transforms it into Huzvakhelten, i.e. the Chaldee language.\u2014(Dr. Haug, in Trauner's Record, Nov. 30, 1871, p. 75.)\n\n2. \"It is to be written in the writing of the Avesta, or in that of Sevat (Chaldea), which is uvdesh.\"\u2014(Haug, p. 42, quoting J. M\u00fcller.)\n\n3. \"Dilem was the Medin inferior, Mazenderan and the countries between the Caspian and the Tigris, one of the original seats of the Pehlvi (Herren, Act. Soc. G\u00f6ttingen, xiii.). Dilem was also a retreat of that language. In the breaking up of a great empire, the institutions of the conquered race always linger in the extremities. The Caucasus, the country of Derbend, Segestan, and Kerm\u00e1n, thus sheltered the ancient language and religion of Persia, and thus the mountains of Dilem retained till the tenth century the worship of fire, and perhaps, therefore, the Pehlvi, with which that worship had been connected.\"\u2014James Morier, Persia, etc. (1812), pp. 288, 406.

I have satisfied myself that \u0628\u06cc\u0634 is the preferable transcription; but the question still remains, as to what locality the designation applies.

I am glad to see that the Turks are beginning to appreciate Numismatics in their higher sense, and Western Orientalists may compliment them on the original work of Djivet Efendi, which the French epitomist designates by the title of \"Coup d'\u0153il sur les Monnaies Musulmanes.\" This publication enumerates the following novelties from the cabinets of Subhi Bey, who has since been nominated to the Government of Damascus, where we may wish him every success, on such promising ground, in the further acquisition of new aids to history. 1st.

In addition to these pieces, Djivet Efendi quotes two coins of Abd' allah Zobeir, of Dirdghird, A.H. 60, and Yezid, A.H. 61.

This table is not only instructive in itself, in defining the geographical distribution of the recent conquests, but may prove of considerable value in testing, retrospectively, the ancient monetary centres, whose designations are so imperfectly preserved in the curtailed and transmutable forms of the old Pahlavi characters.\nThe subjoined list has been compiled by Col. Guthrie, and embraces the latest acquisitions of his own collection, those of the British Museum, and of Mr. Rogers, H.M., Consul at Cairo. The identification of the Mint cities has been revised by Senhor C.

Here I may take an opportunity of remarking, that throughout most parts of this province, nearly all the men, several women, and even the children carried tabrs of this kind, either thrown over their backs, like walking sticks, or resting by the curve on their shoulders.\"\u2014Ouseley, iii. 269.\n\nPictet, \"Les Origines Indo-Europ\u00e9ennes\" (1850), positively revels in the multitude of Aryan terms for this aboriginal implement, from which the province of Taberistan took its name, and which he pushes up to the dubious sounds of tak-tok, \"the voice of the axe\"; and though in no wise repudiating the heavy stone period, which might have produced a less definite sound, yet still insisting upon the root tak, taksh, but admitting very broad latitudes when he comes to the Persian tabar, tabar, tepen, tepen, tabar, delah, and Tabidan, Tapak, Toprah, Toprah, dov, dov to talanari, talia, and some further underdeveloped coincidences that may suggest themselves to the English reader.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sir T.

The leading classical evidence, which is reproduced where needful, has for long past been embodied in print or otherwise fully accessible and open to modern criticism, with the single exception of Ptolemy's comprehensive geography of these Eastern lands, which has hitherto been strangely neglected.\\(^1\\) But, as a general rule, the statements of the Greek and Latin authorities have been tested by European commentators under the single issue of the internal limited and often conflicting testimony of the fragments which have come down to us. In these later days, we have for some time been in possession of very material aid in the more exact definitions and illustrations of the earlier Arabian geographers, whose published texts have recently been largely augmented and improved by our able and indefatigable continental coadjutors; and, finally, the travels of our own countrymen in these unfrequented regions, extending over more than two centuries, have furnished in anticipation a collection of data for the elucidation of much that was previously obscure and unintelligible in the primitive condition of the people who lived upon one of the most important pathways between the old and the new divisions of the Aryan families.\n\nIn entering upon the provincial definitions, we must start from the central point of the earliest capital noticed by the Greek writers. I am disposed to revert, in defiance of all new ideas and combinations, to D'Anville's natural identification of Arrian's Zadracarta\\(^2\\) with the town of Sari, which for so many ages irregularly contested with Amol the distinction of the title of the metropolitan city. The Zadpa sufficiently accords with a probably faulty transcription of the imperfectly\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There seems to have been a very prevalent idea that Hudson had reproduced the whole of Ptolemy's work. He has done so in regard to the text of certain localities, but for the bulk of the original he avowedly confines himself to very meagre extracts.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tairra \u1f21 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f08\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03c9\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f21 \u0396\u03b1\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1, \u1f41 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f18\u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u1f23\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f08\u03c3\u03c3\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03c9\u03bd \u1f24\u03bd.\u2014Arrian, Exp.

We need not trace in detail the minor stages of this initiative march, the localities themselves remain unchanged, in some cases under other denominations, as occupiers of conflicting nationalities superimposed their own special nomenclatures.\n\nOne instructive lesson we gain, by the way, in following the action of the immutable law of pressure downwards and westwards, and the enforced migration of tribes incident thereto, is the discovery that the ethnic capital of Hyrcania, which gave its \"wolf's\" name\u00b2 to the old kingdom itself, should have been left so far behind, in the redistribution of boundaries, that its primitive site was not even included in the new Hyrcania of Ptolemy's period, but remained with its archaic designation under a slightly modified form to constitute anew the nucleus, and rehabilitate on its own proper ground the veritable province of Jurj\u00e1n, under the Arabs and their successors.\n\nIf I am right in supposing that the subjoined extracts sufficiently explain themselves in the geographical sense, it remains for me only to encounter a hitherto confessed difficulty, in fixing the site of the Parthian T\u0101\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03be or Ta\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd. This task, under fairly limited concessions, presents but few difficulties. We find the army of Antiochus the Great entering Hyrcania from a vague direction towards the south, marching in irregular detachments, and, finally, appearing before an extensive open town designated by the name of Tambrax, where there was a royal palace. Antiochus then learnt that the bulk of the troops of Arsaces and many of the\n\n\u00b9 \"Erat eo tempore Arsaces, vir sicut incerte originis, ita virtutis experte.

There are no positive indications as to whether we ought to seek for the site of this position to the eastward or to the westward of the proximate asylum; but I should, *prima facie*, infer the latter, as the advance of the Seleucidan army, though starting from Hecatompyleos, seems to have penetrated Hyrcania by the pass of Fir\u00fazkoh, and to have found itself in the ordinary course impinging upon a wealthy city somewhere between Amol and S\u00e1ri, at a point not far removed from the modern Barfarosh. A locality which must always have presented natural advantages, calculated to recommend it for the seat of a commercial capital, a title it fully regained in later days by its own unaided merits, altogether in default of royal patronage; as we find Jonas Hanway, in 1743, designating it as \"the capital of the province\"; and Forster, in 1784, equally recognizing it without question as \"the capital.\" We must remember that between the time of Alexander's appearance in these parts and the Parthian occupation there had been a change in the manners and customs of the dominant race; and whereas the Iranian dwellers in cities had established their regal domicile within the entrenchments of a strong place, the nomads of the north, on the other hand, kept their camps in the open. City walls would have ill suited a race who were wont, in the fullest sense of the term, to live on horseback.\n\nThey possibly built a palace for their king, and distributed\n\n---\n\n1 The commercial centre of Hyrcania, on the proximate modern site, is thus described by B. Fraser:\u2014\"The rich and extensive plain in which Bardarosh is placed, affording very considerable supplies of those articles produced in Mazandaran, constitutes this spot a mart for these commodities; besides which, it is centrically placed in regard to Kasvin, Tebr\u00e1n, Shahrood, and the interior of Persia (being near two principal passes through the Elburz), as well as to Rosht, the capital of Ghil\u00e1n, also a place of very extensive trade. . . . The whole town is built in and surrounded by a forest of high trees; and none of the streets being straight, there is no one spot from whence a spectator can see to any distance. The buildings are indeed so screened and separated by foliage, that except when passing through the Bazars a stranger would never suspect that he was in the midst of a populous city.\"\u2014B. Fraser, Caspian, p. 53.\n\n2 \"Equis omni tempore victoribus: illis bella, illis convivia, illis publicae ac privatae officinae obiunt,\" super illos ire, consistere, mercurari, colloqui.\"\u2014Justin, xli. 3.\ntheir model light horse amid suitable pastures, more or less closely around the fixed rallying point. In such a state of society their dwelling places necessarily left but little sign or record behind them beyond the ashes of the camp fires or the impress of the horses' hoofs, and we might seek in vain for any permanent testimony of their passage through far more settled lands. I am, however, content to leave the exact position of Tambrax only approximately determined, because I am under the impression that the name itself simply expresses the Royal head-quarters, or the capital for the time being, in Hyrcania. The word, in effect, seems to constitute a quaintly-devised Greek form of the abbreviated name of the province of Tabarist\u00e1n, consistently corresponding with the undefined \u1f51\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 of Ptolemy, the Hyrcans of Ammianus Marcellinus,\u00b9 and thus explaining the retention of the previous designation of \u03a4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03be (a variant of Tambrax), in Strabo's text, where the easily-moved capital is stated to have been established [temporarily] at \u03a4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7\u03bd.\n\nThe custom of indicating the province at large, in general terms, without necessarily confining the seat of the ruling power to any given city within its boundaries, is seen to have survived and descended to the later coinage, where we meet with nothing in the entire Pehlvi series but the generic expression of Tabarist\u00e1n.\n\nIt is pleasant, however, amid the coarse savagery of these northern hordes, to find them perpetuating, ex voto, the name of their founder, Arsaces, so that it became a more enduring title than many others of higher and more established pretensions.\u00b2 Singular to say, under apparently identical motives, they retained the typical monogram of Tambrax \u039b\u0391, \u2014which has suggested the present inquiry\u2014as one of their\n\n\u00b9 \"Hic annes duo pervulgati sunt nomina, Oxus et Maxera, quos urgente inedia superantes natatu aliquoties tigres, improvviso finitima populantur.

It appears and re-appears in the later coinages, as a nearly immutable constituent of the national heraldic device; wherever the rough camp coining machinery penetrated with the oft-times ephemeral hold of the conquerors, this ancient memorial of the second abiding place of the Arsacid\u00e9, the territorial emblem of the first stage between Caterans and Kings, held its position: and, in the end, only fades out of Numismatic ken, when the more definite strung Bow, the pride of the ancient Parthians, is merged amid the chaotic lines of die-engravers, who servilely copied a device whose import they did not seek to comprehend.\n\nI have now to present in detail the data adverted to in previous pages regarding the geographical mutations of the primeval Tabaristan, the classic Hyrcania, which in modern times is known by the name of \"M\u00e1zander\u00e1n.\" These contributions to the previous history of the land range themselves under the following heads:\n\nI.

His longitudes are, of course, utterly worthless, and his latitudes to be received with extreme caution. Still, there is in the Greek text a curious vitality and rehabilitation, under due allowance for transmutation of speech, of the Eastern world as existing in his day. Nothing could be more striking than the number of Aryan names of places that we can recognize and restore amid the seemingly unintelligible lists of the Western compiler. But these are temptations which I may safely abandon to M. Piettet, and confine myself to the narrow limits of the Royal cities. The once established capital Tambrax I have already sufficiently adverted to, but those who are indisposed to see so violent a transformation from the generic designation of the \"land of Axes\" must take into account the facility of the Pehlvi transmutation of \u03c1\u03c1, \u03c1\u03b2, and \u03c1\u03bd. The recognized Greek representation of \u03b2 by \u03bc\u03c0, and the Scytho-Hellenic and other local versions of m\u03b2, illustrated in the vague pro-\n\n---\n\n1 Colonel Yule has a curious note upon what he conceives to be Ptolemy's system of map-making. \"It is evident that he first drew his maps embodying all the information that he had procured, however vague and rough it might be. From these maps he then educed his tables of latitudes and longitudes, and his systematic topography. The result is that everything assumes an appearance of exact definition; and indications on the map which meant no more than 'somewhere hereabouts is said to be such and such a country,' become translated into a precision fit for an Act of Parliament.\"\u2014Cathay and the Way Thither. Hakluyt Soc. Publication, p. cli. On the other hand, we must hear what one of the most precise geographers of the present day has to say in favour of the rough system.\u2014\"Nous profitons de cette occasion pour faire observer que, tout extraordinaire que puisse para\u00eetre l'assertion que les longitudes fournies par une simple op\u00e9ration topographique puissent surpasser en exactitude celles qu'on obtient par des m\u00e9thodes astronomiques, cette assertion n'en est pas moins vraie si l'observateur n'est pas un astronome consomm\u00e9, et s'il n'a pas \u00e0 sa disposition tous les instruments de pr\u00e9cision indispensables pour obtenir des r\u00e9sultats d'une grande exactitude.\"\u2014M. de Khanikoff, Mem., p. 30.\nnunciation of Dambavend, as well as the elsewhere fatal defect of the total absence from the adapted Greek alphabet of any signs competent to reproduce the archaic sounds of ch and j. The terminal k need not any more disturb this attribution, as the final Pehlvi \u06af k is admitted to have had the force of a mere h: even if more daring identifications might not point to the interchange of the final, as in Ir\u00e1k \u0627\u0631\u0627\u0642 and Ir\u00e1n \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 (J. M\u00fcller, Journ. Asiatique, p. 15), which would reduce the ethnic term into a mere plural of Axe\u0633 \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0633, in consistent concert with the Woleses \u0648\u0648\u0644\u0633\u0647 of Hyrcania, or other simple names of places derived from nature's teaching. It remains for me merely to say that I concur in Ouseley's somewhat hesitating identification of Kara Tapah with Ptolemy's T\u0101kka, which is satisfactorily corrected in Strabo's \u03a4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b3\u03b7. \u0391\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1, as Amol, can scarcely be contested; and without\n\n1 \"He escorted us to his own village, called from its situation on a tumular piece of ground, Kerd-Tapeh or Tapeh (\u062a\u067e\u0647), the 'Black hillock,' distant from Ashraf about seven miles, and in the midst of an extensive level tract, of which the surface was now covered with water and moist clay to the depth of ten or twelve inches, but in summer formed a rich and very fertile plain. Rising above this, the Tapeh or 'mount' appeared like an island barely large enough to contain the houses that stood upon it; all light structures of wood, reeds and straw, except one emdrat, a mason-work edifice (of brick), which had been erected for the king's accommodation. . . . I had entertained some hopes of being able, in this Tapeh, to ascertain the position of Tap\u0113, which Strabo describes as the principal or royal city of Hyrkania, advantageously situate within a little distance of the sea.\"\u2014iii. 275.\n\nTwo difficulties presented themselves, however, to the traveller's mind: \"the Turkish name,\" which he did not regard as an insuperable objection, and the absence of ruins, which he rightly met by the remark that \"in the time of Strabo, the houses of this country were most probably constructed of very perishable materials, as in the tenth century after, when Ion Haukal travelled, and as they are now in the nineteenth.\"\n\nWe have seen how great a latitude is to be allowed in the transcription of native names; but the Kala Tapah is not necessarily Turkish or Scythian: the interchange of l and r was never more free than in Ptolemy's list, where we find \u03bb used in Sari and \u03c1 in Amol. \u06a9\u0627\u0644\u0627 is very good Aryan for bl\u00e6k, and \u06a9\u0644 is freely admitted into Persian Dictionaries. The Hindustani equivalents are \u06a9\u0644 and \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u064a. And as regards the possible Palace on the hillock, we must remember that among these nomad tribes the rising ground, or small mounds, as the case might be, were always selected as the natural head-quarters of the chief.\nlaying any undue emphasis upon the possible '\u0391\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1 and the resulting Ashraf, we may safely rectify the Malirka by the Persian '\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06a9', which brings us back to the snakes, whom ancients and moderns alike associated with the locality.\n\nThe rivers in their erratic courses, it must be confessed, present greater difficulties of identification; but there is one impression that forces itself to the front, that the \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 can only have been some stream more or less associated with the site of the modern designation of Nokandah; the denomination \u0646\u0648\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u062f\u06c1 implies a variation of the course of a river, either by a convulsion of nature or a diversion by human efforts from an old channel; the name\u00b9 could scarcely apply in these lands of timber towns to new foundations; and one of the most curious points in Ptolemy's version is that the \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 river itself must clearly have joined the Ma\u1e63\u1e25a before the latter reached the sea.\u00b2 Indeed it would \"almost seem as if Ptolemy's informants, whatever names they applied to the two streams, referred merely to the two most important rivers of the country, which seem to have preserved their flow to later days in the modern Ain and S\u0101ri, forming a natural junction below the town of the latter name.\"\u00b3 This, at least, is what we should be justified in assuming on the authority of the prominently marked courses of these rivers in M. Kinneir's map.\n\n\u00b9 Some might claim to read the name as \u0646\u0648\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u062f\u06c1, but I prefer to follow the Greek, in making it one combined word. More especially, as there is authority for the term \u0643\u0646\u062f\u06c1, which must necessarily refer to ancient usage, in the typical \"trench\" of King Firuz, who is reputed to have founded Amol, and whose \"big cutting\" still retains the name of \u0646\u0648\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u062f\u06c1.\u2014Ouseley, iii. p. 310.\n\n\u00b2 I am quite aware that Sir H. Rawlinson advocates the identity of the Sokanda with the \"Ab-askun of the Arabs.\" (\u0622\u0628\u200c\u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0648\u0646) aquas tranquilas.\u2014Vullers, p. 3.)\n\n\u00b3 Quintus Curtius also makes his two strangely-designated rivers of Hyrcania join each other (vi. iv. 7), and the almost fabled Zioberus, with its underground current, may have something in common with the newly excavated \"Nokandah.\"\nExtract III.

I have accepted his correction (pp. 175, 182) for No. 5, which has been greatly disfigured by other copyists. See list of variants quoted by M. De Goeje, p. 216, and Sprenger, pp. 52\u20133.\n\nThe excellent edition of Yakut's Persian Geography by M. Barbier de Meynard, aided by B. Fraser's personal narrative,\n\n\u00b9 Marhalat (day's journey).\nenables me to fill in satisfactorily the locality No. 14, which is grievously distorted in all the leading authorities. On the same principle, I should not have dared to correct Istakhri's \u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0647, etc., No. 13, into Isidore's 'Ara\u0161ak (Arsak), had not Fraser given us the true form in Ribat-i-Aishk, p. 453; and to the same inquisitive observer I owe the rehabilitation of the lost orthography of No. 12, which seems to have puzzled alike the Arabico-Persian Geographers and their modern annotators.\n\nNo. 7. The site of the wall against the Turks, described by B. Fraser (infra, p. 47), is prominently noticed by Albiruni, under a disfigured name, but in the correct locality, as the well-known old boundary between \"Tabaristan and J\u00fcrj\u00e1n.\" (Sprenger's Map, No. 6.)\n\nThe preceding Arabic list of the names of places supplies a far safer basis for the identification of obsolete native designations than the crudely transmuted and foreign Greek version.\n\n1. Amol may be doubtfully associated with the meaning of \u0627\u0645\u062d\u0644 \"clean, pure.\" 2. \u0633\u067e\u0647 is given in the Dictionaries as \"campus,\" and the ground around the site still consistently remains open to this day. 3. \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u064a seems to refer to some bastioned or fortified site, of which there were many after their degrees in these localities, even if the name might not claim to represent a small offshoot of the grand Elburz itself, which the Alexandrian geographer accepted as Bap\u0101rym. 4. S\u0101riah I have already attempted to associate with its domestic Herons. 5. \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9 obviously suggests a development of \u0645\u0627\u0631, M\u0101r, the ancient and locally cherished name for the classic Ir\u0101nian Serpent. 6. Ab\u0101d\u0101n, \"abodes,\" in the plural form, is said to have an intensive sense, as prosperity, or flourishing, in the agricultural or resident understanding of the term. 7. The Tamisah of the Sh\u0101h N\u0101mah, which the Persians call \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u0633\u0647 opens a wider range\n\n---\n\n1 Ouseley, who delighted in ancient identifications, and who had so many opportunities of tracing the old names in situ, quotes from the Tarikh-i Tabaristan a passage to the effect that \"Amul (or Amal) originally signified in the Dilami dialect the same as the Pehlvi kush \"death, destruction.\"\nof conjecture. 8. *Astarabad*, which was supposed to derive its name from the \"stars,\" has had of late to come down to a much more mundane designation, in the form of the \"abode of mules.\" *Yakut* is distinct in his assertion of \u0627\u0633\u064e\u0631 \u0627\u0645 \u0631\u062c\u0644, and the Sanskrit correspondent readily declares itself in \u092e\u0941\u0932\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0930 \"mulus,\" while all natural probabilities point to the advantages of the locality for such stud purposes, more especially in the choice of Nisean horses, to improve the home-breed of that indispensable cross of the patient and sure-footed donkey, for mountain traffic. 9. *Ribat-i-Hafs*, the Arabic designation of the next station, probably merely reproduces the native name for the \"hyena,\" who may well have disputed the gorges of the mountains with the \"wolves\" who gave their name to (10) *Gurg\u00e1n* itself. 11. The *Dindarzari* of the next stage seems to be a modern combination. 12. *Arm\u00fatali*, the orthography preserved by B. Fraser, is given with so much hesitation by that author, that it will be wise to avoid speculation upon its derivation. 13. *Ashak* is fixed alike by the Greek itinerary, and the testimony of our modern travellers, as the fountain-head of the greatness of Arsaces. 14. The name of *Samank\u00e1n* is of doubtful origin, but the old designation of (15) *Asfara\u00e1n* is good Aryan in the form of \u0645\u06cc\u0647\u0631-\u06cc\u0627\u0646, \"sun of life,\" while the new name is asserted, on the authority of Baihaki, to have been derived from the compound \"shield-bearers.\" *Asfar* (\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c2) \"a buckler,\" *Ain*, \"law, usage.\"1 (\u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2.)\n\n**Extract IV. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of B. Fraser's Route.**\n\nStarting from the extreme point eastward, with which we are at present concerned, i.e. \"Boojnoord (36\u00b0 12' 20''),\" the itinerary proceeds, \"fifteen miles to Sareev\u00e1n, Killah Kh\u00e1n (Semulgh\u00e1n).\"2 The dangerous part of the journey commences immediately on quitting this place: there is a tract\n\n---\n\n1 Barbier de Meynard, p. 35.\n2 \"I believe this is the place of Semulgh\u00e1n, which gives its name to the valley. The Fort receives its appellation from being the residence of the Kh\u00e1n.\"\u2014B. Fraser, p. 591.\nof more than ninety miles totally desert, through which various passes lead, by which the Toookom\u00e1ns ascend from their plains below, and carry their depredations into the northern provinces of Persia.\" Dehneh Derkesh (a narrow and rugged pass in the hills that divide the great Elburg range from the smaller mountains and valleys on the north), Chumman-i-Bansh Killah, (a plain of considerable extent, which is entirely desert, and sloping towards the west, opens into a still larger one, called, I think, the plain of Armootullee. Desert as it now is, there are scattered throughout it many burying-grounds, whose tombstones vouched in a dreary way for the existence of men long since passed away), Ribat-i-Aishk (\"a ruined caravanserai situated on the slope of the right hand hills, a dismal and dangerous place\"), Gurg\u00e1n river, Gurg\u00e1n (camp), Pisserue1 (near which is a large square inclosure, which had once been the stronghold of a tribe of Eels, called Gereilee, with numerous Tuppehs of former villages. The ancient city of Gurg\u00e1n (2 farasangs distant; Gumbuj-i-K\u00e1\u00fas described p. 613). Finderisk, Peechuck-Muhuleh (chief centre of a baluk). Ak Killah, \"the white fortress, numerous hillocks and mounds, certainly the remains of former forts and villages. Ak Killah itself appeared to have been an extensive square stronghold. Asterabad,2 to Khurdmuhuleh (23 miles), to Nokundeh3 (14 miles), to Ashruff\n\n1 This interesting specimen of a true forest town is thus further described. \"Instead of dull mud walls and flat mud roofs corresponding exactly with the colour of the ground, to which we had been so long accustomed, we found here everything made of wood. . . . The houses were constructed of posts, wattled and plastered with mud. . . . Instead of a wall to protect the place, a deep ditch had been dug. . . . a hedge of reeds and creeping thorns, etc. . . . on the inside served to render the defence more perfect, and it was indeed impenetrable to cavalry. The gates and portals were also constructed of wood; a wooden bridge was thrown across the ditch; the very domestic implements, instead of earthenware or metal, were here made of wood.\"\u2014B. Fraser, p. 610.\n\n2 \"The province of Astrabad differs from that of cities in the southern and more elevated provinces of Persia, as much as that of the respective surrounding countries from each other. The forest or thicket approach on every side to the very ditch; the houses are constructed chiefly of wood. There are no buildings, public or private, deserving of particular notice at Astrabad. The revenue derived from this little province does not exceed 12,000 tom\u00e1ns, or about \u00a37000 sterling.\"\n\n3 A scattered village in the forest. The houses, built \"of frames of rudely squared wood, with uprights and beams, raised upon blocks 3 feet above the ground, with a straw thatch.\"\nAt six miles from Nokundeh is seen \"the ruined wall formerly of considerable strength, and which once extended from the face of the hills to the sea, the boundary between Astrabad and Mazanderan.\"\n\n(Near Ashruff, the ruins of Sufeeabad and the large reservoir in the hills.) Kara-tappah, 7 miles N., also described.\n\nFrom Ashruff to Sar-i-pul-i-Nica (17 miles), open country, fine full stream, etc.\n\nTo Sari, 18 miles; one mile east the river Tedjen, stream broad and strong (Furrahabad, noticed) to Barfarosh, 30 miles, and onwards to Amol (22).\n\nIn addition to the description of the two coins of Tabaristan figured in the accompanying plates, I have endeavoured to complete the Pehlvi and Pehlvi-Kufic series of the Ispehbeds from all available sources. The time at my disposal does not admit of my entering upon the difficult questions of conflicting renderings of the Pehlvi legends, or the complications incident to the use of a double system of dating\u2014the one following the ordinary era of the Hijrah, the other depending\n\n---\n\n1 Sir A. Burnes's route was over much of the same ground. After Bojoonord he mentions Kila Khud, in the district of Simugan; Shahbaz village (38 miles), the source of the Gurgan river, the Atrek river, the Gumbuy-i-Kau at Gurgan, Astrabad, etc., etc. He then notices the recession of the northern waters of the Caspian (121), and adds, \"during these twelve years they have retired about 300 yards, of which I had ocular proof.\" (See also M. de Khankoff Memoire, p. 39). Sari was avoided on account of the plague, but Barfarosh and its port on the Caspian are described (123), as well as the pass of Gudoak and Piruz Koh, the real Pyke Caspiae (\"Alexander's route\"), the greatest of the passes into Mazanderan, p. 130.\n\nThe distribution of the political power in this division of the Persian empire on the eve of the Muhammadan conquest is thus described by the local historian:\n\n\"Sowaid occupa D\u00e2meghan sans coup f\u00e9ter. Les Peres s'\u00e9tant retir\u00e9s vers Gorg\u00e2n et dans le Taberistan, Sowaid quitta imm\u00e9diatement D\u00e2meghan et marcha \u00e0 leur poursuite. Il arriva \u00e0 Bastam, ville du territoire de Qumus du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Gorg\u00e2n, o\u00f9 il y \u00e9tablit son camp. Il avait \u00e0 Gorg\u00e2n une province qui comprenait la r\u00e9gion per\u00e7ue appel\u00e9e merzab\u00e2n qui r\u00e9gnait sur Gorg\u00e2n et Dihistan, et chaque ville du Taberistan avait un prince que, dans la langue du pays, on appelait ispehbed. (\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627\u062a\u0650). Tous ces princes d\u00e9pendaient du merzab\u00e2n de Gorg\u00e2n, . . . Or le prince de Gorg\u00e2n \u00e9tait Dailamite, et les ispehbeds du Taberistan \u00e9taient du Guilan, . . . [After the submission of the prince of Gurgan the narrative continues:] Lorsque les ispehbeds du Taberistan eurent connaissance de ces faits, ils vinrent trouver leur suzerain, dont ils d\u00e9pendaient tous, et qui r\u00e9sidait \u00e0 Amol, au centre de la province. C'\u00e9tait un homme puissant, un Guilanien, du nom de Feroukh\u00e2b, et que l'on appelait l'ispehbed des ispehbeds. . . Il portait aussi le nom de Gull de tous les Guilan.\"\u2014Chronique de Tabari, iii. p. 492.\nupon the local reckoning by the era of Yezdegird, commencing A.H. 32 or A.D. 651\u20132.

C. RAWLINSON, K.C.B.,\n\nPRESIDENT, IN THE CHAIR.\n\nThe following Report of the Council was read by the Secretary:\n\nThe Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, in submitting their Annual Report, are gratified in being able to show a more favourable proportion between the number of members lost during the past year, by death and retirement, and those acquired by admission, than they had it in their power to lay before the Society at the last Anniversary Meeting. The numbers of losses sustained by the Society, are 8 resident members by death; and 3 resident and 2 non-resident members by retirement, making a total of 12 contributing members removed from our list. Besides, 1 honorary, 1 corresponding, and 3 foreign members have died. The number of elections are 8 resident, and 10 non-resident\nmembers; showing a net result of actual increase, amounting to 5 contributing members.\\(^1\\)\n\nAmong the losses which the Society has sustained since the last Anniversary Meeting, there is none which will excite a deeper feeling of regret amongst the members than that of Lord Broughton, who died in July, 1869. In early life, John Cam Hobhouse was celebrated as the friend and companion of Byron, and the illustrations which he furnished to the fourth Canto of Childe Harold have taken a permanent place in the literature of our country. Very shortly, however, after the publication of this work, Mr. Hobhouse entered Parliament, and devoted himself to politics. Advocating liberal opinions of almost an extreme character, when liberalism was not much in fashion, he soon came into the front ranks, both as a debater and a statesman. He became Secretary for War in 1832, and continued to occupy a post in every Liberal administration which succeeded to power for a period of 20 years. It was during this interval that he first became actively associated with the Royal Asiatic Society. He had joined the Society as a member on its institution in 1823, and always took an interest in its proceedings, but it was not until his accession to the Presidency of the Board of Control, in 1835, that he became entrusted with a share in the direction of our affairs. For twelve years, that is from 1835 to 1841, and from 1846 to 1852, he was \"ex officio\" a Vice-Patron of our Society, and gave us on many occasions the full benefit of his support. At the last-named date, having\n\n\\(^1\\) **Elections.\u2014Resident:** J. L. Allen, Esq.; Col. W. E. Evans; Henry B. Loch, Esq.; Major Gen. C. P. Rigby; Captain R. St. John; P. I. J.

Childers, Esq.; Thomas Ogilvy, Esq.; N. Salaman, Esq. **Non-resident:** Lieut.-Col. R. N. Tronson; James Zohrab, Esq.\nbeen already raised to the Peerage, he retired from public life, and devoted his remaining years to the cultivation of that taste for letters and classical studies which had clung to him from his early youth. During this latter period of his life he republished with additions his travels in Albania, which had originally appeared on his return from the East with Byron, and also wrote five volumes of Autobiographical Memoirs, which, if they are permitted to see the light, are likely to prove of great public interest.\n\nGeneral Thomas Perronet Thompson was born at Hull on the 15th March, 1783, the eldest son of Thomas Thompson, Esq., a merchant and banker of the town, and formerly M.P. for Midhurst. He was first educated at the Hull Grammar School, under the Rev. Joseph Milner, and in 1798 he entered Queen's College, Cambridge, taking his B.A. degree in 1802, as Seventh Wrangler, and was subsequently elected to a Fellowship. In 1803 he entered the Royal Navy, and sailed as Midshipman in the Isis of 50 guns, the flag-ship of Vice-Admiral (afterwards Lord) Gambier. In 1806 he exchanged the sea for the land service, and entering the army as a second Lieutenant of the \"old 95th Rifles,\" was taken prisoner by the Spaniards with most of the force in General Whitelock's attack on Buenos Ayres in 1807.\n\nThe following year he was sent, through the influence of Mr. Wilberforce, as Governor of Sierra Leone, where he was struck with the unexpected diffusion of the Arabic language in Africa, of which he brought away several remarkable documents, but all eclipsed in point of magnitude by a letter of 39 pages, purporting to be an Address from the chiefs of the interior to the King of England, a desire to translate which appears to have first turned his mind to Oriental literature. Recalled in 1810 for his zeal in suppressing the slave trade, which secretly existed under the name of \"Apprenticeship,\" he joined the 14th Light Dragoons in Spain, and was present at the actions of Nivelle, Nire, Orthes, and Toulouse, for which he received\nthe Peninsular Medal with four clasps. He describes himself at this time as \"a man of very small baggage, consisting of something like a spare shirt and an Arabic grammar,\" which shows that in the midst of the fatigue and excitement of a campaign his Oriental studies were not neglected. In 1815, with the view of perfecting himself in them, he exchanged as a captain to the 17th Light Dragoons in India, where he applied himself earnestly to the study of Arabic under a native teacher, and in 1819 he accompanied Sir William Keir as Arabic interpreter to the expedition against the Wahabas of the Persian Gulf. Here he assisted at the reduction of Ras-al-Khyma and other places on the Arabian coast, and besides conducting an extensive Arabic correspondence, he took a prominent part in negotiating a treaty with the defeated tribes, declaring the slave trade to be piracy; the earliest declaration to that effect in point of time, though the American one reached England first.\n\nDefeated in 1820, in the expedition against the tribe of Beni Bou Ali, through the misbehaviour of the Sepoys under his command, he returned home in 1822, and commenced the literary and political career by which he is best known, writing the \"Instrument of Exchange,\" the \"Catholic State Waggon,\" the \"True Theory of Rent,\" and in 1827 his celebrated \"Catechism on the Corn Laws,\" which contained the germ of the great Anti-Corn Law League eleven years later.\n\nHe became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1828, and a member of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1829, writing a number of musical, mathematical, and political essays, which appeared chiefly in the \"Westminster Review,\" and were afterwards collected in six volumes under the title of \"Exercises.\"\n\nElected M.P. for Hull in 1835, and for Bradford in 1847 and 1857, General Thompson exerted himself vigorously in the latter year, with tongue and pen, to defend the East India Company, when threatened with abolition, and the Sepoy\nmutineers, when punished after defeat with what he considered to be undue severity.\n\nPromoted to an unattached Lieutenant-Colonelcy of Infantry in 1829, he became Colonel in 1846, Major-General in 1854, Lieutenant-General in 1860, and General in 1868. In 1811 he married Anne Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Barker, of York, and died suddenly and peacefully at Blackheath on the 6th September, 1869, in his 87th year, surrounded by\u2014\n\n\"That which should accompany old age,\nAs honour, love, obedience, troops of friends.\"\n\n\"'Take him for all in all,'\" pronounces a late writer, \"few men have maintained for so long a period a reputation for unswerving devotion to the cause of the people; and there are many still engaged in active pursuits, who can recall the outspoken vigour, the relentless logic, the impulsive humanity of his public action, and the gentleness and manly kindness which marked him in private life.\"\n\nThe late Sir David Capon entered the East India Company's service as an ensign in the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of Native Infantry in 1810, and served with that regiment in the campaigns in Guzerat and the Deccan in 1813 and 1817. He commanded the troops at Aden against the Arabs in 1839, and the 1st Brigade of the Bombay Column at Mooltan in 1848-9; but his active service with the army did not prevent his paying attention to the vernacular languages, in which he became an accomplished scholar, receiving the thanks of the Government for his translations of General Orders and other military works, and being constantly employed as a member of the Examination Committees. He was naturally of a modest and retiring disposition, and his studies never having led him in the direction of those pursuits which mostly engage the attention of this Society and its branches, he never joined us until he retired from active service in 1850; but as a distinguished soldier and one who\nturned his acquaintance with Oriental languages to good account in his profession, he deservedly attracts our notice.\n\nHis translation into Mahratta of Capt. Grant-Duff's History of the Mahrattas has become a standard work in the vernacular literature of India, and has done much to encourage historical composition among the natives.\n\nKarl Friedrich Neumann was born in 1793 at Reichmannsdorf, a village near Bamberg in Bavaria, where his parents, who were of the Jewish persuasion, lived on the proceeds of a small shop. After receiving his first instruction in the Talmud from Rabbis at Bamberg and F\u00fcrth, the boy proceeded to Frankfurt-on-Main, where he was educated at his uncle's expense, and subsequently entered a merchant's office. Dissatisfied, however, with this mode of life, he privately continued with great perseverance his classical and general studies, and in 1817, having sufficiently prepared himself for the University, he matriculated at Heidelberg. Here, with the assistance of academical teachers, such as Creuzer and Voss, he earnestly applied himself to philological studies, profiting at the same time by Hegel's philosophical lectures. In 1818 he proceeded to Munich, where, after one year's study in Thiersch's philological seminary, he passed his public examination, having previously embraced the Lutheran faith. A small scholarship, which was granted him thereupon, enabled the student to finish his academical education by a year's residence at G\u00f6ttingen, where in those days historical studies flourished under such men as Heeren, the two Eichhorns, and Bouterwek. It was here that he published his first work, entitled \"Rerum Creticarum Specimen.\" After his return to Bavaria, he for several years held appointments in public schools at W\u00fcrzburg, Aschaffenburg, and Speier, contributing at the same time to the \"Heidelberger Jahrb\u00fccher.\" Being, however, suddenly suspended in 1825, on account of his free-thinking tendencies, he returned to Munich, and for some time maintained himself by contributing to periodicals, especially\nto the \"Hermes\" and to the \"Literarische Conversationsblatt,\" published by Brockhaus, at Leipzig. Most of these articles were highly valued at the time, and are not considered antiquated even now. By the advice of the palaeographer, Ulrich Kopp, he proceeded to Venice in 1827, in order to acquire the Armenian language from natives of the country who resided there, and having met with a kind reception in the Mechitarist monastery in the island of San Lazaro, he acquired a thorough knowledge of Armenian from the younger Afghien, called Padre Pasquale, who had formerly instructed Byron in that language. The following year he returned to Munich with a complete Armenian library, having been previously created a member of the Armenian Academy in San Lazaro; and soon after he went on to Paris, in order to become acquainted with the great French Orientalists of those days, Abel R\u00e9musat, Klaproth, and Saint Martin. During his stay in Paris, a paper by him was published in the \"Journal Asiatique,\" entitled \"M\u00e9moire sur la vie et les ouvrages de David, philosophe Arm\u00e9nien du cinqui\u00e8me si\u00e8cle de notre \u00e8re.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1829 we find him in London, a frequent visitor at the meetings of the Royal Asiatic Society, and entrusted by the Oriental Translation Fund with a translation from the Armenian of the \"History of Vartan, and the Battle of the Armenians,\" by Bishop Elis\u00e6us. The following year, being offered a free passage on board the Sir David Scott, he started for China, where, during a few months' residence, he managed to gain a certain acquaintance with the language of the country, and where he also succeeded in collecting upwards of 12,000 Chinese books, a portion of which, about 2,400 volumes, he was commissioned by the Prussian Government to buy for the Royal Library in Berlin.\n\nOn his return to England, he published for the Oriental Translation Fund three works, which he had translated during his passage, from the Armenian and Chinese: \"Vahram's Chronicle of the Armenian Kingdom in Cilicia;\" \"The Cate-\nchism of the Shamans,\" and \"The History of the Chinese Pirates.\"\n\nHis entire collection of books, amounting to 10,000 volumes, was presented by him to the Royal Library at Munich; and the Bavarian Government, in acknowledgment of this service, appointed him \"Conservator\" of the Chinese collections, and Professor of Chinese and Armenian in the University of Munich, in 1832. In addition to his professorial lectures on Oriental languages and literature, he now began to deliver a series of lectures on Universal History, and on Modern German History since the Congress of Vienna, which in a short time gathered around him a numerous auditory from all parts of Germany. At the same time he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Berlin Academy, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe following is a list of the principal works published by the Professor during this period of his life: \"History of the Emigration of 40,000 Armenians,\" Leipzig, 1834; \"Attempt at a History of the Armenian Literature,\" 1836; \"Chinese Chrestomathy\" (Lehrsaal des Mittelreichs), Munich, 1836; \"Asiatic Studies,\" Leipzig, 1837; \"Natural and Religious Philosophy of the Chinese,\" 1837; \"Additions and Corrections to B\u00fcrck's Translation of Marco Polo's Travels,\" 1845; \"Mexico in the fifth century of our era, from Chinese sources,\" 1845; \"History of the Anglo-Chinese War, 1846\" (2nd ed. 1855). He also edited G\u00fctzlaff's \"History of the Chinese Empire,\" at Stuttgart, in 1847.\n\nIn 1837 he married the daughter of his colleague, Dr. Schmidtm\u00fcller, professor of medicine. Though his liberal tendencies and strong patriotic feelings did not allow him to keep altogether aloof from the revolutionary movement of the day, he avoided, at first, taking any prominent part in it. Ultimately, the disappointment which he felt at its results found an echo in his lectures on Modern German History, and this caused his suspension in 1852.\nBeing henceforth almost wholly dependent on his pen for his livelihood, he contributed during the following years many valuable essays to Raumer's \"Historical Almanack,\" such as \"The Tragedy in Afghanistan,\" and \"The Sikhs and their Empire\" (1852); \"Persia since the time of the Safi\" (1855). In the \"Gegenwart,\" published by Brockhaus, he also wrote: \"China and its dependent countries;\" \"Mexico and Central America, and their commercial position;\" \"The English and Russians in Persia and Central Asia,\" etc.\n\nAfter another stay of some months in England, he began writing his \"History of the British Rule in Asia,\" which was published in two volumes, at Leipzig, 1857. Two years later he edited from a Heidelberg MS., \"The Travels of Johannes Schiltberger in Europe, Asia, and Africa, during the years 1394 to 1427.\" In 1861 his \"History of Eastern Asia from the first Chinese War to the Treaties of Peking,\" came out at Leipzig.\n\nThe intrigues of his political enemies at last induced him to leave Bavaria, and settle at Berlin in 1863, where he composed his \"History of the United States of North America,\" in three vols. (Berlin, 1863-66); and also published several essays in Oppenheim's \"German Political and Literary Almanack.\" Already new plans began to occupy the attention of this indefatigable scholar, such as a history of the civil war in America, of the Russian rule in Asia, and similar works, when he was suddenly seized by an apoplectic fit in April, 1867, which deprived him for ever of his intellectual powers. After a life of wonderful labour and the most successful results in various branches of Oriental and historical research, this venerable scholar died in March last, honoured and beloved by all who knew him.\n\nIn proceeding to give a brief account of the progress made by the Society during the past twelvemonth, in Oriental literature and research, the Council feel justified in pointing\nwith some satisfaction to the last number of the Society's Journal, published in January last, which they venture to think deserves high commendation in regard both to the variety and scientific value of its contents.\n\nThey have also much pleasure in stating that not a few highly interesting papers have been contributed to the Society's meetings during that period, and that most of them have been deemed worthy to be incorporated in the forthcoming number, which they hope will be ready at the beginning of Autumn.\n\nIn Mr. C. E. Gover, of Madras, the Society has gained a most valuable and zealous contributor, no less than two papers from his pen having been read within the last four months, both of which manifest a close observation and careful study of the manners of the non-Brahmanic part of the population of Southern India. The first of Mr. Gover's papers gives us a spirited and interesting account of the Pongol festival, which he maintains to be a remnant of primitive Aryan life in India, before Brahmanical refinements and the distinction of caste had corrupted the social aspects of Hinduism, and when the deities worshipped were the same as those invoked in the Vedic hymns, especially Indra, Agni, and S\u00fbrya. Although this attempted identification of an Aryan festival among a race, which, as far as language is concerned, is essentially non-Aryan, may have surprised many members of this Society, still the Council cannot but acknowledge that Mr. Gover has argued his point well, and they desire accordingly to express how deeply interested they feel in his further investigations of the origin and manners of a race, of which we possess as yet so little trustworthy information.\n\nThe second contribution of the same writer is an account of the moral condition and religious views of the lower classes in Southern India, chiefly based on a large collection of popular songs in the ancient Canarese, of which he has given specimens in a poetical, but still pretty close English\ntranslation. Of several of these songs, it is true, a German translation (together with the Canarese text and a grammatical analysis) had already been published in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, vols. 14 and 18, by Dr. M\u00f6gling, a Missionary, formerly resident in the Canarese country; but this would hardly seem to detract from the value of Mr. Gover's paper, which, on account both of its suggestive nature and the additional matter which it embodies, will no doubt be acceptable to the members of this Society.\n\nAt an evening meeting held in March last, the Rev. S. Beal gave a lecture on the Symbolism of the Sculptures of the S\u00e2nci Tope, which was attended by our leading authorities on the subject of Buddhist antiquities.\n\nThe most important point of Mr. Beal's argument was his identification of the Sculptures on the lower architrave of the Northern Gate of that Tope, with scenes in the Vessantara J\u00e2taka, or account of Bodhisatva's last appearance on earth previous to his birth as S\u00e2kya. As Mr. Fergusson and General Cunningham agree in placing these bas-reliefs in the earlier half of the first century after Christ, Mr. Beal's identification will perhaps enable us more nearly to settle the date of the Buddhistic J\u00e2takas; while it also affords another proof of the importance of a minute study of architectural remains in India, for a true appreciation of the history and literature of the Hindus.\n\nTo Professor J. Dowson the Society is likewise indebted for two papers, one of which, containing an interpretation of, and remarks on, a Bactrian Pali Inscription, discovered some time since near Bh\u00e2valpur by the Rev. G. Yeates, and communicated to the Society by Captain F. W. Stubbs, has already been published in the last number of the Society's Journal. This inscription clearly proves that the system of notation adopted by the learned Professor in his previous paper \"on the\n\n---\n\n1 A few of them were also rendered into English by the Revds. W. Sanderson and J. Greenwood, and printed in \"The Harvest Field,\" a paper formerly published in Bangalore, but now extinct.\nfortunately unrepresented on the occasion in question, but we have not been the less interested in the successful termination of a work which, whatever may be its present political bearing, or its future financial prospects, must undoubtedly greatly promote the intercourse between Europe and India, and thus tend to the increasing development of the exhaustless resources of the East.\n\nThe only other point to which I feel inclined to refer is the mission about to be despatched, by the Viceroy of India, to the Chieftain who has recently established an independent sovereignty in Kashgar and Yarkend, and who is our next neighbour across the Himalaya and beyond the Thibetan dependencies of Cashmere. The Society cannot but feel intensely interested in the success of this expedition into Central Asia. There is no reason to anticipate that Mr. Forsyth's mission will encounter any great difficulty or danger, since Messrs. Shaw and Hayward, who have recently returned in safety from the same country, have already tested both the practicability of the route and the good feeling of the Governor; but in regions so rarely visited our officers will necessarily gain much novel experience. There are many matters indeed connected with the Geography, the Ethnology, and the Literature of Chinese Turkestan, on which information is greatly needed; and we may thus hope that the visit of this mission to the court of the Ataligh Ghazi will be fruitful in discovery, and will, in fact, so to speak, open up a new page in our knowledge of the East. The papers of Messrs. Shaw and Hayward, which have been already published, are of extreme value, and only render us the more anxious for further details.\n\nFinally, I would strongly impress upon the Fellows of this Society the necessity of sustained exertion in two directions: firstly, in obtaining the pecuniary means, of which we stand so greatly in need, for the due extension of our means of usefulness, by inducing fresh subscribers to join our ranks; and, secondly, in arousing that literary spirit and power,\nwhich undoubtedly our members possess, but which requires to be called into activity in order to enable us to hold our place amongst the Orientalists of Europe, and to transmit to our successors that high reputation for learning and research which we have inherited from such scholars as Wilson, as Colebrooke, as Sir Wm. Jones.\n\nIn conclusion, Sir Henry read the following list of Oriental Works of importance which have been published during the past year:\n\n**Sanscrit:** Dr. J. Muir's Original Sanskrit Texts, vol. V.; Prof. Max M\u00fcller's Translation of the Rig-veda, vol.

BAILLIE, Auditors for the Society.\n\nHENRY LEWIS,\nOPENING ADDRESS OF THE SESSION\n\n1870-71.\n\nAt the opening Meeting of the Society, on November 21st, 1870, Sir H. Rawlinson delivered the following introductory address:\n\nAs this is the opening meeting of the Session, it may be convenient that I should offer a few remarks in continuation of my address at the last Anniversary Meeting, with a view of reporting briefly on such matters of interest to us as have occurred during the recess, and thus keeping you au courant as to the present state of Oriental study and research.\n\nTo commence then with the subject which chiefly occupied my attention on the last occasion, our literary proceedings at the India Office\u2014I may note that in the work of cataloguing the MSS. of our Library, we are making steady and satisfactory progress, while we are also receiving the most valuable additions to our already large stock of materials. Mr. Burnell, whose collection of Sanscrit MSS. I stated that we hoped to obtain, has deposited his treasures on the shelves of our Library, thus offering a noble example of scholarly assiduity on the one side, and of disinterested public spirit on the other. This collection numbers about 350 volumes, and is particularly rich in the Vedic department. Indeed, I see by the Catalogue he has published, that there are no less than 230 MSS. referring to the Vedas and Upanishads. We have also received, from H.H. the Viceroy of Egypt, about 200 Arabic volumes printed in Cairo, including standard historical works like Ibn Khaldun and El Makkari, and others of almost an equally high character. In return for these, we shall pre-\npresent His Highness with copies of such Arabic works as have been printed in India.\n\nA further subject of congratulation is the appointment of General A. Cunningham to superintend the Archaeological Survey of India. The Government of India, having resolved to take in hand a work of this magnitude and importance, has been very fortunate in securing the services of one of the very few officers\u2014if not the only officer\u2014who is thoroughly competent to conduct the survey. General Cunningham will leave for India at the beginning of next month, and will proceed at once to take charge of the Central Office, where he will organize an efficient staff to assist him in exploring the antiquities of India, in copying inscriptions, excavating ruins, taking plans of ancient buildings, and in the various other operations connected with his laborious but most interesting duty.\n\nIn connexion with this subject, I may further observe that the Elliot marbles have been at length rescued from the obscurity that has been so much deplored, and are now carefully arranged in the Central Court of the India Office, where they invite the inspection of the curious. I need hardly remind the meeting that these are the original marbles of the Amravati Temple, the photographs of which have been so largely and advantageously employed for the illustration of Mr. Fergusson's late work on Tree and Serpent Worship.\n\nLieutenant Cole's cast of the Eastern gateway at the Sanchi Tope, is also, I understand, in the course of erection at South Kensington, and the Science and Art Department of the Government are making arrangements for a further supply of architectural casts, both from Agra and Futtehpoor Sikri, and from the Colonnade of the Kutb Min\u00e1r at Delhi.\n\nI may now say a few words on the various Oriental publications which have appeared during the recess, or which are known to be in a forward state of publication.\nIn the Sanscrit department, Mr. Griffiths, of Benares, is employed in translating into English verse V\u00e1lmiki's poem of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, and the first volume of his translation has already appeared.\n\nMessrs. West and B\u00fchler have also completed the second volume of their Digest of Muhammadan Law, and R\u00e1jendral\u00e1l Mitra has published a portion of his Catalogue of Sanscrit MSS., the first result of the search for such materials in Bengal.\n\nMr. J. Burgess, of Bombay, has likewise issued a Memorandum on the survey of the Architectural and other Archaeological remains of Western India, which contains much valuable information; and I may conclude this branch of the subject by drawing attention to two other works, which are announced for publication: one is Mr. J. Beames's \"Comparative Grammar of the modern Aryan Languages of India,\" and the other is General Cunningham's \"Geography of Ancient India,\" the result of thirty years of patient study and research.\n\nIn the P\u00e1li branch, the chief activity has been shown in Ceylon, where the Government, in the first place, has directed an Archaeological Survey of the Island to be undertaken by Mr. Davids, assisted by a competent staff; and where Mr. James D'Alwis is compiling (also under the orders and at the expense of the Government) a complete Catalogue of all the Buddhistic MSS. in the Island. The first volume of this Catalogue is about to be published.\n\nIt is further worthy of notice that the King of Burmah has presented to the Ceylon Government a complete set of the Buddhistic Scriptures, His Majesty being a great patron of Buddhistic studies in his own country, and having printed a P\u00e1li Grammar written by himself.\n\nThe last number, also, of the Journal of the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, should be noticed as of great interest to P\u00e1li Students.\n\nIn the Chinese department, attention should be drawn to\nthe \"Phoenix,\" which is a new Monthly Magazine for China, Japan, and Eastern Asia, conducted by the Rev. Mr. Summers, and which promises to be very useful. Mr. Stanislas Julien has also brought out the second volume of his \"Syntaxe Nouvelle de la langue Chinoise,\" and Mons. Paul Perny has published his \"Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais-Latin-Chinois de la langue Mandarine parl\u00e9e,\" to be followed by a Grammar of the same tongue; while Sir John Davis has given us a Second Edition of his \"Poetry of the Chinese,\" with some additions and improvements.\n\nIn Semitic Literature, the following works are chiefly deserving of notice:\u20141. The sixth part of the Kamil of E. Mubarrad, published by Dr. Wright; 2. A translation of the Fihrist of the famous Nedim, which is being printed from the late Professor Fl\u00fcgel's MS.; 3. Catalogues of the Syriac and Arabic MSS. in the British Museum, compiled respectively by Drs. Wright and Rieu, and now in the Press; and 4. The Diwans of the six ancient Arabic Poets, En-Nabiqa, Antara, Tarafa, Zoheir, Alqama, and Amrulqeis, just published by Prof. Ahlwardt. Our own Oriental Translation Fund, which has still a small sum in deposit, has also made arrangements with two very competent scholars for two important publications. Mons. Zotenberg, who has done us the honour of assisting at this meeting, is employed on a translation of Tabari, independently of the version which was commenced by Dubeux many years ago; and Professor Sachau is to supply an English version of Ab\u00fa Rih\u00e1n's famous work entitled the Ath\u00e1r-el-B\u00e1kiya\u2014a copy which was made for me, from a very ancient and correct exemplar, in the Library of the King's Mosque at Teheran, having been entrusted to him for the purpose.\n\nBut while I announce to the meeting these various subjects of congratulation, I am bound to say that in some other respects we have not been so successful\u2014that the expectations, indeed, which I held out in my address of last May have, in some cases, not been realized.\nIn the first place, considerations of economy have decided the Trustees of the British Museum against applying for Government assistance to enable us to resume excavations in Assyria and Babylonia; and as it is very doubtful whether sufficient private funds could be obtained for the purpose, the scheme may be considered to be adjourned sine die. Secondly, the adventurous traveller Mr. Hayward\u2014from whose exploration of the Panier Steppes I anticipated important results\u2014has, I deeply regret to say, been foully murdered on the threshold of the new field he was about to enter. And thirdly, Mr. Forsyth, to whom I also referred in my last address as engaged on a Mission to Central Asia, full of interest to the Geographer, the Politician, and the Historical inquirer, has been obliged to return from Yarkend, after a very brief sojourn, without seeing the Governor of the country, or carrying out the chief objects of his journey.\n\nThe onward progress of Oriental research will not, however, be seriously impeded by such mishaps. Let us at any rate, as Members of the Royal Asiatic Society, do our duty to each other, and to the good cause to which we are devoted. Let us cordially welcome our fellow-labourers in the field, whenever, as at present, they do us the honour to attend our meetings; and let us one and all, both by contributing papers and by exertions amongst our friends, do our utmost to maintain the reputation of the Journal, and increase the numbers and resources of our Society. The Session of 1870\u201371 is now formally opened.\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE FORTY-EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY MEETING OF THE SOCIETY,\n\nHeld on the 15th May, 1871,\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL SIR H. C. RAWLINSON, K.C.B.,\n\nPRESIDENT, IN THE CHAIR.\n\nThe following Report was read by the Secretary:\n\nIn presenting, as is usual on this occasion, their Report on the proceedings of the Society during the last twelvemonth, the Council, though unable to show any material improvement in the number of subscribers, have some satisfaction in stating that there has been, at least, a slight increase of members during that period. The number of elections since the last Anniversary Meeting are eight resident and five non-resident members; whilst the losses, by death and retirement, amount to seven resident and two non-resident members; showing an increase of one resident and three non-resident members.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Elections.\u2014Resident: Major H. H. Godwin Austen; G. Branson, Esq.; L. Bowring, Esq.; R. N. Cust, Esq.; Capt. A. F. P. Harcourt; Dr. R. S. Mair; Sir D. F. McLeod; Prof. J. Pickford. Non-Resident: H. F. W. Holt, Esq.; C. P. Lutchmeepathy Naidu, Esq.; Mouli Syud Imadad Ally; S. Harvey James, Esq.; Charles Grant, Esq.\n\nDeaths.\u2014Resident: J. Henderson, Esq.; Mrs. Manning; M. C. Morrison, Esq.; Sir Justin Shell. Non-Resident: Capt. M. W. Carr.\n\nRetirements.\u2014Resident: Sir F. Haliday; Col. H. A. Ouvry; Gen. C. P. Rigby. Non-Resident: W. M. Beaufort, Esq.\nIn Mrs. Charlotte Manning, daughter of the late Isaac Solly, Esq., the Society has lost a member who always evinced the liveliest interest in everything that interests this Society, and very frequently attended its meetings. In 1856, she, (then Mrs. Speir) published, \"Life in Ancient India,\" a book which combined careful study with an unusual grace of style, and stimulated many minds to an interest in Sanskrit writings. A year and a half ago she almost entirely re-wrote this work, and it appeared under the title of \"Ancient and Medi\u00e6val India,\" in an enlarged form, with the addition of much information from sources that had been only discovered in the last few years. It is remarkable for the accurate learning and the patient research which it manifests; and though Mrs. Manning was not acquainted with Sanskrit, her powers of discernment and judgment qualified her peculiarly for selecting the best authorities on the subjects that she dealt with, so that the book is very useful to the student, while her refined taste and her appreciation of the beautiful have rendered it also very attractive to the general reader.\n\nMrs. Manning was, however, not only distinguished by her literary productions. Her influence in society was of a marked kind. With a naturally keen enjoyment of social intercourse, and with very cultivated faculties, she had also a peculiar skill in drawing forth the intellectual elements, and the best qualities of those with whom she came in contact, and she took delight in bringing together minds in which she perceived points of harmony. Moreover, her ready sympathetic insight gave an extreme charm to her conversation. Her interest was strong in all original and conscientious labours in the fields of literature, science, and art. She also helped forward zealously various schemes for the improvement of education, and latterly had been occupied with efforts for the benefit of our Indian fellow-subjects, many of whom felt towards her a warm personal esteem,\nmixed with sincere gratitude. Having the habit of extracting experience from all the events and phases of life, she gladly imparted from her stores of practical wisdom to those who were attached to her, and when her counsel was asked, she usually refrained from solving the particular problem, preferring simply to place before her friend a standard of right, in the confidence that by this means the desired result would be best attained. The balance and proportion in her nature, her quiet dignity, her retiring disposition, and her thoughtful generosity and kindliness, have left a powerful impression on all who knew her, and these characteristics rested on the firm basis of a calm enlightened faith, and an unwavering allegiance to duty.\n\nAttempts have, at various times and by various means, been made on the part of the Council to induce a more numerous portion of the public to devote some of their attention to those branches of knowledge in the cultivation of which this Society, during the long course of its existence, has taken so prominent and so active a part. These endeavours, it is to be regretted, have not been hitherto as successful as might have been desired; and it cannot be denied that for many years less attention has been paid by the public at large to Oriental literature and antiquities, in this country,\u2014close as its connexion is with the East\u2014than has been paid on the Continent. The Council do not, however, despair of yet succeeding, by their earnest and unremitting labours, in promoting a livelier interest in, and a more accurate appreciation of, the results of Oriental research; and they earnestly appeal to those who participate in such pursuits for their hearty co-operation in popularizing the objects of this institution and increasing the list of its supporters. They cannot, on the other hand, lose sight of the consideration that it is mainly by the intrinsic merits and scientific value of its publications that this Society can\nexpect to retain that high position in Oriental literary and antiquarian research to which it has hitherto been so justly entitled. That nothing has been wanting in this respect during the preceding year, the Council confidently trust, is amply proved by the contents of the last number of the Society's Journal, published at the beginning of the present year. Although there has not perhaps been so large a supply of papers as the Council could have wished to select from for publication in the next number, which is now printing, still the meetings of the Society have never been entirely without communications of interest. Of these, some have already appeared in the Journal, viz., General Cunningham's Mathura Pali Inscriptions, with Professor Dowson's translation and remarks; Mr. A. Wylie's highly interesting account of the Buddhist Inscription at Keuyung kwan, in six different alphabets, and including a specimen in the Neuchih language; and Mr. C. P. Brown's account of the origin and chief tenets of the Jangams or Lingavats.\n\nTo Professor J. Pickford and Mr. C. E. Gover the Society has been indebted for papers attempting to establish a radical connexion between the Dravidian and Aryan groups of languages.\n\nA second paper contributed by Mr. Gover contains a collection of popular songs translated from the Badaga tongue, with remarks on them; this paper being a continuation of a former essay on Canarese popular songs, by the same writer, noticed in last year's report. The songs now communicated are equally interesting and poetical with the Canarese songs, most of which had already been published\u2014the text with a German translation and grammatical analysis\u2014by Dr. M\u00f6gling. We must, however, regret that Mr. Gover has not chosen to give, along with his translation, the original text, which would have been a welcome addition to our knowledge of Dravidian literature.\nAt a recent meeting, Professor Chenery read a paper on a Manuscript in the Bodleian Library, containing a Hebrew translation, or imitation, of the first twenty-six Mak\u00e1m\u00e1t of El-Hariri, by Judah ben Solomon, called Alcharizi, the author of the Tachkemoni.\n\nThe work which Professor Chenery is now publishing consists, like the Tachkemoni, of rhymed prose and of verse modelled on Arabic metres, the phrases of the Koran and the references to Arabic history and legend being replaced by phrases of the Bible and allusions to Biblical incidents. The author was born at Xeres in Spain, and flourished in the early part of the thirteenth century.\n\nA specimen of the \u00c1di Granth of the Sikhs in the original text, with a translation and critical notes, has been communicated by Dr. E. Trumpp, who is now engaged in translating that important work, at the expense of the British Government.\n\nAt an evening meeting held on February 6th last, Dr. C. D. Ginsburg, before a very numerous attendance, delivered a lecture on the Moabite Inscription, in which he placed before the Society the latest results of his study of the Dibon document. Our learned President, on the same occasion, showed how the historical inferences drawn from the Moabite stone were entirely borne out by the Assyrian Annals recorded on the black obelisk from Nimrud, now in the British Museum, which was a monument of nearly the same age as the Dibon monolith. Sir Henry also stated that the Moabite war, as described on that document, must have taken place from B.C. 849 to about 846, as appeared from the Assyrian Canon, the chronology of which was fixed by the record it contained of the great solar eclipse at Nineveh on June 15, B.C. 763.\n\nCaptain Burton, further, has communicated a collection of Syrian proverbs, with a translation and remarks; Mr. W. F. Mayers, a paper on the introduction of maize into China, with an introductory note by Dr. D. F. Hance.\nMr. R. C. Childers has read, at a recent meeting, remarks by him on some passages of the Dhammapada, with special reference to the question of Nirv\u00e2na, and in support of his view that Nirv\u00e2na is a state of blissful freedom from human passion on earth, followed by annihilation after death. He also submitted to the meeting an able paper by L. Comrilla Vijasinha Mudliar, a native of Ceylon, dealing with the origin of the Arthakath\u00e2s, or commentaries on the Buddhist scriptures. Both these papers, as likewise those of Dr. Trumpp and Captain Burton, will be incorporated in the next number of the Society's Journal, which will also contain the continuation of Dr. H. Kern's translation of the Brhat-Sanhita, of Lord Stanley of Alderley's Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan and Mr. H. F. Talbot's Assyrian Glossary.\n\nThe Council have to acknowledge, with their cordial thanks, the receipt of a number of valuable additions to the Society's library, consisting partly of Transactions of learned Societies in England and abroad, partly of works presented by their authors or other patrons of the Society.\n\nFrom the Bombay Government the Society has received a copy of the Poems of Tuk\u00e2r\u00e2ma; from M. J. Oppert, his Inscriptions de Dour Sarkayan; from Syed Ahmed Khan, his Essays on the Life of Muhammed; from Pandit Gorinda Deva Sastri, his edition of the B\u00e2lar\u00e2m\u00e2yana; from Dr. G. K. Niemann, his Bloemlezing uit Maleische Geschriften; from the Rev. J. Kessler, his Introduction to the language of Madagaskar. To Lady Elliot we are indebted for Vol. III. of the late Sir H. M. Elliot's History of India, edited by Professor J. Dowson; to Mdme. Dora d'Istria, for copies of her Filetia et Arbenor\u00e9 and Etudes Indiennes; to M. Garcin de Tassy, for Vol. II. of his Histoire de la Litt\u00e9rature Hindouie et Hindostanie; to Mr. E. Thomas, for his Chronicles of the Path\u00e2n Kings of Dehli; to Mr. C. Grant, for his Central Provinces Gazetteer; to Mr. Lepel H. Griffin, for his Rajahs of the Punjab. Mr. E. H. Palmer has\npresented a copy of his Catalogue of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish MSS. of Trinity College, Cambridge; Professor A. Weber, his treatise on the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. From the Trustees of the British Museum has been received a copy of Dr. Wright's Catalogue of Syriac MSS.; from the Academy of Leiden, Vol. III. of Professor Land's Anecdota Syriaca; from the Batavian Society, a number of copies of Kawi Copperplate Inscriptions.\n\nTo Captain S. B. Miles, Assistant-Resident at Aden, the Society is again indebted for a very valuable donation, consisting of an Himyaritic bronze tablet, an alabaster sepulchral slab with a bas-relief figure and Himyaritic characters; a silver talisman or seal, likewise with Himyaritic letters engraved on it; a small brass figure supposed to be a Himyarite god, from its having been dug up at Mareb; two Ethiopic gold coins, and finally, two Himyaric coins, a silver and a gold one, the first hitherto discovered.\n\nIn now proceeding to take a brief and necessarily superficial survey of the labours of Oriental scholars during the preceding twelvemonth, the Council need scarcely observe that the disturbed state of the Continent since the middle of last year could not but have occasioned a serious decrease of publications in this, as indeed in every branch of literary and scientific research. The publications of our own Translation Committee have had to suffer a delay for the same reason, M. De Slane having been prevented from issuing the fourth and last volume of his English translation of Ibn Khallikan's important Biographical Dictionary, while M. Zotenberg has been compelled to suspend the printing of the third volume of his French translation of Tabari.\n\nAs, after the completion of the latter work, which will consist of four volumes, a sufficiently large sum will still remain at the disposal of the Committee, they have entered into an engagement with Prof. E. Sachau for an English translation of Albiruni's highly important work Al'd\u0101th\u0101r\nAlbdkiya, which it is anticipated will be ready for the press in the latter part of next year.\n\nA rare example of what true devotion to science may work, even in the midst of the chaos of war, has been shown by one of our foreign members, M. Garcin de Tassy, who has found it possible to go on with the publication of the second edition of his History of Hindi and Hindustani literature, two volumes of which have appeared, containing a vast amount of new and highly useful matter. Nor has that scholar allowed himself to be prevented from issuing his annual Discours d'ouverture, though not on this occasion from his professorial chair in the French capital, but from the quiet seclusion of a provincial town.\n\nNorthern Indian Vernacular philology has also, as usual, received some attention in last year's Journal and Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, in B\u00e1b\u00fa Prat\u00e1pachandra Ghosha's Contributions towards Vernacular Lexicography, and in short Kashmiri and Gondi vocabularies by Dr. W. J. Elmslie and the Rev. J. Dawson. With regard to the Ury\u0101, the language of Orissa, there has been some variance of opinion: B\u00e1b\u00fa K\u0101ntichandra, to some extent backed by B\u00e1b\u00fa R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra, contending that it is a sort of dialect of the Bengali, whilst Mr. J. Beames takes it to be, like the Bengali, an independent neo-Aryan language.\n\nDr. E. Trumpp's labours in translating, for the Indian Government, the \u0100di Granth, have already been adverted to; it may further be mentioned that he is now printing, likewise at the expense of the Indian Government, a Grammar of the Sindhi, as compared with the North-Indian vernaculars. The first part of a compilation by Janamejaya Mitra, entitled Nuskh\u0101 i dilkush\u0101, containing notices and selections from the works of 380 Urdu poets, was printed as long back as 1854, but has only lately been published, after the compiler's death, by his son, B\u00e1b\u00fa R\u0101jendra. A volume of Hindi Selections has also been printed by \u015aivopras\u0101da. Under the\npatronage of the Bombay Government, the first of two volumes which are to contain a complete collection of the Abhangas, or songs of the M\u0101r\u0101th\u012b poet Tuk\u0101r\u0101ma, who appears to have flourished in the earlier half of the seventeenth century, has been published by Vish\u1e47u Parashur\u0101m \u015a\u0101stri Pandit, with the poet's biography in English by Janardan Sakh\u0101r\u0101m G\u0101dgil.\n\nTo Professor A. Weber we are indebted for an important contribution to our knowledge of Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit literature in a Romanized edition of H\u0101la's Sapt\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dakam, a collection of miscellaneous Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit stanzas, with a German translation and an exhaustive introduction on the phonetic and grammatical condition of the language; the work is printed in the Abhandlungen, or Memoirs, of the German Oriental Society.\n\nAs regards the cultivation of the classical language and literature of the Hindus, the members of the Society are probably aware from last year's Report that, owing to an increased governmental grant to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the publication of Sanskrit (and Persian) texts in the Bibliotheca Indica had been resumed with renewed vigour. It is a matter for rejoicing to Orientalists in Europe that this commendable zeal has by no means slackened during the last twelvemonth, as will be seen from the following list of publications which have appeared in the course of the year. B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra has issued Nos. 23 and 24 of his edition of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and the 9th fasciculi of the \u0100ra\u1e47yaka of the black Yajurveda, both with \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's commentary. Of the T\u0101ndya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, with \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's comment, parts 4 to 14, and of the L\u0101ty\u0101yana \u015arautas\u016btra with Agnisv\u0101min's Bh\u0101shya, parts 1 to 8, have appeared, both of which works are edited by \u0100nandachandra Ved\u0101ntav\u0101g\u012b\u015ba; also three fasciculi of the Agnipr\u0101\u1e47a, edited by Harachandra Vidy\u0101bh\u016bshana, and the 10th part of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 Dar\u015bana, with \u015aabarasy\u0101min's comment, edited by P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dita Mahe\u1e63a-\nchandra Ny\u0101yaratna. The Gop\u0101la T\u0101pant, with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e63vara\u2019s comment, has been edited by Harachandra Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63h\u0101na and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e47\u0101tha \u015a\u0101stri. Besides, the first part has appeared of the \u015a\u0101maveda \u015a\u0101hita, with \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s comment, edited by Satyavrat\u0101 \u015a\u0101ma\u015brami; the Gopatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, edited by Harachandra Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63h\u0101na; the N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha T\u0101pant, with \u015aankar\u0101ch\u0101rya\u2019s commentary, edited by R\u0101mamaya Tarakaratna, and of an English translation, by the Rev. K. M. Banerjea, of the Brahm\u0101s\u016btra, with \u015aankara\u2019s comment.\n\nIn the Bombay Sanskrit Series, conducted by Professors B\u00fchler and Kielhorn, have been issued, by the latter, the second number of his Paribh\u0101\u1e63hendu\u1e63\u1e6dekhara by N\u0101gojibha\u1e6d\u1e6da, containing the first part of the translation and notes; and, by Shankar P. Pandit, an annotated edition of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitra. Dr. Kielhorn has also published a Sanskrit Grammar for the use of the students at the Bombay and Poona Colleges. Dr. B\u00fchler, on the other hand, has issued, jointly with Mr. R. West, the second volume of their Digest of Hindu Law, and is at present engaged in preparing for publication, in the Sanskrit Series, a new and critical edition of the Da\u015bakum\u0101racharita.\n\nAmong editions of Sanskrit texts privately published by natives, the number of which rapidly increases year by year, though but a part of them reach Europe, the series of volumes issued by B\u0101b\u016b Barad\u0101 Pras\u0101da Majumdar may deserve notice, including, during last year, Bhavabh\u016bti\u2019s Uttarar\u0101macharita, with a commentary by T\u0101r\u0101 Kum\u0101ra-chakravart\u012b; the Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63hasa, edited by T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha Tarkav\u0101chaspati; the Ve\u1e47\u1e6dsanh\u0101ra, and second editions of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s Raghuva\u1e43\u015ba and Kum\u0101rasambhava, with Mallin\u0101tha\u2019s commentaries. Pandit T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha Tarkav\u0101chaspati has issued the Vi\u1e63\u1e47upur\u0101\u1e47a, with commentary, and a Bengali translation; the M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitra; Gang\u0101d\u0101sa\u2019s Chandomanjari and Ked\u0101rabha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s V\u1e5bttaratn\u0101kara; vol. i. of the second edition of the Siddh\u0101ntak\u0101umud\u012b, and the fourth and concluding part\nof his Sanskrit-English Dictionary, entitled *Sabdamamah\u0101nidhi*. Of other works which have come to the notice of the Council, editions may be mentioned of the *Saddendus\u0113khara*, with Bhairavamisra's commentary, printed at Benares; the *Bh\u0101gavatapur\u0101\u1e47a*, with Sudhara's commentary, at Bombay; the *Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101ya*, with Jayamangala's and Bharatamallika's commentaries, at Calcutta; the *Muh\u016brtachint\u0101mani*, with commentary, at Lucknow; and the first part of Charaka's famous medical work, on which some valuable remarks are made in a paper read before the Bengal Society, by Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar (Proceedings, 1870, p. 284).\n\nAt Madras also the presses have been busy in producing and reproducing Sanskrit works, though unfortunately in the Telugu character. It may be sufficient to mention editions of the *Tarkasamgraha* with Pat\u1e6dabhir\u0101ma's commentary, called Ny\u0101yabodhin\u012b; the *Ved\u0101ntas\u016btra* with R\u0101m\u0101nuja's Ved\u0101ntadipa; the *\u0100tmabodhas\u0101stra*; Mur\u0101ri's *An\u0101ghan\u0101taka*, and the *Da\u015bopanishad*.\n\nSide by side with this multiplication of printed literature\u2014a strong proof of the ever-growing demand for books among the natives of India, and, we trust, of an ever-increasing desire for acquaintance with the standard works of their ancient literature\u2014the search for manuscripts has been carried on with laudable energy in some parts of India. The Council were able to state in their last report that, in accordance with the scheme proposed by Mr. Whitley Stokes, and adopted by the Government of India, lists of MSS. had been printed at Benares, Calcutta, Bombay, and in Mysore. It will be satisfactory to the Society to learn that B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra, to whom the task of examining MSS. discovered in the Bengal Presidency had been intrusted, has since issued two fasciculi containing notices, including the beginnings and conclusions, of about 360 Sanskrit MSS. A list of 108 MSS. purchased for the Bombay Government during the years 1867-69, has also been printed by Prof. G. B\u00fchler, in Messrs.\nTr\u00fcbner's American and Oriental Record for November, 1870; and last, not least, Mr. A. Burnell has, through the same medium, completed his catalogue of Vedic MSS., forming part of that valuable collection which he last year so generously made over to the India Office Library. The same scholar has just been appointed by the Madras Government to compile a catalogue of the important manuscript collection of Tangore, which is reported by him to contain about 18,000 MSS.\n\nIn Europe Sanskrit studies have by no means been neglected during the past year. Dr. John Muir, with unwearied perseverance, has issued the fifth volume of his Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India, consisting of a series of papers contributed to the Society's Journal for 1864-6, and bearing mostly on Vedic theogony, mythology, and religious belief; with addition of a good deal of fresh materials, and a new essay on the life and manners during the Vedic age. Professor A. Weber has published, in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Berlin, a German translation of the second book of the Atharvaveda, and an essay on the R\u0101mdyana, the purport of which is to show that there is a connexion between the leading story of that epic,\u2014the rape of S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101ma's expedition to Lank\u0101 or Ceylon\u2014and the Trojan legend as it underlies Homer's Iliad. To last year's Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 393), the same scholar has contributed supplementary remarks to a former paper on the Jyotirvid\u0101bhara\u1e47am, an astronomical work assigned to K\u0101lid\u0101sa, though probably a different author from the well-known poet.\n\nProfessor W. D. Whitney, of Yale College, has furnished in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, the second and concluding part of his edition of the Taittir\u012bya Pr\u0101ti\u1e63\u0101khya, with its commentary, the Tribh\u0101shyaratna, a translation, notes and excellent indices.\n\nTo Professor A. Ludvig, of Prague, we are indebted for a\nvolume on the Vedic Infinitive, containing a great deal of valuable grammatical matter, which would have been still more acceptable had the compiler added a translation to the vast number of passages quoted from the Veda, as by that means scholars would have been enabled more easily to verify his grammatical inferences.\n\nDr. G. Thibaut has published a short Sanskrit text, entitled *Jatap\u0101\u1e6dha* treating of the *Jatap\u0101\u1e6dha*, a particular mode of reciting the hymns of the Vedas; to which he has added a German translation and annotations.\n\nDr. H. Pischel, in a Latin dissertation, *De K\u0101lid\u0101sae \u015a\u0101kuntal\u012b recensionibus*, has attempted to show, in a very able, if not entirely convincing, way, that of the so-called Bengali and Devanagari recensions, the two hitherto known versions of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's drama \u015a\u0101kuntalam, the former is the more ancient and genuine. It is, however, to be feared that to decide this knotty question, Dr. Pischel had hardly sufficient materials at his command, though he has, no doubt, deserved well in again mooting the subject, and thus urging its final settlement.\n\nOf Professors B\u00f6htlingk and Roth's Sanskrit Dictionary, published at St. Petersburg, two more numbers, viz., 43 and 44, have been received during the last year, carrying the work on to the middle of the letter V., after the completion of which four more letters remain to be gone through.\n\nA few more translations of Sanskrit works deserve mentioning. Professor H. Kern has carried on, in the pages of the Society's Journal, his critical translation of Var\u0101ha-mihira's Astrological work, the *B\u1e5bhat-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101*. Mr. R. T. H. Griffith has supplied us with a beautiful and pretty close English translation, in octosyllabic rhymed verse, of V\u0101lmiki's great epic, the *R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a*. Of Dr. F. Hall's second edition of Wilson's version of the Vishnu-Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the fifth and last volume has been issued. Mr. E. Brandes, a Danish scholar, following in the wake of Hammerich, who,\nin 1845, published the \u015a\u0101kuntala in Danish (of which a second edition appeared in 1858), has printed a neat Danish translation of King \u015a\u016bdraka's interesting drama, the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 of which an English translation was published by the late Professor Wilson in his Hindu Theatre, and a critical edition by Professor Stensler, of Breslau.\n\nThe field of Dravidian literature has found but few cultivators during the past year. Mr. C. E. Gower's lyrical translations from the Badaga, as read at these meetings, have been mentioned elsewhere. To Dr. H. F. M\u00f6gling, already favourably known by several Canarese publications, we are indebted for the first two chapters, in the Roman character, of Lakshm\u012bsa's old Canarese rifaccimento of the A\u1e63vamedhaparva of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the Jeimini Bh\u0101rata (Journal German Oriental Society, 1870, p. 309). The author had been placed by Wilson in the beginning of the thirteenth century. The reasons, however, adduced by Dr. M\u00f6gling, render it highly probable that he preceded Basava, who founded the Jangama sect, and broke the power of the Brahmins in that part of India, about A.D. 1000.\n\nAt Madras, the text of Bhaskara's Telugu version of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a has been printed; and Mr. P. S. R\u0101jagop\u0101la has published a second edition of his conversational manual in Tamil and English, with the text, analysis, and translation of forty stories from the Kad\u0101manjari. Mr. G. Garrett, Director of Public Instruction in Mysore, has published a manual of the ancient Canarese, entitled \u015aabd\u0101ma\u1e47i\u1e47anjari.\n\nAt Mangalore, a small Malay\u0101lim and English dictionary, and the fourth edition of the Panchatantra in Malay\u0101lim, with a glossary, have been issued.\n\nAs to the Literary Society of Madras, which in former times used to be the centre of Sanskrit and Dravidian studies in Southern India, the Council regret to have again to state that that branch of our Society has shown no sign of life during the past twelvemonth; and that, moreover, they have been\nofficially informed that, owing to want of encouragement on the part of the European residents, there is no prospect of the publication of its Journal being continued for some time.\n\nIn proceeding to take a rapid view of the labours in that Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit dialect which has become the chief depository of religious tenets that sway the minds of a very considerable portion of the population of Asia\u2014the P\u0101li\u2014it is highly gratifying to observe the steady increase of attention paid to so important a subject, especially in Ceylon, in Burmah, and throughout Europe. At the last anniversary the Council were able to state that, after some years of apparent inertness, the Ceylon branch of this Society had recommenced their operations with renewed vigour. These operations have been carried on ever since with decided success; that Society having published within the last fifteen months, three highly interesting numbers of its Journal. Among the articles they contain we may mention Mr. J. D\u2019Alwis\u2019s paper, \u201cOn the Origin of the Sinhalese Language,\u201d in which that writer shows the Sinhalese to be an Aryan language; a lecture on Buddhism, by the late eminent P\u0101li scholar, the Rev. D. J. Gogerly, with an introduction by the Rev. J. Scott, and notes by the Rev. D. de Sylva; an account and partial English translation by the Rev. S. Coles, of the P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101, or first book of the Vinaya portion of the Tripitaka. Further, by Mr. L. F. Lee, five chapters of text and translation of the B\u0101l\u0101vat\u016bra, a native P\u0101li grammar, of which that scholar intends to bring out a Romanized edition with an English translation; two inscriptions, about 350 years old, communicated, with translations and notes, by Mr. T. W. Rhys Davids; Specimens of Sinhalese Proverbs, by Mr. L. de Soyza, and a paper by Mr. W. Skeen, \u201cOn the Origin of the \u015ari-pada, or sacred Footprint, on the summit of Adam\u2019s Peak.\u201d\n\nIt will be remembered that the Government of Ceylon had lately resolved to have a catalogue compiled of all the P\u0101li MSS. known to exist in that island, and had appointed a\ncommission for examining places of archeological interest. Mr. D'Alwis, who has been intrusted with the compilation of the catalogue, has nearly completed his first volume, which, it is to be hoped, will add considerably to our knowledge of the materials for P\u0101li studies. Messrs. Rhys Davids and Smith, on the other hand, had started, on behalf of the archeological commission, on an expedition to Tolomarna, which is reported to have been very successful, the ruins of several monasteries and a great many ancient inscriptions having been discovered. Considering how much of what is known of Indian history is due to Buddhist sources, and especially to those of Ceylon, the importance of an archeological survey of that island can scarcely be overrated, and it must, therefore, be satisfactory to the members of this Society to know that the lively interest taken in these researches by the present Governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, promises well for their hopes in that direction.\n\nAnother scheme, which had been conceived some years since, and is now being carried into effect, on the part of the Buddhist clergy of Ceylon, will prove of no less importance to P\u0101li studies. It had been resolved that in every monastery the MSS. they possess of the Buddhist Canon should be carefully collated, and their variae lectiones noted in the best copy; and that, this having been effected, the MSS. containing the various readings should be sent up to a synod, when by their collation a critical and authorized text of the Tripitaka would be obtained.\n\nAs regards Burmah, it is a matter for congratulation to P\u0101li students, that no less a personage than the royal head of that country is the most zealous promoter of studies connected with Buddhism and P\u0101li literature. His Majesty, being himself the author of a P\u0101li grammar, is now said to have resolved to have the whole of the Buddhist Canon translated into English.\n\nThe P\u0101li text of Kachch\u0101yana's grammatical aphorisms has\nbeen issued, with annotations, by Dr. F. Mason, at Rangoon. This publication, though it has not satisfied European scholars, has, at all events, the merit of supplying, in a handy form, the whole of these important s\u016btras in probably as correct a text as is met with in an average Burmese MS.\n\nIn Germany, Dr. E. Kuhn, a young P\u0101li scholar already favourably known by a specimen of Kachch\u0101yana, containing the text and v\u1e5btta of the K\u0101raka, or third chapter on the construction of the cases, has lately taken another step in the right direction by an excellent edition of the N\u0101makappa, or second chapter of that grammar.\n\nIn France, M. Feer has contributed to the Journal Asiatique for May\u2014June, 1870, another instalment of his highly interesting and instructive \u00c9tudes Bouddhiques, including French translations from the P\u0101li and Tibetan, of the Dharmachakrapravartanam, the so-called Benares sermon, a chapter of the Buddhist scriptures.\n\nIn Russia, Mr. J. Minayeff has printed the text and Russian translation of the P\u0101timokkha, a collection of the Laws of the Buddhist Priesthood, of which translations by Messrs. Gogerly and Beal are found in vol. xix. of the Society's Journal. Mr. Minayeff has added some valuable extracts from the Arthakath\u0101s and from the Bhikkhuni p\u0101timokkha (the chapter relating to nuns); although the language in which the notes are given\u2014his native tongue\u2014is, unfortunately, known to but a very limited number of students. The same scholar has published the Vuttodaya, a P\u0101li metrical treatise, founded on Sanskrit works of a similar nature.\n\nIn this country not less attention has been paid to P\u0101li and Buddhism. Our own Society has, through its Journal, placed before the public several important papers bearing on these subjects.\n\nThe second part of vol. iv. contained Mr. R. C. Childers's P\u0101li text, with a translation and critical notes, of the Khuddaka P\u0101\u1e6dha, one of the chapters of the Buddhist scriptures.\nTo the number published a few months since, Mr. V. Fussboll, the Danish scholar and editor of the Dhammapada, has contributed two J\u0101takas, or legends relating to former births of Buddha, in the original P\u0101li, with an English translation, critical notes, and some interesting remarks on the connexion of those fables with their Sanskrit versions, as found in the Panchatantra, Hitopade\u015ba and other works. Mr. Childers's paper on some passages of the Dhammapada relative to the question of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a has been mentioned before, as has been Mr. L. Comrilla Vijasinha's note on the origin of the Commentaries on the Buddhist Canon. There are, besides, some arch\u00e6ological papers bearing, either philologically or historically, on the same subject, viz., General Cunningham and Professor Dowson's Mathur\u0101 P\u0101li Inscriptions\u2014which have also been dealt with by B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101jendra in the Journal of the Parent Society;\u2014Mr. S. Beal's lecture on the S\u0101nchi Tope, showing scenes and passages from the Vessantara J\u0101taka to be represented in some of the sculptures of that monument; and lastly, Mr. A. Wylie's paper on the Buddhist Inscription of Keu-yung kwan.\n\nCaptain T. Rogers has translated, from their Burmese version, the Parables contained in Buddhaghosha's commentary on the Dhammapada; to this Professor Max M\u00fcller has added a new translation of the Dhammapada and an elaborate introduction, in which he inquires into the authenticity of the traditional accounts regarding Buddhaghosha and the Arthakath\u0101s, and sets forth the importance of the Dhammapada for an exact comprehension of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, the Buddhist summum bonum.\n\nA want, however, which has long been felt, not only by P\u0101li scholars and Indianists in general, but also by the students of those languages which bear the mark of Buddhist thought impressed on them\u2014a P\u0101li dictionary\u2014is at last about to be supplied by Mr. R. C. Childers. This work, which is now printing, is to be issued in two parts; the\nRoman character being employed for the P\u0101li words, whilst the Devanagari is reserved for their Sanskrit equivalents.\n\nMr. H. Alabaster has issued a work on modern Buddhism in Siam, setting forth the views of an intelligent and enlightened Siamese on his own and other religions. Of this interesting book a second and greatly enlarged edition is already in preparation.\n\nA manual of Chinese-Buddhist terms and proper names has been published by the Rev. E. J. Eitel. Finally, much valuable matter, chiefly drawn from Chinese and Tibetan sources, is contained in Professor J. Summers's new periodical, the Phoenix.\n\nBefore passing to the various labours in the literatures of nations for whose chief development we have to look to the countries west of the Indus, it may not be inappropriate briefly to report on the progress made in historical and geographical research with regard to India. This important and fascinating field of inquiry has received more than usual attention at the hands of English scholars. Of Professor J. Dowson's edition of the late Sir H. M. Elliot's History of the Muhammedan Period of India, the third volume has appeared, carrying the work on from the death of N\u0101siru-d din, in 1260 A.D., to the invasion of Tim\u016br in 1398 A.D. The amount of materials from Persian historians here placed, for the first time, before the public in the garb of a European language, is very considerable, including, as it does, translations, by the Editor, of Z\u012b\u0101u-d din Barni's and Shams-i Sir\u0101j 'Af\u012bl's works, both bearing the same title of T\u0101r\u012bkh-i Firoz Sh\u0101h\u012b; also of Sult\u0101n Firoz Sh\u0101h's Futuh\u0101t-i Firoz Sh\u0101h\u012b, and extracts from other works bearing on that period.\n\nMr. E. Thomas, in his \"Chronicles of the Path\u0101n Kings of Delhi,\" a portly volume grown out of his original monographs on the coinage of the Path\u0101n Sult\u0101ns and their Bengal neighbours, with addition of such materials as have\nsince been discovered, has admirably shown how much the sparks of light elicited by numismatic and general antiquarian research may contribute to illuminate dark spots in the history of Eastern nations. The period in the history of Hindust\u00e1n illustrated in this work extends from A.D. 1192 to 1554, and comprises the rule of six dynasties of forty kings who succeeded in turn to the throne of Dehli.\n\nMr. Lepel H. Griffin's volume on the \"R\u00e2jas of the Punjab,\" furnishes a connected account, drawn from official records, of the political relations of the British Government with the principal states of the Punjab, from the commencement of the present century.\n\nTo Colonel Meadows Taylor students are indebted for a very useful manual of the history of India.\n\nOf the Central Provinces Gazetteer, published in 1867, Mr. C. Grant has brought out a second edition, which, however, may almost be considered as a new work. It now, for the first time, appears in the convenient alphabetical form usual in gazetteers; and, moreover, contains an introductory and highly interesting sketch of the history and ethnology as well as of the social and geological condition of those provinces.\n\nThe first volume of a \"Geography of India,\" published by General A. Cunningham, comprises the Buddhist period, extending from the time of Buddha to the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni. In following up his own former labours in the same field, as those of Lassen, Wilson, Saint-Martin, and others, the learned officer has thus placed before the public the results of his inquiries during a long residence in India, and particularly of a four years' successful service as Archaeological Surveyor, which must have especially qualified him to undertake so difficult a task.\n\nThe Society is no doubt aware that the Indian Government has lately instituted a General Archaeological Survey of the whole of India, and that General Cunningham has again\nbeen called upon to conduct the commission appointed for that purpose. Arriving in India at the beginning of the year, that officer, with his staff, has commenced operations by re-examining the ruins of Mathur\u0101, and thence he has proceeded to Lahore, where he is at the present moment engaged in extensive excavations.\n\nFrom the Madras Government, an interesting report, by Mr. J. A. C. Boscell, \"On the Archaeological Remains of the Kistna District,\" has lately been received by the Society, and partially read at a recent meeting. The most important portions of this paper were the remarks made on the pre-Buddhist remains, consisting of aboriginal caves near Karsupudi, and sepulchral tumuli and stone circles, which he supposes to be of Scythic origin, and which closely resemble those in the Neilgherries.\n\nAt Bombay, Mr. Burgess and Dr. Bh\u0101u D\u0101ji have carried on their investigations, the latter having undertaken to revise the western Buddhist inscriptions, including that of Girm\u0101r. In an interesting number lately issued by the Bombay branch of our Society, that scholar has given a facsimile, transcript and translation, of an inscription discovered by Mr. G. W. Terry in the temple of Amran\u0101tha near Kaly\u0101na. The same number contains some remarks, by Captain E. W. West, on the fort of Pan\u0101la, and a paper, by R\u0101o Saheb Vishvan\u0101th N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, on serpent worship in Western India. Finally, some papers of archaeological interest are contained in the Bengal Journal, including one by Mr. H. Blochmann on the Arabic and Persian Inscriptions in the H\u016bgli District; notes on old Delhi, by Mr. J. D. Tremlett; on Archaeological Remains at Sh\u0101h ki Dheri, and the site of Taxila, by Mr. J. G. Delmerick; and a memorandum on, and tentative reading of, the S\u016b Vih\u0101r inscription near Bh\u0101valp\u016br, by Mr. E. C. Bayley.\n\nIt may be convenient in this place to draw attention to a work on the language of a tribe which, though now scattered\nbroadcast over the earth, clearly derives its origin from the plains of India. Mr. A. G. Paspati, a Greek physician at Constantinople, had published, some ten years since, a work on the language of the Gipsies in Turkey, of which an English translation appeared in the seventh volume of the Journal of the American Oriental Society (1862).\n\nThe author has lately brought out a new, and French, edition of his work, which is very much enlarged, and altogether re-written. With reference to this book, Drs. A. Mordtmann and A. F. Pott have contributed a paper to the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 681), containing some valuable additions and a few corrections.\n\nOur knowledge of the nature of the Pahlavi language has received a valuable addition in Professor M. Haug's Essay, forming part of the introduction to an old Pahlavi-P\u0101zand glossary, edited under the auspices of the Bombay Government, by Destur Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa, high priest of the Parsis in Malwa. Dr. Haug's opinion is that the language of the Pahlavi version of the Avesta, when read, is an Iranian dialect, not materially differing from the modern Persian; whilst the written words, on the contrary, represent an Aramaic, or Semitic, dialect, with the exception, firstly, of certain Iranian prefixes and terminations, added to aid the memory in substituting the Iranian equivalents; and, secondly, of such Iranian words as, in time, may have crept in. Some remarks have been made on Dr. Haug's book, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 713), by Dr. E. Sachau, who, whilst rejecting many of the author's readings and etymologies, accepts his theories with regard to the origin and nature of the Pahlavi language.\n\nIn Professor F. Spiegel's \"Iranian Antiquities,\" Oriental students will no doubt welcome an important contribution to Iranian research. This work, clearly taking as its prototype Lassen's \"Indian Antiquities,\" is to be published in three volumes, the first of which has already appeared, containing\nthe ethnographical account and ancient history of the Iranian tribes, and the geography of their seats.\n\nProfessor F. Justi, likewise, in a University Memorial, has given a second instalment of \"Contributions to the Ancient Geography of Persia.\"\n\nThe Persian publications in the Bibliotheca Indica, like the Sanskrit series, though not in the same degree, have been pushed on with more than usual vigour. Of Mr. H. Blochmann's excellent translation of Abul Fazl's Ain i Akbari, the supplementary volume of the same writer and politician's Akbar-namah, the fourth part has been published, as have likewise the 11th and 12th fasciculi of his edition of the text. Parts 13 to 18 have also appeared of Khafi Khan's Muntakhab-al-Lubab, edited by Maulawi Kabir al-din Ahmad; the first fasciculus of 'Abdar Rashid's Farhang i Rashidi, edited by Maulawi Zulfaghar 'Ali; further, three fasciculi of Muhammad Saghi Musta'id Khani's History of the Emperor Aurangzib Alamgir, and two fasciculi of Nizami's Sikandar-namah i Bahri, both edited by Maulawi Agha Ahmad 'Ali.\n\nIn the Journal of the Bengal Society the late Major Fuller's translations from the Tarikh-i Firuz Shahi are continued. Of native publications it may suffice to mention two small hand-books introductory to the study of the Persian language, printed at Lahore, by order of the Punjab Government, viz., the Farsh-ki-pahlvi-Kitab and the Farsh-ki-duari-Kitab, the latter bring a kind of chrestomathy on a small scale, whilst the former contains easy sentences illustrating the grammatical construction and idioms of the language.\n\nProfessor J. A. Vullers has brought out a second, and much improved, edition (likewise written in Latin) of his Grammar of the Persian Language, as compared with the Sanskrit and Zend. The first edition of this work was published as long back as 1840, and has always been valued as a successful attempt at establishing an accurate appreciation of the extent of grammatical and phonetic coincidences\nof the Persian with Aryan languages, by one who combines, as few others do, a sufficient acquaintance with at least some of the latter with a sound Semitic scholarship.\n\nFerideddin Att\u0101j's Pendn\u0101meh, of which a French version exists, by M. de Sacy, has been translated into German by Dr. G. H. F. Nesselmann, already known by his translations from Sadi and Hafiz.\n\nAfter an interval of nearly twenty years, the late F. R\u00fcckert's text and poetical translation of Dsh\u0101mi's love-songs have at last been continued in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 563), where also a short account of Mirza Shaffi has been given by Mr. A. Berg\u00e9.\n\nThe list of already existing Catalogues of Semitic MSS. has received some important additions during the last year. Foremost stands the first volume of the Catalogue of Syriac MSS. in the British Museum, compiled by Dr. W. Wright, and containing accounts of, and extracts from, the Biblical MSS. and Service Books of the Nitrian Collection. The second volume of this work, which is nearly ready for publication, will embody the rest of the theological literature. The same scholar has communicated in the German Oriental Society's Journal (p. 599) a list of the Magdala Collection of Ethiopic MSS., formerly forming part of the Library of King Theodore, of Abyssinia, now in the British Museum.\n\nOf Dr. Rieu's Catalogue of Persian MSS. of that institution, a large portion had been printed, when the sheets were unfortunately destroyed by the fire at Watts's printing-office; a mishap which has also delayed Mr. Laue's issuing the fourth part of his Arabic Dictionary.\n\nM. B. Dorn has printed in the Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy, a short Catalogue of a number of Oriental, mostly Persian, MSS., bequeathed to the Asiatic Museum of the Imperial Academy by the late M. Graf.\n\nFinally, Mr. E. H. Pulmer has published a Catalogue of the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish MSS. at Trinity College,\nCambridge; with an Appendix containing the Hebrew and Samaritan MSS. of the same library.\n\nThe usual, not undeserved, amount of zealous attention has been bestowed on the cultivation of Arabic literature, especially on the Continent. Professor F. W\u00fcstenfeld's complete edition of Yak\u00fat's important Geographical Dictionary of all Countries known to the Arabs in his days, has been followed up by another publication on Geography. M. de Goeje, of Leiden, has issued the first volume of a Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum, containing the work of Ish\u00e1k al-F\u00e1ris\u00ed al-Istakhr\u00ed, hitherto but partly edited by Anderson and Arnold, and lithographed by Moeller. The volume now published is to be followed by two others containing the works of Ibn Haukal and Mokaddasi, when the collection is to be completed by a German translation, with indexes and a glossary.\n\nOf Ibn-El-Athiri's great Chronicle, edited by Professor C. J. Tornberg, of Upsala, another volume, the fifth, has been issued, comprising the years H. 96 to 154. It will be remembered that Mr. Tornberg began his edition by publishing vols. vi. to xii., which were followed, in rapid succession, by vols. i. to v.; thus, only one more volume, the sixth, is wanting to complete the work. Of Professor W. Wright's edition of that valuable, though curious, literary repertory, the K\u00e2mil of El-Mubarrad, brought out in annual parts, printed at the expense of the German Oriental Society, the seventh part has appeared during last year. The same scholar has supplied to Arabic students a very useful chrestomathy, containing some hitherto unpublished texts, with a glossary. Professor Ahlwardt, of Greifswald, has brought out a collective edition of the Div\u00e2ns of the six ancient Arabic poets, Enn\u00e2b\u00eega, 'Antara, Tarafa, Zuhair, 'Algama, and Imruolgais; and M. Von Kremer has given, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 481), an account and some poems, with a German translation, of the Shi'ite poet Abu-Ik\u00e2\u015f\u00eem Mohamed\nIbn H\u0101n\u012b', who lived at the court of the Fatimite Mo'izz, the conqueror of Egypt, in the tenth century. The Arabic version and a new German translation of the curious Neoplatonic tract of Hermes Trismegistos, an \"Address to the Human Soul,\" has been printed by Professor Fleischer, of Leipzig, in commemoration of the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the German Oriental Society, held in September last year.\n\nA work, however, of the highest importance to Oriental literary and philological studies, the Kit\u0101b-al-Fihrist of Mu\u1e25ammad bin Ish\u0101\u1e33 al-Nad\u012bm, is now in an advanced state of publication. This work had been prepared for the press by the late eminent scholar and honorary member of our Society, Professor G. Fl\u00fcgel, when his labours were unfortunately cut short by a sudden death. The annotated text, however, is now being carried through the press by Dr. H. Roediger, and the first volume will probably be issued in the course of the summer. The latter scholar has also published some specimens from Arabic grammarians, including the well-known philologist Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101r\u012bra, in connexion with a treatise on the so-called \"Verbal Nouns,\" in Arabic.\n\nDr. J. B. Wenig has written a Latin dissertation on Arabic accentuation; and delivered, and printed, a lecture on Arabic poetry.\n\nDr. M. Steinschneider has contributed to the Journal of the German Oriental Society, a second essay, \"On the History of Translations from Indian Languages into Arabic, and their influence on Arabic Literature,\" chiefly based on accounts of Abraham Ibn Ezra (who lived about A.D. 1160), occurring in the introduction to his Hebrew translation of an Arabic astronomical work.\n\nOne of the three numbers of the Journal Asiatique issued during last year, is almost entirely occupied by a paper on the Arabic names of some species of plants, by the late M. Cl\u00e9ment-Mullet.\n\nFinally, it may be mentioned in this place, that Lord\nStanley of Alderley has continued, in the Society's Journal, his edition, in the Morisco-Spanish, of the Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, by four cantos, containing the history of Heshim, the great-grandfather of the Prophet.\n\nSyriac studies have also received some important contributions of hitherto unpublished texts. Dr. J. P. L. Land has brought out a third volume of his \"Anecdota Syriaca,\" containing the Syriac version of the historical writings which pass under the name of Zacharias, Bishop of Mitylene. That that worthy dignitary, who flourished in the early part of the sixth century of our era, did not himself write in Syriac, but in Greek, has been proved by Dr. Land many years since. The reasons he now adduces render it highly probable that of the twelve books published by him and generally assigned to Zacharias, five only, viz., books three to seven, are by that writer, whilst the rest have been compiled from various sources by the Syrian translators. Dr. E. Sachau also has published a volume of \"Inedita Syriaca,\" being a collection of Syriac translations of Greek profane writings, edited from MSS. in the British Museum. To the Journal of the German Oriental Society Dr. R. Schr\u00f6ter has contributed two articles on Syriac subjects, one containing extracts from Bar Hebraeus' scholia on the Old Testament; the other, a letter of Jacob, Bishop of Edessa, to one John the Styliite, Presbyter of Jatreb; both with a German translation and critical notes. The publication also of the Rev. Dr. Payne Smith's Syriac dictionary is now being carried on vigorously; two parts have already been issued, containing the first three letters of the alphabet.\n\nOf the Aramaic dialects, Dr. H. Zschokke has brought out a hand-book for the use of students; whilst Professor T. N\u00f6ldeke has contributed to the Journal of the German Oriental Society, as a third instalment of his Aramaic studies, a paper on the dialect of Palmyra. In the mean time, Dr. Socin, during his travels in Syria, has been collecting much\nlinguistic material on various modern dialects, and, from time to time, reported on the progress of his inquiries.\n\nThe lapidary remains of the Ph\u0153nician antiquity have received some valuable illustration by the publication of the fourth part of Dr. M. A. Levy's Ph\u0153nician studies; this number contains a survey of the labours in this department of research since 1863; besides separate chapters, full of fresh philological matter, on the inscriptions of Abydos, Sardinia, Spain and North Africa; and finally some additions to the author's Phoenician glossary. The inscription of Marseilles has again been made the subject of inquiry in the pages of the Journal Asiatique, by M. Hal\u00e9vi, who has ventured upon a new translation, based on a comparison of the text with the Hebrew, with the entire exclusion of the Arabic. Dr. J. Unger, on the other hand, has made some remarks in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, on the slabs both of Carthage and Marseilles, with special reference to Dr. Meier's explanation of these documents.\n\nAn event, however, of the highest importance to Semitic pal\u00e6ography, as well as to ancient history, is no doubt the discovery of the Dilon monolith, which has been only lately discussed at a meeting of our Society. In spite of its importance, it would hardly seem necessary for the Council here to enlarge on a subject which has already received its full due, if not more than its due, of attention at the hands of so many scholars.\n\nThe number of Himyaric antiquities discovered in Yemen is increasing almost daily. Captain Miles's valuable donation to this Society has been mentioned before. The two bronze tablets, noticed in last year's Report as likewise presented by that officer, have since found an interpreter, together with a considerable number of other Himyaric inscriptions, in Dr. M. A. Levy, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, where, at the same time, lithographs of them are given.\n\nThe British Museum, also, has from time to time been\nenriched by inscriptions and other antiquities, among which we may mention a newly-received stone, containing a beautifully cut \u03b2\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b7\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd inscription; also two copper tablets, which are said to constitute one inscription, together with the tablet which has lately come into our possession.\n\nAn Himyaric monument of probably a somewhat similar purpose to the sculptured alabaster slab lately presented by Captain Miles, has been treated in the Journal Asiatique, for 1870, by M. Clermont-Ganneau, who takes it to represent a sacrifice to 'Athtar, the deity invoked on the slab. Some remarks on the same monument, though from more imperfect squeezes, have been made by Professor Gildemeister, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society for 1870 (p. 178).\n\nSome progress has also been made during last year in the field of Cuneiform Researches. Of Mr. E. Norris's Assyrian Dictionary, the second volume has been published, whilst a considerable portion of the third volume has already passed through the press. It must be the sincere wish of all Orientalists that so zealous and able a fellow-labourer may yet enjoy many years of health and vigour to see his work completed.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson has lately added a vast amount of fresh material by issuing, with the assistance of Mr. G. Smith, another volume containing, on seventy folio plates, selections from the Miscellaneous Inscriptions of Assyria. Among these may be mentioned the Assyrian Canon, consisting of chronological tables supplying a continuous succession of eponymes for 228 years (from B.C. 893 to 660), an inscription on a monolith found in the ruins of Kurkh, relating the campaigns of the earlier years of the reign of Shalmeneser II.; a copy of the inscription of Sennacherib on the rock at Bavian; the text of the Decagon Cylinder of Assur-bani-pal, and various miscellaneous historical inscriptions, besides copies of several contracts, deeds, observatory reports, astrological and mythological fragments.\nMr. G. Smith has, meanwhile, been steadily pursuing his labours at the Annals of Sardanapalus. A further contribution to Assyrian philology is also promised by Mr. F. Talbot for the next number of the Society's Journal.\n\nThe so-called Median Cuneiforms, on the other hand, have received some illustrations in a paper by Dr. A. Mordtman, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society.\n\nThe language of the other principal branch of Muhammedan races\u2014the Turks\u2014has not been neglected.\n\nM. de Schlechta-Weseherd has published a useful French and Turkish manual of terms and phrases used principally in diplomatic documents.\n\nTo M. Pavet de Courteille we are indebted for an East Turkish Dictionary, an important addition to the labours of Messrs. V\u00e9liminof-Zernof and Vamb\u00e9ry.\n\nDr. Zenker, likewise, has been continuing his dictionary of the Turkish, Arabic, and Persian, by three more parts, viz., 14 to 16.\n\nThe various dialects and history of the Indian Archipelago have been, as usual, successfully cultivated in the Journals of the Dutch Institute and the Batavian Society, which contain several valuable philological contributions, the former by Messrs. H. Kern and H. C. Klinkert, the latter by Messrs. J. G. F. Riedel and H. N. van der Tuuk. The Batavian Society having, in the course of last year, issued a number of well-executed typographic impressions of Kawi copper-plate inscriptions, this important field of inquiry, which had so long been allowed to lie fallow, has at length been successfully taken up by Prof. H. Kern, of Leiden. This scholar has just published a volume of Kawi Studies, containing two cantos of the text of the Arjuna Vir\u0101ha in the ancient Javanese, with a Dutch translation, notes, and an introduction. The Dutch Institute has further printed M. T. Roorda's Javanese text of the Wayangs of Palasara, Pandoe, and Raden Pandji, and the first volume of a Malayan\nChrestomathy by M. G. K. Niemann. It remains briefly to mention the latest publications on Chinese and Japanese literature and philology. Mr. J. Summers's Monthly Magazine, the Phoenix, of which ten numbers have as yet been issued, will, no doubt, prove a useful repository to scholars interested in these inquiries, containing, as it does, numerous and valuable essays on the literature, history, and religion of the peoples of Eastern Asia. The Memoirs of the Munich and Vienna Academies also contain, as usual, contributions on the same subjects, by Messrs. Plath and Pfizmayer. Dr. V. Strauss has published a new German translation of Lao-Tse's Tao Te King, with a comment and an introduction. Mr. A. B. Mitford, in his Tales of Old Japan, a book at the same time instructive and amusing, makes us acquainted with the legendary lore as well as the domestic life and manners of the Japanese. Whilst grammatical inquiry has been promoted by one publication only, the second volume of M. St. Julien's Syntaxe nouvelle de la langue Chinoise, Chinese lexicography has received more than usual attention during last year. The Revds. R. S. Maclay and C. C. Baldwin have supplied an alphabetical dictionary of the Chinese language in the Foochow dialect; the Rev. W. Lebscheid, a Chinese and English Dictionary, arranged according to the radicals; Rev. J. Edkins, a Glossary of the Minu dialects; Mr. F. Porter Smith, a vocabulary of proper names in Chinese and English; and M. Paul Perny, a Dictionary in French, Latin, and Chinese, of the Mandarin dialect.\n\nIn concluding these remarks, we may mention that Mr. J. Summers is now engaged in compiling a new catalogue of the Society's important collection of Chinese printed books, as well as of that of the India Office Library.\n\nIt will be incumbent on this meeting to elect a new president for the ensuing year, in the place of one whose constant attendance at the Society's meetings, and deep\nattachment to Oriental research, in which he occupies himself so prominent a place, have lasting claims on the gratitude of this Society. Sir Henry having intimated to the Council that his duties at the India Office and the Geographical Society would not permit him for another year to combine the office of a President with that of a Director of this Society, Sir Edward Colebrooke has kindly allowed himself to be put in nomination for the former office, and the Council feel assured that the warm interest Sir Edward has always taken in the objects of this Society, coupled with that very name which marks one of the most glorious epochs in its history, will strongly recommend him to the meeting.\n\nAccording to Art. XXI. of the Society's regulations, the following five members of the Council will go out: General Cunningham, the Rt. Hon. Lord Lawrence, E. L. Brandreth, Esq., James Fergusson, Esq., and Sir H. Bartle E. Frere. In their places, the Council propose to the meeting the following names: Sir Donald F. McLeod, the Rt. Hon. Lord Stanley of Alderley, Prof. T. Goldstucker, N. B. E. Baillie, Esq., and the Rt. Hon. Holt Mackenzie. In the place of the last-named gentleman and Sir Edward Colebrooke, the Council recommend Sir H. Bartle E. Frere, and Mr. J. Fergusson for the two vacancies in the list of vice-presidents.\n\nAUDITORS' REPORT.\n\nYour Auditors, having examined the accounts of the past year, and compared them with the vouchers, find them correct. They have also formed a careful estimate of the income and expenditure for the ensuing year, and anticipate that the income will suffice to meet the expected demands on the Society's resources without trenching on the balance in the bankers' hands at the beginning of the year.\n\nJames Fergusson, Auditor for the Council.\nNeil B. E. Baillie,\nHenry Lewis, Auditors for the Society.\nThe reading of the Report being concluded, it was proposed by Sir John Bouring, seconded by Major-General G. Le Grand Jacob, and carried unanimously:\n\n\"That the Report of the Council and of the Auditors be adopted, printed, and distributed, and that the best thanks of the meeting be presented to Sir Henry Rawlinson for his constant attention to the affairs of the Society, and his unwearied exertions to promote its interests; and to the Vice-Presidents, Council, and other Officers of the Society, for the zealous and efficient manner in which they have discharged the duties of their several offices.\"\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson, after returning thanks for the flattering terms in which his services had been mentioned in Sir John's proposition, said:\n\nThe very able and exhaustive Report which has just been read to you, and for which we are mainly indebted to the industry and critical knowledge of our Secretary, leaves me really nothing further to say on the subject of the prosecution of Oriental studies in the East or in the West.\n\nThe long list of recent works and papers which the Secretary has enumerated in every department of Oriental learning testifies to the increased and ever-increasing interest which is felt in the cultivation of those studies for which this Society was specially instituted; and shows, moreover, that we have borne our due part in the healthy activity that surrounds us. I have sometimes heard murmurs of regret that our prosperity diminishes\u2014that our resources and means of usefulness become attenuated\u2014by the creation of the many subsidiary societies that have arisen, if not under our auspices, at any rate in a great measure from the impulse and encouragement we have given to Oriental studies. I allude to such bodies as the Syro-Egyptian Society, the Palestine Exploration Fund, and more recently the Society of Biblical Archeology\u2014all of which, according to the views of many, ought to be merely sub-departments\nof the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain: but I cannot for my own part find it in my heart to complain of such independent action in special branches of inquiry. As the mother-country benefits by her colonies scattered over the different quarters of the globe, so must this parent Society benefit by the creation of fresh centres of interest in the great domain of Oriental Science. For a time possibly our finances may suffer, owing to the diversion of subscriptions into other channels; but in the long run we shall right ourselves, even financially, if we only hold our literary position at the head of the Orientalism of England. The more indeed that a knowledge of Eastern languages and Eastern science is diffused amongst the public, the better it must be for that body of which the true and the noble vocation is to guide and encourage and preside over all such researches for the general good.\n\nIt is a matter of much regret to me that the many heavy calls upon my time\u2014and especially the direction which is about to be confided to me of one of our most flourishing sister societies\u2014compels me to surrender into your hands before my time of office is complete, the Presidency of this Society, which you were good enough to entrust to me in 1869; but I have at any rate the satisfaction of knowing that I resign my functions into most worthy and most thoroughly competent hands. The name of Colebrooke is in itself a tower of strength\u2014and Sir E. Colebrooke has already on former occasions shown you that he does not yield to his illustrious father either in his own earnest interest in Oriental science, or in his anxiety to promote its cultivation. I feel sure, gentlemen, that the Society will not derogate from its high position while the Presidency remains in his hands, but that he will lead you on to increased honour, numbers, and usefulness.\n\nThe Ballot was then had recourse to, for the election of a\nPresident, two Vice-Presidents, and five members of Council; when the result was declared to be as follows:\n\nPresident: Sir Thomas Edward Colebrooke, Bart., M.P.\n\nDirector: Major-Gen. Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., D.C.L., F.R.S.\n\nVice-Presidents: The Right Hon. Sir Edward Ryan; M. E. Grant Duff, Esq., M.P.; Sir H. Bartle E. Frere, G.C.S.I., K.C.B.; James Fergusson, Esq., F.R.S., D.C.L.\n\nTreasurer: Edward Thomas, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nHonorary Secretary: Professor Thomas Chenery.\n\nHonorary Librarian: Edwin Norris, Esq.\n\nSecretary: J. Eggeling, Esq.\n\nCouncil: N. B. E. Baillie, Esq.; C. P. Brown, Esq.; Dr. Archibald Campbell; John Dickinson, Esq.; M. P. Edgeworth, Esq.; Claude J. Erskine, Esq.; W. E. Frere, Esq.; Prof. T. Goldstucker; Arthur Grote, Esq.; Charles Horne, Esq.; The Right Hon. Holt Mackenzie; Sir Donald F. McLeod; Sir Charles Nicholson, Bart.; Osmond de Beauvoir Priaulx, Esq.; The Right Hon. Lord Stanley of Alderley.\n\nSir H. Rawlinson having vacated the chair for the new President, Sir Edward Colebrooke addressed the Meeting, as follows:\n\nGentlemen,\u2014My first duty in acknowledging the honour you have done me, in inviting me to preside over this Society, is to express the regret which I feel, in common with all the members of this Society, at the premature retirement of Sir H. Rawlinson from the chair which he has occupied, with so much dignity and advantage to the Society, during the past two years. We must admit that the invitation which has been made to him to preside over one of the most active and popular associations in this metropolis, is one to which he is fully entitled from his labours in advancing our knowledge of ancient geography, and in promoting modern discovery. It involved demands on the time which may well make one, whose time is so largely occupied\nby official duties, unwilling to join with it the position of President of the Royal Asiatic Society. It is not the less a matter of regret to us, that we shall lose the advantage which the reputation and ability of one of the most learned contributors to our proceedings have given to the Society, during the time he has occupied the chair. For myself, I feel that the honour which you have conferred upon me, both on the present and on a former occasion, is due to the inheritance of a name which holds a foremost place in the respect of all Eastern scholars, and is intimately associated with the foundation of this Society. It adds much to the difficulty I feel in taking the chair, that I have such an example before me; and I should certainly have shrunk from a position to which I have, personally, no claim, did I not rely on the support of former colleagues, and carry with me the recollection of the aid I have received from your learned Director, in my endeavour to discharge the duties you have imposed upon me.\n\nI may at the same time say that the work on which I have been recently engaged of endeavouring to give a somewhat full account of the life and varied labours of Mr. H. Colebrooke, labours which you are aware extended to many fields beyond the range of Oriental research, has led me to examine more carefully than I had hitherto done some of the subjects of inquiry connected with the ancient literature of India, to which so much of his time was devoted; and this has added largely to the interest I feel in the progress of these researches. His aim, I need hardly say, like that of his successor, was to throw some light on one of the most interesting as well as obscure passages in the history of the world. It was not merely to arrive at some distinct knowledge of the state of the arts, science, and literature of ancient India, and in age far removed from our own, but to trace the rise and progress of the religious and philosophical opinions which have prevailed from time to time;\nsome of which maintain their influence on the manners and modes of thought which exist in those countries in the present day. The field is a wide one; it is one in which we look for the aid of kindred societies now established in considerable numbers both in the East and West, and we are enabled to pursue these inquiries under advantages which the pioneers of these studies did not possess.\n\nIt is a task to which we are more than ever impelled from a feeling of duty towards the inhabitants of a vast country, so strongly united by political ties with our own. It may be not unreasonable to hope that the knowledge thus acquired of the former history and condition of these countries may have some practical influence on its present condition, and may aid in solving some questions bearing on its future political and social life. But for this we must trust to the labours and co-operation of learned natives of India, many of whom, we rejoice to know, are warmly interested in researches whose sole aim is to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the former life of the nation, as it is shown in the different branches of its literature or science.\n\nI trust that the Royal Asiatic Society will continue to take a full share in these inquiries, and that the efforts of its members may add to its reputation and bear fruits in the well-being of the people of India.\n\nThe Meeting was then adjourned to June 19th.\n## ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1870.\n\n### RECEIPTS\n\n| Description                                      | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 130 Resident Members, at 3 guineas each           | 465 0 0 |\n| 61 Non-Resident Members, at 1 guinea each        | 61 1 0  |\n| 2 Original Members, at 2 guineas each            | 6 6 0   |\n| Arrears paid up                                   | 12 12 0 |\n| Compositions:                                     |         |\n| Thakur Goparshad Singh                           | 10 10 0 |\n| Rajah Jaikishan Dass Bahadur                     | 10 10 0 |\n| S.
