The collection was sent to England and for some time was exhibited at the South Kensington Museum. In 1887, however, His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak purchased the collection, and in 1891 it was deposited in the newly-opened Sarawak Museum. To this nucleus have been added by constant additions nearly 1,500 specimens and so recently as 1899 a competent critic was able to assert that the Sarawak Museum contained \"the best and most instructive collection of Sarawak ethnography extant\" (\"Nature\" Aug. 31st 1899, p. 415.)\n\nUnfortunately the Museum is but rarely visited by serious students of anthropology and as with the exception of Ling Roth's \"Natives of Sarawak and British North Borneo\" and one or two papers by Hein (Vienna, 1890), the culture-history of the Borneans has never been adequately pictured, it seemed advisable to compile an illustrated catalogue of this fine ethnographical collection, so that those interested in the natives of Borneo might have some sort of picture of them even if a more personal acquaintance was out of the question.\n\nEven in Sarawak, well-protected as it is against European exploitation, great changes have taken place amongst the natives within the last thirty years; the great incursion of Chinese has\nhad its effects; the dominant Sea-Dyak has increased enormously in the Rejang River, driving the Kyan, Kanowit and other tribes less robust than himself before him, so that the ethnographical variety of the chief river of Brooke Low's collecting area is now sadly diminished; finally the influence of the European on the change of native habits must not be left out of account.*\n\nThe catalogue, then, is not begun a day too soon, reliable information on many specimens must be obtained now, or before many years it may be too late. As it is, the Srus, a tribe apparently allied to the Tanjongs, living near Kalaka, have forgotten all their old customs and culture, a fragmentary language alone remaining to suggest a less ignoble past; whilst the Tanjongs themselves, thanks to the gin-bottle and the immorality of their women are rapidly drawing near to the abyss of extinction.\n\nThe project of such a catalogue as this was for some time in my mind, but the ways and means of production were difficult to find. However, at the end of 1902 the Council of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society generously came to the rescue and the catalogue will be published in parts under their auspices.\n\nThe ethnographical collection now to be catalogued cannot claim to be absolutely complete, and there are many specimens scattered amongst European Museums which are unrepresented in the Sarawak Museum. These will be alluded to in the catalogue whenever possible and specimens known to the writer but unrepresented in any museum will also be noted. No particular order in the series of objects described will be observed, but each part will be produced as soon as it is ready. I have been fortunate in securing the collaboration of Dr. C. Hose, Resident of the Baram district, in at least one part of the catalogue and other local authorities have been as generous in supplying me with information as they have been in obtaining specimens for the Museum.\n\n* To give a concrete example of change.\u2014It is no longer easy to obtain specimens of the niabor a variety of short sword formerly much in use amongst the Sea-Dyaks, the jimpul and tilang kamarau are much more common, the former was invented less than 20 years ago, the latter only last year. Numerous other examples might be quoted.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nPART I.\n\nMusical Instruments.\n\nBY R. SHELFORD, M.A., F.L.S., ETC.\n\nCurator of the Sarawak Museum.\n\nThe musical instruments of the Bornean tribes fall naturally into four main groups:\u2014\n\n1. Stringed instruments.\n2. Wind instruments.\n3. Jews harps.\n4. Instruments of percussion.\n\nThey are described in this order. Each group can be subdivided into classes and under the class-headings are described the different 'species' frequently represented by more than one specimen. In addition to describing each specimen fully, I have quoted its number in the Museum catalogue and have recorded how and when it came into the possession of the museum; all measurements are given in centimetres. It will be seen that the Museum is indebted to many friends for valuable specimens; as it would be tedious to detail here all their names, I must express my thanks to them as a collective body; the names of Mr. D. J. S. Bailey, of the Sarawak service and Mr. E. W. Byrde, of the Borneo Co., cannot however pass without special notice, as to these two gentlemen I am indebted not only for many interesting and opportune specimens but also for much valuable information concerning them. My friend Mr. H. Balfour, curator of the Pitts-Rivers Museum, Oxford, has given me much useful advice and help, and his papers on musical instruments have served as models which I fear that nevertheless I have but imperfectly copied.\n\nR A Soc, No. 40, 1904.\nSTRINGED INSTRUMENTS.\n\nThere are four main classes of stringed instruments in use amongst the tribes of Borneo*:\n\nI. Primitive musical bow\u2014perhaps the progenitor of\nII. Fiddles and guitars.\nIII. Upright harps.\nIV. Cylindrical harps.\n\nCLASS I.\u2014PRIMITIVE MUSICAL BOW.\n\nThis instrument is used only by the Tanjongs, a small isolated tribe living at Kapit, Rejang River, Sarawak. It consists of a flattened bow (busoi) with a rattan string laid across a pot of earthenware or metal, the mouth of the pot being closed by a wooden diaphragm (aran); the handle of the bow is grasped in the right hand and the taut bow string is tapped with a short stick held in the left hand; different notes can be produced either by fingering the string or by moving the bow so that different parts of its arc rest on the wooden diaphragm closing the pot. A very fair volume of sound can be produced. Until quite recently no specimens of this interesting musical instrument had found their way to European Museums, but there are now examples in the Anthropological Museums of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The \"Natural History of the Musical Bow\" by H. Balfour (Oxford, 1899) should be consulted for a full and detailed account of the geographical distribution and evolution of this primitive type of musical instrument.\n\n* Dr. A. W. Nieuwenhuis figures in \"In Centraal Borneo\" Vol. II Pl. LVII a Kayan girl beating with a stick on a string stretched longitudinally across a shield and bridged up with two cylindrical wooden plugs at the end; underneath the plate is printed \"Het Voordragen van zangen, de overleveringen van den stam, behelzende\":\u2014i.e. the overture to a song, delivered by the assembled tribe.\n\nBut there is no reference to the illustration in the text and I believe that this is merely an improvised musical instrument, and one seldom in use.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n1. Tanjong\u2014Busoi and Aran.\n\na. (Plate I, fig. 1, upper specimen).\n\nThe busoi is a slightly bowed slat of hard black wood 93\u00b76 cm. long and 4\u00b74 cm. broad about its middle. One end is fretted and moulded and forms the handle, the other end has one border slightly excavated in the way shown in the figure. A strip of split rattan is strung through a hole near the handle and laced through two holes near the other end.\n\nThe aran is a disc of wood, 28 cm. in diam. with a large hole in the centre; the border for a depth of 2\u00b75 cm. has been sloped down and a dog\u2019s tooth pattern is cut in low relief on it, the back ground being stained black with soot or indigo.\n\nCatalogue No. 59. Brooke Low collection.\u2014This specimen has been figured in \u201cThe Natives of Sarawak and British North Borneo\u201d by H. Ling Roth, 1886 Vol. II p. 260, and in \u201cThe Natural History of the Musical Bow\u201d by H. Balfour (1899) p. 69, fig. 49; the latter illustration is taken from a photograph of this specimen in the possession of Sir Hugh Low.\n\nb. (Plate I, fig. 1, lower specimen).\n\nThe busoi is of soft white wood, 82\u00b73 cm. long and 4 cm. broad in the middle. The concave side has a geometric pattern cut in bas-relief, the outstanding background being stained red with dragon\u2019s blood; the handle is unstained, it is moulded and fretted forming an S-shaped curve; the opposite end has its borders notched and curved, it is stained with dragon\u2019s blood and has a rosette (buah trong) cut in it. A strip of rattan is strung through a hole near the handle and laced through two holes near the distal end.\n\nThe aran is a disc of wood 30 cm. in diam. with an incised phyllomorphic pattern surrounding a central rosette; it is not perforated. The rattan plectrum is 31 cm. long. The pot over which the aran is laid is a common bazaar pot of Chinese make, light-blue in colour and glazed; 22\u00b75 cm. diam.; 13 cm. high.\n\nCatalogue No. 1230. [Hon. H. F. Deshon, [P. i. 03]\n\nClass II.\u2014Fiddles and Guitars.\n\nThis main class may be subdivided into two sub-classes:\u2014\nSARAWAK ETHNOGRAPHICAL COLLECTION.\n\n(A) Fiddles with straight wooden stem transfixing a resonator usually made from a hollowed-out coconut shell or gourd, and with one or more strings. Such are the one stringed *enserunai* of the Sea-Dyaks and the *sigittuad* of the Land-Dyaks and the two- or three-stringed *engkerbap* of the Sea-Dyaks. The performer on any of these instruments sits on the ground and holding the stem of the fiddle in his left hand rests the resonator against the calf of his left leg or else grasps with his toes the part of the stem that projects through the resonator; the string is sawed with a very simple bow (*pengayat*) held in the right hand; generally no sound can be produced until the string has been well moistened with saliva and even then the volume of sound is not great. The Sea-Dyaks imitate on the *enserunai* the dirges sung at deaths and at burial.\n\n(B) Guitars, cut out from a solid block of wood, the resonator being hollowed out either from the back or from the front, and with from two to six strings, which are strummed with the fingers. Examples of such instruments are found amongst the Kayans, Kenyahs, Malohs, Dusuns, Malays, and Sea-Dyaks, the latter people having probably borrowed from the Malohs. The fiddle figured by Ling Roth l.c. Vol. II, p. 262 is undoubtedly Chinese; numbers of these are made in Hong-Kong for export and can be bought any day in the Sarawak bazaars. The Malay fiddle figured on p. 266, Vol. II, of Ling Roth's work is Javanese and though the instrument is described as being of Borneo make, it cannot be regarded as typical of Borneo Malays. A very similar specimen bought from a Bugis is in the Raffles Museum, Singapore.\n\nA. FIDDLES.\n\n1. Sea-Dyak\u2014*Enserunai* (Plate I, fig. 2.)\n\na.\u2014(Second specimen from the left.)\n\nStem straight, transfixing the resonator and projecting considerably beyond; the head is flattened and slightly enlarged; its front border notched and moulded. The resonator is half a gourd (*genok selaing*), the bottom is perforated; a diaphragm of monkey skin is lashed on with a rattan binding and tightened up with wedges (Plate VII, fig. 1). The string which is of rattan\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n(rotun segu) at one end is looped over the part of the stem which projects beyond the resonator and passes from this point of attachment to the lower part of the head of the stem which is deeply grooved longitudinally; the string runs along the groove and out through a hole at the side and is then wound round the head (Plate VI, fig. 2); a notch on each side of the groove is evidently intended for the reception of a cross-bridge. There is no bridge for the string opposite the resonator. A bracing string of grass is present. The bow is of bamboo with a grass string. Total length of fiddle 68 cm.; diameter of resonator 9\u00b75 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 55. Brooke Low Collection.\n\nb. Stem straight of a hard dark wood, transfixing resonator and projecting considerably beyond. The head is not expanded; the front of the stem has a deep longitudinal groove for the greater part of its length; there are some shallow transverse grooves and incised lines distad and proximad of the longitudinal groove by way of decoration. The resonator is half a gourd, closed by a diaphragm of wood luted on with dammar, the bottom is perforated. The rattan string at one end is looped round the part of the stem that projects beyond the resonator, at the other it is wound round a slip of wood driven transversely through the stem (Plate VII, fig. 3) there are notches on each side of the groove for the reception of a cross-bridge. Two bracing strings of grass. Bow of bamboo; with grass string. Total length 60.5 cm., diam. of resonator 11.5 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 56. Brooke Low collection. This specimen has been figured by Ling Roth (l. c. Vol. II, p. 260).\n\nc. (1st specimen on right). Stem straight, hemispherical in section, of a brown soft wood, transfixing resonator and projecting considerably beyond it, the head of the stem is enlarged flattened and bent forward at an angle to the stem, each side is carved in low relief with a phyllomorphic pattern and painted in three colours, red, yellow, and green. The resonator is half a cocoa-nut shell closed by a diaphragm of wood luted on with dammar; one of the \"eyes\" of the cocoa-nut has been bored forming an orifice at the bottom of the resonator. The\nrattan string at one end is looped round the part of the stem that projects beyond the resonator, the other passes into a groove and round a tuning peg that traverses the stem just below the head. Bridge missing; a long and stout bamboo bow with rattan string. Total length 78 cm; diameter of resonator 11.5 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 974. Brooke Low collection.\n\nd. (2nd specimen from right). Stem straight, flattened, of hard brown wood; it transfixes the resonator but does not project much beyond; the head is enlarged, its front edge is notched and carved. The resonator is made from a section of bamboo, cut just above and just below a node; the septum of the bamboo is perforated with a star-shaped hole; the top of the resonator is covered with a diaphragm of skin lashed on with rattan (Plate VII, fig. 1); the plaited band of rattan (c.) encircles the resonator at the zone of the leaf-scars. The single rattan string is at one end looped over the stem in the usual manner, at the other end is lashed round the lower end of the head, passing through a hole in the front border; there is no tuning peg. There is a wooden bridge shaped like an inverted V, resting on the diaphragm of the resonator and a grass bracing string. The bow is of rattan with a string made from a strand of the stem of the bracken, *Pteris aquilina*. Total length 59.7 cm.; diameter of resonator 6.2 cm.; height of resonator 7 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1228. D. J. S. Bailey, Esq. [P]; from the head waters of the Undup River.\n\ne. (1st specimen on left). Stem of soft wood, almost square in transverse section; it transfixes and projects beyond the resonator; the head is much enlarged, flattened laterally and bent back at an angle to the rest of the stem; on each side a phyllomorphic pattern (*resum=Gleichenia dichotoma*) is carved in deep relief. The resonator is half a cocoanut shell, one of the \"eyes\" at the bottom has been perforated; the mouth is covered with a diaphragm of monkey skin with the hair still on fastened with rattan lashings in the usual manner (Plate VII, fig. 1) The single rattan string at one end passes through a hole pierced in the part of the stem that projects beyond the resonator\nand is prevented from slipping through by a knot; the other end is attached to the tuning peg; this transfixes the head just above the angle, and in order to expose a length of peg round which to wind the string a deep short longitudinal groove is cut in the anterior face of the head, into this the string runs, is wound round the peg, passes out through the peg hole and is knotted to the peg outside the groove (Plate VII, fig. 4). A wooden inverted V-shaped bridge is set on the diaphragm and a small slip of wood is thrust under the string just before it enters the tuning-peg groove. There is a bracing string of grass. The bow is of bamboo with a grass string. Total length 83.5 cm; diam. of resonator 12.5 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1229. D. J. S. Bailey, Esq. [P. ii. 03].\n\nExcept that there is only one string this instrument might be called an engkerbap, the shape and carving of the head of the stem being very characteristic of that instrument. From the Undup River.\n\n2. Land-Dyak\u2014Sigittuad or Sigitot. (Plate VII, fig. 7.)\n\nStem a length of bamboo (tongon). Resonator a hollowed-out coconut shell with the top third cut off, it is transfixed by a piece of wood (benoah) which then passes a short way up the cavity of the bamboo stem; in the bottom of the coconut shell is pierced a quincunx of holes; the top is covered by a circular sheet of sago-palm leaf, which is not secured in any way. There is one tuning peg (than) which transfixes the stem back to front not from side to side as in the enserunai. The single string (o\u00fci) which is the adventitious root of some epiphytic plant is knotted at one end of the piece of wood transfixing the resonator, at the other it is wound round the tuning peg. A triangular block of wood (tikyer) stands on the diaphragm and serves to bridge up the string. There is a small bow of bamboo with a string made from a strand of the stem of the common bracken, Pteris aquilina. Total length 62 cm. From the village of Krokong, Upper Sarawak.\n\nCatalogue No. 1277. E. W. Byrde, Esq. [P. vij. 03]\n\nThe instrument is of very simple construction, in fact it was made in about half-an-hour, the taut string serves to keep everything together, if this is slackened the diaphragm slips off\nthe resonator and the resonator itself becomes detached from the bamboo stem. The Krokongs occasionally make more finished fiddles than the one described above, but there are no specimens of such in the Sarawak Museum nor have I ever seen one; in some instances the head of a *sigittuad* stem may be carved to resemble a hornbill\u2019s head.\n\n3. Sea-Dyak\u2014Engkerbap.\n\nStem straight of a soft wood, transfixing resonator and projecting slightly beyond; the resonator is half a coconut shell with a diaphragm of lizard (*Varanus salvator*) skin, secured by rattan lashings and wedges in the usual manner. The head of the stem resembles that in the *enserunai* No. 1229; the pattern has been painted red, blue, green and yellow. The two strings of split rattan are at one end tied to that portion of the stem which projects beyond the resonator, at the other they pass round two tuning pegs which are fitted as in the *enserunai* No. 1229. (Plate VII, fig. 4) The bow (*pengayat*) is of rattan with a grass string. Total length 97 cm. From the Batang Lupar. Catalogue No. 1342. D. J. S. Bailey, Esq. [P. 29, ix, 03]\n\nB. GUITARS.\n\n1. Kyan\u2014Sapeh (Pl. II, fig. 4.)\n\nTwo-stringed guitar strummed with the fingers. A large heavy instrument cut out of a block of *tapang* wood. The resonator has been hollowed out at the back to a depth of from 7 cm. to 10 cm.; the cavity is not closed by a diaphragm. The face of the resonator is somewhat convex; it is decorated with seven white discs formed of ground *Trochus* shells and at the base with an incised geometrical design typically Kayan in character arranged on either side of a pointed ridge. The stem is straight, thickening to the head which is carved to represent the head of a dragon (*asu*); a shell disc is let into the top of the dragon\u2019s head. There are two tuning pegs, one end of these is roughly shaped, the other is split to receive the strings which pass through holes in the stem (Plate VII, fig. 5) and so into the split ends of the pegs. The strings are of rattan,\nat their lower ends they pass through holes in the face of the resonator and are knotted to prevent slipping through. Bridge lost.\n\nTotal length, 12\u00b75 cm.; length of stem, 46\u00b78 cm.; greatest breadth of resonator, 28\u00b78 cm.; breadth of resonator at the bottom 19 cm.; greatest depth of resonator 14\u00b73 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 52. Brooke Low collection.\n\nA diminutive model of a very similar instrument is hung on the wall of a model of a Kajaman house (Belaga, Rejang R.) recently presented to the Sarawak Museum. Ling Roth, (l. c. Vol. II, p. 261) figures a similar instrument in the British Museum. This however was made by the Long Wai, who dwell on the Mahakkam River, they are grouped by Dr. C. Hose amongst the Kayans; the Long Wai name for this instrument is impai.\n\n2. Dusun.\u2014Two stringed guitar (? native name) (Pl. VII, fig. 6).\n\nThis is carved from a block of soft white wood. The stem is long, square in section about its middle, expanding at its junction with the resonator and at the head which is carved and moulded; on its front face five little blocks of wood are pegged on (3-3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) cm. apart), apparently to mark the fingering of the strings. The resonator which is somewhat boat-shaped is hollowed out from the back and the cavity is closed by a sheet of sago-palm leaf laced on with rattan stitchings to the wood. Both the front and the back of the resonator are perforated in their centres by two triangular holes, the apices of the triangles being conjoined. Part of the resonator is not hollowed but is produced distally as a solid piece, curved slightly upwards. A shaped ridge of wood terminating proximally in a square block is left on the face of the resonator; the two brass-wire strings are looped through holes in the ridge, pass through the square block up to the lower end of the head which they pierce and then are wound round two tuning pegs.\n\nTotal length 119\u00b75 cm.; length of stem, 67 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1274. Collected by the late Dr. A. Dennys Acquired by exchange from the Raffles Museum, Singapore.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 40, 1904\nA somewhat similar specimen is figured by Whitehead in \"Exploration of Mount Kina Balu,\" (1893) p. 108.\n\n3. Maloh and Sea-Dyak\u2014Blikan.\n\na. Maloh\u2014Blikan (Plate II, fig. 3). Two-stringed guitar cut from a block of soft white wood. The resonator is hollowed out from the front and the cavity is closed by a tightly-fitting wooden lid, securely pegged on; this lid is decorated with a geometrical design painted in indigo. The end of the resonator is produced and solid, it has been whittled and fretted to form a scroll. Four triangular holes, their apices conjoined are cut in the lid of the resonator and a block of wood is left attached to the lid just distad of the four holes. The stem is quite straight, somewhat triangular in section, it is very deep from front to back in its lower (distal) portion where it joins the resonator and the back of it here is scrolled and decorated with lines of black dammar; three chevrons of dammar are painted across the back of the stem higher up. The proximal end is expanded into a head carved to represent the head of a hornbill (*Buceros rhinoceros*) with a seed in its mouth, the neck is stained black. Two tuning pegs transfix the stem below the head. The two rattan strings distally are fastened to two little wooden spikes stuck into the wooden block on the lid of the resonator; proximally they pass through holes in the stem just over the tuning pegs, out through the tuning-peg-holes and are gripped in the split-ends of these pegs (Plate VII, fig. 5). Total length 89.8 cm.; length of stem 52 cm.; breadth of resonator 15.5 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 54. Brooke Low collection. Brooke Low (quoted by Ling Roth l.c. Vol. II, p. 262), describes a blikan in use amongst Saribas and Kalaka Sea-Dyaks; in this, the head\n\n* The Malohs whose headquarters appear to be the Kapuas river, Dutch Borneo, are an unsettled wandering people who frequently come over into Sarawak for trading purposes. Dr. A. C. Haddon, F.R.S., who measured 7 individuals finds that these had an average cephalic index of 76.2; he does not group them in any of the five classes into which he divides the natives of Sarawak, but it is likely that they fall into the Kenyah-Kayan division (cf. A sketch of the Ethnography of Sarawak, Haddon, Archivio per l'Antropologia et l'Etnologia, Vol. XXXI, 1901).\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nof the stem is actually formed from the bill of a hornbill glued on to the stem, and is not a carved representation of a hornbill's head as in the Maloh specimen described above.\n\nHose and McDougall, in a paper\u2014\"The Relations between Men and Animals in Sarawak\" (Journ. Anthropol. Institute. Vol. XXXI, 1901. p. 198) write:\u2014\u201cThe hornbill must be included among the sacred birds of the Iban (i.e. Sea-Dyaks), although it does not give omens. On the occasion of making peace between hostile tribes, the Ibans sometimes make a large wooden image of the hornbill and hang great numbers of cigarettes on it, and these are taken from it during the ceremony and smoked by all the men taking part in it.\u201d Smaller figures of the hornbill (*Penchalong\u2014Buceros rhinoceros*) are suspended in Sea-Dyak houses during harvest feasts and food is either put into the mouths of the figures or else hung beneath them, (cf. Ling-Roth l. c. Vol. I, p. 256). There are several examples of these *Penchalong* in the Sarawak Museum; the birds are invariably represented as holding one or more seeds in their beaks. Amongst the Kenyahs the hornbill *Anorrhinus comatus* gives omens of minor importance. It is not surprising that so important a bird should figure in the decorative art of the Borneans.\n\nb. Sea-Dyak\u2014*Blikan*. Very similar to the preceding specimen, but roughly made and undecorated with carving or paint. The shape of the head suggests that it was intended eventually to carve it into a representation of a hornbill\u2019s head.\n\nTotal length, 79 cm. Length of stem, 52 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1341. D. J. S. Bailey, Esq. [P. 25, viij. 03].\n\nFrom the Batang Lupar.\n\nIt is highly probable that the Sea-Dyaks borrowed this instrument and its name from the Malohs; some of them at any rate assert so much.\n\n5. Malay\u2014*Gambus*, six-stringed mandolin, (Plate II, fig. 5).\n\nThe instrument is cut out from a block of *mirabou* (*Afzelia bijuga*) wood and is shaped like the European mandolin, i.e. the stem passes insensibly into the resonator and the shape of the instrument is that of a pear longitudinally bisected. Both the stem and the resonator are hollowed out from the front; the\ncavity of the stem is closed by a piece of wood nailed on, the cavity of the resonator by a diaphragm of skin, edged with blue cloth and nailed to the sides with brass-headed nails. The back of the resonator is perforated with a circular hole and the cover of the stem near its junction with the resonator is similarly perforated. This orifice is surrounded by incised lines forming a conventional flower design. A rectangular block of wood is driven into the lower (distal) end of the resonator and through holes in this the strings pass to be attached to a cross bar of wood at its back. The stem is expanded proximally to form a curved head, the cavity of the stem is continued up into the lower part of the head, but not only is not closed in front, but the back of the head is here cut away leaving the two sides only, these are perforated with six holes for the tuning pegs; the rest of the head is solid and its sides are decorated with a phyllomorphic pattern in deep relief, in front with a phyllomorphic design in shallow relief and three brass headed nails. There are six tuning pegs (peturan) and six cotton strings. An inverted V shaped bridge rests on the diaphragm.\n\nTotal length 93 cm.; greatest breadth of resonator 16\u00b79 cm. Catalogue No. 1207. [Pd. xii. 02.] It appears probable that this instrument has been borrowed from the Arabs. There is a similar specimen in the Cambridge Anthropological Museum obtained by W. W. Skeat, Esq., in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nClass III.\u2014Upright Harps.\n\n(Plate II, fig. 6.)\n\nThese instruments, which appear to be used only by Muruts Dusuns (?) and Sea-Dyaks are roughly rectangular boxes (resonators) with a handle and an upright or a handle alone at each end. Strings are stretched in a vertical plane from one handle or upright to the other and are kept taut by upright bridges standing on the lid of the box; the addition of tuning pegs seems to be a modern development. The Murut harp is simpler in construction than the Sea-Dyak forms and its strings being looped through the handles, not tied separately as in the Sea-Dyak harps are in two parallel vertical planes instead of in one. The strings are strummed with the fingers of one hand\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwhilst the lid of the resonator is tapped with the fingers of the other.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the Sea-Dyak *engkratong* at any rate is derived from a stringed instrument like the *enserunai* through a guitar stage. In my private collection is a roughly made Sea-Dyak six-stringed guitar very like the Dusun guitar in shape but with a much longer projection distad of the resonator and this instrument is known to Sea-Dyaks as an *engkratong*. If the stem of this guitar was shortened to correspond in length with the distal projection and if the string were stretched between two uprights in a vertical plane the instrument would become an *engkratong*. It is at least curious that the guitar in this form should be known to the Sea-Dyaks only under the name of *engkratong*, and that it should have disappeared almost entirely from use.\n\nLing Roth (l.c., Vol. II, p. 260), figures a zither from S. E. Borneo in the collection of the Leyden Museum. It is a flat board with eight strings stretched across it and bridged up with a cylindrical piece of wood at each end; there is no information as to the tribe from whom the instrument was obtained. I do not consider that the instrument is connected in any way with the *engkratong*, and have doubts as to the correctness of the locality quoted.\n\n1. Murut\u2014Upright Harp. (Plate II, fig. 6, upper specimen).\n\nA long narrow wooden box, truncate at one end, at the other tapering and produced into a handle; it is cut out of one piece of wood and hollowed out from the bottom, the cavity being closed by a wooden cover pegged on with wooden pegs. The handle is a flattened oval. Two loops of rattan (making four strings) pass through two holes in the handle to the opposite end of the instrument, where they perforate a projection from the wall of the box and are knotted to prevent slipping. The four strings are raised clear from the resonator by two upright bridges set in holes in its roof; the bridges have two notches on each side to receive the strings. The strings were originally of *bemban* (*Donax sp.*) but having been destroyed by insects, are replaced by rattan.\nTotal length, 117\u00b76 cm.; greatest breadth, 7 cm.; depth, 6 cm.

Straits Branch\nCLASS IV.\u2014CYLINDRICAL HARPS.\n\n(Plate III, fig. 7. Plate VI fig. 14).\n\nThese are made from a joint of a large species of bamboo; the strings, four to twelve in number, are cut out from the bamboo but are left attached at their ends and are tightened with slips of wood thrust under them. The septa of the bamboo joint are generally perforated and to increase the resonance of the instrument a longitudinal slit or a hole is cut in it. This class of instrument is in use amongst the Kyans, the Kenyahs, the LongKiputs, the Kadyans, the Dusuns, and the Land-Dyaks. The method of performing on this instrument amongst the Land-Dyaks of the Sadong River is as follows:\n\nThe performer sits on the ground, rests one end of the instrument against the side of his right foot and the back of it against his left thigh; the strings are struck with a short stick held in the right hand and with the left hand the player alternately opens and closes the upper and open end of the instrument; the strings can be tuned by altering the position of the bridges. Several men usually perform together and a sound like distant gongs can be produced by experts; other men accompany with the *lalipok* and *pelonchong*; the former is a portion of bamboo joint shaved down so that the wall is quite thin, one end is open and is struck against some hard substance; the latter is a piece of bamboo joint with a hole cut in the side and it is struck with a stick (Plate VI fig. 14). The Krokong Land-Dyaks still play on these harps at their festivals, the Sadong Land-Dyaks only occasionally play on them and then not seriously, whilst at Quop these instruments are merely toys made and played on by children.\n\n1. Dusun\u2014*Tangkungang*. (Plate III, fig. 7, left hand specimen).\n\nMade from a single joint of bamboo which is cut off flush with the septa so that nothing projects at either end; both the septa are perforated. There were originally five strings arranged more or less equidistantly round the instrument; all but two of the strings broken. Total length 51\u00b74 cm.; diameter, 10\u00b75\ncm.; distance between the strings, (measured along the curve of the bamboo) about 6\u00b75 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 775. Drs G. D. and H. A. Haviland coll. [P. v. 92]. From Kiou, Mt. Kina Balu. The equidistant strings and the absence of projections beyond the septa show the primitive nature of the instrument; it is roughly made and is devoid of ornamentation. I have no information as to the method of performing on this instrument, but I imagine that it is held upright between the feet and that the strings are twanged with the fingers of both hands.\n\nIn the Raffles Museum, Singapore are two cylindrical harps purchased from the late Dr. Dennys and said to be Dusun. These are much more complicated in structure than those in the Sarawak Museum example. Both have twelve strings. In one these are arranged in groups of three, four and five, in the other in a group of seven, with the other five strings round the remaining periphery; in both, the bamboo projects considerably beyond the septa and the upper tubular projection so formed is deeply notched; one of the instruments has two longitudinal slits to increase its resonance.\n\n2. Kanowit\u2014Cylindrical Harp. (Plate III, fig. 7, right hand specimen).\n\nAt one end (the lower) the bamboo is cut off almost flush with the septum, at the other end (the upper) the bamboo projects 4\u00b75 cm. beyond the septum and at one part still further, 11\u00b76 cm., to form a shaped handle 7 cm. long. Round the top of the instrument runs a band of geometric pattern, roughly carved in low relief, the background stained with dragon\u2019s blood. There are only four strings arranged in pairs one on each side of a longitudinal slit in the body of the harp; this slit, which is enlarged at each end in the manner shown in the figure is on the same aspect (the front) of the harp as the handle. A band of plaited rattan encircles the harp at the levels of attachment of the strings to prevent them splitting off. The septa are not perforated. Length (exclusive of the handle) 63 cm.; diameter 11\u00b78 cm.; distance between one pair of strings and the other, measured along the curve of the instrument in front, 11 cm.; measured along the curve at the back 13\u00b75 cm.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nCatalogue No. 563. Brooke Low collection.

Long Kiput*\u2014Pagang or Kantom (Plate III, fig. 7, middle specimen).\n\nThe bamboo projects 9 cm. beyond the septa and is there shaved down so as to be quite thin; on these shaved down portions are carved bands of simple design, such as rows of triangles, rows of dots, rows of oblique bars, the background is whitened with chalk or else the pattern itself is chalked and the background is blackened with indigo or soot. The septa are not perforated. There are six strings arranged in groups of three, one on each side of a middle line. A rattan plait encircles the harp at the level of attachment of the strings to prevent them splitting off. Down the front of the instrument run two short longitudinal slits, end to end; at the upper end of one slit and at the lower end of the other are three incised circles, between the two a group of five incised circles; the cuticle of the bamboo immediately bordering the slits is stripped off and on these areas is carved in relief in one case a chevron pattern in the other a dog\u2019s tooth pattern, the background is black and the relief chalked.

Ling-Roth l. c. vol. II, p. 258). These instruments are generally long and are made from a single joint of bamboo, the distal end is open and the proximal end is closed by the natural septum which is perforated by an irregularly shaped hole; the leaf-scars and the wall of the bamboo immediately adjacent to the septum are shaved and smoothed down.

Bird-Calls.\n\nThough these are not musical instruments in the strictest sense of the word they deserve notice here since morphologically at least they are musical instruments. I know of two distinct forms of bird-calls used in Borneo:\n\n1. Kyan\u2014Bulo wok. (Plate VIII fig. 9.)\n\nThese are constructed on the same principle as the bamboo flageolets of type D, but they are made of a larger species of bamboo and are much shorter. With these the Kyans imitate the cry of the owl *Ninox scutulata* and the cry of the gibbon *Hylobates mulleri*.\n\na. Distal end open, proximal end closed by the natural septum, the bamboo not cut flush with this but projecting almost as far proximad of it as it does distad; in this proximal portion a large hole is bored, the very large sound-hole is bored just distad of the septum and leading to it from the other hole on the outside is a wide gutter or groove roofed over with a slip of bamboo luted on with dammar. The instrument is decorated with a characteristic Kyan design carved in low relief. Length 12\u00b77 cm.; diam. 5\u00b71 cm.; diam. of sound-hole 2\u00b73 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1289. [Acquired by exchange from Dr. C. Hose. ix. 03]. From the Baram river.\n\nb. The distal end open, proximal end closed by the natural septum. The bamboo projected considerably proximad of this but nearly all has been cut away leaving only a small flange in which a hole is bored (see figure); the sound hole and directive duct as in the preceding example. The instrument, which is not ornamented in any way, is illustrated on Plate VIII, fig. 9. Length (including flange) 13\u00b75 cm.; diam. 4\u00b79 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1290. [Acquired by exchange from Dr. C. Hose ix 03]. From the Baram river.\n\nThe Sea-Dyaks, Kenyahs, Kadyans and Muruts employ an interesting form of bird-call for attracting within reach pigeons\nand ground-doves. It consists of a section of a large species of bamboo, with a sound-hole bored in it and with one end open, the other closed by the septum; to this section of bamboo a long bamboo stem, with the septa broken through so that a long tube is formed, is obliquely attached so that a current of air directed down the tube impinges against the edge of the sound-hole bored in the bamboo section. The hunter conceals himself amongst herbage or in a leafy shelter and scatters some grain around, and then blows his call; if any bird comes within reach it is captured by a noose at the end of a long stick, the noose being generally spread round the mouth of the bird-call; sometimes the birds are limed. The bird-call is, in fact, a wind-instrument with a directive duct (the bamboo tube) attached to it and falls into Class IV in the classification given above. Ling-Roth (l. c. vol. p. 44) gives a good figure of a Murut bird-call and quotes Burbidge's account of its use.\n\n2. Sea-Dyak\u2014Bumbun. (Plate VIII fig. 10)\n\na. Bamboo section of 6 cm. diameter and 51 cm. in length with one end closed by the natural septum the wall not cut flush with this but projecting considerably proximad of it, the other end open and very obliquely truncate so that a projecting spout is produced. The sound hole is bored at a distance of 10\u00b75 cm. from the septum on the distal side. The portion of the bamboo projecting proximad of the septum is vertically transfixed by a wooden upright with a large circular hole in it. The bamboo tube is 233\u00b75 cm. long; it passes through the hole in the wooden upright and is lashed to the bamboo section by rattan; its distal end is obliquely truncate and fits the curvature of the bamboo section leaving only a narrow passage through which the current of air passes to impinge against the edge of the sound-hole; the joint is made secure by a luting of dammar.\n\nCatalogue No. 686. Ven. Archdeacon J. Perham [P.]\n\nb. A very similar specimen, but the spout-like projection of the bamboo section much more pronounced.

Proximal end very obliquely truncated, the opening filled by a plug of wood which has been grooved to form the directive duct; distal end cut square, the wall of the flageolet projects beyond the node but the septum has been broken through. Sound-hole large; there are eight stops, seven on the same side as the sound-hole, one is on the opposite side, they are about 1\u00b75 centim. apart, uppermost 17 centim. from sound-hole. Five bands of tin encircle the instrument in the interspaces between stops 2 to 7; the rest of the instrument is covered with phyllomorphic patterns carved in low relief, the background being stained red with dragon\u2019s blood. Length 32 centim.; diam. 1\u00b76 centim.\n\nCatalogue No. 1044. Presented to the Museum by a Sea-Dyak boy at the S. P. G.

From Kabong, Saribas River.\n\nCLASS VI.\n\nPIPES\u2014With single \"beating\" reed (Clarionet type).* (Plate VIII fig. 13.)\n\nI long believed that this extremely primitive form of reed instrument was non-existent in Borneo; it is true that St. John (quoted by Ling-Roth l.c. Vol. II. p. 259) describes a musical instrument in use amongst the Muruts,\u2020 which appears\n\n* For an interesting account of wind-instruments of this class see H. Balfour \"The Old British Pibcorn or Hornpipe and its affinities\" (Journ. Anthropol. Inst. Nov. 1890). Mr. Balfour figures and describes reed-pipes from England, Grecian Archipelago, Egypt and India; nearly all are double pipes like the Bornean simpler instrument, but they all are probably derived from a single pipe cut from a cornstalk, reed or bamboo. Mr. Balfour's quotations from Vergil, Chaucer, Spenser and Shakespeare are very much to the point.\n\n\u2020\"Two thin bamboos, about twelve inches long, were fastened very neatly side by side; in one was cut four holes like those in a flute, while the other had a piece of grass inserted in the lower end. A slight incision was then cut across both towards the upper portion. The performer thrust this instrument rather deep into his mouth and blew, and then, with the aid of tongue, fingers and moving the grass, produced some very agreeable and wild tunes.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nto have some simple sort of vibratory apparatus, but the description is rather vague so that it is not easy to recognise the construction of the instrument from it. Recently Mr. E. W. Byrde presented to the Sarawak Museum two primitive bamboo pipes with \"beating\" reeds from the Land-Dyaks of Upper Sarawak and later I myself had the opportunity of seeing similar instruments played by Land-Dyaks of the Upper Sadong district. I have now no doubt that St. John's description of the Murut pipe applies to an instrument entirely similar to the Land-Dyak examples. No other tribes in Borneo but these two\u2014Muruts and Land-Dyaks\u2014appear to employ this instrument.\n\n1. Land-Dyak \u2014Serubayi or Serun\u00e9.\n\n   a. (Plate VIII fig. 13.)\n\n   Two slender tubes of bamboo bound together with a grass strapping; the proximal ends are closed by the natural septa and the wall of the tubes has been pared down for a length of about 7 centim. so as to be quite thin; a vibrating tongue (jorah) has been cut in this part of the wall in each tube by slitting from above downwards a slender strip) thus forming a \"beating\" reed; a fine hair is tied round one pipe to restrict the play of the tongue. One of the tubes, known as the laki or male tube is provided with five stops (quayet) about 2\u00b76 centim. apart, the other, known as the puan or female tube, has none. The laki has a short length of bamboo (tubu) fitted over its distal end whilst the distal end of the puan or drone-pipe is obliquely truncated. Length of laki 49\u00b71 cm.; length of drone-pipe 37 cm.\n\n   Catalogue No. 1275. E. W. Byrde, Esq. [P. 6. vii. 03.]\n\n   b. A very similar specimen, but each pipe has a short length of bamboo fitted over its distal end; length of laki 46 cm. length of drone-pipe 40 cm.\n\n   Catalogue No. 1276. E. W. Byrde, Esq. [P. 6. vii. 03.]\n\n   Both of these come from Krokong village, Upper Sarawak, and are known as Serubayi. The note of the drone-pipe is supposed to be the same as the note of the laki when all the stops but the fourth are closed, and in order to tune the pipes either\na length of bamboo is added to one or to both or the distal end of one is obliquely truncated, thus practically reducing its length. If in spite of these devices the pipes are still out of tune a length of grass or wood splinter (adjok) is pushed up the drone-pipe and moved up and down until the correct note is hit off. Mr. Byrde informs me that one of the specimens just described was cut to almost accurate lengths and required no tuning with the adjok.\n\nc. Very similar to the two preceding specimens, the laki, however, has only four stops about 3 centim. apart, the drone-pipe is pierced with five stops but they have all been plugged up with wax. The distal ends of the pipes are cut square and are not fitted with lengths of bamboo. Length of laki 43\u00b75 cm.; length of drone-pipe 38\u00b77 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1324. [Pd. viii. 03.]\n\nFrom Piching village, Upper Sadong. Known as Serun\u00e9. The performer on this instrument tuned it by thrusting a piece of grass up the drone-pipe and moving it up and down until he hit off the correct note. As the vibrating tongues are cut at some little distance from the proximal ends of the pipes, these have to be thrust well into the mouth; a continuous blast was given by inhaling with the nostrils and blowing into the instrument with the mouth simultaneously, just as in using the chemist's blowpipe.\n\nThe Land-Dyaks of Quop, Sarawak river, also play these pipes; they always leave the proximal ends open and close them, when playing, with the tongue, the 'beating' reed is cut much closer to the proximal end than in Krokong or Sadong examples; sometimes three pipes are bound together, two being drone-pipes. A good set will be kept in a bamboo full of water, as the pipes are generally made from fresh-cut bamboo stems and when they become dry the tongues will not vibrate effectively.\n\nClass VII.\n\nMOUTH-ORGANS\u2014with single 'free' reed. (Plate III fig. 9).\n\nThese instruments, which are figured in almost every book on Borneo, consist of a hollowed gourd with a long neck the\nmouth piece of the instrument; into the gourd are set six to eight bamboo tubes, the joint being made air-tight with a luting of dammar; the tubes are closed at their lower ends but into each near its lower end *is let a small frame of apeng palm wood (Arenga sp.) or of brass with a vibrating tongue (Plate VII fig. 10); each tube has a stop and if these are not closed by the fingers no sound can be produced by blowing into the neck of the gourd; the tubes are of unequal length and are tuned by being cut more or less obliquely at their upper ends, and one is generally much longer than the others.\n\nThis form of mouth-organ seems to be essentially a Mongolian type very similar instruments being found in China (the Seng or Cheng), Japan and Siam; Hein (Die Bildenden K\u00fcnste bei den Dayaks auf Borneo. Vienna, 1890 p. 116 fig. 78,) figures a Chinese Seng, a mouth-organ of the Mrung of India and a Kyan mouth-organ, and notes that all are constructed on essentially the same principle, he does not, however, describe the form of the vibratory apparatus in any of these instruments so it is quite possible that the Mrung mouth-organ is furnished with 'beating' reeds instead of 'free' or 'framed' reeds.\n\nA good figure of a Kyan youth playing on a mouth-organ is given in \"In Central Borneo\" by Dr. A.W. Nieuwenhuis, Vol. II. pl. lxxxviii.\n\nThe instruments are played more by suction than by blowing. The Bornean tribes who use this instrument are the Kyans, Kenyahs and allied tribes, the Dusuns, Punans and the Sea-Dyaks, it is almost certain that the latter and very probable that the Punans have borrowed this instrument from the Kyans or Kenyahs.\n\n1. Kyan\u2014Klerdi.\n\na. (Plate III fig. 9 right hand specimen).\n\nOf large size; six bamboo tubes open at the top are inserted into a large hole cut in a hollow gourd (labu ayer genok,) the joint being rendered air-tight by a luting of dammar;\n\n* i.e. in that portion of the tube inside the gourd.\nthe gourd has a long curved neck which forms the mouth-piece of the instrument. One of the bamboo tubes is 130 centim. long from its point of insertion into the gourd, its top is slightly obliquely truncate, its note is lower C; another is 75\u00b75 centim. long with the top cut square and its note is lower E; a third is 75 centim. long, with note lower F; a fourth 74\u00b76 centim. long with note lower G; a fifth is 74 centim. long but is so obliquely truncate that its functional length may be reckoned as 56\u00b78 centim. only, its note is middle B; the sixth is very similar but its length may be reckoned at 55\u00b72 centim. with the note middle C. The bundle of tubes is bound together by an encircling band of plaited rattan. A cap of bamboo cut from a node, with a long projecting tongue rests on the top of the longest tube, to the lower end of the tongue is attached a string tied at its other end to a plaited band of rattan that slips freely over the bundle of tubes, the outside of the cap has a frill of shavings scraped partially off it; when the cap is pulled down hard over the top of the long tube the note of that tube is rendered more resonant. Total length (in a straight line) 119\u00b73 cm.; length of gourd (in a straight line) 23\u00b78 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1085. [Pd. 10. x. 00].\n\nThis specimen is in good working order and as it has not been dissected it is impossible to say whether the vibratory apparatus is of brass or of palm-wood. Ling Roth (l.c. vol. II p. 259) figures an almost identical specimen and gives the notes produced by it.\n\nb. Very similar to the preceding, but in bad condition when received and it has been dissected to exhibit its construction. The gourd has a star-shaped hole cut in it to receive the tubes. One of the tubes is 72 centim. long, the rest vary between 60 centim. and 60\u00b75 centim. two are very obliquely truncated at their top ends. The vibratory apparatus is made of apeng palm (Arenga sp.) the tongues have each a little knob on their ends (Plate VII fig. 10) to increase their range of vibration.\n\nCatalogue No. 1246 Hon. C. A. Bampfylde. [P. 26. ii. 03].\n2. Punan\u2014Mouth-Organ.\n\nThe gourd of the preceding specimens is replaced by two hollowed pieces of wood, joined together with a luting of dammar and three stitches of rattan; the two halves have been shaped to form a very fair imitation of a gourd with a long neck. The usual six tubes are let into this sham gourd and luted with dammar. The longest tube measures from its point of insertion into the gourd 67\u00b75 centim.; its top is slightly obliquely truncate and it is covered by a bamboo cap like that of No. 1085, its note is middle A flat. Three tubes are shorter their lengths varying from 46\u00b77 centim. to 47\u00b72 centim. their tops are cut square and their notes are middle B, middle C (not quite true) and middle D. Another measures 46\u00b74 centim.; but it is very obliquely truncate so that its functional length may be reckoned at 34\u00b73 centim.; its note is upper F. The sixth tube is 43\u00b78 centim. with functional length of 33\u00b75 centim. and note upper G. Total length (in a straight line) 72 centim.\n\nCatalogue No. 1260. [Pd. iii. 03].\n\nThe Punans are a nomadic jungle tribe who neither plant nor sow; having probably borrowed the idea of the mouth-organ from neighbouring Kyans or Kenyahs, it was necessary to make imitation gourds of wood as they have no real gourds of their own.\n\n3. Sea-Dyak\u2014Engkerurai. (Plate III fig. 9 left hand) specimen.\n\nMuch smaller than the Kyan klerdi. The longest tube measures 67\u00b75 centim. the others 44 centim. to 44\u00b75 centim. two of these are very obliquely truncate. The bundle of tubes is bound round a central upright of wood by a band of plaited rattan. The vibratory apparatus is of brass. The instrument is not in working order. Length (in straight line) 70 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 61. Brooke Low collection.\n\nThe Sea-Dyak mouth-organ is generally much smaller than the Kyan one; the longest reed is usually provided with a cap of bamboo to act as resonator, but the most efficient resonator that I have seen was a small tin through the bottom of which the\nlong tube passed. Ling-Roth (l.c. vol. II p. 259) figures a Dyak engkerurai with seven reeds and states:\u2014\"Some of the notes appear to be FACF\u2014F octave nearly; two holes in one reed, note unascertainable; two reeds appear to have no note [? defective vibratory apparatus. R.S.] Longest reed (one which has no note) to junction with gourd, 31 in.; diam. of gourd, 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. (Edinboro' Mus).\"\n\nThe Kenyah mouth-organ is known as Slidap. The Dusun mouth-organ has eight reeds set into the gourd in two rows of four, four are short and equal, four are longer and unequal, there are no stops but the fingering is performed on the ends of the four equal short pipes, the others acting as drone-pipe (cf. Ling-Roth l.c. vol. II p. 260).\n\nThere is no specimen of a Dusun mouth-organ in the Sarawak Museum.\n\n**Jews-Harps.**\n\nThe Jews-harp of the Borneans are made either of Palm wood such as Arenga sp. (*Aping*), *Arenga saccharifera* (*ijoh*) and *Orania macrocladus* (*ibul*) or else of brass. In all, sound is produced by causing the tongue of the instrument to vibrate, either by jerking upon a string attached to one end of the instrument or else by jarring the frame of the instrument by repeated taps with the finger. \"A single note is thus produced, and, in order to gain a variety of notes, the instrument is held to the performer's mouth, which also performs the function of a resonator. To quote Sir George Grove, 'A column of air may vibrate by reciprocation with a body whose vibrations are isochronous with its own, or when the number of its vibrations are any multiple of those of the original sounding body. On this law depends the explanation of the production of sounds by the Jews-harp. The vibration of the tongue itself corresponds with a very low sound; but the cavity of the mouth is capable of various alterations; and when the number of vibrations of the contained volume of air in any multiple of the original vibrations of the tongue, a sound is produced corresponding to the modification of the oral cavity.'\" (H. Balfour Journ. Anth. Inst. Vol. XXXII p. 169, 1902). The Sea-Dyaks employ wooden and brass\n\nJour. Straits Branch\njews-harps which are caused to sound by jerks on a piece of string attached to one end of the frame of the instrument, the other end of the frame is held between the finger and thumb of the other hand. The Dusuns employ a wooden jews-harp but play it by repeatedly striking one end of the frame with the fore finger of the right hand and the Land-Dyaks play on a brass jews-harp in the same way. The Dusun and Land-Dyak jews-harps are produced at one end to form a handle but the Sea-Dyak forms have usually no handle the instrument consisting merely of a tongue and a frame the ends of which are roughly symmetrical.\n\n1 Sea-Dyak\u2014Ruding.\n\na. (Plate V fig. 13, second specimen from the bottom).\n\nMade of apeng wood (*Arenga sp.*) with the cuticle still left on the face of the instrument; the back of the instrument is longitudinally concave and the wood has been scraped down so that it is quite thin except at the ends which are thick and almost flat. The tongue is 8 centim. long its proximal half is 0\u00b75 centim. broad, its distal half only 0\u00b72 centim.; there is a marked 'shoulder' half way down the tongue. The frame follows the outline of the tongue. The ends of the instrument are bluntly pointed. To one end of the instrument a short piece of string with a slender wooden toggle is attached; through a hole in the other end passes a short loop of string, which is stretched taut by the third and fourth fingers of the left hand when the instrument is held ready for playing between the finger and thumb of the same hand. The instrument is contained in a small case of bamboo decorated with a phyllomorphic design in low relief with the background stained red by dragon's blood.\n\nTotal length 10\u00b78 cm.; breath 1\u00b75 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 204.

One end of the frame is cut out into three points, the other end is bifurcated, and the two limbs of the bifurcation are rolled up into spirals; a loop of string passes through a hole at this end, a short string with a brass toggle attached to it passes through a hole at the other end.\n\nLength 9 cm.; breadth 0\u00b78 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1251. From Lobok Antu, Batang Lupar.\n[R. Shelford, Esq. P. 5. iv. 03]\n\nb. (Plate V fig. 13 third specimen from the top).\n\nDiffers from the preceding specimen in being nearly flat; one end is produced to form a sort of handle but it is quite thin and flat and is fretted and cut into a pseudo-phyllomorphic pattern. The opposite end of the instrument is \"stepped\" and a string with a bamboo toggle is passed through a hole here. The tongue does not taper, its proximal half is twice as thick as the distal (cf. *ruding*).\n\nLength 10\u00b71 cm.; greatest breadth, 0\u00b78 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 610. Brooke Low collection.\n\nR A. Soc., No. 40, 1904.\nLing Roth (l. c. Vol. II p. 257) figures a handled brass jews-harp but with a string attached to the frame; it is evidently a Sea-Dyak engsulu but it has been wrongly named rodiung.\n\nThis is one of the musical instruments which Dyaks say are possessed of \"Jako\" i.e. articulate speech; the ensenunai is another but the ruding is not. The engsulu is played by young men and girls who are lovers; a young man desirous of marrying a girl will, previous to matrimony, visit at night his inamorata in her mosquito curtains and will play to her on his jews-harp, she will reply on her jews-harp and it is said that the notes of the instruments can be translated by experts into articulate language in the form of a poem.\n\n**PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS.**\n\nI. Wooden resonators and harmonicums.\n\nII. Metal gongs.\n\nIII. Bells.\n\nIV.

(Plate VI fig. 14).\n\nThese are merely portions of a bamboo joint with the wall scraped quite thin, one end is closed by the septum the other is open. The open end is knocked against some hard substance such as an ironwood post. They are played in accompaniment with the ton-ton (cf. antea p. 17). Length 24\u00b72 cm. and 37 cm. diam. 5 cm. and 5 cm.\n\nCatalogue Nos. 1297 a and b. [Pd. ix. 03.] From the Upper Sadong District.\n\n2. Land-Dyak\u2014Pelonchong. (Plate VI fig. 14).\n\nTwo pieces of bamboo joints, the walls not scraped thin but with a hole cut in one side; one end is closed by the septum\nthe other is open. The instruments are beaten with a short stick to accompany the *ton-ton*. Length 49 cm. and 43 cm. diam 5 cm. and 5.2 cm.\n\nCatalogue Nos. 1298 *a* and *b*. [Pd. ix. 03]. From the Upper Sadong district.\n\n3. Land-Dyak\u2014*Krotong*\u2014Wooden harmonicum.\n\nA set of six slabs of hard red wood (*mellobi*) ranging in length from 49 centim. to 40 centim., in breadth from 7 centim. to 5 centim., in thickness from 3.5 centim. to 1.5 centim. The notes emitted when the slabs are struck do not form a regular scale. Three slabs (*anak*) are marked at one end with a streak of white paint and these give higher notes than the three others (*endor*) which are marked with a cross. The slabs are laid on a block of soft wood or on the legs of the performer and are tapped with two sticks (*bokan*); sometimes two men play, one striking the *anak* the other the *endor*.\n\nCatalogue No. 1280. E. W. Byrde, Esq. [P. 9. vii. 02].\n\nThis example was made at Krokong, Upper Sarawak, and was in use for many years at feasts and funerals. Brooke Low mentions similar specimens, but made also of stone in use amongst the Sea-Dyaks. Burbidge gives an account of a Kadyan \"triangle or its music rather, being represented by two or three steel hatched leads which were laid across laths on the floor and beaten in time with a bit of iron\" (cf. Ling-Roth l.c. Vol. II p. 263).\n\n4. Maloh\u2014*Tengkuang*\u2014(Plate IV fig. 11, left-hand specimen).\n\nA long narrow rectangular block of *tapang* wood with a scroll handle projecting from the left-hand end (upper end in the figure). It is narrower at the top (right-hand side in the figure) than at the bottom, the sides sloping in from a line just below the middle line. A deep longitudinal cavity is scooped out of the block of wood; it slopes up at either end. On one side (that seen in the figure) there is at either end a perpendicular border of phyllomorphic design carved in deep relief whilst a broad horizontal border of incised phyllomorphic design runs along the lower half of the instrument; on the other side the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 40, 1904.\ntwo perpendicular borders consist of incised lines bounding a series of diamond shaped figures, the horizontal border is similar to that on the other side.\n\nThere are two drum sticks also of tapang (*Abauria excelsa*) wood; each is bored at the top with a hole and they were once joined together by a length of string; they are slightly decorated with incised lines but the patterns which it was intended to form have never been completed. Length 61 cm.; breadth at top 7\u00b75 cm.; breadth at bottom 11 cm.; height 22 cm.; length of stick 24 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 57. Brooke Low collection.\n\nThe instrument has been figured by Ling-Roth (l. c. Vol. II p. 263.) A large block of wood shaped like a pig and hollowed out, hangs by the antimony works of the Borneo Co., at Busau, Upper Sarawak; it is beaten to call the men to work and emits a very loud resonant sound; it was made by a Malay.\n\n**Class II\u2014Metal Gongs.**\n\nFrom a native point of view these are the most important of all musical instruments. Formerly certain varieties of gongs were in universal use as currency and at the present day fines levied on natives by the Sarawak Government are paid in many cases in gongs, brass ware, and old jars. The large heavy gongs known as tawaks are worth anything from $30 to $100, not only their weight but their tone and resonance being taken into account by the appraisers. The wealth of a chief consists chiefly of gongs and jars, and his collection of the former, is if he is in prosperous circumstances, always increasing. They are played at ceremonies and festivals of every description and the noise produced by the beating of twenty or thirty gongs all at the same time can be better imagined than described. The Land-Dyaks of Quop have definite names for the different rhythms with which a series of gongs can be beaten and I have no doubt that the same is the case amongst other tribes.\n\nThe four principal varieties of gongs are:\n\n1. **Gongs proper**; large shallow gongs with flat boss or none at all.\n2. *Tawak*; large deep gongs with hemispherical boss.\n\n3. *Chanang*; medium sized gongs with hemispherical boss, sometimes elaborately ornamented.\n\n4. *Kromong*; small gongs with hemispherical boss, always sold in sets of seven or eight and played somewhat like a chime of bells.\n\nAll are made of brass and most are cast by a *cire perdue* process, though the older and more valuable ones have been melted and hammered into shape.\n\nThe place of origin of some specimens is extremely doubtful, but generally speaking the following may be regarded as fairly accurate:\u2014*Gongs* proper come from China, their value is small and but few are bought by Dyaks and other natives; *Tawak* are made in Java and perhaps by Malohs, as already noted their value is considerable; *Chanang* are made in Java, in Kuching by Sarawak Malays, and in Brunei by Brunei Malays, the latter being usually highly ornamental and worth $15 to $25, a Javanese *Chanang* may fetch a very high price; *Kromong* were formerly made in Java but all modern specimens are made chiefly in Kuching by Sarawak Malays, modern specimens are moderate in price.\n\n1. *Gong.* (Plate IV. fig. 12, specimen in the background) large shallow gong of (?) Chinese origin, with a flattened boss. Diam. 66 cm.; depth 8 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1225. [Pd. xi. 02].\n\n2. *Tuwak* or *tetawak.* Large brass gong, said to have been made by Malohs, with large hemispherical boss and slightly raised central area. It is very deep and the sides slope in from front to back. It has been cast and then hammered. Diam. in front 60 cm.; at back 45 cm.; depth 27 cm.; thickness 0\u00b75 cm.; weight 37 lbs.\n\nCatalogue No. 1256. The Sarawak Government. [P. 14, iii. 03].\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 40, 1904.\nThis specimen some years ago was deposited in Sibu fort as a pledge of good faith by a native chief but it was never redeemed; it has been valued by Malays at $70.\n\n3. Brunei Malay\u2014Chanang naga. (Plate VI fig. 15).\n\nBrass gong with hemispherical boss; the face is decorated with two dragons in bold relief and with a geometric pattern round the border and between the dragons in lower relief, the side is also ornamented with a geometric pattern in low relief. The gong is suspended by a chain with two diverging limbs, one of the links in the middle of each diverging limb is cast in the form of a bird and the junction of the diverging limbs with the main chain is marked by a similar but larger link. Diam. in front 49 cm. at back 39\u00b74 cm.; depth 12 cm. Total length of chain 58 cm.; of diverging limbs 35 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1268. [Pd. ii. vi. 03].\n\nThese gongs are cast by a cire-perdue process; a rough model of the gong is first made in wood, over this is spread a layer of wax the surface of which is carved and tooled into the desired pattern, the wax is lifted off the wooden model in two pieces\u2014the front and the side,\u2014these are then joined and backed with more wax, and a mould of clay mixed with sand is built up so as to completely enclose the wax pattern, a small spout being left at one point; the whole is then burnt in a kiln and the melted wax is poured out of the spout of the clay mould and the molten brass poured into it. A new wax pattern has of course, to be made for every gong.\n\nThe dragons certainly suggest a Chinese origin for these gongs, still the dragon is also prominent in Indonesian art so that it would be rash to dogmatize on the subject. The significance of the bird-links in the suspensory chain I have been unable to discover.\n\n4. Sarawak Malay\u2014Chanang.\n\nSmall brass gong with hemispherical boss and raised central area; cast by cire-perdue process in Kuching. Diam. in front 33\u00b79 cm., at back 30\u00b71 cm. depth 7\u00b78 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1208. [Pd. xii. 02].\n5. Sarawak Malay\u2014Kromong. (Plate IV fig. 12).\n\nA set of eight small brass gongs, each with hemispherical boss and slightly raised central area. They rest on strings fastened to the cross-pieces of a long wooden frame and are struck with two wooden beaters. Diam. of largest gong 19\u00b76 cm., of smallest gong 17\u00b78 cm.; all are 6\u00b75\u20146 cm. deep.\n\nCatalogue No. 1209. [Pd. xii. 02].\n\nThese Kromong were cast in Kuching. The process is much the same as that previously described; the wax is spread thinly over a wooden model (chuan) pitted all over with small depressions, the purpose of which is to give an appearance of hammer-marks; the old Javanese Kromong were all melted and beaten into shape and distinctly shewed the hammer-marks all over their surface, and the same appearance is simulated in the modern article. The wax is peeled off the wooden model as already described and enclosed in a mould of clay mixed with sand (tanah batu) with a spout for the exit of the melted wax and the entry of the molten brass. When the gongs are removed from their clay moulds they are roughly smoothed down with a file and are set in a row on a frame like that shewn in the figure, the maker then tunes them by tapping them with a hammer and finally blackens them with a mixture of copper sulphate and an extract of lirang a plant used also medicinally for skin diseases.\n\nCLASS III. BELLS.\n\n1. Brunei Malay\u2014Grunong, cow-bell.\n\nA spheroidal brass rattle flattened from side to side, cast in brass, hollow with a slit running half way round the lower border; the handle of the rattle is in the form of a bird with a ring springing from its back, on each side of the rattle is a snake in bold relief and an outstanding ring; there is a ring just above each end of the slit running round the lower border of the rattle. A small brass sphere inside the hollow of the rattle acts as a clapper.\n\nR. A Soc., No. 40, 1904.\nLength (in a straight line) 9\u00b78 cm.; diam. 6\u00b71 cm. \u00d7 4\u00b78 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1187.\n\nThis is the only form of bell that I have met with in Borneo with the exception of small metal rattles that are worn as ornaments (trimmings to kirtles, buttons to necklets, etc.)\n\n**Class IV. Drums.**\n\nThese are used by every tribe in Borneo; they are played with gongs at feasts and funerals.\n\n1. Land-Dyak (Bukar sub-tribe.)\u2014*Gehong.*\n\nSingle membrane drum made from one and a half joints of a very large species of bamboo; the intervening septum is broken through; one end is open, the other is closed by a diaphragm of monkey\u2019s skin (*Macacus nemestrinus*), secured by rattan in the manner shewn in fig. 1, Plate VII., the loops of rattan however being connected by a transverse double twist of rattan. Height 84 cm.; diam. 12 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1294. [Pd. viij. 03].\n\nFrom Lanchang, Upper Sadoug.\n\nI noted in the rafters of the head-house (*baluh*) at Lanchang village, a very large drum known as *sabang* cut out from a tree trunk, it was at least 5 feet high and 1 foot in diameter, but I was unable to secure it for the Sarawak Museum as it was used only at head-feasts and was regarded as \u201cpemali.\u201d Similar gigantic drums are used at Krokong, Upper Sarawak.\n\n2. Sea-Dyak\u2014*Gendang.* (Plate III fig. 10, left hand specimen).\n\nSingle membrane drum made of a hard black wood, roughly shaped like an hour-glass, hollow throughout, the cavity in shape corresponding to the external form: the lower end is open, the upper is closed by a skin diaphragm secured by rattan lashings and loops; the method of lashing the diaphragm on to the drum-head is slightly different from the usual method and is\nshown on Plate VIII fig. 14, the edge of the diaphragm is not doubled over, the rattan loops pass alternately over and under the encircling band \\(a\\) and then down to and round a plaited rattan band which is prevented from slipping by wedges. Below the plaited rattan band is a raised zone on which is carved in bold relief the following patterns:\n\n1.) A conventional flower *buhu andu*, (*Plukenetia corniculata*).\n\n2.) On each side of this a rough geometrical design, three scrolls in a square.\n\n3.) An intertwined double loop pattern, *ensilup* (i.e. interlocking).\n\nTwelve shirt buttons are let into the centre of (1), two are let into each scroll of (2) and there is one in each loop of (3). Below this zone is a circle of incised triangles, *puchol rebong* (i.e. young shoots of bamboo) and round the foot of the drum runs an incised single loop pattern. Height 18 cm.; diam. at top 13\u00b74 cm.; diam. at bottom 20 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 58. Brooke Low collection.\n\nThe Sea-Dyaks of the Balau River and the Sibuyaus call this instrument *Ketubong*. I have seen specimens with a diaphragm of *Varanus* skin. The performers on this instrument and the Land-Dyak *Gehong* sat cross-legged on the ground, the drum lying across one thigh and kept from slipping by the opposite foot, and the diaphragm was beaten with the tips of the fingers and the palmar surface of one hand.\n\nA Murut *gendang* is figured by Ling Roth (l. c. Vol. II p. 263).\n\n3. Malay\u2014*Gendang prang*.\n\n(Plate III fig. 10, right hand specimen).\n\nDouble membrane drum formerly used in warfare, but now employed at festivals. It is almost cylindrical, hollow throughout and made of *mirabou* wood (*Afzelia bijuga*), it is slightly narrower in diameter at one end than at the other and its greatest diameter is across the middle. Both ends are closed with dia-\nphragms of parchment, secured in the following manner:\u2014the edge of the parchment is gripped between two strips of split rattan encircling the drum, these gripping bands are given a half-turn up, a continuous loop of split rattan is laced through holes in the double fold of parchment (formed by turning up the gripping bands) and passes to the other end of the drum to be similarly laced through holes in the diaphragm there; the adjacent limbs of the loops are braced together by bands of plaited rattan (Plate VIII fig. 15). A small square hole is cut in the side of the drum to increase the resonance and a string sling passes through holes above and below this. Height 53 cm.; diam. at one end 22 cm.; diam. at the other 20 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1227. [Pd. 29. 1. 03].\n\n4. Malay\u2014Gendang rebana. (Plate IV fig. II right hand specimen.)\n\nBowl-shaped drum of mirabou wood, the top is closed by a diaphragm of sheep's skin, the bottom is open. Into the rim of the bottom are driven ten square wooden pegs, their free ends rest on and press against a circle of rattan round which pass the rattan loops that secure the diaphragm; the chief function of this rattan circle and pegs is to act as an insulator, raising the drum from the ground and so increasing its resonance. The diaphragm is secured in the same way as shown in Plate VII. fig. 1, except that the descending loops of rattan are in ten groups of four or five loops, any one group being widely separated from that on either side of it; there are ten such groups and they correspond with the ten wooden pegs in the bottom rim of the drum; further, the edge of the diaphragm is doubled back to cover the rattan lacing and this is kept in position by a single encircling rattan laced through it.\n\nImmediately before use the diaphragm is tightened by pushing between it and the upper rim of the drum from the inside a circle of thick unsplit rattan, known as the sidak; when the drum is not in use the sidak is kept coiled up inside the drum.\n\nHeight 18 cm.; diam. at top, 44\u00b75 cm.; diam. at bottom 24\u00b78 cm.\n\nCatalogue No. 1246. [Pd. 28. 1. 03].\nAddenda.\n\nSince going to press my friend Mr. W. Howell has sent to the Museum a toy musical instrument used by Sea-Dyak children; as it is so very different from every other form of musical instrument found in Borneo, I cannot refrain from adding a brief description of it:\n\nSea-Dyak\u2014Sulieng\u2014toy \u201csqueaker.\u201d\n\nA piece of the stem of a species of Culamus known as Kerniong, 21 centim. long and 1 centim. in diameter; one end is open and cut square, the other is closed by the natural septum, a very narrow crack runs down the whole length of the instrument on one side, in fact it is so narrow as to be hardly perceptible from the outside. A blast of air driven into the tube just forces apart the sides of the crack, but they quickly close again by virtue of their elasticity and curvature. If the pressure of air is maintained they are forced open again, close again and so on; in other words the sides of the tube bordering the crack vibrate and constitute a \u201cpartial\u201d valve through which the air issues in a pulsatory manner producing a loud and penetrating squeak. The instrument may be compared with the trumpet class though in that class the lips of the performer constitute the \u201cpartial\u201d valve, not the walls of the instrument itself. Malays know this instrument as serun\u00e9, the same term as that employed by Land-Dyaks of the Bukar sub-tribe for their pipes with \u201cbeating\u201d reeds.\n\nCatalogue No. 1363. Rev. W. Howell [P. 6. xij. 03].\n\nThe wooden clappers used by Sea-Dyaks are also worthy of note. These instruments, which are known variously as tongkat be-igi, t\u0105ngkat krutak, tugal be-igi, tugal bekurong, and tugal klek, are long staves of hard wood with an enlarged head, the head is hollowed out but a loose block of wood occupies part of the hollow and slides up and down when the staff is shaken; this block is cut out of the head itself, the hollowing of the head and the freeing of the block being negotiated through four longitudinal slits in the head. The staffs are used as padi-dibblers, and they are carried and sounded at intervals by the\nprincipal celebrant at that part of the religious festivals when the Mengap is being recited; they are also carried and rattled by any one when walking in the dark to give notice of his coming to spirits, men and animals.\n\nSea-Dyak\u2014Tongkat hrutak.\n\na. A long staff of hard wood, the lower end thickened and pointed and with an enlarged four-sided head 40\u00b75 centim long; the angles of the head are marked by wide slits, through which the head has been hollowed out, a sliding block of wood 20 centim. long being left in the hollow. The passage of the stem of the staff into the head is sudden and is marked by a little carving and a narrow band of plaited rattan; the top of the head is crowned with a finical and a tuft of grass.\n\nTotal length 239 cm.\n\nFrom the Krian River. I. Kirkpatrick, Esq. [P. 28. xiii. 96.]\n\nCatalogue No. 999.\n\nb. A similar specimen, but the lower end is much thicker and less pointed; the head is round in transverse section and the hollowing of it and the freeing of the sliding block has been conducted through three slits only; the rest of the staff instead of being of equal diameter throughout is marked with seven circular blunt ridges at unequal distances apart; the passage of the stem into the head is very gradual; the head has a long carved finical but no tuft of grass.\n\nTotal length 262 cm.; length of head 36\u00b75 cm.; of sliding block 23\u00b75 cm. From the Lamanak River. Brooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 517.\n\nc. Much shorter specimen, the head rather slender and without a finical, which is replaced by a stout projection; the staff is encircled by several narrow ridges some of which are carved to imitate the nodes of bamboo; there are four slits in the head.\n\nJour.

Diagram illustrating the method by which a skin diaphragm is fastened over a resonator of a fiddle or over a drum. The skin is tightly stretched over the mouth of the resonator and tied with a string (a), the edge of the skin is then turned up and through the double fold so formed is laced a continuous loop of split rattan (b); the lower ends of the loops pass\nround a band of plaited rattan (c) encircling the resonator at the lower level; wedges (d) are driven between this band and the resonator to make all taut.\n\nThis method of securing drum-heads and diaphragms is common all through the Malay Archipelago: I have seen a drum from Timor in the Raffles Museum, Singapore, the diaphragms of which are fastened in identically the same way as this.\n\nFig. 2.

The instrument is fastened at the top of a high tree and the wind blowing across one, or perhaps more, of the holes makes a loud howling noise.\n\nFrom the village of Quop.\n\nTotal length 311\u00b75 cm.; diameter 5\u00b77 cm.\n\nRev. F. W. Nichols [P]\n\nCatalogue No. 1384.\n\nSometimes rather a different instrument is in use; one internode only of bamboo is employed and a large hole is cut in it, the internode spins (vertically) on a pivot and is fitted with a vane so that the sound-hole is always turned at the right angle to the wind from whatever direction it may blow.\n\nThe bull-roarer can hardly be omitted from a catalogue of musical instruments, even though the specimen described below was used, like the bull-roarers of the Malay Peninsula, merely as a scarecrow. A popular account of the bull-roarer is given by Dr. A. C. Haddon in his book \"The Study of Man\" pp. 277-327 and some remarks on the relationship between the bull-roarer and other wind-instruments are given by Mr. H. Balfour in a recent number of the Journal of the Anthropological Institute (Vol. XXXII. pp. 173, 174.)\n\nNarom\u2014bull-roarer.\n\nA flat piece of wood shaped something like a spear-head, 27\u00b72 cm. \u00d7 6\u00b71 cm.; both ends are sharply pointed, but at one end are two projecting \"ears,\" a string passes through a hole\nat this end and serves to attach the piece of wood to a wooden stick, 85 cm. long.\n\nD. A. Owen Esq. [P. 24. v. 01].\n\nCatalogue No. 1121.\n\nDr. C. Hose first discovered the bull-roarer in Borneo in a Kenyah house up the Tinjar River, Baram district and was told that it was used to scare birds off the padi fields; Dr. Hose bought the unique specimen and subsequently showed it to some Narom, a tribe living near Claudetown, Baram River; the Narom stated that they were well acquainted with the instrument and frequently used it; they made several specimens to order, one of which is that described above. The Narom constitute a tribe that falls into the Kalamantan division according to Drs. Haddon and Hose\u2014and so may be considered as amongst the most primitive tribes of Borneo.\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE SOCIETY.\n\nJournal No. 1 to 41, Price to members, $1.00 each.\n\" \" \" \" \" to non-members, $2.50 each.\n\nEssays Relating to Indo-China, 4 Vols., Price $2.50 each.\n\nThe Hikayat Abdullah.\n\nThe Wai-Seng Lottery, by G.

Wise and Mr. James Driver.\n\nOnly one Journal No. 39 was published during the year but another will be shortly in the hands of the members. An important article by Mr. R. Shelford of Sarawak Museum on the Musical Instruments of Borneo illustrated by a large number of plates will follow as soon as it can be printed.\n\nReferring to the resolution passed at the general meeting last year to procure and publish Malay Manuscripts, the Council desire to state that they have kept the matter in view, but up to the present no Manuscripts considered worthy of publication have as yet been obtained. Two important Manuscripts however have recently been offered to the Society by Mr. George Maxwell, and it is hoped they may appear in the course of this year.\n\nThe Library was rearranged and is being catalogued. Many books, journals and pamphlets were received and a number were bound.\n\nDuring the year a letter was received from the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal stating that the members of that Society had decided that the members of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society should have the right of admission to the Society's meetings whenever they were in Calcutta.\n\nThe Society has now attained its twenty-fifth year having been founded on Nov. 4, 1877, and it may be noted that in spite of early prophecies of its soon becoming extinct it has steadily thrived to the present day.\n\nThe Treasurer's statement of accounts is appended.\n## HONORARY TREASURER'S ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR 1903.\n\n| Balances brought forward from 1902:\u2014 | $ | c. | $ | c. |\n|--------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|\n| Mercantile Bank, Fixed Deposit       | ... | ... | 259554 |    |\n| Chartered Bank, Fixed Deposit        | ... | ... | 70081 |    |\n| Mercantile Bank, Current Account     | ... | ... | 34810 |    |\n| Chartered Bank, Current Account      | ... | ... | 5895  |    |\n\nTotal: 370340\n\n| Receipts in 1903:\u2014                  | $ | c. | $ | c. |\n|-------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|\n| Subscriptions for 1901              | 10 |    |    |    |\n| do., 1902                           | 50 |    |    |    |\n| do., 1903                           | 510|    |    |    |\n| do., 1904                           | 25 |    |    |    |\n| do. for Life Membership             | 100|    |    |    |\n| Sale of Journals                    | 310| 25 |    |    |\n| Sale of Maps                        | 962| 21 |    |    |\n| Sundry Recoveries                   | 350|    |    |    |\n| Bank Interest                       | 120| 71 | 2091| 67 |\n\nTotal: 579507\n\n| Payments in 1903:\u2014                  | $ | c. | $ | c. |\n|-------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|\n| American Mission Press              | ... | ... | 414| 50 |\n| Thacker and Spink                   | ... | ... | 27 | 37 |\n| Mounting of Maps and Binding of Books | ... | ... | 315| 25 |\n| 3 New Book-cases, at $85 each       | ... | ... | 255|    |\n| Clerk's Salary                      | ... | ... | 93 | 15 |\n| Peon's Salary                       | ... | ... | 15 |    |\n| Postages and Petties                | ... | ... | 78 | 24 |\n\nTotal: 119851\n\n| Balances carried forward:\u2014          | $ | c. | $ | c. |\n|-------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|\n| Mercantile Bank, Fixed Deposit      | ... | ... | 2700|    |\n| Chartered Bank, Fixed Deposit       | ... | ... | 1000|    |\n| Mercantile Bank, Current Account    | ... | ... | 549| 29 |\n| Chartered Bank, Current Account     | ... | ... | 347| 27 |\n\nTotal: 459656\n\nExamined and found correct.\n\nA. KNIGHT.\n\nR. HANITSCH,\n\nHonorary Treasurer, Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society.\nOBITUARY.\n\nMr. Arthur W. S. O'Sullivan.\n\nSince the date of the last report the society has had to lament the death of Mr. Arthur W. S. O'Sullivan, a member of our Council for several years, and at one time Secretary.\n\nMr. O'Sullivan was born in 1860 and after a distinguished career at Trinity College, Dublin (scholar and gold medallist), he entered the Straits Settlements Civil Service in 1883.\n\nThroughout his service of twenty years in this Colony he was distinguished as an able hard-working officer and showed a marked talent for languages\u2014he was proficient in Dutch, Tamil, Malay, and more than one dialect of Chinese, which is a record rare amongst Europeans in this climate. He had held the post of Assistant Colonial Secretary for five years and had just been selected by the Colonial Office for the post of Colonial Secretary at Trinidad when he was struck down after a brief illness. Although he was not a frequent contributor to the Journal, the Society has lost in him an intellectual force\u2014a man who took a keen interest in scholarship of every kind. For three years before his death he was engaged in intervals of leisure in the translation of Dr. Snouck Hurgroyne's Acheen\u2014a valuable and interesting piece of work which will shortly be published at Leiden in Holland.\n\nIn endeavoring to open up the wide field of Dutch learning and experience in Netherlands India to English readers, he has set an example for which the Society may well be grateful.\n\nR. N. Bland.\nTwo Sea-Dyak Legends.\n\nBy the Revd. Edwin H. Gomes, M.A.\n\nThere are many fairy tales and legends known to the Sea-Dyaks of the present day. These seem to be handed down, by word of mouth, from generation to generation from ancient times.\n\nThese stories may be roughly divided into two classes:\n\nI. Those which are purely fabulous and related as such, and are simply meant to interest and amuse, and in these respects resemble the fairy tales familiar to us all; and\n\nII. Those which are believed to be perfectly true, and to have actually taken place, and are the traditions respecting their gods and preternatural beings. These form in fact the Mythology of the Dyaks.\n\nTo the first class belong a large collection of stories corresponding to the Adventures of Brer Fox and Brer Rabbit. In the Dyak tales, the Plandok and the Kekura (the mouse deer and the tortoise) act always in concert, and their combined intelligence is victorious over the rest of the animal world. To this class also belong the numerous stories related of Apai Samumang the Dyak type of cunning and wiliness\u2014and Apai Saloi\u2014the typical Dyak fool.\n\nTo the second class belong the many and varied adventures of Klieng, the great hero of ancient times, and his wife Kumang, the Dyak Venus, as well as the traditions relating to the gods believed in by the Dyaks of the present day. To these must be added certain stories which give a reason for some of the curious customs observed by the Dyaks. The two Dyak Myths which follow belong to this latter class.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 40, 1903.\nI.\n\nDanjai and the Were-Tiger's Sister.\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a great Chief named Danjai. He was the head of one of the longest Dyak houses that were ever built. It was situated on a hill in the midst of a large plantation of fruit trees. Danjai was said to be very rich indeed. He possessed much farming land, many fruit trees, many Tapang trees, where the wild bees make their abode, and from which the sweet honey is obtained, and in his room there were many valuable jars of various kinds, and also a large number of brass vessels; for the Dyaks convert their wealth into jars and brass-ware to hand down to posterity. Every year he obtained a plentiful harvest of paddy much more than he and his family could consume and he had always much paddy for sale, so much so that the news of his wealth travelled to distant lands, and many from afar off would come and buy paddy from him. Danjai also possessed many slaves who were ready to help him in his work. All the people in his house had a very high opinion of his judgment, and were ready to obey his decisions, whenever he settled any of their disputes. So great indeed was his reputation for wisdom, that men from distant villages would often consult him and ask his advice when in any difficulty. He had also great fame as a brave warrior, and during expeditions against the enemy, he was the leader of the men of his own village and of many villages around, for all liked to follow such a brave man as Danjai, who was sure to lead them to victory. Over the fireplace in his verandah he had, hanging together in a bunch, the dried heads of the enemies whom he himself had killed.\n\nNow this man Danjai had a very pretty wife whom he had recently married, but the marriage feast had not been held, because he had not yet obtained a human head from the enemy as a token of his love for her: for this girl was of a good birth and a Chief's daughter and wanted the whole world to learn, when they attended her marriage feast, what a brave man her husband was.\n\nDanjai said to his young wife, \"I will hold a meeting of the Chiefs around, and tell them that we must all get our war-boats ready, as I intend leading an expedition against the enemy.\"\nI should like to bring you a human head as a token of my love, so that you may not be ashamed of your husband. And as soon as I return, we will have the wedding feast.\"\n\nAnd though his wife was sorry that her husband intended leaving her, still she did not oppose his wishes, for she wished him to come back covered with glory.\n\nSo a council of war was held, and Danjai told the assembled Chiefs what he intended to do, and it was decided that all should begin at once making war-boats, which were to be ready in two months' time.\n\nDanjai assisted by his slaves and followers, had been at work at his boat for several weeks, and it was nearly finished. It was a beautiful boat made out of the trunk of one large tree, and Danjai was proud of his work. He was so anxious to finish his boat, that one day he started very early in the morning, before his breakfast was ready, and he asked his wife to bring his food to him later on to the part of the jungle where he was working at his boat.\n\nSo Mrs. Danjai cooked the food and then ate her own breakfast. Then she made up small bundles of rice and also put together some fish and salt, and placed all in a little basket to take to her husband. She had never been out in the jungle by herself before, but she was not afraid, for her husband had told her the way, and she could hear the sound of his adze as he worked at his boat not very far off. She hung her basket over her left shoulder and, holding her small knife in her right hand, went cheerfully on. Presently she came to the stump of a tree on which was placed a bunch of ripe rambutan fruit. They looked so tempting that she could not help eating some of them, and as they were very nice, she put what remained in her basket, saying to herself, \"Perhaps Danjai forgot to take these fruits with him and left them here. I will take them to him myself, he will no doubt be glad to eat these ripe fruits after his hard work.\"\n\nNow there was in that land a Were-Tiger, that was much feared by all who lived around. He had the appearance of a man, but at times would transform himself into a tiger, and then he would attack human beings and carry off their heads as trophies to his own house. But he never attacked any unless\nthey had first done wrong by taking something which belonged to him. So this Were-Tiger would leave tempting fruit by the side of jungle paths, and on the stumps of trees, in the hope that some tired traveller would take and eat them. And if any one ate such fruit, then he or she was doomed to be killed by him that same day. But all knew about him, and though he placed many tempting baits in all parts of the jungle, no one touched his fruit, for all feared the fate which awaited them if they did any such thing. But Danjai's wife knew nothing about the Were-Tiger. No one had told her of him, and she had never been out before in the jungle by herself, and she had never been warned not to touch any fruit she might find lying about.\n\n\"Oh Danjai,\" she said, as soon as she met her husband, \"I am afraid I am rather late. You must be very tired and hungry, working the whole morning at your boat without having had anything to eat. Never mind! Here is your breakfast at last.\" And she handed the basket which contained his food to her husband.\n\nNow Danjai was really very hungry, so he was glad to see his food had arrived. He thanked his wife and at once began to empty the basket.\n\nThe first thing he saw was the ripe rambutan fruit at the top, and he asked his wife where she got them from. She told him she had found them on the stump of a tree by the wayside, and she said she thought they had been left there by him. She added with a smile, that they were very good as she had eaten some herself.\n\nThen Danjai, brave man though he was, turned pale with fear and anxiety.\n\n\"We must not linger here a moment,\" he said to his wife. \"Hungry though I am, I will not eat my food here. We must both hurry home at once. You have taken and eaten fruit belonging to the Were-Tiger, so much feared by all. It is said that whoever touches his fruit will surely die a terrible death: and you are the first person I know who has done so.\"\n\nDanjai hurriedly gathered together all his tools and told those that were with him of his trouble, and they all started and walked silently back. Danjai was wondering how he was to\n\nJour. Straits Branch\navert the fate which awaited his young wife. She was silent, because she saw her husband was troubled, and she was sorry that she had caused him grief.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the house, Danjai sent for all the men round about and told them what had happened, how his wife bad taken and eaten the fruit of the Were-Tiger. He begged them all to help to shield her, for the Were-Tiger was sure to have his revenge, and come and take the head of his wife.\n\nSo they all prepared themselves for the tiger's visit by sharpening their knives and spears. Some men placed themselves on the roof of the house, others in the verandah. The ladder leading up to the house was also guarded, and so were all parts of the house by which he was likely to force an entrance. As for Danjai's wife, they hid her beneath some mats and sheets in the room, and twelve brave men stood round her with their swords drawn, ready to save her life even at the cost of their own.\n\nJust before dark they heard the roar of the tiger in the distance. Though still a long way off, the sound was very terrible to hear, and the men all grasped their swords and spears firmly, for they knew the tiger would soon be upon them.\n\nOnce more the tiger's roar sounded, nearer and clearer, and then they heard him crash through the leaf thatch roof and fall into the room. There was a great commotion among the men, but though all tried to kill the animal, none could see him. Soon after they heard a roar of triumph from the tiger outside the house. They lifted up the mats and sheets which covered Danjai's wife, and there they saw her headless body! The Were-Tiger had succeeded in his attack, and had carried off the head of his victim!\n\nLoud was the weeping and great the lamentation over her dead body. She was so young to die! And what death could be more terrible than hers whose head had been carried away by her murderer! All in the house mourned her loss for seven days and during that time the house was very quiet, as all lived in their separate rooms, and did not come out into the common verandah to do work or to talk to each other.\n\nThe death of his wife grieved Danjai very much. But though his grief was great, his desire for revenge was greater still.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 40, 1902.\nVery early on the morning of the next day, Danjai started after the tiger. The drops of blood which had fallen could plainly be seen on the ground, and he had no difficulty in finding out in what direction the tiger had gone. On and on he tracked the blood till he came to a cave at the foot of a high mountain. The sides of the cave were splashed with blood, so Danjai walked boldly in, determined to revenge the death of his wife. It was not very dark in the cave. In the distance he could see an opening and he hurried towards it.\n\nHe came out on the other side of the mountain, and saw a large plantation of sugar-cane and plantain trees. Beyond this he saw a long Dyak house.\n\n\"This,\" he said to himself, \"is surely the abode of the Were-Tiger, and soon I shall have an opportunity of revenging the death of my wife.\"\n\nHe planted two sticks across one another in the ground to mark the opening in the mountain, so that he might not miss his way on his return, and then he boldly walked towards the house.\n\nHe followed a path through the sugar-cane plantation\u2014still tracking the drops of blood upon the ground\u2014until he came to the ladder leading up to the house. He was so anxious to attack his wife's murderer, that he did not pause to ask\u2014as is the usual Dyak custom\u2014whether he might walk up or not, but went straight on into the house. Men sitting in the verandah asked him, as he passed them, where he was going and what he wanted, but he did not answer them. His heart was heavy within him, thinking of his dead wife, and wondering whether he would be able to accomplish his task, and whether he would succeed in leaving the house as easily as he came in. But he was determined to avenge his wife's murder, and he would not shrink from any difficulties in the way.\n\nHe stopped at the room of the head of the house, and a girl asked him to sit down, and spread a mat for him. He did so, and the girl went into the room to fetch the brass vessel containing the betelnut ingredients which the Dyaks love to chew. As he sat down, he saw drops of blood on the fire-place, and looking up he noticed a fresh head, still dripping with blood, among the other skulls hanging there. He recognised it at a glance\u2014it was the head of his loved wife!!\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe girl came out with the brass vessel of betelnut and said: \"Help yourself Danjai. We did not expect you to visit us so soon. Please excuse me for a little while, I have to attend to the cooking. But you will not be alone for my brother will soon be back. He has only gone to the plantation to fetch some sugar-cane.\"\n\nSo Danjai sat on the mat by himself, thinking what he was to do next and what he was to say to his wife's murderer when he came in. Soon the Were-Tiger arrived, carrying on his shoulder a bundle of sugar-cane.\n\n\"I am very pleased to see you Danjai,\" he said, \"would you like some sugar-cane? If so, help yourself.\"\n\nDanjai was so sad thinking of his wife, that he did not notice how curious it was, that they should know his name when they had never seen him before. He did not feel at all inclined to eat sugar-cane, but lest his host should think he had come to kill, and to put him off his guard, he pretended to eat a little. He heard the Were-Tiger say to his sister in the room, that she was to be sure to have enough food cooked, as Danjai would eat with them that evening. Then he left them and went to the river to bathe.\n\nThe sister came out of the room, and spoke to Danjai, who was still sitting in the verandah, and asked him to come into the room as she had something to say to him.\n\n\"Yes, Danjai,\" she said to him in a kind tone of voice, \"I know of your trouble and I am sorry for you. However, if you follow my advice, all will be well. You must be careful, for my brother is easily put out, and has no scruples about killing any who displease him. Even our own people here hate him, for he is so merciless; but no one dare attack him, for all fear him greatly. Now listen attentively to what I have to say. When I put out the plates of rice in the room presently, do not take the one he tells you to have: take any of the others, for the one he wishes you to have is sure to contain some poison. Later on, when you retire to rest, do not spend the night on the mat spread out for you, but sleep somewhere else, and put the wooden mortar for pounding paddy on the mat in your stead: and so again on the second night, place the wooden mill for husking the paddy on your mat: and on the third night a roll of\nthe coarse matting used for treading paddy. If his three attempts to kill you are unsuccessful, then he will be in your power and will do what you command. But even then there is still danger, and you must not do anything rash, but ask my advice again later on. But go outside now into the verandah, for I think I hear my brother returning from his bath. I must make haste and put out the food for you all to eat.\u201d\n\nSoon the Were-Tiger came in and sitting on the mat by Danjai asked him the news and how matters were in his country. Danjai answered little for he was very sad, besides his host always laughed at him whenever he spoke. The fact was that he was amused at the idea of the man, whose wife he had killed, sitting in his verandah and talking to him in a friendly way.\n\nThe sister came out of the room and asked them in to have their meal. All happened as she said it would. Danjai remembered her advice and did not take the plate of rice his host offered him. But he was too sad to eat.\n\nIn the evening Danjai and the Were-Tiger sat by a fire in the verandah. Over this fire hung several human heads. The tears came into Danjai\u2019s eyes as he sat there and saw the head of his dear wife being scorched by the fire. He felt inclined there and then to grasp his sword and attack the murderer of his wife; but he restrained himself remembering the advice of the Tiger\u2019s sister.\n\nThe Were-Tiger said to him with a nasty laugh, \u201cWhat is troubling you that you should weep?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not troubled about anything,\u201d said Danjai, \u201cbut the smoke of the fire is too much for my eyes, and it makes them water and feel sore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf so,\u201d said his host, \u201clet us put out the fire and retire to rest, as it is very late.\u201d\n\nTwo mats were spread out for them, one on each side of the fire-place, and they lay down to sleep. But Danjai kept awake, and when his companion was asleep, he rose and placed the wooden mortar for pounding paddy on his mat, and covered it over with a sheet; and he himself retired to a safe place as he was advised to do by the Tiger\u2019s sister. He watched to see what would happen and he was not disappointed. Not long after, he saw the Were-Tiger wake up and fetch a sword, and walk\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nup to the place where he was supposed to be asleep. With the sword he made two or three vicious cuts at the wooden mortar and said:\n\n\"Now Danjai, this will settle you. You will not think of revenging yourself on me any more.\"\n\nThen Danjai cried out from where he was, \"What is the matter? What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Oh Danjai! Is that you?\" said his host, \"I did not mean to hurt you. I had a bad dream, and I sometimes walk in my sleep. How lucky it is you were not lying on the mat! I should have certainly killed you, and I should never have forgiven myself for doing so. Please understand I meant no harm to you, and let us lie down to rest again.\"\n\nOn the two following nights the Were-Tiger attempted to kill Danjai, but failed each time, because following the advice given him, Danjai placed first the wooden mill for husking the paddy on his mat, and next a roll of coarse matting used for treading paddy. His host made the same excuse for his strange behaviour each time.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day, after the Were-Tiger had left the house to see whether any fish had been caught in his fish trap, his sister asked Danjai to come into the room as she had something to say to him before he left to return home.\n\n\"Now Danjai,\" she said, \"as I told you before, since my brother has not been able to kill you these three days, he is in your power. After breakfast ask him to accompany you and show you the way back to your country. When you have both come to the further end of the sugar-cane plantation, ask him to sit down for a little while, and say you would like to eat some sugar-cane, before you leave him and go on your journey alone. When he gives you the sugar-cane, ask him to lend you his sword, giving as an excuse that yours is not sharp enough for peeling the sugar-cane, or that it is stuck fast in its sheath and cannot be drawn. When he hands you his sword, you must attack him with it and kill him. My brother is invulnerable to any other sword but his own. When you have killed him, cut off his head and bring it to me, and I will give you your wife's head in exchange for it. On no account are you to take his head away with you. If you do so, I will follow you to your country and take my revenge.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 40, 1903.\nA few minutes after this conversation, the Were-Tiger returned with a basket full of fish. Some of these were soon cooked, and they sat down to breakfast.\n\nSoon after they had eaten, Danjai told his host that he must be returning to his own country, and asked him to accompany him and show him his way back. So they started together and walked through the sugar-cane plantation.\n\nJust as they came near the end of it, Danjai asked his companion to stop. He said he would like to have some sugar-cane before going on.\n\n\"I am sorry I did not offer you any,\" said the Were-Tiger: \"it was very forgetful of me. Never mind, I will at once cut down some sugar-cane for us.\"\n\nWhen he had brought the sugar-cane and had finished peeling the piece he wanted for himself, Danjai said to him,\n\n\"Please lend me your sword, for mine is stuck fast in its sheath and I cannot draw it out.\"\n\nThe Were-Tiger suspecting nothing, handed the sword to him, and Danjai began peeling his sugar-cane.\n\nJust then the Were-Tiger turned round to look at his house, and Danjai seizing his opportunity, gave him a blow with the sword in his hand and killed him. Then he cut off the head and carried it back with him to the house he had just left.\n\nWhen he came near, he saw the sister watching for his return, and standing at the top of the ladder leading up to the house. He followed her into the house, and gave her the head of her brother.\n\n\"You ought to be quite satisfied now, Danjai,\" she said, \"for you have killed my brother, and have taken your revenge for the death of your wife. I want you to promise me certain things before you go. First of all, you must not let anybody know that you have killed my brother. Next, on your return, you must go on the war-path and bring back to me the head of a woman, to enable me to put away the mourning of myself and my relatives, for the death of my brother. And when you return, I hope you will take me with you to be your comforter in the place of your dead wife: so that I may have some one to care for me, now that my brother is dead. And I give you now some locks of my hair, to be used as a charm to\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nmake you invisible to the enemy, when you are on the warpath. Lastly, I advise you and your people, never to eat or to take away any fruit you may find lying about in the jungle, on the stump of a tree, or on a rock, without knowing for certain who put it there and to whom it belongs, or making sure that it has fallen from some tree near. This must be remembered from generation to generation. Whoever disobeys this advice will be punished either by death, as in the case of your wife, or in some other dreadful way. You may now have the head of your wife to take back to your country; and as you may have forgotten the way, I will send one of my slaves with you, to show you in what direction you are to go.\"\n\nAs she finished speaking, she handed him his wife's head, and Danjai started off at once for he was anxious to get back.\n\nHe reached his house late that same evening. All his friends were glad to see him come back safe and sound. They had given up all hope of seeing him again. They were also pleased to see he had been successful in bringing back the head of his dead wife.\n\nSoon after Danjai's return from the Were-Tiger's country he gathered all his followers together and told them that he intended going on the war-path. As soon as they were able to get everything ready, they started for the enemy's country. They were very successful and succeeded in taking many heads; but Danjai, protected as he was by the charm which he had received from the Were-Tiger's sister, was more successful than the others. They returned with much rejoicing, and a great feast was held in honor of their victory. The human heads were placed on a costly dish, and the women carried them into the house, with dancing and singing.\n\nA few days after, Danjai started to fulfil his promise to the Were-Tiger's sister. He brought her back with him as his wife, and they lived very happily together for many years.\n\nThis story explains why the Dyaks, even at the present day, dare not eat any fruit they may find lying on the stump of a tree, or on a rock in the jungle. They fear that evil will happen to them, as it did to Danjai's wife.\nII.\n\nThe Story of Siu,\n\nWho first taught the Dyaks to plant Paddy and to observe the Omens of Birds.\n\nMany thousands of years ago before the Paddy plant was known, the Dyaks lived on tapioca, yams, potatoes and such fruit as they could procure. It was not till Siu taught them how to plant Paddy that such a thing as rice was known. The story of how he came to learn of the existence of this important article of food, and how he and his son Seragunting introduced it among their people is here set forth.\n\nSiu was the son of a great Dyak chief, but his father died when he was quite a child, and at the time this story begins, he lived with his mother and was the head of a long Dyak house in which lived some three hundred families. He was strong and active and handsome in appearance, and there was no one in the country round who was equal to him in strength or comeliness. When he was ready to go on the warpath, he was the admiration of all the Dyak damsels. On such occasions he appeared in a many coloured waistcloth, twelve fathoms in length, which was wound round and round his body. On his head was a plaited rattan band in which were stuck some long feathers of the hornbill. His coat was woven of threads of bright colours. On each well-shaped arm was an armlet of ivory. To his belt was fastened his sword and the many charms and amulets that he possessed. With his spear in his right hand and his shield on his left arm, he presented a splendid type of a Dyak Warrior. But not of his bravery nor of his deeds of valour against the enemy does this tale relate. It only gives an account of an adventure of his which ended in his discovery of Paddy.\n\nOne day Siu proposed to the young men of his house that they should take their blowpipes with them and go into the jungle to shoot birds. So one morning they all started early. Each man had with him his bundle of food for the day, and each went a different way, as they wished to see, on returning in the evening, who would be the most successful of them all.\n\nSiu went towards a mountain not far from his house. He wandered about the whole morning in the jungle, but strange to\nsay, he did not see any bird nor did he meet with any animal. Everything was very quiet and still. Worn out with fatigue, he sat down to rest under a large tree, and feeling hungry, he ate some of the food he had brought with him. It was now long past midday, and he had not been able to kill a single bird! Surely none of the others could be so unfortunate as he!\n\nHe determined not to be beaten by the others, and after a short rest, he started again and wandered on in quest of birds. The sun had gone half-way down in the western heaven, and he was beginning to lose heart, when suddenly he heard not far off the sound of birds. He hurried in that direction, and came to a large wild fig tree covered with ripe fruit, which a large number of birds were busy eating. Never before had he seen such a sight! On this one large tree, the whole feathered population of the forest seemed to have assembled together! On looking carefully, he was surprised to see that the different kinds of birds were not all intermingled together as is usually the case. Each species was apart from the others. Here he saw a large flock of wild pigeons on one branch, and next to them were the parrots, all feeding together but keeping distinct from them. Upon this tree there were hornbills, wood-peckers, wild pigeons and all the different kinds of birds he had ever seen.\n\nHe hid himself under the thick leaves of a shrub growing near, very much pleased at his luck. He took a poisoned dart and placed it in his blow-pipe, and taking good aim, shot it out. He had aimed at one bird in a particular flock, and he hit it. But that bird was not the only one that fell dead at his feet. To his astonishment, he saw that many of the other birds that were near it were killed also. Again he shot out a dart, and again the same thing happened. The bird that was hit fell down dead, and with it the birds that were near it. In a very short time, Siu had killed as many birds as he could carry. As the little basket, in which he had brought his food, was too small to hold them all, he set to work and made a large coarse basket with the bark of a Pendok tree growing near. Then he put his load on his back and started to return home, glad that he had been so successful.\n\nHe tried to follow the way by which he had come, but as he had not taken the precaution to cut marks in the trees he passed,\nhe very soon found himself in difficulties. He wandered about, sometimes passing by some large tree, which he seemed to remember seeing in the morning. He climbed up a steep hill and went several miles through a large forest, but did not find the jungle path which he had followed early in the day. It was beginning to grow dusk and the sun had nearly set.\n\n\"I must hurry on,\" said Siu to himself, \"in the hope of finding some house where I can get food and shelter. Once it is dark, I shall be forced to spend the night in the jungle.\"\n\nHe hurried on and luckily came to a part of the jungle which had lately been a garden.\n\n\"There must be some path from this garden,\" said Siu to himself, \"leading to some house;\" and he began to walk round it.\n\nHe soon found an old disused path which he followed and which led him to another path. By this time it was quite dark, and Siu made haste to reach the Dyak house which he felt sure was not very far off. He soon came to a well, and not far off he saw the lights and heard the usual sounds of a Dyak house. He was glad to think that he would not have to spend the night in the jungle, but would be probably able to get food and shelter at the house.\n\nHe stopped to have a bath and hid the birds he was carrying and his blow-pipe and quiver in the brushwood near the well, hoping to take them with him when he started to return the next morning.\n\nAs he approached the house, he could hear the voices of the people there. When he came to the bottom of the ladder leading up to the house, he shouted, \"Oh! you people in the house, will you allow a stranger to walk up?\" At once there was dead silence in the house. No one answered. Again Siu asked the same question, and, after a pause, a voice answered, \"yes: come up!\"\n\nHe walked up into the house. To his surprise, he saw no one in the open verandah in front of the different rooms. That part of a Dyak house, usually so crowded, was quite empty. Nor did Siu hear the voices of people talking in any of the rooms. All was silent. Even the person who answered him was not there to receive him.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nHe saw a dim light in the verandah, further on, in the middle of the house, and he walked towards it. He wondered what could have happened to all the people in the house, for not long before he heard many voices.\n\n\"This seems to be a strange house,\" he said to himself. \"When I was bathing and when I walked up to the house, it seemed to be well inhabited, but now that I come in, I see no one, and hear no voice.\"\n\nWhen Siu reached the light, he sat down on a mat there. Presently he heard a woman's voice in the room say, \"Sit down Siu; I will bring out the pinang and sireh to you.\"\n\nSiu was very pleased to hear a human voice. Soon a young and remarkably beautiful girl came out of the room with the chewing ingredients, which she placed before him.\n\n\"Here you are at last, Siu,\" she said, \"I expected you would come earlier. How is it you are so late?\"\n\n\"I stopped a little while at the well to have a bath, as I was hot and tired.\"\n\n\"You must be very hungry as well,\" she said, \"wait a moment while I prepare some food for you. After you have eaten we can have our talk together.\"\n\nWhen Siu was left to himself, he wondered what it all meant. Here was a long Dyak house, built for more than a hundred families to live in, and yet it seemed quite deserted. The only person in it appeared to be the beautiful girl who was cooking his food for him. Then again, he wondered how it was she knew his name and expected him that day. All these things filled him with wonder and surprise.\n\n\"Come in, Siu,\" said the voice from the room, \"your food is ready.\"\n\nSiu was very hungry and went in at once, and sat down to eat his dinner.\n\nWhen they had done eating, she cleared away the plates and put things back into their places and tidied the room. Then she spread out a new mat for him, and brought out the pinang and sireh, and bade him be seated, as she wished to have a chat with him.\n\nSiu had many questions to ask, and as soon as they were both seated, he began:\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 40, 1903.\n\"Why are you all alone in this house? This is a long house, and many families must live in it; where are the others? Why is everything so silent now? I am sure I heard voices before I entered the house; but now I hear no sound.\"\n\n\"Do not let us talk about this house or the people in it for the present. I would much rather talk of other matters. Tell me of your own people, and what news you bring from your country.\"\n\n\"There is no news to give you,\" Siu replied. \"We have been rather badly off for food, as our potatoes and yams did not turn out so well this year as we hoped.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what made you come in this direction and how it was you found out this house.\"\n\n\"While I was hunting in the jungle to-day, I lost my way. After wandering about a long time, I found a path which I followed and came to this house. It was kind of you to take me in and give me food. If I had not found this house, I must have died in the jungle. To-morrow morning I must ask you to show me the way to my country, and also I must beg of you some food for my journey back. My mother is sure to be anxious about me. She is left all alone, now that I am away. My father died a long time ago, and I am her only son.\"\n\n\"Do not go away as soon as to-morrow morning. Stay here a few days at any rate.\"\n\nAt first Siu would not consent, but she spoke so nicely to him that she succeeded in persuading him to stay there at least a week. Then he went out to the verandah, and she brought out a mat for him to sleep on and a sheet to cover himself with. As Siu was very tired, he soon fell sound asleep, and did not wake up till late on the following morning.\n\nHe saw some little children playing about the next day, but he did not see any grown up people. He went into the room to have his morning meal, but saw no one there, except the girl he had seen the evening before. He felt very much inclined to ask her again where the people of the house were, but he did not do so, as she did not seem inclined to speak about them.\n\nNow though Siu knew it not, this was the house of the great Singalang Burong, the Ruler of the Spirit World. He was able to metamorphose himself and his followers into any\nform. When going forth on an expedition against the enemy, he would transform himself and his followers into birds, so that they might travel more quickly. Over the high trees of the jungle, over the broad rivers, sometimes even across the sea Singalang Burong and his flock would fly. There was no trouble about food, for in the forests there were always some wild trees in fruit, and while assuming the form of birds, they lived on the food of birds. In his own house and among his own people Singalang Burong appeared as a man. He had eight daughters, and the girl who was cooking food for Siu was the youngest of them.\n\nThe reason why the people of the house were so quiet, and did not make their appearance, was because they were all in mourning for many of their relatives who had been killed some time back. Only the women and children were at home, because that same morning all the men had gone forth to make a raid upon some neighbouring tribe, so that they might bring home some human heads to enable them to end their mourning. For it was the custom that the people of a house continued to be in mourning for dead relatives, until one or more human heads were brought to the house. Then a feast was held, and all mourning was at an end.\n\nAfter Siu had been in the house seven days, he thought he ought to think of returning to his own people. By this time he was very much in love with the girl who had been so kind to him, and he wished above all things to marry her, and take her back with him to his own country.\n\n\"I have been here a whole week,\" he said to her, \"and though you have not told me your name, still I seem to know you very well. I have a request to make and I hope you will not be angry at what I say.\"\n\n\"Speak on; I promise I will not be angry whatever you may say.\"\n\n\"I have learnt to love you very much,\" said Siu, \"and I would like to marry you if you will consent, so that I shall not leave you but take you with me, when I return to my own land. Also I wish you to tell me your name, and why this house is so silent, and where all the people belonging to it are.\"\n\"I will consent to marry you, for I also love you. But you must first promise me certain things. In the first place, you must not tell your people of this house and what you have seen here. Then also you must promise faithfully never to hurt a bird or even to hold one in your hands. If ever you break this promise, then we cease to be man and wife. And of course, you must never kill a bird, because if you do so, I shall not only leave you but revenge myself on you. Do you promise these things?\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Siu, \"I promise not to speak of what I have seen here until you give me leave to do so. And as you do not wish it, I will never touch or handle a bird, and certainly never kill one.\"\n\n\"Now that you have promised what I wish, I will tell you about myself and the people of this house,\" said the maiden. \"My name is Endu-Sudan-Galinggam-Tinchin-Mas (the girl Sudan painted like a gold ring), but my people call me by my pet names Bunsu Burong (the youngest of the bird family), and Bunsu Katupong (the youngest of the Katupong family). This house, as you noticed, seems very empty. The reason is that a month ago many of our people were killed by some of the people of your house, and we are all still in mourning for them. As you know, when our relatives have lately died, we stay silent in our rooms, and do not come out to receive visitors or to entertain them. Why are your people so cruel to us? They often kill our men when they go out fishing or hunting. On the morning of the day on which you arrived, all the men of this house went on the war-path, so as to obtain the heads of some of the enemy to enable us to put away our mourning. With us as with you it is necessary that one or more human heads be brought into the house, before the inmates can give up sorrowing for their dead relatives and friends. You see us now in the form of human beings, but all the people in this house are able to transform themselves into birds. My father Singalang Burong is the head of this house. I am the youngest of eight sisters: we have no brother alive. Our only brother died not long ago, and we are still in mourning for him, and that was the reason why my sisters did not come out to greet you.\"\n\nSiu heard with surprise all she had to say. He said to himself that it was lucky he did not bring up to the house the\nbasket of birds which he had killed in the jungle, and that he had hidden them with his blow-pipe and quiver containing poisoned darts, in the brushwood near the well. He determined to say nothing about the matter, as probably some of her friends or relations were among the birds that were killed by him.\n\nSo Siu married Bunsu Burong and continued to live in the house for several weeks.\n\nOne day he said to his wife:\u2014\"I have been here a long time. My people must surely be wondering where I am, and whether I am still alive. My mother too must be very anxious about me. I should like to return to my people, and I want you to accompany me. My mother and my friends are sure to welcome you as my wife.\"\n\n\"Oh yes: I will gladly accompany you back to your home. But you must remember and say nothing of the things you have seen in this house. When shall we start?\"\n\n\"We can start early to-morrow morning, soon after breakfast,\" answered Siu.\n\nThey started early the next day, taking with them food enough for four days, as they expected the journey would last as long as that. Siu's wife seemed to know the way, and after journeying for three days, they came to the stream near the house, and they stopped to have a bath. Some of the children of the house saw them there, and ran up to the house and said:\u2014\"Siu has come back, and with him is a beautiful woman, who seems to be his wife.\"\n\nSome of the older people checked the children, saying:\u2014\"It cannot be Siu: he has been dead for a long time. Don't mention his name, for if his mother hears you talk of him, it will make her very unhappy.\"\n\nBut the children persisted in saying that it was indeed Siu that they had seen. Just then Siu and his wife appeared, and walked up to the house.\n\nSiu said to his wife:\u2014\"The door before which I hang up my sword is the door of my room. Walk straight in. You will find my mother there, and she will be sure to be glad to welcome you as her daughter-in-law.\"\n\nWhen they came into the house, all the inmates rushed out to meet them, and to congratulate Siu on his safe return.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\nThey asked him many questions:\u2014where had he been living all this time; how he came to be married, and what was the name of his wife's country. But Siu answered little, as he remembered the promise he had made to his wife, that he would not speak of what he had seen in her house.\n\nWhen they reached the door of his room, Siu hung up his sword and his wife went into the room. But she did not see his mother as she was ill and was lying in her curtain. Then Siu followed his wife into the room and called out \"Mother, where are you? Here is your son Siu come back!\"\n\nBut his mother made no answer, so he opened her curtain, and saw her lying down, covered up with a blanket. She had been so troubled at the thought that her son was dead, that she had refused to eat and had become quite ill.\n\nShe would not believe that her son had really returned alive, and she said, \"Do not try to deceive me; my son Siu is dead.\"\n\n\"I am indeed your son Siu, and I have come back alive and well!\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied, \"my son Siu is dead. Leave me alone, I have not long to live. Let me die in peace and follow my son to the grave.\"\n\nSiu then went to the box in which his clothes were kept, and put on the things that his mother had often seen him wear. Then he went to her again and said, \"Even if you do not believe that I am your son, at any rate you might turn round and look at me, to make sure that I am not your son.\"\n\nThen she looked at him, and saw that it was indeed her son. She was so pleased at his return that she soon recovered from her illness, which was really caused by her sorrow and refusal to eat. Siu told his mother of his marriage, and she welcomed his wife with joy.\n\nThe women all crowded round Siu's wife and asked her what her name was. She answered Endu-Sudan-Galingam-Tinchin-Mas. (The girl Sudan painted like a gold ring). They looked at her in surprise; they had never heard of such a name before.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\" they asked. \"What is the name of your country?\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\n\"Nanga Niga Bekurong Bebali nyadi Tekuyong Mabong,\" (The mouth of the hidden Niga stream changed into the Mabong snail),* was the reply.\n\nThey were astonished at her answer! They had never heard of such a country. They asked her of her people, but she would not say anything more of herself or speak about her people.\n\nEverybody admired the great beauty of Siu's wife. No more questions were asked of her, as she seemed unwilling to answer. Her parentage remained a mystery.\n\nIn process of time Siu's wife bore him a son whom they named Seragunting. He was a fine child, and as befitted the grandson of Singalang Burong, he grew big and strong in a miraculously short time, and when he was three years old, he was taller and stronger than others four times his age.\n\nOne day as Seragunting was playing with the other boys, a man brought up some birds which he had caught in a trap. As he walked through the house, he passed Siu who was sitting in the open verandah. Siu forgetting the promise he had made to his wife asked him to show him the birds, and he took one in his hands and stroked it. His wife was sitting not far off, and saw him hold the bird and was very much vexed that he had broken his promise to her.\n\nShe got up and returned to her room. Siu came in and noticed that she was troubled and asked her what was wrong. She said that she was only tired.\n\nShe said to herself:\u2014\"My husband has broken his word to me. He was done the thing he promised me he would never do. I told him he was never to hold a bird in his hands, and that if he did such a thing, I would leave him. I cannot stay here in this house any longer. I must return to the house of my father Singalang Burong.\"\n\nShe took the water vessels in her hands, and went out as if to fetch water. But when she came to the well, she placed the water vessels on the ground, and disappeared in the jungle.\n\nIn the meantime Seragunting, tired with his play came back in search of his mother. She was very fond indeed of him, and\n\n*The Dyaks are fond of rhyming names, which often have no special meaning.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\nhe expected her to come to him as soon as he called out to her. But he was disappointed. No one answered his call, and when he looked in the room, she was not there. He asked his father where his mother was, and he told him that she had just gone to the well to fetch water and would soon be back.\n\nBut hour after hour passed, and she did not return to the house. So Seragunting began to be anxious, and asked his father to accompany him to the well to look for her. At first his father refused to do so, but when he saw his son crying for his mother, he went with him to the well. They found the water vessels there, but saw no signs of her.\n\n\"Your mother is not here, Seragunting,\" said Siu. \"Perhaps she has gone to the garden to get some vegetables for our dinner. Let us go back to the house. If your mother is not back, early to-morrow morning, we will go and look for her.\" So they both returned to the house, taking back with them the water gourds which Siu's wife had left at the well.\n\nEarly the next morning, Seragunting and his father went in search of her. They took with them only a little food, as they expected to find her not very far off. But they wandered the whole day and saw no signs of her. They spent the night under a large tree in the jungle. Early the next morning, they were surprised to find a small bundle of food, wrapped up in leaves, near Seragunting. This food was evidently meant for him alone, as it was not enough for two, but he gave some of it to his father, who ate sparingly of it, so that his son might not be hungry. They wandered on for several days, and every night the same strange thing occurred\u2014a bundle of food was left near Seragunting. Siu suggested to his son that they should return; but Seragunting, who during the journey had grown up into a strong lad with a will of his own, would not consent to do so, as he was determined to find his mother.\n\nThey wandered on for several days, deeper and deeper into the jungle; but could find no signs of her whom they sought. At last they came to the sea-shore. Here they rested for some days, in the hope that some boat might pass. Still, as before, each morning a bundle of food was found by Seragunting. If it were not for this food, they would have long ago died of starvation. On this food they managed to live, waiting\nhopefully to see some boat appear to take them on their journey.\n\nOne day as Seragunting was watching, he heard the sound of paddles, and saw in the distance several long boats approaching. He hailed the first, and asked the men in it to take him and his father with them. The boat made for the shore, but the man in the bows recognised the two wanderers, and shouted out:\u2014\"It is Siu and his son Seragunting: do not let them come into the boat.\" The boat went on and left them to their fate. The same thing happened in the case of each of the other boats. As soon as Siu and his son were recognised, no one would help them.\n\nNow these were the boats of the sons-in-law of Singalung Burong:\u2014Katupong, Beragai, Bejampong, Papau, Nendak, Pangkas, and Embuas. They were not pleased at their sister-in-law marrying a mere mortal like Siu, and so refused to help him and his son.\n\nThe next day Seragunting saw what seemed to be a dark cloud come towards him over the sea. As it came nearer, it took the form of a gigantic spider, carrying some food and clothes.\n\n\"Do not be afraid,\" said the Spider, \"I have come to help you and your father. I have brought you food and clothing. When you have had some food and changed your clothes, I will take you across the water to the land on the other side. My name is Emplawa Jawa (the Spider of Java). I know your history, and I will lead you to your mother whom you seek.\"\n\nAfter they had eaten and put on the new clothes brought them, the spider told them to go with him across the sea. They were not to be afraid, but to follow his track, not turning to the right hand nor to the left. They obeyed his words. Strange to say, the water became as hard as a sandbank under their feet. For a long time they were out of sight of land, but towards evening they approached the opposite shore, and saw a landing place where there were a large number of boats. Not far off where several houses, and one longer and more imposing than any of the others. To this house the Spider directed Seragunting, telling him that he would find his mother there. The Spider then left them. As it was late, they did not go up to\nthe house that evening, but spent the night in one of the boats at the landing place. Among the boats were those belonging to the Sons-in-law of Singalang Burong which had passed Sin and his son as they waited on the sea-shore for some boat to take them across the sea.\n\nWhen Seragunting and his father woke up next morning, they saw that the road leading up to the house had sharpened pieces of bamboo planted close together in the path, to prevent their walking up it. As they were wondering what they were to do next, a fly came to Seragunting and said:\n\n\"Do not be afraid to walk up. Tread on the spikes that I alight on; they will not hurt you. When you come to the house you will find swords with blades turned upwards fastened to the ladder. Tread on the blades that I alight on and walk boldly up into the house.\"\n\nThey did as the fly advised them, and were not hurt. The bamboo spikes crumbled under their feet, and sword blades they trod on were blunt and harmless.\n\nThe people of the house took no notice of them, and they sat down in the verandah of the house. Then the fly came to Seragunting and whispered to him:\u2014\"You must now follow me into the room. Your mother is there, lying in her curtain. I will point out to you which it is, and you must wake her up and tell her who you are. She will be very pleased to see you. Then when you come out into the verandah and see the sons-in-law of Singalang Burong, you must greet them as your uncles. They will disown you and pretend that you are no relation of theirs. But do not be afraid. You will be victorious in the end.\"\n\nSeragunting followed the fly into the room and went to the curtain on which it alighted. He called out to his mother, and she awoke and saw with joy her son. She embraced him, and he said to her:\n\n\"How is it you went away and left us? We missed you so much, and were so sorry to lose you, that my father and I have been travelling for many days and nights in search of you. Now our troubles are over for I have found you.\"\n\n\"My dear son,\" she said as she caressed him, \"though I left you I did not forget you. It was I who placed the food by you\nevery night. I left your father because he broke the promise he made to me. But you are my own son, and I have been wishing to see you, ever since I left your house. It was I who sent the Spider to help you and show you your way here. My love for you is as great as it ever was. We will go out now into the verandah, and I will introduce you to your uncles and aunts and to your grandfather. They may not welcome you, because they were opposed to my marriage to your father. But do not be afraid of them. We will be more than a match for them all.\"\n\nThen she spoke to her husband Siu, whom she was glad to meet again. All three then went out into the verandah, which was now full of people. Seragunting called the sons-in-law of Singalang Burong his uncles, but they refused to acknowledge that he was their nephew.\n\nThey proposed several ordeals to prove the truth of his words, that he was indeed the grandson of Singalang Burong. In all of these Seragunting came off victorious.\n\nAs the men and boys were spinning their tops, they asked Seragunting to join them. He had no top of his own, so he asked his mother for one. She took an egg and uttered some mysterious words over it, and immediately it became a top. This she gave to her son, who went and joined the others in the game. Whenever Seragunting aimed at a top, he always hit it and smashed it in pieces. None of the others were a match for him. In a short time, all the tops except that of Seragunting were broken in pieces.\n\nThen they suggested a wrestling match. Seragunting was quite ready to try a fall with any of them, old or young. Some of their best wrestlers came forward. The first two were overthrown so easily by him, that the others saw it was no use their attempting to wrestle with Seragunting.\n\nAs a last trial they proposed that all should go out hunting. Here they hoped to be more fortunate. All the sons-in-law of Singalang Burong took their good hunting dogs with them, confident of success. Seragunting was told that he could have any of the other dogs left in the house. There he saw a few old dogs, weak and useless for hunting. With these he was expected to compete against the others, and if he was not successful, both he and his father were to be killed! Seragunting\nconsented even to such an unfair ordeal as that. He called to him an old sickly looking dog, and gently stroked it. At once it became young and strong! While the others went forth into the jungle with a pack of hounds, Seragunting was only accompanied by one dog. In the evening Katupong, Beragai, Bejampong and the others all returned unsuccessful. Soon after, Seragunting's dog appeared chasing a huge boar which made a stand at the foot of the ladder of the house. Seragunting asked the others to kill the beast if they dared. The spears cast at it glided off, and left the beast unharmed. Some of those who were rash enough to go near the animal, had a close escape from being torn in pieces by its tusks.\n\nSeragunting armed with nothing better than a little knife belonging to his mother, walked up to the infuriated animal, and stabbed it in a vital part, and it fell down dead at his feet.\n\nAfter these marvellous feats, all were compelled to admit that Seragunting was a true grandson of the great Singalang Burong. They all acknowledged him as such, and he was taken to his grand-father, who was pleased to see the lad and promised to help him throughout his life.\n\nBut Siu was unhappy in his new home. He could not help thinking of his mother whom he had left alone, and he was anxious to return to his own people. He begged his wife to accompany him back to his old home, but she refused to do so. It was decided that Siu and his son should stay in the house of Singalang Burong till they had obtained such knowledge as would be useful to them in the future, and that then they were to return to the lower world, bringing with them the secrets they had learnt from those wiser and more powerful than themselves.\n\nAll the people of the house were now most kind to Siu and his son, and were most anxious to teach them all they could. They were taken on a war expedition against the enemy, so they might learn the science and art of Dyak warfare. They were taught how to set traps to catch deer and wild pig. They were shown the different methods of catching fish, and learnt to make the different kinds of fish-trap used by the Dyaks of the present day. They remained in Singalang Burong's house that whole year, so that they might have a complete\nand practical knowledge of the different stages of paddy growing.\n\nWhen the year was ended, Seragunting's mother took him and Siu to see her father, Singalang Burong, so that they might receive from him his advice, as well as such charms as he might wish to give them before they left to return to the lower world of mortals.\n\nSingalang Burong was sitting in his chair of state, and received them most kindly when they came to him. He bade them be seated on the mat at his feet, as he had many things to say to them. Then he explained to Siu and his son who he was, and the worship due to him, and they learnt also about the observance of omens, both good and bad.\n\n\"I am the Ruler of the Spirit World,\" said Singalang Burong, \"and have the power to make men successful in all they undertake. At all times, if you wish for my help, you must call upon me and make offerings to me. Especially must this be done before you go to fight against the enemy, for I am the God of War and help those who pay me due respect.\"\n\n\"You have learnt here how to plant paddy. I will give you some paddy to take away with you, and when you get back to your own country, you can teach men how to cultivate it. You will find rice a much more strengthening article of food than the yams and potatoes you used to live upon, and you will become a strong and hardy race.\n\n\"And to help you in your daily work, my sons-in-law will always tell you whether that you do is right or wrong. In every work that you undertake, you must pay heed to the voices of the sacred birds:\u2014Katupong, Beragai, Bejampong, Papau, Nendak, Pangkas, and Embuas. These birds, named after my sons-in-law, represent them and are the means by which I make known my wishes to mankind. When you hear them, remember it is myself speaking through my sons-in-law for encouragement or for warning. Whatever work you may be engaged in\u2014farm work, house-building, fishing or hunting\u2014wherever you may be you must always do as these birds direct. Whenever you have a feast, you must make an offering to me, and you must call upon my sons-in-law to come and partake of the feast. If you do not do these things, some evil is sure to happen to you.\"\nam willing to help you and to give you prosperity, but I expect due respect to be paid to me, and will not allow my commands to be disobeyed.\"\n\nThen Singalang Burong presented them with many charms to take away with them. These were of various kinds. Some had the power to make the owner brave and fortunate in war. Others were to preserve him in good health, or to make him successful in his paddy planting and cause him to have good harvests.\n\nSiu and Seragunting then bade their friends farewell, and started to return. As soon as they had descended the ladder of the house of Singalang Burong, they were swiftly transported through the air by some mysterious power, and in a moment they found themselves at the bathing place of their own house.\n\nTheir friends crowded round them, glad to see them back, safe and well. They were taken with much rejoicing to the house. Friends and neighbours were told of their return, and a great meeting was held that evening. All gathered round the two adventurers, who told them of their strange experiences in the far country of the Spirit Birds. The charms received from Singalang Burong were handed round for general admiration. The new seed paddy was produced, and the good qualities of Rice as an article of food explained. The people congregated there had never seen paddy before, but all determined to be guided by Siu and Seragunting, and to plant it in future. The different names of the Sacred Birds were told to the assembled people, and all were warned to pay due respect to their cries.\n\nAnd so, according to the ancient legend, ended the old primitive life of the Dyak, when he lived upon such poor food as the fruits of the jungle, and any yams and potatoes he happened to plant near his house; the old blind existence, in which there was nothing to guide him; and then began his new life, in which he advanced forward a step, and learnt to have regularly, year by year, his seed-time and harvest, and to know that there were unseen powers ruling the Universe, whose will might be learnt by mankind, and obedience to whom would bring success and happiness.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nNote.\n\nOn receiving the above legends from Mr. Gomes I pointed out to him the curious fact that in the first legend the tiger\u2014a beast quite unknown in Borneo\u2014plays a prominent part, and suggested that this story may have been of Malay origin. He replies by referring to A. H. Everett\u2019s paper on the Tiger in Borneo, in Journal 5, p. 157, and says \u201cthe \u2018Tree-tiger\u2019 Felis marmorata is common enough. The Dyaks call it by a distinctive name \u2018Kemaung dau\u2019 or \u2018Kemaung raras\u2019 (dau and raras both being words meaning the branch of a tree). These would lead one to suppose that at one time they knew of some other species they called simply \u2018Kemaung.\u2019\u201d Everett refers to traditions of the animal also, among the Sea Dyaks. One may compare these traditions of an animal apparently absent from the country with those of the Mias (Mawas) of the Malay peninsula.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\nNew Malayan Plants.\n\nBy H. N. RIDLEY.\n\nThe following plants apparently undescribed have turned up lately in various collections made in the Peninsula.\n\nSCITAMINE\u00c6.\n\nZingiber Wrayii, Prain mss. A slender plant over a foot tall. Leaves elliptic, lanceolate, glabrous, 9 inches long, 3 inches wide, narrowed at the base but not petioled. Peduncle 4 inches tall covered with large loose sheathing leaves, spike three inches long, ovoid obconic. Bracts thin elliptic $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch wide or less. Flowers solitary yellow. Bracteole spathaceous, lip spotted and marked with purple. Anther narrow linear, beak half an inch long.\n\nUpper Perak at 300 feet elevation (Wray 3735). The only specimen I have seen is in poor condition but it seems a distinct plant from any described, from its rounded head of thin bracts, most of the allied species having cylindric spikes.\n\nElettariopsis cyanescens, n. sp. Rhizome $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch through, violet inside, covered with dry sheaths, stems 18 inches tall, rather slender base, olivaceous. Leaves 8, lanceolate acuminate glabrous 6 inches long $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches wide, hardly petiolate, ligule rounded short. Spike short, peduncle half an inch long covered with long dry lanceolate bracts $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long; flowers four. Ovary oblong pubescent $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long. Calyx tube $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, pubescent at the base, apex long acuminate. Corolla tube narrow $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch longer pubescent, lobes oblong half an inch long $\\frac{1}{6}$ inch wide lip, oblong rounded 1 inch long. All white except the tip of the lip which is blue. Stamen oblong, crest moderately large, stigma large cup-shaped with pubescent edges.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903\nThis pretty species was collected by Mr. W. G. Napier on banks at Bukit Tanga, Seremban; it is nearly allied to *E. pubescens* but has much shorter flower spikes and quite glabrous leaves. The flowers when bruised became of a blue color, perhaps containing indigo.\n\n**Orchideae.**\n\n*Dendrobium mellitum*, n. sp. A very small epiphytic plant, stems few 4 or 5 inches long, very slender above the lowest two or three joints, swollen a little for \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch length. Leaves few terete subulate, 3 inches long \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) inch thick. Flower solitary subterminal, from a short raceme, with small bracts. Pedicel and ovary \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long thick yellow. Upper sepal ovate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, lateral sepals ovate falcate obtuse, mentum short broad and blunt. Petals narrower and shorter, all yellow. Lip three-lobed, lobes broad short curved tips rounded yellow veined with pink inside, midlobe oblong truncate, edged minutely lacinate veins and a patch in the centre pink, three parallel raised veins white on the disc. Anther oblong hemispheric brown, column face flat stained pink.\n\nJohore, at Castlewood on the Sungei Tebrau, May 1903, I found a single plant of this very weak slender little orchid on a tree, and flowered it in the Botanic Gardens. It is allied to *D. clavator*, Ridley, a native of Perak, but has the base of the stem much less swollen, and an entirely different lip. Considering the size of the flower, half an inch across, it was wonderfully strongly scented of honey.\n\n*Thrixspermum crassifolium*, n. sp. An epiphyte on coffee bushes, stem 6 inches tall, thick, leaves close set, thick leathery oblong obtuse, tip rounded, 4 inches long \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches thick, sheaths under half an inch long purple, scapes 3 to 5 inches long stiff, base purple, raceme \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 4 inches long flattened. Bracts distichous \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long close set, ovary and pedicel \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Sepals linear caudate from a broader base \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long, petals narrower linear caudate, all bright yellow. Lip \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, pubescent orange\n\n*Jour. Straits Branch*\npassing into cherry red at the tip. Spur saccate blunt, side lobes arched blunt, middle fleshy blunt ovate. Callus on the disc tongue-shaped rounded depressed in the centre, column white with rounded and broad wings. Anther hemispheric. Fruit linear angled, 3 inches long \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch through.\n\nOn old coffee bushes at Castlewood, Johore. This is allied to *Th. Arachnites* which was common in the same place, but has the short stout leaves and stem of *Th. Scortechinii*. The flowers however are much smaller than any other of this group.\n\n**AMARYLLID\u00c6.**\n\n*Cureuligo megacarpa*, n. sp. A large tufted plant with a stout stem. Leaves dark green oblong lanceolate acuminate glabrous 20 inches long, 3 inches wide, petiole 8 inches long. Peduncle 4 inches long tomentose with large lanceolate acuminate bracts at the base, lower ones hairy on the edge only, upper ones more hairy. Spike broad conic-cylindric 2 to 4 inches long. Flower 1 inch across. Sepals lanceolate acute \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long dirty yellow outside and hairy at the tip. Petals bright yellow, stamens yellow, filaments short, anthers oblong, wavy, hairy, beaked. Fruit 2 inches long, Indian-club shaped \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch through at the base, white seeds very numerous angled ribbed black.\n\nPerak, in forests on the Thaiping Hills at 2000 to 3000 feet elevation.\n\nThis seems to be common on the Thaiping Hills and has probably been hitherto overlooked or taken for a form of *C. latifolia*, but it can hardly be referred to that species, variable as it is. It is larger in all parts of the flower and fruit, the latter being very long club shaped.\n\n**BURMANNIACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Burmannia oblonga*, n. sp. A slender saprophyte 5 inches tall with numerous wiry roots. Stem sparingly or not at all branched. Leaves sheath-like, scales few and distant. Flowers one or two on the ends of the stem \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch long and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch broad across the wings, tube narrow wings oblong with straight edges, angles rounded. Sepals and petals short blunt. Petals much the shorter.\nPenang on rocks at 1500 to 2000 feet altitude (King's collector 2270.)\n\nThis plant should be sought again. It resembles the common *B. coelestis* in the form of its flowers, but is saprophytic. The very broad oblong wings of the perianth tube are very striking.\n\nSince publishing the paper on *Burmanniaceae* in Journal 22, p. 332, I have been able to add to this group of plants:\u2014*B. Championii*, Thwaites. A small ivory white plant like *B. tuberosa*, Becc., but more compact, with a short thick root stock covered with scales, from the Laba river in Selangor, and two additional species of *Thismia*; *Th. grandiflora*, Ridl., with rather large pink flowers collected by Lieut. Kelsall on the Sembrong river in Johor; and *Th. chrysops*, Ridl., a very pretty kind from Mount Ophir with pink and chocolate flowers with a yellow ring round the mouth of the tube; and *Bagnisia crocea* of Beccari, a very oddly shaped little brown species met with in the Perak Hills.\n\n**DIOSCOREACEAE.**\n\n*Dioscorea tennifolia*, n. sp. Stems slender leaves mostly opposite thin glabrous elliptic cuspidate, base rounded 5 nerved 2 to 3 inches long an inch wide, petiole slender an inch long. Male panicle long and slender a foot or more, spikes slender one to three inches long, 3 or more in a whorl, rachis angled minutely pubescent. Flowers very small distant pubescent. Bracts shorter ovate. Sepals oblong ovate. Petals nearly as long oblong obtuse. Stamens 6, filaments fairly long.\n\nSingapore on Bukit Timah (Ridley 4596.)\n\nThis wild yam is remarkable for its very thin leaves and slender stems. I have only met with a male plant but it seems very distinct from all other described species.\n\n**LILIACEAE.**\n\n*Ophiopogon Malayanus*, n. sp. Stem erect stout 4 inches or more tall covered with the scarios sheaths of the fallen leaves and emitting long woody roots. Leaves linear acumi-\nnate, falcate striate, glaucous beneath 9 inches long \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch wide. Scape 4 inches long base nude. Flowers small white. Bracts 2, bases broad ovate, tips linear, outer one \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Pedicel longer. Sepals and petals ovate subacute \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long. Stamens connivent filaments very short, anthers lanceolate. Style terete longer.\n\nPerak at Padang Rengas (W. Fox) Lankawi on Gu-nong Raya (Curtis 2643). The Ophiopogons are abundant in the mountainous regions of North India and China, but get very scanty further south, in fact this is the only one from the Peninsula except the little known and doubtful *O. prolifer* from Penang. Though perhaps as near the common and variable *O. intermedius* of India, it is very distinct in its tall stout stem, broad leaves and ovate petals and sepals.\n\n*Tupistra violacea*, n. sp. Terrestrial stem short and stout, leaves broadly oblong oblanceolate acute narrowed gradually to the base, 3 feet long, 3 inches wide, dark green stiff, spike very dense about 8 inches high. Flowers sessile \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch across, tube hemispheric violet, lobes oblong recurved darker. Anthers 6 sessile elliptic. Style cylindric white, spotted with violet. Stigma club-shaped rounded obscurely three-lobed.\n\nPerak, Bujong Malacca; Penang, Highlands (Curtis).\n\nThis Tupistra differs from the other Peninsular species, *T. grandis*, Ridl., in its smaller lighter colored flowers and the rounded club-shaped stigma which is flat and circular in *T. grandis*. Though not perhaps as striking as that species it is a pretty plant.\n\n*Dracaena conferta*, n.sp. Stem 4 to 10 feet tall, little or not branched. Leaves narrow linear acuminate 24 to 27 inches long \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch wide, base broadly sheathing, midrib very strong at the base, thinning upwards and disappearing before the tip. Raceme 2 feet long, erect, simple or occasionally branched, the base with numerous reduced leaves with broad bases, and acuminate upwards, peduncle rather stout with a few small sheathing leaves, inflorescence long dense. Flowers white, three or four in a tuft, with very short pedicels, and 2 or 3 ovate acuminate bracts \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\ninch long. Perianth tube \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, narrow lobes linear \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Fruit globose as large as a pea.\n\nPerak, Selama at 300 to 500 feet elevation (King's collection 3149); Thaiping Hills near the Tea Gardens. There is also a specimen in Cantley's collections without locality, either from Malacca or Sungei Ujong. This Dracaena is allied to *D. Porteri*, Bak., but has longer and stiffer leaves with a very dense raceme of flowers. It is known to Malays as \"Poko San Juan hutan jantan.\"\n\n*Dr. penangensis*, n.sp. A shrub about 8 or 10 feet tall, with the stem an inch through, leaves when young oblong petioled, adults shorter. Upper leaves lanceolate acuminate 6 to 7 inches long, 1 to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch wide, petiole 1 inch long, sheathing at the base. Panicle erect 8 to 10 inches long with about eleven or twelve stiff branches four inches long or less with lanceolate acuminate bracts at the base \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Flowers in twos and threes on slender pedicels \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Perianth lobes narrow, white. Fruit as large as a cherry, 1 to 3 seeded, scarlet.\n\nPenang at Batu Feringhi on the banks of the stream and at Highlands (Curtis 2369). Dried specimens of this often resemble those of *D. Maingayi* our biggest tree Dracaena, but the living plant is much smaller and the leaves are very variable in form.\n\n*D. Jackiana*, Wall. Cat. 5145. This plant obtained in Penang by Wallich was confused by Baker (Journ. Linn. Soc. XIV, 5-32) with *D. aurantiaca*, Wallich, under the name of *D. spicata* var. *aurantiaca*; and Hooker in the flora of British India puts it under imperfectly known species. I have not seen Wallich's specimens but Dr. Prain says that a plant collected on the Thaiping Hills by Kunstler (No. 2719) is exactly like the Wallichian plant. This plant is I think identical with a plant I collected in Pahang and described under the name of *D. longifolia* (Trans. Linn. Soc. III, 388). Hooker refers the Perak plant to Kurz's *D. pachyphylla*, an Andamanese plant, which however is probably distinct to judge from his description.\n\n*D. pendula*, n.sp. A tall shrub with a moderately stout stem about 6 feet tall, leaves broadly oblong lanceolate acum-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ninate narrowed to the base and subpetiolate. Petiole winged, 8 to 14 inches long $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches wide. Panicle graceful nodding 15 inches or more long with a few distant branches slender 7 or 8 inches long bracts small ovate lanceolate. Flowers in tufts of 2 or 3 distant white on pedicels $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long, slender $\\frac{3}{4}$ to nearly an inch long split into segments for one-half their length; the lobes linear dilated upwards, stamens about as long, anthers oblong.\n\nThis fine plant grows in damp swampy spots in forests. I collected it in the Dindings on Gunong Tungal (No. 9448 of my collections) and have it also from Panchur in Malacca; and from Kwala Dipang and Gopeng from King's collections (Nos. 8279 and 4643). The Malacca specimens have broader and more distinctly petiolate leaves, and the panicle is stouter, but it appears to be specifically the same. It belongs to the *nutantes* section of Dracaena, in which the flowers are in long pendulous lax panicles.\n\n*Dracaena elliptica*, Thunb. I found this common and variable plant growing abundantly in muddy swampy places along the Sungei Tebrau, this Easter. In this locality it had quite a different appearance from the common lowland dry forest form, being altogether a much larger and stouter plant, almost a small tree in fact.\n\nWe have now no less than sixteen species of Dracaena recorded from the Malay Peninsula, but there are doubtless more than this for I have seen several plants in our forests which appear quite distinct from any described, but of which I have not been able to obtain flowers.\n\n**Commelinaceae.**\n\n*Forrestia gracilis*, n. sp. Stem creeping then ascending for about three feet a quarter of an inch through, twiggy dark green and glabrous, internodes 2 inches long terete. Leaves lanceolate acuminate narrowed into a winged petiole, dark green and glabrous above, velvety beneath, margined with red appressed hairs, 8 inches long 2 inches wide, petiole and mouths of sheaths hairy. Heads small\nfew-flowered; bracts ovate pubescent white with a green keel. Sepals oblong hooded ciliate white \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long; petals longer lanceolate acute white; stamens 6; filaments contorted with a tuft of white hairs on the top. Anthers ovate deeply grooved white. Style filiform flexuous acuminate. Stigma minute, ovary small covered with white hair; capsule oblong pink.\n\n*F. mollis*, Clarke, Monogr. Commel. p. 236 (in part, not of Hasskarl).\n\nVery common in woods, Singapore. Tanglin, Pulau Ubin (Ridley 4130), (Walker 155); Johore: Tanjong Bunga (Ridley 6320); Pahang: Pulau Tijau (2381, 2382); Malacca: Sungei Buluh (10512); Selangor: Kuala Lumpor, Sungei Ujong: Gunong Berumbun, (Cantley\u2019s Coll.); Dindings: Telok Sera. Kedah Peak.\n\nIt is curious that this our commonest species has escaped being described till now, but it seems to have been mixed up with the rarer *F. mollis*. It is known as \u201cSetawa betina\u201d and the Sakais use a decoction of its roots for rheumatism.\n\n*F. irritans*, n.sp. Stem tall and stout \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch through, leaves elliptic lanceolate with a broad flat petiole, acuminate 9 inches long, 3 inches across, hairy on both sides, sheaths \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches long, glabrous except for the hispid edges. Heads large and dense over an inch through, densely covered with red spiny hairs, sepals lanceolate covered with similar hairs. Stamens 6, anthers oblong, style filiform.\n\nSelangor, on the Tras route at the 15th mile; Perak Bujong Malacca (Ridley 9784), Sungei Ujong, Bukit Kupayiang (Cantley\u2019s collection.) Rather rare in woods at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. A very distinct species, from its large globose heads of flowers covered densely with sharp pungent red spines. I have never seen fruit of it.\n\n**PALM\u00c6.**\n\n*Pinanga Singaporenensis*, n.sp. Stems tufted dark green 6 to 15 feet tall \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch through; internodes 8 inches long.\nLeaves concolorous or a little paler along the back about 3 feet long, sheath tubular, petiole 8 inches long, leaflets sigmoid acuminate about 13, sub-opposite, terminal one forked; 12 inches long by 3 inches wide or less, nerves 5 to 7. Spike branched erect 4 inches long, with 5 branches. Spathe thin boat-shaped papery with a short point brownish pink 1\u00bd inch long. Rachis cream color scurfy, flowers distichous. Males \u00bc inch long, ivory white. Sepals very small acute. Petals oblique ovate acuminate much larger. Stamens 14 white, filaments very short, anthers oblong, no pistillode. Female petals and sepals broadly oblong pink, edges ciliate, stigma small, sessile papillose circular white.\n\nThis pretty palm occurs in Singapore in forests at Bukit Timah, Mandai, Stagmount and Selitar, and is No. 11267 of my collections. I have not seen it outside Singapore, and it is rather scarce there.\n\n*Ptychoraphis longiflora*, n. sp. Habit and stems of *Pt. Singaporenisis*. Leaf three feet or more long, rachis brown scurfy, leaflets linear acuminate 5-ribbed, alternate about 40 pairs 18 inches long, \u00bd inch wide. Peduncle stout 1 inch long ribbed and scurfy, branches of inflorescence slender 4 or 5 scurfy, 6 or 7 inches long. Flowers in distinct pairs, one male and one female together about 20 pairs on a branch; males \u00be inch long, with two orbicular gibbous bracts at the base. Calyx lobes orbicular fringed. Petals lanceolate obtuse much longer. Stamens 6 shorter than the petals, filaments with a broad base narrowed upwards, anthers oblong dorsifixed. Pistillode conic stout as long as the stamens. Female flowers. Bract single small. Sepals orbicular ciliate. Petals ovate orbicular imbricate, pistil ovoid.\n\nJohore on the top of Gunong Banang at Batu Pahat, (Ridley 1121). Besides this there are two other species of this genus described. *Pt. Singaporenisis*, Becc., the Korintin palm, abundant in the South of the Peninsula, and *Pt. augusta* of the Nicobars, a plant of totally different habit. This new species closely resembles *Pt. Singaporenisis*, but the petals of the male are very much longer.\n\nR A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\nIguanura spectabilis, n. sp. Stem from 3 to 8 feet tall, tufted or solitary very stout over $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch through. Leaves entire and cuneate bilobed at the apex, margins crenulate toothed strongly ribbed, three or more feet long one foot across, petiole. Inflorescence from among the leaves, peduncle over a foot long with two sheaths 6 inches long, and a bract-like ovate acute leaf $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long above, branches stout ascending, six inches long, deep green. Flowers spirally arranged sunk in the rachis. Male, sepals ovate. Petals oblong acute twice as long $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long. Stamens 6, longer than the petals, filaments thick connate at the base with the long cylindric obtuse pistillode. Females, sepals rounded, petals ovate rounded. Fruit elliptic tip curved, black when ripe, $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long, on the thickened rachis.\n\nThis superb palm known to Malays as the \"Teruno\" occurs on the Hermitage Hill in Perak, and at Bruas in the Dindings where it was first obtained by Mr. Curtis and later by myself, (No. 8403) of my collections. Young living plants sent home by Mr. Curtis were described by Dr. Masters in the Gardener's Chronicle (1898, XXIII, 258) under the name of Geonoma Pyn\u00e6rtiana. In the Dindings it forms a bush with numerous short stems, on the Hermitage Hill I found it with a stout tall stem. It is a most beautiful palm when well grown, the broad leaves deep green when adult, and pink when first put out, making it most attractive.\n\nI. ferruginea, n. sp. Stem slender, leaves 18 inches long, petiole four inches long, rachis red-scurfy, leaflets 5 or 6 pairs alternate trapezoid, base narrowed, apex acuminate, margins more or less toothed, 6 inches long 3 inches through. Spathes 6 inches long acuminate. Inflorescence on a peduncle 6 to 8 inches long, red tomentose, branches thick 9 to 11 sometimes branched again, 6 inches long covered with red wool. Flowers scattered distichous inflorescences, covered with red wool. Male flowers glabrous. Sepals ovate rounded, petals lanceolate ribbed, $\\frac{1}{3}$ longer. Female flowers sepals similar, petals shorter and\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nblunter. Drupe cylindric curved, slightly narrowed towards the tip, black, half inch long. Seed cylindric acute curved rugose \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch long; albumen equable.\n\nOn the Thaiping Hills common from about 2000 feet elevation upwards (10684; 11405 of my collection) and Bujong Malacca (Curtis 3164). This palm has the habit of *I. polymorpha*, Becc., but the stouter inflorescence on a longer peduncle and covered with red wool, the larger flowers, and curved cylindric fruit, make it very distinct.\n\nThe Iguanuras are not an easy group of palms to separate, as they are apt to be very variable especially in the form of the inflorescence. There appear to be seven kinds at present known from the Peninsula. The commonest species is *I. geonomaeformis*, Mart. A lowland species with usually one simple spike. Of this there are the following forms: (a) *typica*, with a simple stout tomentose spike, (b) *ramosa*, a similar spike but branched, with 2 or 3 branches, (c) *malaccensis*, with a slender glabrous simple spike (occasionally branched). The leaves of all these forms may be quite entire. *I. Wallichiana*, Hook fil, with a compound inflorescence of several slender branches, is allied to this latter form. It also varies in the form of the leaves. Two plants described by Hooker and Beccari from Scortechini\u2019s collection, viz., *I. diffusa* and *I. parvula*, appear to me to be forms of these species. The first is a large plant with an inflorescence more compound, the second a dwarf abnormal form. I have only however seen sketches of them and very little of the plants appears to have been collected. *I. corniculata* has also only once been collected. The fruit is curiously curved, and is possibly abnormal, *I. polymorpha*, Becc., including *I. brevipes*, Hook. fil., is a distinct plant, not rare on the Thaiping Hills. *I. ferruginea* is allied to it but seems to me to be distinct. *I. bicornis* has curiously bilobed fruit, and occurs also on the Thaiping Hills, but seems to be rare.\n\n*Livistona rupicola*, n. sp. Stem short and thick about 3 feet long and 6 inches through, densely covered with brown fibers from the leaf sheaths. Leaves orbicular about 2 feet across with about 12 leaflets rather narrow very acumi-\nnate tips setaceous; petiole slender 20 inches long nearly thornless. Spadix slender, much branched. Spathes split striate cuspidate dark brown, the two basal ones three inches long, upper ones slightly dilate cuspidate. Branches many long slender with many very long and slender sinuous spikes 1 to 2 inches long, lengthening to 4 inches in fruit. Bracts at the base of the branches linear narrow caducous. Flowers very small globose; sepals rounded gibbous. Petals similar. Staminal crown with 6 subulate teeth.\n\nSelangor limestone rocks at the Kuala Lumpor caves (8285 of my collection), Lankawi Islands, (Curtis).\n\nThis charming palm, the Serdang Batu of the Lankawi Islands, is probably the smallest species of the genus. It is remarkable for its very short thick stem densely covered with brown fibres, the remains of old leaf sheaths. The inflorescence is also very small for the genus. It grows on the limestone rocks of the Selangor caves from the lower part to the top of the cliffs.\n\n*Licuala longopedunculata*, n. sp. Stem 2 to 8 feet tall, 1 to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch through, leaves 4 to 5 feet long orbicular, lobes 6 or more narrowed at the base and broadened upwards with broad blunt teeth 15 to 16 inches long and 3 inches across at the tip, deep green, petiole slender not thorny. Inflorescence slender 3 feet or more long, peduncle broad flattened at the base, quite glabrous over 2 feet long, sheaths distant long, spikes 3 inches long, in fours. Flowers scattered over $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long, rachis moderately stout, calyx urn-shaped sessile not lobed. Petals lanceolate obtuse.\n\nPerak, Gunong Batu Putih (Wray 254) (King's Coll. 8148). I only know this species from the above mentioned collections. Beccari labels it \"L. glabra, foliis latioribus,\" but it is certainly very distinct from *L. glabra*.\n\n*L. (Pericyclla) paniculata*, n. sp. Leaf large, lobes $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long, rather narrow, with short teeth $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch broad. Inflorescence panicled wide-spreading 3 feet long, spathes 6 not split, the lowest 8 inches long $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch wide, upper part reddish, upper spathes shorter dilated upwards. Branches\n\nJour. Straits Branch\npanicle, spikes long and slender 5 to 7, glabrous or scurfy, 7 inches long or less. Flowers scattered sessile \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch long. Calyx cylindric with a broad base, truncate obscurely and irregularly lobed glabrous. Petals short and broad ovate acute. Staminal ring with 6 teeth. Pistil sometimes bilobed, stigma lateral.\n\nI collected a specimen of this on the Hermitage Hill in Perak, and have never seen it since, and unfortunately omitted to record the size of the plant. It is evidently allied to *L. pericycla*, Zipp., *Pericycla penduliflora* of Blume, a native of New Guinea, from which it differs in having solitary sessile, not stalked flowers in pairs. The panicle inflorescence is unique in Malay Licualas as at present known, and is the characteristic of the section *Pericyclus* of which the New Guinea species is the only other one known. It is to be hoped that any one visiting the Hermitage Hill will recollect this curious plant and bring full details of its habit and size.\n\n*Calamus aquatilis*, n. sp. Stem fairly stout about 30 feet long covered with dense bristle-like black spines. Leaf large flagelliferous armed with copious black spines in short rows, petiole a foot long stout black rounded, edge armed with spines of different sizes flattened 2 inches long or less, those at the base black long or slender, leaflets numerous equidistant linear acuminate 1 foot long an inch broad, bristles short scattered along the edges and back, flagellum 4 feet long, hooks in half whorls numerous. Panicle very large and stout, lower sheaths tubular an inch through with numerous decurved spines single or in twos and threes black tipped, chiefly on the back and sides on the upper part. Branches about 2 feet long, secondary spathes tubular unarmed an inch long, male branchlets numerous 6 inches long, spathels tubular about \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch long, spikes subdistichous recurved \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch long green. Spathellules saucer-shaped with a small ovate limb, sepals oblong lanceolate. Petals as long oblong lanceolate thicker. Stamens, filaments rather long slender, anthers long narrow. Female branchlets 2 to 3 inches long, spathels funnel-shaped. Spathellules\nsmall saucer-shaped. Flowers solitary, sepals ovate as long as the petals and quite similar. Fruit small globular beaked $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long scales in 6 whorls, rhomboidal as broad as long, yellow or brownish yellow, tips darker, grooved.\n\nThis rattan is common in tidal river swamps, and is known as \"Rotan Bakau.\" There is a trade rattan of the same name but I am not yet certain that it belongs strictly to this plant. The general appearance of this species when out of flower is that of *Daemonorops angustifolius*. It does not seem to flower very frequently, as I have seldom found it in flower or fruit, abundant as it is, which is probably why it has never hitherto been described. Professor Beccari who is engaged on a work on our rattans to be published in the Annals of the Botanic Gardens of Calcutta, considers it to be quite a distinct plant from any described.\n\nI have met with it in Singapore, on the Serangoon Road, and at Changi (6275 of my collections), Johore, Panchur on the Johore river; on the Sungei Tebrau river, and at Batu Pahat (11216), and in Pahang at Kuala Pahang.\n\n**AROIDEAE.**\n\n*Cryptocoryne purpurea*, n. sp. Aquatic, stem creeping stoloniferous. Leaves ovate or elliptic ovate, base broad 3 inches long $1\\frac{3}{4}$ inch wide, petioles 4 inches long, peduncle short about half an inch long, spathe 3 or more inches long, tube twisted $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch through, white, limb ovate caudate $\\frac{1}{2}$ to 1 inch long, half an inch wide deep purple brown with a yellow mouth, pustular, tail $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long, valve over the inflorescence oblong truncate pale yellow. Female flowers 6 to 8 connate in a circle, styles very short, stigmas discoid, neuters above the pistils 5 or more, nude portion of spadix slender. Male flowers few yellow obtuse, appendix small elliptic clubbed.\n\nJohore, Kota Tinggi (4214 of my collections). This plant cultivated in the Singapore Botanic Gardens for several years, was sent to Kew Gardens where it flowered\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nand was figured in the Botanical Magazine plate 7719 under the name of *C. Griffithii*. It is however quite distinct from that in its more numerous, female flowers, smaller appendix to the spadix, and much longer tube. It grows very readily in water, and is perhaps the easiest to cultivate. I have only seen it in the one locality mentioned, our commonest species being the short tubed *C. Griffithii*.\n\n*Typhonium fulvum*, n. sp. A small herb with a short stem above the ground propped on strong roots. Leaves 5 or 6 ovate or deltoid hastate 2 to 3 inches long 2 inches wide deeply cordate, apex acute, lobes rounded, petiole 2\u00bd inches long. Peduncle \u00bc inch long, spathe with a green base dilated \u00bc to \u00bd inch long, limb 2 inches long \u00bd inch broad; subacute or acuminate purple-veined, tip green. Spadix about as long. Appendage orange brown cylindric from a thick base tapering upwards, below a short nude portion. Male portion of about 6 rows of oblong yellowish anthers, then a longer nude portion. Neuters numerous horn-shaped white up-curved. Females in one whorl oblong, one ovuled.\n\nSelangor at the limestone caves near Kuala Lumpor (8165) also found in Lankawi Islands by Curtis.\n\nThis odd little aroid is remarkable for the stem standing up supported on its roots above ground after the manner of a Pandanus, a habit not observed in any other species, the rest of them having small underground tubers.\n\n*T. filiforme*, n. sp. A very small herb, tuber globose \u2153 inch through. Leaves 2 or 3 deltoid hastate acuminate, lobes divaricate acute 2 or 3 inches long, \u00be to 1\u00bd inch wide, petiole slender 2 to 5 inches long. Peduncle \u00bc inch long. Spathe 3 inches, base elliptic \u00bc inch long olive green, limb linear very narrow, apex eventually coiled up yellowish spotted with red. Spadix very slender 3\u00bd inches long, appendix ochre yellow filiform nearly 3 inches long, male portion short below them a long slender nude portion, neuters filiform contorted long, female flowers few oblong.\n\nP. A. Soc., No. 41, 1902\nI found this at the foot of the limestone cliffs at Kuala Dipang in Perak. It is evidently allied to *T. bulbiferum*, Dalz., of the Concan, differing in the absence of any trace of bulbils, the longer appendage and neuters, and longer bare space below the male flowers.\n\n*Amorphophallus Malaccensis*, n. sp. Tuber 4 inches through hemispheric with a depressed top. Leaves not certainly known. Peduncle 7 inches tall rough. Spathe tube wide trumpet-shaped 3 inches long, limb broad rounded six inches long and as wide. Spadix longer, appendage fusiform acuminate 6 inches long rugose hollow, loose textured and fibrous within. Male portion one inch long; anthers crowded oblong. Female portion 2\u00bd inches long. Flowers numerous, ovaries ovoid, style \u00bc inch long.\n\nI only know this from some dried specimens which were collected by a native collector on Bukit Panchor in Malacca. It belongs to the section including *Amorphophallus*, *Rex.*, and *campanulatus*, but is distinct in its longer peduncles, and longer narrower appendage. I have several times met with foliage of a plant very much resembling that of a *Rex* with a tall stout dark green scabrid petiole which may perhaps belong to this species. A very large spike of fruit over a foot longer with berries half an inch long which was obtained by Mr. Hervey on Bukit Payong in Malacca is very probably the fruit of this plant. It should be looked for again.\n\n*A. minor*, n. sp. Tuber an inch through. Leaf petiole slender 9 inches long, blade three branched each branched again, leaflets numerous thin green (red when young) lanceolate acuminate inaequilateral 3 inches long by one inch wide, nerves numerous close joining an inner intramarginal one. Peduncle 8 to 12 inches long with loose brown sheaths at the base, the largest truncate 4 inches long. Spathe 3 to 4 inches long convolute at the base lanceolate acuminate 1 to 1\u00bd inch across. Spadix 3 inches long. Appendage cylindric-conic an inch long. Male portion as long as the appendage. Flowers very numerous crowded. Females few. Style very short.\n\nJour.

Boden Kloss.\n\nIn 1900 I spent about eleven weeks, including the months of August and September, cruising about with Dr. W. L. Abbott in his Schooner \"Terrapin\" which had just been launched. Our purpose was to make collections of mammals and birds and of any other objects zoological that might fall in our way. As the islands of the Southern China Sea amongst which the time was spent, have received either but scanty notice or none at all, the following pages may have some interest. Unfortunately for the present purpose I kept only the very baldest log of our voyage so that the account of our experiences, drawn up after an interval of three years, is far from being as satisfactory as I could wish.\n\nI was unable to accompany the schooner when she sailed at the beginning of July so arranged to join her at Linga, and in the middle of the month therefore left Singapore in the S.S. Malacca.\n\nWe stopped a night at Rhio en route and I was thus enabled to get from the Resident a permit to travel in the Rhio-Linga Dependency in which the whole of our cruise was to take place. The town of Rhio is prettily situated and laid out, but very small and quiet; it possesses an hotel and a good fruit-market; every other one of its shops appears to be run as a pawn-broking establishment. A long walk in the surrounding country showed me nothing more inviting than clayey hills covered with bracken and the S'ndudu tree (Melastoma polyanthum), and everywhere dotted with Chinese tombs.\n\nFrom Rhio to Linga\u2014we called at Sinkep Island on the way with provisions for the tin mines\u2014was, I think, four days steaming through smooth seas and green islands. The Macassar is an old wooden tub capable of doing about 7 knots in calm water with the wind astern. The only accommodation\nshe could offer was the open bridge crowded with natives, where I found room for a deck chair. Had this been all there would have been nothing to kick at, but unfortunately the vessel swarmed with a certain highly objectionable and active *Rhynchota* that spoilt all pleasure, and when I hailed with delight the appearance of the \"Terrapin\" lying off Tanjong Buton on the south side of Linga, I was, after four days of an inferno, in a state that I had never been in before and fervently pray never to attain again.\n\n**Linga.**\n\nLying about mid-way between Singapore and Banka, Linga is an island of irregular shape about 33 miles in length in a north-west and south-east direction, and is surrounded by smaller islands of various sizes. Unlike its near neighbour Sinkep, it is not worked for tin, and is best known as being at one time the head quarters of the numerous pirates who used to ravage the western seas of the Malay Archipelago in the early part of last century.\n\nThe schooner had to anchor a mile or so from the land since off-shore for some distance extended banks of soft black mud through which we were compelled to wade when the tide was low while at other times the sea broke on them with some force for the roadstead is exposed to south-easterly winds. At Tanjong Buton were a few Chinese *kedais* and the house of a Dutch Assistant-Resident (now withdrawn) and from here a road had been made to the town of Linga.\n\nThe best collecting ground was on the outskirts of the village of Maruang, lying two or three miles away between the road and the sea. The surrounding country was, for the most part, a sago swamp, but in the fruit plantations of the Kampong certain birds and small mammals were numerous. The village itself consisted of a settlement of Sumatran Malays, the houses\u2014about forty in number\u2014built in two orderly rows with the mosque in the centre. The thousands of huge durian trees that surround it, were just then fruiting and at the little watch-houses in the plantations freshly fallen durians could be had in piles at a cent or two apiece while the few small steamers that call were constantly taking cargoes up to Singapore.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nLearning from the people of the village that flocks of fruit-bats visited their fruit-trees nightly, we, one evening when there was a little moonlight, went up the plantation for the purpose of obtaining specimens.\n\nAccompanied by half the boys of the Kampong, we took up places beneath a huge rambutan tree\u2014the gathering point of great numbers of bats\u2014but for a time made very poor practice at the dark bodies flitting between the branches in the dim light. Swarms of mosquitoes did not help to improve matters. At length however I hit on a plan that gave better results; choosing a large bunch of fruit that was frequently visited, I rested my gun against a convenient tree-trunk and took careful aim at it. Holding the barrels steadily in position all I had now to do was to stand up and watch the target: whenever a bat settled on that particular bunch I pressed the trigger and the shot was invariably followed by a thud on the ground or crashing and squawking among the branches as a wounded animal dropped slowly downwards. In a couple of hours the boys had picked up a dozen specimens of *Pteropus vampyrus* with which we returned to the boat, leaving sundry others to be recovered on the morrow.\n\nOn the way back a bullet was kept in readiness for wild-pig. None were seen, however, though nightly rootings along the road showed their presence in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe following day was given over to the preparation of skins and skeletons from the specimens obtained.\n\nThe 24th of July, our last day in the island, was spent in visiting Linga Kampong to bid farewell to the Sultan and to buy supplies for the voyage ahead.\n\nThe town is distant about an hour and a half from the sea and is reached by a road constructed by the Dutch Assistant-Resident. Although roughly made it is passable for the Sultan's gharry and for the few local rickshaws which, old and dilapidated, generally traverse it at a walking pace.\n\nFor the first two miles it runs though a swamp planted with sago palms, then coming out on hard clay ground is bordered with scrub and lallang until near the town it passes through plantations of various fruit-trees, sugar-cane and bananas.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\nAlthough the actual control is in the hands of the Dutch from whom he receives an income of some $80,000 a year, the Sultan of Linga is nominally ruler over neighbouring parts of Sumatra, all the islands between Sinkep and Singapore and all the various small groups in the Southern China Sea.\n\nThe town of Linga\u2014his capital\u2014is situated on the banks of a stream navigable by small praus at high water, about two miles from its mouth. To the north a fantastically split peak, the highest summit of the Linga group, rises to a height of 3,921 feet, densely covered with jungle and scrub and scarcely ever free from clouds.\n\nThe population of the town, Malays and Chinese, number about 6,000. All the houses are built on piles, those of the Chinese on a muddy expanse by the banks of the river which not infrequently overflows. A number of substantial brick buildings have at one time also been erected by them but are now in a ruinous condition.\n\nThe houses of the Malays, shaded by fruit trees, arecas and coco-palms were scattered about without regard to orderly arrangement. Amongst them stood the school, which was apparently well patronised, and the Sultan\u2019s palace, a large and ugly barn-like structure of wood.\n\nThe Sultan was absent and we proceeded at once to the Chinese portion of the town to get through with our marketing.\n\nThe Chinese community is under a \u201cCaptain China\u201d who in the Linga Sultanate is responsible to the Dutch only for the good behaviour of his charge and who collects for them the poll tax of $3 a head every year.\n\nThe bazaar was of fair size and sold the usual merchandise found in such places that includes various articles ranging from a bottle of scent to an onion. Our requirements of rice, vegetables, curry stuffs etc., were soon satisfied and from the sarong shops kept by Klings we got a few European cotton sarongs for use on board. The Malays here were apparently like the lillies of the field. \u201cThey toil not neither do they spin,\u201d and it was with difficulty that we got from them even a few eggs and chickens.\n\nWe returned to the \u201cTerrapin\u201d by way of the river in a canoe with a small roof of kajangs. The water was very low\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nand paddling between muddy banks we were unable to see anything of the country on either side. Crocodiles are said to be numerous but none were met and after crossing the bar at the river mouth, we got up sail and in short time reached the schooner.\n\nPrevious to my arrival Dr. Abbott had made an expedition to the peak. He spent eight days in a hut built at an altitude of about 1000 feet and ascended on three occasions to 3000 feet, but each time the mist was so dense that he could not proceed higher. Animal life was remarkably scarce in the mountain forest; the lotong, however, was seen occasionally and at the highest elevation reached the \"house\" of a pig was found. Birds were very few in number. The mountain seemed to offer most attraction to a botanist: orchids occurred in great abundance.\n\nIn order to give a complete list of the mammals known from Linga I have included here the further material obtained by Dr. Abbott during a second visit to the island in 1901. All species that were described for the first time from both collections are distinguished by the addition of sp. nov.\n\n1. Semnopithecus maurus.\n2. Macacus cynomolgus.\n3. Pteropus vampyrus.\n4. Tupaia tana.\n5. T. malaccana.\n6. Viverra tangalunga.\n7. Arctogalidia simplex, sp nov.\n8. Tragulus javanicus.\n9. T. pretiosus, sp. nov.\n10. Sus vittatus.\n11. Ratufa notabilis, sp. nov.\n12. Sciurus vittatus.\n13. Sciurus tenuis.\n14. S. notatus.\n15. Rhinosciurus laticaudatus\n16. Mus jingensis, sp. nov.\n17. M. fremens, sp. nov.\n18. M. firmus, sp. nov.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\nThe birds of Linga show no peculiarities and do not differ from those occurring in the adjacent mainlands. The most complete collection recorded is that made by the native hunters of the late Mr. A. H. Everett. The list of species is given in \"Novitates Zoologicae.\"\n\nPulo Taya and the Nyamok Islets.\n\nWe left Linga at 2 a.m. on the morning of July 25th bound for a group of three small islands forty miles to the south-eastward. With the wind ahead all the way it was not until mid-day on the 26th that we anchored off Taya the largest of the three.\n\nThe island is fairly steep-to, of granite formation rising to a double peak about 600 feet high. It is about a mile and a half long north and south, oval in shape and covered with forest.\n\nLanding on the east side on a sandy bay in a bight between the hills we found at the south end of the beach just within the jungle a spring of good water. Near the shore the bay was blocked up with coral over which at low tide we had to scramble. A little party of Orang Laut in their crazy praus, visiting the island for \"ikan merah\" for which it is well known, told us that rats, squirrels, and a \"biawak\" were to be got; but during the three occasions we were ashore we saw neither. The only birds obtained were the Nicobar (*Caloenas nicobarica*) and Nutmeg pigeons (*Myristicirora bicolor*), which last occurs on nearly all islands in this region: the glossy starling (*Calornis chalybeus*) with dark metallic green plumage and red irrides: a gaudy little sunbird (*Anthotheptes rhodokama*), the Eastern reef heron (*Lepterodius sacer*), and *Haleyon chloris*, the blue-and-white kingfisher. Last and best of all was one specimen of *Columba grisea*, a bird of extreme rarity in collections.* In general appearance it is somewhat similar to the cream-and-black Nutmeg pigeon if the former colour were replaced by a pale grey.\n\nOn the Nyamok Islands about a mile north of Taya, two islets, the larger no more than two or three hundred yards in\n\n* The British Museum Catalogue and Pigeons records a single specimen only.\n\nJour Straits Branc\ndiameter, we shot a blue-and-white king fisher and the reef heron.\n\nThese islets, neither of which is more than 150 feet high, are covered with thin jungle in which we saw several specimens of the Nicobar pigeon\u2014the \"burong mis\" or golden bird of the Malays.\n\nTaya was left at midday on the 28th and soon after making sail a squall from the south-west struck us. We ran before it, goosewinged with scandalised sails, the seas racing up behind and breaking in showers of spray under the counter. In the couple of hours it lasted we had made nearly twenty miles of our way to Pulo Pengiki Besar and afterwards sailing with a wind that allowed an easy course to be laid, anchor was dropped in a bay on the north side of the island at six o'clock on the evening of July 31st.\n\nPulo Pengiki Besar or St. Barbe Island.\n\nSeen from a distance Pengiki appears like two or three separate islands, being lower at the centre than in the north-east and west. Its height is about 750 feet and it is covered with trees except at those places on the hill sides where large outcrops of rock occur. On such spots what vegetation exists is of a sparse and stunted type.\n\nFor some distance from the shore a reef filled up the bay where, indeed, the conditions are most favourable for the growth of corals. As one rowed over the pellucid green water, looking down they were to be seen in indescribable variety\u2014great heads formed like massive boulders and tiny sprays no less delicate than a piece of moss. Corals of all shapes and shade were there\u2014pink, grey, yellow, brown, blue, green, red, while among the crevices and branches swam fish as gorgeous as their surroundings\u2014little fellows half an inch in length, blue, red, and yellow and others of larger size whose brilliancy of colouring passed almost unremarked by comparison with the grotesqueness of their forms.\n\nIn the centre of the bay and connected at low tide with the shore stood a rocky islet frequented by numbers of the white tern (*Sterna bergii*) with rose-tinted breasts from which the flush fades immediately after death.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\nFrom several small streams within the jungle good water may be obtained; they are, however, too weak to force a passage to the sea and must be looked for above the beach.\n\nAt Pengiki we spent two days but found the island, although of fair size\u2014three miles long and nearly two wide\u2014very scantily furnished with animal life. Pigeons both Nicobar and bicolor, were fairly numerous as were the glossy starling and blue-and-white kingfisher, but no other birds were seen with the exception of an eagle and a single grey wagtail. A python and viper were obtained and a glimpse was caught of a small animal in a tree that may have been a musang. Macaque monkeys (cynomolagus?) were, however, common and a new species of squirrel (Sciurus mimiculus), a dwarf form of S. prevostii, was obtained.\n\nThe jungle was of fair height but possessed scarcely any undergrowth and all day long in the cool green light, swarms of bats (Hipposideros barbensis, sp. nov.) flitted about circling in and out amongst the trees.\n\nWhen we left\u2014in darkness at three o\u2019clock one morning\u2014the anchor proved to be jammed fast in the coral. It was only by setting full sail, after all other means were exhausted, that we were enabled to break it free.\n\nThe Tambelans.\n\nThe Tambelan group, about sixty miles to the northward, was the next place of call. With a wind abeam and a squall to help we arrived in twelve hours and anchored between two small islands, Selendang and Gilla. Exploring the former in the afternoon we got two or three birds. It possesses a curious cone-shaped hill about 700 feet high; Gilla is much lower. The scenery in the little strait between the two was very lovely\u2014jungle and coco palms, granite boulders and yellow sand, bright blue sea and waves of white surf at the far end of the passage.\n\nEarly next morning (Aug. 4th) we boated over to Great Tambelan and met many canoes going off to the outlying islands. The sea was running very high a few hours later and the sail back again was somewhat exciting.\n\nThe Tambelan group consists of the three principal islands of Tambelan, Bunoa and Wai, with a number of smaller islands\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nmassed fairly close together over thirteen or fourteen miles of sea. Only Great Tambelan is inhabited but on the others the people have numerous ladangs and pondoks. The population consists of Malays, 500-600 in number.\n\nBunoa.\n\nAs Gilla and Selendang were too small to be productive, after one more visit we transferred operations to Pulo Bunoa close by. The islands form roughly two parallel lines lying N. E. and S. W. Bunoa is the largest of the south-western group. It is about four miles long and two and a half wide, on the whole gently rounded in contour with gradual forested hills rising to a height of 900 feet. On the northern side is a bay that offers good anchorage in the S. W. monsoon.\n\nWe tramped through the island for three days after birds and beasts. A form of \"Krah\" was common and from those collected here, and later on in the Anambas, a new species Macacus pumilus has been described which differs from M. cynomolagus in being paler and much smaller. The little pied hornbill (Anthroceros convexus) was numerous; their chattering resounded through the jungle like the yelping of puppies. Once in stalking them I lost my bearings and at last crossing a slight trail followed it up on the wrong hand and passing by a little stream that suddenly disappeared subterraneously, came on a ladder path and log-slide running down a steep hill side to a strange beach that in the end proved to be on the further side of the island. Thinking it easier to return to the boat by following the coast than by retracing my steps, I let myself in for a five or six miles scramble in mangroves and mud, over soft sand and rocks, across coral reefs and through water breast high before I found the schooner again.\n\nArenga palms are numerous in the jungle and are worked for sugar by the natives. The trees are tapped near the top and bamboo receptacles are fastened beneath the incisions to receive the sap. Here and there we came across the boiling-down furnaces that consisted of large flat iron pans raised above the fire on clay walls. Before concentration the sap is carefully strained through a bunch of fibre to remove impurities and is then boiled down either to a treacly consistency or to a still\ngreater density when it is poured into bamboo moulds and crystallizes into a dark brown sugar.\n\nA coconut shell of the warm sweet liquid in its early stage is most refreshing during the course of a hard tramp and was always offered when we passed a concentrator at work.\n\nGreat Tambelan.\n\nOn the 8th of August we made sail at day-break and with a native pilot crossed to Tambelan Island and anchored in the harbour three hours later.\n\nThis, the largest island of the group, is nearly $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles long and roughly triangular. Near its north-east coast are several hills, the highest of which\u2014Tambelan Peak\u2014rises to an elevation of 1300 feet while a short distance to the eastward of it is Thumb Peak, a remarkable pointed hill 950 feet high. The island is nearly divided into two parts by an inlet of the sea which runs in a north-easterly direction into its western side. This creek is nearly a mile in width but is fringed and choked with reefs. The remains of a breakwater built of coral cross it about a mile and a half from the entrance. A stockade once ran behind this and a fort stood on the shore, all being constructed to defend the village which lies higher up, from the attacks of Illanum pirates who occasionally visited these islands years ago.\n\nWe threaded our way amongst the coral and anchored in a clear patch of water near a couple of small native schooners, well protected by reefs from any south-westerly swell and in sight of the Kampong. The conditions permitted some delightful baths in perfect safety for the Malays said crocodiles and sharks never ventured into the neighbourhood. The pilot refused money payment for his services but gladly received drugs for an ailing relative, and later when the people took to bringing us specimens they always preferred medicine of sorts by way of recompense.\n\nWe first landed on the southern side of the harbour and climbed a small hill of granite and laterite. It was covered with scanty scrub and absolutely devoid of life. A reward however lay in the view. Below the slope of the hill stretched the still green waters of the harbour, purple-patched with coral; on the further side sand, jungle and palms, while the Kampong\u2014a\nlong line of brown houses on land and water, following the course of the shore\u2014lay higher up the creek. Beyond rose the jungle and hills, with the quaintly-shaped Thumb Peak\u2014abrupt and solitary\u2014standing out prominently against the sky.\n\nA white man is a bit of a curiosity in these parts and for the rest of the day it was but seldom that twenty or thirty heads were not poked through the skylight windows watching our goings-on.\n\nNext morning we went up to the village to visit the Dato and show him a letter written by the Sultan of Linga who, under the Dutch, rules all these islands.\n\nA roofed-in platform with benches and flight of steps forms a pleasant landing and lounging place before the village, near which was anchored a stranger vessel\u2014a little prau about the size of our whaleboat packed with a large and unprepossessing family of Orang Laut.\n\nFrom the *jambatan* we were led to the Dato. The village consists of about 250 houses threaded by tidy paths and supplied with water by numerous bamboo *penchurans* leading from the higher ground in the rear. No women were visible but from the houses came the clacking of numerous looms: good strong sarongs are made here, dyed, however, with aniline colours purchased in Singapore: indeed though Dutch possessions, the Straits dollar was the only coin current in all the islands of our cruise. Passing the mosque, a pucca triple-roofed structure of wood and stone, and a number of old cannon that lay scattered about, we reached the Dato\u2019s, a well-built shingle-roofed house, with a long enclosed verandah running its length, in which we were welcomed.\n\nThe Dato was an amiable old gentleman, treated by his people as he treated the Sultan\u2019s letter\u2014with great respect. Chairs were arranged at one end of the room and when we took our seats the lower end was crowded by the populace while women stared through the latticed windows of the inner rooms. An official, bent double with respect, read the Sultan\u2019s hukum, which explained our object and recommended all assistance, and then the Dato and the audience descanted on the local fauna, its paucity in those islands and how much better off other places\u2014Pahang, for instance\u2014were in this res-\npect. On leaving, the hand-camera was brought into play for the first time and all the juveniles among our escort fled screaming.\n\nThe little community appeared to be very well off and was one of the few places remarkable for the absence of the ubiquitous Chinaman, a solitary trader of which race seemed to have been recently starved out. On the shores of the harbour twenty to thirty schooners of local construction were drawn up; these seemed to be owned by the villagers in general, and with them all the trade was done and all the produce shipped from time to time to Singapore direct.\n\nShip-building bulked large as an industry of the village and we saw half a dozen or more hulls from thirty to forty feet in length, in all stages of construction. These vessels are built of locally grown chengai and merbau and are fastened with tree-nails throughout. Each seemed to be the work of about a couple of men in partnership and takes two years or so to complete. A few frames are first set up and completely planked and afterwards the other ribs are fitted in until sufficient strength is attained. It was said that a 35 foot craft (10-tonner) could be purchased all complete for $350, and although perhaps their lines were capable of some improvement they were fine roomy little boats strongly built of thoroughly sound material. The local canoe, however, was a thing of beauty; strongly built of two prettily contrasting white and brown hardwoods without a single nail, with upward-projecting stem and stern and gaudily painted bird's-head bracket on the bow to support the lowered sail and mast, it was as workmanlike as it was handsome. The sail was a square cotton lug slung by the middle of the yard and set with the forward end of the boom snubbed down to the lee-bow well forward.\n\nHaving sent the Dato a photograph of the \"Terrapin\" we received a call one evening from him and his understudy to acknowledge the picture and to obtain a little medicine. Amongst other things he told us how in his boyhood the village suffered the last attack from pirates and how all the inhabitants were driven out by the raiders to a hill at the back of the island where they built a fort of refuge. In those days there were only about a hundred people on the group.\nBut little was to be obtained by way of supplies from the village. Coconuts and copra were plentiful, eggs and fowls scarce: we could get plenty of bananas and one evening bought from a canoe homeward bound from fishing, three splendid parrot fish (*Scarus* sp.), weighing together between sixty and seventy pounds for a dollar!\n\nThe jungle was intersected with paths leading to the arenga palms and trying-down sheds and by shooting along them and in the cocopalms we obtained a new squirrel (*Sciurus abbotti*), a pale form of *S. notatus*.\n\nAfter investigating the birds and mammals on several occasions with good results, we devoted a morning to butterflies getting about a dozen species round the village and along the forest paths. The fauna of the island was neither numerous nor diversified and on the morning of the 15th we moved the schooner over to Pulo Wai, anchoring off its N. E. coast.\n\n**Pulo Wai.**\n\nThis island is the most north-westerly of the group. It is about two miles long and rises in several peaked hills attaining near the eastern end a height of 1000 feet. Being farther from the Kampong than the others it is least visited but plantations of coconuts and bananas, plantains, yams and sweet potatoes are common on its hillsides, a good deal of which are cleared.\n\nIt provided us with a handsome squirrel (*Sciurus mimellus* sp. nov.) with black, chestnut and white pelage\u2014a dwarf form of the well-known *S. prevosti*.\n\nA walk across the island proved very bad travelling but from the hills a distant view was obtained of Gap Rock about twelve miles to the northeast. This remarkable islet consists solely of two huge boulders\u2014the larger of which is 124 feet above the water\u2014lying on a flat platform of rock utterly devoid of soil or vegetation.\n\nThis was the last of the Tambelans visited and I will therefore conclude this notice of them with a list of the principal collections.\n\n**Mammals.**\n\n1. Macacus pumilus, sp. nov.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.*\n2. Pteropus lepidus, sp. nov.\n3. Megaderma spasma.\n4. Tupaia bunoae, sp. nov.\n5. Tragulus sp. (said to occur).\n6.

Lepterodius sacer.\n\nThe Rocky Islets.\n\nEleven miles in seven hours is not good sailing but it was afternoon when we landed on the Rocky Islets\u2014the Pulo Mandariki of the Malays. They consist of two small barren islets and a rock. The sea is steep to all round and the schooner lay on and off with a kedge anchor hanging down while we care-\n\n* It is interesting to note that no birds smaller than the fly catcher have effected a lodgement on the Tambelan group.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nfully humoured the swell and jumped ashore on the larger of the two, which is northernmost. The central islet which is next in size is much more broken and is a wild confusion of little peaks and precipices.\n\nClimbing to the top of our islet (134 feet) we found that quartz predominated in its formation, which presented an exceedingly rough surface where grew here and there only the scantiest tufts of coarse grass. Two or three dead bushes crowned the summit and everywhere the ground was fouled with the guano of sea-birds that use the rocks as a breeding place.\n\nThe air was full of squalling, squawking, croaking gulls and among the crevices of the island's surface we discovered numbers of nestlings, and a few eggs all addled. The birds were of two kinds:\u2014a black noddy with grey head (*Anous stolidus*) and a tern (*Sterna* sp.) with black head and wings, grey back and grey-white breast. The remaining fauna included fishing-eagles, crabs and a solitary bee. The mid-day sun, shining down on the bare rocks, made the heat, combined with the scent of the birds, overpowering and we soon left, having knocked over sufficient specimens for the collection in a very few minutes.\n\n**Saddle Island.**\n\nInstead of proceeding straight to the Anambas we stopped for a night and morning at Pulo Kayu Ara, a little island about half a mile long covered with jungle and thus contrasting strongly with the place we had just left. It is nearly 400 feet high and is formed of two round hills having a dip between that make together a contour from which it has gained its English name.\n\nThe feet of the hills were fringed with black rocks but between lay a delightful little beach inhabited by a pair of white-collared kingfishers, on which we landed and found the laying places and tracks of turtles: the sea, of wonderful limpidity invited to a bath. The only birds seen in the forest were fruit pigeons and glossy starlings,\u2014the only terrestrial mammal a squirrel (*Sciurus klossii*), a small blue-bellied member of the *notatus* group. The trees bore considerable quantities of fruit,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 41, 1903.\nparticularly noticeable being wild nutmegs and mangosteens, the last of which seemed to form the principal food of the squirrels. To complete the tale of our acquisitions were the small fruit bat (*P. lepidus*) previously taken in the Tambelans, some geckoes and two or three tree-snails.\n\nWaiting until the tide turned in our favour we left in the afternoon, bound for the Anambas, a hundred miles away. Until sunset next evening the wind held light but then with a series of squalls coming up from astern we made from six to seven knots an hour, the breeze constantly shifting a point and back and compelling us to make continual gybes. Late at night we entered the channel between Pulos Peling and Riabu and dropped anchor close to the former.\n\n**The Anambas Islands.**\n\nOn the morning of the 17th it was evident that we were fortunate to have anchored when we did; for dead ahead, just a hundred yards away, an abrupt bit of coral reef on which the schooner could have piled up very awkwardly, lay five or six feet beneath the surface.\n\nPulo Peling, which we worked for a day, is only a small island without inhabitants where clearings were just being commenced; we saw no mammals except many monkeys, but got a little blue brown flycatcher (*Cyornis tickelli*) with reddish breast for the first time on the cruise.\n\nRiabu, which we next prospected, is much larger, being high and about six miles in length. It possesses a very good bay affording excellent harbourage in the S. W. monsoon as it is only open between N. and W. As we rowed along the shore we shot a large \"baiawak\" from the boat and then landing found the country very rocky and densely covered with forest. Our best catch was a squirrel\u2014the only one seen\u2014a pale and rather small form of *Sciurus notatus*. It has been named *anambensis* and occurs on most of the islands of the Anambas group but the Riabu specimen differs from the others in having the audital bull\u00e6 markedly smaller.\n\nAt daylight on the 19th there was scarcely a breath of wind and after getting up anchor we nearly drifted on to the reef.\nthrough which we had so nearly come to grief before, but missing it with the rudder by a bare yard we soon afterwards got a fair breeze and, running past eight or ten small islands, made Terempa, which is the chief kampong of the Anambas, by 2 p.m.\n\nThe Anambas Islands are situated in lat. 3\u00b0N., long. 106\u00b0E. and extend over an area 65 geographical miles long N. and S. and 55 miles wide. They practically form two groups of which, though the western includes the larger island, the other is greater in area. All the islands are hilly, covered with forest, and afford numerous bays and channels where safe anchorage may be found in spite of the coral reefs that occur everywhere. Although the population is mainly confined to the larger islands, Malays are thinly scattered over most of the rest and there are Chinese Settlements in either group.\n\nSiantan.\n\nTerempa lies in a little bay on the north coast of Siantan which is the largest of the easterly Anambas, having probably an area of about 20,000 acres: it is densely covered with heavy forest, is very hilly and rises 1855 feet.\n\nThe kampong is a thriving little place with a Chinese cemetery, twenty or thirty Chinese shops with galvanised iron roofs and a good proportion of its population Chinese. A small steamer the \"Banka\" calls once or twice a month and yet it is against these islands that the dear old China Seas Directory (3rd edition) still contains the antediluvian warning that \"it is dangerous to land without due precaution, for the Malays who reside on them may probably massacre or make slaves of strangers if they perceive a convenient opportunity.\" A propos of this sort of thing I remember once asking a Danish sailor whom I met on the other side of Sumatra whether he used the English Admiralty publications for these seas, but the skipper of that very old-fashioned little barque the \"Hans of Fano\" shook his head and replied that he always consulted certain continental sailing directions as our own were far too obsolete and scrappy.\n\nTerempa is built along the head of the bay and has a small saltwater creek opening out behind it. As one faces it from seaward an orderly street of Chinese stores with the opium-farmer's place and a Chinese school lie to the left with a few\nMalay houses at the far end. In the centre is the Dato\u2019s house\u2014a wooden building in civilised style; a large house belonging to the Sultan of Linga and then stretching away on the right the houses of the bulk of the Malays: behind the flat on which the village is built, hills covered with jungle and coco palms rise steeply in a half circle, the whole having a very pretty effect which, however, is quite matched by the view presented from behind the town from whence looking down the long slope of the hill one sees the roofs of the houses, the semi-circular bay with boats lying at anchor, and then across a strip of water the forested hills that rise opposite.\n\nA mile and more to the north of Siantan lie the two fairly large islands of Mobur and Mata with a channel about a mile wide between them. Between Mata and Siantan runs a very pretty strait which although obstructed by many islets and shoals at its eastern end, has deep water in the west where Terempa Bay is situated. Not only in the latter itself can a vessel lie in deep water sheltered from all winds, but beyond the point forming its eastern shore is another bay where a ship can anchor in 10-15 fathoms near the beach, entirely land-locked. Better harbours on a small scale could not be wished for and wood and water are close at hand.\n\nThe Dato of Terempa was in an advanced state of consumption and in spite of possessing a new and rather showy house lived in a second more modest dwelling. He showed us specimens of black iron ore of which large quantities were said to occur in the hill behind the village.\n\nWe could get various supplies here, thanks to the presence of the Chinese; extremely good coconuts* were plentiful and water was at hand in a large pool on the beach. The only practicable shooting ground near at hand was mostly covered with small scrubby jungle in which we shot squirrels and a number of fairly common birds and trapped plenty of rats. I met with\n\n*This group of islands would appear to be a convenient place for obtaining seed nuts to form a coco-palm plantation. The Malays always maintain, and apparently with some show of reason, that island nuts are far superior to those of the mainland. Some of the Anambas nuts are very good, in fact, almost equal those of the Nicobars: though small, they are extremely sweet and the deposit of flesh is very thick.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nbees in this place and was put out of action for a day or two in consequence, for while chopping at a liana that crossed the path I disturbed a swarm that were clinging to it a little to one side. They were about me in an instant and though by retreating to the sea at an unaccustomed pace I shook off the majority, nevertheless those that had secured a hold made things sufficiently painful and my right hand and arm were so swollen that for a time I could do nothing with them.\n\nThe canoes of these islands were very similar to those of the Tamelans; they differed principally in having a much higher stem and stern and were shallower, lighter and narrower, with much less beam forward than aft, and they were propelled with a double-bladed paddle. The sampan used by the Chinese was of a very bulky model with an elongated and upward pointing prow; it sailed under a battened dipping-lug.\n\nHaving been told by a son of the Sultan of Linga who was staying in the village, of a large waterfall on the east side of Siantan we set out at sunrise one morning to visit it in the whale-boat. The wind was dead ahead and we had to pull all the way\u2014about eight miles\u2014but the result was well worth the labour. The way lay right up the channel between Siantan and Mata, then a short distance down the east coast and finally an approach by a passage through mangroves that enabled us to bring the boat to the very foot of the falls themselves. Bordered by jungle these fell in a series of cascades down a bare strip of rock about 400 feet high. There were twelve or thirteen falls in all and their chief charm lay in their variety\u2014broad ribbons of foamy water slithering over smooth faces of rock, long threads dropping uninterruptedly from a height, and series of little cascades tumbling down flights of stone steps, while here and there in between were delightful cool-looking pools, seeming so inviting after our hot row that we felt compelled to have a swim, following the example of the fish that had somehow found their way there.\n\nThe raja had agreed to accompany us but was late in setting out, though he arrived before we left and we both started together to sail back, as this time the wind was fair. We were not long in company however, for the other boat\u2014curiously, built in Singapore in the same yard as our own\u2014a little larger\nand with more sail soon left us behind and we reached home badly beaten.\n\nThe days between August 24th and September 5th were passed in visiting the northern island but on the latter date we sailed round Siantan and the islands extending from its southeast extremity since the channel on the north was untraversable, drifting on a reef on the way in a calm but easily getting off by the use of a kedge anchor, and in the evening putting in at Telok Ayer Bini, a bay on the south coast partially protected by an island at the entrance.\n\nThe shores rose very steeply and were uncleared except in one or two places where the people of a house there had made gardens and planted hill rice. It was hard work climbing about the slopes which were rendered excessively slippery by rain that continued incessantly throughout our stay. A stream with two arms ran into the head of the bay and up one we rowed until stopped by a small cascade, while the other was merely an almost dry bed of granite boulders.\n\nThe wretched weather made specimens scarce and after three or four unprofitable days we sailed on our final visit to Terempa. Four more days were spent here working fresh ground and making fairly good collections of mammals and birds and then we left for Pulo Telaga to the westward.\n\nMobur.\n\nThe 24th of August was the first day of our stay at Mobur Island, about 5 miles to the northward of Siantan. Like all the Anambas it is hilly with a broken surface covered with forest, and on the south it is cut into by a narrow gulf with an islet at the entrance; a notable feature of the western group is the number of these inlets and narrow channels that occur. Good as the harbour was with depths of 12 or more fathoms we passed up the strait separating Mobur from the larger Mata and anchored in a big bay on the north side, landlocked for more than three quarters of its perimeter. Four or five miles seawards we could perceive the Tokong Belauer, a remarkable white rock bearing at a distance a most extraordinary resemblance to a modern battleship. We found coco palm and banana plantations on the island but very few inhabitants, for the people\nare mainly confined to Terempa and only isolated settlers occur elsewhere.\n\nOne afternoon we rowed to a little island in the bay called Langor. It was only about 100 feet high and consisted of sand and rocks covered with scrub and a few cocopalm trees. Everywhere the ground was strewn with pigeon's feathers and by waiting we found that large flocks of the orange-breasted pigeon (*Osmoteryx bicincta*) came off at sunset from surrounding islands and used this spot as a roosting place in company with smaller numbers of glossy starlings and nutmeg pigeons. The whirring noise made by the wings of the flocks as they flew round and round the island, disturbed by our shots, was very great and continued until we departed with bags stuffed with birds that appeared later in a most delicious stew.\n\n**Kelong, Manguan and Tobing.**\n\nWe next sailed round the north end of Mata and anchored between it and Pulo Kelong, a narrow island about 5 miles long in a N. and S. direction and less than a mile wide; the ground sloped upward to a ridge 600-700 feet high and everywhere the soil and jungle were very poor. Most of the channel dividing Kelong from Mata is filled with sand banks and coral, dry at low tide. Fishing-stakes had been set up here and there by the Malays but to us the place proved a good ground for the common shore birds of this region and we also collected a number of beautiful starfish while our crew hunted for trepang and chopped tridacnas out of the coral. Other animal life was scarce and we soon moved southward to Pulo Manguan, a small island shaped like a dumb-bell, flat and swampy in the centre; but doing no better there, anchored the schooner off Tobing, an islet near the eastern entrance of the Siantan channel, and from thence again visited the waterfall, and next day, previous to sailing for the south of Siantan, rowed to Terempa and back for our mails.\n\n**Telaga.**\n\nThe second stay at Terempa concluding on the 13th of September we made for Jimaja, the chief of the westerly Anambas; first however after a few hours sail stopping about mid-way, at a group of small islands of which Telaga is chief. This is a\nnarrow hog-backed island about 5 miles long N. and S. with a picturesque peak rising 1740 feet near its northern end. We spent a couple of days here and on the neighbouring island of Midai finding the forest fairly open except for patches of rattans and a prickly holly-like shrub. Only one village of three or four houses was seen. The coconuts seemed much troubled with squirrels and the people made use of an ingenious trap set on a long bamboo leading from the jungle to the palm trunks.\n\nJimaja.\n\nOn the 16th we made sail at daybreak and rounded the southern end of Telaga. The wind was ahead but we did most of the seventeen miles, which is the distance between that island and Jimaja, in one board and then working short tacks got close to the entrance of Kwala Maras Bay on the east coast by nightfall. After that the wind fell light and the tide carried us away to the northward so we let go the anchor in 10 fathoms about three-quarters of a mile from shore and next morning after a couple of hours beating got into the bay. A line of rocks extends above water from the north shore and beyond them on the other side is a coral reef: we found a good berth between the two, well protected from all but easterly winds.\n\nJimaja is the largest of the Anambas with an area of perhaps 30,000 acres. It is of an irregular Y-shape about 14 miles N. and S. and 9 miles wide. The contour is very uneven and there are many peaks between 700 feet and 1530 feet, the greatest elevation attained in Gunong Tujoh. The irregularity of the coast line has resulted in many bays, the largest being in the north and in the south-east, but Telok Kwala in the centre of the east coast, although smaller than these is the most important as having the greatest population and being the port of call of the steamer. Its shores rise steeply to heights of 1000 feet in places free from forest, but beyond the head where a river embouches is some flat swampy land overgrown with mangroves.\n\nThe kampong lies on the north shore and consists of thirty to forty houses, a small mosque, the Dato\u2019s house and the buildings of the opium-farmer\u2014shop, godowns, etc., surrounded by a stockade 8-10 feet high closely built of small saplings from whence ran a small jetty.\nThe Dato's was a well built house, the largest in the place, with a flag staff in front. We were given the rarely used chairs brought out, as always, from somewhere in the roof and seated on these awaited the Dato who was making himself presentable. He was a rather big man with an Irish countenance and wore a \"baju tangan kanching\" having a ridiculous resemblance to the obsolete night shirt, and a purple smoking cap whose large black tassel persisted in lying in his right eye. There were only a few people in the audience and after the Dato had stumbled through the Sultan's letter and the scholar of the party recorded our visit in the brown-paper-covered archives of Jimaja, conversation took a zoological turn and we were told also of two deep lakes with waterfalls that existed up in the hills of the interior, the description being such as to give one an idea of something impressive.\n\nWe collected first on the south side of the bay with no great result; the ground was very steep and difficult and the forest small having evidently been cleared at some former period. However, a new species of rat\u2014Mus flaviventer\u2014was obtained and we came across parrots (Paleornis longicauda) for the first time. Every day flocks crossed the bay and passed near the summit of some steep rocks where I several times lay hid in the vain hope that they might stop. It was interesting to note how the parrots' call as they flew by always drew a loud response from all the small birds roosting in the bushes.\n\nOn the other side of the bay we found a good path running for some distance through a former mangrove swamp now planted with coconuts, and afterwards up hill amongst most beautiful jungle. It crossed two small streams of perfectly clear water one running among granite boulders and the other, about a foot deep, in a smooth sandy bed. Toward midday nothing was more pleasant after five or six hours' tramping in the forest than to find a round stone for pillow and recline full-length in the flowing water of the latter until thoroughly refreshed by its coolness. But beside providing pleasure of this sort we also obtained good specimens along its banks.\n\nOur third collecting ground was along the river falling into the head of the bay. At first this was bordered by broad growths of tall mangrove, but after a mile or so where the current\nbegan to make itself felt these ceased and the vegetation became more varied with interminglings of nipahs, palms, and fruits trees. Onward from here the stream\u2014the Sungei Maras\u2014runs up the centre of a winding valley with a narrow strip of flat land at the bottom and steeply rising sides. At the head of navigation\u2014and in fact when the tide was low we had to wade with our dinghy for some distance, though all the way the stream was broad enough to use oars\u2014was a village of eight or ten houses and a mosque, one or two of the former being of large size and well built of panels of carved wood, though now old.\n\nIn the valley we got specimens of the parrots at last as they fed in the fruit trees bordering the river, and also a lovely little two-toed kingfisher (Ceyx rufidorsa) with coral red beak and feet, yellow breast and brick red head and back that were tinged with a beautiful glossy lilac: the best of the bag however were specimens of a big squirrel (Ratufa anambae sp. nov.) black above with tawny yellow cheeks and underparts. It weighs about 3\u00bd lbs with a total length of 33 inches of which head and body are 15 inches: thus, contrary to the general rule, it is an insular race characterised by increase of size. In these China Sea islands it is found that when a species of mammal occurs in a solitary island, however small that may be in area, it is confined to that island alone, but when a species is present on an island of a group it will generally be obtained throughout the group. In the case, however, of the Ratufa of Jimaja this is not so; it was neither reported nor did we find it ourselves on any other of the Anambas.\n\nOn the 25th we set out early in the morning with the intention of seeing what truth there was in the report given us of the \"telaga\" in the centre of the island. The first stage was to the village up river\u2014Kampong Ayer Maras\u2014where the Penghulu provided us with a guide. While waiting for the latter we inspected a small waterfall about 20 feet high at the back of the village. It was not much to look at however as there was very little water in it at the time. We were then told that there were two series of lakes, so voted for the larger set and when the guide arrived started him off accordingly.\n\nThe path traversed sago swamps for the greater part of the way and was very muddy; then passed through a small kampong surrounded by fruit trees and soon after that through a stream.\nwhere a sago-making apparatus was erected, next came thickets of dense scrub followed by another sago plant where a number of men were at work. Now the track degenerated into a muddy ditch knee deep for the most part and after crossing several brooks we came to the bank of a small river with a clean sandy bed. When we had waded upward for some distance the bed became rocky and we then soon reached the \"lakes.\" These were disappointing being merely large rocky basins in the river bed about 60 feet long and 30 feet wide and, as we found by diving, 17 or 18 feet deep. They were connected by a fall and there was a second above the upper pool both some 30 or 40 feet high. The water was perfectly clear and the whole very pretty, rock and water being shaded and hedged in by dense jungle, nevertheless the actual state of affairs was not quite the phenomenon it had been painted by our informants.\n\nWe found the steamer in the bay when we got back and her serang came off with a message from the commander that we had stolen his anchorage! As however we had been there some time and the other was still under steam we returned word that we felt no inclination to move; thereupon the steamer's master obstinately took up a berth a few yard off until he swung with the tide when, our main-boom end doing considerable damage to his bridge dodger, he was persuaded to seek a more convenient anchorage.\n\nBoth in the Tamelans and in Siantan we had made efforts to get one of the canoes of the place without avail, people did not want to sell or would not be ready in time. Here as a last chance one of the built up kind was to be had for $40, though graceful dugouts on exactly the same lines were just half that while rough models could be purchased for as little as $3. One canoe, a good example of the type\u2014was brought alongside with the sail lightly rolled up and bound round and round with every conceivable cord; undoing this tangle of course showed the cotton to be mildewed and full of holes and the chagrined vendor was sent off for another. There was further trouble in concluding the purchase as the islanders would not accept either Dutch coin or Singapore notes and we had run completely out of Straits money. Happily a couple of Tringanu men visiting the island in a small prau were willing to change our notes on condition that\nwe invested in sarongs from their trade-stock. Having with\nthe assistance of these men\u2014who contrasted greatly with the\nislanders in many ways\u2014brought the canoe business to an end\nwe left Jimaja on September 28th and sailing round the south\nof the island reached Singapore on October 8th via Tiuman\nwhere we spent a few days.\n\nThe principal result of our visit to the Anambas lay in the\nfirst record of the animals and birds found in them, an outcome\nof our investigations being also the description of many new\ninsular species. So far as is represented by the collections the\nmammal fauna of these and of the other islands visited consists\nof local forms of the widely distributed and characteristic\nMalayan types. Each island and group of islands has its re-\npresentative of the common genera and species; but in scarcely\nan instance is an insular race identical with that occurring on\nanother island, unless of the same group, or on the mainland.\n\nMammals of the Anambas.\n\nMacacus pumilus.\nNyctecebus tardigradis.\nEmballonura anambensis, sp. nov.\nRhinolophus minutus, sp. nov.\nR. rouxii?\nTupaia chrysomella, sp. nov.\nParadoxurus, sp.

Shelford, M.A., F.L.S.,\n(Curator of the Sarawak Museum).\n\nPart I.\n(Danainae to Amathusiinae).\n\nOnly three lists of the butterflies of Borneo that can pretend to any completeness have been published hitherto. One by Messrs. Distant and Pryer appeared in the \"Annals and Magazine of Natural History\" 1887; another by Messrs. Pryer and Cator in the \"British North Borneo Herald\" of 1894\u2014a list remarkable for the number of nomina nuda contained in it, and a third by Mr. E. Bartlett in the \"Sarawak Gazette\" of 1896, reprinted in the \"Zoological Note-Book of Sarawak\" by the same author. All three lists are now out of date and many new species have been described even since the compilation of the last one; for example Mr. Bartlett records only 139 Lycaenidae, whereas the number of species of this family now known from Borneo just exceeds 300. Consequently I feel justified in adding to the literature on Bornean Lepidoptera, especially as I do not expect that many more discoveries of new species will be made in the future in an island that has been so well explored faunistically as Borneo; in short, this list has some claim to completeness and finality.\n\nA few new species are described for the first time, and as considerable trouble has been taken in consulting all available literature on Oriental butterflies and as most of the specimens have been referred to Dr. A. G. Butler and Mr. F. A. Heron, of the British Museum, and by these well-known authorities de-\nclared to be in every probability undescribed, I trust that my new species are really \"good species.\"\n\nThe question of nomenclature has been rather a difficult one; the systematist has to steer between the Scylla of \"lumping\" and the Charybdis of \"splitting,\" for to regard all geographical varieties (topomorphs) of a wide-spread species as identical is unscientific, to regard each variety, on the other hand, as a separate species is almost equally unscientific and, further, tends to obscure the problems of geographical distribution. There is a third alternative and that is, to adopt the cumbersome trinomial system, distinguishing well-marked topomorphs of a wide-spread species as sub-species, giving them separate names* and noting the distribution of the species as a whole. Such is the method adopted in this list; a species is recorded, if the typical form occurs in Borneo that fact is noted and the distribution of the typical form and the sub-species (component parts of a species) occurring outside Borneo are also noted; if the typical form does not occur in Borneo, the name of the sub-species that does occur follows the name of the species and the distribution of the species as a whole is recorded.\n\nUnfortunately some of the families of butterflies have not been studied so thoroughly as others, whilst some families again have been studied from a different point of view to others: for example, Messrs. Elwes and Edwards in their \"Revision of the Oriental Hesperidae\" (Trans. Zool. Soc Vol. XIV part IV, 1897), do not allow a single sub-species, whereas Hon. W. Rothschild and Dr. K. Jordan in their memoirs on the Papilioninae and on the Nymphaline genera, *Eulepis*, *Charaxes*, etc., regard every topomorph of a wide-spread species as a sub-species and this to my mind appears to be the more scientific method. Much work along these lines still remains to be done, but it can be done only by one who has frequent access to extensive collections and well-stocked libraries, therefore though this list lays claim to some completeness so far as an enumeration of the forms of butterflies\n\n* For an able exposition and defence of the trinomial system of nomenclature see Novitates Zoologicae Vol. IX. Supplement, 1903, pp. xxvi et seq.\noccurring in Borneo goes, it does not claim in every instance to discuss the relationships between these Bornean forms and close allies inhabiting other areas.\n\nAt the end of this list will be given a table showing at a glance the geographical distribution of the various species. A few field notes are put in square brackets after the records of distribution of the respective species.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. F. Moore and to Herr H. Fr\u00fchstorfer for their kind help; the late Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville was a most valued correspondent whose sound advice and generous aid I sadly miss now.\n\n**LEPIDOPTERA RHOPALOCERA.**\n\n**Fam.

Moore, Lepidoptera Indica, p. 60). Whilst in D. crowleyi only the patch on the sub-median vein is so traversed, the patch on the internal vein is almost obsolete, whilst that on the lower median vein is large and spatulate as in Parantica; in short D. crowleyi is not a true Caduga at all.\n\n16.

Fruhstorfer divides the Trongas into two groups:\n\n1. Hindwing with a prominent row of submarginal dots.\n2. Hindwing with a double series of very large clear white spots.\n\nIn the former group he places E. bremeri, as a subspecies of E. Crameri, in the latter he places E. pryeri, yet all the specimens of E. bremeri that I have seen should be placed in group 2. In any case the species is rather a doubtful one.

The form, markings, and colouration of the imagines of these seasonal varieties are dependent on the degrees of damp or dryness to which the young stages (egg, larva and perhaps pupa, are subjected, hence a spell of wet weather in the fine monsoon\u2014an event by no means unusual\u2014would produce a brood of wet-season forms and conversely a spell of fine weather in the wet-season a brood of dry-season forms. M. ismene in its dry-season phase is remarkably leaf-like, and the insect has the habit of settling amongst fallen leaves and leaning, with both wings closed, over to one side, so that its phyllomorphic appearance is very much increased].\n\n65.

In 1869 Dr. Wallace described (Trans. Ent. Soc. London p. 324,) a female *Elymnias* from Borneo as *E. borneensis*. This species belongs to Moore\u2019s sub-genus *Mimadelius* and is a Pierine mimic. In 1887 Staudinger figured (Exot. Schmett. pl. 86) what he supposed to be the male of this species, but Fruhstorfer in 1899 (Berl. Ent. Zeitschr. Bd. xliv p. 57) rightly points out that this is the figure of a female, however he then states that the male of *E. borneensis*, Wall. is \u201cganz blau und geh\u00f6rt mit *Mehida*\u2018 Hew. und *Sumatrana*, Wall. zusammen in eine andere\nGruppe und zwar in das sub-genus *Bruasa*, Moore.\" This is quite wrong, for Grose-Smith in 1892 (l. c.) described both sexes of an *Elymnias* of the sub-genus *Bruasa* from Borneo under the name of *Elymnias borneensis*; the male is blue above and is a mimic of the Euplocine butterfly *Trepsichrois claudius*, the female resembles the females of other species of the *Bruasa* section and is not a Pierine mimic as is the female of Wallace's species. Grose-Smith's name *borneensis* being then already occupied by Wallace's species, I venture to propose the new name *trepsichroides*. To make \"confusion worse confounded\" Grose-Smith described as the female of his *E. borneenis*, the female of another species of *Elymnias* of the section *Bruasa*\u2014*E. konga*\u2014the male of which was described by him in 1899. (A.M.N.H. p. 317.) An undoubted female of *E. penanga trepsichroides* (*E. borneensis* Grose-Smith) from N. Borneo is in the Sarawak Museum collection and is now described for the first time:\u2014Very like the female of *E. penanga*, Westwood, but the sub-apical white fascia on the upper-side of the fore-wings narrower and more outwardly oblique, the costa of the fore-wing striated with white. Underside as in the male but less rufous and darker, the sub-costal primrose-coloured spot, larger than in the male. Expanse 65 mm. Hab. N.

Distant has confused the female of godferyi with the females of\nWallace's species and so has wrongly recorded this species also from Borneo; as pointed out by Fruhstorfer *E. esacoides*, de N., described from a male only, is probably the male of *E. godferyi*, Dist. *E. andersoni*, Moore., I regard as a sub-species of *E. esaca*.

Borneo which differs somewhat from the type female from Kina Balu; I have only seen specimens from Mt. Matang near Kuching and these do not appear to differ in any way from the published description of the Kina Balu form: Herr Fruhstorfer's S. Borneo specimen is evidently from the low-country.\n\nThe position of this genus is very doubtful. I follow Fruhstorfer in placing it amongst the *Amathusiinae*; de Nic\u00e9ville suggested that it should come at the end of the *Satyrinae*, whilst Felder and Schatz-R\u00f6ber placed it amongst the *Nymphalinae*, probably its correct position.\nThe Sakais of Batang Padang, Perak.\n\nBy G. B. Cerruti.\n\nThe word Sakai is the Malay name for the aborigines who inhabit the forest on the high slopes of the lower half of the main ridge and some subsidiary ridges of mountains of the Malay Peninsula. As the Malays were the first to come into intercourse with these aborigines, the influence of the Malay, as well as the fear of them, is strong upon them. Malay history in Perak reaches with certainty no farther back than the 16th century, and Malays have no written records relating to the Sakais, whom they treated as slaves and less than human beings.\n\nThe Sakais themselves have neither written records nor signs to represent language, whatever information regarding their origin is supplied by them rests solely in tradition.\n\nThe narrative of events, which is extracted from them with difficulty, very seldom passes beyond the time of a grandfather, and may be regarded as inexact if not incoherent.\n\nWe shall, therefore, have to look for knowledge of their origin to the results of a morphological study of the race.\n\nPhysical Characters.\n\nThe average height of the male Sakai may be taken approximately at 5 ft. 3 in; and that of the female at 4 ft. 11 in; These figures are for the present only tentative. The colour various from a light to a chocolate-brown, the eyes are slightly almond shaped, the nose is flat, the forehead straight, the lips full and separate, but not negro like, the teeth regular and well-formed though blackened by sireh, the hair copious, black, somewhat wavy, occasionally crisp, but never woolly. The senses are unusually keen and well developed. In his native jungle he sees better, hears better, and apparently uses his sense of smell better than other races. His touch is delicate and sensitive, as is that of most savage races, and his sense of\ntaste is his criterion to judge of the good or ill effects of many objects.\n\nThe body and limbs are generally speaking well formed. Cripples and deformed children are extremely rare amongst the Sakais, nor are abnormalities of anatomical structure frequent amongst them.\n\nMental and Moral Characters.\n\nA desire for what may be called independence, but what in reality is a dislike of restraint is remarkable in this race. Work for a Sakai must be voluntary; the moment that it becomes compulsory it becomes distasteful.\n\nNot less notable is his distrust of strangers. The approach of a white man will often scatter a whole habitation of Sakais; and even the presence of natives of other races, such as Malays, Tamils or Chinese, is a frequent cause of their speedy removal from an accustomed haunt. Once the Sakai confidence is secured, he is like a child, and must be treated as such. All obligations entered into with him must be scrupulously observed, for, like the natural child, he is not prone to deceit or falsehood. He is also possessed of the child's simple idea of morality, as expressed in his words and acts. Early marriage being the custom, the immorality of civilized races, with its literature and influence on social relations, is unknown.\n\nDress.\n\nBark beaten finely and elongated until it resembles coarse ramie fibre, is the material from which the primitive clothing is made. Both sexes fasten strings of this bark, about six inches or more wide, around the waist, by tying them in back and in front. A thin fillet of the same stuff, dyed and coloured in a simple pattern, is used to tie the hair, which is generally filled by the women with combs, made of bamboo and ornamented in various styles.\n\nFlowers are universally worn by the women in the hair, around their necks as necklaces, and occasionally in their waistbelts of odorous grass. In both sexes the nasal septum is perforated for the insertion of straight pieces of bamboo, and the ear only by the women for the insertion of some bamboo with\nSAKAIS.\n\nsome odorous grass, of shell, and of animal teeth, to serve as ornaments.\n\nOrnaments.\n\nThe use of necklaces belongs to attire. Ornamentation of the body is effected by painting the skin in different colours, mostly red, yellow and black, by dyes obtained from plants, gutta and lime. Two lines, one drawn from the vertex of the head over tip of nose to chin, and the other from ear to ear, bisecting the first, divide the face into four areas, the painting of two of which on one side must correspond to the painting of the two others of the opposite side.\n\nThe chest and body are generally divided also by a vertical line cleaving the trunk in two halves, right and left, upon which similar patterns are painted.\n\nThe object of this adornment by painting is not merely decoration, it is what formerly would have been called dedicated to superstitious uses. The painting of the face and body is, in fact, a species of charm and is supposed to act as amulets and talismans are presumed to act, by warding off dangers, driving afar evil spirits, and filling the wearers with unusual courage.\n\nReligious Sentiment.\n\nIt is a peculiarity of the Sakai that, like many of his characteristics, his religious belief is extremely simple. The idea of a Creator, of an all-powerful, all-just and all-merciful Ruler, is absent from his scanty mythology. The origin of the world and the life of mankind on the earth present no problems to him. He believes simply in good and evil spirits. The good spirits are to him vague, indefinite beings, who manifest themselves rarely fatally, and about whom, therefore, he knows and believes little. The evil spirits, on the contrary, are feared, because they are considered to dwell in dangerous ravines, in abandoned kampongs, in caverns, and in places regarded according to popular Sakai report as uncanny, whence they issue to infect the Sakais with famine and disease. They also are believed to make themselves felt in thunder, in lightning, and most particularly of all in wind. The early morning breeze\nwhich blows on the tropical hills after 2 a.m. is for the Sakai the work of bad spirits. It is the hour when he feels the fall of temperature most, and it is for him a fatal hour. Accordingly, all true Sakais are awake at this time to chat and smoke and wait until the biting blast passes away. Tattooing is little known amongst them; and though they have a certain knowledge of the ways of tigers and snakes, these are neither worshipped nor considered to be directly concerned with evil spirits.\n\nSOCIAL RELATIONS.\n\nThe most important circumstance of a man's, and of woman's life, marriage, does not loom large in the Sakai's mind. For him it is neither a religious ceremony nor a civil contract, it is merely a mode of sexual union founded upon mutual sympathy. Rites in connection with it have so far not been proved to be practised. There is neither capture, nor purchase, nor selection. The elders, moreover, do not appear to interfere in the choice of their sons and daughters.\n\nIt is probable that it is owing to this fact that these aborigines are gradually decreasing in numbers, even though consanguinity in matrimonial relationship is forbidden, about the only prohibition of any kind that the Sakais know, and to which they submit.\n\nPolygamy exists, but it is rare. Divorce also exists, and is common. The marriage tie, being as loose as is described, is unable to consolidate a union; the slightest incompatibility of temper, temporary sterility of the wife, lasting about three durian seasons, or an attack of dangerous disease, is a sufficient cause for a divorce, which is accomplished without resentment or apparent jealousy on either side. Deformed persons which are very rare amongst the Sakais, or those attacked by dangerous disease, must make a vow of celibacy. The women give birth to their children with only old women attendants, but in a place prepared by the husband. The child is not allowed to touch the earth, either from a superstition that the child would be injured by contact with the earth, or that the child would soil the ground, but is laid upon a couch of dry leaves, which cover a rudely made clay embankment. Directly after birth only old women and young children who are not able and\nstrong enough to enter the jungle to find their daily food are permitted to approach the child. All others are excluded for a certain period, as there is a certain superstition among them that able bodied persons approaching a newly born baby will contract its smell and take it to the jungle with them when out looking for food. The evil spirits, it is said, are always on the look-out for persons with this smell, and will follow them on their return to their huts to the birth place of the child. At the end of that time the child receives what may be called a ceremonial purification of water, and is presented to him at the village.\n\nHABITS.\n\nThe Sakais are essentially nomadic, and clear only very limited areas in the hill forests for cultivation; of rice culture they know little, for corn or maize and the Sikoi, sweet potatoes, and tapioca, are their principal crops. The most primitive of the Sakais still subsist by the chase, using the Sumpitan, or blow-gun, and poisoned darts to kill wild animals and birds. As is well-known, the darts are poisoned by being dipped in a gummy or glutinous extract of Ipoh which hardens on the tips, and of another and more dangerous poison extracted from the roots of a kind of creeper named by the Sakais Legop.\n\nThe Sakai dies as he lives, surrounded by powers of nature which he understands not. If a disease be regarded as contagious, a noise is made on rude drums made of big bamboo to drive away the evil spirits. It is remarkable that there are not musical instruments to express grief; but in expression of joy a flute played through the nose, and a kind of mandoline made also of bamboo, are performed upon particularly by women. After death comes burial in a deep grave, the body generally standing erect in the grave about 4 feet deep or in a sitting posture with tobacco, betel-nut, potatoes, fruits and also with his blow-pipe and poisoned darts by his side. The grave is closed by felling some jungle surrounding it and for about a week they bring the usual food, if a female also some flowers, and afterwards abandon the neighbourhood; for a dead person frequently drives the timid Sakais miles away from promising slopes on which they were beginning to grow their necessary food.\nOn Some Hymenoptera From the Raffles Museum, Singapore.\n\nBY P.

Straits Branch\nShort Notes.\n\nOn the Flowering of Barringtonia racemosa.\n\nThe Barringtonias are trees of moderate size, belonging to the order *Myrtaceae* and usually to be met with along tidal rivers, or more rarely in the hill woods. The flowers are produced in long hanging racemes, or in some species in short erect spikes. In *B. racemosa* the pendulous spikes are about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long and bear about 30 flowers. They are sessile with a short $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch ovary with 2 or 3 rounded green sepals and four lanculate white petals, an inch long. The stamens are innumerable, with slender filaments an inch long and minute yellow anthers, the style is nearly as long slender with a minute capitate stigma and all deep crimson.\n\nThe peculiarity of its flowering consists in the fact that it is nocturnal. The flowers open about 4 or 5 to 16 on each spike at a time, the buds commence to split about mid-day, and remain partially open till nightfall, fully expanding at about half-past seven or eight. At that time the petals are spread out widely, and the stamens radiate in all directions, so that the flowers have a brush-like appearance.\n\nBefore daylight the petals and stamens have fallen in a mass, leaving only the calyx and the stiffly projecting style.\n\nThey exhale a rather coarse scent somewhat resembling that of meadow-sweet, and from a tree with about 20 flowers open at once I could perceive the scent distinctly at 25 paces off. The honey, abundant at night, is contained in a nectary formed by the connate bases of the stamens. The flowers are visited by moths, I caught a common grey Noctuid, and a rather curious looking light red brown *noctua* with plicate wings.\n\nMoths were not very abundant at the flamers, when I observed them, but perhaps this was due to the strong moonlight.\nThe smaller brown moth plunged into the flower among the stamens so as to reach the honey.\n\nI have little doubt that a large tree of the genus *Careya* (apparently undescribed) in which the flowers were of similar shape but borne in an erect short spike, is fertilized in the same way, as though in full flower no open flowers were procurable during the daytime, but the whorls of stamens were found covering the ground in the mornings. In this lofty tree in the Botanic gardens jungle the stamens were white but the base of the filaments crimson.\n\nThe Myrtaceae as a rule seem to be day flowering plants. The Eugenias, our biggest genus, have usually white flowers often produced in large corymbs. *Eugenia lineata* and similar species are haunted, when in flower, by abundance of bees. *Apis dorsata* and *A. florea*, *Trigona collina* and other species and the pollen-eating flies (*Syrphidae*) and also by many butterflies. *E. Ridleyi* peculiar from the flowers being light apple green in colour is visited by flies (*Muscidae*).\n\n*Rhodamnia trivervia* with small white sweet scented flowers produced in great abundance and lasting but a day each, is visited by bees, *Apis*, and *Trigona*, and by the *Syrphidae*.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\n---\n\n**Fertilization of Webera Stellulata.**\n\n*Webera Stellulata* Hook. fil. is a small shrub 2 or 3 feet tall belonging to the order *Rubiaceae*. It has smooth dark green shining leaves elliptic cuspidate, and a short dense corymb of light green flowers. The buds are peculiar in shape, being fusiform and narrowed towards the tip, the joints of the petals instead of being pressed together at the top into a point as in the other species of *Webera* are turned out to one side bent at an angle pointing from left to right. They are green and covered with white hairs and at the base they are connate into a short tube, in the mouth of which are long white hairs. The stamens five in number have short green filaments and long linear anthers, which split and shed their pollen before the\nflower opens. The style is long and cylindrical and covered entirely with white hairs. When the fully developed bud is touched on the tip, the petals suddenly spring open and lie quite flat in the form of a star. At the same time the pollen lying loose in the bud is thrown upon the other flowers already open. The mechanism by which this sudden expansion of the flower takes place seems to be very simple. The upper part of the petals are twisted in bud, and on the side opposite to the direction in which the bent tip points a portion of the edge is incurved so as to be tightly held by the next petal to it. A light pressure, as of an insect, on the horizontal tips of the petals by bending them down causes the petals to separate and fly back suddenly, jerking the pollen out over the other flowers, or possibly on the insect visitor. On the top of the ovary is a brown sticky ring which may perhaps secrete honey but I cannot detect any in the tube. The flowers possessed a faint scent, and may be fertilised by insects, but considering the inconspicuousness of the green flowers, as compared with the sweet-scented white blossoms of the other Weberas and the fact that it is quite easy for the pollen of one flower to be thrown by the mere opening of the flower on to the stigma of the adjacent one, it is more than probable that the plant itself fertilises one flower by the pollen of another.\n\nWebera stellulata inhabits forests, usually in rather dry spots. I have found it in Singapore at Woodlands flowering in June, and Bukit Mandai, also in Johore, at Panchur; Selangor, Kuala Lumpur; Negri Sembilan, Gunong Angsi.\n\nThe Malays call it Kahwa hutan and Kuruseh putih and Pokoh Subiroh. It flowers from December to June.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\nHuman Images among the Orang Mantong.\n\nI have long suspected the existence of Berhala, or human images, among the \"wild tribes\" of the Rhio archipelago, but never actually met with any until the past summer (1903).\n\nWhen at Pulo Sanglar or Lake Durian, Rhio archipelago, in July. I found two wooden images representing women, in a cave near the sea shore, not far from Kampong Telok Lanun.\n\nEach image is about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet high. One of harder wood was much more carefully carved than the other. It had 3 wooden horns about 6 inches long projecting upwards from the head. These horns were serrated on one edge. This figure also had straight rudely carved arms of soft wood, much decayed.\n\nThe teeth were represented by pieces of broken shell. A blackish line extended diagonally across the chest, meeting a horizontal line extending across just above the position of the nipple. A blackish spot was over the position of the heart.\n\nThe other figure was very rudely carved of soft white wood and was without arms.\n\nThe figures were lying face downward on the floor of the cave and had evidently not been disturbed for months, as roots were growing over them and the wood was beginning to decay.\n\nPulo Sanglar is inhabited by Orang Mantong, and latterly many Chinese have settled there cultivating gambier.\n\nThe Batin of Telok Lamun called himself a Malay, but he was more than half Orang Laut.\n\nNo true Malays live on Sanglar, but they inhabit the neighbouring small islands. These Malays call all the Sanglar people Tambus, except of course the Chinamen, and say there is not a Mussulman. All the Sanglar people eat pig. They are certainly not true Tambus. They were very shy, and I had a lot of trouble inducing them to be photographed.\n\nNo information in regard to the use of the images could be obtained. Every one denied the existence of such things, not knowing I had already found them.\n\nThe images cannot be regarded as true berhala or idols. Most probably they are a sort of \"Sakkat buang\" for use in\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nsickness. Among the Orang Laut when a man is ill, a wooden figure of a bird, snake, fish or other animal is made, and the pawang or bomo exorcises the hantu or devil in the sick man and drives it into the figure, which is then carried out to sea and thrown overboard. Last year we picked up a wooden bird floating in Durian Strait.\n\nVery likely the human figures were used in the same way, being carried out into the jungle instead of out to sea. Like the Rumah hantu to be seen in the woods near Malay Kampongs. These images resemble the adu adu of Pulo Nias.\n\nDr. Abbott.\n\nThe Orang Laut of Singapore\n\nIn Journal 33, p. 247, Mr. Skeat and I published some notes on the Orang Laut of Singapore, a race very nearly extinct, and of which very little is known, I have since come across an account of them in Finlayson\u2019s Mission to Siam and Cochin China, in 1821. The author somewhat naturally mistook them for Malays and thus describes them. \u201cThe condition of the lower class of Malays in these parts is wretched beyond what we should conceive to be the lot of humanity in an intertropical climate, almost the whole of their life is spent upon the water in a wretched little canoe in which they can scarce stretch themselves for repose. A man and his wife and one or two children are usually to be found in these miserable sampans; for subsistence they depend on their success in fishing. Their tackling is so rude and scanty that they are often reduced to the most urgent want, when they have made a meal they lay basking in the sun or repose under the dense shade of the mangrove till hunger again calls them into action. They have scarce a rag of cloth to secure them from the scorching noonday sun or shelter them from the damp and noisome dews and exhalations of night. The women are not less dexterous than the men in managing their boats. Their only furniture consists of one or two cooking pots, an earthen jar and a mat made of the leaves of the Pandanus which serves to protect them from the rain. In the numerous bays inlets and creeks that surround Singapore an inconceivable number of families live in\nthis wretched manner who have never possessed a house nor any sort of abode on the land. They are constantly roving about from place to place in pursuit of fish. What they have succeeded in taking more than is required for their immediate use, they dispose of to the fixed inhabitants, taking rice, sago, betel and cloth in return. This description of Malays goes by the appellation of Orang Laut or men who live on the sea.\n\nA number of the people called Orang Laut were brought to us for inspection. They were superior in condition, in appearance more civilized than many whom we had seen in the bays and creeks remote from the haunts of men. A portrait was taken of one of them illustrative of the physiognomy and general appearance of the Malay race, six of these men were more minutely examined. Their average height was five feet three inches, average weight nine stone eight pounds, average circumference of the chest two feet ten inches, circumference of the clenched fist about eleven inches, average of facial angle $66\\frac{1}{2}$, average temperature under the tongue $100\\cdot02$.\"\n\nH.

The native of Borneo has no special reason to pay attention to the phenomena among which he lives, unless he is a farmer. He may, like the Punan, know the lie of the land for miles around, and be able to judge the slightest indications of the jungle, but that is hardly knowledge which leads to civilization. The farmer, on the other hand, has to study the course of the seasons, the nature of the soil and the variability of animals and plants.\n\nThere are certain special problems which have presented themselves to the uncultured farmer in Borneo, which would not cause the least difficulty to an European in a temperate climate. In the tropics as everywhere else, agriculture is performed with the yearly regularity which is so familiar that to us it seems in no way remarkable. Near the equator, of course, seasons have not as a rule the same striking character that they have in higher latitudes. In Borneo from October to April the wind is usually from the north-east, and brings rain, more to some districts than to others, while during the rest of the year the monsoon is reversed, but there is little else to distinguish one month's weather from another. It is almost impossible to tell the time of year from temperature or moisture, and quite impossible to do so with any accuracy.\n\nThe farmers have found, nevertheless, that certain seasons are more favourable than others to their operations. It is not so much the crop which requires to be sown and reaped at particular times, as the ground, whose preparation is difficult in\nwet weather. Rice will grow and ripen in a sufficiently warm, sunny climate provided there is enough water on the land, either from irrigation or continual showers.\n\nIn Borneo there is usually rain all round the year in magnificent quantity. It is not according to the rainiest season, but according to the driest that the farmer regulates his work. For the jungle is felled and left to dry before being burnt, and the success of the crop depends largely on the completeness of the clearing. The best crop will be generally obtained on land burnt off at the driest season.\n\nHow are these illiterate tribes to find out when a particular season has arrived? In England this is simple enough; we have almanacks galore, we have clocks which can tell us the length of time from sunrise to sunset. The native does not know how many days there are in a year, and would not take the trouble to keep count if he did. He may know how many moons there are, but like the Malays he would probably get about eleven days wrong every year, and eleven days is a large error of itself. In two or three years the crops would be planted far too early. Unfortunately, too, the length of the day varies very little in the tropics, and the native has no means of observing that variation. He is therefore obliged to have recourse to the stars or the sun to tell the time of year.\n\nThe Dayaks and many of the less important tribes look to the stars to guide them. Every day, as they know, these bodies rise a little earlier, and some wise man is appointed to go out before dawn to watch for the Pleiades. Dayaks use the Malay expressions \"bintang tiga\" for Orion's belt, and \"bintang banyak\" or Apai andau (the father of the day) for the Pleiades. When the \"seven stars\" rise while it is yet dark, it is time to begin.\n\nTwo of the house are sent into the jungle to find omens, while the others wait. In two days perhaps, or a fortnight, or at most a month, the favourable indications will appear, and then an end is made both of science and superstition and the Dayaks set to work on the forest. If they are so late that Orion's belt rises before daybreak, they must make every effort to regain lost time or the crop will be poor. What kind of land they will choose depends on circumstances: in any case it will have lain two or three years fallow and will be thickly covered with vegetation.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe virgin forest, though less easy to fell, has this advantage over previously cleared ground, that no grass is growing on the land and much trouble in weeding is avoided. But the men do the felling, the women most of the weeding, and whether a choice is made of forest or scrub will depend largely on the courtesy and consideration shown by the men for their wives and daughters. If the forest is chosen, the men, sometimes helped by their womenfolk, cut down the undergrowth and small trees with their parangs, and then begin to attack the great trunks from slight platforms well above the ground, which enable them to avoid buttresses and roots. The felling is usually accomplished in this manner. The ground being as a rule the sloping side of a hill, each tree is cut through from one side nearly to the core, and on the opposite side an equal distance a little lower down the trunk. The lower cut is made on the side facing downhill. By dint of much labour, in which the various members of a village generally come to help their comrades, a whole hillside of trees is cut through till a slight blow will hurl them to the ground. Two heavy trunks at the summit are then felled, and made to fall on the neighbouring trees. These fall in their turn, and carry with them those below, till with a loud roar and a mighty rush of wind a V-shaped space is cleared on the slope below. Like a pack of cards the forest monsters are laid low, to the intense excitement and delight of the howling spectators.\n\nThen again the Dayaks await the permission of the stars for the next operation. Only when the Pleiades are at the zenith before dawn do they think it advisable to burn and sow. By this time, unless the weather has been wet, an unlikely circumstance at the season of year, the boughs are dry as matchwood and the leaves are dead, though still on the twigs. Some hot day, towards noon, when a breeze is blowing, they take down special charms to secure wind, and also endeavour to attract the \u00c6olian spirits by keeping up a loud whirr. The mass of dead wood is then set on fire. The flames rise to the skies and fill the country with smoke, while the added heat of the fire is almost insupportable. Insects with singed wings buzz around, and the hawks dive into the smoke to find their prey. The spectacle is grand indeed. Sometimes wet weather keeps\nthe wood damp until the leaves fall from the twigs, and then\nthe land is often left untilled, for it is nearly useless. When\nthe fire has passed over the fallen timber, deep layer of ashes\nand charred trunks is all that is left. The partially burnt wood\nis heaped round a stump and again ignited, till little save ashes,\noccasional stumps, and islands of green trees left to preserve\nvaluable fruit, are to be seen in the clearing. The rice is then\ndropped by the women, a few grains at a time, into holes made\nby the men with pointed sticks; perhaps cucumber, maize and\nother sundry plants are sown round stumps or where the ash\nis especially thick; and the crop is left to the weeding of the\npeople and the fertility of a warm, moist climate and virgin\nsoil.\n\nThe Kenyahs and Kayans judge the seasons by the sun,\nand the method they adopt displays a wonderful knowledge of\nthe precautions necessary to accuracy. The Kenyahs measure\nthe shadow cast at midday with an instrument the Greeks would\nhave called a gnomon. It is a pole set up near the village,\nguarded by a fence to keep away mischievous children and ani-\nmals. In height it is more than a fathom by the span of the\nthumb and first finger. A piece of string weighted at each end\nand thrown over the top shows when it is perfectly upright.\nThe length of the shadow is measured by a stick called \"asu\ndo\" which is marked with notches gradually approaching one\nanother more closely as they get further from the pole.\n\nThe interval between successive notches represents the\nchange in the length of the shadow in three days. Midday is\nknown to be the time when the shadow cast by the sun is at its\nshortest, and the Kenyahs are also aware of the fact that the\ndirection of the shadow at noon, though sometimes to the north\nsometimes to the south, is always in the same straight line. The\nKayan method, which differs more in practice than in theory\nfrom the Kenyah, is to let in a beam of light through a hole in\nthe roof and measure the distance from the point immediately\nbeneath the hole to the place where the light reaches the floor.\nTheir measure is a plank, made level so that round discs do not\nroll on it, and fixed in position and direction by chocks placed\nat the side. This shows that they know the sun to be always\ndue north or due south at noon.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nI can only suggest one reason why these people though they have got so far, have not invented a sun-dial. That is this. In the tropics there are many days near each equinox on which no sun-dial would be of use. When the sun in its yearly course passes from the north of the zenith to the south, its shadow is due west in the morning hours, due east in the afternoon. Any time-piece depending on the direction of the shadow must therefore fail. The difficulty might indeed be obviated, but no sundial could be devised which would in the tropics tell the time in every month of the year.\n\nThis then is their instrument, in which no point essential to accuracy has been neglected. The measuring stick has been notched in accordance with the experience of previous years, and when the shadow, after lengthening during May and June, begins again to grow less, the house assembles and by mutual consent they decide when to plant. The best time for planting has not arrived until the noonday shadow is the length of the forearm from the tip of the fingers to the inside of the elbow. When the shadow is less than the length of the hand, sowing is not likely to prove very productive. The measuring stick is left in charge of some old and presumably wise man, less capable than his fellows of hard work, who sees to it that the shadow is not measured obliquely and reports the favourable moment. This man is excused from farming and is supplied with necessaries in return for his services. In good years he naturally is very well treated.\n\nIt would be pleasant to stop here, and say that otherwise the Kenyahs care nothing about the heavenly bodies. But having given the bright side of the picture and shown how they have acquired some accurate knowledge, the result of long and genuine experience, it is only fair to state that they lay almost equal importance on the meaningless mummeries with which these mysterious measurements are accompanied. Such important operations could hardly fail to be overlaid with superstition.\nNotes of Visits to Puket, Ghirbee and Trang.\n\nBy C. W. KYNNERSLEY.\n\nLeft Penang at 5 p.m. on Friday, 27th February, 1903, in s.s. Avaggee, (owned by KOE GUAN,) which trades between Penang and Rangoon calling at the Siamese ports en route.\n\nArrived at Puk\u00e9t at 2.30 p.m. on 28th. Since I was there two years ago quarantine sheds have been put up opposite the light-house and there is said to be a good water supply there.\n\nThe harbour continues to silt up and undoubtedly the mining works have made matters worse. Where I landed last time is now a high mud flat which I hear is going to be mined.\n\nThe site of the present town is all tin land. The principal road to the landing place has been diverted to allow a mine to be opened. Borings are being taken by the Government Offices and if tin is found the site will be sold and new Offices built elsewhere. Everything is sacrificed to the mines. At the present price ($97) it pays well to work mines which were given up at my last visit when tin was about $60. SIM BEE has been very busy laying out new roads. The road which the late Commissioner was opening up has of course been abandoned as a bad one. A new road (60 feet) has been laid out by the edge of a new mine parallel to the principal shop street, the land on either side which is low being filled in with the overburden from the mine. Shop houses will be built and a new market erected. I noticed several improvements since my last visit. Then the place swarmed with pigs. These have been banished outside the town. On the outskirts of the town among the brushwood I noticed the mounds of new Chinese graves. SIM BEE said he was going to stop indiscriminate burying and have a Chinese Cemetery. The last Commissioner said the same. The last\nCommissioner told me he had put a stop to clearing hill sides for hill padi. SIM BEE said he had stopped it. Jungle fires are still frequent and there is no timber to speak of left near Tongkah. SIM BEE talks of a Forest Department under an Officer from Bangkok. A beginning has been made to put the main road to Naito (the other mining centre) into repair and a mile and a half has been done. A new road is also being made in the direction of Pa Prak, the old telegraph trace made by the former Commissioner, with poles and wires still standing, being abandoned as bad. New poles have been ordered and the wire will shortly arrive. I was assured that the line would be in working order in a few months. The trace goes through Kesum, Pung\u00e1, Ghirbee and Trang to Na-kon when it joins the line from Kedah to Siam.\n\nCultivation does not seem to be encouraged and no one cares to plant so long as mining pays so much better. The mines absorb all the labour. Rice, fruit and provisions of all kinds are imported. It is a splendid place for coconuts but hardly any are planted. Fruit and vegetables come from Penang. I went to see the Judge sitting in Court. He is not overworked. There are about two cases a day. Only five people were present including a prosperous looking Chinese interpreter. We then went to the Court below which is presided over by the Ampur who takes all petty cases and preliminary enquiries. Most cases are compromised. There is said to be little crime or disorder. Everybody is hard at work making money at the mines. The Ampurs are poorly paid and it cannot be wondered at that they supplement their salaries.\n\nAfter lunch I started for the mining town at Naito. We were escorted by two Siamese armed Police mounted on little Siamese ponies which trotted behind the carriage. At the place where the good road ends and a bridge is to be built we got into a Java pony-trap. From this point the state of the road is too awful for words, big stones, ruts and holes. It is certainly the worst road I ever attempted to drive over but we got along somehow\u2014generally at a walk. When it was hilly we got out and walked. The jolting was frightful. Naito is about six miles off and we passed through open grass country with scrub on which buffaloes were grazing. The whole coun-\n\nJour, Straits Branch\ntry seems full of tin. Among the low jungle hills cuttings have been made and in the wet season the tin is washed down. Naito has a large Chinese mining population and consists of a long street. Hundreds of coolies were assembled and the Gambling Farm was densely packed. Only Chinese are allowed to gamble, not the Siamese. We looked in at the Ampur's Office and then walked on a mile or so along a sort of road in the direction of the highest hills (about 1,700 feet) through which there is a pass where there is a wonderful aqueduct on trestles across the valley constructed by Chinese for bringing water to the mines. We had no time to go there but I have seen a photograph of it. Returning to Naito we had some tea at a Chinese Toukeh's. I asked what he thought of the road. He seemed hopeful and said it would be all right next year. He added that it used to be worse but this I think is impossible. There is a great deal of traffic on it, a stream of mining coolies, a good many buffalo carts and some gharries such as are used in Province Wellesley. Naito is famous for its water melons which are sent to Penang. One of the duties of the Ampur, who is a sort of District Officer, is to report on mining applications and find out if the land is owned by anyone. They get low salaries, and are often corrupt.\n\nAfter saying goodbye I entered a small dug-out which was hauled by 8 Siamese over a mud flat (dry) into the river or creek, whence in a boat we went off to the Damrong Rat which Sim Bee kindly placed at my disposal. He came on board to see me off and at 8:30 we steamed out of the harbour. The nephew accompanied me and I felt quite at home once more on the Rat. I had been solemnly warned in writing on good authority that the boilers of the Rat were pronounced to be in a dangerous condition and I was warned not to go in her. I had however arranged to go in her and it was only an additional peril to a voyage in this rock-studded sea. I mentioned to Joo Keat that I had been told the boilers were rather old. He said the Engineer of the Ran Ruk had patched them up and there were to be new boilers next year. This was consoling. It was blowing fresh but was not very rough. As we dodged among some rocky islands I said \"I suppose the Captain knows the way?\" I was informed that there were two Captains. After\nthis I rested in peace. Passed a long island on the left of Pulau Panjang where there are said to be 300 or 400 Malays who plant mangostins, the soil being good, and a few Chinese who advance money to Malay fishermen. No signs of habitation were visible and it was said they were at the back of the island. Passed under some high limestone rocks with caves with rattans hanging down said to be used by edible birds-nest collectors. No sign of life till a little North of Ghirbee where there was a fringe of coconuts with a mountain somewhat like Kedah Peak inland (Khaw phanum.) There were masses of limestone hills as at Pung\u00e4 but not so high. There are two mouths to the Ghirbee river and we followed the one to the right, the usual mangrove creek, and after two or three bends came to a landing stage on the right bank about 1.30.\n\nThe Assistant Governor came off in a house boat and I was received on the jetty by the Governor whom I had met before at Trang. Officials and a Police guard were drawn up. This is the new town site. The Governor took us to a temporary house where we were served with tea and cigarettes. He said \"This is a poor house. I am making the new road you see and I hoped to move the town here but it will not be till next year.\" I said I should very much like to see it and we walked round preceded by Police with a man carrying an umbrella over me. The Siamese seem to have a craze for moving towns. It is interesting work no doubt and gives the Governor something to do but when these new roads\u2014a kind of circular road with two roads leading to the sea and a very steep one to a wharf on the river\u2014are completed the question is whether, except under compulsion, the people in the old town or village some miles further up the river will occupy the sites. The site is said to have been approved by Prince DAMRONG. I had not time to visit the present town so I cannot say if it is worth moving. As in all new Siamese roads trees are planted at intervals on either side of the road but the ansana stumps (*Pterocarpus endicus*) do not seem to grow as they do in the Straits probably owing to the prolonged drought. Other trees are doing well. The Governor is a pleasant genial man and a sportsman. He talks a certain amount of English. He said it was a very good country for sport. He had shot an elephant and another was shot a few days ago.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThere were also deer and rhinoceros and tigers. There is little cultivation in Ghirbee and no tin. The revenue is very small but no doubt it has undeveloped resources. The coal or rather lignite is of no value. He said that people were afraid to settle there till he came on account of dacoits. Two Siamese murdered a Chinaman and robbed his house and then killed an old woman to keep her mouth shut. They were caught and executed at the place. I had heard of an execution recently taking place and asked if that was the case. He informed me that the affair took place over two years ago and the men had just been executed. The law's delays were in this case protracted. I asked if it wasn't rather a long time to keep the men under sentence but he said: \"We had to get the order from Ban kok and then they appealed.\" I told Keat if they wanted a name for the new town they might call it Pi Nah (next year)* On our return we were regaled with long glasses of coconut water and cigars. At 2.30 we took leave as the tide was falling. We had intended taking a short cut through an inner channel inside Khaw Fu and Ma Fu but they said there was only a depth of 3 feet in places and many rocks, so we went out to sea and round Pulau Lantar. This took a long time and it got dark. We passed several rocks and islands and did not get to Telibon anchorage till 11.30 p.m. when I turned in on deck. The wind had blown from the West all day but at night there was a land wind. We found the Tongkah Police launch at anchor. She had been sent on ahead to inform the Governor of Trang of my visit.\n\nWednesday, 4th March.\u2014Got up about 7 a.m. and after tea landed at the Custom House\u2014a few Sam-sam huts\u2014fine beach for coconuts but only one growing. A Chinaman advances money to fishermen and bark collectors. Very low tide early, turned about 7.30 when we started. Anchored at 9.30 at firewood jetty up Trang river and waited for tide to rise\u2014breakfast. At 10.30 stuck on mud bank and waited $\\frac{1}{2}$ an hour till enough water. Got to Kant\u00e1n at 11.30. Pepper and fowls being put on junk for Penang. The Governor Phra Suthon on landing place, Police Guard, 3 carriages Scarlet (faded) livery. Drove\n\n*Spain is the land of Manana, in Siam it is always \"Pi nah.\"\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 42, 1904.\nto SIM BER's house and bathed. He mentioned Yong Setar the chief place in Pelian and I asked what 'Yong' was. He said it was the Siamese contraction of Tanjong. I think there is no doubt that Junk Ceylon is a corruption of Yong (Tanjong) Phalung or Salung. Phalung was the great mining place before Tongkah mines were worked at the end of the promontory or island which we call Junk Ceylon. I never quite believed in the 'Ujong Salang' derivation. There is no town at Kantan which is the seat of Government. The former town of Kuantani was demolished about 10 years ago. It is about 6 miles higher up the river. On the opposite side of the road facing the wharf at Kantan is a row of about half a dozen Chinese shops an this constitutes the town. The houses of the Officials are built along a country road and the Government Offices (still in course of construction) stand on a low hill above the river and road. After lunch we went on board the launch with the Governor up the river which winds about till we got to the landing place near the site of the abandoned town. We might have driven the whole way but carriages were sent on. Along the banks is a fringe of jungle with padi land beyond. The site of the old town appeared to be a good one, high ground with fine old ansana trees. Only a Wat and a few attap huts remain among fruit trees. We stopped at one place near to see 33 big cannons taken from Kedah when it was overrun by the Siamese. They are piled up among brushwood. The road is a good one. We drove from Kuantani. It is simply a red earth broad road and in dry weather dusty. There is hardly any wheel traffic but it is largely used by people walking from place to place. It would be excellent for bicycling. We crossed several streams on timber bridges, gium a hard wood being used for supports and planking. The village of Bong Rat was passed. Padi fields cultivated by Siamese extended on either side where the land was low. A drive of about 5 miles brought us to the town of Tap Tiang. Along the main street are brick shop houses and there is a considerable Chinese population. A great Market is held every three days. It has been held that morning and I was sorry to miss it for it must be an interesting sight. The Market which is farmed for $100 a month is held in a large square building. Long attap sheds open at the side extend\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nround the sides and there are two cross sheds. Produce from country is brought in on Market days and disposed of. Meat, fish, poultry, fruit and vegetables have divisions of the Market set apart for them. It is very largely attended. Chinese Societies have been suppressed and the former Kongsi house has been turned into the Ampur\u2019s Office. Along the road from Kant\u00e1n newly cut telegraph posts were lying and are to be set up shortly. The telegraph goes to Na-k\u00f3n. The wire from Kedah to Singgora goes through Na-k\u00f3n to Bangkok. The line is being laid from Kant\u00e1n to Ghirbee, Pung\u00e1, Kes\u00fan to Puk\u00e9t. The posts are of hard wood and cost $1.20 each where felled, being taken to the road by Government. They are said to be ready for putting up as far as Na-k\u00f3n and in the Eastern State adjoining Trang the Pan palm which is said to be durable is used. Shade trees has been planted the whole way. From Tap Tiang we walked about 2 miles till we reached the Rest house where we were to sleep. It was built for the reception of the King who however did not use it. It is a good house standing high overlooking the plain with the hills in the distance. Trang is famous for its good pepper which commands a high price and is said to have a special aroma. There were plantations on either side of the road. The pepper vine is trained on two sorts of soft wood trees, mengkudu and dedap. The vines are grown on red soil which is kept clean. During the dry season, which lasts several months, the plants are regularly watered from wells. The planters are all Chinese chiefly Cantonese and a few Hokiens. At Yong Set\u00e1r pepper is grown in black soil by Tiochews who do not water the plants. If watered when young it has to be continued. To the East are the hills on the way to Na-k\u00f3n, then the Pat\u00e1l\u00f3ng hills with the highest range Foi-dow, and further south Pelian and Set\u00fal. The climate on the East of the hills is said to be quite different. Padi there is two months later and when it is dry this side it is wet beyond the hills. Trang, Girbee and Pung\u00e1 were formerly under Na-k\u00f3n which lies to the North of Sang-Kla called by the Malays Singgora. Na-k\u00f3n is called by the Malays Le-g\u00fcr. The Malays, except the fishermen near the coast, hardly speak any Malay. They are Mahomedans and don\u2019t eat pork but in other respects they adopt Siamese ways. There are one or two Mosques but they\nare badly attended. The Siamese keep pigs. The Chinese marry Siamese girls. No burial grounds are to be seen, the Siamese being cremated at the Wats. There is a Chinese burial ground at Tap Tiang. There are Siamese Schools about the country\u2014education being free. One with 80 boys is about a mile beyond the Rest house and I meant to visit it but had not time. It is held at the Wat and boys from the villages beyond walking distance are lodged at the Wat. The Kam-n\u00e1n makes boys go to School. There are also Chinese private Schools. The upkeep of the Government Schools, cost of books, etc., is defrayed from the Market rent at Tap Tiang.\n\nThe village administration is cheap and appears to be well adapted to the needs of the country. It is the Siamese system either based on, or like that of Burma. There is no forced labour. In Trang are 5 Amp\u00fars, 1 for Kant\u00e1n, 1 for Pelian at Yong Set\u00e1r, 1 for Bong Rat at Tap Tiang, 1 for Khaw Kow (white hill) North of Pat\u00e1l\u00f3ng and 1 fort Si Kow near Ghirbee. The Amp\u00far holds a Court for the trial or settlement of small cases\u2014cases of importance being sent before the Judge at Kant\u00e1n. An Amp\u00far gets 100 Ticals a month and allowances and he probably adds to his income. The only police in the country are at Kant\u00e1n where they are chiefly ornamental, 12 at Tap Tiang (Chinese town) and a few at Yong Set\u00e1r, where there are Chinese pepper planters. The Siamese and Malays are very law abiding and give no trouble. Under the Amp\u00far is the Kam-n\u00e1n or village headman. Of these there are about 30 in Trang. In one or two places where the Chinese predominate a Chinaman is Kam-n\u00e1n. Under the Kam-n\u00e1n is the Phoo-yai-b\u00e1n or head of 10 houses. The people of 10 houses or any collection of houses up to 20 elect the Phoo-yai-b\u00e1n and Phoo-yai-b\u00e1ns elect the Kam-n\u00e1n, one of their number. The Phoo-yai-b\u00e1n receives a badge of Office in the shape of 5 silver buttons which he wears on his coat and the Kam-n\u00e1n has 5 gilt buttons. At intervals along the road are boards on which is notified the name of the village and the position of the Phoo-yai-b\u00e1n\u2019s house. The village headmen look after the roads and bridges and roadside trees, the road being kept up by the people except where it passes padi fields. The coolies who sweep the road and keep it clean are paid. The trees are planted twenty-four feet apart. The only land reve-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nnue is a tax on padi land 8 cents a rei=120 square feet. This is paid to the Ampur who keeps a register. He can keep $300 in his sub-treasury. Over that he must send to Kant\u00e1n. The Kam-n\u00e1n and Phoo-yai-ban get 5% commission on this padi-land tax. The owners of padi land have a document of title (corresponding to the Malacca \u2018extract\u2019) giving the name of the owner, the extent of the land and its position. No charge is made for land for other cultivation than rice, e.g., pepper, coconuts. There is an export duty on pepper of 60 cents a pikul (said to be fixed by treaty). The present price for pepper is high $36 a pikul. The export duty on other produce timber, etc., is 10 per cent. ad valorem and the import duty is 3 per cent. Chinese get on well with Siamese and in the country go to the Wat. I noticed that men and women all have distinct vaccination marks, this is done by two Siamese doctors at the Ampur\u2019s. There are no taxes\u2014no house tax\u2014except on padi land and on fishing which varies according to the fishing ground from $1 to $10 a year. If other taxes were imposed the Siamese would leave. There is no tax on fruit or coconut plantations or sugar or pepper. Land can be sold, the new owner getting the document of title. There is no tax on felling timber\u2014only export duty.\n\nThe population of Trang is 59,000\u201412,000 Malays and Sam-sams, 4,000 Chinese and the rest Siamese. The Revenue is about $120,000 and the expenditure $80,000. The Opium Farm is not included in the Revenue as it is reckoned as part of the Western States Farm. It may be taken as $65,000.\n\nThe Revenue is made up as follows:\n\n|                |        |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Gambling       | $25,000|\n| Spirits        | 25,000 |\n| Customs        | 60,000 |\n| Land, etc....  | 10,000 |\n\n$120,000\n\nIncluding the share in the General Opium Farm the Revenue exceeds the Expenditure, (i.e., what is sanctioned in the Budget) by about $100,000 which is remitted to Bangkok to provide for the needs of the poorer States. There is a proposal\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 42, 1904.\nto abolish the Gambling Farm and impose a poll tax on all males over 18. In the Eastern States where there are few Chinese this has been done. Since the Siamese were prohibited from gambling there has been scarcely any crime. Cock fighting is very popular.\n\nThe expenditure may be roughly stated as follows:\n\n| Item          | Amount |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Salaries      | $30,000|\n| Roads, etc.   | $20,000|\n| Buildings     | $20,000|\n| Other Expenditure | $10,000|\n\n$80,000 *\n\n(Diary continued)\n\nWe got to the Rest house at 7.30 p.m. and had to wait for the cook and boys.\n\nThursday, 5th March.\u2014It was not as cool as it ought to have been. When we got there the Governor said \"It is not cool now because there is a wind\u2014if there is no wind it is cool.\" The wind died down and then it was unmistakeably hot. We made a start at 6.40, Kiat driving me in a dogcart and the Governor following on a pony. The horse was inclined to jib and was only induced to go on (except downhill) by the syce shoving behind. I remarked that we should take some time to get to our destination (11 miles) but Kiat said \"It will go very well when it gets tired.\" There seemed to be little prospect of this so long as the syce pushed us along but when once started it covered the ground well. On sighting a bridge the custom in Trang is for the syce to get down and test the bridge to see if it will bear. We passed through an extensive padi tract\u2014a good deal of it being recently cleared. The Siamese, I should say, are quite as lazy as Malays if not more so. The ground planted with padi is only roughly cleared of timber, and stumps of trees are left. In time these become white ant mounds which are undisturbed\u2014\"too much trouble to remove\" they say. I saw a large number of fine damar oil trees, some standing alone in the plain and some hundred or so together. The solitary\n\n* Figures only approximate not official.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nones are tapped with burning holes and these trees would only last about 5 years. They are not allowed to be filled when the jungle is cleared for padi planting. The oil is sent to Penang in tins. There are said to be many damar trees on the Na-kon road and on the islands. Sim Bee told me that when he went to Trang the only talk was of dacoits and people were afraid to settle. Now they are not afraid and land is being taken up fast.\n\nThe road was being swept like a drive and where there was a collection of houses the people turned out with their headmen and saluted by the roadside. The road was more or less level till we got to the foot of the hills (11 miles). At Chong is a rest-house and a clear stream from the hills. The road to Patalong here rises through a pass. We walked through jungle along a path to what is called a Waterfall, large slabs of rock and pools but not much fall. In the rains of course it is a cascade. We crossed the stream on stepping stones and looked for orchids. We found a few and then had some food by the stream. Then we drove back to the Rest-house and bathed at a well in the grounds. I noticed Congea climbing among the brush wood. We left Chong about 10.0 and got the Rest-house at 11.30. There is another Rest-house 1 hour up the pass above Chong in the jungle where the King of Siam stayed two nights but he is said to have found it too cold. This would be a good place for collecting plants, etc. There are trees planted on either side the whole length of the road\u2014Mangoes, ansana and a Siamese tree with a narrow leaf and yellow flower from which they make hair oil.\n\nAs we passed through Tap Tiang to go to the landing place at Tha Chin we saw a dead black planther by the Market. Black panthers are said to be very common. There is a reward for tigers, 30 Ticals, but none for panthers which only take fowls, pigs, etc. There are too many for a reward. There were 12 junks at Tha Chin built locally and registered at Penang. We had a very hot and tedious row in a house-boat\u2014the river winding backwards and forwards\u2014till at 3.15 we got to the wharf at Kuantan where the S.S. Artsadong comes for cargo. Here a Malay Penghulu registered as a British subject came on board. We got to Kantan at 5.0. I landed and drove with the Governor to see the Public Offices\u2014still unfinished. The bricks\nare made by prisoners. The Offices will be finished \"next year.\" Left Kantan in the Damrong Rut at 5.30. The tide was falling and we touched the first bar or mud flat at the 'Simpang'.\n\nAs we went up the river the serang had ordered firewood to be sent to Kantan for us but it never came so in their usual casual way we began our voyage without fuel. At the firewood depot below the bar we had to anchor for two hours while we took in firewood. It was getting dark and there was no one in charge so they requisitioned boats passing down and eventually our men took a sufficient supply. It was very hot lying at anchor and mosquitoes came off. We had to dine there. As we got to sea there were very black clouds and thunder and lightning. There was a bit of a moon but it came on to blow and the rain drove us below.\n\nFriday, 6th March.\u2014Off the north of Lankawis early\u2014cool\u2014went very slow. Six tame porpoises came and played within a foot of our bows and kept it up some time. We took hours to pass Kedah Peak and it was 4.0 p.m. before we got to the Penang Jetty.\nHunting Invocations.\n\nBy R. N. Bland.\n\nIn the October \"Blackwood\" there is an article by George Maxwell on the subject of a Malay deer-hunt in Perak. I think he has given some excellent translations of the \"Elmu Pawang\" as applied to the rusa or sambur deer, and written a most interesting account of the way in which the Pawang sets to work. It may interest him and others to see an invocation I got from a Pawang in the Negri Sembilan (Kuala Pilah) years ago. My \"Elmu Pawang\" is not nearly so ornate as George Maxwell's, but no doubt every village and district has its own ritual in these matters. There is a family likeness, however, in all of them. The Pawang who is an educated man from the Malay point of view, will produce a much more elaborate \"elmu\" than the Pawang of a jungle village. It is interesting to compare notes in these matters and therefore I send you this \"elmu\" for the S. B. R. A. S.\u2014but I feel as if I were betraying a secret in doing so. These matters are highly confidential. My Pawang only admitted me to his \"craft\" under promise of secrecy and in payment of the customary fees in cloth, knife, coconuts, and \"wang bharu\", and after following the deer on foot for many days through the Muar jungles.\n\nElmu Pawang Buru Rusa.\n\n(Negri Sembilan.)\n\nHei Che' Lanang, Che' Redup,\nChe' Bendang, Che' Merah,\nMari-lah kita berburu\nDalam kandang bhagian engkau\nLuar kandang bhagian aku\nApa main kita jangan di-rosakkan\n\nR.

July.\n\nThis species is very similar to *C. 3-tuberculata* and has, like it, the base of 2nd abdominal segment trituberculated; it is smaller and more slenderly built; has the facial plate smaller, and not raised along the apex; the scutellum is not flat and hollowed and on a level with the mesonotum, but is raised above it and the metanotum, it being slightly, but distinctly, convex; and the mesopleur\u00e6 have a distinct longitudinal furrow below; it being wider, deeper at the base, where it borders the mesosternum; the 2nd abdominal segment is smaller compared with the 3rd and the ovipositor is shorter. The furrow running from the metathoracic furrows is wide and deep; the centre of the metanotum is finely closely longitudinally striated; the top and inner side of the 1st cubital cellule are broadly hyaline and there is a small hyaline spot, longer than broad, in front of the upper side of the recurrent nervure; the lateral furrows on the sides of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segments are distinct; the suturiform articulation is narrower than it is in *3-tuberculata*. The pleur\u00e6, sternum and legs are covered with long white pubescence.\n\n**Chaolta maculifrons**, sp. nov.\n\nLength 9; terebra 8 mm. \u2640.\n\n*Hab.* Kuching. April.\n\nAgrees closely with *C. trituberculata*, having, like it, the base of the 2nd abdominal segment trituberculate, but not so strongly; the front is black except in the centre; the black mark extends to the eyes, is continued behind them all over and, in the middle, is triangularly produced half-way on to the vertex; and the metanotum and back of abdomen are marked with black.\nAntenn\u00e6 black; the scape not quite 3 times longer than broad, the apex toothed at the sides below. Face with a clearly defined semicircular depression over the mouth; covered with pale hair. Front and vertex smooth and shining; the temples broad, not much narrowed, rounded behind; the occiput transverse. Frontal plate smooth, longer than the width at the base; the apex rounded; but not broadly, a furrow leads into it from between the base of the antenn\u00e6, in the centre of which is a keel, which reaches close to the apex of the plate, becoming thicker as it does so. Mesonotum, scutellum and metanotum flat, on one level; scutellum roundly narrowed to the apex. Metanotum and mesosternum blackish. Middle lobe of 1st abdominal segment of equal width; stoutly longitudinally striated, the inner side of the sides more finely and closely striated; the 2nd to 4th segments closely rugosely punctured and striated; the keel on the 2nd segment reaches to the base of the apical fourth; it becomes gradually narrowed to a fine point, is closely longitudinally striated and is bordered laterally by a crenulated furrow; the oblique furrows on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segments are straight, oblique and stoutly striated; the suturiform articulation is crenulated; the 2nd furrow is deep narrow and smooth. Wings yellowish hyaline to near the transverse basal and to the transverse median nervures; the 1st cubital cellule has a hyaline cloud which bifurcates near the middle, the lower branch being the longer, reaching to the apex of the cellule, below which is a smaller cloud projecting backwards from it; the 3rd abscissa of the radius is as long as the basal two united. Fore tarsi twice the length of tibi\u00e6 which are hardly the length of the basal two joints united.\nA new species of Chalcis from Borneo.\n\nBy P. CAMERON.\n\nChalcis borneanus, sp. nov.\n\nBlack; the under side of the scape, the apices of the femora, the base and apex of the tibiae, the tarsi and the tegulae whitish-yellow; the hinder femora red, their middle teeth longish and clearly separated; the apex of the scutellum ending in 2 stout, longer than broad, teeth; the wings hyaline, the nervures black. \u2640\n\nLength 4\u00bd mm.\n\nHab.

Mandibles rufous behind the teeth. Pro- and mesothorax rather strongly and closely punctured; the pronotum at the base on the sides with a distinct keel. Parapsidal furrows wide, curved. Scutellum more widely punctured than the mesonotum, its apex ending in 2 large, bluntly, rounded, longer than broad, finely rugose teeth. Metanotum irregularly reticulated; the central basal area is larger and longer, is obliquely narrowed at the base and becomes narrowed slightly towards the apex. Propleur\u00e6 rugose; the meso-smooth and shining and with some widely separated stri\u00e6 at the base.

Haughton of the Straits Settlements Civil Service compiled a list of the native names, Chinese and Tamil, of some of the most important streets in Singapore.\n\nSince this list was published, Singapore has grown and streets have multiplied, so that Mr. Haughton's list, useful as far as it goes, is somewhat out of date.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 42, 1904.\nI have in the previous pages endeavoured to bring it up to date, as far as the Chinese names are concerned. To do this satisfactorily, is impossible. Exact names for many streets do not exist. In this respect Singapore differs from Penang, where new streets are fewer and more easily identified. It is characteristic of the Chinese that in a matter of this kind, accuracy is the last thing that strikes them as essential. If you ask a Chinaman\u2014or better still a Chinese woman\u2014newly arrived and resident in Singapore, where he lives, the invariable answer will be \"Singapore.\" A second query will perhaps elicit information as to the district of the town or island, but it will take many questions before the actual address can be ascertained, though it might have been given directly, if the person questioned had thought that it was of any importance.\n\nThe Chinese have a happy-go-lucky way of using one expression to describe any one of perhaps a dozen streets. Any Chinaman living at the town-end of Bukit Timah Road, in Albert Street, Selegie Road, near Kandang Kerbau Police Station, Short Street, or in any of the numerous lanes in that neighbourhood will, if asked where he lives, reply \"Tek Kah\" (i.e. Foot of the bamboos), and unless cross-examined would not volunteer any further information, though the answer might mean any one of a dozen streets.\n\nThe more important thoroughfares have recognised names known to Chinese of all classes. There are, however, a number of new and smaller streets, and it appears to me that it is important that these should be easily identified. Especially is it important that official interpreters should have a through knowledge of the names, English and Chinese, for all the streets in the town, a matter in which, in my experience, many Government interpreters are lamentably ignorant.\n\nAs already remarked, in many cases there are no Chinese names for streets. Tanjong Pagar and Kampong Kapor districts are full of new roads and streets, nameless at present to the Chinese, and defying identification. The houses are new and often not occupied by Chinese, but Singapore is a Chinese town and any one who has watched its growth will realise that in all likelihood these new roads will be busy thoroughfares be-\nfore many years are past, and sooner or later no doubt the Chinese will find names for them. Now it seems a pity that street-names should be multiplied unsystematically in Chinese as well as in English, and I should like to see the Municipality step in and take the matter in hand. Suggestions need not be made here as to what plan should be pursued, but there are several alternative methods, and I think something ought to be done.\n\nI should state that infallibility cannot be claimed for this list. Various informants have given contradictory information. However such as it is, it may, I hope, prove useful to any European with a knowledge of Chinese and to any Chinaman with a knowledge of English.\n\nI have added the names for some of the more important bridges, police stations and public buildings, and where I have been able to ascertain them, the names of the country roads and districts. Here I found it very difficult to obtain exact information, most of what is given having been kindly furnished by Mr. Langham-Carter of the Land Office.\n\nFollowing will be found a list some of the places with which Singapore has connections, commercial or otherwise. This includes the names of European States and, at the other extreme, local coast ports.\n\nMr. E. A. Gardiner of the Straits Police kindly sent me a list of the names of streets in Malacca, with some interesting notes by Mr. Go Lai Kui, the Government Interpreter there.\n\nAnd through the courtesy of various officers of the Federated Malay States Civil Service, I have been furnished with the Chinese equivalents for the names of the most important places in the States.\n\nMr. A. M. Pountney contributed Selangor.\nMr. W. Cowan sent the Perak names, with notes by Mr. W. D. Barnes.\nFor Pahang I am indebted to the District Officers at Raub and Kuala Lipis.\nThe Negri Sembilan names were supplied through Mr. Ridges.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 42, 1904.\nI was unable to obtain Chinese names for up-country Kam-pongs in Malacca\u2014there are none apparently\u2014and the Chinese population is comparatively thin there.\n\nPenang and Province Wellesley have already been dealt with in the admirable notes of Mr. Lo Man Yuk.\n\nFinally I must express my thanks to Messrs. Ho Siak Kuan and Leung Pui Kam of the Chinese Protectorate in Singapore and Penang respectively, for their assistance in filling in the Chinese characters for the names.\n\nPenang, March, 1904.\nAddendum to Mr. Hose's paper on Methods of Reckoning Time.\n\nSince this paper was written a good deal more information about the Kenyah Sundial has come to hand, and it is evident that the methods employed by the different tribes in measuring the noon-day shadow and the omens attached to the respective lengths of the shadow vary considerably. This is but natural since the different tribes plant their crops at different times of the year. A figure of a measuring-stick (asu do) of the Aki Kenyahs, a down-river tribe who plant in July, is now given; the actual specimen is in the Sarawak Museum, and I am indebted to the curator, Mr. R. Shelford, for the drawing.\n\nExplanation of the Figure.\n\nStick (asu do) used by the Kenyahs to measure the shadow cast by the Sundial (tukar do).\n\nThe stick is 72 centimetres in length and 1.7 centimetres broad; one border is notched. The end marked by an asterisk in the figure is held in the hand so that the stick lies along the extended arm, the notches corresponding to certain regions of the arm and hand. The relation of the length of the shadow cast at noon-day by the tukar do to the spaces between the notches determines the omen given by the dayong as described in the paper. The letters A to H refer to the spaces between the notches.\n\nA.

The exception is a big one. If in the same way I were to say that Professor Brandstetter of Lucerne is the soundest and most accurate Malayan scholar in Europe, outside of Holland, I should be merely stating in the fewest words a plain fact which in my judgment, is not as widely known as it deserves to be; and I hope that no one will so far misunderstand my meaning as to imagine that I am attempting to make a scurvy jest at the expense of that learned writer. Under the general title of \"Malayo-Polynesische Forschungen\" he has issued a number of very valuable studies on Malayan subjects, whose titles I subjoin in a note for the benefit of all whom it may concern.*\n\n*First Series.\n\nI.

Soc., No. 42, 1904;\nis not room here to discuss them all, nor are they all of equal interest to readers in the Malay Peninsula; I will therefore confine myself to those which appeal more particularly to students of Malay.\n\nHis two studies on the \"relation of Malagasy to Malay\" (1893; pp. 43) and on \"Tagal and Malagasy\" (1902; pp. 85), taken together, give a very clear idea of the interconnection of these languages and throw considerable light on their past history and development.\n\nBrandstetter's strong point is his strictly scientific method. He will not accept conjectural identifications or vague unsupported theories of relationship: he distinguishes most carefully between what he considers to be proved and what is merely probable. Consequently his results, when they are such as he himself considers certain, may be accepted with a high degree of confidence by his readers.\n\nIn choosing two languages so widely separated in geographical distribution as Tagal (or Tagalog) and Malagasy for his points of comparison, he brings out very strikingly the essential unity of the Malayan family of languages, a unity which is evidently due to common descent and not, as Crawfurd perversely maintained, to the influence of Malay or Javanese modifying a number of originally alien tongues. English students of this subject seem to find a difficulty in getting away from the idea that Malay is the normal type of a Malayan language: that, however, is very far from being the case. From the point of view of phonology, Malay is often relatively very archaic, much nearer to the original sounds, than some of the cognate tongues (e.g. Malagasy and Javanese); but even in this regard Malay is not always the truest representative of the primitive type. Then again Malay lacks many old words which have been preserved in distant and widely separated parts of the Malayopolynesian region; and this, as van der Tuuk pointed out long ago, is proof enough that they do not owe their common element to Malay. Further, Malay is so much simplified in its grammar that it occupies in the Malayan family much the same relative position, that modern Persian or English occupy among the Indo-European languages: its system of agglutination has been re-\nduced to a mere remnant, whereas some of these languages have preserved it in something like its primitive luxuriance. In this respect Tagal and Malagasy are more archaic than Malay. An example will best explain what is meant. The Malay surat \"writing,\" is represented in Tagal by sulat, in Malagasy by s\u00f3ratra (Malagasy o is pronounced u).\n\nThis verb can be conjugated thus in these two languages:\n\n**ACTIVE.**\n\n|       | Tagal          | Malagasy        |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Present | nanunulat      | manoratra       |\n| Preterite | nanulat       | nanoratra       |\n| Future   | manunulat      | hanoratra       |\n| Imperative | manulat     | manar\u00e1ta        |\n\n**PASSIVE.**\n\n|       | Tagal          | Malagasy        |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Present | sinusulatan    | sor\u00e1tana        |\n| Preterite | sinulatan    | nosoratana      |\n| Future   | susulatan      | hosoratana      |\n| Imperative | sulatan    | sor\u00e1ty*         |\n\nHere, besides prefixes and suffixes, infixes and reduplication play, in Tagal, a great part.\n\nIt is not necessary to add here, by way of contrast, the meagre list of variations which the Malay verb usually assumes: they will be familiar to the reader. Apart from these, there are in Malay (as Dr. Luering pointed out in No. 39 of this Journal) a few scattered survivals which show that the language formerly had a more fully elaborated system of agglutination than it now possesses.\n\nThe comparison of some of the words common to Tagal and Malagasy (of which Brandstetter gives a remarkably long and interesting list) shows that in some cases a form more archaic than that of Malay must be inferred as the common original. Thus, for instance, it is practically certain that \"fire\"\n\n---\n\n* y\u2014i, as in English at the end of a word: Malagasy spelling was invented by English missionaries.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 42, 1904.\nwas once apui not api, and \"dead\" matai, \"liver\" hatai, and so on. But even more interesting, perhaps, is the light which these common words throw on the state of civilization of the primitive ancestors of these tribes before their dispersion. It is clear from the comparative vocabulary that they were quite at home on the tropical seas; they have common words for the sea and the shore, for the crocodile, the prawn, the ray or skate (fish), and the dugong (though the Malagasy trozona now means whale, apparently); they had sails for their boats and they used hooks for fishing. Two, at least, of the points of the compass are represented by common words, though their relative directions have shifted and no longer correspond in the different languages. So too for words relating to life on land: they were acquainted with rice, yams, bamboo and, probably, the cocoanut and screw-palm (pandanus); their material civilization comprised acquaintance with iron and, apparently, silver; they had knives and files, and hewed wood into stakes and planks; they had houses with walls and roofs; they had pots, dishes and spoons (or ladles) and mortars with pestles (probably the large ones even now used for pounding rice); and they wore garments of some sort of cloth. They had some simple standards of measurement, notably the fathom (the distance across the outstretched arms). They had words for \"month\" and \"year,\" and a series of numerals to 1000, inclusive. Words relating to the transactions of life in a social community are also not altogether absent; buying and borrowing, debt and payment, are ideas which appear to have been familiar to them; and they are not without words which indicate differences of social rank, e.g. the existence of chiefs to whom personal respect was due. The widespread institution of the \"taboo\" appears to have already existed among them in those early days.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive account of the condition of these people: I have merely picked out a few of the salient facts embodied in Brandstetter's list of words, and these it must be remembered are drawn from Tagal and Malagasy only. If the other Malayan languages (whose name is legion) were taken into account, many additional details could be added to this outline sketch: it is enough, however, to show that such\nresearches as these may lead to very interesting discoveries, quite apart from the merely technical details of philology.\n\nThese last I shall not pretend to deal with here, only referring the reader to these two valuable monographs, where he will find them set out and very skilfully handled.\n\nI have left myself little space to notice the other numbers of the series to which I would draw particular attention. Of the Hikayat Hang Tuah I will merely say that it is an historical romance of the life of the well-known Malacca hero, and that while it is probably of no great value from the point of view of history strictly so called, it is a highly interesting picture of Malay life and manners and by no means deserves the unmixed contempt which Crawfurd thought fit to pour upon it. It dates probably from the early part of the 17th century and is a recognized specimen of the best type of Malay classical prose literature.\n\nThe only other of Brandstetters' works which I propose to mention here is his essay on the Malay appreciation of the beauties of nature (and their aesthetic sense in general) as evidenced in their literature. Here he lays a good deal of Malay prose and poetry under contribution and by a number of well selected examples reveals a side of the Malay character which is not, I think, in their everyday life at least, very obvious to the ordinary observer. He has confined himself to literary works older than the 19th century, to the exclusion of all modern productions, and perhaps therefore European influence may be discounted: the question of the imitation of India models is more difficult, but on the whole Brandstetter is disposed to regard the mental attitude which he illustrates as being really original to the Malay mind, and he has not to take his examples from works, like the Sri Rama, which are avowedly based on Indian originals. Even in these, however, it may be remarked that the local colouring is distinctly Malay; and one need only look, for instance, at the beautiful passage quoted and translated by Maxwell on pp. 89 and 90 of No. 17 of this Journal, to be convinced that the Malay rhapsodist from whom Maxwell derived his version of the story has not servilely copied any Indian model but has given the rein to his own fancy and freely exercised his own descriptive power.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 42, 1904.\nIt is impossible to go into details here, but I hope that the indications I have given will induce some of the readers of this Journal to refer both to Brandstetter's essay and to his Malay originals. Victor Hugo did not disdain to translate Malay pantuns: a poet himself, he could appreciate the poetry which many of them so quaintly embody, and I venture to think that an anthology could be made up out of Malay literature which would be worthy to rank with many other such collections in better known languages. Unfortunately the Malay genius does not lend itself to sustained effort: it rises here and there to real heights of poetic fancy, but taken as a whole it is undoubtedly pedestrian. All the more reason, therefore, is there for picking out the gems which lie hidden amongst so much that is little better than dross.\n\nThis short notice can hardly do justice to the excellence of Brandstetter's work: I can say no more, in summing up, than that that he is a worthy pupil of the Dutch School, and that in attempting to carry on the work of Malayan research beyond the confines of Holland and Netherlands India, he is setting an example which may well be followed elsewhere. It is unfortunate that the work of Dutch scholars in this line of study is so little known to English readers. The initial difficulties are not nearly as great as they are supposed to be: one can easily pick up enough understanding of the Dutch written language to be able to read intelligently a Dutch essay on a Malayan subject. However, as Englishmen, persistently and very much to their own disadvantage, continue to ignore the Dutch authorities, perhaps it may be some help to such of them as have a fair knowledge of German to have Brandstetter's work to refer to. His work, however, is purely original, though he has been trained in the Dutch school and would be the first to acknowledge his indebtedness to it, as indeed he repeatedly does; and when one says that he is making for himself a place in the list of distinguished Malayan scholars which holds such names as van der Tuuk, Kern, Niemann and Brandes, one need, I think, say no more.\n\nC.
