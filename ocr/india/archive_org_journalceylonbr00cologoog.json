Niethner, Esq.,\nMember of the Society of Naturalists of Berlin, Entomological Society of Stettin, &c.,\n\nNo. I.\n\nIntroductory Note on the publication of New Species under disadvantages such as describing Entomologists necessarily labour under in countries remote from European centres of science.\n\nI little doubt that the following descriptions of new Coleoptera will meet with anything but approbation from the Entomological world at home. As, however, in spite of this anticipation of an ungracious reception, I do not for the present intend to desist from my purpose of publishing such descriptions, I may as well try to vindicate this measure by setting forth the reasons which induce me to consider the difficulties which beset the path of the entomological author in this country as not insurmountable.\n\nThe objections raised against me will be these:\u2014considering the state Entomological literature is still in\u2014that is to\nsay, considering that it has not, generally speaking, been condensed into a certain limited and obtainable number of volumes, as is the case in the higher branches of Zoology and Botany; that, on the contrary, the bulk of it consists of fragments which float without order in the misty and unfathomable ocean of scientific journals; it is next to impossible that an individual entomologist abroad should surround himself with this shapeless mass of learning, and keep himself, by this, or other means, so well informed of the details of the actual progress of the science, as not to be exposed to mistakes of one kind or another, but more specially to creating synonymy* in attempting to work independently. It will further be said against me, that not having the facilities and the wholesome check which arise from the diligent use of extensive and well-named collections, not even having the gratification of a brother entomologist's views and opinions on doubtful cases, it will be impossible even to determine whether an insect be new or not; and from these reasons (the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will be) entomologists abroad should confine themselves to collecting and observing the habits of the objects of their attention, but\n\n* Synonymy is, and always will be, an unavoidable evil to which descriptive science is liable under any circumstances. My arguments are merely intended to uphold the possibility to reduce it to such a nature, and to limit it to so small an extent, as to be of little importance if weighed against the merits the publications in which it occurs may be possessed of in other respects, and, therefore, to be pardonable. In case, however, I should eventually ascertain that I am mistaken on this point, I shall then abandon my pursuits, or at all events, my present mode of following them up. I feel certain, that every enthusiastic naturalist, who has travelled in foreign parts, will support my cause, and understand and appreciate my striving to become the herald of my own discoveries.\n\nI am well aware that there is more than one way to attain this end, and that the one I have selected is perhaps not the best; but circumstances have hitherto barred me from those upon which I might lay myself less open to censure. In a position like mine only, where they are my principal support, books are well tested; and whoever has tested them under such circumstances, will know that much of the synonymy created abroad, is referable to them, and not to the student.\nthey should never go to print with matters on which it is an impossibility for the ablest among them to be quite competent. These arguments are unfortunately too true, but still, I think, admit of being mitigated sufficiently to come to final conclusions less disheartening to the entomological student abroad than the above.\n\nFirst of all, every entomologist gives preference to a certain order of insects\u2014say Coleoptera\u2014and in this even, in almost all cases, to one or two particular families. In studying for the publication of new species, under the disadvantages just mentioned, he will confine himself to this order, or perhaps family. Now, although as objected above, the information existing on this particular branch, is for the most part fragmentary, still there are certain families, on which it has received tangible shape, through condensation by old hands:\u2014Burmeister's Lamellicornia, Dejean's Carabidae, Erichson's Staphylinae, Schoenherr's Curculionidae, Boheman's Cassidae, Westwood's Paussidae, etc., as well as the latter author's general work on the families, and Lacordaire's on the general Coleopterorum, diligently consulted, go as guides a long way, and should, although some of them have by the rapid progress of the science grown rather antiquated, guard against a number of mistakes of a systematic nature.\n\nAs to whether a beetle be new or not, I admit that in forming an opinion on this question, the entomologist, situated as above, will have quite as much to be guided by a certain tact (not clearly definable, but understood by scientific men) than by anything else; and I am forced to concede that under any circumstances almost, it is totally impossible to arrive at an indisputable certainty either the one way or the other. This, however, excludes by no means the possibility of his forming an opinion with so much precision as to enable him to pronounce in the matter with a very high degree of confidence and all probability in his favour. In attempting to come to a decision on this difficult point, he will receive a first superficial idea, from careful reflection on certain accidental circumstances, such as size, scarcity, or other peculiarities of the insect in question.\nThis idea, whichever way it may incline, will then either gain or lose in strength by diligent reference to his library, until at length, with a certain amount of tact and judgment, he will arrive at a result which, under such circumstances, must carry much weight with it.\n\nI shall illustrate this case by an example. If, for instance, after collecting five years in Ceylon generally, and in the Western Province more especially, I find at the latter place an insect\u2014say the *Chlaenius pulcher* described below\u2014for the first time\u2014am I not entitled to consider it as very scarce? If on consulting my library I discover nothing which can possibly refer to it (finding that not a single *Chlaenius* is marked as occurring in Ceylon), are not the chances greatly in favour of its being an undescribed species? If, again, I collect beetles as small and inconspicuous as the *Trichopteryx* described below, and consider at the same time, that, although they are in certain localities of common occurrence, no professional Coleopterologist has ever collected them before me in this Island; if moreover, again, my library offers nothing that could possibly refer to them individually (there being hardly an Asiatic species mentioned),\u2014am I not under these circumstances justified in considering them as undescribed? Decidedly. Circumstances like these would indeed be altogether conclusive, if there was not a chance of the beetle occurring in some neighbouring country, and its having thence found its way into the normal collections of Europe. The possibility of such being the case, enhances the difficulties of the case of course very materially; and I am forced to admit that the means of overcoming them are very unreliable. One deficiency, descriptions of new species furnished under these circumstances, will almost always have: namely, the comparison (so desirable, if not essential, in large genera) with another allied and known species, will be wanting; but this stands or falls with the system from which it is inseparable.\n\nI think I have said enough to shew, that the disadvantages the entomologist encounters here, or in other places similarly situated, in conscientiously attempting to publish new species\nmay (his principal assistance being perseverance, a good library, and tact\u2014entomological instinct I am almost tempted to call it)\u2014I am far from saying entirely,\u2014be overcome so far as to expose him, from want of resources in the execution of his plan, to no more mistakes then entomologists expose themselves to under more favourable circumstances from neglecting them.\n\nBut I am not satisfied with obtaining the simple grant of permission to describe on the spot a part of what he collects. I claim more for the entomologist abroad. I wish to show that he should naturally be expected, nay desired, to do so; for although he labours under distressing disadvantages in some respects, he happily enjoys a proportionate share of advantages in others. It is unsatisfactory in the extreme for an enthusiastic entomologist to be obliged to let his collections go out of his own hands,\u2014see others reap the honors from them, which are to be reaped on such occasions,\u2014or perhaps see as it were a gulf close over them, hear no more of them, and find himself forgotten. For what is a mere collector? Let him display as much industry as possible, he is hardly looked upon as an entomologist\u2014certainly, as long as he is prevented from publishing anything, not as a scientific one. Now, if such a man merely desists from publishing the fruits of his researches from want of resources to assist him to go creditably through such a task,\u2014if he suffers his collections to go out of his hands, because he is too true a lover of science not to see the credit in a great measure due to himself reaped rather by another than to hoard up his entomological treasures, a useless heap, eventually to be destroyed by moths and time\u2014I say, that a man who acts upon principles like those, finds himself not seldom disheartened in the prosecution of his studies under difficulties such as I have set forth. If, however, as I have endeavoured to point out, these difficulties can be overcome to a very considerable extent, is anything more natural than that he should be the herald of his discoveries himself? Could anything be more unkind and ungenerous on the part of his scientific\nbrethren at home, than to oppose and discourage him by their disapprobation?\n\nI might enlarge on this subject, which has been a sore one with me for a long time, to a great extent, but I think this is sufficient to direct the reader into the train of my ideas and to enable him to follow it up.\n\nI hasten therefore to conclude. As mentioned above, the Tropical entomologist has a proportionate share of advantages to balance what falls to his lot of the contrary; one of these advantages which he has over his brethren at home is, that he has an opportunity of seeing and studying alive what can at home only be examined in state differing more or less from that of life. Therefore, if he is enabled and expected to describe new species, it is moreover highly desirable for the sake of the promulgation of sound information, that he should do so, that he should avail himself of this, his principal advantage, and describe, fresh from nature, as many of his favourites and their habits as possible; and discouraging him in such an undertaking on any of the above grounds would be discouraging the progress of science in general.\n\n1.

The head is of a bright green colour with the labrum and the mandibles of a deep, and the antenn\u00e6 and palpi of a light brown, the latter being darkened towards the end. The thorax is of the same colour as the head, reflecting a copper hue from the back, its anterior angles are obtuse, the basal ones being righte\nelytra are of the same greenish copper colour but darker; they are impressed with longitudinal lines, which are bordered on each side by a row of minute hairs. They as well as the abdomen have yellowish margins.\n\n2. Chlaenius regulosus.

The mandibles are of deep brown, the palpi and antennae of yellowish colour darkened towards the tip. The lobes of the mentum tooth are externally rounded. The elytra are marked by two subapical spots of yellowish colour and semilunar shape (the back of the lunulae being turned towards the suture). The striae verge near the apex by twos into each other. The abdomen is distinguished by having a yellow margin and apex.\n\n3. Scarites minor. N.\n\nS. elongatus, niger, nitidus, subtus nigro piceus, pedibus piceis, tarsis, antennis palpisque castaneis.

The head is subquadrate, in front with two deep longitudinal impressions, behind the eyes finely sulcated. The labrum is of the usual shape, the eyes are not very prominent. The antennae are of about the same length as the head; the first joint is about as long as the three following together; the second, which is generally longer than the third, is in this case of the same length, joints 1-4 are naked, 5-11 pilose, increasing towards the tip gradually in size and thickness, taking at the same time a subquadratic and depressed shape. The mandibles are strong, much dilated and dentated from before the middle to the base, the right one having additional subapical tooth. The maxillae also are strong, but slightly bent at the apex, where they are also slightly excavated. The labial palpi have the last joint longer than third, elongated and elliptic. The thorax is oblong, with the basal angles obliquely truncated. The elytra are oval, striated, granulated at the base, and have, as has also the thorax, a narrow margin. The anterior tarsi are furnished externally with five teeth, the two last ones of which, however, are very small. The posterior legs are similarly provided, but the teeth are indistinct. The joints of the tarsi are slightly excavated below. The sides of the body below are rugose.\n\n4. Clivina rugosifrons. N.\n\nC ferruginea, capite, thorace abdomineque piceis. Long. corp. 4\u00bd lin lat 1\u00bd lin.\n\nCaput rugosum, inter oculos elevatum, elevatione plana antice profund\n1-impressa. Mentum lobis subtiliter sulcatia.

The head is very rugose, the clypeus is contracted behind the apical angles, and then produced again into another pair of angles. The labrum is transverse, slightly sinuated in front, with the angles rounded and setose. The mentum is quadrate, the lobes rounded at the apex and slightly sulcated, the tooth is strong, of equal length with lobes, and of the typical spear-headed form. The ligula has the apical angle much elongated, terminating in a membranaceous bristle which is bifurcate at the tip. The maxillary palpi have the last joint elongate, cylindrico-conic; that of the labial ones is still more elongate, elliptic. The antennae have the basal joints elongate, those towards the tip rounded. They and the legs are hairy, otherwise the insect is of a bright polished surface.\n\n5. Clivina elongatula. N.\n\nC. elongata, subdepressa, supra nigro-picea, subtus picea, pedibus elytrorumque margine castaneis, antennis oreoque dilutioribus.

Subtus parce punctata.\n\nEbi pr\u00e6cedentem frequenter legi.\n\nI have not dissected the labium of this species, which, however, is at once recognised by its depressed and, in proportion to its width, very long shape. The labrum, antennae, and legs, are so much like those of the former, that they need no further description.\n\n6. Clivina maculata. N.\n\nC. picea, elytris ferrugineis infra medium macula nigra obsolet ornatis, pedibus intermed. et post. oreoque brunneo-testaceis, pedibus ant. antennisque obscurioribus.

Elytra striata in striis profunde punctata.\n\nUbi pr\u00e6cedentes specimen singulum legi.\nAs distinguished as the preceding two species. The palpi and the mentum appear to me of a somewhat extraordinary form. The last joint of the former is considerably and more inflated at the base than in any other Ceylon species that has hitherto come under my notice, whilst the others are of a very curved appearance in both the maxillary and labial palpi. The insect is, however, easily distinguished by its general facies, which is rather like that of a Dyschirius; from which genus, however, the mentum alone is sufficient to separate it. I may as well remark here, that, although the Island is well supplied with Scarites and Clivinas, I have hitherto not discovered a single Dyschirius, a genus so well represented in Europe. Of the three Clivinas, just described, single specimens only have been in my possession for a considerable time. There are three or four more species met with about Colombo, but these being of common occurrence, I abstain from describing them here, as they may possibly be amongst those described by Putzeys or others from the Indian continent.\n\n7. Edichirus alatus. N.\n\n\u0152. alatus, setosus, nitidus, rufo-testaceus, thorace dilutiore, capite, elytris abdominisque segmentis 3 ultimis nigris; elytris apice 2 maculatis, maculis rufo-testaceis; pedibus flavis, femoribus apice tibiisque basi nigrescentibus; antennis palpisque maxill. basi obscuris, apice testaceis, reliquis oris partibus rufo-piceis. Long. corp. 3\u00bd lin.\n\n\u0152. paderino Er. similimus, praeter colorum distributionem differt tamen alis, elytrorum antennarumque articuli ultimi sculptura. Antennae art. ultimo penultimo aequali nisi paulo minore, apice fortiter truncato leviterque excavato. Thora \u0152. paderini, dorso punctis biseriatis impressus, serie interna vel centrali elliptica punctis minoribus magis inter se approximatis, externa vel submarginali punctis magnis distantibus. Elytra oblonge subquadrata, infra medium rotundata, thorace longiora et duplo fere amplior (atrumque elytrum thoracis fere magnitudine), basi parte thoracis adiacente duplo-, infra medium illius latitudine antica plus tertia parte latiora. Os, pedes et abdomen \u0152. paderini.\n\nPaderorum more victitare videtur; in eorum societate in lacus Colombensis ripis infrequentissime legi; illis minus gracilis atque minus agilis.\n\nI have not had an opportunity of examining specimens of either of the three \u0152dichiri hitherto described. However, I\nhave before me Erichson's figure and description of the Sicilian *C. paderinus*, with which I find my species strongly to agree. It differs, however, from the former materially in the following three points, viz., the wings, the sculpture of the wing-covers, and the last antennal joint. The fact that this species has wings, would render an alteration in Erichson's diagnosis of the genus necessary, it being characterized therein as \"apterous\". The elytra are not so much contracted and rounded at the base, and, being longer than the thorax, have therefore a more oblong, subquadratic appearance. As in the above typical species, they are, however, rounded at the sides and broadest a little below the middle. They are about twice as broad at the base as the adjoining part of the thorax; and in their broadest part rather more than a third broader than the thorax in its. The third point, in which the two species differ, is the last joint of the antennae, which, in this case, is strongly truncated at the tip and slightly excavated. They are further distinguished by the distribution of the colours, my species being of a dark yellowish red, thorax lighter, head, elytra and three last abdominal segments black, elytra with two reddish spots at the apex, legs yellowish, at the apex of the femora and base of the tibiae blackish, the mouth is brown, the maxill. palpi yellowish with the three first joints dark at the base, the antennae have the six basal joints dark excepting at the apex, where they, as well as the five remaining ones, are yellowish. In all other points I find the insect to agree entirely with the typical *C. paderinus*: the palpi, legs, and anal segment of abdomen are of the same structure, the hairy vestiture is exactly the same in the different parts of the body of my species as it is in the corresponding ones of Erichson's.\nNo. II.\n\nI.

Calleida, excepting the ligula which in this case is obtusely acuminated, the last joint of the maxill. palpi which is obtuse at the apex, and the thorax, which is not as in Calleida longer than broad, but the reverse. From Cymindis it would differ principally in the deeply bilobed fourth tarsal joint, and in some other minor points, but it is difficult to say what the true characteristics of this genus are, if even Lacordaire uses the particle \"ou\" not less than five times in the diagnosis he gives of it in his g. d. Col. It would also appear to be allied to Plochionus, differing from this g., however, in the obtuse extremity of the terminal joint of the maxill. palpi, and the deeply bilobed fourth tarsal joint. However, if Lacordaire's diagnoses are exact, I feel justified in separating Anchista from all these genera. The name \"Anchista\",\nhas reference to the affinity of the insect to the two genera just mentioned, whilst the specific name \"modesta,\" refers to its inconspicuous colours. Amongst its peculiarities weight ought to be laid upon the plumpness of the palpi, in fact all other parts of the mouth, and even the whole head, which was very striking to me.\n\nLike many of my best Carabidae I found this insect at night on the table, whither it had been attracted by the light. The anterior tarsi are dilated, and furnished with hairy brushes below, longest at the apex of the lobes of the fourth joint.\n\n**II. ELLIOTIA. n. g. N.**\n\nFam. CARABID\u00c6.\n\nTrib.

Agilis est et avolare semper expeditus.\n\nA pretty and very interesting little insect, about whose systematic position I am not quite satisfied; however, I provisionally place it towards the end of the true Lebiidae. I find it most to agree with the descriptions of the g. Pentagonica S. G. and Rhombodera R., with neither of which, however, it is identical. The head is distinguished by the large and prominent eyes, and four deep impressions, two larger ones at the root of the antennae, two smaller ones between the eyes, also by a very distinct neck which connects it with the thorax; the labrum is large, transverse and entire, with the angles rounded off and the base narrowed; the mentum is but slightly transversely emarginated, edentate; the ligula is truncated at the tip, the paraglossae adhere to it, reach a little beyond it, and are obtuse at the apex; the palpi are rather long with the last joint elliptic, acuminate; the antennae are strong, filiform, and reach beyond the shoulders, joints 5-10 are of equal length and cylindric, 4-11 are pilose. The most remarkable part of the insect is, however, the thorax, which is of a subrhomboidal shape, transverse, smaller than the head, as broad again as long; it has two strong lateral angles at the middle, each furnished with a strong bristle, the anterior part has the sides rounded, the posterior abruptly obliquely contracted, at the base it is cylindric. As a specific distinction of the thorax, I mention, moreover, that in the present species it is impressed with two deep punctures before the middle and that it is rugose at the case. The abdomen is slightly peduncled. The scutellum is slightly excavated. The elytra are oval, rather convex and impressed with rows of punctures. The legs are simple and weak, apparently equal in both sexes. The anterior tarsi are little stouter than the rest, but not dilated nor furnished with any additional clothing below; the anterior tibiae are deeply notched. As to the colour: the head and wing covers are black, the latter with the suture and margin of a light brown and highly polished, the thorax is reddish, and the legs are whitish. The insect\nis very agile, and ever ready to take to its wings. It is of quite a peculiar appearance, imparted to it by its large eyes, small curiously shaped thorax and rather plump elytra and abdomen. I may further mention, that I have observed the fourth joint of the maxillary palpi to collapse when the specimens become quite dry, so as to give them a different, spoon-like appearance, apt to mislead any one who has not examined fresh specimens.\n\n10.

It is very agile and ready to take to its wings, which are of the beautiful typical construction, about twice the length of the body, and in dead specimens frequently produced behind. These insects vary a little as to shape, some being more narrowed behind than others, and also as to the exact number of the abdominal segments left uncovered by the elytra, generally three or four. The head is large, but exhibits nothing abnormal or extraordinary; the thorax is very large, emarginated in front and behind, with the angles acute, the basal ones enveloping the shoulders; the wing-covers are subquadratic, with the angles rounded off and a little narrowed behind; the legs have the tibi\u00e6 incrassated in the middle, and the posterior cox\u00e6 very much dilated and distant from each other; in all other respects they are typical. The shape of the body is that of an egg, broadest at the shoulders, gently narrowed towards the apex of the abdomen, and rounded off towards the head.\n11. TRICHOPTERYX IMMATURA.

Its most striking peculiarity consists in the posterior coxae, which are little distant from each other as those of the anterior legs, and almost touch each other, and also in the shortness of the tarsi. The head with the antenn\u00e6, the mesosternum, the tibiae, which are incrassated in the middle, the posterior coxae, with regard to the enlargement, are quite typical. However, the thorax and elytra differ again from those of T. cursitans, (which in every respect may be looked upon as the typical representative of the family in Ceylon, and which is here referred to as such) the former by the shortness of the posterior\nangles, which can hardly be said to envelope the shoulders, the elytra, by being less or not at all narrowed behind, giving an oblong rather than an oval shape to the insect. Although in length only about one-half shorter, it is in bulk certainly one-fourth smaller than T. cursitans, and, although probably the smallest Ceylon beetle, it is distinguished at first sight.\n\n13.

Ptilium is the repository for all the anomalies of the family, its characteristics therefore are very vague; but if the absence of the mesosternal carina and the simplicity of the posterior coxae are the determining features amongst them, the present species, in spite of a variety of anomalies it exhibits in other respects, belongs to it. The head is of middling size; the antenn\u00e6 robust with the first joint of the club of the shape of an inverted cone, the second rather cylindrical, narrowed at the base, and the last elongate, ovate. The thorax is of very different structure from that of the foregoing species of the family, the basal angles being unusually far produced beyond the shoulders; towards the head it is strongly and rapidly rounded off, being thus altogether of a semi-circular shape; at the apex it is merely slightly sinuated, and the head is inserted rather below than in this sinuosity; the whole thorax moreover is very convex, whilst the elytra are depressed. The wings vary from the typical form by being fringed with short simple cilia, instead of those long feathery appendages; they are moreover without a distinct peduncle, but still folded in the manner characteristic of the family. The legs are stout\nwith the tibiae thickest at the tip; the third tarsal joint is of the length of the preceding two; the latter are somewhat bilobed and hairy below. The posterior coxae are simple and distant. The mesosternum without a carina. The whole shape of the insect is quadratic rather than otherwise.\n\n14. Ptenidium macrocephalum.

The wing-covers are oval, a little inflated about the middle, rounded at the apex, and longer and wider than the abdomen. The prosternum is carinated.\n\nIt affords me much gratification to be enabled to publish representatives of three genera of this highly interesting and probably very extensive and widely-distributed family of pygmies, the South Asiatic representatives of which have hitherto been entirely unknown. I have no doubt that even this Island is the abode of a great many more species.\n\n15. Sterus barbatus.

B. of the g., both having the abdomen immarginate and the fourth tarsal joint bilobed. Everything about this species is elongated. The head is about one-third broader than the thorax, the forehead is slightly excavated with two elevated ridges running from the root of the antenn\u00e6 a short distance upwards, a third runs from the crown of the head down towards the centre of the two former, but all three reach only about the middle of the head. The part below the antenn\u00e6 is covered with white hair. The antenn\u00e6 have the third joint much elongated and the terminal club composed of elliptic joints. The thorax is rather slender, incrassated at the middle, gradually narrowed in front but nearly quadratic behind. The elytra are longer than the thorax, about double its breadth and oval, being slightly narrowed at the shoulders and the apex. The legs are long and slender, hairy at the apex of the tibi\u00e6 and the tarsi, the latter very much so on the inner side. The insect is of a metallic black color, highly polished; the legs, palpi and the first two antennal joints are whitish, the tibi\u00e6 and the apex of the palpi being, however rather darker, joints 3-11 of the antenn\u00e6 are brownish, the coxae and the mouth are yellowish, the tarsi have a brown spot at the apex of the first three joints, the claws are black. The insect is punctured all over, but the abdomen, the apical segments of which are indeed nearly smooth, less so than the rest of the body, and sparingly covered with small white hairs.\n\n16.

It is well distinguished by the rounded club-joints of the antennae, the elevated anterior margin of the thorax, the prominent shoulders, and its general shortness and plumpness. The forehead is rather more depressed or excavated than in the former, the two antennal ridges are shorter, the vertical one is altogether obsolete. The palpi are robust. The third antennal joint is about one third longer than the fourth. The thorax is shorter and plumper than in the former. The elytra are less oval, having the shoulders more prominent and only the apex rounded off or narrowed. The legs are similar to those of the former, but more robust, less hairy, and have the tarsi more cylindric. The insect is of a blackish metal color, the legs and palpi are yellowish, the tibiae, however, the apex of the palpi, and also joints 1-2 of the antennae rather darker; the femora are blackish towards the end, the mouth and joints 3-11 of the antennae are chestnut, and the coxae pitch-color. The animal is densely and deeply punctured all over, very sparingly covered with small greyish hairs, nearly obsolete on the back but more distinct below. It is less highly polished than the former.\n\n17.

It is easily distinguished from all other species of the Island, partly by this resemblance, partly by the sculpture of the thorax and the white fascia across the elytra. The antenn\u00e6 are robust, thickened towards the tip, the three last joints forming a club. The legs have the femora very much incrassated, the tibiae at the apex bicalcarate, and the tarsi, especially of the anterior pair, very hairy below, the fourth joint appears to be slightly cordiform. The white marks of the shoulders and the fascia across the wing-covers are composed of white hairs, the former are rather an interrupted row of these than true maculae, the fascia consists of two halves, one in either elytron, reaching neither the external margin nor the suture. The insect is of slow motion.\n\n18. Anthicus insulanus. N.\n\nA. testaceus, abdomine obscuriore, capite thoraceque rufo-testaceis, elytris fasciis 2 nigris, parce pilosus.

Those small individuals, which occur in the proportion of about 2 to 20, are, moreover, nearly always of a brownish metal color instead of a blackish green. I have been unable to discover any other distinctions. This difference in size is no criterion as to the sex. The insect appears of local occurrence or attached to certain plants, which is nearly the same. I find them in abundance in the blossoms of Convolvulaceous and Apocynaceous plants in my garden, which is situated on the west bank of the lake. The species appears to differ from the typical Meligethes in the following points: the structure of the mentum, which I have sufficiently described above, the last joint of the lab. palpi, which in this case is not truncated, and the first of the antenn\u00e6, which is externally incrassated as in Epuraea. The antenn\u00e6 are otherwise robust, the club is firm and hairy. The thorax is very ample, thinly ciliated along the upper part of the anterior margin, rather strongly below. The prosternum is largely developed, marginated, punctured and obtusely acuminated, overlapping the anterior part of the mesosternum which (the anterior part) is cylindric and carinated. Joints 1-3 of the tarsi are strongly penicillated below, the penicilla being composed of glandularious hairs of a fine golden color.\n\n20. GEORYSUS GEMMA.

Tibiae extus spinulos\u00e6, intus sparsim ciliatae,\nPrope Negombo in ripis Mah\u00e6-Oy\u00e6 fluvii non infrequenter et per occasionem nocti ad lumen cepi\n\nLacordaire and others characterize the g. Georyssus as having the elytra soldered together and being destitute of wings. In the present species, however, the elytra are unconnected and cover wings proportionately larger than in any other beetle I can at present think of. They are elongated and comparatively narrow, resembling in shape very much those of a Libellula, have a few veins at the base, and are ciliated at the margin. I have moreover occasionally taken this insect flying about the light at night. The sculpture of the thorax is complicated and difficult to describe. However, the leading features in it are these: a subapical sinuosity on either side; a longitudinal furrow; excavated sides, base and apex; three larger dorsal depressions (one central, two obliquely basal) and two smaller lateral ones at the subapical sinuosities\u2014a short elevated ridge at the centre of the base separating the two basal impressions and being itself divided by the longitudinal furrow; two elevations separating the anterior part of the basal impressions from that of the central one (at the middle these three depressions are connected); two small rugosities near the anterior margin, one on either side of the longitudinal furrow.\n\nThe sculpture of the elytra is less complicated. They have a deep cavity at the shoulder, a large but not deep sinuosity below the middle, and are obtusely acuminated. The cost\u00e6 of the back are 11 in number, the suture lying in the central one. The half of this central costa and the exterior margin form an elevated border round either elytron. The first and second on either side run towards the apex, but come to a stop (very abrupt in most, but less so in some specimens) before reaching it; the third, after having been interrupted near its base by the subhumeral cavity, runs on but does not reach as far as the former; the fourth does not leave the region of the shoulder; the last on either side is very prominent at the base, but soon forms an abrupt declivity and runs on as a low ridge to below the middle. The back of all these cost\u00e6 is obtusely dentated. The interstices are marked with large, shallow,\ntransverse impressions. The head of the insect is rather large and even. The mandibles are furnished with an obtuse subapical tooth, the two lower thirds are ciliated. The maxillae have the apex of the outer lobe externally enlarged, rounded off, and furnished with three strong teeth replaced by cilia on the inside; the inner lobe is conic and similarly provided with teeth and cilia, however, much thinner and finer. The maxill. palpi are robust, the last joint is inflated at the base. The antennal club is hairy, dark (whilst the remaining joints are yellowish), conic, and somewhat securiform, the sixth joint being inserted on one side of the seventh. The legs are robust, the tibiae slightly curved, obliquely truncated at the end, furnished with spines along the outside, and with distant cilia along the inner.\n\n21. HYDROCHUS LACOSTRIS.

Carina prostermalis cultriformis.\n\nSpecimen singulum f. nocte ad lumen cepi.\nAs far as my resources allow me to ascertain, a very anomalous species, having the perfoliated antennae and toothed claws of a Hydrophilus and the cultriform prosternal carina and the elytra of a Hydrous. I have placed it in the latter genus on account of the sharp edge of the prosternal carina, in which the great distinguishing character of this genus seems to lie, the same being deeply grooved in Hydrophilus. The insect attracts attention at once by the reddish color of its abdomen. It is of a blackish olive color on the back, having, however, the clypeus and the anterior margin of the labrum of a yellowish brown, the latter being otherwise of rather a metallic color. The remaining parts of the mouth are more or less yellowish. Joints 1-6 of the antennae are yellowish too, with the exception of the second which is dark; joints 7-9 are blackish and pubescent. The legs are of a light pitch color. The lower part of the head is impressed with two rather semicircular series of punctures, similar punctures occurring along the internal margin of the eyes. The thorax is marked with six series of them and on the elytra they are arranged in lines. The sternal carina is well developed, the prosternal part has a sharp edge, whilst the mesosternal one is obtuse on the back, and the metasternal part depressed and slightly grooved.\n\n23.

The prosternal carina has a sharp edge, the claws are simple, the antennal club is composed of rounded joints, the elytra are of the typical structure, &c. In the latter respect as well as with regard to the various series of punctures upon head, thorax and elytra, it resembles the former; the punctures of the elytra are, however, less distinct. Joints 1-6 of the antennae are yellowish,\nthe club being dark and finely pubescent. The maxill. palpi have joints 2 and 4 subcylindric, but the intermediate one thickened towards the tip.\n\nI have not seldom in the month of June taken the pup\u00e6 of this species on the banks of the Colombo lake and hatched them at home. I found them about one inch under ground and often as far as 12 feet from the edge of the water, but still in muddy places. The imago is very active, perhaps more so than any other species of the g.\n\nNo. III:\n\nGeneral Remarks on the Scydmaeni.\n\nIn the first number of these Papers, I have described a winged species of Edichirus, a g. supposed to be without organs of flight; in the second number I have given publicity to the more important discovery of wings in the single g. which forms the family of the Georyssi, also hitherto supposed to be apterous.\n\nAt present I am about to announce to some and to confirm to others the existence of these organs in the family of the Scydmaenidae, a fact, although incomplete, of more importance than either of the former, considering the extent of the family and the difference of opinion, which appears to exist on the subject amongst the most eminent Entomological authorities. It is this importance which induces me to enter more fully on the subject.\n\nI am not acquainted with the famous monograph of the family of the Scydmaenidae by Dr. Schaum. From the manner, however, in which it is quoted by Lacordaire, in his g. d. Ool. I should infer that these two celebrated authors agree in all the vital points. In Lacordaire's diagnosis of the family, these insects are described as having (with the exception of the American g. Brathinus, of which Lacordaire is not quite sure that it belongs to the family) the elytra soldered together, and being destitute of wings. Now, it is scarcely credible\nthat on a point so easily ascertained as this, any difference of opinion should exist; still, Westwood, in his \"Modern Classification of Insects,\" in describing the same family, makes statements which imply the contrary. However, Lacordaire's description, being by 15 years,\u2014more in fact,\u2014the most recent, is, from this reason alone, entitled to be considered before all others; and, looking upon it in this light, that is, as the essence of all former observations, I shall, for the present, occupy myself with it alone.\n\nAccording to this description, as mentioned above, the insects which it regards have the elytra soldered together, and are destitute of wings. This being the case, I was startled to find that, out of the thirteen species described below, nine or ten which I examined in this respect, had neither the elytra soldered, nor were they destitute of wings\u2014on the contrary the elytra were unconnected in the middle, and the wings were nearly double the size of the whole insect and could not possibly be overlooked. I would willingly suppose that the 100 species of this family contained in European collections, and principally derived from Europe and North America, agreed with Lacordaire's description, and that the Ceylon species were exceptions to the general rule, had not Westwood's observation, alluded to above, corroborated my own, thus rendering me suspicious of some unaccountable mistake or oversight somewhere or other. That this mistake cannot consist in a slip of the pen, or a misprint in the g. des Coleopt\u00e8res quoted above, is clear from the obvious care which has in every respect been bestowed upon this work, and from the same remarks being repeated in different words.\n\nWhere then this mistake is,\u2014upon what ground it rests\u2014it would, under my circumstances, be useless to attempt to unravel. However, it appears certain to me that some more detailed and positive remarks on the subject cannot be superfluous, and must be new to some entomologists.\n\nPlacing the fullest confidence, as every one would do without hesitation, in the infallibility of the description of the Belgian author, it was not likely that I should have looked for wings\nat all in the Seydm\u00e6nide (a family to which I have not, until lately, paid much attention) had I not been struck by seeing the elytra of my S. alatus open, when handling it with a fine painter's brush in a drop of water, it being at the time quite out of the question that the opening could have been effected by pressure. On opening the elytra fully, I had no difficulty in discovering the wings.\n\nRendered extremely curious by this discovery\u2014diametrically opposed to the distinct statement of so great an authority as the one just alluded to\u2014I now examined other species, and all with the same result, most of them opening the elytra without my assistance, in the same manner as S. alatus; and I have not the slightest doubt that, when a sufficient number of specimens will enable me to examine the rest, it will still be with the same result.\n\nThat these insects use their organs of flight may be gathered from the following. At a former period, I lived in a house situated on a small eminence and overlooking extensive groves of cocoanut trees, cinnamon gardens, paddy fields, and patches of jungle. Here I collected large numbers of Peelaphid\u00e6, especially Euplectus, in thin, scarcely visible, spider webs, with which the white walls of the house were covered in certain places\u2014thus forming one large trap for anything small flying about. That these had been caught here when on the wing there can be no doubt; but I was much surprised to find with them (what is so common in more congenial localities, here also,) a considerable number of Seydm\u00e6ni, especially my S. advolans and pubescens, as they were said by the most recent authority to be unable to fly, and the position they then found themselves in, was one they could not well, or would not possibly, have got into otherwise than by flying. From some reason or other, I am ashamed to say, I did not follow up the matter at the time; but I am now certain on the subject. Indeed, to remove all doubt and to settle all disputes, I have just been so fortunate as to take my S. advolans actually on the wing, flying in my garden in the evening at sunset.\nHaving gone so far, I will (in spite of some slight misgivings of being laughed at for telling an old story with so grave a face) add a few descriptive words about the organs in question. The wings of my *Scydmani* are ample, about double the size of the whole insect, oblong, having the margin beautifully ciliated, and, with the exception of a few yellowish veins at the base, without any visible organs of this kind.\n\nIn spite of the difference in their shape, etc., I believe the species described below to be all genuine *Scydmani* as restricted at present. Being, however, unacquainted with the sexual distinctions of these insects (which indeed I believe not to have been satisfactorily pointed out by any one, and to differ in different species), I should not be surprised if one or two of my species were eventually ascertained to have been separated upon these grounds alone. However, having been very reluctant in the admission of new species, it is just as likely that individuals may hereafter be found united in one which ought to be separated into two species. But I trust that neither may happen.\n\nThe species were all collected by myself in the immediate neighbourhood of Colombo. I have, however, no doubt that they occur all over the S. W. of the Island, which is of a uniform physical character, and perhaps occupy a still larger portion of it. Indeed, I have taken the *S. peelaphoides* in the hills, at an elevation of 3,500 feet, under the bark of trees. None of them are quite common; on the contrary, of nearly half of them I possess only one or two specimens. My *S. femoralis* I found under the soft, rotting bark of an *Brythrina Indica*: *S. Ceylanicus* and *ovatus*, I found dead in spiderwebs: *S. graminicola*, *glanduliferus* and *pyriformis*, I have hitherto exclusively taken in the sweeping net on the lawns of my garden about sunset: the other species I have met with indiscriminately in spiderwebs, under rotting vegetable substances, and in the grass.\n\nAfter this preamble, which I trust may not be deemed quite superfluous, I now enter upon the description of my species, drawing previously attention to the three very natural and\nvery distinct groups which they form, and the characteristics of which will at once be perceptible from the headings given below.\n\nWith regard to the first group (A. i. spec. 24-28) I may mention that the elongated legs, largely developed posterior trochanters, and often distinct posterior coxae, render the motions of the insects belonging to it staggering when walking, which together with their oblong, subdepressed body distinguishes them at a glance. I have subdivided them from the cultriform or grooved mesosternal carina.\n\nThe second group (A. ii. spec. 29-35) is equally well characterized as the former by the more robust, pyriform and subconvex body of the insects. *S. pselaphoides* in the former and *S. advolans* in the present group, form connecting links between the two; especially *S. pselaphoides*, which in general appearance rather belongs to the second, upon closer examination, however, is easily ascertained to be an anomalous member of the former.\n\nFrom the rounded or narrowed occiput I have divided the second group into two subdivisions, giving preference to the distinctions to be drawn from this part of the body to those to be derived from the thorax, which from the variety of shapes it assumes would naturally suggest itself for that purpose; but the gradations between the principal forms appear to me too many, five, and therefore too indistinct to adopt them.\n\nAs to the third group (B. spec. 36) the insect which alone forms it amongst those described below, is so different from any of the others that its peculiarities must strike any one at first sight.\n\n**A.**\n\nSpecies with a thick neck, abruptly formed and immersed in the thorax.\n\ni.\n\nFourth joint of the maxill. palpi not acuminated; head sub-quadrato-ovate; eyes middling or small, finely granulated,\nlittle or not at all prominent; antenn\u00e6 subapproximate at the base; posterior trochanters elongated, incrassated at the apex; thorax obovate; body elongate, subdepressed.\n\n(a.)\n\nMesosternal carina slight, simple.\n\n24. Scydmaenus alatus. N.\n\nS. dilute brunneus, pedibus antennisque dilutioribus, tarsis palpisque testaceis; pubescens. Long. corp. \u00a7 lin.\n\nAntenn\u00e6 art. 1\u00b0 apice bi-acuminato, 3-4 subaequalibus, 5 praecedente majore, 6 longitudine inter 4 et 5, ovato, 7-8 subaequalibus, 9 majore. 7-9 apice angustatis, tubiformibus, 10-11 ovatis, clavam formantibus, vel art. 9 globoso, 9-11 clavam formantibus. Palpi maxill. art. ultimo minimo apice truncato. Mandibulae dente bifido munites, basi fortiter abrupteque dilatae. Thorax foveis basalibus nullis. Pedes elongati.\n\nI include in this species individuals with a two, and others with a three, jointed antennal club. The latter are further distinguished by having a slight sinuosity in the rounded outline of the basal angles of the thorax: by having the posterior part of the metathorax and the base of the abdomen sensibly incrassated: and the head rather less quadratic than the former. However, the individuals thus distinguished being in all other respects exactly like those with the two-jointed club, I cannot help looking upon all these distinctions as sexual ones and uniting the insects in the same species.\n\nThe head from the eyes to the neck is of a transverse sub-quadratic form merging into the oval by the angles being rounded off; the anterior part is narrowed. And this is the typical sculpture of the skull in all the five species of this group. The eyes in the present species are middling. The antenn\u00e6 are rather approximated at the base, and inserted in the centre of the front under a ridge which runs across it from eye to eye. The first joint is biacuminated at the apex: the fifth is longer than the adjoining ones: joints 7-9 in the individuals with the two-jointed and 7-8 in those with the three-jointed club, are of a peculiar construction, being narrow-ed at the apex and fitting into each other like the tubes of\na spyglass. The club joints are ovate, flat at the base; the last is large and obtusely acuminated. I consider the principal distinguishing character to lie in the remarkable structure of joints 7-9 of the antenn\u00e6. The maxill. palpi have joint 2 rather strongly incrassated at the apex, joint 3 obovate, narrowed at the base, joint 4 very minute, truncated at the apex. The mandibles are furnished with a bifid tooth and are strongly and abruptly dilated at the base. The thorax is of an obovate or obcordato-ovate form, being rather strongly rounded off before the middle and gradually narrowed below it; the usual basal impressions are wanting, the posterior margin has two slight sinuosities, the posterior angles are rounded off or obliquely truncated. Scutellum obsolete. Elytra furnished with a very short elevated ridge at the shoulder. Legs elongated; coxae large, the two posterior ones rather distant from each other; two posterior trochanters much elongated, incrassated at the tip; apex of tibiae subcylindric, but not narrowed, and hairy, especially in the 2nd pair; joints 2-3 of the tarsi of equal size, the first longer, the 4th a little shorter; two anterior tarsi slightly contracted, 2nd and 3rd pair more and more elongated. Penultimate segment of abdomen with strong longitudinal groove on the back.\n\n25. Scydmaenus femoralis. N.\n\nS. statur\u00e6 et magnitudine praecedentis; testaceus. Antenn\u00e6 art. 3-4 sub\u00e6qualibus, 5 precedente longiore, 6-6 gradatim minoribus, subglobosis, 7-8 apice fortius oblique truncatis, 9-11 gradatim majoribus, subglobosis, clavam formantibus. Palpi maxill. art. ultimo minimo semigloboso. Thorax magnus obovatus, basi rotundatus, 4 foveolatus. Elytra apice truncata, 2-sinuata. Pedes femoribus 2 posticis medio constrictis.\n\nOf the general appearance of the former, but of a light yellowish colour, and well distinguished by the large thorax, truncated elytra, and abnormal construction of the 2 posterior femora. Antenn\u00e6 with joints 7-8 rather strongly obliquely truncated at the apex, 9-11 forming a club, subglobose, flat at the base, the last acuminated and slightly cut away or even excavated on the inside of the apex. Last joint of\nmaxill. palpi semiglobose, these otherwise the same as in the former. Thorax and elytra of S. alatus; the former, however, larger, rounded at the posterior margin, and with four basal impressions, the later slightly truncated at the apex and with slight sinuosity in the truncature on either side of the suture. Scutellum very small. Legs with the tibiae slightly bent at the base, the apex as in the former; tarsi with joints 1-4 gradually decreasing in size, first pair contracted and furnished with brushes on the inside. The two posterior legs inserted rather distant from each other, the basal part of abnormal construction; the trochanters much elongated and incrassated at the tip, whilst the femora at the place of the juncture rather abruptly narrowed, bent, and slightly compressed,\u2014they being, at the same time, thinner than the adjoining apex of the trochanter; the constriction very striking.\n\n26. SCYDM\u00c6NUS CHYLANICUS. N.\n\nS. alati colore, sed major et magis depressus; long. corp. 4 lin. Caput magnum, robustum, thoracis latitudine. Antenn\u00e6 basi non approximatae, art. 3-4 et 5-7 inter se sub\u00e6qualibus, arcum formantibus, 8-10 gradatim majoribus, subglobosis, depressis apice oblique truncatis, 11\u00b0 magno, conico, 8-11 longins pilosis, clavam formantibus.

Pedes validi tarsis 2 ant. art. 1\u00b0 subtus in spinam sat fortem producto\n\nAn anomalous species, especially with regard to the antenn\u00e6 which are much less approximated at the base than those of the rest of the species belonging to this group, and with regard to the two posterior coxae, which, on the contrary, are more approximated than in any of the species just referred to. The insect is of the light brown color of the two former, but larger and more depressed. The head is strikingly large and heavy, of the width of the thorax, in its hind part, which is strongly transverse, the oval form is prevailing over that of the square. Eyes small. Antenn\u00e6 inserted under two strong protuberances rather than under a ridge, their club four jointed, joints 3-7 forming an inwards-bent section of a circle, joints 8-10\nstrongly compressed, obliquely truncated (subperfoliated), 11 large, conic. The 3rd joint of the maxill. palpi is of an oblongo-ovato shape, the external basal angle is prolonged into a small peduncle inserted in the apex of the 2nd joint, the 4th joint, (about the semiglobose shape of which I am not quite satisfied), appears to be obliquely inserted in the tip of the preceding. Thorax oval, of a similar shape to that of the former, anterior margin slightly emarginated. Scutellum obsolete. Elytra with the traces of a humeral costa, separately rounded off at the apex. Legs strong, 2 posterior coxae not more distant from each other than the 4 anterior ones; tibiae elongated, bent at the base and apex, at the latter place slightly narrowed, subcylindric and hairy; tarsi with joints 1-4 subequal, in the first pair strongly contracted, joint 1 of this pair produced in a spine on the inside.\n\n(b)\n\nMesosternal carina middling, grooved.\n\n27.

Mesosternum sat fortiter carinatum carina dorso deplanata canaliculata, apice acuminata.\n\nThis species stands in the middle between S. alatus and pselaphoides. To the former it is allied by its general appearance rather than by anything else, differing from it very much in the structure of the antenn\u00e6 and the mesosternal carina. To the latter on the contrary it is allied by similarity in the structure of the said carina, differing, however, from it in general appearance. The color is that of S. alatus, but a shade or two darker, the insect being at the same time larger and altogether more robust. The eyes are small. Antenn\u00e6\nclub three-jointed, the joints forming it gradually increasing in size, obovate, flat at the base, the last acuminated. Scutellum obsolete. Elytra with two slight basal impressions, the trace of a humeral costa, separately rounded off at the apex. Legs elongated as usual; two posterior coxae distant, tibiae straight, subcylindrical, but not narrowed at the apex, the four anterior ones hairy; tarsi with joints 1-4 almost imperceptibly decreasing in size\u2014or perhaps 2-3 equal,\u2014the anterior ones slightly contracted: these and the intermediate ones hairy on the inside. Mesosternal carina middling, flat on the back with a shallow but very distinct longitudinal groove or excavation, anterior part projecting, acuminated.\n\n28. Soydm\u00e6nus Pselaphoides. N.\n\nS. subpyriformi-ovatus, subconvexus, magis minusve brunneus, pedibus antennique subtestaceis, femoribus apice nigrescentibus, tarsis palpisque testaceis; flavo-pubscens; long. 1\u00bd lin.\n\nAntenn\u00e6 art. 1\u00b0 medioceri, apice biacuminato, 2.4 sensim minoribus, 5 et 2, et 3, 7 et 10 inter se subaequalibus, 9.11 clavam formantibus, 6.11 basi transversim, 6-8 apice obliqu\u00e8 truncatis, 7-8 compressis. 9-11 obovata.

Thorax obovatus, latitudine quart\u00e0 parte longiore, basi 4 foveolatus. Elytra apice singulatim rotundata. Mesosternum praecedentis.\n\nAn anomalous species with regard to its general appearance which differs considerably from that of the rest of the group, and makes it, as I have remarked above, the connecting link between this and the following group. This is the largest species I have hitherto met with. The system of coloration is the usual one: more or less deep brown, legs and antenn\u00e6 lighter, tarsi and palpi quite so. Eyes middling. Antenn\u00e6 with a three-jointed club, the joints 6-8 are slightly truncated at the apex, 7 and 8 being at the same time strongly compressed have a subperfoliated appearance. The mandibles are furnished with a bifid tooth. The 3rd joint of the maxill. palpi is of the shape of an inverted cone, the 4th minute and truncated at the apex. The thorax is of an obovate form, about one quarter longer than broad, rounded off before and gradually narrowed below the middle, subquadratic at the base, impres-\nsed with four fove\u00e6 or pits, the posterior angles rounded off. Scutellum minute Elytra with two short humeral cost\u00e6, separately rounded off at the apex. Legs stout; two posterior coxae distant; tibiae slightly bent at the base, subcylindric at the apex, the four anterior ones hairy; tarsi with joints 1-4 gradually decreasing in size, the anterior ones dilated, the joints transversely triangular, the intermediate pair hairy on the inside. Mesosternum of the preceding. Metasternum with a slight longitudinal depression down the middle. Penultimate abdominal segment grooved on the back as in S. alatus. In the enlargement of the anterior tarsi lies, as in the other beetles, undoubtedly a sexual distinction, as it is not equally strong in all individuals.\n\nI may mention here that upon some of the individuals I found ticks (some g. allied to Ixodes but not a Gamassus) fastened, one of them having made a wound such as, supposing it to be inflicted at a corresponding place and on a proportionate scale, few animals of a higher order, would, I think, have survived. Still this little beetle appeared perfectly at its ease. The parasite alluded to had fastened itself right in the centre of the forehead, and the wound it had inflicted in this,\u2014one would imagine most dangerous place,\u2014was a deep hole or pit with a callous border. The latter led me to infer that the injury was an old one, and the tick being at the time fastened in it (and this so firmly that I had some difficulty in detaching it), I felt sure it had been in this position for months. The injury was observable under a slight magnifier, and I think to compare it to one inflicted by a rifle-ball would be greatly underrating its importance.\n\nii.\n\nFourth joint of the maxill. palpi acuminated; mesosternal carina strongly developed; eyes large, prominent, coarsely granulated; antenn\u00e6 distant at the base; 2 posterior trochanters simple; thorax variable; body robust, pyriform, sub-convex.\n\n(a)\n\nOcciput rounded.\n30. Scydmaeus advolans. N.\n\nS. long. corp. 4 lin. Antenn\u00e6 art. 3 et 4, 5 et 6 inter se subequalibus, obovatis, 7 majore, subgloboso, 8-10 subglobosis, basi transversim, apice oblique truncatis cum 11\u00b0 conico clavam formantibus. Palpi maxill. art. 3\u00b0 elongato, inverte conico, 4\u00b0 mediocris. Mandibulae tenues, medio acuminatae 1-dentatae, basi abrupte dilatatae. Thorax ovato-rotundatus, apice fortius angustatus, basi leviter 2-sinuatus, 5-foveolatus. Elytra apice singulatim rotundatae.\n\nThe insect is of brown color, the antenn\u00e6 lighter, the legs still more, and the tarsi and palpi quite so, the femora are dark towards the apex, the head, thorax and suture are occasionally of chestnut color. It is, as usual, pubescent. The sculpture of the head in this and the following species not, as in the preceding, based upon the oblong square or the oval, but rather upon the form of a ball, which, in a more or less compressed state, is always perceptible; in some instances it is narrowed on one side. In the present species the head is heavy and subglobose. The eyes are large, prominent and coarsely granulated. The antenn\u00e6 are inserted distant from each other under two protuberances of the anterior part of the forehead. The club is 4-jointed, the joints composing it being flat at the base, and, with the exception of the last, obliquely cut away at the apex, the last itself being conic. The maxill. palpi have joint 3 rather elongated and of the form of an inverted cone, joint 4 middling, acuminated. The thorax is of a rounded oval shape and rather strongly narrowed towards the apex. The scutellum is obsolete. The elytra have the usual rudimentary cost\u00e6 at the shoulders and are separately rounded off at the apex. The legs are middling, 2 posterior coxae inserted close together, trochanters all simple, tibiae slightly bent at the base, narrowed and subcylindric at the tip, the 4 anterior ones hairy, tarsi with joints 2-3 subequal, the first a little longer and the 4th shorter, the two anterior ones slightly contracted.\n\nI include in this species some individuals which slightly differ from the foregoing description, being more robust, covered more densely and with longer hair, especially on the\noccuput and thorax, with the latter rather obconico-ovate and the costae of the elytra more distant, and moreover occasionally of a chestnut color.\n\n30. SCYDMANUS PUBESCENS. N.\n\nS. praecedente gracilior; long. corp. \u00a7 lin.

Thorax conicus, latitudine hand longior, basi 4-foveolatus. Elytra et pedes praecedentis, tibiis tamen apice leviter arcuatis.\n\nLess robust than the former, and further distinguished from it by the 7th antennal joint, (the one preceding the club) which is of a strongly cylindric shape, by the minuteness of the last joint of the maxillary palpi, the obtuse and nearly obsolete tooth of the mandibles, the short-conical form of the thorax, and the tibiae which are slightly bent at the apex.\n\n31.

Thorax conicus latitudine parum longior, elytris fortiter applicatus, basi 2-sinuatus et 4-foveolatus. Pedes et elytra praecedentis, his tamen amplioribus.\n\nStrongly allied to the two preceding species, still very much smaller, more compact and covered with longer hair\u2014thus of rather a different appearance regardless of its size. From S. pubescens this species would principally differ in the shape of the 7th antennal joint, also in that of the first three club joints which are much more compressed and more hairy in S. pigm\u00e6us. The thorax of the latter is more firmly applied to the base of the elytra; the latter have a fuller, more robust appearance about them; the palpi are more slender, and the tooth of the mandibles is pointed. From S. advolans it would prin-\ncipally differ besides in the generalities mentioned above, in the shape of the thorax, and in some of the points in which it differs from *S. pubescens*.\n\n(b)\n\nOcciput narrowed.\n\n32. **SCYDM\u00c6NUS GLANDULIFERUS.

The occiput is slightly narrowed behind. The antennal club is composed of four joints, the first three of which are strongly compressed, the 4th being plump and of the shape of an acorn with its cup; all are strongly ciliated. The thorax is conic, firmly applied to the base of the elytra, as in the preceding species, depressed, and with two pits at the base posterior margin with two sinuosities. The shoulder ridges of the elytra are short, but rather strongly marked. The tibiae are narrowed, sub-cylindric and hairy at the apex. Joints 2-3 of the tarsi are subequal, the anterior pair more, the intermediate less, contracted.\n\n33. **SCYDM\u00c6NUS GRAMINICOLA N.**\n\n*S. gracilior; long. corp. 3 lin.

The former slightly narrowed\nbehind, the head thus of a somewhat rhomboid form. Antennal club composed of three joints, the first two of which are strongly globose, the last being acuminated and slightly cut away on one side at the apex. The mandibles are furnished with an acuminated tooth at the middle, bent at the apex, and, what is rather uncommon in this g., gradually enlarged towards the base. The thorax is obconic, rather longer than broad. The elytra are somewhat more stretched than usual in this group, the rudimentary humeral cost\u00e6 are rather prominent, they are separately rounded off at the apex. Tibi\u00e6, more or less elongated, slightly bent at the base and apex, at the latter place sub-cylindric and hairy. Tarsi with joints 2-3 subequal, first pair slightly contracted. A sexual distinction appears to be expressed in the length of the tibi\u00e6, which are less elongated in certain individuals, which are at the same time less robust than the others. The insect is easily distinguished by its general appearance.\n\n34. Scydmaenus pyriformis.

The occiput is slightly narrowed, the head altogether plump, heavy and transverse. The antennal club is composed of 3 subglobose joints the last of which is acuminated and slightly cut away on one side as in some of the preceding species. The thorax is obovate, broadest below the middle and gradually narrowed towards the apex. The elytra have the usual two shoulder-ridges and are rather strongly dehiscent at the\napex.

The head is large, heavy, and from the eyes to the neck strongly triangular; the occiput and thorax are covered with long hair, which adds much to the peculiar appearance of the insect. The antennae are thick and robust, the club four-jointed. The thorax is subquadratic at the base up to the middle and conic towards the apex. The punctures or pits at the base are four in number. The scutellum is small. The humeral costae are stronger developed than in any of the other species, and traceable to the middle of the elytra. The tibiae are nearly straight: subcylindric at the apex: the four anterior ones hairy. The tarsi have joints 2-4 nearly subequal.\n\nB.\n\nSpecies without a neck.\n\n36. Scydmaenus ovatus.

However, in other respects it differs materially\nfrom all the preceding species. The body is regularly oval, thorax and elytra convex, pubescent. The head is subquadratic-ovate the eyes rather small but prominent, the neck is altogether wanting. The antenn\u00e6 are at the base as distant from each other as they can be, being inserted below the eyes; the club is three-jointed; the joints increase gradually in size from the third to the eleventh. The maxill. palpi have the second joint slender, the third rather pear-shaped, the fourth minute and acuminate. The thorax is very ample, semiorbiculare, of the shape and nearly the size of the apical half of the elytra, the basal angles are acuminate and slightly envelope the shoulders, the posterior margin is prolonged in the middle, towards the scutellum the fove\u00e6 or basal impressions are two, and rather distant from each other.

However, I retain part of my description, as it notices some peculiarities of the insect, of which I find no mention made in any of the works within my reach. It was owing to these peculiarities, and Lacordaire's statement that the three known species were of yellowish and green colour, as well as to having no detailed description of the C. flex, that I described it as new.*\nin the color\u2014to say nothing of some other minor distinctions. The first three of these peculiarities\u2014too important not to have been noticed by Lacordaire or any other describer of the g. had they been aware of them\u2014add considerably to the characteristics which already constitute this g. one of the most remarkable of the extensive family of the Oarabid\u00e6.\n\nThe antenn\u00e6 are strong, stiff and short, reaching hardly beyond the base of the thorax: joint 1 is of middling size, 2 short, 3\u20134 are subequal, 5 rather shorter, 6\u201311 still shorter, subequal: joints 3-11 are strongly compressed and pubescent, but only on the narrow side. The tibiae are strongly bicalcarated at the apex, the inner spur being longer than the outer one. In all legs these spurs are slightly compressed and serrated along the two narrow sides. Joints 1-4 of the anterior male tarsi, are slightly dilated, the apex of the first, second, and third, being at the same time furnished each with two small white brushes, below fenced in by spines. In the intermed. tarsi of the male, the apical half of joint 1, and joints 2 and 3, are furnished on the inner side with strong brushes of reddish colour, bordered by rows of spines, the entire lower surface forming one thick brush, and not two, as in the anterior pair.\n\nRegarding the habits of these insects, one would feel inclined to suspect them to be of a semi-aquatic nature, that is, the insects to frequent the banks of rivers, or other damp places; and I know that some entomologists are under the impression, that their mode of living is that of the g. Oomphron. However, in my experience, the direct contrary is the case. They live in the driest, hottest, and sandiest places that can be found, where they burrow in the sand, exactly in the manner of the well-known g. of the Amaras. I have of late taken considerable numbers of them in the Cinnamon Gardens of Colombo, in holes made by the rooting up of weeds, into which they had run, and could not escape, the loose sand giving under them whenever they attempted to do so. When wishing to find them, I had to search the corners of these holes, where some leaves had usually collected, when I would sometimes\ndig up eight at a time, not seldom rather deep in the sand. They are quick of motion, and being thus pursued, immediately bury themselves in the sand.\n\nThe diagnosis as given by Lacordaire requires at all events to be entirely recast, and the g. to be removed from the tribe *Cratoceridae*, (one of the characteristics of which is the want of foot-brushes in the male) in which he has placed it.\n\n**III.

It is strongly triangular from the eyes to the tip of the mandibles, the forehead is impressed with two deep\nlongitudinal furrows; the eyes are large, rather oval and prominent; behind them the head is abruptly contracted into a thick neck. The antenn\u00e6 are long and thick, reaching nearly to the middle of the body, joints 1 and 11, 2-4, 5-10 are subequal among themselves, 5-11 oval, 1-4 subcylindric. The labrum is small, rather triangular, being narrowed at its base, it is emarginated in front with a slight angle in the middle of the emargination. The mandibles are long, straight, triangular, bent at the tip only, dentated below the middle, the one more so than the other. The maxill\u00e6 are thin and slender, gently bent outwards at the base and inwards at the apex, the outer lobe corresponding with the inner one in shape and strength. The palpi are robust, both the maxillary and labial ones have joint 4 elongated, thin and acuminated, in fact needle-shaped, firmly implanted in the preceding one, not loosely hinged to it. The maxillary ones have joints 3 and 2 robust, the former swollen on the inner, the latter on the outer side. In the labial ones joint 3 is still plumper than in the others, but differs in shape by being incrassated on the outer, instead of the inner side, the second joint being at the same time quite small and cylindric. The mentum is large and simple as above described. The ligula is small, oblong, very slightly narrowed and transversely cut away at the apex, the paragloss\u00e6 separate from its sides a little below the anterior corners, they are setiform and reach much beyond it. The whole organ is of membranaceous texture: having, however, a more substantial centre or back. The thorax and elytra are simple and sufficiently described above. I may add that the former is divided by a longitudinal furrow and that both are furnished with a narrow margin at the sides. The scutellum is very small, and the abdomen furnished with a short peduncle. The legs are weak, simple, and nearly equal, the anterior tibiae are deeply notched, the lower margin of the fourth tarsal joint of the same pair is furnished with a long thin spine, the apex of which fits in between the claws, as in Lyttaeum Steph. I have been unable to discover any foothashes or other sexual distinctions, in the specimens be-\nfore me and therefore conclude that accidentally they are all females.\n\nThe habits of the insect are those of the Bombidiae, in whose society it lives upon the banks of rivers, taking, like them, readily to its wings. I have found it occasionally in considerable numbers upon the sandy banks of the Mah\u00e1 Oya in the neighbourhood of Negombo close to the edge of the water.\n\nIV. Creagris, n. g. N.\nFam.

Distinguished in several respects, its most extraordinary character lies in the curious shape of the mentum. This is, however, easily described as large, of the shape of a horseshoe with a long, thin, very pointed tooth in the middle, the apical half of the sides (lobes) being at the same time gently dilated, the apex itself being obliquely cut away from the outer towards the inner side\u2014the inner angle being the most advanced, and slightly dentated at the edge thus formed. Or it may also be described as a fork with the outer teeth somewhat enlarged, truncated at the apex and so forth. The other parts of the mouth have not much to distinguish them, with the exception, however, of the labrum which attains a very extraordinary degree of development, occupying rather more than one third of the whole head, although the latter itself is large and heavy. It is of a suborbicular shape, very slightly produced in front into an obtuse angle, is vaulted, covers the mandibles, has two longitudinal impressions at the sides of the base and is highly polished. The head has two impressions in front of the eyes, is densely punctured and thinly pubescent, it is strongly but gradually contracted behind the eyes and formed into a short neck. The antenn\u00e6 are strong and reach a little beyond the shoulders, joints 1, 3 and 11, are of about equal length, middling, the former two subcylindric; joint 2 is small, rounded, 4-10 sub-equal and with 11 oval. The thorax is small, only half as large as the head, rather narrower, strongly transverse, nearly twice as broad as long, slightly emarginated in front, the anterior angles rounded, contracted below the middle, subquadratic and prolonged at the base, posterior angles depressed, longitudinally divided by a deep furrow. The elytra are striated, and, as the thorax, densely punctured and thinly pubescent. The legs are strong, simple, and subequal, the anterior tibi\u00e6 are deeply notched, the first joint of the tarsi is as long as the two succeeding ones together, subcylindric, the second triangular, the third of a similar but more transverse form, smaller; all three have the apical angles\nacuminated, the fourth is large and deeply bilobed, the fifth middling, thin, the claws simple. The tarsi are altogether short and strong, the first joint is furnished with longer, the second and third with shorter stiff hair, whilst the fourth is strongly penicillated below. The anterior tibiae are slightly spinose, the others more so.\n\nThe legs in all my specimens are exactly the same, and I hardly know whether they are males or females. The insect has a peculiar, rather strong smell about it, resembling that of soap.\n\nV. HETEROGLOSSA, n. g. N.\nFam. CARABID\u00c6.\nTrib.

At the base of the emargination it is furnished with a broad, excavated tooth, which is inflected and obtuse at the apex. So far all three species agree. However, whilst in *H. elegans* and *ruficollis*, this tooth is slightly emarginated at the apex, it is sharply notched in *H. bimaculata*\u2014in fact bilobed, the lobes being large and rounded at the apex. I look upon this notch, which is sharp but not deep, as a mere variation from the emargination existing at the apex of the tooth of the two former species.\n\n3) The palpi\u2014labial as well as maxillary have their terminal joint truncated at the apex\u2014and so far again all three species agree. However, whilst this joint is of elliptic form in the palpi of *H. ruficollis*, it is in *H. elegans* only so in the labial ones, that of the maxillary ones being cylindric at the base. In *H. bimaculata* finally, this joint is rather clubshaped or subtriangular and more strongly truncated than in the two former species.\n\n4) The ligula\u2014is of subcoriaceous texture, middling size, the shape of an oblong square, free and transversely truncated at the apex. These characters are common to all three species and in *H. ruficollis* I have nothing to add to it. However, the anterior margin, which is straight in this species, is slightly bisinuated in *H. elegans*, the outer angles being acute and the central one obtuse. The ligula of *H. bimaculata* differs from both the former in as far as it is narrowed towards the apex and depressed towards the sides and the blunt, the anterior margin is otherwise cut away straight, without any sinuosities, but it is rather strongly armed with\nbristles. The paraglossae agree in all three species in as far as they are highly developed, reach much beyond the anterior margin of the ligula and are more or less bent inwards. Their greatest development they assume in *H. elegans*, in which they nearly touch each other in front of the anterior margin, being cylindric and slender at the same time. In *H. ruficollis* the paraglossae are somewhat shorter and straighter, and in *H. bimaculata* still more so.\n\nOn all other points the three species perfectly agree; in saying which I lay particular weight upon the unusual sculpture of the elytra, and the rather peculiar hairy vesture of the insects, bearing also in mind their general appearance, proportions, system of coloration, mode of living, etc. As to the hairy vesture of certain parts of the body and the sculpture of the elytra, it is true that these are not generally looked upon as of much importance; however, they appear to me so in this instance, as they present certain unusual variations, repeated in all three species. The hairy vesture consists in thin yellowish or reddish hairs, thinly seminated over the back, and still more thinly over the whole of the lower surface of the insects, being at the same time longer at the latter place. This vesture acquires its greatest density on the legs, especially the tibiae and tarsi, whilst their uniform presence at the palpi forms almost a generic character. The elytra are exquisitely sculptured into about eight larger costae on either of them and into two smaller ones between every two of these; the furrows thus formed are finely transversely rugose and\u2014with the exception of the central furrow between every two larger costae\u2014thinly pubescent.\n\n39. **Heteroglossa elegans.

The head is less distinctly punctured than in the former, and there is an additional impression in the middle of the forehead. The thorax is also less deeply punctured, but the divisional furrow is more so than in the preceding species. The anterior tibiae appear somewhat less deeply notched. There is nothing else to add to the description that has not been pointed out already.\n\n41. Heteroglossa bimaculata.

I have often handled the other two species but observed nothing of the kind.\n\n---\n\nNo. V.\n\nThe Trigonotomidae with an elliptic terminal joint of the palpi are abundantly represented amongst the Ceylon Carabidae, thus making amends for the want of other tribes of the section to which they belong. I have now before me a great many individuals of different species which I have endeavoured to distribute into genera after the works of Lacordaire, Dejean and others of less importance.\n\nA single glance almost convinced me that they must belong either to Abacetus, Distrigus, or Drimostoma\u2014genera closely allied, and whose principal, (in fact only essential), distinction would appear to reside in the shape of the mentum-tooth. If it is a well established fact, which cannot be doubted, from the above authors, that this tooth is pointed in Drimostoma,\u2014large, rounded, equalling the lateral lobes in Abacetus,\u2014and large and truncated in Distrigus,\u2014the species described below could not, as to their genera, be distributed otherwise than I have done, namely, five Distrigi and one Drimostoma. The species which I have drawn to the former genus have a large, more or less square tooth, slightly rounded at the anterior angles. It is impossible to call this tooth of the five species pointed in any way; they cannot therefore belong to the genus Drimostoma; nor can any of them be drawn to Abacetus, which genus is moreover apparently exclusively African. As to the insect which I\n\n*Barysomus Gyllenhali Dej.* A gross oversight of the vesture of the anter. male tarsi and some incorrect information regarding the insect I received from Europe led me into the error of describing it as new in the first edition of these papers. However, having since examined it more closely, I may mention here that joints 2-4 only of the anterior male tarsi are furnished with squamules below, and not joints 1-4, as stated by other authors.\nhave placed in the genus *Drimostoma*, its mentum-tooth is not exactly pointed, but it is altogether narrower than in *Distrigus* and might well be called \"asses aigu\u00e9,\" as Dejean describes it. This insect differs, moreover, very materially in general appearance as well as in its details from my *Distrigus*; and I feel sure that it belongs to the genus in which I have placed it, although it does not quite agree with Lacordaire's description\u2014the labrum being emarginated in front, the second joint of the maxill. palpi exhibiting nothing unusual, &c. As to the species which I have established, I feel very certain that they are new and good ones, as it would appear from the quotations in Lacordaire \"Gen. d. Col.\" that since Dejean's descriptions no new ones of Indian species have been published.\n\nThese insects live in the manner of the European *Feronidae*, but appear to affect rather damp localities, some of them take freely to their wings and fly commonly into houses in the evenings during the rainy weather.\n\n42. **DISTRIGUS COSTATUS.

However, if the description given in the Spec. gen. embraces all the characteristics of this latter species mine is undoubtedly different from it. Dejean says nothing about the cost\u00e6 on the\nback of the tarsi which are the principal characteristics in my species, nor are such costae of general occurrence or of so little importance that it could be supposed they had been left unnoticed by Dejean from these reasons. I cannot possibly call the thorax of my *D. costatus* \"subquadrato;\" it is rounded at the sides, narrowed behind, and cut away at the base. The stri\u00e6 of the elytra of my species are not punctured in the bottom, as those of the *D. impressicollis* are stated to be. In mentioning the inter-antennal impressions Dejean would certainly not have overlooked the depression in the centre of the forehead nor that of the clypeus, which distinguish my insect, had they existed in the one he described. The former is round; the latter transverse. I further fail to discover in my species the \"reflet un peu changeant\" of the elytra, and that the base of the thorax is \"assez fortement ponctu\u00e9e et que les points se confondent souvent ensemble;\" nor do I consider the interstices of the elytra \"relev\u00e9s, presque arrondis,\" or the head \"un peu r\u00e9tr\u00e9cie post\u00e9rieurement;\" the skull is of the same breadth from the antenn\u00e6 to the occiput.\n\n43. **DISTRIGUS SUBMETALLICUS.

Head large, very narrow and prolonged behind, much more so than in *O. cyanocephala*, with two large shallow impressions between the antenn\u00e6, and another small one just above them. Occiput slightly transversely rugose. Thorax very slender, half as broad as the head, of hardly the same length, obconic, constricted below the apex, then gradually increasing in size to below the middle, the base abruptly narrowed, cylindric and impressed with three deep annuliform wrinkles. Elytra about as long as thorax and occiput together, increasing very sensibly in breadth to below the middle. The apex is much more obliquely cut away than in *O. cyanocephala* or the preceding species. The shoulders are full and hide the margin. Just below them the elytra are deeply excavated; showing, moreover, three deep longitudinal impressions in the bottom of either excavation and a slight yellowish spot, hardly to be distinguished, at the outer part of it. A round spot of silvery appearance adorns the hind part of either elytron. There are two rows of long thin hairs, placed at considerable distances from each other, on the back of either elytron and a third just within the margin; the same thin hairs are scattered about the thorax, femora, and elsewhere. The legs are longer and more slender than in *O. cyanocephala*.\n\nThe *Ophionia cyanocephala* is not scarce in this part of the Island. It affects rather damp, grassy localities, where it mounts upon the stalks of the plants, as Helfer has observed of some species in Bengal, but quite different from the observations Lacordaire has made with regard to the American species of the genus. However, it is much more frequently taken about the light at night. The two species just described are much scarcer. Mr. C. A. Dohrn of Stettin writes to me that he has received another species from me (*Cypris D.*) which, however, I do not recollect. It would appear to be smaller than either of the former, black, with white tips to the antenn\u00e6.\nVI. SYMPHYUS, n. g. N.\nFam. CARABID\u00c6.\nTrib.

Decembr. nocte ad lumen cepi.\n\nThis description is made from a single female individual, but I have little doubt that the insect belongs to the numerous tribe to which I have referred it; in which it ought perhaps to be placed near Eccoptogenius Chaud. I am, however, not sure whether the shape of its ligula does not entitle it to a place amongst the Anchonoderidae. I may add to the above description that the accessory stria of the elytra is present, but that the puncture usually found upon the third interstice is wanting. The general appearance of the insect presents nothing whatever particular. However, upon further inspection\nthe deeply notched labrum and the strong porrected mandibles are very striking. The labrum appears to me of extraordinary construction; the mentum is large and of semicircular shape, deeply emarginated, which renders the lobes heavy, rounded outside, and pointed at the tip. In the bottom of this emargination stands a pointed, spinelike tooth, as long as the lobes. This tooth is deeply excavated or grooved and is clearly seen to be to its full length soldered together with the basal part of the ligula. Probably the entire mentum is in this manner connected with the adjoining part of the ligula; but in the other parts it is not so clearly observable as in the tooth, and I have not dissected the labrum. The ligula itself is of a leathery consistence, of the shape of an elongated inverted triangle with an elevated back, the anterior margin is straight and somewhat prolonged beyond what would be the sides of the triangle. The paraglossae are of membranaceous texture, very broad, adhering to the sides of the ligula to its full length, taking then a slender, cylindric form and reaching considerably beyond it, being at the same time slightly bent inwards.\n\nVII.

Nov. et Decemb. prope Colombo nocte ad lumen cepi.\n\nVery pretty insects apparently closely allied to the African genus Bradybaenus Dej. from which, however, they differ in the structure of the ligula and in other minor points. They are quite of the shape of a Harpalus, and I have no doubt that their habits are those of the latter. Joints 4\u201411 of the antenn\u00e6 have very much the appearance of grains of rice strung together. The metallic green color with which the insect is adorned on the back is very rich; on the elytra it forms a pattern of two triangles with their tips down, that of the upper one being immersed in the base of the lower one, and the apex of the latter being divided. These triangles are flanked on either side by a broad longitudinal belt of yellowish color. The margin is again green with the exception of the apex which is occupied by the yellowish belt. The thorax is green in the centre and yellowish along the sides. The head is more or less brownish-green, lighter in the middle; the mouth is brown.\n\n52. Zophium pubescens. N.\n\nZ. rufo-testaceum, oculis nigris, occipite nigrescente, elytris pubescentibus fuscis maculis 2 subhumeralibus, 1 apicali communi testaceis ornatis; long. corp. 3\u00bd lin.\n\nAntennis art. 1\u00b0 capitis vix longitudine; labro integro; palpis art. ultimo trigono; menti dente magno obtuso, profunde canaliculato; thorace elongato-cordato, capitis latitudine, illo parum-, latitudine duplo longiore, medio leviter longitudinaliter depresso; elytris subtilissime dense pubescentibus, obsolete striato-impressis, humbris obsoletis.\n\nSpecimina nonnulla in prov. occid. nocte ad lumen cepi.\nThis description does not quite agree with Lacordaire's diagnosis of the genus *Zophium*. The labrum, the tooth of the mentum are not what they ought to be according to this author. However, Schmidt-Goebel in his \"Col. Birm.\" has already departed from Lacordaire's formula by describing six species of *Zophia* with an entire mentum-tooth, which, according to the former author, would make them *Polystichi* rather. The fact is, that this part of the labrum appears to be variable. In all other respects the insect agrees with Lacordaire's description of the genus.\n\nThe labrum is entire; the first antennal joint is hardly as long as the head, slightly curved and increasing in thickness towards the tip, the second joint is very small and rounded, the rest are subequal, filiform; the tooth of the mentum is very large, almost equalling the lobes, entire and deeply grooved at the apex; the maxill. palpi are porrected, the second joint is as long as the two following together, the fourth, in both the maxill. and labial ones, is triangular or slightly secuiform, being obliquely truncated at the tip; the thorax is elongated cordiform, truncated at the base, the back is elevated, divided down the middle by an impression, the commencement of the elevation forms two knobs at the base; the first tarsal joint is as long as the three following together.\n\nAmongst the 300 species of *Bembidiidae* which have been described from almost all parts of the world, with the exception of Australia, it would appear there are also none from Southern Asia. However, since the publication of Lacordaire's \"G. d. Col.\" (1854), in which this statement occurs, various species must have found their way into the Prussian cabinets with my collections from Bengal and this Island.\n\nIn the former country the *Carabidae* are very abundantly represented, and I recollect with pleasure the great variety of them, from the gigantic *Anthia* down to the smallest *Bembidium*, the banks and the sands of the Ganges used to furnish me when leisurely travelling upon this river some years ago,\nfrom August to October, just after the rains. Nowhere have I seen, nor do I expect to see, such swarms of Cicindela. Their buzzing flight when disturbed was heard like that of bees. It appeared to me that they did not quit the sands, their favourite haunts, when the tide rose, but allowed themselves to be covered over by the water, as other semiaquatic beetles do. Without especially hunting for them, I brought away with me some ten species, mostly new, and amongst the rest of the Carabidae as many Bembidia.\n\nIn this Island, both in the hills and the plains, there is not a bank of a pond, lake or river, which has not, as in more northern latitudes, its Bembidia, and, contrary to what one would expect, they appear to be more common in the hot low country than in the cool hill region.\n\nThe majority of the species described below may any day be found upon the banks of the Colombo lakes. None of the species, (which, as I said, must have found their way with my collections to Berlin and Stettin, and thence perhaps elsewhere,) have, to my knowledge, been described. The descriptions given below, must, therefore, I am fain to believe, be an interesting addition to the literature of this section of the Carabidae, however inferior they may be to what they might have been had they been produced in Europe had the insects been collated with allied typical species. I have none of those typical representatives of the genus at hand nor is my recollection of them sufficiently distinct to permit of my drawing comparisons between them and the Ceylon insects now before me. Nevertheless, I hope I have set forth the peculiarities of my species with sufficient precision to distinguish them from, or identify them with, any other Cis-Himalayan species that may hereafter be described. As hopeless confusion appears to exist amongst the sub-genera, into which the original genus has been broken up, I have not attempted to refer my species to any of them, for fear of thereby doing anything but throwing additional light on the subject. There is no doubt that many more species exist in this Island, and that indeed, as in the case of the Sta-\nphylinidae, they will eventually be found to be quite as abundantly represented within the tropics as without. Nothing but their smallness has hitherto prevented their discovery.\n\n53. Bambidium opulentum. N.\n\nB. oblongum, subconvexum, nebuloso-aeneum purpureo-micans, elytris apice sordide testaceis, subtus nigro-piceum, pedibus antennarumque basi testaceis, ore brunneo; long. corp. 1\u00bd\u20142 lin.\n\nCapite inter oculos 2-sulcato, oculis magnis prominulis, labro fortiter transverso, brevi, integro, mandibulis porrectis, antennis art. 2\u00b0 sequentibus parum breviori; thorace transversim cordato antice posticeoque truncato, haud emarginato, depresso, margine basique elevato, medio capite parum latiore, apicem versus modice\u2014, basin versus fortius abrupteque angustato, angulis basalibus fortiter truncatis profundeque foveolatis, linea longitud. media abbreviata diviso; elytris ovatis humeris obsoletis, profunde striate punctatis, punctis apicem versus obsoletis, ante et infra medio utrinque foveolatis, apice lunula magna sordide testacea. Mas latet.\n\nPrope Negombo in ripis Maha-Oye, fluvii, specimen nonnulla cepi.\n\nThe insect is of bronze color, a purple reflect appearing on the back in irregular patches as the light may fall upon it. The palpi and the base of the antennae are of yellowish color, the apex of the third joint of the maxill. palpi, however, as well as that of the second, third and fourth antennal joint is brown, of which color is also the remaining part of the antennae. The second antennal joint is the shortest, the third and fourth are rather longer than the following. The mandibles are rather straight and porrected. The sides of the thorax are almost angular and furnished with a setigerous puncture at the broadest part, that is, just before the middle. There are seven distinct rows of punctures on either elytron and an accessory one along the side of the scutellum, the rows decreasing in length towards the margin and the punctures in depth towards the apex, the first row on either side; changing however, before the apex into a furrow which falls in with that which separates the margin from the rest of the elytron. Before and beyond the middle, in the region of the third row of punctures, is an excavation containing a puncture which is situated upon the third interstice. The excavation nearest the base is the deepest. The apex of the elytra is marked with a spot of\ndirty yellowish color prolonged on either side along the margin, which is here rather broad.\n\nIf my memory serves me right, the insect resembles the *Tachypus flavipes*.\n\n54. **Bembidium truncatum. N.**\n\n*B. oblongum, valde depressum, brunneo-testaceum, oculis nigris, pedibus, antennis palpisque pallide testaceis; long. corp. 1\u00bd lin.*\n\nCapite magno, thorace quarta parte prope minore, inter antenas 2-foveolato, oculis mediocribus, antennis art. 3\u00b0 reliquis minore, 4-11 subaequalibus fortius ovatis; thorace breviter cordato, antice posticeque truncato, haud emarginato, basi subquadrato parum prolongato, foveis basalibus obsolete sed linea basali latitud. profunda lineaque longitad. med. distinctis; elytris oblongis apice transversim truncatis, juxta suturam utrinque obsolete 1-striatis, ante et infra med. puncto impressis.\n\nIn prov. occid. rarius.\n\nThe small size, large head and truncated elytra effectually distinguish this species. The truncated posterior angles of the thorax and the general appearance induce me to consider it allied to the preceding species, at all events to approach nearer to it than to any of the following species. The eyes are rather small for this genus. There are no traces of striae on the elytra with the exception of one indistinct one along the suture.\n\n55. **Bembidium tropicum. N.**\n\n*B. oblongum, depressum, brunneo-testaceum capite brunneo, elytris dorso nigris cyaneo-micantibus, pedibus, antennis palpisque testaceis; long. corp. 1\u00bd lin.*\n\nCapite inter oculos 2-fovelato-sulcato, oculis mediocribus, antennis fortius filiformibus art. 3\u00b0 reliquis breviore; thorace breviter transversim cordato antice posticeque truncato, haud emarginato, basi subquadrato angulis basali elevatis sed haud foveolatis, linea latitud. basali profunda, infra lineam strigoso, linea media longit. diviso; elytris oblongo-ovatis utrinque juxta suturam 4-striatis, striis externis et his apicem versus obsolete, in striis punctatis, infra marginem stria profunda abbreviata, ante medium et apicem in interstitio 4\u00b0 puncto magno impressis, punctis anteapicalibus piliferis in sulcum ad apicem prolongatis semicirculum formantibus; tarsi 4 anterioribus art. 4\u00b0 subtus apice spinis squamulaccis 2 instructo.\n\nIn prov. occid. copiosum.\nOf light brown color, the head darker, the elytra blackish on the back with a slight blue reflect, the base, sides and apex brownish; the colors being more or less washed into each other no distinct pattern is observable. The brown spot of the apex, however, is generally pretty clearly set off from the adjoining dark part. The paraglossae are hardly longer than the ligula which itself is rather large. The antennae are rather hairy and strongly filiform, (not, as in most other species, increasing in thickness towards the apex, the joints growing at the same time more and more oval); joint 3 is the shortest, 2 and 4 are rather longer than the other. The back is impressed with three to four distinct striae on either side of the suture, the external ones being obsolete as are also the remaining ones towards the apex. There is an additional deep stria within the marginal one, extending from the middle to the apex. Before the middle, and before the apex, there is a puncture situated upon the fourth interstice; the antepical one of these has a hair in the centre and is prolonged to the apical angle in the shape of a deep, curved, furrow. This being the case on either side, the two furrows together form a semicircular figure. The tarsi are each furnished with bristles, especially at the lower margin of the apex of the joints. In the four anterior tarsi joint 4 is furnished at that place with two long bristles the apex of which fits in at the base of the claws. These bristles partake somewhat of the nature of squamulae by being dilated in the shape of a lancet. I have noticed them occasionally to be bifid at the apex, but I do not think that they are so always.\n\n56. Bembidium triangulare.

The insect is, moreover, more common than the former. The prevailing color of the elytra is not, as in the preceding species, black, but it is that of the rest of the body, yellowish, with merely a black suture and black belt across the middle; the edges of this belt are washed together with the color of the adjoining parts. The semicircular impression at the apex of the elytra is the same as in the former, and forms with the abbreviated inframarginal stria, (which is also the same,) a triangular figure, tip down, base open, whence I have derived the name.

The elytra, moreover, shew only three distinct striae on either side of the suture, two more, however, being just traceable. They are obsolete at the base, apex and towards the margin. Within the latter there is an additional deep stria, entire, and not, as in the preceding two species, only from the middle to the apex. The semicircular impression of the apex, however, is the same, so are the tarsi, etc.\n58. Bembidium. Klugii.

Its robust, ovate, convex shape places it at once in\na different division from any of the former. It is of bronze\ncolor with two orange colored spots behind; the mouth is brown\nwith the exception of the palpi, which, together with joints 1\nand 2 of the antenn\u00e6, are yellowish, joint 3 of the maxill. palpi;\nhowever, is of the general color of the mouth. The labrum\nis square and entire, the second antennal joint is rather shorter\nthan the rest. The thorax is transversely ovate, that is to\nsay, its greatest width is at the middle, not as in a cordate\nthorax, before it, the fove\u00e6 are connected by a series of punc-\ntures which gradually deepen towards the centre, the longitudi-\nnal line is also deeper at the apical extremity than at\nthe other parts. The elytra are impressed with seven deep fur-\nrows on either side deeply punctured at the bottom. These\nfurrows decrease in length towards the margin and in depth\ntowards the apex, with the exception, however, of the first\non either side, which go straight down to the apex. At the\nlatter comparatively smooth place is the semicircular impres-\nsion noticed in the three preceding, and to be noticed in all the\nfollowing species. The base of the elytra is smooth. There,\nare no traces of punctures, such as are usual in the region of the third or fourth interstice, observable. The lower side of the insect is of pitch color, the basal part of the legs and the thighs are lighter and the tibiae and tarsi quite light.\n\n59. BEMBIDIUM EBENINUM. N.\n\nB. ovatum, convexum, nigrum elytris ante apicem maculis 2 rufo-flavis; subtus piceum, pedibus palpis antennae testaceis, his apicem versus obscurioribus, reliquis oris partibus brunneis; long. corp. 1\u00bd lin.\n\nPr\u00e6cedenti affinis, ejus capite et thorace, facillime tamen distinguendum pr\u00e6ter colorem antennis fortius filiformibus, elytris levibus juxta suturam utrinque 2-striatis, striis basi abbreviatis, externa apicem versus obsoleta, ante et infra medium leviter foveolatis, ante apicem macula ovata rufo-flava, infra marginem stria profunda apiceque semicirculariter impressis.\n\nIn prov. occid. non rarum.\n\nVery closely allied to the former and equally pretty. Head and thorax entirely those of the former, the antenn\u00e6, however, are more filiform and the divisional line of the thorax is not deepened at the apical extremity. The elytra are smooth, with only two striae along the suture on either side, the rest not being even traceable. Both these striae are abbreviated at the base and the outer one becomes obsolete towards the apex; the inner one, however, goes fully down to the apex, and falls in with a deep inframarginal furrow which is wanting in the preceding species. Before and beyond the middle is a small impression, before the apex are two oval spots of orange color; the apex has the semicircular impression noticed in the preceding species.\n\n60.

The head is quite that of B. Klugii. The antennae have the second joint hardly shorter than the third and this and the following subequal, joints 1-4, are of light yellowish, the rest of brown color, joint 3 of the maxill. palpi is of dark, the remaining ones and the labial palpi of pale yellowish, color. The labrum is square, entire, and, with the rest of the mouth, brown. The mandibles are furnished with 3-4 small teeth below the middle. The ligula is broader than in any of the other species. The thorax, besides in shape, is distinguished by having the foveae removed from the basal angles towards the centre. The elytra are impressed with seven distinct striae on either side, the first of which runs down to the apex where it falls in with the inframarginal one, the rest decrease in length towards the margin and in depth towards the apex, beyond the seventh another one is just traceable, beyond this there is a deep inframarginal one. The apex is impressed with the semicircular figure which distinguishes all the species here enumerated, with the exception of B. opulentum and truncatum. The color of the insect is a dark bright metallic green variegated with four large yellow spots on the elytra; two of these are near the shoulder and of oval shape, the other two near the apex and oblique; the apex is of a dirty yellowish-color. The lower part of the insect is of pitch color, lighter towards the apex, the legs are yellowish, darker towards the base.\n\n61. BEMBIDIUM EMARGINATUM.

In prov. occid. raram.\n\nThis and the two remaining species are allied to each other, and probably belong to the subgenus Lopha. However, I am less sure of this with regard to the present species than with regard to the two following.\n\nThe head is pointed in front, and the labrum\u2014an unusual occurrence\u2014deeply notched. Two deep furrows run from the clypeus straight across the forehead to the vertex, and from their base other smaller ones radiate towards the eyes. Joints 2-5 of the antenn\u00e6, which, in almost all cases, are of unequal length, are not so in the present; the first two or three joints are yellowish, the rest are brown. Joint 3 of the maxill\u00e6 palpi is dark, the remaining ones and the labial palpi yellowish. The elytra are impressed with two stri\u00e6 on either side of the suture, the remaining ones are just traceable. The one next to the suture goes straight down to the apex, where it falls in with a deep inframarginal furrow; the second is as usual; abbreviated. The apex is impressed with the semicircular figure, and there are two punctures on either side.\n\n62. BEMBIDIUM ORNATUM.

Col. the paragloss\u00e6 of Amblystomus are simply said to be rounded in front, a further distinction would appear to reside in the notch which exists in that part of the paragloss\u00e6 of my genus Megaristerus. Also allied to Acupalpus the sculpture of the tarai being exactly the same; in saying which I bear particularly in mind that the intermediate ones of the male are hardly dilated. From this genus however, it is effectually dis-\ntinguished by the shape of the ligula. From both *Amblystomus* and *Acupalpus*, the present genus moreover differs in the vestures of the four ant. tarsi of the male, the first joint being naked below and in the mandibles, the left one of which is much larger and plumper than the right one, protruding from under the labrum, whilst the latter is hidden by it, the former is at the same time obtuse at the apex whilst the latter is pointed. In the *M. Indicus* this peculiar construction is hardly striking, but in the other two species it is very noticeable, and imparts a curious appearance to the head of the insect.\n\n64. **MEGARISTERUS MANDIBULARIS.

The mentum and palpi appear to agree entirely. The insects differ, however, in the structure of the ligula (which in Spathinus is entirely that of a Bembidium), and the sculpture and vesture of the ant. male tarsi. In spite of the latter anomalies, the preeminently characteristic shape of the palpi convinces me that the insect must find a place where I have put it. It is also closely allied to my genus Ochthepilus, differing from it, however, in the ligula, palpi and labrum. The generic name \"Spathinus\" signifies 'a staggard,' and I have chosen it with regard to the shape of the terminal joint of the palpi. The insects are common throughout the South-West and West of the Island, where they live in the manner of the Bembidia, under decaying vegetable matter, upon the banks of lakes, and rivers, &c.\n67.

Its favourite haunt, however, appears to be the former description of locality. It would appear to be very distinct from the E. Cyanipennis described by Schmidt-Goebel in his \"Col. Birm.\" in thorax, sculpture of apical part, and position of punctures of clytra, costated four post. tarsi, &c. On the other hand the curious depression of the elytra, which has much the appearance of being accidental, is the same. It occurs also in my genus Anchista. I am not quite satisfied with the description of the ligula and tarsi as given by Schmidt-Goebel. The former I should call \"truncated at the apex, anterior\nangles strongly rounded off.\" In the insect before me it is certainly not rounded in the middle: if anything, it is rather the contrary. The tarsi I should describe thus:\u2014\"Joints 1\u20144 of two ant. male tarsi dilated; joint 1 nearly as long as the two following together, sub-cylindric; joint 2 nearly as long again as the following, elongate-trigone; joint 3 sub-trigone; joint 4 (in all tarsi) bilobed; joints 1-3 furnished below with two series of lamellated papill\u00e6 fenced in by bristles; joint 4 densely penicillated; claws simple.\"\n\nI take this opportunity to add a general remark. The author above quoted at the end of the description of his *E. Cyani-pennis*, quotes a passage from Helfer's Burmese Journal, implying that the species lived exclusively upon trees, and that most of the Carabidae of that country had the same habit. The latter part of this observation I feel inclined to look upon as a rash and unjustifiable assertion on the part of Helfer. There can be little doubt (and the above is an additional example) that the Carabidae of this Island have much resemblance to those of Burma. Still my long experience in it has not furnished me with any instances of any of them living upon trees, with the exception of the Tricondylae, Collyres and certain Cicindelae. The Casnoniae and Ophioneae are in the habit of ascending grasses and low herbs, and certain Lebiidae and genus Catascopus live under the bark of trees. This is all As to the insect described above, although it appears to adapt itself with facility to a variety of physical circumstances, and although it takes occasionally to its wings and flies into houses in the evening, I have never found it upon trees.\nNEW AND LITTLE KNOWN SPECIES OF CEYLON NUDIBRANCHIATE MOLLUSCS, AND ZOOPHYTES.\n\nBy E. F. Kelaart, M.D., Staff Surgeon, F. L. S.\n\nHaving, in the course of my Military service, been now for the third time stationed in Trincomalie, in Medical charge of the European Troops in that Garrison, and still finding that there is nothing like the careful study of God's works to divert the mind from the contemplation of diseased organic bodies, especially in this unhealthy and monotonous station; I have again resumed the researches of my leisure hours, which never fail to draw from me an earnest prayer that my health may be spared long enough to conclude these labours in this and other parts of the Island.\n\nA recent visit to England made me acquainted with the value of the aquarium, and with the interesting researches of Messrs. Alder and Handcock, of Gosse, Johnson, and others, among the soft, gelatinous, marine animals found in European seas, which have been so much neglected by Indian Naturalists, owing to the difficulty either of observing their natural habits, or of preserving their forms. The curiosity thus excited was immediately increased, when, after several years absence, I was again in sight of the magnificent harbour and bays of Trincomalie. While some of my Ceylon friends contemplated my return to Trincomalie as a great evil, I became reconciled to my destination from an inward feeling\u2014and I hope not an unworthy one\u2014that I was again sent here, for a good and useful purpose.\n\nIt is now nearly two years since I returned to Ceylon, and I have every reason to feel thankful, that my residence in Trincomalie\nhas enabled me to prosecute researches in more than one unexplored field of Natural History. I had for my guide the example of those great and good men, who deign to look upon even my labours as worthy of encouragement, and who do not consider the pursuit of the Naturalist as incompatible with the duties of a Military Surgeon. Dr. Johnson, himself a successful Medical practitioner and zealous Naturalist, (in his celebrated work on British Zoophytes,) observes, in his remarks on Doctors who are also Naturalists, that \"that very activity of mind and perspicacity which originated and upheld their sagacity and success as practitioners, were sure to carry them far in whatever side-path the natural bent of their taste led them, for the occupation and entertainment of the leisure hours which the busiest must have, or may create. Idleness has no leisure.\" * * * There never was a time when it was necessary to vindicate, to any but the ignorant, the erratic excursions of medical men into the fields of science and literature; for assuredly the rank which the profession, as a body, has taken and holds in public estimation, depends for its patent, in part at least, on the scientific and literary character of its professors; and by continuing to support that character they will best secure it from the vulgarity of a common mercature, or the selfishness of a venal quackery.\"\n\nMy earliest researches, since my return to Ceylon, were directed (with the aid of the microscope) to those minute forms of animal and vegetable life called animalcul\u00e6, and Diatomace\u00e6. I have already communicated to another channel the observations I have made among these interesting microscopical creatures, found in fresh and sea water. In this paper, I propose to communicate to the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, my researches among some of the least known, but most interesting, species of marine animals.\n\nFinding that scarcely anything is known of the many naked Molluscs of this part of the Indian Ocean, I have availed myself of the present favorable opportunity offered by the Ceylon Government, for the investigation of the Natural History of the Pearl Oysters, to extend my researches also to a numerous family\nof *Mollusca* inhabiting these seas, which though not productive of pearly gems, or affording specimens for cabinet collections of Conchologists, or of amateur collectors, have attracted considerable attention in Europe, more especially since the publication of the splendid work of Alder and Hancock on the British *Nudibranchiata*.\n\nThe marine shells of Ceylon have long been known to the Naturalist, and they are also familiar to many in Ceylon, but the soft sea nymphs, or slugs, whose perishable charms often rival the more lasting beauties of the finest shell, had scarcely ever been noticed by any Naturalist or friend in the Island, till I had placed these creatures in the Vivarium. They have not only afforded amusement and instruction to myself, but, I hope, to others also, who have frequently seen these interesting creatures in their new homes. I must confess that some of my visitors were disappointed at the slimy nature of these animals, and failed to appreciate the beauty of many of my pet specimens. Others, however, more alive to the beautiful and to the wonderful works of God, did not despise the sea-born slugs, because they were so snail-like in appearance, and, like the land slugs, destitute of shells. Even the native shell divers, who procured me most of the living specimens, expressed their astonishment at the newly unfolded beauties of these \"*Addai,\"* or slugs, which they found crawling on rocks and sea-weeds; but it was not till the full formed *Doris*, or the sweet little *Eolis*, expanded their tentacles and plumose gills in the glass Vivarium, that these 'men who go down to the deep' became aware, that the creatures which they so much despise are among the most elegant objects of the sea, and that, although a shell will preserve its colour for an almost indefinite period, the rich and variegated colours of these semi-gelatinous creatures, though shorter lived, are not less charming, or less worthy of admiration. It may, therefore, be hoped, that the interest recently created will continue to be attached to the naked *Mollusca* of Ceylon, and, that, in a few years, they will be as well known to\n\n* T *Alycon* 'sea-slug.'\nthe Naturalist as the European species. Although it may be long before we shall find an Alder or a Handcock to portray gracefully, and faithfully record their characters and habits, still it will always be gratifying for me to feel, that I was the pioneer to the labours of others more competent to do justice to the Ceylon Nudibranchiata.\n\nIt has always been my endeavour, (though, I must own, often unsuccessfully,) to describe in familiar language to my friends in Ceylon, the Natural History of animals found in the Island, and therefore, if I have not attained this object in the following pages, it will not be from the want of a wish to impart to others some of the pleasure I have derived in such congenial pursuits or from the absence of a desire to be amusing as well as instructive.\n\nPopular accounts of the Natural History of a country generally follow a scientific one. But I shall endeavour to combine both in one communication, for I cannot but suppose that, among many inquirers, there will be found even a few who are anxious to dive deeper into the characters of an animal than its colour or form. Having this object in view, I cannot introduce the following descriptions of sea slugs, or sea nymphs, by a more intelligible and useful preface, than an abridged description of the Anatomy and Physiology of the Class Nudibranchiata, given in the English Cyclopaedia; promising, in the course of my own descriptive account of the species found in Trincomalie, to detail faithfully their habits and characters.\n\nNUDIBRANCHIATA.\n\nA family of Gasteropodous Mollusca, characterised by the possession of distinct, external and uncovered gills. The species of the family are all marine, and with few exceptions small in size. They are sometimes, with other forms of animals, called sea-slugs, arising from the fact that, like land slugs, they are destitute of shells. Their body is usually elongated and soft, and attached throughout its whole length to the foot, or disc, upon which they crawl. They are not unfrequently covered with a cloak, which in some is strengthened with calcareous spicula. The head is anterior, and frequently indistinct, having one or two pairs of tentacles, the upper pair of which are placed on the cloak when it is present.\nand behind them the eyes are situated. But the characteristic peculiarity of these Molluscs is the appendages that constitute their breathing organs, placed upon the back, always symmetrically, in plumes, tufts or papillae, either forming a circle on the central line, or arranged in rows upon the sides.\n\nNone of the Nudibranchiate Mollusca appear to have been known to the ancients, and even up to the time of Linnaeus they remained, with one or two rare exceptions, entirely unnoticed. It was not until the appearance of the celebrated \"Memoires\" of Cuvier, in the Annales du Museum, that much attention was drawn to this subject. Since then, Lamarck and Blainville contributed something to the knowledge of their physiology and relations, but not much to the number of species.\n\nAlthough little had been done up to this time by British Naturalists in augmenting the species of this beautiful family, they have been, since, the subjects of most accurate and fruitful research; and the monograph now publishing by the Ray Society, on the \"British Nudibranchiate Mollusca,\" may be regarded as one of the most remarkable contributions made to the literature of Natural History during the present century. Continental naturalists have also added several new European species during the last half century.\n\nWith the imperfect knowledge of foreign species that we yet possess it is scarcely possible to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion concerning the general distribution of the Nudibranchiata in the different regions of the globe. The tropical forms are, as usual, larger and more brilliantly coloured than those of colder climates, but the notices of extra European species are so scanty, that we cannot form any idea of their numerical preponderance. * * * * * It cannot be doubted that a great deal of the apparent deficiency of other genera, in comparison with the Dorididae, in foreign countries, arises from the want of proper examination, and from the little attention paid by collectors to the less conspicuous forms.*\n\nIn 1841, the celebrated Naturalist, M. Sars, announced the discovery, that these little creatures undergo a metamorphosis, having on their extrusion from the egg a very different form and character from those which they are afterwards destined to assume. In this first stage of their existence, they have the appearance of small animalcules, swimming freely through the water by means of two ciliated lobes, and have their body covered by a nautiloid shell furnished with an operculum. Up to\n\n* Having paid this attention to \"less conspicuous forms,\" I am enabled to add considerably to several genera.\u2014E. F. K.\nthat time nothing approaching to a distinct metamorphosis had been known to exist in any of the true Molluscs.\n\nThe Nudibranchiata exhibit a high state of organization. They are all provided with a powerful muscular buccal apparatus, which has, in some instances, appended to it a gizzard. The oral aperture is guarded by fleshy lips, and the mouth is furnished with a tongue, bearing a spiny prehensile membrane, and occasionally with lateral corneous jaws.\n\nThe oesophagus, stomach, and intestines are well marked; the former is generally short, and passes from the upper surface of the buccal mass. The stomach is frequently buried in the liver. The intestine is always short.\n\nThe liver presents two great types of form. In the Dorididae and Tritonidae it is entire (excepting in Scyli\u00e6, where it is broken up into 6 or 7 globular masses), occupying its normal abdominal position; in the Eolididae it is more or less diffused.\n\nAll the Nudibranchs are hermaphrodites, each individual being furnished with male, female, and androgynous parts. These organs, taken together, are very bulky, and occupy the greater portion of the abdominal cavity. They communicate with a common vestibule, opening upon a nipple-like process on the right side of the body, and always below the mantle, when it is present.\n\nThe organs of circulation and respiration consist of central organs of propulsion,\u2014a systematic and portal heart,\u2014arteries, veins, and sinuses or lacun\u00e6; and of laminated, branched, or papillose branchiae; arranged either on the medial line, or along the sides of the back. The flow of blood is rapid; the pulsations of the heart varying, in the different species, from 50 to 100 in the minute.\n\nThe nervous system presents a high degree of concentration, perhaps higher than in any other group of Mollusca,\u2014and is divided into two very distinct portions:\u2014one, the cephalic or excito-motor; the second, the splanchnic or sympathetic; these two portions intercommunicate at several points.\n\nAll the Nudibranchs are provided with auditory capsules. Eyes are also universally present. The dorsal tentacles are the organs of smell, and, judging from their great development, this sense must be more acute in most of the Nudibranchs than it is in any other Mollusc, with the exception perhaps of Nautilus. Touch undoubtedly resides everywhere in the skin, but it is specialised in the oral tentacles and parts about the mouth. The lips and channel of the mouth are probably the seat of taste.\nTheir ten city of life, when kept in confinement, varies much in the different species, but is greater than in many other marine animals.\n\nThough patient and long-suffering in the endurance of hunger, they are very voracious. The greater number of them are carnivorous; living principally upon Zoophytes and Sponges. The Eolides do not scruple occasionally to devour the weaker among their own brethren.\u2014Abridged from English Cyclopaedia.\n\nHoping that the foregoing anatomical and physiological account of the Nudibranchiata, will draw more than ordinary attention to this family of marine creatures (found on almost every rock and sea weed), I shall proceed to give a descriptive account of upwards of a hundred species of marine-animals, including Sea-anemones and Planaria, found in the harbour, bays, and coves of Trincomalie. I cannot but regret, that not having with me Ruppel and Ehrenberg's work on species found in the Red Sea, I am not able to speak positively of all those herein described as being new to science. Some may, perhaps, have already been described by earlier observers, which, if ascertained to be the case, I shall only be too glad to take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging.\n\nIn concluding these prefatory remarks, I have to express my personal obligations to those authorities who have retained my military services in Ceylon, thereby enabling me to resume my Zoological labours, which were precipitately and unexpectedly shortened by my removal from the Island.\n\nTrincomalie,\n1st November, 1857.\nCEYLON NUDIBRANCHIATA MOLLUSCA.\n\n(NAKED MOLLUSCS.)\n\nSub-Kingdom. MOLLUSCA.\nClass. GASTEROPODA.\nOrder. NUDIBRANCHIATA.\nFam. DORIDID\u00c6.\n\nBranchial plumes surrounding the vent on the medio-dorsal line.\n\nSub-Family. DORIDIN\u00c6. With a cloak.\nGenus Doris. Linnaeus.\n\nAnimal oblong, covered by a mantle; four tentacles, two superior or dorsal, clavate or conical, retractile within cavities, sometimes slightly sheathed. The two inferior or oral tentacles placed on each side of the mouth, sometimes absent or replaced by flat appendages; eye specks immersed behind the dorsal tentacles, not always visible in the adult; lingual membrane with numerous lateral teeth; rachis often edentulous; stomach simple; liver compact; skin strengthened with spicula, more or less definitely arranged.\n\nDoris gloriosa. Kel.\n\nSynonym. Doris marginata? Leuckart.\n\nBody nearly 3 inches long; oblong, of a pinkish colour minutely dotted with red and white. Mantle large, oval, broad, when expanded entirely covering the foot. Back mottled with pink, red and yellow, and minutely punctulated with red and\nyellow, edged broadly with white, then by a rich broad red line; adjoining this is a whitish space, and carried round the mantle, near the body, is a still more brilliant blood red line, with internal club-shaped prolongations of the same beautiful purple red colour. Interspace and for about a quarter of an inch of breadth of the back, the mantle is again whitish, with shades of purple and yellow nearer the beautifully mottled back. The underside of mantle has also a broad white edge, the rest brilliantly variegated with dotted purple, yellow and red splashes. Branchi\u00e6 7 or 8, large, branched; each rising from a separate cavity in a circle about half an inch from a protruding yellow coloured anal orifice. Plumes roseus, with red midribs. Dorsal tentacles large, clavate; apex pointed, slightly truncated, on inner edge laminated; colour pinkish and spotted yellow; ridge of cavity spotted with yellow and red. Head large, protruding nearly three-quarters of an inch from mantle. Mouth near foot, situated in the centre of an oval projection, and on each side a long broad toothed leaflet or oral appendage, red and dotted like the head. Foot long, broad, with parallel sides, rounded and transversely split in front. It has a broad lemon coloured edge with transverse stri\u00e6; the rest pinkish red, not spotted; a dark purple spot in centre given by the internal viscera.\n\nThis is by far the most beautiful species of Doris or sea nymph I have ever seen, and none but a good artist could do justice to its resplendent beauties. The large ample surface of the mantle, with its soft, snowy white undulating edge, is best seen when the animal is swimming, and reflecting in the water the rich red folds near the golden speckled back, on which is placed a broad circle of rosy coloured feathery tufts. The live specimen, of which the above is but a faint description, was found under corals in low water near Fort Frederick. In another specimen from the same locality, the white edge of the mantle was replaced by a rich crimson red, which coalesced with the inner red line, leaving a faint white line. Indeed, it is a question which of the two varieties looked more beautiful; at night, however, the palm of beauty was awarded to the red margined specimen. They both lived for some days in\na vivarium. When at rest, the mantle was turned inwards towards the back; in this position the white and red lines were hidden by the broad rolls on each side, displaying the rich profusion of red and yellow dotted splashes and undulating lines of the under surface of the mantle. In fact, it then looked like another species, but it is only when the mantle is fully expanded and floating on the water, that the unrivalled charms of this beautiful sea nymph is seen to perfection. In the young, the mantle extends round the head, and may be mistaken for a distinct species. I have not had an opportunity of seeing the spawn of this species.\n\nIf this splendidly coloured sea nymph is identical with Leuckart's species, found in the Red Sea, and named Doris marginata, I should still prefer retaining the name I have given it, as \"marginata\" would apply, equally as well, to several other species as to this.\n\nDORIS MACCARTHYI. Kel.\n\nBody nearly $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long; dusky grey. Mantle long, narrow, dusky grey; bordered with a bright blue line; edge crenulated, wavy. Dorsal tentacles long, conical, obtusely pointed; laminated obliquely, for nearly two-thirds of its length; of a pale blue colour with white streaks. Oral tentacles white, short, broad and rounded. Branchial plumes 12 to 15; irregular, most of them of unequal length; pinnated, and a few trifurcated; others have a small cluster of plumes rising from the middle or extremity. Foot white, and nearly as long as the mantle.\n\nThis curious, but elegant species is semi-gelatinous; and resembles a Goniodoris from its narrow mantle, which scarcely covers the foot; the body is almost exposed.\n\nI have dedicated this beautiful species to one who has always encouraged my pursuits in the field of Natural History. To Sir Charles MacCarthy, the Colonial Secretary of Ceylon, I feel grateful for that assistance which his position in the Island enabled him to give me, whenever required; and I also feel\nthankful to him for the warm interest he has taken in my employment as Naturalist, to investigate the Natural History of the Pearl Oysters, which has so abruptly been brought to a conclusion by my professional services being required in another part of Her Majesty's dominions,\u2014the rebel polluted land of India.\n\n**Doris c\u0153lestis. Kel.**\n\nBody white, 2\u00bd inches long; flattened. Mantle coriaceous, white, clouded with dark purple minute rings, confluent or continuous with lighter coloured purple rings, set more widely apart. Dorsal tentacles white, long; apex clavate, lamellated, slightly truncated on the superior edge; pale green, tipped with orange; margin of sheath orange or golden. Oral tentacles long, acutely pointed; white, minutely speckled with purple. Branchial plumes 6, long, tripinnated; whitish, ribs purplish brown, edge of cavity orange. Foot white, shorter than mantle; grooved; lower lamella notched.\n\nThis beautiful purpled clouded Doris is of very retiring habits; scarcely ever seen moving. Obtained in August and September from rocks in Back Bay. Ova white, in three or four broad coils.\n\n**Doris funebris. Kel.**\n\nBody nearly 1\u00bd inch long; oblong, convex; of a waxy white colour, and spotted black. Mantle coriaceous, granular; of an ivory white colour, and ornamented with jet black spotted circles and half rings or imperfect annular spotted figures. Dorsal tentacles large, clavate; apex black, laminated, without sheaths. Oral tentacles linear; white, tip black. Branchial plumes 6, large and drooping, tri-pinnate; white and shaded lavender grey; midribs of a dark brown colour. Foot waxy white; spotted irregularly on the margin of edges with small and large linear spots.\n\nThis elegant funereal looking Doris is, with the mantle, about 2\u00bd inches long, and 1\u00bd broad. Rarely seen. Lives for a long\ntime in the aquarium. Deposits its ova in broad convoluted bands, which, when uncoiled, measure nearly 18 inches in length. A pair kept in the aquarium were seen to spawn in July. While one was depositing the band of ova on the side of the glass globe, the other kept watch, as it were, by moving in a circle round the former. The whole process lasted about half an hour.\n\nThe spots and markings of some specimens were of a dark brown colour. In others the spots were of an auburn colour.\n\n**Doris Gleniei. Kel.**\n\nSemi-gelatinous. Body nearly 1\u00bd inch long. Mantle broad, shorter than foot,\u2014above, white, with a pinkish yellow shade; a large irregularly waved deep golden coloured patch on the back, bordered and spotted with purplish red. The under surface of fore part of mantle, of a beautiful light purple colour. There is also a purple line on each side of the white body. Dorsal tentacles white, with golden coloured laminae; long, conical and pointed. Oral tentacles short, white. Branchial plumes 7 to 9, short, lanceolate, pinnated; white, bordered with golden yellow. Foot pinkish white; edge pure white.\n\nThis beautiful species I have named after my friend the Rev. Owen Glenie, Colonial Chaplain of Trincomalie, who was often the cheerful companion of my zoological pursuits, and who will, I hope, on my departure from the Island, continue those researches which he has so well begun.\n\nThis is perhaps next to *Trevelyana Zeylanica* (n.s.) and *Doris Gloriosa*, the most remarkably coloured species in Ceylon. Found in the Inner Harbour in deep water, as also at Kottiar, opposite Fort Frederick.\n\n**Doris Leoparda. Kel.**\n\nBody \u00bd inch long, grey spotted. Mantle caraneous, granular; grey, and spotted with dark grey and blackish circular spots; the latter in the central parts; each spot composed of smaller spots, separated from each other by white reticulations, seen\nmore distinctly with the aid of a magnifier. Dorsal tentacles green; large, broad, ovate, lamellated for nearly the whole length. Oral tentacles short, linear, acutely pointed. Branchial plumes 6, grey, speckled with darker grey, all united for nearly half the length; the other half fringed with short plumes of a light green colour. Foot whitish, speckled; covered by mantle.\n\nThis Leopard-spotted Doris is of a regular oval form. Found in Dutch Bay among coral rocks.\u2014Ova white.\n\n**Doris Amabilis. Kel.**\n\nBody 4 lines long, oblong, narrow, convex, white, spotted purple on sides. Mantle smooth, white, and spotted with purplish crimson spots; beneath white, not spotted. Dorsal tentacles of moderate length; apex conical, pointed; closely lamellated; of a golden yellow colour. Branchial plumes 5 or 6, small, bi-pinnate; white, with purple spots at their base. All retracted within a cavity, without a rim. Head rounded, spotted purple, on each side of mouth a short linear tentacle, white. Foot narrow, longer than the mantle, slightly expanded in front, spotted purple on the upper surface.\n\nThis lovely little Doris is rarely found. Two specimens, obtained in May, are still alive in a finger glass, generally resting on the side of a stone. At night they crawl out of their hiding place and creep along the sides of the glass, and are sometimes seen floating on the surface of the water on their back. When touched with a feather they adhere by their foot, and can be kept dangling in this position by the aid of the mucous thread secreted by the surface of the foot. Several Eolid\u00e6 were kept in the same vessel, and they have survived them all, though attacked repeatedly by the Eolis. Ova white, deposited on side of glass in a thread-like coil.\n\n**Doris Fidelis. Kel.**\n\nBody \u00bd inch long; narrow, convex; white. Mantle oblong, with parallel sides; shorter than the foot; of a waxy white colour, the edge lined with red and irregular tooth-like transverse\ninternal prolongations of the same colour; those on sides, longer, alternated with short ones. Branchial plumes 7 or 8, black; lanceolate, pinnated, few branched at tip. Dorsal tentacles oblong, flattened, pointed; apex black, lamellated. Oral tentacles small, acutely pointed. Foot white, narrow, slightly dilated in front, and pointed posteriorly.\n\nFound on coral rocks at low water mark, in August and September. This singularly marked species looks, when the tentacles and branchiae are retracted, like a large bean. Its jet black plumes and tentacles appear very conspicuous above the red margined white mantle. It is very tenacious of life. Ova deposited in narrow white coils.\n\n**Doris Preciosa. Kel.**\n\nBody white, \u00a7 inch long. Mantle pale greenish yellow, very light coloured on sides, where there is also a blueish shade; closely speckled with small reddish-brown spots; margin marked with a narrow purple red line and a light orange shade. Dorsal tentacles short, with reddish-purple apex, clavate, laminated. Oral tentacles triangular, sharp pointed. Branchiae short, pinnated; reddish-purple. Foot white, shorter than mantle.\n\nThis gem-like elegant species, is of the same size as *D. Fidelis*, and not unlike it in appearance. The deep blood-red branchial plumes, and the red margined speckled cloak, sufficiently separate it from the last species. They are both found in the same locality, and at the same time. The characters of the young species are also very marked, as in the adult specimens.\n\n**Doris Nivea. Kel.**\n\nBody \u00a7 inch long, convex, elliptical, snowy white. Mantle coriaceous, granular; white, occasionally seen speckled indistinctly with small grey spots. The purplish coloured viscera seen through the opaline back. Dorsal tentacles pure white, short, conical, pointed slightly, lamellated at tip. Oral tentacles linear. Branchial plumes 6 or 7, white, bi-pinnate. Foot white, shorter than mantle.\nThis snowy white opaline Doris, is probably only a variety of Doris pallida of Leuckart, found by Ruppel in the Red Sea. It has not, however, all its characters; the cloak resembles that of D. repanda in some respects. It has white, nerve-like lines on the margin. I have only seen one specimen, which lived for a few days.\n\nDoris marmorata. Kel.\n\nBody 2\u00bd inches long, oblong, convex, coriaceous; white, speckled reddish-brown. Mantle broad and long, covering the foot; thick, hard, granular; marbled with black and reddish-brown, and irregularly spotted white. Under surface white, and mottled with irregular shaped purplish-red spots. Branchial plumes 6, united at base, superior half plumose, tri-pinnated, grey and grizzled with brown. Dorsal tentacles large, clavate, laminated; brown and speckled white. Sheaths granular. Head small; oral tentacles long, linear, acutely pointed. Foot white, deeply notched and grooved in front; spotted reddish-brown.\n\nThis large marbled Doris lived only for a few days. They are found on rocks near Fort Frederick at low-water mark. Some are of a darker brown colour than others.\n\nDoris cerisa. Kel.\n\nBody \u00bd inch long, convex, oval; of a vermillion-red colour. Mantle of a cherry-red colour, covering the foot. Branchial plumes 6 or 7; very small, straight and stiff; bi-pinnated; of a crimson-red colour. Dorsal tentacles small, conical, lamellated, purplish red; speckled white, tip grey. Oral tentacles indistinctly seen. Foot pinkish.\n\nI have only seen one specimen of this exceedingly pretty species. It lived for several months in a finger-glass. It cannot be mistaken for the young of any other Ceylon species herein described. Ova red, in six narrow tape-like coils. The ova of D. rubra (mihi) are white.\nDORIS RUFOFUNOTATA. Kel.\n\nBody \u00bc inch long, oval, compressed; of a white colour. Mantle coriaceous; of a light brick-red colour, and speckled with circular spots of a darker reddish-brown colour. Branchial plumes 5 small, bi-pinnate; greyish, speckled rufous. Dorsal tentacles short, clavate, pointed, laminated, without sheaths; of a rufous brown colour. Oral tentacles white; linear. Foot whitish; short, grooved and notched in front, speckled rusty. Under part of cloak whitish, and also speckled rusty.\n\nThis stiff-looking Doris is occasionally seen in a circular form. Rarely found, among Pearl Oysters; very tenacious of life.\n\nDORIS GRISSEA. Kel.\n\nBody 1\u00bd inch long, gelatinous. Mantle of a dark ashy-brown colour, closely speckled with reddish brown and white spots, and two or four longitudinal rows of larger blackish irregular spots. Tentacles clavate, laminated; ashy-brown speckled white. Branchial plumes 5 whitish, speckled grey; tri-pinnate. Mouth surrounded with a white veil (?) Foot whitish, spotted reddish-brown; notched in the fore part; covered entirely by the mantle. Some specimens are more reddish-coloured than others. The young are nearly always more ashy-coloured.\n\nA very common species, found from March to September in low water, on rocks surrounding Fort Frederick, and also in the Inner Harbour. Lives a long time in the aquarium. Ova white, in three or four white coils. This Doris can elongate itself into the shape of a leech.\n\nDORIS PAPILLOSA. Kel.\n\nBody \u00bc inch long, white, brown spotted. Mantle coriaceous, covered with large papill\u00e6, each rising from a circular tubercular base, or ring. Buff, and spotted dark reddish-brown; a row of larger spots round the margin. A dark brown line runs from base of tentacles to branchia\u00e6. Dorsal tentacles\nlarge, apex clavate, laminated, of a light green colour, speckled white. Oral tentacles short, linear. Foot whitish and spotted with rusty-brown; shorter than mantle. Branchial plumes 6; short, tri-pinnated. Posterior three plumes rusty-coloured; anterior ones whitish.\n\nThis species resembles *Doris rufopunctata*, but its green dorsal tentacles, and papillose tubercles on mantle, sufficiently distinguish it from other species. Ova white, laid in four narrow waved coils.\n\n**Doris rubra. Kel.**\n\nSyn. *Doris solea.? Cuv.*\n\nBody 1\u00bd inch long, oblong, pellucid-red. Mantle crimson-red, and maculated with irregularly shaped dark brick-red or purple spots; those on the back larger. Tentacles large, clavate; apex red, laminated. Branchiae 6, of a light rose colour; large, tri-pinnate. The two anterior ones smaller than the rest. Foot oblong, broad, of a pinkish-red colour; longer than mantle; rounded in front and transversely grooved; anterior lamina notched in centre. Oral tentacles linear; mantle extended, nearly three inches.\n\nThis beautiful red species is found in great abundance in and out of the harbour of Trincomalie; and is generally seen on mossy rocks a few feet below the surface of the water. When confined in a glass vivarium, it becomes, at night, nearly throughout, of a pellucid pinkish-white colour, which hue it retains till dawn, when gradually it assumes the brilliant red diurnal costume. Spawns in the months of May and June; ova deposited in three or four large, white, ribbon-like convolutions.\n\n**Doris osseosa. Kel.**\n\nBody 1 inch long. Mantle hard, cartilaginous, granular and pitted; granules of a whitish colour; on the median line is a narrow ridge extending from base of tentacles to branchial plumes, which are four or five in number, emerging horizontally\nfrom under the posterior termination of dorsal ridge. In some specimens there is a large pitted protuberance on centre of ridge. Dorsal tentacles with large granular sheaths; apex conical, lamellated; of a pale green colour. Oral tentacles white. Foot small, narrow. Branchial plumes small, bi-pinnated.\n\nThis curiously formed Doris resembles a piece of bone, or piece of worm-eaten white stone. Its habits are those of the other Doridae.\n\n**Doris Constantia. Kel.**\n\nCoriaceous. Body \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long; light yellow. Mantle yellowish-brown, granular; dark brown spots on edge. Dorsal tentacles yellow, conical, swollen at the apex, laminated; tip produced, white. Oral tentacles small, linear. Branchial plumes whitish, five or six, small, bi-pinnate. Foot small, covered by the mantle. Under parts yellowish.\n\nI have only seen one of this species, which lived for many months in a vivarium. It came nightly to one of the oysters, and apparently fed on the back of the shells, upon the atoms of life found there.\n\n**Doris Luteola. Kel.**\n\nSemi-gelatinous. Body \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long. Mantle granular, yellowish, and shaded with darker yellow. Dorsal tentacles long, black, lamellated apex. Oral tentacles short, white. Branchial plumes long, bi-pinnate, greenish. Foot white, shorter than mantle.\n\nThis elegant species is found in shallow water; spawns in October. Ova light green, in two narrow tape-like convolutions.\n\n**Doris Viperina. Kel.**\n\nBody 2 inches long; white. Mantle coriaceous, oval; covered with short spinous tubercles, of a grey colour; and beautifully spotted with dark grey and purplish brown spots having a blueish shade. Under surface of mantle white, with\npurplish spots, a purplish line runs near the edge; border transversely streaked. Dorsal tentacles, greenish, long, white, slightly truncated, laminated clavate tops. Oral tentacles white; long, pointed. Branchial plumes 6; short, broad, bi-pinnate; of a greenish white colour. Foot oblong, entirely covered by the broad oval mantle; white, spotted with smaller purplish spots than those seen on the under surface of mantle.\n\nFound in deep water, near French Battery.\n\n**Doris atrata. Kel.**\n\nBody \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, and \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch broad; ovate, convex; of a smoky-black colour. Mantle broad, when expanded covering the foot; smooth, edge semi-transparent, the rest jet-black. Branchiae 8; small, of a smoky-black colour, bi-pinnate; two sets of 4 each, all entering the same cavity round anus. Foot long, narrow, rounded in front, slightly projecting behind when in progression; of a pale smoky colour. Mouth indistinctly seen. Oral tentacles linear. Dorsal tentacles pellucid, with clavate apex; black; tips white, looking like eyes set on the tentacles. Ova white, in three or four small narrow tape-like coils.\n\nThis species may prove to be either identical with *Doris fumata* of Leuckart, or *D. fumosa* of \"Quoy et Gaym,\" the latter more probably, as the remarkable, white tipped tentacles (always present), could not have passed unobserved by Ruppel. The branchiae however, of *D. fumata* would appear to correspond with those of the Ceylon species. The next species too, which I regarded at one time as only a variety of *D. fumata*, must, I think, be considered distinct, as it was not found in April with *D. atrata*, but subsequently, when the latter became scarce.\n\n**Doris atroviridis. Kel.**\n\nBody 10 lines long, of an invisible-green colour. Mantle broad, undulating, of a greenish-black colour; edge streaked with a pale crimson line. Tentacles and branchiae as in *D. atrata*. Foot of a pale invisible-green. Ova like those of\nthe preceding species. Some of the specimens had the mantle indistinctly, but regularly, spotted white; these spots, composed of several smaller spots round a centre, looked, through a magnifier, like little stars.\n\nThe young of this species is of a jet-black colour, with a broad brilliant crimson line round edge of mantle and foot. If I had not specimens of different ages to compare with, and observe the gradual diminution of the intensity of the red line, till it became almost obsolete in the larger specimens, I should be inclined to consider the characters of the young to be those of a distinct species; so very great are the external characters of the young and older animals. The presence of the red line in the young of this species, and its non-existence in the young of *D. atrata*, still more confirms me in the opinion already advanced, that they are not identical species. Both are very sluggish in their habits; generally, two or more lie locked in each other's embraces, under a stone or a coral branch. In confinement they live longer than any species I have had under observation.\n\n**Doris variabilis. Kel.**\n\nBody 6 lines long, pellucid green; the red viscera seen through it. Mantle greenish-brown, and marked with longitudinal rows of reticulated whitish spots. Dorsal tentacles clavate, laminated; greenish-brown, speckled; tip white. Branchial plumes 8, small, round a central cavity, tri-pinnate; brown, speckled white. Foot pellucid-green; shorter than mantle.\n\nThis species is found in great abundance on rocks in Dutch Bay at low-water mark. They vary much in depth of colour; green, however, always prevailing. In habits, like *D. atrata*.\n\n**Doris exanthemata. Kel.**\n\nBody 5 inches long; pinkish or light purple colour. Mantle long, broad; covered with large and small, smooth conical and rounded nodules, rising from smooth elevated bases. The upper surface is of a deep olive-brown colour, having several white splashes; edge of a lemon colour. Under surface of mantle\npinkish, and near the body there is a broad undulating reddish band, terminating abruptly on each side below the foot, not unlike in appearance to some cutaneous disease. Dorsal tentacles long; pinkish and smooth for two-thirds of its length, apex clavate, laminated, truncated; of a pale brown colour. Oral tentacles long, conical; pinkish. Branchial plumes 6; large, pendant tri-pinnated; plumes pinkish-red and speckled-white; midribs greenish. Foot much shorter than mantle, deeply grooved and notched in front, obtusely pointed posteriorly; of a light pink colour, except the edge which is of a lemon colour with transverse striae.\n\nThe whole animal gives one more the idea of a horrid disease than the charms of a sea nymph. This species is semi-gelatinous and very glutinous on the surface, particularly the mantle. When dead it rapidly dissolves, and cannot be preserved in spirits. The largest specimen I have seen measured 8 inches long and 5 inches broad. It will not live more than a few days in the aquarium. Ova of a beautiful red colour; coil \u00bc inch broad, and 18 inches in length. This species resembles Doris carbunculosa, but the smooth nodules, and the red ova, of the former will always be sufficient marks of distinction.\n\nDORIS CARBUNCULOSA. Kel.\n\nBody nearly 4\u00bd inches long; oblong, oval; of a pinkish-purple colour. Mantle semi-gelatinous, broad and long, and of an oval form; purplish-brown colour, studded with numerous large warty nodules, and larger ones rising from a raised tubercular ringed base. Nodules of a deeper brown colour; some have also a greenish tinge and others are variegated with white. Dorsal tentacles long, produced, clavated, truncated superiorly, laminated; of a pale purplish colour. Mouth with a small triangular-shaped veil. Branchial plumes 5; large, broad and long; closely tri-pinnated; of a rusty-red colour, grizzled with white. Foot short, oblong, oval; of a purplish-pink colour; sides of under surface veined and of a pink colour.\nThe mantle of this inelegant Doris, is not unlike some carbuncular formation. The under surface is pinkish and shaded with purple. It is a very unsightly object. The edge of the mantle of the young is mottled-yellow. The whole animal is nearly 5 inches long, and 3\u00bd broad in the centre. Ova white, deposited in narrow tape-like form in four or five broad coils. The white ova alone sufficiently distinguish this ugly sea-nymph from her rival D. exanthemata.\n\nDoris intecta. Kel.\n\nBody 1\u00bc inch long. Mantle warty; of a dark-brown colour, nearly black; on the medial line is a thick white pasty line. Dorsal tentacles brown; clavate, laminated. Oral tentacles long, linear, pointed; of a bright-brown colour. Branchial plumes 6, tri-pinnated; of a golden-brown colour. Foot golden-brown; narrow, longer than mantle.\n\nThis warty Doris is easily distinguished from others of a brown colour by its rufous warty mantle, and the dirty-white line on back. Even the young have the white dorsal streak. Very common in low water in the months of September and October.\n\nDoris lanuginosa. Kel.\n\nBody \u00bd inch long; of a pale-green colour. Mantle green, covered with short downy hair. Dorsal tentacles green, lamellated, pubescent. Oral tentacles not observed. Branchiae 10 or 12; small, of a sap-green colour, bi-pinnated. Foot shorter than mantle; of a pale-green colour, transparent.\n\nOf this downy species I have only seen one specimen. It lived only a few days. Found near Nicholson's Cove.\n\nDoris spongiosa. Kel.\n\nSemi-gelatinous. Body nearly 3\u00bd inches long. Mantle broad, oval, covering the foot in all parts; of a dull yellow-brown colour, deeply pitted; margin of pits granular; cavities spongy. The whole upper surface of mantle looks like the\nsurface of some species of sponge. Beneath of a darker yellow-brown colour. Dorsal tentacles large, with slightly truncated, laminated apex, sheaths large, funnel-shaped; granular. Oral tentacles (?). Branchial plumes 5, grey, drooping much; bi-pinnated. Foot broad, long.\n\nThis very curiously formed Doris is found in deep water in the Inner Harbour. The young may be mistaken for a distinct species, from the lateral cavities or pits being deeper. The whole animal is nearly the size of D. exanthemata.\n\n**Doris striata. Kel.**\n\nCoriaceous. Body 1\u00bd inch long. Mantle nearly smooth; white, with light-brown wavy streaks. Under surface white, with linear wavy streaks near the body. Dorsal tentacles with short conical, laminated apex. Oral tentacles white, linear, pointed. Branchial plumes 5 or 6, small, bi-pinnated; white, streaked with brown. Foot pure white, narrow, oblong. Found in Dutch Bay.\n\n**Doris corrugata. Kel.**\n\nBody nearly 1 inch long, oval, whitish. Mantle coriaceous, corrugated, and studded with small tubercles; those on the sides larger, and each has a spine; of a pale watery-green colour; black spotted under surface, also greenish and spotted with small dots. Dorsal tentacles short, open, greenish, lamellated. Branchial plumes grey; 7 or 8, short, pinnated. Foot pale-green; narrow; shorter than mantle. Oral tentacles short, triangular, pointed.\n\nI have seen only one live specimen of this curious Doris.\n\n**Doris picta. Kel.**\n\nCoriaceous. Body 2\u00bd inches long. Mantle large, oval, covering entirely the foot; upper surface granular, of a yellowish-brown colour, splashed with large and small irregular brick-red spots; under surface white, and near the body painted with small and large bright red spots. Dorsal tentacles clavate,\nlaminated, slightly truncated; sheaths large, granular. Oral tentacles long, pointed; white, spotted red. Foot broad, shorter than mantle; white.\n\nThis remarkably painted Doris is found in deep water. Occasionally it burrows in the sand, where it lies for hours,\u2014plumes and dorsal tentacles alone being uncovered.\n\nDoris bellicosa. Kel.\n\nCoriaceous. Body 2\u00bd inches long. Mantle large, oval, upper surface granular, and covered with small spines; of a dull brick-red, or chocolate colour, and irregularly streaked with pale-yellow. Under surface of mantle white, splashed and spotted with chocolate. Branchial plumes 6, large, bi-pinnated; of a dull-rose colour, and speckled yellow in small specimens. Dorsal tentacles with small clavate, pointed, apex. Oral tentacles white, short, pointed. Foot broad, oval, of a dark-red colour with a pale whitish edge.\n\nFound in deep water in the Inner Harbour of Trincomalie. The mantle of this species resembles much that of D. picta, but its spines and chocolate-coloured foot sufficiently distinguish it from that species, which has a white foot and beautifully painted under-side of mantle. They live for many months in a vivarium,\n\nDoris castanea. Kel.\n\nCarneous. Body 1\u00bd inch long. Mantle thick, granular and tubercular; of a reddish-chestnut colour. Dorsal tentacles red, short, laminated; tip produced, whitish. Oral tentacles short, linear, pointed. Branchial plumes 6 (?), short, bi-pinnated; of a purplish colour. Under parts deep vermilion-red, and speckled with darker red. Foot short, red.\n\nFound near Sober Island, Trincomalie Harbour.\nSub-genus. ONCHIDORIS.\n\nONCHIDORIS LEACHII, Blainv.\n\nCarneous. Body oval, about $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long. Mantle granular and studded with filamentous granules. Those on the posterior third of mantle often large, and appearing like small branchial plumes. No dorsal tentacles. Two oral tentacles, which appear to protrude through notches, from under the anterior edge of mantle. The foot is broad and nearly occupies the whole of the under part of mantle. Anus opens on the under surface of the posterior part of mantle. Orifice of the organs of generation on the right side.\n\nFound on rocks in the Inner Harbour. I have scarcely any doubt, that this is the Onchidore described by Blainville from a specimen seen in the British Museum, whose habitat was not known.\n\nThe colour of the animal is of a light-grey, mottled with black spots in some specimens. In spirits the filamentous granules are not seen, but when the animal is alive they are so distinctly, and the contractile character of the filaments are very observable, especially of the larger ones.\n\nTREVELYANA, n. g.\n\nBody without a cloak. Two dorsal tentacles without sheaths, non-retractile. Mouth in front of head, without tentacles. Branchi\u00e6 in a circular disc on the back; non-retractile.\n\nTREVELYANA ZEYLANICA. Kel.\n\nBody $1\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long, narrow, elevated and inflated near the branchial plumes; semi-gelatinous, white and spotted with small dark orange-red spots, set wide apart from each other. Head rather produced and rounded; also spotted red. Mouth circular, small; situated in front, without veil or tentacles. Branchial plumes 15 or 16, situated on posterior third of body, round a large disc, in the centre of which is the vent. Plumes long, downy, closely set; pure white, with a longitudinal\nbright red streak on the back of each; slightly contractile, but they do not retract into a cavity; when extended, they resemble a small tuft of marabout feathers. Genital orifice in a nipple-like process, situated between the anterior and middle-third of body. Foot long, and broad; terminating posteriorly in a lancet-shaped point, about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch from body; white, with a delicate light orange-red line on the edge of the foot; this line is carried partially on each side of head. Tentacles 2, dorsal; short, conical, pointed; upper half indistinctly laminated; of a light orange-red colour at tip; base colourless, transparent. Ova yellow, deposited in bead-like coils. They generally deposit the coils on branches of sea-weed. Sometimes this Doris resembles a miniature fan-tail pigeon; particularly when perched on sea-weed, and the small marabout plumes are elongated.\n\nFound on rocks and sea-weed near Sober Island.\n\nThis elegant creature does not resemble any of the described species. The form of the body is not unlike that of the genus Ancula. Its nearest approach, in other particulars, is to Polycera.\n\nI venture to make a distinct genus of this Doris, and dedicate it to Sir Walter Trevelyan, to whom I am indebted so much for the liberal aid he has afforded me in my researches into the Natural History of Ceylon.\n\nFam. Tritoniad\u00e6.\n\nMelib\u0153a. Rang.\n\nAnimal elongated, with a narrow, channelled foot, and long slender tail; sides of the back with pairs of tuberculated lobes, easily deciduous; tentacles cylindrical, retractile into long trumpet-shaped sheaths; head covered by a lobe-like veil; sexual orifices behind right tentacle; excretory behind first gill on the right side.\u2014(Woodward.)\nMeli\u00e6a viridis. Kel.\n\nAnimal gelatinous, transparent, of a greenish vitreous colour. Body covered with hairy filaments. Head small, nearly circular, covered with filaments. Veil large, and very expansive; circular opening lined with cilia. Tentacles 2, about \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch long; capsule small, covered with filaments. Branchiae 6 or 7 on each side, unequal, wedge-shaped; placed alternately; base broad; slightly pedunculated, covered with cilia and filaments, giving a very hairy appearance; base brown; the other parts greenish and speckled with dirty white. Foot narrow, of pinkish colour on edge, and upper surface covered with short filaments.\n\nNearly 3 inches long.\n\nFound on weeds near Inner Harbour; not common; can swim very actively. The veil over the head is used as a net doubtless to entangle its prey. The opening is very dilatable. Deposits its ova in a flat mass; ova white.\n\nScyll\u00e6a (?) Drac\u00e6na. Kel.\n\nAnimal green; elongated, narrow. No mantle. Two tentacles placed anteriorly on side of head; non retractile; tentacles folded or cylindrical, slightly granular. On the centre of the back there are three unequal wing-like denticulated lobes, of a green colour, with a tooth-like processes, tipped red; sides of the posterior half of body also toothed with two lines of small, pointed, red-tipped tubercles. Foot narrow, channelled. Mouth protected by two small semi-orbicular flaps or veils. Orifice on right side. Length nearly 1 inch.\n\nI have some doubts as to the propriety of placing this species under the genus Syll\u00e6a. I could not discover any tufted branchiae on the surface of the dorsal lobes. I propose naming this genus, closely allied to Glaucus, if new, in honor of Dr. Templeton, late of the Royal Artillery (brother of the Belfast Naturalist) who has contributed considerably to the Fauna of Ceylon.\nI have found only one specimen on a branch of sea-weed. It looked at first like a piece of green weed, but on placing it in fresh sea water, the lobes expanded and waved about very briskly. The red tips of the lobes contrasted beautifully with the bright green of the animal. It lived only a few hours.\n\nPolycera (?) Zeylanica. Kel.\n\nBody \u00bd inch long. No distinct mantle. Head covered by a membranous fimbriated veil; the long filaments slightly toothed. Veil continuous with a narrow membranous expansion on side of body, which are united at the tail. Large fimbriated filaments also on sides of body. A membranous crest runs on the medial line of back. Dorsal tentacles retractile in a sheath; clavate, laminated, incurved at the tip; brown, white tipped. Oral tentacles white; broad and short. Branchial plumes 5, short, bi-pinnated, retractile, placed in a circle, in the centre of the back, near the third pair of dorsal filaments. Colour above, bright orange-red; beneath whitish, with red specks seen through the transparent foot. Ova, bright red; in narrow coils. The whole animal is scarcely 1 inch long; and its broadest part not more than \u00be of an inch.\n\nI have placed this species, very doubtfully, under the head of Polycera. I believe there is sufficient reason to make a new genus of the leading characters of this pretty little creature. The transparent membranous expansion is fully extended when the animal swims, which it does, more freely than any known species. For 10 or 15 minutes it will keep floating and moving its body like an eel in the water. Very rare; a few specimens lived for many months in my vivarium.\n\nFam. \u00c6olidae.\n\nAnimal with papillose gills, arranged along the sides of the back; tentacles sheathless, non-retractile; lingual teeth 0.1.0; ramifications of the stomach and liver extending into the dorsal papill\u00e6; excretory orifices on the right side; skin smooth, without spicula; no distinct mantle.\n\u00c6OLIS* Husseyi. Kel.\n\nTentacles 4. Both pairs of the same shape and form; but the anterior ones longer, of a limped-orange hue, tipped with white. Back of a dull orange-brown colour; a triangular white space behind dorsal tentacle. Branchiae numerous, in 3 rows on each side of body, white and ringed with light purple, tip white. Foot dilated anteriorily; no lateral processes.\n\nRare; named in memory of a departed and beloved companion of my earliest scientific labours.\n\n\u00c6OLIS BICOLOR. Kel.\n\nBody \u00a7 inch long, slender: waxy-white; a dusky spot on neck anterior to dorsal tentacles. Dorsal tentacles short, smooth, transparent white at base; corrugated or laminated at apex, of a deep orange-red colour, becoming darker at tip. Oral tentacles twice as long; pellucid-white throughout; tapering, curved. Head small, rounded. Branchiae medium sized; narrow, acutely pointed; white with a subterminal orange-red ring; apex waxy-white. They are set in 6 or 7 small clusters, the anterior ones composed of 34 or more branchiae; the others of two, rarely of three; becoming smaller as they approach the tail. Foot linear; white, transparent; slightly expanded in front.\n\nFound among sea weed in Back Bay, Trincomalie.\n\n\u00c6OLIS EFFULGENS. Kel.\n\nTentacles 4; 2 dorsal moderately long, laminated obliquely; dark-orange, tipped white. The two anterior ones orange, with a whitish spot in centre and tipped white, a dark shade behind dorsal tentacle. Branchiae in 5 or 6 clusters on each side of back. The anterior clusters consisting of 12 or 15 narrow\n\n* \u1f08\u03b5\u1f7c\u03c2, \u1f09\u03bb\u03af\u03c3, daughter of \u1f08\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2.\nobtusely pointed branchi\u00e6; orange-red at base, ringed with white and orange, tip white; a bluish line running longitudinally for nearly two-thirds of its length.\n\nFound in great number in Dutch Bay, and other parts of the sea near Fort Frederick. Spawns in June and July. Ova white, in narrow thready coils.\n\n\u00c6OLIS PAULIN\u00c6. Kel.\n\nTentacles 4; two dorsal, red, wrinkled. The two terminal tentacles pinkish, tip red, base white. Branchi\u00e6 reddish, numerous, short; anterior ones have a whitish central ring, tipped red; posterior ones of a redder colour, tips more broadly tipped with red; the central white ring less distinct. Foot expanded, with a short, triangular-pointed process. Length 3\u00bd lines.\n\n\u00c6OLIS TRISTIS. Kel\n\nTentacles 4; two dorsal, about half the size of the two anterior ones; white with blackish rings. Body white, an interrupted blackish line on each side of back. Branchi\u00e6 in clusters of 3 or 4; short, pointed, white, and ringed with black. Foot slightly expanded, and notched anteriorly. Length about 3 lines.\n\nFound on sea-weed in one of my Aquaria. Ova white.\n\n\u00c6OLIS NODULOSA. Kel.\n\nTentacles 4; opaque-white. Dorsal long, pyramidal, pointed, with three nodular rings; oral tentacles short, narrow, pointed, white with a yellowish shade. Head and back white. Branchi\u00e6 in five small clusters on each side; long, nodular, obtusely pointed; opaque-white and spotted indistinctly with slight orange-brown; base darker. Foot slightly contracted anteriorly.\n\nLength about \u00bd inch.\n\u00c6OLIS SMEDLEYI. Kel.\n\nDorsal tentacles pyramidal, ringed; of a dusky grey colour. Oral tentacles long, pointed, white, with a central red ring. Branchi\u00e6 in five small clusters on each side; the anterior pair largest. Papill\u00e6 short, conical; white, and ringed with grey. Foot long, with anterior tentacular processes Length 4 or 5 lines.\n\nI have named this species in remembrance of one who was a frequent visitor of my \"Aquarian establishment,\" and who took a warm and friendly interest in all my scientific pursuits. This small \u00c6olis was discovered on some sea-weed growing in a Vivarium.\n\nGenus. PROCTONOTUS. A. and H.\n\nAnimal oblong, depressed, pointed behind; dorsal tentacles 2, linear, simple, with eyes at base, behind; oral tentacles short; head covered by a small semi-lunar veil; mouth with horny jaws; gills papillose, on ridges down the sides of the back and round the head in front; vent dorsal.\u2014Woodward.\n\nPROCTONOTUS ORIENTALIS. Kel.\n\nAnimal semi-gelatinous, greenish. Dorsal tentacles 2, bifurcated and retractile. Oral tentacles short, pointed. Branchi\u00e6, four or five rows on each side of body, those nearest the body smaller; wedge-shaped, rounded superiorly, flattened; green, spotted grey and green. Branchi\u00e6 carried round the head in two or three rows; middle ones longer, all of the same shape. Foot broad, long, grooved in foot. Length 2\u00bd inches. Ova white, in waved thread-like coils.\n\nThis exceedingly interesting animal may perhaps occupy a new generic place, as I do not observe the bifurcated dorsal branchi\u00e6 noticed in the other species of the genus Proctonotus. When coiled up it looks like a flower, with green petals.\n\nFound in Trincomalie, in May and July.\nPterochilus viridis. Kel.\n\nAnimal light-green. Length \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch. Tentacles 2, simple, long, pointed. Head with small lateral lobes. Branchi\u00e6 very numerous, closely set; long, linear, acutely pointed. Branchi\u00e6 green, and spotted with darker green and grey. Foot linear. Found on sea-weeds, and, owing to its colour, not easily recognised. Lives for a long time in confinement. Ova green.\n\nFam. Elysiad\u00e6.\n\nGenus. Elysia. Risso.\n\nAnimal elliptical, depressed, with wing-like lateral expansions; tentacles simple, with sessile eyes behind them; foot narrow.\n\nElysia grandifolia. Kel.\n\nHead and body light-green, white, and occasionally black spotted. Head and neck naked. Tentacles 2, folded longitudinally, on side of head; bronzed-green, tip brown. Buccal tentacles 2, small. Membranous wing-like expansion on each side of body; broad anteriorly; acutely pointed posteriorly, and united at the tail. Membrane green, edged with a black and a golden yellow line. No distinct foot. Orifice on the back (?). Mouth beneath.\n\nThe whole animal gives one the idea of a large leaf; and, when moving, that of a butterfly. Found on sea-weed. Some are more than 3 inches long; greatest transverse diameter, with wings expanded, \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches. Distinct veins, filled with fluid seen on the wings; the heart pulsating on the centre of the back. I have some doubts as to the propriety of placing this interesting creature under the head of Elysia. If on further investigation, it is found that it does not belong to any known genera, I propose naming it Hydropsyche.\n\nElysia punctata. Kel.\n\nSmaller than the last species; largest specimen seen measuring \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch.\nAnimal of a lighter green colour. Tentacles dark-brown, spotted white. Back whitish-green, dotted with black and green, and spotted like the back. Edge of mantle black, and shaded with golden; under surface of wings tubercular and dotted black.\n\nFound on sea-weed. Not easily distinguished from the young of *E. grandifolia*.\n\n**Elysia c\u0153rulea. Kel.**\n\nThis is a very small, beautiful species, about $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long; when the wings are folded, it is not thicker than a crow's quill. Tentacles 2; blue, with a central red ring, tip blackish. Body and wings blue; under part of head, and fore part of foot, red; edge of wing lined with black and red lines, the latter outermost.\n\nFound on sea-weed, in the Inner Harbour. All three species have the same generic characters, and doubtless belong to the same genus.\n\n**Order. Infero-branchiata.**\n\n**Genus. Phyllidia. Cuv.**\n\nAnimal oblong, covered with a coriaceous tuberculated mantle; dorsal tentacles clavate, retractile into cavities near the front of the mantle; mouth with two tentacles; foot broadly oval. Gills forming a series of lamina extending the entire length of both sides; excretory orifice in the middle line, near the posterior end of the back, or between the mantle and foot; reproductive organs on the right side; stomach simple, membranous.\n\n**Phyllidia Zeylanicus. Kel.**\n\nMantle tubercular; salmon coloured; three continuous black lines run round the whole length. The internal one broader,\ntaking within its circuit the dorsal tentacles and anal orifice; two other lines run parallel to this all round the mantle; the outer one narrowest. Dorsal tentacles large, conical, pointed; circularly laminated at the upper half, which is of a black colour. The two oral tentacles small, black. Foot whitish, notched in front; the blackish viscera seen through. Branchiae whitish on sides of the body except in front. Anal opening on a black coloured tube, behind which there are four or five large tubercles of the same form as those on the other parts of mantle. Length 1 inch; \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch broad.\n\nVery rare.\n\nGenus. **Diphyllidia.** Cuv.\n\nSyn. **Linguella.** Blain.\n\nAnimal oblong; mantle ample; gills limited to the hinder two-thirds of the body; head with minute tentacles and a lobe-like veil; vent at the right side, behind the reproductive orifices? lingual teeth 30. 1. 30.\n\n**Diphyllidia Formosa.** Kel,\n\nBody pink. Mantle leaf-like; dark-purple, with purplish black shades; edge yellow, streaked longitudinally with golden yellow, broad lines alternated with very delicate narrow ones.

Dorsal tentacles emerging through notches on anterior edge of mantle; tentacles red with blackish tips and sides. No oral tentacle. Length 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch broad.\n\nThis very beautiful species is found in deep water. It occasionally buries itself in sand, with only the head and tentacles exposed, and lies for hours in this position.\nOrder. Tecti-branchiata.\n\nAnimal usually provided with a shell both in the larva and adult state; branchiae covered by the shell or mantle; sexes united.\n\nFam. Pleuro-branchidae.\n\nGenus. Pleurobranchus. Cuv.\n\nAnimal oblong, fleshy, convex above with a very large and overspreading mantle. Foot large, equally outspreading, and thus leaving a wide canal all round the body. Head distinct, furnished with a veil, uniting on each side with the borders of the foot, and with two tubular tentacles, which are split anteriorly; mouth at the extremity of a proboscis; branchiae composed of a double row of lamella, forming a plume on the posterior right side, between the mantle and the foot. Anus carried by a small tube behind the branchiae. Organs of generation in front. Shell sometimes rudimentary, membranous, with a tolerably distinct apex hidden in the thickness of the mantle.\u2014Woodward.\n\nPleurobranchus citrinus? Ruppel.\n\nOrange-red; mantle darker than the other parts of the animal, and speckled with whitish spots. About 1 inch in length. Ova reddish, in circular broad coils.\n\nVery common in Trincomalie. Found in low-water, on coral stones and sea-weed, nearly throughout the year. Spawns in May, June and July.\n\nPleurobranchus reticulatus?

Kel.\n\nBody large, greenish-yellow, except the upper half, which is of purplish colour and tuberculated; the other parts nearly smooth, indistinctly streaked. Disc buff, with darker radiating lines. Tentacles in two or three rows, about 1 inch in length, narrow, pointed obtusely; whitish; base purplish, tip bright crimson, transversely striped with grey or dark buff.\n\nHeight 2\u00bd inches. Breadth nearly 2 inches, when expanded.\n\nFound in deep water on the oyster banks at Cottear, opposite Fort Frederick.\n\nThis handsome species I have dedicated to Sir Henry Ward, Governor of Ceylon, under whose auspices I have been enabled\nto prosecute my researches among marine animals, with more than ordinary success.\n\n**Actinia Tranchelli. Kel.**\n\nBody short, longitudinally striated with pale-green, alternately with lines covered with yellow and white tubercules, small ovular granules round edge of disc. Disc circular, cup-shaped; greenish and rayed with four or five white lines. Tentacles about an inch long, set in two rows, narrow, finely pointed, pellucid, and spotted with opaque, oblong, white and purplish spots; 1\u00bd inch high and \u00bc inch broad. The inner row of tentacles generally erect, and the outer curving over side of body.\n\nFound in Dutch Bay. Named in compliment to Miss Tranchell, of Trincomalie.\n\n**Actinia Pudica. Kel.**\n\nBody opaque-white; irregularly striated and spotted with light-crimson. Tentacles few, pellucid-white; short, conical; set in two or three rows. Disc pellucid, and streaked with milky-white.\n\nThis elegant anemone, when detached, floats on water like a globe, and may be taken for a species of the genus *Mayas*.\n\nFound on small stones in Back Bay, Trincomalie.\n\n**Actinia Passiflora.**\n\nBody semi-carneous, brown. Tentacles few; short, stout, truncated, or capped (?); purplish-white, the longer five or six have dark-purple base and rings.\n\nThis may be a species connecting *Capnia* with *Actinia*. Height 1 to 1\u00bd inch; \u00be inch broad.\n\nFound near S\u00e1mi Rock.\n\n**Actinia Refulgens. Kel.**\n\nSmall, the largest seen scarcely one inch long; body white, translucent; tentacles short, in two rows; brown with golden spots.\nFound on stones in Back Bay, Trincomalie.\n\nResembling a *Zoanthura*, but the clear diaphanous body and the disunited tentacles, at once show this creature to be an *Actinia*.\n\n**Actinia vermicosa. Kel.**\n\nVery small. Body 3 lines in diameter and 4 lines in height; whitish-pellucid. Tentacles from twelve to eighteen, small, worm-like; golden-yellow or dark yellow-brown. Very viscid. When the tentacles are withdrawn this little creature looks like the larva of an insect; oblong globuse, with a golden coloured head.\n\n**Actinia fluctuosa. Kel.**\n\nBody pale, flesh-coloured; indistinctly longitudinally striated, with white spotted lines; several rows of pale-blue granules near edge of disc.\n\nDisc waved, tubercular, forming sometimes in triangular or quadrangular masses, at other times circular; centre of disc pale, the rest white with radiating lines.\n\nTentacles numerous, in three rows, pale-brown, occasionally greenish-pellucid.

Kel.**\n\nSmall, disc of a beautiful bright emerald-green, with white lines or radiating rays. Tentacles numerous, set in three rows; short, oblong, semi-conical, obtusely pointed; white at the base; beyond this, purplish-brown, the rest very pellucid, dashed with purplish and white spots.\n\nBody flesh-coloured, longitudinally striated. Two or more rows of pale-green rounded tubercles, on discal margin, inferior to outer rows of tubercules; at times these granules are of a white colour.\nAbout 1 inch in diameter, and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch high. Found in deep water, Inner Harbour.\n\n**Actinia Austinii. Kel.**\n\nBody rounded, thick, reddish; covered with brick-red tubercles. Disc pellucid-white, or reddish. Oral opening \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch in diameter, margin surrounded with tentacular-like bodies in two or three rows. Tentacles numerous, in four rows; nearly \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches long, narrow, acutely pointed; pellucid-white, spotted on the inner side. Stands \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches high.\n\nThis large anemone is found in great abundance on the rocks near Fort Frederick in the months of May and June. Some, entirely free of the brick-red colour, are of a pale greenish-white; others, have the disc one half purple and the other half grey. It adheres to the finger.\n\nI have named this species in remembrance of a valued friend, who was one of the founders of the Ceylon Military Medical Officers' Museum,\u2014Dr. Austin, late of the 97th Regiment.\n\nOn my recent visit to Colombo, I obtained many specimens of a smaller anemone from Mutwal rocks, closely resembling this species, but with short tentacles, and without the adhering qualities of the foregoing species. I am inclined to believe this to be a distinct species. Colours very changeable.\n\n**Genus. Anthea.**\n\nBody cylindraceous, adhering by a broad base; tentacula disposed in circles round the mouth, elongated, tapered, and incapable of being retracted within the body.\n\n**Anthea Indiana. Kel.**\n\nBody transparent, almost colourless, globose at base, elongated; a few white spots near disc. Tentacles long, delicate, finely pointed, set in two rows on the edge of a greenish transparent disc. The inner set of tentacles more than twice as long as the external row. Tentacles pellucid, indistinctly ringed, alternately with grey and white. Oral opening\nsurrounded with an elevated hexagonal ring, taking the form of a cup, on the centre of which is the transverse slit of the mouth.\n\nThis parasitical anemone is found on Pearl Oysters, in the Harbour of Trincomalie. It grows very rapidly in the Vivarium, and is a good guide for ascertaining the quality of the sea water in which it is placed. When the water is impure, or any animal in it dead and decaying, this *Actinia* shrivels up and assumes a dark-brown or blackish colour, and as the water is purified the creature regains its pellucid form.\n\n**Anthea arachnida. Kel.**\n\nResembling the *A. Indica*, but much smaller, and the disc is spotted black. The tentacles worm-like; pellucid-white, and spotted dusky. Found on rocks and shells.\n\n**Anthea aurea. Kel.**\n\nThis is a very minute species; when elongated, nearly one inch high, and scarcely four lines in breadth. Body pellucid, tentacles few, short; golden-yellow.\n\nFound on rocks and shells.\n\n**Anthea meleagrina. Kel.**\n\nBody short, broad, greenish, translucent, slightly tubercular. Tentacles numerous, of moderate length, narrow, pointed; greenish-brown, with darker brown rings. Mouth slightly elevated. Disc pale-green.\n\nHeight \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch. Breadth \\( 1\\frac{3}{4} \\) to 2 inches when expanded.\n\nFound in the Inner Harbour, in deep water, adhering to Pearl Oyster shells.\n\n**Actinodendron argentea. Kel.**\n\nBody white. Disc granular, frosted white. Tentacles short, acute; silvery-white, transverse granulated lines on inner surface; short pinnules on sides.\nHeight \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch, breadth 1 inch. Very rare. Found in deep-water.\n\n**Actinodendron Zeylanicus. Kel.**\n\nBody large, semi-gelatinous, yellow or buff, longitudinally streaked, alternately with lines of pearly tubercules. Disc broad, cup-shaped, greenish-brown, or purple, with numerous radiating lines of various colours; granular. Tentacles purplish-brown; numerous, in three or four rows; broad, long, pointed, crossed on superior surface with white lines, which are laterally tubercular, or slightly pinnated. A row of large oval bodies on edge of disc. Height of the largest specimen seen \\( 3\\frac{1}{4} \\) inches. Breadth 3 inches. Tentacles 1 to \\( 1\\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long, all of nearly equal length.\n\nThis handsome arborescent anemone is found on rocks in the Inner Harbour, in two or three feet of water.\n\n**Actinodendron Horologia. Kel.**\n\nBody white, with pinkish streaks. Disc depressed, circular, pale-brown, granular; a broad pale purplish circle, about midway between oral opening and tentacles, and on this ring are twelve broad purplish streaks, placed equidistant. Tentacles in three rows; short, flattened, pointed; those nearest the oral opening larger. All have tubercular granules, placed in transverse rows, from six to eight in number. Tentacles yellowish, a few white granules near edge. White tubercular lines placed in longitudinal rows on surface of body. Body when elongated about \\( 2\\frac{1}{4} \\) inches high.\n\nFound at Trincomalie, on small stones, in low-water.\n\n**Actinodendron Viridis. Kel.**\n\nBody white, with greenish streaks and rows of white granules. Disc depressed, greenish; \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch in diameter. Tentacles short, acutely pointed; granulated on edge; set in two rows. Those nearer the disc shorter, a row of larger white-spotted granules on edge of disc.\nIn height $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches; narrow at middle and base. Trumpet-shaped above.\n\nDistinguished from *Horologia* by the absence of the purple zone on disc, and from its longer tentacles. The tubercules too are less swollen, and there is a more marked space running longitudinally on tentacles.\n\nFound with its body buried in sand in the Harbour of Trincomalie.\n\n**Dioscosoma (Actinodiscus)? Zeylanica. Kel.**\n\nBody thick, short; pinkish, minutely punctulated with bright-red; near the disc the body is streaked longitudinally with closely spotted purplish lines. The body is expanded into a cup-like disc, of a bright vermillion-red colour, with radiating white lines. Disc broad, expanded, and covering the whole body, surface covered with small lines (three or four,) short, conical, truncated, tentacles, disposed in rays, running from oral opening to edge of disc, alternated with shorter ones which proceed from middle-third of disc with two other shorter ones, on each side, and the whole terminate at the margin in close compact rays. On each side of oral opening, is a semi-globular body with a central foramen, which communicates with the oviducts.\n\nThe colours of this singular form of anemone vary much; at times, it is all of a purplish-brown with greenish reflections, on other occasions the uncovered space of disc is of an earthy-brown colour, or green, and the rays of tentacles either entirely, green, or maculated with purple and white.\n\nBreadth or disc when expanded from 4 to 5 inches.\n\nIf this anemone is to be considered of a genus distinct from *Actinia*, I think of reinstating the generic term of *Actinodiscus*, given to a much smaller creature by M. Blainville, for it also, like the species of Leuckart's *Dioscosoma*, has two discs, and the animal, when waiting for its prey, is not unlike a depressed hour glass in shape. It can withdraw the superior disc within, when the red-spotted body is seen to be of a club-shaped form.\nPeacha Gossei. Kel.\n\nBody semi-carneous, covered by a brownish skin, corrugated, narrow and long. Tentacles from nineteen to twenty-one, long, narrow, and acutely pointed; either of a green colour, or purple, marked on superior surface with transverse blue or white lines, some of which are narrow-shaped. Mouth on a conical eminence. Inferior opening giving passage to ova and excrementitious matter. Length 4 or 5 inches, and about \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch broad at base, when elongated. Very active in springing; it can adhere to sand or stones.\n\nThis is, I believe, the second species known of Gosse's new genus Peacha. I have dedicated it to the original describer of the genus. Mr. Gosse's description led me to observe this species very closely, although I was at first induced to consider it a species of Edwardsia. The inferior orifice admits of the passage of a moderate sized probe. The oral orifice has not that foliated appendage described by Gosse. It is for him to determine whether this is a generic character.\n\nZoanthura.\n\nZoanthura, sp.\u2014green disc.\n\nZ. Mammalifera.\u2014brown disc.\n\nBeing now on the eve of embarkation for India, I have only time to notice the above two species of Zoanthura, which I trust will be described by other naturalists who may succeed me.\nCEYLON ENTOZOA.\n\nOrder. Parenchymata.\n\nThis order includes all those Entozoa which have the body filled with a parenchyma, or pulpy matter, either in a cellular tissue, or simply in the cavity, in which there is no alimentary apparatus to be discovered, except a few canals, which carry nourishment to all these parts. The ovaries are also imbedded in the parenchyma; there is no abdominal cavity, no intestine, and no vent; and the signs of a nervous system are few and doubtful.\u2014Cuv.\n\nFam. Tremadotea.\n\nHave the under part furnished with cup-like discs, or suckers, by which they adhere.\n\nGenus. Planaria.\n\nBody flattened, depressed. Like the Flukes (which infest the liver of sheep), they are bi-sexual. Very voracious, and will even feed upon their own species. They multiply rapidly in the ordinary way, and also by division of the body\u2014even spontaneous division as is alleged. Mutilated parts are also very readily reproduced, and a partial division of the body, will even produce an animal with two heads or two tails, according as the anterior or posterior end is cleft. Several species inhabit the fresh waters, but larger ones are met with on sea shores.\u2014Cuv.\n\nThe species herein described are all marine, found on rocks and sea-weeds in the harbour and bays of Trincomalie. They are exceedingly interesting creatures, some rivalling the tribe of Dorididae in colours. They live for a long time in the Vivarium. The mouth, situated in most of the species near the anterior third of under part of medial line, opens and dilates like that of a sea-anemone. Ova of most species white, deposited in thin flakes on rocks and sea-weed.\nFurther investigation will, I believe, lead me to separate the species into more than two genera; the majority of species correspond with M. Dug\u00e9's *Derastoma* in which there is one opening, nearer the anterior edge than in *Planaria*. The presence of tentacles, or rudimentary ones, on the anterior edge, or on the back, will also perhaps form a generic distinction. I have attached the species without any appearance of tentacular appendages to a new genus (*mihi*), *Penula*. The mouth too in this genus is placed nearer the centre of under part.\n\n**Planaria cerebralis. Kel.**\n\nRudimentary tentacles anterior, formed by two folds of the margin. Upper surface of a yellowish-brown colour and minutely streaked with fine wavy brown lines; border lined with a black line, streaked with white. Beneath, of a beautiful salmon colour. Mouth large, placed on the anterior third of lower part of body; lips white.\n\nThis is the largest species observed, nearly $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, and 3 inches broad. Ova greenish-white.\n\n**Planaria violacea. Kel.**\n\nTentacles, as in last species. Upper surface violet-purple colour, edged with bright-yellow. Median line yellowish; under parts rose coloured.\n\nAbout $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long, and $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch broad. This beautiful species, in a quiescent state, resembles some variety of pansy. Ova yellow.\n\n**Planaria viridis. Kel.**\n\nTentacles folded; green, spotted brown; edge dark grizzly brown. Under parts paler.\n\nAbout $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long.\nPlanaria armata. Kel.\n\nTentacles folded, but more distinctly formed. Upper surface of a dark-purple colour, covered with short, black spines. Beneath pale-purple, smooth. About $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long, and nearly $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch broad.\n\nPlanaria papilionis. Kel.\n\nTentacles as in last species, black, white tipped. Upper surface yellow, covered with small black spines. Beneath pale-yellow. Margin whitish.\n\nLength about 1 inch.\n\nVery like a butterfly moving in the water.\n\nPlanaria purpurea. Kel.\n\nTentacles rudimentary. Upper surface of a beautiful purple-colour; beneath paler purple.\n\nAbout $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long.\n\nPlanaria fusca. Kel.\n\nUpper surface dusky-brown. Beneath paler brown.\n\nAbout $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long.\n\nPlanaria elegans. Kel.\n\nTentacles red, situated on the anterior third of mantle, Upper surface pale-yellow, shaded with greenish brown, black dots; margin black, lined with orange. Beneath whitish.\n\nLength $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch.\n\nPlanaria thesea. Kel.\n\nTentacles white, with red tips, rising from depressions, or cups, placed near the middle third of body. Upper surface of a chocolate-brown colour, edge yellow. Mouth in the middle, below genital organs. Beneath pale-purple.\n\nLength $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch.\nPlanaria striata. Kel.\n\nTentacles rudimentary. Upper surface brownish-purple, streaked with brown. Beneath pale orange-brown.\n\nLength 2\u00bd inches.\n\nPlanaria meleagrina. Kel.\n\nTentacles of an oval form. Medial line reddish, edged with a black line, the rest striped with broad white and light purplish streaks; margin waved and edged with black. Length 1\u00bd inch. There are two linear appendages on neck, above-eye spots.\n\nPlanaria undulata. Kel.\n\nTentacles rudimentary. In medial line purplish, the rest pale-yellow, with undulating lines and spots of purplish-brown; margin purplish. Length 2 inches.\n\nPlanaria aurea. Kel.\n\nTentacles two, simple; pointed, rising from the anterior third of body. Upper surface golden and speckled with white and brown.\n\nNearly 2\u00bd inches long.\n\nNo drawing made of this species.\n\nPlanaria dulcis. Kel.\n\nTentacles rudimentary. Body brown in the medial line, the rest light-green, minutely spotted with reddish brown. Margin white.\n\nLength 1 inch.\n\nPlanaria zeylanica. Kel.\n\nTentacles rudimentary. Upper surface of a dark purplish chocolate colour; margin white, with an internal adjoining orange and black line. Beneath paler.\n\nLength 2\u00bd inches, and 1\u00bd inch broad.\n\nVery abundant in months of May and June. Ova white.\nGenus. *Penula*, n. g. Kel.\n\nAnimal gelatinous, flattened like *Planaria*, but without any appearance of tentacular appendages. Mouth placed beneath, near the central third of body. Eye spots on anterior third of back.\n\nRuppel figures one species of this form in his work on Abyssinia.\n\n*Penula ocellata*. Kel.\n\nUpper surface pale yellowish-brown, with dark-brown ocellated spots. Beneath, pale-buff. Length 2 inches.\n\n*Penula punctata*. Kel.\n\nWhite. Above minutely punctulated with reddish-brown.

Ova of all the species whitish. Several other species, I have no doubt, will be yet obtained from Ceylon.\n\nAs these pages are going through the press, I have returned from Calcutta, and I am now preparing for the Pearl Fishery at Aripo, where I hope to obtain many curious forms of Zoophytes.\nACCOUNT OF THE WORKS OF IRRIGATION CONSTRUCTED BY KING PAR\u00c1KRAMA B\u00c1HU, CONTAINED IN THE SIXTY-EIGHTH AND SEVENTY-NINTH CHAPTERS OF THE MAH\u00c1-WA\u1e46SO, WITH INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\n\nBY LOUIS DE ZOYSA, MUDALIY\u00c1R.\n\nThe following extracts from the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so, having reference to works of Irrigation executed in the reign of Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu I., (A.D. 1153\u20141186), may not prove altogether devoid of interest, in connection with the very able and interesting Papers on the subject of ancient irrigation in Ceylon, recently published by order of Government. The Sovereign alluded to is the celebrated Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu the Great, the constructor of the \"Sea of Par\u00e1krama,\" the invader of India and Burma; and whose reign Mr. Turnour characterizes as \"the most martial, enterprising, and glorious in Sinhalese History.\"\n\nThe first extract is the 68th Chapter of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so, and contains an account of the efforts made by Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu to promote the cultivation of rice, on his assuming the government of the Pihiti-ra\u1e6da* under the title of Mah\u00e1di\n\n---\n\n* The ancient divisions of Ceylon were:\u2014Pihiti-ra\u1e6da, bounded on the west, north, and east, by the sea; on the south by the Mah\u00e1weli-ganga, and D\u00e9duru-oya rivers; it was also sometimes called R\u00e1ja-ra\u1e6da as the ancient capitals were situated in it: Ruhunu-ra\u1e6da, bounded on the west and north by the Mah\u00e1weli-ganga, and Ka\u1e37u-ganga (or Ka\u1e37utara) rivers, and on the east and south by the sea. The mountainous portion of it was called Malaya-ra\u1e6da: M\u00e1ya-ra\u1e6da, bounded on the north by the D\u00e9duru-oya, on the east by the Mah\u00e1weli-ganga and the mountains, on the south by the Ka\u1e37u-ganga, and on the west by the sea.\"\u2014Turnour's Ceylon Almanac, 1834, p. 57.\np\u00e1do or sub-king. The second extract is a part of the concluding Chapter of the reign of the same monarch, and gives a summary account of the principal public works executed during his government. It consists of 87 verses, of which the first 24 relate to the formation of extensive gardens and plantations; the next 26 to the construction of tanks and canals; and the last 27 to the erection of various public buildings, such as d\u00e1gabas, image houses, preaching halls, inns or houses for strangers, libraries, theatres, &c. I have only translated the verses relating to tanks; those which have reference to canals and water-courses having already been translated and published by Mr. Turnour in the Ceylon Almanac for 1834.\n\nI have not thought it necessary to add any comments of my own, by way of illustrating the translation; but I may perhaps be permitted to say a word in reference to the information which a passage in the first extract gives respecting the \"Sea of Par\u00e1krama,\" to which so much attention has lately been drawn by the publication of that valuable contribution to the ancient history of Ceylon,\u2014the \"Report on the Ellahara Canal, by Messrs. Adams, Churchill and Bailey.\"\n\nAs stated by these gentlemen, \"the situation of the 'Sea of Par\u00e1krama' has never hitherto been satisfactorily ascertained.\"\n\nTurnour states (vide Ceylon Almanac of 1834, p. 68) that \"the 'Sea of Par\u00e1krama' with its embankments of many outlets is yet unknown, or at least unnoticed.\"\n\nMajor Forbes indeed surmised that the series of lakes connected by the Ellahara Canal, might be the waters to which the vanity of a King gave his own name, but he adds, that \"until this canal shall have been traced through the Konduruwawe hills, the extent and difficulty of such an undertaking must excite doubts whether it were successfully accomplished.\"\n\nThe explorers of the Ellahara Canal were, however, the first who declared their belief, that the series of tanks connected by this canal were the waters which bore the name of the \"Sea of Par\u00e1krama.\"\nIt does not, however, appear that this opinion is corroborated by the Mah\u00e1wapso, since in a passage in the 68th chapter, mention is made of a particular tank, which was afterwards called the \"Sea of Par\u00e1krama.\"\n\nThe passage alluded to is the following:\n\nAtiwa khuddakan pubb\u00e9 Pandaw\u00e9p\u00edsccha k\u00e1riya,\nSapwaddhituchohst\u00e1y\u00e1ma witth\u00e1retthira p\u00e1likan,\nAbbhunnata mah\u00e1w\u00e1rip\u00e1ta\u00f1 sajala niggaman,\nParakkama samuddoti, wohar\u00e1\u00f1ch\u00e1bh\u00edropayi.\n\n\"Moreover, having made P\u00e1nda-w\u00e1pi\" (Panda tank), which was formerly very small indeed, (into one) containing a body of water great and exceedingly lofty, having outlets for the water, and an embankment of greatly increased height, length, breadth, and strength, he gave it the name of the 'Sea of Par\u00e1krama.'\"\n\n* [It is somewhat remarkable that the above important passage in the Mah\u00e1wapso should have escaped Mr. Turnour's researches, since he gives the following account of the outlets from the \"Sea of Par\u00e1krama,\" which is quoted by the authors of the Report of the Ellahara Canal. \"The King [Par\u00e1krama] formed the deep canal called the Makara-gangga, which flowed from the Makara outlet of the sea of Par\u00e1krama; from the same sea, the great canal Hema-wat\u00ed flowing to the Mah\u00e1-megha-wana. From the outlet called S\u00e1manmal, the canal distinguished by the name of N\u00edla-w\u00e1na: flowing from the outlet called the K\u00edl\u00e1-karu-udy\u00e1na the Salalawatt\u00ed Canal: flowing from the outlet celebrated under the name of W\u00e1itra-wat\u00ed, the Waitra-wat\u00ed Great Canal: from the southern outlet, the Tugga-badsa Canal: flowing from the Maggala outlet, the Mangala-ganga Canal flowing from the eastern outlet, the Champa Canal; flowing from the same sea to the P\u00farnawardhana Tank, the Saraswat\u00ed Canal: flowing westward of that (Saraswat\u00ed) canal, the Wequmat\u00ed Canal.\" No less than ten outlets are here enumerated, as formed by the King to convey, in different directions, the accumulated waters of the tank named after himself. Of these, four appear from their names and description to have been much larger than the rest. The identification of \"the Sea of Par\u00e1krama,\" therefore, seems to depend upon the discovery, in Padavil-kulam, or any other of the large tanks, of ten outlets corresponding with those mentioned in the above extract.\u2014Ed. Ceylon Almanac, 1857, in which work this article was by permission inserted.]\nI am not prepared to say what particular tank is meant by *Panda-w\u00e1pi*, in this passage, as I have not been able to meet with any information, either in the Mah\u00e1wapso or in any other work, which would enable me to identify it with any degree of certainty. The name *Panda-w\u00e1pi* occurs but twice in the previous part of the Mah\u00e1wapso. King Mah\u00e1d\u00e1thiko Mah\u00e1 N\u00e1go is said to have bestowed the \"*Panda-w\u00e1pi Vih\u00e1ra,*\" i.e. 'the Panda Tank Vih\u00e1ra,' on a certain S\u00e1manero, which proves the existence of a tank of that name so early as A.D. 8. (vide Turnour's translation of the Mah\u00e1wapso, p. 214.) The next reference to *Panda-w\u00e1pi* is in the 60th Chapter of the Mah\u00e1wapso, in which it is mentioned as one of the tanks constructed, or prepared, by King Wijaya B\u00e1hu I., who reigned at Polonnaruwa A.D. 1071\u20141126. I am, however, inclined to think that we may recognize the *Panda-w\u00e1pi* of the Mah\u00e1wapso in the modern *Padavi*, or *Padavil-kulam* of the Wanni district.\n\nThe reasons which have led me to form this conjecture are, first, the similarity, or rather the identity, of the names; for the P\u00e1li word *Do\u03b8, w\u00e1pi*, and the Tamil word *\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bae\u0bcd, kulam*, erroneously spelt *Colom*, both mean 'tank' so that in fact the P\u00e1li term *Panda-w\u00e1pi* is an equivalent for the Tamil, *Panda*\n\n---\n\n* As this part of the Mah\u00e1wapso has not been translated into English, I annex a translation of the verses relating to works of irrigation in this reign.\n\n\"The tanks of Mahaheli, Sareheru, Mah\u00e1 Danta, Katunnaru, Panda-w\u00e1pi, Kallagalla, Eran\u1e0dagalla, D\u00edghawatthu, Mandaw\u00e1\u1e6da, Kittaggabodhi Pabbata, Wal\u00e1hassa Mah\u00e1d\u00e1ragalla, Kumbh\u00edlasobbha, Pattap\u00e1s\u00e1na, and K\u00e1\u1e47aw\u00e1pi, as well as many other tanks whose embankments had been in ruins, did the King build (and repair,) ever intent on the welfare of the poor. The ruler of the land having constructed embankments (to prevent inundation) in many rivers, streams, in various parts (of the Island) rendered the country abundant in food. Having also constructed the canal Tillawathu, which had been in ruins, he filled the tank of Ma\u1e47ihira (Minnery) with water.\"\u2014Vide 60th Chapter of the Mah\u00e1wapso.\nor *Pandi-kulam,* which may have been corrupted into *Padavi* or *Padavil-kulam*; secondly, the stupendous size and magnitude of the work.\n\nSir Emerson Tennent, who gives an interesting account of this tank in his work entitled \"Christianity in Ceylon,\" calls it \"the largest as well as the most perfect of these gigantic works in Ceylon,\" and speaks of it in such terms as would not be inappropriate in describing such a tank as the \"Sea of Par\u00e1krama\" must have been.\n\nBut the most interesting account, as well as that which gives us the loftiest ideas of this gigantic work, is that contained in the Governor's Minute on the Eastern Province.\n\nHis Excellency says: \"It is the most wonderful work that I have yet visited, whether we look to size, difficulties of execution, or to the time at which these difficulties were surmounted...........North of these again, about 40 miles, is *Padaril-kulam,* the most gigantic work of all, for the bund, which is in perfect repair, (except at the one spot where in the course of ages the waters have forced a passage between it and the natural hills which it united,) is 11 miles long, 30 feet broad at the summit, 180 feet at the base, and 70 feet high......*Padacil-kulam,* the greater part of which I rode or walked over, was formed by the waters of the rivers Mora-oya and Muri-gunu-oya, confined to the plain, by the enormous bund which I have just described. Its construction must have occupied a million of people for 10 or 15 years.\"\n\nThe most satisfactory way of settling the question as to the identity of this tank, would probably be by obtaining a facsimile and translation of the inscription, to which Sir Emerson Tennent thus alludes in his note on the tanks already\n\"On the top of the great embankment itself, and close by the breach, there stands a tall sculptured stone, with two engraved compartments, that no doubt record its history, but the Udaiy\u0101r informed us that the characters were N\u0101gari, and the language P\u0101li, or some unknown tongue which no one can now read.\"\n\nI have only to add, that my object in submitting the accompanying translation is by no means to advance any hypothesis of my own on this subject, but simply to put parties competent to decide on the point in possession of the data contained in the hitherto untranslated part of the Mah\u0101wapso, and especially to aid the investigations of those gentlemen whose meritorious labours have already invested the subject with so great an interest.\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nThis Sovereign of lofty aspirations, who was well acquainted with foreign countries, thus thought within himself:\n\n\"In what well-governed kingdom is the administration of affairs conducted without obtaining a knowledge of its means?\n\n\"The object of my sovereignty is the advancement of the prosperity of Religion and the State, having vanquished all enemies. This kingdom, although very small, being filled with great prosperity, I shall by the superiority of my wisdom, soon bring into such a state as that it will surpass the greatness of other kingdoms.\n\n\"Conferring appointments on my officers, whose advancement is identical with my own, according to their respective merits rewarding them with honors and wealth; causing my own people to settle in various parts within my dominions, from the mountain Samanta-k\u016b\u1e6da (Adam's Peak) as far as the sea coast, the cultivation of grain should be carried on in as many ways as possible.\"\n\nHaving thus reflected, the King thus addressed his officers:\n\n\"In my kingdom are many paddy fields cultivated by means of rain water, but few indeed are those which are cultivated by means of perennial streams and great tanks.\"\n\"By rocks, and by many thick forests, by great marshes is the land covered.\n\n\"In such a country, let not even a small quantity of water obtained by rain, go to the sea, without benefiting man.\n\n\"Paddy fields should be formed in every place, excluding those only that produce gems, gold, and other precious things.\n\n\"It does not become persons in our situation to live enjoying our own ease, and unmindful of the interests of the people. And ye all, be ye not discouraged, when a necessary, but a difficult work is on hand. Regard it not indeed as a work of difficulty, but following my advice accomplish it, without opposing my instructions.\"\n\nThe highly renowned Monarch then ordered the construction of the great embankment celebrated under the name of Kotha-baddha, which had long been swept away by the action of the river, leaving behind nothing but the name, and which indeed had baffled the attempts of former Kings to keep in repair.\n\nWhereupon the ministers, one and all, represented in various ways the extreme difficulty of the work, and the instability of it, even if it could be accomplished.\n\nThe King rejecting their counsels, remarked:\u2014\"What is there that cannot be done in this world by men of perseverance? Is not the tradition still current that R\u00e1ma built a bridge over the great ocean itself, by means of monkeys?\"\n\n\"If I am destined by fortune, to reduce this Island under one regal canopy, and to promote the welfare of the State and Religion, then, indeed, will the commencement of the work see the accomplishment of it also.\"\n\nThus did he of great courage inspire his ministers with courage.\n\nBefore the construction of the embankment, however, the profoundly wise ruler of the land made, from the mouth of the embankment, as far as the country of Ratthakara, a great canal of great breadth and strength, and of many p\u00f3riras \u2020 in depth.\n\nThe Protector of the land, having assembled a great many stone cutters, workers in metal, iron-smiths and gold-smiths in the country, and having\n\n---\n\n* In reference to the fable in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, that R\u00e1ma, the conqueror of R\u00e1wans, in crossing over from India to Ceylon, caused a bridge to be built over the sea, by his army of W\u00e1naras or monkeys. The reef of sunken rocks which extends across the Gulf of Mann\u00e1r from R\u00e1misseram on the coast of Coromandel to Talaimann\u00e1r on the coast of Ceylon, is supposed to be the remains of this bridge.\n\n\u2020 \"The measure of a man's reach.......Equal to the height, to which he reaches, when elevating both arms with fingers extended.\" (See Colebrook's Amarakosha, p. 160.)\nemployed them in the work of cutting stones, got made by them an embankment of great stability and solidity, having the interstices of the stones invisible, like one continued sheet of rock, and having the work of plastering complete.\n\nOn the summit of the great embankment, the pious R\u00e1j\u00e1 placed a B\u00f2 tree, an image house, and likewise a d\u00e1gaba.\n\nThe King, by means of this canal, so directed the course of the stream as to make it discharge itself into the sea.\n\nHaving cleared the great jungle on both sides of the canal, he formed paddy fields of many thousands of W\u00e1has\u00b0 of extent and converted the place in truth into a Kotthabaddha, according to the literal meaning of the term, from the fact of its having Kotthabaddhas,\u00b0 'perpetual granaries,' from the two P\u00e1li words kottha, 'granary,' and abaddha, 'perpetual.'\n\nThereafter the King having dammed up the mouths of the rivers Sankhawaddham\u00e1na, and Kumbhilaw\u00e1na, as far as the Sukara Nijjhara\u2020 (literally 'hog-cascade,' or 'stream'); and there too, having made a canal, and conducting the water into the tank of Mah\u00e1l\u00e1ragalla, thoroughly repairing, at the same time, the breaches thereof, including the clearing of the water-courses, (thus) brought it into a larger body of water than it had before, and having formed paddy fields from this place as far as the Sukara Nijjhara, collected paddy.\n\n\u00b0 According to the P\u00e1li Nigh\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0du of Moggallana.\n\n4 N\u00e9lis make 1 Lahasa (or Kuru\u1e47i\n4 Lahas ,, 1 Dro\u1e47a\n4 Dro\u1e47as ,, 1 Marika\n4 Marikas ,, 1 Kh\u00e1ri or Amupam\n20 Kh\u00e1ris ,, 1 W\u00e1ha\n\n\u2020 This is no doubt the Kotta-vella of Brook.

The reason the inhabitants assign for this, is want of people, and money to keep them in order. (Route from M\u00e1tale to Trincomalie, by way of the Ambay-ganga, by R.

The Ruler of the land constructed conduits, and channels of stone, in no less than 300 tanks which had been in ruins.\n\nThe King also repaired many ancient tanks, such as the great tank of Masihira (Minnery,) the tank of Mah\u00e1d\u00e1ragalla, the tank of Suvannatissa, D\u00faratissa, and those named K\u00e1la-w\u00e1pi (Kalaweewa,) and Br\u00e1hmanagama. The tanks called Nilik\u00e9rathamba, and Rehera, likewise the tanks of Giritalia, and Kumbhila Sobba. The tanks of Kana-w\u00e1pi, P\u00e1di and Katigama, the tank of Pattap\u00e1s\u00e1na, the tank of Mahan\u00e1na, the tank of Mahan\u00e1mamattaka, the tank of Waggdhana, and the tank of Mahadanta, the tank of Kanagama, and the tanks of Wira, and Walahassa, and that called Suram\u00e1na, the tanks of P\u00e1s\u00e1nagama, K\u00e1lavalli, and K\u00e1halli, and those named Angagama, Hillapattakkanda, and Madagu. These tanks which had been in ruins, did the King restore to their former condition, as well as others of less note, in number 467.\n\nIn about one thousand three hundred and ninety-five tanks, did the king, who was a proficient in matters of State, effect repairs and improvements.\n\n[For the remainder of this Chapter, see Ceylon Almanac, 1834.]\n\n---\n\n* This is either a clerical mistake, or there were more than one \"Sea of Par\u00e1krama.\" While on this subject, I may here notice a very curious passage in the R\u00e1ja Ratn\u00e1kara, which speaks of the construction by Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, of three great tanks known by the names \"Mah\u00e1 Samudraya,\" \"Bana Samudraya,\" and \"Mati\" or \"Mani S\u00e1gara.\"\n\nThis passage is translated by Upham as follows:\u2014\"The said king of Ceylon also rendered his fame great by causing to be made in Ceylon three great lakes, the first of which was called Mah\u00e1 Samudra (i.e. allied to the sea,) and the third was called Meda S\u00e1garaya (i.e. the middling sea.)\"\n\nIt is however, right to add, that this passage is not found in the Saddharma Ratn\u00e1kara, from which the author of R\u00e1ja Ratn\u00e1kara, has copied, almost verbatim, the events of this reign. Nor indeed is such a passage found in any other work on Ceylon, which I have seen.\nTOPOGRAPHICAL AND STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF THE DISTRICT OF NUWARAKAL\u00c1WIYA.\n\nBY A. OSWALD BRODIE, ESQ.\n\nThe district of Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya may be described as that portion of Ceylon which is included in the following lines:\n\nI. One running from a point one mile north of Dambulla to another about five and twenty miles west of Trincomalie.\n\nII. A second from the last mentioned spot to the ninety-fifth mile post south of Jaffna.\n\nIII. A third running thence to within six miles of Arippu.\n\nIV. A fourth proceeding thence south-south-east to a place about twelve miles west of Pomparrippu.\n\nV. A fifth joining this last mentioned point with that near Dambulla.\n\nThe area of the district is about 2,900 square miles.\n\nAccording to the last census returns (1852) the population is only 32,103, but this is manifestly erroneous, as there are 10,910 persons liable to the road tax, and the number of able bodied persons cannot well be more than one-fifth of the community. As all these returns are more or less erroneous, (giving the numbers too small, as the headmen persist in omitting numbers of women and children,) we may safely reckon the population at about fifty-five or sixty thousand.\n\nThe number of houses appear to be 9,804, which would give $3\\frac{1}{9}$th persons to each house, but it must be observed, that headmen frequently apply the term \"house\" to a range of contiguous dwellings.\nThe district on the whole is flat, not, indeed, flat in the same sense as the land near Mannar, Jaffna, &c., is flat, but it is not in any sense mountainous; the general surface consists of gentle undulations, and here and there isolated peaks or short ranges of hills appear. These are most common in lines north-east and south-west of Dambulla, and within twenty or thirty miles of that place, elsewhere they are of rarer occurrence and of less elevation. To the north, south, and south-west, of the station, hills entirely disappear. The southern part of the district forms in fact the extreme northern verge of the great central mountain mass of Ceylon, and the isolated hills are outliers thereof.\n\nThe whole face of the country, except where occupied by fields or tanks, is clothed by dense forest; and a large tract lying to the south, south-east, and south-west, of the station is almost uninhabited. This arises in part from a want of water, and in part, as has been remarked, from the policy of the ancient rulers of the Island, who interposed this barrier between themselves and the marauders who were wont to infest the maritime districts. There is yet another circumstance which probably has not been without its influence: I refer to the intense dislike which the villagers have, to contact with strangers. So strongly does this feeling still exist, that we have even now to take the greatest care not to bring roads too near to villages, as in this case the people invariably abandon their dwellings, and migrate to some neighbouring, but more secluded, spot.\n\nThe prevalent rock is gneiss, the colour and structure of which vary considerably in different localities. It is frequently traversed by veins of quartz and felspar; but no circumstance of interest connected with these has attracted my notice. This gneiss here, as elsewhere, has a tendency to exfoliate in layers concentric to the present surfaces, the plates which thus scale off are of all thicknesses, from two feet downwards. This peculiarity renders it a matter of ease to split off tolerably regular pillars and slabs, and there can be no doubt that this circumstance has had a very considerable influence on the character of the national or adopted architecture.\nImbedded in the gneiss, at various places, one finds magnesian limestone, generally of a brilliant white colour and of a coarse crystalline structure; occasionally it contains crystals of hornblende, and also orange-red spots, the composition of which I have not ascertained. The stone bears a good polish, and I am now trying it for flooring, a purpose for which it will, I think, be found well adapted, being clean, cool, cheerful looking, enduring, and ornamental. It is only within the last couple of years that the majority of the localities where this mineral occurs has been ascertained, and the discovery happened most opportunely, as numerous public works are in progress or contemplation. Hitherto lime has been brought from Arippu, a distance of forty-four miles.\n\nIn the early part of this year, I discovered in the bed of the Kalu-\u0101r, about six miles east of \"The Doric,\" a number of fossil shells and corals converted into a beautiful semi-transparent amber-coloured mass; the associated nodules of variegated chert also contain numerous petrifactions and casts. I was unable to examine the beds at leisure, and therefore only obtained mutilated specimens, but judging from these, I should think that these limestone strata belong not to the present, but to the tertiary formation.\n\nOn a late circuit Mr. Quinton pointed out to me considerable quantities of a dark, heavy, metalliferous stone, which has all the outward appearance of furnace slag. The native tradition is, that it is the refuse from the forges of giants who lived of old; but as I have since found it in many places, and as Mr. Quinton tells me that it is common over a large part of the Mullaittivu district, I am inclined to hope that it may be a natural product, and have instituted inquiries into the matter.\n\nThe soil of the district is generally of a reddish hue, occasionally intensely so, but, where liable to inundation, whether natural or artificial, it is darker and richer. Potter's clay is abundant, but so far as I know, none of it is adapted to the manufacture of the finer kinds of earthenware. The soil, on the whole, is not unfavorable to cultivation.\nThere are no natural lakes nor thermal springs in the district, nor are there any perennial rivers. The following are the principal streams, which in the wet season contain large bodies of water.\n\n1. The Dambulu and Mirisg\u00f3ni-oyas, take their rise near Dambulla, and with some others of less importance, empty themselves into the great Kal\u00e1wewa tank; their united waters on leaving this assume the name of Kal\u00e1-oya, which for many miles forms the boundary between this district and Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and ultimately falls into the sea near Pomparappu.\n\n2. Kalankutti-ela and Siyambalangamu-oya, are tributaries of the former, which take their rise some fifteen miles west of Dambulla, and also form, for some miles, the limit between the same two first mentioned districts.\n\n3. The Malwatu-oya; one branch takes its rise from the great \u00c9ruwewa tank, is called there Gal-oya, and a little lower down Karunagala-oya; a second branch rises from the foot of Ri\u1e6digala-kanda (the first hill in Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya) and joins the former a little to the east of the Central road. The united stream flows into the deserted tank of N\u00e1chcha-d\u00fawa, which gives it a local name. Still lower down, that is, in the neighbourhood of Anur\u00e1dhapura, the river is called Malwatu-oya, and flowing to the west-north-west falls into the Kanadar\u00e1-oya, two miles south of Kapp\u00e1chchi in the Mann\u00e1r district.\n\n4. The Kanadar\u00e1-oya, of which there are two great branches, the Sangili Kanadar\u00e1, taking its rise in K\u00e9nd\u00e9 K\u00f3ral\u00e9, and Mah\u00e1 Kanadar\u00e1-oya, in Kanadar\u00e1 K\u00f3ral\u00e9. These unite about three and a half miles west of the central road, and this united stream falls ultimately into the sea, near Arippu, under the name of Aruvi-\u00e1r or P\u00e1r-\u00e1r.\n\n5. The B\u00fa-oya or Pi-\u00e1r, rises in Kadawat K\u00f3ral\u00e9, forms for some distance the northern limit of this district, and finally joins the Aruvi-\u00e1r.\n\n6. The Y\u00e1n-oya has its source in the great Hurulu-wewa, and falls into the sea between Trincomalie and K\u00f3kil\u00e9, being known there as the Kallu-\u00e1r.\nThough the whole district is covered with jungle, the quantity of useful timber is surprisingly small. In fact this remark is applicable to Ceylon generally, to a much greater extent than many imagine. The fact is to be attributed, mainly, to the great development of the chena system of cultivation, which is hereafter noticed.\n\nThe Dutch were, with regard to the protection of timber, and also in some other respects, much more provident than the English have shewn themselves; they planted teak forests\u2014we sell them for a tythe of their value, and then import timber from abroad.\n\nThe most valuable timber trees of the district are the following:\u2014Palu, Halmilila, Milila, Satinwood, *Sweitenia chloroxylon*\u2014the Buruta and Wiranda of the natives, Kubuk or Kumbuk (*Terminalia alata,*), Tammann\u00e9, Migaha (*Bassia longifolia,*), Kiri K\u00f3n, Ebony.\n\nOf cultivated trees we have the following:\n\nCocoanut (*Cocos nucifera*), which does not succeed nearly so well as in the maritime districts. The produce does not by any means equal the demand; the usual rate of exchange is two cocoanuts for one scer of rice. Palmyra palm (*Borassus flabelliformis*); not common, and little prized. Talipot (*Corypha umbraculifera*); seldom met with, except in the south-east part of the district. Jack; rare, though in some villages it bears readily. Mango; very rare.\n\nOf the smaller fruit-bearing trees and plants, the following are to be met with in gardens; orange, lime, papaw, pine-apple, murunga, pomegranate, plantain, brinjal, (*Solanum melongena*); bandakka, (*Abelmoschus esculentus*); tampal\u00e1, (*Amaranthus*); pat\u00f3la, or snake-gourd (*Trichosanthus anguina*); besides a few varieties of gourd, melon, and bean. On none of these is the least care bestowed, and the produce is in every respect inferior.\nThe following are some of the plants which I have introduced:\n\n| Casuarin\u00e6. | Dwarf cocoanut. |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| Sissu.    | Double pomegranate. |\n| Logwood.  | Various species of stramonium. |\n| American sumach. | Do. plumbago. |\n| Bourbon and New Orleans cotton. | Do. roses. |\n| Madagascar plum. | Do. plantains and bananas. |\n| Nam-nam.  | Teak. |\n| Leetchee. | Myrtle: with numerous ornamental plants. |\n| Cape cabbage. | |\n| Travellers-tree. | |\n| Date.     | |\n\nFor these I am chiefly indebted to Mr. Dyke, Agent for the Province; to his Assistant, Mr. Twynam; to Mr. Thwaites, Superintendent of the Royal Botanical Gardens, and to A. Y. Adams, Esq., of Petula.\n\nOf all these before mentioned plants, the natives are encouraged to take seeds, slips or roots.\n\n**Produce of District.**\n\nThe staple product of the district is paddy, grown in the manner usual throughout the low country, that is, in low, gently sloping lands, irrigated from artificial tanks, some of which are many miles in extent.\n\nEach village is settled by a little colony, headed by two or more leaders or elders, called *Gamar\u00e1las*.\n\nAfter the ground has been cleared of jungle, a line is stretched down its length, then measuring from the bank, marks are put in, say at every ten fathoms, and each portion is given to a villager. If the soil varies greatly in the upper and lower parts of the field, or if one of these be for any reason preferable to the other, then each villager (\"shareholder,\" or \"partner,\" is the common term) will get one share in the upper, and one in the lower part, of the field.\n\nTo the *Gamar\u00e1las* a double portion is given, in consideration of their superior position as village elders. It is to be observed,\nthat every shareholder has a right to all the land enclosed within lines running across the field and passing through the two stakes on the centre line which originally marked out his portion; that is, each man, commencing within his own portion at the centre line, may clear to the right and left till he reaches the high grounds which enclose the field; but quarrels would instantly arise if he were to clear either up or down, as it were, round the share of another. So soon as a share is allotted to a man, no matter whether he clears much or little, he comes under certain obligations; he must give one share of work to all repairs of the tank, and to the watching of the fields by night, and to the construction and up-keep of a ring fence. The original division is never lost sight of; thus, if two shares, even though they be contiguous, fall into the possession of one man, he will never talk of having \"one large share,\" but of having \"two shares,\" and will give two shares' work to watching, fencing, and repairing of the tank; so it is also with half or quarter shares.\n\nThe first and last shares, those at which the channel from the tank enters and leaves the field, are generally less productive than others. For this reason, and also because there is a larger quantity of fencing there, these shares, called the ihal\u0101 and pahala elapa\u1e6da (shares at the upper and lower water-courses) respectively, are invariably larger than the rest.\n\nIt frequently happens, that either before or after sowing, it is found that the supply of water will not be sufficient to irrigate the whole field; in such cases the people resort to a practice called betma or \"division.\" A portion of the field, of suitable size, is selected, and all the rest is abandoned. The selected portion is now divided into the same number of equal shares as there are original shares in the whole field, and every original shareholder gets one betma share for each original share in the whole field; and this in no way depends on the amount which he has cleared in his original share. Thus, suppose a man through idleness has not cleared any of the ground allotted to him, but has yet given, when required, labour to fencing, watching, and repair of tank, then when betma is\nresorted to, he will be entitled to a betma share, equal to that of his neighbours. It is to be observed, that the persons whose land is thus selected, do not get larger allotments than others. Frequently, the selected portion of land is worked in common, and the produce divided among the peasants according to the number of shares which they hold in their own right; at other times, it is actually subdivided, and each reaps the produce of the portion allotted to him, just as if it were his own ground.\n\nEach such betma arrangement is binding only for one crop; when it has been removed, matters revert to their original position.\n\nOther customs connected with paddy cultivation, are as follows:\n\nIf a man's betma share is denied to him, then he has a right to demand a supply of water for his original share; if he insists upon this, it would in many cases happen that both his and his neighbours' crops would die; an amicable arrangement is therefore generally made.\n\nIf a man refuses to give his due share of work or money to the repair of the work, he cannot lead water to his field till he has repaid those who laboured for him.\n\nIf owing to neglect, as to fencing or watching, cattle or elephants damage the crops, then the man in fault must make good the loss.\n\nIf a man, after being warned that his cattle tresspass, fails to yoke them two and two, or else to tie cross bars to their necks, he is liable for all damage which they do.\n\nIf shareholders neglect to cultivate their fields for any particular crop, then those who do cultivate are entitled to select and to cultivate contiguous lands equal in extent to their own; the object of this is to lighten the labour of watching, fencing, and irrigation, which would become very harassing if the cultivated portions of the field were isolated.\n\nSeveral of these rules appear to me admirably adapted for the people and country. The people are naturally lazy;\nhere are stimulants. They are poor, and have not a sufficiency of wholesome food; here is security for the land being cultivated by some one.\n\nThere are certain privileges attached to each village, as for example, the collection of honey throughout all the jungle attached to it; one-half of the game killed; one out of every two tusks \"bagged\" in these; and the right of fishing the tank. All these rights give rise to constant squabbles.\n\nThe chief varieties of paddy cultivated in the District are:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Dik-vi} & \\\\\n\\text{Ilankaliyan} & \\quad \\text{in virgin soil.} \\\\\n\\text{Mah\u00e1-vi} & \\quad \\text{for t\u00e1valu, as it does not die though overflowed.} \\\\\n\\text{El-vi (sudu and kalu \"white\" and \"black,\")} & \\\\\n\\text{Kuru-vi.} & \\\\\n\\text{Hina\u021bi.} & \\\\\n\\text{Murunga-vi.} &\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThese vary in colour, size and taste. Their most important distinction, however, refers to the length of time which they require for attaining maturity; some take three, some four, some six months.\n\nThere are two crops annually; that sown in December and reaped in March or April, gives the Yala-m\u00f3sama in August and September. Occasionally, when the weather is favourable, and the preceding harvest has been lost, a crop is taken between the intervals, and is simply called \"a between two years crop\" d\u0113curudda atar\u00e9 m\u00f3sama.\n\nThe return from paddy fields according to the reports of the headmen, varies from four to ten-fold; but there can be no doubt that the crop is frequently much heavier than this would induce one to suppose.\n\nAnother method of cultivating paddy is called taw\u00e1l\u016b; in this case the margins of the tanks themselves are cultivated, and the water for irrigation is raised by means of scoops, such as are in use at salt pans. This system gives larger returns\nthan field cultivation, but the requisite labour is greater, therefore it is not in favour with the Sinhalese; the Moormen carry it on to a considerable extent.\n\nA third system of paddy cultivation is on elevated ground, so called, high lands, in exactly the same way as other ch\u00e9na crops are grown; in this case irrigation is not applicable, and the crop is totally dependant for moisture on the natural fall of rain. The return is large, but the risk of losing one's labour is great.\n\nI am sorry to say, that the general food of the people is not rice, but kurakkan (Eleusine coracana) which is grown in ch\u00e9nas. These are pieces of land on which the smaller trees and brushwood are cut down and burnt, the thicker branches are in this way merely charred, and being piled round the enclosure, form a tolerably good fence. The seed is sown broadcast, and then covered slightly by aid of that useful implement, the mamotie. A man can sow and cover about a seer of kurakkan seed in a day. It rarely occurs that more than two crops are taken from one ch\u00e9na; after the last of these has been removed, the jungle is allowed to grow up, and is not again cut till after the lapse of from five to fifteen years. It is evident that this system must prove most destructive to timber, as new land is cleared every year.\n\nIn these ch\u00e9nas various other plants, such as millet, &c.; as also varieties of gram, &c., are cultivated. One of the most useful of these, so called, fine grains, is the tala of the Sinhalese (Sesame, Sesamum Orientale,) which yields an oil used for lamps and in medicines. The price of the seed is about a penny per seer, and large quantities are sold to taxalam people from the low country, and to dealers at Trincomalie and Higgolla M\u00e1tal\u00e9. The people are fond of cultivating this plant, and if an English merchant would make arrangements for purchasing it here, or at the neighbouring ports, the cultivation might be increased to a great extent.\nCotton is also grown in ch\u00e9nas, the seed being placed in the ground along with that of kurakkan, which grows faster, and is removed ere the cotton has approached maturity. The extent of such lands are always estimated by the quantity of seed kurakkan required; and about four seers of cotton seed are sown with one of kurakkan. The cotton is sown about October, before the monsoon rains set in; the pods begin to burst in about eight months; and during the three following months the produce is gradually removed. If the plant be cut down at the close of the season, fresh shoots appear, and a second crop equal to the first is obtained, if the soil be good. From certain memora nda, collected by a predecessor about fourteen years ago, I glean the following information regarding a piece of cotton soil.\n\nIt measured eight seers of kurakkan, which, as before shewn, is equal to thirty-two of cotton. A man was employed forty days in cutting down the jungle, twenty more in lopping, and twenty-five in burning it, and removing the rubbish. The soil being good, the plants attained a height of six feet. This ch\u00e9na yielded 30 welis of cotton in the first season, and this was about four bullocks' load, worth 6s. 8d., per load. The cotton is sold with the seeds unremoved.\n\nOne person will, in a day, clear a welli from its seed, and in four days will spin it into thread. This quantity is sufficient for a piece of cloth ten cubits long, and four spans broad. A weaver will complete this in three days, and receives in payment one and a quarter parras of kurakkan, or half this quantity of paddy. It is to be observed that there is not, and never was, a tax on cotton cultivation, so the above information may be looked upon as tolerably correct. From it we learn, that, in 1838, a man's labour was freely given during at least eighty-five days to the working of a ch\u00e9na, the produce of which sold for \u00a31 6s. 8d., which would give about 3\u00bdd. per diem; but the cultivator, after reaping his kurakkan, had to watch the cotton for nearly seven months, and had to collect, dry, and pack the produce.\nAt present, the people seldom get more than 3s., for a load of cotton; this is attributed to the vast quantities of cloth now imported from India and England.\n\nBeing anxious to multiply as much as possible the varieties of plants on which the people depend, I applied for, and obtained from Government, two sacks of Bourbon and New Orleans cotton seed, which I am now distributing among the people, who, however, shew their wonted apathy on this occasion also.\n\nHigh forest land is invariably selected for cotton.\n\nTobacco, when grown at all, is only found in small gardens, containing forty or fifty plants.\n\nWith regard to ch\u00e9nas generally, it must be observed, that, unlike paddy fields, they belong not to individuals, but to villages collectively; and it is by amicable arrangements among themselves, that it is in each season arranged what portion shall be allotted to each man. As a general rule, all land from which water drains to the tanks or field of a certain village belongs to that village; and to its inhabitants is reserved the right of cutting ch\u00e9nas within the limits so defined.\n\nFor some reason, which I do not know, ch\u00e9nas are not portioned off by parallels, but by radiating lines from some central spot, such as a large tree, boulder, &c.\n\nInhabitants.\n\nThe mass of the inhabitants are Sighalese, approximating in manners, feelings, and appearance to the Highlanders, and not to the degenerate race which swarms in the maritime districts, and for whom they entertain a thorough contempt. Every man is a cultivator or proprietor of land, and I do not suppose that there is one Sighalese villager who is to any extent dependant on a trade for livelihood. Many persons are by caste mechanics, as blacksmiths, goldsmiths, washers, tom-tom beaters, &c., but the last two bodies alone devote any attention to their hereditary business, and even their reward consists not in money, but in land; thus the people of a village will give a piece of land to some dhobies on condition that they\nwash for them and attend on occasions of ceremony; so it is with tom-tom beaters. If a man wishes to get a new axe or mamotie, he first of all goes to Trincomalie, Anur\u0101dhapura or Mann\u0101r, and purchases some iron; he then prepares a quantity of charcoal, and taking these, proceeds to some neighbouring blacksmith, who is brought into good humour by the gift of some cakes, &c., and is perhaps ultimately persuaded to undertake the work, which, however, proceeds slowly and gravely, several days being occupied in working and talking about the work: all this time the applicant renders assistance to the smith. I have never been able to induce a village mechanic to settle here; they like receiving money wages, but cannot bear regular hours. Of late, in consequence of public works being commenced, a few masons and carpenters are to be found at the station; but all are strangers to the district.\n\nTo shop-keeping of every sort, the highland Siphalese have an insuperable objection, and thus it occurs that the boutiques along the roads are all occupied by Tamils, Moormen, or low-country people. It is only in such situations that boutiques are to be found. In the villages themselves they are unknown; each man grows his own paddy and kurakkan, has his own cattle, and probably cultivates a few vegetables in his garden. If he wants a new cloth, he gives the cotton from his ch\u00e9na, and also some grain by way of fee to a weaver, or else he barteres the product of his field with some passing trader.\n\nUntil of late years, bare money was almost unknown in the district, but is now becoming more common every day. In all dealings among themselves, however, the natives adhere to the system of barter. The change already referred to, may be attributed chiefly to the fact that payment of taxes in kind has been done away with, and that the taxes in themselves are heavier. I am quite aware that many persons consider it an absurdity to maintain, that people can be better off simply because they are taxed, because money is taken from them; such is, however, the simple fact. The manner in which it works is probably thus:\u2014A man knows that he will shortly have to pay to Government a couple of rupees; none of his\nneighbours will pay him for anything in cash, he therefore finds it necessary to grow something which he may sell to strangers, and he soon discovers that, *ceteris paribus*, the less bulky these goods are the better, after providing for the daily wants of himself and his family; he will therefore clear a ch\u00e9na and cultivate, say *sesame*. The produce he then removes to Trincomalie, and sells for cash. He now finds that the sum he has received is greater than the amount of tax which he must pay, and in wandering through the bazaar his fancy is struck by some gaudy handkerchief, some bright brass vessel, some china, &c.; he buys the article and returns home. The sight of these purchases gives pleasure to his household, and creates in them new desires and new wants. To gratify and relieve these, he will in the next season clear a still larger ch\u00e9na, and so the process continues. The increasing influence of money is strikingly apparent in the instance of headmen and people of family, who now care much less than heretofore about keeping up large bodies of dependents. In a paper on the statistics of the Puttalam district, which I had the honour to transmit to the Society some years ago, I shewed that the fishers there were most anxious that the now discontinued fish-tax should be renewed; and, on the whole, I believe, that at present the people ought to be comparatively heavily taxed, not indeed to such an extent as to discourage them, but to such that they may be incited to industry.\n\nThe castes are the same as those in other districts, with this exception, that there is one here not general over the Island, and which is superior to that which is elsewhere considered the highest\u2014I mean the Wanni caste, who call themselves *Wanniaru*, the latter being a mere honorific. These persons are the descendants of certain Tamils who came over from the continent in the time of R\u00e1ja Sen, who granted to each extensive tracts of land. They are very numerous here, and very troublesome, as they will not accept any inferior appointments, and for the most part think it quite beneath their dignity to educate themselves. As their claim to fill all the high offices has been rejected, they now frequently intermarry.\nwith Vell\u00e1las, and will in all probability soon be incorporated with that caste.\n\nConsiderable numbers of domesticated Ve\u1e0d\u1e0d\u00e1s are to be met with, but none of those who still retain their primitive wildness reside in the district.\n\nSix or seven villages of the Eastern division are inhabited by a set of people who have much the look of Moormen. If asked to what caste they belong, they reply: \"We are from Kurun\u00e9ga\u1e37a hab\u00e1ge.\" Their neighbours call them \"Wageyei,\" a name which they do not at all like. They do not intermarry with the people of the district, and seek for wives either in their own villages here, or in those of their comrades in Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s. They preserve a tradition, that many centuries ago their forefathers came from M\u00e1lwar, but do not know where that place is. They seem to be a sort of Duriy\u00e1s.\n\nThe Moormen or Mahomedans occupy numerous villages; they are locomotive, enterprising, fond of trade, and very deceptive. Their love of money is a perfect disease; they are more robust, intelligent, and bold than the Sinhalese, and are very much disliked and feared by them.\n\nMany individual Tamils have settled in the district, but I am not aware that any one village is exclusively occupied by them.\n\nA few Kaffres and Malays occur here; the former chiefly discharged soldiers and their offspring; the latter, people, who, as I believe, have some very good reason for living in secluded spots.\n\nTwo circumstances exercise a most beneficial effect on the people; the first, that for the last three years there has not been a single tavern in the district; the latter, that there are no resident proctors. Of course I do not mean to deny that many proctors may be good and honest men, nor that such are very useful; but it is evident that proctors who would settle in such a district as this, must be the very refuse of their profession, and such men would be a curse to the district.\nEDUCATION.\n\nAbout eighteen months ago an English school was set on foot, and is still maintained. Owing to the liberality of Government no fees are demanded from the scholars, it being considered that the people must first learn what education is, before they are asked to pay for it. The number of scholars is only 13, but when a sort of boarding house now in contemplation shall have been constructed, the number may be expected to increase considerably.\n\nA Tamil school, supported by private funds, is attended by a few scholars, but there is a constant succession of new faces;\u2014so soon as a boy can read a little and scrawl his name, he sets up a boutique.\n\nThe best effects have followed from the strict examination to which applicants for headmanship are subjected, as to their proficiency in reading, writing, and arithmetic. In the latter respect, the progress is most marked, and has been assisted by the distribution of suitable books of instruction.\n\nThis being one of the most sacred spots of Ceylon, it might be expected that I should have much to say regarding the Buddhist priesthood. This, however, is not the case; the priests here are ignorant beyond description; know nothing of their own history or religion: and though they say that they have a copy of the Mah\u0101wanso, acknowledge that they have never read it. As they do not take the slightest trouble with the people, and generally disappear until the time of the festivals approaches (at which period offerings to a large amount are brought in), the people are heartily wearied of their yoke, and if no external aid be afforded to the religion, it will soon be practically extinct.\n\nI confess to having an extremely low opinion of the Buddhist priesthood. To judge from those whom I have met (the number is not small), I think they will be found idle, selfish, inconsistent and, ex-officio, discontented.\nMEANS OF COMMUNICATION.\n\nThere are no navigable or perennial rivers, and no canals in the district; and the trade of the country will not for a long time to come justify Government in altering this state of matters. Up till the year 1845, the only road in this district was that from Mannar to Anuradhapura, along which the tappal has hitherto been carried. About the period mentioned, a sudden advance was made; a great central route passing from north to south, and opening the communication between Jaffna and Kandy, having being surveyed and cleared; others leading to Trincomalie and to Puttalam were also opened, so far as they lie within this district.\n\nThat most excellent of laws, the Road Ordinance of 1848, has here, as elsewhere, effected much good; it is only necessary to remark, that the following works have been carried out within the last three years:\n\nI. The central line between Jaffna and Kandy has received general and extensive repair.\n\nII. A substantial bridge, with three water-ways, has been constructed over the Sangili Kanadara-oya.\n\nIII. The Puttalam road has been brought into such a state of efficiency as the present nature of the traffic requires.\n\nIV. Similar improvements to the Trincomalie road have also been carried out.\n\nV. The Mannar road has received general repair, though no permanent bridges have been made.\n\nVI. A road between Madawachchi on the central, and Horowepotane on the Trincomalie road, has been surveyed, traced, and cleared throughout its whole length, though a few miles are still not available for cart traffic.\n\nVII. Another line joining Kekirawe on the central, with Maragahawewa on the Puttalam road, has been surveyed, traced, and opened, throughout about 24\u00bd miles of its course.\n\nVIII. A line joining Mabakekirawe with Horowepotane, (as abovementioned,) has also been traced.\nIX. And lastly, a line from this to the Mannar road near Adapankulam, has been surveyed, and in a great measure traced.\n\nThe whole amount collected during each year since 1850, is as follows:\n\n| Year | No. liable | Value in Money |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n|      |            | \u00a3  s. d.       |\n| 1850 | 10,117     | 758 15 6       |\n| 1851 | 10,923     | 819 5 6        |\n| 1852 | 10,910     | 818 5 0        |\n| Total... | 31,950 | 2396 5 0 |\n\nIt will be observed, that the rate of commutation fixed for six days' labour, is only 1s. 6d. This is just half of the real proportion; but this arrangement was purposely adopted, on the supposition that hired coolies do more work than statute labourers; besides which, this system enables one to concentrate one's efforts on such roads as most immediately call for attention. I think, however, that these advantages have been over-estimated, and that the rate of commutation should have been higher.\n\nOf late years, a good deal has been said about the desirability of giving to the natives Municipal privileges, and it was hinted that the Road Ordinance was but the first step in that direction. In those districts with which I am best acquainted, the hopes of the Progressists have been woefully disappointed; the people frequently not shewing the slightest interest in the elections; not recording their votes; not even taking the trouble to attend.\nThere being little trade in this district, and the people having a great dislike to strangers and to bustle, the Road Ordinance is even now far from popular; but the more intelligent villagers are becoming convinced of the advantages which it secures to them.\n\nClimate.\n\nSome one said long ago, that the climate of Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya was very deadly\u2014that the place was a second Sierra Leone; and no amount of proof to the contrary has yet dissipated this absurdly erroneous opinion. It is quite possible, that twenty or thirty years ago, fever was more prevalent than at present; but I do not know of anything to warrant the conclusion, that even at that time it was unhealthy during the greater part of the year. Situated in a vast plain, which is covered with dense wood, and in which there is a multitude of neglected tanks, the place is certainly no sanitarium, but still I think that during nine months of the year, it is fully as healthy as most stations. The unhealthy season lasts from the beginning of December till the end of February, and during this portion of the year the establishments are allowed to remove elsewhere. As the jungle around the station becomes cleared away, and as the place becomes more healthy, the furlough allowed is gradually circumscribed, and in the course of a few years, there will probably be no occasion for an annual interruption of public business. The fever of Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya is distinguished less by the violence of sudden isolated attacks, than by its insidiousness and long continuance. One is never very ill, but neither is one ever very well; one feels a general listlessness, a sensibility to the effects of draughts, which gradually debilitates one to a lamentable extent.\n\nIt is a common remark of the people, that draughts are much more common now than they used to be twenty or thirty years ago, and this is\u2014justly, as I believe,\u2014attributed to the great extension of the ch\u00e9na system, whereby pools, springs, and marshes are dried, and large surfaces exposed to the burning rays of the sun. I regret to say, that my manifold engagements, and\nfrequent absence from the station, have prevented me from making any regular meteorological observations.\n\n**ANTIQUITIES.**\n\nNuwarakal\u00e1wiya has a degree of local celebrity, from having, during many years, been the residence of the Sinhalese R\u00e1jas.\n\nWe learn from the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so, that Prince Wijaya established himself at Tambapanni or Tammannad\u00e1wiya, near Putt\u00e1lam, about the year 543 B. C. His successor, in 504 B. C., removed to Wijitapura in this district. P\u00e0nduk\u00e1bhaya who followed in the year 474 B. C., took up his residence at Anur\u00e1dhapura; and from this time till A. D. 729, Anur\u00e1dhapura continued to be the metropolis of Ceylon. About the year 307 B. C., the ther\u00f3 ('saint') Mahindo, son of Dhamm\u00e1goka, Emperor of India, introduced Buddhism into Ceylon. It was then that the branch of the sacred B\u00f3-gaha (*Ficus religiosa*) was brought to, and self-planted at, Anur\u00e1dhapura; and here, enclosed in a triple terrace of masonry, it still exists, and still attracts annually thousands of pilgrims from all parts of the Island, and occasionally also from India, and even from Siam; and it is here that the yet venerated Du\u1e6dugemunu, about B. C., 161, expended a vast amount of labour in erecting those bee-hive shaped edifices called d\u00e1gabas, chaityas, or th\u00fapas, which enshrine relics of the philosopher Buddha; and which, though time has impaired the symmetry of their form, still tower in solemn grandeur over the surrounding forests, and proclaim to the yet distant traveller the locality of the sacred city. Seven or eight d\u00e1gabas of various sizes are scattered round the station: these with carved step-stones, and altars, pillars, capitals, and images of Hind\u00fa deities, with long stretches of low mounds and walls, form the chief antiquities to be found at the station, and attract notice, rather from their vast number and extent, than from any other quality they possess. They are interesting as marking the period when Sinhalese genius and enterprize reached their zenith; and to the eye of the engineer, the accuracy of the work is a matter of just admiration.\nThe Mah\u00e1 Lohap\u00e1s\u00e1da, will much disappoint the visitor. It consists simply of a solid square of roughly squared slender pillars, 40 in each row, and rising about 9 feet above the general surface. Each side of the square is 221 feet. There can be little doubt that these pillars were the mere foundations of a huge pyramidal wooden structure, nine stories in height, which must somewhat have resembled the so-called Chinese porcelain towers, and which, when decorated in the Sinhalese fashion, must have formed a very striking, if not a very beautiful object.\n\nIt is impossible for me here to describe the various antiquities round the station. Perhaps a future paper may be devoted to the subject.\n\nSome time ago I commenced a large scale plan of the ground around the station, but want of leisure has forced me to abandon the work.\n\nMihintal\u00e9, eight miles east of Anur\u00e1dhapura, is much resorted to by pilgrims; for there stands the oldest of the d\u00e1gabas, and there the great teacher Mahindo expired. A fine view, stretching probably from sea to sea, and far up to the M\u00e1tal\u00e9 hills, is obtained from the summit.\n\nAt Owkonna, about twenty-six miles south of Mihintale, there is a colossal erect statue of Buddha, about 35 feet in height; it is cut out of solid rock, to which it remains partially attached. The right hand is raised as in the act of benediction.\n\nWijitapura, near Owkonna, has been already mentioned. A siege which it underwent is minutely described in the Mah\u00e1-wanso; but on enquiry, I could not ascertain the existence of any walls or other structures, except a small half-ruined d\u00e1gaba.\n\nClose to the southern extremity of this district, but just within the limits of Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, at Seseruwa-kand\u00e9 Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, there is a statue of Buddha resembling in size and position that at Owkonna.\nBoth here and at other parts of the district, I have met with and copied numerous inscriptions; but regarding these deem it unnecessary at present to do more than state, that the characters employed are not to be found in any of the alphabets in my possession.\n\nFISCAL ARRANGEMENTS.\n\nThis district always formed an integral portion of the Kandyan Provinces, being specially entrusted to the third Dis\u00e1wa for the time being. The last of these appears to have been Talgahagoda Dis\u00e1wa, who seems to have resigned about the year 1833. It was about this time that the district, as it now exists, was formed by adding some portions of M\u00e1tal\u00e9 and Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n\nUntil a few years ago, the native headmen consisted of Mah\u00e1 Wanni Unnehes, Wanni Mudiyanses, and Kariyakarannas, all these being connected with both the Revenue and Police Departments. At present we have Divisions, K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and Tul\u00e1nas, under Rat\u00e9mah\u00e1tmay\u00e1s, K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and L\u00e9kamas; of the first there are 3, of the second 17, of the third about sixty.\n\nRat\u00e9mah\u00e1tmay\u00e1s receive \u00a32 10s. per mensem, besides five per cent. on the revenue collected from their divisions.\n\nK\u00f3r\u00e1les receive five per cent. on their collections, and hold, free of tax, such lands as they possess within their own K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n\nThe L\u00e9kamas, unlike the two other grades, are at present regarded solely as Police Vid\u00e1nes. As a matter of fact, however, they remain, as formerly, general assistants of the K\u00f3ral\u00e9s; and this arrangement ought, I think, to be again formally sanctioned. They hold, free of tax, such of their lands as lie within their own Tul\u00e1nas, and do not receive stated salary, nor percentage.\n\nIt is probable that the system of allowing headmen to hold land tax free, will soon be altogether done away with. It has been maintained, probably with the intention of obtaining the services of men personally interested in their own divisions; but this object can be otherwise secured, and a constant source of demoralization cut off. At present, quantities of land, are to\nescape tax, entered in the names of headmen, who after the lapse of some years claim, and frequently take possession of the lands themselves. At the same time, I see no objection to employing unpaid headmen, so long as the offices are eagerly sought by the people. The Sinhalese love of honor and distinction, though carried to somewhat unreasonable lengths, is in itself laudable, and gives a point d'appui to those who wish to elevate the people. In our own country, many offices unconnected with salary are eagerly contended for, and I see no reason why the same system should not be followed here. That unpaid headmen would take bribes is not more true than that the paid headmen now do so.\n\nThe headmen are, on the whole, inferior in activity and intelligence to those of adjoining districts. This may be attributed to the fact, that the people were, until lately, almost debarred from intercourse with others; that the district was formed of fragments taken from others, and which are only beginning to amalgamate into one homogeneous whole; that the resident civilians have been frequently changed; that the establishment is necessarily broken up annually; and that formerly the Wanniya caste had a sort of monopoly of the headmenships; and even now, many of these people, while they think that they have a right to be made K\u00f3r\u00e1l\u00e1\u015b and Ra\u1e6d\u00e9mah\u00e1tmey\u00e1s as opportunities occur, yet totally neglect their own education, on the plea that they can pay others to read and write for them. I think that a bad effect has been produced by the unceremonious way in which headmen are appointed and dismissed; and believe, that Government in giving up all sorts of state and ceremony, is gratuitously throwing away a powerful means of influencing the people.\n\nWhether headmen ought, or ought not, to have more power than at present, is a matter for serious enquiry, but need not be entered upon here.\n\n**Revenue.**\n\nWith some trifling exceptions, the sole source of revenue is the tax on grain.\nFormerly this used in part to be paid in kind (amanai), but this gave rise to so much deception and loss, that the plan has long since been abandoned. At present the great majority of the tax is collected by the commutation system. According to this, the average annual produce of each piece of land being estimated, the cultivator redeems that portion of it which would fall to Government. It is to be observed, that the rate of redemption is fixed very low, it being considered that the loss thus occurring is more than counterbalanced by the ease of collection, the fixity of revenue, and the checking of deception. In this opinion I entirely concur, and believe the commutation system to be eminently advantageous, both to the rulers and the ruled. The whole process is as follows:\n\nThe headmen send in lists of the lands, giving the extent and probable produce of each share; these lists then may be compared with those of former years, so as to expose any fraud, and are then entered in large register-books; additional columns, shewing the tithe, in grain and in money, being added. There is then drawn out a set of tickets, forming in fact, a copy of the register; each ticket containing a memorandum as to the amount due on each share. After this is prepared, the Assistant Agent proceeds to some appointed village; the people assemble; those of a certain village are called forward; the first name is read, the peasant comes forward, signs the register, and receives the memorandum shewing what he has to pay, and as the matter proceeds, complaints as to over-estimation, &c., are frequently heard at once, and the requisite alterations made. After all this is done, another set of receipts, corresponding to the entries in the registers, is filled up; each such receipt is given by the headman to the person whose name is inscribed on it, when he pays the tax due by him. In this way the peasant knows beforehand what he has to give annually, and he cannot be called on by the K\u00f3ral\u00e1 to pay twice over, as used formerly to occur not unfrequently. The headmen, when they bring revenue to the Kachch\u00e9ri, give in lists of those from whom they have received it, and thus, if a headman dies or is dismissed, there is no difficulty in discovering who is and who is not in arrear.\nThese commutation settlements are made for periods of five years. It was at one time proposed that they should run for twenty years, but fortunately this scheme was abandoned, as also that of allowing the people to redeem their whole grain tax at ten or twenty years' purchase.\n\nThe taxes from ch\u00e9nas, tawalas, and lands which are cultivated at uncertain periods, are collected by estimation, that is, the growing crop is estimated, and the villager redeems the tythe at a fixed rate, which is somewhat below the market value of the grain; at present it is 8d. pence per parra, the market value being from 9d. to a 1s. It is desirable to check this system so far as circumstances allow, as it is impossible to prevent deception being carried on to a great extent.\n\nThe execrable system of farming taxes has never been in use here, and except under very peculiar circumstances I should deplore its introduction.\n\nFine grains pay no tax, this being a Kandyan district; and really, when a man is reduced to living on kurakkan \"rotjes\", it would be cruelty to tax him. The only thing that might induce one to lay a tax on these grains would be, the hope of forcing the people to the cultivation of wholesome articles of diet.\n\nIt appears that in 1825 the revenue realized from this district amounted to the handsome sum of eleven pounds, thirteen shillings and five pence half penny; and from that time until 1883, it seems to have averaged only \u00a3129 13s. 5d.; after this period, however, rose steadily and rapidly, and now nearly, if not quite, covers the expenses.\n\nLast year, (1852) the grain revenue amounted to \u00a31735 4s. 5\u00bdd. and the whole real revenue, exclusive of road tax, to \u00a31874 16s. 5\u00bdd. This year these items amount to \u00a31021 1s. 5d., and \u00a3927 4s. 4\u00bdd respectively.\n\nTwo causes will account for this decrease:\n\n1. Within the two previous years almost all arrears had been collected.\nII. Last year murrain prevailed to a lamentable extent, and so many of the draught cattle died, that large quantities of land were left uncultivated; and as the people are naturally improvident, they were at once reduced to great distress. On the other hand, the amount due for grain commutation by the settlement just closed, contrasts favorably with that which preceded it, shewing an increase of \u00a374 8s. 0\u00bdd. A slight examination will leave no doubt that this district is rapidly increasing in wealth and importance.\n\nCrime.\n\nThe people of Nuwarakalawiya are the most gentle I have had the fortune to meet. It is true they quarrel a good deal, but these squabbles are generally of the most trifling kind; the parties after exhausting their list of abusive terms, pull each other's hairs, then shriek and run away from each other, and so the matter ceases. Serious assaults, robberies, murders, are all but unknown, and during three years I have not had to punish one native of the district for pilfering.\n\nCattle stealing used to prevail to a great extent, but has been much checked since the matter was placed in the hands of the District Judges. It is still carried on to some extent on the borders of Seven Koral\u00e9s and, latterly, of Mannar, but three-fourths of the charges now investigated prove utterly false.\n\nThe people are fond of litigation, but not I believe to the same extravagant extent as elsewhere, and numerous disputes are settled by reference to the Assistant Agent without going to the Courts of law at all; and some such system as this seems to be infinitely the best adapted to the people.\n\nFuture Prospects.\n\nThe soil on the major part of the district being good, there can be no doubt that agriculture will receive more and more attention. Roads are being formed in every direction, and if Government took up the matter of Tank repair with spirit, I believe that Nuwarakalawiya would profit thereby fully as much as any district in Ceylon.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nCEYLON BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\n1856-58.\n\nVOLUME III.\n\nNo. 10.\n\nEDITED BY THE HONORARY SECRETARY.\n\n\"The design of the Society is to institute and promote enquiries into the history, religion, literature, arts, and social condition of the present and former inhabitants of the island, with its geology, minerology, its climate and meteorology, its botany and zoology.\"\n\nCOLOMBO:\nPRINTED AT THE \"CEYLON OBSERVER\" PRESS.\n\n1891.\nCONTENTS.\n\nOn the Principles of Sinhalese Chronology.\u2014By the Rev.

C. ALWIS.\n\nTime is that abstract duration which pervades all ages, without either a commencement or conclusion. It partakes of many of the most sublime attributes of the Supreme Being, such as eternity, invisibility, omnipresence, immaterialism, and so forth. There is some method of computing it amongst every nation. This computation and adjustment of time form the principles of Chronology.\n\nThe most natural division of time seems to be into that of days. Day is called in Sinhalese dawasa. The interval between two successive risings of the sun is a dawasa. Seven dawasas are reckoned into one satiya \"week.\" The days of the week, as among many other nations even in the West, are appropriated to seven gods, and are called by their names: thus Irid\u00e1 \"Sun's-day,\" Sandud\u00e1 \"Moon's-day,\" Angaharu-w\u00e1d\u00e1 \"Mar's-day,\" Bad\u00e1d\u00e1 \"Mercury's-day,\" Brah\u0101spatind\u00e1 \"Jupiter's-day,\" Siku\u00e1d\u00e1 \"Venus'-day,\" and Senasur\u00e1d\u00e1 \"Saturn's-day.\"\n\nDawasa is divided into daw\u00e1la \"day time,\" and r\u00e1triya \"night time.\" Daw\u00e1la is from the rising to the setting of the sun; and r\u00e1triya, begins with the setting of the sun and continues till his rising. From the rising of the sun to his arrival at the meridian is called pera-waruwa \"forenoon;\" and the interval between the meridian and the setting of the Sun is termed pas-waruwa \"afternoon.\" \"Noon\" or \"midday\" is called madd\u00e1hana.\nThe night is divided into three equal portions, called yama \"watch.\" The first watch is called pera-yama or hend\u00e9 y\u00e1maya. The second or middle watch is called maddima y\u00e1maya; and the last watch is called pas'hima y\u00e1maya, or p\u00e1ndara y\u00e1maya. The midnight is called maddima r\u00e1triya. The time during which the rays of the sun's light fall upon the ground before his rising above the horizon, is termed afu-yama, and that of his rising is designated p\u00e1ndara; \"morning\" in general is called udaya.\n\nThe natural day is divided into 60 equal portions, each being called peya, equal to 24 English minutes. Each peya is divided in 60 windi, and each windiya into 60 talparas.\n\nA portion of time consisting of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ peyas is termed h\u00f3r\u00e1, answering exactly to the Greek and Roman word hora, \"hour.\" Astrologers suppose that the same seven gods to whom the supervision of the days of the week are appropriated, preside over each successive seven h\u00f3r\u00e1, beginning from that one to whom the day belongs, but in the following order, namely, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Thus, on Sunday the first h\u00f3r\u00e1 is of the Sun, the second is of Venus, and the third is of Mercury, and so forth; on Monday the first h\u00f3r\u00e1 belongs to the Moon, the second to Saturn, and the third to Jupiter, and so on.\n\nThe firmament studded with constellations and stars, apparently in an incessant motion from east to west, is divided into twelve portions, each called r\u00e1siya, \"sign.\" The names of these twelve r\u00e1s\u00ed, together with the time during which they emerge out of the horizon, are as follows:\n\n| Names       | P.

Thus, Mithuna and Kany\u0101, the r\u0101si or \"signs\" bordering on each side of the mansions of the Sun and Moon, belong to Mercury. The two beyond these on each side, namely Wri\u015bhubha and Tula, are appropriated to Venus; the two beyond these namely Mi\u015bha and Wri\u015bchika, belong to Mars. The next two, Mina and Dhanu, are the mansions of Jupiter, and the remaining two, Makara and Kumbha, belong to Saturn.\n\nThe Sun, the Moon, and the Planets, move through these r\u0101si in their courses.\n\nAwurudda \"year,\" is the time during which the sun travels through all the twelve r\u0101si in his course, beginning from the first point of Mi\u015bha r\u0101siya. Sixty years make a cycle. The number of the cycle of any given year is found by adding 11 to the given year of Saka (which is 78 years less than the Christian era) and dividing the sum by 60. The remainder, after this process, is the number of the cycle of the given year; and if nothing remains, 60 is the cycle.\n\nThe Si\u00f1halese have four eras by which they date the year of any event. That which is most familiar to the generality of the people is the \u1e62aka Warsha, which is the year of some\nKing of the continent of Asia, whose name was \u015aaka, and who was said to be the head of the royal race of Yawana (Grecian). The present year (A.D. 1855) is the 1777th of the \u015aaka Warsha, 78 years later than the Christian era.\n\nThey use the year of our Lord Jesus Christ in all the public documents at present; and the inhabitants of the towns and their neighbourhood are more familiar with this than \u015aaka Warsha.\n\nFor religious purposes they use Buddha Warsha, the year from the death of Gautama Buddha, 621 years before \u015aaka Warsha. Consequently, the present is the 2398th year of Buddha Warsha.\n\nIn most of the Medical, Astronomical, and other Scientific works of very ancient dates, which we have in Sanskrit from the V\u00e9das of the Brahmins, another era, called Kaliyuga Warsha, is used. Kaliyuga is the last of the four yugas or ages of the world, which, the Sinhalese say, have passed. The commencement of the Kaliyuga was 3179 years prior to \u015aaka Warsha. The present year of the Kaliyuga is the 4956th. The whole period during which it is to exist is 432,000 years. The yuga or age that preceded Kaliyuga was called Dv\u00e1para, and existed twice as many years as the Kaliyuga, namely 864,000. The one before that was Tr\u00e9t\u00e1, which existed 1,296,000 years being three times as many as the years of Kaliyuga. And the one preceding this was Krita, the duration of which was four times that of Kaliyuga, namely 1,728,000 years. Before these four yugas, the present kalpa or the period of the world, is believed to have existed during 27 divine yugas of an innumerable number of years.\n\nThe length of a year is 365 dawas, 15 \u1e63ya, 31 win\u0101di, and 15 tatparas. The commencement of the Sinhalese year falls generally about the 11th of April. To find the exact moment at which any given year commences, or the moment at which the sun enters into M\u0113sha r\u0101siya, the following is the rule. Subtract 1244 from the \u015aaka era, and by the remainder multiply 365 d. 15 p. 31 w. 15 tat.; and to the product add 1615536 dawas.\n59 p. 45 w. 30 tat.; and then throw off as many 7 days as possible from the sum. The commencement of the year or the sun's entering into Misha rasiya is so many days after Friday, as appears in the remainder of dawas, peyas, winadi, and taparas. If there is no remainder in the place of days, the commencement of the year is on Friday; if one, on Saturday, and so forth. Thus, to find the commencement of the present Sinhalese year, the year of Saka 1777 (A.D. 1855), subtract 1244 from 1777 which leaves a remainder 533, by this multiply 365 d. 15 p. 31 w. 15 tat., which gives a product of 19682 dawas 52 p. 36 w. 15 tat.; then add to this product 1615536 dawas, 59 p. 45 w. 30 tat., which will give a sum of 1810219 dawas, 52 p. 21 w. 45 tat.; after this, throw off as many seven days as possible, when there will be a remainder of 5 d. 52 p. 21 w. 45 tat. The commencement of the year is thus 5 days after Friday, namely, on Wednesday, at 52 peyas and 21 w. 45 tat.: which, according to English calculation, is Thursday 2 h. 56' 42\" A.M., or 3 minutes and 18 seconds before 3 A.M.\n\nM\u00e1s\u00e9 \"month,\" is about the twelfth part of a year, and is of two kinds, the solar and lunar. The solar month is the time during which the sun continues in any one of the twelve r\u0101si.\n\nThe moment at which the sun enters into any one of the twelve r\u0101si is found by the following rule:\u2014to the dawas peyas and winadi of the sun's entering into Misha rasiya, add the number of dawas, peyas and winadi opposite to the required r\u0101si in the table below, and leave off, if possible, seven from the number of days, and the remainder is the dawasa, peya and winadiya after Friday, when the Sun enters that r\u0101siya.\n\n| D. | P. | W. |\n|----|----|----|\n| Wri\u1e63habha | ... | 2 55 32 |\n| Mithuna | ... | 6 19 44 |\n| Karka\u1e6daka | ... | 2 56 22 |\n| Si\u1e47ha | ... | 6 24 34 |\n| Kany\u0101 | ... | 2 26 44 |\n| Tul\u0101 | ... | 4 54 6 |\nThus, to find the time at which the sun enters Mithuna r\u0101siya in the present year, add\n\n| D. | P. | W. |\n|----|----|----|\n| 2  | 52 | 22* Sun's entering into M\u00e9sha r\u0101siya |\n| 6  | 19 | 44 as found opposite Mithuna r\u0101siya |\n\n|    |    |    |\n|----|----|----|\n| 9  | 12 | 6  |\n| 7  | 0  | 0  |\n\n2 12 6 That is, on Sunday at 12 p.m. 6 u.\n\nAccording to English calculation, 10 h. 50' 24\" A.M.\n\nThe length of each of the twelve solar months, or the time during which the sun continues in any one of the r\u0101si, is given in the following table.\n\n| D. | P. | W. |\n|----|----|----|\n| M\u00e9sha ... | ... | 30 55 32 |\n| Vrishabha ... | ... | 31 24 12 |\n| Mithuna ... | ... | 31 36 38 |\n| Karkataka ... | ... | 31 28 12 |\n| Sigha ... | ... | 31 2 10 |\n| Kany\u00e1... | ... | 30 27 22 |\n| Tul\u00e1 ... | ... | 29 54 7 |\n| Vrishchika ... | ... | 29 30 24 |\n| Dhanu ... | ... | 29 29 53 |\n| Makara ... | ... | 29 18 7 |\n| Kumbha ... | ... | 29 48 33 |\n| Mina ... | ... | 30 20 21 |\n\nTotal... 365 15 31\n\n* In leaving out the tatparas, if there are 30 or more, one is added to the winadies.\nFrom this table it appears, that the sun does not pass through every r\u0101siya in an equal length of time; he sojourns the longest time in Mithuna, being 31 d. 36 p. 38 w. From thence he continues less and less in every successive r\u0101siya, until he comes to Makara, where he passes only 29 d. 18 p. 7 w. From Makara, again, the time of the sun's sojourn in each r\u0101siya successively becomes longer and longer, till he comes up to Mithuna again. The difference of the sun's longest and shortest sojourn in these two r\u0101si is 2 d. 18 p. 31 w.\n\nThe longest day here is said to be 31 p. 22 w., and the shortest 28 p. 38 w., or according to English reckoning, the longest day is 12 hours and 31 minutes, and the shortest day is 11 hours and 29 minutes. In order to find the gradual change of the different length of day and night, the following table is given:\n\n| R\u0101siya       | P.   | W.   |\n|--------------|------|------|\n| M\u0113sha        | ...  | 30   |\n| V\u1e5bishabha    | ...  | 30   |\n| Mithuna      | ...  | 31   |\n| Karka\u1e6daka    | ...  | 31   |\n| Sigha        | ...  | 31   |\n| Kany\u0101        | ...  | 30   |\n| Tul\u0101         | ...  | 30   |\n| V\u1e5bi\u1e63chika    | ...  | 29   |\n| Dhanu        | ...  | 28   |\n| Makara       | ...  | 28   |\n| Kumbha       | ...  | 28   |\n| M\u012bna         | ...  | 29   |\n\nIn this table, the length of the day at the time of the sun's entering into each of the 12 r\u0101si is given; the difference between this and 60 peyas being the length of the night. The length of the day or night in any day intervening between any two days given in the table is more or less in proportion. This table is, however, constructed upon the principle that the sun always sets first at the point in the r\u0101si-chakra \"zodiac\" opposite to his position when he rises in the eastern horizon.\nBut as the sun progresses about one-sixtieth part of a r\u0101siya from the time of his rising to that of his setting, and as the seventh r\u0101siya, by which he always sets, is never equal in size to that by which he rises, there is always a difference of about 5 winddi: consequently, the length of day or night given in the table occurs always about 20 days previous to that given in it.\n\nThe six months from the Sun's entering into Karka\u1e6daka is termed Dakshinayana \"Southern course,\" and the other six months from his entering into Makara, is called Uttarayana \"Northern course,\" because during these months the sun seems to travel towards these directions.\n\nThis declination of the sun is said to cause the general length of a man's shadow (in the central parts of this Island,) cast on the ground at noon for each one-third of the solar month, to be the following number of feet;\u2014viz.:\n\n| MONTH     | NO. OF FT. |\n|-----------|------------|\n| M\u0113sha     | 1\u00bd 1 1\u00bd    |\n| Wrishabha | 1\u00bd 2 2\u00bd    |\n| Mithuna   | 2\u00bd 3 2\u00bd    |\n| Karka\u1e6daka | 2\u00bd 2 1\u00bd    |\n| Siyha     | 1\u00bd 1 1\u00bd    |\n| Kany\u0101     | 1\u00bd 2 2\u00bd    |\n| Tul\u0101      | 2\u00bd 3 3\u00bd    |\n| Wri\u015bchika | 3\u00bd 4 4\u00bd    |\n| Dhanu     | 4\u00bd 4\u00bd 4\u00bd   |\n| Makara    | 4\u00bd 4 3\u00bd    |\n| Kumbha    | 3\u00bd 3 2\u00bd    |\n| M\u012bna      | 2\u00bd 2 1\u00bd    |\n\nThis portion of the shadow of a man is called awachch\u0101wa, or more properly, awachchh\u0101y\u0101wa, \"extra shadow.\" Thus, the awachch\u0101wa for the first 10 days of the sun's stay in M\u0113sha, or the 10 days after the 11th of April, is one foot and a half; for the next 10 days of the same month, it is one foot, and for the third 10 days it is one and a half. And for the first 10 days of the solar month of Wrishabha, the \"extra shadow\" of a man is one foot and a half; for the next 10 days it is two feet, and for the last 10 days it is two and a half feet; and so on.\n\nIn consequence of there existing little or no difference in the aspect of the country at various seasons, the Siyhaese do not recognise the four seasons of the year, as people of other countries do. The medical and astrological books, speak,\nindeed, of six seasons of the year, called *ritu*, and the religious books make mention of three *ritus*: but they are of no consequence here, as people do not talk of them on ordinary occasions.\n\nThe lunar month is the period from the moon's passing between the sun and earth until she comes again between these two bodies. The names of the twelve lunar months beginning from that in which the sun comes to *M\u00e9sha*, are as follows:\n\n| Solar Month | Lunar Month | Corresponding English Month |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| M\u00e9sha       | Bak         | April and May               |\n| Wri\u0161haba    | Wesak       | May and June                |\n| Mithuna     | Poson       | June and July               |\n| Ka\u1e6daka or Karka\u1e6daka | \u0112\u1e63ala | July and August             |\n| Sigha       | Niki\u1e47i      | August and Sept.            |\n| Kany\u00e1       | Binara      | Sept. and Oct.              |\n| Tul\u00e1        | Wap         | Oct. and Nov.               |\n| Wri\u0161chika   | Il          | Nov. and Decr.              |\n| Dhanu       | U\u00f1duwap     | Dec. and Jan.               |\n| Makara      | Durutu      | Jan. and Feb.               |\n| Kumbha      | Nawam       | Feb. and March              |\n| M\u00edna        | Mcdin       | March and April             |\n\nThe lunar month does not necessarily begin on the same day as the solar. It begins with the day after the new moon. That lunar month in which the sun enters *M\u00e9sha r\u0101siya*, or that of which the full moon is nearest to the sun's entering *M\u00e9sha r\u0101siya*, is the first lunar month, *Bak masa*.\n\nWhen there are thirteen full moons in any year, the additional month is called *Adhika m\u00e1s\u00e9*, two of the months being called by the same name.\n\nAbout *Adhika m\u00e1s\u00e9* there is at present a controversy, in which every one of the Budhist priests of the Island is more or less engaged. It was originated about 35 years ago, by Atthadassi Terunn\u00e1nse of Bentota, who is considered to be the most learned of the Buddhist priests of the day. One party\nmaintain that the Adhika m\u0101s\u0101, or the additional month, ought to be in that solar month in which the two full moons occur; but the other party say, that the additional month must be next to Es\u0101la, and ought to be called the second Es\u0101la, without any regard to the solar month in which the two full moons occur.\n\nThe lunar month is divided into two portions, each called pakshaya. One, from the day after the new moon to the day of full moon, is called pura, \"increase;\" or p\u016brva pakshaya, \"the former part;\" or sukla-pakshaya, \"white part:\" and the other, from the day after the full moon to the day of new moon, is called awa, \"wane,\" or apara-pakshaya, \"the latter part,\" or krishna-pakshaya, \"the black part.\" Each pakshaya, is divided into 15 tithi. The length of a tithi varies from 53 to 67 peyas.\n\nThe names of the fifteen tithi from the first, are P\u0113lawiya, Diyawaka, Tiyawaka, Jalawaka, Wis\u00e9niya, S\u0113tawaka, Satawaka, Atawaka, Nawawaka, Dasawaka, Ekoloswaka, Dol\u014dswaka, Teleswaka, Tuduswaka and Pasaloswaka or Am\u0101waka. Of these two names for the last tithi, Pasaloswaka is the full moon, and Am\u0101waka, the new moon.\n\nThe moon's path in the firmament is divided into 27 portions, each called a nekata, \"asterism.\" Each nekata is four-ninths of a r\u0101siya. The names of the 27 nekat, beginning from the first point of M\u0113sha r\u0101siya, are A\u015bwida, Berana, Ket\u012b, Rehe\u1e47a, Muwasirisa, Ada, Pun\u0101wasa, Pusha, As\u0101lisa, Ma, Puwapal, Uttarapal, Hata, Sita, S\u0101, Wis\u0101, Anura, Deta, Mula, Puwasala, Uttarasa\u1e37a, Suwana, Dena\u1e6da, Siy\u0101wasa, Puwapu\u1e6dupa, Uttarapu\u1e6dup\u0101 and R\u00e9watiya. The tithi and nekata of any day or time are those in which the moon is in her course through the zodiac in that day or time. The time of the moon's passing through each nekata varies from 53 to 67 peyas.\n\nThe popular notion of the moon's rising or setting peya respectively at day and night of pura and awa, and vice versa, is twice the number of tithi. So that on the day of P\u0113lawiya\nin pura, or the first day of the moon, she rises in the second peya after it is day, and sets in the second peya after it is night, in proportion to what is past out of the tithi. On Diyawaka of the pura, or on the second day of the moon, she rises in the 4th p. after it is day, and sets in the 4th p. after it is night. On Julawaka of awa, or the 4th day of the wane, the moon rises at the 8th p. after it is night, and sets in the 8th p. after it is day, and so forth. It should be noticed, that in general one tithi and nekata exhibit in one part of the day, and another tithi and nekata in the next part of the day; and so proportionably the rising and setting of the moon are changed. Although the above is the popular notion of the moon's rising and setting time, its exact moment is known accurately by the position of the moon in the rasiya through which she passes, by a reference to the nekata of the day in a common lita, or almanac.\n\nEach of the four quarter days of the moon is called poya; the full moon is called Pasaloswaka poya, and the new moon Mas\u00e9 poya. The first quarter is called Mas\u00e9 giya atuwaka poya, and the last quarter Pahaloswaka giya atuwaka poya. In the poya, or quarter days, the Buddhists generally refrain from worldly occupations, and engage themselves in religious works, believing, on the authority of Buddha, that on these days the messengers of the god Sakra or Indra come to the human world, observe the deeds of the people, record each man's actions distinctly in a book, and then carry it to report to their master.\n\nThe Singhalese use different modes of computing time or finding the peya of the day. The most common way, when the sun or moon is visible, is by the shadow of a person cast on a level ground measured with his own foot. The method of doing it is thus. Leave off the awachch\u00e1wa \"the extra shadow\" as above mentioned, according to the time of the solar month, then double the remaining number of feet and add 12 more; and make this sum a divisor, and 180 its dividend. The quotient is the number of peyas either from the\nsun-rise, or to the sun-set, as the case may be. If there be any remainder after the above division, multiply it by 60, and divide the product by the same divisor for win\u0101di, and so for tatparas. Thus on the fifteenth day of April, in the morning, if I see my shadow to be 20 of my feet, I proceed thus to find the peya. It being only about two days after the Sun's entering into M\u0113sha r\u0101siya, the awachch\u0101wa is $1\\frac{1}{2}$ ft., which I take off, and the remainder, $18\\frac{1}{2}$ ft., I multiply by two, which gives 37, I add to this 12, and the sum left is 49. I then divide 180 by 49, thus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n49) & \\quad 180 (3 p. \\\\\n& \\quad 147 \\\\\n& \\quad 33 \\\\\n& \\quad 60 \\\\\n49) & \\quad 1980 (40 w. \\\\\n& \\quad 196 \\\\\n& \\quad 20 \\\\\n& \\quad 60 \\\\\n49) & \\quad 1200 (24 tat. \\\\\n& \\quad 98 \\\\\n& \\quad 220 \\\\\n& \\quad 196 \\\\\n& \\quad 24 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand find that the time is 3 p. 40 w. 24 tat., in the morning, or, according to the English way, 28' 10\" after 7 A.M.\n\nA more simple way than this, though not so correct, is that after taking away the awachch\u0101wa \"the extra shadow,\" the following numbers of feet stand for each peya, either from the sun-rise, or to sun-set, as the case may be, namely 84, 49, 24, 16, 12, 9, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1$\\frac{1}{2}$, 1, $\\frac{1}{2}$, 0. Thus in the former case $8\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. after the awachch\u0101wa has been taken away, being between 24 and 16, is between 3 and 4 peyas from sun-rise.\nTo reckon the time when the sun or moon is not visible, they have a cup called *p\u0113-t\u0113tiya*, made of some kind of metal, or coconut shell, with a small hole in the centre, which will fill in just in one *peya* when placed in a vessel of still water.\n\nThe Sinhalese speak of the time of the day in a different mode from what the English do. They do not say, \"It is three o'clock,\" or three on the clock. This mode of expression must be of a comparatively recent date, as clocks and watches were not in use at a very remote period. There is an unidiomatic and corrupt way of speaking of time, among the Sinhalese, in the neighbourhood of towns, inhabited by Europeans and their descendants; such as, \"*D\u0113n kiyada? Pahayi*,\" \"How many is it now? Five\" Meaning, \"What is the hour now? Five\" This mode of conversation concerning time is unintelligible among the Sinhalese people of the villages, who have less intercourse with Europeans and speak the language in its purity. Their question, in the place of \"What o'clock is it now?\" is thus;\u2014\"D\u0113n eliwa\u1e47\u1e0da (or eliweld) or r\u00e9wenda (or r\u00e9wel\u0101) ki peyada?\" \"How many *peyas* is it now to be morning? (or since morning,) or to be night, (or since night)?\"\n\nSometimes, speaking with respect to the feet of the shadow of the Sun or Moon, they say: \"*D\u0113n ira (or handa) mudun\u0101\u1e6da enda (or heril\u0101) dolos piyawarayi*.\"\u2014\"It is twelve feet the sun (or moon) to come to the top (or having turned.)\"\nREMARKS ON THE SUPPOSED IDENTITY BETWEEN N\u00c1GAS\u00c9NA AND N\u00c1G\u00c1RJUNA.\n\nBY JAMES DE ALWIS, ESQ., ASSISTANT SECRETARY.\n\nORIENTAL scholars have long entertained the belief,* that N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, the hero of \"Milindappra\u015bna,\" and N\u00e1g\u00e1rjuna, the character who holds a distinguished place in the \"R\u00e1ja Tara\u1e45gi\u1e47\u00ed,\" were identical. Curiosity, however, led me to read the original passage on the Kashmirian history, and the discordance in the rhythm of several lines, to examine it closely. In the course of that examination, I have detected several grave errors in the construction put upon the passage in question, which I beg now to record, with the object of awakening the attention of Oriental scholars, who are better qualified than myself, to the investigation of a subject, which is not only interesting but difficult.\n\nThe passage in question, which I extract from the Asiatic Researches, Vol. XV., p. 111, is the following:\n\nT\u00e9 turushk\u0101navy\u014ddbh\u016bt\u0101; pi punny\u0101\u015bra)\u0101 nripih\n\u015aushkaksh\u0113tr\u0101di d\u0113\u015beshu; ma\u1e6dha chaitty\u0101di chakkrir\u0113.\nPr\u0101jjiy\u0113 r\u0101jjyakshan\u0113 t\u0113sh\u0101n; pr\u0101ya K\u0101\u015bmira mandalan\nBh\u014djjya m\u0101st\u0113a bauddh\u0101n\u0101n; pravrajjy\u014drjita t\u0113jasan.\nTat\u014d bhagavatah S\u0101kkya; \u015ainhasya puranivrit\u0113\nAsmin saha l\u014dka dh\u0101taw; \u0101rdhan varsha satan hyag\u0101t,\nBodhisattvasa\u1e25 d\u0113\u015bmin; n\u0113ka bh\u016bmiy\u0101r\u014d bh\u016bt\nSacha N\u0101g\u0101r'junah srim\u0101n; shadarhatva nasanarayi.\n\n* See Bombay Asiatic Society's Journal, No VIII. October 1844, p. 96.\nProfessor H. H. Wilson, in Appendix VII. to his Essay on the Hindu History of Kashmir, thus translates the passage which I have above extracted:\n\n\"They (Hushka &c.,) of Turushka descent, were princes, asylums of virtue; and they founded colleges and planted sacred trees, on Suscha and other places. During the period of their reign, the whole of Kashmir was the enjoyment of Buddha's eminent for austerity. After them, when 150 years had elapsed from the emancipation of the Lord S\u0101kya S\u012bha in this essence of the world, a Bodhisatwa in this country, named N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, was Bhumi\u1e63vara. (Lord of the earth,) and he was the asylum of the six Arhatwas.\"\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Turnour, with that zeal in the cause of oriental research, for which he was eminently distinguished, and with a view to identify N\u0101g\u0101rjuna with N\u00e1g\u00e1s\u00e9na, and to adjust the date here given to that assigned to the latter in Buddhistical annals, has* corrected the text in two most important particulars: 1st, by prefixing da to sardhan varsha satan, \"one hundred and fifty years,\" and converting the passage into dasardhan varsha satan, \"half-a-thousand years;\" and 2ndly, by giving to the concluding portion of the Sanskrit quotation, which Professor Wilson has rendered \"He was the asylum of the six Arahatwas,\" a negative signification\u2014conveying that he did not recognize (i.e. he denounced) the six Arahatwas; and by identifying them with the six T\u012brtakas mentioned in the \"Milindappra\u015ba.\" The entire translation which Mr. Turnour has offered, runs thus:\n\n\"They (Hush'a, Jushka, Canishka) of Purushka descent were princes, asylums of virtue, who founded colleges and chetiyas in Suscha and other countries. During the entire period of their rule, the whole of Kashmir was under the spiritual control of ascetic sages, eminent for their rigid piety. Thereafter, when (half a thousand) five hundred years, had elapsed in this (land) as well as the whole world, from the period that the sanctified S\u0101kya S\u012bha attained Parinirv\u0101\u1e47a, the pre-eminently endowed Bodhisatwa N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, became the (spiritual) Lord of this and many other lands, and did not recognize (i.e. denounced) the six Arhatwas (who were his contemporaries).\"\n\n* See Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal for 1856, p. 580.\nBefore remarking on the important alterations thus effected by Mr. Turnour, it may be necessary to examine the original text, and to notice the fact, that it is written in that most frequent and useful form of Sanskrit verse called the *Anushtubh*\u2014a metre \"in which the great body of metrical composition, whether narrative or didactic, exists\"\u2014a metre too, in which \"the laws of Manu, the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, the R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u00f1a and the Pur\u00e1\u00f1as are written.\" The species under notice is thus defined:\n\n\"The *Anushtubh* stanza is divided into four *p\u00e1das* of eight syllables each. In its most regular form, the first foot is any one except a tribrach, the second may be a dactyl, a tribrach, cretic or anap\u00e6st; the other two syllables are indifferently long or short.\"\n\nAnother peculiarity in the formation of the *Anushtubh* is, \"that the fifth syllable of each line is short, the sixth long and the seventh alternately long and short; whilst the first four syllables and the eighth are arbitrary.\"\n\nBy reducing the passage in question into symbolical figures, it will be perceived at a glance, that there are three prosodial errors;\u2014one in the 2nd line; another in the 11th; and a third in the 14th; whilst the 12th line, in which it is stated that *da* is omitted before *s\u00e1rdhan*, and the 16th, which is said to contain a dennuciation of the six Arahatwas, are clearly free from prosodial errors. Two of the errors which I have noticed are of a trifling character, as they may easily be rectified without adding anything to the sense. The letter *a* in *api* \"afterwards,\" with which the 2nd line of this passage commences, is omitted; when added, the line runs thus:\n\n*Api punny\u00e1sray\u0101 nripah:* \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 = 8.\n\nThe 14th line is thus correctly rendered in the N\u00e1gari version of the \"R\u00e1ja Tarav\u00edgini\" printed at Calcutta in 1835; and I at once adopt it, as it is free from error.\n\n*N\u00e9ka bh\u00fami\u015bwar\u00f2 bhavat:* \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 = 8.\n\nIn the 11th line there is an unaccountable confusion, both in\nthe N\u0101gari version, and in the extract published by Professor Wilson; and I confess that it is impossible, without materially altering the sense, to redeem it from the palpable inaccuracy of rendering the 5th a long, and the 6th a short syllable.\n\nArmin saha loka dha\u015baw: \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 = 8.\n\nI have thus examined the entire passage in reference to the rhythm. It therefore only remains to consider the correctness or otherwise of the criticisms offered by Mr. Turnour.\n\nWith regard to the 12th line\u2014if, as stated by Mr. Turnour, a d with its inherent vowel is introduced, and the whole line is thereby rendered dasdrdhan varsha satan hyag\u0101t; it will be perceived that we not only destroy the harmony of the entire verse, but render the line 9, instead of,\u2014as it is, and ought to be\u20148 syllables.\n\nSardhan varsha satan hyag\u0101t: \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 = 8.\n\nAs to the last line,\u2014shadarhatva na-sanshrayi; it is stated that Professor Wilson has lost sight of the negative na. Mr. Turnour can scarcely be deemed correct in offering this criticism; and on reference to the text we also find that Professor Wilson has incorrectly extracted the passage. It should be (see original) Shadahar vana sansrayi, which means, \"he was one who spent six-days in the wilderness.\" To render the passage as Mr. Turnour has translated it, \"he denounced the six Arahatwas\" the word arhatwa should be either arhatwan, the accusative, or arhatwasya, the genitive.\n\nThe passage given in the N\u0101gari original furnishes no great objection in point of grammar\u2014certainly none in regard to rhythm; and is altogether such as may be reconciled with the doctrine of Nir\u014ddha Sam\u0101patti in Buddhism, by which it was incumbent on the ascetic, who had attained the state of \"Arah\u0101t\" to spend six days in seclusion in the wilderness, and on the seventh to leave it in search of food.\n\nSeeing, therefore, that the two most important coincide between the Kashmirian and Buddhistical annals to which Turnour refers, do not really exist, it may be inferred, that his\nother reasons for the identity of N\u00e1g\u00e1rjuna and N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, founded especially, as they are\u2014on \"hypothetical reasoning,\" lose much of the weight due to them, if they do not altogether fall to the ground.\n\nI shall, however, postpone a consideration of them to an early opportunity, contenting myself at present with a translation of the passage in question, which I append:\n\n\"It is said that they (Hushka, Jushka, Kanishka) of Turushka descent, were princes, who were embued with the virtue of merit,* and who afterwards founded Colleges, ch\u00edtiyas, &c., in Sushkal\u00e9ttra\u2020 and other countries. During the period of their extended reigns\u2021 the country of Kashmir was greatly under the spiritual control of Buddhistical ascetics, pre-eminent for their rigid piety. Thereafter, when a century (one hundred years) and a half had elapsed in the essence of this world, after the sanctified S\u00e1kya Sigha obtained final emancipation (Puranirwritte)\u00a7, there appeared in this country a Bodhisat (an\u00e9ka bhumi\u015bvara) lord of many lands. This distinguished personage, who was named N\u00e1g\u00e1rjuna, usually spent six days (in the week) in the wilderness.\"||\n\n* \"Embued with the virtue of merit\" means that they betook themselves to a course of religious austerities, by which sin was avoided, and attained a status for acquiring merit.\n\n\u2020 Sushkal\u00e9ttr\u00e1di. I have translated Sushkal\u00e9ttra, &c. This is the form in which the word occurs in the N\u00e1gari version. It may be either one name or two. And this expression, rendered Shushkaksh\u00e9ttr\u00e1di by Professor Wilson, may also stand for one or two names. It may either stand entirely as a name, or be rendered \"the valley (Kshettra) of Sushka, &c.\"\n\n\u2021 \"Extended reigns.\" The word pr\u00e1jjiy\u00e9 rendered by me \"extended,\" is interpreted by Mr. Turnour to mean \"entire,\" and it is omitted in the translation of Professor Wilson. It is, however, remarkable that this word is ill-adapted in its present position as an adjective to qualify Rajjyakshan\u00e9.\n\n\u00a7 Puranirwritte. This is undoubtedly Paranervitta; and Professor Wilson's alteration was as indispensable as correct.\n\n|| Shodahor rana sanshray\u00e9 is rendered in Professor Wilson's extract, Shodarhatwo nasanshraye. See my remarks in the Text.\nAN INTRODUCTORY PAPER\nON THE INVESTIGATION OF SINHALESE MUSIC.\n\nBY LOUIS NELL, ESQ.\n\nThe Ceylon Branch of the Asiatic Society, formed to institute and promote enquiries into the Arts of Ceylon, together with the social condition of the present and former inhabitants of this Island, would embrace within the scope of those enquiries, the investigation of Sinhalese music,\u2014since it is peculiar to the Sinhalese, and because it is calculated to throw some light upon the social condition of the people. Their Music is as peculiar to the Sinhalese, as the music of any other people, to them. The Oriental enjoys his rude melodies, as heartily as the European, the music of the West. But the difference is so great between the barbarous and the civilized art, that the former becomes a subject of curiosity to the votary of the other. Though Sinhalese music, therefore, may be of no great intrinsic value, it is deserving of investigation as a national art, and as an illustration of the social condition of the Sinhalese people. It is hardly necessary to illustrate this position, by alluding to the marked characteristics of Scottish and Irish music; or by contrasting their national character with that of the music of Italy. Nor will it be necessary, to make more than a passing allusion, to the effects of musical culture in Germany, in the Tyrol, and in Switzerland. It will not be denied, that the influence of music is calculated to take hold of the affections: nor will its moral influence be denied when the value which has been placed on it by religion, is but for a moment considered. The investigation of Sinhalese music, therefore, is worthy of the attention of this Society.\nWith regard to the estimation, in which music was held, in comparison with other branches of knowledge, it may be, observed;\u2014That the \"R\u00e1ja Ratn\u00e1kara,\" ascribes to a favorite Siphalese prince, a knowledge of the following branches of Eastern Science;\u20141 Oratory; 2 General knowledge; 3 Grammar; 4 Poetry; 5 Knowledge of Languages; 6 Astronomy; 7 Knowledge of giving counsel; 8 Of obtaining Nirw\u00e1na; 9 The knowledge of good and evil actions; 10 Of shooting; 11 Of Elephants; 12 Discernment of thoughts; 13 Discernment of invisible beings; 14 Knowledge of words; 15 Knowledge of history; 16 Of the law; 17 Rhetoric; and 18 Medicine. (Upham II., 99-100.)\n\nIt is probable, that had music been held in higher estimation by the partial historian, he would have added it to the others, by which the memory of Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu the 3rd, is adorned in the page of Siphalese history.\n\nIt is probable that many attempts have been made to reduce Siphalese melodies to European notation; but the silence which has been hitherto preserved on the subject, must be interpreted as a tacit acknowledgement of failure. The fullest account of native music and musical instruments, is that given by Davy, whose work on Ceylon ranks next to that of Knox for originality and correctness. Davy gives a description of seven native musical instruments,\u20141 beragediya, 2 dawula, 3 tom-tom, 4 udekkiya, 5 talliya, 6 horan\u00e9wa, and 7 v\u00e9n\u00e1va. It may be here remarked, that all these are Siphalese instruments; and that the brother of Sir Humphry Davy, with the carefulness of a scientific enquirer, has not confounded them with Malabar instruments, or added any foreign ones to his enumeration. It would be unadvisable perhaps, to incorporate the remarks of Dr. Davy, in this paper, since the work itself could always be referred to.\n\nMy succeeding remarks will be of a more practical nature, as they were suggested by actual experiments; the results of which, however, have not been extensive enough to justify mention.\nIt will follow from observations already made, that no such results have been arrived at by writers on Ceylon, as were obtained by Lane, in his \"Modern Egyptians.\" He gives a few instances, in European notation, of Egyptian airs, including the \"call to prayer\" at Cairo, the style of chanting the Koran, and some specimens of secular songs. In attempting such results in Ceylon, the very first difficulty would be, the unsuitableness of the European musical scale to express the exact nature of the sounds, which form the strains of native melodies. This is, perhaps, not generally known. To explain the reason would involve a consideration of the leading principle of musical acoustics, and of the theory of the musical scale. But before doing so, a favourite speculation must be dismissed. It is a favourite method on such enquiries as the present, to speculate on the probable character of Hebrew, ancient Egyptian, and Grecian music. This course, though seemingly going to the root of the matter, will give no practical results. I believe I am not incorrect in stating, that all certainty in the history of music dates from the discovery of our modern notation. This may be described, as, the system of designating musical sounds by points, distributed on lines and the spaces between them; which system, when once acquired by a musician, enables him to read melody and harmony, and to reproduce exactly what has thus been written. This definition, I believe, will at once exclude any ancient Eastern notation, as well as the system of using prosodial feet.\n\nThe application of the principles of musical-acoustics to this investigation, may be illustrated as follows. We shall take the instance of a person, endowed with a correct ear, and possessing a moderate degree of skill in performing on the German-flute. We shall, also, suppose him to listen, with curiosity, to the performance of a native musician; and to endeavour to catch the air being played, on his own instrument. To any one, who has tried the experiment, it is needless to foretell its failure. Let us suppose our amateur, to ask himself the reason, why? The easiest solution of the difficulty\nwill be found in a comparison of the two instruments. Not in the finish and perfection of the one, and the native rudeness of the other; but in the acoustical proportions of both. He will find, to his surprise, that the vents of his own instrument are apparently placed in the most arbitrary manner, with regard to their relative positions; while on the other hand, the despised native instrument is vented with more mathematical regularity. In seeking a scientific explanation, we should begin from the most elementary principles.\n\nMusical tones are supposed to be the results of aerial vibrations, proceeding from a central vibrating body. Under the influence of the same motive force, the relative number of vibrations has been found, to be in the inverse ratio of the dimensions of the vibrating body. Thus, in the case already considered, the relative number of vibrations (producing the different notes) is in inverse ratio to the length of the column of air in the flute. The average diameter of the flute throughout its length being supposed to represent an uniform diameter, and beginning by closing all the vents, as each successive vent is opened, the length of the column of air in the flute tube is reduced in the same proportion. Sounding the instrument with the same force, it will be found, that the shorter the column the more acute is the note. And, as already stated, the vents being placed at irregular distances, the musical sounds produced, are at irregular intervals from each other. But the native instrument, having its vents bored at regular distances, will emit notes at regular intervals of acuteness. The reason why the sounds of the latter are so unpleasant to our ears, will appear, when we consider the theory of the musical scale.\n\nTaking the natural scale of C major, we find, that it consists of seven unqualified notes, designated by the seven first letters of the alphabet, in the following order, C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. The intervals or musical distances between these notes are not equal, since those expressed as $\\frac{C}{D}$, $\\frac{D}{E}$, $\\frac{E}{F}$, $\\frac{G}{A}$, and $\\frac{A}{B}$, are known as tones; while those expressed as $\\frac{E}{F}$ and $\\frac{B}{C}$ are\nhalf tones. On examining the German-flute, the vents will be found to bear a corresponding relation to each other. Besides this peculiarity, it has been found, that the scale of seven notes, possesses another inequality. Dividing the scale into two tetrachords, expressed as C. D. E. F. and G. A. B. C.\u2014it is asserted, that there is not a strict mathematical equality between the two divisions. Though all assume this equality for practical purposes, there seems to be reason to suppose, that in this want of symmetry is hidden a key to the difficulty of tuning compound instruments like the organ and the piano-forte. And I further beg to remark, that the necessity for what are called \"the golden rules\" of harmony, has probably arisen from the difference, thus established by nature. There is no doubt, that the scale of intervals, as above described, is pleasing to an European ear. When it is considered, also, that in the course of improvement, the European instrument must have resulted by gradual perfection from its rudest and simplest form,\u2014we should consider it, as the result of endeavours tested by the criterion of a good ear, and assimilated to the standard of existing ideas. The native musician, however, by a timid reliance on mathematical intervals, has established an unnatural scale, to which his ear has been attuned by the force of habit. The European instrument is the creature of science: the native art is the creature of its instrument.\n\nThe scales of European and native music, are therefore, essentially different. And the idea which is sometimes entertained, that Sinhalese music is in the minor keys, is a libel on the music of the West. European airs, both in the major and minor scales, are vented by the same instrument. Thus, there are intermediate vents for the chromatic semi-tones, introduced in the eight-keyed flute. The notes sounded by these vents may accidentally coincide with those produced on a native instrument; but the acoustic and musical intervals will be found essentially different.\n\nIt follows from the preceding considerations, that in investigating Sinhalese music, the most perfect native instru-\nments should be obtained, their gamut ascertained; and, if necessary, a new system of notation adopted, every note of which should have a defined value and relation to the European musical scales. In obtaining instruments, Tamil ones, should not be confounded with Singhalese. Tamil music is I have no hesitation in saying, essentially diatonic in its character. And I could illustrate this by quoting an instance of an air, which I have myself heard sung by Malabars, which has been set to English words, and also incorporated in a set of Quadrilles by the omnivorous Jullien. It is well known, also, that Hindoo airs have not only been written in the European notation, but harmonized; which latter circumstance alone would be a test of unfailing efficacy.\n\nIn conclusion, I may indicate the means, by which I consider the investigation proposed, could be carried out by this Society.\n\n1st. By the addition to the Society's Museum of a complete collection of Singhalese instruments, duly authenticated.\n\n2ndly. By the contribution to the Society's Journal, of short accounts of native musical notation.\n\n3rdly. By the reduction to writing, of native melodies, using, if necessary, a peculiar musical scale.\n\nThe enquiry should be carried on with scientific curiosity; and the prejudices of the native should not be ridiculed, who delighted with his tom-tom, stops not to enquire the cause of his enjoyment. To him \"nothing is so tranquilizing as sweet poetry and the gentle udekkiya.\"\nA SYNOPSIS OF THE \"SAIVA SITT\u00c1NTAM.\"\n\nBY M. COOMARASAMY, ESQ., ADVOCATE.\n\nOf the various systems of Philosophy in which Hind\u00fa literature abounds, one of the most important is Saiva Sitt\u00e1ntam. Although the doctrines which it propounds are strictly esoteric, and calculated for the comprehension and enlightenment only of those who have been initiated into its mysteries, yet it is this system which forms the groundwork whereon the huge fabric of Hind\u00fa popular theology is based. It thus becomes the fountain head, whence the religious creed of millions of Hind\u00fas in India and Ceylon is derived. As such, it is worthy the attention of the public. The subject, however, is too extensive to be dealt with, in all its ramifications, within the limits of this contribution, and this crude attempt will therefore be confined to a rough pencilling out of the most prominent features of this vast panorama of literary and metaphysical grandeur.\n\nIt aspires to a divine origin, and assumes the authority of a direct revelation from God, it being asserted that \"Sivan (God), through his chamberlain Nanti, revealed to Sanatkum\u00e1ran in consequence of his high devotion, the system of sacred science, called Raurava Akamam.\" This Akamam is the principal authority on this subject, but the matter contained in it has likewise formed the theses of innumerable treatises of extensive learning and research, written by some of the most highly gifted men of genius of both ancient and modern Hind\u00fastan. The Tamil literati of Southern India have been particularly active in this department of human knowledge; and the results of their labour have been handed down to posterity in works clothed with the best, but the most difficult, strains\nof the rich and lofty Chen Tamil.* Amongst these, Siva N\u00e1na P\u00f3tam, by Meykand\u00e1 N\u00e1yan\u00e1r, Siva N\u00e1na Sitti, by Arunanti N\u00e1yanar; and Sivappirak\u00e1sam by Umdpati Asiri-yar, are held in the highest esteem. Our information will be traced chiefly from these sources.\n\nThe style of these writings is didactic, and they contain the best examples of Hind\u00fa dialectics, which, en passant, are considered by some to be at least an expansion of the syllogism of Aristotle, if not the origin thereof. It is no easy task even for the learned amongst the Tamils, to understand fully, and expound clearly and correctly, these elaborate treatises; and it must be confessed, that the effort to reproduce the ideas and sentiments contained in them, in an English garb, and in a manner acceptable and interesting to all, is not less difficult.\n\nSaiva Sitt\u00e1ntam professes to treat of\n\nI. Pati \u2014 God.\nII. Pasu \u2014 Soul.\nIII. P\u00e1sam\u2014Fetter, Chain.\u2020\n\nAn accurate and complete knowledge of the nature and bearings of these three subjects, denominated otherwise, Tripat\u00e1rttam, is of essential consequence, in the eyes of Hind\u00fa savants, for the attainment of the only true object of this life\u2014the Mutti, or heavenly bliss in the other.\n\nGod, Soul and P\u00e1sam are the three eternal and imperishable entities, whence the universe and all its chequered phenomena have sprung forth into existence, and whereinto all and every one of them will be ultimately resolved.\n\nAttention will be directed to each of them in their order.\n\n* There are two kinds of Tamil\u2014the one, High Tamil, called Chen Tamil\u2014the other, Low Tamil, called Kodun Tamil.\n\n\u2020 Lit. \"fetter\" \"chain,\" that which keeps the soul originally in a state of bondage and ignorance. This will be more fully explained hereafter.\nI. Pati\u2014God.\n\nPati is but one of the many names by which the supreme God is known to the Hind\u00fas. He is also called Piramam, Parappiramam, Para Sivan. The last term gives the characteristic name to the School of Indian philosophy under notice.\n\nThe existence of such a being, as the Creator of the World, is proved by means of various arguments. One of these happens to be identical with the argument which was first advanced by Socrates, but afterwards fully expounded in Paley's memorable work on Natural Theology. It is comprised in the following stanza from Siva N\u00e1na Sitti:\n\n\"As the whole world which is known under the designations of He, She, and It, comes into existence (without having existed previously), exists, and is destroyed, in an orderly manner, (it follows) that there is one who is the creator of this world, and who is the beginning and end in himself. His existence is permanent, and he is in the form of a spirit freed from (P\u00e1sam) evil from eternity.\"\n\nThis stanza admits also of a construction from which some commentators raise a fresh argument for the necessity of a Creator of the Universe. The reasoning is to the following effect:\n\n1. The world is not eternal: consequenter,\n2. It had a commencement and did not exist before such commencement: ergo,\n3. It could not have created itself; it requires some cause other than itself to bring it into existence.\n\nThe nature of God is to the following effect:\n\nThough God pervades the whole world, yet He is other than the world; for He is spiritual, and the world is material.\n\nAs sound and the tune, God and the world. As sound is to the tune, filling all its notes, so God is to the world, pervading all its forms.\n\nAs the fruit and the flavour, so God and the world. As flavour pervades all parts of the fruit, so God pervades the world from the first.\nHe is in intimate union with the Soul, yet He is other than the Soul.\n\nHe is eternal, pure, has no equals or superiors.\n\nHe has neither qualities, nor names,\u2014is omnipotent; is omniscient; is the source of understanding to innumerable souls; is illimitable in His nature; exists in the shape of N\u0101nam (divine wisdom); is the form of happiness; is difficult of access to unstable worshippers, but is easily approached by those who worship in the regular course; and shines as the least of the little and the greatest of the great.\"\n\nThe proof for the existence of a Creator, and the refutation of the tenets of Lok\u0101yatar, (the Indian Epicurean philosophers), and of other sects who maintain atheism, and attribute the world to chance, occupy many stanzas teeming with apt illustration and ingenious arguments in Sitti.\n\nThe next subject in order is\n\nII. Pasu\u2014SOUL.\n\nThe existence of a Soul within the human organism, and as different from \"mortal coil,\" is established by what is called O\u1e37ivu, \"the rule of exception,\" in Hind\u00fa Logic. The argument on this subject is as follows:\u2014\n\nA man says \"this thing is mine,\" \"that thing is not mine.\" Here it is evident that there is a thing owned or not owned, and a man owing or not owing. In the same manner, it is often said \"this is my body,\" \"this is my face,\" \"this is my hand.\" Here it is obvious that there exists something apart from the body\u2014the face and the hand\u2014and owing them: this is the Soul. Again it is usual to say \"I thought so,\" \"I did so,\" \"I said so.\" Here also there exists something other than the thought, the deed, and the saying: this something is the Soul.\n\nThere are also other arguments given for the existence of the human soul. These are based chiefly on the phenomena of Death and Sleep. They are to the following effect:\u2014\n\n1. At Death, all animation becomes extinct, through the human frame is left entire; consequenter,\n2. Animation must be traced to some other source than the human frame.\n\n3. This source is the Human Soul.\n\nAs to the nature of the Soul. It is not God, nor an emanation from God, as the Ved\u00e1ntists hold. It is an individual being: and eternal one, being uncreated and immortal. Souls are not one in essence, as some maintain; but are manifold and imperishable. In their primordial state they are not only unintelligent but even unconscious.\n\nThe third head of enquiry is\n\nIII. P\u00e1sam\u2014(FETTER, CHAIN.)\n\nThis P\u00e1sam is that which as it were binds the soul to a state of bondage, unconsciousness and ignorance, in its original state. It is subdivided into three parts. These are,\n\n1 Anava Malam.\n2 M\u00e1ya Malam.\n3 K\u00e1miya Malam.\n\nAnava Malam is the source of unconsciousness and ignorance to the soul.\n\nM\u00e1ya Malam is that which operates in the removal of the unconsciousness and ignorance of the soul, by becoming the material basis of the universe and man.\n\nK\u00e1miya Malam is the accumulation of merit and demerit acquired by the souls in their previous states of development in organised forms.\n\nThe term Malam means rust or dirt: the three Malam forming the rust or dirt of the soul in its original state of non-development.\n\nP\u00e1sam exists from eternity and is imperishable, except so far as M\u00e1ya Malam and K\u00e1miya Malam are concerned. When the two latter are removed from the soul, and Anava Malam loses its strength, then the soul will be liberated from the grasp of P\u00e1sam, and be ripe for attaining Mutti or heaven.\nIV. THE RELATION BETWEEN GOD, SOUL AND P\u00c1SAM.\n\nGod exists from eternity, alone, by himself, apart from the Soul and P\u00e1sam. But the two latter are linked in intimate union with each other\u2014P\u00e1sam enveloping the Soul. This abnormal condition of the Soul is from eternity. It is unaccountable. It is a mystery. Here the Soul lies in a state of bondage, denuded even of thought.\u2014In consequence, it is miserable and unhappy. This relation of P\u00e1sam to the Soul is analogous to that which subsists between the husk of the paddy and the rice which it envelopes, or between the rusty coating and the copper which it conceals.\n\nThis link between the Soul and P\u00e1sam is not, however, indissoluble. The chain will be severed\u2014the soul will gain its freedom. It will ultimately be drawn away from the grasp of the Archangel of Evil\u2014P\u00e1sam, and be received into the bosom of the summum bonum\u2014God. It will then shine in its true and resplendent glory in the august presence of the King of the Universe\u2014even in mystic union with Parappiramam. This is Mutti. Here the soul does not lose its individuality, nor is it annihilated. But it exists in Attuvitam\u2014unity in duality. This is called Sdyucchiyam\u2014the heaven of the Saiva Sitt\u00e1ntists, as Nirv\u00e1na is that of the V\u00e9t\u00e1ntists and Buddhists.\n\nV. MAN.\n\nTo break through its thraldom the soul had not the power. But God, who is \u201can Ocean of mercy,\u201d pitied the soul in its distress. He willed that the soul should be freed from the clutches of P\u00e1sam, and simultaneously with the will, the fiat went forth, that the soul should be developed in human organism, or in other words, that man should be created. In this manner the soul descends to this universe, for it is here that the course lies where the soul is to run its race from the goal of evil\u2014P\u00e1sam, to the goal of good\u2014God. Creation is not one of the \u201cbeautiful plays of God.\u201d It is pregnant with a serious purport. Its object is the deliverance of the soul;\nfor P\u00e1sam, before it will relax its hold on the soul, demands satisfaction for the loss it sustains in parting with it. The demand has been met by summoning this world and man into existence. And here, when he shall have \"balanced off his demerit by his merit\"\u2014his evil deeds by his good deeds\u2014he will then, and then alone, stand in a position fit for liberation.\n\nThe development of the soul in the human organism, is, according to this system of philosophy, curious, if not interesting. It views man as a microcosm. All the essential constituents of the boundless universe are coiled up likewise proportionately in puny man. And as God is the King of the Universe, so is the Soul, the king of the miniature universe\u2014man.\n\nMan is said to be composed of ninety-six Tattuvam\u2014a word, which like many other technical terms of this school, does not admit of being rendered in English, although the words, \"category, principle, power, organ, property,\" approximate it in meaning. The order in which the Tattuvam are evolved from Pati and P\u00e1sam, their names and their characteristic properties, and the parts which they are intended to play in the human organism, are given with great minuteness in the works above mentioned. But notice will here be taken of only the principal Tattuvam.\n\nBy the grace of Pati there was developed from Sutta M\u0101yai\u2014pure elemental matter which was united with deity from eternity\u2014N\u0101tam, the male energy of Pati: from N\u0101tam was evolved Vintu, the female energy of Pati: from Vintu, Sat\u0101kkiyam, in which both the male and female energies inhere: from Sat\u0101kkiyam, Isuran, the obscuring God: and from him, Uruttiran, the destroying God. These divine developments are associated with the soul with a view of prompting it on towards final deliverance.\n\nFor the use of these developments, and for the purpose of drawing the soul out from its state of unconsciousness, as it exists imbedded in P\u00e1sam, into a state of intelligence and\nactivity, there are evolved, from the above mentioned Vintu, the four V\u0101kku, which may be translated \"organic bases of intelligence.\" These are\n\n1. S\u016bkkumai.\n2. Paisanti.\n3. Vaikari.\n4. Mattimai.\n\nAll these were unfolded from pure elemental matter, and by the agency of Pati. The productions that follow were drawn out of P\u0101sam\u2014impure elemental matter\u2014and by the instrumentality of the divine developments detailed above.\n\nBy the grace of Sutakkhiyam, there are evolved from Asutta M\u0101yai, impure elemental matter,\n\n1. K\u0101lam\u2014Time.\n2. Niyati\u2014Fate.\n3. Kalai\u2014Continency.\n\nK\u0101lam attaches to souls the results of past time, the fruit of the present time, and whatever is new in future time. Niyati will make sure to souls their respective Kanmam, i.e., the due need for their good and bad deeds. Kalai operates to a certain extent in the removal of P\u0101sam.\n\nFrom Kalai are developed,\n\n1. Vittai\u2014the power of thought; and from Vittai,\n2. R\u0101kam\u2014the desire to relish the pleasures of sense, which was necessary to make the souls eat the fruits of merit and demerit.\n\nAgain, by the grace of Uruttiran, Pirakiruti is evolved from Kalai. From Pirakiruti, which is the material basis of the subsequent productions, spring the Mukkanam, the three moral properties, viz.:\n\n1. Sattu Vikam\u2014(lit. \"goodness.\") This prompts the soul to divine wisdom; to truth and love.\n2. Rasatam\u2014(lit. \"passion.\") Here lie the propensities to pride and selfishness.\n3. Tamatam\u2014(lit. \"darkness\") cause of laziness, stupidity, drowsiness.\nThe position of the three moral qualities, as they exist undeveloped in Pirakiruti, is called Aviyaktam. From this is evolved,\n\n1. Sittam\u2014the thinking principle. From Sittam,\n2. Putti\u2014judgment. And from Putti,\n3. Akan\u0331k\u0101ram\u2014This is the individualizing principle.\n\nThis Akan\u0331k\u0101ram is threefold, viz.\n\n1. Taisatha-akan\u0331k\u0101ram, wherefrom manam, (mind) the understanding and the five perceptive organs are evolved.\n2. Vaikari-akan\u0331k\u0101ram, wherefrom \"the five organs of action\" are evolved. These are the mouth, the feet, the hands, and the excretory organs.\n3. Put\u0101ti-akan\u0331k\u0101ram, wherefrom the five rudimental elements are evolved. These are Sound, Touch, Form, Taste, Smell;\u2014these are called Tanm\u0101ttirai.\n\nFrom Sound is evolved ether; from Touch, air; from Form, fire; from Taste, water; from Smell, earth.\n\nThese are the essential items that make up man, and from these above enumerated Tattuvams, many other subsidiary ones are developed to make up the 96 Tattuvams. This part of the Saiva Sitt\u0101ntam often proves difficult to many, and an incipient Hind\u00fa philosopher devotes the first months of his study to an investigation of it.\n\nThe intelligent and active state of the soul is called S\u0101kkiram, when all the 96 Tattuvams are in full vigor and play, and when the soul takes its seat in the forehead between the eyebrows. Soppanam is the state when a man is asleep. Here all but twenty-four of the Tattuvams are lulled into inactivity, and the soul descends to a seat in the neck. It experiences here only what it had seen in S\u0101kkiram. This is the phenomenon of dreams. Sulutti is the stage below Soppanam. Here the soul exists in the heart in company with only two Tattuvams\u2014the will and the vital principle. The soul is incapable of distinguishing anything here. From this, the soul drops down into the navel, and exists in the state\ncalled *Turiyam*, in union with the vital principle alone. Here it ceases to think. Next below is the *Turiydtitam*, where the soul descends deprived of even the vital principle. This is Death.\n\nThe polar star of life is then, according to this Philosophy, the deliverance of the *Pasu* from the *P\u00e1sam*. But *Pasu* soon loses sight of this object. The soul once set in motion in the human organism revolves on from life to death\u2014from death to life,\u2014from birth to birth,\u2014from age to age,\u2014ever bounding away from God, and never rebounding towards him; as if it were a planet of the solar system actuated by some chance or other by the centrifugal force alone, without the co-operation of the centripetal force likewise; until its wayward course is arrested and a new direction given to it toward the centre of the orbit\u2014even *Pati*\u2014\"the Sun of wisdom.\" This takes place at last when the soul's merit and demerit (*kanman*) have been cancelled, and there is no residue left to be eaten up at future births. Then there will be a cessation of births, and the soul will be ripe for liberation. The state of a man who has arrived at this phase of existence is called *Tivira Satti nip\u00e1tam*. It is thus described in *Sivappirak\u00e1sam*:\n\n\"For such a man this world will possess no charm. He will ignore it. He will loathe his own body in the same manner in which the bearers of a worm-eaten corpse will detest it, when, on their way to the burial ground, the worms fall on them. When he finds himself in union with the warring mental faculties within his bosom, he will feel like an elephant in the paw of a lion. When he sees that he is in co-operation with the organs of sense and the organs of action, he will cry out like a frog in a snake's mouth. The way in which he will fear the influence of his family and friends, and leave them, is like that in which one, who has lain down to rest without knowing that there was a snake in his bed, will on awaking and seeing the snake, hasten away with terror; or like that in which a person whose house is on fire, leaves his goods and hastens to escape by some way or other which he sees.\"\nThe following stanza, from *Siva N\u0101na sitti*, gives with great pathos and beauty (which are however lost in a translation) the manner in which God will reclaim the lost soul.\n\n\"As a king, whose son had stayed away from him and lived in ignorance of his father amongst the *Viddu* (wild men), will, on discovering the son, exclaim to him 'Come to me, oh, thou darling child of mine!' and make him a participator of the happiness that he (the king) himself enjoys; so even will the Supreme God present himself before the soul when in distress, from being enmeshed in the net of the five *Vit\u0101s*\u2014senses, and severing the soul from Pasam, will assimilate it to himself and bless it with his holy feet.\"\n\nSuch is an imperfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the *\u015aaiva Sitt\u0101ntam*. A greater amplification of the subject is reserved for a future contribution, where the intimate connection that subsists between the *\u015aaiva Sitt\u0101ntam* and the popular form of religious worship that obtains among the Hind\u016bs of the present age, will engage our attention.\nTERMS OF ADDRESS AND MODES OF SALUTATION IN USE AMONGST THE SI\u1e44HALESE.\n\nBY JAMES ALWIS, ESQ., ASSISTANT SECRETARY.\n\nThere is not perhaps a greater difficulty experienced by Europeans* in their intercourse with the Natives of this country, than that of correctly applying the forms of salutation and address known amongst them. Often have we suppressed a smile forced upon us, on hearing European authorities address a peon or other servant thus: \"Pion ara pota gen-ent\u0101,\" \"Mudiyans\u0113ta an\u1e0dagahapan,\" \"Arachchita kiy\u1e0dpan,\" &c. Frequently, too, have we heard Europeans enquire with indignation, whether certain terms as applied by their Interpreters to witnesses were not insulting or offensive. Not long ago the native portion of an entire Court was much amused on hearing counsel in his address to the Court, apply the term Walawwa to indicate the residence of a poor low caste person, his client. The difficulty of acquiring the proper use and application of terms of address, so as on the one hand not to offend, and on the other not to give too much respect, to the person addressed, seems to have been so greatly felt by Mr. Justice Stark, that he has devoted considerable attention to the study of the subject. The interesting information which he acquired, he has embodied in a paper which is found published in the Ceylon Asiatic Society's Journal for 1853. That paper, gives the reader an imperfect account of the numerous forms of salutation and address used by the Siphaese.\n\n* \"No people of the East are more critical as to style, or more fastidious as to terms, than the natives of Ceylon.\"\u2014Tennent Christianity in Ceylon, p. 265.\nthe topics, however, upon which he has dwelt are very interesting, the writer has in his observations followed the order of the subjects treated therein.\n\nMr. Justice Stark begins with what he considers \"the fundamental terms of address,\" and gives as such six\u2014t\u014d, tam\u0101, tamus\u0113, tamunneh\u0113, tamunnans\u0113 and tamunvanhans\u0113\u2014with the various degrees of respect or disrespect with which each is associated in the native mind. As pronouns of the second person derived from the root ta, they are certainly distinguishable from a variety of others, which are now used as \"terms of address;\" but in the enumeration of the latter class Mr. Justice Stark has fallen into a few errors. Of these I many here notice seven omissions, which are pronouns of the third person, applied as terms of address in the second person, viz. umbah\u0113, umba, nuba, oba, oba-vahans\u0113, nuba-vahans\u0113 and muba-vahans\u0113 of which the last two only are noticed by Mr. Stark.\n\nIt is unnecessary to remark on the above omitted terms, as I have fully treated of them in the Sidat Sangar\u0101wa; (pp. 153-168,) but it will be observed, that Mr. Stark is far from being correct when he states that nuba-vahans\u0113 is the term now employed in lieu of oba-vahans\u0113. If he meant, in reference to the Scriptures, of which a new version is being prepared under the auspices of the Bible Society, he was correct; but if otherwise, I need scarcely remark that oba-vahans\u0113 is the term in universal use amongst the Sinhalese. There is, nevertheless, no objection to the change in the forthcoming version of the Bible, especially in view of the fact, that like (see post extract from Ratand-waliya,) is the term frequently found in books.\n\nThe term vahans\u0113, though now no longer used, except as an affix, was nevertheless anciently used by itself to convey what an Englishman would express by \"your Excellency,\" \"your Majesty,\" \"your Highness,\" or \"your Lordship.\"\nThus in the *Am\u0101watura*:\n\n\"Please your Lordship,\" said he, \"I will firmly stand by the truth,\" &c.\n\nThe word *vahans\u00e9*, like many other terms of address, of which we may mention *nuba,* had not originally a plural form; although in modern usage *la* is affixed to signify more than one. It was probably this peculiarity which Mr. Justice Stark failed to notice, when he remarked, at pp. 72, 73, that \"the term *vahans\u00e9* was applied to the Buddhist priesthood in an associated or collective capacity, as in the passage \u2014*in the J\u0101takapota*\u2014where, the reader will observe, five priests are spoken of\u2014an association of five priests to whom Buddha delivered his first sermon.\"\n\nSpeaking of *vahans\u00e9* as an honorific term by itself, which cannot be called a pronoun, I may here notice a few others of the kind which convey different and various degrees of respect to the person addressed. They are *ad\u00e9* or *ad\u00f3*, *bola*, *bandayi*, used as \"terms of address\" with *t\u00f3*: as *ad\u00e9* *t\u00f3* 'Come here, fellow;' *bola* *t\u00f3* 'To whom didst thou thus speak, fellow?' *bandayi* *t\u00f3* 'Why, fellow, did I tell thee to take the lease?' &c.\n\nThese epithets, like the pronoun *s\u00f3*, are used both in an affectionate and a contemptuous sense; sometimes by the higher towards the lower classes; and sometimes also by the lower classes towards each other. This promiscuous use, however, militates against the supposition to which Mr. Stark has adverted, that *s\u00f3* is derived from *s\u00f3* 'dross,' 'rubbish.' *s\u00f3* and *s\u00f3* are derived from *s\u00f3* and *s\u00f3* respectively, and mean 'Behold'\u2014whence they are used as vocatives or terms of address.\n\n---\n\n* See *Sidat Saggar\u00e1wa*, p. clvii.\n\n\u2020 See Ceylon Asiatic Society's Journal, vol.

This last, as well as \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf, I am inclined to believe to be of Tamil origin.\n\nThere is another word \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf, which I shall notice here. It is only used when no other term can be properly applied to a person either without offence or without conveying too much respect. The reader should, however, bear in mind not to confound this work with another of a sound \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf \"he\" or \"yonder person,\" which is used in familiar intercourse amongst the Sinhalese to signify a person near the person spoken to, or opposite to the person speaking. Like \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf may be used in the third person, when the degree of respect due to the person spoken of, is uncertain or unknown.\n\nI may also here notice another class of words which are terms of address, other than vocatives, and used as honorifics to particular individuals, as; \"Mudianse ralahami,\"\u2020 \"Mohandiram mahatmayad,\" \"Lekam mahatmayad,\" \"Arachchi rala,\" &c.; but I prefer following the order of the learned writer before me, who treating of the honorific \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf makes the following remarks at p. 69.\u2021\n\n\"\u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf (vahans\u0113) is added as an affix to the term for God, and to all the names of God; as also in some relative expressions, as to Father in the Lord's prayer, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf \u0db8\u0dc4\u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dcf Apag\u0113 piy\u0101nan-vahans\u0113.\n\n\"But under the word \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf (Dewiyanvahans\u0113) Clough points out the difference in its use. Innumerable instances, he says, occur of\n\n* When a native wishes to convey that he is on good terms with another, he would say:-\u2014\"Why, we address each other umba and bolan.\"\n\n\u2020 The Kandyans use \"Mudianse-mahatmayad,\" but this is a provincialism.\n\n\u2021 Here, as elsewhere, the references are to Mr. Justice Stark's Essay on Forms of Salutation, &c., in the Society's Journal for 1853.\nthe honorific being used in the vocative, in which case it may be addressed not only to one of these beings (the gods of Swarga,) but also to a king or any person of rank; but when used in the nominative, it marks at once the difference between a heathen god and the Supreme being.\"\n\nMr. Clough it would seem is incorrect in supposing that \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dda in the nominative alone, conveys the difference between the Supreme being and a heathen god. For, the difference is not the less marked in the oblique cases (except the vocative) owing to the definite form of the expression; from which circumstance alone are Christians enabled to limit its application to the one Jehovah of their faith. This distinction, though trifling, nevertheless furnishes the strongest possible argument in favor of \"the continual recurrence of the honorifics in Sinhalese translations of the Holy Scriptures,\" which, however, says Mr. Stark \"soon offends Europeans, and in some cases, as 'Jehovah vahans\u00e9,' the affix almost shocks, coming upon the ear like some discordance in an otherwise heavenly melody.\" If the repetition of honorifics be, as doubtless it is, offensive to the European ear accustomed to the simplicity of that language, 'whose soul is brevity;' the absence of their recurrence is not the less offensive to the Sinhalese, whose notions of the beauty of a language are diametrically opposed to those expressed by the bard of Avon.\n\nIt is remarkable that the Sinhalese \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dda, devi like the English word 'God,' is descriptive\u2014the former signifying 'splendour' or 'beauty' or 'purity' of the object to which it is applied, as \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dda, \"The divine majesty of the Sun,\" or as in the Milindappra\u1e47a, simply \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dda, 'the divinity of the Sun:' and the latter the 'goodness' of the being who is designated by that term. Like the English word 'god,' the Sinhalese \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dda is also used by us to signify \"a prince, a ruler, a magistrate,\" (Exod. xxii. Psal. xcvii.) or any person exalted too much in estimation, or deified and honored as the chief god. (Phil. iii.) But there is a distinction which some writers have drawn between devi as applied to a god of Swarga, and the same when used as a term of address to kings, &c. It is\nthus noticed by Mr. Justice Stark in the following note; but without perceiving the difference in their orthography:\n\n\"The same term Dewiyanwahans\u0113 (Dewiyanwahans\u0113) is employed by Mr. Alwis in his Sinhalese version of the Hit\u014dpad\u0113sa as the corresponding phrase for 'Please Your Majesty!'\"*\n\nThe reader will however observe, that both in the extract from the \"Th\u00fapawa\u1e47\u1e63a\" in my \"Sidat-Sangar\u0101wa,\" (p. cixxv,) and in my Sinhalese version of the Hit\u014dpad\u0113sa (pp. 205-6.) *Deviy\u0101n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a* and *Deviy\u0101na\u1e47a* are alone used to express \"His Majesty,\" and not *Deviy\u0101n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a* and *Deviy\u0101na\u1e47a*, which latter are applied to the various deities of Swarga.\n\nThe words *pati*, *indu*, *indra*, *isuru*, *li\u015bvara*, *nd*, *ndyaka*, each signifying 'chief,' when added to words indicating 'earth' are appellations of Kings. Thus, *Indru* or *Indru*, *Indra*, *Indra*, *Indra*, *Indra*, *Indra*, *Indra*, or *Indra*, *Indra*, *Indra*, *Indra*, &c. With a view to gratify the vanity of kings, who anciently laid claim to universal empire,\u2020 they were so designated; and also *devi*, *dev\u012b*, *dev\u012b*, or *dev\u012b*, in the sense of 'nourisher of the world.' In the sense of being 'the chief of men,' a king is called *deva*, or *deva*, *deva*, *deva*, *deva*, *deva*, &c. The designations for 'Queen' are not many. They are *devi* and *devi*, and are changed into *devi* and *devi*, when applied to a Queen who has been crowned, or an Empress. The words *deviyanwaraya* and *deviyanara* are changed into *deviyanawana* and *deviyanara* (see \"Sidat Sangar\u0101wa,\" p. 205,) when we intend to express \"Her Majesty\"; the term for 'goddess' being usually *devi* formed like the ancient term for a 'princess' *devi* or *devi*.\n\n* Devi, literally 'Goddess,' but applied to a Queen, as the masculine form Deva is especially the title of a King.

The vain and 'flattering titles' (Job. xxxii. 22,) which the Sinhalese Kings received in ancient times, expressive of the most eminent qualities, were many and various.\u2014See Burder's Oriental Customs, p. 189.\nIn the sense in which it is applied to man, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab is synonymous with \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab, from whence we have \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db0\u0db1\u0dba 'His Excellency the Governor,' \"which is the title\" says Mr. Stark, \"given by the translators on one occasion to the Governor of Judea\" at Matt. xxvii. 2. The word \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba, 'He who is great' is derived from Pali, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba and is equivalent to \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba 'chief; \"excellent,\" high,' but Mr. Stark is far from being correct when he supposes that \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba, which is derived from the Sanskrit \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba, has any relation to \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba or to \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba in the line of the royal poet:\n\n\"\u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba.\"\n\nHere \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba, from \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab 'name,' and \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba 'having,' which means \"named\" has no connection whatever with \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba. Meti Sinhalese, metes Greek, mantra Sanskrit, mati Pali, mens mentis Latin, are the words which stand in fraternal connection with each other, having been probably derived, like manas, mens, and mind from the root man 'to understand.' From \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba the Sinhalese have coined a beautiful compound \u0d85\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba for 'Legislative Council,' and it is fully expressive of the nature and working of the particular Deliberative Assembly, for which it is a designation.\n\nMr. Stark proceeds to an investigation of the titles and titular ranks amongst the Sinhalese, and finds nothing of the nature of the English nobility. If the learned writer here refers to the peculiarity of the relation in which the nobility of England stands to the Commonalty, he is right. For Ceylon has no nobility, which, as in England, sends down members to mingle with the people. Here the distinction of caste and class is the barrier which divides the nobleman from the commoner. Whilst there, in England, the ranks of the nobility are largely recruited from among others, there is here a wide gulf between them which neither wealth, interest, nor education enables the plebeian to cross. There it is regarded as \"no disparagement for the daughter of a Duke, nay of a royal Duke, to espouse a distinguished commoner.\"*\n\n* Macaulay's \"History of England,\" pp. 37, 38.\nis quite the reverse.* Whilst therefore, there are these and other differences which distinguish the English nobility from all hereditary aristocracies in the world, there is also some similarity between the English and Sinhalese nobility. As no title raised any one to the rank of 'Thane' amongst the German Saxons, except noble birth and the possession of land; so amongst the Sinhalese, in an early age, none were regarded as of the nobility who were devoid of those qualifications.\n\nA long line of ancestry descended from good blood in the highest caste (the Goyi-wa\u1e47\u1e0di, the cultivators or Vell\u0101\u1e37ast) alone constituted in Ceylon, the nobility of the land.\u2020 Between good blood and the privileges of the nobility, there was (for my remarks have reference to the past, when Ceylon was governed by the Sinhalese Kings) an important connection. The various officers of the state, including Prime Ministers, Ministers, and Provincial chiefs, were selected from those who could trace back an honorable descent through many generations. They formed the first or chief class of society: and those who bore titles, as well as those who stood with them on an equal footing in point of birth, constituted the nobility of the land. To this body, which increased only with their families, no accessions were ever made, except as we find, from two classes of persons. One, the natural children of Kings and Princes, who were alone entitled to the appellation of Bandara; and the other, those whom the Monarch had honoured by raising to, what Mr. Stark calls, the \"eminent\n\n* \"The marriage of a man with a woman of a superior caste to himself is prohibited, and even carnal connection between the sexes of different castes is penal, especially the connection of a higher caste woman with a low-caste man.\"\u2014Sawyer's Kandyan Law, p. 26.\n\n\u2020 \"The Goyi-wa\u1e47\u1e0di, Goyi-yama, Rat\u00e9, or Handuruc\u00f3, compriseth the Bandara waliya; families of the highest rank, who claim descent from Princes.\"\u2014Armour's Kandian Law, p. 3.\n\n\u2021 \"It is the more usual course for the cultivators of the soil to be regarded as forming the noblest class of the people, next to that who held rank as hereditary princes; they are the cupatrids; they form the timocracy; and it is from them the rulers of the state are chosen; as delegates of the King when the Government is monarchical, as temporary chiefs when it is an aristocracy.\"\u2014Spence Hardy Buddhism, p. 75.\nplace\" of Situ. Various instances, as those of Ghosaka, Pawarika, Mahadana, Sumana, &c., may be adduced from native records, of persons created Situ, simply owing to their great wealth.\n\nThis may however, appear strange, when we reflect on the hindrance of caste to the social system in the East. One would be led also to believe, that something more than mere wealth was necessary to give claim to the privileges of this distinguished title. Not so. There is perhaps not a single instance on record by which we could find that there was any other recommendation for this gift of Royalty, except the great wealth of the recipient. Of course, it is not to be supposed that this high distinction was conferred on the Chasadda,* the lowest of the low in point of caste\u2014men, who by reason of their mean birth, were regarded as fit for nothing but the office of public executioners;\u2020 but such of my readers as are read in Buddhistical scriptures, know that Mahadugiy\u0101 \"the great-beggar,\" whose destitute circumstances had been like those of Lazarus in the parable of Christ, was raised to the nobility, on his acquiring a great treasure by his meritorious conduct towards Buddhism.\n\nThere is also an instance in the Rutanda-waliya, of a poor Situ's servant acquiring great wealth by reason of his charities, and of his thereupon being created a Situ or nobleman. The legend, after describing the nature of his charities and their result, proceeds thus:\n\n*The Seda or Chandala is represented as one who is born in the open air; his parents not being possessed of the smallest hut, where, as he lies among the pots when his mother goes to cut firewood, he is suckled by the bitch along with her own pups.\" \u2014Spence Hardy on Buddhism, p.86.\n\n\u2020 See Wilson's \"Hindu Theatre,\" vol. i. p. 159.\nThat is to say:\u2014\n\n\"They heaped up the gold in the compound; and the heap was about eighty cubits high. The King summoned the citizens and inquired of them, if there was any other in the city who owned such an immense wealth. They replied, that insignificant men could not possess so much, when His Majesty himself had it not. When the King had heard this reply, he said that the owner of such wealth was indeed a fit object for the nobility (Situ);* conferred on him further riches; hoisted up the white canopy of state; created him a Situ; and named him Bahudhana Situna, or 'The great opulent Situ.'\"\n\nIf therefore, from the fact of a Situ's being a nobleman by creation, and of his being thereby entitled to the privileges\u2020 of the Sinhalese nobility, a comparison may be instituted between an English Baronet and a Sinhalese Situ, I trust my observations in the \"Sidat Saggarawa,\" to which Mr. Stark refers, were not misconceived.\n\nIt appears from the \"Mahawansa\" that the consort of Asoka, the great Monarch of India, was the daughter of a Situ. The passage to which I refer is the following: \"While Prince Asoka was ruling over the Awanti country by the appointment of his own father, on a journey to Ujjeni he arrived at Chetiya; and while tarrying there having gained the affections of the lovely princess Dewi, the daughter of a Setthi, he lived with her.\"\u2014Mahawansa, p. 76.\n\n* Setti or Hetti is still vulgarly used to signify 'a rich man;' as for instance, speaking of a man hoarding up riches. It appears from Hind\u00fa books also, that a Situ, who is called in Sanskrit Sreshthi, and whom Professor Wilson designates \"Chief of the Merchants\"\u2014perhaps from the circumstance of his opulence\u2014was a nobleman who took part in the affairs of the State. In the Hind\u00fa play denominated The Toy Cart, in Wilson's Hind\u00fa Theatre, vol. i., p. 145, a Sreshthi is introduced as the Judge of \"Recorder\" of a Court.\n\n\u2020 This is a proper name, and not a designation implying 'Queen,' as in the following passage in the Ratanawaliya, the Hind\u00fa play:\n\n\"Madam, You justly possess the title of devi.\"\nAlthough the children by this lady were admitted into the privileges to which princes were usually entitled; yet it would seem, that upon As\u00f3ka's ascending his father's throne of P\u00e1\u1e6daliputra, D\u00e9vi was not crowned 'Queen consort.' From this circumstance* we gather, that a Si\u1e6du was equal in rank to a Prime Minister, or even Sub-King, but inferior to the Royal family.\n\nWhilst on the subject of Monarchical councillors, of whom a Si\u1e6du was undoubtedly one, we may here glance at the state of that Council, the want of information regarding which Mr. Stark remarks. But in doing so, it may perhaps not be out of place to notice a few of the titles of address of those who composed the Executive Government of La\u1e45k\u00e1.\n\nAlthough the Government of Ceylon was in the abstract a Despotic Monarchy, where the will of the Sovereign passed into a law; yet it is remarkable that in ancient times, when pious and talented princes ruled over the destinies of this Island, nothing of any importance was done or decreed without the advice of the Am\u00e1tya-ma\u00f1\u1e0dala or the Council of State. Indeed the Institutes of Manu, which formed the basis of the polity of all Indian Governments, including that of Ceylon, required that the Sovereign should be assisted by his Ministers.\u2020 Thus, we read in history, that whilst different parts of the Island which constituted subordinate principalities, were each placed under a Yuva-r\u00e1ja or 'Sub-\n\n---\n\n* \"The mother of the Thero Mahinda, (son of Asoka) sending her children to the King's court, continued to reside herself at the city of Ch\u0113tiyagiri.\" Introduction to Mah\u0101wagasa, p. xlvii.\n\n\u2020 \"And all that must be done by him (the King) for the protection of his people with the assistance of good ministers, I will declare to you as the law directs in due order.\"\u2014Manu, chap. vii. \u00a7 36. \"Let them perpetually consult with those Ministers on peace and war, on his force, on his revenues, on the protection of his people, &c. Having ascertained the several opinions of his council'ors, first apart and then collectively, let him do what is most beneficial for him in public affairs.\"\u2014Ib. \u00a7\u00a7 56, 57.)\nKing,' the chief kingdom was presided over* by the Muha-rdja or Monarch himself, who had no less than seven Councillors, or Ministers attached to his Court. In later times, however, this number was reduced to four; and yet these four, with the King at their head, formed the Cabal, Cabinet, or the Privy Council of Ceylon. Collectively, their duty was to assist the King in the executive and legislative functions of Government, which were vested in the King; but individually, they had separate duties assigned to them. The \"Premier\" was the Pur\u00f3hita Minister; and when a Br\u00e1hmin, he was the domestic Chaplain of Br\u00e1hmin Kings. He was to attend on the Kings; that is, he was attached to the King's household. One had the care of the Metropolis, \"Home affairs,\" in respect of which he may perhaps be styled, \"the Secretary for the Home Department,\" whilst another was \"the Minister for Foreign affairs,\" and the dispenser of Justice; the latter office being analogous to that of the Lord Chancellor of England. The fourth was \"the Minister of War.\"\n\nThe Sinhalese Ministers of State, latterly, received the appellation of \"Adigars,\" i.e. Adik\u00e1ran, from adhi 'over,' 'above,' 'upon,' implying superiority in place; and karana the instrument in the sense of executive;\" but little mention of them is made in ancient books, which only refer to meti or mantri \"Councillors.\"\n\nIt is foreign to my purpose here, to enter into a consideration of the different duties attached to them, the perquisites to which they were entitled, and the privileges which they enjoy. In pursuing my investigation of the names of native\n\n---\n\n* In the Raja Tarangini these seven officers are stated to be 'The Justiciary or Chancellor,' 'Treasurer,' 'Master of the Military Stores,' 'Commander in Chief,' and 'Messenger or Ambassador,' 'Royal Chaplain,' and 'the Chief Astrologer.'\u2014See \"Asiatic Researches,\" xv. p. 21. Also in Manu, \u00a7 54. \"The King must appoint seven or eight Ministers.\"\n\n\u2020 From this inseparable preposition adhi, we obtain adhipati, a term which may be properly used to signify \"Chairman,\" \"President,\" and even \"Judge\" or \"Governor.\"\ntitles, and their significations, I shall pass on to the \"Officers of the Palace,\"* or the King's household.\n\nIt consisted of a great many office-bearers. Dr. Davy, (who was indebted for the interesting account which he has published of these officers to Mill\u0119w\u0119, the Disawa of Wellassa,) gives 36. A Gajandyaka Nilami seems to have been the principal of them. As the term implies, he was 'the Chief over the Elephants;' and probably his superiority over the rest arose from the great estimation in which elephants were anciently held, as one of the \u1e28ay\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\u1e6d\u1e6da or 'the four constituent armies of war.' His office was analogous to that of \"The Master of the Horse\" in England; and under him was placed a L\u0113kam or 'Recorder,' who obtained the designation of K\u016bruw\u0113 L\u0113kam, the word K\u016bruw\u0113 signifying his connection with the 'Elephant department.'\n\nThe Maha Aramudal Wannaku Nilami was the 'Lord of the Treasury,' an office of the highest rank, which corresponded with that of B\u0101nd\u0101g\u0101rika, and to which anciently even princes were appointed, as for instance, Prince Ghota-bhaya.\u2020 The Maha Gubad\u0101 Nilami, and the U\u1e0da Gubad\u0101 Nilami, were also 'Treasurers,' each with distinct duties to perform. The officer answering to the \"Lord Chamberlain\" of the English Court, may perhaps be identified with the Haluwa\u1e0dana Nilami of the S\u012bghalese. He brought to the King his apparel, his sword, crown, &c. He dressed and undressed the King, and waited on him for the purpose of adjusting his dress. The Batuwa\u1e0dana Nilami, the officer who had the management of the royal table, and the Diyawa\u1e0dana Nilami, who superintended the royal bath, were officers who approach very near to the \"Lord Steward\" of England. Under these were many subordinate officers, of whom Sat-tambis were the people who poured water on the King at his bath, and Pihanur\u0101las were royal cooks. It is needless to enter into a minute detail of the names of the other officers.\n\n* Davy's Ceylon, p. 143. \u2020 See Attanagaluwa\u1e45sa, and also Mah\u0101wanssa.\nThey are chiefly descriptive of their several occupations. The reader may obtain a great deal of information on the subject by a reference to Davy's Account of Ceylon, where the names are given at length, with an account of the various duties which the officers performed.\n\nThe Ceylon Council of State, and our ancient Court were not unlike those of the Hind\u00fas. From the mention of various terms which occur in books, we gather that the members of whom the Sighalese Court consisted, were the same that are referred to in the Hind\u00fa Plays;* such as, Mantri or \"Councillor,\" D\u016bta\u2020 or \"Messengers,\" Wadhakaya \"Death's Minister,\"\u2014of which there were two kinds, wild animals, such as elephants and horses, and Wadakaru or \"executioners,\"\u2020 Ch\u016bra purusa or \"spy,\" N\u0101n\u0101yak k\u0101ra or \"disguised emissary or informer.\"\u2021\n\n* The Court looks like a Sea,\u2014its Councillors Are deep engulphed in thought; its tossing waves Are wrangling Advocates; its brood of monsters Are those wild animals\u2014death's Ministers\u2014 Attornies skim like wily snakes the surface\u2014 Spies are the shell-fish cowering 'midst its weeds, And vile Informers, like the hovering curlew Hang fluttering o'er then pounce upon their prey!\n\nPr. Wilson's \"Hindu Plays,\" i. p. 149.\n\n\u2020 This word Pr. Wilson interprets to mean \"attornies,\" or \"the envoys or representatives of the parties.\" Loc. cit. i. p. 149. Note.\n\n\u2021 Tradition says, that in ancient times in Ceylon, a criminal underwent the same ordeal that is described in the following passage in the Buddhistical annals:\u2014\"In aforetime, the Wajjian ru'ers, on a person, being brought and presented to them, thus charged: 'this is a malefactor dispose of him accordingly.' They surrender him to the Winichchhaya mah\u0101-machha or 'chief Judicial Officer.' Having examined him, if they conceive 'this man is not a culprit,' they release him. If they decide, 'this is a malefactor,' without awarding any penalty, they transfer him to the Wohdrika, 'learned in the laws.' They also having investigated the matter, discharge him, if he be innocent; but if he be guilty, there are certain officers called Suttad\u016bra, 'maintainers of the Suttan,' to whom they transfer him. They also inquire into the matter and discharge him, if he be innocent; but if guilty, they transfer him to the Aththakulaka, 'a Judicial institution composed of Judges from all the eight tribes.' They also having observed the same procedure transfer him to the S\u0113napati [translated by Turnour] 'the chief Minister'; he again to the Upar\u0101ja, 'Sub-King'; the Upar\u0101ja to the R\u0101ja. The King, inquiring into the matter, if he be innocent, releases him; but if he be guilty, he causes the Paweni-poththakan; 'book of precedents or usages,' to be propounded. There it is written,\u2014to him, by whom such a crime is committed, such a punishment is awarded. The R\u0101ja having measured the culprit's offence by that standard, pronounces a suitable sentence.\"\u2014Turnour's Buddhistical Annals of Ceylon.\nReferring to the difference generally between English and Sinhalese officers of Government, Mr. Stark says:\n\n\"The Government Agent is sometimes styled Dis\u0101va. But there can be no analogy among officers in systems of Government so very different as respects the distribution of official power and duty, as the English and Sinhalese; and it only tends to perpetuate misapprehension to use the names indiscriminately.\"\n\nIn the case of Dis\u0101va being applied to the \"Government Agent,\" no misapprehension results; and in my opinion, a better designation could hardly be conceived, as one with which the Sinhalese are altogether familiar, and one too, with which so much respect is associated in the native mind. A Dis\u0101va, or more properly Dis\u0101pati, under the Sinhalese Government, was a \"provincial chieftain,\" who had principally the management of a province: similarly, the Government Agent of the Ceylon Government at the present day is the chief revenue officer of a Province. The analogy between the two officers is apparent, and the propriety of the native designation, is therefore unquestionable. There are also several other European titles to which native terms are peculiarly applicable; as for instance \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba for \"Clerk;\" \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd for \"Lieutenant Governor;\" \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 for \"Treasurer;\" \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 for \"General\" or \"Chief of the Forces;\" \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 for \"Prince Consort;\" \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 for \"Ambassador;\" &c.\n\nNot so, however, as respects certain other offices which are ill-expressed by any titles of address known to the Sinhalese. Of this class are \"Auditor General,\" \"Post Master,\" \"Surveyor General,\" \"Secretary,\" &c. For the last, the Sinhalese in their graver compositions, unmixed with English phraseology, adopt the title of \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2; but it is apprehended, that it is not fully expressive of the English term. It is therefore, I believe, that in our Courts, the English word is adopted: in regard to which Mr. Stark says:\n\n\"The Secretary of the District Court subscribes himself Secretary Swamiha, which is derived from Swami or Swamiya, a lord or master. This appears singularly inappropriate, his proper appellation as Clerk of Court is certainly Unn\u00e2ne.\"\nHere is some misapprehension. The title of the Secretary in question is simply Sekrat\u00e1ris, (the s being an affix added in composition for the sake of euphony, as n in Dewiyan); and he does not conclude with any honorific, but with simply \u0daf\u0ddd\u0dc0\u0db8\u0dcf, which means \"we are,\" for \"I am.\" Thus it will be perceived, that the words used by the Secretary, viz. Sekrat\u00e1ris wamha, were mistaken by Mr. Stark for Secretary sw\u00e1miya. If however, the case be as stated by the learned writer, there is no doubt but that the appellation of \"lord\" or \"master\" is \"singularly inappropriate\" to a Secretary, as \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4 \u0d85\u0db0\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 is unquestionably so to the Government Agent\u2014who nevertheless uses this high honorific in all his correspondence with his native headmen.* A Mudaliy\u00e1r of the Gate, who was addressed in this style, returned the \u00f3la epistle to the Government Agent, and addressed him as follows on the 10th March 1839: \"I did not receive it (the letter) because it was written in a manner disgraceful to me: and I do not make the least doubt that if you are acquainted with Sinhalese, you would, on looking over the style or phraseology of that \u00f3la, be convinced of the impropriety of the same.\" See translation of the document in the Colombo Kachch\u00e9ri.\n\nWhilst on the subject of sw\u00e1mi, I may perhaps here notice another inaccuracy into which Mr. Stark has fallen, by rendering Maha-himiy\u00e1, 'the great proprietor'; and in supposing that the priest S\u00e9riyut was so called from his having been 'a great and distinguished author of his time.'\u2020 Himiy\u00e1 here means sw\u00e1miy\u00e1 'lord,' and not 'proprietor:' and proprietorship and authorship are not convertible terms: nor have they such a relation to each other as to render one term applicable to the other in a secondary sense.\n\n* The practice is reported to have existed for \"twenty-five years\" prior to the date of the letter referred to in the text. See L. De Livera, .ttapattu Mudaliy\u00e1r's report, March 14, 1839.\n\n\u2020 Probably Mr. Stark fell into this error by reading Armour's \"Kandyan Law,\" where himi (as in lat himi, 'domination by right of purchase') is used in a secondary sense to mean 'right of acquest,' 'pr. pr. prietorship.'\nH\u00e1mu-duruv\u00f3 (see \"Sidat-Sangar\u00e1wa,\" p. 160,) is derived from himi, which comes from sv\u00e1mi. It does not sustain, as stated by Mr. Stark the \"combined sense of master and instructor;\" for it is never used towards a lay instructor, although it is peculiarly the appellation of the last of the triad of Buddhism, the priesthood. Yet the priest does not obtain it in his capacity of \"master\" or \"instructor:\" it is given to him owing to his peculiar sanctity,* as 'one of the three gems of adoration and worship.' Following the practice of the Buddhists in this respect, the Singhalese Roman Catholics apply this term to their priests.\n\nThe designation of a \"teacher.\" is \u1e6du\u1e6di, from \u1e6du\u1e6di 'honour,' 'respect.' 'veneration'; and in that sense it is also applied to a parent,\u2020 It is used with the affix \u1e6du\u1e6di and \u1e6du\u1e6di, when greater honor is intended; yet it is a curious fact, that the same word \u1e6du\u1e6di when used with the affix \u1e6du\u1e6di, as \u1e6du\u1e6di \u1e6du\u1e6di conveys the idea of an instructor of mean or low extraction.\n\nBefore entering upon an investigation of the terms applied to the Buddhist priesthood, of which Mr. Stark has treated in different parts of his essay already referred to, I shall here remark that Mudali, from whence we derive Mudiyans\u00e9 or \"Mudaliy\u00e1r,\" is of Tamil origin, and means 'chief' or 'principal.' Amongst the Kandyans Mudiyans\u00e9 is not unfrequent as an agnomen; and they, like the Tamils of India, assume it without any authority from the Crown. The maritime natives, however, obtain it formally by an act or warrant from the Governor. In this respect the British Government follows the example of their predecessors, the Dutch and the Portuguese.\n\n* \"Of those who have no fixed habitation, the priests, the Pas\u00e9 Buddhas, and the supreme Buddhas, are the chief.\"\u2014Spence Hardy's Translations from Buddhist Scriptures.\"\n\n\u2020 \"The father who performs the ceremonies on conception and the like, according to aw, and who nourishes the child with his first rice, has the epithet of guru or 'venerable,'\"\u2014Institutes of Manu II, \u00a7 142.\nThe Mudaliy\u0101rs or Chiefs are of two classes, \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb or 'of the Royal Palace or Household,' (usually called \"the Gate,\" after the Portuguese who gave it the appellation of Porte, from a misapprehension of the Sinhalese word \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb, which also means 'door' or 'gate') and \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3 or 'Provincial Chiefs.' There were originally two other classes, which are known as \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb 'the Royal Equerry,' and \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3 or 'the Ecclesiastical chiefs.' To these may be added a fifth class\u2014\u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb or 'the District Chiefs.' Under each were placed different subordinate headmen, called Muhandirama, Viddana-Arachchi, Arachchi, Kang\u0101ni and Vid\u0101ne. The last is derived from the word \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb 'commanding,' or 'ordering' and means, as Clough defines it, \"the person who conveys the orders of Government to the people.\" Over all the headmen is placed a Maha Mudaliyar, the Maha Nilame of the Kandyans, or 'the greatest of the chief.' If any person, whether titled or untitled, can trace his descent to a Mudaliyar, he is said to be of the Mudali p\u0113ruwa, the correct interpretation of which is, 'of the class of Chiefs,' rather than \"the titled class,\" as rendered by Mr. Armour.\n\nBesides the ranks and titles which the natives obtain from the Crown, there is also a class to which particular individuals are entitled by reason of birth or position. Of these we may mention Gamar\u0101la,\u2020 equal to a \"County squire\" in England, but not held in the same estimation in Ceylon.\u2021 He is however of the highest caste (Vell\u0101la,) and one who in point of wealth has a competency for his subsistence. Appuha\u1e0dmi \"is the rank of a 'gentleman,' of the highest class of the\n\n---\n\n* For a tolerably correct description of the duties of the chiefs of the Maritime Province, see Colombo Journal, 1832, p. 262.\n\n\u2020 This title is rendered \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb, Gammudaliya, 'the chief of the village' in a Sinhalese version of the tale of the King Adahasmuka.\n\n\u2021 Mention is made of the election of Gamardlas under the provisions of the Paddy Lands Irrigation Ordinance; see Proclamation in the Government Gazette of the 24th July 1858.\nVell\u00e1l\u00e1s\u201d who anciently enjoyed certain privileges which are now denied to them; and Appu that of the plebeian, equal in its application to \u201cMister.\u201d As honorary terms of address by which persons of different castes are distinguished, I may mention Handuruv\u00e1, confined to \u201cVell\u00e1l\u00e1s\u201d; Na\u00edd\u00e9 to \u201cSmiths\u201d; H\u00e9nay\u00e1 to \u201cWashermen\u201d; Ridi to \u201cWasherwomen\u201d; M\u00e9stri to \u201cBarbers\u201d; Mahabudda to \u201cCh\u00e1liyas\u201d; Batgamay\u00e1 to \u201cPaduwas\u201d; N\u00e9kati zo \u201cTomtom-beaters\u201d; Wahumpuray\u00e1 to \u201cJaggerers,\u201d &c. &c. Whilst the above are mere honorary designations of different castes, there are others which are used as terms of affection and endearment to persons of low-castes; as for instance, H\u00e9na M\u00e1m\u00e1, \u201cUncle H\u00e9na\u201d to a Washerman; Ridi N\u00e9nd\u00e1, \u201cAunt Ridi\u201d to a Washerwoman, Va\u1e0dur\u00e1la, \u201cMaster Carpenter\u201d to a Carpenter; &c. &c.\n\nThere are also certain terms of respectful designation by which persons of different trades are distinguished, as for instance Ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u00e1dir\u00e1la, among Kar\u00e1was, \u2018for the man in charge of a part of a fishing net, called manda\u2019; Han\u1e6d\u00e9dir\u00e1la \u2018the owner of the fishing boat,\u2019 or \u2018the chief of the fishing band.\u2019 Formerly Moormen composed the class of people who were generally employed as Masters of trading vessels; and they received, in the sense of Tindal, the appellation of Marakkalay\u00f3, a term now applied to others who perform the same office, and also to the Head Moorman.\n\nWhilst the above are the ranks and titles of address of maritime native Sinhalese, those of Kandyans appear to be different, with some exceptions which are K\u00f3r\u00e1la, Mohott\u00e1la, Arachchila, L\u00e9kama, and Viddane; and, says Mr. Justice Stark in reference to them:\n\n\u201cThe above, namely, the Adigar, Dis\u00e1va, and Ra\u1e6d\u00e9mahatmay\u00e1, were the principal officers under the Sinhalese Government; and in the convention of 1815 entered into after the conquest of Kandy by the English, for the cessation of hostilities and the settlement of this country by a formal declaration of the power and principles of the new Government, they are mentioned or alluded to, as the principal chiefs of the Kandyan Provinces, and the Mohott\u00e1la, K\u00f3r\u00e1la, Vidd\u00e1na and others, the subordinate headmen from the Provinces.\u201d\nTo the above may be added Basn\u00e1yaka and the Diva Nilame (the word Nilame, *Officer* alone being sometimes used as a term of address to a titled person), which are amongst the titles of chiefs; and Atuk\u00f3r\u00e1la, Arachchila, Vid\u00e1na, amongst those of petty headmen. I have already alluded to Bund\u00e1, and the original acceptation of the term. I need only here refer to it, to shew that it is now assumed by every Kandyan of the Vell\u00e1la caste, in the same manner that the appellation of Appuh\u00e1mi is affixed to the name of every maritime Vell\u00e1la (and frequently of Kar\u00e1was) without distinction, and contrary to the original usage, by which only a gentleman was entitled to it.\n\nI cannot close my remarks on this part of the subject, without attracting attention to a mistake into which Mr. Stark has fallen, in common with a number of European writers, who consider the maritime natives to be distinct from the Kandyans, whom alone they regard as \"the Sinhalese, strictly so called.\" Mr. Stark remarks:\n\n\"The Kandyan or hill country is distinguished from the lower or maritime districts, by the same name, Sinhal\u00e9; and the town of Kandy is Maha nuwara the Megalo-polis or 'great city,' the Metropolis. These names are easily accounted for, but they are recorded as given.\"\n\nNow, the Kandyans, like all highlanders, are certainly distinguishable from the Maritime Natives. From the salubrious air which they inhale amidst their upland hills, the Kandyans are braver and more hardy than the people of other provinces. The independence which they enjoyed until comparatively a short time ago, has tended also to elevate their general bearing over that of the people of the Southern and Western Provinces. They have preserved too, their religion and language without suffering much from the various colonial influences to which the low-landers have been subjected for three and a half centuries. The latter, by the change of their religion, occupations,\n\n---\n\n* This, when affixed to Maha, is used to signify an Adigar, or the Maha Mudaliyar.\nand habits, may have slightly lost the distinct peculiarities which originally characterized the entire Sinhalese nation; yet the differences in these respects no more render necessary a distinction in their nationality, than do the accidents of birthplace, or other circumstances, which enable us to distinguish an Englishman of Northumberland from another of Middlesex or Yorkshire, or a native of Galle from one born in Colombo. The difference, however, which has been drawn by Mr. Justice Stark, has arisen from a misapprehension of a single circumstance. It is this. When a part of Ceylon fell into the hands of the Portuguese, and the Sinhalese Court was removed from Kott\u00e9 to Kandy, that part of the Sinhala-dwipa which was retained by the Sinhalese, was called Sinhal\u00e9 (the appellation by which the Kandyan Provinces are known to this day,) as contradistinguished from the territory of the Portuguese. The distinction therefore, was one of territory, not of nationality. It was employed to determine the jurisdiction of the Sinhalese Government from the possessions of the Portuguese. As the Kandyan Provinces alone (which were retained by the Sinhalese) became thus universally known as Sinhal\u00e9, a misapprehension of its cause and origin led Europeans to distinguish the Maritime Sinhalese from their Kandyan neighbours, both of whom are descended from the same stock, speak the same language, are subject to the same habits, and are possessed of nearly the same feelings. Hence the distinction to which reference is made.\n\nThere is however one distinction, in respect to their names, which I may notice here. The low country Sinhalese have more names than their Kandyan countrymen. Whilst the g\u00e9-nama or 'family name,' the bat-kavana-nama, 'the household term of endearment'\u2014usually given on the occasion of giving food to a child for the first time, which is celebrated by a festival,\u2014and the patabendi-nama, or 'the name which is assumed on obtaining office,' are the same in both countries: yet the names which distinguish the Kandyan from the Maritime\nSinhalese are the \"Christian names\" and \"Surnames\" of the latter. The \"Surnames\" are those which they have borrowed from the Portuguese, such as D'Saram, D'Alwis, Silva, Perera, Dias, D'Saw, &c. &c., and the example having been first set by the highest families of the land, the lower classes have considered it a privilege to be allowed to assume the like names. As to the \"Christian names,\" they are generally assumed by all classes, both Buddhists and Christians, upon the ceremony of baptism, of which Sir James Emerson Tennent thus writes, in his work on \"Christianity in Ceylon.\"\n\n\"It had been declared honourable by the Portuguese to undergo such a ceremony; it had been rendered profitable by the Dutch; and after 300 years' familiarity with the process, the natives were unable to divest themselves of the belief that submission to the ceremony was enjoined by orders from the Civil Government,\"\u2014p. 48.\n\nSo they believed at first. But baptism soon became an indispensable rite in regard to their civil rights. One of the consequences of this ceremony was, that the name of the party baptized was registered in the Thombo: and the registration was of the most paramount importance to the litigious Sinhalese. In all matters regarding their inheritance, in all their contentions on the ground of illegitimacy, and on various other questions that frequently come before the Courts, registration, and registration alone, is the best evidence of what they seek to establish, or disprove. From the fearful amount of perjury that is to be found in the Courts, they fear that without this documentary proof they will fail to establish their rights: and it is therefore (to use the language of Sir Emerson Tennent in the subsequent part of the passage that I have just above quoted) that, \"when a parent upbraids his child in anger, he sometimes threatens to disinherit him, by saying, he will 'blot out his baptism from the thombo.'\" So scrupulous however, are they in respect of this registration, that actions have\n\n* In accordance with this practice amongst the Sinhalese, the Tamils of Vadukkoddai have assumed, upon baptism, such names as Carpenter Rowe, Morgan, Covington, &c., &c.\noften been brought to compel the registration of particular patronymics, and to cancel others to which parties were not entitled.\n\nThus it will be perceived, that the Sinhalese resort to baptism, neither as a religious duty, nor as a ceremony which conferred, as supposed by Sir Emerson Tennent, \"some civil distinction;\" but simply as an operation which alone secured the registration, which they prized so very high.\n\nThis leads me to notice a misapprehension under which Sir Emerson labours, when he thinks that \"to the present day the Sinhalese term for the ceremony [kula-waddanaw\u0101] bears the literal interpretation of 'admission to rank.'\" Not so. Owing to a notion amongst the maritime Sinhalese, that if they adopt in their families a stranger or an illegitimate child, after baptizing him \"in their own name\"\u2014which follows a registration of the baptism in the Thombo\u2014he would, in the event of their death be entitled to inherit the property of \"the adoptive parent's estate.\" * Kula-waddanaw\u0101 was originally used amongst the Sinhalese; but its application at present to the baptism of legitimate children, as well as natural offspring, and children by adoption, is to be regarded merely as a species of catcheresis in the language. Kula-waddanaw\u0101, again, is not \"admission into rank;\" but \"admission into family\"\u2014a recognition of one's civil rights. Thus, the Kula devat\u0101v\u0101 in the Hindu plays\u2020 is the household deity, the \"object of hereditary and family worship,\" the domestic god of the Br\u0101hm\u012bns. In the Selalihinisund\u0113sa, the poet directs his winged messenger \"cheerfully to remember his household god.\"\n\n* This is a notion still entertained by many native Sinhalese, although the Dutch law, to which they are now subject, had completely upset the right which the child of adoption acquired by the Sinhalese law.\u2014See Sawyer's Notes on Kandyan Law, p. 25.\n\n\u2020 Vol. I. p. 21.\nI presume the notion regarding the \"distinction,\" which it is thought baptism conferred on the native, is without foundation; and Sir Emerson is equally misinformed, when he states, that T\u00f3 Jintigu\u00fav\u00e1, which he interprets to mean \"unbaptized wretch\" is applied by Buddhist to Buddhist as a \"term of reproach.\" Jintigu is a Portuguese word used in the sense of \"gentile,\" or \"pagan\" and is only applied by Christians to their Buddhist brethren by way of reproach; as many of the slander cases before the District Court of Colombo, amply testify. It has no connection whatever with baptism; and I may safely affirm, that no native uses it to a co-religionist, much less by a Buddhist to one of the same creed.\n\nI shall now proceed to an investigation of religious titles or \"terms of address\" to Buddhist priests. On this subject, the following passage occurs in the essay already so frequently referred to:\n\n\"A generic name for a Buddhist priest is said by Bridgnell to be Ganinnanse (Ganinnanse) probably from some root signifying learning or wisdom, whence we have Gan\u00e9a the Hindu God of Wisdom, gana a poetical measure, and ganitaya the science of Arithmetic. But Clough derives the word differently, and thinks it is an inferior term applicable to the lowest order of priests.\"\n\nIn my opinion, both Bridgnell and Clough have failed to give the correct application of the word Ganinnanse. In the first place, it is not a generic term for a 'Buddhist priest'; although people of different creeds (other than Buddhists) vulgarly employ it, as well as the simple Unnans\u00e9 to signify 'priest'. Sometimes also gana is used without the nans\u00e9 in a contemptuous sense, as tantamount to 'look at that ganay\u00e1!' In the next place, it is not \"an inferior term applicable to the lowest order of priests.\" It is properly the designation of the principal or the chief of a semi-association; \"the nans\u00e9 lord of a gana class;\"* or, in the language\n\n*A Gana, according to the ceremonial doctrines of Buddhism, is a class or semi-association of not less than two nor more than four priests; and Sangha is an association of any number of priests above four. Thus, the following passage in the Milindapra\u015bna, referring to the six Arahatwas or Tirthakas, may be interpreted: \"Their Lordships, the six aforenamed, are hierarchs over [sangha] associations, and [gana] semi-associations.\"\nof Milindu in the *Milindappra\u015bna*; the \"head of a sect having fraternities of his own.\" Hence it is clear, that the word is not derived \"from some root signifying learning or wisdom.\" Nor is it from any such imaginary source that we get *Ga\u1e47e\u1e63a* the Hindu God of wisdom, *ga\u1e47aya* a poetical measure, and *ga\u1e47itaya* the science of Arithmetic. *Ga\u1e47e\u1e63a* and *ga\u1e47a* like *ga\u1e47inn\u0101s\u012b*, are both derived from the same root *ga\u1e47a* or 'class': the *ya* in *ga\u1e47aya* being merely an affix for the sake of euphony and *\u0113\u1e63a* in *Ga\u1e47e\u1e63a* being an abbreviation of the word *\u012aswara*, 'chief,' whence as 'the chief of a class' it is applied to the Hindu God of wisdom. But *ga\u1e47itaya* is derived from *ga\u1e47a* 'to count.'\n\nThe principal terms, however, for a Buddhist Priest are four; 1, *\u015ar\u0101vaka* from *\u015bru* 'to hear.' 2. *\u015arama\u1e47a* (Sans.), *Sama\u1e47a* (P\u0101li), *Mah\u0101\u1e47a* (Sinhalese), signifying the performance of ascetism; whence it is probable that the epithet *Samanean*, as applied in the religious system of Tartary, is derived. Sir Emerson Tennent, in his work on \"Christianity,\" has the following note in reference to the use made of this term by other nations.\n\n\"It is remarkable that this name [S\u0101ma\u1e47ero] which to the present day is preserved as the designation of the Buddhist priesthood in Siam and Ceylon, should be the same by which the *Samaneans* or Buddhists of Bahar are described by Megasthenes, who, B.C. 300, was an ambassador from Seleucus to their king; and whose lost work on the state of India at that period is quoted by Strabo and Pliny. The same designation for the priesthood, *Samana*, is applied equally by Clemens Alexandrinus in the second century, and by Porphyry in the fourth.\"\u2014p. 216.\n\nReferring to the same use of this word, the Rev. Spence Hardy extracts the following passage from \"Relation des Royaumes Bouddhiques,\" p. 60, quoted from *San tsang f\u00e0 sou*, liv. xxii. p. 9.\n\n\"When the four rivers fall into the sea they no longer retain the name of river: when men of the four castes become Samaneans, they receive the common name of sons of S\u0101kya (synonymous with bhikhou.)\u2014Eastern Monachism, p. 11.\n\nThe word *Sama\u1e47a* becomes *Hama\u1e47a* by the well-known transformation of *s* and *h*; and the last, by a process of meta-\nthesis, assumes the form of Mah\u0101na.* See \"Sidat-Sangar\u0101wa,\" p. 7. From Mah\u0101na we obtain the word Mah\u0101na-unna\u1e47s\u0113 or Mah\u0101n-unna\u1e47s\u0113, which means \"reverend ascetic\"; but not \"the great one,\" as incorrectly interpreted by Mr. Hardy, probably by confounding it with Mah\u0101-unna\u1e47s\u0113 which is not the \"collective name\" of the priests, but a designation by which the chief of a Monastery is distinguished from amongst several who happen to form an association, or to be the subject of conversation or writing.\n\nFrom the P\u0101li word Samana and tra which in composition becomes nira, we obtain S\u0101manera;\u2020 and it means a \"young ascetic,\" \"a novice\" or \"pupil of a priest.\" The words which bear the same meaning, and are applied to S\u0101manero or priests who have not received the Upasampad\u0101 ordination, are Yatiput and Herana. Many honorifics, which are used towards Upasampad\u0101 priests are inapplicable to S\u0101manero. Thus we find in the Sinhalese version of the Milindapra\u015bna, and in one and the same sentence, that a S\u0101manera is spoken of as \"S\u0101mantrayan wahand\u0113\" and a Thera as \"Bikshun wahans\u0113\" and where a priest applied \"Saminda\" to his own teacher, a venerable S\u0101manero of upwards of 60 years of age, the propriety of the designation was questioned in the following lines published in the Yatalaba-Sangara, p. 37.\n\n3. Sthavira (Sans.), Thera (Pali), or Tera (Sinhalese,) means \"Elder.\" It is synonymous with yati; and both\n\n* The proper designations of a priest are Pabbaja, one separated from secular life, and Bhikkhu, a mendicant. The common Sinhalese term is Mah\u0101na, which is represented as being only a different pronunciation of Samana; one devoted to religious meditations for the purifying of his own heart.\u2014The Rev. D. J. Gogerly's Essays in Ribeiro's (Lee) 'cylon, p. 272.\n\n\u2020 See Clough's B\u0101l\u0101vat\u0101ra, p. 89.\n\n\u2021 Of the S\u0101maner\u014d the ordained elder priests sometimes use the pronouns \u0113t\u0113 and \u0113t\u0113.\nare equally applied to a priest after he has been an Upasampad\u00e1 priest of 10 years' standing. Before, however, he completes his tenth year after ordination, his career is divided into two periods\u2014the first from the date of ordination till his fifth year, and the second from that time until he becomes a Th\u00e9ra or \"elder.\" During each of the above periods he obtains the designation of Nawaka and Maggima respectively. 4. Bhikshu (San.), Bhikkhu (Pali), Bik (Sinhalese) literally 'beggar' or 'mendicant,' is derived from Bhikshu 'to beg.'\n\nIn a collective sense Sanga is used, and means the whole order collectively\u2014'the priesthood,' 'an assembly or an association of Buddhist priests.' The honorific Dhamma is usually applied to Sangay\u00e0, Bhikshu, and Th\u00e9ra; and to Gana.\n\nThere is a peculiar etiquette in the use of terms of address amongst the priesthood; which seems to have been regulated by Buddha himself, in the sixth Bhanaw\u00e0ra of the Parinibb\u00e1na Sutta, where the following passage occurs:\n\n\"Ananda, although priests are now in the habit of (indiscriminately) addressing each other with the term \u00e1wuso; yet after my death this practice should not be continued. Ananda, by a senior th\u00e9ra, a junior (priest) should be addressed either by his personal name, or by his family designation, or by the appellation of \u00e1wuso; and by a junior (priest) a senior th\u00e9ra should be addressed bhante 'lord,' or \u00e1yasmd 'advanced in years.'\n\n'\u00c1wuso' is evetni in Sinhalese; bhante is vahans\u00e9; and \u00e1yasmd, (which means 'thou who art advanced in years' and approximates in sense to the English epithet 'venerable,') is \u00e1yubban. This last is a term of address very common amongst the Sinhalese, and is frequently employed in addressing persons of rank and age, both priests and laymen. \u00c1yubban is also the form of salutation amongst\nus, and in the sense of wishing one 'Good morning' in English, the Sinhalese greet one another\u2014Ayubowan 'Long life.' This is a salutation which has no distinction as to rank, caste, or class. It is used by all indiscriminately, by the highest to the lowest, et vice versa.\n\nIt is not a little curious to observe that divus\u00f3 (which is simply a vocative)* has the signification of the English term, 'I say:' this is however in accidental similarity; and the words are no more derived from the same source, than gargar\u0101yana r\u016bla, \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (in Milindappra\u015bna) from \"gurgling rill;\" or koka k\u014dk \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2 from cocra \u1f10\u03b4\u03b1\u03be. Speaking of the resemblance in the sounds of words in different languages, I may here observe that although the word ebittayd \"the attendant of the priest,\" bears a great resemblance to the obitikos of the Greeks, \"a bit boy\" or a 'stripling,' as stated by Mr. Stark; yet that the word itself is derived from abhi 'before,' 'front,' or 'opposite,' and yukta 'who or which is;' whence it means \"a person who is ever before you;\" a \"page.\" I may also here intimate my belief that the Hebrew term Tirshatha, applied as a title to the Governor of Judea under the Persians, and mentioned in Ezra ii. 63; Neh. vii. 65; viii. 9; has no connection with \u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0915 Tirthaka, as hinted by Mr. Stark. The former is believed by some to have been derived from the Persian word signifying 'harsh,' and by others from a different word meaning 'fear'; and thence applied to a Ruler or Governor as \"the dreaded one.\" But the latter term Tirthaka is from tirtha 'to ferry over;' thence applied to a \"Religious teacher,\"\u2020 from his being a person who helps mankind to ford the troublous waters of life. In Ceylon Buddhistical works, it is used to signify \"a teacher of a sect different from Buddhism,\" or a \"sectarian,\" an \"unbeliever;\" or as Mr. Turnour has rendered it in his Buddhistical Annals, \"one of the antagonist creed.\"\n\n* See Glough's B\u0101l\u0101vata\u1e6d\u1e6da, p. 70.\n\u2020 Bombay Asiatic Society's Journal, July 1857, p. 401. et seq.\nTo return however to the subject. In accordance with the injunction of Buddha contained in the passage which I have extracted from the Buddhawansa, the Sama\u00f1\u00e9ro address the Upasampad\u00e1 priests H\u00e1mu\u0111uruv\u00f3, Terunn\u00e1ns\u00e9, Terunvahan\u015b\u00e9, Ayub\u00f3van; whilst the latter use towards the former T\u00e9na, B\u00e1nav\u00e1, Punchi-unnech\u00e9, Tamus\u00e9, Und\u00e9. As amongst the priests themselves of each class, there are different appellations. For, (to use the language of Turnour) \"as in the order of ordination one Bhikkhu must be senior to another, an appellation implying equality applied by a junior to a senior Upasampad\u00e1 is disrepectful and irreverent.\"\n\nI shall here notice a peculiarity arising from sectarian animosity, viz., that the priests of the Siam and Amarapura sects do not, when they meet, salute each other. Amongst other peculiarities which distinguish the one from the other, I may also here mention the fact, that the Amarapura sect differs from the Siamese by having both the shoulders covered with a roll of robe. I will not express an opinion as to the correctness or incorrectness of the innovation: but judging from the conduct of the fathers of the Buddhist faith, the adjustment of the robe, so as to leave one shoulder bare (as is the wont of the Siamese sect) seems to be proper, at least in appearing in an assembly. The reader will find frequent mention of this in Buddhistical writers. I shall content myself with three extracts from Turnour's P\u00e1li Buddhistical Annals, in the sixth volume of the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal.\n\n\"The Thero \u00c1nando who had attained the arahathood, also repaired to the meeting. 'How did he go'? Saying to himself with the greatest delight, adjusting his robes, so as to leave one shoulder bare,\" p. 517. \"Having thus imposed on himself that office, the venerable Up\u00e1li rising, adjusting his robe so as to leave one shoulder bare, and taking up the ivory-wrought fan, and bowing down to the senior priests took his seat on the dhamm\u00e1sanan (pulpit),\" p. 519. \"The venerable\n\n* Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, vol. vii. p. 1007.\nAnando then rising from his seat, and adjusting his robes, so as to leave one shoulder bare, and bowing down to the senior Bhikkhu, took his place in the Dhammasan\u0101na, holding up the ivory-wrought fan.\u201d p. 521.\n\nThis is an ascetic rite, probably borrowed from the Institutes of Manu, where it is laid down, (Cap. II., \u00a7 193). \u201cLet him always keep his right arm uncovered,\u2014be always decently apparelled, and properly composed,\u201d &c. Again in Cap. IV., \u00a7 58, \u201cIn a temple of consecrated fire, in the pasture of kine, in the presence of Brahmins, in reciting the Veda, and in eating his food, let him hold out his right arm uncovered.\u201d\n\nReference is made by Mr. Justice Stark to Up\u0101li, one of the priests named in the above extract, and a doubt is expressed as to whether he was identical with Up\u0101li Maha Situ, the nobleman whose conversation with Buddha is noticed in a passage from the Am\u0101vatura, extracted into my \u201cSidat Saygar\u0101wa,\u201d p. clvii. They were however different persons. The priest Up\u0101li was a barber; but the nobleman of the same name was the follower of a Tirthaka, an heretic. A brief history of the former is given by the Rev. Spence Hardy in his work on Buddhism, (p.p. 231-2); and the same writer gives the history of Up\u0101li, the laic or \u201chouseholder.\u201d (ib. p. 266).\n\nHaving noticed the want of identity between the two Up\u0101lis, I shall proceed to consider what Mr. Stark calls \u201cthe distinguishing terms characteristic of the priest and layman.\u201d In one sense, the words gih\u012b and bhikku have the same distinction which laicus and clerus have; but, generally, they serve to indicate no other difference save that between the householder and the houseless wanderer, which latter a priest undoubtedly is, by the rigid vows of his order. From the Sanskrit word \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0939, griha we obtain the term grihapati, \u2018lord of the house,\u2019 \u2018landlord,\u2019 beautifully expressive of the English word \u2018host,\u2019 as contra-distinguished from amutt\u0101 \u2018guest\u2019 or \u2018stranger.\u2019\nAs applied to the laic only, there are to be found several honorific terms of address in books; as for instance \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca, \"O youths,\" \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db8, \"O prosperous,\" &c. So also as applied generally to the ascetic, we have \u0d85\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db0\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd3, a word adopted from the P\u0101li, which frequently occurs in the Milindappraha in the sense of 'Hail! Your Worship!'\n\nThe names assumed by the Buddhist priests are different from those taken by the laity; e.g., Sangha Rakkhita; Dhamma Ratana; Samanatissa; Dhamm\u00e1nanda; Atthadassi; Sumanas\u00e1ra; Sumana; Gunaratana; Jin\u00e1nanda; Dhamm\u00e1nanda; Dhamm\u00e1r\u00e1ma; Dhammatilaka; Siri-Sumana; Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1s\u00e1ra; Dhammakkhanda; S\u00f3bhita; Suguna; Ratanap\u00e1la; &c., &c. Some of them are coined, whilst others, like Siddhattha and R\u00e1hula, are those which are found in books. The following passage extracted from the Buddhawansha, shews the origin of the word R\u00e1hula, which does not signify \"eclipsed,\" as hinted by Mr. Stark.\n\nThat is:\u2014\n\n\"At this time, Suddh\u00f3dana heard that (Yas\u00f3dara) the mother of R\u00e1hula, had given birth to a son; and, desirous of gladdening his son, sent him a message (to announce the event). The B\u00f3disat, on receiving the announcement, exclaimed, 'A R\u00e1hula is born!' A tie has been created! When the king, having inquired what his son had said, was informed of (tan wachanan) that word (i.e. R\u00e1hula, the chief word of his son's exclamation,) Suddh\u00f3dana said 'Let then R\u00e1hula (prince) itself be the name of my grandson from henceforth.'\"\n\nThe names which are used by the laic as terms of address towards the elders of the Buddhist church, are generally those given to their native countries; as for instance Miripen\u00e9, Karangoda, Bentota, Ambagahapi\u1e6diya, &c., &c. The titles which\nwere anciently given by the Crown to a chief hierarch of the Buddhist church was Sanga R\u0101ja. (See an instance of this in the extracts in my \"Sidat-Sangar\u0101wa,\" p. ccxxvii.) But, when the Sinhalese Government had ceased to exist, the dignitaries of their church were designated N\u0101yuka and Anu-n\u0101yaka (\"the chief\" and the \"next chief\") with the honorific affix of Terunn\u00e1nse or Unn\u00e1nse.\n\nTreating of the word \u0101c\u0101ra, says Mr. Stark:\n\nThe word is not used however to any other than such priests (a Th\u0113ra). It is not given to Kapuw\u0101 or god's priest; nor to the Yakadur\u0101, or devil's priest; nor to the Balik\u0101ray\u0101, or planet priest.\"\n\nHe is quite right. No respect whatever was originally shewn to the priests of a worship which had not the sanction of Buddhism. Thus a \"devil's priest\" was called Yakkha-d\u0101sa (P\u0101li), or Yakdess\u0101 (Sinhalese), \"the devil's slave.\" But, as corruptions crept into the religious worship of the Island, from the invasions of Ceylon by the Malabars,* and Yakka worship was gradually introduced by them, 'the slave of the devil' became Yakadur\u0101, or 'the teacher of demonology': and the simple Kapuw\u0101\u2020 'god's priest,' was designated 'Kapur\u0101la.' Even here the reader will observe that the honorifics used are such as do not convey much respect towards the professors of the new faith.\n\nThe aversion which the Sinhalese anciently felt to demonology, and, consequently the contempt with which they regarded the professors of that faith, viz., the \u0100ndi Fakirs, who were at one time the pest of Ceylon, may be easily gathered from the \u0100ndi m\u0101la, a book written with the pro-\n\n* See Mr. Silva's Essay in Lee's Ribeiro, p. 274, et seq.\n\u2020 This word is derived from \u1e6d\u1e6d\u1e6da kepa 'to set apart,' 'dedicate'\u2014it being usual, when a vow is made to the gods, that as an earnest of one's obligation, or the assurance of the fulfilment of one's vows, to plant a pillar, as it were the foundation stone of the buildings to be thereafter erected for the ceremony. Whence this pillar is called \u1e6d\u1e6d\u1e6da kap, and the priest who plants it is thence designated \u1e6d\u1e6d\u1e6da Kapuw\u0101.\nfessed object of alienating the affections of the misguided natives, who had evinced an attachment to a Pretender to the Siphalese throne; and of denouncing the faith which he professed. The writer in reference to the Pretender says that 'it would be far profitable to give to a dog that which is in vain spent for Wilbawa, the devil's slave' &c.:\u2014\n\nAnd after an immense deal of reproachful language in respect of the religion which his hero professed, the writer thus expresses himself as to the different merits of the worship of Buddhas, gods, men, and devils.\n\n\"Those who worshipped Buddha and reached the city of Niwan, have never fallen into Hell: those who worshipped and offered unto gods have never failed their reward: those who served man (kings of this world) have had their reward both good and evil: but those who offered unto devils, were ever lost both in this as in the next world; and was never benefited.\"\n\nAnother class of terms of address to which reference is made are \"household words\"; and Mr. Stark thinks that they are \"generally of a common character, and not words of affection or endearment.\"\n\nNot so. The terms of endearment amongst the Siphalese are nearly as many as those of honor and rank. Take for instance the epithets for \"woman,\" neglected and degraded woman. She is sondurn or vami, expressive of what Milton describes her to be, the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\"fairest of creation * * and best.\"\n\nShe is vati 'wealth,' or 'life of man,' tantamount to the\nexpression \"the better half,\" as when Milton describes her to be,\n\n\"Part of my soul, I seek thee, and thee claim\nMy other half,\"\u2014\n\nOther terms, like those which Mrs. Malaprop thinks, 'profane expressions of endearment,' are not wanting amongst us; but with them, we have no concern here. I may therefore pass on to different other terms by which woman is designated. She is pam\u00e1 'the tempter;' sanda 'moon-like beauty;' piya or kama 'the darling;' vilasi or kata 'the very delight of man.' I am free to admit that the Sinhalese, like other nations, have not failed to notice the frailty, the weakness, and the timidity of woman; and to coin words expressive of such qualities. The word biri, (given by Mr. Stark, being the classic form of the same word,) indicates the timidity of her mind, as tunu-anga expresses the weakness of her frame; and liya, 'winding shrub,' signifies her dependence on man, like\n\n\"the woodbine, the sweet honey suckle,\nGently entwist, the female ivy so,\nEnrings the barky fingers of the elm.\"\n\nIf in this respect the Sinhalese may be accused of want of gallantry, it is, I apprehend, a charge to which they subject themselves in common with the best and most enlightened nations of the West. The reader will find a precedent in the line where Ovid makes Hero write to Leander, thus:\u2014\n\nUt corpus teneris ita mens infirma puellis.\n\nIn a country where the natives closely imitate the manners of the dominant race, one may naturally be inclined to expect that English epithets of endearment are generally used by the Sinhalese. In my varied intercourse with my countrymen, I have, however, not known more than one instance of the kind, and that confined to a dashing young fellow who had been the domestic servant in an English family. It is possible, nevertheless, that there are other instances of natives using English household terms of endearment; but I may venture\nto assert that the practice is not general, and that it is not likely to be so hereafter. In the instance* referred to by me above, the words used were \"my dear.\" A person who proved the fact gave it as \"dio\"; and between the ignorance of the witness, and the dulness of the Interpreter, a new word appeared; and the Judge took it down \"bui\"\u2014a fact which moreover shows that the natives are not familiar with such terms.\n\nI have considered the titles of address given to males. It may be convenient here to enter into an investigation of those usually applied to the female sex.\n\nA Lady of distinction, such as the wife of a Mudaliy\u00e1r, is \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3 or \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3; she is sometimes addressed by equals \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3, \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dd2; or \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dd2. A lady who is a grade inferior to the last receives the title of \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3. It is however the usual address of the wife of a Muhandiram or Appuhami, and of the unmarried daughter of a Mudaliy\u00e1r. \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dd2 is the title of an \u00c1rachchi's wife, whilst \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3 is that of the wife of Kangany, Vid\u00e1na or Gamar\u00e1la; \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3 is the honorary designation of a respectable Vell\u00e1la female of the lower classes. It is sometimes assumed by males of the same standing in society as the females last mentioned, especially in the Southern Province; but it may be observed that it is a term more appropriate to a female.\n\nIn the Kandyan Provinces \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3 is the highest title of a lady of distinction, second only to a \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3 or Royal Princess. \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3, \"Her Highness\" is the feminine form of \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd3, which Mr. Stark says on the authority of Clough, is equivalent to \"Mr.\" The former may therefore be regarded as equal to \"Mrs.\" and is only applied to a gentlewoman; whilst\n\n---\n\n* No. 85,800. District Court of Colombo, South, before Judge Langslow, for compelling Defendant to marry Plaintiff\u2014a witness stated: \"the defendant addressed the plaintiff 'Ado H\u00e1mi,' she him 'Pillai;' and when she called him so, he called her 'bui' (Dear). I believe them to be very endearing terms.\"\u2014See Judge Langslow's notes of the evidence.\nis decidedly the designation of the plebeian female. which means, literally, \"gem,\" is the term for \"gentle lass,\" although it is frequently used towards those who have attained a good old age. This last term which had once fallen into disuse, is again current throughout the low country, and it is applied in the same manner in which it was originally done, by being applied to the ladies amongst the Sinhalese.\n\nThe above are the honorary titles of the Vell\u016bla caste, all other castes being entitled to different other designations, such as and , the wife and daughter respectively of a 'smith'; 'washer woman,' &c. &c.\n\nMy limits forbid my entering more deeply into the subject than I have done. I shall therefore proceed to notice a few other matters of interest, to which Mr. Justice Stark alludes in the essay to which I have so frequently referred. Of these, the terms by which Kandyans designate their children as to size demand attention here. Mr. Stark notices only two, loku and tikiri, whilst there are no less than five words which convey the respective ages of children or persons in a family. Thus, loku is the 'eldest' of a family; medduma or 'middle' is the next in gradation or age; kuddi indicates 'small;' tikiri 'smaller' still; and punchi the 'smallest' of all. In the maritime country, however, tikiri is not used; and ebittaya, a term peculiar to the low country, is a 'bit-boy,' as applied to baba or 'baby,' smaller than puncha or 'little one.'\n\nThe P\u0101li or Tamil word aiya, probably derived from the Sanskrit \u0101rya* \"the respectable,\" is found in the Sinhalese; and is used by us to signify 'elder brother'; and akka, which is a Sanskrit word for \"mother,\" is adopted in the Sinhalese to designate 'elder sister.' The use of these terms denote the great respect with which the elder members of a family are treated amongst the Sinhalese; and it is well known that elder brothers and sisters amongst us are never mentioned or called by their proper names. When the terms aiya and akka\n\n* See Pr. Wilson's Hindu Drama, vol. I., p. 118, note.\nassume a more endearing form, they are expressed *aiyandi* and *akkandi*; and the same termination (*andi*) is employed when speaking of a mother respectfully, as *ammandi*. The termination, in a similar application of the words *app\u00e1*, 'father,' and *bala-app\u00e1* or *bappa* 'uncle' is *chchi*, as *appochchi*, *bappochchi*.\n\nAs the above are nominal terms of address peculiar in their use and application, so there are also nominal terminations and verbal affixes in the Sinhalese, to which I shall allude here. Of nominal terminations, I may mention a peculiarity which is not generally understood. It is in reference to the use of names without honorific affixes. When persons address each other without honorifics, they change the terminations of the name from one vowel sound to another. They do so with a view of conveying respect. Thus for instance *podda*, 'little one' is changed into *podde*; *Justin\u00e1* to *Justin\u00e9*; *Cornis* to *Cornist* &c. Though the latter is the vocative form of the noun, yet that form is adopted in the other cases also, with a view to honor the person spoken of. Where, however, no respect is intended, the proper termination of the name is alone retained.\n\nThere are several verbal affixes. Of them, *aika* denotes the highest respect, as in the passage *aika*... So does *aika menawa*, as in the Lord's Prayer, 'Give us this day our daily bread.'\n\nSpeaking of verbal affixes in the imperative mood, to convey various degrees of respect to the person addressed, I shall here exhibit a few of the changes which one solitary word undergoes, when applied to different persons.

So likewise \u0d9a\u0dd9\u0da7\u0dda\u0dc0\u0dda 'eat' is applied to priests \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da7 to nobles, \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda to inferiors; and the last, with different modifications, such as \u0d9a\u0dc6\u0dad\u0dcf, \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dbd\u0dda, \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dbd\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dbd\u0dda, \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda, \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda, \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda, to equals and inferiors.\"\n\nSo various are the modes of address, adopted by the Sinhalese towards particular individuals, that the simple \u0d9a\u0dd9 'yes,' used in familiar intercourse, is changed into \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda, when the nobility are addressed; and into \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dd3\u0da7, when the priesthood. The simple \u0d9a\u0dd4 'no' becomes \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda, under similar circumstances; and \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda 'good' is changed to \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda and \u0d9a\u0da7\u0db8\u0dda.\n\nHaving thus considered the principal matters to which Mr. Stark has attracted attention, I shall in the next place notice the \"modes of reverence\" referred to in the following paragraph.\n\n\"There are several modes of reverence or obeisance among the Sinhalese:\u2014The shoes also off: placing the right hand on the breast, and bowing; joining the hands, raising them thus to the forehead, and bowing; falling on the knees, and so doing; and prostration on the face upon the ground.\"\nNo native of the lower orders ever thinks of entering a *walaawwa* or \"mansion\" of a nobleman, without first leaving his slippers at the gate. This is an ancient custom in the East, which was enforced by Europeans for a very long time. Bennet, in his work on Ceylon, (p. 100,) notices a decision of Government* respecting the assumption by natives of shoes and stockings, which they did to avoid being obliged to leave their slippers at the gates of gentlemen whom they visited; and we know of instances in Colombo, where natives of the highest families were refused admission into European houses, because they departed from the ancient custom of leaving their slippers at the door. But, happily, the times are changed! We perceive a great social change in the conduct of Europeans towards natives. From the adoption of English customs we augur happy results, amongst which (although the remark may excite a smile in certain quarters) I may almost predict, the abolition of caste-distinctions and class-prejudices. To proceed:\u2014However stringent was the original custom in regard to going barefooted in the presence of the nobility, there\n\n---\n\n* \"Mr. John Brixius De Silva, the present assessor of the District Court of Galle, ..........who wore shoes and stockings in Court with my unqualified approbation, was refused admission into the Kachcheri with such European appendages. That gentleman felt that, as a British subject, he had as great a right to wear shoes and stockings as those who were of European birth; but as the Collector chose to make a reference to the Governor, which was followed by the most extraordinary decision, that 'His Excellency would not sanction the adoption of the most comfortable portions of the European and Native costumes; and that the Interpreter must choose one or the other;' Mr. De Silva relinquished his visits to the Kachcheri, rather than the comforts of his adopted dress. A writer in the Calcutta Review, December 1849, p. 381, defends the policy of a similar decision in India; but the reader will perceive how different are the costumes of the turban-clad Hindu, and the comb-wearing Sinhalese, and therefore how very inapplicable are the writer's remarks to Ceylon, even if they can be justified upon other grounds: 'How much exitability, for instance, has been shewn (says the writer) in respect to what has been called 'the shoe question.' Taking off the shoe or slipper, was no custom introduced by the English. It was, and has been, the established custom of India for ages. If the natives of India claim a conformity to our customs, let them have it by all means on equal terms. Let them have their purgris or turbans in the ante-chamber. A native of whatever degree is perfectly well aware that he cannot call upon a native of high rank, without submitting to his country's etiquette; and he will conform to it without a demur, though he grudges to do so to an European of equal rank. The Bengalis are the only natives (and only a small section of them) who object to it. Why they do so object we never could comprehend. The Greeks, a far more independent, polished, and intellectual people, always left their slippers in the lobby.\"\nseems to have been but little distinction in the forms of salutation. According to these forms one is entitled to be saluted (except he be a very low-caste person) in the same manner that he salutes his host; for, in the modes of saluting, by clasping the hands, there is no distinction between the noble aristocrat and the humble plebeian. The etiquette amongst the Sinhalese is, that a female ought to raise her hands to the forehead, whilst it suffices if a male should only lift them up so high as the tip of his fingers might reach his lips. In the Galle District, it is a serious offence not to return the salutation of a person; and so scrupulous are they in this respect, that the late first Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r, Illangak\u00f3n of M\u00e1tara, never failed to return the compliment to all the Sinhalese who paid him the respect by bowing with an \u0113ndili,*\u2014by which is meant the obeisance made by the clasping of the hands together. Of course he never raised his hands to the face when a Paduw\u00e1 or a Berak\u00e1ray\u00e9 was the saluter; but even in the case of such persons, he, as is the practice in nearly all the parts of Ceylon where ancient customs are strictly adhered to, made an inclination of his hand or hands, as the case may be, by raising them up in the form of a semi-Salaam of the Hindus. With regard to others of inferior classes, no distinction is ever shown by those who correctly understand the etiquette on the subject. A Buddhist priest, or Buddha is to be worshipped pasan\u0331ga pihituw\u00e1, (\u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0941\u0917 \u092a\u093f\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0941\u0935\u093e) as we read in innumerable passages in the Buddhist scriptures, that is, by touching the ground with five parts of the body of the saluter. This is difficult to be explained without a representation; but if the reader will only fancy a person falling down on his face,\u2020 and then lifting up the body supported by the forehead, the two elbows, and the knees\u2014and then putting his clasped-hands to the forehead, he may perhaps get some\n\n* In the anjali (Sanskrit) or respectful obeisance, (says Professor Wilson), the head is slightly bowed, the palms of the hands are brought together, and raised literally to the middle of the forehead, so that the tips of the thumbs only are in contact with it. Hindu Theatre, Vol. II. p. 108.\n\n\u2020 \"I fell at his feet to worship him.\" Rev. xix. 10.\nconception of a person prostrating in the manner indicated by pasanga pihituwa.*\n\nIt is pleasing indeed to see well trained natives make the usual salutation between man and man; for they do it in as graceful a manner as a Frenchman makes a bow. On the contrary, nothing can be more offensive to the sight than the half-English and half-Sinhalese salutation of some, the nolens-volens nod of others, and the ill-looking bow of that foreign people whom a Gajab\u00e1hu made the settlers of the Alutk\u00faru K\u00f3ral\u00e9. Like their outward forms of salutation, their language, too, is a mixture of Sinhalese and foreign idioms, and is different from that spoken by the real descendants of the Sinha race.\n\nAmongst the Sinhalese, a present of some little thing, when made by an inferior to a superior, is considered as a high mark of respect; and to refuse it is to insult the donor. The Natives usually take forty leaves of betel, as the arghya\u2020 of our Hindu neighbours, on visiting their chiefs. A \"pingo,\" or kada or cakes and fruits is not unfrequently presented; and this is ornamented with white tender leaves of the coconut palm. Amongst equals, presents are exchanged as a mark of attention; and, if from a low-caste man, one of a higher caste receives a favor, the latter shows his respect by visiting the former with a pingo, which he takes no farther than the stile of the low-caste man's garden.\n\nWhilst it is a fact that all classes reciprocate the common courtesies of life, it is also a fact, and one worthy of attention\u2014that the Buddhist priests, who receive the homage of the laic, never return the obeisance of any one.\n\n* This is the same form of \"worship\" which the Rev. Spence Hardy in his Eastern Monachism, p. 25, describes as being performed, \"with his forehead to the ground, and touching the ground with his knees and toes.\" But Mr. Hardy is wrong in saying that the \"toes\" should touch the ground. For \"toes,\" read \"elbows.\"\n\n\u2020 \"She comes with an arghya, a present indicative of respect to a superior. It matters not of what it consists.\"\u2014Wilson's Hindu Theatre, I. p. 813.\nThis is, perhaps, from a notion that as a \"son of Buddha,\" and indeed, one of 'the three gems of adoration,' the priest is entitled to the same reverence,* which Buddha exacted from all beings. For, it is stated by that sage, in his first discourse in the P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101, on being remonstrated by V\u0113ranja against what he considered an unjustifiable departure from decorum and propriety on the part of Gautama, by not reverently saluting venerable Br\u0101hmans; such as the aged, the honorable, the experienced, and the far advanced in life\u2014that there was not a single being amongst Br\u0101hmans, Gods, Sramanas or Br\u0101hmans in the whole universe of the Br\u0101hma, the D\u00e9wa, and the human worlds, whom he should reverently salute, in whose presence he should rise, or whom he should invite to be seated.\u2020\n\nThe scriptures, too, receive the same reverence from the votaries of Buddha, which they pay to the priesthood. For, as Mr. Justice Stark properly observes \"the J\u0101taka-pota, or the Book of Incarnations is styled J\u0101taka-pot-wahans\u00e9.\" As to the respectful posture in which the scriptures should be listened to, it is stated in the L\u014dw\u0113da-sa\u1e45grahaya, that \"one should neither sit on high whilst the bana is read on the ground, nor stand up whilst it is read on high.\"\n\nThe Rev. Spence Hardy thus notices the subject, in his work on Eastern Monachism.\n\n\"The Sramana receives worship from the householder, and he forms part of the Sangha, in which all Buddhists profess to take refuge, when they repeat the three-fold formula of protection. The priest never make obeisance to any one, and never pay any outward mark of respect. In the books, they are represented as using the word t\u014d, a form of the\n\n* \"The protection of Sangha cannot be received by any one who sits near a priest without permission.\"\u2014Hardy's Eastern Monachism, p. 210.\n\n\u2020 The habits of the Sinhalese in respect of the outward marks of respect and attention to superiors, accord with those of the Hindus; as enjoined by Manu in his Institutes, ii. \u00a7 185.\u2014See also, Tr. Asiatic S. iii. p. 198., et seq.\nsecond person singular that is offensively low, when addressing kings or even deities; all other persons use the honorific form of the verb when addressing them, but they never use it in return; they receive honour from all beings, in all forms; but they never give it to any being in any form.\"\u2014p. 414.\n\nMr. Hardy is substantially correct in what he states in the above extract; but the remark respecting \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0ddd, as being the pronoun used by the priest to the layman, requires qualification. It is possible that this \"form of the second person singular\" occurs in books translated from the P\u0101li into the Sinhalese; but I have never met with a single passage in any original Sinhalese work in which a priest is made to address a laic, much less a King, or a God, with a pronoun \"that is offensively low.\" The word that I have always met with in my reading, as the pronoun used by the priest to the laic (except indeed where the P\u0101li \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd3 twan is rendered literally into Sinhalese) is \u0dad\u0db4\u0dd2 tepi or \u0dad\u0db4\u0dd2 topi, the form of the second person plural, which I need not inform the reader, becomes like other terms of address when used in the plural form, an honorific.*\n\nI shall content myself with five examples:\n\n1. In the Attangalu-Wansa, Nanda Mah\u0101 Th\u0113ra is made to address his royal pupil, Siri Sa\u1e45gab\u014d, who was also his nephew, with \u0d8a\u0db8 you thus: \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1\u0ddb\u0db1\u0dcf

The same prince having afterwards refused to assume the reigns of Government, is thus addressed by the priesthood, upon the earnest solicitations of the populace:\n\n\"There is much merit that you (o) have acquired,\" &c.\n\n3. King Milindu is thus addressed by N\u00e1gas\u00e9na th\u00e9ra in the Milindapra\u015bna; and this be it remembered is like the last, a translation from the Pali:\u2014\"He inquired, 'Monarch, where is the city of your (o) birth,' &c.\n\n4. In the Th\u00fapawans\u00e1 the priest Maha-sup is represented as speaking to King Aj\u00e1tasatru thus: \"He said, Monarch, danger is to be apprehended in future to the venerable relics, from (the malignity of) heretics. It is as well, whilst there are kings eminently faithful like yourself (o) to make a depository of relics with a view to avert the danger.\"\n\n5. Mah\u00e1s\u00e9na, a God of Swarga is addressed by Assagutta th\u00e9ra with tepi, in the following passage in the Milindapra\u015bna:\u2014\"Hail your divine Majesty Mah\u00e1s\u00e9na; we who always behold with our divine eyes these six heavens besides the human world, have failed to perceive any one besides yourself (o,) who is able to defeat King Milindu in his artful dialectics, and thereby to nourish the religion of Buddha.\"\n\nI have already made a passing allusion to dya b\u00f3van \"long life,\" as a term of greeting amongst the Sinhalese. I may here also mention that we use another term which is\n\"may your life be preserved;\" and it is not unusual amongst us to bid one\u2014subagaman, which literally means \"fare-well.\" The usual mode of taking leave amongst the Sinhalese, is by asking awasara, \"leave\"\u2014although amongst equals we frequently say, mama gohin \"I shall go and return,\" quite different from the Tamil varum, simply, \"I will come.\"\n\nWith the above my observations on the forms of salutation and modes of address amongst the Sinhalese, terminate; but, before I conclude, I cannot forbear making a few remarks on what Mr. Stark considers the connection between \"the royal colour,\" and \"the title of the great.\"\n\n\"Nila was thus perhaps what may be called the royal or government colour, and words of that formation may be so derived. There was a Nilam\u00e9, at the head of several of the departments. It was the title usually given to any high official, and it is still the title of the great officer of government in the temples.\n\n\"The term in question may, I conceive, be so rendered accordingly. Thus when the valiant G-ja-b\u00e1hu B\u00e1ja, whose city (unlike the banquet house of a great king as his ministers ignorantly represented) had been entered by an enemy, and many captives taken, at length resolved on an expedition for their recovery, he went out from the council with Nila Y\u00f3day\u00e9 (nila y\u00f3day\u00e9) the great officer of war. These words, however, have been rendered 'Nila the giant,' and 'the great giant Nila,' as if nila were a proper name, and not like nilaya (nilaya) and nilatala (nilatala) an office, place or situation.\"\n\nThere is no more connection between nila as a 'colour,' and nila as an 'office,'\u2014than there is between nil as the verb, \"to be unwilling,\" and nill as the noun which signifies \"the shining spark of brass in trying and melting the ore.\" Nor is the appellation of Gaja B\u00e1hu's giant, who accompanied him on his expedition to the S\u00f3lian country, derived from nila (blue colour,) any more than is the Nila Purd\u00e1na of the serpent God,* or the great nila, that lofty and sacred mountain\n\n* See Asiatic Researches, Vol. xv.\nof the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, whose summit was of pure and bright gold.*\n\nAs respects colour Mr. Stark adds:\n\n\"The great colour was \u0928\u0940\u0932 (nila) the colour of the sky and ocean, and like these, indeed, susceptible of many shades from green to dark blue; but commonly denoting this last, the colour of Vishnu's garment. It is to this colour allusion is so often made in the descriptive writings of the Sinhalese poets; as when they sing the praises of feet, soft and beautiful 'as the full blown lotus.'\n\n\"Also when they speak of 'lotus hair,' and the \u0928\u0940\u0932\u0915\u0923\u094d\u0920 (nilayakara) or blue ornament of dark eyes.\"\n\nThe Sinhalese are, doubtless, great admirers of blue as a \"colour;\" yet it is not to that colour which allusion is so often made in the descriptive writings of the poets, as supposed by Mr. Stark. When in singing the praises of the feet, the poet compares them to \u0928\u0940\u0932\u0915\u0923\u094d\u0920 \"the full blown tender lotus,\" he only compares them to the broad formation, and the tenderness, of the flower\u2014by no means intending to convey its colour. For sara as a name for the lotus, is a generic term. It may either be the white or the red lotus: but it never signifies the Nelumbium speciosum, which is distinguished by nilupul; as when we speak of a nilupulesi, 'blue-lotus-eyed,' a term for 'woman,' expressive of her beauty as 'belle,' is in English. The hair, it is true, is compared to blue objects, as the tail of a peacock, and sometimes to green objects, as the Valesnaria octandra;\u2020 but never, as I apprehend, to the lotus: and the reason for this, (what may seem to be a strange comparison) is\u2014not that nila, \"blue,\" is considered to be a \"great,\" \"government,\" or \"royal, colour\"; but that the Sinhalese did not anciently draw a distinction between green, blue, and black. Thus, when we say, \u0928\u0940\u0932\u0915\u0923\u094d\u0920\n\n* The fact however, that one and the same word can in the course of time assume various forms for various objects, proved as it is by numberless examples, requires no further support.\u2014Bopp's Comp. Gram., p. 16.\n\n\u2020 See my Sidat Sangar\u0101, Note Ap. p. xcviii,\nin respect of our eyes, we do not mean, \"blue ornament of dark eyes,\" but simply the darkness of one's eyes, or the dimness which one feels on getting a fit of fainting.\n\nBut Mr. Stark is right when he understands the phrase \u0d85\u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 lotus-mouth, as referring to \"red lips;\" for it is remarkable that whilst western nations sing the praises of the lips signifying the mouth, in a limited sense; the orientals speak of the mouth in a like sense to signify the lips. \u0d85\u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 is specifically the \"red lotus,\" and in comparing the mouth to that flower, we only convey the redness of the lips, as the English bard conveys the same idea, by referring to Coral. Speaking of tambara, Mr. Stark thinks that \"it might well give occasion to the same name as a designation of the Island, \u0d85\u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 'T\u0101mbrapar\u1e47i,' red leaf, whence the classic appellation for Ceylon, Taprobane.\"\n\nThe origin of this word is no longer a matter for speculation. It is well known that it is derived from Tambavanna, \"copper colour,\"\u2014that hue which seems to be held so sacred amongst the Hindus, that, according to the institutes of Manu, (Cap. iv. \u00a7 130), it is an offence to pass over even the \"shadow of a copper-coloured man\"; but I am glad of the opportunity thus presented, of correcting an error into which the learned translator of the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 has inadvertently fallen.\n\nDr. Mill, in recording his opinion on \"this most authentic History of Ceylon\"; says, in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, for December 1836:\n\n\"This real origin of the celebrated name Taprobane\u2014(whatever may be thought of the story connected with it in the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 and which may seem with greater probability to have arisen from the Tamra-varna, or copper colour, of its southern cliffs near Matura, so well known to Navigators\u2014is one of the points of curious and interesting information which we owe mainly to this publication of Mr. Turnour. Whatever had been before suggested on the probable origin of that name, so little now known except in these Buddhistic Books, as one of the proper names of the great island of Lanka or Singhala-duipa, was in the highest degree forced and improbable (e.g. the Hind. Tapuvi-Raban; or 'the Island of Ravana.')\"\n\n\u2014p. 830.\nNow Dr. Mill was quite right in thinking it was more probable that this name was derived from *t\u0101mra-var\u1e47a* (which is *tamba-van\u1e47a* in P\u0101li) \"copper colour,\" than from *tamba panniyo*, \"copper palmed,\" given in Mr. Turnour's version of the Mah\u0101wans\u0101. For, it appears that Mr. Turnour has fallen into this error by taking the text to be *Tumba pannattha panniyo*. And although he has corrected the text in his *Errata*, by giving as the correct word *Tambavanattha p\u0101nayo*, he has, nevertheless, failed to rectify the error in the Translation,\u2014an omission by which he has permitted the passage to remain thus:\n\n\"At the spot where the seven-hundred men, with the King at their head, exhausted (by sea sickness, and faint from weakness) had landed out of the vessel, supporting themselves on the palms of their hand pressed on the ground, they set themselves down. Hence, to them the name of Tambapanniyo (copper-palmed, from the colour of the soil. From this circumstance that wilderness obtained the name of Tambapanni. From the same cause also this renowned land became celebrated (under that name).\u2014Mahawans\u0101, p. 50.\n\nWith all the deference due to the memory of so distinguished an Orientalist as Mr. Turnour, I venture to offer the following translation:\n\n\"The seven-hundred men, with the king at their head, who had come from thence, landed out of the vessel, exhausted and faint from weakness; and sat themselves down by pressing the palms of their hands on the ground. Whereby their palms became (*tamba-van\u1e47a,* copper coloured. From this circumstance that wilderness obtained the name of *Tambapanna*; and from the same cause also this renowned land became designated by that name.\"\n\nThe Tik\u0101 has the following explanation, to which we append a Translation; and it fully bears out the correctness of the text and the conjecture of Dr. Mill.\n\n*Tambapanni yat\u014d ah\u016bti\u2014yat\u014d, yasm\u0101 tamba bh\u016bmi-raj\u00e9hi phu\u1e6d\u1e6dhatta t\u0113sanp\u0101ni tambawanno ah\u014dsi; tat\u014diasm\u0101 s\u014dpad\u0113s\u014dcha \u0113vasadd\u0113na gahitametta nagarancha ayan d\u012bp\u014dchati im\u0113 sabb\u0113 tambap\u0101nina mak\u0101 ah\u00e9sunti ath\u014d.*\nThat is:\u2014Tambapanni yat\u00f3 ah\u00fati, &c.\u2014signifies \"Since by reason of touching the dust of copper-coloured earth, their palms became copper coloured; by reason thereof was this province, the city (built therein), and this Island, designated Tambap\u00e1ni,\" &c.\n\nHaving thus ascertained the origin of this classic appellation for Ceylon, I purpose, before concluding, to advert to an important topic suggested by the following remarks on the subject by Dr. Mill:\n\n\"Whenever corresponding words in the Pali and Sinhalese occur, as they do everywhere, I believe it will be invariably found that the latter (the vernacular words of the people of the Kandian and Maritime provinces of Ceylon), resemble most closely the Sanskrit original of both:\u2014whereas the former, the sacred language, tales in all words that admit of it, the same sort of peculiar variation which belongs to the tongues of northernmost India,\u2014showing evidently that it was thence, and not from Ceylon, that the peculiar language as well its institutions of Buddhism came to the Island,\u2014as the Mahawansi itself distinctly asserts. To take but one out of the many instances that might be alleged, we may give one of the most remarkable and early names of the Island, viz. Tambapannyo, as the Pali name is given in p. 35 of this specimen of the Mahawansi, viz. the \"copper-palmed:\" in Sanskrit Tamra-p\u00e1ni. Now this Sanskrit form, so different from the Pali, is actually the present Sinhalese for the same thing, as I was assured by a competent scholar on the Island; and a very convincing proof that it has ever been so, may be seen in the name by which the Island was universally known to the ancients and to Cosmas Indicopleustes when he visited it, viz. TAPROBANE. The Greeks would be just as unlikely, to introduce this r where it did not exist, as any other languages of India, besides the northernmost ones would be to drop it where it before existed; but this is a universal character of the Pr\u00e1krit and of the present Hindi, (as seen in this word, tamba, copper, k\u00e1m, \"word\" for karm, &c., &c.)\u2014Beng. A. Society's Journal, vol. v., p. 830.\n\nWithout controverting the main position of the learned Doctor, viz., that there was a connection between the History of Ceylon before the Christian era, with that of Maghadda, or that part of northern India which we now call Behar*; I\n\n* \"Our language furnishes us with strong evidence against the supposition that it belongs to the Southern class of languages.\"\u2014Sidat Sagara, p. lvii.\nmay be permitted to remark that the Sinhalese resembles the P\u0101li more than the Sanskrit;* and this is the case not only in respect to the general structure of the language, but in reference to the particular appellation given to this\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\"utmost Indian isle, Taprobane.\"\n\nFor, although Dr. Mill states on the authority of what he regarded a \"competent scholar on the Island\"\u2014that \"the Sanskrit form (t\u0101mra-p\u0101ni) so different from the P\u0101li, is actually the present Sinhalese\u2020 for the same thing;\" it is nevertheless very clear that the Sinhalese word, Tammana for the same place,\u2021 is derived from the P\u0101li, and not from the Sanskrit. From the fact, that this Island was anciently called Taprobane by Western nations, especially the Greeks, who, it is probable to suppose, \"would be just as unlikely to introduce this r where it did not exist, as any other nations of India (besides the Northernmost ones would be to drop it where it before existed)\"\u2014a presumption doubtless arises in favor of this name having been of Sanskrit origin. But we cannot give much weight to this presumption, when the same facts upon which it is based may render the truth of a different hypothesis probable, viz., that the Greeks, after the Wijayan \u00e6ra, were indebted for the name to persons who expressed themselves in Sanskrit, or in a dialect of Sanskrit origin.\u00a7 For, whilst it is quite clear from the writings of the\n\n---\n\n* The Sinhalese became incorporated with Sanskrit forms only at a very recent date. See Sidat Sangar\u0101, pp. xxx., liii., clxiv.\n\n\u2020 In Sinhalese historical works, Tambapanna is called Tammana; See Rajawaliya, and Forbes' Eleven Years in Ceylon, vol. I. p. 11.

My object at present is briefly to show the particular relation which the Sinhalese bears to the P\u0101li, and to explain that the Sanskrit element in the Sinhalese, to which Dr. Mill refers in the paragraph above extracted from his notes, is one of comparatively modern introduction.* I shall briefly allude to several peculiarities.\n\n1. It is a phenomenon well known, that in many Sanskrit words a \\(k\\) is frequently followed by a \\(sh\\); and that in their corresponding P\u0101li terms, the \\(sh\\) is changed into the aspirate of \\(k\\). Thus:\n\n- \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937 vriksha into \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dca rukkha, 'tree.'\n- \u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u093e ksham\u00e1 into \u0d9a\u0db8\u0dcf kham\u00e1, 'forgiveness.'\n- \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 dakshi\u1e47a into \u0daf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0dab dakkhi\u1e47a, 'south.'\n- \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0930\u093e kshura into \u0d9a\u0dbb \u0d9a\u0dbb khara, 'razor.'\n- \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 kshetra into \u0d9a\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7 khetta, 'field.'\n\nOn comparing the above with their corresponding Sinhalese words, there is clear evidence that the P\u0101li forms are alone changed into the Sinhalese. Thus:\n\n| San. | P\u0101li. | Siy. |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937 | \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dca | \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dca 'ruk.' |\n| \u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u093e | \u0d9a\u0db8\u0dcf | \u0d9a\u0db8\u0dcf 'kama.' |\n| \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 | \u0daf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0dab | \u0daf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0dab 'dakunu.' |\n| \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0930\u093e | \u0d9a\u0dbb \u0d9a\u0dbb | \u0d9a\u0dbb 'kara.' |\n| \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 | \u0d9a\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7 | \u0d9a\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7 'ket.' |\n\nIt is unnecessary to multiply examples; but I may mention the following, which easily occur to my mind; \u0906\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092e, \u0906\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092e, \u0906\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092e 'an ascetic;' \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917 'eye;' \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917 'demon;' \u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938, \u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938, \u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938 'niwan;' \u0932\u093e\u0915, \u0932\u093e\u0915, \u0932\u093e\u0915 'a lac;' \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917 'an eye;' &c.\n\n* See my Sidat-Sangard, pp. xlvi, clxxxvii.\n2. Another phenomenon to which I shall advert, is, that when the Sanskrit vowel \u1e5bi, which is not known to the P\u0101li and Sinhalese, is found changed into another vowel in the P\u0101li, that same vowel is adopted in the Sinhalese. Thus:\n\n| San.   | P\u0101li.     | Siy.       |\n|-------|-----------|------------|\n| \u1e5bi ju | \u1e5bi uju    | \u1e5bi udu     | 'direct.' |\n| \u1e5bi mridu | \u1e5bi mudu | \u1e5bi mudu | 'tender.' |\n| \u1e5bi rishi | \u1e5bi isi | \u1e5bi isi | 'a Rishi.' |\n| \u1e5bi ridhi | \u1e5bi iddhi | \u1e5bi idu.* |          |\n| \u1e5bi prishtha | \u1e5bi pittha | \u1e5bi pi\u1e6d\u1e6dha | 'back.' |\n| \u1e5bi griha | \u1e5bi geha | \u1e5bi g\u00e9 | 'house.' |\n| \u1e5bi dri\u1e0dha | \u1e5bi dalha | \u1e5bi da\u1e37a | 'coarse.' |\n| \u1e5bi krita | \u1e5bi kata | \u1e5bi ka\u1e6d\u1e6da | 'made.' |\n| \u1e5bi hrida | \u1e5bi hada | \u1e5bi hada | 'heart.' |\n| \u1e5bi krimi | \u1e5bi kimi | \u1e5bi kimi | 'worm.' |\n| \u1e5bi mrita | \u1e5bi mata | \u1e5bi mala | 'dead.' |\n| \u1e5bi tridla | \u1e5bi sigda | \u1e5bi sivul | 'jackal.' |\n| \u1e5bi vriksha | \u1e5bi rukkha | \u1e5bi ruk | 'tree.' |\n\n3. It is well known that the conjunct \u1e5b found in the Sanskrit is frequently lost in the P\u0101li. When this is the case, the corresponding words in the Sinhalese bear a greater affinity to the P\u0101li than to the Sanskrit. Thus:\n\n| San.   | P\u0101li.     | Siy.       |\n|-------|-----------|------------|\n| \u1e5bi t\u0101mra | \u1e5bi tamba | \u1e5bi ta\u1e41ba | 'copper.' |\n| \u1e5bi var\u1e47a | \u1e5bi va\u1e47\u1e47a | \u1e5bi va\u1e47\u1e47a | 'colour.' |\n| \u1e5bi kar\u1e47a | \u1e5bi kar\u1e47a | \u1e5bi kana | 'ear.' |\n| \u1e5bi par\u1e47a | \u1e5bi par\u1e47a | \u1e5bi pa\u1e47a | 'leaf.' |\n| \u1e5bi ar\u1e0dha | \u1e5bi ar\u1e0dha | \u1e5bi ada | 'half.' |\n| \u1e5bi wastra | \u1e5bi wattha | \u1e5bi wattha | 'raiment.' |\n| \u1e5bi waktra | \u1e5bi watta | \u1e5bi wat | 'face.' |\n| \u1e5bi ir\u1e63ya | \u1e5bi issa | \u1e5bi isa | 'enmity.' |\n| \u1e5bi k\u1e63etra | \u1e5bi khetta | \u1e5bi ket | 'field.' |\n| \u1e5bi traddha | \u1e5bi saddha | \u1e5bi sed\u0113 | 'faith.' |\n\n* A word signifying 'the power to go through the air.'\nNo. 10.\u20141856-8.] SINGHALESE TERMS OF ADDRESS. 251\n\nSan.

The gentlemen present were all aware, that owing to different causes, one of which was the removal from the Island of several gentlemen of known scientific attainments who took an active part in the transactions of the Society, the institution had been dormant for some time. It was however thought desirable that an effort should be made to revive it now, and to obtain for it the support of the public; and it had been intimated to him, that if the Society should succeed in obtaining the support so much desired, it would be in their power to secure the publication of some works of Oriental literature of undoubted importance. Mr. Gogerly, whose absence that night he regretted, spoke in a letter which had been just received, of the assistance, which the Society might, if properly encouraged, derive from its Native members. He also referred to Mr de Alwis, who was prepared with several papers on subjects of interest, and to Mr. de Zoysa, whom he thought competent to undertake the translation of the portion of the Mah\u00e1w\u00e1pas\u00e1, which had been left untranslated by Mr. Turnour. Mr. Nietner had some very valuable papers on the Natural History of the Island, and he believed there were others in the Island, who would,\nwith the opportunity afforded of doing so, render much assistance in various other branches of Science. It was therefore necessary, that the Secretary should be instructed to call a General Meeting for the purpose of electing Members and Office-bearers. He had entertained hopes of obtaining for the Society the services of Captain Oldfield as Secretary; but he regretted to say that that gentleman, who was prevented from attending the meeting by an indisposition, had communicated that his contemplated removal from Colombo would render it impossible for him to accept the office. He had, however, kindly promised, that while at Trincomalie, he would at all times be ready to devote a portion of his time to the Society's service. They had therefore, not only to select a gentleman for the office of Secretary, but also to elect members for a Committee. It would be desirable to ask His Excellency the Governor to be the Patron of the Society, and the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, who he, was glad to find took a deep interest in the Society's welfare, as Vice-Patron. Among other matters of difficulty which the Society had to contend with at present, the want of a place to transact business in, was perhaps not the least. He had spoken to several gentlemen on the subject, and it was suggested by some, that this want might be remedied by the erection of a story over the United Service Library. Indeed he could name gentlemen who had promised to subscribe \u00a310 each towards the purpose, which he thought could be easily effected. The Colonial Secretary, with whom he had also conferred, had expressed his willingness to aid in the promotion of the measure, and if a representation were duly made, he (Mr L.) had no doubt that they might be able to secure the sanction of the Government as well as a grant from the Legislature for making such necessary alteration in the U. S. Library, as should render a portion of that building available for the use of the Society, and for a Public Museum. To facilitate the attainment of the object in view, he had, through the kindness of Mr Churchill, procured a plan of the proposed alterations, which he had great pleasure in laying before the Meeting.\n\nMr. Alwis stated, that owing to certain repairs which the rooms of the Loan Board had lately undergone, it had become necessary to remove the Society's Library and its Museum (which had been in those Rooms) into an apartment of the Colonial Secretary's Office, and that the Society at present had no place in which they could meet or transact business. Owing to the causes to which Mr. Layard had referred, the Society had been dormant for some time past. Its last General Meeting was held so far back as February 1854, and no Committee Meeting had been convened since the 17th August of that year. The Proceedings of those Meetings\nwould be found published in the Society's Journal for 1853-54, which had yet to be issued to the subscribers. It was, however, gratifying to notice, that owing to the liberality of Government, and the kindness of the gentleman who presided over its Printing Establishment, the last volume of the Journal, which contained several interesting papers, extending over 300 pages, had been printed without any expense to the Society. It was attributable to this circumstance, that they were able to find on reference to the accounts of the Treasurer, a balance, though a trifling one, in favour of the Society. It amounted to \u00a38 7s. 3d., and would doubtless have been larger, had the subscriptions of the two past years been collected. The omission to do this was not unintentional. It was considered, that while the operations of the Society were unavoidably suspended, it was neither just nor fair to call upon subscribers to pay. If it be the wish of this Meeting that these operations should be revived, it was not only necessary to select a Secretary, but also desirable to place at the disposal of the Society a room in which its Library might be placed, and its proceedings held.\n\nAfter some desultory conversation, in which several gentlemen took part, Mr. Dawson remarked, that public support should not be solicited, until the Society had been completely reorganized. It was most necessary to hold a Meeting, and to appoint a Committee, before an application could be made with anything like reason, either for the assistance of Government or of the public. With regard to the proposal to build a story over the Library, he feared that it was not a practicable one. The Library was public property, and although we might contribute to the erection of an upper story, the building itself would remain vested in the public, and not in the Society. He would therefore propose, that the Secretary might be instructed temporarily to rent a house in the Fort, and he thought that the funds of the Society, though small, would enable them to do so, until other arrangements could be made by which the Society might be enabled to obtain a permanent place for the despatch of business.\n\nIt was then Resolved:\n\n1.\u2014That Mr. Dawson be kindly requested to look for and engage a building in the Fort, in which the Society might be accommodated for the present. Mr. Dawson expressed his assent.\n\n2.\u2014That the Assistant Secretary be instructed to convene a General Meeting of the Society for Saturday the 11th instant, at 4 p.m. Dr. Willisford kindly offered his house for the proposed Meeting, which was accepted.\n3 \u2014That a deputation consisting of Mr. C. P. Layard, Dr. Willisford, Mr Dawson, the Rev. Mr. Thurstan, Mr. J. Alwis, Mr. Coomarasamy and Mr. Lorenz, be requested to wait on His Excellency the Governor, the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, and the Hon'ble the Major General, and to invite them to join the Society, and to allow themselves to be nominated the Patron and Vice-Patrons of the Society respectively.

Mr. Layard said, that in accordance with the 3rd Resolution just read, he had spoken to His Excellency the Governor intimating to him, on behalf of the Society, that a deputation was appointed to wait upon him, and that His Excellency expressed his willingness to receive them at a time which he would afterwards appoint. Mr. Dawson said, that he had made inquiries, and had engaged at a rental of \u00a31 per month, two rooms behind the Chamber of Commerce, and that in his opinion they were sufficient to hold the Society's Museum and Library. If, however, they were deemed insufficient to hold the Society's General Meetings, he had no doubt that the Chamber of Commerce would, on such occasions, gladly accommodate the Society within their Rooms. Resolved, that the rooms engaged by Mr. Dawson be rented on behalf of the Society at \u00a31 per month, commencing from the 1st November next.\n\nThe Assistant Secretary laid before the Meeting a Memorandum in which the Committee of 1854 resolved to discontinue the services of the Society's Taxidermist, and to appoint a peon at a salary of \u00a31 per month. He stated at the same time, that the Society had no peon at present, and that it would be desirable to engage one, especially to take charge of the Society's new rooms.\nMr. Skeen drew the attention of the Meeting to the state of the Society's finances, and laid on the Table the accounts, shewing a balance in favour of the Society of \u00a38 7s. 3d.\n\nRead a letter from the Secretary of the Auckland Museum to Mr. Dawson, requesting that that gentleman would use his influence with the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, to forward to the above Institution, some of the productions of this Island.\n\nResolved, on the suggestion of Captain Dudley, that a letter be written to Colonel Hope, requesting that he would be pleased to communicate to this Society the result of his Meteorological observations.\n\nThe following Gentlemen were then proposed and elected Members of the Society:\u2014\n\nJ.

Kelkart, in the Chair.\nThe Rev. B. Boake.          Dr. Willisford.\nM. Coomarasamy, Esq.       W. Skeen, Esq.\nJ. Alwis, Esq.              J. Capper, Esq.\nL. De Zoysa, Esq.\n\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting having been read, the Secretary proceeded to read the Report of the Committee for the past year.\n\nThe Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society was reorganized in October 1856, and having secured rooms for its Library and Museum, affording far greater accommodation than had previously been the case, has now 37 resident and 32 non-resident Members. To this number, it is hoped there will be many accessions in the course of the present year.\nThe return to Ceylon of Mr. Capper, one of the originators of the Society, is an event from which the Committee augur many and permanent benefits. His former services are sufficiently conspicuous to need more than a passing observation. The palmy days of the Society were those in which that gentleman officiated as Secretary with unflagging interest, and the most constant attention. To the same duties he has kindly signified his willingness again to devote his leisure and abilities; and the Committee have the greatest satisfaction in submitting his name as Secretary, among the List of Office-bearers for the ensuing year, conjointly with Mr. Alwis, to whom the Society owes considerable obligation for his present services.\n\nFrom other causes also, the Committee anticipate for the future more vigorous action in this branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. During the construction of the Railway, and from the contemplated sojourn in the Island of an enlarged Military force, many scientific gentlemen will probably arrive, from whose enlightened research much may be expected, and who will doubtless gladly avail themselves of the facilities afforded by this Society for the prosecution and publication of their investigations.\n\nFrom the Treasurer's account it will be perceived, that the income of the Society for the last 14 months has been \u00a347 1s 9d., exclusive of subscriptions not yet collected. Of the amount already collected, \u00a325 16s. 5d have been expended, leaving a balance of \u00a321 5s. 4d in the Treasurer's hands. Against this balance, however, there is a liability of nearly \u00a314 for house rent, for which as yet no demand has been made; and considering that the purchase of several new works on Oriental Literature is thought desirable, the necessity for increased aid in the way of donations and subscriptions is manifest. Indeed, were it not for the liberality of the Government in permitting the Journal of the Society to be printed free of expense at the Government Press, the funds of the Society could not have borne the outlay necessary for the publication of its papers. This arrangement, however, while it has had the effect of saving considerable expenditure, and has enabled the Committee to issue their Journals in a superior style, is yet attended with some inconvenience, which the Committee hope, with the sanction of the Society, they will shortly be able to obviate. The inconvenience alluded to, is the delay, which from the large amount of work required for Government purposes, necessarily demanding the immediate attention of that establishment, inevitably takes place in the issue of the Society's Journal. To this cause is attributable the non-appearance of a reprint of the first Number of the Society's Journal, which had been resolved upon, and of which copies are not now to be had; and the delay that has arisen in the publication of the fourth Number of the new series, of which only 100 pages have been completed. To remedy this evil,\nit is proposed that the Society should engage a Compositor, to be employed under Mr. Skeen upon the papers now in hand, so as to enable him to issue the forthcoming Number at an early date.\n\nYour Committee bring this subject thus prominently before the Society, as they have had several applications for complete sets of the Journals, not only from subscribers, and scientific gentlemen visiting Ceylon, but also from Oriental scholars in England, which they have been unable to comply with, from the cause already stated.\n\nThe Journal now in course of publication will contain a larger amount of information than any of its predecessors, and of a character interesting alike to the scholar, the antiquary, and the man of science. It will consist of papers by Mr. Nietner, describing numerous new species of Ceylon Coleoptera; a Translation of certain chapters of the Mahawamsa, describing the magnificent works for irrigation constructed by King Parakkrama Bahu, A.D., 1153-1186, with an Introduction and Notes by Mr. De Zoysa; a Translation of the Attanagalu-wansa, or the life of Sri Sanga S\u00ea, with an Introduction and Notes by Mr. J. Alwis; an Essay on Hindu Philosophy, by Mr. M. Coomarasamy; a Paper on the Sinhalese Method of computing Time by the Rev. C. Alwis; and a Paper on Honorary Titles and Modes or Salutation among the Sinhalese, by Mr. J. Alwis\u2014to which it is proposed to add a Paper on Sinhalese Music by Mr. L. Nell; one on new and interesting species of Nudibranchiate Molluscs, Sea Anemones and Planaria, found in the Harbour of Trincomalie, by Dr Kelaart; and also a paper by Mr. J. Alwis, on the supposed identity between Nagasena, of Buddhistical Annals, and Nagajuna, the character who holds a distinguished place in the Raja Tarangini. The three last papers will be read to the Society, and the Committee have no doubt but they will be found of sufficient interest to be submitted to the Committee of Papers with a view to their publication.\n\nYour Committee desire to bring to the notice of the Society, the state of its Library and Museum.\n\nIn addition to the Reports and Medals of the Great Exhibition of 1851, entrusted to the Society, the Committee have to acknowledge the presentation by His Excellency the Governor, of sixteen volumes of the original prospectuses of the various exhibitors; the Reports and Medals of the Paris Exhibition, awarded to this Island; and the Report, &c., of the Madras Exhibition. They also beg to acknowledge the receipt of many valuable works in the course of the past year.\nThese presentations and donations invest your Society with a character and importance which it is desirable to maintain. As the only Literary and Scientific Institution in the Island, the value of its Library cannot be over-estimated. Travellers from several parts of Europe, to some of whom your Committee have lately afforded access, have thankfully acknowledged its worth. And to the Scholar and the Orientalist it affords a fund of knowledge which is elsewhere sought in vain.\n\nIn view of these considerations, therefore, your Committee recommend the purchase of all works having reference to Ceylon, with which the Library has not as yet been furnished; and also the acquisition of many Oriental works of undoubted interest and usefulness, among which may be enumerated, several of Professor Wilson's publications, including his Sanscrit Dictionary, and Grammar, and the Lalita Vistra, the legendary Life of Budhu, now being published in the Bibliotheca Indica at Calcutta.\n\nThe Society's Museum, the Committee regret to state, has, for some time past, from the want of a Curator, been greatly neglected. This want they hope to remedy, by the appointment to that office of a gentleman who has signified his willingness to discharge the duties of the appointment until the Society may be in a position to effect better arrangements. Considering how rich Ceylon is in natural productions, it is to be lamented that the funds of the Society will not allow of the appointment of a salaried Curator and Taxidermist.\n\nThe Committee see no reason why Ceylon should not, aided by Government, obtain a Museum, similar to those which now flourish in South Africa, and in the Presidencies of India. The report of the former has been forwarded to your Society, by order of His Excellency the Governor of the Cape, with a letter from Mr. Edgar Layard, the Curator, in which he expresses a hope that \"the Society may be disposed to sanction a system of mutual exchange.\"\n\nThe Committee would, in conclusion, urge upon the Members individually the desirableness of increased efforts on behalf of the Society.\n\nTo the resident Members in Colombo they would recommend the resumption of the Evening Meetings, from which in times past much benefit was derived. In the language of a former Report, they \"have a sensible influence on the prosperity of the Society, tending as they do, to the opening up of new subjects of enquiry, and generally imparting additional vigour to the efforts of its Members.\"\n\nJoint Secretaries { F. W. Willisford.\n{ J. Alwis\nThe Report having been adopted,\u2014It was resolved, that Mr. Skeen be authorised to engage Compositors at the Society's cost to hasten forward the Journal.\n\nThe Secretary and Librarian were authorised to purchase any new works on Ceylon, and to submit any others to the Committee for purchase.\n\nThe following Gentlemen were then ballotted for, and declared elected as Members of this Society:\n\nJ.

D. J. Gogerly.\n\nIn the Papers laid before the Society respecting the laws relative to the Ordination of Buddhist priests, the different precepts are literally translated in the order in which they are recorded in the Mah\u00e1 Vaggo. But this mode, although exact, is tedious, and therefore will be abandoned in this, and the following Papers. The substance of the precepts will be given, with such observations as may tend to elucidate them.\n\nIt has been previously noted, that Buddha declined the formation of a code of laws for the government of the priestly order when he was requested to do so by S\u00e1riputra, one of his chief priests; stating, that it would be more advisable to legislate as circumstances should arise requiring directions to be given. The precepts thus given were afterwards arranged under separate heads. The P\u00e1r\u00e1jika and P\u00e1chittiyan divisions contain the Moral precepts, binding upon every member of the order. The Mah\u00e1 Vaggo and Ch\u00fala Vaggo, contain the Ecclesiastical laws, and the Pariw\u00e1ra P\u00e1jho is a technical recapitulation and explanation of the other four sections of the Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka.\n\nThe second chapter of the Mah\u00e1 Vaggo, explains how the P\u00f3ya, or Up\u00f3satha days were instituted, and gives the rules of their observance. The P\u00f3ya days are, up to the present time, observed by all Buddhists, who on...\nthe changes of the moon attend their temples, make offerings, hear the discourses of Buddha read, or his precepts explained, and devote a portion of the day to meditation, and other religious observances. But the days of the New and of the Full Moon are regarded by the priests as days of peculiar solemnity, each priest being required to be present at a general assembly of the order, at an appointed place within the district, in which he resides, that his moral conduct may be investigated: and if he have been guilty of any irregularity, he must confess it, and submit to ecclesiastical discipline.\n\nThe institution of the Up\u00f3satha resulted from the recommendation of Seniya Bimbis\u00e1ra, the king of Magadha. He observed that the teachers of the Puribb\u00e1jaka sect were accustomed, on the days of the changes of the moon, to assemble their followers and preach to them, in consequence of which they became very popular.\n\nHe waited on Buddha, stated the fact, and requested him to direct his priests to adopt a similar course of proceeding. To this Buddha assented, and calling an assembly of his priests directed them to meet on the days of the New and Full Moon, and on each intervening eighth day. They accordingly met on the days now known as the day of New Moon, the eighth day, the fifteenth day, and the eighth day after the fifteenth day.\n\nAt first they remained quite silent when assembled, as they had received no directions how they were to conduct themselves. When it was reported to Buddha, that the people were much dissatisfied with these silent meetings, he directed that on each day of assembling, they should preach to the people, and explain the doctrines of their religion. It also occurred to him, that it would be advantageous if, on the New Moon, and on the fifteenth day of the month, the priests, in addition to their public preaching, should hold a private meeting in which the Moral precepts, called the P\u00e1timokkha, should be recited,\nand the obedience or disobedience of each priest be ascertained, that thus the purity of the priesthood might be secured. For this purpose, he directed that certain boundaries should be determined on by the Sa\u1e45gha, (or assembly of the priests,) and that all the priests living within that boundary should meet together on the days appointed.\n\nThe boundaries are in no case to include a district more than three yoduns (about 40 miles) in extent; and they are not to be intersected by a river, unless there be a bridge or ferry boat, by which the priests may pass without danger: neither shall one large boundary include smaller boundaries, but each district must be distinct from every other. If a priest reside in a jungle, the boundary shall include the space of 300 feet around his hut. If priests be in a vessel, or on a bank, or rock, within a river or lake, so far as a man can throw water, is to be accounted a boundary.\n\nThere may be many residences for priests within a district, but the Up\u00f3satha services are to be conducted in one place only, which place has been previously consecrated. This Up\u00f3satha hall is to be in general near to the residence of the senior priest of the district. All the priests who are in the district at the time appointed for the meeting, shall assemble in this place: if the number be such that they cannot be accommodated in this one room, a porch, or a verandah, may be added to it; and after it has been consecrated the whole building will be one Up\u00f3satha hall. Notice of the time of meeting shall be given by the senior priest. No layman is to take any part in the proceedings.\n\nPriests are not allowed, except in their own residences, to be without their three robes; but as at times in coming to the Up\u00f3satha, their upper garments may become wet, permission is given to lay aside one of them, if necessary, during the service.\n\nThe Up\u00f3satha service consists of five parts:\u2014\n\n1. The opening service.\n2. The recital of the laws concerning P\u0101r\u0101jika (leading to expulsion).\n3. The recital of the laws concerning Sa\u1e45gh\u0101disesa, (leading to suspension).\n4. The Aniyata dhamma, or doubtful cases.\n5. The minor offences in detail.\n\nIn general, the whole is to be recited, and the necessary enquiries to be made: but in case of danger from armies, thieves, demons, or other injurious things, the service may be shortened. The service is to be conducted by the senior priest, or by some competent person nominated by him in the General Meeting, who is not to be impeded in the performance of his duties by any of those present, upon pain of ecclesiastical censure. The precepts are to be recited in a clear and audible voice. If any priest have a charge to make against another, he is previously to intimate his intention to the person against whom the charge is to be brought: if this notice has not been given, the accusation is not to be heard. No groundless charge is to be made, under pain of censure; and if an unjust sentence has been passed by the Sa\u1e45gha against any person, it may be put aside if four or five members are of opinion that it should be disallowed: if only two or three members dissent, they may enter their protest: if only one, he may say, \"I do not agree,\" and thus record his dissent.\n\nThe senior priest is to command a junior to sweep the Up\u00f3satha hall, to arrange the seats, and, when necessary, to light the lamps. If the junior refuse, he is to be placed under censure.\n\nNo priest within the district is allowed to be absent without a sufficient reason being stated: if he be detained from the service by sickness, he is to make to another priest a declaration of his own purity, and of his assent to the meeting being held, (that is, that he is not acquainted with any reason why it should not be held): otherwise he\nis to be brought on his couch to the place of meeting. If he be placed under restraint by enemies, so as to be unable to attend, the S\u0101\u1e45gha is to depute a member to see him, and to receive his declaration of personal purity, and of his assent to the meeting being held.\n\nThe senior priests must be present before the Up\u00f3satha service is commenced.\n\nIf from any cause, a minority of the priests in the district commence the service, and afterwards a number larger than those present at the commencement should come in, the service is to be re-commenced; but if the members, who come last, be only equal to those who commenced the service, or fewer, the service is not to be recommenced, but only the declaration of personal purity to be received from those who came last.\n\nIt is necessary that five priests should be present to constitute a S\u0101\u1e45gha for ordinary purposes; but if only four be present, the Up\u00f3satha service may be attended to: if there be only two or three persons, they may state their own personal purity.\n\nIf any one has been guilty of a fault, he must go to a pure priest, and having removed his robe from one shoulder, kneel down before him, and with uplifted hands confess his fault: if he profess himself to be sorry for what he has done, and state his determination not to repeat the offence, he may be absolved. But this applies only to minor transgressions: absolution from the crimes called S\u0101\u1e45ghaddisesa, can only be granted by the S\u0101\u1e45gha.\n\nThe P\u0101timokkha, which is directed to be recited at every bi-monthly Up\u00f3satha meeting, contains the whole of the precepts recorded in the P\u0101r\u0101jika and Pachiti divisions of the Vinaya Pitaka, but without the reasons for their enactment, or the adjudged cases recorded in illustration of the law. The priests being assembled in the Up\u00f3satha hall,\nthe officiating priest commences the service, by enquiring if the room has been swept, the seats arranged, and water provided for drinking. He then proceeds to enquire, if there be any objection to the meeting being held, and whether it be the proper time for the recital of the P\u0101timokkha.\n\nAfter these preliminaries, he states, that with the permission of the Sa\u1e45gha, he will conduct the service, and that after each section of the P\u0101timokkha has been read, the question will be put thrice, \"Are all the members present free from the breach of any one of these precepts?\" If any one be guilty, he is to confess it; if he be free from guilt, he is to remain silent. They are reminded that this is an appeal to each person, and that to remain silent when they know themselves to be guilty, is a great crime. He then recites the four precepts contained in the P\u0101r\u0101jika section.\n\nThe P\u0101r\u0101jika Section.\n\n[The penalty attached to a breach of any one of these four precepts is permanent expulsion from the body.]\n\nI.\u2014A priest not having confessed his inability to obey the rules binding on the priesthood, and thus withdrawing himself from the community, who shall have carnal intercourse with any being, human, animal, or super-human, is P\u0101r\u0101jiko, and is expelled.\n\nII.\u2014Any priest, who, with a dishonest intention, shall appropriate to himself any property, (to the amount of one rupee or more,) which has not been given to him, is P\u0101r\u0101jiko, and is expelled.\n\nIII.\u2014A priest who is guilty of taking away human life, or is in any way accessory to that act, either by word or deed, is P\u0101r\u0101jiko, and is expelled.\n\nIV.\u2014A priest who shall falsely assume a high spiritual character, and the super-human power connected with that character, is P\u0101r\u0101jiko, and is expelled.\nThe Sa\u1e45gh\u0101disesa Section.\n\nI.\u2014He who wilfully pollutes himself, is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nII.\u2014A priest, who, with an impure intention, comes in personal contact with a woman, either by taking her hand, touching her head, or by touching any other part of her body, is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nIII.\u2014A priest, who, with a corrupt mind, holds libidinous discourse with a woman, is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nIV.\u2014A priest who endeavors to excite a woman to have criminal conversation with himself, is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nV.\u2014A priest who carries messages between the sexes, whether to promote marriage or concubinage, is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nVI.\u2014A priest who procures a residence to be built for himself, must not have the house larger than 12 cubits of Buddha's measure in length, and 7 cubits in breadth; he must have it consecrated by priests, must choose a place free from danger, and surrounded by an open path. He who neglects any of these things is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nVII.\u2014A priest who procures a Vih\u0101ra to be erected for his own residence, in conjunction with other priests, must assemble priests to consecrate the site, choose a place free from danger, and surrounded by an open path: otherwise he is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nVIII.\u2014A priest, who, with an evil intention, brings a groundless charge against another priest for the purpose, of having him expelled from the priesthood, is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nIX.\u2014A priest who shall avail himself of some circumstance foreign to the charge, to substantiate that which would lead to the expulsion of another priest, is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\nThis is thus illustrated: A priest violently hated two eminent members of the body, a male and a female, and brought a charge against them of incontinence. To substantiate this charge he procured two goats; to the male he gave the name of the priest to be accused, and to the female that of the priestess. Having seen the animals copulate, he stated that he had witnessed the act of criminal conversation between M. and N., giving the names of the priest and priestess.\n\nX.\u2014He who endeavors to stir up strife or promote schism among the priests, shall be thrice exhorted to abandon his efforts. If he listen to the exhortations, it will be well; but if he disregard them, he is guilty of Sanghadiseso.\n\nXI.\u2014If two or three priests shall become partisans of any other priest, and agree to affirm the correctness of whatever he may do or say, stating, \"He speaks and acts in accordance with our views: his declarations are consistent with truth and discipline, and we perfectly agree with him\"; they shall be thrice warned to abstain from such partisanship; but if they persist in their course of proceeding, they are guilty of Sanghadiseso.\n\nXII.\u2014If any priest be an evil speaker, and when he is reproved for any act contrary to the precepts, shall improperly say \"Hold no conversation with me either for good or bad: keep your observations to yourself and do not interfere with my concerns; I also will abstain from making remarks on your proceedings\"; and shall thus impede the harmony of the community; he shall be thrice exhorted not to continue in this state. If he submit to this counsel, it will be well: if not, he is guilty of Sanghadiseso.\n\nXIII.\u2014If any priest residing in the neighbourhood of a town or village, shall be a corrupter of public morals by his own improper practices: and if this conduct is seen or heard of by other priests, they shall state the facts to him and advise him to leave that neighbourhood.\nShould he reply, you are self-opiniated and partial in your judgments, endeavoring to terrify priests with your threats: they must reply, Speak not thus, your improper conduct is generally known; it is advisable that you should leave this place. Thrice they are thus to admonish him; if he obey the admonition it will be well; if not, he is guilty of Sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso.\n\nWhen any one is guilty of any of these crimes he is to be suspended, and placed under the supervision of the other priests for as many days as he concealed the crime, and for six days additional. When he is sufficiently humbled he may be restored to his former position as a priest, but this can only be done by a Sa\u1e45gha of twenty members.\n\nEnd of the thirteen Sa\u1e45gh\u0101disesa.\n\n(To be continued.)\nNOTES ON THE MYTHOLOGICAL LEGENDS OF THE SINHALESE.\n\nBY JAMES DE ALWIS, ESQ., ASSISTANT SECRETARY.\n\nThere is no reasonable doubt entertained at the present day, as to the belief that Asia was \"the country in which the worship of the deity became first corrupted by human inventions, and finally degenerated into a system of idolatry, where the adoration of the creature was substituted for that of the Creator.\"* There is abundant testimony to prove that both Greece and Rome obtained their religious worship from Asia.\n\nFrom the position which Ceylon occupies in a geographical point of view, it can hardly be doubted, that the systems of Mythology known to the Hind\u00fas, found an early and easy passport to Ceylon. However much the Indian system is opposed to the tenets of Buddhism,\u2020 the religion of Lanka; the Sinhalese poets have never, it seems, scrupled to adopt that which was used by their Hindu neighbours.\u2021\n\n* Tooke's Pantheon, Introduction, p. 9.\n\u2020 Ramayana Barata\u2014etuluvadedummuluyuta\u2014kimutbasnirata, &c. See note in my Sidath-Sangarawa, pp. xi, xii.\n\u2021 It is in accordance with such a feeling, that thoughtless native Protestants consider it not improper to take part in Buddhistical ceremonies, or that Buddhists themselves, under various circumstances, shew an attachment to the forms of Christian worship, believing it by no means inconsistent with their own faith, which inculcates all the virtues which ennoble the soul, besides reverence to parents, charity to the poor, humanity to animals, and love towards all mankind. The case, however, with Sinhalese Roman Catholics is different; and the difference is owing to the rigid requirements and ecclesiastical discipline of that Church. And it is a remarkable fact, that amongst the Sinhalese Roman Catholics there is no wavering of mind, no partnership faith (if I may so call it), and no hankering after the religion of their forefathers.\nIn the creed of the Buddhist some of the Hind\u00fa deities are, however, not regarded as the others are\u2014'mere creatures of fancy,' 'the metaphors of poetry,' and 'the personifications of nature.' Some are recognized in Buddhism as really existing beings, and to them the Buddhist makes offerings.* Of these we shall treat in due order.\n\nThe object of this Essay is a brief inquiry into the Sinhalese Mythology, as it may be gathered from our poets; and in that investigation it will be our endeavour slightly to compare the systems known to the East and West.\n\nThere are two sources from whence the Sighalese have obtained their Mythology:\u20141st, Their Religion or their bana, the Buddhist scriptures; and 2nd, Tradition, or that which is found in the works of Hind\u00fa writers.\n\nUnder the first head may be mentioned, not only the fabulous deviyo recognized in Buddhism, and to whom homage is paid by the votaries of Gautama; but also the fabulous system of the universe, and its gods and n\u00e1gas: and under the second head are comprehended the metaphors and allegories of poets, the personification of abstract notions, or symbolic representations of the powers or attributes of nature, the planetary system, and its influence on man.\n\nInnumerable are the worlds of the Universe. Each system or Sakwala, scattered throughout the infinity of space, has its own sun, moon, and stars. The earth with its visible sun and moon, and its heavens and hells, constitute the Magul-sakwala, which is surrounded by a rock called the Sakwala-gala. The earth has in its centre the Mahamera, around which are oceans, mountains, continents, lakes, islands, &c. The earth is 240,000 yojuns, or 3,840,000 miles, in solidity.\n\n* But some of them are not objects worthy of adoration. The \"P\u00faj\u00e1valiya\" compares the folly of those who 'listen to the teachings of Siva or Vishnu,' to the Brahman in the legend [see Hardy on Buddhism, p. 472.] who was deceived by the Jackal. \"They will be deceived likewise, and the object at which they aim will not be attained.\"\nIt rests on *Jala-polouva* or the world of waters, 7,680,000 miles in depth; and this is supported on *W\u00e1-polouva*, or world of air, 15,360 miles deep; and this again rests in a vacuum called *Ajat\u00e1k\u0101sa*.\n\n\"Thales,\" says a late writer, \"entertained the idea, that the earth floated on the ocean, whilst Democretes taught that it rested on the air like a bird with its wings outspread.\" The Buddhist doctrine is in accordance with these opinions. When Milindu, king of S\u00e1gal, said to N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, that he could not believe that the earth was supported by the world of water, and this by a world of air, the priest took a syringe and pointed out to him, that the water within the instrument was prevented from coming out by the exterior air; by which the king was convinced that the water under the earth might be supported by the *Ajat\u00e1k\u0101sa*. Professor Wilson, in his *Vishnu Pur\u00e1na*, says, \"The supreme being placed the earth on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the water.\"\n\nOne of our poets, in extolling the praises of Buddha to the skies, says, that \"the beams of his rays dived through *W\u00e1-polouva*, and thence proceeded to the end of the immensity of space, *Bawaga*,\u2014and thence spread themselves throughout the whole *Sukwala* or universe:\"\n\n*According to some of the Hind\u00fa legends, the earth rests upon the back of a tortoise. Thus, in the play entitled *Mal\u00e1ti* and *Madhava*:\n\n'Thy foot descending spurns the earthly globe,\nBeneath the weight the broad-backed tortoise reels.'\n\nHind\u00fa Plays, ii. p. 58\n\nAccording to another passage in the *Mudra Raksha*, the earth is supposed to rest on the heads of *S\u00e9sha*, a snake of innumerable heads.\n\n'A weary burden is the cumbrous earth\nOn S\u00e9sha's head, but still he bears the load.'\u2014ib. p. 185.\n\n\u2020 One of the causes of an earthquake, according to Buddha; see Bengal A. S. Journal, vii. p. 1,001.*\nThat which first demands our attention, as the theme of every poet, the personification of strength, firmness, and greatness, is the Maha-mera or Mount Meru,* the Olympus of the Greeks.\n\nThe Vishnu Purana and the Buddhist scriptures place it in the centre of Jambudwipa. It is represented like the Olympus, to reach the skies, and so high, that a stone, if let fall from its summit, would not reach the earth in four and a half months.\n\n\"A brazen anvil falling from the sky,\nThrough thrice three days would toss in airy whirl,\nNor touch the earth till the tenth sun arose.\"\n\nElton's \"Hesiod, Theng,\" 893.\n\nLike, too, the Olympus on which the Gods were assembled by Zeus, Mount Meru is the resorting place of the gods, the abode of Sakra, or the Indra of the Hind\u00fas.\n\nMaha-mera is of various colours: on the east, it is like silver; on the north-east virgin gold; on the south sapphire; on the south-east azure blue; on the west coral; on the south-west blue; on the north gold, and on the north-west bright gold. These colours are imparted to the adjacent rocks and oceans. Hence, the \"Milk-white-ocean,\" or Kiri-muhuda, which we shall hereafter notice under the second head.\n\nThis great mountain is alternately surrounded by seven oceans and rocks,\u2020 and probably it is these seven rocks\n\n* \"I had almost forgotten that Meros is said by the Greek to have been a mountain of India, on which their Dicynas was born, and that Meru, though it generally means the north pole of the Indian Geography, is also a mountain under the city of Naishada or Nysa, called by the Grecian Geographers Deognysipole, and universally celebrated in the Sanscrit poems.\"\u2014Sir William Jones's Works, vol. i. p. 264.\n\n\u2020 \"According to the geography of the Puranas,\" says Professor H. H. Wilson, in his Hindu Plays, ii. p. 58. \"the earth consists of a series of central circles and six other annular continents separated from each other by as many oceans of different fluid substances.\"\nwhich the Br\u00e1hmans regard as the seven insular continents, which are severally surrounded by oceans. It is said, that Priywritta drove his carriage seven times round the earth, and the seven seas are the seven ruts left by its wheels. The poet in alluding to the seven rocks, which are Yugandhara, Tsadhara, Karavika, Sudar\u015bana, N\u00e9mindhara, Winataka, and A\u015bwakarna, says:\n\nThe four continents are Uturukuru-divayina, Purvavidehaya, Aparagby\u00e1na, and Jambudv\u00edpa, of which the last is on the south of Meru, and has 500 islands. The first, on the north of the great Meru, is the happiest of the four. It is celebrated for the tree Kap-tura, which, like the horn of Amaltheia, given by Zeus to the daughter of Melissius, conferred whatever was desired by its possessors. The Kap-tura is, in its properties, the same as Sura-tura, 'the heavenly tree,' which gives whatever is desired by the gods. We may here, by the way, refer to the Situmini gem, and the S\u00farabi cow, the personifications of abundance and charity. The poet, in reference to these three, says:\n\nOn the north of Jambudv\u00edpa is the Him\u00e1la-wana, a great forest, in which are situated some of the mountains, famous in Hind\u00fa and Sinhalese poetry, and which are represented as the abodes of gods and devils. Him\u00e1la-wana is also famous for its lakes, among which is the Anbtatta v\u00edla, and 500 rivers: one of these, which, after taking a circuitous course, ascends into the sky, is called the Ahasga\u1e45ga, 'the Ganges of heaven,' supposed to trickle through\nthe tresses of Siva.* The following couplet of the poet, in allusion to this 'heavenly river,' is well known:\n\nKaviyas\u0113khara.\n\nThere are several other minute particulars connected with the foregoing account of the Universe; but as they can be easily learnt on reference to the books on the subject, we now turn our attention to\n\n1. \u0160akra or Jupiter, the personification of the firmament.\n\n'Aspice hoc sublime candens, quem invocant omnes Jovem.'\n\nHe is called by various names; \u0160akra is his most usual designation in the Sinhalese, whilst Indra is that commonly used by the Hind\u016bs. He is the ruler of the highest heaven,\n\n....... ......the great father of the gods above.\n\nVirgil.\n\nHence he is called Sura-rada or Sura-isura in Sinhalese: he is the patron of \"100 sacrificial offerings,\" and is thence called Siya-hutan: he has a diamond weapon in his hand called viduru or vajra\u2020: he,\n\n.................whose awful hand\nDisperses thunder on the seas and land,\nDispensing all with absolute command.\n\nVirgil.\n\nis therefore named Vidu-rata, or Vidu-ravi. He is called Pur\u0101ndura, from the fact related of him, that he divided his city with king Mah\u0101 Mandathu after the expulsion of the Asur\u0101s, who may be compared to the Titans and giants of the\n\n* 'May the tresses interwoven with a circular garland of serpents for flowers, where the waters of the Mandakini are flowing over the lower chaplet of skulls worn in the crest &c\"\u2014Hind\u016b Plays, ii. p. 9.\n\n\u2020 \"The diamond and thunderbolt according to Hind\u016b notions, are of one substance and are called by the same appellation, Vajra, as the fall of the thunderbolt is usually followed by rain, and may thus be considered as its cause. The propinquity and the mutual friction of the same substance upon the wrists of our young ladies, is in like manner supposed to occasion the dispersion of the fluid treasures of the cloud.\"\u2014Wilson's Megha D\u0101ta, note, p. 73. I may state it as a fact that the native Sinhalese of the fifth century regarded diamond as a non-conductor of lightning. It is so stated, in unmistakeable language, in the \"Mah\u0101wans\u0101\" and the Tika.\nGreeks, as they were much larger than any order of beings, and made war with the gods.* He has a wife named Madora or Sudda\u2014\n\nand is thence designated Madorapiya. He is Sak or Sakra, from his\u2014\"power divine in all things known.\" He is the Indra or Induradikpati, the regent of the East, whence he appears in the character of Jupiter Tonens. He is represented as having a thousand eyes; and he\n\nWhose all conscious eyes the world behold.\u2014Homer.\n\nis thence called Sahases. One of the versified works on synonyms, has the following lines embodying all the names above given:\u2014\n\nThus, in the words of Sir William Jones,\u2020 \"This Jupiter or Deispeter, is the Indian God of the visible heavens, called Indra or the king, and Divespeter, or Lord of the sky, who has also the character of the Roman Genius, or chief of the good spirits, but most of his epithets in Sanscrit are the same with those of the Eonian Jove.\" He had three principal consorts, one of whom is the Sudda, to whom we have already referred. The others are Sudumma and Nanda, of whom one of our bards sings:\u2014\n\nOne of Indra's courtesans, Ramb\u00e1, Sir William Jones identifies with \"the popular Venus, the goddess of beauty that was produced, according to the Indian fabulists, from the froth of the churned ocean.\"\n\nIndra's celestial city is called Amaravati; his palace,\n\n* It is generally agreed, that the Giants were personifications of the elements, and that their wars with the gods refer to the throes of the world in its state of chaos.\u2014Hardy, p. 47.\n\n\u2020 See his works, p. 248.\nVijay\u00f3\u2020; his park, Nandana\u2020; his chief elephant, Air\u00e1vana\u2021; his bow,\u00a7 \u201cthe rain-bow,\u201d and his charioteer, M\u00e1tali, who is made to say by one of our poets\u2014\u201cAsur\u00e1s are my foes, \u015aakra is my lord: know thou that I am M\u00e1tali, the charioteer\u201d:\n\nAlthough he is the Regent of the East; yet his Olympus is the Mahu Mera.\n\nHigh heav'n the footstool for his feet he makes,\nAnd, wide beneath him, all Olympus shakes.\u2014Homer.\n\nA Sinhalese poet briefly sums up Indra's attributes in the following lines, wherein he is made to say; \u201ca possessor of a thousand eyes, the chief of (both the worlds) heaven and earth, the Regent of the East, I am called by men \u015aakra, the supreme God.\u201d\n\nI shall briefly allude here to the character which this D\u00e9va holds in Buddhistical works. There he has few of the attributes which are described in the Pur\u00e1na, and is represented rather as a venerable personage, the friend of the faithful ministering to their wants and comforts, than as receiving their homage, or as the object of their prayers. It is said of \u015aakra, that he was a frequent hearer of Buddha's bana, that he thereby obtained merit, and prolonged his own existence. He is however characterized in several books, as being exceedingly jealous of pious men, lest they may, after migrating from their present existence, supersede him in his kingly\n\n---\n\n\u2020 \u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928\u093e\u2014Nandana.\n\u2021 \u0906\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0923\u2014Air\u00e1vana.\n\u00a7 \u201cIn Indra's bow, o'er yonder hillock play.\u201d\u2014M\u00e9gha D\u00fata.\nThus, according to Hind\u00fa writers, when he saw that Nara and Nar\u00e1yana had devoted themselves to ascetic exercises, he was greatly alarmed, and sent K\u00e1ma 'love,' and Vasanta 'spring,' with the nymphs of heaven, to inflame the sages with passion, and thus end their penance. He however failed in his attempts; for Nar\u00e1yana, inviting the tempters with much civility, created out of a flower-stalk placed on his thigh, a nymph, the superiority of whose charms covered the Apsar\u00e1sas of heaven with shame, and induced them to return to Indra, with the newly-created goddess as a present.\u2020 Numerous instances of this jealousy and treachery towards men, are also related in the Buddhistical annals. In the legend of L\u00f3masa K\u00e1syapa, \u015aakra is represented in the character of the devil, tempting the Rishi to commit a forbidden sin, from which he was only deterred by the power of a miracle. But, where he apprehended no danger to himself from the superior merits of others, he appears as their guardian, benefactor, and friend. Numerous also are the instances in which he is said to have helped Gautama, (when Bodhisat) out of difficulty and misfortune. Thus, when Gautama was a squirrel, and lost his young ones, \u015aakra caused them to be found; when Vessuntara, he prevented the king's being deprived of his \"help-mate,\" and nourished his children on the top of a tree; when Gutt\u00edla, he taught the minstrel to defeat his ungrateful pupil; when Gautama became Buddha, and overcame M\u0101ra, he shouted forth his hallelujahs throughout the universe. In his last moments the \"M\u00e1hav\u00e1nya\" relates, Buddha placed Lanka under the protection of \u015aakra: (see \"Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nya\" p. 47;) and when Gautama died, \u015aakra sang a hymn, consoling himself under the reflection, that \"All living beings relinquish their existence in this world, and that in like manner the Teacher of the world, the incomparable, the being of felicitious advent and of power, the supreme Buddha also dies!\"\n\n* See Pr. Monier William's Sakuntala, p. 7, notes.\n\u2020 Hind\u00fa Plays, by Pr. H. H. Wilson.\n2. The Deity of Brahmanical faith, the divine cause, and essence of the world, from which all creatures emanate, is Br\u00e1hma.* He is represented as being 192 miles high, his feet as 30 miles long, and his robes 256 miles. He is looked upon by the Hind\u00fas as the creator of man, a doctrine opposed to the tenets of Buddhism, by which the chief \"first cause,\" that of which even a savage has some conception, is ignored. \"The beings who were created by Brahma,\" says Professor Wilson in his Vishnu Purana, \"of the four castes, were at first endowed with righteousness and perfect faith; they abode wherever they pleased, unchecked by any impediment, their hearts were free from guile, they were pure, made free from evil by observance of sound institutes. In their sanctified minds Hari dwelt, and they were filled with perfect wisdom, by which they contemplated the glory of Vishnu.\"\n\nAccording to Buddha, Br\u00e1hma is a believer in his tenets. He is said to be the Deva who received into his arms the infant Siddharta on his birth, and breathed the consolatory words in the ear of his mother:\u2014\"Rejoice, for the son thou hast brought forth will be the support of the world.\" We will not here pause to consider him as the adorer of Buddha, by whom he stood firmly when attacked by M\u00e1ra; to whom he made the first offering; and from whom he first heard the bana. Suffice it to remark, that the Sinhalese Poets take him in the light in which he is regarded by the Hind\u00fas\u2014the personification of Purity, Sanctity and Wisdom.\n\n\"O virtuous B\u00f3dhisat! thou art the very Br\u00e1hma in purity (and sanctity); in brightness and loveliness; in loneliness of life; in infinite learning; and great wisdom;\u2014the theme of the Rishis.\"\n\n* In Csoma K\u00f3r\u00f3si's Analysis of the Tibetan annals, the following passage occurs, the genuineness of which is doubted by many Buddhists in Ceylon: \"Shakya asks several questions of Brahma, whether was it he who caused the several revolutions in the destruction and regeneration of the world. At last he himself asks Shakya, how the world was made,\u2014by whom? Here are attributed all changes in the world, to the moral works of the animal beings, and it is stated, that in the world all is illusion: there is no reality in the things: all is empty.\"\u2014Asiatic Researches, xx. p. 434.\nIt is in regard to these attributes, with the arrogance of an Ovid, when he said,\n\nJamque opus exigi; quod nec Jovis ira, nec ignis\nNec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas;\n\nthe author of the \"Kavyas\u00e9khara,\" speaks of himself in the following strain:\n\n'Like a Brahspati on earth renown'd,\nThe limits of each science fully found,\nRadiant with heaven-derived religion's beams.\nOn learning's head a living gem he streams.'\n\nHe is represented as holding \"an umbrella in hand, and hence his name, Sat-ata. He is called Baram or Bamba, from his acknowledged greatness; Vidi from his being the author of destination; Siwu-wat from his having four faces; L\u00f3-ejara from his being the teacher of the world; Piyum-yon, from his having been produced out of a lotus; Ven-pu, from his being the son of Vishnu; Ata-kara, from his having eight arms; Sarasawiya-kal, from being the husband of Saraswati; Piyum-\u00e1sana from his having a lotus for his seat; V\u00e9-guru, from being the teacher of the Vedas; Ran-geba, from his golden lustre; Ata-net, from his having eight eyes; Sura-deyu from being the ancestor of the Gods; and L\u00f3-isuru, the chief of the world. The above names are collected by one of our poets in the following couplets:\n\nWe have already seen, that the Asuras were inimical to Sakra, whence they were called Dew-rupu or Sura-saturu. This is in consequence of their expulsion from Tawtisa, one of Indra's heavens, to the foot of Maha-mera, where they now reside. Fearful of a repetition of their attacks, the four\n\n* See my Sidat Sangarawa, p. exci.\n\u2020 \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dda \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0db0\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dba.\u2014Kavyas\u00e9khara.\nguardian Devas or Hatara-viram-deviyo,\u2020 are appointed to superintend the four quarters of that mountain. The Rev. S. Hardy has the following observations on this head:\n\n\"The four guardian dewas, Dhritardshtra, Virudha, Virupaksha, and Waisravana have palaces on the summit of Yugandhara rocks. The palace of Dhritardshtra is on the east. His attendants are the Gandharvas, a kela laksha in number, who have white garments, adorned with white ornaments, hold a sword and shield of crystal, and are mounted on white horses. The Deva is arrayed and mounted in a similar manner, and shining like a kela laksha of silver lamps, keeps guard over the possessions of Sakra in the eastern division of the Sakwala. The palace of Virudha is on the south. His attendants are the Kumbhandhas, a kela laksha in number, who have blue garments, hold a sword and shield of sapphire, and are mounted on blue horses. The Deva is arrayed and mounted in a similar manner, and shining like a kela laksha of lamps composed of gems, keeps guard over the southern division of the Sakwala. The palace of Virupaksha is on the west; his attendants are the Nagas, a kela laksha in number, who have red garments, hold a sword and shield of coral, and are mounted on red horses. The Deva is arrayed and mounted in a similar manner, and shining like a kela laksha of torches, keeps guard over the western division of the Sakwala. The palace of Waisravana is on the north; his attendants are the Yakku, a kela laksha in number, who have garments adorned with gold, and are mounted on horses shining like gold. The Deva is arrayed and mounted in a similar manner, and shining like a kela laksha of golden lamps, keeps guard over the northern division of the Sakwala.\"\n\nThe Lokapalas, who are sometimes confounded with the guardians of the cardinal points, may be here mentioned. They are represented as divinities appointed by Brahma to act as rulers over different created things. They are amongst others the following:\u2014Indra, sovereign guardian of the earth, and the regions below and above the earth; Soma of\nsacrifices; Varuna, of the waters; Vayu, of the unembodied element; Vaishravana, of demons and rakshas; Parjanya, of oceans, clouds, rivers; Nandi, of quadrupeds; Superna, of birds of prey; Garuda, of the winged race, &c., &c. Each city, grove, and house has a presiding deity; and thus in the \"Sajalihini Sandesa,\" the poet reminds us of the \"household god,\" by adoring whom the Sarika was to proceed on his errand:\n\nThe city too (Kelaniya), into which the poet sent his message, is said to be the seat of Vibhishana. It is in accordance with this notion, that the Singhalese are very reluctant to pull down an old house; or even\n\n...........an ancient tree, whose branches wear\nThe marks of village reverence and care:\u2014\n\nMegha Duta.\n\nand which is generally supposed to be the abode of devos. This notion of household-gods, is entirely derived from the Hind\u00fas, according to whom \"every city,\" says Prof. Wilson, \"has its own Sri, its own fortune or prosperity, which in former times seems to have been represented by an image with a temple of its own. The practice amongst the ancients of considering a city under the protection of some well-known divinity is more familiar to us, but an analogous superstition with that of the Hind\u00fas also prevailed amongst the polytheists of Europe.\"\n\nThus in \"The Seven against Thebes;\" the Theban women seek their shrines of the gods, who are the guardians of the city. The poet in the \"Milati and Madava\" says;\n\n...........Till they come,\nObedient to the holy dame's injunctions,\nThe matrons of her father's household send,\nThe maiden to the temple of the deity\nThat guards our walls, to pray that naught molest,\nNo evil interrupt the happy rite \u2014\n\nHindu Plays, II. p.p. 64-5.\n3. The chief of all the infernal deities, the Summanas or Pluto of the west, has, in one point of view, much resemblance to our Yama, as exercising a sovereignty over the dead, and as being the king of Hell; whilst in another, as the chief of the infernal deities, he is identical with our Vesamuni, or the Indian Kuvera. The poet embodies his various names in the following verses:\n\n\\[\n\\text{He is the lord of wealth, and is thence named Danindu or Danada, a name which has some resemblance to Pluto's Latin designation, Dis, signifying \"wealth.\" He is represented as extremely deformed, as indeed his Grecian parallel is described \"blind and lame;\" and hence he is called ku, \"vile\" and vera, \"body\"\u2014Kuvera. From the circumstance of one of his cities being called Visana, he is named Vesamuni, although some suppose that it means \"Son of Visa.\" He is called Yak-rada, that is, Summanas, or chief of all the Yukhos, or the infernal deities of the Greeks.}\n\\]\n\nIn the Vana Parva of the \"Mahabharata,\" it is stated that Kuvera, the son of Pulastya, by his attentions to his grandfather Brahma, was made immortal, and appointed the god of wealth; that his capital was Lanka or Ceylon; and that his attendants were demons. It is doubtless his tale which induced the ancient historians of this island to regard its inhabitants before the arrival of Vijaya as \"supernatural\" \"non-human\" beings or \"demons.\" But I am reminded by my pandit, that this notion of \"demonic inhabitants,\" whom Vijaya found on his arrival in Ceylon, may be also traced to the fact that Ravana the ancient king of Ceylon is mentioned in the Uttara Ramayana and Padma Purana as the progenitor of the\nR\u0101k\u1e63u, or a distinguished member of a demoniac race. As a deity in whose hands are the destinies of mankind, he receives the appellation Siri-d\u0101, \"the promoter of prosperity.\" Unlike other deities, who are represented as being seated on brute-beasts, Kuv\u0113ra is said to ride on a human being, a circumstance by which he receives the name of N\u0101rdyana. He is attended by Kinnaras, the musicians of Heaven, and is thence called Ki\u1e47\u1e0duri\u1e47\u1e0du. He is esteemed very powerful, and is thence called Rajaraja, \"the king of kings.\" Like the Roman Dis, of whom it is said by Cicero, that he is so called, because \"all the natural powers and faculties of the earth are under his direction,\" Kuv\u0113ra is the Master of the inestimable treasures of the earth, and more especially of the nine gems, (of which we shall speak hereafter,)\u2014and is therefore called Ni\u1e47du 'chief of treasures.'\n\nS\u016blalihini-Sand\u0113saya.\n\nHe is the Regent of the North, and is thence called Uturu-n\u0101. Mount Kail\u0101sha is his abode jointly with Sir\u0101, who is said to be Kuv\u0113ra's friend\u2014thence the appellation Rudu-saha. But \u00c1laka is his principal city, which is therefore received by our bards as the centre of all those regions which teem with wealth:\n\nParavi Sand\u0113saya\n\nThe nine Nidhi or 'treasures' are enumerated in the following stanza given in several Sanscrit works:\u2014\n\nThey are translated by Professor Wilson to be the \"lotus,\" \"large lotus,\" \"shell\" or \"conch,\" \"fish,\" \"tortoise,\" \"crest,\" \"a mathematical figure used by the Jains,\" nida \"colour\" and \"dwarf.\" But, evidently gems are meant: and I may here give Mr. Kindersley's translation of the passage, through the\nmedium of the Tamil; viz., the coral, pearl, cat's-eye, emerald, diamond, sapphire, ruby, and topaz. The ninth is left undetermined. It is nila which probably means the nil-anami of the Tamils or the nil-keta of the Sinhalese, which is commonly called \"the blue sapphire,\" and esteemed of great value. And I may here advert to the fact that the blue sapphire is sometimes formed of the Ceylon ruby, which may be seen in various stages of formation, exhibiting the shades which are produced by a mixture of the lake and blue.\n\n4. The D\u00e9va who has not his parallel amongst the Grecian and Roman gods, the most inimical to Buddhas, is said to be Mara, the ruler of six heavens. No intelligible reason is, however, given for his antagonism to Buddhism, but \"the fear by his discourses many beings would obtain the blessedness of the Br\u00e1hma l\u00f3kas, and the privilege of nirw\u00e1na, which would prevent the repeopling of the inferior world in which he reigned, when the Devos then inhabiting it had fulfilled their period of existence.\"* Though acknowledged to be a being of mighty powers, he is nevertheless represented, owing to this opposition, as a D\u00e9va full of \"cunning.\" In the life of Buddha given by Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si, he is called \"the devil,\" and is described as being extremely envious, and as reflecting thus: \"Should he become Buddha all animal beings instructed by him, will grow judicious and wise, and then they will not obey my commands or order.\" This hate of his towards Buddha, seems to resemble that of Satan; and his temptations the assaults of the Devil. For, when Siddharta left home to become Buddha, M\u00e1re, the \"agent of Sin,\" instantly appeared, saying, \"let me stop the great mortal,\" and rising aloft into the air, thus addressed him: 'Mahau\u015bro, depart not: on the seventh day from hence, the heavenly Chakkaratanan will most certainly come to pass. Then thou shalt exercise sovereignty\u2020\n\n* Spence Hardy \"Manual of Buddhism,\" p. 171.\n\u2020 \"The devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and\nover the four great quarters of the earth, together with their 2000 isles: Blessed, wait.\" The great mortal asked 'Who art thou?' 'I am Vasavatto.' \"I am aware that both empire and universal dominion are proffered to me: I am however not destined for royalty: depart M\u00e1ra; approach not thus.\"* When Gautama became Buddha, M\u00e1ra brought an army equipped with swords, axes, javelins, bows, arrows, spikes, clubs, &c., to wage war against the great sage. The army is described to have been so great in number, that it well nigh overpoised the earth. The soldiers assumed many terrific forms of wild animals, demons and spirits; and continued rushing towards the spot where Buddha sat under the B\u00f3 tree. Apparitions of ill omen descended in various forms, proclaimed the advent of M\u00e1ra. Thousands of appalling meteors descended from heaven. The earth quaked; and there was darkness throughout the world. Indra, Br\u00e1hma, and a host of other celestials who were in attendance upon Buddha fled at the appearance of M\u00e1ra, who came mounted upon his charger, the Elephant called Girim\u00e9khula. The great sage was thus left alone; and the assault commenced. Crashing storms of fire, brimstone, and weapons came down; but they hurt not one hair of Gautama. A hundred thousand volcanos were hurled at him; but they assumed the form of garlands on their approach to Buddha. Every other imaginable devise was likewise ineffectual; and M\u00e1ra fled with shame. His enmity did not cease here. When Buddha announced his approaching dissolution, M\u00e1ra imperceptibly exerted his influence over the mind of Ananda, and prevented him from comprehending this exposition, though repeated twice.\u2020\n\nshoweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee &c.\" Matt. iv. 8, 9.\n\n* Turnour's version of the \"Buddhavansa\" (Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal vii p. 30.)\n\n\u2020 This interference prevented Ananda from entreating the sage to prolong his existence which he had the power of doing even for a whole kalpa if he was duly requested thereto.\u2014Turnour, loc. cit. p. 1601.\nSixty two artifices, of which M\u00e1ra was guilty, are spoken of by the votaries of Gautama; and it is generally believed by them, that he was the founder of all the systems of religions on earth, except Buddhism; and that he sent our blessed Lord Jesus Christ into the world to set aside Buddhism, which was at the time captivating the minds, and winning the affections of thousands in the East. In a little work* extant among the Sighalese, the following passages occur in reference to the belief above referred to:\n\n* This appears to be a fragment of a larger work, entitled the 'Histories of Milindu and Krist\u00e1 (Christ). There is no mention whatever of the person by whom it was written. It contains, among other matters, a narrative of the circumstances attending the birth and crucifixion of 'Christ' of Nazareth. It combines a life of our Saviour, with a few particulars connected with the controversial dialectics of Milindu and N\u00e1gas\u00e9na. The writer does not (as he would, if it were a fabrication give it a show of inspired authenticity, by stating it to be the production of a Rahat; but merely says, that the two stories (whether a tradition handed down, or a written work, it is not clear), were brought down by certain Buddhist priests, who arrived on a religious mission on this Island, during the reign of Vilaqam Bahu, which was, according to \"Mah\u00e1vansa,\" A.D., 519: when indeed, we find from the \"Mah\u00e1vapsa,\" a body of priests were assembled, for the first time in the island, to commit to writing the oral traditions concerning the national religion of Lank\u00e1. (See \"Mah\u00e1vansa,\" p. 207.) The countries too from which the priests came are mentioned, and they are those which frequently occur in other Buddhistical works\u2014\"Aramana, Malawa, Ghand\u00e1ra, Pygoa, Talalup, Rakkadu, and Sagal.\" The birth of Christ is stated to be in the time of N\u00e1gas\u00e9na 485 A.B. This, it is important to observe, is at variance with the date for the same event assigned in other Buddhistical works. [The \"Mah\u00e1vapsa,\" says that Buddha had predicted the birth of this sage 500 years after his death. In the Tibetan annals (see Asiatic Researches, xx. p. 400) the same prediction is recorded and that N\u00e1gajuna would appear 400 years A.B. The Raja Tarangini shows that this celebrated personage visited Kashmir about 460 A.B. See Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, v. p. 536.] These discrepancies which unsettle the date given in the \"Mah\u00e1vapsa,\" a book which is considered as sacred as any of the Buddhistical Scriptures, are invested with much importance in a historical point of view, shewing clearly the correctness of Turnour's belief that the Buddhistical era was antedated by Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma, or the early historians to whom he was indebted, to the extent of 60 or 65 years. They also intimate, consequently, a strong circumstance in favor of the genuineness of the work here noticed. But it must be borne in mind that this history bears date 2305 A.B. (which is 1762 A.D.) after the Dutch had introduced Christianity amongst the Sighalese, and long after the Portuguese had made the natives acquainted with the history of Jesus Christ. From the language too, in which it is written (and which contains amongst other words the Portuguese word \"k\u00e1nu\" instead of the Sighalese \"nesun\" for \"ditch\"), this appears beyond all manner of doubt to be what it does not disguise to represent\u2014the production of a modern date. Whether, therefore, it is an invention of the Buddhists, a\n\"And when Wasawarti M\u0101ra saw that king Milindu had thus set aside his two and sixty artifices, and his established moral and ceremonial customs, he reflected thus: 'King Milindu\n\nfabrication of the Buddhist priesthood, to bring contempt on our holy Religion is a matter well worthy the attention and investigation of Oriental Scholars to whom, and to the Asiatic Society in particular, I am prepared to submit an English translation in MS. of this little work. Opposed, however to such a supposition is the undeniable and well-known fact, that Buddhists look upon Christianity without jealousy,\u2014nay more, that there is a disposition on their part to conform to Christianity along with Buddhism. The Rev. D. J. Gogerly says, in a paper printed in Sir E. Tennent's work on Christianity in Ceylon, p. 240:\u2014\"I have seen it stated in a controversial Tract written by a Buddhist priest of Matura, not fifteen years since, that probably Christ in a former state of existence was a God, residing in one of the six heavens (a position which they represented Gautama as having occupied immediately previous to his birth, as Buddha); that animated by benevolence he desired and obtained a birth as man, and thought truth so far as he was acquainted with it.\" Nor is this a creature of modern and enlightened times. So far back as the age of the great Asoka, the liberal monarch of Asia, we find that far from any hostility being shewn to other religions, Buddhists actually honored them. Thus, in one of the Inscriptions of that Buddhist sovereign we find it declared (See Max M\u00fcller's Buddhism and Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 23,) that \"there are circumstances where the religion of others ought to be honored. And in acting thus, a man fortifies his own faith, and assists the faith of others. He who acts otherwise, diminishes his own faith and hurts the faith of others.\" See also Huc's Tartary, Thibet and China, p. 210.\n\nThe following concluding passage, contains important data for the elucidation of Ceylonese and Indian history. \"This is the history of the Tirtaka. ** He is called by the Tamils Nasarim (Nazarine); by the Sinhalese Tirtaka, ** a religious Teacher; and by others Kista (Christ). He was born 485 years after the death of Buddha, the teacher of the three worlds. King Milindu entered upon his dialectic controversies in 490 A.D. Those controversies lasted nine months and nine days: at the termination of which the king became a convert to Buddhism, entertained Nagasena, and 80,000 priests for 12 years. In 513 A.D. the Carpenter's Son was killed and buried. At this time by reason of an innocent Brahman female having been killed, there was a famine for 12 years. [This event, as detailed in the Rasawhini, a Pali historical record, serves to confirm the dates here given.] During this period Valagam Bahu reigned at Anur\u0101dhapura in Lank\u0101 and erected 99 monuments and edifices. Two years and four months before the famine, which is called the Beminis\u012b s\u0101ya, two Priests from Lank\u0101 went to worship the great Bo, and visited the various places in the five and thirty cities in which Buddha had dwelt. During this pilgrimage was the famine, called Beminis\u012b s\u0101ya. They next proceeded to Sagal, and there were 80,000 Priests in the four Temples of that city.\n\nThey having heard the renown of Lank\u0101 in respect of the Buddhist religion established in it, were highly delighted and expressed their gratulations. The two priests who went over were kindly treated by them. After the expiration of the 12 years, during which the famine had lasted, a body of Priests came to Ceylon on a religious mission from the countries of Mallawa, Gandara, Aramana, Pygma, Pelalup, Rakkada, and Sagal. They rendered much service to the religion of Buddha, by elucidating his doctrine, and by the compilation of books concerning his dharma. At that time these two histories, viz., one relating to Milindu, and the other regarding the Tirtaka of a Carpenter's Son, were brought...\"\nhas locked up the four hells which exist for my spiritual support, and has also set aside my two and sixty hidden (unrevealed) devices, (artifices); and summoned before him a son (a being) of Vasavarti, and said unto him, 'You were first defeated by doctrinal disputations with Milindu, the son (a deva) of Nirm\u00e1naratiya heaven, and other heavenly beings were likewise defeated by him. He has subjugated all the six heavens. He also entered into a controversy with a deva of Yama. Him also he has defeated. Since then N\u00e1gas\u00e9na has vanquished the six heavens by defeating Milindu. By reason of our having originated the disputation, he is incensed against me; and with a view to destroy my sixty-two devices, he has departed to the human world, where he is born by the name of Milindu. He now reigns in the city of Sagal, as the supreme monarch over a hundred kings of Dambadiva. Since therefore you were first defeating by him in controversial disputations, go and be born in the midst of the city of Sagal, and in the womb of a female of the low Carpenter's caste. And when you shall have grown up, be you Monarch over the whole of Dambadiva. Snatch away the sceptre of Milindu's kingdom. Open the gates of the four hells, which exist for the support of my existence; and uphold and protect my two and sixty secret devices, which shall last for ever and ever. (lit: during the entire kalpa.)' Upon this injunction of Vasavarti M\u00e1ra, the M\u00e1ra-son came down from the heaven called Paranermita-vasavarti, and at midnight was conceived in the womb of a female of the Carpenter's caste in the city of Sagal.\"\n\ndown by the aforesaid two priests on their return to Lank\u00e1. It is now (the date of the writing) 2305 years after the time of the great Buddha.\"\n\n\u2022 A similar story is given in the \"Milindappansana,\" as to the birth of N\u00e1gas\u00e9na. \"At the intercession of Assagutta Terunn\u00e1s\u00e9, on behalf of the Buddhist priesthood generally, Indra, the supreme of the Devos, invoked N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, who was in the Ketumati heaven, and called Maha-asa, to be born in the human world, for the purpose of confuting Milindu, to which N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, after much hesitation, consented. Accordingly he was conceived in the womb of the wife of Sonutra, a Brahman, and an inhabitant of Kajangala, on the borders of the Himanta mountains.\"\u2014Milindappansana.\nM\u00e1ra is called K\u00e1ma d\u00e9va, or \"god of pleasure,\" by Kosma K\u00f6r\u00f6si in his Tibetan Annals. We are unable to find the authority for this in any of the works on Buddhism extant in Ceylon; but it is a fact most of the names given to the Sinhalese Cupid, or K\u00e1ma d\u00e9va, are also given to M\u00e1ra, which name signifies \"death,\" or \"destroyer.\" It also is remarkable that M\u00e1ra's three daughters, who were dispatched to tempt Gautama, are called Rang\u00fa, \"dance,\" Tanh\u00fa, \"love,\" and Rati, \"sensuality\": the last name being also given, according to the Hind\u00fa Fabulists, to the consort of the Indian Cupid, whence he is called Riyahimi. Since he is identified with M\u00e1ra, commonly surnamed Vasavarti, from the appellation given to the heaven of which he is an inhabitant, it may be convenient to notice here a few particulars regarding K\u00e1ma D\u00e9va.\n\nHe is represented as Ananga, or \"bodiless.\" This is either metaphorical as to his influence on the mind, or with reference to the legend of his having been reduced to ashes by the anger of Siva, when pierced by K\u00e1ma's arrows, and thus inspired with love for Parvati.* Referring to the last mentioned circumstance, he is called Muru, \"destroyer;\" Mul-anga, \"dead body;\" Vasam-sera, \"unequal body;\" and Un-aga, \"deficient body.\" Regarding him as a creature of the mind, he is Mana-yon, \u2020 \"mind-born;\" or Naraka, \"human body.\" He is the embodied form of the god of gods, whence he is called Tunu-hiru, \"body of sun's splendour.\" He is the agitator of the hearts of Br\u00e1hma, Vishnu, Siva, and Indra, and is thence called Samara, \"the warrior.\" He inflames the minds of men for sensual pleasures, and is therefore called Mada, or 'intoxication': in reference to which K\u00e1lidasa in the following beautiful lines in his Sakuntala; sings:\n\n* Hind\u00fa Plays. ii. p. 21. Also see Prof. Monier Williams' Sakuntala, p. 101.\n\u2020 Having offered adoration to the mind-born divinity, let the wife worship her husband with ornaments, flowers and raiment, thinking internally with entire complacency 'This is the God of love.'\u2014The Puranas.\n\"Verily even now the fire of Siva's wrath burns in this like the submarine fire in the ocean: otherwise how couldst thou, O agitator of the soul! with nothing left but ashes, be so scorching towards such as me?\"\n\nAnanga is represented, like his Grecian parallel Eros, with a bow and arrow. The description of these weapons in our books is truly beautiful: the bow is a sugar-cane, (whence the appellation of Siya-sew, or a \"creeper-bow,\" sweet in its taste, and lovely in its appearance; the bow-string is made of a line of bees, those lovely denizens of the forest, who sip the liquid sweets of flowers; and the arrows are five in number (pan-sera), each tipped with a flower. Hence the name Mala-viya or Kusum-dunu, \"flowery bow,\" which the poet describes in the following lines:\n\nThe five species of flowers here described are: the white dazzling Jasmine, the matchless Asoka,* the unspotted Idda, the far-famed Maha-nel (Lotus. Nelumbium speciosum), and the odorous Mango.\u2020 They are also given in the following passage in the paraphrase to the Amara Kosha:\u2014\n\nand are different from those enumerated by a Sinhalese poet in the following line:\u2014\n\nwhich are the Jasmine, Idda, Kina, Domba, and Bolidda.\n\n* This is the Jonesia Asoka, which is represented as producing a very lovely flower, and it is supposed that the contact of the stem of the Asoka tree with the foot of a woman of superior beauty, makes it blossom.\n\n\u2020 It is believed, (and I here speak upon the authority of Mr. W Ferguson), that the tree which produced the balm of Gilead in the Scriptures, Bdeliium, Myrrh and Incense or Frankincense, are the produce of the same natural order of plants to which our Mango belongs.\nSir William Jones differently describes them in the following beautiful lines, giving a description of the mal-sera or \"flowery darts\" of Cupid.\n\n\"He bends the luscious cane and twists the string,\nWith bees how sweet, but ah! how keen their sting.\nHe with five flow'rets tips the ruthless darts,\nWhich through five senses pierce enraptur'd hearts:\nStrong Champa, rich in odorous gold,\nWarm Acra nursed in heav'nly mould;\nDry Nagaser in silver smiling;\nHot Criticum our sense beguiling,\nAnd last to kindle fierce the scorching flame,\nLove shaft, which gods bright Bela name.\"\n\nThe Eastern Cupid bears upon his banner the Makara, an aquatic monster like a fish; and in the Makara-dvaja,\u2020 Dissanayaka describes him as a \"fierce warrior, approaching to battle.\"\n\n* Mounted on the elephant of darkness\u2014holding the umbrella of Autumn, hoisting the banner of Makara,\u2021 enjoying the music of the bellowing seas; playing the lute (chank) which produces the kokila's (cuckoo's) notes, and holding the sugar-cane bow with lotus darts.*\n\nAccording to one of the Puranas, the worship of Kama was instituted by Siva, in pity of the fate to which he had\n\n---\n\n* \"In the Romaunt of the Rose there is something of a similar allegory; Cupid is armed with 'ten brade arrows,' of which 'five were shaven well and dight,' and of a nature to produce virtuous attachment; while the other five 'also black as fiend in hell' were Pride, villainy, &c., and of pernicious properties.\" \u2014 Wilson's Megha Duta.\n\nSee various descriptions of 'the five flowers,' in Professor Williams' Sakuntala, note at p. 100.\n\n\u2020 Literally \"Fish-banner,\" the name of a poem.\n\n\u2021 Although the name signifies a 'fish' and its representation in the Indian Zodiac has a resemblance to the Pisces of the western Astronomers; yet I cannot help thinking that this is the crocodile of Egyptian worship. The Makara torn over porches in Buddhistical temples clearly prove this to be a crocodile. Professor Wilson describes the animal as \"monster,\" which doubtless it is, judging from the representations given of it in Buddhistical Temples.\nconsigned him. This is represented to take place in a grove of Asoka trees, where K\u00e1ma incurred the wrath of the three-eyed god. Although Europeans have frequently dwelt upon the want of affection in the matrimonial relations amongst Asiatics, it is nevertheless a fact, that they are much attached to their wives, who reciprocate the feelings of love to an extent even unknown in the fictions of the west. Various passages may be cited from the books illustrating this position; but one will suffice from a Hind\u00fa poet, who thus feelingly describes the lament of Uma, when K\u00e1ma was blasted by the lightning of Siva's scorching eye:\u2014\"She swoons\"; but\n\nToo soon her gentle soul returned to know\nThe pangs of widowhood,\u2014that word of woe!\n'Speak to me K\u00e1ma'! why so silent? give\nOne word in answer,\u2014doth my K\u00e1ma live?\nThere on the turf his dumb cold ashes lay\u2014\nThat fiery flash has scorched the soul away...\nSure woman's heart is strong, for can it be\nThat I still live while this is all of thee?'\n\nA remarkable passage occurs in the Buddhava\u1e47sa, in which three of the divinities to whom we have already alluded, are compared to Gautama, upon his first appearance in public, after attaining the position of the Great Teacher. I extract it entire:\n\n\"Among themselves these people kept saying one to another, 'Friend who is this? can it be the full moon descended among us out of dread of R\u0101hu, concealing the rays with which he is endowed? such a one was never seen before.' Smiling at his suggestion, another said, 'This is the god of love with his floral banner; dignified in person he has come to revel among us, having observed the great personal beauty of our monarch and of our fellow-citizens.' Laughing at him, another said, 'Friend, art thou mad? the god of love has half of his body destroyed by the fire kindled by the jealousy of Issa (Siva), it is not he, it is the chief of the d\u00e9va, the thousand-eyed deity (Indra) who has come here, imagining that this is the celestial city.' Another again, playfully ridiculing him, said, 'Friend, what nonsense art thou talking! where are his thousand...\"\neyes? where is his thunderbolt, and where is his elephant Irawana?\nAssuredly he is Brahma, who, having witnessed the indolence of the\nBrahmans, has come hither to teach the Vedas, and their accompaniments.'\nAnother ridiculing all others said 'He is neither the moon, the god\nof love, nor the thousand-eyed deity, nor yet Brahma. He is the\nwonderful personage\u2014the supreme\u2014the teacher of the world.'\n\n5. One of the Triad of Hind\u00fa adoration, and a deva who\nfigures most conspicuously in the ancient annals of Ceylon, is,\nMAHA DEV\u00c1, commonly called S\u00edva. He has for his seat\nMount Kailasha, every splinter of which is represented as an\ninestimable gem. Hence the appellation of Keles nivas. His\nterrestrial haunts are said to be the Him\u00e1laya region, or that\nportion of it which is known as the mountain of the moon.\nHe is called Ti-net, because he has \"three eyes:\" one of which\nis placed in the centre of the forehead. The Sanscrit form\nof this name, Tri-b\u00f3chan, bears great affinity to Tripthal-\nmos, an epithet of Zeus, whose statue was found, says Sir\nW. Jones, 'so early as the taking of Troy with a third eye\nin his forehead.' One of our poets describes him\n\nHolding in hand an instrument of three points, having a blue\nneck, wearing hides of animals, and concealing his wife Uma in his\nbody.\n\nAlso,\n\nWearing the crescent moon on the head, and a fierce serpent on\nthe neck, dancing daily, and using a bullock for his conveyance.\n\nK\u00e1lid\u00e1sa, the prince of the eastern Poets, thus writes of this\nd\u00e9va, and we quote from the elegant translation of his Megha-\nd\u00fata by Professor Wilson:\n\nHence with new zeal to Siva homage pay,\nThe God whom earth and hell, and heaven obey;\nThe choir who tend his holy face shall view,\nWith one in thee his neck's celestial blue.\n\n* Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, vol. vii. pp. 809, 810.\nI have already referred to the cause of this stain in his neck. It is thus beautifully described in Wilkin's translation of a portion of the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata:\n\nAs they continued to churn the ocean more than enough, that deadly poison issued from its bed, burning like a raging fire, whose dreadful fumes in a moment spread throughout the world, confounding the three regions of the universe with its mortal stench, until Seer, at the word of Brahma, swallowed the fatal drug to save mankind, which remaining in the throat of that sovereign Deva of magic form, from that time he was called Nikant, because his throat was stained blue.\n\nThe worship of this D\u00e9va commenced about 200 years after Buddhism had sprung up amongst the Hind\u00fas; and it appears that although it was at first resisted by the votaries of Brahma, yet that the popular feeling was so great in favor of the innovation, that Brahmins speedily gave way, and embraced the new faith. The ceremonials connected with the worship of this D\u00e9va, who presides over generation, are too disgusting and revolting to be described here; and I shall therefore dismiss the subject by simply quoting from an orthodox Buddhist poet, who exclaims\u2014\n\nWhat benefit is there from sacrifices to a Deva, whose ceremonial worship, consisting of a show of the emblem of generation, is productive of either disgust or lust in the mind!\n\n6. VISHNU, the object of adoration of thousands in India, holds a distinguished place in the Buddhistical annals of this country;\u2014and there is scarcely a single temple* in Ceylon in which a room is not set apart for an image of this Deva. He is variously described in our books, according to his different qualities, acts, and virtues.\n\nAccording to the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata it was Vish\u1e47u, who at the instigation of the sun and moon decapitated R\u00e1hu, who is described as an Asura or \"demon,\" that stole a draught of\n\n* In some instances, as at L\u00e1nk\u00e1tilaka, near Kandy, the Vihara and the Devala are under the same roof. See Forbes' Ceylon.\nAmrat or \"Ambrosia,\" at the churning of the ocean. Hence R\u00e1hu's enmity to those planets, whom the Buddhists believe are periodically seized upon by R\u00e1hu to avenge the part they are said to have taken in the detection of his theft.\n\nThe names of this D\u00e9va, as of other deities, are descriptive. He is Vas-dew, \"the son of V\u00e1s\u00e1-d\u00e9va,\" and Uvindu \"ranks next to the chief deva.\" He is Kamal-kal or Siri-piya, the husband of Laksmi. He has Siw-ba, \"four arms;\" Piyum-net, \"lotus eyes;\" Dambra, \"a sash round his belly;\" Hem-salu, \"a golden mantle\" on his body; Suk-pana, \"a ring\" in one hand, and \"a conch shell\" in the other; and Piyum-neba, \"a lotus navel.\" This last designation was owing to the part Vish\u1e47u had taken in the reconciliation between Parvati and Mahadeva, who found their concurrence essential to the perfection of their offspring. This was so far recognized by the Egyptians and the Greeks, that the former, we learn from Wilford's Essay on Egypt, had 'a vast umbilicus made of stone,' in their Temple of Jupiter-Ammon; and that the latter kept an umbilicus of white marble, at Delphi, in the sanctuary of the Temple, where it was carefully wrapt up in cloth. He is represented as being Kalu or Nilanga, 'blue;' and as Gurulu-dala, \"riding on a Gurulu,\" between whom and the serpent race is a deadly feud, originating in a dispute between their respective parents Kadru and Vinata; the wives of Kasy\u00e1pa. In a Hind\u00fa legend (as in the following extract from the Budugunila\u1e45k\u0101ra.)\n\nhe is described, as\n\n\"pillowed on his snake-couch mid the deep.\"\u2014Muddru Rakshasa.\n\nand as\n\nreposing upon the thousand heads of Sesh, amidst the waters by which the earth is overspread.\n\nThe story, in reference to which he is called Govinda, or 'chief of herdsmen,' is thus narrated by Miss Spier, in her \"Life in Ancient India,\" p. 466.\n\"At the conclusion of the rainy season, when the skies were bright with stars, the herdsmen were busily engaged in preparing a sacrifice for Indra; but Krishna, resolving to put the king of the celestials into a passion, persuaded Nanda to worship mountains and cattle, and have nothing to do with Indra. 'Kine,' he said, 'are our support; we have neither fields nor horses; we wander about happily where we list, travelling in our waggons; we are then bound to worship the mountains, and cattle, and have nothing to do with Indra.' Offerings of curd milk and flesh were in consequence presented to the mountain, and the worshippers circumambulated the cows and bulls, who bellowed as loud as roaring clouds. Indra's anger broke forth in a furious tempest, which lasted seven days and seven nights, but Krishna protected the distressed community by plucking up the mountain, and holding it aloft as an umbrella until the tempest ceased, when he planted it again on the earth. Upon witnessing these marvels, the herdsmen wished to render worship to Krishna, but he desired them not to inquire into his nature, but to be contented that he lived among them as a friendly relative.\"\n\nHence the appellation of Diya-banda, given to this d\u00e9va by our poets.\n\nIn the churning of the ocean, Vishnu seems to have taken an active part. It was undertaken by his advice, and with his assistance to recover Sri, whom Indra lost under the following circumstances. A sage named Durwasas gave to Indra a garland, which the latter, without attaching to it much value, threw at his elephant, and he to the earth. Offended at this sight, Durwasa cursed Indra, and pronounced that the latter should lose Sri or 'goddess of prosperity,' who reigned supreme in the several heavens appertaining to that d\u00e9va. She accordingly disappeared; and the consequence was, that the world fell into decay, sacrifices ceased, and the gods were enfeebled. To avert further evil consequences, the ocean was churned to find her.* At this search by d\u00e9vas, demi-gods, (who are sometimes designated d\u00e9val\u00e1s and demons,) various things and persons were found. They are called Ratnas or 'gems,' and are enumerated to have been Danavanturi, the physician of the gods; Lakshmi, the goddess of beauty; the Apsarases, or\n\n* Pr. Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u00e1na.\nnymphs of Indra's heaven; Sura, the goddess of wine; the Moon, said to be the jewel worn by Krishna; Sura-turn, or the wish-conferring tree; Surabi, the cow of abundance; Airavata, the elephant of Indra; the bow of Vishnu; his Sankha or shell poison; and Amrita, or Ambrosia.\n\nThe origin of the Apsarases, from ap 'water,' and sara 'to move,' is thus related in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a:\n\nThen from the agitated deep upsprang\nThe legion of Apsarases, so named\nThat to the watery element they owed\nTheir being. Myriads were they born, and all\nIn vesture heavenly clad, and heavenly gems:\nYet more divine than native semblance, rich\nWith all the gifts of grace, and youth, and beauty.\nA train innumerable followed: yet thus fair\nNor God nor demon sought their wedded love:\nThus R\u0101ghava they still remain\u2014their charms\nThe common treasure of the host of heaven.\n\nThe poison which was generated as above described was swallowed by \u015aiva; and the blueness of his neck has been the consequence. The moon is supposed to be the repository of the Amrita or \"ambrosia.\" \"It is\" says the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, \"replenished from the sun during the fortnight of the increase. On the full moon the gods adore that planet for one night, and from the first day, all of them, together with the Pitris and Rishis, drink one k\u0101la or \"digit\" daily, until the ambrosia is exhausted.\" In the Hero and the Nymph,* the poet says:\n\nHail glorious lord of night, whose tempered fires\nAre gleaned from solar fountains.\n\nThis is in accordance with the Western notion, which is thus described by Milton:\n\n\"The neighbouring moon her monthly round\nStill ending, still renewing, thro' m'd heaven,\nWith borrowed light her countenance triform;\nHence fills and empties to en'ighten the earth\nAnd in her pale dominion checks the night.\"\n\n* Hind\u016b Plays, i. p. 220.\nTo return however to the subject of the remarks:\u2014Vishnu is worshipped by the Buddhist as a d\u00e9va whose name is hallowed by historical and religious associations; whilst the Hind\u00fas treat Buddha as an avat\u00e1r or incarnation of Vishnu. The story in the Pur\u00e1na\u015b, is thus related by Wilford, in his Essay on Egypt and the Nile.*\n\n\"The Daityas had asked Indra, by what means they could attain the dominion of the world; and he had answered, that they could only attain it by sacrifice, purification, and piety: they made preparations accordingly for a solemn sacrifice and a general ablution; but Vishnu, on the intercession of the devos, descended in the shape of a Sanny\u00e1s\u00ed, named BUDDHA, with his hair branded in a knot on the crown of his head, wrapt in a squalid mantle, and with a broom in his hand. Buddha presented himself to the Daityas, and was kindly received by them; but when they expressed their surprise at his foul vesture, and the singular implement which he carried, he told them, that it was cruel, and consequently impious to deprive any creature of life; that, whatever might be said in Vedas, every sacrifice of an animal was an abomination, and that purification itself was wicked, because some small insect might be killed in bathing or washing cloth; that he never bathed, and constantly swept the ground before him, lest he should tread on some innocent reptile: he then expatiated on the inhumanity of giving pain to the playful and harmless kid, and reasoned with such eloquence, that the Daityas wept, and abandoned all thought of ablution and sacrifice. As this M\u00e2y\u00e1, or 'illusive appearance' of Vishnu, frustrated the ambitious project of the Daityas, one of Buddha's titles is 'the son of M\u00e2y\u00e1.' He is also named Saya Si\u0144ha, or, 'the lion of the race of Sakya.'\n\nIt is probably upon the belief of Gautama being an incarnation of Vishnu, that the Hind\u00fas regard the superficial hollow on Adam's Peak, as the impression which that d\u00e9va left by stamping the mountain with his foot.\u2020 But I may remark, that even intelligent Buddhists of the present day ignore the statement in one of their religious books,\u2014I believe the Sadharm\u00e1lank\u00e1ra\u2014\"that Gautama left the print of his foot as a seal, to declare that La\u1e45k\u00e1 would be the inheritance of Buddha.\"\n\n* Sir William Jones' works, ii. p. 577.\n\u2020 Spence Hardy's \"Eastern Monachism,\" p. 277.\nI have already referred to the distinguished position which Vish\u1e47u holds in the national religion of the Sinhalese; and I may, before concluding, observe, that our poets abound in allusions to this deity, and one of them especially regards him as the only d\u00e9va 'who was not dejected when M\u0101ra waged his fight against Buddha, as he sat on his vajr\u0101sana or diamond seat.'\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941 \u0935\u091c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f\u0903}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941 \u0935\u091c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f\u0903}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941 \u0935\u091c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f\u0903}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941 \u0935\u091c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f\u0903}\n\\]\nA STATISTICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE STATE OF CRIME IN CEYLON.\n\nBY JOHN CAPPER.\n\nPART I.\u2014THE WESTERN PROVINCE.\n\nThe amount and character of Crime existing in any country, is a study of so much importance, as to be well worthy the researches of the Statist and the Political economist. This is especially the case amongst a people who, like the natives of this island, are in a transition state; governed by laws dictated by the civilization of the West, yet dwelling amidst, and deeply imbued by the customs and superstitions of the East.\n\nIt is to be regretted, that in Ceylon, as in many other parts of India, the materials for statistics exist in a very crude and defective state, especially those relating to population. At the same time, it may be observed, that native society in this island exists in such widely different forms from the condition of any European communities, and the springs of action affecting their good or evil conduct are so dissimilar, as to render it far less necessary to enter into the very minute statements and comparisons as regards this branch of enquiry, which are to be found in works on the criminal statistics of European countries.\n\nThe scattered nature of the Ceylon population, the primitive habits and limited wants of a larger portion of the people, the absence of any densely populated towns, the cheapness of food and clothing, the facility with which a livelihood may be obtained, and the consequent small extent of pauperism, are all circumstances so widely different from\nthose existing in Europe, and so opposed to the existence of crime, that one naturally looks for figures shewing a highly favorable result as compared with almost any other part of the world.\n\nTaking the total number of convictions on an average of three years, as found in the Western Province, to which portion of the Island I am at present confining my inquiry, and comparing these with the extent of population, we find, to our astonishment, that the result is most unfavorable to the Island, as compared with similar returns from British India or the parent country. In Scotland, it appears that an offence against the laws is committed annually by one person in each 1,294 of the entire population; in England and Wales, by one in 929; in Ireland, by one in 582; in Bengal, by one in 1,219; whilst in the Western Province of Ceylon, an offence is committed yearly by one person in each 264.\n\nBut, startling as these figures appear, the case of Ceylon is very far from being an unfavorable one, if we proceed to analyze the returns, as I shall presently. As regards Bengal, and indeed British India generally, although I have alluded to the criminal statistics of that Government as officially published, I must explain, that there does not anywhere exist a faithful statement of the extent and nature of crimes and offences committed in any of the Presidencies, and least so in that of Bengal.\n\nIt is not generally known, out of India, that a very considerable number of offenders are dealt with in a summary manner by Indigo Planters and native Zemindars or landholders, who regularly hold courts of justice at their factories and dwellings. Not only do the riots of their own lands bring to their courts the offenders of their villages, but cases frequently come to them from more distant places. The evidence is taken by them with as much regularity, and far more fidelity, than in the Company's courts, and punishment is awarded without any hesitation on the part of the judge, on any complaint on the part of the people; from fifty lashes\nusually administered on the spot, or two or three months' incarceration in the Factory Jail, down to a trifling fine, being about the range of the sentences.\n\nI am not aware that any such instances of private administration of justice are to be found in any other part of the world; but so infamous is the conduct of the police of Bengal, and so corrupt the ordinary Company's courts, that a Hind\u00fa will frequently submit to anything rather than take his suit to one of them; and such is their horror of the police officials, that it is no uncommon occurrence, when a crime has been committed in a village, for the entire community to fly to the nearest jungle, rather than fall into the merciless hands of the darogah and his peons.\n\nI believe, that the official returns of cases tried in Bengal do not shew above half of those actually taken to account; whilst the extent of undetected crime in India, must also be very considerable; and this should be borne in mind whilst instituting a comparison between the criminal registers of India and Ceylon.\n\nI shall, in the present Paper, confine enquiries to the Western Province, hoping to complete it for the remaining districts of the Island in a future contribution.

Adopting this course, we find that many of the cases consisted of contempts of Court, the offenders being generally dismissed with a warning as to future conduct. A considerable number in some years, were cases of Cattle stealing, an offence which has, since 1851, been removed from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and made actionable in the District Courts.\n\nThe following Table of such cases, from the records of the District Court of Colombo, will shew the working of this alteration in the law.\n\nCattle Stealing Cases in the Colombo District Court for the six years ending December 31st, 1857.\n\n| Year | Persons charged | Convicted | Acquitted | Withdrawn or dismissed |\n|------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| 1852 | 12              | 5         | 4         | 3                     |\n| 1853 | 23              | 10        | 12        | 1                     |\n| 1854 | 32              | 8         | 22        | 2                     |\n| 1855 | 42              | 13        | 9         | 20                    |\n| 1856 | 17              | 9         | 7         | 1                     |\n| 1857 | 10              | 2         | 8         | 0                     |\nThe average of convictions in these cases, amounts to but 35 per cent., and it cannot fail to be observed, that whilst in the few last years, the convictions have materially decreased, the cases withdrawn and dismissed, owing to the non-appearance of prosecutors, have been greatly increasing. The above Table would induce us to believe, that the offence indicated was on the decrease; but, unfortunately, there is reason for knowing the contrary to be the case. It is urged, that since this class of offenders ceased to be prosecuted by the Queen's Advocate before the Supreme Court, they have become far more daring, relying with confidence on the delays and difficulties attending prosecutions in the District Court by private parties. The numerous withdrawals and dismissals indicate the degree of impunity which they are enjoying; and it may be well worth the consideration of the authorities, if it would not be advisable to instruct the several Deputy Queen's Advocates to take all such cases out of the hands of private prosecutors, and follow them up with the utmost vigour.\n\nThe next returns are those from Ratnapura and Kalutara, the figures of which differ very materially, though, on examination, the varying results may readily be accounted for by the peculiarities of the two Districts. Kalutara, it must be remembered, is the great centre of Arrack distillation, and we must not be surprised at finding a certain class of cases preponderating in the Court of the District.\n\nReturn of Persons convicted and acquitted, or dismissed, in the District Court of Ratnapura, for three years ending December 31st, 1857.\n\n| Year | Offences against Person | Offences against Property | Cattle Stealing | Other Offences | Total |\n|------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|---------------|-------|\n|      | Convicted | Acquitted | Convicted | Acquitted | Convicted | Acquitted | Convicted | Acquitted | Convicted | Acquitted |\n| 1855 | ...       | ...       | 0         | 1         | 0         | 0         | 1         | 1         | 1         | 2         | 2     |\n| 1856 | ...       | ...       | 2         | 0         | 1         | 0         | 1         | 9         | 3         | 1         | 7     | 10   |\n| 1857 | ...       | ...       | 0         | 1         | 2         | 2         | 4         | 1         | 4         | 0         | 10    | 4     |\nIn this instance, the convictions have run tolerably even, the preponderance of the acquittals having been, as in most other courts, in cattle cases. The average for these three years shews the convictions to have amounted to no less than nearly 55 per cent of the persons charged,\u2014a very favorable result, as compared with other Courts in this Province.\n\nReturn of Acquittals and Convictions in the District Court of Kalutara, for the three years ending December 31st, 1857.\n\n| Year | Offences against Person | Offences against Property | Cattle Stealing | Other Offences | Total |\n|------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|---------------|-------|\n|      | Convicted | Acquitted | Convicted | Acquitted | Convicted | Acquitted | Convicted | Acquitted |       |\n| 1855 | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | 23    |\n| 1856 | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | 77    |\n| 1857 | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | 41    |\n\nIt will be at once apparent, that the cases brought into this Court are much more difficult to deal with than in other instances. The habits of the people go far to account for the difficulty the authorities meet with in obtaining convictions, which here have not averaged above 10 per cent. during the three years under notice. The greater number of persons accused of \"other offences,\" have been charged with rioting.\n\nThe Police Courts will now claim our attention; and first amongst these, both in importance and amount of work performed, is the Colombo Magistrate's Court. The Table below shews the number of Police cases instituted and decided in each of the last 6 years in this Court.\nThe regularity of the results in these 6 years, is most satisfactory evidence of the steady administration of justice; for although the amount of work performed in the various years differs by five or six hundred cases, the proportion of convictions and acquittals remains unvarying. The large proportion of dismissals, amounting on an average to 59 per cent., indicates a great disposition amongst the natives to bring forward false and frivolous charges, engendered by ill feeling, arising from imaginary or real wrongs. On the other hand, very many of the dismissals are cases of simple disputes and quarrels between members of a family or neighbours, which are thus arranged by the Magistrate, accompanied by a reprimand and warning as to future good conduct.\n\nThe records of the Negombo Police Court shew a still larger proportion of dismissals, though a considerable number of these will be presently accounted for in a different manner.\n\nThe following are the figures in their case:\n\n| Year | Cases Instituted | Cases Decided | Convictions | Acquittals | Dismissals | Percentage of |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n|      |                 |               |             |            |            |              |\n| 1852 | 3899            | 3750          | 1455        | 180        | 2115       | 39           |\n| 1853 | 3961            | 3927          | 1386        | 165        | 2376       | 35           |\n| 1854 | 3469            | 3813          | 1327        | 163        | 2323       | 36           |\n| 1855 | 3839            | 3906          | 1437        | 166        | 2303       | 37           |\n| 1856 | 3627            | 3367          | 1270        | 121        | 1976       | 38           |\n| 1857 | 3968            | 3423          | 1228        | 130        | 2065       | 36           |\n\n| Year | Cases Instituted | Cases Decided | Convictions | Acquittals | Dismissals | Percentage of |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n|      |                 |               |             |            |            |              |\n| 1853 | 1425            | 1224          | 287         | 166        | 771        | 23\u00bd          |\n| 1854 | 1087            | 1055          | 212         | 84         | 759        | 20           |\n| 1855 | 4292            | 3049          | 255         | 87         | 2707       | 8            |\n| 1856 | 3855            | 4548          | 253         | 98         | 4197       | 5\u00bd           |\n| 1857 | 1452            | 1869          | 182         | 74         | 1618       | 10           |\nThe figures in this table shew a great irregularity during three of the years under review, though in the first and last of the period, the numbers agree precisely with each other. An analysis of the records of this Court goes to shew, that the great increase in the number of cases brought forward in 1855 and 1856, arose entirely from the District collectors under the Road Ordinance taking out summonses against persons liable for the annual tax, without troubling themselves to demand payment in the first instance; thus endeavouring to make the Police officials the means of collecting the tax instead of themselves. The Magistrate, however, refused to entertain most of these charges; hence the unusually large number of dismissals, and the apparent small percentage of convictions during those years. This practice was eventually put a stop to through the interference of the Government Agent, and the cases have once more sunk to their accustomed number.\n\nIn the Kalutara returns for three years, ending December 31st, 1857, we find a considerable falling off in the number of decisions, as well as in the convictions, during the last year embraced by them. The results are shewn in the accompanying Table:\n\n| Year | Cases Instituted | Cases Devolved | Convictions | Acquittals | Dismissals | Percentage of |\n|------|------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| 1855 | 2157             | 2278          | 300         | 152        | 1820       | 13\u00bd          |\n| 1856 | 2290             | 2309          | 304         | 175        | 1830       | 13           |\n| 1857 | 2075             | 1900          | 173         | 101        | 1626       | 9            |\n\nMuch as these figures differ from the result of the Colombo Tables, they perhaps do not shew any greater discrepancy than might be anticipated from the different positions of the\ntwo Courts. The above figures, too, are borne out by the returns from the K\u00e9galla Police Court, as may be seen below:\n\n| Year | Cases Instituted | Cases Decided | Convictions | Acquittals | Dismissals | Percentage of |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n|      |                 |               |             |            |            |              |\n| 1855 | 932             | 1041          | 121         | 77         | 843        | 11\u00bd          |\n| 1856 | 1073            | 1087          | 106         | 96         | 855        | 9\u00be           |\n| 1857 | 857             | 792           | 97          | 55         | 640        | 12           |\n\nThe convictions and dismissals, in both these instances, approximate very closely; and we may fairly presume, that the much smaller proportions of convictions in these rural Courts arises, not from any local defect in the administration of the laws, but rather from a less efficient Police, and a greater difficulty in collecting evidence amongst scattered and distinct communities.\n\nThe last of these Courts is that of Ratnapura, the work in which, during the last three years, is given in the annexed Table:\n\n| Year | Cases Instituted | Cases Decided | Convictions | Acquittals | Dismissals | Percentage of |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n|      |                 |               |             |            |            |              |\n| 1855 | 891             | 678           | 90          | 32         | 556        |              |\n| 1856 | 763             | 1090          | 165         | 148        | 777        |              |\n| 1857 | 866             | 820           | 75          | 50         | 695        |              |\n\nIf we now sum up the total crimes and offences on which convictions have been obtained throughout the Western Province of Ceylon during the last three years, and examine the proportion which these bear to the population, we shall be able to form an estimate of the relative criminality of this\nas compared with other countries. The annual averages of these convictions in the various Courts stands thus:\n\n| Court                        | Convictions | per cent. of cases |\n|------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| Supreme Court                | 28          | 65                 |\n| District Court, Colombo      | 24          | 24                 |\n| Do.

Ratnapura                | 110         | 12                 |\n\nThe total of all these averages gives us the annual number of 2,082, which, as I before stated, yields a proportion of one in each 264 of the entire population of the Province.\n\nUnfavorably as this result contrasts with the statistics of other countries, it assumes a very different aspect, if subjected to analysis; and separating crimes from mere offences, we draw a comparison between Ceylon, India, and England, as regards these two classes of offenders. The result will then be altogether in favour of Ceylon, as respects real crime though still leaving a heavy balance of mere offences against the population of this Island. This analysis shews, that while there is but one person in every 13,419 who yearly commits a crime, there is one person in each 269 inhabitants who annually commits an offence: crimes standing in the small proportion of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of all offences against the laws In Bengal, crimes and offences are about equal. In England and Wales, they stand as 15 per cent. of crimes. In Ireland as 27 per cent.\n\nComparing the total convictions in all the Courts of this Province on an average of three years, with the number of\ncases decided, and as compared with the English and Indian tables of convictions, we shall find them standing as follows:\n\nSupreme Court, 65 per cent.\nDistrict Courts, 29 \"\nPolice Courts, 20 \"\nAverage of all, 38 per cent. of cases tried.\nBengal, 48 \"\nEngland, 64 \"\n\nThere is no doubt, that the same cause which leads to the excessive preponderance of offences of a minor character, as compared with the population, when viewed against other countries, goes far to account for the smaller percentage of convictions, especially as we find the least percentage in the Police Courts, where this description of cases is dealt with.\n\nWhilst we may congratulate ourselves upon the very small amount of actual crime existing in Ceylon, judging from the statistics of the Western Province, we must admit the prevalence of much strife, dissension, and angry broils amongst the natives, arising partly from quarrels respecting the minute shares into which landed property is frequently subdivided, and partly from the vice of drunkenness, a propensity which, it is to be regretted, is greatly on the increase in many parts of the Island, but especially in the Western and Southern Provinces. It is quite impossible to institute any faithful comparison between the large number of frivolous charges instituted and dismissed in this and any other country, nor between the many Police cases, arising out of family and neighbourly disputes, of a trivial character, in which both sides being equally blameable, the Magistrate can do no more than dismiss them with a reprimand and caution to either party.\n\nThere is very little doubt, though the Police records fail to shew such to be the case, that by far the larger portion of feuds and petty assaults have their origin in the neighbouring tavern. The personal experience of Police officials and\nMagistrates tends to prove this; and confirmation would appear to be found in the following Table, in which I have compared the number of taverns licensed in, and the arrack revenue derived from the various divisions of this Province, with the population and the number of Police convictions.\n\n| District                                      | Population | Taverns licensed | Proceeds of Arrack Rent | No. of Inhabitants to each Tavern | Amount of Arrack Rent paid by each person | Police cases to each 1000 Inhabitants |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Colombo                                       | 42,810     | 73               | \u00a318,317                 | 882                              | 4 3                                      | 20\u00bd                                 |\n| Salpiti Korale                                | 41,910     | 38               |                         | 1,187                            |                                          |                                     |\n| Sina and Hewagam Korales                      | 97,488     | 120              | 3,937                   | 805                              | 0 9\u00bd                                     |                                     |\n| Pasdum, Raygam, and Wavelwilla Korales, including Kalutara and Panadure | 115,623    | 196              | 1,533                   | 590                              | 0 3\u00bd                                     | 18\u00bd                                 |\n| Three and Four Korales                        | 61,591     | 124              | 3,830                   | 520                              | 1 3                                      | 15\u00bd                                 |\n| Alut Kuru and Hapitigam Korales               | 104,842    | 61               | 5,751                   | 650                              | 1 0\u00bd                                     | 13\u00bd                                 |\n| Ratnapura                                     | 82,921     | 54               | 938                     | 1,720                            | 0 8\u00bd                                     | 1\u00bd                                  |\n\nThe above figures are averages of the last three years, and from these it may be seen that, to a great extent, the Police cases bear a relative proportion to the density of the tavern licences, and still more so to the amount contributed per head to the Arrack rents; the largest contributors to this branch of the revenue being also the most frequent visitors to the Magistrate's Court.\n\nThere is, indeed, a striking exception to this rule, in the case of the Kalutara and Panadure Division, where, although the proportion of licensed taverns and the number of Police cases agree, as in the other instances, we find the revenue per head the lowest in the scale. The only way in which we can account for this discrepancy is, by supposing that in this District, which is the great centre of arrack distillation, there\nare large surreptitious sales of the spirit, which militate against the price paid for the arrack rents; otherwise it is difficult to conceive, that a District which stands second on the list, as regards the number of taverns to the population, should yield less than half the amount per head than any other division of this Province.\n\nI find that the number of stills licensed in the Western Province has been gradually on the increase, having been in 1854, 196; in 1855, 290; in 1856, 332; in 1857, 244; and in the first five months of this year, 339. This increase is, however, attributable to the larger demand for arrack for exportation to the Presidencies and the Colonies, rather than to any greater local consumption, which is more likely to be checked by the greatly enhanced price of the article.\n\nIn the Tables contained in this Paper, no notice has been taken of the age of persons convicted, no such data being in existence. I may, however, remark, that juvenile offenders are in this country entirely unknown. In the same way, female criminals, who in Great Britain are as one to five males, can scarcely be said to exist.\n\nThe remarks which I have introduced into this Paper, are necessarily of a limited character, bearing as they do on but one section of this Island population. It will be highly interesting to compare the state of crimes amongst the various classes inhabiting the different Provinces of Ceylon,\u2014the Tamils, the Kandyans, the Moormen, the Malays, the Sinhalese, and trace the effects of growing wealth and intelligence upon their morals.\n\nShould I succeed in obtaining the necessary returns from the remaining Districts of the Island, I will hope to follow up the present enquiry by a second and more copious Paper, reviewing the Crime of the entire Island.\nSINHALESE RHETORIC.\n\nBY JAMES D' ALWIS, ESQ., ASSISTANT SECRETARY.\n\nIn the Essay, which on the 13th August, 1850, I read before this Society on, \"The Siyhalese language, its Poetry and Poets;\" and which I have since published as an Introduction and Appendix to the Sidat Sangarawa, I made a few general observations on \"Siyhalese Rhetoric,\" and also presented portions of the Swabasha-alaykara,* a work on Siyhalese Rhetoric. I now return to the subject, and avail myself of the present opportunity of laying before you a brief outline of the properties of style.\n\nThere are thirty-five rules laid down in the Swabasha-alaykara, for the attainment of a rhetorically correct style. I shall here present the reader with a brief summary of them.\n\nWhere proper terms (other than tropes) are employed, being a natural resemblance to the things signified, the language is such as will contribute much to fix our attention, and is called swaba, e.g.\n\n\"The bird that has a red crooked beak, green delicate wings, three lines in the neck, and is capable of articulate sounds, is the Parrot.\"\n\nThe above is an example exhibiting a sentence devoid of rhetorical tropes, and presenting proper nouns, particular and determinate in their signification.\n\nThe writer proceeds to give examples in such of the other parts of speech as are most susceptible of vivacity and elegance.\n\n* See \"Sidat Sangarawa,\" pp. 81, 82, 88, 184.\nThe verb is the next in order, and we select the following illustration from the K\u0101vyas\u0113kharaya:\n\n\"The babe sports about, exhibiting his budding teeth, smiling most lovely, chattering most tender expressions, and daubing (himself) all over his body with dust.\"\n\nHere the word \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca 'sports' is particularly expressive of the habit of children, and contributes much to the vivacity of the expression. If instead of \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca the poet had used \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca \"runs about\" the expression would have been tame and weak.\n\nIn adjectives the same author gives a beautiful example, in describing the virtues of King Pariikrama B\u0101hu:\n\n\"An ocean in profound learning\u2014the Mern in firm steadfast qualities\u2014a moon in gentleness\u2014these three virtues did he possess.\"\n\nThe words \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca, \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca, and \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca are, happily chosen; the first conveys the depth of his erudition as vast as 'the fathomless profound'; the second his firmness and unwavering resolution, as steadfast as the great Mandara, mountain; and the third his amiability of disposition, as gentle as the 'moon beams.'\n\nAnother mode of contributing to the vivacity of style is by the adoption of rhetorical tropes. Of these \"comparison\" is one; and may be described as presenting a parallel between the case in hand, and some other that is calculated to call forth such emotion.\n\nThere are several kinds of comparisons. Where a comparison is instituted, the resemblance in a certain quality being stated, the figure is a simile, e.g.:\n\"Having seen the splendour of her countenance, like the spotless gentle moon.\"\n\nWhen the resemblance between the comparates is merely implied, the figure is a metaphor; as\n\n\"Her delicate arms were like flashes of lightning.\"\n\nThe usual order of comparates is sometimes changed with a view to give prominence to the object to which a comparison is instituted. Thus we say, 'A dog runs about like this child.' There is greater vivacity in this sentence than if we expressed it 'This child runs about like a dog.' In the latter the comparison is simply instituted, but in the former stress is laid on the propensity of the child to mischief, which it is intended to correct. So likewise, to use an illustration given in the work before us;\n\n\"A full blown lotus is like thy face (O gentle creature!)\"\n\nThe change of the usual order in the use of the comparates renders the compliment more expressive. A comparison is sometimes repeated by reversing the order of the comparates in the repetition, as when we say; \"Like him is this fellow a thief, and like this fellow is he a thief.\" The repetition conduces much to the energy, or vicacity of expression. We shall present the reader with an example from the work before us:\n\n\"Thy face is like a lotus, and the lotus is like thy face (Gentle creature\").\"\n\nA comparison or metaphor limiting the similitude of the subject compared to one particular object, conduces greatly to elevate or degrade the subject, according to the design of the writer or speaker; as when we say 'Thy face is (like) the very lotus.' Comparisons or metaphors exhibiting the similitude to divers objects are\nfrequently to be met with in our books; and they conduce much to elevate the subject. We take an example from the Kusa J\u0101taka.\n\n\"His renown was like that of stars, jasmine, pearls, and mount Kailasa.\"\n\nHere the poet has selected white objects to convey the purity of that renown which it was his wish to exalt. If he had chosen other objects, as \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c the red lotus, the entire beauty of the comparison would have been lost.\n\nThere is frequently to be met with in our books a species of metaphor called prativastu, which is the expression of two sentiments, without stating the resemblance between them. This is a trope very pleasing to the mind, \"as men are more gratified at catching the resemblance for themselves, than at having it pointed to them.\"* Sub\u0101sita abounds in metaphors of this kind, and we shall select the following as an example:\n\n\"Better one son wise and good; there is no benefit even by a hundred of fools. One moon dispels the thick darkness of this world; it is not dispersed even by hosts of stars.\"\n\nAnalogical metaphors and comparisons are to be found in the Sinhalese, by the comparates being compounded as in the English word, \"table-land.\" In the language of Dr. Whately\n\n\"They are both the more frequent and the more striking. They are the more frequent, because almost every object has such a multitude of relations, of different kinds to many other objects; and they are the more striking, because (as Dr. A. Smith has well remarked,)\n\n* Dr. Whately on Rhetoric, p. 267.\nthe more remote and unlike in themselves any two objects are, the more is the mind impressed and gratified by the perception of some point in which they agree.\"\n\ne.g., \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb, 'stone-heart,' for 'stone like heart,' \u0daf\u0dda\u0dc0\u0dd2, 'devil-face,' for 'devil-like face,' ugly countenance, \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba, 'bullock-man,' for 'bullock-like-man,' &c., 'a stupid.' I shall adduce an example from the K\u0101vyas\u0113khara.\n\n\"\u0d85\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd3, \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd3 \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2 61\n\u0d85\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd3, \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd3 \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2 61\n\n\"I bow unto his supreme intelligence, the teacher of the three worlds, an ocean for gems-virtues, a moon for lily-faithful men, and a sun for thick darkness unbelief.\"\n\nIt is to be observed, that compound metaphors, as in the above stanza, where the resemblance between certain objects is implied but not expressed, are very frequent in the Sinhalese. In the example before us, the poet compares the virtues of Buddha to the inestimable gems produced in the ocean; the religious comfort which the followers of that sage derive from his Sermons to the influence which (it is supposed) the moon has over the lily,\u2020 his power to convert heretics, to the light of the sun which dispels darkness.\n\nWhere direct resemblance between two objects is expressed the Sinhalese use \u0d85 or \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb, equivalent to the English words 'like,' 'of,' as in 'moon-like brilliancy,' \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb (i.e., \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dd2, 'light of reason,' \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd3. Frequently, too, the comparates are used together, without a sign of comparison: in which case it must be observed, that an object is merely illustrated by the form of another object. Thus we speak of \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba, 'ear creeper,' \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba.\n\n* Dr. Whately on Rhetoric, pp. 265, 266.\n\n\u2020 It is to be remarked that if tambara were substituted for kumudu the metaphor would prove defective, insomuch as the former is a sunflower; between it and the moon there would therefore be no relationship.\n'sword leaf.' This metaphor may be easily understood by an Englishman by removing the order of the above words to suit the idiom of the English; 'creeper ear,' or 'creeping ear,' 'leaf sword' or 'leafy sword.'\n\nOrientalists give irony under the head of metaphor: and it is defined to be a speech, conveying a meaning different to the plain signification of the words. As for instance, if a person whom I bade carry a pot of water to the next room, broke it on his way, and I then exclaimed \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8 \u0dc3\u0da7\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca. 'He has done a very clever job!' the language would be irony.\n\nMany of the tropes in use amongst Western nations are also to be found in the Sinhalese. All the several sorts of synecdoche, of which Dr. Campbell treats in his \"Philosophy of Rhetoric,\" p. 431, (i.e., the genus for the species, the whole for a part, and the matter for the instrument or thing made of it) are of frequent occurrence in our language. Of the genus for the species; when we say \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8 \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca 'He went to break (extract toddy from) trees;' by 'trees' we mean palm trees, a species. When we say \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca 'the cloth was torn,' or \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca 'he was bitten by a dog,' we express the whole for a part. When it is said, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca 'by giving him the thousand pieces of gold,' money is meant, or masuran.\n\nIn a language like the Sinhalese, which abounds with so many delicate expressions to convey various degrees of respect according to circumstances, we can scarcely fail to notice, what is commonly denominated euphemism. As an example of this decency in expression, Dr. Campbell has given Martha's answer to our Saviour, when he directed the removal of the stone over Lazarus's sepulchre. \"Lord, by this time he smelleth, for he hath been dead four days.\"*\n\n* St. John xi. 39.\nEnglish expression, the original word 'smelleth' is rendered 'stinketh,' but it must be observed, that the Sinhalese never use the word 'stink' in a company, but invariably convey the idea by calling it 'smell.' I must not omit, however, to observe here, that even the word although it has undergone a change in its use by its being applied at present to mean only 'stink,' originally meant 'smell' or 'scent.' As in the following passage in Am\u0101vatura:\n\n\"Gods and men having offered scents, and flowers, said 'O great man! there is no one here equal to thee.'\"\n\nOther instances are not wanting, where to a vivid exhibition of what may appear as delicate, offensive, or indecent, the Sinhalese use a turn of expression different from that which they otherwise use.\n\nFollowing the order in which Dr. Campbell has treated of tropes, I shall here allude to the catachresis. An example of the use of words in a signification that is very near their ordinary meaning, may be furnished from the following portion of a dialogue to which I listened with pleasure; Where, I say, is your husband? 'I don't know, it was somewhere there.' The force and beauty of the Sinhalese expression are entirely lost in the translation. We only use when we refer to an inanimate object. When animate objects are spoken of ('was') is the verb employed. In the example before us occurs where should have been used. Although this is an impropriety of language (as doubtless in the passage in the Cotta version of the Bible, I Kings iii. 21 *), yet when we wish to express contempt at the\n\n* See Sidath Sangarawa, p. ccvi.\nmode in which a man lives, or at the inactivity or laziness with which he passes his days; such language contributes either to ornament or strength. In the sentence 'Where is that high one'; the word is used for 'tall fellow.' Here the tallness of the person is spoken of either in a contemptuous manner; or in amazement at his prodigious height.\n\nThere is no language in the world in which there is not from time to time a change in the signification of terms, or in which words are not deflected from their original sense. In the Sinhalese this is peculiarly the case: and we can easily illustrate the second species of catachresis which Dr. Campbell, (pp. 436, 437,) defines to be.\n\n\"When words which, from their etymology appear to be applicable solely to one kind of thing, come afterwards to be applied to another, which is nearly related in its nature or design, but with which, nevertheless, the analysis of the word will not accord.\"\n\nThe word , for instance, was originally used for \"food,\" and it is now generally understood to mean boiled rice; meant powder, but it is now usually understood as a designation for 'rice powder.'\n\n(To be continued.)\nSCRIPTURE BOTANY OF CEYLON.\n\nBY WILLIAM FERGUSON, ESQ.\n\nThe following familiar observations on some of the Plants mentioned in the Bible, and which are indigenous to, or are related to genera and species growing or known in Ceylon, form portion of a lecture delivered by me last year to the Young Men's Christian Association in Colombo.\n\nDuring my inquiries into this subject, I made free use of all the authorities at my command, and therefore, to those who have read one of the various works on the Botany of the Bible, it is not likely that much original matter will be found in these observations, further than the identification of the plants with our Ceylon ones.\n\nCINNAMON AND CASSIA.\n\n(\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf \u03a3\u03b9\u03b3. Cinnamomum Zeylanicum. Nees.)\n\nThe word Cinnamon occurs four times in the Bible, first about 1,600 years before the Christian era, in Exodus xxx. ver. 23, where it is enumerated as amongst the ingredients employed in the preparation of the holy anointing oil. \"Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much.\" Again \"I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. (Prov. vii. 17.) \"Spikenard and saffron, callamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense.\" (Cant. iv. 14.) While in Revelation, among the merchandise of Babylon, we have enumerated \"Cinnamon and odours, and ointments and frankincense.\" (Rev. xviii. 13.)\nBesides the real Cinnamon here undoubtedly referred to, (the *Cinnamomum Zeylanicum*), we have four other species indigenous to the Island, one of which, lately discovered by the present Director of the Botanic Gardens, has the perfume of the Lemon Grass so well known in Ceylon. The plant discovered by Mr. Thwaites, bears a name signifying that it has this resemblance.\n\nThe references in the Bible to this famous spice have called forth the powers of investigation of several authors, who have thrown considerable light on the subject and on the countries supposed to have produced the Cinnamon of the Bible.\n\nI need not enter into details respecting the Cinnamon plant, for which our Island is renowned above all other places on the face of the earth.\n\nI cannot say much about \"the Spicy breezes,\" perceived by voyagers off the coast and described by Poets, but there is no doubt that after a shower of rain the air in the Cinnamon Gardens is perfumed with the pleasant odour of various flowers around. The odour of the Cinnamon flower is neither powerful nor peculiar.\n\nI had the pleasure, in 1858, of examining in the British Museum specimens of the Cinnamon plant collected by Paul Hermann in this Island about 200 years ago, and which formed the origin of the *Laurus Cinnamomum* and *L. Cassia* of *Linnaeus*, the latter of which did not differ from the former excepting by the narrowness of its leaves, and they seemed to have been made so by the free use of a pair of scissors.\n\nThe Cassia of commerce is the produce of several species of Cinnamon, as well as of the real Cinnamon tree, the inferior kinds from Ceylon having been sold as Cassia.\n\nMilton makes several allusions to Cassia\u2014\n\n\"\u2014\u2014\u2014 and now is come\nInto the blissful field through groves of my:rh\nAnd flowery odours, *cassia*, nard and balm.\"\n\n\"*Paradise Lost,* Book 5.\"\nYou all remember the hackneyed allusion to the \"spicy gales of Araby the blest\" founded on the early idea that the Cinnamon which the Arabs carried to the shores of the Mediterranean was the produce of Arabia.\n\nAnother Poet writes:\u2014\n\n\"There eternal summer dwells,\nAnd west winds with musky wing\nAbout the cedar'd alleys fling\nNard and Cassia's balmy smells.\"\n\n\"Sleep in thy peace that bed of spice,\nAnd makes this place all paradise;\nLet balm and cassia send their scent,\nFrom out thy maiden monument.\"\n\nHerrick, \"Dirge of Jephtha.\"\n\nNotwithstanding questions raised as to Cinnamon being indigenous to Ceylon, there can be no doubt of the fact, and very little as to Ceylon being the source whence the Arabs derived the Cinnamon which the caravans took down to Egypt and Palestine.\n\nOLIVE.\n\n\"The dove came into him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the face of the earth.\" (Gen. viii. 11)\n\n\"The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. But the olive tree said unto them; should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees.\" (Judges ix. 8, 9.)\n\nThis is one of the earliest and oftenest mentioned trees in the Bible, and is by universal consent admitted to be the same as the one now known by that name. It is indigenous to Syria, to the South of Europe, as well as to parts of Africa.\nOlive oil and Olives are extensive articles of commerce.\n\nThe fragrant olive of China with which the Chinese are said to flavor their tea, was introduced to Ceylon many years ago, and we have two other species of Olive indigenous to the Island, but neither of them must be confounded with the *veralu* or *illupie* trees, which belong to two distinct Natural Orders, and both considerably separated from the Olive.\n\nI suggest this precaution, from the fact that some of my friends of the American Mission at Jaffna are in the habit of alluding to the *illupei*, which is one of the most valuable trees of the Northern Peninsula, as the Ceylon Olive tree, and because in this quarter Europeans are in the habit of calling the *veralu* the Olive. The fruits of this latter tree do indeed bear such an outward resemblance to the Olive, that the genus to which it belongs, has in consequence of this resemblance, been called *Eleocharpus*. The nuts of an allied species are those known to you all as the \"Brahmin beads,\" which, mounted as bracelets, are very commonly worn by ladies.\n\n**MUSTARD.**\n\n\"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in a field; which indeed is the least of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\" (Matt. xiii. 31, 32.)\n\nPerhaps the plant here translated Mustard, has called forth as much research and learned disquisition as any one named in the Bible. Some writers attempt to prove that because a species of the plant which produces Mustard (*Sinapis*) grows in Palestine to a considerable size, no other plant could have been meant; but the late Dr. Royle produced incontrovertible evidence to prove that the tree here meant is the *Salvadora Persica* of Botanists, a small tree, native of the hot dry parts\nof India, and of Persia, Arabia, and Ceylon. In a note to an article on the Flora of Ceylon, contributed by the late Dr. Gardener to the Appendix to Mr. Lee's translation of \"Ribeyro's History of Ceylon,\" it is mentioned, that he considered himself the first to discover this plant in our Island; but it seems, from a notice in Ainslie's \"Materia Indica,\" to have been known as a native of Ceylon many years previously. It is a common plant on the small Islands in the vicinity of Jaffna, and some specimens which I saw several years ago growing on what is called \"Small-pox Island,\" close to Jaffnapatam, bore a general resemblance to the weeping Ash tree. Its seeds taste a good deal like Garden Cresses, and its bark, which is acrid and raises blisters upon the skin, (in this resembling the *Plumbago Zeylanica,* ) is used as medicine. There are two species of the genus indigenous to Ceylon.\n\n**Sycamore.**\n\n\"Over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the low plains was Baal-hanan the Gederite.\" (I Chron. xxvii. 28.)\n\nThe tree here and elsewhere referred to as the Sycamore (*Ficus sycomorus*), is admitted to have been a species of Fig tree, the fruit of which is like the common Fig, and the leaves like those of the Mulberry: hence the name.\n\nWe have no less than 22 species of the genus to which the Sycamore belongs, and one, the *gan attikka* (*Ficus glomeratus*), bears a great resemblance to the tree here referred to. Some of the species are creeping plants, covering stones and rocks, and the stems of forest trees, somewhat after the fashion of the English Ivy; while others are amongst the giants of the forest. The famous Banyan belongs to them, and when at Jaffna, I measured one in the vicinity, which, with its hundreds of depending shoots, covered an acre and 1-12th of ground. This is the tree to which Milton alludes in *Paradise Lost*, as the fig tree whose leaves formed the first\nclothing of the primeval pair. The B\u00f3-gaha also belongs to the same genus, and I was assured some time ago by Sir J. E. Tennent, that the famous B\u00f3-tree of Anuradhapura, (the description of the introduction of which into Ceylon occupies a chapter of the \"Mah\u00e1way\u015ba,\" is the oldest historical tree on record. Sir Emerson believes there is evidence to prove that the tree now growing there is the identical one referred to in the \"Mah\u00e1way\u015ba.\" Those who have read the gorgeous language made use of in the \"Mah\u00e1way\u015ba,\") describing the boat, &c., in which the B\u00f3-branch was carried, cannot but have been struck with the similarity of language and imagery to those used by Shakspeare in reference to the mode in which Cleopatra paid her first visit to Anthony.\n\nThough the wood of the Sycamore tree is soft and coarse, it is believed to have formed the coffins of some of the Mummies found in Egypt.\n\nPALM.\n\n\"The righteous shall flourish like the Palm tree.\" (Psalm xcii. 12.)\n\n\"And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\" (Exod. xv. 27.)\n\nThe Palm tree here and elsewhere so often mentioned in the Bible, is undoubtedly the Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera), single specimens of which may be seen growing in several parts of Ceylon. It is the \u1e6d\u014d \u1e6d\u0113 ra\u1e6da indi of the Sinhalese; and a solitary tree which grows at Jaffna, vies in stature with any which I saw growing in Egypt. The two indigenous Date trees of our Island, (from the branches and leaflets of which Tats and Basket work are formed,) will give a very good idea, on a small scale, of the Bible date tree, and the manner in which it produces its fruit. Dates are imported into England from Barbary and Egypt, and into Ceylon from the Persian Gulf and Arabia.\nThere are perhaps a hundred varieties of the Date tree cultivated, and those who have eaten of the beautiful, cleanly preserved dates sent to England, cannot but have observed the vast difference between them; and the two kinds we get here. One of these comes in earthen pots, and is of a dark shining appearance, and rather pleasant to eat; but the other comes in messes, and not freer of extraneous matter than oriental sugar, which is never known to diminish in weight, however often it is spilled before it gets to the Bazaar.\n\nThe ancient Tadmor or Palmyra (built by Solomon and destroyed by the Roman Emperor Aurelian,) was so named from the number of the Date Palms which grew around it. To the natives of portions of Africa and Arabia, it is of greater consequence than the Coconut or Palmyra palms are to the natives of Ceylon; and hence, in former times, during a war with these countries, the greatest curse that could be inflicted upon them was to cut down the stamiferous trees, which were very few in proportion to the fruit-bearing ones, and so prevent the usual crop of dates. In consequence of this barbarous practice, attempts were made to secure a supply of the fertilizing pollen from the male trees, and it is stated that this, secured in earthen vessels, has been known to retain its fertilizing powers for 19 years.\n\nIt is no doubt in reference to the barbarous practice of cutting down such trees, that the following law was issued in Deut. xx. 19:\n\n\"Thou shalt not cut down the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down, for the tree of the field is man's life.\"\n\nIn reference to this passage, the late Mr. Roberts, in his \"Illustrations of the Scriptures,\" wrote:\n\n\"Can it be a matter of surprise, that the Orientals have a great aversion to cut down any tree which bears fruit, when it is known that they principally live on vegetable production? Ask a man to\ncut down a coconut or palmirah tree, and he will say (except when in want, or to oblige a great person) 'What! destroy that which gives me food? from which I have thatch for my house to defend me from the sun and the rain; which gives me oil for my lamp, a ladle for my kitchen, and charcoal for my fire; from which I have sugar for my board, baskets for my fruits, a bucket for my well, a mat for my bed, a pouch for my betel leaf, leaves for my books, a fence for my yard and a broom for my house? Destroy such a tree! Go to some needy wretch who has pledged his last jewel, and who is anxious to eat his last meal?\"\n\nI can imagine how refreshing it must have been for the children of Israel to have found so many Palm trees at Elim and elsewhere in their wanderings, and appreciate the various allusions to this useful tree in a country, many parts of which have a most barren aspect; but for my own part, I confess that the Date trees I saw growing in Egypt did not convey to mind any great idea of elegance or beauty.\n\nPassing from Cairo to Suez, and down the Red Sea, in sight of Arabia and Africa, the scenes of the wanderings of the Israelites, there is scarcely any vegetation to be seen; and the few specimens I picked up in the Desert of Sahara were leafless wiry looking plants.\n\n**Camphire.**\n\nMaritondi (Tamil and Siy.) (*Lawsonia alba* Lam.)\n\nCamphire (Kopher or Copher) occurs twice in the Bible.\u2014\n\n\"My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.\" (Song of Sol. iv. 14.)\n\n\"Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits, camphire with spikenard.\" (Ibid. iv. 13.)\n\nMost writers agree that this refers to the *henna* plant so common in our gardens here. There is no Siyhalese name for the plant, but they have adopted the Tamil one, *mari- londi*; by some it is called \"the Country Mignonette.\" It\nhas been compared with the common Privet, and those who recollect the privet fences so common in England, will see the resemblance. I never saw it growing out of the gardens in this part of the Island, but I am aware it is indigenous to the Northern end, where I have seen it grow in rich profusion for miles along the shores of the salt lake called Kallaveli in the Peninsula of Jaffna, and for my own part I consider it one of the most pleasantly fragrant plants we possess.\n\nIt has been proved that the nails of the Mummies, which may have lain for thousands of years, were stained of an iron rust colour from a dye made from the leaves of the henna, and the same practice prevails in Ceylon, and other Oriental countries to this day. The plant is found commonly from Morocco, through Palestine, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and India, on to the Malay Peninsula, and the Islands of the Indian Archipelago, and is used as a dye by the people of all these countries, in one form or another.\n\nIt is most likely that in Egypt the practice of dyeing the eye-brows, nails of the hands, and the soles of the feet, with a preparation of henna, has been very generally practised for the last two or three thousand years. The Persians and Arabs dye the manes and tails of their horses with it, and here we may see several of the Malays and Moormen whose nails and eye-brows have similarly dyed.\n\nFIG.\n\nThis is the first tree specially named in the Bible, where our parents are described as sewing fig leaves together, to make themselves aprons. (Gen. iii. 7.) The Fig tree is enumerated (Deut. viii. 8,) as one of the valuable products of Palestine, a land of Wheat and Barley, and Vines, and Fig trees, and Pomegranates. The spies who were sent from the Wilderness of Paran brought back from the brook of Eschol clusters of Grapes, Pomegranates, and Figs. The Fig tree is\nreferred to as one of the signs of prosperity (1 Kings xviii. 25.) \"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree.\" And its failure is noted as a sign of affliction (Ps. cv. 33): He smote their fig trees, and broke the trees of their coasts.\"\n\nAll writers who have studied the subject, are agreed that the Fig tree so often named in the Bible is the common Fig (*Ficus carica*), and which is pretty commonly grown in Ceylon; where most of the fruits, however, fall off before they are matured, from want of knowledge amongst the cultivators, of some facts connected with their cultivation, I believe. The fruit of this, and all the other species of Fig, consists of the hollow succulent receptacle, or general peduncle, enclosing numerous flowers; but from the fact that the Sinhalese are not in the habit of investigating such matters, they assert that the Fig tree has no flowers, and in reference to this, and the confidence placed in the truthfulness of woman by the Sinhalese, Major Forbes gave the following versified translation of some lines uttered in his Court:\n\n\"I've seen the Udumbera * tree in flower,\nWhite plumage on the crow,\nAnd fishes' footsteps o'er the deep\nHave traced thro' ebb and flow.\nIf man it is who thus asserts,\nYou may his word believe;\nBut if from woman's lips\u2014distrust,\nShe speaks but to deceive.\"\n\nCEDAR.\n\nI do not believe we have a single representative in Ceylon of the natural order of Pines to which the Cedar tree belongs. The Casuarinas, common about Colombo, bear a great resemblance to some of the Fir tribe, but that is all.\n\n* The Sanscrit name of the Banyan.\nIn reference to Solomon as a Botanist, I may just mention, that a genus of small plants has been dedicated to his memory in these words:\u2014\n\n\"Salamonia, in honour of Solomon, king of the Jews, the first botanist, flourished about 1,000 years before Christ.\" We have two species of this genus in Ceylon, one of which found in the bogs near Colombo, and elsewhere, is a plant from two to three inches in height, often much branched, and having long spikes of rose-colored flowers.\n\nALMOND, PISTACHIA, HAZEL.\n\n\"Israel said unto his sons, take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds.\" (Gen. xliii. 11.)\n\nIt is admitted, that the plant now known as the Almond tree is identical with the one of the Bible. It is a native of Syria and Palestine, and although I saw some plants of it growing in the Pasha's gardens both at Alexandria and Cairo, it is not likely that it grew in Egypt at the time referred to: hence the reason for its being included in Jacob's present. You will all see the coincidence between this passage and the habit of the Siphalese of bringing presents of fruits to those from whom they expect favors. It is common to all orientals.\n\nThe Peach, which has been grown on the mountains of Ceylon for many years past, is a species of the same genus to which the Almond tree belongs, but you must not confound the Almond with what is known here as the country Almond (\u0915\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e, kot\u1e6damba), which belongs to a distinct natural order.\n\nSome trees which were in flower, but not in leaf, at Gibraltar in January 1858, were so profusely covered with rose-colored flowers, that they were conspicuously seen a long way out at sea. The Almond is one of that important\nfamily which, according to the testimony of Geologists, seems to have been created about the same time with man.\n\nThe Nuts above named, in connection with the Almond, have, by various commentators, been translated \"Pine-nuts,\" \"dates,\" or \"walnuts,\" but other writers think that the \"Pistachio nuts,\" so much in request in the East, and imported into India from Afghanistan, are meant.\n\nThe word rendered Hazel in Gen. xxx. 37, should be translated Almond.\n\n**POMEGRANATE.**\n\n(\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4, delun Siyhalese; *Punica granatum*. Linn.)\n\n\"Beneath upon the hem of it (the robe) thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof, and bells of gold between them round about, a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate upon the hem of the robe round about.\" (Exod. xxxiii. 33, 34.)\n\nThere is very frequent allusion to this tree or fruit in the Bible, especially in the gorgeously poetical Song of Solomon, where it is spoken of as follows\u2014\"Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits, camphire and spike-nard.\" (iv. 13.) \"As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.\" (vi. 7.) \"I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.\" (vi. 11.) (and so in vii. 12.) \"I would cause thee to drink spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.\" (viii. 2.) It is common and well-known here, though not indigenous. The Siyhalese name of the plant is *delun*.\n\nIn consequence of the very frequent mention of the pomegranate fruit, in books of Eastern travel, I expected to find a very different fruit from the almost tasteless, small, and insipid fruit commonly seen in the bazaars here; but I am\nnow convinced, that when properly cultivated, the pomegranate is not only a pleasant, but very refreshing fruit, even to European taste.\n\nWhen staying with Mr. Henry Rudd for some days, a few years ago, at Kadungannawa, I remember he received from his cousin some cultivated pomegranates, each as large as a child's head, and they were certainly a delicious fruit, equalling, I should think, those which are said to be sent to Bombay from Muscat and Persia. The natiyes are so fond of them, and have such a high idea of their virtues, that to procure them for a patient suffering from fever or small-pox, they have been known to give from 1s. 6d. to 2s. for a single fruit.\n\nThe rind of the fruit is used by European and Native doctors as a powerful astringent, and is supposed to be the principal ingredient used in tanning Morocco leather.\n\nTares.\n\n\"The Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field, but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat.\" (Matt. xiii. 24, 25.)\n\nThe tares here referred to are supposed to be the Darnel grass of Europe, the Lolium tremulentum, a tall grass often found in corn fields resembling the wheat until both are in ear, and remarkable as one of the very few of the large family of grasses possessed of deleterious properties.\n\nOne of the greatest pests of the Rice grower of Ceylon is a plant called in Sinhalese kirindi-mand, known to us as \"Job's Tears\" (Coix lacryma) and it bears such a close resemblance to the Rice plant, that I believe they are undistinguishable till they bear seed. The seeds of this plant are of a pale grey colour and covered by a flinty shining coat. They are extensively used for bracelets, and I was told by a fellow passenger from St. Helena to England, that Lady Ross, the widow of a former Governor of that\nIsland, made and sold bracelets of these and other seeds sufficient to build a small church, for which she liberally gave the proceeds.\n\nWILLOW.\n\nAfter the Feast of Tabernacles, the children of Israel were required to keep a feast of seven days, and on the first day they were directed to take \"boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; (Lev. xxiii. 40.) and they were to rejoice before the Lord their God seven days. Job, when talking of Behemoth, said \"The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.\" (Job xl. 22.)\n\nHow very touchingly does the Psalmist describe the feelings of the captive children of Israel, when it was demanded of them to sing in a strange land, one of the songs of Zion, \"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.\" (Psalm cxxxvii. 1, 2.)\n\n\"And that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.\" (Is. xv. 7.)\n\nAnd in another place Isaiah speaks of the Willows as fit emblems for the children of godly parents.\n\n\"And they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water courses.\" (Is. xliiv. 4.)\n\nThere is no species of Willow indigenous to Ceylon, but upwards of thirty years ago, the very species here referred to, the Weeping Willow (Salix Babylonica,) was introduced, and now there are growing in front of Mr. Darley's house, plants of the same species, said to have been procured from the famous tree which overhung the tomb of Napoleon in the Island of St. Helena. Several now in Ceylon have doubtless seen this tree, and others of great beauty, when\ncalling at that Island. We are all familiar with the Willow pattern dishes, the design of which was got from China; now the Willow there represented, as well as in many of the Chinese paintings of landscapes, is this very species, for it is indigenous to, and very common in, China. In thus glancing at the familiar facts connected with the Willow, how strange are the associations produced in our minds. We first think of the captive Israelites, who because they cannot sing in a strange land, hang their harps upon the Willows; then we are carried by thought to the tomb in the far off Ocean Isle, where lately lay the remains of one of the greatest wholesale murderers that ever cursed this earth; and lastly we are borne along to a people (the Chinese) who seem generally to be much in the same state as they were 2000 or 3000 years ago, but who are fast being brought face to face with the civilization of modern Europe,\u2014the civilization of tribes unheard of in ancient Babylon, and still styled \"barbarians\" by those who arrogate to themselves the title of \"Celestials.\"\n\nHyssop.\n\n\"He (Solomon) spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall.\" (I Kings iv. 33.)\n\n\"Also, when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.\" (Eccles. xii. 5.)\n\nA great deal of learned discussion has taken place in reference to the Esoph of the old, and the Hyssopus of the New Testament, translated in all cases \"Hyssop\"; and instead of its being the plant well known to most of us as the common Hyssop, it is now generally believed that species of 'aper (Capparis spinosa or C. Egyptiaca) was the plant meant, and indeed is the best suited for the several requirements of the\none so frequently referred to in the Bible. But while there may be a reasonable doubt in our minds on the subject of this plant, perhaps it may be new for some of us to learn that the word \"desire,\" in the passage I have quoted from Ecclesiastes, is admitted to indicate a plant, and no other than the plant which chiefly furnishes the Caper of commerce (C. spinosa); and which, perhaps, some of us may not be aware of, are the unexpanded flower-buds of this plant. The genus to which the Caper bush belongs, is very widely distributed over the earth, and species answering the requirements of the texts referring to it, were growing in the several countries named in the Bible in connection with it. We have no less than twelve species of the Caper plant indigenous to the Island, some of which, when in flower, festoon the forest trees, and exhibit as rich a floral display as any plant in the Island. Their flowers are in general very conspicuous, and beginning with a fine rose-colored one, which was lately in flower in Colombo, are of various sizes and colors; one, in the jungles of the interior, displaying a profusion of snowy white flowers fully two inches across the petals. There was a very fine one some years ago at Elie House, which has since been cut down. It is a gigantic thorny climber, and known to the Sinhalese as \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba, v\u00e9langiriya. It has the flowers so arranged in rows on the stems, that when the uppermost expands and falls off, the next in succession opens in its turn.\n\nMALLOW.\n\nThis word occurs only once in the Bible, where Job speaks of those, \"who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.\" (Job xxx. 4.)\n\nThere has been a great deal of discussion on the subject of the plant here translated Mallow, and it is shewn that the original word may stand for several plants which grow in the lands of the Bible, as well as for the Mallow, some of which indigenous to Ceylon, and of others we have representatives\nOne of the supposed plants, the \"Jews' Mallow,\" (*Chorchorus olitorius*), is indigenous here: but in passing from Alexandria to Cairo in Egypt lately, and keeping my eyes open, particularly with reference to such subjects, I saw several plots of ground planted with the real Mallow, and cultivated evidently with great care, while I did not detect any of \"the Jews' Mallow\" so cultivated.\n\nThere is no species of the genus to which the Mallow belongs indigenous here,* but those gorgeous flowering Holyhocks now so common in our gardens, and the *maha-an\u00f3da* of the Siyhalese (*Abutilon Indicum*) so very commonly used by the Natives as a Medicine, are no unfit representatives of the Mallow. Another of the plants which the original word in Job may indicate, is the *Salsola Indica*, and which, according to the testimony of the late Dr. Roxburgh, \"saved the lives of many thousands of the poor natives of India during the famine of 1791-2-3: for while the plant lasted, most of the poorer classes who lived near the sea had little else to eat.\" In years when the Rice crop fails in the Island of Delft, in the Northern Province, the natives have recourse to the roots of a small grass-like plant called *silinti* in Tamil, and *kal\u00e1nduru* by the Siyhalese (*Cyperus geminatus*).\n\n**BRAMBLE.**\n\n\"Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou and reign over us. And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow, and if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.\" (Judges ix. 14, 15.)\n\nWe have no less than seven species of Bramble indigenous\n\n---\n\n* Since the above was written, I paid more attention to the identification of a common road-side plant in Colombo, which I find to be a true Mallow, and I think *H. tomentosa*, Linn.\nto the interior of Ceylon, and most troublesome plants they are to the Surveyor who has to cut boundaries through them; to the intending Planter who explores the forest, or the huntsman who pierces their recesses in pursuit of game. They are known to the Sinhalese, but it appears that the plant translated Bramble, as well as the other plants called Thorns, Thistles, and Briars, are involved in obscurity.\n\nThe Bramble, as well as the plant used to make the \"crown of thorns\" for our Saviour, is supposed to be *Zizyphus spinosus Christi*, a plant common in the East. The *Zizyphus palinurus*, a plant of Palestine, is supposed to be the Briar so often referred to in Isaiah\u2014\"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\" (Matt. vii. 16.) A species, closely allied to one of the plants supposed to be referred to here, is common in dry sandy ground near Colombo, it is the *sembu-nerenchi* (*Tribulus terrestris*) of the Sinhalese. It is a small plant, spreads flat on the ground, and its thorny fruits often annoy the barefooted natives.\n\nOf the genus *Zizyphus* we have five species indigenous to Ceylon. The *masan*, *masan* or *ilantai* is well known to most of us as producing a fruit, which is freely eaten and sold in the bazaars here.\n\nMany of us have read of a species of fruit eaten by the ancient Lotophagi; which, when once tasted, it was fabled, made those who ate of it lose the love of their country. I saw several of the trees producing these fruits in the gardens at Alexandria, and they bore a very great resemblance to the *masan* tree and fruits.\n\n**Tamarisk.**\n\n\"Now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.\" (Sam. xxii. 6.)\nMost authors are agreed that the word translated \"tree\" in the above passage, as well as \"grove\" and \"tree\" in Gen. xxi. 33, and xxxi. 13, should have been \"tamarisk\" or \"tamarisk-tree.\"\n\nThere is one species of the Tamarisk indigenous to Ceylon, but while the tree of the Bible is spoken of as affording shade, and a refreshing sight to the weary traveller of the desert and other places, our Ceylon tamarisk is remarkable for growing generally in water, \"and for a poor leafless appearance.\" Such, at least, is the peculiarity of those I saw growing in the marshes near Jaffna. It is remarked, that \"On the extreme part of the desert of Shur, the scene where Hagar wandered with her outcast child, the stunted bushes of the Tamarisk grow in abundance, and some travellers have remarked, that it was probably under one of these bushes that the desponding mother cast the child of her blighted hope.\" With reference to shade, I may mention, that the natives of Jaffna have particular objection to rest or to build their huts under the shade of certain trees, while the shade of the Tamarind is chosen by them of all others as being the coolest and healthiest. The Tamarind, however, bears no resemblance, except in name, to the Tamarisk.\n\nThere is rather a rare tree in this part of Ceylon, being one of those which the natives call \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd uguressa, (Xanthoxylon Rhetsa), and the seeds of which it is possible the Egyptians used in embalming. Under the shade of this tree, the \"hill people of India assemble to examine and determine their matters of public concern,\"* at meetings likely similar to the g\u0101nsabha of the Sighalese.\n\nThere is a fine specimen of this latter tree at the village of Kanatta, near Colombo.\n\nROSE.\n\n\"The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\" (Isa. xxxv. l.) \"The interesting comparison in the above\nverse, and the no less important one in which our Lord is compared to the \"Rose of Sharon,\" are the only two places in which the Rose is named in our English version.\" (Cant. ii. 1.)\n\nWhile some writers have attempted to shew that the Rose here meant is the same with the one we all know by that name, others have, I think, shewn with greater reason that some other flower was meant, as \"neither this nor any other rose adorns the plain of Sharon.\"\n\nSome have attempted to prove that a bulbous plant was meant, and have fixed on a species of Narcissus (*N. tazetta*), while the late Dr. Royle supposed that the \"Rose Bay,\" (*Nerium oleander,* so well known in Ceylon, was the flower meant.\n\nThis is a common and admired plant of Palestine, and is found in all our gardens here; while on the roads from Jaffna to Chavakachcheri and to Point Pedro, Mr. Dyke has planted rows of one or two beautiful species.\n\nSeveral varieties of the Rose grow in Ceylon; and in the interior, where whole fences are formed of them, they display a profusion of flowers, which can only be conceived by those who have seen them. Dr. Hooker stated that 20,000 flowers of roses at Ghazepore are required to make a rupee weight of the *attar*, which sells for \u00a310.\n\nThe plant known to us as the \"Rose of Jericho,\" is found in the deserts of Syria and Egypt. The annual stems of this plant, when withered and dried, coil up like a ball, but expand on being put in water.\n\n**Lily.**\n\n\"I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.\" (Cant. ii. 1.) \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin, and yet I say to you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of those.\" (Matt. vi. 28, 29)\nMany writers have translated the \"lily\" of the Canticles by Violet, Jessamine, and some other flowers, but the late Dr. Royle believed that the lily of the old and that of the New Testament are two distinct plants, \"and thinks the former to be the lotus lily of the Nile.\" (*Nymphaea lotus.*) This would account for the circumstance, that five times in the Canticles, in which the lily is mentioned, reference is made to \"feeding among lilies,\" as the seeds, roots, and stalks of this flower were common articles of Egyptian diet; and this author considers, that the frequent reference to this flower in that part of the Scripture, may be owing to the circumstance that the Song of Solomon was written, as has been supposed, on the occasion of his marriage with an Egyptian princess.\n\nDrs. Hooker and Thomson have lately identified the *N. lotus* of the Nile with all the varieties indigenous to or growing in India of the red water-lily, and hence the one growing in several parts of Ceylon is identical with the Lotus of the Nile. It is the *piya*, *el-olu* of the Siyhalese, and we have white and red varieties of it. It must not, however, be confounded with the sacred bean of India, which grows so profusely in the lake near Colombo, and which threatens to overrun the large sheet of water, as it did the tank between the Racquet Court and the Fort. It is the *Nelumbium speciosum* of Botanists.\n\nIt is on this latter plant that, according to ancient Hindoo ideas, the earth was supported; and it is somewhere recorded that one of the Gods assumed the shape of a boar, and dived down for the space of 3000 years to discover the source of its root, but in vain. There are beautiful allusions to the Lotus in Siyhalese and Tamil poetry.\n\nThe Lily of the New Testament, and to which Solomon was compared, is supposed to be the Chalcedonian or Scarlet Martagon Lily, formerly called the \"Lily of Byzantium,\" found from the Adriatic to the Levant, and which, with its scarlet\nturban-like flowers, is indeed a most stately and striking object. As this Lily is in flower at the season of the year when the Sermon on the Mount is supposed to have been spoken, is indigenous in the very locality, and is conspicuous, even in the garden for its remarkable showy flowers, there can be little doubt that it is the plant alluded to by our Saviour.\n\nOur magnificent, though common Gloriosa superba, and the cultivated Tuberose, are members of the family, and will give you no mean idea of the flower to which Solomon in all his glory was compared. I have seen it once stated, that the flower in question had some beautiful structure which bore out the comparison; but this is not necessary.\n\n**LENTILS, BEANS, BARLEY, WHEAT, MILLET.**\n\n\"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for I am faint. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils.\" (Gen. xxv. 30, 34.)\n\nThe mess of pottage for which Esau sold his birthright, is supposed to have been made from a small species of Pea, not unlike the green gram of the bazaars, and called \\( \\text{C} \\text{O} \\text{E}, u\\text{l} \\text{u} \\text{n} \\text{d} \\text{u} \\) and \\( \\text{E} \\text{S} \\text{q} \\text{i} \\text{O}, \\text{m} \\text{u} \\text{n} \\text{e} \\text{t} \\text{a} \\) by the Sinhalese. The famous *Ricola Arabica* is said to be the produce of lentils.\n\n\"Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim brought beds, and basons and earthen vessels and Wheat and Barley, and flour and parched corn, and Beans and Lentils and parched pulse.\" (2 Sam. xvii. 27, 28.)\n\nBeans of several kinds and varieties are amongst the most common vegetables cultivated and sold in our Bazaars here. It would rejoice the heart of a bean-curry-loving Sinhalese, however, to see the fields of a different kind of Bean, as cultivated in England.\n\nWhen surveying in the forests of Sabaragamuwa, sixteen years ago, my coolies and myself came upon some Sinhalese who lived under projecting stones, under one of which they\nhad a chatty full of beans and sweet potatoes boiling, and which we were very thankful to get from them, as we had eaten the last of our rice that morning.\n\nI may remark, that though the very common habit of our cooks here to put a copper coin in beans, boiled for table, improves their color, it does not their wholesomeness.\n\nBesides the foregoing and constant allusions to Wheat and Barley in the Bible, Moses described the ancient land of the Israelites as \"a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey.\" (Deut. viii. 7, 8.) And in reference to Rye, it is said, \"The wheat and rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.\" (Exod. ix. 32.)\n\nWheat, Barley and Oats were cultivated in Uva many years ago, and several attempts have been made since to grow them at Nuwara Eliya, but not with any great success. Wheat and Barley are too well known to require a description of them. The wheat the bakers here use, comes from India; rice, kurakkan, &c., are members of the same natural order, and like the Rosaceae elsewhere referred to, seem not to have been created before man. The expression, \"Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days,\" (Eccles. xi. 1) is supposed to refer to the Rice grown in the water.\n\n\"Take thou also unto thee wheat and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet and fitches, and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof.\" (Ezek. iv. 9.)\n\nThis is the only passage in the Bible where the Millet is mentioned. We have no less than 46 species indigenous to Ceylon of the genus to which the millet belongs, besides the millet referred to, which is freely grown in Ceylon and is known as men\u00e9ri.\n\nThe useful \"Guinea Grass\" belongs to the same genus.\nWe are aware that the limestone soil of Palestine is no longer a land teeming with corn and fruit, but a sad scene of desolation.\n\nBut this is because its people are \"scattered.\" Let them but return to their goodly land, and use the streams for purposes of Irrigation, and all the ancient fertility of the land will be restored,\u2014the Desert blossoming as the Rose.\n\nJONAH'S GOURD.\n\n\"The Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.\" (Jonah iv. 6, 7.)\n\nThe Fathers not only pronounced excommunications against those who differed from them on the subject of the plant representing Jonah's Gourd, but came to actual blows amongst themselves on the subject.\n\nIt is now admitted to have been the Castor Oil plant so common in Ceylon, and of such rapid growth here and everywhere. At Paumban, and on the Coast of India, the castor oil is used as lamp oil, while in China it is said to be used in cooking.\n\nThe Castor Oil, and the Egyptian Cotton plants, were the most frequent shrubs I saw growing between Alexandria and Cairo. The cotton is cultivated in small patches, and at every Railway Station, the castor oil plant, with its bronze-colored, palmated leaves, seemed the most common plant of Egypt.\n\nMYRTLE.\n\n\"Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree, and it\nshall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.\u201d (Is. lv. 13.)\n\nThe common Myrtle is the plant here meant, and which is very generally grown in gardens in Ceylon. There is a species of the same genus indigenous to the mountains of the interior.\n\nThe Pomegranate elsewhere referred to, as well as the jambu or \u201cRose Apple,\u201d belong to the same family of plants as the myrtle of the Bible.\n\nMany of you are familiar with Byron\u2019s lines, beginning,\u2014\n\n\u201cKnow ye the land where the cypress and myrtle Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime.\u201d\n\nWILD GOURD, WILD VINE.\n\n\u201cOne went out in the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lapful and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not. So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.\u201d (2 Kings iv. 39, 40.)\n\nYou are all familiar with the fact that the above passage refers to the sons of the prophets who were fed by Elisha at Gilgal, when there was a dearth in the land. It is supposed that the herbs which the person who went out wished to collect, were the fruits of the \u201cEgg plant,\u201d in fact, the Brinjall so commonly eaten in Ceylon; but that he mistook for it a plant of the Cucumber family, several of which produce poisonous fruits, and the one which is as likely as any other to have been the poisonous plant\u2014the Colocynth plant\u2014is common in the north of Ceylon, where it spreads on the ground, and displays a profusion of beautifully red-colored fruits. It is the \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca, Yak-komadu of the Sinhalese.\nSome of us may recollect the fearful results of a mistake committed a couple of years ago by a servant girl at Dingwall, a place within three miles of my native village, in the North of Scotland, where the root of the Aconite or \"Monkshood\" was used with the gravy of some roasted meat, instead of that of the Horse raddish. Three of the gentlemen who partook of it, died within two hours, while the others narrowly escaped with their lives. The \"Monkshood\" is identical with the Bikh poison of the Himalayas, and is known as one of the most deadly of vegetable poisons.\n\nVINE.\n\nThere is no doubt that immediately after the waters of the deluge had removed from the face of the earth, this plant was trained and reared by the hand of man; for, it is said, \"Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.\" (Gen. ix. 20.) The spies sent from Kadesh-barnea to explore the promised land, brought back, amongst other fruits, a large bunch of grapes;\u2014and there is constant reference to the Vine and Grapes in the Old and New Testaments. The real Grape Vine here meant is grown in gardens all over Ceylon, but bears fruit successfully at Jaffna only, I believe. There are sixteen species of the same genus indigenous to Ceylon. I have seen the bunches of fruits of one species in the forests, so large, that one of them would be sufficient to form a load for a cooly.\n\nBALM OF GILEAD AND SPICES.\n\n\"My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices.\" (Cant. vi. 2.) \"Is there no balm in Gilead, is there no physician there.\" (Jer. viii. 22.)\n\nThe tree which produced the Balm of Gilead is involved in obscurity. This, and Bdelium, Myrrh, and Incense or Frankincense, are evidently the produce of the same natural order of plants to which our Mangoes belong.\n\nThe kiluvai and mukkiluvai which form such beautiful fences in the Northern Province, produce a very fragrant\ngum. The *kiluvai* is evidently the *Protium caudatum*, W. and A. The *Canarium* of the North, and the *mala-kakunas* of this part of the Island, produce resins which are carefully collected, and are said to form the Incense used by the Roman Catholic Priests. On visiting lately the famous Church of St. John, in Malta, the heavy smell of its interior reminded myself and a fellow-traveller very forcibly of the sensation experienced on entering the Buddhist and Hindoo Temples. It seems strange that the two flowers most commonly used in the Buddhist Temples here, viz., the large yellow ones of the *Allamanda Cathartica*, and those of the *Plumeria accuminata*, should both (like the sacred *B\u014d*) be foreign plants.\n\nThe Elm in Hosea (iv. 13.), and the *Teil* tree of Isaiah (vi. 13), should have been translated Terebinth or Turpentine tree. This tree also belongs to the same natural order as our Mangoe, the peculiar flavour of that fruit being referable to the quantity of turpentine in it.\n\n**Coriander, Saffron, Cummin, Wormwood, Anise, Mint and Rue.**\n\n\"The manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of Bdelluim.\" (Numb. xi. 7.) \"Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith.\" (Matt. xxiii. 23.)\n\nCoriander, Cummin and Anise all belong to the same tribe of plants, and are known to us all as common bazaar stuffs for Curries. Most of them grow in Ceylon too. They are known in the bazaars as *asamidagan*, *kottamalli*, and *Hin-enduru*. The plant referred to as Anise should have been translated Dill, which also grows in Ceylon.\n\n\"Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.\" (Cant. iv. 4.)\n\nThe saffron here referred to, is made from the dried\nstamens of the *Crocus sativus*, and must not be confounded with the root so extensively used in curries here, and by the dancing girls at Temples to color their bodies with. This is properly Turmeric, though invariably called Saffron by the natives. The real Crocus is common in the bazaars as a medicine.\n\n\"Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.\" (Jer. ix. 15.) One species of the wormwood plant is grown in pots about Colombo, and there is another indigenous to Ceylon. It is a composite plant, and it is most likely that the wormseeds or *kirumisaturu* of the bazaars, and the salt of which is now used so beneficially in Colombo as an anthelmintic, are the produce of the wormwood of the Bible.\n\n\"Ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God.\" (Luke xi. 42.)\n\nOne species of Mint is indigenous to Ceylon, and the Spearmint and Pepermints have been cultivated here for a long time, and are common in the Island. The Rue plant is also cultivated in Ceylon.\n\n**CONCLUSION.**\n\nThe Algum or Almug trees brought by Hiram from Ophir are supposed to have been the Sandal wood tree, and which was growing in Ceylon in Moon's time. When lately in the magnificent Palace of the Pacha of Egypt, at Alexandria, I saw one large room, the flooring of which was composed of Sandal wood.\n\nThe Hind\u00fa Temple of Somnat, in Guzerat, which was plundered and destroyed by Muhammad of Ghuzni, had gates made of Sandal wood. These were carried off by the conqueror, and afterwards formed the gates of his tomb, whence, after 800 years, they were taken by the British conquerors of Ghuzni, and brought back to India in 1842. Many of you may recollect Lord Ellenborough's memorable despatch\non the subject; and you will have smiled at Knighton's unaccountable substitution of Sandal for Satin wood, in mentioning the material of which the P\u00e9radeniya Bridge was built.\n\nThe Cockle seems to have been identical with our Prickly Brinjal, the katu-wambatu of the Siyhalese, and a species of Solanum.\n\nThe Bay tree or Bay Laurel does not grow here, but the Cinnamon and other trees are representatives of the family to which it belongs.\n\nThe Shittah tree (Isa. xli. 19) is supposed to have been a species of Acacia, of which genus we have eight species indigenous to Ceylon. In riding from the Hotel at Alexandria to see Cleopatra's Needle and Pompey's Pillar, I found that the tree which formed avenues all along the roads, was the S\u00faryam\u00e1ra of the Siyhalese, the A. speciosa common in Colombo, and one of which is often in flower in front of the Queen's House. It is not unlikely that Anthony and Cleopatra may have reposed under the shade of this species of tree in the vicinity of Alexandria.\n\nThe word Ebony occurs only once in the Bible. (Ezek. xxvii. 15.) Several trees producing Ebony of various qualities are found in India, Mauritius and elsewhere, but Ceylon is famed for its Ebony, and there are no less than 21 species of it indigenous to the Island. There is frequent allusion in the ancient Poets to Ebony.\n\n\"Fert ebenum sola India nigrum.\"\n\n\"This ground with Bacchus that with Ceres suits:\nThat other loads the trees with happy fruits;\nA fourth with grass, unbidden, decks the ground;\nThus Tmolus is with yellow saffron crown'd;\nIndia black ebon and white Iv'ry bears\nAnd soft Idume weeps her od'rous tears.\n\nDryden, Virg. Georg. I.\n\n\"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,\"\nbecause the shadow thereof is good.\" (Hos.iv.23.) The Poplars above referred to, as well as the trees translated Mulberries in several parts of the Bible, doubtless refer to a species of Poplar, several beautiful varieties of which grow from Persia westward to England. The famous Aspen tree (*Populus tremula*), and likely the tree here spoken, of bears a considerable resemblance to our *B\u00f3*-tree (*Ficus Religiosa*). The petioles of its leaves are so arranged, that if the slightest breath of wind blows, they tremble; and it was formerly supposed that it obtained this trembling motion from the circumstance that the Cross on which our Saviour was crucified was made of its wood. The leaves of the *B\u00f3*-tree tremble in the same way, in consequence of their long slender petioles and the accuminations on their leaves. This trembling is said, in the Buddhist books, to have been communicated to it from the circumstance that it was the first tree under which Buddha reposed.\n\n\"The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree even all the trees of the field, are withered; because joy is withered away from the sons of men.\" (Joel i. 12.) The \"Apple tree\" in the above passage, as well as the \"Apple\" so often referred to by Solomon, in his Song, and in Proverbs, is, doubtless, the Citron, which is grown in several places in Ceylon. The Shaddock, known to us all, was long ago called the Forbidden fruit, or Adam's Apple, and it is sold as such to the present day in the London shops. It is generally called Pumalo, and belongs to the same genus as the Citron.\n\nThe Sycamine is a species of Mulberry, known as the *Morus nigra*, and which our *rata-embilla*, or Indian Mulberry, common here, a good deal resembles.\n\nThe Aloes mixed with Myrrh, and put on the body of our Saviour by Nicodemus, appear to have been the produce of a species of *Aquilaria*, of which our *patta-walla* (*Gyrinops walla*), is a representation.\nTHE SUPPOSED IDENTITY BETWEEN NAGARJUNA AND NAGASENA,\n\nBY JAMES D'ALWIS, ESQ., Asst. Secretary.\n\nHaving on a former occasion expressed my views on the passage extracted from the R\u0101ja Tarangani, in reference to its prosodial precision, I now return to the subject, with the object of reviewing the reasons adduced by the Hon'ble Mr. Turnour in favour of the alleged identity between N\u00e1gas\u00e9na and N\u00e1garj\u00fana. This position, I perceive, he has laboured to establish in seven different ways:\n\n1. By the evidence supposed to be furnished by a Bactrian coin found by Lieutenant Burnes;\n\n2. By supplying a supposed omission of a letter in the text, by which the age of N\u00e1garj\u00fana is brought to correspond exactly with that of N\u00e1gas\u00e9na in the Buddhist Scriptures;\n\n3. By identifying A\u015b\u00f3ka of Kashmir with the A\u015b\u00f3ka of Maghada;\n\n4. By the strong resemblance between the two names;\n\n5. By shewing that the title of Bhumishvara given to N\u00e1garj\u00fana did not militate against the hypothesis he sought to establish;\n\n6. By identifying \"the six Arahatvas\" in the extract made by Professor Wilson with the six Tirtakas mentioned in Milindappra\u015bna;\n\n7. By an adjustment of dates, so as to bring the Chronology of the R\u0101ja Tarangani to coincide with the adjusted\nHindu Chronology, and with the Atthakatha of the Pitakattya, and Mahavamsa\n\nFirst. As to the evidence supposed to be furnished in favour of this hypothesis by the Bactrian coin described in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, vol. II. p. 314, &c., I am willing to abide by the opinion subsequently expressed by Mr. Prinsep, in the following note to Mr. Turnour's observations on the subject.\n\n\"Most of our readers are aware that the date assigned in our notice of Lieutenant Burnes' coin, was afterwards in a measure abandoned, on the ground of its being found in association with Sassanian coins of much later period. The reading of the letter P in KANHPKOM was also confirmed by a multitude of specimens. No argument, therefore, can safely be built on the evidence of this coin as to the period of N\u0101garjuna's mission, but there remains ample authority without it, in the written history of the Buddhist Church.\" *\n\nAbandoning therefore this item of evidence, I shall proceed to a consideration of the second.\n\nSecond. I have already examined the text with reference to the alteration suggested by Mr. Turnour upon this head; and the correctness of shardan-varsha-satan, \"one century and a half,\" as given in the N\u0101gara version, is attested by the general scope of Kashmirian history, which brings down the fifty-one reigns, including those of Turushka princes and of Abhimanya (in whose reign, as well as afterwards, the Buddhists cherished by the learned Bodhisatwa N\u0101garjuna, maintained the ascendancy\u2020), to only B.C. 1182. It would thus seem that the criticism offered is inadmissible, not only upon the supposition of an \"inaccuracy of some transcriber of the work,\" but upon every other conceivable ground, except that of an error, as hinted by Mr. Turnour himself, of \"Kalhana Pandit's having misunderstood the Buddhistical writers from whom his authority was derived.\" Indeed, it would be im-\n\n* See Bengal Asiatic Journal V. p. 585.\n\u2020 Asiatic Researches, xv. pp. 113, 114.\npossible to adjust this date with precision, even according to Bhuddhistical writers, unless we obtain proofs in support of the next hypothesis of Mr. Turnour, to which we now turn our attention.\n\nThird. That A\u1e63\u00f3ka of Kashmir was identical with the Maghada prince of that name. True it is, that in addition to the resemblance in the names, some little incidents of life, as related of A\u1e63\u00f3ka in the R\u00e1ja Tarangani, accord with the same facts detailed in Ceylon and Indian Annals of the A\u1e63\u00f3ka of Maghada: as for instance, his abolishing the Brahminical rites, and substituting those of Jina or Buddha (R\u00e1ja Tarangani in \"Asiatic Researches,\" xv. p. 19, and Mah\u00e1wansha, pp. 23, 26); and his \"not having been the direct descendant of his predecessors, who reigned in Kashmir,\" as attested by the genealogy given in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1na.\n\nOpposed, however, to these marks of resemblance, are the following points of discordance; First, the A\u1e63\u00f3ka of Kashmir appears, from the whole tenor of the R\u00e1ja Tarangani, to have been a resident of that country; whereas the A\u1e63\u00f3ka of Hind\u00fa and Bhuddhistical annals, was a prince of P\u00e1taliputra (modern Patna), who had previously held the government of Uggeni (Avanti) before his inauguration (Mah\u00e1wansha, cap. v.) Second\u2014The mission of Buddhist priests into Kashmir, the abolition of N\u00e1ga worship, and the visitation of tempests, are related in Mah\u00e1wansha, cxiii. as having occurred during the reign of A\u1e63\u00f3ka of Patna, whilst the same incidents are detailed in the R\u00e1ja Tarangani as having taken place in the reign of Abhimanya, (\"Asiatic Researches,\" xv. p. 24.) One other reason, and it is a weighty one, for the non-identity of the two A\u1e63\u00f3kas is, that Kashmir is not included in the number of countries over which the Indian A\u1e63\u00f3ka reigned; and according to the Girnar inscription of that monarch, where all the conquered states are named, he was \"Lord of the countries of Avanti, Anupa, Vrija, Anartta, Surashtra, Savara, Kukura, Kirata, Tisha\nand others, all conquered* by his own might, and maintained in their former prosperity, and all their inhabitants, both high and low, converted into obedient subjects\u2014all these countries, under His Majesty forming one Empire, and furnishing every object of desire and gratification.\"\n\nBe these differences, however, as they may, the marks of resemblance, and therefore mere presumptive proofs in support of the hypothesis, become perfectly valueless, when we refer to the direct evidence contained in the R\u0101ja Tarangani, of the descent of Prince A\u015boka, of Kashmir. In the Rajavali Pataka, by Prajya Bhatta, brought up to the conquest of the valley by the Emperor Akb\u00e1r, (printed at Calcutta, edition, of 1835,) occurs the following passage:\n\nAth\u0101nya vamsa j\u00f3 r\u00e1j\u00e1; G\u014ddhar\u00f3 n\u00e1ma bh\u00e1gya v\u00e1n [35 v. 7m.]\nTadangaj\u00e1h Suvarnahya [v. 60.] s'tats\u00fanur Janak\u00f3rupah [v. 6.]\nSachinaras tassya s\u00fanu [v. 71.] r'As\u00f3ka-stat pitruvyajah [v. 62.]\nJalawkastats\u00fat\u00f3 n\u00e1ma Kashmir\u00e9shu sukaprada\u1e25 [30. v.]\n\n\"Thereafter, an illustrious prince named Godhara, born of a different race (reigned 35 years and 7 months), his son Swarna (60 years), his son king Janaka (6 years), his son Sachinara (71 years), his father's brother's son (i.e., cousin) As\u00f3ka (62 years), his son named Jalawka, the benefactor of Kashmira (30 years).\n\nIf therefore my translation of this passage be correct, the identity attempted to be instituted between A\u015boka \"the son of Sachinara's father's brother,\" (upon the supposition that he was only descended from the paternal great uncle of Khagandra\u2020), and the Indian A\u015boka, the grandson of Chandragupta, and the son of Bindusara, falls to the ground. For, according to the genealogy here given, A\u015boka was the grandson of\n\n* \"The native chronicles of Kashmir,\" says Sir Erskine Perry in an account of this great Hindu Monarch, &c., in the Bombay Asiatic Journal, xiv. p. 173, \"ascribe its acquisition to inheritance.\"\n\u2020 \"Descended from the paternal great uncle of Khagendra.\"\u2014Pr. Wilson.\nSwarna, and not of Chandragupta. Thus:\n\n```\n          GODARA\n            |\n            SWARNA\n            |\n          JANAKA    BROTHER\n            |         |\n          SACHINARA   ASOKA.\n```\n\nAgain, the *Raja Tarangani* records the accession of Jalawka, a son of Asoka, upon the demise of that Kashmiran Prince. All those who are conversant with Sinhalese and Hind\u00fa history, know, however, that this was not the case.\n\nAlthough I differ from Mr. Turnour upon these and other points, to which I have adverted in the course of my observations, I freely confess, that a careful consideration of all the surrounding circumstances leads me to the same conclusion at which that eminent scholar has arrived, viz., that N\u00e1garj\u00fana of the Hind\u00fas, and N\u00e1g\u00e1s\u00e9na of the Ceylonese, was one and the same identical person. I shall therefore proceed to consider\n\n**Fourthly.**\u2014The resemblance between the two names, which is very striking. The *r* in *N\u00e1garj\u00fana* is clearly a creature of the Sanscrit, and it is dropped in the P\u00e1li and Sinhalese. The interchange of *j* and *s* is well known. *R\u00e1ja* is expressed *r\u00e1\u015ba* in Tamil; Jambudw\u00edpa is expressed Zambuduvipa in the Analysis of Tibetan works, by Ksoma de Korosi, and so on. The interchange of vowels, especially *u* into *e* is frequent. Thus the resemblance in the two names furnishing a strong presumption in favour of the identity of this Kashmiran and Buddhistical personage, I proceed to a consideration\n\n**Fifthly.**\u2014That the title of *Bhumeshwara*, may be applied to an Ascetic. *Bhumeshwaro* and *Bodhisatwo* are two of the appellations given to N\u00e1garj\u00fana. The former is usually applied to statesmen, and the latter to celebrated and eminent\nhierarchs of the Buddhist Church. It has been shewn by Mr. Turnour, that the first was also applied to priests; and the second, we know from our own records, to princes; for instance, in our own country Sri Sanga Bo, who had taken upon himself the vows of the A\u1e6da-sil order is called a Bodhisatwa, in the following extract from the \"Attanagaluwapasa\":\n\nLank\u00e1bhi sitta vasudh\u00e1di pat\u00e9su r\u00e1j\u00e1,\nY\u00f3 b\u00f3dhi-satta gunaw\u00e1 Siri-Sanga b\u00f3dhi;\nTass\u00e1tich\u00e1ru chariy\u00e1 rachan\u00e1 mukh\u00e9na\nVakkhami Hattha-vanagalla Vih\u00e1ra wansan.\n\n\"I celebrate the history of the Temple of Attanagalla; and first dwell on the highly laudable conduct of Sri Sa\u1e45ga Bo, who was a Bhodhisatva among the sovereigns of Lanka.\"\n\nThe meaning assigned to this term in the R\u00e1ja Tarangani, though not comprehensive, may yet be regarded as approaching to correctness, for the historian himself thus explains its signification in the following stanza:\n\nLok\u00e9 bhagawat\u00f3 l\u00f3ka, nath\u00e1 darabhya k\u00e9chana\nY\u00e9 janta v\u00f3ga takkl\u00e9sh\u00e1n, b\u00f3dhisatw\u00e1na v\u00e9hit\u00e1n.\n\n\"Know ye that if there was any person in the world, from the sanctified Buddha downwards, who had destroyed Kl\u00e9sha, he is a Bhodhisatva.\"\n\nBut, whether we regard this distinguished personage as one who denounced the six arahatwas, according to the rendering of the passage by Professor Wilson, or take him as one who had passed six days in the wilderness, as described in the N\u00e1gara version, there is, in either case, nought to doubt the alleged identity between N\u00e1garj\u00fana and N\u00e1gas\u00e9na. It would however seem, that from these appellations alone we cannot ascertain the precise character of N\u00e1gas\u00e9na. Yet the criticism which I have already offered, and by which the text was altered into \"shadar vana sanshraye,\" as one who \"spent six days in the wilderness,\" enabling us to fix upon the sacerdotal or the ascetic character of N\u00e1garj\u00fana, we proceed to a consideration\nSixthly.\u2014Of the supposed identity between the \"shadarhatwa,\" or the six Arahatwas, in the passage as given by Professor Wilson, and the six Tirtakas in the Milindappra\u1e47a. If the passage were as given by Professor Wilson, there would doubtless be great reason, especially when viewed in connection with other circumstances, to raise a strong presumption in favour of the alleged identity. Not the less strong, however, is the presumptive proof of resemblance, when we take the text to mean (instead of that he denounced the six Tirtakas) that he usually spent six days in the wilderness. For we find, that the passing of six days in the wilderness, was an ascetic rite prescribed by Buddhism.\n\nThe Milindappra\u1e47a records the fact, that N\u0101gas\u0113na attained the sanctified status of an Arahat; and we not only learn from the same record, that nir\u014ddhi samapatti of passing six days in the wilderness was an ascetic rite of the arahat, but the same is also found defined in the Visudha M\u0101rga.\n\nThere is, therefore, much coincidence between the facts detailed in the two historical records: and there is also much concurrence between the statement of N\u0101gas\u0113na's having overcome all the disputants of his age, (see the text), and the facts stated in the following stanzas in the R\u0101ja Tarangani, which records,\n\nTasmin navasar\u0113 bowddh\u0101 d\u0113sh\u0113 prabala\u1e6d\u0101nyayuh,\nN\u0101g\u016br\u0101jun\u0113na sudhiy\u0101 bodhisatw\u0113na p\u0101lit\u0101h.\nT\u0113w\u0101linah para\u1e6d\u012btya v\u0101d\u0113na nikhi\u015b\u0101nbudh\u0101n,\nKiriy\u0101n N\u012bla pur\u0101n\u014dkt\u0101 machchindann\u0101ga madvisah.\n\n\"That at that time (in the reign of Abimane) the Buddhas cherished by the wise Bodhisatwa N\u0101garjuna attained eminence in this country (Kashmira); and that they who were disputants and enemies of the religion, (i.e., the national religion, or of Vedas) overcame all the wise men in argument, and set aside the practices prescribed in the N\u012bla purana.\"\n\nHaving reviewed six grounds, upon which Mr. Turnour has based his observations on the identity between N\u0101garjuna and N\u0101gas\u0113na, I come to the\nSeventh;\u2014and here I cannot but express my entire concurrence with the remarks so ably set forth by him. In addition to those remarks under this head, I may be permitted here to observe, that the Tibetan Buddhistical annals, as presented to us by Ksoma de Korosi, indisputably establish the identity in question.\n\nKsoma de Korosi in his analysis of the Tibetan Annals, (see \"Asiatic Researches,\" vol. xx. p. 400,) alluding to the same prediction contain in the \"Mahavamsa,\" regarding N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, records as facts to be found in the Sher-chun collection, that \"N\u00e1garjuna lived 400 years after the death of Sh\u00e1kya, who had foretold of him, that he would be born, after so many years, to explain the higher principles laid down in the Prajna Paramita.\" In regard to Kanishka, (one of the Turushka princes mentioned in the Raju Tarangani,) it is also stated in the Tibetan annals, that one of the Buddhistical convocations took place in the time of that prince, \"Kanishka, a king in the north of India, upwards of 400 years from Shakya.\" (\"Asiatic Researches,\" vol. xx. p. 41.) It will be seen also, that I introduced into a paper which I read before this Society, \"On the Mythological Legends of the Singhalese,\" an extract from a little pamphlet which records that N\u00e1gas\u00e9na was a distinguished hierarch of the Buddhist Church in 490 A.B.\n\nAfter a careful perusal of these facts, it is indeed impossible to withhold the conclusion to which they inevitably lead, viz., that the personage designated N\u00e1garjuna in India, and N\u00e1gas\u00e9na in Ceylon, was one and the same person; and that the ages of 400 and 500 A.B., (assigned to him in round numbers by the two countries respectively,) are to be regarded as approximating rather than specific dates.\nEXPENDITURE ON PUBLIC WORKS IN CEYLON.\n\nBY J. CAPPER, ESQ., Honorary Secretary.\n\nIt was not long since, that my attention was directed to a paper read by Colonel Sykes before the Asiatic Society of Great Britain, on the Expenditure on Public Works in India, and a perusal of it induced me to enter upon the subject of Public Works in Ceylon. It is a topic full of interest, taking us back in our researches, to the earliest records of Sinhalese History, when Ceylon, densely peopled, actively industrious, and highly prosperous, produced works of Irrigation, of such magnitude and number as to have raised the wonder of later rulers of the Island, who have hitherto vainly strove to follow even distantly in their steps, by renovating and utilizing a few of the gigantic Tanks which lie scattered in ruins over the jungles and swamps of many parts of Ceylon.\n\nAs I entered upon this most interesting topic, I found my materials increasing on my hands; I found the subject extending as I progressed, until I perceived, that instead of a short statistical paper, my researches would lead to an Historical Treatise, to follow up which and do it ample justice, would require more time than I could, for the present, devote to it. This being the case, I felt reluctantly compelled to confine my notes and remarks at this time, to the extent and outlay on Public Works in Ceylon, during a little more than a quarter of a century.\n\nOn casting our eyes over the materials for such a paper as this, we cannot fail to be struck with the contrast presented\nby the records of the various Governments that have at different periods ruled in Ceylon.\n\nThe Sinhalese Monarchs, jealous of foreign intruders within their domains, so far from opening up their Territories by roads, carefully closed up all access to the interior from the sea-bord, leaving nothing but the most difficult and steepest bullock paths. On the other hand, their utmost efforts, the united labour of their people, was directed to the construction of Buddhist structures of colossal magnitude, and Tanks of vast extent. In almost every Chapter of the translated and untranslated portions of that great Historical work, the \"Mahawamsa,\" we meet with notices more or less brief, but still explicit enough, of the many great public works undertaken by the various Monarchs whose reigns and whose characters are therein chronicled.\n\nDeeply impressed with the importance of and even necessity for a careful and extensive utilising of the water supply of large tracts of country, if those regions were to be made permanently productive, the religious code of their faith enjoined the construction and upkeep of tanks, canals and water-courses, as a sacred duty, and one that should go far to obtain for them hereafter the greatest reward of their existence.\n\nUpon the details connected with Sinhalese Public Works, I cannot now enter; but must content myself with merely observing, that the existence of the great tanks and water-courses now in ruins, or in partial restoration, were the means, in those remote days, of feeding a much larger population than Ceylon can now boast of, and rendered her perfectly independent of India for her supplies of Grain. Even more than this; it is on record, that so late as the Portuguese period, rice was exported from Ceylon. What the extent and cost of some of those works must have been, may be gathered from one of our present Governor's Minutes, in which, speaking of Irrigation works in the North-east of the Island, he says of one of them, that it must have occupied a million of men for ten or twelve years in its construction.\nThe Portuguese do not appear to have devoted any attention to these matters: we can find no trace of any efforts on their part to improve the agriculture of Ceylon. It is true, the greater part of the ancient works of the Siyhaese monarchs were situated in districts beyond the territories of the Portuguese, but with those which were in their immediate neighbourhood, nothing whatever appears to have been attempted.\n\nThe Dutch, far more skilful as Colonists than their predecessors, and ever mindful of work connected with Agriculture and Commerce, devoted much time and labour to canals, and we have good reason for believing to some of the nearest tanks.\n\nThe only light thrown upon their labours in the matter of Irrigation works, is contained in the despatches of the Dutch Governors, published at intervals; but there is no doubt much more valuable information contained in the Dutch records lying in the almirahs of the Colombo Kachcheri. Several reports on the Giant's and other great tanks, by Dutch engineers, are in existence, and have proved of use in the recent engineering operations of our Government.\n\nAlthough surveys and reports on several important tanks were made in the early part of the British rule, Sir Edward Barnes may be said to have inaugurated Public Works under our Government, by the commencement of the great Kandy Road in 1821. The P\u00e9radeniya Bridge, and other useful works followed, but it was not until coffee had drawn so many enterprising cultivators to the Island, that the Department of Public Works assumed any great importance.\n### STATEMENT of Outlay on Public Works in Ceylon since 1830.\n\n| Years | Roads and Canals | Buildings | Total |\n|-------|------------------|-----------|-------|\n| 1830  | \u00a33,327           | \u00a32,403    | \u00a31,730|\n| 1831  | \u00a33,916           | \u00a34,570    | \u00a38,536|\n| 1832  | \u00a34,651           | \u00a34,549    | \u00a39,200|\n| 1833  | \u00a311,391          | \u00a35,188    | \u00a316,579|\n| 1834  | \u00a317,281          | \u00a37,991    | \u00a325,272|\n| 1835  | \u00a317,111          | \u00a37,088    | \u00a324,149|\n| 1836  | \u00a328,301          | \u00a315,014   | \u00a343,315|\n| 1837  | \u00a343,226          | \u00a311,552   | \u00a354,778|\n| 1838  | \u00a322,468          | \u00a35,488    | \u00a328,958|\n| 1839  | \u00a37,820           | \u00a33,393    | \u00a311,213|\n| 1840  | \u00a316,921          | \u00a34,957    | \u00a321,878|\n| 1841  | \u00a326,410          | \u00a36,936    | \u00a333,346|\n| 1842  | \u00a320,655          | \u00a35,963    | \u00a326,618|\n| 1843  | \u00a320,906          | \u00a33,443    | \u00a324,349|\n| 1844  | \u00a338,302          | \u00a36,180    | \u00a344,482|\n| 1845  | \u00a356,192          | \u00a310,123   | \u00a366,316|\n| 1846  | \u00a363,313          | \u00a316,748   | \u00a380,061|\n| 1847  | \u00a370,711          | \u00a315,672   | \u00a386,383|\n| 1848  | \u00a340,239          | \u00a313,793   | \u00a354,032|\n| 1849  | \u00a342,227          | \u00a36,822    | \u00a349,049|\n| 1850  | \u00a349,196          | \u00a38,205    | \u00a357,401|\n| 1851  | \u00a357,830          | \u00a34,021    | \u00a361,351|\n| 1852  | \u00a356,440          | \u00a313,176   | \u00a369,616|\n| 1853  | \u00a355,849          | \u00a34,973    | \u00a360,822|\n| 1854  | \u00a352,131          | \u00a35,654    | \u00a357,785|\n| 1855  | \u00a363,830          | \u00a38,773    | \u00a372,111|\n| 1856  | \u00a377,729          | \u00a318,300   | \u00a396,029|\n| 1857  | \u00a3102,261         | \u00a331,037   | \u00a3133,298|\n\n**THE following are the miles of roads made during various periods:**\n\n- Previous to 1820: 108 miles.\n- During:\n  - 1821: 212\u00bd\n  - 1824: 54\n  - 1828: 55\n  - 1831-33: 162\n  - 1834-36: 99\u00bd\n  - 1837-40: 11\u00bd\n  - 1841: 86\u00bc\n  - 1842: 67\u00bd\n  - 1843: 158\u00bd\n  - 1844: 171\n  - 1845: 177\n  - 1846: 158\u00bd\n  - 1847-49: 81\u00bd\n\nThe operation of the Road Ordinance since its introduction in 1848, has, perhaps, done more for the prosperity of Ceylon than any other measure we could name. Thoroughly popular amongst the natives, it has opened up tracts of country hitherto unavailable for wheeled traffic; and has enabled the\npopulation of many districts to find a market for their produce that was before left useless on their hands. It would be perhaps impossible to over-rate the value of this measure.\n\n**STATEMENT of Outlay on Public Works in Ceylon, during 28 years, compared with Ordinary Expenditure.**\n\n| Years       | Average Revenue | Average Expenditure | Expenditure on Roads | Expenditure on Buildings | Total | Proportion to Gen.

Carpenter Rowe, Chief Justice, in the Chair.\n\nThe Secretary proceeded to read the following\n\nREPORT FOR 1858-9.\n\nIn placing their Report for the past year before the Society, the Committee desire, in the first place, to express the satisfaction they feel in being able to assemble in rooms placed at their disposal by the liberality and consideration of the Governor.\n\nThe want of proper accommodation for their Museum and their Meetings had long been felt; but it was not until the position of the Society was brought to the notice of His Excellency, by the Deputation which waited upon him for the purpose, that this most desirable object was attained. Your Committee have also to report the liberal grant of \u00a3200 from the public funds, made by the Government to the funds of the Society, to enable it to extend and improve its Museum and Library.\n\nAt the interview which His Excellency the Governor accorded to the Deputation, they received the strongest assurances of countenance and aid which they could have desired. In consequence of this interview, a paper drawn up by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, was forwarded to the Governor, who, in addition to the favours already mentioned, gave permission to the Committee to transmit, through the medium of the Colonial Secretary to the Government Officials at outstations, a Circular, drawing attention to the many ways in which persons in various parts of the Island might assist the Society in its labours, by information, by papers, or by objects for its Museum.\n\nCopies of the Circular, and the papers which accompanied it, are to be found in the Appendix accompanying this Report; sufficient time has scarcely elapsed since the Circular was distributed, to allow of any results from it, but your Committee cannot too strongly express the hope that, if it be received by those to whom it is addressed in a proper spirit, much good may result. The opportunities presenting themselves to gentlemen at outstations, of collecting data respecting their districts on matters interesting to this Society, must be many; and through such, it is hoped, the cooperation of Native Headmen and others may be secured, in procuring suitable objects for the Museum.\nHaving so recently obtained possession of the present building, the Curator of your Museum has not been able to accomplish much as yet. A commencement has, however, been made, with the Raw Products of the Island; and it is hoped, that during the present session, this collection may be made complete and interesting. Your Committee believe they are not wrong in assuming, that the natural products of a country form the most interesting portion of its wealth, since from them spring so many branches of industry and commerce. As yet but little has been done towards developing the riches which it is believed may be found hidden amidst the jungles of the Southern and North-Western Provinces, as well as in the forests and plains of the Eastern and Northern Provinces. Evidences are not wanting to shew that Ceylon is rich in Gums, Dye-stuffs, Resins, Tanning substances, and many other articles of considerable commercial value; and, it is thought, that one of the duties of this Society should be, to give a place in its Museum to all articles likely to prove interesting to the man of science, the trader, or the manufacturer.\n\nYour Committee have received through the Honorable the Colonial Secretary, the Prospectus of an Inter-Colonial Exhibition, proposed to be held in the Mauritius in the month of August of the present year. They would gladly have taken an active part as far as practicable in this Exhibition; but felt that the notice was so short, that it would have been impossible to have collected any contributions during the brief period allowed.\n\nThey have also received very recently from this Government, a Circular letter, addressed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State to the Governors of Colonies, on the subject of a communication from the Society of Arts and Manufactures, who are anxious to open a correspondence with public bodies in the British settlements, relative to the resources, condition, and development of the trade, &c., of the various British Colonies. Your Committee have referred this correspondence to a Sub-Committee of Arts and Manufactures, consisting of the Honourable the Chief Justice, C. A. Lorenz, Esq., the Revd. J. Thurstan, and the Secretary, in whose hands the matter is left, and who will take upon themselves to communicate with the Society of Arts on the Subject of their Circular.\n\nDuring the year now terminated, the Society received additions to its Members to the number of 19; whilst the vacancies, caused by departures and deaths, amounted to 3. The total of Members at present borne on the books of the Society is 87, a large number than it could boast of at any previous period.\n\nThe Treasurer will place before you a statement of the present condition of the Society's funds, from which you will perceive, that\nwhile the receipts since the revival of the Society in November, 1856, have amounted to \u00a3324 4s. 7d., including the Government grant of \u00a3200,\u2014the disbursements have reached the sum of \u00a3116 16s. 5d.; leaving a balance on the 1st January, 1859, in the hands of the Treasurer, of \u00a3207 8s. 10d., subject of course to the expenses of the current year, which have amounted to about \u00a340.\n\nThe printing of the Society's Journal for the current year is in an advanced state, and it is hoped that by the end of the year, the Number will be in the hands of Members.\n\nThe contents of this issue will be found equally interesting with those of any former Number, and it is confidently hoped, that members both here and at outstations, will not fail to contribute such results of their studies and researches as may be likely to prove acceptable to the Society, and of advantage to the public.\n\nThe following is a list of the books, &c., received by the Librarian during the past year:\n\nDonations to the Museum.\n\nSundry Dye Stuffs and Dye Woods from the North-Western Province, from Mr. Mead.\n\nSpecimens of Coir, prepared by Machinery, from Mr. Thomas.\n\nDo. of Kitul Fibre.\nDo. of Medicinal Oils, from Mr. C.

Had such an address been required, it would have\ncome more appropriately from their respected and learned President, Dr. Gogerly, who had contributed the very first paper that had ever been read in that Institution, and whose absence on this occasion he sincerely regretted. Having been called to the Chair, however, in his absence, he felt himself bound to make some brief observations on the able and comprehensive Report which they had just heard,\u2014and especially on that part of it, which commemorated this Meeting of the Society in their own Library and Museum.\n\nOn looking into their Minutes, he found that the want of such accommodation had been for years, not only a cause of regret, but of considerable detriment to the collections, books, instruments, and moral interests of the Society. To meet this emergency, Sir Henry Ward had not only put this building at their exclusive disposal, but had accorded to them also a pecuniary grant from the public funds, in aid of the private resources of the Society.\n\nFrom this day also, as more may reasonably be expected from it, greater zeal, it is to be hoped, will characterise the exertion of its Members.\n\nAn ample field for enquiry and discovery still existed in the vegetable, animal, mineral and industrial capabilities of this beautiful island,\u2014and he had great pleasure in calling their attention to some passages from the interesting work now being published by one of their former residents, Sir Emerson Tennent, in which those capabilities were very fully dwelt upon.\n\nThe report on the mineral productions of the Colony, to which he alludes, is one of much value; and the minerals collected by the author of that report, Dr. Gygax, are now in their Museum. We all know that iron is very widely disseminated through our hills, but he points out a district near Ratnapura, in which, as he says, it may be found in such quantities, and with such facilities of water-carriage to Colombo, that it may be smelted here with English coal, and rendered as pig iron at \u00a36 per ton.\n\nIf he is right in stating, as he does, that anthracite coal may also be raised in considerable quantities in that vicinity, and that the iron itself is of such a quality as not to require the expense of puddling, the cost of manufacture would be so far diminished, as to give reason to hope that these resources might be made practically available for the many public works which are now being carried on around us.\n\nAgain, it was within his own, the Chairman's knowledge, that an English gentleman, who had recently visited Ceylon for Commercial purposes, had, through information given him by the Secretary of\nthis Society, been induced to make researches in our forests and jungles for dyewood, and substances available for tanning, which are there found in great quantities.\n\nHe had already so far succeeded in the North-Western Province, that he had actually chartered a ship of 600 tons direct to Liverpool, which was now taking in a cargo of these new products. His attention having been also drawn to a paper by Dr. Gygax, published in the early transactions of this Society, on the coloring matter found in the husk of the coconut, he had made such practical and successful experiments on the subject, as gave reasonable ground for believing that another most useful product might be added to the many already derived from that valuable tree.\n\nHe mentioned these things as instances only that there was much here yet to explore.\n\nSir E. Tennent's very elaborate work, whilst it established beyond all doubt, by reference to specific authorities, that Ceylon was a great mart in very early times for the interchange of traffic between the Eastern and Western worlds, also demonstrated that the natives themselves were by no means an enterprising or commercial people. The Chinese, who are supposed to have frequented Galle in the fifth and sixth centuries, seem to have obtained no exports here, but gems and images of Buddha.\n\nIt remained for the Dutch, in after times, to develope the Cinnamon trade; and men of the present generation remember the first planting of Coffee, now the great staple of the Island. English capital and English enterprise might yet add other staples to this, from the thousands of acres of forest that had hardly yet been trodden by human foot.\n\nThe report which had been this day read, called their attention to a Circular from the Secretary of State to the Governor, touching a communication from the Society of Arts and Manufactures in London, as to the importance of developing the trade resources of our British Colonies. This shewed the importance attached to such researches at home; and it was in the same spirit that this Society had, some months since, transmitted through the Colonial Secretary's Office at Colombo Circulars to the different outstations\u2014requesting information under the specific heads of natural products, vegetable, animal and mineral, agriculture, irrigation, manures and markets, manufacture and trade, social habits, condition, education, and general statistics of the people. He, the Chairman, was well aware how heavily the duties of official life pressed upon most of our public servants; but still a change of occupation was in itself a relief, and he believed that many a young civilian or soldier, in the solitude of an outstation,\nwould derive the greatest mental profit to himself, by turning his own attention, and that of the native headmen around him, to such subjects as these.\n\nSir E. Tennent, in his book, makes honorable mention of Sir Alexander Johnstone, of Mr. Justice Starke, of Mr. Casie Chetty and others, who had found time amongst their judicial and public avocations, to contribute to the general stock of useful and interesting information touching this Colony. Dr. Gogerly and Mr. Hardy, too, are repeatedly cited by him as the highest authorities on the religion, history, ancient observations, and ancient languages of the natives;\u2014and above all, he prominently puts forward our excellent Member, Major Skinner, whom we see amongst us here today, as the indefatigable executant of Sir Edward Barnes's enlightened project of not only opening up\u2014by the great work of the Kandy road\u2014the resources, but securing the future peace of the whole of the interior of the Colony.\n\nIt could not, then, be too strongly impressed on the public, that every man in his department, either in his own person, or by influencing those about him, might be aiding in this useful work. The statistics of coffee cultivation, the Pearl Fishery, the \u0106rub\u00f3ku dam, the Batticaloa irrigation, the tides and currents so seriously affecting the circumnavigating existence of our Colonial steamer; the state of the elements and atmosphere, so sensibly deranged at every recurring monsoon; and even the expeditions of the sportsman, if also a naturalist, all afforded opportunity and matter for observation and valuable communications.\n\nNo one could have read the Minutes of the progresses made by our present Governor, through the different Provinces, without being sensible of the great importance attached by him to local researches, and to the development of the material resources of the country. Those Minutes, His Excellency had caused to be presented to our Library, and the Chairman trusted that such an example would not be lost on those who had it in their power, by the acquirement and communication of extensive local information, to establish for themselves one of the best claims for Colonial advancement.\n\nHe concluded by moving that the Report be received and adopted.\n\nCarried nem. con.\n\nProposed by the Honourable the Chief Justice.\nSeconded by C. A. Lorensz, Esq.\n\n\"That the thanks of the Asiatic Society of Ceylon, are eminently due to Sir H. G. Ward, as the first Governor of this Island, who, by assigning a public building exclusively for a Museum and Library, and by a grant of public money in aid of its funds, has given to this Society the position of a Colonial Institution.\"\n\"That whilst they tender their thanks in this behalf, the Members of the Society also bear in mind, that no Papers have been published of late years in this place, containing matter more interesting and useful than the Minutes of the progresses of Sir H. G. Warl himself, through the different Provinces of his Government; and, inasmuch as it has pleased him to cause a copy of those Minutes to be deposited in this Library, they, with much pleasure accept them, not only as a record of what can be done by an enterprising Governor for the benefit of the governed, but as an incentive to the Members of Her Majesty's Services, to lend their aid by contributing objects of interest and occasional papers to this institution, in developing the natural resources of the Colony.\"\n\nCarried unanimously.\n\nThe following Gentlemen were then balloted for, and declared duly elected Members of the Society: the Honorable W. C. Gibson, Esq., A. W. Baylis, Esq., N. Schultze, Esq., H. Mead, Esq.\n\nResolved, that the Secretary be requested to place himself in communication with gentlemen at outstations, likely to interest themselves in the advancement of the Colony, in co-operation with the Society.\n\nResolved, that the following Gentlemen be the Office-bearers for the ensuing year:\n\nPresident:\nSir W.

This Society has always taken a deep interest in the welfare of the Colonies, and if the information sought was obtained, the Council would propose to hold periodical meetings of this Society to discuss it, devoting, say one meeting to each Colony, and publishing accounts of such meetings in the Society's Journal, which is issued weekly, and distributed without charge among the Members, upwards of two thousand in number.\n\nThe Council conceive that such information would be reciprocally useful to the Colonies and to this Council, and that much useful knowledge for commercial purposes would be then circulated, which would be otherwise likely to remain dormant.\n\nThe Council direct me respectfully to request, if you should approve of what is proposed, that the Colonial Office may forward to the Governors of the Colonies, letters from the Council of this Society, with a recommendation to the Governors to give effect to the wishes of the Council. The Council, in addressing the Governors of Colonies, would request them to ascertain what competent persons in each Colony would be willing to furnish such a report as is suggested, and to put him in direct communication with the Society.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) P.

B. Lytton's wish to aid their project to the fullest extent of his power. But he fears that in most of the Colonies, the Society is at present too developed to allow of individuals, or public bodies being found, who could effectually correspond with the Council on the topics proposed. The Council are also, no doubt, fully aware that the Secretary of State cannot require the dedication of any public funds in the Colonies to this purpose. Subject, however, to these observations, Sir Edward will readily act in the matter as the Council may wish, and will be prepared to transmit to the several Colonial Governors (with the necessary recommendation on his part) such papers as the Council may furnish him for this purpose.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\n(Signed) Carnarvon.\n\nP.

I believe that a decrease of bodily vigour, shewing itself in more or less disinclination to exertion, is the only unavoidable result of a residence here, and even this applies only to some parts of the Island, where we find\nthe atmosphere at the same time hot and loaded with moisture, a combination which is always especially relaxing to the constitution.\n\nOf course sportsmen and others whose occupation leads them to unhealthy districts, must expect to be liable to fever; but any one sleeping in a tent night after night among the marshes of Essex, or the fens of Lincolnshire, would be equally so. Medical men do not meet with half the diseases in this Island which they are accustomed to see in England, and the most common complaints occurring here, viz., fever and dysentery, are generally so easily cured, when properly treated at their commencement, that I cannot but conclude, that to self-neglect is to be attributed a very large proportion of the deaths among our countrymen in Ceylon.\n\nThere is, however, another cause, and I fear a nearly equally great cause of mortality among the adult male portion of the community. I allude to the far greater indulgence in spirituous liquors which obtains here among young men, over what the same class are accustomed to in England. I am sure that any one, on recalling the deaths among male Europeans which have taken place within his memory, will at once admit the truth of this assertion, that drink has had, directly or indirectly, a large share in the mortality. The constitution becomes undermined by the constant indulgence in this habit, and is unable to resist the attack of what might otherwise have been a trifling complaint. I believe that the custom of taking spirits and water regularly twice a day, on board ship on the voyage out from home, is one great cause of this; and when we consider the solitary life often led by Planters on Coffee Estates, it is hardly to be wondered at that the habit thus acquired should be difficult to break through.\n\nI believe that the mode of diet of Europeans in India generally, is very much against a continuance of good health: and here I feel that I am entering on a subject which must necessarily meet with some opposition; for there are few\ntasks more difficult than that of convincing people that they are wrong in habits, which time and custom have led them to consider as necessary to their existence.\n\nNow, there is no greater error than an idea, which is by no means an uncommon one, that we need a larger supply of animal food in hot climates, than in temperate ones. The reverse is the truth, and there is no better proof of this than in the fact, that we continually see people obliged to have recourse to bitters, before they can induce an appetite to enable them to consume their food, nature evidently resisting this overloading of the system with an unnecessary amount of nourishment. Why is it that we fancy hot curries, chutnee, and stimulants of a similar kind? Not, as I shall presently endeavour to shew, because they are the natural or necessary food of a hot country, but because we find again the stimulus of the chillies and spices necessary to enable us to get through the meal; the stomach becoming thereby incited to attempt to digest more food than is good for it. I really believe, that eating in India is very frequently, or I should say very generally, more a means of passing time than a necessity, and that in proportion as we are enabled to take a larger amount of bodily exercise, we shall find the taste for stimulants of the curry kind diminish. More occupation for the mind, and increased means of amusement, so often wanting in English societies in India, would probably conduce to the same effect.\n\nMany will answer my arguments, by saying that Providence has suited the food of different countries to their inhabitants, and that we, as inhabitants of India, cannot err in following the manner of living, and the diet of the natives.\n\nNow this results from an extremely superficial view of the matter, for, with few exceptions, the food of any nation depends, not on the climate, but on the state of civilization of that nation. Providence has provided suitable food for the lower animals, because they are not gifted with reasoning powers, but merely with instinct, that is, with a faculty\nwhich is incapable of further development; therefore it was necessary that their instinct should guide them at once to the description of food which is exactly suited to their wants. But on man a mind has been bestowed, which he is expected to make use of in bettering his own condition and that of his fellow-creatures, and thus we see, that as a nation passes from a savage to a civilized state, that not only the arts and sciences, but the general manner of living and feeding, pass through progressive stages of development.\n\nThere is one exception perhaps to this law, in the case of the inhabitants of the Polar regions; but it is an exception that goes to prove the rule, for these countries, from the nature of their climate, may perhaps be said to be incapable of change or improvement, and their inhabitants are so far placed on a level with the lower animals, for the only food which they can obtain is such as is best suited to sustain life and bodily heat; and we find their taste, consequently, directed to such food as train oil and blubber, without which they would be unable to maintain a healthy existence in the intense cold of the Arctic regions.\n\nTherefore I say, that the exception in the case of these people, helps to prove the general rule, that we must not be guided in our choice of food, in most countries, by the present diet of their inhabitants. The climate of the Polar regions is such that, in all probability, no great progress can ever be made in their state of civilization, and consequently, we see that Providence has given them an inclination to a description of food exactly suited to their wants.\n\nNow, the climate and soil of all other countries, admit of more or less application of the progressive improvements in agricultural science, therefore, though in the uncivilized state of some nations, we may find them existing, in one case on raw or putrid fish, as on some parts of the West Coast of Africa: or, in another case, consuming for food their own species, as among cannibals; we are not, if our lot happens to be cast in these countries, to consider it best for our health to follow\nthe example of the natives, but we should follow the suggestions of our own more advanced state of civilization.\n\nWe now return to the question of the propriety of the ordinary diet of Europeans in India. We find among the natives a very general use of hot spices, chillies, and such stimulants; but what encouragement does their condition present to us, to imitate them? We see them, for the most part, a weak and indolent race, disinclined to the least extra exertion, and when attacked by disease, much sooner succumbing to it than Europeans. They are, occasionally, perhaps induced to exert themselves under the hope of a reward, but then, though a casual observer might think them capable of enduring a large amount of fatigue, they will generally be found to suffer from it afterwards.\n\nThese remarks of course apply principally to the working classes, who form, I imagine, at least nine-tenths of the population of India,\u2014and these, it must be admitted, frequently suffer much from insufficient or bad food; but still their \"boiled rice,\" with even a very small quantity of vegetable or fish, contains fully as much nourishment as the potatoes on which the poorer class of Irish, in many cases, almost entirely subsist; and yet an Irishman will, I will venture to say, do three times the amount of work in a day, that can be got out of a cooly, or a Singhalese workman.\n\nTo this some, perhaps, will say, but what amount of work would the Irishman do on a Coffee Estate under a hot sun? My reply would be, put them both under similar conditions, that is, the Irishman under a hot sun in India, and set the cooly to work in Ireland in the winter, and I think it would then be found that the Irishman would still do three times as much work as the native of India.\n\nNow, I think that the deduction from this must be, that there is something in the food of the natives here that interferes with the proper digestion and distribution of the actual amount of nourishment which they consume; and I can imagine nothing better calculated to effect this, than\na continual stimulation of the digestive organs by hot pepper, spices, &c., especially when we consider the constitutional change which is always effected by habits of any kind, continued from generation to generation.\n\nWith regard to the use of a meat diet by inhabitants of hot countries, we find that there is very often some provision in the laws of their religion, which tends to diminish the supply of animal food. Thus, among the Hind\u00fas the cow is sacred, among the Jews the pig is forbidden as food, and the Siphalese are not, or were not, permitted to eat beef. Now we find no such laws among the inhabitants of cold climates, and may, I think, reasonably conclude, that these ordinances, like some other religious ceremonies among Mohammedans, were originally instituted for the health of the people; who, otherwise, from the elementary state of knowledge at the earlier periods of the world, might have committed excesses, which in time would have produced the degeneration and eventual destruction of the race.\n\nThe medical science, however, of the present day, explains why one particular diet should be suited to a hot, and another to a cold country. Respiration serves two principal purposes in the human body, it purifies our blood by carrying off from it a substance called carbon, in the form of carbonic acid gas, and at the same time maintains, by a chemical process, the natural heat of the body. Now respiration is quicker in a cold climate or in cold weather than in a hot climate, that is, in a given time we perform a greater number of inspirations and expirations in cold weather than in hot. Now, although in a hot climate there is less work for the lungs in maintaining the temperature of the body, as that of the surrounding atmosphere is so great, still the purification of the blood requires to be carried on; and so, if we still introduce as much carbon into the system in the shape of food, we shall find that as the lungs do not act so frequently, the carbon must accumulate in the blood, or be got rid of by some other means; now this other means of disposing of it is through the liver, which thus has an extra amount\nof work thrown on it, and disease is produced unless we adopt one of two courses. We must either increase the action of the lungs, which we may do by active exercise, or we must decrease the amount of food, especially those articles of food which contain most carbon, such as rich and fat meats and spirituous liquors. This fact is well-known by those who supply the unfortunate geese, whose livers make the celebrated *pat\u00e9s de foie gras*. They treat them exactly as many of us treat ourselves in India. They are confined in a hot atmosphere, allowed to take no exercise, and crammed with quantities of rich food. Many, no doubt, are aware of this, and never think of applying it to their own case. I have heard the same person at one moment expressing an opinion that we required here a large amount of animal food to keep up our strength, and, shortly after, dilating on the impropriety of feeding dogs on meat in a hot climate, as it would inevitably kill them.\n\nI will now endeavour to point out by what means, in my opinion, we may best preserve our health in this country. The first thing, without doubt, is a sufficiency of bodily exercise, riding or walking\u2014especially the latter; the best time for this being the early morning: it is within the power of all of us to obtain this. Cold bathing I need hardly mention, as it is a thing few or none of us neglect; but the time at which we should bathe is of some consequence, the best time being in the morning, immediately after the ride or walk,\u2014always before a meal, never soon after: the fact of being warm from active exertions offers no objection to the use of the cold bath, that is, we may without danger go under a spout of cold water in a state of active perspiration from violent exercise. The only reason for avoiding sudden immersion in cold water, is, where we are exhausted from fatigue, and the temperature of the body is fast cooling down. Avoid as much as possible exposure to the sun, never going out in the heat of the day without an umbrella, or a board-brimmed pith hat. It is by no means uncommon to see Europeans in Ceylon, with nothing on their heads\nbut a Glengarry bonnet, or a small cloth cap, under a burning sun. The wearer, in these cases, can only expect what he deserves, a sun stroke or disease of the liver.\n\nEndeavour as much as possible to avoid a stimulating diet, and heavy late meals, and observe moderation in, not abstinence from, wine, beer, and spirituous liquors. It is almost useless to say anything against late dinners, as the occupation of most people is such as to prevent any alteration in the time at which they take their meals. It is one of the evils inseparable from a state of high civilization, that health is continually sacrificed to temporary advantage; and the more successful that a man is in his business, the less successful he will probably be in the preservation of his health. The quality of our food, however, is nearly always under our control. We are seldom forced to eat what does not agree with us, and, I believe, that if we partook of animal food once only during the day, it would be the better for us; and we should avoid highly-spiced and rich fat dishes; in fact, nature as plainly as possible seconds this advice, for we find the animals of the country peculiarly destitute of fat, while the same animals in cold countries, are, when in a state of health, loaded with it. As far as they themselves are concerned, this is, of course, also a provision of nature dependent on temperature of climate.\n\nChildren here are sometimes most improperly fed: I have seen them literally crammed twice or three times a day with meat and curries, to say nothing of little interludes in the shape of biscuits, plantains, &c., the anxious parent all the while wondering why they look so pale, and of course throwing all the blame on the unfortunate climate. It never occurs to her for a moment that the children's digestive organs might possibly be the better for an occasional ten minutes rest; it is not to be wondered at that they have to be sent home after a year or two of this treatment. Children in this climate should most certainly\neat meat but once in the day, and curries I look upon as slow poison to them, unless they are made without most of the usual constituents of a curry.\n\nI have already said that the diseases of most common occurrence in Ceylon, are, if properly attended to at their commencement, generally very easily cured; at the same time complaints which in England would be considered trifling, and might be often neglected without ultimate injury, will not bear the same neglect here, and may soon become serious and permanent. Therefore, we should always apply for medical aid at the first intimation of any departure from our ordinary state of health. Avoid quack medicines and popular remedies, such as \"Cholera Drops,\" the virtues or rather vices of these latter, always depending on the presence of laudanum or opium in some form, which in my opinion is poison in genuine Cholera, and hardly ever necessary, but on the contrary hurtful, in ordinary bowel complaints among Europeans. Any remedy, too, containing opium, is especially objectionable in unprofessional hands, as a medicine for children. A child of nine months old has been killed by four drops of laudanum, and one of four and-a-half years by one-third of a grain of opium; in another case, a drop and-a-half of laudanum proved fatal to an infant, and yet I have seen printed directions in this country for the cure of Dysentery, recommending indefinite doses of \"Dover's powder,\" which contains opium, without any such warning concerning children as that I have just given.\n\nI have noticed a rather prevalent habit among our countrymen in the Island, of taking quinine whenever they fancy themselves to be what they call feverish. Now, although this may do no particular harm, yet it can hardly ever be productive of much good, and may interfere with the proper action of the medicine when it is really required. There is only one case, I think, where quinine is likely to be of service when taken without medical advice, and this is when we are obliged to pass a short time in a\npart of the country particularly subject to fevers, and then three or four grains of quinine taken in coffee in the morning will, I believe, give us a very good chance of escaping an attack. This medicine, in skilful hands, is to fever as water is to fire, but when given at improper times, or in insufficient doses, it is generally worse than useless. Change of air is another remedy of great benefit to invalids, but is often much abused and misunderstood. A sea voyage is, unless peculiar circumstances forbid it, generally the best change from this climate; not to the coast of India, or any place still hotter than Ceylon; such a change can seldom be of any use. A trip by sailing vessel to Mauritius, Australia, or the Cape, will generally be the best; and the worst of all changes, unless the person is convalescent, and able to bear much fatigue, I consider to be the Overland Journey home. It is astonishing, after the numerous deaths that have occurred among invalids on this route, that any medical men should still be found to advise their patients to risk their lives by such a proceeding. The journey is most fatiguing to any one, and doubly so to an invalid. I can only conceive one circumstance which can justify the adoption of the Overland Journey by a person seriously ill, and that is when recovery is impossible, and the patient has a wish, at any risk, to die among his or her friends at home. Of course, there are instances where a permanent cure is best effected by the change to the climate of Europe, but the sick person should at any rate possess a sufficiency of strength and convalescence, to enable him to bear the excitement and fatigue of the journey; and if this cannot be brought about by proper medical attention here, I fear it must very frequently happen that the patient will not reach home alive. It is seldom, perhaps, that medical attendance is to be had on a voyage hence to Australia or round the Cape; but I really believe, that in nine cases out of ten, the patient in this case would have a better chance without a Doctor, than on the Overland Journey with a dozen.\nA few words in conclusion, on the change of locality, to be obtained by invalids within the Island. To those living in the interior, a visit to Colombo will, in nearly all cases prove, except during the hottest months, a most salutary change. I believe, however, the advantage of Nuwara Eliya as a sanitary station to be rather overrated. I cannot speak from personal observation, but from the description of others, it is apparently excessively damp; and the great range of temperature during the twenty-four hours, from actual frost at night, to tropical heat during the day, leads me to think that there are many places, at a lower elevation, far more generally adapted as a residence for invalids. Of all parts of the Island which I have as yet visited, the Kelebokka Valley is certainly that to which I should be inclined to send any patient of mine, to whom a change from the low country was necessary. I have seen the thermometer there down to $49^\\circ$ in the early part of the year, a temperature sufficiently low for invalids who have probably been residing in an atmosphere, where the thermometer seldom stood below $70^\\circ$.\n\nChange for the mind is, however, often nearly as efficacious in producing a return to health, as change of locality; and it is for this reason that I am inclined to think highly of Mauritius, as we may there obtain those social amusements in which our Island is unfortunately so deficient, and which I feel sure form no unimportant element in the preservation of health in this climate, where, as I have before said, almost the sole amusements to which many can look forward after the labours of the day, are the pleasures of the table.\nCINNAMON.\n\nBY JAMES D'ALWIS, ESQ.\n\nCONSIDERABLE doubt was, sometime ago, raised by Sir James Emerson Tennent,* as to the opinion generally entertained by Botanists and Historians,\u2014that \"the Cinnamon plant is indigenous to Ceylon.\" During the prosecution of his inquiries upon the matter, my attention was invited to the subject; and the result of my investigations is embodied in the following extracts of a letter which I addressed to him, and which, from the peculiar interest which attaches to the question in a historical point of view, I beg to lay before this Society.\n\nIf Cinnamon (Laurus Cinnamomum, Lin. Cinnamomum Zeylanicum, Nees.) were introduced into Ceylon from the neighbouring Continents of Asia and Africa, it is but reasonable to expect that it is still to be found in them. It is not a little curious, however, that no Cinnamon grows in the latter\u2014at least in the vicinity of Abyssinia, which is described by travellers as possessing a soil anything but favorable to the growth of Cinnamon.\u2020 It is also, I believe, a fact, that during the Dutch Government in Ceylon, Java was not considered to produce either Cinnamon\u2021 or Cassia, though, doubtless, the latter was found in a wild state:\n\n* He has embodied the result of his researches in his \"History of Ceylon,\" vol. i. p. 599, et seq.\n\n\u2020 Speaking of \"the Eastern Coast of Africa to the unknown regions,\" Laurent, in his Ancient Geography, describes it as \"those parched lands over which Arabs roved in former days as in the present.\"\u2014p. 348.\n\n\u2021 In the year 1827, twenty-five boxes of Cinnamon plants, besides a considerable quantity of seeds, were introduced into Batavia, smuggled from Ceylon, by an agent in the service of the Dutch Government.\u2014See Asiatic Journal, 1827, vol. xvi. pp. 282-3.\nand it is generally believed that all the Cassia which is exported from Malabar, Java, and even China, is the produce of trees cultivated in those countries within the last half-century. Buchanan, in his \"Account of Mysore,\" (vol. II. p. 512, &c.,) thinks the spice grown in the Continent to be \"without doubt the Laurus Cassia of Linn\u00e6us.\"* Even under the Portuguese Government, we learn from Ribeiro (Lee's Translation, p. 141,) attempts were made to improve the quality of the spice grown at Quilon, and in the forests of Porca; but none could be made to compete with that of Ceylon in taste or in fragrance: and you will find that Lee also quotes from Lord Bacon, to shew that half a century earlier than Ribeiro, Cassia was used as a substitute for Cinnamon.\u2020\n\nIt is not a little remarkable that Colebrooke in his Amara koshla, and Professor H. H. Wilson in his Sanskrit Dictionary, give \"woody Cassia\" as the signification of the Sanskrit terms \"twak-patra, mutkatan, brungan, twachan, ch\u00f3chan, var\u00e1ngakan;\" which are synonymous terms. I observe too, from your remarks to me, that the result of your reading also tends to the same conclusion\u2014that what the Arabian and the Persian ships produced in ancient times on their return from India, was Cassia and not Cinnamon. These are considerations which lead me to believe, that I am correct in representing Ceylon as the only country\u2021 which\n\n* In Arian's history of Alexander, although Cinnamon is mentioned as \"the produce of a shrub,\" yet of Cassia alone it is stated that it \"grew there\" (in India)\u2014vol. ii. p. 166.\n\n\u2020 \"Nard and Cassia balmy smells.\"\u2014Milton.\n\n\"Let balm and Cassia send their scent From out thy maiden monument.\"\n\nHerrick's \"Dirge of Jephtha.\"\n\n\u2021 \"The Java Cinnamon is far superior to the Malabar both in quality and appearance, but is not so handsome in the bale as that of Tellicherry, which is always well packed and with clean joints, whilst that from Java is mixed with many false packed canes and ragged joints, and has a stronger drug flavour. Ceylon is superior in every point of view (colour excepted) to every other description of Cinnamon. It is perfect in its fine aromatic flavour, in the thinness and regularity of its bark, the length and cleanness of the joints in each cane, &c., &c. Java Cinnamon has made the nearest approach to the qualifications of Ceylon Cinnamon,\"\nproduces \"Sweet Cinnamon,\" (peni kurundu, Si.), contradistinguished from \"Cassia,\" (nika kurundu, Sip.) If this be so, and I may regard it as a well ascertained fact in natural history, that \"each tract of country in the world has had its own peculiar creation,\" the inference that Cinnamon had its origin in Ceylon, is, I conceive, very probable. It is doubtless from this cause that this spice is so regarded by several writers\u2014that poets have sung of \"spicy breezes\" in connection with \"Ceylon's Isle;\" and that the Island itself is termed \"The Cinnamon Isle.\"\n\nIts claims to this designation seems to derive great support from a Sanskrit \"Catalogue of Botanical names,\" called the Saraswati Nighandura, a production of very remote antiquity, in which, among other designations, Sinhalan occurs as a name for Cinnamon. I find from Wilson's \"Sanscrit Dictionary,\" that this name (in a modified form, Sinhala) is given to Cinnamon even in India\u2014a fact which removes all doubt as to the genuineness of the application, and the origin of the article.\n\nNow, when we bear in mind that nearly all names\n\nalthough it is still a very inferior substitute; it is much weaker in flavour and lacks that fine aroma which is the leading feature in the quality of Ceylon Cinnamon. It is besides very inferior to the quilling.\"\u2014Report of Messrs. Kilby and Co., Brokers, London, October, 1843.\n\n* Bald\u00e6us, in his account of Ceylon, describes Cassia as the third sort of Cinnamon, called by the Portuguese Canel de maria, or 'wild Cinnamon,' which grows likewise on the Coast of Malabar, but is in no esteem.\u2014Ancient Travels, p. 824.\n\n\u2020 Speaking of 'centres of creation,' Dr. Gardner says, (see Lee's Translation of Rebeiro's Ceylon) that \"till the natural prejudices with different parts of the surface of the globe came to be investigated, the attention and accuracy which are peculiar to the philologists and naturalists rested satisfied with the vague idea that all and that in vegetables had originally radiated from a common centre. And this we now know not to be the case; and it can be as safely asserted that every large tract of country has had its own peculiar creation of plants and animals, as that two and two make four, the exception to this general rule being accounted for by disseminating causes in operation.\"\u2014p. 211.\n\n\u2021 It also occurs in another botanical work called the Siddhavans Nighandura.\nthroughout the East are descriptive,* and that this, which is a possessive noun, bears the signification of \"that which belongs to the Sinhalese,\" I am disposed to treat it as a plant indigenous to Ceylon.\u2020\n\nThe objections, however, to this are two-fold; 1st, that although so early as in the days of Moses, \"Sweet Cinnamon\" and \"Cassia\" were known, (Exod. xxx. 23, 24,) \u2021 yet it is not mentioned as a product of Ceylon until after the Muhammadans commenced a traffic in the Indian seas; and 2ndly, that the \"Cinnamon regio\" of the ancients is described as the opposite or Eastern Coast of Africa.\n\nFor obvious reasons I feel a very great diffidence in advancing an opinion upon this part of the subject, and would therefore merely suggest for your consideration whether the non-mention of Cinnamon until after the Muhammadans had commenced to trade with Ceylon, may not fairly be attributed to causes \u00a7 other than the absence\n\n* Thus, tippilli or 'long-pepper,' goes by the name of Maghada (Behar) the country where it was originally found. So likewise China-mul 'caculia cathertica' or China-root is so called after the name of the country from whence it was introduced into Ceylon.\n\n\u2020 With less evidence in its favour, Dr. Gardener would have us believe, that the coconut palm is indigenous to Ceylon.\u2014Lee's Ribeiro, p. 213.\n\n\u2021 Dr. Royle, having indicated the routes of ancient commerce, concludes this part of his subject with some remarks on the place whence the articles were brought into Egypt and Palestine; and he says: \"But Cinnamon and Cassia, nard, calamus, and onycha having been shewn to be peculiar Indian products, known to ancient commerce\u2014there can, I conceive, be no doubt that the West Coast of India, and probably also the Island of Ceylon, were reached even in the early time.\" See Asiatic Journal, vol. xxxviii. p. 156. As between India and Ceylon, we have already shewn that Cinnamon was a peculiar product of the latter country.\n\n\u00a7 It may appear strange that so few of the indigenous productions of Ceylon itself are mentioned; that is to say, only precious stones and pearls, without a single allusion to cinnamon and ivory, with which the island abounds. This apparent inconsistency, however, is removed when we come to consider the very nature of the Sinhalese commerce; and at the same time serves to show the vast extent and importance of the latter. For, as we have already seen, the trade of Ceylon consisted for the most part in the exchange of foreign goods, brought thither in great quantities from distant regions; in comparison with which the sole produce of the Island itself, would seem very trifling and insignificant. Besides, cinnamon grew only in the interior, and not in the northern parts of the Island, to which alone Sopater's visit was confined; and we\nof the article itself in Ceylon, viz., to a deceit practised by the Chinese, who seem to have had before that period a monopoly of trade in the Indian Seas. It is also important to investigate with clearness, whether by \"the Eastern Coast of Africa,\" a part of Asia* was not meant; or whether the former was at this time a port at which the Chinese vessels touched, and from whence the spice itself was exported to other ports in exchange for European and Egyptian merchandise. The great value too, which was set on this article may seem to have influenced the Chinese, like the Arabs who traded in the Red Sea, to withhold the name of the country from whence they obtained it\u2020 and, it may not be improbable, on the other hand, (if the Chinese did not conceal the fact,) that the Greek writers took for granted without much inquiry, that the spice, which they procured from the East Coast of Africa, was a product of those regions.\u2021\n\nThe inaccuracies into which the ancient writers seem to have fallen with regard to the Geography of the Eastern Coast of Africa, and the opposite regions in Asia, may also intimate to us such a want of information in the Greek writers, as to render a mistake on their part possible, and indeed too probable; for, amongst a great many errors\n\nmust also recollect, that at this early period, gardens appropriated to the cultivation of cinnamon were not yet in existence.\"\u2014Heeren's Historical Researches, ii. p. 425.\n\n* It would also seem that the ancients \"confounded Egypt with Abyssinia.\"\u2014See Sir William Jones's Works, vol. i. p. 274. Also Wilford's Essay on Egypt, in Supplement to vol. ii. of the same work, p. 544.\n\n\u2020 \"The Coast of Ethiopia, from the straits to the eastern headland of Aromata, was much better known after the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus than it is now to us Europeans.\"** There is no doubt that the Arabian possessions must have extended still farther south, perhaps to Madagascar, but they concealed their knowledge from the Greeks.\"\u2014Laurent's Ancient Geography, pp. 349-51.\n\n\u2021 \"The Venetians are thought to have carried on their trade to India with greater advantage than any other nation ever did. They had no direct intercourse with that country, but purchased the commodities of the East, imported by the Mohammedans into Egypt and Syria.\"*** Neither the Greeks nor Romans seem to have visited the more Eastern parts of it (India). They procured the productions of those countries only at second hand.\"\u2014Dr. Adam's Ancient Geography and History, pp. 512-3.\nenumerated in Wilford's \"Essay on Egypt\" and other adjacent countries (see Sir W. Jones's Works, ii. p. 493, et seq.), we find that a \"part of Africa was called India by the Greeks, that Theophylact thought that the Nile flowed through Lybia, Ethiopia and India\" (p. 544); that Strabo considered that the people of Mauritiana were Indians or Hind\u00fas; that middle India was called Abyssinia in the times of Marco Polo; and that Pliny placed Madagascar on the east of Ceylon.\n\nAs for the silence of the Ceylonese, it is not at all amazing to me, that a people little accustomed to traffic, and setting no value upon the bark which they did not use either for religious or culinary purposes, omitted to mention the spice in question in any of their books, except their Lexicons or Botanical works, few of which have been spared to us from the ravages of ancient times.*\n\nAnd this leads me to notice briefly the second part of your inquiry, as to \"the uses to which the ancient Siyhalese applied this spice.\" Sacrificial offerings, for which in ancient times Cinnamon was used by other nations, were not known to the Siyhalese. Indeed, they seem to have regarded it as fit only for medicine. Thus, we perceive the plant spoken of, not only in Indian medical books of high antiquity, such as the Shusruta, but also in Sanskrit and P\u00e1li medical writers of Ceylon. The S\u00e1ra\u00f1hasangrah\u00e0 of Buddha D\u00e1sa (A.D. 350,) and the Manjusa (A.D. 1261,)\u2020 both mention Cinnamon as an ingredient used as medicine in cases of \"snake poison,\" \"elephantiasis,\" \"rheumatism,\" &c. Except in modern times, I am not aware that this spice was applied by the Siyhalese to any other use;\u2021 and I am\n\n* \"Although in the few native works at our present disposal there is no particular mention made of spices, yet we cannot possibly doubt of their consumption in the country itself. This silence, however, is merely the effect of accidental causes; for neither Manu or the Ramayana had any special occasion of alluding to the subject.\"\u2014Heeren's Historical Researches, ii. p. 276.\n\n\u2020 Also in the Siyhalese Yogaratn\u00e1laraya, A.D. 1472.\n\n\u2021 I must not, however, omit to state that frequent mention is made in the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1ya of \"scented oils,\" \"spices,\" and \"aromatic oils,\" (see\nunable to ascertain any mention of it in the Sinhalese books except our Dictionaries and the Poets.* (A.D. 1410\u20141815.)\n\nYou will have doubtless read in modern Sinhalese history, that upon the capture of the late Kandyan King, the lamp in his palace was found to contain Cinnamon oil; but this was probably a luxury, the use of which was borrowed from the Dutch.\u2020\n\nBefore concluding these observations, I must not omit to remark that in defining \"Cinnamon tree,\" Prof. Monier Williams in his Dictionary gives the following Sanskrit sentence, which whether quoted from any book of authority, or not, supports the belief generally entertained, that the plant is indigenous to Ceylon\u2014Purvokta tikta, vallkala visishtha Sinhala-dvipa rohi kshudra vriksha\u1e25. \"The aforenamed (is) a small tree (plant) having pungent bark, and grown in the island of Sinhala.\"\n\nIn the following list I have given the significations of the several\n\n**Sanskrit Names for Cinnamon and Cassia.**\n\n1. *Tvatch*, 'skin,' 'bark,' 'rind,' 'peel.'\n2. *Varanga*, 'elegant' or 'superior body.'\n3. *Branga*, 'a golden vase.'\n4. *Chocha*, 'bark,' 'rind,' 'skin.'\u2021\n\n---\n\n*pp. 124, 182,)\u2014probably referring amongst others to Cinnamon, the great fragrance of whose bark was certainly known to the natives, from at least the names given to it (vide the list of names at the end.) I have also carefully examined the text of the Mahavansa, but have found the words too large to enable me to express a decided opinion on the subject.\n\n\u2020 But, Baldeus says, that in the beginning of the siege of Colombo by the Dutch, their \"General received a letter, writ with his Majesty's own hand,\" and that \"it was curiously perfumed with all sorts of spices.\"\u2014Ancient Travels, p. 720.\n\n\u2021 These four and the 6th and the 18th, are given in the Amarakosha; and it is remarkable that they are all rendered 'woody Cassia' by Mr. Colebrooke.\n5. *Shukla*, 'white,' 'clayed-sugar.'\n6. *Utkata*, 'superior,' 'high.'\n7. *Satyhal\u0101* (given by Pr.

C. ONDATJIE, Esq., Assistant Colonial Surgeon.\n\nThe district of Badulla comprehends a no inconsiderable portion of the Central Province; it is in fact of sufficient extent to form a separate Province; and was so regarded when the country was under native Rule; the Government of the District being confided to an officer who bore the title of \"Prince of Uva.\"\n\nThe District is bounded towards Ratnapura by Gurumada; towards Hambantota by Bulatgamaralage Kandura; on the Nuwara Eliya side by the Hakgala range of hills; on the side of the Lower Badulla-road by the Uma-oya; on the Batticaloa side by Padu Kumbura or Madura-oya; on the Maturata side by Halgaran-oya; and on the Wallapana side by Madulla. The physical aspect of the whole district is strikingly beautiful, the country being diversified by chains of bold mountains and by undulating hills, which are separated by deep valleys, and extensive plains covered with lemon-grass and low jungle. Rivers and streams as well as springs abound everywhere, some of them forming beautiful cascades. In fact, the scenery of this part of the country surpasses every other portion of the mountain zone in variety and grandeur.\n\nThe most picturesque view is that from Ella, whence one looks down on the low country, studded as it is with nipple-shaped hills of various sizes, and stretching towards Hambantota. On a clear day, the sea itself is visible, and vessels may be sometimes seen passing along the coast.\nThe hill scenery around the mountain pass of Haputale is unrivalled in magnificence and extent by any other in the Island. Our late Governor, Sir H. G. Ward, has so fully described the view from Haputale, that I quote his own words. He says:\n\n\"I looked with regret, I confess, as I ascended the Pass, probably for the last time, at the magnificent wall of vegetation, towering up the side of the mountain, and about to disappear under the axe of the Planter, while below it, the view embraces the whole M\u00e1gam Pattuwa, with the Kattragam hills in the distance,\u2014the Leeways at Bundela, and the white line of surf, beyond, at Kirinda.\" (Sir H. G. Ward's Minute of Inspection, 1858.) His predictions are being literally fulfilled; already several large Estates have been formed, and the bracing climate will tempt the Planter to remain long here, while the rich soil promises to reward him handsomely.\n\nFrom Wilson's Bungalow the scene is truly delightful, including an extensive view of deep valleys, and rushing streams, smooth grassy hills that undulate in succession, and mountains whose tops are covered with clouds. The Namanakuli mountain may be seen towering above the others on the Badulla side. From Dewihene Bungalow, (now in ruins,) which is 1,767 feet above Badulla, and 4,110 feet above the level of the sea, an extensive view is obtained of the hills and valleys that stretch below, together with the lofty range of the Nuwara Eliya mountains in the long distance.\n\nFrom the Kannavarella Estate we gain a view of the sea; and on a clear day, ships sailing along, may be seen. Altogether the view afforded by the variety of objects here is unsurpassed for grandeur.\n\nFrom Weywelhena Bungalow a full panoramic view of the whole of the valley of Badulla is visible.\n\nFrom Taldana Pass, 4 miles from Badulla, we notice a\nchain of hills, covered with chena cultivation, the highest of which is N\u00e1rangala. The lower Badulla-road also may be seen winding along the Badulla-oya. From many other points grand and interesting prospects of the country may be easily commanded.\n\nThe town of Badulla is 2,600 feet above the level of the sea. It is 156 miles from Colombo via Nuwara Eliya; 84 miles from Kandy; 36 from Nuwara Eliya; 80 from Ratnapura; 76 from Hambantota; and 72 from Batticaloa.\n\n| m. furl. |\n| --- | --- |\n| The distance from Badulla to Attampitiya is | 13 4 |\n| From Attampitiya to Wilson's Bungalow | 11 2 |\n| From Wilson's Bungalow to Nuwara Eliya | 13 0 |\n| From Nuwara Eliya to Ramboda | ... 14 0 |\n| From Ramboda to Pussell\u00e1wa | ... 10 0 |\n| From Pussell\u00e1wa to Gampola | ... 10 3 |\n| From Gampola to Kandy | ... ... 12 5 |\n| Distance from Badulla to Kandy | ... 84 6 |\n\nThe town of Badulla is situated on a mound surrounded by an extensive valley extending two miles and of an elliptic form, and presenting a series of terraced paddy-fields of about 400 acres in extent, irrigated by the Badulla-oya and the hill streams,\u2014the valley being a basin bounded by chains of hills covered with lemon-grass. Through the whole extent of the valley runs the Badulla-cya, a serpentine river. It enters the valley from the south-west, and as it proceeds towards the north, receives the small tributary streams known by the name of the Kud\u00e1-oya, Rambapota-oya, and it finally discharges itself into the Mahav\u00e9ligaya.\n\nThe Badulla hills are of various elevations, from 400 to several thousand feet above the level of the sea, the highest being 6,700 feet: this is called Namunakuli Kanda, and is situated towards the south of Badulla; on its summit the *Rhododendron* is found growing in great abundance.\nROADS AND COMMUNICATIONS.\n\nThe principal roads are the following:\u2014The Nuwara Eliya road, which is the only one that affords the means of uninterrupted communication between Badulla and Kandy; on this road bullock carts may be constantly seen; but it is a very tedious and expensive route.\n\nThe Lower Badulla road; this passes along the Badulla-oya and Mahaveliganga, and over a flat country, and is undoubtedly the shortest to Kandy, being only 56 miles distant. It is intersected by streams which at times are swollen and which therefore render the road impassable during the rainy season. In many places rocks also form serious obstacles, which are not easy to remove so as to make the road passable for carts. The country traversed by this road is thinly populated, owing to the prevalence of fever for which it has gained notoriety.\n\nThe Mudulla road. This is also a short approach to Kandy, but it is steep, narrow and dangerous.\n\nThe Ratnapura, Humbantotta, and Batticaloa roads. These lead to the low country:\n\nThe Ratnapura road runs over a comparatively flat country in a south-west direction. If this road be open for carts it will greatly facilitate communication with Colombo; while there will be provided also a cheap route from it to the Sanitarium of the Island, and in many other respects the country will be benefited. On each side of the road there is rich pasture land. It is studded too with numerous and populous villages. This ought to be the proper outlet for the District.\n\nSir H. G. Ward, who had personally inspected all the different lines of communication with Badulla observes in his Minute of Inspection of 1859, that, \"The Haputale road still continues to be the favorite object of the Planters. The large amount of land sold near Haputale (5,000 acres), and the increase in the Coffee Crops of the\nBadulla District which has risen from 10,000 cwts. in 1855 to 20,000 cwts., and would probably advance much more rapidly, if a better line of communication with Colombo were opened, give to this proposal a greater claim to consideration than it had when first brought before me.\"\n\nThe Hambantota road which runs southward, is in some parts very steep and extremely difficult to be converted into a cart-road.\n\nBatticaloa road. Carts may proceed twelve miles from Badulla: beyond that distance it is a mere jungle path used for tavalams. It proceeds in a north-east direction.\n\nThe minor roads are numerous, branching off in various directions to the villages around.\n\nThe whole aspect of the District is rapidly undergoing great changes. Numerous Coffee Estates are springing up in all the available land adapted for the cultivation of this staple article of the Commerce of this Island: consequently the District is attracting great attention, and it becomes necessary, that its interests be carefully studied. But it must be observed that the improvement of the country has not kept pace with its extent and importance as a Coffee growing district. This has been owing to two causes. The distance from the sea coast is considerable, and travelling by the great mountain pass, via Nuwara Eliya, is both tedious and expensive. the progress therefore, of the District, has been much retarded. It labours under the disadvantages consequent on the want of easier and cheaper transport and the town is not so large and important as it ought to be, considering the large capital laid out in the District for the production of Coffee. The rate of transport is very high; cart hire from Badulla to Colombo varies from \u00a36 to \u00a37 via Nuwara Eliya, and a cart takes longer to reach Colombo than the Overland Mail to England: and even then it is attended with uncertainty and losses, especially during the wet weather. Owing to the expense and difficulty of trans-\nport, trades-people and others are discouraged from settling in Badulla, which of course renders living fearfully expensive, every article of consumption being at an exorbitant price. But with the many difficulties to be contended with, I have yet had the pleasure, since my residence in Badulla, of witnessing many material improvements. New roads and bridges to facilitate communication with the district have been constructed; while the extension of the means of Irrigation is proving of pre-eminent service to the native population. Facilities are thus being afforded for bringing waste land under cultivation, and for the extensive production of paddy, which is the staple article of food among the people.\n\nTo no cause more than the unremitting zeal of the late Assistant Government Agent of Badulla,\u2014and this is acknowledged throughout the District\u2014are the improvements of the works of Irrigation to be attributed.\n\nClimate.\n\nThere are three seasons. First, the Dry weather, which commences in May and continues till the end of August; second, the Wet weather, which extends from September to December inclusive; and the third, the Cold weather, from January to the end of April. Of these four months of cold weather, the first two are the coldest. It may be stated that generally the thermometer ranges $84^\\circ$ in the shade during the usual dry weather: in the rainy season it is about $80^\\circ$ and often in the mornings as low as $58^\\circ$; and in the cold season it is $56^\\circ$, and on the hills it has been observed to be as low as $51^\\circ$.\n\nThe winds blowing in a north-easterly direction are generally cold and bracing, but they become hot and oppressive from May to September, which are the most unhealthy months of the year, especially if there be unusual heat and drought.\nHEALTH.\n\nThe low lands of the District are generally unhealthy, arising chiefly from the scarcity of water and food\u2014causes which have tended to the gradual depopulation of this part of the District. Scrofulous ulcerations are frequently met among the natives of Wollavaya, &c. Those parts of Badulla which stretch towards Hambantota and Batticaloa are well-known as fever generating places.\n\nIntermittent fever, or ague, is endemic in Wollavaya and Wellassa, which have a sandy and barren soil, and where wholesome water is scarce. The disease is become so common with the wretched inhabitants of these localities, that they consider themselves subjected only to a temporary inconvenience during the paroxysm, and when that has passed off they betake themselves to their usual avocations. Many of them have enlarged spleen as the consequence of protracted suffering from ague, and present the peculiar exsanguineous appearance which is characteristic of the disease.\n\nAgue is also prevalent at Kataragama, whither people of every part of the Island and from the neighbouring continent of India, Buddhists as well as Hind\u00fas, resort annually in the month of July on pilgrimage to a D\u00e9val\u00e9, which is sacred to the God Kandasv\u00e1mi.\n\nThe Kataragama fever although generally of the intermittent type, soon merges into the remittent character, and destroys great numbers of the pilgrims, when cholera does not break out among them, as is usual on such occasions.\n\nAccording to the Sinhalese idea of treating some severe cases of fever, no medicine is to be administered until some days have elapsed, when, unfortunately, the fatal symptoms have already supervened. Thus numbers die immediately after their return from the Kataragama festival.\n\nI would here offer a few remarks on an indigenous febrifuge\nplant, which I consider, after extensive and most careful trial, to be an efficacious medicine for fever. This statement may be startling to some, especially as the plant belongs to the *Cucurbitacea*, which have not a single member possessing any febrifuge properties, but as it is well-known, furnish some of the most powerful cathartics of the Pharmacopoeia.\n\nThe plant in question is an annual creeping plant, and is known by the name of *Trichosanthes cucumerina*, Lin.; in Sinhalese it is called Dumm\u00eblla, and grows plentifully in the feverish parts of Uva. It yields to boiling water a bitter principle almost like Gentian or Cherayta. The chemical composition may be thus stated. It contains Tannic Acid, which is also one of the principal constituents of the best kind of Cinchona bark. Bichloride of Mercury throws down a precipitate which is also a test for the Cinchona alkaloids.\n\nAn infusion of the dried plant is the form in which I use it, after the bowels have been freely moved by a dose of Pulv. Jalap Comp. or Senna and Epsom Salts.\n\n*Infusion of Trichosanthes Cucumerina.*\u2014Take of the dried plant, leaves and stem one ounce, boiling-water two pints. Infuse four hours in a covered vessel and strain. I use a copper decoction pot.\n\nDose two ounces, three times daily. It may be given during any stage of intermittent fever; when given in the cold or hot stage, I have found it efficacious in abating the severity of the symptoms. No more than the quantity required for each day ought to be prepared at once, as the infusion begins to ferment when kept beyond a few hours:\n\nThe health of the District is in no small degree owing to the frequent showers of rain that fall over its whole extent. When there is a cessation of these showers, and dry and hot weather succeeds, much unhealthiness is the consequence, and it is then that epidemics break out.\nAs may be expected when there is a deficiency of the pluvial supply, the high temperature thus caused generates malaria,\u2014the surrounding jungle giving rise to this, and sickness thus prevails; whereas showers of rain refresh the air, absorb the malaria rising from the ground, and thus remove morbid influences.\n\nThe people who inhabit the highlands of the District are remarkably healthy and vigorous, being supplied with abundance of water and food.\n\nWith regard to the health of the European settlers, an experience of seven years in medical charge of the station, has convinced me that the climate of the Badulla hills is not inimical to their constitution; for I have had no case of Dysentery or other disease depending on climate, occurring among them; and I think the climate of Badulla is certainly more favourable to the health of the Planters than that of the Kandyan Districts. More healthy, active, energetic men are seldom to be met with anywhere else.\n\n**Population.**\n\nAccording to the Census of 1859, this amounted to 44,642 males and 38,619 females; total, 83,261. The decrease of the population, especially of the low lands, is evident, and is proved by the remains of former Architectural Buildings, which shew that this part of the district of Badulla teemed with a numerous and industrious race of men, whose existence is thus mournfully attested by the traces of a departed greatness.\n\nThe subjoined extract from a Report on the present condition of Bintenna, by J. Bailey, Esq., Assistant Government Agent of Badulla, well describes the condition of the country and the character of the scanty population still surviving amid their ancient ruins.\n\n\"Everything is ruined, and daily becoming more ruined, except the Dagoba, which, during the last three years, there has been a violent...\"\neffort to restore. The jungle is encroaching on the once broad street: the slovenly hovels, wretched enough in their best style, are tumbling down\u2014their walls cracked, their roofs falling in: here and there, a half-built house seems to show an effort at improvement, given up in despair; and, over the place there is an air of desolation, which is inexpressibly melancholy. The people, too, are, for the most part, wretchedly poor and miserably inert.\"\n\n**PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS.**\n\n1. **U\u1e0dukinda**, or Upper \u00dava includes U\u1e0dapal\u0101ta, Dambavinipal\u0101ta, Gampaha K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\n\n2. **M\u00e9dakinda**, or Middle \u00dava, Mah\u00e1pal\u0101ta, Dehivinipal\u0101ta, Kumbalvalapal\u0101ta.\n\n3. **Ya\u1e6dikinda**, or Lower \u00dava, R\u00f3godapal\u0101ta, Rilpapal\u0101ta, Bedulapanguva, Passara K\u00f3ral\u00e9, Kandukara Koral\u00e9, Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dipola K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\n\n4. **Viga\u1e6duwa**, includes Oyapalata, Sora\u1e47\u0101totapalata, Pi\u1e63akola, Etulkolapalata, Palwatta.\n\n5. **Bintenna**, includes Bintenna, Ara\u1e37e\u1e6dipal\u0101ta.\n\n6. **Vellassa**, includes W\u00e9gampattuva, Nilgalapal\u0101ta, M\u00e9dagampattuva, Dambagallapal\u0101ta, Nikave\u1e6dipal\u0101ta, Mah\u0101vedir\u0101ta.\n\n7. **Yatikinda**, includes Buttalarata, Deyanagapaha, Pa\u1e47\u1e0dikkulama, Sittarama and Kataragama, K\u00f3ngala, Bintenna, Kandapalla K\u00f3ral\u00e9, Wellav\u00e1ya.\n\n**Number of Population in each Division framed on an official Return for 1853.**\n\n| Division     | Males | Females | Total |\n|--------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| 1.

Hunu r\u00e1jak\u00e1riya.\u2014To burn lime or chunam. This compulsory duty was performed by the people of the village called Hagilialle and in their own village.\n\n2. Hakuru r\u00e1jak\u00e1riya.\u2014To make jaggery from the kitul palm. A work performed by the villagers of Kumbalvela and in their own village.\n\n3. \u00c1gar\u00e9.\u2014To dig for precious stones. It was performed by the people of Yatapal\u00e1ta at and near Nuwara Eliya, namely:\u2014Vilmane, Sita Eliya, Bopattal\u00e1wa, Lindaoluwa and Palalmene.\n\n4. Pili viyanav\u00e1.\u2014For weaving clothes from a species of shrub cotton which is carried on to this day at Kandapalla. Those of Udapal\u00e1ta performed it in the village itself.\n\n5. Tel r\u00e1jak\u00e1riya.\u2014Collecting oil seeds, which was performed by the people of \u00dava, and the oil extracted and sent to Kandy.\n\n6. Miris r\u00e1jak\u00e1riya.\u2014The people of Viyaluwa were to collect chillies and send them to Kandy.\n\n7. Da\u0142umura-r\u00e1jakariya.\u2014The people of Passara,\nAugoda, Uduvera, Panakana, also from Bombarabotuwa in Sabaragamuwa supplied the King, at Kandy, with betel leaves.\n\n8. Yaka\u1e0da r\u0101jak\u0101riya.\u2014To smelt iron and manufacture steel. This was performed by the people of Kandapalla in their own village, and at Sabaragamuwa.\n\n9. \u1e0davu pangawu.\u2014To make bows, arrows, rice pouders, handles for lances, and flagstaffs which should have been beautifully lacquered. This was made by the people of Wadecona at the same village.\n\n10. Lunu r\u0101jak\u0101riya.\u2014To manufacture saltpetre. The people of Lunugala proceeded to Gampaha for the purpose.\n\n11. Kuruve\u1e6d\u1e6d\u014d.\u2014Elephant suppliers. The people of Tuppittia supplied elephants.\n\n12. Wagapanguve\u1e6d\u1e6d\u014d.\u2014To search for Elephants. The people of Pussalgolle did the work.\n\n13. Aluppanne\u1e6d\u1e6d\u014d.\u2014To blast rocks. The people of Alupanna Kumbura blasted rocks wherever they were called to do so.\n\n14. Sarakku dakvanavi.\u2014To cultivate condiments, &c., such as coriander, cummin, fennel, dill seed, ginger, anise, cress, or rata-aba; peas, kodomba, or barley. The people of Tennekunvela situated in Udukinda Udapalata were to cultivate them. They were also cultivated at Maturata and B\u00f3mbara, near Nuwara Eliya. R\u00e1ja R\u00e1ma was a Malabar who was employed to cultivate the condiments.\n\n15. B\u0113\u1e6dg\u0113.\u2014There were two Medical Stores, one at Badulla and the other at Kandy, which were supplied by the people of Badulla.\n\nAnd a numbers of others of less importance.\n\nCoffee Estates.\n\nThe Coffee Estates lie in two different directions, namely, on the Badulla side, and the Haputale range.\nThose on the Badulla side are:\n\nV\u00e9velhinna ... ... 7\u00bd miles from Badulla\n\u00d3tumba ... ... do ,, do\nPepolgashinna ... ... do ,, do\nGavarak\u00e9l\u00e9 ... ... 8\u00bd ,, do\nPupul\u00e9 or N\u00e1vela ... ... 10\u00bd ,, do\nKannavarella ... ... 12 ,, do\nGavarak\u00e9l\u00e9 East ... ... 12 ,, do\n\nB\u00e9ddegama (Spring Valley) ... ... 7\u00bd ,, do\nBalagala ... ... 3 ,, do\nGlen Alpine ... ... 4 ,, do\nK\u00f3tt\u00e1goda (Maryland) 4 ,, do\nVevessa ... ... 5 ,, do\nDeb\u00e9dda ... ... 8 ,, do\nPassara ... ... 12 ,, do\nG\u00f3n\u00e1k\u00e9l\u00e9 ... ... 12 ,, do\nAuggoda ... ... 12 ,, do\nRedip\u00e1na ... ... 2 ,, do\nElizabeth ... ... 2 ,, do\nHingurugomuva ... ... 3 ,, do\nN\u00e1ragala ... ... 8 ,, do\nUnagala ... ... 3 ,, do\nG\u00f3n\u00e1galtenna ... ... 7 ,, do\nDikbh\u00e9dda ... ... 10 ,, do\nUduvara ... ... 7 ,, do\nK\u00ednak\u00e9l\u00e9 ... ... 12 ,, do\nHindagala ... ... 12 ,, do\nM\u00e1valam\u00e9dda ... ... 3 ,, do\n\nOn the Haputale side are:\n\nKahagolla ... ... 25 miles from Badulla.\nHaputale ... ... 27 ,, do\nSherwood ... ... 28 ,, do\nGalkanda ... ... 29 ,, do\nVih\u00e1r\u00e1golla ... ... 30 ,, do\nFenton ... ... 33 ,, do\nHa'dummulla ... ... 35 miles from Badulla\nLot No. 10 ... ... 35 ,, do\nKalupahana ... ... 35 ,, do\nNeedwood ... ... 37 ,, do\n\n3 Estates opening at Lemastota.\n3 Estates at the back of Wilson's bungalow.\n\nThe elevation of the Estates above the level of the sea, is from 2,400 to 4,800 feet.\n\nThe Badulla Estates which lie in an easterly direction are situated on spurs running out from Namunakuli-kanda, while those in a south-westerly direction are on the Haputale side.\n\nThe quantity of Coffee produced in the district is about 23,000 cwts. The heavy blossom appears in August and September. The principal crop is picked from April to July. A small crop, chiefly from young Coffee, is picked from September to December.\n\nTransport of Coffee.\u2014The produce is sent down to Colombo from April to September. The only road by which Coffee is sent by carts to Colombo is the Nuwara Eliya road. The general rate for a bushel of Parchment Coffee is 2s. A cart can take from 60 to 80 bushels, and in fine weather it reaches its destination after a journey of from 20 to 40 days. The wear and tear on this road are very great, to say nothing of the distance of 156 miles, to be travelled over a steep mountain pass. It is not unusual to see cart loaded with Coffee lying at the bottom of a precipice while the bullocks which had brought them have died from exhaustion. It is not likely that the cost of transport by this route will ever become less. It is sometimes enormous.\n\nThe Hambantota and Batticaloa roads are used for the transport of Coffee by tavalams. For a bushel of Parchment Coffee 1s. is charged; a bullock load is equal to 3 bushels.\n\nA small quantity of Coffee is also sent by the road to Ratnapura. The importance and utility of this road as the proper outlet for the district, are now greater than\never to the planting community, on whom the advancement of the district depends so much. The necessity therefore for opening it for wheel traffic cannot be overrated. With such a road in existence the whole of the Coffee produced in the district will be sent through it, and the serious losses from long detention and consequent damage of the Coffee will be prevented.\n\nThe Coffee which is sent to Hambantota is shipped at that place from October to April, and that which is despatched to Batticaloa, from April to September.\n\nThe rate labour, &c., on the estates varies from 7d. to 9d. per day, and on an average from 4,000 to 5,000 coolies are employed.\n\nRoads to the Estates.\u2014Some of the minor roads to the estates are in an unsatisfactory state. They are not only dangerous to travellers on horseback; but it is even difficult to send down the crop by them from the estates. This is owing to the rocks and the stones which are scattered about, and to the roads being cut up by water during wet weather.\n\nCoffee Land in the Badulla District.\n\n| Namunakuli, &c.: | Acres. |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Lands belonging to private parties | 9,176 |\n| Surveyed, yet unsold | 1,282 |\n| Unsurveyed, belonging to Govt., about | 3,000 |\n\n| Haputale: |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Lands purchased by private parties | 13,196 |\n| Advertised, not sold | 1,539 |\n| Unsurveyed, belonging to Govt., about | 20,000 |\n\n| Wilson's Bungalow: |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Lands purchased | \u2014 |\n\n| Valapana or Udapussellawa: |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Lands purchased | 9,216 |\n| Surveyed, yet unsold | 1,176 |\n| Unsurveyed, belonging to Government, extent unknown | \u2014 |\nNarangala:\n\nLands purchased ... ... ... ... \u2014 1,704\n\nMadulsima, &c.:\n\nUnsurveyed, estimated by a Government Surveyor at 14,000 acres, but believed to exceed ... ... ... ... \u2014 30,000\n\nAcres...90,865\n\n31st December, 1860.\n\nVEGETABLE PRODUCTS.\n\nThe Agricultural productions of the Natives for 1855 and 1859.\n\n| Product       | 1855          | 1859          |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Paddy        | 481,849 bushels | 280,758 bushels |\n| Fine Grain   | 90,316 do.    | 16,593 do.    |\n| Coffee       | 77,197 do.    | 64,579 do.    |\n| Pepper       | 685 do.       | 465 do.       |\n| Mustard      | 16 do.        | 22 do.        |\n| Gram         | 201 do.       | 10 do.        |\n| Indian Corn  | 4,667 do.     | 16,388 do.    |\n| Cotton       | 3,817 lb.     | 1,001 lb.     |\n| Tobacco      | 7,850 do.     | 2,020 do.     |\n| Onions       | 12,550 do.    | 5,800 do.     |\n| Potato       | 100 cwt.      | 8 cwt.        |\n\nThese figures have been obtained from official returns for 1855 and last year.

The existence in the wild state of such plants afford sound foundation for the presumption, that these, when cultivated under similar conditions of climate and soil, will reward the labour of the husbandman.\"\n\nMeal Sago, from the Jaggery Palm.\u2014This is deserving of attention as an article of diet, being found in the district of Colombo also. But a better mode than that known to the natives must be resorted to to render it clean and pure. As prepared by the natives, it is of a brown colour, mixed with pith and the woody fibre of the stem.\n\nA superior article can be manufactured by pounding the pith when fresh, and straining it through cloth in\n\n* J. Forbes Wilson, A.M., M.D., Reporter on the Products of India, in Journal of Society of Arts, 10th May, 1860.\na large vessel containing water. A good deal of astringent matter will be found in the starch, to which it gives a brown colour. This may be removed by mixing the starch with the white of eggs, which precipitates the tannin, and by straining again the fine pure starch may be obtained. It will be found more glutinous than common sago.\n\nIn the month of January, during the rainy weather, the Kitul abounds with starch, which, however, is not found in every tree. The natives discover its presence in a tree by the whiteness of its leaves and petiole, also by boring a hole in the stem and extracting the pith. The Sinhalese make use of the flour for food after boiling it in steam, which changes it into a gum-like mass.*\n\nKitul Jelly.\u2014Dissolve a tea spoonful of the starch with a little cold water, and pour over it four ounces, or two wineglassfuls of boiling water, and keep stirring till it jellies; then flavour it with milk and sugar.\n\nMadupiti, from the Cycas Circinalis.\u2014The Sinhalese in the Uva District prepare from this an inferior kind of starch. The fresh kernels are cut in slices and well dried in the sun, before they are fit for use: otherwise they have an intoxicating effect and produce vomiting and diarrhoea. The poorer classes generally use the flour, which is prepared by pounding the kernels. It is also boiled in steam and eaten by patients suffering from bowel complaint and haemorrhoids, for which it is highly esteemed by the natives as the best medicine. I have given the flour made into porridge in cases of chronic dysentery, and from the few trials that I have made, I think favourably of its effect, in restraining inordinate purging such as is often beyond the control of the usual astringent medicines. The tree grows plentifully in Vialuwa.\n\nBarley was also cultivated in parts of Udukinda in the vicinity of Wilson's Bungalow, by Brahmins, who went\n\n* Vide Observations on the Vegetable Products of Ceylon, p. 83.\nunder the designation of \"R\u0101jak\u0101riya,\" and who were employed by the King of Kandy for the purpose. It was first cultivated in Tennak\u00f3n Vela, and is now found in Ambavela and Waugala. In the last-mentioned place it is still cultivated by the descendants of the said \"R\u0101jak\u0101riya\" who are now become Siyhalese by intermarriage. It is called kotomba, or yava, and is cultivated in October and November, and gathered after seven months. The soil is manured with cow dung.\n\nFrom the seeds of the *Nymph\u00e6a stellata*, the people at Bintenna prepare starch, which they use during times of scarcity. They also use a decoction of the seed in dysentery. The seeds are collected from tanks from June to September.\n\nThe process by which Kitul toddy drawers in \u00dava increase the flow of the juice of blossoms, or force it out from unproductive ones, deserves to be noticed:\u2014The process is called \"Kitul mala behel tiyanav\u0101.\"\n\nBlack pepper, ginger, burnt coconut, or old dried coconut, garlic, and chilli, are all roasted together, and being ground with the juice of a kind of lime, nasndran, the mass is made into a ball. Then take the leaves of a species of Arum called in Siyhalese *sudu ala kola* and boil them in a little of the lime juice. Make five pegs an inch long of five varieties of lime wood, which they call paspen-giri-ul-paha, and two pegs of Cinnamon wood, and a tree called *Ittu*. These pegs are only used to increase the flow of the juice. But to force out the juice from unproductive blossoms, drive into the flower stalk two pegs of *ratnetul* (PLUMBAGO ROSEA) and *a\u1e45kenda*.\n\nWhen the pegs are ready, cut a groove into the flower stalk, three inches long, one inch deep, and one inch broad. To the half of the groove near the stem apply the spice ball above described; to the other half, the boiled leaves of the Arum, into which the pegs are to be driven,\nand roll a piece of mat over the stalk and cut out a ring from the spadix an inch from the stalk. Apply a quantity of ashes of Areca leaves and akmal\u00e0, which being well mixed with the syrup of the kitul juice is rubbed over the part of the blossom which had not spread out, and allow to dry four days: on the other part of the flower roll down the bark of the Naha (Gnidia eriocephala) and then cut off the end of the flower, four days after which the juice begins to flow.\n\nA kitul flower lasts two months, sometimes three. A flower yields four seers of toddy in twenty-four hours. It is very important to select the flower at the proper time; if it be too young or too old, no juice will be obtained. The best time for cutting is when it forms a curve and bulges out like a plantain flower.\n\nI have since heard that a similar process is had recourse to in the Colombo District.\n\nCONDIMENTS.\n\nNearly all the condiments that I have enumerated above are produced in Udakinde; in former times they were cultivated by Malabars who were employed by the King of Kandy, and received from him grants of land for that purpose.\n\nGUMS.\n\nAmong these the Gum kina may be briefly noticed. In 1853, I first pointed out that the tree yielded the gum kina of Commerce. I drew public attention to the subject in a letter published in the Ceylon Times in April of the same year. It is true that the tree is mentioned in \"Moon's Catalogue,\" page 52, but he seems not to have been aware of its useful properties.\n\nI submitted specimens of the gum to the Chamber of Commerce, and they reported that it was of \"good quality.\" It is sold in the London market at from 25s. to 47s. per cwt.\nThe difficulty of obtaining large quantities has arisen from the difficulty of securing the services of the Sinhalese to collect it.\n\nThe tree is found at Ayygoda, near Badulla, Teldeniya and Nilgalla or the Park.\n\nBlack Varnish is produced from a species of *Semicarpus*. This gum resin is equal to the black varnish of China for the purpose of lacquering. It exudes spontaneously from the stem and branches, and may also be obtained by making incisions in the bark. The resin is hard, breaks with a smooth shining fracture, burns with a bright flame, melts in fire, is soluble in turpentine, insoluble in water, and adheres strongly to wood and metal. The fresh juice is very acrid, inflaming the skin, and producing pustules.\n\nTo a saturated solution of Vateria resin (*Hal-dummala* of the Sinhalese) in oil of Turpentine, add by degrees small pieces of the black resin; put it into a bottle and shake it well until the whole is dissolved. Strain, and then apply it to wood or metal.\n\nIt belongs to the same natural family of plants as the Varnish tree of China and Japan, and possesses the same acrid properties when applied to the skin in a fresh state, as it exudes from the bark.\n\nThe resin exudes from natural fissures of the bark, and at first white, becomes afterwards black by exposure to the sun, hardening into masses of different sizes. The juice also drops on the ground around the tree forming flattened pieces of resin... My attention was drawn to this tree while stationed in Badulla in 1852. A soldier was cutting firewood in the neighbourhood of Badulla, and among other trees he felled the *Badulla-gaha* tree. The juice spurted out at each cut of the axe on his fore-arm; he returned home and washed himself; the next day he felt an itching in the arm, in the evening it was swollen red and painful; next morning he was unable to wear\nhis jacket and went to Hospital, a pustular eruption not unlike that produced by Tartar Emetic ointment having broken out in the places where the juice had touched the skin. He rapidly recovered, however, by the application of warm fomentations and olive oil.\n\nNow this corrosive property is the same as that which is described by Rumphius as belonging to the Varnish tree of Sumatra and the Eastern Isles. He says:\n\n\"The exhalations of this tree are considered noxious, and the people of Macassar and other parts of Celebes in particular, entertain such a dread of it, that they dare not remain long, much less repose, under its shade. They say, that whoever receives the droppings from it will have his body swelled, and be afflicted with malignant sores. As, however, it furnishes the celebrated varnish, other people boldly repair to this tree, particularly the Chinese and the Tonquinese, who employ great precaution in collecting the resin, which is accomplished in the following manner. A number of Chinese proceed about evening to the place where the trees grow, which is always at a distance from the resort of man or animals; each selects a few, and inserts into the trunk two pieces of bamboo, sharpened at their points in such a manner as to penetrate the bark in a somewhat oblique direction. These remain all night, and are extracted before sun-rise the next morning, the tree yielding no juice during the day. The resin is found in greater or less quantity, according to the richness or poorness of the soil, and is obtained only at certain seasons of the year, particularly about the time of flowering. The people who collect it unite the fruit of their labor, and afterwards make a complete division of the whole, on which account this resin maintains a high price, a single pikul (containing a hundred catties) selling in those provinces of China which do not possess this tree, for two or three hundred dollars; in Tonkin and Camboja, however, it may be had for thirty, fifty, or sixty dollars. It is a custom among the Chinese when they approach this tree, first to rub the trunk lightly, before inserting the bamboo, wishing by this to shew that they are not afraid, for they say, that timid persons will sooner feel its noxious effects than those who are bold and fearless.\"\n\nThis tree is found growing both in low-lands and high-lands. In and around the Cinnamon Gardens; at Awis-\nw\u00eblla, Kuruwi\u1e6di K\u00f3ral\u00e9, at Ha\u1e47w\u00eblla, in the Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and at A\u1e41bagamuwa, and in the Badulla district.\n\nGamboge.\u2014The Gamboge tree grows plentifully, but the natives seldom extract its valuable gum. They extract oil from its fruit, which ripens in August, and use it for culinary purposes.\n\nOILS.\n\nThe solid oils which are common in the district are the \"Cinnamon suet,\" obtained by boiling the Cinnamon fruit. \"Gamboge oil,\" also by boiling the fruit.\n\nThe wild Nutmeg (Myristica tomentosa) likewise yields a solid oil by boiling the kernel.\n\nThe Mudol oil (Garcinia echinocarpa).\n\nMeheriya oil (Isonandra, Sp.), are also fatty oils.\n\nAll these oils may, I think, be applied to the manufacturing of Soap.\n\nDYBS.\n\nIndian Madder, or Munjeet. Among dyes, the Madder is the most remarkable. It grows in abundance in and around Badulla in scattered groups.\n\nThe natives have never used it as a dyeing plant, being wholly ignorant of its useful properties; they look upon it altogether as a weed.\n\nIn the early part of 1853, I submitted specimens to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. The plant grows in moist situations, the soil being a vegetable mould.\n\nThe valley of Badulla is remarkably fertile, abounding in limestone, and plants growing in such localities generally yield a beautiful bright red dye.\n\nAs the plant has hitherto been known to grow only in a wild state, time and experience will be required before the mode of cultivation best suited for it, can be ascertained. Excellent specimens of the root of the Madder grow in\nGampaha near Udapussellawa. Specimens of the plant with a drawing of it were forwarded to Government, who sent them to the Chamber of Commerce in December 1853.\n\nThe drawing consisted of two parts, No. 1 represented all the parts of the plant to identify the species, with magnified views of the flower, and section of the fruit. No. 2 shewed the appearance and ramification of the root, so that its commercial value might be indicated. Both parts of the drawing were of natural size.* The Indian Madder is not so valueless as some would make it appear. We learn from a high authority in such matters, that \"the Madder is produced in Nepaul and in various districts of India. That which is brought to England, is imported from Culcutta, and is cultivated in the high lands about Natpore in Purneah. The roots are long and slender, and when broken appear of a red color. It is used in dyeing; the red which it produces being, though somewhat peculiar, nearly the same as that produced by European madder.\"\n\nDr. Bancroft says \"that upon wool, or woollen cloth, its colour is brighter and livelier than upon cotton or linen; and, when proper mordants are used, nearly, perhaps quite, as permanent.\"\n\nIt is stated in the Jury Report, \"that specimens of madder grown in localities deficient in lime were considered inferior.\" The Reports of the Juries of the Great Exhibition of 1851, on Indian Madder, are encouraging; they state, \"that the Indian Madder is a valuable dye stuff, and hitherto not so well appreciated as it deserves, for some of the colours dyed with it are as permanent as those dyed with European Madder, and even more brilliant; its use is, however, gradually increasing, and it is unquestionably well worthy the attention of dyers.\"\n\nFor the following Oriental names of the Madder plant\n\n* For a full description of the Madder plant as found in Badulla, see \"Observations of the Vegetable Products of Ceylon,\" page 17.\nwith their derivations, I am indebted to my brother, the Rev. S. D. J. Ondaatje, of Matara.\n\nManj\u00e9tha\u2014from the verb (\u092e\u091c) Maja, to cleanse or purify,\u2014and (\u0925\u093e) tha, the participial termination of the feminine gender. This verb, besides its ideal meaning, conveys the notions of clearness, and brightness, and is used to express ideas connected with such qualities; hence the terms for red and redness come from this verb. In Pali, Manj\u00e9tha (\u092e\u091e\u094d\u091c\u0947\u0925\u093e) means red; hence the creeper is called by that name: the quality of redness being expressed by the term.\n\nVikas\u00e1, (\u0935\u093f\u0915\u0938), from vi, a preposition, and kas\u00e1, to glitter, participial adjective, having a causal meaning: that which causes to shine, or glitter, or sparkle; hence a plant by which a bright red colour is imparted. These two words, (Manj\u00e9tha; Vikas\u00e1,) have the same signification in Sanskrit.\n\nRakl\u00e1ngi (\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0902\u0917\u093f). This means a red body: rakta, red; a\u00edga, body or limb; and is applied to the plant.\n\nPadmak\u00e1, (\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u0915). Padma means the red lotus; hence Padmak\u00e1 is, having the property of redness, resembling the red lotus.\n\nVastrabhish\u00e1na. (\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092d\u093f\u0937\u0923). This means, that which dyes cloth: vastra cloth or vestment; bhishana, that which adorns or beautifies.\n\nRaktayashti, (\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0920\u093f): rakta, red; and yashti, stem; hence the word means, that which has a stem whose property is to impart redness.\n\nElu Names.\n\nVelmad\u00e1ta. (\u0935\u0947\u0932\u092e\u0926\u093e\u0924\u093e): vel, a creeper; mad\u00e1ta, red; hence a red dye imparting creeper. This is a derivative from the Pali, manj\u00e9tha.\n\nSamang\u00e1, (\u0938\u093e\u0902\u0917\u093e), means that which unites or blends with, and so a plant yielding a dye that colours any substance, by union with it.\nY\u00f3janavalli, (\u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940), means a creeper of the length or a mile; y\u00f3jana, a mile, and valli, a creeper; because the creeper is of great length; a very appropriate name, seeing that the stem creeping on trees forms an interminable net-work.\n\nSap\u00e1n wood, is found in abundance in W\u00e9llaw\u00e1ya, from whence it is taken to Hambantota for exportation.\n\nMorinda wood, found in Wellassa. The native dyers of the Coast of India grind the root, and make an infusion, to which a piece of alum being added, the colour is changed from yellow to red. It is used as a red-dye for cotton cloth. It is the Ahu-gaha of the Sinhalese, and Nuz\u00e1-marum of the Tamils. In India it is known by the name of Hal dye.*\n\nThe Jury of the Great Exhibition have stated that \"the colours dyed with the Morinda are for the most part not brilliant, but the colouring matter is far more permanent than many other red colours are, and with improved management would probably rival that of Madder; it would therefore perhaps be a useful dye stuff; it appears well worthy the attention of dyers.\"\n\nArnotto.\u2014This is the produce of the Bixa orellana. The tree grows wild in and about Badulla, Passara, and Wellassa. The dye may be prepared by a simple and inexpensive process, namely, by steeping the seeds in water, and removing the colouring matter from them. The colouring matter which remains suspended in water is then boiled in large copper vessels to the consistency of syrup.\n\nTerminalia Chebula.\u2014The drupes are collected and taken down to Colombo from various parts of Uva. They are used to dye black, and are called \"Gall nuts,\" or Myrobalans. They are used both in dyeing and tanning, and form one of the exports of the country; with alum it forms a yellow colour, and with the salts of iron black.\n\n* Vide \"Observations on the Vegetable Products of Ceylon,\" 1853, p. 14.\nIt is remarkable that the word *triphal\u0101*, commonly used by the Sinhalese quacks to include decoction of the three Myrobalans, is a Sanskrit word, derived originally from a very ancient work, which according to Professor Wilson was written before the 9th or 10th century. (Royle.) It is stated by the Jury Report of the Madras Exhibition, that Gall nuts \"have become a very important article of trade, and the consumption is now fully 2,000 tons annually.\" (Archer.)\n\n*Indigo.*\u2014I submitted specimens prepared from the *Indigofera tinctoria* growing wild at Dikwella, near the Badulla oya and paddy fields. It is found in groups. I collected a quantity of the plant in July 1855, and subjected it to the keeping process which is generally adopted in Bengal. The plants attain a good height, and from their luxuriant growth shew that the soil and climate of Badulla are well adapted for its cultivation.\n\nI subjoin an extract from a letter, dated 9th October, 1855, from the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, Colombo.\n\n\"I am requested by the Committee of the Chamber of Commerce to acknowledge your letter of the 25th September, and to thank you for the sample of Indigo forwarded. I am also requested to inform you that the quality of it is good, taking into consideration the circumstances under which it has been prepared.\"\n\n(Signed) R. Nicol.\"\n\n**Fibres.**\n\n*Fibre* is the modification of single cells. Fibre from *endogens* is generally white, and contains more lignine or woody matter; hence it is less adapted to resist strain, and possesses less flexibility and softness than that from *exogens*.\n\nThe fibres of *endogens* most commonly applied to useful purposes are derived from leaves, as the aloes, agave, yucca or Adam's needle, sansevieria, fourcroya or gigantic aloe, ananas or pine-apple; and from stems, as the musa or plantain; and from the husk of seeds, as the coconut palm; and from the sheath of the leaves of the jaggery palm or kitul, the black horse-hair-like fibre. From the *exogens* we derive many valuable kinds, viz., flax, rhea or China\ngrass cloth fibre, the *Urtica heterophylla* called vegetable wool, the *Calotropis gigantea* or mudar, *Hibiscus cannabinus*, from which gunny bags are made.\n\nThe extraction of fibre during the native rule was one of the services imposed on the Rodiya caste, who had to supply the stores of the King with ropes made of different fibres chiefly of the *Sansevieria* and *Kitul* or jaggery palm.\n\nThese people up to this day continue manufacturing fibre ropes, and they are very expert in extracting fibre with the hand, which I ascertained when I employed them for the purpose: but they are indolent and do not seem to care about working regularly.\n\nOne of the most remarkable fibres found in the districts is the *Sansevieria Zeylanica*, or bow string hemp. This plant grows in great abundance in the otherwise barren parts stretching towards Batticaloa, and the lower road to Kandy. It has 5, 6, 8, 10, 20, radical leaves, with dark matches or spots across, which disappear when they become old. The young leaves are nearly round, and the old ones are marked with longitudinal lines terminating on an obtuse point. Plants growing near streams yield good strong white fibre, the best kinds being obtained from the young leaves; these generally measure from one to three feet; the longest of those growing at Alipot, reached to four feet and a half.\n\nThe natives have recourse to various methods of extracting the fibre, by scraping the leaves, and maceration. To two sticks fixed in the ground a piece of split bamboo with a sharp edge is fastened horizontally at a convenient height for the operator. He begins by scraping the base of the leaf, and twisting the fibre round a piece of stick, with which he holds the leaf firmly, and draws the upper surface towards him; thus scraping the pulp and with it removing much of the short fibre, which will make good tow. The Rodiyas substitute a buffalo's rib for the sharp-edged bamboo, placing\nthe concave side of the rib towards the operator, and using the same process as that I have already mentioned.\n\nAnother method is to scrape the leaf between two sharp pieces of bamboo placed one above the other, leaving a narrow interestice between them, through which the apex or narrow point of the leaf is drawn out. By this method of extracting the fibre the following results are obtained. One of the leaves yields 100 grains of clean fibre, and 70 grains of tow. Half a cwt. of leaves yields \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) lb. of fibre; cost of collecting leaves \\( 7\\frac{1}{2}d. \\), cleaning \\( 7\\frac{1}{2}d. \\); \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) lb. of fibre costs \\( 15d. \\), 1 cwt. costs \u00a39 6s. 8d. 250 leaves on an average weigh 20 lbs., and 500 yield \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) lb. fibre and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) lb. tow; \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cwt. contains 641 leaves. It may be stated generally, that 1 cwt. of leaves yields \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) lb. of fibre; 75 lbs. of leaves can be cleaned by one man in a day, yielding 1 lb. of fibre and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) lb. of tow; 1 lb. of leaves could be cleaned in 10 minutes.\n\nBy maceration, 1 lb. of leaves macerated for five days yielded 225 grains of fibre; 1 cwt. yielded 4 lbs. 4 oz. of fibre.\n\nThe plant grows near Badulla at Ridipana, Donhindayi, Bolliyadda, and at Pisce, where it is found in perfection.\n\nFrom the above it is scarcely necessary to remark, that the extraction of fibre by hand labour can never be made remunerative.\n\nHorse-hair-like fibre of the Kitul or Jaggery Palm.\u2014Very strong black fibre, like horse-hair, about 3 feet long. It is well adapted for making brushes, and for other purposes, for which horse-hair and bristle are used. I forwarded a brush made of this fibre to the Society in 1853; and I believe this first drew the attention of the merchants at Colombo to the subject, the brush having been shewn by Dr. Lamprey to one of them. Large quantities are now exported to England.\n\nIt is found in great abundance in Medikinda as high up as Haputale. Owing to strong winds which prevail in\nUdukinda the trees are blown down, and very few are to be found growing there.\n\n*Antiaris Saccidora.*\u2014A remarkable forest tree, called in Singhalese *ritigaha*. By an ingenious though simple process, the natives prepare from the bark of this tree, material for very strong and elastic sacks for the purpose of carrying paddy, &c. The trees selected for the purpose are from \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) to 1 foot in diameter. Large ones, sometimes measuring as much as \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet and more in diameter, are not so suitable.\n\nWhen a tree has been fixed upon, the stem is cut down and divided into junks of the size required, and these having been firmly placed on the ground, the bark is well beaten with a stone or club, until the parenchymatous parts, or what is commonly called the cortical, comes off, leaving the liber or inner bark attached to the wood, which is then entirely separated from it by simply drawing it out with the hand. The bark thus obtained is of a fibrous structure, remarkably tough, presenting the appearance of a woven fabric like that of a stocking.* No scientific description of the tree found in Ceylon was published previous to 1853, although it was well known to the people of Badulla.\n\n*New Material for the Manufacture of Paper.*\u2014In Eastern countries paper was manufactured from indigenous fibre long before it was introduced into Europe in the eleventh century. According to Col. Sykes, for 2,000 years paper had been made in India; never from rags, but always from fibre. Some years ago I brought to notice the mode adopted by the natives of Badulla for manufacturing paper.\n\nWhen in 1853 the scarcity of rags in the European markets began to be felt, I commenced my experiments on various indigenous products found in the district of Badulla.\u2020\n\n*Vide \"Observations on the Vegetable Products of Ceylon,\" page 20-21.*\n\u2020Vide Journal Asiatic Society, Ceylon, 1855, p. 74-75.\nA small factory was set up five miles from Badulla, at Ambagaha oya, where the material was found in abundance, and paper was made by hand labour. I now lay before you a few specimens of the paper manufactured by me.\n\nAfter spending nearly \u00a3200 I was obliged to abandon the manufacture, owing to the want of suitable machinery for reducing the raw material into pulp. With proper machinery the cost may be greatly reduced; and I believe, that the manufacture of paper with this new material will yield a good return. The pulp is not easily distinguishable from that made of rags; 90 grains made one sheet of paper of the size of foolscap; 12 sheets of paper made with it weighed 2 oz. 2 drs.; 1 ream 100 oz. Again 160 lbs. of the raw material made four reams of paper. Weight of 1 sheet of paper 70 grains; 8 lbs. 6 oz. of pulp are required to make 1 ream. 1 lb. of fresh material yields \u00bc lb. of paper pulp.\n\nThe specimens of paper manufactured by me were submitted by Government to the Stationery Committee, composed of Mr. Saunders, Captain Higgs, and Major Layard. These gentlemen reported in a letter to the honourable the Colonial Secretary, dated 8th August, 1856, that \"the specimens might be rendered applicable to many useful purposes, such as for making envelopes, and printing licences, permits, way bills, &c.; the blotting paper would answer very well.\"\n\nMr. Bernard, Deputy Commissary General, in a letter to the Colonial Secretary, dated 25th August, 1857, states \"with regard to the quality of the paper it appears to me, that even now they are much better than a great part of the paper manufactured in India, and extensively used in public offices there.\" I forwarded 1 cwt. of paper-pulp to the Chamber of Commerce, Colombo, on the 19th September, 1855. The Secretary informed me \"that the 1 cwt. of the pulp is now\nbeing shipped to London as a trial, and the result of the sale, and the broker's report thereon, shall be forwarded you on receipt.\" No information of the trial of the pulp in London has yet been communicated to me. The pulp was forwarded by Messrs. Armitage Brothers.\n\nIn the Appendix to this paper will be found Correspondence with Government on the subject of the manufacture of paper.\n\nI have also tested the pulp as a substitute for making articles of papier mach\u00e9.\n\nCotton is cultivated in Kandapalla, a dry part of the district; and formerly a very coarse kind of cotton cloth was manufactured there.\n\nANIMAL PRODUCTS.\n\nLac is found in the *Gyrocarpus Jacquinii*, and the people of Bintenne collect it from June to September; it is of good quality. The lac yields to boiling water a red dye, and with solution of alum strikes a beautiful carmine.\n\nIt is the produce of the *Chermes Laccu*. Lacker painting is carried on in Wadakonna, and much of the lac is used for this purpose. Walking sticks, handles for knives, and bows, are beautifully lackered.\n\nThis also was a \"R\u00e1jak\u00e1riya\" in the district. A good deal of lac is obtained from Kandapalla where it is gathered in July.\n\nMINERALS.\n\nLime-stone abounds very extensively throughout the district. During the native rule, lime was largely prepared at a place called H\u00e1ngili\u00eblla on the Nuwara Eliya road; its preparation being one of the compulsory duties imposed on the people.\n\nDIGGING FOR PRECIOUS STONES.\n\nThis was also made one of the compulsory duties called \"Agery,\" and the work was carried on at Nuwara Eliya in the following localities:\u2014Vilm\u00e1na, Lindaojuva, Bagawan-tal\u00e1wa, S\u00edt\u00e1 Eliya, B\u00f3patalava, Mah\u00e1 Eliya, \u00dadavilm\u00e1na,\nM\u00e1pillam\u00e1na, Madwalamulla, Palalm\u00e1na, and Patara-gald\u00f3va.\n\nIRON ORE.\n\nThere is abundance of iron ore in the following places:\u2014Tolab\u00f3watta, Udaw\u00e1diya (near Nahaville,) Hilpenkandura, Vaha Eliya in Kandapalla, Horag\u00f3na also in Kandapalla, Hattawalla in B\u00f3goda.\n\nThe place where iron was smelted for the King of Kandy was at Kinagand\u00f3va in Tolabowatta, and it was made a compulsory labour performed by the people of Kandapalla and Sabaragamuwa.* Magnetic iron ore is found at Kahatavela, near Paranagama, Yatakokhilla, and on the road to Kataragama.\n\nSulphuret of Iron, from Bintenna, is composed of arsenic in a greater quantity than sulphur. Large masses of this substance are found in various parts of the low country. In passing along some of them, the attention is arrested by the not very pleasant odour of sulphureted hydrogen gas evolved by them.\n\nIt is the general belief of the people that sulphur ore exists in Walapana and Bintenna. I obtained a specimen of this ore from a Kandyan at Gampaha, but I have not been able to ascertain the locality from whence it was obtained. The preparation of sulphur was one of the compulsory duties which was rendered by the family of Tennegedara at Teripehe in Walapana.\n\nCORUNDUM, OR CINNAMON STONE.\n\nThis abounds in a place called Batgamana, which is situated 12 miles from Alipot. The mineral is found in a stream called the Ag\u00e1re-kundura. The natives prepare a useful hone by a composition of the powder of this mineral with lac: they melt the lac, and gradually add the powder, which when cooled becomes hard, and is shaped into different sizes.\n\n* For a description of the mode of manufacturing steel as adopted by the Sinhalese, vide Journal of the Asiatic Society of Ceylon, 1855, p. 73.\nIron alum, found as an efflorescence on a decomposing rock of gneiss called pudama near Teldeniya. The specimen contains more iron than alum.\n\nPlumbago abounds in Bintenna.\n\nNITRE EARTH.\n\nThere are numbers of nitriferous caverns in this district composed of large limestone rocks with subterranean passages, and containing heaps of mould-like earth emitting a strong ammoniacal odour. These heaps are the products of the dung of myriads of bats that have inhabited there from ages. By the action of the carbonate of lime in the limestone on the dung thus deposited, there results the well-known chemical compound of nitrate of lime such as is obtained from the artificial nitre beds of Europe. The Sinhalese, who call the earth vavul pas, \"bats earth,\" have a mode of converting it into saltpetre not altogether dissimilar to the mode adopted in Europe at the present day, by which the nitrate of lime is converted, by means of ashes, into the nitrate of potash or saltpetre.\n\nThe manufacture of saltpetre was one of the compulsory labours imposed on the people of the district, and called Lunu-r\u0101jak\u0101riya which began in the month of June or July. The people of Lunu-gala, a village about four miles from Badulla, proceeded to a cave at Gampaha in Kandapalla k\u014dral\u0113 and constructed sheds for the manufacture, they were assisted by others who furnished them with torches and oil for working in the dark caves.\n\nThe manufacturers of the nitre belonged to a caste called Vahumpuray\u014d, who collected nitre earth and firewood; four or five gamardlas supplied them with a quantity of kakune or kene oil, a dhoby furnished torches made of cloth and the dried spath of the coconut, and potters of Tunkinde supplied pots for carrying on the manufacture.\n\nThe following is the process adopted, which is exceedingly simple and inexpensive. They take a quantity of nitre\nearth and mix it up with wood-ashes of the *Erythrina Indica* and *Terminalia alata*, or the petiole of the coconut; putting the whole into a large talipot leaf previously shaped into the form of a funnel; they then proceed to pour water over and filter this mixture of earth and ashes. This operation is continued until the water begins to look turbid, when it must at once cease, as this is an indication of the purely earthy character of the particles yet remaining in the leaf. The washing obtained in the way above described is generally very clean, possessing a strong ammoniacal odour, and containing nitrate of potash in solution. To crystallize this, they remove the washing into a large chatty in which it is boiled till it thickens and presents the appearance of \"a mixture of flour and water;\" in this state it is transferred to another earthen chatty having a rough surface within, called *koraha*, where it is left until crystallization takes place. But as the crystals thus formed do not look white and nice, they are dissolved once more in water, and allowed to crystallize again, when fine large crystals are produced. The saltpetre obtained in this way was used by the Kandyans chiefly for making fireworks; indeed the native term for it, *vedilunu* would indicate this much. Great attention appears to have been paid by the Sinhalese to the Pyrotechnic art, on which they have numerous and elaborate compositions. The Chinese it is well-known have always been famous for their fireworks, which are superior to those of other nations in variety and beauty. They likewise used saltpetre for this purpose before they became acquainted with the art of making gunpowder.\n\nDr. Davy's early scientific researches in Ceylon ought to be more generally known than they have been among the residents and others who are engaged in similar researches. The learned Doctor travelled through the length and breadth of the Island; he had excellent opportunities for making personal observations, and his descriptions of\nevery thing he saw, examined, and described, are generally correct, even to this day. I quote from his valuable \"Account of the Interior of Ceylon\" published in 1821, respecting the Nitre Caves of Ceylon:\n\n\"Nitre and Nitrat of lime are of frequent occurrence. The names of twenty-two places may be enumerated, in which saltpetre is produced, and in which it has been manufactured; and no doubt, besides these, there are many other spots that yield this salt, known to the natives, whose policy it is not to make us acquainted with them. Judging from four nitre caves that I have visited, and from the specimens of rocks of several more that I have examined, I believe that they are all very similar; and that the rock in which they occur, in every instance contains at least felspar and carbonate of lime; from the decomposition of the former of which, the alkaline base of the salt is generally derived, and by the peculiar influence of the latter, (yet not at all understood,) on the oxygen and azote of the atmosphere, the acid principal is generated. In confirmation of this statement, it may be remarked, that I have never been able to detect saltpetre, excepting superficially, where air could have access; never unaccompanied by nitrat of lime, or magnesia; in no rock, not containing lime and felspar; that the richness of the rock, in general, has been proportional to the abundance and intimate mixture of these two ingredients; and that the results of experiments which I have made on a variety of specimens of saltpetre-earth from Bengal, for which I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Brown of Calcutta, were similar to those just mentioned, and tended to the same conclusions.\n\nBesides the essential circumstances of the presence of atmospheric air, lime, and an alkaline mineral, there are other circumstances which, if my observations be correct, greatly aid in the operation of forming the salt. I shall mention the most remarkable only, which appear to me to be slight humidity and the presence of a little animal matter. Perhaps, humidity is absolutely necessary; certainly, I have seen spots in a nitre cave, without any impregnation of saltpetre, which, excepting their great dryness, seemed to possess every requisite for the production of the salt. Animal matter, by those ignorant of chemistry, is considered of itself the chief source of nitre. Persuaded of this, my countrymen in Ceylon, with whom I conversed on the subject, generally attributed the saltpetre of the caves in question to the dung of bats, with which the caves are more or less infested. It is easy to refute such a notion; and to\nshew, that the dung of these animals, like any animal matter, is not an essential, merely an assistant circumstance. For this purpose, it will be sufficient to remark, that in the nitre cave near Memoora in Doombera, in a very compoundad rock consisting of calc spar, felspar, quartz, mica, and talc, in a humid state exposed to the air, and slowly decomposing, I have found a rich impregnation of saltpetre, though quite free from the dung of bats, or any other animal matter; and conversely, that I have not been able to detect any traces of this salt in the dung of bats, that had accumulated in great quantity in an old forsaken pagodah.\n\n\"A description of the nitre caves which I have visited, will be found in another part of this work, and an account of the method employed by the natives, both in the manufacture of saltpetre and of gunpowder. I may here give the results of some analyses, that I have made, which will shew the composition, of the most productive nitre rock of Doombera, of the most productive nitre earth of Ouva, and of the richest nitre earth of Bengal. The nitre rock of Doombera was from the Memoora cave, the same as that before mentioned as free from animal matter; 100 parts of this very compounded rock were found to consist of\u2014\n\n2\u00b74 nitrat of potash.\n0\u00b77 nitrat of magnesia.\n0\u00b72 sulphat of magnesia.\n9\u00b74 water.\n26\u00b75 carbonat of lime.\n60\u00b77 earthy matter, insoluble in dilute nitric acid.\n\n100\u00b70\n\n100 parts of the nitre earth, from the great cave in lower Ouva, near Wellaway, were found to consist of\u2014\n\n3\u00b73 nitrat of potash, with traces of common salt and sulphat of lime.\n3\u00b75 nitrat of lime.\n15\u00b73 water.\n25\u00b77 animal matter of difficult solubility.\n1\u00b70 animal matter easily soluble in water.\n51\u00b72 carbonat of lime and earthy matter.\n\n100\u00b70\n\n100 parts of nitre earth from Bengal, from the district of Tirhoot, were found to consist of\u2014\n\n8\u00b73 nitrat of potash.\n3\u00b77 nitrat of lime.\n0\u00b78 sulphat of lime, with a trace of iron.\n0\u00b72 common salt.\n35\u00b70 carbonat of lime, with trace of magnesia.\n40\u00b70 earthy matter, insoluble in water and nitric acid.\n12\u00b70 water, with a trace of vegetable matter.\n\n100\u00b70\n\"Nitrat of lime I have never met with, excepting in combination with nitre. Sulphat of magnesia I have found in one place only, viz., the nitre cave of Memoora in Doombera. In the same cave, and nowhere else, I discovered alum, in minute quantity. I suspect that the acid of both these salts is derived from decomposing pyrites, and that the magnesia of the sulphat is afforded by decomposing talc. This sulphat forms with the nitre, and crystallizes with it. It is carefully picked out and rejected by the native workmen who prepare the saltpetre, being ignorant of its value. A considerable quantity of it, equal to the best Epsom salt, might be procured in this cave, and I know no reason why it should not be collected.\"\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nBadulla, 19th July, 1856.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg leave to submit for the consideration of Government, that I have been since the year 1853 experimenting upon various indigenous vegetable products with the object of finding a material adapted for the manufacture of paper, and which could be obtained in quantity and at a cheap cost. And I am now able to say that I have succeeded in manufacturing the accompanying specimens of paper from a shrub which grows plentifully in the district of Uva. This paper it may be observed possesses the property of combining less weight with greater tenacity than that made of rags, and is peculiarly suited for a tropical climate.\n\n2. With the very rude machinery I have at present, I am prepared to manufacture four or five reams per diem by a process similar to that adopted in England for making paper by hand.\n\nCommon foolscap is the largest size that can be made at present, and the rate at which such paper could be supplied would probably be less than the rate at which similar paper is usually procurable by Government.\n\n3. A small Factory has been set up near Badulla, and the work carried on by a friend of mine who lives on the spot; and if the present rough paper is adapted for any public purposes, arrangements could be made to meet the demand. And with the aid of Government in the shape of a regular demand for such description of paper, I should hope to be able to produce paper of a superior quality by means of better machinery.\n\n4. It may perhaps be considered premature to bring forward this matter at its present stage to the notice of Government, but as I have already laid out a considerable sum of money in experiments, and it not being in my power to continue them, I now respectfully\n\n* Davy, pp.\nsolicit the aid of Government in the manner about indicated; feeling assured that such an humble attempt in developing the resources of the country will meet with the fostering protection of the Government whom I serve.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) W. C. ONDAATJE.\n\nTo the Hon'ble the Colonial Secretary.\n\nColonial Secretary's Office,\nColombo, 13th August, 1856.\n\nSir,\u2014Referring to your letter of the 19th ultimo, I am directed to transmit to you copy of one from the Committee on Stationery.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) P. W. BRAYBROOKE.\n\nMr. W. C. ONDAATJE, Badulla.\n\nStationery Committee,\nColombo, 18th August, 1856.\n\nSir,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 31st ultimo, forwarding for report one from Mr. W. C. Ondaatje, accompanied by specimens of paper made by him in Uva, we have the honor to state that in our opinion, the successful results which have attended Mr. Ondaatje's praiseworthy efforts to manufacture paper in this Island, are most creditable to him and deserving of every encouragement.\n\nOf the specimens herewith returned those marked No. 1, 2, and 3 might be rendered applicable to many useful purposes, such as, for making envelopes and printing licenses, permits, way-bills, &c., while No. 4 would answer very well as blotting paper, and might probably be improved if made a little thicker.\n\nIn order however to ascertain whether this paper is likely to supersede the use of that at present applied to the purposes named, it will be necessary for Mr. Ondaatje to state the cost at which he can undertake to deliver it. We would further recommend that with this information a ream of the best description cut to size and of uniform colour, also, a ream of the blotting paper, be sent to the Commissariat Department that a fair trial may be made with it, and its utility more fully reported on.\n\nWe have, &c.,\n(Signed) F. SAUNDERS,\n\u201e JOSEPH HIGGS,\n\u201e W. T. LAYARD.\n\n(Tr\u00e6 Copy.)\n(Signed) P. W. BRAYBROOKE.\n\nTo the Hon'ble the Colonial Secretary.\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose specimens of paper manufactured by Mr. Medical Sub-Assistant Ondaatje.\n\n2. His very praiseworthy exertions have been unceasing during the last three years. Considering that he has worked alone and against many disadvantages, there can be no doubt that his success has been very great. He has expended a large sum of money, near \u00a3200, in testing his experiments, and is on the point of giving up any further prosecution of them, in consequence of the want of machinery for reducing the fibre into fine pulp, the present manual labour for that purpose so greatly increasing the cost of the material as to preclude its competing, as an article of commerce, with other inferior fibres.\n\n3. Though he is obliged for the present to abandon all thoughts of exporting the fibre to England, he is able to manufacture the paper, of which I enclose you specimens, in some quantity, and at very reasonable rates.\n\n4. The headmen in all districts are now required to send returns, &c., which it is impossible they can do on ola; yet no paper is allowed them, and they are obliged to purchase it at their own cost.\n\n| Paper No. 1 and 2, | 5. The paper marked No. 1 and 2 can be supplied by Mr. Ondaatje, in the quantities and at the prices mentioned in the margin, much cheaper rates than lumberhand, (than which it is scarcely inferior in texture and to which it is superior in toughness,) is furnished to Government; which I believe is 7s. 6d. per ream. He could also manufacture paper of demi size. |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 21 reams a month. | Blotting paper, 30 reams a month. |\n| No. 1 paper:      | In Colombo 6s. 6d. per ream. |\n| In Kandy 7s. 6d. per ream. | In Badulla 5s. per ream. |\n| No. 2 paper:      | In Colombo 6s. per ream. |\n| In Kandy 4s. 6d. per ream. | In Badulla 4s. per ream. |\n\n6. There can be no question, I think, that it is not right to call on headmen to make returns which require paper, and not to supply them with paper for the purpose. I have the honor to suggest, therefore, that you should, if you concur with me in my views on this subject, recommend to Government that Mr. Ondaatje be employed to supply paper for this purpose; for superseding the use of ola in the Kachcheries generally, and for any other use to which his paper can be put. Either description of paper would answer excellently for forms, vouchers, returns of births, deaths, population lists, and division officers\u2019 books; and the blotting paper (of which I enclose\nBlotting paper.\n\nIn Colombo 2s.\nIn Kandy 7s. 6d.\nIn Badulla 7s. 6d.\n\nN.B.\u2014Blotting paper is supplied to Government at 13s. 6d., I believe.\n\na specimen,) I prefer to that supplied by Government, and it possesses the additional recommendation of being very much cheaper, as the note in the margin will shew you. Were it a little thicker it would be perfect.\n\n7. I feel sure that His Excellency the Governor will be inclined to look favourably on Mr. Ondaatje's praiseworthy exertions, supported, as I hope they will be by your recommendation, and I trust that he will, if possible, be encouraged in his efforts to develop the resources of the district; since from the results of his experiments, there is every reason to believe the Colony will really benefit by his prosecution of them.\n\nI have &c.,\n(Signed) J. BAILEY,\nA. G. A.\n\nTo the Government Agent, Kandy.\n\nGovernment Agent's Office,\nKandy, 28th March, 1857.\n\nSir,\u2014With reference to your letter No. 23 of the 31st January last, relative to the paper manufactured by Mr. Medical Sub-Assistant Ondaatje, and enclosing specimens thereof, I have the honor to annex for your information copy of a letter addressed by me to the Honorable the Colonial Secretary on the subject.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) W. D. WRIGHT,\nfor Agent.\n\nTo the Assistant Govt. Agent, Badulla.\n\nGovernment Agent's Office,\nKandy, March, 1857.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to annex copy of a letter No. 23, of the 31st January last, from my Assistant at Badulla, relative to the paper manufactured by Mr. Medical Sub-Assistant Ondaatje, enclosing specimens thereof, which I also beg to enclose.\n\n2. Since they were received by me, I have had the quality of the paper marked No. 1 tested, and it will be seen that it receives printing and writing inks equally well.\n\n3. Were I in a position to show that the paper now forwarded is cheaper than what is at present supplied to Government, for use in the public offices in the Central Province, I wou'd be happy to support Mr. Bailey's suggestion, that Mr. Ondaatjie be requested to supply the paper as required. But I fear that such is not the case,\nnor is it likely to be so, while Mr Ondaatje's machinery for reducing the fibre into pulp continues to be so defective.\n\n4. I can therefore only submit these papers to the Governor, with the expression of my hope, that His Excellency will be able to obtain for Mr. Ondaatje, the active co-operation of other parties, in his praiseworthy attempts to develop, what may ultimately prove to be, a valuable Island manufacture.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) E. RAWDON POWER.\n[True Copy.] Agent.\n\nTo the Hon'ble the Colonial Secretary.\n\nAssistant Government Agent's Office.\n\nSIR,\u2014With reference to the 3rd paragraph of the letter to the Colonial Secretary, copy of which was annexed to your letter No. 581 of the 26th ultimo, I have the honor to invite your attention to the 5th paragraph of my letter of the 31st January, No. 23.\n\n2. In that letter I shew that Mr. Ondaatje professes himself ready to supply paper scarcely inferior to lumberhand, and excellent blotting paper, at prices considerably lower than paper of similar description is supplied to Government, and I now annex a Statement shewing in a tabular form the particulars of his offer.\n\n3. I venture to suggest for the consideration of Government, whether it would not be worth while to give Mr. Ondaatje an opportunity of proving the value of his discovery, by permitting him to supply paper to the Kandy and Badulla Kachcheries, to a limited extent, provided he can give good security for the fulfilment of his engagement.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) J.

This is in reference to the letter which I wrote some time before the Governor came to Badulla. I can't help thinking Mr. Power is under some mistake, and that your paper is cheaper than the lumberhand, and blotting paper supplied by Government. Please send me again (for I have left my memorandum in Badulla,) the prices of your and Government paper.\n\nThe Governor shewed me a letter he had written to the Under-Secretary of State, transmitting specimens of your paper and pulp, and strongly recommending your invention to his notice.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) J.

That officer has been instructed to pay Mr. Ondaatjie for the paper supplied by him.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed) C. J. MacCarthy.\n\nThe Govt. Agent, Kandy.\n\nNo. 207.\n\nDeputy Commissary General's Office,\nColombo, 25th August, 1857.\n\nSir,\u2014The Correspondence herewith returned from the Government Agent at Kandy, and his Assistant at Badulla, respecting the specimens of paper manufactured by Mr. Ondaatjie, was referred to me with your letter of the 5th June last, and I should have replied to it sooner, but that I waited to be able to examine the paper lately received from England, and in the hope that the Invoice shewing the latest prices of paper would have arrived; but it has not yet reached me.\n\n2. It appears to me that there are three distinct questions raised in the Correspondence.\n\n1st.\u2014The substitution to a certain \"extent\" (a difficult term to define) of Mr. Ondaatjie's papers for the commoner descriptions of paper, such as Lumberhand, Common Foolscap, and Blotting Paper, which are now imported from England.\n\n2nd.\u2014The proposal to issue free of payment Mr. Ondaatjie's paper to headmen in the districts for returns, or other documents for which either ola's are now used, or for which they are not allowed stationery.\n\n3rd.\u2014The comparative price between Mr. Ondaatjie's paper and imported paper.\n\n3. It appears to me that the specimens of paper forwarded with the Government Agent's letter of 26th March last. (No. 1, here-\nwith returned) are not equal in quality to the specimens forwarded in November last, just before I returned from England. Some of these latter specimens (No. 2) are herewith enclosed.\n\nI have also put together some specimens of English and other imported paper, with the prices marked (No. 3).\n\n4. With regard to the quality of Mr. Ondaatjie's papers, it appears to me that even now they are much better than a great part of the paper manufactured in India, and extensively used in public offices there. I would however offer the remark that as Mr. Ondaatje has made so much progress towards complete success in the manufacture of common paper, he might possibly with improved machinery be able to extend that improvement, by making the paper thinner and lighter. At present, it weighs rather more than half as much again as English paper of the same description and size. If the thickness and weight were reduced, I think it might become serviceable paper.\n\n5. With regard to the second point, if His Excellency the Governor should deem it right, that stationery should be issued to the headmen for their returns, &c., doubtless, Mr. Ondaatjie's paper would answer the purpose exceedingly well. I was under the impression that one of the reasons given by Mr. Buller, the former Government Agent, for his large demand for stationery, was, that the numerous returns required to be furnished by the headmen required that stationery should be issued to them.\n\n6. Lastly, with regard to comparative price, I should for the present exclude Colombo from consideration, but if Mr. Ondaatje can supply paper equal, or rather superior, to the best of the specimens of common paper furnished by him, at 5s. a ream at Badulla, and at 5s. 6d. a ream at Kandy, and if he could also supply blotting paper made of the full size of the English blotting paper at a price increased in proportion to the increase of size, (taking his present specimen as worth 7s. at Badulla, and 7s. 6d. at Kandy), I strongly recommended that some of it should be supplied for the use of the Government Agent at Kandy, and of his Assistant at Badulla.\n\n7. The envelopes I do not at present consider necessary, as half a sheet of paper answers the purpose quite as well and can be used twice, which is not the case with envelopes, added to which 2s. 6d. per 100 is too dear for them, as they can be made here for the Colonial Secretary's Office at 2s. a hundred.\n\n8. In conclusion, I would beg to suggest that Mr. Ondaatje be invited to endeavour to submit specimens of paper of a thinner\ndescription for writing, but of the same size as those submitted last year, and also blotting of the size of the sheet of English blotting paper enclosed. If the new specimens be approved of, probably His Excellency might be disposed to allow the paper to be used by way of experiment in some of the public offices at Badulla and Kandy, in order to obtain the opinion of public officers there as to the prospect of their being able to use it with advantage.\n\n9. Having received altogether about 29 quires of the Common Foolscap paper, and about 13 quires of Blotting paper, prepared by Mr. Ondaatjie and sent down here as specimens, I would suggest that he should now be paid for this experimental paper, at the rate proposed by him, namely, 6s. 6d. a ream for the former paper and 8s. for the latter; and I may probably be able to use up this quantity of it in my own department.\n\nI have, &c,\n(Signed) W. D. Bernard,\nD. C. G.\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PALI AND THE PRAKRIT-MAGADHI OF VARARUCHI.\n\nBY JAMES D'ALWIS, ESQ., Assistant Secretary.\n\nPALI is the name given in Ceylon, and some countries in western Asia, for the dialect of the Buddhist Scriptures, which was cultivated in the kingdom of Magadha, or modern Behar, about the 6th century before the Christian era. The Sinhalese, like the Burmese, use both Pali and Magadhi to express their sacred language; whilst Indian Grammarians designate one of the dramatic dialects, the Magadhi, and also identify it with the language of Magadha.* Although, therefore, the Pali and the Magadhi are names for one and the same dialect; yet the language defined by Prakrit Grammarians as Magadhi is essentially different from the Magadhi or Pali of Ceylon, which, from the time it was banished from the country whence it derived its name, remains fixed as a dead language in this Island, unaffected by those changes which as a spoken language it has undergone in its migrations in India,\u2014assuming at one time the style (as in the Nepali Scriptures) of an \"indescribable milange in which incorrect Sanskrit bristles with forms of which some are entirely Pali and others popular\";\u2020 at another, the form of the Pillar dialect of Asoka's reign; and at last, the Magadhi of the Jains.\n\nThese differences establish many important facts in the history of Asiatic languages; and moreover, unsettle the\n\n* See Cowell's Prakrit Prakasa, p. 179, et seq.\n\u2020 L'Histoire du Buddhisme Indien, by M. Burnouf, p. 105.\nopinion generally received at the present day, as to the age of the dramatic literature, and of Vararuchi, whom some have erroneously regarded as identical with K\u0101ty\u0101yana.*\n\nTo such important questions, however, it is impossible to do justice within the confined limits of periodical literature. The object, therefore, of the following observations is, simply to shew the difference between the P\u0101li, otherwise called M\u0101gadh\u012b; and the so-called M\u0101gadh\u012b of the Pr\u0101krit Grammarians.\n\nVararuchi, in his Pr\u0101krit Prak\u0101sa, which has been translated into English by Dr. Cowell, devotes a Chapter containing 15 Sections, to exhibit the differences between the M\u0101gadh\u012b and the Sanskrit; and the following observations are confined to comparisons between those laws and the distinguishing characteristics of the P\u0101li.\n\n1. The first rule of Vararuchi is SHASOH SAH. In the P\u0101li there is no s: it has only the dental sibilants. The inapplicability of the rule, which states that in the peculiar dialect of Pr\u0101krit termed M\u0101gadh\u012b, \u2018s is substituted for sh or s\u2019 is therefore self-evident.\n\n2. JO YAH. The occasional substitution of y for j is no more a peculiarity of the P\u0101li than of the Sanskrit or Sinhalese; e.g., yamini or jamini in Sanskrit; yama or jama, Sinhalese \u2018night.\u2019 The usual P\u0101li nija is written in the Suttas with a y, as niyan puttan \u2018own son.\u2019 Instances like these, are exceptions, not the rule, in those two languages. But neither in the instance given by Vararuchi, nor in the great majority of Sanskrit words with a j, is it changed into a y in the P\u0101li. The reverse of what is given by Vararuchi may be regarded as the rule. Thus, j\u0101yate \u2018he is born,\u2019 is the same in the Pali, and is not changed into y\u0101yade. So likewise r\u0101ja is r\u0101ja, and not r\u0101ya, \u2018king;\u2019 gaja is gaja but not gaya, \u2018elephant;\u2019 vajra is vajira, but not vayara, diamond.\u2019 It is true that in words like pary\u016bshana the\n\n* Cowell\u2019s Pr\u0101krit Prak\u0101sa, p. vii.\nPali form is *payy\u0101shana*, and not *pajj\u0101usana*, as in the common Pr\u0101krit. This peculiarity in the Pali, however, does not indicate a change from *j* to *y*, but from *r* to *y*; the reason of which will be found noticed elsewhere.\n\n3. The next rule, CHAVARGASYAS PRISHTATA TATHOCH ARANAH, seems to refer to a nicety in the pronunciation of the palatal letters, which we do not perceive in the P\u0101li; and therefore proceed to the\n\n4. Hridayasya Hadakkah. This is equally inapplicable to the P\u0101li. Hridaya, 'heart' never becomes hadakka, but hadaya in P\u0101li; so likewise hrasva, 'short,' is not hadasva but rassa; hri, 'shame,' is not hida but hiri.\n\n5. Ryarjayor yyah. The substitution here spoken of *yy* for *ry* and *rj* may be regarded as the exception (and that of very rare occurrence) rather than the rule in the P\u0101li. Thus k\u0101ryam, 'to be done,' is not kayye but kariyan; and durjana, 'wicked,' is not duyyana but d\u016bjana in the P\u0101li. So again, virya, 'exertion,' becomes v\u012briya; bh\u0101rya, bhariya, 'wife'; ai\u015bwarya, issariya 'prosperity,' dhairya, dheriya 'exertion'; and also garjana becomes gajjana, 'noise.'\n\n6. Kshasya skah. This is again different in the P\u0101li. Thus rakshasah, 'demon,' does not become laskose but rakhaso; nor dakshah, 'clever,' daske, but dakkh\u0101. So likewise vriksha, 'tree,' becomes rukkha in the P\u0101li; ksham\u0101, kam\u0101, 'forgiveness'; dakshi\u1e47a, dakkhi\u1e47a, 'south'; kshura, kh\u016bra, 'razor' kshetra, khetta 'field.' This peculiarity will be found explained in another part of our observations.*\n\n7. Asmadas sau hake hage ahake. The Sanskrit ahan ban\u0101mi, 'I speak,' is the same in the P\u0101li; and does not become, as stated here hake, hage, or ahake, ban\u0101mi.\n\n8. Ata idetau lukcha. The Sanskrit etad (root) eshah (nom.) is said to be changed in the M\u0101gadh\u012b into esa, and su being added to it\u2014\u0113sa su; and the latter affix being elided, the a in esd is changed into i or e. This is not a peculiarity\n\n* Vide infra. \u00a7 10.\nof the P\u0101li in which \u0113la (root) \u0113s\u016b (nom.) becomes \u0113so r\u0101j\u016b, (esha r\u0101ja Sank,) 'this king,' and not as in the Pr\u0101krit M\u0101gadhi \u0113st l\u0101d; and esha purushah Sanskrit, becomes es\u014d puris\u014d in the P\u0101li, but not as in the Pr\u0101krit M\u0101gadhi es\u0101 pulise, 'this man.'\n\n9. KTANTAD USCHA: which is rendered by Dr. Cowell into English as follows:\u2014u is substituted when the affix su follows a word ending with the affix kta; and also (as we infer from the oha of the Suttas) we may optionally use the i or e of the preceding Suttas, or even elide the affix; as hasidu or hasidi, haside hasida, for hasitah, 'smiling.' It is only sufficient to state here that the P\u0101li knows no such thing, and that the Sanskrit hasitah is in the former simply changed into hasito.\n\n10. NASO HO VA DIRGHATWAMCHA. That is to say ha is optionally substituted for n\u0101s, the affix of the genitive singular, and at the same time the preceding vowel is lengthened, as pulis\u0101ha or pulis\u0101ssa dhane for purushasya dhanam, 'the man's wealth.' The P\u0101li form of this is purisassa dhanam, wherein the Sanskrit inflexion sya is changed to ssa, for the simple reason that the P\u0101li dislikes the union of two consonants of different classes. It is further remarkable here that dhane of the Pr\u0101krit-M\u0101gadhi is dhanam (neuter) both in the Sanskrit and P\u0101li, in which, moreover, the cerebral n is not used.\n\n11. ADIRGHAS SAMBUDDHAU. It is to be inferred from the examples given under this rule, that in the Pr\u0101krit-M\u0101gadhi dialect, the vocative inflexion a both in the singular and plural number is long. In the P\u0101li, however, the termination of the vocative singular may be either long or short, as purisa \u1e6dagachchha or puris\u0101 \u1e6dagachchha, 'O! man come.'\n\n12. CHITTHASYA CHISHTHAH. In shewing the difference of the P\u0101li from the Pr\u0101krit-M\u0101gadhi, it is here sufficient simply to exhibit the P\u0101li forms of the given examples.\n\n* See Clough's B\u0101lavat\u0101ra. p. 10.\n1. Purushah tish\u1e6dhati. Sanskrit\n2. Puriso tit\u1e6dhati. P\u0101li\n3. Pulis\u0113 chishtthadi. Mag : Prakr.\n\n13. KRINMRINGAMAM KTASYA DAH. Here again we cannot exhibit the difference of the P\u0101li from the M\u0101gadhi Pr\u0101krit, better than by placing the given examples in juxtaposition with their P\u0101li forms.\n\nSanskrit kritah, 'done' mritah, 'dead' gatah, 'gone.'\nPali kat\u00f2 mat\u00f2 gat\u00f2.\nPrak-M : kad\u00e8 mad\u00e8 gad\u00e8.\n\n14. KTWO DANIH. The following comparative view of the examples given under this rule, shows the relationship of the P\u0101li to the Sanskrit to be far nearer than that of the Pr\u0101krit-M\u0101gadhi.\n\nSanskrit, shadv\u00e0 gatch kritv\u00e0 gatah\nPali, sahitv\u00e0 gato katv\u00e0 gat\u00f2\nPrak-M. sahid\u00e0ni gade karid\u00e0ni \u00e0ude.\n\n15. SRIGALASYA SIALASIALESIALAKAH, the difference between the Sanskrit srig\u00e0lah, and the Pali sigalo is simply that occasioned by the absence of the Sanskrit ri in the latter language. But Vararuchi gives the three following forms into which that word is changed in the M\u0101gadhi-Pr\u0101krit, si\u00e0l\u00f2 si\u00e0l\u00e8 si\u00e0lik\u00e8.\n\n*The man stands.*\nON HEALTH AND DIET, WITH ESPECIAL REFERENCE TO CHILDREN AND YOUTHS, IN CEYLON.\n\nBY BARCROFT BOAKE, B.A., Vice-President, Asiatic Society, Ceylon.\n\nNONE who have had any opportunities of acquainting themselves with the past and present state of Ceylon, and who have taken any pains to avail themselves of those opportunities, can have failed to observe that the character of the climate has materially improved, as regards its effects upon the health and longevity of Europeans resident in the Island.\n\nIn former days, Trincomalee was regarded as so pestilential that it was the custom of Insurance Offices to make a special exception with reference to it stipulating that the policies which they issued were not to hold good if the person insured took up his residence there. It is not many years, indeed, since a gentleman who was making a voyage round the Island, felt himself compelled to remain on board during the whole time that the vessel in which he was a passenger remained in that port, fearing lest, by landing there he should vitiate the insurances which he had effected to a considerable amount upon his life. Many persons now prefer the climate of Trincomalee to that of Colombo.\n\nIn like manner, the road between this and Kandy was known to be very dangerous to any travellers who passed over it otherwise than rapidly and during the bright hours of the day. There are sundry grave-stones which stand close to\neach other in the Galle Face Burying Ground, which are said to be the melancholy record of the effects of the march of a single Regiment from Kandy to Colombo. The loss of human life in the construction of that road, is said to have been something fearful, and that, not only amongst the native labourers, but also amongst the European officers under whom they worked. Even within the last twenty years it was commonly stated that the Resthouse-keeper at Amb\u00e9pussa was obliged to keep up a double set of servants, as one-half were always sure to be laid up with fever. That road does not now bear so bad a character; and the town of Kandy itself is also believed to have improved very much in salubrity, since it came into the possession of the English.\n\nMuch of this improvement is no doubt attributable to alterations which have taken place in the physical features of the country. Forests have been felled, swamps drained, and the observance of some sanitary regulations enforced upon the native inhabitants.\n\nSomething, too, perhaps not a little, is due to improved habits of life on the part of the European residents. The few who have been long enough in the Island to remember the state of things which has now, thank God, passed away, and is in great measure forgotten, have strange tales to tell of the excesses which were then committed by men filling positions, the present occupants of which, if their own better principles did not (as they doubtless would) prevent them from imitating the bad example of their predecessors, would be driven from office and from society by the force of public opinion.\n\nThe day is gone by when the Officers on the Staff of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief\u2014appointments which in those days were always combined\u2014would think it consistent with their position to endeavour, when invited, in attendance upon the Governor, to dine with an ecclesiastical dignitary to entrap their host into drinking to excess; or\nwhen, supposing that any persons could be found so lost to right feeling as to make such an attempt, their host would feel it necessary to have recourse to an artifice, in order to preserve sobriety which became him as a clergyman, without being guilty of what would be regarded as inhospitality towards his guests. The state of things of which such anecdotes are indicative has passed away, never, it is to be hoped, to return, and, as a consequence of its departure, liver complaints and fevers are less frequent and less deadly; and it is now felt that, when temperance is observed, and ordinary prudence exercised in avoiding what are known to be causes of disease, life is not, to most constitutions, materially more insecure in this country than in Europe. It is quite possible that we may still have something to learn on this head, and that an improvement in medical practice, together with an increased diffusion of the knowledge of those physiological principles on which the preservation of health depends, may lead to such results as will induce Insurance Companies to grant policies on terms still more favourable than those which they at present offer to persons resident in Ceylon. It is not my intention, however, at present to enter upon this wide field, but merely to lay before you certain statistics connected with one branch of the subject, which my position has enabled me to procure.\n\nWhile the increased security of the life of the adult European resident in Ceylon is generally admitted, it is still felt to be a hazardous experiment to attempt to bring up the children of European parents in this climate; and many of us have had painful experience in our own families of the necessity of sending our children to England, when they have just arrived at that age when parental care is beginning to be of the greatest importance for the formation of their characters, and when the domestic affections can best be cultivated. If this could be shewn to be a mistake, arising\nfrom an injudicious mode of treating our children, there are, I suppose, few European parents resident in the Island, who would not hail the discovery as removing one of the most painful circumstances attendant upon the expatriation which is their own lot in life. Now, this is just the conclusion to which I have been led, by an examination of the records of the Asylum for Military Orphan Boys.\n\nThat Institution has been established for about twenty years, during the last eighteen of which it has been under superintendence. There are at present 22 boys resident in it; there have been as many as 31 or 32 at one time; the average being not I think under the present number. During the last eighteen years, only four deaths have occurred in the establishment, two of which cannot be fairly regarded as belonging to its ordinary rate of mortality, inasmuch as one was the result of leprosy, (which must be regarded as an entirely exceptional case,) while the other was that of a deformed idiot, labouring under confirmed disease, who, being left entirely destitute, was received into the Asylum merely that he might die there in peace. The ordinary rate of mortality, therefore, making these deductions, is very little over one half per cent. per annum; and even if we include the two extraordinary cases which I have mentioned, it will amount to no more than one in ninety-nine; and even the higher of these rates can scarcely be regarded as indicating any peculiar unhealthiness in the climate. Nor does the appearance of the boys lead to a different conclusion from that suggested by the low rate of mortality amongst them. They do not, of course, exhibit the florid complexions which are looked for in healthy school-boys in Europe; but they are deficient neither in strength, health, nor spirits, and amongst them might be pointed out some who, physically, are inferior to few who have been brought up in a more temperate climate. I could name one young man, who having entered the Asylum at the age of 12, left it when he was 19, in order to be employed on a Coconut\nEstate near Jaffna; after having been about four years in the Northern Province, he called upon me about a year ago, when on his way to take charge of an estate near Colombo. His appearance was such, that I remarked at the time, and the remark was confirmed by others who saw him, that had he just arrived by steamer at Galle, he would not be regarded as a bad specimen of a healthy European.\n\nAnother lad, the son of a European father by a half-caste mother, who, according to the record that we have of him in the Asylum, cannot now be more than nineteen, was apprenticed by me a few years ago to an Apothecary in Kandy. Not liking his employment, he ran away. After fruitless inquiries in several quarters, and getting one or two vessels searched, I gave him up as one of whom I was not likely to hear again. A short time ago, however, I received a letter from him, giving me some account of his adventures, and informing me that he was, when he wrote, a Serjeant in H. M. 24th Regiment, at present stationed in the Mauritius.\n\nThese facts seem to shew that the children of European parents can be reared in this country without any greater mortality than is usual in more favoured climates, and that those so reared are not inferior in spirit and energy to others of the same race. Why is it that we find the result so different with our own children? I believe the true answer to this question to be, that we do not follow a judicious system in our treatment of them. We pamper their appetites\u2014we indulge them with improper food at improper times\u2014we coax them to eat when their stomachs reject the food that we press upon them, under the mistaken notion that the exhausting character of the climate renders necessary a larger supply of food than would suffice under a lower temperature.\n\nEvery thing at the Orphan School, on the other hand, is done by rule\u2014no food of any kind is given, except at appointed hours. Unwholesome food is at all times carefully excluded. No indulgencies, in the way of a more delicate\ndiet, are allowed, except by the order of the Medical attendant, and then nothing more is given than he prescribes.\n\nA Dietary was laid down for the Institution by the late Dr. Rowe, who was Principal Medical Officer in Ceylon, about ten years ago. A few trifling alterations have been made since then, and the subjoined table shews the manner in which the food of the boys is now regulated.\n\nNo extraordinary pains are taken to preserve the boys from exposure to the sun\u2014indeed we are obliged, from the situation of the Asylum, to march them a distance of about a furlong at 8, 10, and 11 A.M., and again at 2 P.M. Their unusual health and strength is, I believe, under God's blessing, to be ascribed wholly to the judicious system that has been laid down for their management, and to the strictness with which that system has been adhered to.\n\nIf the publication of these remarks should have the effect of leading fond mothers to desist from the mistaken practice of pampering and over-feeding their children, and to adopt a regular and judicious system of feeding them, I entertain no doubt that the result will be the prevention of much of that suffering consequent upon the early breaking up of families, which, in too many instances, are never reunited on earth, and the members of which can scarcely ever acquire afterwards that domestic intimacy with each other, which is the result of early habitude.\n\nDietary.\n\n7 A.M. Coffee, bread.\n\n10 A.M. Coffee, bread, every morning. Eggs, jelly, butter, plantains, in rotation.\n\n2\u00bd P.M.

STERLING, Esq., Acting Chief Justice, in the Chair.\n\nThe Secretary read a list of the books and Periodicals received since the last meeting, viz:\u2014\n\nCalcutta Review ... ... ... 2 Nos.\nJournal of Madras Literary Society ... 2 \"\nDo Bombay Geographical Society ... 1 \"\nDo Asiatic Society of Bengal ... 1 \"\nDo Asiatic Society of Shanghai ... 1 \"\nEngineer's Journal ... ... ... 3 \"\n\nOn the system of Phonetic Alphabets, by J. E. Thompson, M.C.S., from the Author.\n\nThe following Contributions to the Museum were announced:\u2014\n\nTwelve specimens of Medicinal Oils of Ceylon, from Mr. C. P. Layard.\nA number of Dyewoods and Dyestuffs, from Mr. H. Mead.\nSamples of Plantation Coffee, from various gentlemen.\nA Jungle Cat, from Lieut. Robertson.\nA Cobra Capella, from Mr. J. Thompson.\n\nThe following gentlemen were then ballotted for, and declared elected Members of the Society:\u2014\n\nBOYD MOSS, Esq., F.R.C.S. ... {Proposed by Mr. J. Capper.\nSeconded by Mr. Jas. Alwis.\n\nJ. F. DICKSON, Esq., C.C.S. ... {Proposed by Mr. J. Capper.\nSeconded by the Rev. B. Boake.\nF. B. MAINGUY, Esq., R.E. ... Proposed by the Rev. B. Boake.\nSeconded by Mr. J. Maitland.\n\nR. A. ROBINSON, Esq., ... Proposed by Mr. J. Capper.\nand Seconded by Mr. C. A. Lorenz.\n\nC. HILL, Esq. ... Proposed by Mr. J. Maitland.\nSeconded by the Rev. J. Thurstan.\n\nIt was then moved and resolved, that Mr. C. P. Layard be elected President of this Society for the current year, in the room of the late Sir William Carpenter Rowe, and further, that the Rev. B. Boake, Mr. Lorenz, and Mr. Capper, do form a Sub-Committee to draw up a suitable expression of the Society's sense of the loss sustained by the death of its late President.\n\nMr. Maitland explained, that the sudden departure of Dr. Kelaart from Colombo, on special duty, prevented the reading of his paper on that day it would, however, be forthcoming at the General Meeting. He also exhibited a full-sized model of the iron and coir fencing proposed by Dr. Kelaart to be employed for the protection of the young Pearl Oysters on the freshly-formed beds.\n\nMr. Boyd Moss then read a paper on \"Ceylon as a residence for Europeans, considered in reference to health.\"\n\nGENERAL MEETING,\nJuly 28th, 1860.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Honorable the Chief Justice, as Vice-Patron, presided.\n\nSir E. Creasy, on taking the Chair, said:\u2014\"It is with great pride and pleasure that I have accepted the offer so kindly conveyed to me, through my friend Mr. Lorenz, of this honorable position in your Society. Although my own literary pursuits have been chiefly directed to the histories and languages of Europe, I have always taken a deep interest in Oriental ethnology, and in the historical evidences which the literature and the architectural monuments of the East supply, as to the early habitations and movements of the human race. It has also been my good fortune to have among my near connexions and friends, men, to whom the study of Asiatic antiquities and languages has been for years a favorite occupation; and among whom I have frequently heard the most important questions connected with Oriental lore discussed with ample learning and keen sagacity, and with all the freedom and vivacity of unrestrained familiar conversation. As soon as I was aware that Ceylon was to be my future\nresidence, I determined to endeavour to join this Society; though I fear that the nature of my principal former studies, and the requirements on my time which my duties will create, are likely to make me a very inefficient member of your Association. But I shall, at least, watch your labours with cordial good-will and deep attention. Ceylon and Sinhalese literature are so pre-eminently rich in ancient monuments and ancient records, that it is here we may hope to see good work done towards deciding many questions now earnestly discussed by the scholars and philologists of England and Germany.\n\nEspecially there is the great dispute which Gibbon indicated, and which is now warmly revived, whether the East really gave arts, letters, and civilization to the West, or whether all that is of any value in Oriental literature and art, was not derived from a north-western source. I intimate no opinion of my own on this or on the other great questions, as to the primary seats and early currents of population. But I know that they are questions on which many master minds are now intent, and I know that I see here an Association peculiarly qualified to throw light on them.\n\nYour researches in Statistics, in Geology, and in the Fauna and Flora of this remarkable Island, command also the deepest interest. They have indeed an immediate practical value, which ensures for them the regard of many who would pay comparatively little heed to merely literary topics. I am sure that the time which you devote to the furtherance of the objects of this Society is employed with utility to others as well as with intellectual benefit to yourselves. I once more cordially thank you for the gratifying manner in which you have enrolled me in your ranks, and pledge myself that I will do all in my power to deserve it.\"\n\nThe following gentlemen were then ballotted for, and declared elected Members, viz:\u2014\n\nCol. Ouvry, C.B. ... Proposed by Mr. J. Capper.\nSeconded by Mr. C. P. Layard.\n\nMons. P. Grimblot. ... Proposed by the Rev. B. Boake.\nSeconded by Mr. J. Capper.\n\nW. N. D. Rajapakse, Esq. ... Proposed by Mr. C. A. Lorenz.\nSeconded by Mr. C. P. Layard.\n\nThe Rev. C. Merson. ... Proposed by Mr. J. Maitland.\nSeconded by Mr. Jas.

Denison, the Governor of New South Wales, who was desirous that an exchange of specimens should take place between the Public Museum of Sydney and the Ceylon Asiatic Society, and he therefore begged to move the following resolution:\n\n\"That the Curator and Secretary be requested to communicate with the authorities of the Museum at Sydney, with the view to establishing a system of Exchanges.\"\n\nThe resolution having been seconded, was carried.\n\nMr. J. D' Alwis called the attention of the Meeting to the fact that there were several Chapters of the Mahawanso, translated by the late Mr. George Turnour, that had never been published, in the hands of that gentleman's Executors. He wished to propose the following resolution, which was seconded and adopted:\n\n\"That the Secretary be requested to communicate with the Executors of the late Mr. Turnour, with a view to obtaining their permission to print such translated Chapters of the Mahawanso as remain in manuscript in their hands.\"\nThe Rev. Mr. Boake submitted the following resolution:\u2014\n\nThat the following gentlemen be requested to form a Corresponding Committee, for the purpose of entering into communication with Scientific Societies in Europe and elsewhere, viz:\u2014\n\nThe Honorable the Chief Justice,\nMons. Grimblot.\nMr. Capper.\"\n\nSeconded by Mr. Lorenz, and carried.\n\nMr. W. Ferguson exhibited a dwarfed specimen of *Melia Azedarach*, Lin., and a plant *Holcus Sorghum*, making a few remarks respecting them.\n\nThe genus *Melia* consists of trees, the *M. Composita*, or *Lunumidella* of the Siphalese being well-known as a fast-growing and tall tree, the timber of which is so light, that it is generally used for outriggers to the fishing canoes, while the species of which a small specimen was exhibited, is well-known throughout Ceylon, as a tree generally from 10 to 20 feet in height, and commonly called the \"Flowering Margosa,\" having large branched panicles of beautiful lilac-coloured flowers.\n\nThe small specimen shewn by Mr. Ferguson was taken up and dried early in May last, and was one of several plants raised from seeds sown only three months previously, (all of which struggled for existence during the late dry weather,) but only this one was observed to flower then; but about a fortnight ago, six or seven more produced a single flower each in the same manner, some of them very large and partly monstrous.\n\nThe dried specimen shewn had still the cotyledons on; when it flowered these were \u00bd-an-inch from the ground, a small pair of opposite leaves 1 inch, and another \u00bd from the ground, while eight alternate leaves occupied other 2 inches of the stem, and then came the last leaf about \u00bc of an inch higher in the axil of which grew the sessile flower,\u2014the whole height of the plant being only 3\u00bd inches, the root, a single one, being about 5 inches long.\n\nMr. Ferguson considered this plant a good illustration of the principle, that flowers and seed vessels are merely modified forms of leaf.\n\nIn good soil and in ordinary weather, the plant in question would have become a small branching tree, but here its growth was arrested, and true to its vegetable instincts, if such a term can be used, it made desperate efforts to preserve its species by producing a flower. This flower occupies the place of the central bud of the plant; it has no calyx, but the top leaf, in the axil of which it rests, has also departed from its normal form, having divided and grown round the flower, so as to form an involucre.\nfor it. The rest of the flower, viz., petals, tube surrounding the stamens, the stamens and pistil, were a little different from their ordinary form, but in one sent to the Director of the Peradeniya Gardens the day before, the flower was much larger than ordinary, and was somewhat monstrous. These plants were grown in Mr. W. Ferguson's garden at Kollupitiya, and Mr. Ferguson has observed, that in some of them, the flowers and mid-leaf have dropped off, and the plants have taken a fresh start, but sending out two branches from the place just below where the flower was.\n\nIn connexion with the subject of dwarfed plants, Mr. Layard, the Government Agent for the Western Province, stated, that some years ago he procured from a native garden, a coconut plant of the common kind, about two Years old, which had flowers close to the ground.\n\nThe specimen of *Holcus* shown, was fully 12 feet high, and about one inch in diameter, having a large compact panicle of white seed on the summit, with several branches proceeding from the upper joints, while from the lower ones, clusters of aerial roots, like those of the screwpine, issued. The plant was taken from several growing in the garden behind the Government Offices in the Fort, raised from bazaar seeds, sown about three months previously.\n\nMr. W. C. Ondaatjie then read a paper on \"Badulla, and its Productions,\" and Mr. J. D'Alwis an article on \"Cinnamon.\"\n\n---\n\n**GENERAL MEETING,**\n\n**November 24th, 1860.**\n\n**Present:**\n\nThe Rev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nRev. J. Thurstan. Colonel Ouvry.\nP. Coomarasamy, Esq. J. D'Alwis, Esq.\nMons. P. Grimblot. R. Dawson, Esq.\nL. Nell, Esq. J. Capper, Esq.\n\nThe following Books and Periodicals were laid on the table:\u2014Madras Journal, Pamphlet on the Dugong Oil, Engineer's Journal, Meteorological Register.\n\nThe Secretary called the attention of Members to the prospectus of Messrs. Schlagentweit's work on India and Upper Asia, forwarded by the publishers, and it was resolved that the work be subscribed for.\n\nA Circular from the Secretary of State for the Colonies was also laid on the table, in which information was sought in respect to scientific works published in the Colony, Museums, &c.; also a letter from Mr. D. Wilson.\nhanding a communication from the Batavian Society of Arts. Both these documents were referred to the Committee of Correspondence.\n\nThe Secretary laid before the Meeting copies of letters from the late Dr. Buist and Sir J. Emerson Tennent to the *Athen\u00e6um*, having reference to certain passages in the work on Ceylon by the latter, in which the presence of the Fresh Water Wells in the Jaffna Peninsula near the sea is accounted for, on the supposition that they are supplied from the sea; the water becoming deprived of its salt by the filtration through the coral mass around. Dr. Buist controverts this theory as opposed to the first principles of physics, whilst in reply, Sir Emerson Tennent urges the facts brought forward by De Witt, in the Philosophical Magazine, to shew that water containing considerable quantities of saline matter in solution, may, by percolating through great masses of porous strata during long periods, be gradually deprived of its salts to such an extent as probably to render even salt-water fresh. The publication of this controversy might probably lead to some further enquiry into the matter as regards the fresh-water wells at Jaffna.\n\nThe following gentlemen were then 'balloted for, and declared duly elected:\u2014Mr. W. J. Sendall, Mr. W. C. Ondaatjie, Mr. C. P. D'Zilva, Mr. J. A. Caley, and Mr. R. Piachaud.\n\nThe undermentioned Papers were then read:\u2014\n\n\"The difference of the P\u0101li and M\u0101gadh\u012b dialects of Vararuchi,\" by Mr. J. D'Alwis.\n\n\"On Health and Diet, with especial reference to Children and Youths in Ceylon,\" by the Rev. B. Boake, B.A., Vice-President.\n\n\"On Hindu Philosophy,\" by Mr. Coomarasamy.\nANNIVERSARY MEETING.\n\nSaturday, July 6th, 1861.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Rev. B. Boake, in the Chair.\n\nColonel Ouvry. J. Maitland, Esq.\nR. V. Dunlop, Esq. Rev. J. Thurstan.\nP. Coomarasamy, Esq. W. D. Rajapakse, Esq.\nN. D. Schultze, Esq. Dr. Misso.\nW. C. Ondaatjie, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary proceeded to read the Report, as follows:\n\nIn submitting their Report for the past year, your Committee have much pleasure in pointing attention to the steady increase in the Members of the Society, and especially to the fact, that amongst those who have joined during the present year, are gentlemen eminently qualified to advance the objects of this Institution.\n\nAmongst the Papers read at the various meetings of the past season, may be found some possessing more than ordinary local interest,\u2014on \"Health and Disease of Ceylon\"; on \"Diet\"; on \"the District of Badulla and its Products\"; and on \"Cinnamon,\"\u2014whilst \"Hindu Philosophy,\" and the \"Pali Dialects\" have formed the objects of other Papers. The Society has received several interesting communications from the Government, one of which directed attention to the increasing value of the oil obtained from the \"Dugong,\" as a substitute for Cod Liver Oil, and will be found in the Appendix.\n\nYour Society has been placed in communication with the Curator of the Public Museum of New South Wales, through Sir W. Denison, and it is hoped that this may prove the means of an interchange of specimens of the products of the two countries, to the advantage of both institutions. It is also in communication with the Batavian Society of Arts, to which body copies of the Journal have been sent. Your Committee have much pleasure in noticing the receipt from the Messrs. Schlagentweit of a portion of the great illustrated work which is to record their travels and observations in Upper India, and it has been resolved to recommend to you, that the abovenamed gentlemen be elected Honorary Members of your Society, with a view to mark the appreciation of their gift, and of the great labour and scientific research expended in their work.\nThe publication of the remaining chapters of the Mahawanso, left in the hands of the Executors of the late Mr. George Turnour, has engaged the attention of your Committee, who have communicated to those gentlemen their desire to be allowed to publish the chapters in their hands, in the shape of an Appendix to the Society's Journal. To this request, however, no reply has yet been received.\n\nThe Society has also had its attention directed to the subject of \"the Fresh Water Wells of Jaffna,\" through a correspondence which took place between Sir James Emerson Tennent and the late Dr. Buist, and which correspondence will be found in the Appendix to the forthcoming issue of the Society's Journal.\n\nYour Committee cannot omit mention of the exhibition of Ceylon produce, held at the Queen's House in February last, under its direct management. The time allowed for collecting the many specimens exhibited was necessarily short, but your Committee were enabled by the active co-operation of gentlemen at outstations, to bring together a most interesting and instructive collection, illustrative of the industry and resources of the Western, Central, North-Western, and Southern Provinces. Many of the objects exhibited have been since placed in the Society's Museum, which is at length beginning to assume a proportion that will soon render a Catalogue necessary.\n\nYour Committee have recently communicated with the chief Military authorities of the Island, with a view to ascertaining whether there would be any objection to the amalgamation of the Medical Museum with that of this Society, in the event of a qualified Curator being provided for the proper custody and enlargement of the collection; and your Committee, although not as yet in possession of any reply to their application, have grounds for believing that their request will be complied with.\n\nSince the last Anniversary Meeting the Society has lost several valued members, foremost amongst whom may be named the late Sir William Carpenter Rowe, whose attachment to, and exertions on, behalf of the Society, are well known to all its members.\n\nThe Society has also experienced a loss in the death of one of its oldest and most industrious members, the late Mr. Simon Casie Chetty, who contributed some most valuable papers to your Journal, and by these and other literary labours gave evidence of not only an intimate acquaintance with Tamil literature, but of a spirit of industrious research, of patient investigation, and of scholarly discrimination, rarely to be met with in the East.\nIn recording their deep sense of these losses, the Committee are able, at the same time, to notice the accession to your body, of the present Chief Justice of Ceylon, who has already given an earnest of his good wishes on your behalf. Your Committee would also congratulate you on having obtained the valuable co-operation of so eminent a Pali scholar as Monsieur Grimblot.\n\nThis gentleman has consented to undertake the duties of Joint Secretary, and we may reasonably hope, that by the aid of his Oriental acquirements, the future proceedings of this Society will take a wider range, and assume a more elevated tone, whilst by means of translations and republications of some of the standard Historical and Buddhistical works of Ceylon, you may be the means of aiding the students of Pali literature in every part of the world. During the past year, the Society's Library has received many valuable additions, as may be seen by the Librarian's List.\n\nThe Museum has likewise been increased by many donations, chiefly of objects from the late Exhibition at Queen's House; but much yet remains to be done towards obtaining a collection of the many Raw Products of the Island, a large portion of which your Committee believe to be unknown to Europeans, but which might probably prove of considerable value as articles of export, or for local use.\n\nYour Committee regret they are unable to report that the Society's Journal, for the past year, is in a very forward state, the great pressure of work in the Government Printing Office having prevented its progress until very recently.\n\nIt would appear that, if it be thought desirable that the Journal should be published with greater rapidity, and at more frequent intervals, it will be necessary that the Society undertake the printing at its own cost. Your Committee have commenced to reprint the earlier Numbers of the Journal, for which there exists an active demand both here and in Europe.\n\nThe Treasurer will place before you a statement of the accounts of the past year, from which it may be seen that there is a balance in hand of \u00a380 11s. 9d.\n\nIn conclusion, your Committee beg to submit for your consideration, a list of the proposed Office-bearers for the ensuing year.\n\nResolved:\u2014\"That the Report now read be adopted and printed in the current Number of the Journal.\"\n\nResolved:\u2014\"That the following list of Office-bearers be adopted for the ensuing year.\"\n\nProposed by Dr. Misso.\nSeconded by R. V. Dunlop, Esq.\n\nPresident:\nSir EDWARD S. CREASY, Chief Justice.\nVice-Presidents:\n\nThe Rev. D. J. Gogerly.\nThe Rev. B. Boake.\n\nSecretaries:\n\nMonsieur P. Grimblot.\nJ.

Ondaatje, Esq.\n\nP. Coomarasamy, Esq.\nJ. D'Alwis, Esq.\nR. Dawson, Esq.\nRev. J. Thurstan.\n\nThe following gentlemen were then proposed, and after a ballot, declared duly elected Members of the Society:\n\nDr. R. Dane, P.M.O.\nG. B. Capper, Esq.\n\nThe Proceedings were terminated by a vote of thanks to the Chairman.\n\nLETTERS FROM SIR J. E. TENNENT AND DR. BUIST, TO THE \"ATHEN\u00c6UM,\" RELATIVE TO THE FRESH WATER WELLS OF JAFFNA.\n\nAllahabad, N. W. Province,\nJune 10, 1860.\n\nIn this out-of-the-way quarter of the world, where we are only beginning to replace the books the mutineers burned, and are drawing cautiously on our bookseller, in case a catastrophe of the like kind should occur again, I trust that you will pardon me for turning to a work reviewed in your pages eight months ago,\u2014Sir Emerson Tennent's \"Ceylon,\"\u2014which I have not been able to peruse, and of which I can only speak from the extracts I have read in the Athen\u00e6um and the Edinburgh Review, both of October. But the few points I desire to take up are of general and permanent interest, and have hitherto, as it seems to me, not been noticed in the manner they deserve. In both the reviews referred to, I find the following notice of the musical sounds\nheard in Chilka Lake, a salt-water creek close by Batticaloa, on the eastern shores of Ceylon:\n\n\"I distinctly heard the sounds in question. They came up from the water like the gentle thrills of a musical chord, or the faint vibrations of a wine-glass, when its rim is rubbed by a wet finger. It was not one sustained note, but a multitude of tiny sounds, each clear and distinct in itself; the sweetest treble mingling with the lowest bass. On applying the ear to the wood-work of the boat, the vibration was greatly increased in volume by conduction. The sounds varied considerably at different points, as we moved across the lake, as if the number of the animals from which they proceeded was greater in particular spots; and occasionally we rowed out of hearing of them altogether, until, on returning to the original locality, the sounds were at once renewed.\"\n\nWill your readers oblige me by comparing this with the following note I published of Musical Fishes in a salt-water creek near Bombay, in the *Bombay Times* of January, 1847:\n\n\"A party lately crossing from the promontory in Salsette called the Neat's Tongue, to near Sewree, were, about sunset, struck by hearing long distinct sounds like the protracted booming of a distant bell, the dying cadence of an Eolian harp, the note of a pitch-pipe or pitch-fork, or any other long-drawn-out musical note. It was, at first, supposed to be music from Parell floating at intervals on the breeze; then it was perceived to come from all directions, almost in equal strength, and to arise from the surface of the water all around the vessel. The boatmen at once intimated that the sounds were produced by fish, abounding in the muddy creeks and shoals around Bombay and Salsette; they were perfectly well known, and very often heard. Accordingly, on inclining the ear towards the surface of the water, or, better still, by placing it close to the planks of the vessel, the notes appeared loud and distinct, and followed each other in constant succession. The boatmen next day produced specimens of the fish\u2014a creature closely resembling in size and shape the fresh-water perch of the north of Europe\u2014and spoke of them as plentiful and perfectly well known. It is hoped they may be procured alive, and the means afforded of determining how the musical sounds are produced and emitted, with other particulars of interest supposed new in Ichthyology. We shall be thankful to receive from our readers any information they can give us in regard to a phenomenon which does not appear to have been heretofore noticed, and which cannot fail to attract the attention of the naturalist. Of the perfect accuracy with which the singular facts above related have been given, no doubt will be entertained, when it is mentioned that the writer was one of a party of five intelligent persons, by all of whom they were most carefully observed, and the impressions of all of whom in regard to them were uniform. It is supposed that the fish are confined to particular localities\u2014shallows, estuaries, and muddy creeks, rarely visited by Europeans; and that this is the reason why hitherto no mention, so far as we know, has been made of the peculiarity in any work on Natural History.\"\n\nNow, it was nearly impossible for Sir Emerson Tennent to have seen this, as it was altogether impossible for me to have known in 1847 anything about his visit to the Chilka Lake the following year; and both descriptions, which, so far as the sounds of the fish are concerned, are in perfect harmony, are those of independent observers speaking of the same phenomenon, which I doubt not in both cases admits of the same\nsolution. In 1858, the present Governor of Ceylon visited Chilka Lake; he was obviously not aware of what Sir E. Tennent had heard or seen ten years before; his book was not published till 1859. He gives the following account of the music in the water, which is as nearly as possible the same as had been previously given. Mr. Ward being once more a perfectly independent witness:\n\n\"I ought not to take my leave of Batticaloa, which I may not have an opportunity of revisiting, without mentioning the natural phenomenon for which its lake is remarkable\u2014the singing fish. I was too ill during my stay in 1857 to expose myself in the night air upon the water, and I confess that, in spite of the impression then made upon my fellow-travellers, amongst whom were Major Gen. Lockyer and Capt. Gosset, I went out upon the present occasion with a considerable amount of incredulity, and was the last to believe the evidence of my own senses; Dr. Johnston being satisfied as to the existence of a sound apparently proceeding from the water long before I could realise it. But after changing the position of the boat once or twice, there could be no doubt about the matter. The sound rose and swelled, and absolutely vibrated about us in a manner that left no question as to the fact, whatever may be the causes. Its character is indescribable. It is not like any other sound. It is only heard at night. It has nothing harmonious or musical about it. There are no modulations, no variety of notes, except what the increase and decrease in strength produced. As to its origin, nobody knows anything. It may be the fish, to whom it is popularly attributed. It may be the rush of air through rocks partially hollowed. There is nothing but conjecture to guide us in this respect. The results all can vouch for. And these results are certainly more distinct within a limited distance from the shore, though heard occasionally in deep water. I am no naturalist. I can only state what I personally saw and experienced. Others must explain it. Something similar, it is said, occurs in the Bay of Naples. It is strange that between Naples and Batticaloa there should be this one point of resemblance.\"\n\nSir Emerson Tennent describes the same thing as heard by him at the same place in 1848; but he doubts if the sounds proceeded from fish, and ascribed them to shell-fish.\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter (February, 1849) I received a few weeks after the first notice had been published:\n\n\"Musical Fish.\u2014Sir,\u2014In a late number of the Times I noticed some remarks respecting the musical fish, as they have been rather aptly termed; and it may be interesting to the readers of the Times to be informed, that the existence of such a phenomenon has been long known to the residents at Vizagapatam. I have heard the musical sounds, like prolonged notes on a harp, when rowing on the back water at that station; and they were generally supposed to proceed from the fish coming in contact with the sides of the boat. To the best of my recollection, the sounds were never heard at a distance from it.\"\u2014Bombay Times, Feb. 13.\n\nVizagapatam, on the Coromandel Coast, is 498 miles north of Madras, the shores abounding with shallow salt-water creeks, like those on the eastern side of Ceylon, and all along the Malabar Coast. I think that I have very clearly made out that musical fishes do exist in abundance;\nand as it is very difficult to conceive in what way the sounds are made under water, it would be well to have the subject more minutely inquired into.\n\nI find the following in the Journal of the Samarang. I greatly doubt if it be the same variety of fish that I have noticed that are referred to:\n\n\"Dr. Adams, the surgeon and naturalist of the expedition, says:\u2014\n'While on board the brig Ariel, then lying off the mouth of the river of Borneo, I had the good fortune to hear that solemn aquatic concert of the far-famed organ fish, or drum\u2014a species of Pogonias. These singular fishes produce a loud monotonous singing sound, which rises and falls, sometimes dies away, or assumes a very low drumming character; and the noise appeared to proceed mysteriously from the bottom of the vessel. This strange submarine chorus of fishes continued to amuse us for about a quarter of an hour, when the music, if so it may be called, suddenly ceased, probably on the dispersion of the band of performers.'\"\n\nSir Emerson Tennent notices the fact of all the wells along shore which keep their water during the dry season, being below high-water mark, and that to a small extent they rise and fall with the tides; and he assumes that they owe their water to the sea, which loses its saline matter by percolation. Nothing, surely, is more utterly opposed to the first principles of Physics than the doctrine, that salt held in chemical solution by water should be capable of being separated from it by the mechanical process of filtration. The phenomenon of tides in wells of moderate depth dug near the sea, is of universal occurrence all along the Malabar Coast, where the matter dug through is porous. It does not obtain in wells dug through trap. I have observed it hundreds of times at Bombay, and have often had occasion to describe it. The explanation is easy. The surface of the ground where the well is dug being always six or eight feet above high and twenty to twenty-six feet above low water, and being extremely spongy and porous down to where it comes in contact with the rock, or the blue-clay bed which commonly lies over the rock, it gets charged full of water during the rains. The superior length of column enables this to expel the sea water, a proceeding which must have been completed shortly after the emergence of the land from the sea; while the interstices in the porous soil are so minute as to prevent the two mingling. As the saltiest sea water has only a specific gravity of 1\u00b7050, the fresh water ponded back from it requires only to be proportionally higher in level to create an equilibrium. With a greater head than this, it will push the wall of salt water before it, and flow off. Of all this I have seen abundant examples at Bombay. It would occupy too much of your space to describe them. After six or eight months of rainless weather, when the discharge from the soil becomes feeble, the wells all become more or less brackish, and the apparent tide increases.\"\nThe Edinburgh Review states that this theory of Sir E. Tennent's, of the desalinization of sea water by filtration (as already said, a phenomenon opposed to one of the first laws of Chemistry) explains the occurrence of fresh water on coral islands, and confutes the theory of Darwin, that this arises from rain; as rain falling on a substance already fully saturated with sea-water would not be absorbed, but would flow off. Not a doubt of it. But coral islands are not only not saturated, but so much of them as is above the sea-level, three or four feet, is highly porous and perfectly dry, and presents all the conditions for absorbing the whole of the rain that falls on them. They present to the rain this much head of water to push out the sea and expel it piston-wise so far as the coral bed descends,\u2014the sea itself forming the wall of the reservoir. A well dug deep into the coral to draw off the rain-water, with which it is always nearly saturated up to low-water mark, is sure to secure a supply. An illustration of the two not mixing together, if the pores of the soil, rock or coral, be fine enough, may be obtained by making the experiment with capillary tubes.\n\nThe red colour with which the sea is tinged round the shores of Ceylon, during a part of the S.W. monsoon, is due to the Proto-coccus niralis, or the Himatta-coccus, which presents different colours at different periods of the year\u2014giving us the seas of milk as well as those of blood. The coloured water at times is to be seen all along the coast north to Kurrachee, and far out, and of a much more intense tint in the Arabian Sea. The frequency of its appearance in the Red Sea has conferred on it its name.\n\nOur author mentions terraces of marine shells embedded in agglutinated sand as prevailing all around the island at a level considerably above highwater mark. The same thing obtains all around the shores of the Mauritius, the Eastern Archipelago, the shores of Hindustan, the Arabian Sea and Red Sea, and, I believe, along the coasts of nearly all the seas in the world. The Reviewer states truly, that \"this is an unquestionable evidence of an upheaval\u2014the evidence of subsidence is more difficult to obtain.\" He is mistaken. From Cape Comorin to Kurrachee on the one side, and so all around the shores of the Bay of Bengal on the other, multitudes of mangrove roots, their fibres unbroken, and obviously existing where they grew, are found embedded in blue marine clay, from ten to twenty feet below the raised beaches, the surfaces of which, when formed, must themselves have been below half-tide,\u2014as clear an evidence of a previous depression as the beaches are of an upheaval.\nI trust I shall not be for a moment supposed inclined to criticize, much less to correct, this admirable and obviously most attractive work. I have taken some texts from it, from which to give some brief discourses on points of natural history which seem of interest, and which, though perfectly familiar to the old Indian, seem scarcely to have reached the English naturalist at all.\n\nGeo. Buist.\n\nLondon, August 11, 1860.\n\nI have seen in the Athen\u00e6um of this morning the interesting letter of Dr. Buist, dated Allahabad, June 10, in which exception is taken to a passage in my recently published work on Ceylon, where I have ventured to offer a simpler solution of the phenomenon of the steady supply of fresh water in wells sunk in coral islands, than that heretofore resorted to,\u2014namely, the conjecture that the flow consists of rain-water imbibed from the surface, and banked in by the surrounding pressure of water from the sea. This theory, which was first broached in Admiral FitzRoy's \"Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle,\" and in Darwin's \"Naturalist's Journal,\" is thus propounded in the latter, when speaking of the Keeling Islands, in the Indian Ocean, south west of Sumatra, one of those \"atoll\" groups, in the islets of which there are wells from which ships obtain water:\u2014\"At first sight,\" says Darwin, \"it appears not a little remarkable that the fresh water should regularly ebb and flow with the tides; and it has even been imagined that sand has the power of filtering the salt from the sea-water.\" The compressed sand, or porous coral rock, is permeated like a sponge with the salt water; but the rain which falls on the surface must sink to the level of the surrounding sea, and must accumulate there, displacing an equal bulk of the salt water. As the water in the lower part of the great sponge-like mass rises and falls with the tides, so will the water near the surface; and this will keep fresh, if the mass be sufficiently compact to prevent much mechanical mixture.\"\u2014Darwin's \"Naturalist's Journal,\" chap. xx. Dr. Buist's explanation corresponds with that of Darwin; but Darwin, as it will be seen, glances at, although he rejects the theory of filtration from the sea; whilst Dr. Buist urges, that \"Nothing is more utterly opposed to the first principles of physics than the doctrine that salt held in solution by water should be capable of being separated from it by the mere mechanical process of filtration.\" Dr. Buist, however, is not aware that since Darwin wrote, the late Mr. Witt, in a remarkable paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for 1856, \"On a Peculiar Power possessed by Porous Media of removing Matters from Solution in Water\" has made known the results of\nexperiments carried on by him on behalf of one of the London water-supply Companies, and has shewn that \"water containing considerable quantities of saline matter in solution, may, by percolating through great masses of porous strata during long periods, be gradually deprived of its salts, to such an extent as probably to render even salt water fresh.\"\n\nThe difficulty which I felt in applying Darwin's ingenious theory to the small coral islands in which fresh water abounds, as well as to wells sunk in the coral formation at the north of Ceylon, arose from the fact, that in the latter, rain falls with such proverbial infrequency as to be inadequate to furnish the supply of fresh water invariably present; whilst in the numerous little coral islands to the west, the area of each is so minute, that their surface, even in the most rainy seasons, could not intercept enough to replenish the wells. Mr. Witt's discovery came opportunely to aid, and facts are recorded in other portions of my book (vol. 1, p. 20; vol. 2, p. 536) besides those which alone Dr. Buist appears to have seen, that in my mind establish the fact that these wells are supplied, not by the banking in of rain by the surrounding salt water, but by the slow percolation of water from the sea through the masses of porous coral.\n\nJ.

B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\nThe Secretary referred to the arrangement for the transfer of the Military Medical Museum to the Society, which had been completed by the Secretary receiving the Museum keys.\n\nThe conditions of the transfer were then read and confirmed; one of these declared that all Military Medical Officers now resident, or who may hereafter reside in Ceylon, be Honorary Members of the Society without entrance fee or subscription.\n\nThe following papers were then submitted to the Meeting:\n- Descriptive notices of the Raw Products of Ceylon by H. Mead.\n- The Quassia wood of Ceylon by W. C. Ondaatjie.\n- The Medicinal substances of the Native Bazaars by W. Ferguson.\n- On the Buddhist Scriptures by J. De Alwis.\n- Notes on the rain-fall in Colombo during 6 years accompanied by tables and a diagram by J. Capper.\n\nGeneral Meeting, March 7th, 1863.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\nThe Secretary reported the progress made in regard to the increased accommodation required for the Society's Museum in consequence of the amalgamation with it of the Military Medical Museum.\nThe Governor had approved of the proposed plan for adding a floor to the present building, by which means it would be made to correspond with the opposite wing of the buildings occupied by the Treasury, but there were difficulties in carrying out the plan, owing to the large amount of work on hand in the Civil Engineer's Department. The cost of the building was estimated at \u00a3450 and there was no doubt that His Excellency would sanction the appropriation of such a sum. At present the contents of the Military Museum remained in their original rooms which might at any time be required for other purposes.\n\nAfter reading a list of the books and Periodicals received since the last meeting and the election of new members, the following papers were read.\n\nOn the romanization of the Sinhalese Alphabet by R. C. Childers, Esq.\n\nRemarks on the weather during 1862 by J. Maitland, Esq.\n\nTranslation of a portion of the Salalhini Sanxeo by R. C. Childers, Esq.\n\nGeneral Meeting, October 31st, 1863.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nAfter the transaction of general business the Secretary reported that the Governor had sanctioned the introduction into the Supply Bill for 1864 of a vote for \u00a3513, the estimated cost of enlarging the premises occupied by the Society, in order to enable it to receive the Museum of the Military Medical Department.\n\nMr. Ondaatjie exhibited a specimen of the inspissated juice of the Alstonia Scholaris, which he stated to be a substitute for Gutta-percha. It possesses the same properties and is as workable as the latter. It readily softens when plunged into boiling water, is soluble in Turpentine and Chloroform, receives and returns impressions, and is adapted for seals to documents. The tree abounds with milky juice like the Gutta-percha, has a fleshy bark and porous wood, and belongs to the order Apocynea.\nThe following papers were then read\u2014\n\nOn the air-breathing fishes of Ceylon by Rev. B. Boake.\nOn Devil Worship by D. De Silva Gooneratne Modliar.\nBuddha's First Sermon translated by Rev. D. J. Gogerly, contributed by Rev. R. S. Hardy.\nThe Origin of the Sinhalese language by James Alwis, Esq.\nBuddha's discourse on caste by L. De Zoysa, Esq.\nOn the poisoning properties of the Calotropis Gigantea by W. C. Ondaatjie, Esq.\n\nGeneral Meeting, September 3rd, 1864.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nThe Secretary made a brief statement in reference to the position of the Society and the arrangements in regard to the Museum.\n\nLast year Sir C. MacCarthy promised a public grant for the purpose of enlarging the Society's rooms, to enable it to receive the collection presented by the Military Medical Department. On the faith of this promise the Society paid to the Medical Department from its limited funds about \u00a3502, being the value of the cases and stands containing the collection. A vote of \u00a3513 was placed in the Supply Bill for 1864 for enlarging the premises, but was afterwards withdrawn. This year the Committee applied to Government for \u00a3100 to enable it to receive a portion of the Military Museum within the existing premises, to which request the Government replied that there were no funds at its disposal, and the vote could not be entertained in the Supplementary Supply Bill for this year. The balance of the Society's funds in the hands of the Treasurer was only \u00a315, it was therefore impossible to go on with the printing of the Journal.\n\nThe following gentlemen were elected members of the Society:\u2014\nMessrs. R. Tatham, J. Winzer, C. Ferdinand, J. Martensz, W. H. Harrison, R. Jones.\n\nThe following new rules was proposed and adopted:\u2014\n\n\"That members returning from Europe be allowed to rejoin without any further payment than the current subscription.\"\nPapers were then read\u2014On the origin of the Sinhalese language, Part II. by J. De Alwis, Esq.\n\nOn Taxidermy by W. H. Harrison, Esq.\n\nPapers relating to the surrender of the Dutch Forts to the British from the Dutch records by Mr. W. Gonetilleke.\n\nGeneral Meeting, Saturday, May 13th, 1865.\n\nThe Rev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nThe Secretary read a report setting forth the absence of any fresh papers for reading, and the state of the Society's funds. The Governor had declined to give the sum of \u00a350 in addition to withholding the vote for adding to the accommodation of the building to enable it to receive the articles from the Military Medical Museum.\n\nSubscriptions for the current year had not been collected, as it was not clear that it was desirable to ask for them, as no business had been transacted.\n\nAt the conclusion of the report Mr. Capper expressed his wish to resign the Office of Secretary, it was resolved accordingly, that Mr. Steward be appointed Secretary, and that the thanks of the Society be given to Mr. Capper for his services during the long time he had acted as Secretary. It was also resolved \"that a deputation should wait upon the Governor shortly after his arrival in Colombo, to request His Excellency to become the Patron of the Society, and at the same time to urge its claims to a small grant from the Public funds, and that the deputation should consist of Sir Edward Creasy, Mr. Layard, Mr. Wall, Mr. Lorensz, Mr. Capper and the Secretary.\"\n\nGeneral Meeting, November 2nd, 1865.\n\nPresent:\u2014The Chief Justice Sir Edward Creasy, in the Chair.\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Justice Temple, Rev. B. Boake, Rev. J. Nicholson, Messrs. J. A. Caley, C. A. Lorensz, R. Dawson, J. P. Green, W. C. Ondaatjie, W. Ferguson, L. De Zoysa, G. S. Steward.\nThe following gentlemen were proposed and elected Members of the Society.\n\nThe Rev. J. S. Mill, S. T. Richmond, Esq., George Hawkins, Esq., Hugh Nevill, Esq., A. Primrose, Esq., Mr. Holdsworth was also proposed and elected an Honorary Member.\n\nThe following motions were then proposed and carried:\n\n1st. Proposed by Dr. Fraser, seconded by Mr. Lorensz, that the Chief Justice, the Bishop, and the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Temple be requested to become Vice-Patrons of the Society.\n\n2nd. Proposed by the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Temple, seconded by J. A. Caley, Esq.\n\nThat the Committee do consist of the following gentlemen:\n\nPresident.\nDr. Fraser.\n\nVice-President.\nThe Rev.

Ferguson, Esq., R. Dawson, Esq., K. Jones, Esq., J. De Alwis, Esq.\n\n3rd. Proposed by Mr. Dawson, seconded by Mr. Green, that the Librarian be requested to ascertain by an examination of the books in the library, what books have been mislaid.\n\n4th. Proposed by Major Skinner, seconded by Mr. Dawson.\n\nThat in future any member, who wishes to obtain the loan of a book, shall make application in writing for it to the Librarian, who shall file the application and make a record both of the issue and the return of the books.\n\n5th. Proposed by Mr. Nicholson seconded by Mr. Ferguson, that the conservator be requested to compare the specimens in the\nMuseum with the list given in the Appendix to the 6th Report, and report the result of the enquiry to the Committee.\n\nMr. Lorensz stated that he had a sum of \u00a360 in the bank in his name as Treasurer of a Society which once existed here called the Athen\u00e6um, and said that he thought it might be made use of by the Society for the purpose of bringing out the Journal. Some conversation was carried on as to the legality of this, and it was determined that Mr. Lorensz should write to all the shareholders, whose addresses he could discover, to ask their permission to appropriate their funds to the purpose mentioned.\n\nCommittee Meeting, November 18th, 1865.\n\nPresent:\u2014Dr. Fraser, Rev. B. Boake, C. P. Layard, Esq., G. Hawkins, Esq., G. S. Steward, Esq.\n\nThe question of the appointment of a Librarian at the last General Meeting was discussed and it was determined that the Secretary should see Mr. De Zoysa and ask him if he would be willing to act as joint Librarian with the Secretary, and that a General Meeting should be called as soon as possible to settle the difficulty.\n\nThe following additions to the Library were laid on the table:\u2014\n\nAnswers from Government Agents of Galle, Jaffna and Matura, to questions addressed to them on the Natural History of their Provinces.\n\nProceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for May, June and July, 1865.\n\n3 Nos.

Steward.\n\nMr. Boake reported that he had received a letter from Sir Edward Creasy saying that His Excellency the Governor had consented to become the Patron of the Society.\n\nThe question of the late appointment of a Librarian was then discussed and it was agreed that Mr. De Zoysa should be asked to act as sole Librarian, which he consented to do.\n\nMr. W. Ferguson, Mr. J. A. Caley were added to the Committee.\n\nIt was determined that subscriptions should be considered due in January of each year, and that members who have not paid by the end of the year shall be considered to have relinquished their connection with the Society.\n\nMr. De Zoysa presented a copy of a Dictionary of the Pali language by Mogallana Thero with English and Sinhalese notes by Waskaduwe Subkati, Buddhist Priest.\n\nCommittee Meeting, December 9th, 1865.\n\nPresent:\u2014Rev.

Why, or how this is so\u2014whether it is founded on any innate, morbid quality of the human heart, which men find it difficult to resist under certain circumstances, or on any intrinsic truth inherent in the nature of the thing itself, or only on mere ignorance, it is as far from my present purpose, as it is beyond my humble abilities, to discuss here. But that the belief really exists will hardly admit of a doubt.\n\nThis belief has, according to the amount of intelligence and civilization possessed by those among whom it prevails, given rise to various systems of superstition, of which some are of the most\ndebasing and revolting character. And although there is scarcely a single country in the world, in which this belief does not more or less prevail in some form or other, yet we do not think there is any, in which it has developed itself in such gigantic proportions, or such hideous forms, as in this beautiful Island. Elsewhere it may sometimes exercise considerable influence and even command many devoted votaries; but here it has been moulded into a regular religion, arranged and methodized into a system, and carefully preserved in writing: so that the amount of influence, which it exercises over the thoughts, the habits, the every day life of a Singhalese, is such as can hardly be believed by a stranger to the character of a genuine Singhalese Buddhist.\n\nA series of writers commencing with Knox and ending with Sir Emerson Tennent, have, at different periods, during the last 200 years, given to the public the results of their enquiries and experience in matters connected with this Island, in a number of interesting and able works of which Sir Emerson's is the last and the greatest: yet none of these writers seem to have perceived, in any adequate degree, the extraordinary amount of gross superstition which prevails among the people, of whose manners, customs, and history they professed to treat; not that they have omitted to mention the worship of gods and demons, as well as Buddhism and a few other superstition, as existing among our countrymen, and even in some instances, gone into considerable details respecting them, but they do not appear to have been fully aware of the extraordinary degree of influence they exercise over the mind of a Singhalese. This is owing partly to the circumstance of these writers being Englishmen, mostly unacquainted with the native languages, and partly to a certain reluctance, which a demon-worshipper always feels, to communicate full and unreserved information to a stranger who professes a different religion, suspecting that the object of the Englishman, in seeking for information respecting a system in which he himself does not believe, is only to publish it in his books and newspapers, and thereby expose it to public ridicule.\nIn the following pages, we propose to class the different forms of superstition prevailing among our countrymen, under the following heads, viz.:\u2014I. Demonism, or the worship of demons or evil spirits; II. Capuism, or the worship of gods, demigods, and deified heroes; III. Grahaism, or the worship of planets and stars; IV. Miscellaneous Superstitions, or such as cannot properly be classed under any of the preceding heads. Not only will each of these be found to be distinct from the rest in all material points, but they also appear to have originated in the Island at different periods of time.\n\nIt is not easy, however, to fix definitely any particular period of time as that in which any of these systems of superstition first originated in the Island, no positive information of a very reliable character being supplied by any records of native annals now extant. Nevertheless the most reasonable supposition, and one which is supported by all who have touched upon the subject, and, to a certain extent, by the native historical records themselves, is, that the greater portion of them existed here at a very early period, long anterior to the commencement of the Christian era.\n\nWith the exception of Buddhism (also which is partly, though in some few respects only, based upon Brahminism) every species of superstition, science, or literature, which exists among the Singhalese, with certain exceptions of minor importance, may be traced, more or less directly to Brahminism and its Vedas and Shasters. Whether this is solely a consequence of Wijeyo's invasion (543 B.C.), or whether any portion of them, such as the worship of demons and of planets, had existed here even before that event, and only became assimilated to the Brahminical doctrines itself in subsequent times, it is not easy to decide; but yet, if the wild, ignorant savages, who inhabited this Island, when Wijeyo landed on it, and whom Native Chroniclers have styled demons, did profess any form of worship, as no doubt they must have done, it is more likely that it related to demons and planets, than to anything else. Men steeped in complete barbarism and ignorance, separated by their insular position from the rest of the world, attributing, with\nthe first impulse of uneducated nature, a supernatural agency to natural causes and events, when these were beyond the comprehension of their simple intellects, and naturally impelled, therefore, in the absence of any other form of religion calculated to fill up the void in their minds, to embrace any which their untutored passions and feelings, and their immediate wants and conveniences suggested to them, as the best\u2014men such as these are likely to coin for themselves a religion, which in every respect corresponds with their own dispositions. Sickness and death, the most direful calamities of life, with the many dreadful circumstances generally attending them, are, of all causes, those which would naturally, in those early ages of the world, excite, in an ignorant and simple mind, feelings of supernatural terror; and the rise, among such a people, of a system of worship, in which every form of disease and suffering is attributed to the agency of demons, must cease to excite wonder in any mind. If Demonism did actually exist here previous to the invasion of Wijeyo, as we think it did, a multitude of other causes and circumstances, which followed that event, as consequences of it, must have cooperated to bring it into its present condition, with its charms and spells and invocations to the Hindoo deities. These changes appear to have been going on till within the last 3 centuries.\n\nBut though we are not able to fix the exact period at which Demonism originated in the Island, we have enough of evidence to prove, that its origin could not have been later than the fifth century; for the seventh Chapter of Maha Wanse, a work whose authenticity has never been called in question, makes mention of Balli* offerings, made to demons at the time of Wijeyo, that is five and a half centuries before the Christian Era; which shews, that, even if Demon-worship did not prevail here in the days of Wijeyo, it did so\n\n* Although the books of the demon priests direct that a balli or image of any demon invoked on any occasion, should be formed, and offerings be made to it, yet in point of practice this image, or balli, has generally been dispensed with in modern times.\n\nThere is another species of balli made to represent, not demons, but Planet gods. These will come to be noticed under the head Grahaim.\nin the days of Maha Nama Terunnanse, who was engaged in the composition of that historical work, between the years 459 and 477 A.D., that is nearly 1400 years ago.\n\nGrahaism may, with equal reason, be supposed to have been a system of still more ancient origin; the sun, moon, and stars being the first objects of wonder, which are calculated to rouse, in an ignorant mind, feelings of superstitious adoration. But, as it at present exists, it appears to be almost wholly an emanation from Brahminism. While Capuism, on the other hand, is a mixture of Hindooism and of a more refined species of Demonism, the first derived from the continent, the latter of indigenous growth, and both mixed together into a heterogeneous system, originating probably at a period later than the two former.\n\nAlthough Buddha is said to have visited Ceylon three several times before its conquest by Wijeyo, his religion was not established in it till the reign of Dewanan Piatisse, who ascended the throne 307 B.C., nearly 236 years after Buddha's death. But, from the first day of its introduction into the Island, its success seems to have been very rapid; and indeed from the despotic nature of the government, and the religious enthusiasm of the king, assisted as it was by the proselytizing spirit of Dharma Soka of India (the grandson of him who has been called Sandracotta by the Greek writers) its success could not but have been certain, immediate, and complete. But demonism was not displaced by it. It only took a subordinate rank. Buddhism acknowledges the existence of demons, and connives at, if it does not openly countenance, the practice of demon-worship, or at least of a great deal which belongs to it. Buddhism does not hold out worldly advantages or immediate rewards in this life to its votaries, so much as demonism does. Its task is the graver one, of pointing out a way (though an erroneous one) of obtaining salvation for the soul; an object which is to be attained, only after passing through many transmigrations of the soul, through countless millions of years\u2014a consummation, therefore which, however devoutly wished for by a Buddhist, is still one to be attained only in another state of existence, at some\nunknown distant period of time. Demonism, on the other hand, deals with the concerns of this life, and of this life alone. This, therefore, appeals more strongly to the passions and feelings, in as much as it relates to things nearer, and present. Hence, demonism never lost its hold on men's minds, but, on the contrary, it still continues to be the most popular of all forms of worship prevailing among the Singhalese.\n\nThe period, at which demonism seems to have been fashioned into the form it still retains, is that which intervened between the eleventh and the sixteenth centuries, during which, owing to the numerous wars which were incessantly waged between the princes of this Island and those of Southern India, thousands of Malabars often became residents, as captive slaves or as freemen, among the Singhalese, and imparted to the latter, many of their own peculiar superstitions and notions, so that many fresh additions were made to demonism, both in the number of demons, and, especially, in the introduction of a large number of charms or spells recited at every demon ceremony now; so much, indeed, does this appear to have been the case that more than seven-eighths of the charms, belonging to Singhalese Necromancy, are in the Tamil language; a circumstance which has led many to believe, that demonism is altogether an importation from the continent. During the last three centuries, no changes whatever seem to have been made in it, or if any, only of a very trifling nature, and that too, more in the gradual alterations of the language used in the invocations, than in anything else. Knox's short account of the form of demon-worship, which prevailed at the time he was a captive in this Island, that is 200 years ago, seems, judging even from the little he has said on the subject, to be exactly the form of worship, which at this day prevails among the people.\n\nThus, besides Buddhism, properly so called, there are three other forms of worship, which enter into the religious creed of a Singhalese, namely Demonism, Capuism, and Grahaism. In addition to these, there are also a variety of other minor superstitions, considered to be quite necessary to his welfare, and which, though of minor\nimportance, do engage, and will continue to engage, his serious attention, so long as he continues to be a Buddhist. As the first of these, viz., Buddhism, relates only to his spiritual interests, affecting him in another life, so the last three concern his temporal interests in this life; the fruits of the first being tasted only in another state of existence, while those of the last are enjoyed immediately and during every moment of this life. To which of these therefore a Singhalese resorts oftenest, and with the greatest eagerness, it is easy to imagine. He has one religion for his soul, and another for his body, both highly reverenced, and maintained as essential to his well being; a convenience which, as far as we are aware, no other nation in the world possesses.\n\nThe most remarkable feature in the character of a Singhalese is, not that he is a follower of any one of these superstitious systems, but that he is a follower of each and all of them at one and the same time; for the doctrines of some of these appear to be contradictory to, and inconsistent with, each other. For instance, Grahaism maintains, that the movements of the Planets influence man in every thing; that sometimes they bring disease, death, poverty and every other imaginable misery, not only on himself, but sometimes even on those connected with him; that at other times they give him health, wealth, honours, happiness, and every thing else desirable; but that all the aforesaid calamities may be prevented by propitiating the planets by certain ceremonies. On the other hand, the fundamental doctrine of the religion of Buddha, being, that every man is what he is, owing to Karma, that is, to the nature of what he has done, good or bad, in a previous state of existence, Buddhism, or at least every Buddhist Priest admits, in a spirit of compromise, as it were, that many of the calamities or turns of good fortune, which befall men, do take place according to the movements of the planets, but contend, that these movements are not arbitrary and optional with the planets themselves; that they are the result of a certain fixed order according to which the planets must move; that the planets are only a sort of intermediate agents, serving merely as blind instruments in the hands of Karma, to prefigure to the\nworld the various changes of fortune, which must come upon each man according to his Karma, that is, according to his good or bad deeds in a former life; and that no propitiation of the planets, or of any power whatsoever, in the whole universe, can ward off calamities, or hinder happiness and prosperity, deserved by a man on account of this inexorable Karma. Nevertheless, a Singhalese contrives to believe in all the four systems, and to be, at the same time, recognized as an orthodox Buddhist; and it would be a rare thing to meet with any one, who, in point of practice, is a votary of only one or two of the systems. The influence which these systems command, notwithstanding such inconsistencies as the above, may be judged of from the fact, that the Buddhist Priest himself, the very teacher and expounder of the religion of Buddha, has sometimes recourse to Grahaim and even to Demonism. Before we proceed further, we shall make a few more general remarks on each of these systems.\n\nI. Demonism is regarded as a means of guarding against sickness, and of curing it when it is supposed, as it almost always is, to be caused by a demon, and also as a means, in the hands of any man, of inflicting death, disease, or other calamity, on other men. A subordinate object of it is the accomplishment of purposes different from the above, such as that of protecting the fruits of a tree from pillage, of creating discord and hatred between the different members of a family, of gaining the affections of a woman, of discovering treasures hidden in the ground, and other similar purposes. The demons are regarded as beings only influenced by the worst of motives towards mankind, without a sentiment of pity, justice, or kindness, in their nature. They are made instrumental in curing diseases, as well as in inflicting them. They are to be coerced by spells, and propitiated with offerings and particular ceremonies. They cannot affect the spiritual welfare of a man in any way; but can only cause death at the most. A Singhalese demon, therefore, is a different kind of being from the demon of European superstitions or from the Diabolus of the New Testament. For, while the object of the latter is to ruin for ever the soul of a man, that of the\nDEMON WORSHIP.\n\nformer is only to injure the body. A Singhalese demon is himself a being subject to death, like all other beings recognised by Buddhism, although that event may in some instances take place only at the end of some tens of thousands of years. This difference arises from the Buddhist doctrine, that there is no state of perpetual existence for any being; that happiness or misery can never be perpetual; that the rewards or punishments for the actions of one life will be reaped in one or more states of existence afterwards, and then come to an end; and that mere obedience to a demon does not necessitate any disobedience to one's religion.\n\nIn every other form of worship, which exists among men, whether it be Buddhism, Capuism, Mohammedanism, Brahminism, or any other, the objects of worship are always regarded with feelings of veneration by their votaries; but in Demonism alone, no such feelings exist in the heart of the worshipper, whose worship consists only in trying to induce them by flattery, and offerings, or to coerce them by threats, to cure, or to inflict some disease, or to secure a man from becoming liable to it at all. And yet neither the rites of Buddhism, nor of Capuism, nor even of Grahaism, are more frequently and eagerly resorted to, than those belonging to the worship of demons, who, instead of being objects of religious veneration, are only objects of indescribable dread.\n\nOne of the main differences between an educated and an uneducated intellect seems to be this\u2014that, while the former always aims at analysis, at generalization, at resolving the mysterious and the marvellous into natural causes, at laying open the hidden and inscrutable things of nature, the latter takes the directly opposite course of indulging in the unreasonable and unaccountable pleasure of throwing a veil of mystery and darkness even over those things, which, if it were to view them rationally, it might understand, and of endeavouring, as often as possible, to give \"a local habitation and a name\" to what has neither. Nowhere is this strange peculiarity of the uncultivated intellect perceived in a more tangible form than in the demonology of the Singhalese.\n\nAs may naturally be expected in such a system, created and\nupheld merely by popular superstition, we find that not only are many of its tenets sometimes contrary to each other, but that the Cattadiyas (demon priests) and even the very books, which lay down the principles of their system, often differ from each other, so much so, indeed, that it is very difficult for any one, undertaking to give a connected and consistent account of the Demonism of Ceylon, to avoid sometimes making in one part of his account a statement inconsistent with another in another part of it. But as far as the Cattadiyas and their followers are themselves concerned, such difficulties are easily surmounted, by their attributing all such contradictions, if pointed out, to the mysteries of the art, and to their own ignorance, rather than to any fault of the system itself.\n\nThe Priests of Demonism are styled Yakaduras, Yakdessas, or more commonly, Cattadiyas; and there is scarcely a single village in the Island, which does not boast of at least one. Nearly twelve months are spent in learning the trade, the most laborious and principal part of the task of a beginner being, to commit to memory the charms, invocations, and songs, which are essential to his vocation. What the number of these is, may be estimated from the fact, that some of the demon-ceremonies commence at 6 or 7 p.m. and, lasting without intermission throughout the whole night, close only about 6 or 7, and sometimes later, the next morning; during all which time the performer has to repeat from memory all his charms and songs, only now and then interrupted by a violent bout of dancing. The dancing and the singing generally go on together, except when the former happens to be of so violent a nature, as to render it impossible to continue the other along with it. The profession was in early times exclusively confined to the low Castes, such as Tomtom Beaters, Durayas, and Jaggeries, but at present there is no such exclusiveness, men of every caste betaking themselves to it. The first man who ever practised the art, is said to have been one Pradeys Rosia.\n\nA Cattadiya, who is a priest, though it be of demons, is yet never looked upon as in any way distinguished from the rest of the people by any supposed sanctity of character, or by a superior degree of\nintelligence; he wears no particular badge or dress like the Buddhist Priest, and receives no particular respect from any one;\u2014his ordinary life and avocations are like those of his neighbours; and as the members of his fraternity in the same village sometimes amount to three or four, his professional income does not suffice for his maintenance. He is therefore obliged to betake himself to some other supplementary business to increase his income. His profession is looked upon only as any ordinary calling, and commands no more respect than that of a boatman, a boutique keeper, a toddy drawer, or any other common trade. There is nothing of a sacred character belonging to it, as to that of the Buddhist Priests.\n\nII. Capuism, like Demonism, also refers to the interests of this world; but while the object of the latter is to inflict or cure diseases by the agency of demons, the object of the former is to protect men generally against all manner of evil, and from diseases of a particular kind, such as small pox, chicken pox, and any epidemical disease of a malignant nature, and more especially to render prosperous the various avocations and trades of the people. The dewiyo or gods, who are the objects of worship in Capuism, are a more exalted class of beings, not possessed of the same evil dispositions as the demons, nor bringing like them sickness and death on innocent people; but reserving their powers of doing evil only for the punishment of those, who in any way displease them. But the punishment they inflict is always out of proportion to the nature of the offence. Although not so malignant as the demons, they are yet revengeful and irascible in their nature. They are more properly called dewataswo or inferior gods, and are propitiated by particular ceremonies. The priests of this worship are called Capuas. The priestesses of one of the principal goddesses belonging to this worship, named Pattiny deviyo, are called Pattiny Hamies. These Pattiny Hamies are not always females, males very often assuming the office. Both Pattiny Hamies and Capuas hold nearly the same rank in the estimation of their countrymen, and lead the same sort of life, as the Cattadiyas already mentioned; but in earlier days they were considered to be superior to the Cattadiyas, and in the inland\ndistricts of the Island they still retain this superiority to some extent. The sacred character however assigned to the Priests of Buddha is wholly denied both to the Capuas and to the Cattadiyas.\n\nIII. Grahaism, as it exists here at the present day, owes its origin to Judicial Astrology. The Horoscope of a man is an essential thing for determining both the nature of the planetary influence, which troubles him at any particular time with disease or some other evil, and also the nature of the particular ceremony necessary to remedy the evil. The calculations of the Astrologer shew that a certain position or a certain movement of the planets, or their arrival at a certain point of their orbit, is fraught with some calamity or some advantage to a man. When the former happens to be the case, the planet god, who is the cause of the evil, is propitiated by certain ceremonies called Balli ceremonies. These, being of various kinds, will come to be treated of in detail in a subsequent chapter. These Balli ceremonies have become more generally diffused through the Island since the reign of Sree Prakrama Bahoo VI., who commenced his reign at Cottah in the year 1410, A.D. Before that time they were confined generally to the magnates of the land. When a king or a rich aristocrat fell sick, Brahmins and others skilled in the art were sent for from India, who sometimes also came of their own accord, and gave the benefit of their services only to those, who were able to pay them well; but Sreerahola Terunnanse, a Buddhist priest who lived during that reign, and who is reputed to have been the most learned man of his time in the Island, reduced Grahaism to its present condition, by teaching it to people of some of the low castes, and thereby rendering its benefits available to all classes of people. And so to this day, although every class of Singhalese engages in the worship, yet the office of priest or Ballicaareya or Balleadura is still held only by some of the low caste people, especially the Berawayos or Tomtom beaters.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nThe Demons or Yakseyo.\n\nThe Demons or Yakseyo* are a class of beings forming a large community, under a government conducted by a King, and subject to laws enacted by him for their control, any infringement of which is followed by severe punishment. Wessamony, this dreaded king, whose subjects throng every part of the sky, carries in his hand a sword of gold, of such wondrous power, that, when he is displeased with any of his subjects, it flies out of his hand of its own accord, and, after cutting off the heads of a thousand offenders with the rapidity of lightning, returns to his hand again. His laws are such as become the character of his subjects,\u2014cruel, severe, and merciless, death being the rule, and any lighter penalty the exception in the punishment of any crime\u2014burning, boiling, roasting, broiling, impaling, flaying alive, pouring melted metal down the\n\n* Sir Emerson Tennent in his Christianity in Ceylon distinguishes Yakseyos from Yakkas, and describes the former as a gentle and benevolent race of beings, and the latter as malignant spirits; whereas, the truth is that both the terms, the former being the Sanscrit, and the latter the Singhalese word, mean the same thing. There are several other names by which these beings are known such as Yakkha (Pali), and Yaksaya (a Singhalese form of the Sanscrit term). The benevolent and gentle character, attributed by Sir Emerson, is true only of a portion of those Yakseyo mentioned in the Pali Buddhistical Works. But the malignant Yakseyo, who cause disease and suffering among men, are those who are worshipped in Demonism. These latter are not mentioned in the Buddhistical works, and are the indigenous demons of Ceylon, being creations of the popular fancy, existing in the belief of the Singhalese from a period perhaps long anterior to the introduction of Buddhism into the Island.\n\nThe Rakseyo are a race of beings, who differ from men only in being cannibals. They live solely on human flesh, which they obtain, not from graveyards or other places where human carcasses may be had, but by actually seizing and killing living men. They have no supernatural powers whatever like the Yakseyo. This notion about Rakseyo supports the idea that in the earliest periods of time this Island must have been inhabited by a race of men, who breakfasted on their fellowmen, like the inhabitants of some of the Polynesian Islands.\nthroat, driving sharp nails into the crown of the head, and a variety of other punishments, numbering 32 in all, distinguish his penal code. He has viceroys, ministers, and other officers necessary for the proper administration of his government. Between His Majesty and the mass of his subjects, there is a series of chiefs in regular gradation to each other, each of whom within his own allotted sphere of action exercises almost an unlimited amount of power. He exacts from all his subjects a degree of servile obedience to his will, which not the most despotic of earthly sovereigns ever pretended to claim; and the mere mention of his name is sufficient to make any of his subjects tremble with fear. His subjects spend their time almost always in amusing diversions of various kinds. Many of them at one time were so little under his rule that they openly attacked men, and either devoured them alive bones and all, or sucked their blood. Every Saturday and Wednesday, all the respectable demons attend a sort of pandemonium called Yaka Sabawa, where each chieftain gives an account of the conduct of those under him to the principal chiefs; after which, they all engage in dancing, singing, playing on musical instruments, and in the display of exploits of skill and dexterity.\n\nDemons are of two classes, those approaching to the nature of gods, wise, powerful, and not merciless, living in the upper regions of the sky, in magnificent palaces decorated with gold, silver, and precious stones, enjoying an amount of happiness little inferior to that of the gods themselves, and sometimes called devatawas; and those, who with wild, savage, gross, beastly natures, pass their time near the surface of the earth, revelling in scenes of blood and misery, bringing disease and death on men, and receiving offerings of rice, meat, and blood, in return. The former class of demons are those mentioned in the Pali works, and do not belong to Demon-worship, but the latter, being those who are supposed to afflict men, are the objects of dread and of worship among the Singhalese.*\n\n* That none of the demons mentioned in the Buddhistical writings should be found to be objects of worship among the Singhalese, and that Demonism\nare supposed to be the most terrible and hideous looking creatures in existence. Their aliment is blood and flesh, especially of human beings, but this not being allowed them now by their king, they are obliged to content themselves with making men sick, and accepting the offerings made by the sick people, which in imagination they suppose to be the flesh and blood of men, but do not, or cannot, actually eat; the only use they make of such offerings being to look at them, and enjoy the pleasure the sight affords them. By what other means they support existence, whether they take any kind of food whatever, or live by some supernatural means without the use of any food, neither the Cattadiya nor his books enable us to say.\n\nThey are said to have, in general, skins of a black colour, and large protruding eyes and hanging lips, with long white teeth, of which those called the canine, in some demons, project out of the mouth, curved like a pair of sickles. They sometimes wear about their persons venomous serpents, especially Cobras. They are invisible to men, but have the power of making themselves visible, generally in some other shape, often in that of beasts, of men or of women. As the favorite food of the cat is said to be rats, and that of tigers\n\nrecognizes demons wholly unknown to Buddhistical literature, do in themselves constitute a strong piece of internal evidence in proof of the greater antiquity of Demonism over Buddhism in this Island. For, had the latter been the one earlier established here, the probability, amounting almost to a certainty, is that the demons recognized by Buddhism itself would have been the demons who would have become objects of worship.\n\nIf Buddha and Weassamony are mentioned in the invocations and charms of Demonism, as they often are, it only shews the natural result of two systems, which have continued to flourish together side by side for 2000 years and upwards, trying to adjust themselves to each other as much as possible: the more so when the believer in one system happens, as is the case here, to be also a believer in the other. Buddhism being considered to be the sacred religion, while Demonism is only a religion relating to one's temporal interests, it is natural that the influence of the former should to a certain extent be felt on the latter.\nblack cattle, so the favorite dish of a demon is said to be a living man. And because he is not allowed now to indulge himself in that luxury, he therefore takes pleasure in throwing his influence on men in a certain mysterious manner, which, it is said, is a source of enjoyment to him, as if he were actually engaged in sucking the blood out of some good looking man: it is also believed that this sort of enjoyment constitutes their only means of sustaining life, and that it is quite enough for the purpose. They are a sort of ubiquitous race, and yet have certain fixed residences in the north of the sky. They have the remarkable power of observing events which take place tens of thousands of miles remote from them, and can likewise travel millions of miles in a minute. The demons belonging to the first of these two classes are neither hideous as those of the second, nor do they eat men, nor even make men sick. In person they are like the gods themselves, with skins of golden hue. They use the ambrosial heavenly food used by the gods.\n\nThe second class of demons is subdivided into four minor divisions; viz., 1. Balli-caama demons, or those who have a particular attachment to balli offerings; 2. Billi-caama demons, or those fond of offerings of living beings; 3. Ratti-caama demons, or those who take delight in music, dancing, and other pleasures of that kind; 4. Hantu-caama demons, or those who delight in inflicting death. A disease brought on by a Hantu-caama demon is considered to be incurable by any means whatever; but those inflicted by the demons of the other three divisions terminate fatally, only when proper remedies are not applied, viz., those which Demonism affords.\n\nIn Narayena, the principal authority on the subject of the witchcraft, and to a certain extent of the demonology of India and the neighbouring countries, there appear the names of many demons, such as Asura Yakseya, Awara Yakseya, Heyma Yakseya, Peita Yakseya, Pralaapa Yakseya, Wayissrawana Yakseya, Kaksepa Yakseya, Nischella Yakseya, Gandarwa Yakseya, Naga Yakseya, and a great many others. But although Narayena is the received authority on the subject of charms among the Singhalese, yet none of these demons, mentioned in it as inflicting evils on men, are\nknown to the Demonism of the Island. This circumstance is only another proof of the Demon-worship of the Singhalese having had an origin independent both of Brahminism or Hinduism, and of Buddhism.\n\nAccording to Buddhism, neither Brahmas* nor Dewo nor Yakseyo are born from the womb of a mother, but suddenly spring into existence full grown. This sort of birth is called Oapapatika. Nevertheless the last two classes, viz., Dewo and Yakseyo may have mothers in a peculiar fashion. For instance, if a demon seem to spring into existence from the shoulder or arm of a female demon, the latter is considered to be his mother. Marrying and giving in marriage prevail among them as well as among men. This is the account which Buddhism gives: but that given by Demonism itself differs very widely from this. It represents demons as having human fathers and mothers, and as being born in the ordinary course of nature. This is said to have been the case with almost every demon; but though born of human parents, all their qualities are different from those of men. They leave their parents sometime after their birth, but before doing so they generally take care to try\n\n* Brahmas are the highest order of gods inhabiting the 16 highest heavens called Brahma loka, as the Dewo are the gods next below them in rank, inhabiting the 6 Dewa loka situated immediately below the former. Yakseyo are the demons. Brahmas are supposed seldom or never to interfere in the affairs of men, and are therefore never worshipped or invoked by the Singhalese; and even of the Dewo, the people worship only a few of the inferior classes, who do not even dwell in the 6 Dewa loka, but on the tops of large trees, and in the air above, not very far however from the earth, in magnificent palaces invisible to man. The Dewo of this latter class are called dewata generally, and are divided into Tallatoo and Boomatoo dewo. These are the dewo or gods that the people worship, as conferring benefits upon men or punishing them for their misdeeds. The more ignorant of the Singhalese Buddhists know no beings superior to these. These inferior gods are partly Hindoo deities, and partly deified heroes of the Singhalese.\n\nThe fact of Brahmas being mentioned by Buddha as the highest class of beings in existence, inferior only to himself, inhabiting 16 lokas or worlds, is an additional, though a collateral, proof of Brahminism being anterior to Buddhism.\ntheir demoniac powers on them. In the first place they must pay their court to Wissamonny, or to some powerful god, and obtain from him permission to exercise their demoniac powers. They then hover about in the air, and cease to touch the ground; for walking on the ground is strictly prohibited by Wissamonny and the gods; nevertheless, whenever a man says that he has seen the apparition of a demon, he always describes him as having appeared to him walking on the ground like a man.\n\nIt also appears in the various accounts given of the birth of demons, especially in the genealogical accounts recited or chanted at the commencement of demon ceremonies, that a demon has the power at any moment (a power which he often exercises) of entering the womb of a woman, where he remains during the necessary period, assuming in their order the various conditions of a foetus conceived in the ordinary way. After the woman's delivery, the child (that is the demon) resumes the exercise of his demon peculiarities, as before. Some demons appear to have been born hundreds of times in this fashion.\n\nIf we can believe that there is any particle of truth at all in the existence and in the genealogies of these demons, that little, we think, must be this\u2014that in the very remotest periods, when the Singhalese were peculiarly ignorant and superstitious, and when the principle of Hero-worship was carried to a height proportioned only to the ignorance of the worshipper, there may have lived particular members of the community, who distinguished themselves by extreme ferocity and cruelty of conduct, joined to considerable power, which they exercised either as kings, chiefs, or mere lawless free-booters; and that these individuals after death, and perhaps when living, were worshipped as supernatural beings possessed of irresistible powers of injuring men. We are the more confirmed in this opinion by the fact, that the dewo or gods belonging to Capnism appear to have been no more than creatures of this kind. The mythology and the apotheosis of the Greeks, of the Romans and of most other early nations of the world were, in a manner, only counterparts of this.\nThere is another class of demons who come into existence by Oapapatika birth. These are called Malla Yakseyo, or the spirits of deceased men. If a man, who lives at enmity with another, remember, on his deathbed, just before he dies, and at the very moment of his expiring, anything relating to that enmity, and if, instead of a feeling of forgiveness, resentment and hatred take possession of his mind, he is supposed to become, after death, a demon of this kind. These demons are not so powerful, as those mentioned above, nevertheless they too cause sickness.\n\nThere are two places distinguished as the birthplaces of many of the demons. These are Wisala Maha Newera (Ujayin), and Sanka paala Newera. These cities are said to have, on very many occasions, been laid desolate by demons, either by inflicting disease upon the citizens or by devouring them alive.\n\nTo shew the reader that the notion of the possibility of a human mother giving birth to a demon even in these days, is not at all uncommon among the people, we have only to mention an incident which is still fresh in our recollection. A poor woman of our native village gave birth to a child about 23 or 24 years ago; the infant, which was a male, had all its teeth as well developed, as a child of 5 or 6 years of age. Its head too was covered with hair about an inch long, its face was unusually long, and its mouth broader than usual in children of that age. The appearance of the child was not at all prepossessing, and all thought that it was a demon. An hour or two after its birth the grandfather dashed out its brains with a stick. To this day, the people believe that it was actually a demon and not a human being, and this belief will, we are sure, continue for centuries more. On our mentioning this circumstance some years ago, to an English gentleman now high in the Civil Service of this Island, he gave information of it to Government, who in consequence instructed the local magistrate to make an investigation into the matter. But those of the villagers, who were well acquainted with the particulars of the case, considering it more prudent to hold their tongues, than to give information in a matter, in which they were not personally interested, denied all knowledge of it.\nAnother child was also sacrificed to this same superstition about 25 years ago in a village near Barberyn. In this case, the child was nailed to the stem of a cocoanut tree and so left to die, the best punishment, as was thought, for a demon, who had had the impudence to be born of a human mother. We have also heard of a still more recent case, which occurred some 5 or 6 years ago in the same neighbourhood, but we are not acquainted with any of the particulars connected with it. We have likewise heard of 10 or 12 other cases of this kind, which have occurred within the last 25 years in other parts of the Island, in which ignorance and superstition triumphed both over parental affection and over common sense.\n\nThe demons can never inflict disease or receive offerings, unless they have a sort of general permission called Wurrun, previously granted to them by Wissamonny, or by some of his principal chiefs, or by some of the gods. And as they cannot honestly sustain life without afflicting men, and thereby extorting offerings, they are necessarily obliged to seek and obtain this Wurrun, as soon as they enter on life. Inferior and insignificant demons however live on without such a patent, by violating the law, and their sufferings and punishments are therefore very great. The principal offenders of this kind are the demons called Malla Yakseyo.\n\nLike men, demons also seem to have their own fashionable hours of breakfasting, dining, and supping. Sanny Yakseya will accept his offerings only in the morning between 2 and 6 o'clock; Reeri Yakseya, Calloo Yakseya, Abimaana Yakseya, and Totte Yakseya, will accept theirs only in the evening, between 6 and 10 o'clock; while Maha Sohon Yakseya, Hooniyan Yakseya, Uda Yakseya, the female demons Riddhi Yaksaniya and Madana Yakseniya will accept offerings at no other hours than those intervening between 10 p.m., and 2 a.m.\n\nAlthough it is believed that there are millions and billions of demons in existence, yet the number of those who belong to the demon worship does not exceed 50 or 60, and even of these Reeri Yakseya, Calloo Yakseya, Sanny Yakseya, Maha Sohon Yakseya, Calloo Cumare dewatawa, and Hooniyan Yakseya, are the principal individuals, who figure in every demon ceremony in the Island.\nI. Reeri Yakseya or Reeri Yakka* (demon of blood) is considered to be the most cruel and powerful of all these. He is represented as having the face of a monkey, and the rest of his body like that of a man. The colour of his skin is a fiery red. He uses a red bull to ride on. There is scarcely a single disease, to which a Singhalese man is liable, in which this demon is not supposed to exert an influence. Diseases, which produce a flux of blood from the system, are supposed to be especially inflicted by him. When a man is about to die, this demon is supposed to be present by means of an avatar\u2020 or apparition called Maru Avatar, or apparition of death. On such an occasion he is supposed to assume the dimensions of a pigmy, measuring one span and six inches in height, and carrying in one hand a cock, in the other a club, and in his mouth the corpse of a man; he is supposed to be present at the death bed, or not far off, till the man dies. Every demon, as well as Reeri Yakseya, has several forms of these apparitions or disguises, which he assumes on different occasions according to circumstances, and in each of which he is called by a different name. There is however another opinion entertained by some of the Cattadiyas, that these apparitions are not different disguises of the same demon, but that they are separate individual demons, forming however a sort of confederacy, and all acting together in concert. The former, we think, is the more popular opinion of the two. Nevertheless, in the case of one demon, viz., Sanni Yakseya, these apparitions are sup-\n\n* Yakseya and Yakka are synonymous terms, of which the latter however is the one which is more commonly used.\n\n\u2020 Avatar is a Sanscrit term signifying the incarnation of any being or spirit in some particular shape. Among the Hindoos an avatar of being, such, for instance, as that of Vishnoo, is some condition of existence, such as that of a cow, a man, a serpent or some other, which Vishnoo chooses to assume or to be born in. An avatar of a demon, as understood amongst the Singhalese, means some disguise which a demon assumes for a few moments or so. It is also supposed that the demon himself is not bodily present at any place where such an avatar is seen, but that he is millions of miles distant from the scene, and yet has the power of creating these avatars and of presenting them to the eyes of men.\nposed to be not his own disguised self, but separate individual demons, who act under him and in obedience to his orders. Reeri Yakseya has 18 of these apparitions, or avatars as they are called by the people. In the 1st he is called Reeri Yakseya; in the 2nd Ree Raj-ja; 3rd Agu Raj-ja; 4th Pulutajja; 5th Reeri Gopolla; 6th Reeri Buddia; 7th Reeri Watukaya; 8th Reeri Billey Dewatawa; 9th Reeri Kavisia; 10th Reeri Sanniya; 11th Reeri Curumberaya; 12th Reeri Madana Yakseya; 13th Lay Avatar Yakseya; 14th Lay Caama Yakseya; 15th Serra Marulu Dewatawa; 16th Maru Reeri Yakseya; 17th Maru Caama Yakseya; and in the 18th Maru Avatar Yakseya. Reeri Yakseya is represented to have had above a hundred different incarnations; in one of which he was the son of a king of Sanka pala Nuwera; in another, of a king of Lagal pura; in a third, of a she-demon named Ginimuru Yaksani of a country called Hanumanta Desay; but his disposition and conduct were the same in all.\n\nII. MAHA SOHON YAKSEYA, or MAHA SOHONA means the Great Graveyard Demon. He is so named because he chiefly frequents graveyards. He is also supposed to haunt the summits of large rocks and hills, where he delights to surround himself with human carcasses, and to swallow huge morsels of the delicious repast, preferring the entrails above all other parts. He is 81 cubits (122 feet) high; has three eyes, four hands, and a skin of a red colour. His origin is thus given\u2014\"In ancient times, there were giants in this Island, men who could defeat even half a dozen elephants in single combat by their mere physical strength. One of these giants, by name Jaya Sena, was very fond of displaying his extraordinary strength, even at times when there was no occasion for it, and happening on one occasion to pick a quarrel with Gota Imbra, another great giant, the latter with one blow knocked off his head. Precisely at that moment the planet god Senasura, who was a spectator of the scene, seized a bear, and tearing off its head from its body, applied it to the headless trunk of Jaya Sena, to which through his supernatural power it adhered, and became a part of the body. So the deceased Jaya Sena instantly rose up alive as a demon, and has\nsince been known as *Maha Sohona* in reference to his habits of haunting graveyards.\" In those demon ceremonies, which are performed to obtain the release of a sick man from the influence of Maha Sohona, a certain spell or charm called *Gota Imbra D\u00e6hanay* is made use of by the Cattadiya. In this charm the particulars of this event are narrated at length, and the demon is threatened with further vengeance from his late conqueror, if he does not afford immediate relief to the sufferer. Maha Sohona is the chief of 30,000 demons. He also shews himself to men in various disguises or apparitions when he moves about, and on each occasion rides on a particular animal. In one of these apparitions he rides on a goat, and is called *Lay Sohona* or *Blood Demon of the graveyard*; in another he rides on a deer, and is named *Amu Sohona* or the *graveyard Demon of fresh corpses*; in a third he rides on a horse, and is called *Jaya Sohona*, or the *Victorious demon of the graveyard*; in a fourth he rides on a sheep, and is called *Maru Sohona* or the *graveyard demon of death*; in a fifth he rides on an elephant, and is called *Golu Sohona* or the *Dumb demon of the graveyard*; In his own proper person as *Maha Sohona* he rides on a gigantic hog.\n\n---\n\nThe *graveyards* of ancient times in Southern Asia, and especially in Ceylon, were not what we commonly understand by that term now. Excepting the Buddhist priests and the aristocrats of the land, whose bodies were burnt in regular funeral piles after death, the corpses of the rest of the people were neither burned nor buried, but thrown into a place called *Sohona*, which was an open piece of ground in the jungle, generally a hollow among the hills, at the distance of 3 or 4 miles from any inhabited place, where the corpses were left in the open air to be decomposed, or devoured by dogs and wild beasts. This practice appears to have prevailed in the Island to a comparatively recent period, and in the most secluded and least civilized of the inland districts till about the beginning of this century. Although regular cemeteries are mentioned in the *Maha Wanso* in connection with Anuradhapura, especially during the reign of the Wijayan dynasty, they do not appear to have been very general either at that time or at any subsequent period. Maha Sohona and other demons not having now these (*Sohon*) congenial places for demoniac conviviality, are obliged to be content with the ordinary graves and graveyards of these days.\nIII. **Maha Cola Sanni Yakseya**, or the *Great Demon of the fatal diseases*, according to one account, sprang into existence from the ashes of the funeral pile of *Asoopala Cumari*, a princess of the city *Wisala Maha Nuwera.* Another account makes him the son of a king of a city, called *Sanka pala Nuwera.* \"This king,\" says the account, during the pregnancy of his queen, made an incursion into the country in search of some article of *Dolladuk* for her, and, on returning to his palace a few days afterwards, one of the queen's servants, who was unfriendly to her,\n\n---\n\n*Wisala,* says Professor Wilson, \"is a city of considerable renown in Indian tradition, but its site is a subject of some uncertainty. Part of the difficulty arises from confounding it with Visala, another name of Ujain. According to the Buddhists, it is the same as Prayaga or Allahabad; but the Ramayana places it much lower down, on the north Bank of the Ganges, nearly opposite to the mouth of the Sone; and it was therefore in the modern district of Saran, as Hamilton (Genealogy of the Hindus) conjectured.\"\u2014Wilson's *Vishnu Purana.*\n\nFa Hian visited Wisala, but does not give any extended description of what he saw. Hiun Thsang is more particular, and says that it had fallen into ruin, but that the circumference of the ancient foundations was upwards of twenty miles. He saw the ruins of more than a hundred monasteries. The country was rich, the soil fertile, the climate agreeable, and the inhabitants were bland in their manners, and contended with their lot. There were a few monasteries still standing, but the inmates were little better than heretics.\"\u2014Hardy's *Manual of Buddhism.*\n\nThere is scarcely any other place more frequently alluded to in the demonology of Ceylon, than this city, which in Singhalese is generally known under the name of *Wisala Maha Nuware* which means the \"great extensive city.\"\n\n\u2020 Sometimes also, called *Sakaspura*, and in Pali *Sankassa*. \"A letter from Lieutenant Cunningham, R. E., to Colonel Sykes, was read before the Royal Asiatic Society, December 3, 1842, giving an account of the discovery and identification of the city of Sankasya mentioned as the kingdom of Kusadwaga in the Ramayana. It is twenty-five miles from Farrkhabad, and fifty from Kanouj on the north or left bank of the Kali Nadi. The ruins are very extensive, and there can be no doubt that they are of Buddhistic origin\"\u2014Hardy's *Manual of Buddhism.*\n\n\u2020 *Dolladuk* is a strong desire which a woman during the earlier months of her pregnancy has for something, generally some article of food. This desire\nwishing to ruin her, told the king that she was unfaithful to his bed. On this, the injured king ordered her to be put to death. Her body was to be cut into two pieces, of which one was to be hung upon an Ukberiya tree, and the other to be thrown at its foot to be devoured by dogs. When the queen heard of this, she was enraged beyond measure, because she knew that she was wholly innocent. So she said, 'if this charge be false, may the child in my womb be born this instant a demon, and may that demon destroy the whole of this city with its unjust king.' No sooner had the king's executioners done as they were ordered, than the half of the corpse, which was suspended on the tree, falling down on the ground, united itself to the other half which was at the foot of the tree; and the same instant the corpse gave birth to a demon, who first sucked his mother's breasts, then sucked her blood, and lastly devoured her flesh and bones. He then went to the Sohon graveyards in the vicinity, and there lived upon the carcasses. Afterwards repairing to the city and inflicting a mortal disease on the king, he began with several other demons, who now formed his retinue, to devour the citizens, and in a short time nearly depopulated the city. The gods Iswara and Sekkra, seeing the ferocity of this new demon, came down to the city, disguised as mendicants, and after some little resistance on the part of the demon, they subdued him; on which occasion they ordered him to abstain from eating men, but gave him Wurrun or permission to inflict disease on mankind, and to obtain offerings from them. According to some\n\nis often an irresistible one. Sometimes it happens to be a very unreasonable one too. We know a woman still living, who, when in this interesting condition about 15 or 20 years ago, expressed a strong wish to eat the head of a little child, and her husband was able to moderate her cannibal propensity, only by substituting the heads of fishes and other animals for that of a child. The husband and all her relatives and neighbours suspected that such a desire could not but be a prelude to the birth of a demon, and accordingly awaited the event with much anxiety and curiosity. Happily, however, the child did not happen to have long teeth or long hair, and so had the good fortune to escape the fate which it would have otherwise met with.\naccounts this demon has 4,448, and according to others 484,000 subject demons under him. He generally rides on a lion, and has 18 principal attendants, the first of whom is called Bhoota Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of madness; 2nd Maru Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of death; 3rd Jala Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of cholera; 4th Wewulun Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of cold and trembling fits; 5th Naga Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of a disease resembling that from the sting of a Cobra de Capello; 6th Gana Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of blindness; 7th Corra Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of lameness; 8th Golla Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of dumbness; 9th Bihiri Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of deafness; 10th Wata Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of diseases caused by the wind; 11th Pit Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of bilious diseases; 12th Sen Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of diseases influenced by the phlegm;* 13th Demala Sanni Yakseya, or the Tamil demon of diseases; 14th Murtu Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of fainting fits and swoons; 15th Arda Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of Apoplexy; 16th Wedi Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of a disease which kills one instantly like a shot from a gun; 17th Dewa Sanni Yakseya, or the demon of diseases influenced by the gods; and 18th Aturu Sanni Yakseya, or the servant of Maha Cola Sanni Yakseya (the chief of all the 18.) These 18 demons are not considered to be mere apparitions of the same demon, as in the case of the other Yaksoyo, but separate individual demons acting together in concert with their chief Maha Cola Sanni Yakseya.\n\nIV. Oddy Cumara Hooniyan Dewatawa\u2020 is the son of Susiri, queen of Sagalpura in Maduratta. He always rides on\n\n---\n\n* Wind, phlegm and bile are considered by the Singhalese physicians to be the proximate causes of every sickness, to which man is liable: and in the treatment of any disease, one or more of these three agents have to be influenced.\n\n\u2020 Though dewatawa is a term, which is generally applied to the inferior classes of gods, and to the superior classes of demons, that do not inflict disease on men, yet it is also sometimes applied by Cattadiyas, as in the text, to inferior or malignant demons.\na horse. He has six different apparitions; in the first he is called Calu Oddisey, or demon of incurable diseases; in the second Naga Oddisey, or demon of serpents; in the third Cumara Oddisey, or demon prince; in the fourth Demala Oddisey, or Tamil demon; in the fifth Gopolu Oddisey, or demon of Cattle; and in the sixth Raja Oddisey, or Royal demon. He is the principal demon that has much to do in that department of sorcery called Hooniyan.*\n\nV. Calu Yakseya, or the Black Demon, is so named on account of the extremely black colour of his skin. He appears in four different apparitions; in the first he is called Calu Curumbera, or the blackest one; in the second, Rata Galu Yakseya, or the foreign black demon; in the third, Dewol Bagey Calu Yakseya, or the Black demon of the Dewol gods; and in the fourth Siddhi Calu Yakseya, or the Illustrious black demon. He was generated from the ashes of the burnt corpse of Basma, an Asura.\u2020 Another account makes him a son of king Wijeyo by Cuveni. A third account says that he is the spirit of a famous giant named Neela Maha Yodaya, who formed one of the bodyguard of king Gaja Bahu (113 A.D.) He once accompanied the king on a visit to a country called Istreepura, which was inhabited only by females (a race of Amazons), all of whom on seeing him fell in love with him. Hundreds of them seizing him at once, each claiming him as her own, and pulling him this way and that way, he was torn to pieces in their grasp. His spirit having assumed the form of a\n\n* It is not now easy to identify the Sagalpura mentioned in the text. Many believe it to be the Sagal of King Milinda, who is celebrated for his controversies with Nagesena; but this opinion is hardly tenable, when we consider that the capital of Milinda must have been somewhere in or near Cashmere, and that Messrs. Wilson, Bird, and Masson, consider it to have been situated between the rivers Ravi and Pipasa in the Punjab; while the Sagal of the text is expressly mentioned as being in Maduratta, which is on the opposite side of India.\n\n\u2020 Asuras are a race of beings of enormous size, supposed to reside under the mythical rock Maha Meru. They are the Titans of Singhalese mythology.\nDemon is now always trying to avenge his wrongs on the whole female sex. Women and little children are therefore supposed to suffer from his malign influence.\n\n6. **Calu Cumara Dewatawa** or the *Black Prince* is the son of king Boksella and his queen Sonalu. He shews himself to men in seven different apparitions; in the 1st he is called *Handung Cumara*, or *Prince of sandal perfumes*;* in the 2nd *Andung Cumara*, or *Prince of Eye Ointments*;\u2020 in the 3rd *Mal Cumara*, or *Prince of flowers*; in the 4th *Gini Cumara*, or *Prince of fire*; in the 5th *Dala Cumara*, or the *Rough Prince*; in the 6th *Sohon Cumara*, or *Prince of graves*; and in the 7th *Wata Cumara*, or\n\n---\n\n* There is scarcely a single offering made to any demon in which Sandal wood does not form a constituent part: and Demon worship, be it remembered, is a system, which seems to have prevailed here from times anterior to those of Wijeyo himself. This circumstance, taken together with the fact, that the Chinese writers actually mention Sandal wood as forming in early times an article of export from this Island, seems to favor the idea, that the article must have been growing in the Island in considerable quantities in early times, though at present specimens are to be met with only in a few spots, and those preserved rather as objects of curiosity and ornament than for use.\n\n\u2020 The *soot*, which is produced on a piece of porcelain when held to the lighted wick of a lamp, is scraped up and mixed with a little cocoanut oil, when it acquires the name *andung* or *Eye Ointment*, so called because it is rubbed on the outside of the eyelids of very young infants by Singhalese mothers, who believe it to be productive of some benefit to the eyes. Can it be that this benefit is the protecting of the tender eyes of the young infant from being dazzled by too much light, that the black pigment is laid all round the cornea of the eye in order that it may imbibe all the straggling rays of light which, falling on the parts nearest to the cornea, by reflection, tend to injure the tender retina by an overabundance of light? If this be the case, it will warrant the supposition, that the Singhalese were practically acquainted with the Theory of Light, tens of centuries before Newton was born. The practice is one of the most ancient among the Singhalese.\n\nThis *Eye Ointment* also forms an important item in the offerings made to demons in many demon ceremonies: but for what use it is intended to serve a demon it is difficult to guess. In a certain ceremony performed to propitiate the demon *Calu Cumara dewatawa*, the Cattadiya, who performs the ceremony, paints his eyelids with this Ointment.\nPrince of a smooth body. He is always tormented by the passion of love, and when his evil influence falls upon females, it is supposed to make them ill. Young and fair women are particularly exposed to his attacks. Another account says that he was the son of a king, and that afterwards on taking orders as a Buddhist priest his piety and sanctity of life became so great, that, besides other superhuman powers, he acquired that of flying through the air like a bird, but that on a certain occasion, while so moving in the air, seeing the beautiful daughter of a certain king of India, he was so much struck with her beauty, that he fell in love, and losing at the same time all his supernatural powers dropped down on the very spot, where the object of his passion was standing at the time. His passion was so intense, that it broke his heart, and he died on the spot, and became a demon, since called Calu Cuma Dewatawa. He is considered to be a demon of great respectability, more civilized and less savage than the rest of his fraternity. Great care is therefore taken in the preparation of his offerings. Rice of the best quality and cooked in the best manner, the best kinds of plantains, sugar canes, oranges, king-cocoanuts, sugar, and several varieties of cakes, constitute the principal articles in the offerings made to him. His person is of a dark blue colour, and his garments of a deep black.\n\nVII. Ahimana Yakseya was born of an Aandy* woman. His father was a king of Gururatta in Casee-dayse. He is known under three other names, Ollala Yakseya, Malala Yakseya, and Cotta Yakseya or short demon, so called in reference to the short stumps of his legs, which were cut off in a battle fought with king Wijeyo.\n\nVIII. Tota Yakseya, son of king Malala and his queen Sandagana of the city of Sandagana Nuvera, passes most of his time at the ferries and fords of rivers; and it is at these places that he casts his influence on men.\n\n* Aandy is the name of a class of Moormen, whose sole pursuits are begging and fortune-telling. They are the Gypsies of Ceylon. Their language, religion, and dress are the same as those of the Moormen, but still it is open to doubt whether they are of the same race.\nIX. **Bahirawa Yakseya** is another demon as much attached to the female sex as *Galu Cumara dewatawa* himself, but there is this difference between them:\u2014while the latter brings only slight diseases on the objects of his attachment, the former inflicts those that result in speedy death. The hill called *Bahirawa Canda*, which stands towering like a giant over one side of the town of Kandy, was till very lately supposed to be the abode of this demon. In early days it was regarded with feelings of dread. One of the former kings of Kandy, seeing that he was not likely to have any issue to perpetuate his line on the thorne, his queen miscarrying within a few months of her confinement whenever she was pregnant, assembled all the astrologers, soothsayers, cattadiyas, and other men of similar crafts, to his palace, and on consulting them as to the cause of his misfortune, was told, that the queen was under the influence of the demon Bahirawa Yakseya, who would never remove his influence from her, unless a yearly sacrifice of a young virgin was made to him on the summit of Bahirawa Canda. The king did as he was directed, and it is said that, after that, he had several children born to him. But when his queen grew old and past the time of child-bearing, he discontinued the offering as unnecessary, on which, it is said, the displeased demon began to inflict diseases on the royal family and on all the citizens, in so much that within two months the city was nearly depopulated. By the advice of his ministers and the Cattadiyas, the king resumed the former practice of making the annual sacrifice, to which all his successors, till the very last, faithfully adhered. The sacrifice was performed at night in the following manner:\u2014A stake being driven into the ground on the summit of the hill, the girl was tied to it with jungle creepers; flowers and boiled rice were placed close by on an altar constructed for the purpose; certain invocations and incantations were then pronounced, which completed the ceremony. The next morning the girl was found dead; and no wonder, for it would be a miracle, if a Singhalese, especially a young female destined to propitiate a demon, left alone for a night on the top of a hill supposed to be haunted, and tied to a stake, with the sound\nof the terrible charms still ringing in her ears, did not die through fright within an hour. There is, however, an old woman still living in Kandy, who was so offered up to the demon, in the time of the last king, Sree Wickrama Raja Singha, but who somehow or other managed to effect her escape. Besides this annual offering, there were others of a less important character, made 3 or 4 times every year to the demon on the same hill. There are seven other demons also known by the same name Bahirawa, but all the eight form a sort of company. When at Kandy on Circuit with the Supreme Court, I twice ascended the hill, and stood on its summit on the very spot, on which I thought the fatal stake must have been fixed. The summit is a small level area, not more than 20 or 25 feet square. Although the demon is said to have left the mountain soon after the British took possession of Kandy in 1815, yet even now few Singhalese have the hardihood to go to its summit alone at night, especially on a Saturday or a Wednesday night.\n\nX. Madana Yakseniyo, or Female demons of Lust, is the common name of seven sisters, namely Cama Madana, or demon of Lust; 2 Gini Madana, or demon of fire; 3 Mohanee Madana, or demon of ignorance; 4 Ratti Madana, or demon of pleasure; 5 Cala Madana, or demon of maturity; 6 Mal Madana, or demon of flowers; and 7 Puspa Madana, or demon of Perfumes. These demons, when worked upon by certain charms, and propitiated with certain offerings and ceremonies, are supposed to use their power of seducing the affections of a man or a woman in such a manner, that the person so influenced is said to find the power perfectly irresistible. There are hundreds of ways, in which it is pretended that this can be done; among others, by touching the person of a female with the young leaf of a king cocoanut tree, previously subjected to the incantations and other ceremonies peculiar to the mysteries of the art; by the man rubbing on his face a charmed medicine and then shewing himself to her; by mixing some love potion, similarly charmed, with her food; by making her chew charmed beetle leaves; by carrying on his person a charmed thread previously taken from a cloth she had worn; or by any of\na hundred other ways, in all of which the Madana Yakseniyo become useful agents in the hands of the magician. But the most efficacious and unfailing of all these methods is considered to be a certain oil called Madana Tayiley, a single drop of which, sprinkled on the person of a female, is supposed to act irresistibly on her; but the preparation of the wonderful oil is said to be fraught with so much danger to those engaged in it, that few or none dare to attempt it, and those who do, seldom or never succeed, as the demons are supposed to do their best to disappoint the men by frightening and scaring them away from the scene of their operations, which is said to result in the incurable insanity and eventual or immediate death of the operators.\n\nA short time ago we found the inhabitants of our native village in a high state of excitement, owing to the freaks that a mad man was playing in the neighbourhood. It was said that he had become a maniac by attempting to make the oil Madana Tayiley; that he had, for the last few days, been living in the woods eating serpents, frogs, and other loathsome creatures; that he stirred out in the darkness of the night with no other clothing on his person than a few green Gurulla leaves* tied round his waist; that he carried in his hands a man's skull and a bone, and on his shoulders a pot of human blood, which he used to slake his thirst; and that his favorite sleeping places were graves. For three or four days together nothing else was talked of in the village. By and bye the real truth eeked out from other sources, but not from the villagers themselves. It appeared that a mad man, a native of Salpitty Corlo, breaking loose from his keepers, had wandered about from village to village, and that during these wanderings he happened one night to pass through the villages we have alluded to above, accompanied\n\n---\n\n* Gurulla or Burulla is a kind of plant, between which and the demons there seems to be some mysterious connection. It is used in the construction and decoration of the altars and other structures, which are made in many of the Demon ceremonies. The Cattadiya sometimes adorns his head and his waist with its leaves in certain ceremonies.\nby a relative, who had come to take him home, and that this relative was the first to tell one of the villagers of the cause of the madness. By the next morning the report had spread through the village like wildfire, magnified and ornamented with the additions we have given above. The villagers themselves were, however, loth to believe the truth, when we told it to them, denuded of the additions they had made to it. The relative of the madman told us, a few days afterwards, the cause of the madman's misfortune; he described to us, how the man had endeavoured to make Madana Tayiley, about a year ago, and had been frightened by demons just at the moment of the oil becoming perfected, and how he, in consequence, had become a maniac. Although Madana Yak-seniyo and their wonderful oil are matters, about which we and this relative of the madman essentially differ in opinion from each other, yet, as to the mere fact of the man having become mad on such an occasion, we do not differ at all; for considering the extent of superstitious fear, which is ever present in the mind of an ignorant Singhalese, and especially on such an occasion, as that of preparing the oil of the demons, in the dead of night, on a lonesome grave, in a lonely part of the village, and his belief in the presence, at the scene of his operations, of cruel and powerful demons, whom he himself has but just invoked, and that these demons are ready at any unguarded moment, during the process of making the oil, to pounce upon him and destroy him and his oil\u2014when we consider these things, it is not at all improbable that a Singhalese, through mere excess of fright and an overexcited imagination, should lose his reason and become a maniac.\n\nXI. Morottoo Yaka, or Demon of Morottoo, or Rata Yaka or Foreign demon, is so named from his being a foreigner who landed at Morottoo, when he first came over into this country from the Malabar Coast. Soon after his landing, he fixed his residence on the top of a large tree in the neighbourhood of Morottoo, and whilst living there he brought so much sickness upon men, and especially upon children and women in a state of pregnancy, that the whole district was said to have been filled with mourning during\nevery part of the year. For a long time he continued to exercise his malignant power, till on one occasion he brought sickness on the queen of Sree Prakkrama Bahu VI., king of Cottah, which was then called Jayawardanapura (1410 A.D.) When the king found, that the medicines of the most skilful physicians of his Gabadawa, or Royal College of Physicians, were of no avail, he consulted the most learned men of his kingdom as to the cause of the Queen's illness, and learned from them that it was caused by Morottoo Yaka. Only one Cattadiya however in all his kingdom knew the ceremony, by which the demon could be appeased. That ceremony called Rata Yakum Neteema, or Morottoo Yakum Neteema, was accordingly performed, and the royal lady was restored to health.\n\nXII. Gopolu Yakseya, or the Demon of cattle, was the son of a king or chief of a district on the Coromandel Coast. He was the twinbrother of Mangara Dewiyo (a demigod;) their mother having died soon after their birth, a cow-buffalo suckled them: but Gopolu having on one occasion sucked all the milk without leaving any for his brother, a quarrel ensued, in which Gopolu was killed, but being born again, as the nature of demons is, he came over to Ceylon, and landed at Arangodde near Katragamma. At Arangodde he lived on a Banyan tree in which there was a large beehive, and scattered disease and death among all who came near the tree. His old enemy Mangara dewiyo and Pattini dewiyo (goddess of chastity) came afterwards to Ceylon, and, happening to land at the same place, saw a number of men lying under the tree, some dead and others dying. Knowing the cause, they immediately ordered the neighbouring villagers to bring a cow-buffalo, which they ordered to be offered up in sacrifice to Gopolu, on which the dying men recovered and returned to their houses. He is called the demon of cattle, because all cattle sickness is supposed to proceed from him. He is also considered to be the cause of hydrophobia.\n\nXIII. Anjenam Dewi is a female demon, by whose aid a certain art of divination called here Anjenam beleema, and elsewhere, as in Egypt, divining by the Magic Mirror, is performed. She is the chief of 700 other female demons.\nXIV. **Baddragali**, is a female demon, whose assistance is sought for winning lawsuits, and for subduing enemies and rivals of any kind.\n\nXV. **Riddhi Yakseniyo** are seven female demons, who also bring disease on men, like any other demons.\n\nXVI. **Uda Yakseyo**. There are many demons of this name. They are as cruel, as any of the preceding.\n\nXVII. **Curumbera Yakseyo**. Of this name also there are several, all equally prodigal of their powers of inflicting sickness.\n\nXVIII. **Hanuma** is another powerful demon of great cruelty. These are the principal demons, who figure in Demon Ceremonies, either as having caused disease, or as the effective agents in curing it. But there are also a very large number of demons of inferior power, collectively called **Mala Yakseyo**, who also inflict diseases of a less malignant character. These demons, as mentioned in a preceding page, are, as their name implies, the spirits of deceased men, born as demons in consequence of some demerit of theirs when living as men, or of some feeling of animosity or hatred, which was uppermost in their thoughts at the moment of death.\n\nIn addition to both these classes of demons, there is a third, which includes a few demons of a different kind. These are **Gara Yaka**, **Dewalla Yakseya**, Bodrima, and the Pretayo.\n\nXIX. **Gara Yaka** has no evil disposition, like those already described. He does no harm whatever to men, but on the contrary assists them in expelling all sorts of evil influence, to which new houses are supposed to be subject. Hence, when a house has been built, before or soon after its occupation, a ceremony called **Gara Yaka Maduwa** is generally performed, without which it is supposed that some misfortune will fall upon the inmates. Gara Yakseya is represented to be an individual of a voracious appetite and a capacious stomach. On one occasion **Pattini Dewiyo**, the goddess\n\n---\n\n*Yaka and Yakseya are synonymous terms, both equally used by the Sinhalese. The first is derived from the Pali Yakkho, and the second from the Sanscrit Yaksha.*\nof chastity, having to accompany the wedding procession of Canda Cumara (the god of Katragam), but not wishing to do so, because the house, together with all the furniture prepared for the reception of the guests, was wholly constructed of the bones and skins of animals (the adopted father of the bride happening to be a Weddah), she ordered Gara Yakeya to go there in time, and see what he could do before her arrival. Accordingly he went to the house in the character of Gamana,* and not seeing any better way of clearing the house of its disagreeable furniture, at once fell to devouring every thing, and in a short time the whole building with all its furniture was deposited in his stomach; to show his host, that he did this merely to satisfy his hunger, and not for any other purpose, he, even after this feat of gastronomic power, said that he was still very hungry. Before he commenced to eat the house, he had also eaten all the food, that had been prepared for the whole wedding party. Lastly, to satisfy his thirst, he drank some thousands of young Cocoanuts, and then drank up all the wells in the neighbourhood: and after all this, he left the house in great displeasure, saying to his host, as he was leaving him, \"you, fellow, have starved me; a nice way indeed of treating the Gamana of a son-in-law. Oh dear, I am dying of hunger and thirst.\"\n\nXX. Gewala Yakeya, or House demon, lives in the dwellings of men. These demons are innumerable. They are the spirits of those, who lived and died in the houses they now haunt, and who on their deathbed had thought much more of the money or other valuables they had hoarded up in the house,\u2020 than of their souls.\n\n* About an hour or so before a bridegroom accompanied by his friends arrives at the house of the bride, a person, named for the occasion Gamana or messenger, is sent forward with a number of betel leaves equal to the number of people, who accompany the bridegroom. The Gamana is to give these betel leaves to the bride's friends, together with the large pinga of plantains called Gira-mul-tada, which in the Maritime districts is always a sine qua non of the presents, which a Singhalese bridegroom carries to his bride's house.\n\n\u2020 The Singhalese, especially the poorer classes, generally secrete their money in holes dug in the floor, or in the walls of their houses. In a case of burglary which was tried at Kandy before the Supreme Court about a year ago, it was\nThey are fond of throwing into confusion the cooking utensils and crockery, and of continually opening and shutting the boxes in the house, if the inmates do not take care to secrete the keys, unobserved by the spirits. The jingling of coin, the sound of strange footsteps, and the creaking of door-hinges are frequently heard. The demon does not like to see the inmates eat and drink and enjoy themselves. When these latter sit together at their meals, he gets so annoyed by the sight, that he seizes them by the hair and knocks their heads against each other. He is of course invisible to men, like all other demons, but is possessed of no power to inflict disease.* He belongs to the class called Mala Yakseyo.\n\nXXI. Bodrima is a female demon, at first originating no doubt in the nursery, but at present believed to be a real existence. She is the ghost of a woman, who has died in childbirth. She is said to be heard at night, wailing and groaning in a peculiar manner; and if she sees a man passing by, she immediately springs on his back, and, fixing her fingers and long nails in his throat, tries to choke him to death. She however is afraid of women, and especially of a woman with a house-broom in her hand. When she is supposed to be heard at night groaning in her peculiar way, and approaching a house, the male portion of the inmates take care to remain inside, while the women, especially the elder, go out of the house with brooms, and abuse the demon with such a string of epithets and names, as would seem enough to drive, not only one Bodrima, but the whole race of demons from this terrestrial globe. On such occasions, people sometimes place at some distance from the house a lighted lamp and some betel leaves, which the demon is said to hold one by one over the lighted wick, and warm and foment her abdomen with. If she were to be fired at, there would\n\nproved that a portion of the stolen property, consisting of some \u00a33 or \u00a34, had been concealed by the thief under the stone in the fire-place, as the least likely place to be suspected of concealing money.\n\n* There are certain ceremonies performed to expel a Gewala Yakseya from a house, especially the Perit ceremony performed by Buddhist priests, generally during three days and four nights.\nremain, it is said, nothing to be seen next morning, but a dead lizard. She is described as being so fat and short, that, when she moves, she appears rather to roll like a cask, than to walk.\n\nXXII. The Pretas are entirely a different race of beings from all that have yet been mentioned. They are the most helpless and miserable creatures in existence. They live only to suffer. Their life itself is a punishment, in which they expiate the sins of a previous state of existence. Their only aliment is spittle, or some other kind of loathsome matter, and even when they get a little of this, their destiny precludes them from making any use of it, and, like king Tantalus they can only look at it with a burning desire. The number of these beings is so great, that a Pali Buddhistical work, which lays down certain rules of discipline for the guidance of the followers of that religion, admonishes them not to throw stones or sticks, nor even to swing their arms when walking, lest they may strike a Pretaya and injure him. The Pretayo are invisible to men; they are of various degrees of stature, some reaching to the height of 3 or 4 hundred feet, others only of one or two feet. Their sufferings from hunger and thirst are indescribably dreadful, and to make their case the more miserable, their appetites are much stronger, than those of any other race of beings. They die several times in a day from sheer starvation, but owing to the inexorable destiny of their race are born again the same instant, to undergo the same round of sufferings over and over again, until they have completed the period of time allotted to them according to their respective sins, after which they are born in some other state of existence, either as Brahmas, dewiyo, men, inferior animals, or in hell, according to the merits of each, acquired in some other previous states of existence. Of course, they are the most loathsome looking creatures imaginable. Their skins hang about them in loose folds, and are so covered with dirt and vermin that they are supposed to emit a disagreeable smell, said to be perceived sometimes at a considerable distance. This smell is sometimes identified by a Singhalese with a peculiar unpleasant stench, often perceived near trees and bushes, caused as we believe, by the effluvia\narising from decomposed leaves and sticks. Their bodies are literally mere skeletons, and as the fleshless ribs project on each side, they are obliged, when they wish to lie down, to lie on their backs.*\n\nHad Dante ever heard of Ceylon Pretayo, he would have been able to make his Inferno, terrific as it already is, still more terrific by the picture of a Pretaya figuring among those miserable beings, with whom he has peopled it. The Pretayo are not included in Demon worship. They are not possessed of power to injure a man in any other way, than by spoiling his appetite, which they effect by looking with desire at the food he is about to take; but this is a power, which is attributed to dogs and men and some other creatures, as well as to Pretayo. When any kind of food, especially meat, is sent from one house to another, care is generally taken to cover it well, and to put on the top of the cover a piece of iron of any kind or size, as a precaution both against the Pretayo and against the Yakseyo demons, who otherwise might affect it with the mysterious influence, which looking at it would produce. Children are seldom fed in the verandah of a house, and a Sinhalese mother would rather die than allow her child to eat anything in the open compound or yard of the house. Even a medical decoction, during the process of being prepared on a fire, is not considered safe from this mysterious influence, and a piece of iron is often tied for protection to the vessel, which contains the preparation.\n\nThe Pretayo, like the Brahmas, Asuras, Cumbhas, Gandharwas, Garundhas, and Nagas, are creations of Buddhism, and not of mere popular fancy.\n\nThe chief of all Ceylon demons is Wahala Bandara Dewiyo, or as he is more commonly termed, Wahala dewiyo. His principal temple, called Gala cap-pu dewale, is at Alutnuwera, a village about 11 miles from Kandy on the road to Colombo. This temple\n\n* When a person sleeps on his back, the posture is derisively named Preta Seyiyawa, or the sleeping posture of a Pretaya; lying on the face is called Manduka Seyiyawa or the sleeping posture of a frog; lying on the right side with the right hand placed under the head is considered the most becoming posture in sleeping, and is called Singha Seyiyawa, or the lion's sleeping posture.\nis believed by all Demon-worshippers to have been built in a remarkable manner; and the circumstance is often mentioned, as one of the proofs of the authority, which the Dewatawa is supposed to exercise over his subjects the demons. It is said that the demon chief, a long time ago, wishing to have a new temple constructed and consecrated to him, in place of the old one in which his service had till then been performed, ordered some thousands of his subject demons to cut and smooth down a rock, which was some seven or eight hundred feet high, so as to fit it for the site of the intended building, they were however to use no other tools, than the common jungle canes called Way Well,* with which they were to rub the rock, till by mere friction it should be reduced to the desired level. The demons engaged in the work were, no doubt, those, who having violated his laws were then undergoing the sentence of hard labour. They however succeeded in executing the work in the manner directed in the course of a single night, and hence the name Gala-cap-pu dewale. Pilgrims from every\n\n* Way Well is a climbing plant, which grows to considerable dimensions in the jungles of Ceylon. It is covered with a coating of short but very sharp thorns. One species of it is used as a file by the people of the inland districts for rasping the hard kernel of the nut of the Sal tree, of which they make a sort of pudding. Being a Rattan of great strength, it is used for a variety of purposes, such as making baskets, rattaning chairs and couches, and even for making rude suspension bridges in the secluded parts of the island. The following is a description of one of these bridges by Sir J. E. Tennent.\n\n\"One which crossed the falls of the Maha Welli Ganga, in the Kotmalie range of hills, was constructed with the scientific precision of an Engineer's work. It was entirely composed of the plant called by the Natives \"Way Well,\" its extremities were fastened to living trees, on the opposite sides of the ravine, through which a furious and otherwise impassable mountain torrent thundered and fell from rock to rock with a descent of nearly 100 feet. The flooring of this aerial bridge consisted of short splints of wood, laid transversely and bound in their places by thin strips of the Way Well itself. The whole structure vibrated and swayed with fearful ease, but the coolies traversed it though heavily laden; and the European, between whose estate and the high road it lay, rode over it daily without dismounting\"\u2014Sir J. E. Tennent's History of Ceylon, Vol. I. part I. ch: iii.\npart of the Island repair to this temple during all seasons of the year, hoping to get relief from some demon influence, with which they suppose themselves to be afflicted, and which appears to them to be irremovable by any other means. This is especially the case with those persons, most frequently women, who are supposed to be possessed by a demon. Dancing, singing and shouting without cause, trembling and shaking of the limbs, or frequent and prolonged fainting fits are considered the most ordinary symptoms of possession by a demon. Some women, when under this imaginary influence, attempt to run away from their homes, often using foul language, and sometimes biting and tearing their hair and flesh. The fit does not generally last more than an hour at a time; sometimes one fit succeeds another at short intervals; sometimes it comes upon the woman only on Saturdays and Wednesdays, or once in three or four months; but always invariably during the performance of any demon ceremony. On these occasions temporary relief is obtained by the incantations of the Cattadiya; but when it appears that no incantations can effect a permanent cure, the only remaining remedy is to go to Gala kep-pu Dewale, where the following scene takes place. When the woman is within two or three miles of the temple, the demon influence is supposed to come on her, and she walks in a wild, hurried, desperate manner towards the temple. When in this mood no one can stop her; if any attempt it, she will tear herself to pieces rather than be stopped. She walks faster and faster, as she comes nearer and nearer to the holy place, until at last, on reaching it, she either creeps into a corner, and sits there, crying and trembling, or remains quite speechless and senseless, as if overpowered by extreme fear, until the Capua begins the exorcism. Sometimes she walks to the temple very quietly, without any apparent influence of the demon on her, and that influence seems to come upon her, only when the exorcism begins. The principal room of the temple is partitioned off by curtains into three divisions, the middle one of which is the sanctum sanctorum of the God, as the demon chief is generally called. The Capua stands\noutside the outermost curtain, with the woman opposite to him. After the offerings of money, betel leaves, and silver ornaments* have been devoutly and ceremoniously laid in a sort of small box opposite to the Capua, he tells the god as if he were actually sitting behind the curtain at the time in a loud and conversational tone, and not in the singing ornamental style of invocations made to other gods and demons, that the woman (naming her) has come all the way from the village (naming it) situated in the Corle or district (naming it) to this temple, for the purpose of complaining to his godship of a certain demon or demons, who have been afflicting her for the last five years (specifying the time she has been under the influence); that she has made certain offerings to the temple, and that she prays most humbly that his godship may be graciously pleased to exorcise the demon, and order him never to molest her again. In this way he makes a long speech, during which the woman continues trembling and shaking in the most violent manner, sometimes uttering loud shouts. Presently the Capua puts to her the question, \"Wilt thou, demon, quit this woman instantly, or shall I punish thee for thy impudence\"? To this she sometimes replies, still trembling and shaking as before, \"Yes, I will leave her for ever,\" but, more generally, she at first refuses; when this happens, the Capua grasps in his right hand a good stout cane, and beats her most mercilessly, repeating at the same time his question and threats. At last, after many blows have been inflicted, the woman replies \"Yes, I will leave her this instant\"; she then ceases to tremble and shake, and soon recovers her reason, if indeed she had ever lost it. So she and her friends return home, congratulating themselves on the happy result of their journey;\n\n---\n\n* One of these ornaments is often a Carandua, or conical box resembling a dagoba, made of silver, and intended as a sort of shrine or receptacle for some holy relic. A silver arrowhead and an image, made of a beaten plate of silver of about two inches in height, intended to represent the person suffering from the Demon influence, are also sometimes added to the other offerings. The money offered to a god or demon is always called Panduru, which means ransom money.\nresult, which is invariably the same in the case of every pilgrim to the temple. We know 30 or 40 women who have made this pilgrimage, only two of whom have ever again shown any symptoms of the return of demon possession. It is said that some 30 or 40 years ago, especially during the time of the Kandyan Kings, four bundles of canes were left at the temple by the Capua every evening before he returned home; that during the night loud shouts and cries and wailing were heard proceeding from the temple, and that the next morning, instead of bundles of canes, there were only small bits of them found dispersed here and there in the premises, as if the canes had been broken in flogging disobedient demons.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nHow Demons inflict Disease.\n\nThe demons enumerated in the preceding pages are those, who are supposed to inflict disease on men, and who therefore principally figure in the various Ceremonies of Demon worship. They are supposed to exercise their malignant power by virtue of the Wurrun permission, which they have obtained for that purpose from King Wessamonny, from the principal demon chiefs, or sometimes from some of the gods themselves. Originally when they were in a lawless state, they enjoyed themselves to their hearts' content, by seizing men wherever they could and eating them up alive, like so many oysters. But after a time these liberties were restrained to a certain extent, and they were allowed to eat human beings, only when the latter happened to come under the shade of the tree on which they lived, or within a certain distance of whatever place they had made their residence. Lastly, cannibalism was wholly prohibited, and, in place of it, permission was given them to inflict disease, and thereby receive offerings, with which they were required to be content.\n\nTheir usual hours of stirring abroad are called Yama. These are 1st, the morning twilight, when there is still some degree of darkness over the earth; 2nd, Mid-day, about 12 o'clock; 3rd, the evening twilight before it has grown very dark; and 4th, Midnight about 12 o'clock. During these Yamas, they stir abroad, as much in search of human victims as by way of recreation. A Singhalese never travels during these Yamas, if he can help it; but if not, he takes care not to go alone (unless it be the midday Yama), unless the country is very thickly inhabited, for solitary travellers are most exposed to the attacks of the demons. There are also certain circumstances in the condition or disposition of an individual, which make it easier for a demon to inflict disease on him; these are\u20141, when the man is asleep; 2, when he has his person perfumed with fragrant unguents and oils; 3, when he travels in a palanquin at night; 4, when a woman is in labour; 5, when the predominant\nfeeling in the mind of a girl at the moment of her arriving at puberty is grief, love, or fear; 6, when a person takes his meals when his mind is not at ease; and a variety of other occasions.\n\nThe usual haunts of the demons are, 1st, large trees, especially Bo, Nika, Ruk-attana, Ironwood, Cohomba, Banyan, Kong, Ehella, Yakberiya, and Belli trees;* 2nd, paths and roads; 3rd, the junction of two or more paths; 4th, ferries and fords; 5th, wells and other places where people come for water; 6th, places, where there are two rocks close to each other; 7th places, where there are two large trees standing near each other; 8th, the seashore; 9th, thick groves of trees and pleasure gardens; 10th, the outskirts of Dewalee (temples of the gods;) 11th, graves and graveyards; 12th, tops of rocks and hills; 13th, places where the noise of quarrels and loud voices is continually heard; 14th, streams of water; 15th, battlefields; 16th, woods composed principally of Belli trees; 17th, places where washermen wash clothes; 18th, old deserted houses; 19th, large open plains or fields; and 20th, sometimes (not often) close behind the dwelling houses of men.\n\nAt these places the demon frightens people not by actually seizing them, but by other means quite as effectual. He sometimes throws sand or stones at them, often handful after handful, along a considerable part of their way; sometimes he appears as a dark featured man on the road or among the bushes near it; or he only shews himself like the passing shadow of a man, followed immediately by a shower of sand or a loud crashing noise among the bushes, as if a number of elephants were actively engaged in beating down the jungle; or he presents himself in the disguise of an old man, or of a young woman with a child in her arms, or merely like a man with a white cloth wrapped round his person from the\n\n* It is on this account, that a Singhalese seldom allows any of these trees to grow very large, when they are situated near his house. He generally cuts them down, before they become fit for the residence of a demon; nor on the other hand will he willingly cut down one which is already very old, fearing it might provoke the demon, who is supposed to be living on it, and bring down implacable vengeance on himself and his family.\ntop of the head down to the ankles. Sometimes the travellers find the road blocked up by a large tree lying prostrate across it with all its branches and leaves quite fresh, and if they try to go some other way, they find themselves similarly obstructed by trees and thick jungle, in places where there were none before; or they hear a loud hoo* shout, which however nobody else in the neighbourhood hears, but they; or a large black dog, or a monkey gives them chase; or they hear the sound of footsteps behind them, as of somebody coming up, but on turning round they see no one, and so they continue their journey, but hardly move a fathom before they hear the same sound again, more distinct and louder, and yet there is nobody to be seen; or when they are quietly moving on, they receive near a certain large tree a smart blow on the back from the cold open hand of somebody, who is nowhere to be seen; sometimes they see a man, a stranger, crossing their path at a short distance in front; or they see a man standing a little out of the road appearing at first to be of the ordinary stature of men, but gradually becoming taller and taller, till he overtops the neighbouring cocoanut tree itself. A Singhalese, to whom any of these things happens, is sure to be so much frightened, as to get some serious illness; on some, their superstitious terrors have had so strong an effect that they have dropped down on the spot perfectly senseless, and have been carried home in a hopeless state, and died within a few days; some have managed to run home but have been taken ill there, and have either died, or recovered only after three or four months of suffering, while others have become raving maniacs for the rest of their lives.\n\nAlthough demons are said to shew themselves in these ways to men, yet the opinion of those, who may be called the more orthodox of the demon-worshippers, is that these apparitions are not the demons themselves, but certain puppet-like spectres, which\n\n* A Hoo shout is one peculiar to the people of this island. It consists of a loud, single, guttural sound, uttered as loud as a man's lungs permit. A quarter of a mile is generally considered to be the distance at which a loud Hoo can be heard.\nthey create and present to the eyes of men, in order to frighten them; that the demons themselves are millions of miles distant from the earth; and that on these occasions of sending forth these spectres, and on every other occasion, whether during demon ceremonies, or at any other time when they are supposed to be present, they do not come themselves, but send their dristia, with or without the spectres, according to the circumstance of each case, or merely according to their own whim. By dristia, which means literally \"sight,\" or \"look,\" is meant that, although they are not personally present, yet they have the power of \"looking\" at what is going on below, and of doing and attending to everything required of them, as if they were actually present. This opinion however is one, which is confined to the more learned of the demon worshippers; the more ignorant believe that the demons themselves are bodily present at these scenes, although they assume some sort of disguise, whenever they choose to make themselves visible to men.\n\nWhen a man is frightened by a demon, and has the influence of that demon upon him, it is called Tanicama, which literally means \"loneliness\" or \"being alone.\" Fright is in most cases a necessary agent in bringing down Tanicama on a man; but it is also possible that a person, who has neither been frightened by a demon, nor been ten yards from his own door for five or six months, may also get the Tanicama influence on him. In this case, the explanation is, that the demon has taken advantage of some unguarded moment in the daily life of the man, as when he has been sitting in the open compound of his house, or when he has happened to go to the back of his house at any of the Yamas, when a demon has happened to be in the vicinity; or when he has eaten roasted fish or eggs, while sitting outside in his Verandah on a Wednesday or Saturday. In this case the man is neither frightened by anything, nor even aware of his danger at the time.\n\nWhen Tanicama comes upon a man, he falls sick and even when a man is ill from some other cause, no matter what, he very often gets the Tanicama, especially when the sickness is getting worse\nThe more dangerous and critical a disease is, the surer is Tanicama to come upon the sick man; and when the disease appears to be past all hopes of a cure, the Tanicama influence becomes strongest, and the demons remain in the very neighbourhood of the sick man's house, if not near his bed. The sound of footsteps, of the violent shaking of trees and bushes, sudden loud sounds, as of striking with whips and sticks, and similar other tokens of their presence and of their joy at the expected death, are supposed to be heard around the house. These ominous signs are called Holman. It is on this account, that so many demon ceremonies are performed, when a person is sick, from the commencement of the sickness to its termination.\n\nThe literal meaning of the word Tanicama gives us a key towards the understanding of many of the mysterious and wonderful circumstances connected with this part of our subject, especially when it is taken in connection with the other doctrine of Demonism already alluded to, viz., that, though a demon try his utmost by means of terrible apparitions or by actual seizure to frighten a man and give him the Tanicama, which results in sickness, yet the man will seldom get ill, if he do not get frightened.\n\nAmong many hundreds of instances of sickness, which we have heard of, as the consequences of Tanicama, the following is one, which came within our own knowledge a few years ago; and we give it here, merely to enable the reader to form some idea of the superstitious fears of a Singhalese, and of the strange pranks, which imagination plays with him.\n\nOne evening about 8 o'clock, some four years ago, we happened to take a walk to the seashore, which was not very far from our house. It was a bright moonlight night, and the sky was glowing with the brilliancy of thousands of stars. We were accompanied by two men, of whom one was a young man, whose name was Baba. The heat was unusually great, so we remained more than an hour on the seabeach on account of the cool sea breeze. The greater part of that hour was taken up by one of our two companions relating ghost stories, to which Baba, like every other Singhalese of his\ncondition was an attentive listener. The road, by which we must return, was a narrow footpath flanked on both sides by thick bushes. Near this path, and about half way between the house and the seashore, was a large bo tree situated in an old graveyard, both of which had always had a bad name among the neighbours, as being haunted by demons, who, it was said, had on diverse occasions frightened many people even in broad daylight. In returning, we had of course to pass this tree and had hardly passed it ten paces, when Baba, giving one of those terrible fierce shrieks of despair and fear, which can hardly be described, threw his arms round the other man, trembling and panting in the most remarkable manner, and the next moment he dropped down senseless on the ground, perspiring most profusely. The other man, who was himself only a few degrees this side of the limits of a fainting fit, managed however to take up the terrified Baba and carry him home. Baba's father and mother having come, a Cattadiya was sent for; in the mean time one of the neighbours pronounced some incantations and the pirit charm over the sick man, who in a little while regained his senses. When the Cattadiya came, more charms were pronounced in an inaudible voice, at the conclusion of which some knots were made in the hair of the sick man's head, and some charmed cocoanut oil was rubbed on his forehead, temples, breast, nails, and on the crown of the head. He was then removed to his own house, accompanied by the Cattadiya and his friends.\n\nWhen Baba was afterwards asked what had frightened him so much, he said that, as he was coming along behind us, he heard, near the large tree, a sort of growl, like that of a fierce dog muzzled, and on looking in the direction he saw a large head peering over a bush from behind the trunk of the large tree.\n\nThe morning after this occurrence, Baba was reported to be very ill. In the afternoon we saw him, and found him suffering from a raging delirious fever. Two days afterwards, the ceremony of Sanni Yakum Neteema or the Dance of the Sanni demons was performed, during which, about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, when\nthe offerings were being dedicated to the demon Sanni Yakseya, the sick man exclaimed, pointing to one of the Tatu or altars, \"there, there, that is the person, whom I saw near the large tree the other day\u2014there he is eating the rice;\"* the next minute he added, \"there now he is going away.\" Of course the eyes of all were turned in that direction, but there was nobody to be seen. The next day the man was better, and three days afterwards perfectly well.\n\nNow in this case, it is plain, that either the man's own imagination, which must have been in a state of very great excitement, as he was passing the tree, conjured up to his sight the semblance of a demon, or that some one wishing to pass off a joke, had concealed himself behind the tree and shewed himself in the manner mentioned above. Of these two, the latter is not very probable, as few Singhalese have the courage to remain after sunset in a place supposed to be haunted; that the former is more probably the truth, is apparent from the fact, that the man recovered from his illness soon after the performance of that particular ceremony, which was believed by him, as well as by all demon-worshippers, to be an effectual remedy for diseases brought on by circumstances like those in his case. That the man's imagination was during all the time in a state of high and morbid excitement, is further proved by his pointing out, during the course of the subsequent ceremony, what he considered to be the demon that had appeared to him near the tree.\n\n---\n\n* The rice alluded to is that which is served out on the Tatu as an offering to the demons.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nSPELLS OR CHARMS IN GENERAL.\n\nIn every demon ceremony, which is performed either to cure or inflict sickness, or to protect a person from becoming liable to any \"demon sickness\" at all, the effective agents, which influence the demons, and, through them, the disease, are Charms or spells, Invocations, and Dolla or offerings, especially the first with or without the two last. Like the sciences and the Literature of the Singhalese (with the exception of their Elu poetry), charms were originally introduced from the neighbouring continent. India, in those remote times, was to Ceylon and other neighbouring countries, what Greece was a little later to the rest of Europe. Wijeyo from India colonized it in the sixth century before Christ, and the literature and sciences of the Vedas naturally came with him, or soon after, until they were partly, but not wholly, superseded, two centuries afterwards by Buddhism and its literature. But Demonism had taken so strong a hold of the popular mind long before the time of Wijeyo, that nothing could displace it, and when any accessions were offered to it in subsequent times in the form of new charms and demons, it seems to have incorporated them with avidity into its old system.\n\nAlmost every charm begins with the words Ohng Hreeng, which, in Sanscrit, are an invocation to the Hindoo Trinity. The Cattadiyas of this country, who are not worshippers of that Trinity, not understanding the purport of the words, but attributing to them some mysterious magical properties, have, in a great many instances, prefixed those words to Singhalese charms, in which the virtues and omnipotence of Buddha are described in a very grandiloquent style, to the exclusion of those of the Hindoo triad. Sometimes however the names of Brahma, Vishnu, Siva and other Hindoo deities are found mixed with those of Buddha and other Buddhist divinities in irretrievable confusion in the same charm. Almost every charm, whether Singhalese, Sanscrit, or Tamil, ends with\nthe word *Eswah*, which is a corruption of the Sanscrit term *Swaha*, corresponding in meaning to *Amen.*\n\nThe Charms or *Mantra*, as they are called, are generally in Sanscrit, Tamil, or Singhalese, but a few are written in other languages, such as Arabic, Persian, Telugu, Malayalim, Bengali, and others. Sometimes in one charm a mixture of many of these languages is used. Sometimes no language seems to have been used. In this last case, instead of any intelligible language, there seems to be a collection of barbarous sounds without meaning. Whether this is the *Paisachi*, which Colebrooke represents the Hindoo dramatists making their demons speak on the stage, we are not able to say.\u2020 It is however probable, that much of what now seems to be no better than gibberish may at one time have been an intelligible language, which, through its transmission from one illiterate Cattadiya to another, through being transcribed from one Ola into another by men not well acquainted even with their own language, and from the peculiar pronunciation used in the recitation of a charm, may have become so far distorted and changed from what it was, as to be reduced to its present condition. We fear we cannot give any correct idea of this peculiar pronunciation; it consists in a very rapid utterance, in which guttural and nasal sounds principally predominate, rendering for the moment even the plainest of Singhalese charms quite an unintelligible jargon; and to aggravate the evil still more, the recitation of a charm is generally performed in a low under tone of voice, scarcely audible to any one.\u2021\n\n---\n\n*Swaha* is also a term, indicative of a certain *Fire-Offering* made to the god of fire, alluded to in Sanscrit works. The wife of the god of fire is called *Swahache Hoctabukpria* \u2014 *Amara Cosa*.\n\n\u2020 Asiatic Researches Vol. VII. p. 199. quoted also by Turner, in his Introduction to the Mahawanso.\n\n\u2021 One of the most remarkable facts, connected with Sorcery or Magic, is, that in all countries and ages of the world, where the Black Arts have ever been cultivated, the incantations to evil spirits have always been pronounced in a low muttering voice, as is still the practice both here, and in continental Asia and Africa.\nThe virtue and efficacy of a charm however consist, it is said, not so much in the meaning of the language used, as in a peculiar arrangement and combination of certain letters, each having its own peculiar power. According to this classification, some letters are called poisonous, others deadly, a third class fiery, a fourth quarrelsome, and a fifth causing banishment. On the other hand there are others called prosperous, some pleasure-giving, a third and a fourth class health-giving and friendly, and a fifth divine; while a few are called neutral. Then again, these letters, when arranged and combined in a certain order, have different virtues\u2014virtues much stronger, than those of single letters. Each of these combinations of letters is sacred to a certain demon, for whom it has an unaccountable, mysterious, and irresistible fascination, from which he cannot free himself. The mysterious virtues of all these combined characters in a charm, are sufficient to overpower and enslave the most powerful demons to the will of the Cattadiya. To make a charm still more irresistible, flattery and entreaties are employed, or the terrible power of king Wessammonny is invoked, or the omnipotence of Buddha, and all set off in language the most horrible* to the ears of a demon-worshipper.\n\nNative authors maintain that Brahma himself was the original author of charms, but that the science, as they call it, was afterwards amplified and improved by nine Irshis or learned pundits, who lived in India some thousands of years ago. It is divided into eight different parts called Carma or acts, according to the different character of the subjects it treats of. These are 1, Mohana or the power of inducing swoons; 2, Stambana or illicit sexual intercourse; 3, Olchatana or the expulsion of demons; 4, Aakarsana or compelling the attendance of demons; 5, Wibeysana\n\n* The most prominent feature in the language of Singhalese charms is an endless repetition of such terms as red blood, heart's blood, eat his lungs, graves, corpses, living corpses, suck his blood, tear open his heart, suck the marrow, a cloth dipped in blood, eat his heart, break his neck and suck the blood, and many others, which have a very appalling effect on the timid, superstitious mind of a demon-worshipper.\nor destruction by discord; 6, Marana or causing death; 7, Tambanaya or power of imprisoning; and 8, Paysana or power of curing diseases. To each of these acts are assigned certain seasons, days, and hours, in which alone anything relative to it can be performed with any hopes of success. Thus, Wibaysana must be performed during the eight hours elapsing between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. at night, during the season called Wasanta; Otchatana, during the ten days intervening between the 10th and 20th day of the season called Gunhana; Marana, in the season Wassana, from the 20th day of the month, which commences that season, to the 10th day of the next month; Aakarsana, during the season Sasat; Stambana, from the 10th to the 20th day of the season Haymanta; Mohana, from the 20th day of the month, which commences the season Sisira, to the 10th of that which closes it; and Paysana and Tambana, during every part of the year.*\n\nIt is believed that there are, or at least there were, in this Island 240,000 different charms or spells of every kind, belonging to the art of Necromancy. An old legend says, that once upon a time, long before the landing of king Wijeyo upon these Coasts, one of the kings of this Island, wishing to marry from a royal family, proceeded to Ayodhia pura (Oude) and being introduced to the royal family of that country on the continent, was permitted to select for his queen one out of the seven daughters of the king. Upon this, being anxious to ascertain what their accomplishments were, he asked each of them, what she was most skilled in. One replied that she was skilled in the magical arts of sickening and killing people by means of Hooniyan charms; another replied, that she could bring immediate death on any one by means of Pilli charms; a third said that she could injure men\n\n* Although there is not much difference of seasons in this Island, yet Sinhalese writers have divided the year into six seasons. viz. 1. Wasanta which corresponds to April and May; 2, Gimhana (hot) which, corresponds to June and July; 3, Wassana [rainy] to August and September; 4 Sarat[dry] to October and November; 5, Haymanta [dewy] to December and January; and 6, Sisira [cool] to February and March.\nby Angam charms; three others also replied in the same way, mentioning some particular department of Sorcery, in which they were most skilled, and by which they could bring diverse calamities on men; but the seventh and last princess said that she knew none of those in which her sisters were accomplished, but that she was well learned in the other class of charms, by which she could restore to health and life men suffering from the former. Upon this, the King of Ceylon, being highly pleased with her, selected her to be his Queen, and brought her away to his country. The other sisters being offended at this as an insult offered to them, determined to take their revenge. For this purpose they collected from all parts of the world every kind of charm, that was productive of evil to man, and inserting them in some peculiar manner in a pumpkin* sent it to their sister in Ceylon, as a present. Their object was to destroy their sister and her kingdom by its means, for on being touched by the hand of the person, for whom it was intended, it was to set on fire both that person and everything else within a hundred Yoduns.\u2020 But while the man, who carried it, was on the sea on his way to the Island, it set fire to his head, and then fell into the sea, from which it was afterwards picked up by a certain god, and presented to the King of Ceylon. These evil spells together with the charms in the healing department, which his own Queen knew, constitute the 240,000 alluded to above. Whatever particle of truth there may be in the story, it is certain that a majority of the charms now in use among the Singhalese were introduced in times much later, than those indicated by this legend.\n\n* The pumpkin was selected for this purpose, because nothing else in the whole universe could hold such dangerous materials without being immediately burned to ashes! In the Ceremony of Hooniyan Kerema, by which all evil influences produced by any malignant charms are sought to be removed, a pumpkin is placed before the sick man, and after ordering, by means of incantations, all such evil influences to \"descend to the pumpkin,\" the Cattadiya cuts the fruit in two, and then throws it into the sea or some other place of water.\n\n\u2020 A Yoduna is 16 miles.\nThough a charm be ever so good in the number and proper disposition of those peculiar combinations of letters we have already mentioned, and though it be complete in all other respects, yet it can have no power for any practical purpose, unless it be subjected to a certain process or ceremony called Jeewama, which literally means, \"the endowing with life.\" This it is, that makes a charm efficacious for good or for evil. A Jeewama is considered to be a ceremony of greater or less difficulty and danger, according as the object of the charm is considered to be more or less easy of accomplishment. For instance, the Jeewama of a charm to cure a gripe or a headache is attended with no danger, whilst that of another, intended to cause the death of a person or to seduce the affections of a girl, is supposed to be fraught with great danger to the life of him, who performs the ceremony. This danger arises from demons, who endeavour to prevent in various ways the accomplishment of the man's object. For, should the charm be perfected by the uninterrupted progress of the Jeewama, the demon would be bound, nolens volens, to accomplish the object aimed at by the charm. Hence their anxiety to interrupt a Jeewama, and to frighten away those engaged in it; the consequences of that fright to the men, being sickness and death.\n\nWhen a Cattadiya is asked why it is that he cannot now do any of those wonderful things, which his predecessors of earlier days are said to have done, and which his omnipotent charms profess to be able at any time to effect, his answer is invariably an argument founded on this danger and difficulty of the Jeewama ceremony.\n\nEvery charm has a sort of rubric appended to it, in which the object of the charm* is stated, and instructions are given in what\n\n---\n\n* Some people have been so anxious to prevent others from making use of any of those \"tried\" [Singhalese Atdu] charms, in whose efficacy they have the firmest belief, that they have managed to render their own manuscript copies mere sealed books to the rest of the world, by writing the rubric in a way unintelligible to those not initiated into the mystery. For this purpose, they\nplace and manner the Jeewama is to be performed, together with a list of the offerings required on the occasion.\n\nThe Jeewama of some charms is as follows.\u2014Tho Cattadiya, or whoever has undertaken the task,* repairs to a grave at one of the Yamas, and prepares what is called a Mal Bulat tatuwa or table of flowers and betel leaves; this is a chair or something similar, with a piece of white \u2020 cloth or a green plantain leaf spread on it; on this cloth or leaf must be placed nine different kinds of flowers, a few of each kind, the yellow flowers of the Areca and the red flowers of a small shrub called Rat Mal being generally of the number. With these is mixed some sandal wood powdered fine and mixed with water; sometimes a few betel leaves,\u2021 with a copper coin, are added. The whole of this is called Mal Bulat tatuwa. On this table is placed a thread or thin string called Kan-ya Nool or Virgin Thread, so called from its having been spun by a virgin from native cotton.|| This thread is coloured\n\ngenerally use a language like that, which Reynolds describes in his Pickwick Abroad and Mysteries of London as used by the abandoned desperados of London.\n\n* Excepting in regular ceremonies, which are performed to cure a disease, persons other than professional Cattadiyas often engage in minor matters of the Art, such for instance as the \"trying\" of a single charm, unless its Jeewama be considered to be one attended with danger.\n\n\u2020 White has been the emblem of purity among all nations and in all ages of the world.\n\n\u2021 These betel leaves must be taken from a plant, from which none have been previously removed by men for the purpose of chewing.\n\n|| Kan-ya Nool threads are used in almost every Demon ceremony, but, what particular virtue they have, or what mysterious relation they bear to demons, I have never been able to ascertain. There are certain rules which are to be observed by the girl in the spinning of this thread; but they are never strictly observed nowadays, lest a strict adherence to them may make her liable to Tanicama or some other similar calamity. By these rules the girl must first wash herself, and then putting around her neck a necklace of Rat mal flowers, with her hair thrown loose on her shoulders, she must sit on the threshold of the door of her house, looking towards the setting sun about 6 p.m., and then spin the mysterious thread.\nyellow by rubbing it with a piece of saffron.* Another table called *Pidayni tatuwa* or *Offering altar* is then made, with the green sticks of a shrub called *Gurulla* or *Burulla* for its legs, and is covered with the inner white bark of the plantain tree, and the broad green leaves of the *Haburu* plant.\u2020 On this altar are placed *Etta Etty* or *Seeds*, being five different kinds of seeds roasted well on a fire, the *Hat Malu*, or *Seven Curries*, consisting of vegetables, fish, and flesh of land animals, and a little boiled rice.\u2021\n\n---\n\n* Saffron is an article used both in the rites of Demonism and in those of Capuism. In the latter, the offerings, which consist principally of money and images of silver, must be rubbed over with saffron, and then wrapped up in a piece of a saffron leaf, before they are placed on the altar. A quantity of water held in a species of jug called *Cotalay* is also coloured and perfumed with saffron; this water is thrown by the Capua on the persons of the devotees as Holy Water.\n\n\u2020 *Haburu* is a sort of potatoe, cultivated in the dwelling gardens of most of the poorer classes of the Singhalese. It also sometimes grows wild. It has no stem nor branches. The leaves are heart-shaped and very large, sometimes measuring 5 feet by 4. The root is large, being sometimes about a foot in diameter, and three or four in length, perfectly cylindrical and of uniform thickness from one end to the other; if the plant be allowed to grow long, this root becomes a sort of stem rising to a height of four or five feet from the ground, with a crown of five or six leaves on its summit. This stem (when there is one), and the root are used by the people for food. It produces a sharp, biting sensation, when taken into the mouth, so much so indeed, that it is with great difficulty that it is swallowed. Some kinds however, which have been carefully cultivated, do not possess this unpleasant quality in any great degree, and some are almost entirely free from it. It is recommended by native doctors as a very valuable medicine to those subject to piles. There are several species of Haburu, most of which are used as food. One or two kinds are especially prized for making Curries. *Cohila Cola* is one of the most favourite dishes of a Singhalese, and it belongs to this genus. Its medicinal properties too are considered to be very great. A medicine called *Cohila Patmay* is prepared from it for those suffering from piles, and we have reason to believe in its efficacy.\n\n\u2021 For fish, a piece of dry fish, and for flesh, a piece of skin from an old leather sandal are generally substituted for the sake of convenience. The rice directed to be used on this occasion is the kind called *El Sal* or Hill Rice,\nis then made on the grave, with Pas Pengiri dara or the wood of five different kinds of trees, the fruit of which is sour to the taste, such as orange trees, lime trees, citron trees, and others of that kind. On this fire is placed an earthen pot containing an egg, and a gentle fire is kept up, till the egg is completely boiled. While this boiling is going on, the Cattadiya lies down on the grave at full length on his back, and pronounces his charm in a low tone a certain number of times, 3, 7, 9, 16, 48, 49, 108, 128, or 133 times, and in some cases so many as 1000 times, each time taking care to throw a small quantity of powdered resin into a pot containing some hot live cinders.* The resin produces a strong-scented thick smoke, with which the Malbulat Tatuwa and the Pidayni Tatuwa are performed. This is done generally as many times as the charm is recited. He then sits up on the grave, and taking into his hand a cock pronounces over it another charm. Next he takes the Kan-ya Nool thread, and, pronouncing a charm over it, makes a knot in it. The charm is recited several times over the thread, and each time a knot is made in it, the firepot being kept smoking, with resin under the thread. Sometimes all this has to be repeated at two succeeding Yamas, after which the charm is considered to be complete. The whole of this ceremony is called Jeewama. The charmed thread is brought away, and used for the purpose, and in the way, directed: for instance, if the object be to cure sickness, the thread is tied round the arm, or the neck, or the waist of the sick person; if the charmed substance be not a thread, but something else, as a betel leaf, and if the object of the charm be to gain the affections of a woman, the betel leaf is given to her through some proper agent.\n\nThe above is only a general description of a Jeewama ceremony. For each charm has its own particular Jeewama, differing from all\n\n* The firepot or the Chafing dish is mentioned by Lane in his Modern Egyptians, and seems to be as much in demand among the sorcerers of Egypt, as among the Cattadiyas of Ceylon.\nothers both in the offerings it requires, and in the time, place, and manner of its performance. However the Kan-ya Nool, altars, flowers, and the smoking firepot, are always required; and graves, generally.\n\nAn ordinary Aaraksa Nool, that is a charmed thread worn about the person as an amulet against Tanicama, requires no greater Jeewama ceremony than this\u2014the Cattadiya having gone to the back of the house with a Kan-ya Nool, some live cinders in a cocoanut shell or a tile, and a little saffron and resin, pronounces his charm in the usual low muttering tone, all the while perfuming the thread with the resin smoke, and making a few knots in it, equal sometimes to the number of times he pronounces the charm. All this does not take up more than 30 or 40 minutes. But in certain other Jeewamas, such as those relating to many kinds of Hooniyan and Pilli, whose object is the destruction of some person, these things are done on a greater scale, and are said to be attended with great danger to the lives of those engaged in them.\n\nThe danger, it is said, consists in this,\u2014When the Cattadiya is going on with his incantation, but particularly about its conclusion when the virtues of the charm are becoming perfected, demons begin to arrive on the spot, one after another, generally in the disguise of beasts and serpents, such as monkeys, black dogs, elephants, tigers, Cobra-de-Capellos, polongas, and sometimes in the shape of old wrinkled grey headed men and women, with the exception of the last demon who appears like a man. Each of these, as he arrives, must be presented with the particular offering appointed for him, such as an egg, a fowl, some boiled rice, a young king-cocoanut, a few drops of blood, or something else as directed in the charm itself; any mistake or delay in presenting the offering being followed by immediate death or incurable sickness to those engaged in the ceremony. The demons, when they approach the scene, do all they can to frighten away the men, either by felling large trees near the spot, or by surrounding the men with a ring of burning jungle, or by creating a thick darkness, such as Milton speaks of in his Paradise Lost, or by uttering loud screams and\nhowls like the roaring of thunder. All this the demons are said to do, in order to prevent the success of the charm: for if the virtues of the charm were to be perfected by the Jeewama, the demons would be spell-bound to act like slaves in effecting that, which the charm is intended for. Hence their anxiety and efforts to frustrate its success. These efforts, it is said, have generally been successful, and many a story is related of men found lying dead on the scene of a Jeewama, and of others, who lived raving maniacs for the rest of their lives, or who died a few days after their attempt to perform the ceremonies, from a delirious fever which no medicine or demon ceremony could cure.\n\nCharms, it is said, do not retain their virtues beyond a certain period; some retaining them only 50 years, while others retain them 100, 300, 700, 900, 1000, 1900, 2700, or 3300 years. Those few alone, of which Brahma himself was the author, retain their efficacy for ever. Besides, the loss of a single letter which belongs to a charm, or the addition of one which does not, or any other alteration, though the smallest possible, is supposed to affect it equally; in this latter case, however, there is said to be a certain method of revising the charm and of restoring its original reading by means of a certain magic table called Siddhi Chakkray.\n\nThe principal works on the subject of charms are Narayena, Mayrutantria, Mantra chinta Mania, and Mantra Kakse, which are all in Sanscrit. Less important works treating both of Demon ceremonies and of charms in general, are Mantra Mala Teeka, Sanka pala Widia, Cola Widia, Bahirawa Widia, Bahirawa Calpe, Cuhara Widia, Sagal Asna, Cumara Widia, and Asura Widia, which are partly in Singhalese and partly in Sanscrit. There are many Cattadiyas now living, who have more or less studied these works, and are celebrated among their countrymen for their professional attainments, among others Caduru Pokuna, and Dandawe Ganitaya and Ratuwatte Cattadiya in the district of Suffragam.\n\nWe have translated a few charms for the amusement of the reader; and in doing so, we have selected those, which would be\nmost intelligible. The following is one which is intended to drive a man mad\u2014\n\n\"Oh Brahma, Vishnu and Siva! I make my adoration to you! Oh, come thou, Hanumana! Oh, come, thou god, Hamunanta! Oh, come thou, Mudana! Oh, come, thou goddess, Madana! Come thou, Baddracali! Come, thou goddess, Baddracali! Come thou, Curumbara! Come, thou god, Curumbara! Oh, come thou, Maha Sohona! Oh, come, thou god, Maha Sohona! Come thou, Gopolla! Come, thou god, Gopolla! Come thou, Recri! Come, thou god, Reeri Yakseya! Oh Samayan, come! Oh, come, thou god of Samayan! Come thou, Wata Cumara! Come, thou god, Wata Cumara! Oh, come thou, Calu Yakseyal! Come, thou god, Calu Yakseyal! Oh Vishnu, come thou! Oh Vishnu's Avatar, come! Come thou, Ayiyanayaka! Come, thou god, Ayiya-nayka! Come from on high! Come from below! Come from all directions! Come from all parts of the universe! Come, all the dewo and all the dewatawas! * Come, all ye demons! Come, all ye demon chiefs! Come, thundering from the sky! Come, making the earth tremble as ye come! Ye demons Encadawara and Malcadawara, all ye dewo and dewatawas, ye male demons and female demons, look at this human being from head to toe! Look at his bones, his sinews, his joints, his neck, his blood, his lungs, his heart and his intestines of 32 cubits in length. Look, look at them! And Oh! receive this human being, as a sacrifice unto you! Take him for yourself! Take him! I dedicate him to you. I dedicate him to you. I dedicate him to you with his dum-mala \u2020 incense. Look at him and accept him. Let this be so.\"\n\n* Dewo are the gods; Dewatawas are the inferior classes of gods and the superior classes of demons. But the Cattadiyas often carelessly apply the latter term to inferior demons too. In charms however, flattery being one of the means of drawing the attention of a demon, no distinction is observed in the application of these terms, as is obvious from the above charm.\n\n\u2020 The incense offered to demons by the Sorcerers of this country is not frankincense and myrrh, as elsewhere in the East, but a species of very inflammable resin called dum-mala, which is obtained from the ground a few feet\nThen come the directions for performing the Jeewama, which are as follow\u2014\"Make a Mal Bulat Tatuwa and three Pidayni Tatuwas on a grave. Use the Etta Etty, the Seven Curries, blood, boiled rice, opium, three lizard eggs, a cock, seven clusters of Rat Mal flowers, the ashes of burnt hair, and roasted meat for these altars. Make an image of wax, and write on it the name of the person, who is to be injured. Take then seven Kan-ya Nool threads, and pronouncing the charm 108 times, make seven knots in the threads, one in each. Put the image on an Areca flower, the first, which that tree has ever produced, and tie them up together by means of the threads. Then take this away and conceal it in the back roof of the house. The man will be insane from that day. To cure him, remove the image from the roof and throw it into a stream, and the man will recover his reason.\"\n\nThe following is a charm for curing any disease supposed to be caused by the demon Reeri Yakseya:\n\n\"Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva! Adoration be to you! The demon Reeri Yakseya, who resides on the rock Mala Dola Gigiriana in the land of Sayurasla, came into this world from the womb of his mother Laytali by tearing himself through her heart, on Saturday in the month of Nawam, [corresponding to a part of February and part of March.] This demon wears a crown of fire on his head, a cloth of blood below his waist, and another cloth of blood above, thrown across his shoulders. He has the face of a\n\nbelow the surface, and also from certain trees, which produce gums equally inflammable and also called dummala, of which the Sal tree is the principal.\n\nThe Ola books of the Singhalese being written with an iron stile, the characters are illegible, but by rubbing on them an oil extracted from dummala, mixed with the ashes of burnt rags, a black colour is imparted to the lines, and so the letters become very legible.\n\nThe practice of offering incense to beings considered to be superior to men, whether they are called gods or demons, is one which appears to have prevailed from the earliest times, and its origin would indeed be a very interesting subject of inquiry both in connection with the history of Ceylon Demonism, and in relation to the Jews, with whom it was usual to make an incense offering to Jehovah.\nmonkey; his feet are of a bloodred colour, and the rest of his person of a golden hue. He brandishes in one hand the Bludgeon, and in the other the Trap of death, by whose apparition he is attended. When he received his wurrun from Iswara, Sekkra, and Brahma, he repaired to a place where three roads met, and standing there, and licking at the same time two pieces of human bones, which he carried in his mouth, his whole person dripping with blood, he clapped his hands and bawled out so dreadful a cry of triumph and defiance, that even the gods of ten thousand worlds were struck with terror and dismay. When the four guardian gods of the world asked, if there was not any one in the universe powerful enough to subdue the demon, they were told that neither Iswara,* nor Brahma, nor Natha, nor Gandharwas, nor Garundas, nor Saman, nor any Sorcerer could do it. Upon this, the great, the glorious, the wonderful Vishnu took a jungle creeper, which grew on the Rock of Blood in Sayurasla Desey, which is situated beyond seven seas and pronounced over it this charm\u2014Oh Brahma, Oh Siva, Oh Vishnu, Oh Walia, come! Come thou, Hanumanta! Come, all ye gods! Come, all ye demons! Come instantly! I bind, I bind. I confine, I confine. Be bound, be bound. Be confined, be confined. Let this be so. By pronouncing these words he bound and subdued the demon Reeri Yakseya. Therefore by the power of Vishnu, and the overthrow he gave thee that day, I compel thee, oh demon Reeri Yakseya, to be bound by my charm. I bind thee. Be thou bound, bound, bound.\u2020 I order thee to heal at once this disease, which thou hast brought on this human being. Let this be so.\n\n\"This charm is to be pronounced over a thread\u2021 or some oil,\u2016 afterwards the oil must be rubbed over the person, or the thread must be tied round his arm; and the patient will recover from that instant.\"\n\n* Iswara, I believe, is another name of Siva.\n\u2020 This repetition of the same word is characteristic of most charms, especially in that part in which its virtues are supposed to be concentrated.\n\u2021 Whenever threads are mentioned in charms or in any thing else relating to Demonism, Kan-ya Nool threads are meant.\n\u2016 When oil simply is mentioned, it is to be understood of cocoanut oil. But\nThe following is a charm for curing headache. It is to be pronounced over a little oil, which must be stirred incessantly with a piece of iron all the time that the charm is being pronounced.\n\n\"Oh Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva! I make my adoration to you! When Ginires dewatawi (she demon of fire), who resides in Ginires Coville (temple of fire), in the country of Ginires Daysa (land of fire), complained to Mangra Dewiyo of the fire which was burning in her head, he (Mangra Dewiyo) sent for milk from the breasts of the Seven Mothers of milk,* and with it put out the fire which was burning in her head; for which he had received Wurrun from sixty-four different persons. By the power he exercised that day, I do this day command that the headache, which troubles this person, do quit him instantly\u2014do flee, flee this moment.\"\n\nAlthough by far the largest majority of charms are either for inflicting or for curing diseases, yet there are many others for various other purposes, and in fact there can hardly be a wish of any kind, be it good or bad, which may not be gratified by charms. Among others, the following is one for inducing demons to throw stones into dwelling houses, so incessantly and so long, as to compel the inmates to desert the house.\n\n\"Oh Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva! Adoration be to you! The she-demon Calu Cambanee, who influenced the bile, the she-demon Narasingha, who influenced the wind, and the she-demon Sen\n\nin some cases when it is expressly mentioned, a composition of several kinds of oil, called Pas Tel or the Five oils, is used. These five oils generally are Cocoanut oil, Gingelli oil, Cohomba oil, Mee oil, and Castor oil.\n\n* There is a certain Dana or Almsgiving ceremony called Kiri Ammawarunray Dana or the Alms of the Mothers of Milk, generally observed three months after the birth of a child. Besides other people, who are invited to the house to partake of food or Dana on the occasion, seven women, sometimes seven unmarried girls, named for the time Kiri ammaala or Mothers of Milk, are made to sit apart from the others, and are treated to a breakfast of boiled rice, plantains, and a sort of jelly called \"Milk,\" made of rice flour, jaggery or country sugar, and the juice of the cocoanut. The dishes of the others, who are treated on the same occasion, are different from these.\nCumari, who influenced the phlegm, in the disease, which afflicted the four great demons, who were the offspring of the great king Carma; the demon Sanni Yakseya, who influenced all the three, the Bile, the Wind, and the Phlegm; the demons, who produce disease by means of the Evil Eye and the Evil Mouth; and the demons and she-demons Takaree, Makaree, Kalaraksee, Yamadootee, Ailakkandi, Mailakkandi, Nanaroopee, Telokadewi, and Oddy Curumbara, these demons and she-demons, who afflict man with 98 diseases, and 99 infirmities, and subject him to the risks of 203 dangers, all you male and female demons, I bind you first by the power of the god Loka Natha; secondly, I bind you by the power of the glorious god Vishnu; thirdly, I bind you by the power of the world-famous goddess Pattini; fourthly, I bind you by the power of the god Saman; fifthly, I bind you by the power of the god Dewol; sixthly, I bind you by the power of the god Canda Cumara; seventhly, I bind you by the power of Andungini Dewatawa; eighthly, I bind you by the power of King Wissamonny himself; ninthly, I bind you by the power of the Graha gods (the Planet gods); tenthly, I bind you by the power of the eight Guardian gods, who are in charge of the eight points of the sky. I bind you all. I bind you all by the power of all these gods. I do this by the same power which the great Prades Rusia* used. Do, as I do. Stay, where I tell you to stay. Go, where I tell you to go. Eat, burn, destroy, when I command you to eat, burn, and destroy. Let this be so.\"\n\nThe Jeewama of the above\u2014\"Put a Champica flower, a flower of the iron wood tree, and a stone on a Mal Bulat Tatuwa, placed on a grave, or at the point of junction of three roads, or near a tree, whose bark has a great deal of sap in it. Then place around the Mal Bulat Tatuwa a little blood, a little milk, a few flowers, and some porri,\u2020 each kind in a separate leaf. Then put up lights all round; having done this take some resin, and pronounce over it the\n\n* Prades Rusia was the first man, who followed the profession of a Cattadiya.\n\u2020 Paddy, as rice in the husk is called here, being put into a vessel and heated over a fire, splits open into large white flakes, which are called porri.\ncharm (not the above but the one used for consecrating resin), and hold up the smoking fire-pot to the Mal Bulat Tatuwa. Next, pronounce the above charm 108 times. Do this at three several Yamas. Lastly, take away the stone, and bury it in the ground under the stile of the garden fence, or at the back of the house. Then throw a stone at the house; and from that day, that house will be pelted with stones. To put a stop to the pelting remove the buried stone, and throw it into a stream or some other place of water, and the stone-pelting will cease from that day.\"\n\nCharms may be divided into two great classes, viz., 1st\u2014Those intended to inflict death, disease, or some other inconvenience upon men; 2nd\u2014Those intended to counteract the first, and remove their evil consequences. Under the head of the first class come several departments of charms, chiefly Hooniyan, Angam, and Pilli charms; under the second, Bandana, Dehena and a few others. These will be treated of in the succeeding chapter.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHOONIYAN CHARMS.\n\nCODIWINA or HOONIYAN is the name given to evils of whatever kind inflicted by the agency of charms. Hence the charms which cause these have been denominated Hooniyan charms. There are said to be 84000 of these, of every degree of malignity, most of which more or less contribute to bring to an untimely death the man affected by their influence, though that event may be deferred for many years. Some Hooniyan charms have the effect of filling a house or garden with so many demons, that the owner finds it difficult to pass even a single night in the house, but if he take heart to do so, it is most probable that he and his family will fall sick, one after another, as if attacked by some contagious disease: others frighten him by hideous night dreams, or by sudden apparitions, even in broad daylight, of large black dogs trying to bite him, or of ugly monkeys grinning at him,* but who vanish the next moment from his sight.\n\nWhatever may be the nature of the disease brought on a man by Hooniyan charms, that disease always resists every attempt to cure it by medicine, and invariably results in the death of the man, unless other remedies be applied in time, viz., those which charms alone afford. For although there are gods and god-worship (capuism), and Buddhistical Pirit and Pirit Nool,\u2020 that hold out to their votaries every protection against demons, and although these gods are beings immeasurably superior to the demons in power,\n\n* These superstitions about demons assuming the disguise of monkeys to frighten men seems to have been current in the time of Shakespeare.\n\nCaliban\u2014\"His spirits hear me...........................................\n\n\"Sometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me\u2014\n\nTempest Act II, Scene II.\n\n\u2020 Pirit is a certain Buddhist ceremony performed for the purpose of removing all sorts of demon influence; and Pirit Nool is a thread consecrated by that ceremony, and used as an amulet for the same purpose.\nyet if a demon bring his malign influence to bear upon a man through the agency of Hooniyan charms, no power on earth below or in the sky above can save him, unless he resort to the very art, which in the hands of his enemies has injured him so much. Generally, if a man often gets sick, especially from rheumatic attacks, and if he frequently feels thirst accompanied by an unusual degree of heat in the blood, especially about the region of the chest, he will attribute it to Hooniyan charms and more so, if he recollects that he has an enemy in one of his neighbours: and even though he has no enemy, yet if his sickness seems to resist the skill of his physician, and if a burning sensation in his body is one effect of his sickness, and if he is often troubled by dreams in which black dogs, monkeys, and horrible looking men try to frighten him, he is sure that his sickness is a Hooniyan. If a man in climbing a tree, or in moving from the top of one tree to that of another on the ropes which connect them together (as is the case with cocoanut trees during the season of distilling Arrack), makes a false step and is thereby precipitated to the ground whereby he dies, the probability is that the calamity will be attributed to a Hooniyan*: and this probability will not be the less strong, because the man may sometimes happen to escape with only a few bruises and fractures; but it will, on the contrary, be much more strengthened by what the man himself relates, which generally amounts to this\u2014that, while he was on the tree, he was thrown down by somebody whom however he did not see, or that he was frightened by some monstrous-looking being, which appeared and disappeared with the rapidity of lightning, or that he suddenly and most unaccountably felt giddy and faint and so lost his footing and fell; all which to the\n\n* About twelve months ago, there was a lawsuit between one of our friends and another man, so they were not on the very best of terms with each other. Before the case was decided, the other man happened to fall from a cocoanut tree and died instantly. It was therefore imputed to a Hooniyan charm practised by our friend. And the two families are now at deadly enmity with each other.\nminds of his friends are so many proofs of a Hooniyan cause, although some unfriendly wag of a neighbour might insinuate that the man was tipsy with Toddy rather than affected by a Hooniyan cause at the time. Suppose a man and his wife constantly quarrel and do not like each other's company, especially at the commencement of their matrimonial life, and neither of them can assign any adequate reason for it, then, although the man's friends will say that the woman is wholly to be blamed, and the woman's friends that the man is solely to be blamed, it is most probable however that both these sets of friends in their cooler moments will say that a Hooniyan must be the sole cause of this domestic misery. A young woman is betrothed to a young man, but sometime afterwards the match is broken off through the non-consent, say, of some of the girl's relatives, and she is therefore given in marriage to another young man, and in due course of time she gives birth to a child; if, during the pains of delivery, she suffers much, and is not easily delivered of her burden, you will then hear but one word whispered in low accents from mouth to mouth among all the relatives and friends assembled there; and that word is Hooniyan. You may see some of these relatives standing in groups of 2 or 3 in the compound or behind the house, engaged in an earnest, anxious, grave, and whispering conversation, others hurrying here and there either in search of a skilful Cattadiya, or in making preparations for performing some special demon ceremony, although similar ceremonies had been performed months before in anticipation of such a calamity, a suspicion of which necessarily arose from the circumstances attending the marriage. Or you may see one Cattadiya, standing near the house, muttering his charms over a small tea-cup containing some cocoanut oil or over a thread; and another standing before the distressed woman, and with an \"Arecanut Cutter\"* cutting three limes,\u2020 at the\n\n* An Arecanut Cutter is an instrument, which is found in every Sinhalese house. As its name implies, it is used for cutting Arecanuts preparatory to their being chewed with betel leaves, chunam, and tobacco.\n\n\u2020 The cutting of limes on this, and on every other occasion when it is intend-\nsame time pronouncing some short charms in a voice a little more audible than usual. And after all, if the woman dies, it only confirms the truth of what they had but surmised at first.\n\nIn most Hooniyan charms, a small image made of wax or wood, or a figure drawn upon a leaf or something else, supposed to represent the person intended to be injured, is necessary. A few hairs of his head, some chippings of his finger nails, and a thread or two from a cloth worn by him, and sometimes a handful of sand from a place on which he has left his footprint, are also required, when the image is submitted to the Jeewama, especially in Hooniyans directed against parties intending to marry. Also Pas Lo or five metals, that is nails made of a composition of five different kinds of metals, generally gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead, are driven into the image at all those points, which represent the joints, the heart, the head, and other important parts of the body. The name of the intended victim is also marked on the image. After the Jeewama, this image is buried in the ground in some suitable place, such as under the stile of the garden fence, or in some other spot, where the intended victim is likely to \"pass over\" it. This \"passing over\" is essential to the success of a large majority of Hooniyan charms. After this, the image is either left in the same place, or is taken out and secreted in some other place according to the directions in the charm itself. In the case of some Hooniyans, which however form but a small minority, this \"passing over\" is not needed at all, as, for instance, in those intended to produce impotency in a man.\n\nTo ensure greater certainty of success to a Hooniyan charm, other precautions are also sometimes taken, such as ascertaining from the horoscope of the party the particular season or day or\n\ned as a part of a demon ceremony, is done in a particular manner; the lime is placed between the two blades of the Arecaut Cutter, where it is held firmly by slightly pressing with the fingers the two ends or handle of the \"Cutter,\" while the charm is being pronounced over it. Then, as the last word or syllable of the charm is being pronounced, and before its sound can have time to die away, the fruit is at once cut in two by a single effort.\n\n* Panna-wana-wa is the Singhalese term for this.\nhour, in which some planet or planets appear to threaten him with some calamity, and regulating the time of performing the Hooniyan accordingly.\n\nHooniyan charms are considered to be so powerful, that, even if a person other than the one for whom the charm was intended happen to be the first to \"pass over\" the buried image, he too is injured in some degree; the diseases produced in such a case being generally sores, boils, and itches on the feet, especially on the soles. A man, who sees a boil on the sole of his foot, and knows that he has not been treading on any jungle thorns, immediately suspects that he must have been \"passing over\" a buried Hooniyan charm, intended either for himself, or for somebody else; and so the Cat-tadiya and his Hooniyan kapeema ceremony are soon put in requisition, together with the assistance of the physician, the Capua, the Astrologer, the Balicaraya, the Buddhist priest and the Sooth-sayer; who, each in his own way, contribute to the desired result; for the creed of a Sinhalese is, not to wait for a cure from one source alone, but to avail himself of all within his reach, although the art of Sorcery is positive in its dogma, that an evil caused by that art can be remedied by it alone, and by none other.\n\nThe following are the names of a few Hooniyan charms, considered to be unfailing in their effects, together with a brief description of the nature of these effects.\n\n1. Marulu Pennuma.\u2014Causes madness\u2014burning heat everywhere in the body\u2014frequent deprivation of the senses\u2014running into words and streams\u2014shouting, weeping, using violent and abusive language\u2014paroxysms of rage\u2014fainting fits\u2014eventual death.\n\n2.

The she-demons Cadawara Reeri Yaksenee, Billey Reeri Yaksenee, Calu Candi Yaksenee, Marana Keela Yaksenee, Samayan Cadawara Reeri Yaksenee, and Calu Roopa Yaksenee, who all sprang into being from the blood, which spouted up into the air from the heart of queen Seetapatee of the city Seetapatee Nuvera, once upon a time rushed into Bangala (Bengal) and thence to Nuvera Ellia, where they rested on the rock Gala Tala (Pedro Talla Galla.) Each wore around her neck a garland of flowers, a chain of gold, and a chain of silver. They then sent forth a deadly ball of fire and smoke to Ramapura, and another to prince Rama, by which both that prince and the prince Sumana Disti Cumara were affected with demon-influence. Next they looked down upon the rest of the world of human beings, and took possession of 1000 children, 1000 women, and 1000 men, making these creatures tremble, and cry, and shout, and rave, and die. These she-demons I bind by the power of the king Wissamomny. Let the she-demons Muni Cadawara Reeri Yaksanee,\nYamacali Yaksenee, Raticami Yaksenee, and Sanni Cami Yaksenee, come hither. Come instantly. Come, thundering from the sky. Make the sky and the earth roar and reel, as ye come. The she-demons Cadawara Reeri Yaksenee and Muni Billey Yaksenee with others once went to the city Capila, and began to devour the citizens; whereupon the king Wissamonny and the king of the gods, binding them with chains of fire and human bones, checked their ferocity and frightened them exceedingly. Therefore by the power of these gods, I command you, oh she-demons, to look here. I command you to come directly to me without looking anywhere else. I bow down to thee, Oh Buddha! The she-demons Lay Cadawara Yaksenee, Reeri Cadawara Yaksenee, and Aaweysa Cadawara Yaksenee once went to the mountain Nawasiagiri Parwatte, where they devoured the heads of nine hundred princes, and killed the great prince Cewulia Cumara, whose blood they drank. When the son of king Wijeyo was playing in his royal father's flower garden, Aaweysa Cadawara Reeri Yaksenee struck him with her necklace of flowers, which hurled him many thousand fathoms high into the air. She once went to the rock Maha Lay Parwatte, but the great demon chief Malla told her to descend to the earth inhabited by men, and to feed on such as she liked. Oh Aaweysa Cadawara Reeri Yaksenee, I call upon thee to listen to what thy priest tells thee. Demon, thy own priest calls upon thee. I beg thee to attend to what I tell thee, and not to any thing else, which any other priest may tell thee. Oh Aaweysa Cadawara Reeri Yaksenee, oh great she-demon, I call upon thee this day to be bound by my charm. I call upon thee to accept an offering, which I make to thee and thy sisters. I call upon thee by the power of all the gods. Therefore, come here. Look here and come soon. I call upon thee, and command thee by the power of Vishnu, to cast thy influence upon this human being, and to take him wholly to thyself. I beg thee to protect me. I call upon thee to tell thee, that from this day, and this hour, and this minute this human sacrifice, which I dedicate to thee, is wholly thine. The Cattadiyas are thy obedient slaves. Therefore protect me, but take this\nhuman being as an offering acceptable to thee. Take him. Take him this instant as an offering made by thy servant. Oh she-demon, oh my sister, eat him. Eat his flesh and drink his blood. Eat his bones, and muscles, and nerves. Drink his heart's blood and suck his marrow. Eat his liver and lungs and entrails. Look at him from head to toe, and cover him this instant with thy influence. I command thee this day, oh Aaweysa Cadawara Reeri Yaksanee, who wast born from three drops of blood, to suck the blood out of this human being. I give him over to thee. Take him. I ask thee and all other she-demons to afflict him with heat, fever, and pain in all the 800 joints and 900 nerves of his body, and in the 300,000 pores of his skin. Remain thou with him, till I come back to thee. I tell thee, listen not to any other Cattadiya. By Wissamonny's power I bind thee to do this. I bind thee. I have bound thee. Let this be so.\"\n\nThe Jeewama of the above\u2014\"Make three Pidayni Tatu (altars) and divide each Tatuwa into four compartments. Place in each of these compartments boiled rice of a yellow colour, some of a white colour, and some of a black colour; also place on any of the Tatu some milk in two separate leaves, some blood in two separate leaves, five kinds of fried meat, an arrow, and a cock. Surround all these with three turns of a Kan-ya Nool thread. Then placing one of the Tatu to the east of you, and the other two at your feet, pronounce the charm 133 times over a Kan-ya Nool thread and a cluster of Rat Mal flowers, which you hold in your hand.* You will then see three apparitions, but, without getting frightened by them, bind them by your charm. Then take away the thread and the flowers, and get them passed over: after which, keep them carefully secured in a box. This Jeewama must be performed on a grave during three Yamas of a Sunday. The man will get mad in three days.\"\n\n* The dummala incense, although not mentioned above, must also be used on this and on all similar occasions. It is omitted here, only because it is too well known as a sine qua non of every demon ceremony to require express mention.\nThe Jeewama of Sohon Gini Bandenay (No. 13 in the above list)\u2014\"Near a tree, the bark of which has much sap in it, draw on the ground two figures representing the man and his wife, with a piece of charcoal obtained from a place where a human corpse had been burned. Write the names of the parties on the breasts of these figures with the same piece of charcoal. Write also on each of the figures the letters a, e, u. Then pronounce the charm over a steel nail, and drive the nail into those parts of the figures which represent the private parts. Pronounce the charm again over 16 nails made of Pas lo, and drive them into those parts of the figures which represent the joints. Remove then the earth on which the figures were drawn, and bury it in a grave a few inches below the surface, and make a fire over it with Pas Pengiri (the wood of five kinds of trees the fruit of which is sour to the taste:) Keep up this fire for sometime. For offerings, put on an altar some blood, some Rat Mal flowers, a roasted egg, and some boiled rice, each in a separate leaf. All this must be done on a Sunday. The husband and wife will fall sick, become insane, have paralysis in their legs, quarrel and fight with each other, and die at the end of three months, if remedies are not applied in time. The remedy is this\u2014dig a hole in the ground where a human corpse has been burnt. Throw in it nine kinds of flowers and some boiled rice, each folded in 9 separate leaves. Put on an altar close by 9 leaves containing the juice of Rat Mal flowers, and 9 containing boiled rice, and 8 limes. Repeat then these charms (not given here), and taking the limes to the sick people, cut them, pronouncing over them the seven charms Hanama Wettu Alagu. The sick people will recover.\"\n\nThe Jeewama of Madena Sohon Bandenay (No. 14)\u2014\"Draw the figure of a man on a tiger's skin, and the figure of a woman on a deer skin. Write the names of the man and his wife on the breasts of the respective figures. Then put upon the figures a Divi Caduru leaf,* a piece of charcoal obtained from a funeral\n\n* Divi Caduru is a tree which grows to a considerable height. Its leaves are about a foot long, and two and a half or three inches broad, very thick,\npile, and seven grains of unboiled rice. Fold these in the skin, and tie the two skins together with seven turns of a Kan-ya Nod thread. Before you use the thread for this purpose, repeat over it this charm 49 times, taking care to make a knot every seventh time. Then take 9 thorns from Pas Pengiri trees, and pronouncing the charm 9 times over them drive them into the skins. Make also an altar, and place upon it Rat Mal flowers, milk, porri, and sandal wood, each in a separate leaf, place these at the four corners of the altar, and the skins in the middle. Then perfume them with the smoke of resin, and pronounce the charm 7 times. All this must be done on a Sunday during the morning Yama. After this take away the skins and strike with them the stone, which is opposite to the door of the house. The man and his wife will become insane, and quarrel with each other, and die in a short time.\"\n\nEvery Hooniyan, that produces sickness, ends in death, unless it is prevented in time by charms; and no other remedy but charms can effect a cure, whatever the nature of the disease may be. The longer the Hooniyan influence remains on a man, the less chance there is of its removal, probably because the demon acquires a sort of prescriptive right over his victim, until he bring the man to death in his own time, that is within the time assigned in the charm. Hence, in the mind of a Singhalese, suspicion is always awake and ready to discover a Hooniyan cause in the various misfortunes, which he may meet with in the ordinary course of nature, in the form of disease and accidents. And hence also it is, that he so often has recourse to charms and demon ceremonies, even when he is in the enjoyment of perfectly good health, merely because he wants to ease his mind, which otherwise would be made very unhappy by a doubt, whether a Hooniyan influence may not then be upon him, although as yet there does not appear even to himself anything, which he can consider to be a sign of it.\n\nand of a dark green colour. When bent, the leaf breaks and exudes a thick white sap considered to be poisonous. The fruit when ripe is of a beautiful red colour, and is very tempting to the sight, from which circumstance probably it is, that it has sometimes been called Eve's Apple.\nANGAM CHARMS.\n\nThere is another class of charms, which, though intended to injure others like Hooniyan, have yet been called by a different name, and are supposed to have been originated by a different Irshi. While Hooniyan are supposed to affect a man at different intervals, varying from a day to 30 or 40 years from the time of the Jeewama, and to cause death generally by slow degrees, preceded by a variety of diseases, of which insanity, paralysis in the limbs, and extreme heat in the region of the chest are the most common; these are supposed to be more speedy in their effects, death taking place invariably within seven hours, without any previous indication of disease other than a throwing up of blood through the nose and mouth. These charms are called ANGAMS, of which there are on 1\n\n32. The following are their names:\n\n1 Udatringley Angam\n2 Hasta Angam\n3 Suruttu Angam\n4 Talpat Angam\n5 Neecha Cula Angam\n6 Rodi Angam\n7 Caturu Angam\n8 Leynsu Angam\n9 Tadicara Angam\n10 Choragata Angam\n11 Reeri Angam\n12 Hanuma Angam\n13 Heywa Yakse Angam\n14 Hena Rawana Angam\n15 Maha Sohon Angam\n16 Muduhiru Angam\n17 Narapura Induwa\n18 Narapura Inchia\n19 Naraporottuwa\n20 Widurucodi Angam\n21 Widuru Maraney\n22 Geri Angam\n23 Hasti Angam\n24 Cula Angam\n25 Sunaka Angam\n26 Taruka Angam\n27 Yakse Angam\n28 Wata Angam\n29 Curumbera Angam\n30 Raja Angam\n31 Dewa Angam\n32 Neela Angam\n\nThese Angams are made use of in the following manner. After the jeewama, the substance subjected to that ceremony, whether it be a flower, a thread, an image, a stick, a handkerchief, a finger ring, or a young cocoanut leaflet, is sometimes (1) buried in the ground at some place, which the intended victim may happen to\n\"pass over\" as in Hooniyan; or (2) the operator may keep it in his hand and blow upon it, so as to make the breath fall upon him, or (3) he may touch his person with it still holding it in his hand, or (4) he may throw it into his face, or (5) he may fan him with it, or (6) he may make him touch it, or (7) he may leave it at some particular place, where he cannot but take it when he sees it, or (8) he may stretch out his hand towards him, or (9) he may keep it in his hand, and only look at his face; which of these is to be done, depends upon the nature of the particular Angam. In almost all these cases, the victim is supposed to fall down suddenly in a state of insensibility and to bleed, profusely from the nose and mouth, and, if remedies are not applied within seven hours, death is said to be the result.\n\nUdatringey Angam (No. 1 in the List,) is to be used against a man who happens to be standing on any thing higher than the ground, as for instance on a tree, for it is supposed that none of the other Angams can produce any effect on him, so long as he does not touch the ground with his feet. It is also thought that those sailing on water can be affected only by this, but on this point the scientific in these matters do not seem to be agreed.\n\nIn the next, No. 2, the charm is pronounced over the right hand which then, being extended towards any one, is supposed to make him fall, bleeding from his nose and mouth, and death ensues at the end of seven hours.\n\nIn No. 3, a quantity of Rat Mal flowers, over which the charm has been duly pronounced at the Jeewama, are rolled up with tobacco into a cigar, which is smoked, so as to let the smoke be blown by the wind towards another. The same consequences follow as in the 1st.\n\nIn No. 4, an Ola being charmed is rolled up in the form of a Talpotta or native Ola letter,* and is sent to the party marked\n\n* Talpotta is the leaf of the Palmyra, as Talapotta is of the Talipot. The leaf of the Palmyra was, a few years back, the \"Note\" and \"Letter\" paper of the Natives; and it is still so generally throughout the Island. The leaf of the Talipot is seldom used for this purpose, but is reserved for making books.\nfor destruction, who, on breaking open or rather unloosing the bands of what appears to him to be a letter, falls down senseless.\n\nIf a man however be fortified by charms against Angams and other agents of demoniac power, he can be affected only by the Angam called Neecha Cula Angam, (No. 5), which can break through all such defences, and affect the man as easily as if he had never been protected by any charms whatever.\n\nIf you tell a Cattadiya that his science of charms is nothing but an absurd ridiculous fiction, calculated to delude only the most ignorant and credulous; that it can do nothing to those who do not believe in it, and if you ask him why it cannot injure an Englishman, although the latter courts and challenges a trial, he will tell you, if you are a Singhalese, (but if you are an Englishman, he will give you a very different reason), that, though a demon revels in blood and human carcasses, yet he possesses certain ideas of cleanliness and decency, and that therefore he is unwilling to affect with his influence an Englishman, who does not cleanse his person with water after the discharge of the bodily functions; he will tell you indeed that there is one low filthy demon, who, being indifferent to dirt, does influence even an Englishman, when forced to it by the charm called Rodi Angam, (No. 6); but that in the Jeewama of this Angam, a green leaf of the Alu Kesel* plantain tree, used by a Rodia (a man of the lowest caste in the Island) to put his meals on, is necessary; and that it is extremely difficult to get this, as no Rodia will leave it behind him after he has taken his meals on it, and will not part with it to any but one of his own caste.\n\nIf sticks or clubs, submitted to the Jeewama of Tadicara Angam (No. 9), are left on roads and other places frequented by people, any person passing by and seeing them will be irresistibly compelled to take them up, and use them in assaulting every one he may happen to see, and at last turn them against himself.\n\n* Alu Kesel literally means Ash Plantain; it is so called from its fruit being covered with something similar to ashes.\nThe following is the charm *Neela Angam* (No. 32):\n\n\"Oh Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, may you be adored! Oh demon of blood, receive this human sacrifice, which I make to thee. Accept it instantly. Look at it with thy thousand eyes. Oh Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, may you be adored! Stop ye, Pilliran and Neeliran. Wissamonny's power is great. There is not a demon, who does not feel his power. Stop thou, Caluga Pullay! Vishnu is great. His authority prevails over all demons. Stop thou, Elendri Dewi! Stop ye all! I make this sacrifice to you. I dedicate this human being to you. Blood of a delicious taste, heart, lungs, liver, and marrow, all delicious, are yours. I deliver him to you. Take charge of him. He is yours. Thou, Reeri Yaksanee, look at him instantly, and take him as an offering acceptable to thee. Take him immediately. Throw him down. Oh Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, adoration be to you! The powers which originated from queen Yasodara, and the powers belonging to Vishnu, as they now prevail at the temple of the Cannibal demons, and who once destroyed the prince Wisamatoma\u2014by these powers I deliver this being to thy charge, Oh Siddhi Maha Sohon dewatawa, and to thy charge, thou son of Gajacumbacari. By those powers I command, that he, who crosses this stile before my return hither, be taken charge of by Billey Gopolu Yaksanee. Let the dewatawa [Maha Sohona] take charge of him, as his. Let Billey dewatawa of the South take charge of him, as his. Let Dalla Seyna, chief of demons, take charge of him, as his. Take him. Thou Siddhi Maha Sohon dewatawa, look at him and take him. Throw him down. Throw him. Do it. Let this be so.\"\n\nThe Jeewama of the above\u2014\"Make a Mal Bulat Tatuwa on a grave, or at a place where three paths meet, and put on it some sandal wood dissolved in water, a few Rat Mal, Idda Mal, and Jessamine flowers, each kind in a separate leaf. Make a Pidayni Tatuwa* and put upon it a human bone, some porri, a little blood,\n\n---\n\n* The difference between a Mal Bulat Tatuwa and a Pidayni Tatuwa is, that on the former rice and other eatables are not offered, while on the latter they are, with or without flowers and perfumes.\nand the fang of a Cobra de Capello, each in separate leaves, together with a young king cocoanut cut open at one end without spilling its water. Then surround the whole with a Kan-ya Nool thread, so as to include within the ring the Mal Bulat Tatuwa, Pidayni Tatuwa, and yourself. Lie down on your back with your head towards the north. Place one of the Tatus on your right and the other on your left, and the fire pot and resin near your right foot. Repeat then the charm 108 times, each time smoking the two Tatus with the resin. Do this during the midnight Yama of a Sunday. After this, put the sandal wood powder carefully into a little box, and pronouncing over it the charm three times, shut the lid with your right hand, while you support the box on the back of your left hand. Then take this away, and rub some of the sandal powder on any of the cross sticks of the fence stile with the middle finger of your right hand; every one, who attempts to get over that stile during the first seven hours, commencing from the time you first rubbed the sandal on it, will fall down senseless and bleeding, and, if not cured immediately, will die in seven hours.\"\n\nAngams and Wedding processions are so intimately connected with each other in the mind of a Singhalese, that, if a bridegroom or his bride happen to feel a little unwell while on their way to be married, it will most probably be attributed to an Angam. During these processions, that is, when the bridegroom goes to the house of the bride, or when he returns to his own accompanied by her and all their relatives, it sometimes happens, that either he or she, and sometimes both, get hysterical and fall into swoons which last about a quarter of an hour. This is most probably owing to their having, for the best part of the day, been obliged to remain overloaded with an amount of clothing,* to which they (especially the\n\n---\n\n* The ordinary dress of a man of the middle classes consists only of a Sarou or four yards of white cloth, wrapped round his person so as to cover it from the waist to a little below the knee. When a man has occasion to go beyond the precincts of his village, this dress is a little improved upon; he puts on a jacket and sometimes a shirt and wears sandals on his feet, he adorns his head too with a large comb, which is worn in different fashions by different castes.\nman) had never been accustomed; combined with the heat, noise, excitement, and their own consciousness of being for the time the \"observed of all observers.\" Hysterics or any sudden sickness on such occasions is always attributed to an Angam caused by some unfriendly person among the company. The Cattadiya, who often forms one of the company to be ready on such an emergency to render his services, does his part on such an occasion, and of course the patient generally recovers under his management, as much to the glory and honour of the profession as to his own personal benefit. I recollect several instances of this kind, which have occurred in my own presence, among others, the following:\u2014\n\nAbout 19 years ago, when I was a lad of 15, I was on my way to school with three or four school fellows, when we heard the usual accompaniment of a Wedding Procession, viz., the sound of drums and of brass cymbals, mingled with the loud voices of three or four singing men all chanting together in a sort of chorus. We all stopped to see the procession, which was slowly moving on towards us at some distance in our rear; and as their way lay in the same direction and on the same road as ours, we gladly kept them company, keeping as near as possible to the tom-tom players and the dancing boys, who interested us much more than anybody else in the procession, the bride and bridegroom included. Immediately behind us were some 10 or 15 people, and next to them came the bridegroom. He was dressed, as is usual on such an occasion, in the style of a Modliar, and was attended on his right and left by his two \"friends,\" men nearly of the same stature and dressed in the same style as* himself. Then came some more people, and behind them the bride and another woman in a bullock hackery. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed from the time we joined them, when we heard the cry apoyi (ala-s), the usual expression of distress. I turned round, and saw the bridegroom with closed eyes and drops of perspiration pouring down his face in the\n\n* Instead of men of the same height as the bridegroom sometimes two little boys are substituted, which custom however prevails only in and near the larger towns.\narms of three or four people, who were supporting him from falling down, and apparently senseless. His great velvet coat was now removed, and the shirt collar opened to give him the benefit of air. In another moment a man was seen pronouncing in an inaudible voice (the motion of the lips alone could be seen) his charms, first over a lock of hair of the sick man, which he formed into a knot after his mutterings were concluded, and then over a cup of water. In 5 or 6 minutes more, some of the charmed water was sprinkled over the man's face, and some poured down his throat. He almost immediately recovered, and the procession again moved on. When the incantations were over, I heard the Cattadiya say, with an air of confidence and triumph. \"Now, don't fear, he will be all right soon,\" and sure enough he was, which even then, young as I was, I thought was more owing to the refreshing coolness of the water he drank, than to any supernatural virtues imparted to it by the incantations. Several members of the procession, especially the nearest relatives of the bridegroom, gave vent to their feelings of resentment in dark, mysterious hints, expressed in obscure and sententious language, such as \"Very well\" with a peculiar shake of the head, \"Well, let us see,\" \"You can see,\" \"We are also still living,\" and other similar expressions, quite intelligible to a Singhalese, and which boded no good to the culprit, who had brought this Angam on the bridegroom.\n\nWe can adduce instances like this in great numbers; but the above will suffice to give an idea of a Wedding procession afflicted by what is supposed to be an Angam charm.\n\nIn 99 cases out of a hundred, it is the bride, and not the bridegroom, who displays these symptoms of what is supposed to be Angam influence.\n\nWhether a Cattadiya forms one of the procession or not, certain precautions are always taken against the bridegroom or the bride falling under the influence of an Angam. These precautions consist in pronouncing charms over one end of the handkerchief which they carry in their hands, and then tying up that end into a knot. Sometimes other amulets called Yantra are worn about their persons.\nThere are three other kinds of charms, called respectively Kalan, Culambu, and Serra, intended for the same purpose, and used nearly in the same manner as Angams, but slightly differing from them in certain respects. This difference is said to consist in this, viz., that, while Angams can only affect men, Kalang, Culambu, and Serra are powerful enough to affect demons too, although in their case death does not result, as in the case of men. These are said to be used sometimes in cases of demoniac possession, when it is found difficult to exorcise the demon by ordinary charms. The exact number of these has not been ascertained. We give below the names of some of them.\n\n**Calang.**\n\n1. Vishnu Calang  \n2. Canda Cumara Calang  \n3. Dedimunda Calang  \n4. Pattini Calang  \n5. Dewol Calang  \n6. Narapura Calang.\n\n**Culambu.**\n\n1. Vishnu Culambu  \n2. Canda Cumara Culambu  \n3. Dedi Munda Culambu  \n4. Pattini Culambu  \n5. Dewol Culambu\n\n**Serra.**\n\n1. Vishnu Serra  \n2. Canda Cumara Serra  \n3. Dedi Munda Serra  \n4. Pattini Serra  \n5. Dewol Serra  \n6. Wayissrawana Serra.\n\nThe Jeewama of these three classes of charms is supposed to be attended with greater danger to those engaged in it, than of any other class of charms yet mentioned, and it is pretended that on that account they are seldom or never resorted to.\n\n---\n\n**Pilli Charms.**\n\nWe now come to that, which is considered to be the highest and most important class of charms, which is said to exhibit the extraordinary powers of the art of Sorcery in the most unequivocal manner. We mean Pilli. In the case of the other classes of\ncharms already noticed, although the effects produced by them are brought about by demons, yet these demons themselves, never appear visibly to men even in disguise, except at the Jeewama ceremony of some of them. But the Pilli charms are considered to be so singularly powerful, that the demons assume some visible shape, while executing the duty assigned them by the charm. Besides, the effects of a Pilli charm are said to be instantaneous, almost simultaneous with the conclusion of the Jeewama. In the case of Hooniyan (a very few excepted), several months may elapse before the charm begins to take effect, and even then it takes a considerable time to bring the man to his grave. In Angams there is an interval of seven hours between the moment of death and the time, when the charm first takes effect. But in Pilli, death is the only effect, and that almost simultaneous with the Jeewama. Again, both in Hooniyans and Angams, even after they have taken effect, there is still a chance of a cure at any time before the man breathes his last; but the moment a Pilli charm takes effect, there is an end of every hope of escape, even though the actual moment of death may be an hour or two later. If a man however be a sorcerer himself, and, before the charm has taken effect on him, is able to ascertain that a Pilli is directed against him, he can, if he is acquainted with the necessary counter charms, ward off the danger, provided he immediately does what is necessary. There are eighteen different Pillis, of which Cumara Pilli is the most popular. We give below the names of these 18. They are as follows:\n\n1. Reeri Pilli\n2. Naga Pilli\n3. Cumara Pilli\n4. Coli Pilli\n5. Kan-ya Pilli\n6. Kana Mediri Pilli\n7. Garunda Pilli\n8. Curumini Pilli\n9. Mala Pilli\n10. Maha Sohon Pilli\n11. Oddi Pilli\n12. Debara Pilli\n13. Bambara Pilli\n14. Widiga Pilli\n15. Singha Pilli\n16. Gaja Pilli\n17. Gini Pilli\n18. Neecha Cula Pilli.\nIn each of these a particular demon is supposed to go to the intended victim, disguised in some particular form. In the first he is said to disguise himself as a fair looking young man; in the second, as a Cobra de Capello; in the third, as a boy; in the fourth, as a hen; in the fifth, as a little girl; in the sixth, as a firefly; in the seventh, as a peacock; in the eighth, as a beetle; in the ninth, as an old man; in the tenth, as a wild hog; in the eleventh, as an old woman; in the twelfth, as a hornet; in the thirteenth, as a bee; in the fourteenth, as a Malabar man; in the fifteenth, as a lion; in the sixteenth, as an elephant; in the seventeenth, as a ball of fire; and in the eighteenth, as a dog.\n\nSoon after the approach of the demon, the man is said suddenly to drop down dead, or to vomit blood first and die immediately afterwards. In some Pillis the demon uses violence, and either stabs the man, or strangles him to death. In the preparation of Cumara Pilli, the corpse of a male infant, the firstborn of his mother, is essential. This is first submitted to a sort of embalming process, and then having been dried by the heat of a fire made with sandal and Ras Pengiri wood, is locked up in a box made of Cohomba or Banyan wood, and placed in some spot unfrequented by women, so as to be safe from the pollution of Kili or Uncleanliness.* At the Jeewama, two knives are placed in its right and left hands, and the charm is then pronounced over it, during the three Yamas of a Sunday, on a grave not more than three days old. Of course, offerings are made to the demons, as usual. It is supposed that\n\n* The Uncleanliness, or as it is called in Singhalese Kili, is a sort of imaginary pollution anxiously avoided in every thing relating to Demon Worship. The principal occasions or causes of uncleanness are the death of a human being, the menstrual discharge in women, the flesh of certain animals such as pigs, peacocks, monkeys, and the fishes Magura and Ingura, and the birth of a child. In the case of death, the uncleanness is supposed to last for three months together; and it extends its mysterious influence not only in and near the dead body or the house where the man died, but to a distance of \"seven gardens\" [about a \u00bc or \u00bd of a mile] from that house. The uncleanness arising from death is the most malignant, and is supposed to come upon a person, even when he passes by the house of a deceased person. The principal consequence\ndemons then come in great numbers to the scene, endeavouring in every possible manner to frighten away the men, who however take care before the commencement of the ceremony to fortify themselves by charms and other amulets against these attacks. When the charm is perfected, the mummy becomes animated, and stands up. Then, certain other charms being pronounced over it, the name of the intended victim written on an ola is tied round its neck or its wrist; it then flies through the air like lightning to the man, who is to be destroyed. If the latter happen to be himself a man well learned in charms of this description, and if he recognize the disguised demon instantly, he will be able by means of certain other charms to send back the demon, who, when so sent, will and must kill the person, who first roused him at the Jeewama, no charm nor amulet of any kind being of any avail against him on this occasion. But if the former fail to pronounce his charm, either from not knowing one, or through fright, or from not suspecting a Pilli demon in the animal before him, it will be all over with him in a short time, no charms or any other demon ceremonies whatever helping him in the least, after the Pilli has once taken effect, that effect being generally immediate death.\n\nIf you ask a Cattadiya or any other Singhalese, who is at all conversant with these matters, whether these Pilli charms are actually put in practice now, and whether they are really followed by the wonderful results ascribed to them, he will first consider you, if a Singhalese, to be a fellow spoiled by contamination with Englishmen or by your English education, and then tell you that\n\nof exposing oneself to the influence of this Uncleanliness, is sickness, and in the case of a man, who is already suffering from some sickness, the consequence will be to aggravate the disease. A man bitten by a mad dog, if exposed accidentally to this influence within three months, is supposed to get hydrophobia, and die most miserably. Hence this Uncleanliness is greatly dreaded by the people, and none but the very nearest relatives will enter the garden of a house in which a person has died, the more distant relatives remaining outside the garden fence.\nat present the science is on the decline, that now there are few or none skilful enough to be able to perform those charms without danger to themselves, and that therefore instances of Pilli charms successfully performed in these degenerate days, are not so general as those of Hooniyan charms, but that the science itself is as true, as that Buddha was the greatest being that ever was born in the world. He will confirm this statement by regaling you with a hundred anecdotes, how such and such a Pilli had succeeded at such and such a place, with all the interesting particulars connected with them. If you shew any symptoms of scepticism about the accuracy of his marvellous accounts, he will endeavour to remove all your doubts and scruples, by giving you the benefit of his own experience of a certain Pilli charm, which actually killed, or was very nearly killing, an acquaintance or relative of his.\n\nThe following is an anecdote of this kind, which we give in the words of the narrator:\n\n\"Well, Sir,\" said he, \"you must freely pardon me, when I tell you that young men\u2014I beg your pardon again and again, Sir, for saying so\u2014know very little about these matters. You think\u2014pray, don't be angry with me for saying so\u2014that all that is great and wonderful is peculiar to the European. You have been taught to read English books and to imbibe from them notions, which militate both against the faith of our forefathers, and against the illustrious sciences they cultivated. This unnatural conduct has in some instances been pursued so far, as even to make some of our young men cut their hair and put on trowsers. Long hair and the Condey,* which have so long been the pride and honourable badges of our nation, are now despised by some of these young men, as if they were marks of degradation. Instead of combs, they now wear English Piriwehi\u2020 on their heads. But alas! there is\n\n* Condey is the hair tied up into a knot behind the head.\n\u2020 Piriwehi is a basket made of cocoanut leaflets for some temporary purpose, and it is sometimes used derisively as a contemptuous nickname for a cap or hat.\nno help, no remedy for all this. Well, Sir, you speak of the omnipotence of English science as being able to send news by an iron rod thousands of miles in a few minutes, to make carriages loaded with 70 or 100 cart-loads of goods move at the rate of 30 or 40 miles an hour merely by the agency of fire and smoke, without the help of bullocks or horses. You speak of English medicine as being superior to our medicine. But do you know, Sir, that none of these sciences or arts originally belonged to the Englishman himself. They all belonged formerly to Brahmins, and the English or some other Europeans have somehow or other met with their books; and, because they are men of sense and thought, they have been able to apply the rules laid down in those books to something practical, by which they may advance their interests. The Brahmins may not perhaps have those books with them now; but even if they have, they neither possess the opportunities, nor the means, nor even the energy and grasp of mind, necessary to derive any practical benefit from them, like the English.\" He went on in this manner for a full hour, and then continued, \"To remove then every doubt from your mind respecting Pilli, I will tell you what happened once under my own eye. One day about 25 years ago, my eldest brother had a quarrel about some charm-books with a native of the Matura district, who was then a guest at the house of a neighbour. Of course, after the quarrel, which was confined only to words, we thought no more of it. About 12 o'clock the following night, there came into the Verandah of my brother's house, where I happened to be that night, a hen with a large brood of chickens. I was awake, though my brother was fast asleep. Of course to my mind there was nothing extraordinary in the matter, but the next moment my brother awoke, exclaiming in a very loud voice 'Chee! Chee!,' and then told me in* a harried manner to bring him a few grains of rice. Though I was surprised both by his exclamation and by his excited manner, I obeyed and immedi-\n\n* Chee is an Interjection expressive of disgust or contempt, and is nearly equivalent to the English Pshaw.\nately brought him a handful of rice from a Chatty* in the kitchen opposite, wondering all the while what my brother was going to do. He took the rice into his hand, and muttering a charm over it threw it to the hen, which during this time, which was not more than 4 or 5 minutes altogether, was moving round and round my brother's bed. The hen first fluttered its wings, and then very quickly picked up the grains and went away, all the while croaking and cackling in a peculiar way. My brother then shewed me a small piece of flesh looking like the heart of a fowl, still dripping with blood, which, he said, fell on his breast and roused him from sleep; this was the Coli Pilli (No. 4 in the list); and he congratulated himself on his narrow escape, and on his success in turning back the Pilli to the very man, who had sent it to him. Well, Sir, the next morning we heard that the Matura man had died during the night, \"Well, now, what say you to that?\" Knowing very well that the greatest miracle, that could be performed in these modern times, would be to convince by reasoning an uneducated old Singhalese of the absurdity of any of his opinions, we contented ourselves with quietly remarking, \"that it appeared to us, that, without the agency of a Pilli or any other charm, it was quite possible that a hen and its chickens should come into an open Verandah, also carrying with it a piece of flesh picked up somewhere; that it was equally possible that the hen should, while moving about the bed, drop the piece of flesh on the man sleeping on it; and that it was not at all miraculous that a neighbour, with whom your brother may have had a quarrel lately, should die by some natural means the same night.\" On this, the old man looked daggers at us, but suppressing his rage he replied, \"but I was wide awake, and saw the hen from the first moment she came into the Verandah to the moment of her leaving it, and during all that time I did not see her getting on the bed or dropping a piece of flesh on my brother's person.\" \"Could not the hen have come\n\n* Chatty is the name given to any earthen vessel of a moderate size used as cooking utensil.\ninto the Verandah,\" said we, \"sometime before you awoke, and have left the flesh on your brother's person without either of you being aware of it at the time; and could not the hen then have returned to the Verandah a second time, the time that you say you saw her coming in.\" \"Nonsense, that was not possible,\" said he, \"for the moment the piece of flesh fell on my brother's person, he called out, as I said before; and it was the fall of the lump of flesh that roused him. Sir, I am sorry you should thus cavil at things which our forefathers believed, and which we old folks have ourselves found to be as true now, as they were in the days of the Irshis.\" The old man seemed very excited, and the more untenable any of his arguments appeared even to himself, the more dogmatic and wrathful he got. When any of his statements or arguments appeared to admit of explanation on ordinary reasonable grounds, he was sure to oppose it by advancing a fact or two, for which, we are quite sure, he was more beholden to his imagination and invention than to his memory. This old man is a respectable man in his own way, has had all the advantages of education according to the native system, and is a type of a large class of the Singhalese. What those say or think, who are still less enlightened, and who have not had the same \"advantages of education,\" the reader may easily imagine.\n\nDuring a previous part of our conversation on the same subject, he told us another anecdote of the same kind, which he had heard from a \"trustworthy\" person. \"Some 25 or 30 years ago,\" said he, \"there was a man named Abileenu, a boutique-keeper in the town of Kandy. Among other things exposed for sale in his boutique, there were some green Aanamalu plantains.* Another man named Bayi Appoo came to this boutique one day, and wish-\n\n* Aanamalu is a kind of plantain very common in Ceylon; the fruit is longer than in any other species, and is used by the Singhalese in curries. All other kinds of plantain, when quite ripe, acquire a reddish colour, especially in their outer coverings, but Aanamalu alone always retains, even when ripe, the same green colour, that it had before it had become ripe.\ning to buy some of the plantains enquired their price; on being told that eight were sold for a pice,* he offered to buy twelve for a pice, which so irritated Abileenu, that he abused the other in very indecent language, using among other expressions this\u2014\"send your mother to me with a bag to fetch plantains at twelve for a pice.\" Well, Bayi Appoo, who had only done what any other man would have done when he wanted to buy any article from a boutique, was very much provoked by this language, which he had not deserved; therefore when he heard the expression \"Send your mother to me with a bag to fetch plantains at twelve for a pice,\" he rushed towards the other intending to box his ears, but suddenly checking himself he replied \"very well, then I will send her to you to-night,\" and he went away. That night about 12 o'clock there came to Abileenu's boutique an old gray-haired woman. How she got in after the doors had been fast locked, was more than Abileenu's people could say. But there she was, sitting on a bag and looking steadfastly with glowing fiery eyes at the sleeping Abileenu. In a very short time Abileenu was heard to utter a loud, shrill scream, and the next morning after daylight when the other people of the boutique looked at Abileenu, they found him a cold corpse. One of these boutique people himself told me all this.\"\n\nAbout eight years ago, the death of a young woman from the bite of a Cobra in a village not far from Caltura was attributed to a Pilli; to prove that it was so, her relatives argued that, although death may follow the bite of a Cobra without there being any Pilli in the matter, yet in this particular instance the snake, which could have bitten many other people who were more in its way, purposely avoided them all; and that, although many attempted to drive it away from the neighbourhood of the house, yet it did not only not leave the premises, but ran through the midst of the other people, until it approached the young woman, and fastened its fatal fangs in her.\n\n* A pice is three-eighths of a penny.\nSome five or six years ago, a man was killed by a wild hog, while he was sitting near his own door in a distant part of Hewagam Corle; and because this happened in broad daylight at his own house, it was attributed to a Pilli caused by an enemy with the assistance of some Cattadiya.\n\n**Jeewang, Bandena, and Dehena Charms.**\n\n*Jeewang* is the name of a particular class of charms, whose object is to \"bind\" any demon in a certain manner to the will of a man, so as to make him an obedient slave to the latter, whether he wishes him to inflict sickness or to perform ordinary domestic work. In all other charms a demon has only to execute a particular duty on one particular occasion or during a certain length of time, and, when that is done, he is free; but in Jeewang Charms the demon becomes a perpetual slave, and ceases to be a free agent, as far as the man, who has bound him, is concerned. The following are the names of a few of these charms:\n\n1. Aacora Jeewama  \n2. Mohanee Jeewama  \n3. Irala Jeewama  \n4. Oddiya Jeewama  \n5. Bahirawa Jeewama  \n6. Saraspatoo Jeewama  \n7. Aananda Bahirawa Jeewama  \n8. Maha Bahirawa Jeewama  \n9. Pathracali Jeewama  \n10. Hanuma Jeewama\n\nA demon, who is under the influence of these charms, is supposed to be always in the company of the man, never being able to leave him for a moment, or to disobey him in any thing, until the death of the latter dissolve the bond. He travels with the man, sits wherever he sits, waits near his bed when he sleeps, and is his constant companion. He does every thing his master commands, whether it be the infliction of death, or drawing water from wells, or repairing the garden fence, or removing heavy stones which had resisted the united exertions of hundreds of men, or felling large trees, or doing any thing else desired by his master. A man, who\nhas a demon under his control in this manner, is therefore supposed to be a dangerous neighbour, for his power is considered to be such, that, even when he speaks to or looks at another angrily, the latter is supposed to fall sick. Such a man is supposed to have a very disagreeable exterior, seldom combing his hair or washing his person, and looking generally sulky and stern; ungracious in his manner, soon put out of temper, and avoiding pork and other things considered to be unclean. He is also scrupulous in avoiding houses or other places contaminated by any Uncleaness.\n\nThis sort of close connection with a demon is however considered to be very dangerous, in as much as the demon, though paying an unwilling and forced obedience to the man, is yet always watching for an opportunity of destroying him, and of obtaining his own release. Such opportunities, it is said, he will easily meet with, unless the man be always on his guard, by fortifying himself with those means of defence which other charms afford, and by living agreeably to certain rules laid down for those who retain demons in their service. Hence these charms are never tried in these days, although many men in bye-gone times are said to have used them successfully. If you challenge a Singhalese to prove any of the absurd things he so confidently relates, and which, if true, must from their very nature be susceptible of proof, he will always appeal to the experience of the past ages, and declare that, 30 or 40 years ago, there were many men well skilled in these difficult and important classes of charms.\n\nIn the second class of charms, namely those intended to cure diseases, or to secure one from falling sick from the influence of demons and charms, there is a great variety, of which the principal are Bandena and Dehena. Bandena is a term, which simply means \"binding\" or a \"bond,\" and although many of the Hooniyan and other charms are also sometimes called by the same name, yet it properly belongs only to those, by which diseases brought on by demons are cured. The number of these charms is very great, and we give below the names of a few:\u2014\nblows in this case, being but an ordinary man and not a Capua, and no charms or invocations being made to any demons or gods for assistance, the marks of the blows might or might not remain, without in either case compromising the correctness of the doctrine.\n\nThe following is the charm Kattu Mundiram used by the Annevy in the exorcism of demons.\n\n\"Oh God! May my head, neck, and throat be under the protection of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost! May they be under the protection of the powerful Commander, the Archangel St. Michael and his sword! May my right shoulder be under the protection of the Archangel Gabriel and his sword! May my left shoulder be under the protection of the Archangel Raphael and his sword! May my breast and back be under the protection of all the Saints! May my navel be under the protection of the twelve Apostles! May my private parts be under the protection of the 11,000 virgins! May my feet, legs, the soles of my feet, and the 20 fingers and toes with their nails be under the protection of all the Saints! I have taken God to be my protection. I have brought the Ten Commandments to my mind. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who sit on a throne of glory resplendent with the effulgence of starry gems, in the Holy Name of the Divine Mother, who obeys the Divine Will, I expel all inimical demons, who come from the East, the West, the North, and the South; demons who come from hell beneath the earth, from the five points of the sky, and the sixteen points of the world. I bind all poisonous creatures, be they beasts, birds, or fishes; be they those, that creep upon their bellies, or that move on their legs, or that fly through the air by their wings. I bind elephants, horses, bears, lions, tigers, and all other animals, that may be dangerous. I bind all these, so that Angam, Pilli, Hooniyan, the dangers of passing over, and all the demons, preteyas, and the diseases caused by these, may break, break, flee, flee,* and be expelled again and\n\n* Repetition of the same word, especially words like those in the text, is a very common practice in charms, because such repetition is supposed to increase the force and efficacy of a charm.\nagain. I bind by the divine power of the Cross. I bind by the power of the five divine wounds. I bind by the authority of the Angels. I bind so as to render the bond indissoluble. By the divine power of the Cross. Amen, Jesu.\"\n\nThis remarkable phenomenon in the conduct of thousands of Singhalese women throughout the Island can not, we believe, be wholly explained away by the supposition, that all these women are only humbugging every body by shamming madness, merely for the unreasonable pleasure of putting themselves in a state of frantic excitement or of assumed insensibility; an explanation the more unsatisfactory, when it is considered that this peculiarity is often found even in respectable old ladies verging upon 60 and 70\u2014mothers of large families\u2014very respectable, sober, honest, modest characters\u2014who, so far from wishing to simulate madness or demon possession, have always appeared to be quite incapable of such wilful folly. Further, we have often had ample opportunities of minutely observing every thing said and done by one or two such persons when under \"possession,\" and although on such occasions we were very anxious to convince all around us that all this was nothing but shamming, or at best the effects of an excited and morbid imagination, we yet never failed to perceive much, that could not be reconciled with any idea of imposture, and however much we endeavoured to believe in their being counterfeit, we never succeeded in fully convincing our reason.\n\nWe must however state here in justice to these old ladies, that their symptoms of possession were not exactly like those we have generally described above; they did not call upon demons, nor shout and cry, but simply sank down on the ground as in a fit of insensibility, and then continued, now and then, to tremble very violently, gnashing their teeth and rolling their eyeballs. In this state they generally remain about three quarters of an hour, and then sit up as if awaking from a sleep. For nearly a day after this they complain of weakness, and after that are as well as ever and about their household duties as usual. In other respects they\ndo not seem to be suffering from any disease, but on the contrary are in the enjoyment of good health.\n\nMany of the so-called demon possessions are without doubt mere shams, grown perhaps fashionable among a certain class of ignorant coquettish young women; but some, forming of course a small minority, do not, we are inclined to believe, admit of this explanation, if we can place any reliance on our own senses and judgment. Whether or not real demon possessions, such as those mentioned in the New Testament, do take place in these days too, we do not know; but if, as we think, they do not, this remarkable phenomenon can be explained only by attributing it to involuntary Mesmerism and what has been called the Cataleptic trance. But the wonder is that it should be so frequent and common in this Island, in so much as to exceed in the number of occasions and the number of persons affected, all the demoniac possessions or what were so called, which have ever been recorded as having occurred in all other parts of the world put together, from the beginning of the Christian era down to this day. We do not know what are the causes which induce the mesmeric state in a person; but if an excited imagination, overwrought feelings of superstitious fear, and an intense fervid belief in the existence and the attributes of demons, combined with very weak, credulous, timid minds, can do it, then all these may be found in a high degree in a large majority of Singhalese females.\n\nHowever, whatever may be the cause, whether it be mesmeric agency, or mere shamming, still the fact is remarkable in either case. For, if Mesmerism or the Cataleptic trance, be the cause, why or how it should be found in such active operation in so many instances in this Island during every year, would be an interesting subject of inquiry, nor on the other hand can the other imputed cause (if cause it be in all those instances), viz., a morbid propensity, which leads women to counterfeit demon possession, appear to be a matter less remarkable, in as much as it shews the low state of education which exists among the Singhalese.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nDreadful Consequences of a Belief in Demon Influence.\n\nThe reader, who has had the patience to follow us thus far, will, we believe, have his mind impressed with one principal idea, viz., that credulity and superstitious fear exercise so powerful an influence over an uneducated Singhalese, as to blind his reason entirely, the moment his mind reverts to demons or to anything relating to them. Without such an hypothesis, it is difficult to believe that there are men now living, who honestly and sincerely say and believe that they have actually seen demons, and have thereby fallen sick, from which they recovered only by the aid of charms and demon-ceremonies, and that by similar means it is in the power of any man at any time to inflict disease or death or some other misfortune on another. The account we have given of these spells, and of the wonderful virtues believed by the Singhalese to be inherent in them will, we believe, only raise a smile of contempt and pity in an Englishman's face; but if the Englishman knew to what deplorable results this belief often leads, his look of contempt would be changed to one of horror.\n\nIn many of the inland villages of this Island factions, quarrels, bloodshed, and crime have often been the consequences of this belief in charms, especially in Hooniyan charms. One family living at bitter enmity with another, with all their respective relatives and friends ranged on either side and each trying to injure the other in every possible way, by perjury, litigation, theft, and assault, turning peaceful villages into scenes of misery, and harmless peasants into ruthless murderers, and thereby perpetuating the feud from one generation to another, are not things of rare occurrence; and all this, either because a young man of one family happened on one occasion to prepare Hooniyan charms against a young woman of another family, because he could not get her to marry him; or because a man fell sick soon after an unfriendly neighbour had been seen to bury a charmed image under his garden gate, or\nfor some other similar reason. Among many instances of this kind which have come under our own notice, we will give here one or two for the benefit of the reader, from which it will appear that, if the power and influence of demons are to be perceived anywhere in these Hooniyan matters, it must be in the miseries brought on many an honest and happy family by their credulity.\n\nIn the district of Caltura in the Western Province of the Island, there lived some years ago a man, we will call Hendrick Appoo, with his family consisting of his wife, three sons, and one daughter. The sons were grown up men, married and having children. The daughter was the youngest and still unmarried. Hendrick Appoo was considered by his fellow villagers to be a rich man, that is, he had some 15 or 20 head of cattle, and about 6 or 7 acres of land scattered here and there in the village in small pieces of a rood or two each; and he had too his own paddyfield and sweet potatoe and betel plantations with 50 or 60 cocoanut trees and 7 or 8 jack trees: it was also supposed that he had in cash about 2 or 3 hundred Rixdollars (\u00a315 or \u00a322 10s.) His father had been a Widhane Aratchy, and so he was a village aristocrat. In short, he was a \"Country gentleman.\" He had a neighbour we shall call Harmanis Appoo, also well thought of by his neighbours as a man well to do in the world. This man had only two children, both unmarried, young men of good character. As he and Hendrick Appoo were men in the same rank of life, and especially as they both happened to be nearly equal to each other in the respectability of their pedigrees (an essential point in the matrimonial arrangements of the Singhalese,) it was proposed and agreed between them that the eldest son of the one should marry the daughter of the other. The proposal met with the approbation of nearly all the members of both the families; and so both the families became very friendly and attached to each other, assisting each other in various small matters, and in short living on the most intimate and happy terms with each other, as is usual on the proposal, and before the consummation, of a marriage between any two families. Of course the two young persons, who were most interested in the matter,\nwere not consulted, for they had no consent to give or withhold; such things being always managed for them by their parents. But sometime afterwards Aberan Appoo, a maternal uncle of the girl, and a man who was most scrupulously punctilious in matters of family pedigrees, returned from Saffragam where he had been trading for 4 or 5 months, and now for the first time hearing of the intended marriage determined to frustrate it, because he found a flaw in the pedigree of Harmanis Appoo, viz., that the father of his grandmother had been married to the descendant of a bastard slave. This in Aberan Appoo's opinion was an insuperable obstacle to the marriage, and so he set himself to work upon the family pride of his brother-in-law and his sister, in which he succeeded so well, that the match was soon broken off, and all intercourse between the two families ceased. Harmanis Appoo taking this as a mortal and unpardonable affront resolved to have his revenge. So he went to a Cattadiya in the Southern Province, and got him to prepare a Hooniyan charm against the young woman, and returning home, quietly waited for the result, of which he had not the slightest doubt. Curiously enough, just two months after this, the young woman died from the effects of a fever, which she had contracted through exposure to bad weather. Old Harmanis chuckling at this and too vain to hold his tongue confided to one or two of his confidential friends, how he had taken his revenge on Hendrick. Hendrick himself had heard before this of the other's visit to the Southern Province, but had never learned the purpose of the journey. As usual with prudent parents especially when a marriage proposal breaks off, he had taken every possible precaution, by means of charms and other amulets, to secure his daughter from the dangers arising from Hooniyan and other demon-influences; but when he heard, the day after the funeral of his child, of what Harmanis had been boasting privately to his friends, it confirmed him in his previous suspicions, and roused all the evil nature in him. These suspicions were still further confirmed by the discovery of a small wooden image buried under one of the front steps of his Verandah. So, a few days afterwards, he and his three sons\nwith two others, hired with drams of arrack for the occasion, quietly repaired in the dark to Harmanis' house, and severely assaulted him, his wife, his sons, and all others who were in his house. The next day they went before a Magistrate and swore an affidavit, that he (Hendrick Appoo) and his sons, while returning home one night from Morottoo with a large sum of money, had been waylaid by Harmanis Appoo and his sons with 5 or 6 other men, who assaulted them and robbed them of their money. Harmanis also swore an affidavit, stating in it the actual truth, with the addition of a robbery and burglary committed on his property. Each was supported by false evidence, and both the complaints having been investigated by the Magistrate, both were dismissed by him, as neither appeared to him to be true. A few weeks after this, Harmanis with a party of his friends repaired to his enemy's house, and assaulted him and all his people with clubs, knives and rice-pounders (long wooden pestles), and many on both sides were severely wounded. The matter was tried before the Supreme Court, but the jury acquitted the accused. Then for a period of nearly four years the two families were engaged in a series of civil lawsuits arising out of certain bonds, in all of which judgment was given against Hendrick\u2014bonds, which came into existence only after the rupture between the two families, Hendrick having never borrowed a farthing from the other on a bond or without a bond. And yet the deeds purported to have been duly executed before a notary! Before execution was granted in the last of these cases, the two sons of Harmanis were found one evening lying dead in a neighbouring rice field, with marks of violence on them: and although every possible exertion was made by those in authority to discover the murderers, no trace of truthful evidence could be had, and although a dozen relatives of the deceased swore to its being the work of Hendrick's sons, there did not appear any trustworthy evidence whatever against any one. The case was however tried upon the evidence of these relatives, but the jury at once acquitted the prisoners, Hendrick himself and his sons. In a few weeks afterwards every thing belonging to Hendrick was sold by\nthe Fiscal to satisfy the execution in the civil suits mentioned above, and as there still remained a large balance due, Hendrick was incarcerated in a debtor's prison. Harmanis lost both his sons, and got a considerable sum of money recovered upon his bonds, but did not live long enough to enjoy it, as in about a year's time he was poisoned, and died a miserable death. The suspected culprits were not brought to punishment, as there was not a tittle of legal evidence against them. Thus these two families, who had lived comfortably and respectably in their quiet village for a long time, were ruined; and other villagers, who had taken part in their quarrels, did not fare better. Certainly a Hooniyan Charm, viewed in this light, must appear to be a thing of greater malignity, than the Cattadiya and his books represent it to be in its direct consequences.\n\nThe following case is not less characteristic. It happened in a village not very far from Colombo. Andris had a lawsuit with Siman Nydey respecting a small piece of land, not worth more than \u00a32 or \u00a33, and judgment was pronounced in favour of Siman. Andris, resolving upon revenge, had recourse to witchcraft, and a Hooniyan being prepared, the image was buried at night in the yard of Siman Nydey's house, opposite to the front door. Unfortunately for Andris, he was detected in the very act, and was seized by the inmates of the house, who headed by Siman, joined in giving him a good thrashing. Not content however with this they cut off a bunch of plantains from a tree close by, and placed it beside Andris, who lay on the ground, bound hand and foot and smarting from the blows he had received. The Police Widhane was then sent for, and on his arrival Siman charged Andris with intruding into his dwelling garden at night and stealing plantains from it. All Singhalese know well that Englishmen never punish people for practising Hooniyan or any other sort of witchcraft, and hence this fictitious charge of theft. The Magistrate tried the case, and the man being found guilty was sentenced to a month's imprisonment with hard labour. Before he could return home from the jail, his enemy Siman, wishing to pay him in kind, consulted a Cattadiya,\nand got a Hooniyan ceremony performed against him. On his return from the jail, the first thing Andris heard was a rumour of Siman's having been seen going one night towards a graveyard in company with another man, who carried with him a cock concealed under his Sarou cloth, together with some live coals in a broken chatty. Of course Andris immediately understood what it meant, and perhaps thinking within himself that \"the best of all charms is a club-charm\" (a popular Singhalese saying), the next evening about the time that Siman, who was a toddy drawer, generally returned home after drawing Toddy in the neighbouring hamlet, he shouldered his Mamottie (Anglice hoe) and walked along the path, by which he knew the other would come. When he saw Siman approach, he concealed himself behind a bush, and, as he passed, with a single blow of the Mamottie, struck him to the ground. The unfortunate man's skull was completely fractured, and he lived only 3 days. Andris was tried before the Supreme Court, and being found guilty, expiated his crime on the gallows. Even after this the two families had many quarrels and lawsuits, but none productive of consequences so serious.\n\nA young man, who was a \"rising\" astrologer, fell sick, and his physicians did all they could for him, but without any effect. Day by day he grew worse, and was fast approaching his last end. From the first, the illness was attributed to demon influence, and nothing, that charms and Cattadiyas and Balicarayas and Buddhist Priests and Capuas could do, was left untried. The patient however grew no better, and at last he died. The suddenness of the disease, and the speedy death it resulted in, were matters of suspicion even in the minds of the neighbours, and much more certainly in that of the father of the deceased. The old man suspected another astrologer, who lived in the same village, of having practised Hooniyan Charms against his son, and all doubt was removed from his mind, when he heard a few days afterwards that a certain Cattadiya, who lived in a distant village, was seen, some three or four months before, going to the house of the astrologer late in the evening, and in such a manner as if he wished to go unseen. Whe-\nther this was true or a mere invention of some unprincipled vil-\nlager, the old man did not care to enquire, he was but too ready to\nbelieve what he had all along strongly suspected. When he heard\nit, he was maddened with anger. He could not bear the idea of his\nbeloved son being snatched away from him by foul play. He had\ntaken great pains and had been put to considerable expense in train-\ning his favorite son to the profession of an astrologer, and to be thus\nsuddenly disappointed, just as he was about to reap the reward of\nall his labours in the fame and glory of his son, was past all human\nendurance, especially the endurance of our old carpenter, who sel-\ndom raised his chisel or his adze without consulting an astrologer\nfor an auspicious hour. The old man burning with rage and resent-\nment, resolved to have his revenge. He had a neighbour who,\nbeing something of a sportsman, had a gun. He had also a mango\ntree in his compound, the fruit of which was every day devoured\nby monkeys, so he asked his neighbour for the loan of his gun to\ndrive off these troublesome robbers. Every day, when monkeys\nwere seen on or near his mango tree, he took out the gun, loaded it\ncarefully, and first levelling it at the intruding monkeys, turned\nand fired it in a different direction; for it was a great sin to kill\nanimals, especially monkeys. Besides, he was an Upasakaya.*\n\n* An Upasakaya is a religious Buddhist, or at least one who professes to be\nso, by the observance of certain precepts of Buddha called Sil or Seela. These\nprecepts or obligations are.\n\n1. Do not take away life.\n2. Do not take that which is not given.\n3. Do not commit adultery.\n4. Do not speak that which is not true.\n5. Do not use intoxicating liquors.\n6. Do not use solid food after mid-day.\n7. Do not attend at dancing, singing, music, and masquerades.\n8. Do not adorn the body with flowers, perfumes, or unguents.\n9. Do not use seats above the prescribed height.\n10. Do not receive gold or silver.\n\nOf these the first five, called Pan Sil or Pancha Seela, are considered to be ob-\nligatory on all. These five with the next three, forming eight Obligations, are\ncalled Ata Sil. One professing to observe these eight is called an Upasakaya.\nSo this sort of shooting at monkeys continued for three or four weeks. One evening, as the astrologer was returning home from another village, and was moving along a footpath flanked on both sides by thick bushes, he was shot by somebody concealed among the bushes and lived only a few hours. The Jury, who tried the old carpenter, at once acquitted him, as, although there was as usual a good deal of false evidence put in, which from its nature was not, and could not be, believed, there was not a tittle of trustworthy evidence against him, excepting the mere fact of his having had at his house a gun borrowed from a neighbour to shoot monkeys. But all the villagers knew to a certainty that the old man was the murderer.\n\nInstances like the above can be multiplied by hundreds, if necessary; but the few already cited will, we think, be sufficient to give the reader some idea of the nature of the evils, which a belief in the power of charms often produces among our countrymen; a belief, which is not confined to those, whom we are in the habit of styling common people, but which prevails equally, though with less serious consequences, among Singhalese of a higher class and condition, with the exception of a very few well educated intelligent people, not exceeding, we firmly believe, four or five hundred individuals in the whole island.\n\nThere is a peculiarity, very general among the Singhalese, that if an European questions a Cattadiya about any particular department of his art, he will give just such answers, as he thinks will be most in accordance with the opinions of the querist, as far as it can be done without wholly condemning the entire system; but whenever there appears to be no chance of avoiding this last dilemma, he will make every possible excuse to make a hasty retreat, without entangling himself in the difficulties of a discussion, in which he knows he will not be able to triumph. If an Englishman tells an advocate of Demonism that charms and Demon Ceremonies are mere follies; that no benefit whatever can be derived from them; that they are mere impostures intended to delude the ignorant; and that the most learned Cattadiya cannot satisfactorily prove that they\npossess any of the powers ascribed to them; the answer most probably will be\u2014\"Sir, I don't know much about these things myself; my forefathers have believed in them, my neighbours still do so, and what is good for them cannot, I think, do any harm to myself. Possibly much of what you say may be true, and certainly a great deal of what now goes under the name of charms is spurious, and many of the Cattadiyas are ignorant impostures. Really, Sir, I don't understand these things well, but there may be some, who can perhaps satisfy you on the subject, though I cannot.\" Or he will say\u2014\"Sir, I don't know whether these things be true or false. When we fall sick, we try every means within our reach of getting better. We worship Buddha, the gods, and the demons, all at once, to take our chance of recovering from the sickness through the help of some of them. All my countrymen do so, and I am only doing like them.\" The demeanour of the man during this conversation is like that of one, who has been convinced of the absurdity of his worship, and who is anxious to profit by the advice of a superior, although he evinces considerable impatience at being stopped, and is anxious to get away as soon as possible. The moment he turns his back however, he will go away laughing at his own skill in answering so well and cursing, or at least pitying the Englishman for being an infidel and a Christian. Hence many an Englishman is led to believe that Demon Worship has not at present a firm hold of the minds of a portion of the people, and that it is upheld amongst a few merely because custom, or habit has made it familiar to them. Nothing can be more erroneous than this opinion; for so far from a portion of the people being indifferent to Demon Worship from a conviction that it is an absurdity, we believe there is not (excepting 4 or 5 hundred well educated men in the whole Island) one Singhalese man, who believes in anything more firmly than in Demonism. In Colombo and its immediate neighbourhood alone, where the superstition does not command many zealous votaries, there are some few who have no great faith in charms, or who, though believing in them, have no opportunity of reducing that belief into practice in the form of Demon cere-\nmonies; but in all other parts of the Island, Demonism exercises a more commanding influence over the every day life and thoughts of a Singhalese, than any other *ism* that we know of.\nTHE FIRST DISCOURSE DELIVERED BY BUDDHA.\n\nTranslated by the late Rev. D. J. Gogerly, Chairman of the Wesleyan Mission in South Ceylon, and presented for publication by the Rev. R. S. Hardy, M. R. A. S.\n\nOn the birth of the prince Gotama, according to the native authorities, it was known to certain Brahmins, from the signs they saw upon his person, that he would become a supreme Buddha. They themselves were too aged to expect to live until the time when he would attain to this high position; but they instructed their sons to prepare for places of privilege under the new dispensation. Of these young Brahmins, only five were obedient to parental advice. They retired to the forest of Uruwela, to await the assumption of the Buddhahip by the prince. Not long after Gotama had renounced the allurements of the palace, they met with him in the place of his retreat, and remained with him six years, hoping continually that the time in which he was to practise austerities would cease. But when this period had passed over, and the prince, as he had done before, began to carry the alms-bowl as a mendicant, without attaining the object for which he had become an ascetic, their patience was exhausted, and they left him, retiring to the neighbourhood of Benares.\n\nIt was the wish of Gotama, on becoming Buddha, to say bana, or to preach, in the first instance, to Alara and Uddaka, two ascetics whom he had previously met with, whilst wandering in the forest; but when he learnt that they were already dead, he looked for the locality of the five Brahmins, and when he saw that they were near Benares, he repaired thither to open his commission as the all-wise teacher. They received him with reverence and worship. The preparations for this first sermon of the Tathagata\nare described in the most glowing terms. \"The evening\" says a Singhalese author, \"was like a lovely female; the stars were as pearls upon her neck, the blue clouds were her braided hair, and the expanse was her flowing robe. As a crown she had the heavens; the three worlds were as her body; her eyes were like the white lotus; and her voice was like the humming of the bee. To worship Buddha, and listen to the first proclaiming of the bana, this lovely female came.\" All the worlds in which there was sentient existence were emptied of their inhabitants, so that the congregation assembled was in number infinite; but when the god Sekra blew his shell, \"all became still, as a waveless sea.\" Each of the countless listeners thought that the sage was looking towards himself, and speaking to him in his own tongue, though the language he used was Magadhi. Then Buddha opened his mouth, and preached the Dhamma-Chakkappawattana-suttan. This sermon is of importance, not only as being the first preached by Buddha; but as containing the germ thoughts of his entire system.\n\nThe following translation of this Discourse has been found among the papers of the late Rev. D. J. Gogerly, both the Pali original and the English translation being in his own handwriting.\n\n\"Thus I heard. On a certain time Buddhu resided at Benares, the delight of holy men and safe retreat of animals. At that time Buddhu addressed himself to the 5 priests. O Priests, these two extremes should be avoided by a Priest, an attachment to sensual gratifications, which are mean, vile and contemptible, degrading and profitless; or severe penances, which produce sorrow, and are degrading and useless.\n\n\"O Priests, avoiding both these extremes, Buddhu has perceived a middle path for the attainment of mental vision, true knowledge, subdued passions, the perception of the paths leading to the Supreme good, the preparation necessary for attaining it, and the entrance to Nirvana.\n\n\"O Priests, which is this middle path?\n\n\"This path has 8 divisions:\u2014namely, correct doctrines, correct perceptions of those doctrines, speaking the truth, purity of conduct,\na sinless occupation, perseverance in duty, holy meditation, and mental tranquillity.\n\n\"This, O Priests, is the middle path, perceived by Buddh\u016b.\n\n\"This, O Priests, is the important doctrine respecting sorrow: there is sorrow in birth, in decay, in sickness, and in death, in separation from beloved objects, and in being compelled to remain with those which are disagreeable; there is sorrow in not obtaining the fulfilment of wishes, and, briefly, sorrow is connected with every mode of existence.\n\n\"This, O Priests, is the important doctrine respecting the continuation of sorrow: it is desire, which in transmigrations reveals in sensuality and seeks enjoyment in whatever state it may be placed; it is the desire of pleasure, of continued existence, and of annihilation after death.*\n\n\"This, O Priests, is the important doctrine respecting the destruction of sorrow: it is complete freedom from passion, an abandonment of sensual objects; a deliverance from the desire of a continuation of existence, a freedom from attachment to existing objects.\n\n\"This, O Priests, is the important doctrine relative to the path by which this state may be attained; this path has 8 divisions\u2014correct doctrines, a clear perception of their nature, inflexible veracity, purity of conduct, a sinless occupation, perseverance in duty, holy meditation, and mental tranquillity. Relative to the important doctrine of sorrow being connected with all things, I, O Priests, possess the eye to perceive this previously undiscovered truth, the knowledge of its nature, the understanding of its cause, the wisdom to guide in the path of tranquillity, and the light to dispel darkness from it.\n\n\"O Priests, it is necessary that I should clearly understand this previously undiscovered and important doctrine, relative to which I have the eye to perceive; the knowledge, &c.\n\nO Priests, this previously undiscovered doctrine that sorrow is\n\n* This passage stands as it is given in Mr. Gogerley's translation.\nnecessarily connected with existence is clearly understood by me, I having the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, relative to this before undiscovered doctrine of the cause of the continuance of sorrow, I have obtained the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, it is proper that I should remove from me the cause of the continuance of sorrow, relative to which previously undiscovered doctrine I have obtained the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, the cause of the continuance of sorrow no more exists in me, relative to which previously undiscovered doctrine I have obtained the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, relative to this formerly undiscovered doctrine of the destruction of sorrow, I have obtained the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, this formerly undiscovered doctrine should be fully ascertained by me, relative to which the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, this formerly undiscovered doctrine has been fully ascertained by me, relative to which the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, relative to this previously unknown doctrine respecting the path by which the destruction of sorrow may be attained, the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, it is proper that I should be accustomed to this path, concerning which the eye, &c.\n\nO Priests, I am accustomed to this path, &c.\n\nO Priests, was I not fully informed relative to these 4 doctrines which my wisdom thus perceived in 12 ways?\n\nAt that time, O Priests, did I not know that I had acquired the most complete and irrefutable wisdom possessible in the universe.\n\nFrom that time, O Priests, I have been fully informed relative to these 4 doctrines, which my wisdom has thus perceived in 12 ways.\n\nAt that time, O Priests, I know that I had acquired the most complete and irrefutable wisdom attainable in the universe.\n\nThis wisdom and knowledge have sprung up within me. My mental deliverance is permanent. This is my last birth: I shall transmigrate no longer\nBudhu having spoken thus, the delighted priests were exceedingly gratified with the discourse.\n\nWhen these doctrines had been thus luminously displayed, the venerable Kondanya becoming free from pollution, obtained the eye of wisdom, and a complete deliverance from the cause by which sorrow is continued.\n\nWhen Budhu had thus declared these leading truths, the Gods of all the heavenly worlds, to the extremity of the Brahma Lokas, were heard proclaiming\u2014Budhu has declared at Benares the irrefutable doctrines of truth, which could not be declared by Sage, or Brahmin, or God, or by Maraya, or by any person in the worlds (the names of the principal gods in each world being mentioned.)\n\nThus at the same moment the sound ascended to the Brahma Lokas.\n\nThus the foundations of 10,000 worlds were shaken and moved about tumultuously, and a great and brilliant light burnt upon the worlds.\n\nThen Budhu with a mellifluous voice said, most certainly the venerable Kondanya has acquired an experimental knowledge of these truths.\n\nThus he received the names of Annya Kondanya.\nPOOTTOOR WELL.*\n\nIt having been deemed desirable to investigate certain phenomena in connection with this well, the following experiments were made. This paper will contain no attempts to explain these phenomena, or to suggest any theory as a basis for discussion. Simply narrating facts, I leave it for others to determine the cause of the following effects.\n\nAs a guide however, I will venture to give an outline description of the Peninsula of Jaffna in which this well is situated, and of the appearance of the well itself with some general remarks on peculiarities noticeable in most of the wells of the Jaffna Peninsula.\n\nThe Jaffna Peninsula would appear to have been a comparatively recent formation and principally formed by gradual coral deposits. There would however seem to have been at some period or other, a volcanic agency which has upheaved strata of an earlier period, as the surface of large tracts consists of magnesian limestone, in which (whether worn or otherwise I cannot say) exist numerous fissures affording easy passage for an abundant supply of fresh water, within a very few feet of the surface.\n\nThis Peninsula is so free from elevations of any kind that the highest point found in its cross section was only 35 feet above low water level. Elevated ground is found at both sides near the sea, from which points the ground declines again leaving a table land almost entirely level 13 or 14 miles in extent, at an elevation above low water level of only 4 feet. This peculiarity during spring tides (of the North-east monsoon particularly) allows the sea to flow up numerous inlets, which seam the Peninsula in every direction and which rise during freshes to a height of 3 or 4 feet, and afford abundant opportunity for the manufacture of salt. It is worthy too of consideration in connection with the subject of the well, that, on subsiding, large deposits of naturally formed salt are left, which remain on the beds of the inlets throughout the year. Before leaving this subject, I might mention that the greatest width from north\n\n* I have been unable to find out the name of the author of this paper.\nto south of the Peninsula is 20 miles, and its greatest length from east to west 30 miles.\n\nThe wells of Jaffna are subject to certain peculiarities. Their general level appears to be affected by the state of the tides, not however to such an extent as to cause a diurnal action. It is however a well known fact that during the north-east monsoon the wells of the district rise to their greatest height, and that height diminishes as the force of the monsoon decreases. The large mass of water in the Bay of Bengal affected by this monsoon causes the level of the Jaffna lake to be affected to the extent of 18 inches increase of tide, at the same time that the above-mentioned rise in the wells occurs. Another fact is, that cultivators in digging irrigation wells are obliged to observe the greatest possible caution, as after passing a certain depth the water becomes brackish, and this peculiarity exists throughout the Peninsula. Again it is equally curious to observe how closely fresh and salt water flow together without amalgamating. Whilst building a causeway at Vannatipalam across the salt inlet, in this Poottoor district, the foundations were laid in salt water, but close to this and in the centre of the inlet fresh water could be obtained in several places and in large quantities, although during freshes those spots are covered with 3 or 4 feet of salt water. These facts may prove of interest and of some use in considering any theory which may be based upon the results of the experiments, hereafter to be narrated.\n\nThe Poottoor well itself is a large rectangular pit in the limestone rock, and its dimensions are about 40 feet in length by 25 in width. A slope down to the water level has been made, as is common to all the artificial tanks of Ceylon and India. Tradition connects it with some springs on the Coast near Tondamanaar, but it is only tradition as it would be simply impossible to trace the course or source of any springs in so level a country. The only previous experiments made were in 1824, when engines of considerable power were employed, to raise water from the well, with a view of irrigating the district. The only result obtained however was the\nestablishment of the fact that it was impossible to affect the level of the well or to check the curious rise and fall of its water. This latter phenomenon has earned for it the title of the \"Tidal Well of Poottoor.\"\n\nI think I have now mentioned all the facts I am aware of, which might assist any one in forming an opinion as to the cause of the peculiarities of this well. These peculiarities are three in number.\n\nFirst in importance is the tide above mentioned.\n\nSecondly, the presence of salt water from a depth of between 45 and 50 feet to the bottom of the well, &c.\n\nThirdly, its apparent inexhaustibility. The experiments just completed were undertaken with reference to the two first conditions only, the experiments of 1824 being considered conclusive as to the third.\n\nExperiments.\n\nThe first step taken was, by a careful section taken from the low water mark on the southern to the low water mark on the northern shore, to ascertain the relation that the level of the surface water of the well bore to the tidal marks of the sea on both shores. Levels were taken for a distance of 17 miles from Jaffna on the south coast to Valvettitorre on the northern coast.\n\nThe fact so established is, that the level of the fresh water in the well coincides almost exactly with the low water level of the sea on both coasts.\n\nThe next experiment was conducted with a view of ascertaining at what depths the fresh water ceased and salt water commenced, and to procure specimens of the water at various depths to be sent to England for analysis. An instrument with a closely fitting valve was made for this purpose, so arranged that the valve could be opened and closed again at any given depth.\n\nThe first symptom of brackishness was found between 40 and 50 ft. down, and it appears certain that it is at this point that the salt water enters. Specimens of the water at the surface, 45 ft., 95 ft., 145 ft. (the bottom) were procured and put into sealed bottles.\nThe water from the bottom when first brought up, smelt strongly of sulphureted hydrogen.\n\nThe surface of the fresh water is 14 feet below the ground line, and the total depth of the well varies between 140 and 145 feet.\n\nDr. Ferguson of the Army Medical Staff kindly assisted me in making these experiments.\n\nIt being desirable to ascertain how far the tide in the well coincided with that of the sea on both coasts, Dr. Ferguson and myself at the well and two assistants at Jaffna and Valvettytorre respectively, took notes at every half hour from 6 A.M., till 6 P.M.\n\nThe following is a tabular statement shewing the rise and fall of the tide observed at all three places in inches.\n\n| Time   | Jaffna Lake | Well at Poottoor | Valvettytorre |\n|--------|-------------|------------------|---------------|\n| 6 A.M. | .0          | .0               | .0            |\n| 6:30   | Fell .60    | Fell .12         | Fell .36      |\n| 7:0    | .60         | .06              | .60           |\n| 7:30   | .84         | .06              | .84           |\n| 8:0    | .96         | .06              | 2:04          |\n| 8:30   | 1:08        | .06              | 2:64          |\n| 9:0    | 1:32        | .06              | 3:12          |\n| 9:30   | 1:44        | Rose .03         | 2:40          |\n| 10:0   | 1:08        | .15              | 2:40          |\n| 10:30  | 1:08        | .12              | 2:40          |\n| 11:0   | 1:20        | .12              | .96           |\n| 11:30  | .72         | .12              | .48           |\n| 12:0   | .84         | .18              | Stationary    |\n| 12:30 P.M. | .84     | .06              | .48           |\n| 1:0    | .60         | .06              | .48           |\n| 1:30   | .60         | .06              | .96           |\n| 2:0    | .12         | Fell .15         | .96           |\n| 2:30   | Rose .24    | .18              | 1:92          |\n| 3:0    | .48         | .18              | 3:28          |\n| 3:30   | .96         | .12              | 1:68          |\n| 4:0    | 1:56        | .12              | 1:20          |\n| 4:30   | 1:08        | .12              | 1:92          |\n| 5:0    | .72         | .12              | 1:44          |\n| 5:30   | 1:08        | .12              | .24           |\n| 6:0    | 1:20        | .48              | .24           |\nBy the foregoing table it will be observed that the well alternated 3 times during the day, whilst the sea was not affected to a similar extent.\u2014The well also rose whilst the sea fell, and this part alone destroys all hypotheses that I have as yet heard discussed.\n\nThe subject therefore remains in an unexplained state and offers a field for scientific enquiry and discussion.\nOn the air breathing Fish of Ceylon\u2014By The Revd.\n\nPRINCIPAL BOAKE.\n\nHaving been recently induced to make some experiments on the respiration of certain species of fish, in order to ascertain the correctness of a statement of mine which had been communicated to Professor Huxley by Sir Emerson Tennent, I am under the impression that an account of those experiments with a description of the habits of the fish in question, will come within the scope of the Asiatic Society's operations, and may perhaps be deemed by the Committee to possess sufficient interest to entitle a paper on the subject to admission into its Journal.\n\nDuring my residence in England in 1855\u20141856, I became acquainted with the facilities which recent discoveries, or, to speak more accurately, the ingenious application of old discoveries to the construction and management of aquaria had afforded to those who wished to observe the habits and natural history of the various tribes of aquatic animals. Knowing that very little attention had been paid to that branch of natural history in Ceylon, I lost no time, on my return to the Island, in establishing a fresh water aquarium; and, in watching the proceedings of its inhabitants, my attention was very soon attracted to a peculiar habit which some of them had, of ascending at nearly regular intervals to the surface, so as to bring the mouth for an instant in contact with the air. That habit is particularly conspicuous in the fry of two species, viz., the Loolla and the Maddecariya, which speedily cover the surface of the water in which they are confined, with small bubbles of air or gas. I noticed also that the species of fish, to which that habit belonged, were much less sensitive to any impurity in the water in which they were confined than were those which did not pay periodic visits to the surface. Had I been a practised natura-\nlist these circumstances would probably have led to my discovering at that time the fact that the fish, in which they were observed, are air breathers, and as incapable of supporting life by breathing water, and as liable to be drowned by being kept from access to atmospheric air, as the whale or the seal or the turtle; but, not being much accustomed to such investigations, I failed to perceive the conclusion to which these habits obviously pointed. About the same time, I learned from the natives, that there were certain species of fish, generally inhabiting swamps and paddy fields, which, when dry weather deprived their usual haunts of all their moisture, were in the habit of burying themselves in large numbers in the mud, and remaining there in safety even after a sod had been formed by the growth of grass on the surface.\n\nWith the intention of verifying that statement, I caused a very large earthen vessel to be made, which I nearly filled with mud, leaving a few inches of water on the surface. In this I placed a number of those species of fish which were stated to bury themselves in the manner described, expecting that they would act in the same manner in captivity as they were said to do in their natural state. It is obvious however, that the conditions were not similar\u2014The evaporation in my experiment was confined to the surface, whereas in a paddy field the moisture may be supposed to escape in all directions and not from the surface only. Again, in the paddy field, grass would begin to spring up while the surface was still covered with water, and before the strictly aquatic vegetation had disappeared; and a constant influence would thus be exercised in keeping the water first, and the mud afterwards, free from putrefaction. It is not to be wondered at therefore that all the specimens of fish which I subjected to that experiment died long before a sod was formed on the surface of the mud; but they survived for several days after the water had all disappeared from the surface by evaporation, and continued to manifest so much vigour as to bespatter, in a very unpleasant manner, any person who approached them incautiously. The result of that experiment was, therefore, merely to confirm what was already known to naturalists,\nviz., that the fish experimented upon, were possessed of respiratory powers which enabled them to exist in mud so thick that it would be impossible for it to pass through their gills, and that they are capable under such circumstances of breathing atmospheric air, which they obtain by elevating their mouths to the surface.\n\nFor some years, I paid no further attention to the subject; but happening, in a correspondence with Dr. Templeton, to mention the alleged fact of these fish burying themselves in the mud in large numbers, I was requested by him to make further inquiries on the subject, the result of which was, that all the natives of the low country, with whom I communicated on the subject, confirmed the statement; while a friend, whom I requested to make similar inquiries in the neighbourhood of Badulla, was not able to discover that the natives of that district were acquainted with any such peculiarity of the fish inhabiting their paddy fields.\n\nI have not, however, been able satisfactorily to verify the statement that they are ever found in dry earth, although I have repeatedly offered a reward to any one who will let me see the operation of digging fish out of such earth; and the result of a visit which I paid to Moottoo Rajawelle, during the dry weather, when the swamp was in a favourable state for it, in August last, had the effect of making me suspect the truth of the statement, that they are ever so found. The difficulty which I experienced on that, which was my second visit to Moottoo Rajawelle, in procuring any satisfactory information, affords a curious illustration of the suspicious character of the Native Singhalese, and of the difficulties which it presents to the satisfactory prosecution of any investigation, the nature and objects of which are not easily made intelligible to them. My former inquiries, which were made more than twelve months before (of which an account is given below), were recollected, and as the inhabitants of the swamp were incapable of conceiving the possibility of my being actuated by purely scientific motives, they came to the conclusion that I had been deputed by Government to inquire into the value of their fishery, with the intention of imposing a tax upon it; and the consequence was, that instead of being allowed\nthe same facility of observation as in my former visit, I was taken to a part of the swamp which had been fished a few days before, and in which, consequently, only one or two very small fishes were taken while I was present. My first visit to Moottoo Rajawelle was paid in April 1862, and was much more satisfactory in its results.\n\nThe swamp of Moottoo Rajawelle is not less, I imagine, than 30 square miles in extent; being, as well as one can judge by the eye, fully ten miles long, by three broad. The Negombo Canal runs through it, and must contribute in some degree to keep the water in the swamp at a more nearly uniform level than would otherwise be the case; but, notwithstanding any influence of that kind which may be exercised by the canal, there are, I believe, very considerable variations in the height of the water at different seasons. At the time of my first visit, very little water was visible in the swamp, nearly all the surface being covered with rank grass, which had formed a nearly continuous sod over it. Beneath that superficial sod were about two feet of water, or rather of diluted mud, about the consistency of thick Pea Soup, and beneath that again, a solid vegetable deposit very much resembling that which is used as fuel in Ireland under the name of turf. I was at first unable to account for the water being so muddy, as it might be expected that in water, so perfectly still as to have a sod growing over its surface, the earthy particles would soon subside and leave the water clear. The phenomenon is, I believe, to be accounted for by the large number of Hoongas and Magooras which inhabit it, which by the perpetual motion of their ribbonlike bodies keep the mud in constant agitation. So perceptible was this effect in the case of some which I had in confinement, that I found it necessary, in order to maintain the clearness of my aquarium, to exclude them from it altogether. The sod, with which the muddy water was covered, was firm enough to support the weight of natives, several of whom were engaged in cutting the long grass for their cattle, while on some of the firmer parts bullocks were to be seen grazing. Thus the singular phenomenon was exhibited of an extensive plain, on the\nsurface of which men and cattle were moving about, while beneath\nthe surface were quantities of fish, several of which I saw captured.\n\nThe mode in which the natives catch those fish is very peculiar,\nand is in fact an ingenious application of their knowledge of the\nfact, that they cannot long exist without atmospheric air.\n\nWhen the swamp is in a proper state for such operations, i.e.,\nwhen the water is neither too high nor too low, and the surface is\ncovered, as I have described, with a firm sod having two or three\nfeet of diluted mud beneath it, a native goes out at night, when the\nair is still, and walking through the swamp, listens for the peculiar\nsounds which the fish make in breathing. Having selected a part\nin which those sounds are heard so frequently as to afford a pros-\npect of catching a considerable number, he proceeds to remove the\nsod from a few circular patches, each about three feet in diameter,\nin those places, in which there already exist small holes in the sod,\nwhich the fish frequent for the purpose of breathing. When that\nis done, he returns home for the night. I did not think it necessary\nto be present at the nocturnal part of the operations; but I accom-\npanied the fisherman the following morning to the spot which he\nhad prepared during the previous night; and I found it a most\nlaborious effort to make my way over the treacherous surface, al-\nthough the natives appeared to traverse it without any difficulty.\nWhen we reached the fishing ground, operations were commenced\nby making a kind of enclosure, to cut off from the rest of the swamp\nthat portion in which the circular patches had been cleared of sod\nthe night before. This was done by breaking the sod in a narrow\nline encompassing the space which it was intended to enclose, and\ntrampling a portion of it down to the more solid mud at the bot-\ntom. The long grass, which is thus carried down, makes a kind\nof fence, which is supposed to confine the fish; but which one can\nhardly suppose to be very efficacious, as they would have but little\ndifficulty, if so inclined, in making their way through it. When\nthis is done the diluted mud in the holes that have been opened\nover night is thickened by mixing it with some of the more solid\nmud, or peat, scooped up from beneath. Some of the long grass which grows on the surface is then laid over the thickened mud in two strata, the stalks of which the one is composed being at right angles with those composing the other. The whole is finished off with a coating of mud. Nothing then remains to be done, but to watch for the appearance of fish. The first indication of their presence is the rising of bubbles of air; and in each instance when these bubbles appeared, the natives, who were standing by, named correctly the species of fish by which they were emitted, being guided probably by their size, and by their coming up singly or in larger numbers. After a bubble of air has appeared, but a short time elapses before the head of a fish appears protruding above the surface of the mud. There is no difficulty in securing a fish when he shows himself in this way, as the blades of grass, which have been arranged so as to cross each other beneath the surface of the mud, form a net through which he cannot readily force his way back.\n\nI remained watching the process for about an hour, during which I saw eleven fish taken, and the natives told me, that, as the day advanced, larger fish would be caught, and in greater numbers. None of those that I saw taken were large. They were of three species\u2014Connia (Ophio-cephalus) Magoora and Hoonga (Siluroids.)\n\nIt is obvious that this mode of catching the fish is entirely based upon the fact that they cannot breathe water, but are forced to ascend at stated intervals to the surface, to breathe atmospheric air\u2014a fact which after I had verified it by drowning two or three specimens by inverting a net over them, I communicated to Sir Emerson Tennent, who in his reply forwarded to me a copy of a letter from Professor Huxley, which contains the following passage. \"Your correspondent's experiments on the respiration of the fish are most interesting, and I trust he will continue them. It would be a great fact should he establish the point he seems to be aiming at, viz., that these fish habitually breathe air rather than water.\" I had already fully satisfied myself of the fact of which Mr. Huxley\nhere speaks; but, in order to put the matter beyond doubt, I repeated my experiments on a larger scale, in the presence of several gentlemen who were so kind as to assist me, some of whom favoured me with suggestions which enabled me to make my experiments more satisfactory, by varying the manner in which they were made.\n\nThe first set of experiments was made in the presence of C. P. Layard, Esq., and G. Molesworth, Esq. On that occasion the fish experimented on were enclosed in glass receivers, which were submerged in larger vessels containing other fish, which had free access to the air. From some of the receivers, the fish inclosed in which were so large as not to be able to make their escape through the aperture, the stoppers were removed, so as to allow a free communication between the water inside the receiver and that outside. In others, in which smaller fish were inclosed, the stoppers were replaced, as soon as the air had been allowed to escape but, were from time to time moved up and down, so as to promote the circulation of the water between the receivers and the aquarium in which they were placed. The fish confined in these receivers were of five different species, viz., Maddhacariya, Loolla, Talcaddia, Kawaya, Hoonga. Messrs. Layard and Molesworth remained for about an hour and a half to watch the experiment. During that time two Loollas and two Talcaddias were drowned, one Talcaddia survived after having been kept from the air for 50 minutes; and a Maddhacariya, which had been confined for more than an hour, when an attempt was made to remove it, revived immediately on obtaining access to the air, and swam off so vigorously that it was impossible to distinguish it from other fish of the same species which were in the aquarium. When Messrs. Layard and Molesworth went away, there still remained two receivers with fish in them, which continued to shew signs of life. One contained a Kawaya, the other a Hoonga. These were left unobserved for about two hours, when they were removed quite dead. In some of the receivers several Tittiyas (water breathing fish,) were confined, along with the air-breathers, and did not appear to have suffered in the least, when their companions were removed dead.\nThe second set of experiments was tried in the presence of the Revd. G. Schrader, Revd. W. F. Kelly, and W. J. Sendall Esq., Mr. Molesworth having suggested that the death of some of the fish formerly experimented on, might have been accelerated by the alarm experienced by them on finding themselves confined in so small space as that of a glass receiver, it was determined to attempt to keep the fish from access to the air, in this second set of experiments, by means of diaphragms fastened a couple of inches beneath the surface.\n\nTwo vessels were employed. One was the bell glass of a hanging lamp. In it were two Connias and two Loolas (both air breathers,) and about fifteen or twenty Tittyas (water breathers). These fish had been in the bell glass for some days; but were evidently too much crowded, as the Tittyas, although the water was frequently changed, were constantly at the surface breathing air, as such fish will do when the water becomes impure. The diaphragm in this case was a circular piece of tin, perforated with small holes. The other vessel was a tank or aquarium of the following dimensions, viz. 36 x 16 x 12 inches. In it were a considerable number of fish, both air-breathers and water-breathers. A diaphragm of Mosquitos net was stretched across it, about two inches below the surface, by means of pieces of rattan. These arrangements having been made, the fish were left undisturbed for upwards of an hour. On their being examined at the end of that time, all the air breathers in the bell glass were found dead; but so also were about one half of the water-breathers, whose death was probably attributable to the fouling of the water, the volume of which was not sufficient for the support of so many fish, especially when they were cut off from all communication with the air.\n\nIn the larger vessel, the diaphragm was found to be imperfect; several of the fish, both air-breathers and water-breathers, had made their way into the space above it, and it is probable that some of those which were found below it, when the vessel was examined, had, during the course of the experiment, passed repeat-\nedly backwards and forwards between the space above and that below the diaphragm. Two, however, were quite dead, a Loolls and a Maddbacariya, both air-breathers. None of the water breathers in this vessel had died.\n\nThese experiments not being satisfactory, in consequence of the imperfection of the apparatus, it was determined to repeat them, with a more perfect diaphragm, and a quantity of fish better proportioned to the volume of water in which they were confined.\n\nThe diaphragm was extended about six inches below the surface dividing the aquarium into two compartments, in the lower of which were confined specimens of Maddhacariya, Hoonga, Magoora, Connia, Loola, Kawaya, and Poolootta, all air-breathers, together with six Ancoottas, water-breathers. In the upper compartment, separated from those below only by a diaphragm of mosquito net, were placed Maddhacariyas, Kawayas, Hoongas, Conniyas, and Ankootas. In this compartment there were also aquatic weeds, and a siphon was kept running for the greater part of the day, so as to change the whole body of water frequently while the experiment was going on. The diaphragm was fastened in its place about 11\u00bd A.M., in presence of Mr. Layard. Very soon after the fish in the lower compartment were cut off from communication with the air, they began to emit bubbles of gas, and it was remarkable, that, while the air bubbles which were carried down through the mosquito net along with the fresh water from the siphon, made their escape at once back to the surface, the bubbles of gas emitted by the fish were detained by the net, shewing that the air had undergone a considerable change while detained in their systems.\n\nNotwithstanding the pains which were taken to secure the diaphragm, one of the Pooloottas, and one or two of the Conniyas contrived to escape into the upper compartment; the remaining Pooloottas, after having been confined for about three hours, began to manifest great uneasiness, and contrived by a desperate effort to force himself through a hole in the net, which did not appear to be large enough to allow a fish of one quarter of his size to escape.\n\nThe diaphragm was removed at 6\u00bd P.M., in presence of Messrs.\nLayard and Molesworth. All the fish in the upper compartment were alive and healthy, as were also the six Ancoottas in the lower compartment. Two small Hoongas likewise appeared vigorous; and a large Hoonga which was nearly exhausted, revived immediately on obtaining access to the air. All the K\u00e1wayyas, twelve in number, were dead, also six Maddhacariyas, three Magoras, one Loola, and one Cooniya, being the whole number of each of those species that had been confined beneath the diaphragm.\n\nThe different degrees of tenacity of life which were manifested, in the course of this experiment, by the different species, and by different individuals of the same species, were very remarkable. Contrary to my expectation, the first fish that succumbed was a K\u00e1wayyah, (Anabas) which turned over on its side at half-past twelve, about an hour, or an hour and a quarter after the commencement of the experiment. At a quarter to one, several K\u00e1wayyas were on their sides, while a Loola, which, from the result of former experiments, I had expected to die first, continued in its ordinary position, and apparently alive. At three o'clock, two of the K\u00e1wayyas were still alive, while all the rest had turned over on their sides nearly an hour before. I attribute the great length of time required on this occasion to kill the fish, as compared with the result of former experiments, partly to the greater volume of water contained in the aquarium, and partly to a constant stream of fresh water being allowed to fall into it during the earlier part of the experiment, which carried with it minute globules of air. That stream was, however, discontinued about two o'clock, as it seemed that the Ankoottas did not require it.\n\nThe struggles of all the air breathing fishes, and especially of the K\u00e1wayyas, to get up to the surface were very violent; and their breathing through their gills became after some time very laborious. This was the more remarkable, because these fish, when they have access to the surface, are remarkable for keeping their gill-covers perfectly motionless. This was especially observable in the Hoongas, which survived the longest; and I infer, that, although none of these fish can live long, when prevented from rising to the sur-\nface, yet their gills are so constructed as to enable them to extract some oxygen from the water, and thus to prolong their existence, although not a sufficient supply to enable them to dispense altogether with access to the atmospheric air.\n\nNotwithstanding the success of the experiment just described, there were two species of fish, which, from their habits, I believed to be air-breathers, but which I had not succeeded in drowning. To complete the investigation, therefore, I enclosed, on a subsequent day, two Poolloottas, two large and two small Hoongas, and two Ankoottas, in receivers, from which all communication with the air was cut off. The Ankoottas, being water breathing fish, were included for the purpose of proving that the others died solely in consequence of their exclusion from the air. Both the Poolloottas died in less than a quarter of an hour. The larger Hoongas died in about four hours. The smaller Hoongas were alive at the end of six hours, when it was thought necessary to remove the dead fish, during which operation the surviving Hoongas had an opportunity of obtaining a fresh supply of air. They were then enclosed again, along with the Ankoottas, and at the end of seven hours were found quite dead, the Ankoottas, which were confined along with them, being alive and apparently vigorous.\n\nI think I have thus established, with regard to eight species of fish, inhabiting the marshes of Ceylon, what Professor Huxley states would be a great fact, if established, viz., that they habitually breathe air, and are incapable of surviving, for any length of time, if excluded from it; and I have the pleasure of presenting you with specimens, for your Museum, of those species which have been actually drowned in the manner described.\n\nThe delay, which has occurred in the publication of the Society's Journal, enables me to add the following extract from a paper which I drew up some time ago, giving an account of a singular circumstance, which I have ascertained since the previous part of this communication was written, in the natural history of another species of fish, a water-breather, and, I believe, a Siluroid.\n\n\"Having occasion to visit Caltura periodically, I was told, on one of\nmy visits, of a fish which is caught at certain seasons in very large quantities, and which has the singular habit, when held up by the tail, of emitting from the mouth a quantity of eggs. So great is the number thus emitted, that, when many fish are captured, the eggs are eagerly collected from the bottoms of the boats, and carried away to be fried, and are greatly relished by the villagers when so prepared, while the fish themselves, being too numerous to be consumed in their fresh state, are salted and dried, and often form an ingredient in the curries which appear at our tables.\"\n\n\"The description, which I received of the manner in which the eggs are procured, seemed to point to the conclusion, universally believed by the natives, that the regular mode of bringing forth their young is, in the case of these fish, through the mouth; a fact which seemed to me to be so singular, that I determined to stay a day or two longer at Caltura, when I next visited it, for the purpose of investigating the circumstances which seemed to indicate so singular a conclusion.\"\n\n\"The result of my investigation was, as might have been expected, that I ascertained, that the circumstances had not been fully or accurately observed, and consequently that the conclusion, to which they pointed, was erroneous; but I, at the same time, satisfied myself of a fact in the natural history of those fish, which will perhaps be regarded as but little less extraordinary, than their novel mode of parturition would have been, if it had been established as true; and which, as Ceylon has acquired some notoriety for marvellous stories respecting its Zoology, I should feel some hesitation in stating, were it not, that, in addition to the abundance of unexceptionable testimony, I was able to procure specimens illustrating the whole extraordinary process.\"\n\n\"These fish produce their eggs, in the first instance, very much in the same manner as other inhabitants of the waters do, with this exception, that the eggs seem to come to maturity in batches of ten or twelve. Bottle No. 1 will illustrate this. It contains the roe of one out of a large number of fish that I examined. You will perceive that, besides eight or ten large eggs, there is a whitish\nmass, which, on being closely examined, will be found to consist of other eggs of very minute size, the difference in size between those which are ready for emission, and the others which are immature, being very remarkable. The strange fact, however, is that the large eggs, on being emitted, are immediately taken up, either by the fish that has laid them, or by another of the same species, and, not swallowed, but kept in the mouth, until they are hatched, and the fry are able to take care of themselves, a period of some weeks, during which it is impossible that the fish, which is swimming about with so extraordinary a mouthful, can swallow any food, except such small nutritious particles as may be floating about in the water. When these fish first make their appearance at Caltura, in the beginning of the season, they are said to be so fat, that the curry made with them resembles that made with pork; but after swimming about for a few days, with their mouths full of eggs, they become dry and insipid. In bottle No. 2, you will see thirteen eggs, which I shook out with my own hands from the mouth of a fish of eight or nine inches long, each egg being about the size of a small grape. Preserved in that manner, viz., in Glycerine, the eggs retain their natural colour and transparency, whereas in spirit they soon become opaque. In the same bottle are some other eggs, which were obtained by pressure, and which present the same remarkable difference in size as those in No. 1. You will perceive that these latter are perfectly transparent, the smaller ones being scarcely visible, whereas those which were shaken out of the mouth of the fish contain a perfectly formed embryo, and have a system of blood-vessels spreading over their surface on one side. In bottle No. 3, you will see one of the eggs in a more advanced stage of development. Both the head and tail of the embryo have escaped from the egg, which, very little diminished in size, remains appended to the middle of the fish, giving it a very distorted appearance.\"\n\n\"This adherence of the egg to the young fish, after it has been hatched, is not peculiar to this species. The same thing occurs in the case of the Salmon fry, which are being produced, under the\nauspices of Mr. Buckland and other eminent pisciculturists, in such quantities as to give us some grounds for hoping that that delicious fish may become again so common in the rivers of England, that it shall no longer be a luxury accessible only to the wealthy, and that farm-labourers may again, as is said to have been formerly the case in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, find it necessary to stipulate, in their engagements with their employers, that they shall not be fed on Salmon on more than two days in the week.\"\n\n\"This is the only specimen I was able to procure in that stage of development, the time not having then arrived for the general hatching of the eggs; but an intelligent friend, who is at Caltura at present, has promised to procure me other specimens, which will, I trust, enable me to ascertain a fact which I am inclined to believe, although I am not as yet prepared to assert it positively, namely, that the egg so appended is, in fact, the stomach of the animal in the state of enormous distention, and that, as its contents are absorbed, while the other parts of the fish grow in size, it gradually assumes a more natural proportion to the rest of the body.* To this conclusion I am led by observing the system of blood vessels, which is perceptible on the side of the egg opposite the embryo, and which certainly looks as if it was intended to form part of the organization of the future fish.\" I have since ascertained by the aid of Wm. Ondaatje, Esq., Asst. Col. Surgeon, that the fish which carry the eggs, and subsequently the young fry, for so long a time in their mouths, are all males.\n\nThe name, by which these fish are known to the natives, is Anguluwa. They are regarded by them as all belonging to the same species, nor would an unscientific observer be likely to discover any specific difference between any of the specimens that I have seen; but having sent several specimens to F. Layard, Esq., I received a letter from him, in August last, in which he informed me, that he had submitted the specimens which I sent him, to Dr. Gunther of the British Museum, who had ascertained that they\n\n* This has since been fully ascertained to be the fact.\nbelong to two distinct species, both new, of the genus *Arius*. Mr. Layard further tells me, that the carrying of the ova in the mouth is not so novel a phenomenon as I supposed it to be, Dr. Gunther having described that peculiarity in the propagation of the *Genus Arius*, several years ago, from S. American species.\nOn the 'Origin of the Sinhalese language.' Read before the Ceylon R. A. Society on the 31st October, 1863.\u2014By James Alwis, Esq., M. R. A. S.\n\nWhen twelve years ago I published the Sidatsangar\u00e0, and entered into an investigation of the question as to the origin of the Sinhala language, I intimated my belief,* that it belonged to the Arian or Northern family, as contradistinguished from the Dravidian, or the Southern class of languages. My sentiments on many a collateral subject have since undergone change. I have discovered errors upon several points on which I then wrote. I find I have assumed facts which have no foundation. I have drawn inferences which are untenable. But the main question, the belief of which I then expressed, has only received confirmatory proof in the course of my later researches; and they enable me, moreover, with due deference, but great confidence to disprove the statement in Sir Emerson Tennent's History of Ceylon,\u2014that 'the Sinhalese, as it is spoken at the present day, and still more strikingly as it exists as a written language in the literature of the Island, presents unequivocal proof of an affinity with the group of languages still in use in the Dakken;\u2014Tamil, Telingu and Malayalim.'\n\nSir Emerson Tennent was, probably, indebted for this information to Professor Lassen,\u2020 and he to Professor Rask of Copenhagen\u2014all of whom were not conversant with the Sinhalese.\u00a7\n\n* See Introd. to the Sidatsangar\u00e0, p. xlvi.\n\u2020 Sir Emerson Tennent's Ceylon, p. 328.\n\u2021 See his S. Ind. Alterthumsk, p. 363.\n\u00a7 Professor Bachtlingk, lays down as a philological axiom that \"it is dangerous to write of languages of which we do not possess the most accurate knowledge.\"\nWhen more than forty years ago Rask wrote, the greatest misapprehension prevailed amongst Europeans on all Oriental subjects. Eastern Languages were not extensively cultivated. A gloom enveloped the science of comparative philology. Inaccessible was the path to eastern history. Even the Sanskrit, the language in the highest state of cultivation now-a-days, was then but imperfectly known to the European world. Some considered it a derivative of the Zend, and others treated it as a creature of the P\u0101li. Little, if any thing, was definitely investigated of the latter. The relation which the Sanskrit bore to the Pr\u0101krit, was very imperfectly investigated; and was, at the time Wilson translated Vikrama and Urvasi, 'far from being understood'; and, when the labours of Lassen and Burnouf brought to light the Nepal books of Buddhism, even the names of their P\u0101li versions were unknown in Europe. The distinction between the Arian and the Dekhane groups of languages was not well ascertained. The Tamil was supposed to have been an off-shoot of the Sanskrit. The Andhra merely existed as a book name. Between it and the Dravida no relationship was established; much less was the identity of Dravida and Damila recognized. The Sinhalese was not known in Europe. Nor was it cultivated by the English in Ceylon until after the annexation of the Kandian Kingdom (in 1815) to the possessions of the British Government. Even then little was ascertained of the Sinhala by a careful inter-comparison of south-Indian dialects;\u2014less was known of the various modifications which the former had undergone;\u2014and least of all regarding its history for upwards of two-thousand years. True it is indeed that Mr. Chater published a Sinhalese grammar in 1815; yet this led to no important results in point of philological researches. The language adopted in it was the bastard Sinhalese of the fourteenth Century. It was the language of the paraphrases\u2014the Sanskrit, if I may so call it, Sinhalicised. When, therefore, Clough published his Dictionary fifteen years afterwards, he was led away with the belief\n\n* Speigel's Kammav\u0101ch\u0101.\u2014Intro: p. i.\nthat 'the Sinhala was derived from the Sanskrit.' He moreover perceived not the identity of the Elu with Sinhala; nor could he distinguish the P\u0101li forms in the ancient Sinhalese from the Sanskrit forms which predominated in our modern dialect. One would have supposed that the share he had had in the publication of the B\u0101lavat\u0101ra could not fail to enlighten him on the subject. But such, unfortunately, was not the case. He recognized 'the elements of two distinct dialects, in the national language of Ceylon. Ono he pronounced the Elu, and the other the Sinhala. The former he regarded as 'the remains of the language originally spoken, i.e. by the aboriginal inhabitants; and the latter, as the language introduced after the Vijayan conquest.*\n\nThe subsequent labours of the Rev. S. Lambrick (1834), as well as those of an anterior date (1821) of the Rev. John Callaway were of little avail. The Dictionary of the latter was intended for elementary schools. The Grammar of the former, by his adoption of the forms of language current amongst the vulgar, rendered but little assistance to the Philologer. His denial, moreover, of the existence of the passive voice, which he must have daily found in the Sinhalese Version of the Lord's prayer, only gave those who placed the Sinhalese in the South-Indian class an additional handle in support of their incorrect theory.\n\nHistory, too, was then in its infancy. Upham's works published in 1833 tended rather to mislead than to direct the European mind. No effort was made to set Sinhalese history in its true light until Turnour entered the field of Oriental literature. The commencement of true historic knowledge may be regarded from the date (1837), when he published the Mahavansa, and exhibited the value of the P\u0101li, not only in regard to chronological and historical researches, but also in point of philological investigations.\u2020\n\n* For explanation of the terms Elu and Sinhala see Sidatsangar\u0101 p. xxvii et seq.\n\n\u2020 The learned author of the Dravidian Comparative Grammar in fixing the date of Dravidian Civilization preparatory to an investigation into the origin of the Dravidian language, says: 'I am inclined to look to Ceylon for the best means of arriving at an approximate date,' p. 81.\nYet, it may be truly said that no one applied his energies to glean the information, which our historical works afforded to investigations connected with the language of the Sinhalese. Dr. Stevenson of Bombay has written several papers in the pages of the Bombay Asiatic Society's Journal; but they are by no means calculated to assist Philological investigations.* Even the Rev. Spence Hardy, with a very intimate acquaintance with the Sinhalese, could not trace the origin of that language.\u2020 Indeed in times later still (1858) when the Sidatsangar\u0101 appeared, I confess, I was not able, with all the assistance of European and Asiatic researches then at my command, definitely to state the origin of the Sinhalese.\u2021\n\nIt was upon the publication of that Sinhalese Grammar, however, that people, in later times, began to pay greater attention to a critical study of the Sinhala. Since then has appeared an invaluable auxiliary to the investigation in hand\u2014'The comparative Grammar of the Dravidian language by the Revd. R. Caldwell (1856). Since then too has arisen a greater thirst for a knowledge of the archaeology of Buddhism; and, what is inseparably connected with it, the P\u0101li language. These helps combined with the light which History has shed upon the subject, and the knowledge already possessed by them of the Sanskrit, have enabled the native pandits in our own island to investigate with success the origin of the Sinhala language: and those investigations establish, as I purpose to show in a paper which I shall hereafter present to this Society in continuation of these introductory remarks, a result, the very opposite of that which Sir Emerson Tennent states as being founded upon \"unequivocal testimony,\" or which Prof. Spiegel considers, is supported by certissimis testimoniis.\u00a7\n\nProfessor Lassen in his Indische allisthumus kunde, a work designed to be a critical digest of all the researches of the last\n\n* 'In many instances Dr. Stevenson's lexical analogies are illusory and disappear altogether on a little investigation.'

Their phonetic system is distinct, and so is the fundamental part of their vocabularies, embracing the words in most common use; and farther, what is decisive, their grammatical structure is peculiar. With this philological fact accord the traditions of the Dekkan, indicating, as they do, that the Dekkanese were originally in a rude state, and that settlers from the North brought to them their civilization. The traditions of the continent agree here with those of the island of Ceylon, and the phenomena of the religious and political state of the Dekkan, at the present time, establish the fact of its having received its civilization from that source. Its alphabets, also, came from the North. Yet, certain peculiarities are likewise found, which, not being referable to Arya teachers, must be considered as remains of usages properly belonging to the South-Country. Nor has the civilization brought from the North penetrated every where: many tribes are met with in the Dekkan, which have adopted only a part, sometimes more, and sometimes less, of the imported culture; one indeed, that of the Tud\u00e0 on the Nilgiri, had, until within a short time, received no such civilizing influence.'\n\nWith all the respect due to so distinguished an orientalist as Pr. Lassen, I cannot but regard his remarks, so far as they relate to the Sinhalese, as inapplicable, and therefore inconsiderate.\n\nIt is quite true that the Sanskrit element, by which I mean the use of sibilants, aspirates, double letters etc. in the modern Sinhalese, cannot be traced to our ancient dialect; and that these have been engrafted on the Sinhalese in comparatively modern times.\u2020\n\n\u2020 S. Ind.: Altenth. p. 363.\n\n\u2020 See the history of the Sinhalese language in my Introd: to the Sidat-sangar\u00e0 p. clxxxvii. ct seq.\nIn view of the particular affinity which the P\u00e2li and the Pr\u00e2krit dialects bear to the Sinhalese, and the historical conjectures as to the formation of the latter, it may also be affirmed that the Sinhalese is not a direct off-shoot of the Sanskrit. Yet, all this may be assented to without in the least affecting the proposition, that the Sinhalese belongs to the Northern division of languages, and cannot be classed amongst 'the languages of the Dekkan,' which, in accordance with the language of Mr. Caldwell, I shall in future designate the 'Dravidian.'\n\nIt may be here convenient to consider the historical before entering upon the philological questions, that relate to the subject. I believe it is a universally admitted fact, that before the Aryas or Sanskrit speaking people of Hindustan first emerged from obscurity, and settled themselves in upper India, the whole of the Peninsula from Cape Comorin to Himalaya, and also the Lank\u00e0 of the R\u00e0mayana, had been peopled in every direction by an entirely distinct race of people in different stages of civilization, whom they designated Daitya, Danav\u00e0, (Yakkhas or) R\u00e0kshas, and Mlichhas*. These were the Yakkhas or barbarians whom Vijaya found on his arrival in Lank\u00e0, and of whom the early Sanskrit and Bhuddhist writers speak with much aversion. This taken in connection with the fact that Demonolatry, or the worship of devils in Ceylon, is identical with 'the system which prevails in the forests and mountain fastnesses throughout the Dravidian territories and also in the extreme South of the Peninsula,'\u2020 leads to the inference, that the early settlers of Ceylon were a portion of the aboriginal inhabitants of India before its occupation by the Arya race. But it is also a fact, as I shall show hereafter, that they have neither retained their national character nor their national language.\n\n* Dr. Stevenson's Kalpa S\u00fbtra.\u2014p. 133.\n\u2020 Caldwell in his Dravidian Grammar says, 'This system was introduced within the historical period from the Tamil Country into Ceylon, where it is now mixed up with Buddhism.'\u2014p. 519.\nThe only tribes, however, that have not intermingled with the Sinhalese, and whose savage condition in modern times may be identified with the ancient barbarity of the yakkhas, are the Veddas; and these, be it remembered, are as distinct from the Sinhalese as are the Tamils of the North. There is also a distinctive class called the Rodiyas, and it is remarkable that their ranks were replenished from time to time with Sinhalese convicts of all castes from the Royal to the plebeian. Mr. Casie Chetty, the author of the Ceylon Gazetteer in giving a number of words in current use amongst the Rodiyas expresses a conjecture 'that they were either a colony of some of the wandering hordes from India, or a fragment of the aborigines of Ceylon itself' partially blended with the Sinhalese.'* This is very probable; and although we have not sufficient materials for comparison, yet the few words which have been collected of this dialect, containing the names for the common wants of mankind are, with six exceptions, different from 'the Sinhalese as it is spoken at the present day, and still more strikingly as it exists as a written language in the literature of the island.'\u2020\n\nThe mention of N\u00e0gas or N\u00e0gaworshippers, with whom the yakkhas had shared the kingdom of Lank\u00e0, does not lead to any certain results. For the N\u00e0ga worship had been diffused from a very early age throughout the whole of India\u2021 as well as in the north-west frontiers of the Arya-desha, as for instance, Kashmir.\u00a7\n\nThe worship of the N\u00e0gas, moreover, was confined to that portion of this island, once called the N\u00e0ga d\u00ecpa, 'the northern and north-western parts of Ceylon, where Tamilians commenced to form\n\n---\n\n* C.

For, to state a fact mentioned by himself, and known to us in Ceylon \u201cthe descendants of the Portuguese who settled in India several centuries ago, are now blacker than the Hind\u00fas themselves,\u201d p. 513. Regarding, therefore, \u201ccolour as a most deceptive evidence of relationship and race,\u201d [p. 515.] we may next direct attention to it in connection with a less fallible testimony, viz., \u201cthe shape of the head and the more permanent peculiarities of feature;\u201d (ib) and here I need not labour to prove that the Sinhalese present a wide difference from all the races of the Dekkan. For instance, the features of the Tamils of the Southern Peninsula are peculiar, and though the complexion of the Sinhalese presents different shapes, the \u2018copper colour\u2019 is that which prevails over the rest: and this again it would seem is the colour of the Arya race, so much honored by Manu (cap. iv. \u00a7 130) when he declared it an\n\n* Caldwell\u2019s Drav. Grammar, p. 4.\n\n\u2020 Caldwell says \u201cIt is undeniable that emigrations from Ceylon to the southern districts of India have occasionally taken place. The Teers (properly Tiv\u00e1r islanders) and the Ilavars, \u2018Sinhalese,\u2019 (from \u2018Ilam\u2019, Ceylos, a word which has been from the Sanscrit \u2018Simhalam\u2019 or rather from the P\u00e1li \u2018Sihalam\u2019 by the omission of the initial \u2018s\u2019) both of them Travancore castes, are certainly immigrants from Ceylon\u201d\u2014Caldwell\u2019s Com. Gr. p. 72.\ninsult to pass over 'even the shadow of a copper coloured man.' The colour as well as the features of the inhabitants of the Dekkan are certainly distinguishable from those of the Sinhalese even by a casual observer. An utter stranger to the various races cannot be three weeks in this Island before he perceives the striking difference between the manners and habits of the Sinhalese on the one hand, and those of the different other races on the other. European Teachers have frequently observed the facility with which the Sinhalese pronounce European tongues, presenting in this respect a quality distinguishable from every race of South-Indian people.\n\nIt may, however, be urged by those who advocate a contrary opinion that the use of long hair by the Sinhalese, a practice to which Agathemerus, a Greek Geographer of the third Century bore testimony,* is worthy of notice in an inquiry into the relations of the Sinhalese with the early Dravidians. It is true enough that the usage referred to is equally characteristic of the Dravidian race.\u2020 But I submit that we have no undoubted testimony of the same usage not having existed in the Northern territories from whence Ceylon was peopled. On the contrary, the fact of S\u00e0gara's having imposed 'shaving the hair' as a punishment on the Yavanas implies that it had been previously customary to use the hair long: and it is also not a little remarkable that Gotama Buddha a North-Indian is represented, like Siri Sanghabodhi, one of our kings,\u2021 to have worn tresses and a top-knot. But even supposing that such was not the case, and that the practice of twisting the hair into a knot at the back of the head is identical with that of the Dravidian race; and that, as stated by Mr. Caldwell, 'it was from Dravidian settlers in Ceylon that the\n\n* 'The natives cherish their hair as women among us and twist it round their heads.'\n\n\u2020 \"Up to the present day the custom of wearing the hair long, and twisted into a knot at the back of the head is characteristic of all the inferior castes in the southern Provinces of the Tamil Country\"\u2014Caldwell's Grammar p. 75.\n\n\u2021 See Attanagalwansa Cap. i \u00a7 ii.\nSinhalese adopted the same usage' (p. 75); it may still be affirmed that there is nothing in this circumstance which militates against our position.\n\nHistorically Professor Lassen himself furnishes us with an item of proof which I shall here notice. He says 'whenever an original language has been retained, as among the Gondas, the Kandas and the Padarias, there is nothing of the civilization of the Aryas, or merely a sprinkling of it; but wherever, on the other hand, Arya civilization has penetrated and prevailed, as among the Kolas of Guzerat and others, the language of the Arya has also come into use.' Applying this test to Ceylon and its language, I perceive the result to be in direct opposition to the opinion of Mr. Lassen to which I first attracted attention. For, to suppose that Ceylon retained its aboriginal language even after the Vijayan conquest is to affirm that the Sinhalese received not even a \"sprinkling\" of the Arya civilization; which is not the case, the fact being, that far from its being 'a mere sprinkling' Ceylon has enjoyed from the very settlement of Vijaya a greater share of civilization than any other Country in the Dekkan, or in the fastnesses of the Vindhya.\n\nNor is Sir Emerson Tennent of a different opinion, for he distinctly says \"To the great dynasty (of Vijaya) and more especially to its earliest members the inhabitants of Ceylon were indebted for the first rudiments of civilization, for the arts of agricultural life, for an organized Government, and for a system of national worship.\" (Vol. I p. 360.)\n\nThis being established, the converse of the proposition laid down by Professor Lassen holds good, viz\u2014that 'with the civilization of the Arya invaders the aborigines adopted their dialect.'\n\nHistory also shows that the new colonists retained a distinct and separate character; and that although intermarriages might have taken place between the Yakkhas and the new settlers;* yet that the\n\n---\n\n* The only mention however of this in the Mahawansa has reference to Vijaya; and the facts there stated clearly show that he was not \"married\" to Kuveti as supposed by Mr. Caldwell p. 81, but that having been captivated by\nformer remained, for a time, a distinct tribe; and that they wholly disappeared after 275 A.D., at which period they are for the last time spoken of in History as a servile class engaged in opening Tanks, etc. But whatever inferences may be drawn from the mention of the Yakkhas in the early part of our history; it is quite clear 'from all existing evidence,' 'that the period at which a vernacular dialect was common to the Yakkhas and Vijayan Colonists must have been extremely remote' and that the former soon disappeared either by amalgamation with or disintegration from the conquerors. The last supposition is however the more reasonable; since we find until very recent times a distinct tribe of people, in Ceylon, called the Veddas or Beddas, answering to the uncouth \"Yakkhas\" or \"Monkeys\" of ancient writers.\n\nThe language of our first monarch Vijaya was probably the P\u00e1li or the Pr\u00e1krit. He came to Ceylon shortly after Gotama, who spoke the P\u00e1li or the M\u00e1gadhi. He was descended through the female branch of the Royal family of Kalinga, and his birth place was Lala, a subdivision of Magadha. \"And the position,\" says Mr. James Prinsep (Bengal A. S. Journal vol. ii. p. 280) \"assumed by Mr. Lassen that the P\u00e1li of Ceylon was immediately derived from the shores of Kalinga, independently of its being matter of history, is supported by the evidence of the records now discovered in that country:\" and although Professor Lassen regards this as a question involved in obscurity, yet the very name given to the Island by Vijaya, and which we find was shortly afterwards used by the Indian Monarch Asoka, in his rock inscriptions, would lead to the inference that the P\u00e1li was the language of the con-\n\nher charms Vijaya had her for his mistress, and that when he had found he could not according to the usages of the east be crowned without a queen consort, whom a Yakkinni or 'non-human being' would ill represent, although the mother of two children, he discarded them all for the daughter of King Pandiya of the nearest civilized state.\n\n* Sir J. E. Tennent's Ceylon p. 328, with whom I entirely concur in the matter, having long abandoned a contrary opinion which I expressed in my Sidatangara. p. xxiv.\nWe are not told what was the language of the letters which accompanied the embassy sent by Vijaya to King Panduwa for a Royal Princess; but it is probable that the letter of invitation, to his brother (See Mahawansa p. 53,) Sumitta, was in the P\u0101li or the Pr\u0101krit, a language of the North, which, we learn from history, was greatly cultivated throughout the greatest part of Central India, which was at this time subject to Magadha. It is also ascertained from our historical Annals that our Kings had frequent intercourse with Arian and Dravidian Princes, and in some places the Historian describes the correspondence as having been carried on in 'the P\u0101li language.'\n\nThere is another circumstance which may be here noticed. The birthplace of the first settlers of Ceylon was L\u0101la. It is identical with L\u0101ta and L\u0101da, and Dandi, the author of K\u0101vyad\u0101ma, says that even in comparatively a modern age, that of the Dramas, the language of L\u0101ta as well as of Banga (which latter is only a different pronunciation of Vanga, and merely another name for Gawda) is usually the Pr\u0101krit. His authority goes further, for he places the language of L\u0101la in the same class as that of Goeeda, Sarasena, etc.: and his Commentator explains the 'et cetera,' to mean the Magadh\u012b (or P\u0101li) and Panckala (the Zend). Hence all circumstances considered it is very clear that the P\u0101li was the language of the band from L\u0101la who colonized Ceylon, or rather a modification of it which bore the nearest relation to such languages as the Suraseni, and the Zend\u2014at all events a so-called Prakrita dialect; therefore a language of the Arian and not of the South Indian class.\n\nThe last inference receives confirmatory proof from another historical fact, viz., that on the arrival of Mahindu in the Island he was not only able to converse readily with the people, but without loss of time to preach to them in 'the Sinhalese' language, or 'the language of the land.' This shows the intimate relationship which originally existed between the Sinhala and the dialect of Pataliputta; and although in course of several centuries as stated in the Sva-basalankara, the Sinhalese has undergone a vast change, yet it\nmay be readily believed that this change consisted in the dialect of the conquerors, (which was probably the Pr\u00e1krit) being melted with the preexisting language\u2014i.e. by a process of shortening the words of that language, and modifying it so as to suit it to the tongue of men, whose organs of speech were incapable of enunciating several of its elements, such as the aspirates and combined consonants. I shall hereafter adduce 'unequivocal proof' of the fact, that the Sinhala as it is known even at the present day, exhibits the nearest affinity to the P\u00e1li and the most distant connection with the Dravidian\u2014a fact which is farther borne out by the facility with which Buddhagosa of Pataliputta translated the Sinhalese Attakatha into the P\u00e1li. It is also a fact to which I may briefly allude here, that the only Sinhalese Grammar now extant in this Island, follows Sanskrit and P\u00e1li, and not Dravidian writers.\n\nIt is certainly true, as stated in the Sidatsangara,* that there are three elements in the Sinhalese, one in connection with the Sanskrit\u2014another with the Pali\u2014and the third with the local; but it must be remembered that the pure Sinhalese so formed upon the establishment of the Vijayan dynasty appears to have been drawn\u2020 chiefly from the Sanskrit in the 15th Century after Christ, and from the Malabar and Telingu after the domination of the Dekkan princes, of whom the last deposed Sinhalese King, Sri Wekrama R\u00e2ja Sinha, spoke the Telingu well, and the Sinhalese but indifferently.\n\nIt was perhaps this latter phenomenon in the Sinhalese that led the Rev. Dr. Stevenson to consider the Sinhalese also as a branch of the Southern family.\u00a7 His own observations, however,\n\n* See Introduction p. xiviii.\n\u2020 See the comparative specimen of the ancient and modern Sinhalese in the Sidatsangara pp. xxxvi, wherein, if one thing is clearer than another, it is that nearly every word in the first is directly traceable to the Pali, and in the second to the Sanscrit.\n\u00a7 See Bombay Asiatic Journal for 1842 p. 195; he also places the Maldivian under the head of the southern family; but I may here remark that it is clearly traceable to the Sinhalese.\nmilitate against this opinion, for he says: 'The Hindi which contains the most (i.e. Brahminical words) is estimated by Mr. Colebrook to have nine-tenths of its vocables of Sanskrit origin, and the Marathi which contains the fewest has at least four-fifths of its words derived from the same source. In the Southern family again Sanskrit words are of rare occurrence, and enter less into the common language of the people, except in the Sinhalese which from the influence of the P\u0101li chiefly derived from the Sanskrit and the language of the Buddhist literature has nearly as many words originally derived from the Sanskrit as the Hindi itself.\n\nBefore however I proceed to adduce the promised proof to establish the non-Dravidian origin of the Sinhalese, and which I purpose to lay before this Society at a future opportunity upon several distinct heads, I may conclude my introductory remarks by quoting the expressed opinion of two of the most eminent linguists of the day, viz., Caldwell and Max Muller, names which, as you know, must be deemed to impart confidence to those who have the honor to labour in the beaten path in which they have travelled. The author of the invaluable Dravidian Grammar says, 'There is no relation, however, between the Sinhalese language\u2014the language of the Sinhalese properly so-called, who were Buddhists and Colonists from Magadha or Behar\u2014and the language of the Tamilians, nor is there any reason for supposing that the natural course of migration (viz., from the mainland to the Island) was ever inverted to such a degree as to justify the supposition that the whole mass of the Dravidians entered India from Ceylon.' p. 73.\n\nAnd although there is a slight difference of opinion between Professor Max Muller and myself as to the relationship which exists between the Sanskrit and the Singhalese; yet it will be observed that that difference is one which does not affect the main question in hand. He says:\u2014'The Sanskrit now lives only in its offspring, the numerous spoken dialects of India\u2014Hindustani, Maharatti Beng\u0101li, Guzer\u0101t\u0113, Sinhalese etc, all preserving in the system of their grammar, the living traces of their common parent.'\u2014Survey of Languages, p. 31.\nA few remarks on the poisonous properties of the Calotropis Gigantea, the Mudar of Bengal, the Yercum of the Tamils, and the Warra of the Sinhalese.\u2014By W. C. Ondaatje, Esq., Asst. Col. Surgeon.\n\nIn the course of my public duties, as Medical Officer, in charge of the Civil Medical Stores, I was called upon to discover, if possible the cause of the death of one John Melder. He died at Chilaw, and the stomach and intestines with their contents were sent to me on 31st March last for examination, 12 days after death. He died shortly after some drugs had been administered to him by a native, who was considered to be a most experienced medical practitioner. It appears that the deceased having required an emetic, the native Doctor gave him a small quantity of powdered Kukuroomang seed, (Randia dumetorum), a well known native emetic, mixed in about 2 dessert spoonfuls of the milk of the plant called Warra (Calotropis Gigantea) with a quantity of cow's milk.\n\nThe immediate effects of the dose were incessant vomiting, and excruciating pain in the bowels: the extremities became benumbed and lifeless; and in about 2 hours after the medicine had been given, death supervened. The mudar has not to my knowledge been considered as a poison by Toxicologists either Indian or European. I made some experiments with a view of ascertaining the physiological properties of the fresh milk of the mudar. An ounce of it being given to a pup, in 5 minutes it began to froth at the mouth, and violent vomiting ensued until the stomach was completely emptied of its contents. The animal cried and groaned evidently from pain in the bowels. It lay down on the ground and gradually sank and expired within 24 minutes.\n\nTen minutes after I examined the animal. The mouth and tongue were of a violet colour. The stomach was quite empty, and the\nmucous membrane corrugated, the intestines were contracted presenting a cord-like appearance, and spots of inflammation were visible.\n\nThe left ventricle of the heart and the larger vessels contained fluid blood.\n\nA second experiment was made on a little dog. The quantity used was 60 drops diluted with water.\n\nThe symptoms already referred to followed each other in regular succession being attended with bloody stools. Death ensued in this case in 18 minutes.\n\nThese experiments afford sufficient and satisfactory data to lead us to the conclusion, that the milk of the mudar may be placed on the list of the most deadly vegetable poisons in Ceylon and India.\n\nIn the rapidity with which it destroys life, it is equal to the poison of the Upas, the celebrated Java poison, which it is well known is a milky juice drawn from the Antiaris Toxicaria producing the same symptoms on the animal economy that the juice of the warra does.\n\nFrom the effects which the milk of the Calotropis gigantea has thus been ascertained to produce, it appears to me to belong to the class of Narcotic-Irritant poisons, a class of poisons that act on the Cerebro-spinal system of the nerves paralysing the muscles and finally the heart.\n\nDuring the trial of the case it was clearly proved that the patient suffered from exactly the same painful and fatal effects that were noticed in my two experiments; and the contracted cord-like appearance of the man's Intestines sent to me for examination at once convinced me that death was caused by the effects of the Mudar Milk, which, though as I believed hitherto unknown as a poison, is positively such, and that of an irritant character.\n\nAs this cannot but be of great interest to the Indian Toxicologist, I have in these few remarks brought it to the notice of this Society, as this is the only literary and scientific body in Ceylon through which the fact can be communicated.\nThe Native doctor who administered the drug was tried for manslaughter in September last at Chilaw, and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment within the gaol. The leniency of the sentence is to be attributed to the circumstance, that the malpraxis in the opinion of the Jury, was the result of carelessness and ignorance.\nOn the Crocodiles of Ceylon\u2014By the Revd. Principal Boake.\n\nThe favourite haunts of Crocodiles being but seldom visited, in consequence both of the insalubrity of the localities in which they are generally to be found, and of the dangerous character of their inhabitants, the habits of these animals are very imperfectly known. The following account of two nests, which were recently found within a few miles of Colombo, may therefore be interesting to Naturalists.\n\nThe first of these nests was discovered by Mr. Symonds of the Survey Department, who found it to contain about 150 eggs, which he removed, not without considerable risk, having been repeatedly charged by the old Crocodile who was guarding them.\n\nMy curiosity having been excited by the description which I received of the nest from Mr. Symonds, I went to examine it myself. I found it amongst the bushes on the swampy bank of the Bolgodde lake, at a distance of a few feet from the water.\n\nThe nest itself consisted of wet vegetable matter mixed with mud, and was raised to the height of between three and four feet, presenting in shape very much the appearance of a small conical haystack, but in colour and consistency that of a heap of dung. Round the base of the cone, was a circular trench more than three feet broad, and about two feet deep, in which the old Crocodile was wont to wallow while watching her nest. The circle enclosed by this trench, the whole of which was covered by the base of the nest, was between six and seven feet in diameter.\n\nI am not aware that these conical nests have been previously noticed. The Rev. J. G. Wood, who makes no mention of the nests of the Crocodile, says in speaking of the Alligator in his Illustrated Natural History, that the parent deposits her eggs in the sand of the river side, scratching a hole with her paws, and placing them\nin a regular layer therein. \"She then scrapes some sand, dry leaves, grass, and mud over them, smoothes it, and deposits a second layer upon them. These eggs are then covered in a similar manner and another layer deposited, until the mother has laid from 50 to 60 eggs. Although they are hatched by the heat of the sun and the decaying vegetable matter, the mother does not desert her young, but leads them to the water and takes care of them, until their limbs are sufficiently strong, and their scales sufficiently firm to permit them to roam the water without assistance.\"\n\nIt will be seen that the nest of the Crocodile of Ceylon differs considerably from that of the Alligator as described by Mr. Wood. In the former the eggs are placed at a height of at least two feet above the surface of the water; and, although the nests in Ceylon are principally composed of aquatic weeds in a wet state, which might be expected to give out considerable heat in fermenting, yet I do not believe that any artificial heat is required to hatch the eggs, because several eggs, which were procured from the Bolgodde nests, were hatched in my house, being merely deposited in earth which was kept damp and exposed to the rays of the sun.\n\nWhile examining the nest that had been discovered by Mr. Symonds, we were told by some natives who accompanied us, that there was another nest, within a mile or two of the spot, which had not yet been disturbed.\n\nOn visiting this second nest, we found it in all respects very like the first, except that it was not so large, and that, besides the trench which surrounded it, there were one or two holes in the swamp in which the natives said that the old Crocodile was accustomed to lie.\n\nWarned by the narrow escape which Mr. Symonds had when examining the first nest, we approached very cautiously, expecting an attack every moment, and when we were all assembled on the edge of the trench surrounding the nest, we hesitated to cross it, because it was when he was in the act of stepping across the trench, that Mr. Symonds was first attacked by the other Crocodile, which raised its formidable jaws directly beneath him, and would no doubt have effectually put a stop to his proceedings, had he not\npromptly discharged the contents of his fowling piece down her throat.* On finding however that no Crocodile appeared, our confidence returned; and at length one of our number ventured to approach near enough to remove the top of the nest, and to take away the eggs, of which he procured twenty-five.\n\nOn my expressing astonishment at the pacific conduct of the parent Crocodile, and suggesting that it was probably absent in pursuit of food, the natives who were with us expressed their conviction, that it was at that moment in the trench; but that it was of a different caste from the first. Further enquiries have satisfied me that this belief in the existence of two different species, or, as the natives call them, castes, of Crocodiles is universal in the country; and Dr. J. Anderson, of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, informs me that a similar belief prevails in Bengal respecting the Mugger, which closely resembles the Crocodile of Ceylon, if it be not identical with it. One caste is said to confine itself to a fish diet, while the other attacks human beings.\n\nThe former, called by the Sinhalese Elle Kimbola, or Grey Crocodile, grows to a larger size than the more savage species, and is said to be that which is found about Kornegalle. As I have two thriving specimens, hatched from the eggs of the Crocodile which attacked Mr. Symonds, and am promised one of the progeny of that which submitted so quietly to the plundering of its nest in my presence, I hope that I shall be able to ascertain, by the aid of some eminent English Naturalist, whether they belong to the same or to two different species. At present they present no difference in appearance that an unscientific eye can detect.\n\nI may mention that there is some difficulty in bringing up young Crocodiles by hand, as they obstinately refuse every kind of food that I have ever presented to them. One, which was brought to me some years ago, died of inanition, although, for a week or ten days that it was in my possession, I constantly tempted it with\n\n* This shot was not, however, fatal; for Mr. Symonds was subsequently charged twice by, as he believes, the same crocodile.\nboth flesh and fish. Those which I now have I feed by forcing bits of raw meat down their throats with a stick, two or three times a week. Under this treatment, they seem to thrive, having about doubled in size since they left the egg; but the operation is not a pleasant one, and requires some dexterity, as their teeth are exceedingly sharp, and they lose no opportunity of turning upon the hand that feeds them.\nNative Medicinal Oils.\n\nThe processes, by which all Medicinal oils are prepared, would seem to be almost the same, except in the case of a few.\n\nThe general process followed in these preparations, is this:\u2014\n\nThe drugs prescribed for the first decoction, being cut up and pounded together, are put into a vessel (earthen or copper) with well-water four times the weight of the drugs; the whole is then gauged by means of a piece of stick, on which accordingly a mark is put to denote the quantity, and three times as much water is again added. This is boiled down to a quarter of the whole or until it is reduced to the mark. The boiling must go on very slowly, continuing for seven days. Sometimes the juices of certain plants are substituted for this decoction.\n\nThis first decoction being then strained is put into a vessel, generally copper, with oil (Sessamum or other as the case may be) equal to a quarter of it in weight, and is next boiled with a medical composition, called \"Kalke,\" compounded of a number of medicinal drugs well ground together, which kalke itself must, in weight, be equal to a quarter of the oil. The boiling of this, which may be called the second decoction, is continued for nearly five days more, except where juices are used instead of the first decoction, in which case, the boiling should not exceed three days. When the Kalke assumes the consistency of Bees' wax, the vessel is taken off the fire, and the liquid being then well strained, becomes the Medicinal Oil.\n\nOils.

Dawson, Esq., in the Chair.\nMessrs. De Zoysa, Primrose, and Steward.\n\nThe following papers were laid on the table:\u2014\n\nEngineer's Journal for June, July, August and September, 1866.\nThe Rev. Barcroft Boake, who acted as Secretary, opened the proceedings by stating that he had reason to believe that the public in Ceylon entertained a very low opinion of the value of the labours of the Society, and that he would therefore read the following extract from a letter which he had received by the last Mail from Sir Emerson Tennent, in order to show the opinion entertained by one so eminent in literature, respecting the value of the Journal recently published by the Society:\n\n\"To-day, the Post brought me the No. of the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1865-6, and I am indebted to you for a rare treat. I have done what I can seldom do, I have read it almost twice over, before I could lay it down. I never in any one volume, got so much genuine and new information about Ceylon. In addition to your own excellent contributions, which I already know so well, there is that extraordinarily clever paper of Silva Gooneratne, Mudaliyar, on Demonology, full of observation and knowledge. Then Mr. D'Alwis on the Origin of the Sinhalese Language, abounding in learning and good sense. In fact every paper in the No. is excellent, and I have heartily to thank you for remembering me in sending it.\"\n\nMr. J. D'Alwis stated that he had received similar letters from several eminent European Orientalists, and especially from the Secretary of the Parent Society, expressing the interest with which the numbers of the Ceylon Journal are received in Europe.\n\nThe following Resolutions were then adopted:\n\n1.\u2014That twelve copies of the Journal be sent to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co.; and the same number to Messrs. Williams and Norgate, to be disposed of, at 5s. each.\n\n2.\u2014That a sum of Thirty Pounds, or such smaller sum as the Treasurer may report to be available, be set apart for purchasing books of reference on Natural History, and that Mr. Holdsworth, Mr. F. M. Mackwood, Mr. H. Nevill, and Mr. W. Ferguson, be requested to act as a Sub-Committee, for laying out that sum to the best advantage.\n\n3.\u2014That the Secretary be requested to communicate with the Secretaries of the Parent Society, the Bombay Branch, and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, for the purpose of completing the imperfect sets of the Journals of those Societies which are at present in the Library.\n4.\u2014That Mr. Hawkins be requested to communicate to Mr. Barnes this Society's thankful acceptance of his collection of Lepidoptera, and that Mr. F. M. Mackwood be requested to make arrangements for its preservation.\n\n5.\u2014That the Secretary be requested to make a commencement of printing the next number of the Journal, by placing the continuation of Mr. James D'Alwis's paper on the Origin of the Sinhalese Language, in the Printer's hands.\n\nThe following gentlemen were elected members of the Society:\n\nLieut. Woodward, R. E., Captain D. Graham, Messrs. Becket, C. De Saram, S. W. Foulkes, Rhys Davids, E. L. Koch, L. Wijesinhe Mudaliyar, Ratnapura; H. Dias, W. R. Robertson, Percy H. Alven, W. J. W. Heath, and the Rev. H. Perera.\n\n6.\u2014That Lieut. Woodward be requested to undertake the office of Secretary.\n\nSeveral members having expressed their regret that the custom of holding Evening Meetings or Conversazioni had been relinquished, Mr. Lorenz proposed that a Conversazione in connection with this Society should be held at his house at 8 o'clock on the evening of Friday, February 22nd, which proposition was unanimously agreed to.\n\nA suggestion having been made, that some persons were likely to be deterred from attending the Society's Conversazioni by an idea that none but subjects connected with Oriental Literature were admissible for discussion in them, the sense of the meeting appeared to be that, in order to make the Evening meetings more attractive, any subject connected with general literature, with science, or with art, should be considered to be admissible.\n\nMr. Blake promised to read to the Meeting at Mr. Lorenz's an unpublished letter from the celebrated Robert Knox, which he had found amongst the Archives in the Colonial Secretary's Office.\nEvening Meeting.\n\nAn Evening meeting of the Society was held, on the 22nd February, at the residence of C. A. Lorenz, Esq., Ely House.\n\nMr. Boake exhibited two young Crocodiles which he had succeeded in hatching from eggs found by him.\n\nMr. Blake read the letter from Robert Knox, found by him in the Archives of the Colonial Secretary's Office.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Boake called the attention of the meeting to the quantities of resin in small globules found among the sand on the shore at Mount Lavinia. He said that Mr. H. Nevill, who had paid some attention to the subject, had found the same globules at Ballipitimodera, where he had also found large lumps of the same substance in the swamps and backwaters. He considered them fossil, and thought they might throw some light on the nature of Amber found on the German coasts of the Baltic. There was however this difference between them, that whereas Amber swam in water, these sank.\n\nDr. Ondaatje said that in the paddy fields near Cotta, masses of a resinous nature had been found near the trunks of a particular kind of tree buried in the swamp, but now no longer growing there.\n\nMr. Dawson said that in New Zealand great quantities of a similar resin were found, and were exported as an article of commerce, being very extensively used in England as a valuable varnish. It is called Kauri gum. The Kauri tree is still a valuable forest tree in New Zealand. He had seen a spar 104 feet long and 4 feet square at the butt, landed at Trincomalee. But it is strange that no Kauri gum is found where the trees are still growing, but only in parts where they formerly grew, and now bare of them.\n\nMr. Wall asked Mr. Boake, if he knew of the D\u00fam gum, exuded from the tree of that name, and whether there was any thing in common between that gum and the resin he had observed on the beach. Mr. Clerihew, a well known planter, had unsuccessfully endeavoured to make the natives collect it as an article of commerce.\n\nMr. Boake had not observed any similarity between the D\u00fam gum and that found on the beach. He would however allude to a valuable\nsecret said to be possessed by the Buddhist priests. Everyone knows how soon insects got into books in Ceylon, unless the latter were very carefully looked after. Now he had often observed how free the \u00f3la books of the Buddhist temples and Vih\u00e1ras were from the ravages of these insects, an immunity to be wondered at, as the thick vegetable \u00f3la leaf seemed peculiarly liable to their attacks. These books smelt very strong of some resinous substance, and he was informed that the priests used some preparation of resin, it might be from the D\u00fam tree, to preserve their \u00f3las from the insect. He had himself tried it, but unsuccessfully, on books.\n\nDr. Ondaatje said that the gum used for the purpose named by Mr. Boake, by the priests, was well known in Ceylon. It was from a kind of Hal tree.\n\nA discussion took place as to whether the resin was a normal or a morbid production of the D\u00fam tree. Dr. Ondaatje held the former view, Mr. Boake, Mr. Wall, and Mr. Ferguson, the latter.\n\n---\n\n**General Meeting, 31st August, 1867.**\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nRev. J. Mill, Messrs. Skeen, De Zoysa, Heath, Ferguson, Holdsworth and Lorenz:\n\nThe Minutes of the former Meetings were read over by the Secretary.\n\nA work by Dr. Balfour on the Forest Trees of Southern India, presented by the Government of Ceylon, was laid on the Table.\n\nA bronze box found under the ruins of a Dagoba near Aviss\u00e1well\u00eda was presented to the Society by Mr. Rhys Davids. The thanks of the Society were ordered to be given to Mr. Davids; and it was resolved to enquire whether the stone covering the box could be brought, at a moderate expense, to the Society's Rooms.\n\nA letter from Mr. Hawkins resigning his post as Curator was read. The Secretary also laid his resignation before the Meeting.\nThe resignations were accepted, and Mr. Nevill was appointed Secretary, with Mr. Skeen as his coadjutor in Colombo. Mr. W. Boake was requested to act as Curator.\n\nThe Rev. B. Boake, Rev. J. Mill, Mr. Holdsworth, Lieut. Woodward, and Mudaliyar De Zoysa, were appointed a Committee on Papers.\n\nIt was resolved, that the Secretary should take such steps as he should think fit, to increase the sale of the last number of the Society's Journal among the general public, it being understood that an impression prevails that it is out of print.\n\nThe following Gentlemen were then elected members of the Society:\n\nRev. J. Bacon; Dr. Loos; Messrs. H. M. Christopher, W. Boake, J. Ferguson, L. Lee, C. Both, A. Spittler, C. O'Halloran, and the Rev. Mr. Lovekin.\n\nCommittee Meeting, October, 5th, 1867.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice President, in the Chair.\n\nMessrs. C. P. Layard, A. Primrose, W. Boake, Mudaliyar Zoysa, and W. Skeen.\n\nRead a letter from the Rev. Mr. Lovekin thanking the Society for electing him as a member, but declining the honor. The Rev. Barcroft Boake explained that Mr. Lovekin was proposed by him, under the erroneous impression that he had expressed a wish to that effect.\n\nThe Rev. Barcroft Boake stated that he had requested Mr. Skeen to call the Committee together, in order to consider the propriety of requesting Mr. Nevill to inform Messrs. Williams and Norgate, who have published a book under the title of the Song of Solomon by Satyam Jayati, that no person bearing that name is at present, or has ever been, a member of this Society, and to request those gentlemen to take such steps as they may think fit for undeceiving the public on that point. The Committee approved of Mr. Boake's suggestion.\nResolved, that Mr. Alwis be requested to expend a sum not exceeding \u00a315, at his discretion, in purchasing books at the sale that has been advertised by Mr. Gabriel, especially Wight's two Works on Indian Botany, Prinsep's Indian Antiquities, and Vans Kennedy's Comparison of the Mythology of India and Europe.\n\nThe Secretary laid before the Committee a Work on Chronology by Cowasjee Patell, presented to the Society by the Ceylon Government.\n\nResolved, that the Secretary convey the thanks of the Society to the Government for the donation.\n\nCommittee Meeting, November 16, 1867.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nMessrs. W. Boake, James D' Alwis, Mudaliyar L. De Zoysa and W. Skeen.\n\nProceedings of the last Meeting read and confirmed.\n\nThe Secretary stated that he had called the meeting principally for the purpose of appointing a Treasurer in the place of Mr. Primrose, who had resigned, in consequence of his removal to Kandy.\n\nA list of 22 books was handed in, bought at Mr. Gabriel's, in accordance with the vote of the last meeting; they consisted of the following:\n\n| Title                                      | Price |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Icones Plantarum Indi\u00e6 Orientalis, 6 vols. | \u00a37 10 0 |\n| Day's Malabar Fishes                       | \u00a31 10 0 |\n| Wight's Indian Botany, 2 vols.             | \u00a33 10 0 |\n| Vans Kennedy's Hindu Mythology             | \u00a30 15 0 |\n| The Sankhya Karika, by Iswara Krishna      | \u00a30 6 0 |\n| Prinsep's Indian Antiquities, 2 vols.      | \u00a31 5 0 |\n| The Dabistan, or School of Manners, 3 vols.| \u00a30 15 0 |\n| Hampson's Origines Patricia                | \u00a30 4 0 |\n\nTotal: \u00a315 15 0\nBrought forward \u00a3 s. d.\nWight and Arnott's Prodromus Flor\u00e6 ...15 15 0\nPeninsul\u00e6 Indi\u00e6 Orientalis ... 0 5 0\nThe Sankit\u0101, or the Sama Veda ... 0 6 0\nThorpe's Northern Mythology, 3 vols. 0 12 0\n\nTotal...\u00a316 18 0\n\nFor which the Bookseller, Mr. Gabriel, accepted \u00a315.\n\nNos. 117 and 118 of the Annals and Magazine of Natural History were laid on the Table.\n\nAlso: a letter from Henry Tottie, Esq., Acting Consul at the General Consulate of Sweden and Norway, enclosing receipts for a parcel of Books forwarded to the Society by the Secretary of the Royal University of Christiana.\n\nAnd a number of the Hindu Commentary.\n\nThe Committee sanctioned the payment of a Bill of \u00a31 1s. Od., for binding.\n\nThe Secretary submitted a paper by Mr. Blake,\u2014a letter from Robert Knox, hitherto unpublished.\n\nThe Vice-President submitted a paper by Mr. Nevill, on two new birds.\n\nThe Secretary submitted an English Metrical version of the Sel\u0101-ihini Sand\u0113se.\n\nResolved, that all the papers be referred to the Committee on Papers.\n\nThe Committee requested the Secretary to act as Treasurer, until the next General Meeting.\n\nMr. D'Alwis intimated his intention of inviting the Members of the Society and their friends to an Evening Meeting at his house.\n\nResolved.\u2014That all books belonging to the Library in the possession of Members be called in twice a year, in the months of May and December.\nEvening Meeting.\n\nAn Evening meeting was held at Mr. D'Alwis's residence, 5, Silversmith Street, on the 28th November; about 30 members and friends were present.\n\nNumerous interesting articles were exhibited, consisting of Coins, Olas, specimens of Natural History, and works of Art; and a general conversation took place upon the topics which they gave rise to.\n\nGeneral Meeting, November 29, 1867.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nMessrs. W. Ferguson, F. Mackwood, J. R. Blake, Rev. C. Merson, Mudaliyar De Zoysa, Dr. Ondaatje, and Mr. W. Skeen.\n\nMinutes of preceding Meetings read and confirmed.\n\nMr. C. O'Halloran was appointed Treasurer, in place of Mr. Primrose, resigned.\n\nThe Vice-President and members requested that the Secretary should make inquiries respecting the order for supplying the Society with the Engineer Journal, which was ordered to be discontinued, although no such Minute appears in the Proceedings of the Society.\n\nDr. Ondaatje intimated his intention of drawing up a paper upon the comparative differences in the skulls of the African, Northern, and Asiatic races of mankind.\n\nThe Rev. The Vice-President, the Rev. C. Merson, Messrs. F. Mackwood, J. D'Alwis, and the Librarian, were appointed a Committee for the revision and re-arrangement of the Library and the Catalogue.\n\nResolved.\u2014That a sum of \u00a310 be voted towards reprinting the numbers of the Journal which are out of print.\n\nThe following Gentlemen were then elected members of the Society:\u2014\n\nThe Rev. J. Scott, Rev. David De Silva, Messrs. W. H. Herbert, and H. C. Hancock.\nCommittee Meeting, May 27, 1868.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nIt was proposed by the Secretary, that a new seal be procured for the Society.\n\nA letter was read from the Secretary, Mr. Nevill, containing suggestions about the proposed Report of the Proceedings of the Society.\n\nAlso, from the Rev. De Zylva requesting copy of the last Journal.\n\nResolved,\u2014That Mr. Nevill be communicated with about the Museum and the Journal, and Mr. Williams, of the Medical Store Department, respecting a Catalogue of the specimens in the Museum.\n\nThe state of the Funds not allowing the Society to pay a regular salary for a qualified Curator, it was considered that a representation should be made to the Government upon the subject, soliciting assistance.\n\nIt was resolved, that the Rev. De Zylva be requested to furnish an Introduction, Notes, or additional illustrative matter to the late Rev. D. J. Gogerly's Lecture on Buddhism, which it is proposed to print in the forthcoming Journal:\n\nAlso, that the Rules of the Society be reprinted;\n\nThat the state of the Library be reported upon, the Secretary to be added to the Library Sub-Committee:\n\nThat the glasses containing preserved specimens of Natural History be filled up with fresh spirits:\n\nThat the almirahs be shifted, the position of the cases altered, and all the arrangements made that were possible to obtain more space and better light for the specimens in the Museum; as well as to find space for the remaining specimens which have to be removed from the Military Medical Store Department.\n\nThe following letter from Mr. C. H. De Soysa, was then read.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the pleasure of sending my old Peacock, \"carefully stuffed,\"\nas a gift to the Royal Asiatic Society, Colombo, and hope you will have no objection in receiving it to be placed in the Museum; and also beg to state, that I shall be very glad to send in future some other specimens that may be useful for the place.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nC. H. De Soysa.\n\nResolved.\u2014That the thanks of the Society be communicated to Mr. De Soysa, by the Secretary.\n\nCommittee Meeting, August 15, 1868.\n\nRev. B. Boake, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nMessrs. C. P. Layard, W. Ferguson, J. D' Alwis, C. O'Halloran, Hugh Nevill, W. Skeen, and Mudaliyar De Zoysa.\n\nThe Minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nResolved, That interesting papers be for the future published as they are received and decided upon by the Committee on Papers, without waiting for other papers to form a volume:\n\nThat special Curators be appointed from time to time to act in communication with the Curator, for the arrangement and preservation of the different departments of the Society's Museum:\n\nThat Mr. W. Boake's resignation of his office of Curator be accepted; and that the thanks of the Society be given him for his past services:\n\nThat Mr. Skeen, Assistant Secretary, be requested to act as Curator; Mr. Skeen having signified his willingness to accept the office.\n\nThe Assistant Secretary reported the proceedings he had taken for re-arranging the Museum.\n\nA letter was read from Captain Horace A. Broune, of Moulmain, Burmah, requesting the co-operation of the Committee and Members of the Society, in ascertaining whether or not there existed in Ceylon any work in the P\u00e1li language, corresponding with the \"Manoo-Kyay-Dharma-That,\" (the Dharma Sutra of Manoo); a judicial work of\nauthority amongst the Burmese, which Captain Broune believes to have been originally brought from Ceylon. To assist in the enquiry, he enclosed the following\n\nMemorandum on the Laws of Menu.\n\n\"Among the literature of Burmah there exists a book entitled 'Manoo-Kyay-Dharma-That.' (The Dharma Sastra of Manoo.) This book, together with much matter that is now entirely obsolete and useless, and much indeed that could never have been in force in Burmah, contains many provisions which constitute the lex loci of Burmah, as regards inheritance, marriage, adoption, divorce, &c., &c.\n\nMuch of the book has been translated from the P\u00e1li, but there are other passages which seem to have been interpolated in more modern days; and there are others again whose origin cannot be fixed with any degree of certainty. None of it corresponds with the 'Institutes of Manoo,' as translated from the Sanscrit. The original ground-work of the book was no doubt at some time brought to this country from Ceylon; and it will be useful and interesting to ascertain whether there is still extant among the P\u00e1li literature of that Island any work at all corresponding with the Burman 'Laws of Manoo.' The different copies of this book as found among the palm leaf libraries of the Burman monks, vary considerably; the editors and copyists having from time to time made omissions, amplifications, and additions, to suit their own opinions or purposes. About twenty years ago, the best obtainable edition was printed for the use of the judicial officers of this Province. The following is a slight sketch of the contents of the work, which may be sufficient to identify it with the original, if that still exists in Ceylon. The work commences with a description of the Genesis of the present world, taken, as is stated in the work, from the Melinda pinya. It describes the gradual creation of the solar system; the first appearance of mankind, who at first had no fleshly appetites no need for eating, and no distinction of sex among them, and their gradual degeneration, till at last it was found necessary to erect a ruler in the earth, to keep in check the evil passions of its inhab-\nThis ruler was called Maha Thawada, because he was the Elect of many. In his days arose a learned cowherd, who from the age of seven years began to decide disputes among the people. His first twelve decisions are recorded, and relate to boundary disputes, thefts, damages, loans, interests, &c. Having decided a difficult case, in which the evidence was conflicting, by examining the witnesses apart, his fame reached the ears of the King, who sent for him, and much against his will, appointed him his Chief Justice. Six more of his decisions are then recorded. All of these, when pronounced, were applauded by both men and angels. The seventh case was about a small cucumber. Two men had gardens adjoining one another. A cucumber plant growing in one, spread into the other garden. The owner of the latter plucked the fruit. Manoo at first decided that he had the right to do so. At this decision angels and men were silent. Believing from this that he must have made mistakes, Manoo reconsidered his judgment, and decided that the owner of the root was also the owner of the fruit. On this both men and angels applauded. In consequence of this mistake, Manoo began to doubt his own infallibility, and obtained permission to become Pathaya. He went to live in a cave near the Mandageeenee lake, and by virtue of his religious exercises obtained the first state of 'Zan,' and ascended into heaven. There, on the boundary wall of the world, in letters as large as elephants, he found the 'Dhamma That' inscribed. This he copied and gave to King Maha Thamada. Then follows the Dhamma-That in twelve books, a chaos of enactments on every subject. Various and often inconsistent provisions relating to cognate subjects, are scattered here and there throughout the book, and topics the most incongruous are jumbled up together, forming a strange indigesta moles of law and custom, ancient and modern, Hindoo and Budhist. The provisions relating to adoption are found in four different parts of the work. Those on divorce in a dozen different places in juxtaposition with some other uncongenial subjects, such as debts or bailments, as if the book were simply a collection of placita of different judgments given in chronological sequence, and not\naccording to the subject matter of the judgments. Many of the terms used in the Hindoo law are adopted in the Burmese translation; thus, the legitimate son of a couple duly married is called Auratha. The two principal classes of adopted children Diettaka and Kiettiema; step-children are Dweepooppakara. Mixed up with the positive legal enactments are many traditionary tales, illustrative of the application of the law.\"\n\n\"If the above slight sketch is sufficient to identify the book with any existing P\u00e1li works in Ceylon, a most interesting point would be ascertained.\"\n\nThe state of the Journal was inquired into; and Mr. Alwis stated about 100 pages were printed. The Assistant Secretary was requested to edit the Journal, and to complete the issue as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Treasurer stated that the balance in hand was \u00a393 16s. 6d.\n\nCommittee Meeting, November 23rd, 1869.\n\nThe Secretary laid upon the Table the following books and periodicals received since the last meeting.\n\nQuaritch's General Catalogue of Books, arranged in classes, 1868.\nHunter's Comparative Dictionary of the Non-Aryan Languages of India and High Asia.\nFerguson's Tree and Serpent Worship.\nThe Knuckles, a Poem, descriptive of a Mountain Range and Coffee Cultivation in Ceylon, by W. Skeen.\nClassified Catalogue of Printed Books and Tracts in Sinhalese, by J. Murdoch and the Rev. J. Nicholson.\nJournals of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\nTransactions of the Bombay Geographical Society.\nThe Publications and Journals of the Royal Philological and Ethnographical Institute for Netherlands India.\nThe Publications of the Royal University of Christiana.\n6 Numbers of Tr\u00fcbner's American and Oriental Record.\nBuddha and His Doctrines, a Bibliographical Essay.\n8 numbers of the Annals and Magazine of Natural History.\n\nThe Secretary reported that 140 pages of the Journal were printed, and that it would probably be completed in a month; also, that the numbers of the Journal which were out of print were in course of being reprinted.\n\nIt was resolved, that a Special Committee meeting should be called in a few days to consider and adopt a report of past proceedings.\n\nIt was further resolved to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of Members on the 4th December.\n\nA list of 10 names of gentlemen who wished to become members of the Society was laid before the Committee.\n\nExtraordinary General Meeting, December 4, 1869.\n\nR. Dawson, Esq., in the Chair.\n\nThe Rev. S. Coles, Messrs. A. M. Ferguson, W. Ferguson, J. Capper, C.' A. Lorenz, Keppel Jones, Grenier, C. O'Halloran, and W. Skeen.\n\nMr. Skeen, on the motion of the Chairman, read the following report:\n\nThe last General Meeting of the Society was held on the 29th November, 1867. Committee Meetings were subsequently held on the 27th May and the 1st August, 1868, and on the 23rd November, 1869, when it was resolved to call the present Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nThe causes of so long a period elapsing between the last and the present General Meeting are similar to those which affect kindred Societies in Calcutta and elsewhere. Office Bearers and Members who have leisure and ability and take an interest in promoting the objects for which the Society was instituted, are removed from the Island, or to distant outstations, or by the hand of death; and a period of inaction sets in; the mere existence of the Society being cared for by a few residents in Colombo whose business avocations\nprevent them from taking a more active or prominent position in its affairs.\n\nThe arrival of strangers, or the return to Colombo of old members, elicits a spirit of inquiry; a renewed interest in the Society is kindled, and once more its proceedings are conducted with vigour papers of value are contributed; the journal is issued; and a fresh period of prosperity is entered upon.\n\nThat such an interest exists at the present moment is manifest by the number of gentlemen who have signified their wish to become members of the Society, and whose names will be submitted for ballot at the present Meeting. It may fairly be presumed that some amongst the number will be found both able and willing to contribute papers for publication in the Journal; and by this means sustain the reputation which the Society has won amongst the leading literati both in England and the continent of Europe. Now, more than ever before, Oriental scholars in the western world are investigating the languages, the literature, the religions, and the antiquities of India in general, and Ceylon in particular. Professor Max M\u00fcller, Dr. Rost, and Mr. R. C. Childers, one of our members resident in England, are engaged in translating ancient P\u0101li works into English, while other eminent Orientalists are similarly occupied elsewhere; and the result is, that not only the learned few, but the unlearned many, are taking a most keen interest in all that concerns the religion and philosophy of Gautama Buddha\u2014the prevalent native faith of the Sinhalese, with the exception of those who inhabit the northern parts of the Island.\n\nThe forthcoming Number of the Society's Journal will be found to contain valuable contributions bearing on these subjects. An elaborate and exhaustive essay by James De Alwis, deals with the question of the Origin of the Sinhalese language; on Buddhism the Society will find the last matured deliverances of their late lamented President, the Rev. D. J. Gogerly, with an Introduction by the Rev. J. Scott, and copious illustrations from the original P\u0101li by the Rev. David de Silva;\u2014there is, besides, a contribution by the Rev. S. Coles, which it is believed will throw a new and most unexpected light upon\nthe morality of Buddhism as propounded by Buddha himself. Papers by the Secretary on Ornithology and Conchology; and an hitherto unpublished letter by Robert Knox, written during his captivity in Kandy, will, with the proceedings of the Society since the issue of its last journal, complete a volume as interesting and important in its contents as any of its predecessors.\n\nA pleasing proof of the estimation in which this Society is held in Europe is afforded by the following letter which accompanied a set of the journals to which it alludes:\n\nTHE HAGUE, February, 1868.\n\nThe Royal Philological and Ethnographical Institute for Netherlands India, highly appreciating the valuable labours of your Society, and taking a deep interest in its scientific works, would consider it a privilege to entertain the same cordial relations,\u2014especially by the interchange of publications,\u2014as has been for some length of time established between the Institute and other scientific associations, among the number of which also the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal ranges.\n\nOur Board take the liberty of submitting this proposal to your consideration, and will feel much gratified if, by acceding to it, your Society will please to order the transmission of its periodicals or other works to this Institution.\n\nIn anticipation of a favorable answer, the Board beg your Society to accept of the last series of our Journal.\n\nWe remain most respectfully,\nYour obedient Servants,\n\nP. BLEEKER, President.\nJ. MILLARD, Secretary.\n\nTo the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nA set of the Society's Journals, as far as can be completed, will be forwarded to the Royal Philological and Ethnographical Institute for Netherlands India, as well as to the Royal University of Christians, from whom a similar communication, and a variety of valuable publications have been received.\n\nThe attention of members is particularly directed to a communication from Captain Horace Broune of Maulmein, which will be found\nprinted in the Journal, on the supposed Sinhalese origin of a Burmese work, called the \"Laws of Manu.\" Communications of this kind are very desirable, inasmuch as they form subjects of inquiry and discussion, which are not only interesting in themselves, but lead to many and varied points that would otherwise elude the utmost vigilance of an individual.\n\nSince the last General Meeting several important steps have been made towards a re-arrangement of the Museum. The Cabinets have been grouped, and numerous valuable specimens that, for want of available space, had been long lying uncared for in the Military Medical Stores, have, through the exertions of the late Curator and the Assistant Secretary, been transferred to and located in the Society's rooms, which however they now most inconveniently crowd.\n\nIt has been decided to solicit assistance to the Curator from members who may be willing to classify and arrange any branch of the varied collections in which they may take peculiar interest, as it has been found impossible for any merely honorary curator to give the time and trouble required to superintend directly, every branch. In accordance with this plan Mr. Nevill, the Secretary, has undertaken to arrange the shells, and probably other members will volunteer their services. The following additions have been made to the Museum since the last General Meeting.\n\nIn Natural history:\u2014\n\nA Peacock, presented by C. Soyza, Esq.\nSpecimens of the Palmcat, (Paradoxurus typus.)\nThe Indian Genette (Viverricula Malaccensis).\nThe Flying Fox, (Pterops Edwardsii,) and a large river Eel, caught in the Mahawellaganga; presented by A. Whyte, Esq., of Kandy: also a nearly full grown specimen of an Otter, caught on the banks of the Colombo Lake, presented by W. Skeen, Esq.\n\nIn antiquities:\u2014two ancient swords dug up on the Leangawella Estate; presented by A. Waddington, Esq., of Happootella.\n\nThe specimens of birds and mammals are somewhat injured by\ntime and damp, and are all mounted in the grotesquely distorted manner which characterized the taxidermy of former times. This collection is also not a local one, containing cockatoos, terriers, &c., and it is highly desirable that a fresh one should be formed, strictly confined for the present, to our indigenous Fauna; while the difficulty of preserving mounted specimens proves the desirability of retaining sets of each species of the rarer specimens, in what is called the skin, in which stage they are also far more readily available for scientific examination.\n\nThe shells of the Society will shortly be arranged on tables under glass, but in the first instance only those that are indisputably native will be so classified; a member has undertaken to name these, and contributions even of the commonest species will be most welcome.\n\nThe reptiles can only be considered the commencement of a collection, and as the Society has purchased numerous glass jars for their reception, it is believed they will quickly be increased by donations from members, until they form a complete local collection.\n\nThe addition of fresh spirit has greatly improved the appearance of the fishes and reptiles at present received.\n\nSpecimens of local minerals are numerous, but much in want of systematic arrangement; those presented by Dr. Gygax are especially interesting.\n\nIt is to be wished some members would assist in the formation of collections of coins and insects, in both of which they would probably find many persons willing to aid the Society.\n\nThe Library has been enriched by the addition of 87 volumes, Journals and numbers of publications. Of these 40 have been purchases made by order of the Committee, and 47 are donations from the Secretary of State for India, the Government of Ceylon, the University of Christiana, the Royal Philological and Ethnographical Institute for Netherlands India, the Smithsonian Institution of the United States of America, the Royal Asiatic Society, the Bengal and Bombay Branches, the Bombay Geographical Society, and private individuals.\n\nAmong the most important of these may be specially mentioned,\nFerguson's valuable illustrated volume on the Tree and Serpent Worship of India, presented by the Secretary of State for India; and Hunter's Comparative Dictionary of the Non-Aryan Languages of India and High Asia, presented by the Author.\n\nThe state of the buildings occupied as the Society's rooms is such as to justify apprehensions as to the safety of the roof, a portion of which is much damaged.\n\nThe Treasurer's statement shews a balance of \u00a399 19s. 7\u00bdd. in hand; there is however a considerable amount of subscriptions in arrear, which it is exceedingly desirable members should pay in without delay, inasmuch as a large sum will be required for reprinting back numbers of the Society's Journal, some of which are quite out of print, and of others only a few copies still remain on hand. Arrangements for reprinting have already been made, and it is hoped that before the close of another year complete sets will be ready for delivery to all who desire to possess them.\n\nOn the motion of C. A. Lorenz, Esq., seconded by J. Capper, Esq., the Report was adopted, and ordered to be printed.\n\nThe following list of names of gentlemen desirous of membership was then read; and each having been duly proposed and seconded, they were then ballotted for and elected:\n\nThe Hon. T. B. Stephen, Messrs. H. W. Gillman, C. Dickman, Captain Horace A. Browne, E. Robinson, Dr. Brighouse, W. C. Brodie, J. B. Curtayne, R. L. M. Brown, C. Tatham, R. H. Morgan, E. Gower, J. W. Venn, H.

Brito, A Campbell, Rev. S. Coles, G. A. L. Bowling, G. Armitage.\n\nIt was then resolved, that a Deputation from the Society should wait upon His Excellency the Governor to solicit aid from the Public Funds for the extension of the Society's Rooms, which had\nbeen promised during the administration of Sir Charles MacCarthy: and for the payment of a permanent Secretary.\n\nThe Rev. S. Coles then read a paper on Buddhism, containing a summary of, and extracts from the Tun Pittakas, which regulates the conduct of the priesthood.\n\nThe paper was referred to the Committee on Papers.\n\nSpecial General Meeting, March 12, 1870.\n\nC. P. Layard, Esq., in the Chair.\n\nMessrs. R. Dawson, W. C. Brodie, J. Capper, Keppel Jones, W. Bryan, S. Grenier, Dr. Koch, and W. Skeen.\n\nThe Secretary laid upon the Table the first part of the Journal for 1866\u201470; and presented the Society with a specimen of the sea-snake Hydrophis subl\u00e6vis of Gray, upwards of six feet long, which had been caught about twelve miles off Colombo.\n\nThe following gentlemen were then elected members of the Society:\n\nCapt. A. B. Fyers, R. E., Lieut. Vincent W. Legge, R. A., Messrs. J. D. Young, W. E. T. Sharpe, \u00c6. A. King, C. S. Sparkes, and R. Andree.\n\nThe Meeting then proceeded to elect Office Bearers for the ensuing year. The following Gentlemen were elected:\n\nPresident.\n\nCapt. A. B. Fyers, R. E.,\n\nVice-Presidents.\n\nRev. B.

R. Blake ... ... ... 143\u2014150\nOn the Origin of the Sinhalese Language;\nBy James Alwis, Esq., M. R. A., S.\n\nSection Second.\n\nIn a previous paper I adverted to a few historical facts in proof of the proposition, that 'the Sinhalese is an affiliated dialect of the Sanskrit, and that it bears no affinity to the Dravidian or South-Indian class of languages.' In the present I purpose to adduce the promised proof: and here I may premise that (1) whether we compare the phonetic system of the Sinhalese with that of the Dravidians; or (2) resort to lexical analogies of the same languages; or (3) compare their grammatical relations; or (4) examine the syntactical arrangement of their words, we arrive at but one conclusion, viz., that the Sinhalese is as independent of the Dravidian as the latter is of the Sanskrit.\n\nSounds.\n\nThere is some resemblance between a few of the modern Sinhalese and Tamil letters; but this does not lead to any important\nresult, since both Alphabets are derived from the Deva N\u00e0gar\u00ec,* and since also the peculiarities which distinguish the Sinhalese from the Tamil are such as to render it very probable that each had an independent origin. Before proceeding however to point them out, it may be stated that the Sinhalese alphabet now in current use was not the one employed in the third century, since the earliest unmistakeable record of a royal grant engraved on a rock about A.D. 261, intended to be read by the Sinhalese of after-generations, and therefore written in the Sinhalese language, is in the Deva N\u00e0gar\u00ec character.\u2020\n\nTo the Telagu, Canarese, and the Tamil, as well as to the Sinhalese, are known a short e and o; but these have been of comparatively recent introduction into the Sinhalese; for our alphabet itself, like the Deva N\u00e0gar\u00ec, does not give any symbols for the long sounds.\n\nThe Tamil has no characters corresponding to the ri, lri, au, and ah; nor has it adopted the obscure anusv\u00e1ra.\u2021 Though all these are found in the Sinhalese alphabet, yet it is only the last which is necessary to express the Sinhalese, the other letters being used for the purpose of expressing either P\u00e0li or Sanskrit words. Among the Sinhalese vowels there are also two characters not found in the Deva N\u00e0gar\u00ec. These are \u00e6 and \u00c6. It is true they are not given in our alphabet, which is in every respect identical, as regards sounds, with the Deva N\u00e0gar\u00ec; and that they are not found in the Sidatsangar\u00e2. But, whether or not we regard them as modifications of the a and \u00e0, it is important to bear in mind that there are in the Sinhalese many hundred words whose initials begin with these sounds, whilst it is impossible to say how frequently they occur as medials, as a in \u2018bat\u2019 or a in \u2018stand\u2019. Now it is very remarkable that, whilst this \u00e6 is deficient in all the South-Indian Alphabets, no\n\n* Caldwell\u2019s Drav. Grammar, p. 93 et seq.\n\u2020 See the Ceylon Almanac for 1834.\n\u2021 \u2018There is nothing in any of the Dravidian Languages which corresponds to the use of the obscure nasal Anusv\u00e0ra as a final, in Hindi and in the northern vernaculars.\u2019\u2014Caldwell\u2019s Comp. Grammar. p. 108.\nDravidian organs of speech can pronounce it correctly. We have often been amused in our intercourse with the Tamils by their ludicrous pronunciation of it. If, e.g., a Tamilian wishes to say *eta* 'seed,' he would invariably express it *eta*. So likewise *ati* 'are,' he would express *eti* 'come;' *bari* 'impossible,' *beri* 'very ripe;' *aka* 'waist,' *eka* 'one;' etc. etc.\n\nAgain, we have the 'half-anusv\u00e2ra' which is deficient in all the Dravidian languages except the Telagu. It is true that our classical Sinhalese, like the Tamil, is deficient in aspirates; yet it will be observed that the former possesses all the consonants known to the Deva N\u00e2gar\u00ee, whilst the latter adopts only the first and last characters of each of the five classes into which the consonants are divided in the Deva N\u00e2gar\u00ee Alphabet. 'Thus,' as remarked by Caldwell, 'the Tamil Alphabet omits not only all the aspirated consonants,......but also all its soft and sonant letters.' p. 96. The Tamil, is moreover, deficient in the aspirate 'h' as well as the sibilant 's', both which have an existence in the Sinhala as may be perceived in the very name given to our language.\n\nThe change of *s* into *h* is, moreover, a peculiarity which is to be found in some Pr\u00e2krit dialects,* as in the Sinhalese.\u2020 It exercises such vast influence over those languages in the formation of sounds, that on this ground alone we may determine the independence of the Sinhalese Alphabet, in its origin, of the Tamil.\n\nWe may also point out four letters in the Tamil which are as much unknown to the Deva N\u00e2gar\u00ee, as to the Sinhalese Alphabet. These are a deep liquid 'r,' another 'r' which is harsh and rough in its sound, a peculiar 'l' with a mixture of r, and an 'n,' between which and the dental 'n' there is no difference except that the former is invariably used as a final.\n\nThese differences may be attributed to the high antiquity of the literary cultivation of the Dravidian dialects as compared with the northern. When Wijaya arrived in Lanka, at the latter end of\n\n---\n\n* See Cowell's Prakrit Prak\u00e2sa, p. 121.\n\u2020 See Sidatsangar\u00e0 cap. i. \u00a7 22.\nthe fifth century before the Christian era, the Dravidians were already acquainted with letters. So were the Sinhalese colonists; for, soon after their settlement in the island, they 'dispatched a letter of invitation.'* But the two nations had no common origin. Their alphabets too are different. It would therefore be reasonable to conclude that the alphabet which the Sinhalese brought down to Ceylon was, what their earliest writing\u2020 exhibit, the oldest form of the D\u00eava N\u00e2gar\u00ee, similar to the characters of the inscriptions of Asoka.\n\nThe following comparative table of the Sinhalese and the Tamil Alphabets also proves that the former has not reached the Sanskrit through a Dravidian medium.\n\n**Vowels.**\n\nSinh. \u2014 a, \u00e0, i, \u00ec : u, \u00f9 : ri, r\u00ec : lri lri\u00ec :\u2014e : ai :\u2014o : au : an : ah\n\nTamil \u2014 a, \u00e0 : i, \u00ed : u, \u00f9 :\u2014 \u2014 :\u2014 :\u2014 e, \u00e8 : ei : o, \u00f2 : au :\u2014\n\n**Consonants.**\n\nGutturals, Sinh. ... k kh : g gh : n\n\nDitto, Tamil ... k \u2014 : \u2014 \u2014 : n\n\nPalatals Sin. ... ch chh : j jh : n\n\nDitto, Tamil ... ch \u2014 : \u2014 \u2014 : n\n\nCerebrals, Sin. ... t th : d dh : n\n\nDitto, Tamil ... t \u2014 : \u2014 \u2014 : n\n\nDental Sin. ... t th : d dh : n\n\nDitto, Tamil ... t \u2014 : \u2014 \u2014 : n\n\nLabials, Sin. ... p ph : b bh : m\n\nDitto, Tamil ... p \u2014 : \u2014 \u2014 : m\n\nSemi-vowels, Sin. y r l v\n\nDitto, Tamil y r l v r l r\n\nSibilants and aspirate,\n\nSinh. s, sh, s, h\n\nTamil \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\n* Mahawansa p. 53.\n\u2020 See the Inscriptions at Mihintale.\nThough the Sinhalese alphabet contains, as above indicated, the Sanskrit vowels ri, r\u012b, lri, lri, ai, and au; yet they are unknown to the language itself, thus exhibiting a difference between it and the Tamil, which has ai and au; and, as the reader is aware, a similarity to the Pr\u00e2krit dialects which reject all the above vowels. The changes, too, which Pr\u00e2kritis effect in the letters of words which are taken from the Sanskrit are exactly the same in the Sinhalese, e.g.\n\ni. The Sanskrit ri is changed into a, i, u,* and e in the Sinhalese; and in this respect the latter follows the Pr\u00e2krit, of which we shall quote the P\u00e2li.\n\n| Sanskrit | Pali | Sinhalese |\n|----------|------|-----------|\n| dridha   | dalba| dala      |\n| krita    | kala | kala      |\n| hrida    | hada | hada      |\n| mrita    | mata | mala      |\n| vishi    | isi  | isi       |\n| sidhi    | iddhi| idu       |\n| krimi    | kimi | kimi      |\n| srig\u00e0la  | sig\u00e0la| sival    |\n| riju     | uju  | udu       |\n| mridu    | mudu | mudu      |\n| vriksha  | rukkh| ruk       |\n| griha    | geha | ge        |\n\nii. The use of lri being not very different from that of ri, even in the Sanskrit, I shall pass on to ai, which becomes i or e; thus.\n\n| Sanskrit | Pali | Sinhalese |\n|----------|------|-----------|\n| aishvarya| issariya| isuru    |\n| Air\u00e2vana | Er\u00e2vana| Eravana  |\n| Kail\u00e2sha | Kel\u00e2sa | Keles    |\n| taila    | tela  | tel       |\n| vaira    | vera  | vera      |\n\n* See Cowell's Pr\u00e2krit Prak\u00e2sa, p. xviii.\n\u2020 A word signifying 'power to go through the air.'\niii.

It will be seen that the Sanskrit d is changed into l; as in\n\n| Sanskrit | Pali | Sinhalese |\n|----------|------|-----------|\n| \u00e3s\u00e0dha   | \u00e3s\u00e0lha | sesala | 'July' |\n| dridha   | dalha | dala    | 'coarse' |\n| dramidha | damila | demala | 'Tamil' |\n| praudha  |      | pavala  | 'bold.' |\n\nv.

The Sanskrit and Pali ch is frequently changed into s in the Sinhalese; whilst no effort is spared by Dravidian organs, even where a Sanskrit word with an s is adopted by the Tamils, to change the s into ch, as Chinkala for Sinhala.\n\n| Sanskrit | Pali | Sinhalese |\n|----------|------|-----------|\n| chaura   | chora | sora     | 'thief' |\n| chumba   | chumba | simba | 'kiss' |\n| chatur   | chatu | satara   | 'four' |\n| chakka   | chakka | saka   | 'wheel.' |\n\n* I have not met the equivalent of this in the P\u00e2li.\nvii. Here I am reminded of a peculiarity which distinguishes the Dravidian from the Sinhalese. It is that whilst the Sinhalese loves to conclude a word with *a*, as in *satara*, the Dravidians lose no pains to get rid of it, by adopting in its stead a *u* or *ei*; e.g. *\u016bru* for *\u0101ra*, 'a village'; *avei* for *ava*, 'those,' etc. etc.\n\nviii. The Sinhalese *d* often represents the Sanskrit and P\u00e2li *j*.\n\n| Sanskrit | Pali | Sinhalese |\n|----------|------|-----------|\n| r\u00e2jan    | r\u00e2j\u00e2 | rada      | 'king'   |\n| p\u00fbj\u00e2     | p\u00fbj\u00e2 | puda      | 'offering' |\n| majj\u00e2    | majj\u00e2 | mada      | 'kernel' |\n| ruj\u00e2     | ruj\u00e2 | rud\u00e2      | 'pain.' |\n\nThere are many other dialectic changes which unmistakeably point out that the Sinhalese has proceeded from the Sanskrit; but I have, I apprehend, already shown enough, without entering largely into questions relating to dialectic interchanges of sounds, euphonic permutation of consonants, the laws of harmonic sequence, etc. etc., to prove that the Sinhalese, whilst it accords with the northern dialects, essentially differs from the Tamil in its phonetic system. In proving this, I believe, I prove also its difference from the other affiliated Dravidian dialects; for their essential unity in all important and minor matters cannot be denied.\n\nSection Third.\n\nLexical Analogies.\n\nThose who maintain an opinion different from our own, refer to the existence in the Sinhalese, of words of undoubted Dravidian origin. This can no more be denied than the existence in the undisputed Sanskrit dialects of a vast number of Dravidian words. Indeed we admit the fact; and the History of Ceylon gives a sufficient explanation of this; for, we know that the northern provinces of this island have been, from very ancient times, held by Tamilians; and that after the fall of the great Sinha dynasty in Ceylon, the island was governed by Indian princes of undoubted Dravidian origin, between whom and the Sinhalese a warfare had\nbeen previously carried on, commencing from a period so far back as the age of the memorable Dutugemini.* It is perfectly reasonable, therefore, to expect in the Sinhalese an admixture of Dravidian words, such as *vela* (veil) \u2018field,\u2019 *kappal* \u2018ship,\u2019 *gala* (kallu) \u2018stone,\u2019 *neli* (n\u00e2li) \u2018a measure,\u2019 *adangu* \u2018to contain,\u2019 *adukku* \u2018to pile one over the other,\u2019 *paru* to become \u2018over-ripe,\u2019 etc. But, as very justly observed by the author of the Sidatsangar\u00e2, this element of local origin and of casual accession (nipan), is but one of three elements, the other two being\u2014the pure, and the adulterated Sanskrit or P\u00e2li.\u2020\n\nMany words of the first class, though corresponding with the Dravidian, are yet allied to the Sanskrit, as the following; and it is therefore impossible, in many instances, to determine whether they have been borrowed directly from the Tamil, or from the Sanskrit which has also, it is supposed by some, borrowed\u2021 from the Dravidian: e. g. The Sinhalese word *amma* \u2018mother,\u2019 which is the same in Tamil, is found in the Sanskrit as well as in some of the Indo-European tongues; *katu* \u2018pungent,\u2019 corresponds with the Telagu \u2018katu,\u2019 and the P\u00e2li and Sanskrit *katu*; the Tamil *kalei* \u2018arts,\u2019 which is *kal\u00e0* in the Sinhalese, P\u00e2li and Sanskrit, is supposed to be derived from the Tamil *kal* \u2018to learn;\u2019 *kuti* \u2018house\u2019 or \u2018hut\u2019 in the Sinhalese has much resemblance to the Tamil *kudi* or the Canarese *gudi,* and *kuti* in the P\u00e2li and the Sanskrit; *kotva* (*k\u00f3ta* Sanskrit) \u2018fort\u2019 resembles the Tamil *kotei*; etc. etc.\n\n* \u2018It is undeniable that immigrations from Ceylon to the southern districts of India have occasionally taken place. The Teers (properly Tivar, \u2018islanders\u2019) and the Ilavars \u2018Singhalese,\u2019 (from Ilam \u2018Ceylon; a word which has been corrupted from the Sanskrit Sinhalam, or rather from the P\u00e2li Sihalam, by the omission of the initial s), both of them Travancore Castes, are certainly immigrants from Ceylon; but these and similar immigrants are not to be considered as Singhalese, in the proper sense of the term, but as offshoots from the Tamilian population of the northern part of the island. They were the partial reflux of the tide which peopled the northern and western parts of Ceylon with Tamilians.\u2019 Caldwell\u2019s Comp. Grammar, p. 72.\n\n\u2020 See Sidatsangar\u00e2, p. 4.\n\n\u2021 Caldwell\u2019s Comp. Grammar, p. 440, et seq.\nBut all the words in the Sinhalese that may be directly traced to the Dravidian, are so few, that if collected, they will not, I am persuaded, shew a larger proportion than one to nine. And, it is very significant that the writer of the Sidatsangar\u00e0 does not, in giving examples of his three classes, mention one single word which is derived from the Dravidian.\n\nThough, however, so far as the dictionary goes, it is perhaps generally difficult to determine the relation of a language which is composed of different elements, as, for instance, the English; yet, I believe, it may be affirmed that there is no language, like the Sinhalese, which has 'nine-tenths' of its vocables clearly derived from a Sanskrit source, that may be traced to a Dravidian origin. On the other hand, there is no language, in which the Dravidian element is far in excess of the Sanskrit, that may be placed in the northern group. Take, for instance, the Hindust\u00e1ni, Mar\u00e1thi, Beng\u00e1li, Guzer\u00e1ti. The Sanskrit or north-Indian element of these idioms is nearly as much in excess of the Dravidian, as in the Tamil, Telagu, Karn\u00e1taka, and Mal\u00e1yalim (the south-Indian languages) the non-Sanskrit or the Dravidian is in excess of the north-Indian or the Sanskrit element.\u2020 In proceeding therefore to an examination of lexical analogies, I shall select on the one hand the Tamil, the most cultivated of the south-Indian languages,\u2021 in which the Sanskrit element is less than in others,\u00a7 and from whence the other Dravidian dialects are supposed to have been derived; and, on the other, the P\u00e1li, to which, as I shall hereafter show, the Sinhalese mediately, if not directly, owes its origin.\n\n* Professor Max Muller's Survey of Languages, p. 7.\n\u2020 Caldwell's Comp. Grammar, p. 39.\n\u2021 'From the various particulars above mentioned it appears certain, that the Tamil language was of all the Dravidian idioms the earliest cultivated: it also appears highly probable that in the endeavour to ascertain the characteristics of the primitive Dravidian speech, from which the various existing dialects have been derived, most assistance will be furnished by the Tamil'\u2014Caldwell's Comp. Grammar, p. 60.\n\u00a7 ib. p. 33.\nBefore entering into direct proof, it may be here convenient to notice the lexical analogies of the Dravidian and the Sinhalese, to which Dr. Steveson of Bombay refers in an article 'on the language of the aboriginal Hindus.' If his conjecture be correct, we might, as justly remarked by Caldwell, reasonably expect to find in their vocabularies a few primary Dravidian roots,\u2014such as the words for 'head,' 'hand,' 'foot,' 'eye,' 'ear,' &c.; but we have not been able to discover any reliable analogy in words belonging to this class. But Dr. Stevenson professes to give us a comparative list of \"forty-one primitive words, all expressive (as he says) of such ideas as men must use in the infancy of society:\" let us examine them.\n\nReferring the reader to that list, I shall confine my observations to the Sinhalese and the Tamil, which are put down in the Southern class. At the outset the reader will observe, that of forty-one words given of the Hindi, in order to show their agreement in sound with the words of the Beng\u00e1li, Guzar\u00e1ti, Mar\u00e1thi, Telagu, Karn\u00e1tika, Tamil, and Sinhalese, the learned Doctor has signally failed to show the Sinhalese for seventeen.\n\ni. Of the remaining twenty four, 'appan, Tamil, = app\u00e0, Sinhalese,' appears first. This is not an ancient Sinhalese word; nor does it occur in our books, which give us piya and bap. But the word which denotes 'father,' it would seem, is the same in nearly all languages. In the Indo-European and the Semetic families the base is a p or b, the difference being that in the former the word commences with the consonant above given, e.g., pater; whilst in the latter, as in the Hebrew ab, the vowel a is prefixed to that consonant. In this respect the Dravidian follows the Semetic. Whether this vowel is added or not, it is quite clear that the origin of the word is the same, and that the one-ness of language in a few words, as in the instance before us, proves the one-ness of origin.\u2014'the one language and one speech of the whole earth before the dispersion of mankind.'\n\n* Bombay A. S. Journal for 1842, p. 103.\n\u2020 See further remarks hereon under the table of names,\u2014infra.\nii. P\u00e1pan, 'holy father,' Tam.:=bapa 'holy father,' Sinhalese. The Tamil word here given is the abbreviation of pr\u00e1ppan, [the addition pra being the Sanskrit inseparable preposition denoting 'pre-eminence,'] 'one higher than a full father.' The Sinhalese b\u00e1pp\u00e1 means 'uncle,' and not 'holy father;' and it is derived from b\u00e1la 'young,' and app\u00e1, 'sire.'\n\niii. Kudapp\u00e1, the Sinhalese word for 'paternal uncle' is compared with the Telagu k\u00e0kk\u00e0, signifying the same. Now, in the primary Dravidian dialect, the Tamil k\u00e0kk\u00e0 means 'peddler;' but the Sinhalese kudapp\u00e1 has no relation to either the Telagu or the Tamil words, the former being, like b\u00e1pp\u00e1, a compound of kud\u00e1, 'young,' and app\u00e1, 'sire.'\n\niv. Adi, Tamil, 'foot;'=adi, Sinhalese, 'foot.' The correct word for 'foot' in Sinhalese is p\u00e1; see infra. But adi is found in the vernacular to signify the 'substratum' of one's feet, or of any other object; and I believe it comes from the P\u00e1li particle adha, 'underneath.' Adi is also used to denote a measure of twelve inches. In this sense it is clearly an imported word like many a word expressive of modern arts, inventions, &c.\n\nv. Perru, 'bear a child,' and petta pillei, 'own child,' in the Tamil, are compared with phaddh, bad, 'the belly, the womb,' Sinhalese. I am not aware that phaddh is a Sinhalese word; but the word bada has no relation whatever to the Tamil words given above.\u2014See list under the head of Names,\u2014infra. In reference to the general list of Dr. Stevenson, and particularly as regards the words under this head, Caldwell remarks:\u2014\"In many instances Dr. Stevenson's lexical analogies are illusory, and disappear altogether on a little investigation. Thus, he supposes the north-Indian 'pet,' the belly, the womb, to be allied to the first word in the Tamil compound 'petta pillei,' own child. That word should have been written 'pettra' in English, to accord with the pronunciation of the Tamil word: the Tamil spelling of it, however, is 'perra.' It is the preterit relative participle of per-u, to bear, to obtain, signifying that was borne. 'Per-u,' to obtain, has no connexion with any\nword which signifies the womb, and its derivative noun 'p\u00e9a-n,' means a thing obtained, a birth, a favour.\"\n\nvi. Kulambu, 'clay, loom;' kolu, 'a plough share' Tamil\u2014are exhibited as showing a resemblance to kumbur, 'a paddy field' in the Sinhalese. The relation between the two sets of words is more imaginary than real. The Sinhalese words for 'clay' and 'plough' are quite different, and have no reference whatever to a field. The word kumbur is supposed to be derived from the Sanskrit kumb 'to cover,' hence kumbha in P\u0101li is 'an amunam in extent,' generally referring to the sowing-extent of a field; and thence we get kumbura, Sinhalese, 'a field.' My pandit, however, believes that this is derived from the P\u0101li ked\u0101ra.\n\nvii. Koliyan, 'a weaver of the Pariah Caste,' kolairur, 'hunters,' in Tamil, are compared with the Sinhalese kolleya, 'plunder.' Philologically or historically, there is no relation between these words. The Sinhalese word is clearly derived from the P\u0101li k\u00f3la-kala, 'tumult,' with which plunder is ever associated in one's mind.\n\nviii. Torravu, 'a herd of cows,' totti, 'a pound' in Tamil\u2014are set against the Sinhalese tavalam, 'a flock or herd.' The Sinhalese never use this word simply to indicate 'a flock;'\u2014the sense in which they do use it being to denote cattle employed to convey goods; which, it is remarkable, are placed on either side of the animal's back, so that the two loads may balance equally. Now, tavla in the Sanskrit is 'a balance.'\n\nix. Atam 'across,' adkam 'enclosing, hiding,' adam 'hindrance,' Tamil\u2014are shown as related to the Sinhalese adaya, 'prop,' and adassiya, 'obstruction;' but ade or adaya is strictly that which is kept under an object in order to prop it up. In this sense it comes from the P\u0101li adho, 'under;' whence adassi may be something that obstructs the assa (ansa) or 'side' [inside.]\n\nx. Kurrai, 'defect,' Tamil;=koradus, 'unripe grain,'\u2020\u2014Sinhalese. It is here only necessary to refer the reader to the Sanskrit\n\n* Caldwell's Comp. Grammar, p. 40.\n\u2020 It does not mean 'unripe grain;' but is a proper name in the Sinhalese, as\nkoradusha, from whence we have obtained the Sinhalese word, to show its non-relation to the Tamil kurrai.\n\nxi. Alei, 'a wave,' Tamil, is said to be allied to rela, 'a wave,' in the Sinhalese. The English ripple would be nearer rela than the Tamil alei. But the Sinhalese word comes from the P\u0101li tarala, 'trembling'\u2014'to pass, to go or move.'\n\nxii. Oduhidam, 'a recess,' Tamil=odokkuva, 'a place in the waist for money,' Sinhalese. This is the only word in the list before us which is derived from the Dravidian. It comes from odukku 'to heap,' thence odokku-va 'the place [generally the waist] in which something is kept.' This is however a modern introduction, and is not to be found in the books, which use eka, from the P\u0101li anka.\n\nxiii. Opa, 'smoothness, beauty,' Tamil;\u2014opa, 'polish, glittering,' Sinhalese. This is clearly a child of the Sanskrit ojas, 'light, splendour,' from whence we get oda, and thence opa.\n\nxiv. K\u00e0, k\u00e0vari, 'a piece of wood with ropes attached,' Tamil=kavandan, 'a bullock's yoke,' Sinhalese. There is some mistake here. Mr. Clough, from whose Dictionary this is said to have been taken, does not give it; and there is no such word in the Sinhalese.\n\nxv. Korabu, 'nibbling as a mouse,' Tamil=kurutu, Sinhalese, 'a rasp.' What resemblance there is between the nibbling of a mouse and the action of kurutu 'scraping,' 'scratching,' [e.g. apas-kirate kak-kutah 'the cock furrows;'] I cannot say; but, I believe the words are not related to each other.\n\nxvi. Tati, 'skreen,' Tamil=tatitu, Sinhalese, 'a ceiling, ship's deck.' This word should be tattu (see Clough) from the P\u0101li tat\u012b 'top,' between which and a screen there is no relation whatever.\n\nxvii. Podi, 'full sacks or bags,' Tamil=podi, 'a bale,' Sinhalese. The Sinhalese like the Tamil word, is derived from the Sanskrit and P\u0101li puta, 'concavity.'\n\nin the P\u0101li and Sanskrit, for 'a species of grain eaten by the poor people'\u2014paspalum scrobiculatum, Lin.\nxviii. Kannar\u00e0li, 'a melancholy event,' in Tamil, is compared with kanakal, 'excellent,' Sinhalese. Clough does not give this; nor is there a word approaching to that sound in the Sinhalese. But, what is the analogy between excellent and melancholy?\n\nxix. Mottamuta, 'total,' Tamil=monvata, 'beautiful,' Sinhalese. What coincidence there is between 'total' and 'beautiful,' I cannot perceive; but this I can state\u2014that the Sinhalese word monavata comes from mand, 'pleasingly,' and kota, 'done.'\n\nxx. Kargarapu, 'a rattling noise like thunder,' Tamil=\u00e0rada-ra, Sinhalese, 'teasing.' The Sinhalese word is deduced by some from the P\u00e2li khara with the affix tara, changed into dara; whilst others trace it directly to the P\u00e2li kheda, 'affliction.'\n\nxxi. Pinru, 'retreat,' Tamil=peral, 'overturn,' Sinhalese. The latter is from parivattana, and has no relation to the Tamil word here given.\n\nxxii. Polip, 'a brief explanation,' in Tamil=bola, 'a familiar term of address,' Sinhalese. Here again we do not perceive the analogy intended to be drawn. Bola comes from bhrutaka, Sanskrit; bhataka, P\u00e2li; b\u00e2la Sinhalese, 'hireling'; hence bola is a term of address for a subject, or a servant.\n\nxxiii. Muri, 'to break,' Tamil=madanv\u00e1, 'to squeeze,' Sinhalese. Muri bears no relation to madina, which is directly derived from majjama, the P\u00e2li word of the same signification.\n\nxxiv. Ap\u00e2, Tamil=apoi, Sinhalese, an interjection. Without exclaiming with Y\u00e2ska, the eminent Hindu philologer, that 'words are fixed in the world, we cannot say how,\u2014svabh\u00e2vat\u00e2k by nature,' we may refer to the Sanskrit particle apa implying 'loss, negation, privation, wrong, bad, unnatural, as the source whence we have obtained apoi.\n\n\"The only resemblances (says Caldwell) which have been pointed out are those which Dr. Stevenson has traced in a few words remote from ordinary use, and on which, in the absence of analogy in primary roots, and especially in grammatical structure, it is impossible to place any dependence.\" I may add that, as regards\n\n*K is changed into v as dandu-kam=dandu-vam; See Sidatsangar\u00e0, p. 17.\nthe Sinhalese in Dr. Stevenson's list of forty-one words, there are but three which have any relation to the Dravidian. They are app\u0101, 'father;' odokkuva, 'a recess in the waist;' and adi, 'a foot of twelve inches.' Thus, the proportion which the Sinhalese bears to the Dravidian is, in the instances selected by the Doctor, less than one to thirteen.\n\nI have occupied more space than was actually necessary to disprove the relationship attempted to be established between the Sinhalese and the Dravidian. It is time to proceed to direct proof of their non-relation.\n\nI purpose to institute my comparisons with reference to what is called by Abel Remusat, the 'prerogative instances,' consisting of nearly all the words given in a List issued by 'the Anthropological Society, to be noted and used for the radical affinities of languages, and for easy comparison,'\u2014words which may be classed into (1) numerals; (2) names for days, and (3) months; (4) pronouns; (5) names, and (6) actions expressive of the common wants of mankind; (7) the earliest extant Sinhalese; and (8) words in our authors, usually entitled the Elu.\n\n| Numerals | Pali. | Sinhalese. | Tamil. |\n|----------|------|------------|-------|\n| One      | eka  | eka        | onnu\u2014oru |\n| Two      | dva  | deka       | rendu |\n| Three    | ti   | tuna       | m\u00fbnu |\n| Four     | chatu| satara     | n\u00e0lu |\n| Five     | pancha| pasa     | anji |\n| Six      | chcha| saya       | \u00e0ru |\n| Seven    | satta| sata       | \u00e8lu |\n| Eight    | atta | a\u1e6d\u1e6da       | ettu |\n| Nine     | nava | nava       | ombadu |\n| Ten      | dasa | dasa       | pattu |\n| Twenty   | visati| vissa    | irivadu |\n| Fifty    | pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa| panasa  | ambadu |\n| Hundred  | sata | siya       | n\u00fbru |\n\nThe above comparisons clearly indicate that the Sinhalese nume-\nrals stand in fraternal connection with the P\u00e1li and the Sanskrit. There is not one Sinhalese word in the above list which has the least affinity to the Tamil, if we except etta, 'eight.' Its resemblance to the corresponding numeral of the Indo-European family, is indeed very remarkable; and it is generally supposed that the Tamil numeral noun is derived from the Sanskrit ashta. But, as properly remarked and proved by Caldwell, 'this resemblance, though so close as to amount almost to identity of sound, is accidental; and disappears on investigation and comparison, like the resemblance between unus and unus, anju and pancha.'\u2020 Again, it is true that oka is used in the Telagu for 'one;' but the resemblance between it and the Sinhalese eka is as illusory as that between the English 'one' and the Tamil 'onnu.' It is also true that the Canarese onda, 'one,' and the Malayalam renda for 'two,' are occasionally used by the Sinhalese as in ota for 'one-tenth' or 'tithes,' and onda, 'unit,' iratte, 'double,' as in playing a Tamil game with chanks; but, as every one conversant with our language fully knows, they are used very seldom, and are not to be met with in our books. \"Though eka is invariably used for 'one,' yet, says Caldwell, a form has been noticed which appears to be allied to the first numeral of the Western languages,' viz., \u016bna-s 'less,' which is prefixed to some of the higher numerals to express diminution by one (e.g.) \u016bnavinshati, 'nineteen,' like the corresponding prefix un in the Latin undeviginti. \u2021 Professor Bopp is also of the same opinion; see his Comparative Grammar, i., p. 416. Where such eminent scholars have expressed an opinion, I cannot but approach the subject with great diffidence; but a careful examination forces a strong conviction into my mind, that the \u016bna in the phrase \u016bnavinshati is not allied to the Latin unus. This expression for 'nineteen' is nearly the same\n\n* 'The numerals are generally a very safe criterion of an original relationship between languages.' Pr. Max Muller's Survey of Languages, p. 13.\n\n\u2020 See Dravidian Grammar, p. 279 et seq.\n\n\u2021 ib. p. 264.\nin the Sinhalese, as *unu vissa*. It is an elliptical phrase; and though it literally means 'less twenty,' or 'incomplete twenty'; yet it conveys *ekena una vinhatih* 'twenty less by one,' or, as in *ekona-vinhatih* 'twenty minus one'\u2014'nineteen.' The *un* in the Latin word is, as I conceive, a negative prefix like the *na* in the Sanskrit *ekanna-vinhatih*, 'by one not twenty.'\n\nThis elliptical phraseology, it is curious to observe, is found in different dialects in expressing numerals; e.g. *addhena chatutto*, in the P\u0101li, is 'four by half'\u2014'four (less) by half,'\u2014'four (less) by half (of one),' [\u2014'three and a half,'] *eka* being understood as in the Sanskrit *una-vinhatih*, or in the Sinhalese *unu-vissa*. Again *dasa-ada-masa* 'ten months by half'\u2014'ten months (less) by half,' or 'ten months (less) by half (of one),' or 'nine months and a half.' This elliptical form, moreover, is the same in the Hindust\u0101ni, which has *unu-is* (=*una-bis*), although the Mur\u0101thi has *ek-un-isa*, like the Sinhalese form which we sometimes find in our books, *ek-un-visi*. The Tamil *on-badu* is indeed formed like the Hindust\u0101ni *una-bis*; but except in the principle of its formation, I perceive no analogy between the two; for whilst *una* in the latter expresses 'diminution,' the *on* in the former (*on-patu*, or *on-pattu*) denotes 'one' as in the Roman numeral ix=(i\u2014x), 'one (less) ten.'\n\nI shall next examine the names for days and months.\n\n| Days       | P\u0101li.   | Sinhalese. | Tamil.     |\n|------------|---------|------------|------------|\n| Sun-(day)  | ravi-(dina) | iri-(d\u00e0)  | n\u00e0ir-ti-(keleme) |\n| Mon.       | soma    | sandu      | tinkal     |\n| Tues.      | mangala | angaharu   | sevai      |\n| Wednes.    | budha   | bad\u00e2       | pudan      |\n| Thur's     | guru    | brahaspat\u00ee | vy\u00e2la      |\n| Fri.       | shukra  | sikur\u00e2     | velli      |\n| Satur.     | seni    | senasura   | seni       |\n\nThe above comparisons lead to this, if no other, important result,\u2014that the Sinhalese names are not derived from the Dravidian. But, the principle on which the names were originally formed\nin both is the same; for the Dravidians, who had made great strides in civilization* at the period of our colonization of this island, were doubtless acquainted with the Astronomical causes which led to the names of 'days.' The principle upon which the assignment of the days to their respective guardians was made, is indeed well known. The Sinhalese assign the days to the same planets as the Hindus and the Tamils, and if there be any difference in the names adopted, the reader will find that whilst one nation uses one word, for instance ravi, another uses a synonym for the same, as iru, and another, nair. The only peculiarity which exists in the formation of the Sinhalese and the Tamil names is, that whilst the former, like the Indo-European, adopt day after the particular name of a deity, the latter use another expression, kilamei, 'that which belongs to.' The deities or planets named are Sun, Moon, Mars (red-deity), Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn.\u2020\n\nMONTHS.\n\n| Pali. | Sinhala. | Tamil. |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| Mar. 13 | chitta | bak | chittare |\n| April 12 | ves\u00e2kha | vesak | vaik\u00e2si |\n| May 13 | jettha | poson | \u00e2ni |\n| June 14 | \u00e2s\u00e2lha | \u00e6sala | \u00e2di |\n| July 15 | {nikkhamanlya | nikini | \u00e2vanni |\n|         | s\u00e2vana |        |        |\n| Aug. 16 | {bh\u00e0dra\u2021 | binara | perc\u00ee\u00e2si |\n|         | phottap\u00e2da |        |        |\n| Sept. 16 | assayuja | vap | atpasi |\n| Oct. 16 | kattika | il | k\u00e4rtige |\n| Nov. 15 | m\u00e2gasira | undu-vap | mark\u00e2li |\n\n* See Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 54 et seq.\n\u2020 There is another peculiarity which distinguishes the mode in which the Tamils calculate the day from that in which the Sinhalese compute it; for the former reckon from mid-day to mid-day, and the latter from sun-rise to sun-rise, which is also the mode of computation in the Pali books.\n\u2021 I have here, as elsewhere, introduced the Sanskrit form to show its relation to the Sinhalese.\nThe Dravidian names of the months are derived, like the P\u0101li, from the names of the asterisms; and though the Sinhalese adopt some of them, e.g., vesak, \u0101sala, etc., yet it is very remarkable that they have for others, names which have no relation whatever to the Dravidian, and which owe their origin to local and other causes; e.g., Medin-dina denotes the month in which the sun enters the 'central meridian line'\u2014madhya-rekh\u0101,\u2014\"the line, which, passing above Lank\u0101 and Ujjayani, and touching the region of Kurukshetra, etc., goes through Meru.\"\u2020 Navam, from nava 'new,' refers to the new-ness of the vegetable kingdom, which is exhibited at this period, and means 'the spring,' when all nature is clothed with verdure. Du-rutu, from du ins. prep. and ritu 'season,' denotes the inclement season when the natives require the use of fire and firewood to keep themselves warm. Undu-vap appears to be the period when a kind of small grain called undu was (vap) 'sown.' Il denotes the month in which the moon is full, nearly in the longitude of il-val\u0101, the stars in the head of the Antelope.\u2021 Vap indicates an ad-interim season for sowing. Binara comes from the Sanskrit bh\u0101dra; and nikini from nikkhamaniya, P\u0101li, with reference to a custom of religious seclusion observed at this period. \u0100sala is from \u0101s\u0101lha, P\u0101li. Pos-on 'flower-less' is the period when flowers go out of season. Vesak is from the P\u0101li ves\u0101kha; and Bak indicates the month in which there is a 'break' in the computation of the year, though my Pandit intimates the probability of its being expressive of (bakka 'great' ==) the chief, or first month.\n\n* i.e. 'from Feb. 11th to March 12th.'\n\u2020 See S\u016brya Siddhanta, by the Rev. E.

In the formation of the plural the vernacular Tamil changes the *na* and the *ni* to *n\u00e2(n):gal* and *ni(n)gal*; and it will be shewn hereafter that this addition of *gal* bears no resemblance whatever to the *pi* which the Sinhalese adopts, nor is that plural inflexion to be found in the formation of any of the Sinhalese plural nouns. But this inquiry properly belongs to another head of our investigations, viz., the Grammatical; see infra.\n\n---\n\n* 'The very last words which we should think of borrowing from a foreign nation are pronouns, particles, and numerals'\u2014Professor Max Muller's Survey of Languages, p. 12.\n### Names\n\n*Expressive of the common wants of Mankind.*\n\n| Pali       | Sinhalese | Tamil |\n|------------|-----------|-------|\n| **Hand**   | hattha    | ata   | k\u00e0i |\n| **Foot**   | p\u00e0da      | { paya | kakula | k\u00e2l |\n| **Nose**   | n\u00e0s\u00e0      | n\u00e0sa  | m\u00fbkku |\n| **Eye**    | achchi    | \u00e6sa   | kan  |\n| **Mouth**  | vatta     | { vata | kata | v\u00e2\u00ee |\n| **Tooth**  | { danta   | data  | pallu |\n|            | data Sans.|       |       |\n| **Ear**    | kanna     | kana  | k\u00e2tu |\n| **Hair**   | kesa      | kes   | mair |\n| **Head**   | s\u00ecsa      | { sisa\u2014hisa | olu | talei |\n| **Tongue** | jivha     | diva  | n\u00e2kku |\n| **Belly**  | kuchchhi  | { kusa | bada | vayaru |\n| **Back**   | pitthi    | p\u00eeta  | mudugu |\n| **Iron**   | aya       | ya-kada | irunpu |\n| **Gold**   | { suvanna | ruvan | pon |\n|            | suvarna San. | ran |       |\n| **Silver** | raja      | rid\u00ee  | velli |\n| **Father** | p\u00eet\u00e0      | { piya | appa | appan |\n| **Mother** | amm\u00e0      | { amma | mavu | t\u00e2\u00ee |\n| **Brother**| sah\u00f2dara  | { sahodara | sohoyuru | sahodaran |\n| **Sister** | sahodari  | sahodari | tangachchi |\n| **Man**    | manussa   | minis | maniden |\n| **Woman**  | { str\u00ec san. | { itiri | stri | g\u00e6ni | manidi |\n\n---\n\nDigitized by Google\n| Pali       | Sinhalese | Tamil     |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wife      | bhariy\u00e0   | b\u00e6ri      | panch\u00e0di |\n| Child     | apachcha  | daru      | pullei   |\n| Son       | putta     | put\u00e0      | magan    |\n| Daughter  | dh\u00ectu     | d\u00fb        | magal    |\n| Slave     | d\u00e0sa      | d\u00e0sa      | ad\u00eemei   |\n|           |           | valhal    |          |\n| Cultivator| gahapati  | goyi      |          |\n| Field     | khetta    | keta      | vail     |\n|           |           | kumbura   |          |\n| Tank      | v\u00e2pi      | veva      | kulam    |\n| Plough    | nangala   | nagula    | kelappei |\n| Cow       | go        | gon       | pasu     |\n| Cattle    | yonga     | yuga      | nukam    |\n| Shepherd  | g\u00f2p\u00e0la    | gopolla   | idayan   |\n|           |           | ender\u00e0    |          |\n| God       | deva      | devi      | kadavul  |\n| Devil     | yakkha    | yak\u00e0      | pe       |\n| Sun       | sura      | hira      | suriyan  |\n| Moon      | chandra   | chandra   | tinkal   |\n|           | chanda    | handa     |          |\n| Star      | t\u00e0r\u00e0      | t\u00e0ru-k\u00e0   | nakshettra|\n| Fire      | aggini    | gini      | neruppu  |\n| Water     | v\u00e0ri      | vatura    | nir      |\n| House     | geha      | ge        | v\u00fbdu     |\n| Horse     | assa      | assa      | kudirei  |\n| Dog       | basaka    | balu      | n\u00e0i      |\n| Cat       | bil\u00e0la    | balal\u00e0    | p\u00fbnei    |\n| Cock      | kukkuta   | kukul\u00e0    | seval    |\n|           |           | sevul     |          |\n| Duck      | hasa      | hansa     | t\u00e2r\u00e2     |\n| Ass       | khara     | kotoluv\u00e2  | kaludei  |\n|           |           | kalud\u00e6v\u00e2  |          |\n| Pali   | Sinhalese | Tamil    |\n|-------|-----------|----------|\n| Camel | ottha     | ota      | ottakam |\n| Bird  | pakkhi    | { paksi  | kurulu   | kurivi  |\n|       |           | { kurulu |          |         |\n| Up    | uddhan    | uda      | m\u00eale     |\n| Near  | { samipa  | { samipa | langa    | kittu   |\n|       | { lagga   | {        |          |         |\n| Down  | hetth\u00e0    | yata     | kilei    |\n| Before| puralo    | peratu   | munnei   |\n| Far   | d\u00fbra      | dura     | t\u00fbra     |\n| Behind| pacch\u00e2    | pasu     | pinnei   |\n| Who   | { ko      | { kavuda |          | \u00e2r      |\n|       | { katara  | { kavuru |          |         |\n| What  | kim       | { kim    | mokada   | enna    |\n| Why   | kasm\u00e2     | \u00e3yi      | \u00ean       |\n| And or with saha | { saha | tavada | um-affix. |\n| But   | kintu     | { yali   | ehet     | \u00e2u\u00e2l    |\n| If    | yadi      | { nam    | idin     | \u00e2l-affix |\n| Yes   | \u00e2ma       | ovu      | \u00f4n, \u00e2m\u00e2  |\n| No    | na-no     | na-ne    | illei    |\n| Alas  | aho       | aho!     | ah!      |\n\nHere are sixty four words,\u2014not remote from ordinary use, but expressive of the common wants' of man, both in a savage and a civilized state. On examining the P\u00e2li words, it will be noticed, there is scarcely a single word which does not claim relationship with the Sanskrit. If we examine the above P\u00e2li words with their equivalents in the Sinhalese, especially as we find them in the books, we shall find the latter, with one exception, to be allied to the former. That exception is kotalu, 'ass.' But this is clearly a native word not derived from the Tamil, for the simple reason that in our modern usage we have kalud\u00e6va, which is from a Tamil\nsource, although the Tamil word itself is derived from the Sanskrit khara. Again on comparing the Sinhalese with the Tamil, we do not find a single Tamil word that has any relation to the ancient Sinhalese words of the same signification. But whilst we thus have for every Tamil word, its Sinhalese equivalent clearly allied to the P\u0101li and unconnected with the Tamil, it will be observed that there are a few Sinhalese synonymes which have some resemblance to the Tamil. These secondary formations are nine in number, and are the following, which I shall examine separately.\n\ni. The Sinhalese word kakula is supposed to have come from the Tamil kal, 'foot.' Not finding it in our books, I am inclined to treat it as a Tamil derivative; but it is very remarkable that kakula, deflected from its original signification of kal, is used to express\u2014not the 'foot,' but, the 'leg.'\n\nii. There is some distant resemblance between olu and talei, 'head'; but it is purely a native word, and does not bear any relation to the Tamil. See Siddatana\u015bar\u0101, \u00a7 22.\n\niii. Some believe that our Sinhalese bada comes from the Tamil vayaru, 'belly.' This is a mistake. The resemblance between these two words is not greater than that between bada, and the English belly or body; indeed it is reasonable to believe that it comes from the Pali bondi, 'body;' although a friend suggests that bada, as a name for the largest part of the body, may be from the North-Indian bada, 'great.'\n\niv. App\u0101, Sinhalese\u2014appen, Tamil, 'father.' I have already noticed this word, ante p. 10. I may here add that its use is confined to the colloquial language.\n\nv. Scuul, Sinhalese\u2014Savel, Tamil, 'cock.' This is clearly from the Tamil. So far as my observation goes, it has been introduced into our language within the last four hundred years.\n\nvi. T\u0101ra 'duck' is a modern introduction from the Tamil into the colloquial speech of the Sinhalese. Neither Sanskrit nor Sinhalese writers have ever drawn a distinction between the Swan and the domestic goose or duck. The word used by both for all\nthese is hansa. The very English words 'duck' and 'goose' come from the Vedic hak-gusa=hansa.\n\nvii. The Tamil kaludei 'ass,' which is evidently allied to the Sanskrit khara, has produced our Sinhalese kalud\u00e6v\u00e3. But the original Sinhalese word kota-lu is independent of the Tamil.\n\nviii. The Sinhalese word for 'bird' is paksi; but in colloquial usage we meet with kurulu, so near the Tamil kuruvi. It is not a generic term for bird, but a word for a species of small birds. See my Contributions to Oriental Literature, i. p. 44.\n\nix. There is some resemblance between the Sinhalese kittu and the Tamil kitta, 'near.' In the Sanskrit, P\u00e2li, and some of the North-Indian vernaculars the word for 'near' is nikata. This word the Sinhalese have adopted for the 'chin,' and have therefore altered the same word into kittu to denote 'nearness.' It may be thence inferred that both the Tamil and the Sinhalese words are derived from the Sanskrit.\n\nThus, in three out of the above nine words, the lexical analogies disappear on a little examination; and we have only six out of sixty-four words, or less than one-tenth of the words in the above list, which are related to the Dravidian. Yet, it is very remarkable that those six words are not what we find in the books, but what may be termed a secondary formation confined to the colloquial speech of the Sinhalese. It would thence appear that, if we dispense with all the Sinhalese words which we may trace to a Dravidian origin, we may still express ourselves on all matters with the aid of other Sinhalese words which are undoubtedly of Sanskrit origin; or, in other words, that the Sinhalese may flourish without the aid of the Dravidian.\n\nThough generally, as I have already remarked, the terminology of our classical authors is free from the Dravidian; yet, it is of some historical interest to notice here an exception. It is the Sinhalese version of the Pansiapanas J\u00e2taka, in which we find such words as the following, and which it is impossible to understand now-a-days but for the P\u00e2li work of which it is a translation; kollu and\nkanan 'a species of gram, the glycine villosa;' talakkattuva 'head-building' for 'the top of an edifice;' nadaya 'up-stair;' pambattiya 'snake charmer;' parakku 'sheet or coverlet;' pulimukham 'tiger-face;' agampadi 'body-guard, retinue,' etc., etc. The presence, however, of this foreign element in this particular Sinhalese book may be traced to the foreign Dravidian agency which was at work in the translation of the J\u00e2takas.

He next entrusted those J\u00e2takas to a learned priest named Me-\ndhankara, requesting him to have the same perpetuated without injury amongst the successive generations of his pupils. Having also established in his own name, a collegiate Temple, [he] bestowed the (following) four villages, Puranagaman [Paranagama] Sannira sela [Tembili-hela] Labuja-manda [Del-mada] and Moravanka [Moravaka].\u2019\n\n**Verbs**\n\n*[Expressive of the actions of every-day life.]*\n\n| Pali       | Sinhalese | Tamil |\n|------------|-----------|-------|\n| Be         | bh\u00fb       | vu    | iru  |\n| Go         | y\u00e2        | { ya  | pala | po   |\n|            |           | { en  | vara | va   |\n| Eat        | kh\u00e2da     | ka    | tin  |\n| Sit        | ni-sida   | indha | iru  |\n| Beat       | ghansa    | gaha  | adi  |\n| Stand      | th\u00e2-(sth\u00e2)| hiti  | nil  |\n| Die        | mara      | mara  | s\u00e2   |\n| Give       | d\u00e2        | d\u00e2    | ta   |\n| Run        | dh\u00e2va     | duva  | \u00f4du  |\n| Shoot      | vidha     | vidi  | sudu |\n| Sleep      | nidd\u00e2     | nidi  | padu |\n| Cook       | pacha     | piha  | { samei | { \u00e2kku |\n| Drink      | pa-(pibana)| bo (bona) | kudi |\n| Fall       | pata      | veta  | vilu |\n| Chew       | chabba    | vika (vi & ka) | chappu |\n| Break      | khadi     | kada  | odi  |\n| Play       | k\u00eela      | kcli  | \u00e2du  |\n| Cut        | { klipa*  | kapa  | vetta |\n|            | { chida   | sinda |       |\n\n*From kripa comes the past participle klipta\u2014Sanskrit.*\n| Pali | Sinhalese | Tamil |\n|------|-----------|-------|\n| Know | { n\u0101 | dana | ari |\n|      | j\u0101n\u0101ti |     |     |\n| Walk | \u0101hind\u0101 | sevida | nada |\n| Plough | ka-sa | h\u0101 | ulu |\n| See | { disa | daka | k\u0101n |\n|      | dakkhati |     |     |\n| Keep | { th\u0101 | taba | vai |\n|      | thapa |     |     |\n| Make | s\u0101da | sada | { panna-\u0101kku |\n| Bind | badha | banda | k\u0101tu |\n| Bite | dasa | vika | kadi |\n| Write | likha | liya | eladu |\n| Turn | parivatta | perala | tiru-pu |\n| Fill | p\u016bra | purava | nirappu |\n\nNearly every Sinhalese word is in the above list of thirty verbs allied to the Pali or the Sanskrit; and there are only two secondary forms, as in the names, which have some resemblance to the Tamil. They are pala 'go' and vara 'come'. Now, pala is not used in any of the variations of the verb, except in the second person imperative; and does not, like all other verbs, come from any radical which denotes motion, or from which the other moods and tenses are formed. The radical for 'go' in the Sinhalese is ya, from which we obtain yami 'I go;' giyemi 'I went;' yamemmi 'I shall go,' etc., with slight modifications in the other persons. So likewise va-ra 'come thou' is a form for the second person. It does not come from the root e, which alone enters into all the variations of tense and person, as emi 'I come;' \u0101(v)emi 'I came;' e nnemi 'I shall come.' The regular imperative forms of ya and e are also the following:\u2014yan, yanne 'go thou;' en, enne 'come thou;' yavu 'go ye;' evu 'come ye.'\n\nWhence then do we get these stray forms of pala and vara which we use to persons who are addressed with the offensive pronoun to? Pala is nearer the Pali paleti 'he goes' than the Tamil\npo; but vara is supposed to be from the Tamil. We thus have but one stray Dravidian form in the thirty verbs in the above list.\n\nHaving given the Sinhalese names and verbs in common use at the present day; I now proceed to examine the earliest extant Sinhalese, of which I have presented a specimen in the Sidat-Sangara, p. xxxvi; and these words, be it remembered, being found on a rock inscription (of 262 A.D.), are unadulterated by the errors of transcription.*\n\n| Pali.       | Sinhala. | Tamil. |\n|-------------|----------|-------|\n| Prosperity  | sir\u0101     | siri  | tiru |\n| Weight      | bh\u0101ra    | bara  | param |\n| Kshetriya   | khattiya | ket   | chattriya |\n| Family      | kula     | kula  | kulam |\n| Pinnacle    | kunta    | kot   | thuvi |\n| Xehwaku     | okk\u00e0ka   | ok\u00e0-vas | suvaku |\n| King        | r\u0101ja     | reja  | rasa |\n| Succession  | parampar\u0101 | parapura | parampara |\n| Descend     | bhassa   | bata  | rangu |\n| Illustrious | vasabha  | usabi | prastava-mana |\n| 'Name'      | M\u0113ghavanna | Mevan |       |\n| Great       | mahanta  | maha  | magha |\n| That        | ta       | \u00e8\u2020    | anda = \u00e2 |\n| Equal       | sama     | sama  | sama |\n| Lineage     | j\u0101ti     | jayi  | j\u0101di |\n| Anointed queen | abhis\u0113k\u0101 | bis\u014d  | rasati |\n| Regina, queen | r\u0101jan\u012b | r\u0113jana |       |\n| Womb        | kuchohhi | kusa  | kerpan |\n| Born        | upajja   | ipada | upavital |\n| First       | \u0101di-p\u0101da | sep\u00e0  | modal |\n| Enjoyed     | vinda    | vinda | anubavitta \u2020 |\n| Due-course  | pati-p\u0101ti | pilivela | kiramam |\n\n* In the above table I have given the root of every word omitting only the inflections, names and repetitions.\n\n\u2020 This comes from the Bangali e-mata.\n| Pali       | Sinhala   | Tamil    |\n|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Self      | \u00e0tuma     | tum\u00e0     | t\u00e2n     |\n| Island    | dipa      | divu     | tivu    |\n| Pleasing  | pas\u00e0da    | pahaya   | impamanei |\n| Stand     | th\u00e0       | sita     | nilta   |\n| State Canopy | chatta  | sat      | vid\u00e2nam |\n| Raised    | langa     | laga     | uyardn\u00e2 |\n| Sixteenth | s\u00f2lasa    | solos    | padin\u00e2ran |\n| Year      | sarada    | havurudu | varusam |\n| name of a month | vap | sanda | tingul |\n| Moon      | chanda    | pun     | p\u00fbrana |\n| Full      | punna     | mas     | madam |\n| Month     | m\u00e0sa      | dasa    | patt\u00e2m |\n| Tenth     | dasa      | pak     | pangu |\n| Part      | pakkha    | dava    | n\u00e2l    |\n| Day       | divasa    | veher   | alayem |\n| Temple    | vih\u00e0ra    | is\u00e0     | um     |\n| And       | saha      | vasana  | vasam  |\n| Dwelling  | vasanta   | bik     | pichcha-k\u00e2ran |\n| Beggar    | bhikkhu   | sanga   | sangam |\n| Association | sangha | himi    | sv\u00e2mi |\n| Lord      | s\u00e0mi      | sen     | kuttam |\n| Gatherings | sen\u00e2   | kara    | sey    |\n| To do     | kara      | b\u00e6      | sahodaran |\n| Brother   | bh\u00e0tu     | pera    | mun    |\n| Before    | pur\u00e2      | tubu    | vaitta |\n| Kept      | thaphita  | sirit   | valame |\n| Custom    | ch\u00e2ritta  | nija    | sonda  |\n| Own       | nija      | rus     | viruppam |\n| Desiring  | ruchi     | gena    | eduttal |\n| Taking    | gaha      | m\u00e8      | idu    |\n| This      | ima       | va\u00f1i    | poram  |\n| Is worth  | vattati   | nisi    | sari   |\n| Proper    | nichchhati|        |        |\n| Pali       | Sinhala   | Tamil    |\n|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| With and  | sah\u00e1      | h\u00e0       | um       |\n| Assimilate| sansanda  | sasad\u00e6   | opp\u00e2kku  |\n| Labourer  | kamm\u00ee     | kemi     | priy\u00e2si  |\n| Slave     | d\u00e1sa      | das      | adime    |\n| An affix  | yutta     | yutu     |          |\n| Receive   | labha     | laba     | v\u00e2ngu    |\n| Give      | d\u00e1        | d\u00e0       | kodu     |\n| Explain   | viy\u00e2karana| vivaruna*| vilakku  |\n| One       | eka       | ek       | oru      |\n\nIn the above list which contains sixty-four words, fifty seven, or nine-tenths are clearly deduced from the Pali; and of the seven words, for which I find no direct equivalents in the latter tongue, it may be remarked, five are allied to the Pali, that is to say; *eta* 'that' may be from *eta* 'this'; *biso* 'anointed queen' is from *Abhiseka* the name of the ceremony of regal anointment; *vap* is clearly derived from the Pali *vapa* 'to sow,' and thence used for 'Sep-Oct,' a period of cultivation amongst the Sinhalese; *nisi*, which here bears the secondary meaning of 'proper,' probably comes from the P\u00e2li *niehcha* 'sure,' 'certain,' 'with judgment'\u2014thence 'proper' in the Sinhalese; and *vivara* is most likely derived from the P\u00e2li *voh\u00e2ra* 'custom' or 'rules of justice'\u2014thence *voh\u00e2rika* 'a magistrate.' Of the remaining two words, one (yutu) is a native affix, and the other (is\u00e2) a native particle.\n\nA comparison of the language of the original rock Inscription, with that of the modern version (both which I have given in my Sidath-Sangar\u00e2, p. xxxvi) also establishes the fact, which has been noticed by philologers in reference to Pr\u00e2krit dialects, viz., that 'two-fold forms of the same Sanskrit words are found' in the Sinhalese\u2014one more Sanskrit, the other more Pali\u2014the latter being decidedly anterior to the former. The Rev. B. Clough has given both these forms in his Sinhalese Dictionary, sometimes omitting\n\n---\n\n* Professor Lassen's Inst. Pr\u00e2kritic\u00e6. See Introduction p. vi.\none, and sometimes the other; and this has led many Oriental scholars, and amongst them Professor Spiegel in his Kamma-v\u0101kya, to the error of believing that 'a multitude of words have been transferred from Sanskrit, and not Pali, into the Sinhalese.' Under this belief he has given two instances; and he is in error as to both.* For, kana* 'ear' is the Sinhalese for the Pali kanna, and not karna, Sanskrit\u2014and vaira is the modern form of the ancient Sinhalese vera,\u2020 so much nearer the Pali than the Sanskrit form of the word for 'enmity.' The use of the visarga, which has nearly disappeared from the Pali, is indeed quite unknown in the Sinhalese; and in the latter language the word 'pain' is not dukha but duk from the Pali dukkha. Such speculations as those to which Professor Spiegel refers, and which I give in the note below,\u2021 has made him say\u2014\"Propius adhuc Elu ad linguam Sanscritam accedere, quin etiam originem ex ea ducere fertur, quod tamen addubitamus, ipsius Cloughi verbis innisi, quia Raskius, lingua Singhalensem numero dikhani carum esse adscribendam, certissimis probavit testimoniis.\"\u2014Kammav\u0101kya pp. vi. vii.\n\nAll my observations in this chapter will serve as a running commentary on the above remarks; and the question as to the Sinhalese being one of the Dekkhanse, or of the Malay-Polynesian group of languages, is also disproved by the positive proof of the near relationship which I have throughout exhibited between the Sinhalese and the Pali.\n\nOn comparing, moreover, the Tamil words in the above list, consisting of 64 words, (of which we shall for obvious reasons exclude two, Meghavanna and yutta) with the Sinhalese, it is quite clear that the relation which the 28 italicised Tamil words\n\n* See Namavaliya, p. 44.\n\u2020 ib., p. 18.\n\u2021 'Eloo has undoubtedly given birth to the vernacular language of this Country. It appears to claim great antiquity, and being derived from Sanskrit, a great portion of her may be traced from that source.' Clough's Sinhalese Dictionary, p. ii.\nbear to the Sinhalese is not direct, that they are derived from the Sanskrit, sometimes from the same word from which the Sinhalese is derived, and sometimes from another Sanskrit word of the same signification, e.g. *anubavitta*; and that of the remaining 29 words not a single one, so far as I can speak on the subject, has any relation to the Sinhalese, whilst every one of the 64 Sinhalese words with the exception of *e*, (*ep\u0101* and *vap*) is directly derived from the P\u0101li. So that the result is 'that the Sinhalese, as it is spoken at the present day, and still more strikingly as it exists as a written language' in the uncorrupted tablets of rocks in this island, presents 'unequivocal proof' of its independence of the Dravidian, and of its affinity with Sanskrit dialects.\n\nLastly, on a careful comparison of the old Sinhalese (which is usually denominated the *Elu*) with the P\u0101li and the Tamil, nearly every word of the first is found to be derived from the P\u0101li, and not the Dravidian. Let us take, for instance, the first thirty words in the alphabetical Index of the Revd. C. Alwis' version of the *N\u00e0m\u00e0valiya*, avoiding proper names and different forms of the same words, and compare them with the Pali and Tamil words of the same significations.\n\n| Pali       | Sinhalese | Tamil |\n|------------|-----------|-------|\n| Eye        | akkha     | ak    | kan |\n| Lightning  | asani     | akana | min |\n| Canopy     | \u00e0k\u00e0sa vit\u00e0na | akasana | met-katti |\n| Letter     | akkhara   | akura | Akkara Elattu |\n| Goad       | ankusa    | akussa | ankusa turatti |\n| Demerit    | akusala   | akusala | p\u00e0vam |\n| Anger      | akk\u00f2sa    | akos  | kovam |\n| End        | agga      | aga   | mudivu |\n| Depth      | agadha    | agada | \u00e2lam |\n| Value      | aggha     | agaya | perumati |\n| Unction    | angar\u00e0ga  | agar\u00e0 | abishekam |\n\nDigitized by Google\n| Pali.       | Sinhalese. | Tamil. |\n|------------|------------|--------|\n| Ditch      | ag\u00e2dha     | agala  | akal   |\n| Longwood   | { agaru    | agil   | akil   |\n|            | { akalu    |        |        |\n| Body       | anga       | anga   | { angam |\n|            |            |        | { seriram |\n| Woman      | angan\u00e0     | angana | manas\u00ee |\n| Market assembly | ang\u00e2ne | angani | ank\u00e2di |\n| Mars       | ang\u00e0ra     | angaharu | Sevei |\n| A creeper  | ankola     | anguna | kurinji |\n| Ring       | anguliyaka | anguva | modiran |\n| Ram        | aja        | aja    | \u00e2du    |\n| Eight      | attha      | ata    | ettu   |\n| Eight tastes | attha-rasa | atla-rasa | ashta-suwe |\n| Tower      | att\u00e0la     | atalla | att\u00e0la |\n| Joy        | p\u00eet\u00ee       | af\u00ee    | av\u00e2    |\n| Half       | addha      | ada    | p\u00e2di   |\n| Forest     | atavi      | adavi  | k\u00e2du   |\n| Less       | addha      | adu    | korenda |\n| Body.

They are ag\u00e2dha, ankola, p\u00eet\u00ee and sakka. Now agadha means 'exceedingly deep,' and from it comes our agala 'ditch.' The resemblance between Anguna and ankola ('Alangium hexapetalum') is apparent; since the substitution of n for l is frequent in the Sinhalese, and also the interchange of k and g. Thus lel\u00e2ta becomes nal\u00e2ta 'forehead;' velando is sometimes expressed venado 'merchants;' and the l in el-biju 'cardamum' is sometimes changed into n, as in en-sal, 's\u00e2l' being another word for 'biju.' P\u00eet\u00ee may or may not be the source from whence we get atta; and though atta does not come from sakku, yet it is clear that the former\ncomes from *hattha* in the sense of an 'arm' of a tree. Even if we except the first and the two last of these four words, the result of the comparison is that in the above list but one Tamil word (akal) bears a relation to the Sinhalese, and that more than nine-tenths of the words in the Sinhalese, especially 'as it exists as a written language in the literature of this island,' is traceable to a Pali origin, exhibiting evidence, in some important particulars, that the corruption of the Pali into the Sinhalese has arisen from that natural process of change which we see exemplified in Europe in the corruption of the Latin into the Italian and the French.\n\nA careful inter-comparison of Indian dialects with one another, and the Sinhalese with them, also furnishes us with proof confirmatory of the Historical fact\u2014that the Sinhalese was imported into Ceylon by its first Colonists\u2020 from North-India.\n\nMr. Caldwell, who may be regarded as the best authority in all matters relating to Dravidian languages, states:\u2014'The Scythian or Dravidian element is substantially one and the same in all the vernacular languages of India, whether Northern or Southern, but is smallest in amount in those districts of Northern India which were first conquered by the Aryans; greater in the remoter districts of the Dekhan, Telingana, and Mysore; and greatest of all in the Tamil country, at the Southern extremity of the peninsula, to\n\n---\n\n* \"But the Sinhalese, the vernacular language of the Island, is decidedly allied to the Northern family, as it is supposed to have nine-tenths of its vocables from the Sanskrit\"\u2014The Rev. S. Hardy, in C. B. A. S. Journal, ii. p. 92.\n\n\u2020 'At the place where mention is made of 'Sihala language,' what can Sihala language signify? As it is said that king Sihabahu took Siha captive, so the name Siha-la is derived from that circumstance,..............As, again, the city in which Sakra dwells is named Sakra-city, so the Island in which the Sihala dwell is called Sihala-island. As also people who are natives of a place speak in their native tongue, so likewise the people of this Sihala country make use of the Sihala speech\u2014their language is thence named the Sihala language.'\u2014Pradipika, quoted in the Siddhantangarha, p. xxx.\nwhich the aggressions of the Brahmanical race had not extended in the age of Manu and the R\u00e2m\u00e2yana.' p. 39.\n\nThis state of things precisely accords with the facts stated in Sinhalese Historical records. For, if the Sinhalese was not imported in an early age into Ceylon from North-India, it is but reasonable to find that the Dravidian element, which grows great and greater as we come downwards to the South, would be the greatest in Ceylon, the most distant territory from North-India. Far from such being the fact all the comparisons to which I have submitted the Sinhalese, indisputably prove that the Dravidian element is even less in the Sinhalese than 'in those districts of Northern India which were first conquered by the Aryans.' No one therefore, knowing the position which, geographically, Ceylon occupies in regard to the Tamil country,* can reconcile this fact with the supposition that the Sinhalese is a South-Indian dialect. On the contrary, the conviction must be inevitable, that the Sinhalese, like the M\u00e2gadhi or the Pali,\u2020 had been long separated from Northern-India, and had remained fixed in this Island, unaffected by those changes which even the Maharashtri, the dialectus principis of Varanasi and Lassen, and other undoubted dialects of the Sanskrit, have in course of time undergone in India.\n\nWithout entering into other inquiries as to how far the one-tenth (I believe the proportion is really less), the apparently Dravidian element in the Sinhalese, may be traced to other influences and causes, enough, I believe, has been shown to justify the position which I maintain, that our vocabulary presents more cogent evidence than even any of the vernacular dialects of Northern India, of the Sinhalese language having a Sanskrit basis with a very small admixture of a foreign or non-Sanskrit element. In a case\n\n* 'From the evidence of the words in use amongst the early Tamilians,' Mr. Caldwell deduces, amongst other facts, that they had 'no acquaintance with any people beyond sea, except in Ceylon, which was then accessible on foot at low water.' p. 79.\n\n\u2020 Kachchh\u00e2yana's Grammar, p. cvi.\nlike this where all *lexical* analogies tend to establish a close affinity to languages which are already ascertained to have sprung from a Sanskrit source, I may indeed close the inquiry without at all consulting *Grammar*. But, when with the evidence furnished by the Dictionary we couple the testimony of History, and also find historical facts confirmed by the analogies to which I have already directed attention, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the Sinhalese is a legitimate descendant of the Sanskrit.\n\n**SECTION FOURTH.**\n\n**Grammatical Relations.**\n\n'The life and soul of a language, that which constitutes its substantial individuality, and distinguishes it from all others,' says Professor Max Muller, 'is its *Grammar*.' In accordance with this undoubted belief, I purpose in this section, to examine the Grammatical forms of the Sinhalese with a view to ascertain whether they have been imported from the South-Indian, or from the Sanskrit family of languages. In doing so I may as well intitiate that I do not intend to enter into an investigation of all grammatical forms, but of such only as have been pointed out as possessing an intimate relationship between the Dravidian and the North-Indian (in which the Sinhalese has been included by some), and also a few of such other forms as may throw light upon the inquiry in hand.\n\nThe reader who has followed me through a variety of comparisons of words, with overwhelming results in favor of the proposition with which I have set out, must already be prepared to find the Grammatical structure of our language to accord more intimately with the Sanskrit than with the Dravidian. In this hope he will not indeed be disappointed; but it is, perhaps, right to mention that the Sinhalese have also adopted some forms which bear some affinity to the Dravidian. Founded upon a few coincidences between the Dravidian and the North-Indian vernaculars, in which last I include the Sinhalese, it has been suggested that it would be more correct to represent\nthe latter as having a Scythian basis with a large and almost overwhelming Sanskrit addition, than as having a Sanskrit basis with a small admixture of a Scythian element. The reverse however of this proposition seems to be correct. For, though Grammar is the best test that may be applied in philological investigations, yet the existence of a stray Dravidian Grammatical form here and there can, no more than a few Dravidian words, be regarded as decisive of the question. 'In general, it appears,' says Bopp,* 'that in warm regions languages, when they have once burst the old grammatical chain, hasten to their downfall with a far more rapid step than under our milder European sun.' Now, in Ceylon, it is the influence not only of climate, but of circumstances, that has led to a departure from the original grammatical forms and the adoption of others savouring of idioms, peculiar expressions, etc. These analogies will find a solution in the continuous intercourse which we have had with the Dravidians for 24 centuries,\u2014daily speaking their language, and wishing not only to understand them, but to be understood by them. In this state of things it is but natural to find that we, like 'the Bengali and other new Indian idioms, have really laid aside our old grammatical habiliments, and have partly put on new.'* But I can promise at the outset, that the changes which our grammatical forms have undergone, are far fewer in number than have been experienced by the Northern vernaculars.\n\nSupposing, however, for the sake of argument, that they are identically the same in the North-Indian vernaculars and the Sinhalese, it is well worthy of consideration, whether the coincidences might not have originated from other than Dravidian influences. Mr. Caldwell, even without the evidence which I have already adduced, and have yet to adduce, has arrived at this conclusion. What he says, in the following extract, of those idioms, applies equally to the Sinhalese:\u2014\"Whatever relationship, in point\n\n* Bopp's Comp. Grammar, vol. ii. p. 711.\nof blood and race, may originally have subsisted between the northern aborigines and the southern\u2014whatever ethnological evidences of their identity may be supposed to exist,\u2014when we view the question philologically, and with reference to the evidence which is furnished by their languages alone, the hypothesis of their identity does not appear to me to have been established. It may be true that various analogies in point of grammatical structure appear to connect the Un-Sanscrit element, which is contained in the North-Indian idioms, with the Scythian or Tartar tongues. This connection, however, amounts only to a general relationship to the entire group of Scythian languages; and no special relationship to the Dr\u00e2vidian languages, in contra-distinction to those of the Turkish, the Finnish, or any other Scythian family, has yet been proved to exist. Indeed I conceive that the Scythian substratum of the North-Indian idioms presents a greater number of points of agreement with the Oriental Turkish, or with that Scythian tongue or family of tongues by which the New Persian has been modified, than with any of the Dr\u00e2vidian languages.\n\n\"The principal particulars in which the grammar of the North-Indian idioms accords with that of the Dr\u00e2vidian languages are as follows:\u2014(1), the inflexion of nouns by means of separate post-fixed particles; (2), the inflexion of the plural by annexing to the unvarying sign of plurality the same suffixes of case as those by which the singular is inflected; (3), the use of a dative or dative-accusative in 'k\u00f4' or 'ku;' (4), the use in several of the northern idioms of two pronouns of the first person plural, the one including, the other excluding the party addressed; (5), the use of post-positions, instead of prepositions; (6), the formation of verbal tenses by means of participles; (7), the situation of the governing word after the word governed. In the particulars above-mentioned the grammar of the North-Indian idioms undoubtedly resembles that of the Dr\u00e2vidian family: but the argument founded upon this general agreement is to a considerable extent neutralised by the circumstance that those idioms accord in the very same particulars, and\nto the very same extent, with the Turkish and several other families of the Scythian group. Not one of those particulars in which the Dravidian languages differ from the Turkish or the Mongolians (and there are many such points of difference) has as yet been discovered in the North-Indian idioms. For instance, those idioms contain no trace of the relative participle which is used in all the Dravidian tongues instead of a relative pronoun; they are destitute of the regularly inflected negative verb of the Dravidian languages; and they contain not one of the Dravidian pronouns or numerals\u2014not even those which we find in the Scythic tablets of Behistan, and which still survive even in the languages of the Ostiaks and Lapps. If the Un-Sanscrit element contained in the northern vernaculars had been Dravidian we might also expect to find in their vocabularies a few primary Dravidian roots\u2014such as the words for 'head,' 'hand,' 'foot,' 'eye,' 'ear,' &c.; but I have not been able to discover any reliable analogy in words belonging to this class. The only resemblances which have been pointed out are those which Dr. Stevenson has traced in a few words remote from ordinary use, and on which, in the absence of analogy in primary roots, and especially in grammatical structure, it is impossible to place any dependence. The difference between the Dravidian vocabulary and that of the languages of Northern India with respect to primary roots together with the essential agreement of all the Dravidian vocabularies one with another, will appear from the following comparative view of the pronouns of the first and second person singular.* It sometimes happens that where one form of the pronoun is used in the nominative, another survives in the oblique cases, and a third in the verbal inflexions: it also sometimes happens that the ancient form of the pronoun differs from the modern. Where such is the case I have given all extant forms a place in the list, for the purpose of facilitating comparison.\n\n* To which I have taken the liberty to add the Sinhalese pronouns.\nPronoun of the first person singular:\n\n**North-Indian Idioms.**\n\n(Sanskrit primary form 'aham;' secondary forms, 'ma,' 'mi,' 'mi;' Turkish primary form, 'man.')\n\n| Language   | Form |\n|------------|------|\n| Hindi      | main |\n| Bengali    | m\u00fai  |\n| Marathi    | mi   |\n| Gujarathi  | hua  |\n| Sindhi     | man  |\n| Sinhalese  | man  |\n\n**Dravidian Idioms.**\n\n| Language   | Form |\n|------------|------|\n| Tamil      | n\u0101n, y\u0101n, \u0113n, en |\n| Canarese   | \u0101n, n\u0101nu, en, \u0113ne |\n| Tulu       | y\u0101n, en, e |\n| Malayalam  | nj\u0101n, \u0113n, en, in |\n| Telugu     | n\u0113nu, n\u0101 |\n| Tuda       | \u014dn, \u0101n, en, ini |\n| K\u014dta       | \u0101ne, en, e |\n| G\u014dnd       | \u0101ne, \u0113n |\n| Ku         | \u0101nu, n\u0101, \u0113nu, e |\n| Rajmahal   | en    |\n| Uraon      | enan  |\n\nPronoun of the second person singular:\n\n**North-Indian Idioms.**\n\n(Sanskrit primary forms 'tvam,' 'tav,' 'te;' secondary form, 'si,' 's;' Turkish primary form, 'sen.')\n\n| Language   | Form |\n|------------|------|\n| Hindi      | tun, tu, te |\n| Bengali    | th\u012b, to |\n| Marathi    | t\u016bn, tu, to |\n| Gujarathi  | t\u016bn, ta |\n| Sindhi     | tun, to |\n| Sinhalese  | ta, to |\n\n**Dravidian Idioms.**\n\n| Language   | Form |\n|------------|------|\n| Tamil      | ni, nin, nei, i |\n| Canarese   | nin, n\u012bnu, t, i |\n| Tulu       | t, ni, nin |\n| Malayalam  | ni, nin, nan |\n| Telugu     | n\u012bvu, ni, nin |\n| Tuda       | nt, nin, i |\n| Kota       | nt, nin, i |\n| G\u014dnd       | ima, nt, i |\n| Ku         | \u012bnu, nt, i |\n| Uraon      | nien |\n| Rajmahal   | nin |\n| Brahui     | ni |\n\n*Scythic of the Behistun tablets of*\n\n\"From the striking dissimilarity existing between the North-Indian pronouns and the Dravidian, it is obvious that, whatever\n\n---\n\n*Toa-m becomes tuva-m in the old Persian; and from tu (itself derived from tu) proceeds the Sanskrit dative tu-bhayam, the base of which is allied to, or identical with, the Latin, Armenian, and Pehlvi tu, the \u00c6olic and Doric tu, the Persian, Afghan, and Sinhalese to, and the Gothic thu.

In the pronouns of almost all the North-Indian languages, the Scythian termination\u2014the obscure 'n' which forms the final of most of the pronouns\u2014is at once observed. We cannot fail also to notice the entire disappearance of the nominative of the Sanscrit pronoun of the first person singular, and the substitution for it of the Turkish 'men' or 'man:' but in no connexion, in no number or case, in no compound or verbal inflexion, do we see the least trace of the peculiar personal pronouns of the Dravidian family. Possibly, after all, further research may disclose the existence in the northern vernaculars of distinctively Dravidian forms and roots; but their existence does not appear to me as yet to be proved; for most of Dr. Stevenson's analogies take too wide a range, and where they are supposed to be distinctively Dravidian, they invariably disappear on examination. I conclude, therefore, that the Un-Sanscrit portion of the northern languages cannot safely be placed in the same category with the southern, except perhaps in the sense of both being Scythian rather than Indo-European.\"\n\np. 42.\n\nIn addition to the Grammatical relations which may be deduced from the Lexical analogies, to which I have already alluded, I shall now proceed with further proof, noticing in the course of my observations the coincidences to which Dr. Stevenson and Mr. Caldwell have attracted attention. My remarks and investigations will here be confined to (1) Formation of Words; (2) Nouns,\u2014their gender, number, declension, inflexional and periphrastic; (3) Cases, the nominative, the vocative, the accusative, the instrumental, the auxiliary, the dative, the genitive, the locative, and the ablative; (4) Adjectives; (5) Pronouns,\u2014personal, intensive, demonstrative, and interrogative; (6) Propositions; (7) Verbs,\u2014the negative, and passive voices, the causal and auxiliary verb; (8) Conjugations,\u2014the present, past, and future tense, the participle and the infinitive; (9) the Relative Participal Adjective, (10) Adverbs.\nFORMATION OF WORDS.\n\ni. The Dravidian dialects differ from the Sanskrit in generally using the crude root of the verb as the imperative of the second person singular. This, I venture to assert, was not the principle upon which that mood of the verb was originally formed in the Sinhalese. The Sidatsangar\u00e0 gives (see p. 61) four inflexions, and the Sinhalese scholar knows that in practice we use a variety of other honorific terminations to suit the peculiar position of the party addressed.* Take for instance the radical ka, 'eat.' If we tell one ka eka, no one will understand the ka in the sense of an imperative; to convey which it would be necessary to say kanu, ka-nne, k\u00e0-piya. So likewise denu, denne, diya, to form the imperative of de 'give;' karanu, karanne, karava, kara-piya, to express the imperative kara, 'do;' etc. The general rule in the Sidatsangar\u00e0 is that the imperative takes 'nu' for its inflexion as karanu bajanu; see \u00a7 58. There is however an occasional exception to this rule, which favors the Dravidian principle when the radical ends with a, as boja, 'eat,' and bala, 'behold.' But this is of very rare occurrence, for even in those cases the Sinhalese, in order to mark the imperative mood unmistakably, adds a va to the root, as balava, 'behold.' See Sinhalese version of Mat. cap. iii. 16, 17, given in my Contributions to Oriental Literature, vol. i. p. 95. The peculiarity here noticed, and which is the rule in the Dravidian dialects, can therefore only be regarded as an exceptional usage in the Sinhalese.\n\nii. The Dravidians obtain many words for ordinary objects from verbal roots. Thus adi is both 'beat' and 'blow'; nilam 'ground' comes from nil 'to stand;' m\u0101du 'ox,' from m\u0101du, Canarese 'to do;' \u0101du 'sheep' from adu 'to frisk;' kurangu 'monkey,' from kura 'to sound;' pakal 'day,' from pagu 'to portion;' kan 'eye,' from kan 'to see;' mukku 'nose,' from mugu Canareso 'to smell,' etc. etc. For all these names, I need scarcely say, we have differ-\n\n* See Article on Terms of Address in Ceylon. A. S. Journal for 1856\u20148.\nent Sinhalese words, derived from different radicals, which bear the closest affinity to the Sanskrit or P\u0101li.\n\nI shall tabularize them as follows:\n\n| Pali    | Sinhalese | Tamil |\n|---------|-----------|-------|\n| Ground  | bh\u00fbmi     | bima  | nilam |\n| Ox      | gava      | gon   | m\u00e2du  |\n| Goat    | aja       | { aja | elu   | \u00e2du   |\n| Monkey  | v\u00e2-nara   | { \u00e2ndur\u00e2 | ril\u00e2 | kurangu |\n| Day     | d\u00e2        | d\u00e2    | pakal |\n| Eye     | achchi    | \u00e6sa   | kan   |\n| Nose    | n\u00e2sa      | n\u00e2sa  | mukku |\n| Hand    | hattha    | ata   | kai   |\n\niii. As the Dravidian dialects adopt a class of derivative words, which in the Sanskrit family may be treated as primitives, so likewise where the latter class of languages, especially the Sinhalese, adopt different appropriate masculine and feminine names, the former simply alter the masculine into the feminine by inflexion; e.g.\n\n| Pali    | Sinhalese | Tamil |\n|---------|-----------|-------|\n| Man     | manussa   | minis | maniden |\n| Wo-man  | itthi     | { itiri | g\u00e6n\u00ee | manidl |\n| Son     | putta     | put\u00e2  | makan |\n| Daughter| dbitu     | d\u00fb    | makal |\n| King    | r\u00e2ja      | r\u00e2ja  | r\u00e2s\u00e2 |\n| Queen   | r\u00e2jani    | biso  | r\u00e2s\u00e2ti |\n| He      | so        | ohu   | avan |\n| She     | s\u00e2        | \u00e6    | aval |\n\niv. No one conversant with the Tamil can fail to have observed the successive formative and inflexional particles and pronominal fragments which are added to a Dravidian monosyllabic root; as per-ugugiradu \u2018it increases\u2019 from per. This expansion is not found in the Sinhalese, which hardly takes a termination of more than two\nsyllables; as *bebili-ni* 'it brightens.' Examine the nominal roots in the Sidatsangar\u00e2, \u00a7 58.\n\nv. The Dravidian formatives are chiefly gu, ngu, kku==ch or nchu, su or chu, du, ndu, ttu, bu, mbu or ppu. The Sinhalese possesses none of these. It takes others such as a *va*, i, ta, *vat*, etc. Take, for instance, the Tamil *pada-gu* 'boat;' the Sinhalese cuts off the formative, and adopts simple *p\u00e2da*, or adds a *va* to it, whence it becomes *p\u00e2ru-va*. For the Sinhalese inflexical terminations, See Sidatsangar\u00e2, \u00a7 58.\n\nvi. In the formation of the adjective from the noun, the Dravidian presents a peculiarity distinguishable from the Sinhalese. For this purpose, or for qualifying another noun, or for converting an intransitive into a transitive verb, or for the purpose of forming a noun from verbal themes, the Tamil has to reduplicate the final consonant. This process of reduplication is unknown to the Sinhalese. E.g.; from *harak* 'ox' (Sinhalese) is formed *harak-hama* 'ox-hide;' but from *m\u00e2du* 'ox' (Tamil) is formed *mattu-(t)-tol* 'ox-hide.' Also, from *duva* (Sinhalese) 'run' comes *duva-va* 'cause to run,' so much like the Sanskrit *ya*; whilst the Tamil would reduplicate the *d* (=t) in *odu* and render it *ottn*. Again, whilst the Tamil cannot obtain *elattu* 'writing' without reduplicating the *d* (=t) in *eladu* 'writing,' the Sinhalese converts the simple radical with a single *m*; as *liya* 'write;' *liyu-ma* 'writing.'\n\nvii. The formation of compounds in the Sinhalese is entirely after the fashion of Sanskrit compounds. See Sidatsangara \u00a7 35.\n\nviii. The Sanskrit and some of the Indo-European dialects are fond of combining clashing consonants. The Dravidian dialects, on the contrary, aim at ease and softness, and are unable to utter two consonants of different classes as *sv\u00e2mi* without introducing a vowel between them, as *suv\u00e2mi*, or without cutting off one of the consonants as in *s\u00e2mi*. In this respect the Sinhalese resembles the Dravidian; but I must warn the reader against any inference therefrom that the Sinhalese is related to the Dravidian. For, it will be observed that this is a peculiarity which distinguishes the\nSanskrit from not only the Sinhalese but its very parent the P\u0101li, and other Prakrits of undoubtedly Sanskrit origin. This will be rendered manifest by the following table of Sanskrit, Pali, and Sinhalese words, which show the growing reluctance with which each generation has cast away, what even all Northerners must admit, the difficulty of expressing heterogeneous sounds, as in the following:\n\n| Sanskrit | Pali | Sinhalese |\n|----------|------|-----------|\n| Head     | sirsa | s\u012bsa      | hisa    |\n| Full     | p\u016br\u1e47a | punna     | pun     |\n| Limb     | g\u0101tra | gatta     | gat     |\n| Raiment  | vastra | vattha   | vat     |\n| Mouth    | vaktra | vatta    | vat     |\n| Eye      | netra | netta     | net     |\n| Demon    | r\u0101ksha | rukkha   | rakus   |\n| Heaven   | svarga | sagga    | saga    |\n| Pearl    | mukta | mutta     | mutu    |\n| Name     | Laksma\u1e47a | Lakkhana | Lakkana |\n| Agent    | kartru | kattu    | katu    |\n| Above    | \u0101rdhv\u0101n | uddhan  | uda     |\n\nix. Another peculiarity observable in the formation of words may here be mentioned. Whilst, as a general rule, in the Dravidian, as in the Scythian family of tongues, 'neither the vowel nor the consonant (or consonants) of which the root is composed, sustains any change or modification on the addition of the signs of gender, number, and case, or of person, tense, and mood; which are successively agglutinated to the root, not welded into combination with it,'*\u2014the vowels in the Sinhalese as well as in the Indo-European radical, are, in general, modified by the addition of the suffixes of case and tense. E.g. the Sinhalese word kolu 'boy,' which comes from keli 'to sport,' is changed into kolla in the masculine, and keli in the feminine. The word balu 'dog' be-\n\n*Caldwell, p. 164.\ncomes ball\u00e0 in the singular,\u2014and ball\u00f3 in the plural. The same word serves as an example of the change which it undergoes in the different cases. Again, the root daka 'to see,' becomes daki-mi 'I see' in the present tense; duti-mi 'I saw' in the past tense; dakinnemi 'I shall see' in the future tense; and daeka 'having seen' in the participle.*\n\nNoun.\n\nGender\u2014In entering upon the Noun, its Gender demands attention first. The Sanskrit family recognize besides the two natural genders, another\u2014the neuter or the eunuch. To the Sinhalese are, however, known only the two first.\u2020 See Sidatsangar\u00e2, \u00a7 24. This is quite consistent with the practice of the Sanskrit. For, although the kltva, according to its original intention, had to represent inanimate nature only; yet when it is remembered that it has not everywhere confined itself to these old limits, and that the Sanskrit imparts life to what is inanimate, and, on the other hand, (according to the view then taken), impairs the personality of what is by nature animate; (Bopp. i. p. 126), a language formed\n\n* For different other changes which the radical undergoes, see my Introduction to Sinhalese Grammar, p. 17 et seq.\n\n\u2020 In the Dravidian languages all nouns denoting inanimate substances and irrational beings are of the neuter gender. The distinction of male and female appears only in the pronouns of the third person; in the adjectives (properly appellative nouns) which denote rational beings, and are formed by suffixing the pronominal terminations; and in the third person of the verb, which, being formed by suffixing the same pronominal terminations, has three forms in the singular and two in the plural, to distinguish the several genders, and in accordance with the pronouns of the third person. In all other cases where it is required to mark the distinction of gender, separate words signifying 'male' and 'female' are prefixed; but, even in such cases, though the object denoted be the male or female of an animal, the noun which denotes it does not cease to be considered neuter, and neuter forms of the pronoun and verb are required to be conjoined with it. This rule presents a marked contrast to the rules respecting gender which we find in the vivid and highly imaginative Sanscrit, and in the other Indo-European languages, but it accords with the usage of all the languages of the Scythian group. Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 34.\nfrom it is sure to fail in recognizing the intention which was not carried out in practice; and in its endeavour to simplify Grammatical forms, is likely, as the Sinhalese has done, to make a distribution of all nature into two classes, the male and female. The rationale of this is to be found in various other parts of our Grammatical System.\n\nIt appears very plainly that this absence of the neuter gender is owing to an effort on the part of the Sinhalese to simplify the difficult process of discriminating the genders in the Sanskrit, and to adopt itself to circumstances, one of which is the absence in the Sinhalese of that simple termination which the Sanskrit has adopted for the neuter as distinguishable from the masculine and feminine. Now, according to the formation of words in the Sinhalese, no system of Grammar or philology can devise a rational plan by which the neuter may be distinguished from the two natural genders. If the neuter was confined to inanimate nature alone, this would be possible; but when the greater part of names expressive of inanimate nature are found as masculines and feminines, there was no alternative but to ignore the neuter altogether. This reasoning would be inadmissible but for the undoubted testimony which this very department of Grammar furnishes us as to the Sinhalese being a derivative of the P\u00e2li and Sanskrit. I here allude to the rule by which all Sanskrit and P\u00e2li neuter names are regarded in the Sinhalese as masculine. See note (\u2020) at p. 20 of the Sidatsangara. The formation too, of the two natural genders is precisely in accordance with the development of the Sanskrit, the feminine marking its distinction by broader and more sonant vowels.\n\nWhen, however, we look to the Tamil which has all the three genders, and therefore is different from the Sinhalese, we observe that not only are all nouns denoting inanimate objects and irrational beings, placed in the neuter gender; but in most cases separate words denoting male or female are added to neuter nouns. It would also seem, that the long \u012b, which constitutes the rule in the formation of the Sinhalese and the Sanskrit feminine, forms the exception in the Dravidian dialects. See Caldwell, p. 181.\nNumber.\u2014In turning our attention to the Number of the Sinhalese noun, we again meet with evidence of an effort to simplify the superabundant forms of the Sanskrit. 'The dual,' says Bopp, 'like the neuter, in course of time is the first to be lost with the weakening of the vitality of the view taken by the same, or is more and more straitened in its use, and then replaced by the abstract plural expressive of infinite number.' Vol. i. p. 126. 'The P\u0101li has only so much of the dual as the Latin viz., a remnant of it in two words, which signify two and both.' p. 127. It is entirely wanting in the Pr\u0101krits as in the Sinhalese, which does not even recognize the duality of the pronoun adopted by the Tamils in common with the Northern vernaculars. See remarks thereon infra.\n\nDeclension.\u2014The Sinhalese, like some of the Dravidian dialects, is not deficient in the number of cases required to mark the relations of nouns. Unlike the Sanskrit, the Sinhalese employs the crude radical without inflexion,* and therefore attempts to simplify a variety of forms which even the Sanskrit has declined to adopt in the primary forms of compounds; yet the rule in Sinhalese Grammar is, as in the Sanskrit, to inflect the noun to express the different relations of case. It is unnecessary to specify all the modifications which nouns undergo. They are all given in the Sidatsangar\u0101, p. 27.* Suffice it to present two declensions.\n\n**Sanda\u2014Tingel, 'Moon.'**\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Sinhalese | Tamil |\n| No. Sanda | Tingel |\n| Vo.

As in the primitive Indo-European tongues, the plural of a Sinhalese word is carefully distinguished from the singular. It is true that in modern usage we find a few nouns which take in the plural val, like the Tamil gal, but it should be borne in mind that that formative is not an inflexion, but that which may be regarded as a complete word by itself, serving, when added to nouns indicating inanimate objects, to render the expression a compound, like 'stone-heap' or 'trees-mass.' Thus ge, 'house,' becomes in the plural ge-val.\n\n* The Dravidian nominative singular is simply the inflexional base. Caldwell, p. 204.\n\n\u2020 The signs of cases are suffixed to the sign of plurality in the Dravidian.\nThis is supposed by some to be identical with the *gal* in the Tamil *uttu-gal*, 'houses.' Dr. Stevenson is of opinion that this addition is an abbreviation of the Sanskrit *sakala* (=*sagala*, Tamil) 'all.' But, says Caldwell, the root signifying *all*, which the Dravidians have preferred to retain, viz., *ell*, is connected, not with the [Greek] *ol* 'whole,' the Hebrew *kol*, &c., but with the Saxon *eal*, English *all*. Whether it comes from the one or the other, it is indeed very clear that this addition of pluralization conveys, like the Sinhalese word *siy-al*\u2014'all.' Now in the Sinhalese only a few inanimate nouns take this *val* as a sign of pluralization; and in some instances it is found in the oblique cases, and never in the nominative; thus *ata* 'hand,' *at* 'hands' *at-vala* 'in hands;' *gasa* 'tree,' *gas* 'trees,' *gas-vala* 'in trees.' Hence it accords well with Professor Max Muller's belief of this being a compound expression like *animal-mass* for 'animals,' or *stone-heap* for 'stones.'\n\nThere is another reason which induces me to believe that this *val*, in the sense of *vana* for a 'mass,' is a word by itself. It is this,\u2014that like *val* the Sinhalese occasionally takes *vara* in a few nouns for the formation of the plural, as *guru* 'teacher,' *guru-varu* 'teachers'; *raja* 'king,' *raja-varu* 'kings.' In these instances *vara* is clearly an additional word to denote 'respect;' for it will be seen that as the plural of both words is ordinarily formed by the addition of (h)*u*, as *guru*, *guruhu*; *raja*, *rajahu*, they take the same *u* in the plural even after the addition of *vara*; and that this *varu*-termination is never used except in connection with masculine or feminine names that deserve respect, as *val* is seldom used except in connection with inanimate nouns implying objects that are usually associated in the mind with *heap* or *mass.*\n\nThe Sinhalese has also, like some of the Scythian tongues, a secondary or periphrastic mode of denoting some of the relations of nouns, and in this respect it accords with, and adopts some of, the words found in the North-Indian vernaculars. E.g.\n\nNominative\u2014*tema*.\n\nInstrumental\u2014*risin*, 'by.'\nAuxiliary\u2014karana-kota, 'by means of.'\nDative\u2014pinisa or vas, 'for.'\nLocative\u2014Kerehi, 'in.'\nAblative\u2014Keren, 'from.'\n\nThese signs are common to both numbers, except tema which is only used in the singular, its plural being tumu. Nouns in the singular also take an ek in the Sinhalese, to express the indefinite as harak-eku-ta 'to-a-bullock.'\n\nTema, in the Sinhalese, derived from the Sanskrit \u0101tman 'self,' not only expresses the Nominative case, but also conveys the gender of the noun to which it is added. The Sidatsangar\u0101 says: \"Observe also, that in this case the suffixes tema for the masculine singular, tomo for the feminine singular, and tumu for both genders in the plural number, may be used in periphrases and commentaries.\"\n\nThe periphrastic instrumental visin, from the P\u0101li vasena 'by authority,' in the sense of the agent or instrument, is also used in the Sinhalese. Karana-kota\u2014the Pali karani-kriya 'having accomplished a means of action,' is the periphrastic sign of the auxiliary, which we have doubtless brought over to Ceylon from Northern India, since we find it unmistakeably in the M\u016br\u0101hi kar\u016bna, so different from all Dravidian case-signs. I may also observe that the very name for the Auxiliary case (the Karana) is derived from this case-sign. The dative pinisa\u2014P\u0101li panissaya, is not exactly, as the others are, a universal case-sign for the dative; but is used to express 'for,' or 'for the purpose.' Kerehi is the periphrastic locative sign, and comes from kara 'to do;' from whence it obtains the signification of proximity or 'nearness,' and thence, with the addition of the locative sign, the idea of locality. The ablative ker\u0113n is also from kara with the proper sign en.\n\n* See Vibat-maldama in the Appendix to Sidatsangar\u0101, p. 91.\nCases.\n\nThe Nominative, in the Dravidian dialects, is 'the noun itself,' or the inflexional base, without addition or alteration. The Sinhalese nominative takes e, \u00e0 in the singular, and \u00ea, \u00e2u in the plural; and these present the most marked difference to the exceptional formations of the Tamil neuter nominative, and the Canarese nd and ta. Dr. Stevenson observes that in the Dravidian as well as in the North-Indian vernaculars, the nominative is substituted for the accusative, et vice versa. This is not the case in the Sinhalese; for no one, not even the rudest rustic amongst us who knows not the use of case-signs, will ever say ball\u00e2 g\u00e6simi 'canes percuti' but ballata g\u00e6simi 'canem percuti.' It is, indeed, true that the illiterate Sinhalese do, as stated by Dr. Stevenson, occasionally use the accusative for the nominative. This, I have, and I believe satisfactorily, accounted for elsewhere,* and shall therefore proceed to\n\nThe Vocative Case. In the Dravidian there is properly no case-sign for the Vocative. It is formed by a simple sign of emphasis, different from the Sinhalese, which takes \u00e6, a and \u00e0 in the singular, and in, en, nen, ini, eni, nen\u00ee, and ni in the plural. These, it may be remarked, are different also both in form and principle from the ir, a fragment of the nir 'you,' which the Tamils use in the plural.\n\nAgain, it will be observed that the exceptional usage in the Sinhalese, by which the Nominative is employed to express the Vocative, accords with the Indo-European languages.\n\nThe Accusative Case. 'Ordinarily,' says Caldwell, 'the North-Indian vernaculars are distinguished from the Southern by their use of the dative case-sign for the Accusative.' This is no less a peculiarity in the Sinhalese, which is distinguishable from the Dravidian family, in which, if we except the G\u00f4nd, the Dative is quite distinct from the accusative.\n\n\u2020 See my Contributions to Oriental Literature, vol. i. p. 46.\nThe only accusative sign which the Tamil has, is ei. This, I need scarcely say, is different from all signs in the Sinhalese, in which the only termination that may approach the Dravidian, is the Canarese a, and this is of very rare occurrence in our language.\n\nIn turning our attention from the mere formation of the case-signs, to the Syntax of the accusative case, we find the Sinhalese to accord with the Sanskrit and the Latin; e.g., where reference is made to duration of time, all the above languages use the accusative. For other affinities, see Sidatsangar\u00e2, p. 29.\n\nThe Instrumental Case. The Telugu changes the locative ti into ta, to express the instrumental or the auxiliary, both which are treated by Tamils and others as the instrumental. See Sidatsangar\u00e2, p. 31. Now, according to Caldwell, the Canarese instrumental suffix im is identical with in, the Tamil 'ablative of motion.' If this is the case, its tendency to confound the instrumental with the ablative, is in accordance with the Latin and the Greek, which confound the auxiliary with the instrumental. Even the English, in which, as Caldwell points out, 'by' in the sense of 'close by' was originally a locative, would indicate the origin of the Telugu instrumental.\n\nThe Tamil suffix for the instrumental is clearly al, and bears no analogy to the Sinhalese terminations a, \u0101, u, hu in the singular, and an, \u0101na, na, n, and un in the plural.\n\nThe use of the instrumental is gradually getting into disuse amongst the lower orders of the Sinhalese. There is also much difficulty felt by learners in comprehending the difference between the nominative and the instrumental. People say mama karana v\u0101de=n\u0101n sekir velei, Tamil. Now, karana=sekir is not a complete verb. It is devoid of vitality, though possessed of an attribute, and the tense. It approaches nearest to an English participle; and, considering its function in the above sentence, we may call it the relative participle, or as the Tamil Grammarians name it, peyer echam 'noun-defect' or 'noun-complement;' i.e., as explained by Caldwell, a word which requires the complement of a noun to complete its signification. We find it always associated\nwith two nouns, one which it qualifies, and another (either expressed or understood) which indicates its agent. The proper designation of it would then seem to be a relative participial adjective. Having ascertained the real force of karana, let us inquire in which of the two agent-cases we should place the noun-agent. We cannot put it in the nominative, because our Grammar teaches us that the nominative should be followed by a complete verb 'expressive of an attribute, of time, and of an assertion.'* We are therefore constrained to use in the sentence before us the instrumental m\u00e0, and not the nominative mama.\n\nThe sense of the instrumental is also preserved in a similarly constructed English sentence; e.g., karana de is 'being-done thing' or 'the thing that is being done.' Now, if we add an agent to the act, we have mama karana de 'I being-done thing' or 'the thing that is being done [by] I.' This sign 'by' or visin is understood in the Sinhalese, in which case the noun takes the sign of the case, and it is necessary that the nominative mama should be changed into the instrumental m\u00e0 'by me.' The sentence itself would then run grammatically both in Sinhalese and English, thus; m\u00e0 karana de 'the thing that is done by me.' On comparing the Mur\u00e2thi, the Sinhalese, and the Sanskrit, I find that the prevalence of an instrumental case in connection with the passive verb, and the relative participial adjective, is one of the most remarkable features in the Syntax of all these languages. 'This instrumental construction after passive verbs' says Professor Mon. Williams,\u2020 'is a favorite idiom in Sanskrit prose composition;' and our best prose writers abound with instances of the instrumental case in the connection above stated.\n\nIt is unnecessary to say more on the subject; nor to inquire into the usage in the Tamil. All my observations here as elsewhere\n\n* See my Sinhalese Grammar, Section viii. \u00a7 92; also Harrison's Structure of the English language, p. 315.\n\u2020 See his Grammar, p. 366.\nshow that the usage which is springing up in our language, is unwarranted by Grammar and the usage of our standard writers. I shall treat of the idiom involved in the use of an expression, as in m\u00e0 karana de, when I shall have entered upon the Section on Verbs.\n\nThe Auxiliary Case, which is found in the Sinhalese, owes its origin entirely to the Sanskrit. Although the Dravidians have some notion of it, yet it is found confounded by them with the instrumental. There is however one important particular by which the Sinhalese auxiliary may be distinguished from even the Sanskrit,\u2014that whilst the latter adopts the instrumental suffixes for the auxiliary, the former have generally an entirely different set of inflexions for each of the two cases. A careful investigation of grammatical forms in the Indo-European, the North-Indian, and Dravidian dialects, convinces me that there is a tendency in all of them towards a distinction between the instrumental and the auxiliary, which Caldwell denominates the conjunctive, although the Sinhalese alone have marked the distinction with special suffixes. See Sidatsangar\u00e0, p. 30.\n\nThe Dative Case. One of the striking analogies, to which Dr. Stevenson refers as running through the North-Indian and the Dravidian dialects, is the resemblance in the Dative ki ku ge,* which are different from the Sanskrit and all Indo-European dialects.\n\nCaldwell also states that 'in the vernaculars of Northern India, which are deeply tinged with Scythian characteristics, we find a suffix which appears to be not only similar to the Dravidian, but the same.' p. 225. In giving examples from the Northern vernaculars, Caldwell gives ghai as the 'Sinhalese' form of the Hindi ho and ku. This is clearly not so. We have no g or k in the\n\n* In the primitive Indo-European tongues we discover no trace of any such dative suffix or case-sign as the Dravidian 'ku;' but on turning to the Scythian family, interesting analogies meet us at every step.\nin the Dative Case. The only Sinhalese dative termination, ta presents the most unequivocal testimony of its none-relation to the Dravidian; and in this ta may be recognized the Mur\u00e2thi la, the absence of which in her sisters is probably owing to Dravidian influences. Turning our attention to the Syntax of this case we find that words expressing 'cause or purpose' take a dative in the Sinhalese as in Sanskrit and Latin. 'Connected with this application of the dative case' says Professor H. H. Wilson* 'is its optional substitution [in the Sanskrit] for the infinitive after adverb.' So clearly is this the case in the Sinhalese infinitive, e.g., liya (n) ta as in the English 'to-write,' that the sign of the dative case is found bodily transferred to the infinitive. It would be idle to allude to various other syntactical laws which are identical in the formation of the dative in these languages, and which an ordinary acquaintance with them cannot fail to exhibit. I shall therefore pass on to\n\nvii. The Genitive Case.\u2014The signs of this in the Tamil are in, an, and ai, the first being the most frequent. Here again Dr. Stevenson says the letter n is a general characteristic of the genitive singular. Now, although it may be found in the Tamil in, the Telegu ni, and in the English mine, it nevertheless is deficient in the Sinhalese, and in the North-Indian vernaculars, 'of all which,' as stated by Caldwell, 'the Gujarathi is the only one which contains a form of the genitive resembling that which we have been examining.'\u2020 I need scarcely add that the Sinhalese take ge besides the dative ta; and that although a simple n is also given with un, in the Sidatsangar\u00e2, yet the use of them is so very rare that the author seems to have had some difficulty in finding out examples of their use; and even in those which the Translator has supplied, there\n\n* Introduction to Sanskrit Grammar, p. 388\n\u2020 Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 237.\nis this peculiarity to be observed\u2014that the \\( n \\) is simply a plural euphonic addition in a compound rendering.\n\nBut the resemblance to which Dr. Stevenson refers is, that this \\( n \\) is a general characteristic of the genitive singular. It is decidedly not found as a singular suffix in the Sinhalese; see Sidatsangar\u00e2, p. 178. Even if it were, the fact would furnish no evidence in favor of the analogy which Dr. Stevenson seeks to establish. For, as remarked by Caldwell \"both in the Sanskrit and in other members of the Indo-European family, we may observe distinct traces of the adjectival or the genetival use of a particle, of which the consonant \\( n \\) is the most essential element.\"* He also adds in the same page, \"The Lethunian goes further than any other indo-European tongue in resemblance to the Tamil in this point, for it not only uses \\( n \\) as a sign of the pronominal possessive (of the first person,) but it adopts this genetival \\( man \\) as the inflexional base of all the rest of the oblique cases of the same pronoun.\"\n\nMoreover, the analogy which Dr. Stevenson supposes to exist between the Sinhalese \\( ge \\) and the Telegu \\( yokka \\), entirely illusory. Between the \\( g \\) in the Sinhalese genitive, and the \\( k \\) in the Telegu, there is, I feel persuaded, no relation whatever, since the Sinhalese genitive sign represents the \\( ge \\) or 'the habitation' in the sense of the \"possession\" which this case implies.\n\nA peculiarity connected with the Sinhalese case-signs of the genitive, exhibits its very near relation to the Sanskrit. It is this. In the Sanskrit, the genitive is constantly interchangeable with the dative and the accusative, etc. 'This vague use of the genitive,' says Professor Monier Williams \u2020 'to express various relations, prevails also in early Greek.' It likewise prevails in the Sinhalese. Compare the case-sign given in the Sidatsangar\u00e2, p. 37, as those peculiar to the genitive, the dative, and the accusative.\n\n---\n\n* Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 238.\n\u2020 See his Sanskrit Grammar, p. 354.\nviii. The Locative Case.\u2014The Dravidian Locative sign present a marked contrast with the Sinhalese. Compare Sidatsangar\u00e2, p. 180, with Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 247 et seq. 'None of the Dravidian affixes of the locative,' says the last mentioned writer, 'bears any resemblance to the locative case-sign of the Sanskrit, of any other of the Indo-European languages, or of the North-Indian vernaculars.'\n\nix. The Ablative Case seems to have been introduced into Dravidian Grammars 'out of deference to the principles of Sanskrit Grammarians.' It is therefore unnecessary to institute any comparisons between the Dravidian and the Sinhalese beyond stating that in this respect the Sinhalese presents one other in addition to the many unequivocal proofs I have adduced to show its non-relation to the Dravidian.\n\nADJECTIVES.\n\nAll languages that are entitled to be considered as of high antiquity, whilst drawing a distinction in the sense of a name and its attribute, look upon adjectives as nouns, and invest them with number, case, and gender. This peculiarity may be recognized in all those dialects which stand in fraternal connection with the Sanskrit. But in the languages which have arisen from these Sanskrit daughters, the tendency to simplify the contractions, evolutions, involutions, and inflexions of case, gender, and number, in which their mothers delight, is indeed manifest. The Sinhalese in their Grammatical System place the adjective amongst nouns [see Sidatsangar\u00e2, \u00a7 21 c.]; and even clothe it with a sign of gender, and case; as, hal\u00ee from hela 'white;' kot\u00e2 'short one;' from kota 'short;' pat\u00ee 'lass,' from pat\u00ee 'young;' gori 'white person' from gor\u00e2 'white;' kali 'black person' from kalu 'black,' etc. These are only a few remnants of a large Sanskritic development, which must doubtless have existed upon the early formation of the Sinhalese. Even some of these are being gradually given up; and we find that, generally, the Sinhalese, like the English adjective, has\nat present no variation, undergoes no change of form, and takes its position immediately before the noun which it qualifies. * This is also the case at present with the North-Indian dialects; and, what is still more remarkable, they possess, like the Sinhalese, a few remnants of the early development of gender, number, and case; e.g., in the Mur\u0101thi many adjectives have separate terminations for the three genders, and have two cases. \u2020\n\nWe are thus enabled to assign to the Sinhalese and the North-Indian dialects a common origin, though like many modern Indo-European tongues, they have gradually given up the peculiarities of the adjective, which distinguish them from the dialects from which they have arisen.\n\nPronouns:\n\nNext to inseparable Prepositions, of which I shall treat hereafter, there is no class of words, which more clearly proves the non-relation of the Sinhalese to the Dravidian, than the Pronouns. Indeed they throw generally much light on the relationship of languages; for, as remarked by Caldwell, \"the personal pronouns, and especially those of the first and second person singular, evince more of the quality of permanence than any other parts of speech, and are generally found to change but little in the lapse of ages.\"\n\nIn laying before the reader a long extract from the writer above-named in which he compares the Dravidian, with the North-Indian\n\n* \"In Sanskrit and all the Indo-European tongues, adjectives are declined like substantives, and agree with the substantives to which they are conjoined, in gender, number and case. In the Dravidian languages, as in the Scythian, adjectives are incapable of declension. When used separately as abstract nouns of quality, which is the original and natural character of Dravidian adjectives, they are subject to all the affections of substantives; but when they are used adjectively, i.e. to qualify other substantives, they do not admit of any inflectional change, but are simply prefixed to the nouns which they qualify.\" Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 35.\n\n\u2020 See Dr. Stevenson's Mur\u0101thi Grammar, pp. 77\u201478.\npersonal pronouns, I have taken the liberty to insert the Sinhalese forms under the Sanskrit family to which they are allied; and I need therefore do little more here than refer the reader to his Tables, given ante, p. 41. But some further examination into the subject may not prove uninteresting.\n\nFrom the results of the valuable investigations of the same writer, n\u0101n appears to be the Tamil nominative of the first person. There is very little difference, if any at all, in the other Dravidian dialects which also take na as the radical of this person. Now the Sinhalese has mam which may be seen as in the Persian man, the Sindhi m\u0101n and the Oriental Turkish men, which is the same in a variety of Scythian tongues. It is found in those languages, in which ni is used as the equivalent of personality in the verbal terminations. This usage may also be observed in the North-Indian vernaculars, as in the Sinhalese.\n\nThe base of the Tamil pronoun ni 'thou' [second person] is the same in the Malayilam, the Tud\u0101, etc., and seem to come from the pronoun of the first person. On a comparison of the several Dravidian dialects ni, nu or na may be pronounced to have been its original form. The Sinhalese ta or to has no relation whatever to these bases, and on the contrary bears the nearest affinity to the Sanskrit team, a form which pervades nearly all Indo-European and the North-Indian dialects.\n\nFrom an examination of the pronouns for the first and second person singular, I shall proceed to examine their forms in the plural; and here we find a peculiarity in the Sinhalese, not only distinguishable from the Dravidian, but also from the P\u0101li and the Pr\u0101krits, to which lexically it bears the nearest affinity. The first person forms its plural in all the Dravidian idioms by changing the inflexion n into m, whilst the Pr\u0101krits adopt mhe. But the Sinhalese use pi, a termination neither allied to the Dravidian, nor to the Pr\u0101krit, nor indeed to the termination of pluralisation in the ordinary form of the North-Indian vernaculars. There is also this\ndifference to be observed between the Sinhalese *api* 'we,' and all the forms of the dialects above named,\u2014that whilst the latter retain the primary consonant of the first person, the former gives it up altogether. Yet it will be observed that the Sinhalese is indebted for this *ap*, not to the Dravidian, but to the North-Indian; e.g., the Mur\u00e2thi and Gujar\u00e2thi *\u0101pane* 'we.'\n\nNow, *\u0101pane* in the dialects above named, one of the two pronouns for 'we'\u2014that is, 'the party speaking, including those who are addressed,' whilst *hame*, the ordinary form, is simply 'the party speaking.' The existence of this two-fold form of the first person plural, in some of the North-Indian vernaculars has induced Dr. Stevenson, and several other scholars to class them with the Dravidian dialects, which also have this two-fold plural. Even with regard to those North-Indian idioms, the utmost extent to which an inference may be drawn from the above circumstance, is, that one class has borrowed an idiom of expression from the other; for the words which the Dravidians use are [*n\u00e1m* and *n\u00e1ngal*] different from those adopted by the North-Indians. When we turn from the North-Indian to the Sinhalese, we neither find two pronouns of the first person plural, nor the distinction sought to be conveyed by the adoption of two sets of words.* The Sinhalese *api* means nothing more or less than what 'we' means in the English, or *nos* in Latin, or *amhe* in P\u00e2li; and it clearly comes from *\u0101pane*, from the Sanskrit dual form *\u00e1v\u00e1n*, the *v* being changed into *p*.\n\nThis *p*, or the entire inflexion *pane* must have originally had\n\n---\n\n* \"The existence of two pronouns of the first person plural, one of which includes the other excludes the party addressed, is a peculiarity of the Dravidian dialects, as of many of the Scythian languages; but is unknown to the Sanskrit and the languages of the Indo-European family,\"\u2014Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 36.\nsome significant meaning, for we find it in the second person, as in the first person plural.\n\nWhilst we take the root ta 'thou,' it will be observed we add the same p in api to pluralize ta. The origin of pi, even if we disregard the Sanskrit dv\u00e1n, may, judging from the sense of duality which it was intended to convey, be traced to the dual terminations in pi and pin, Greek; bhy\u00e0m, bhis, Sanskrit; and bis, Latin. The Notherners, who have no dual number, seem to have adopted this case-suffix, which so largely runs through several of the dual cases in the Sanskrit, to express the two-fold relation of the party speaking and the party spoken to; and it seems to be equally clear that the language which stands in fraternal connection with them, viz., the Sinhalese, was not so mindful of the distinction, and therefore adopted one or two pronouns used by her sisters, expressive of the plural pronoun for the first person.\n\nIt is unnecessary here to enter into the other terminations in the oblique cases of the pronouns of the first and second person, since they are the same as those to which we have referred under the declension of nouns; nor is it, for obvious reasons, necessary to go into comparisons of the ohu 'he,' Sinhalese and avan Tamil; mohu 'he [proximate]' Sinhalese, and itan, Tamil. Suffice it, however, to notice the form of the Tamil reflexive pronoun tan singular, tam plural 'self,' which may be traced to the tama and tam-ai in the Sinhalese. This may at first sight seem to be a Dravidian derivative; but there is no reason whatever to indicate why both the Tamil and Sinhalese forms might not have had their origin in the Sanskrit atman. Tam-ai is used in the modern vernacular Sinhalese as in the Tamil to express a strong affirmation of 'self' or 'the very person' whom the speaker intends to single out as the man,' as in, 'Thou; art the man;' but in the Sinhalese we use it as in the English with a verb. Thus what in Tamil would be expressed by ni-tan 'thou self' we would express in Sinhalese to tam-ai 'it is thou (very) self.' Tan in the Tamil must\ntherefore be regarded more in the light of a verb of affirmation, than as a pronoun. This appears to be the case when we examine another use of the expression which is identical in the Sinhalese: e.g., *mei tan* Tamil, *seba tam-a-i* Sinhalese, 'it is indeed true,' or ironically, *poi tan*, Tamil=*boru tam-ai* 'false indeed!' Sinhalese.\n\nBut whether we accept this (*t\u0101u=tama*) as a pronoun or a noun derived from the Sanskrit *\u0101tman*, it may be affirmed that the only Sinhalese reflexive pronoun which the books adopt, and which the Dravidian dialects do not possess, is *siya*, from the Sanskrit *svayam* so near the Latin *sui*, *stbi*, and *se*.\n\nThe Sinhalese, like the Sanskrit, is devoid of a simple pronoun of the third person. The Sidatsangar\u0101 gives \u0113 (remote) and mi (proximate.) This looks like the Zend h\u0113, and the Prakrit s\u0101, for sv\u0113; for the s is changed in our language, as in the Prakrits, to \u0101, and that consonant is sometimes altogether omitted, leaving but the vowel which was inherent in the original word. The Sinhalese also possesses another word *oku* for the third person singular. Its affinity to the Zend h\u014di, to which, as pointed out by Bopp, the Greek *oi* is similar, is very clear. This pronoun, so different from the Tamil, is in common use amongst us, and may be traced to a variety of dialects. See Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 298.\n\nThe demonstrative bases in the Tamil seem to be a (remote,) and i (proximate;) e.g., *apporadu*; that time, *ipporadu* 'this time;' I shall here compare the Tamil demonstratives, with the Sinhalese, which bear some similarity in the sense in which they are applied although there is as much dissimilarity in their formation.\n\n| Tamil       | Sinhalese |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| A-adu (remote) | \u0113 (remote) | 'that' |\n| A-van       | \u0113 k\u0101      | 'that person' |\n| A-n-gu      | e-tena    | 'that there' |\n| A-ndru      | e-d\u0101      | 'that day' |\n\nHere the Sinhalese \u0113 is from the Beng\u0101li \u0113; and the Tamil \u0113 as\nwell as the proximate i is more clearly allied to the Indo-European than to the Sinhalese and the North-Indian.\n\n| Tamil       | Sinhalese   |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| i-idu (proximate) | m\u0113          |\n| i-van       | me-k\u0101        |\n| i-ngu       | me-tena      |\n| i-ndu       | me-d\u0101        |\n\nIn the North-Indian dialects the radical i is used more systematically than the 'remote' a. In the Sinhalese, however, the personal pronoun ma is compounded with other words to convey the proximity to 'ego.' Here the word ka, compounded of \u0113 and m\u0113, is derived from the Sanskrit k\u0101=eka, 'one,' and comes from eka. So likewise tena comes from sth\u0101na, and d\u0101 from d\u0101.\n\nThere is another demonstrative base which enters into an adverbial expression. It is u in Tamil, and a and ara in Sinhalese. Besides these, to which I have now referred, it would seem, the Dravidian languages have no pronouns, properly so called.*\n\nINTERROGATIVES.\n\nI take the following comparative table of interrogatives from Caldwell, p. 344, shewing their Sinhalese equivalents.\n\n| Prox. i | Remote. a | Interrogative | Sinhalese |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------|\n| Mas. Sin. | ivan, hic | avan, ill\u0113 | evan, quis? | ko (i)-(e) k\u0101 |\n| Fem. do. | ival, hac | aval, illa | eval, quae? | ko (i)-(e) ki |\n| Neuter do. | idu, hoc | udu, illud | edu, quid? | ko (i)-(e) ka |\n| Epicine pl. | ivar, hi, hae | avar, illi, illae | evan, qui, quae? | ka-vara |\n| Neuter do. | ivei, haec | avei, illa | evei, quae? |\n\nThough the Tamil presents a great similarity to the Latin in having as many demonstratives designed to express 'so many\n\n* All other words which correspond either in meaning or in use to the pronouns of other languages will be found on examination to be nouns regularly formed and declined. Caldwell's Comp. Grammar, p. 349.\nrelations as the above, yet it would seem that the latter have no more relation to the former than the Sinhalese have to the same. The interrogatives k\u00f3-k\u00e1, k\u00f3-ki, koka, kavara are all from the Sanskrit base ka, and are allied to the North-Indian. Although I have shewn an inanimate k\u00f3-ka, yet it must be remembered that this is a usage of comparatively recent times, for inanimate objects as I have shewn under the head of gender.\n\n**Inseparable Prepositions.**\n\nIf one circumstance, more than any other favors my position that the Sinhalose bears a close affinity to the Sanskrit, and is not allied to the Dravidian, it is to be found in the unmistakeable identity which may be established between the Sanskrit or P\u0101li, and the Sinhalese prepositions, none of which are known to the Tamil,* or any other Dravidian dialect, except indeed what may be found in words which may be clearly traced to a Sanskrit origin. It would also seem that, except in a few instances, [e.g. par\u0101-jaya, etc.] these prepositions are used in the Sinhalese and in the later Sanskrit,\u2020 as prefixes, to qualify the sense of verbs, and are thence named upa-sarga.\n\nThe following is a comparative Table of Sinhalese, P\u0101li, and Sanskrit inseparable prepositions:\n\n| Sinhalese | Pali. | Sanskrit | Examples\u2021 |\n|-----------|------|----------|-----------|\n| a         | \u00e0    | \u00e0        | adara,    | 'affection.' |\n| abhi      | abhi | abhi     | abi-seka | 'anointed.' |\n| ati       | ati  | ati      | ati-sara, | 'dysentery.' |\n\n* Wherever prepositions are used in the Indo-European languages, the Dravidian languages, with those of the Scythian group, use post-positions instead,\u2014which post-positions do not constitute a separate part of speech, but are real nouns of relation or quality, adopted as auxiliaries.\"\u2014Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar p. 35.\n\n\u2020 See Professor Monier William's Sanskrit Grammar p. 316.\n\n\u2021 The above examples are only given in the Sinhalese.\n### THE SINHALESE LANGUAGE.\n\n| Sinhalese | Pali | Sanskrit | Examples |\n|-----------|------|----------|----------|\n| adi       | adhi | adhi     | adikarana | 'supreme.' |\n| apa       | apa  | apa      | apa-dan,  | 'ablative.' |\n| api       | api  | api      | 'pi-yana,'* | 'cover.' |\n| anu       | anu  | anu      | anu-sara,  | 'prevalence.' |\n| ava       | ava  | ava      | ava-man,   | 'dis-grace.' |\n| u         | ut   | u-legi   | 'up-risen.' |\n| upa       | upa  | upa      | upa-me,    | 'comparison.' |\n| du        | dur  | dur      | du-dana,   | 'wicked.' |\n| ni        | ni   | ni       | ni-dahas,  | 'leisure.' |\n| pa        | pra  | pra      | pa-vara,   | 'pre-eminent.' |\n| par\u00e9      | par\u00e9 | par\u00e9     | para-jaya, | 'defeat.' |\n| pas \u2020     | ni   | nir      | pasa      | 'to pass through.' |\n| piri      | pari | pari     | piri-vara  | 'retinue.' |\n| pil\u012b \u2021    | pati | prati    | pil\u012b-gat,  | 'accepted.' |\n| vi        | vi   | vi       | vi-ridu,   | 'opposed.' |\n| sa        | sam  | sam      | sa-banda   | 'conjoint.' |\n| su        | su   | su       | su-ratu,   | 'very-red.' |\n\n**The Verb.**\n\nIn turning from the noun to the verb, Dr. Stevenson says, the second person singular in the imperative is the root in the languages which he compares, that is, the Dravidian, under which he includes the Sinhalese, and the North-Indian. I have already disposed of this supposed mark of resemblance under the head of roots. In further illustration of the facts therein stated, I may here refer to the verb substantive. This is changed from *bh\u016b* in Sanskrit to *v\u016b* in Sinhalese. The imperative in the latter is never *v\u016b*, but *v\u0113* or, more frequently (like the Sanskrit *bhava=* ) *veva* 'be thou' singular, and *vevu* 'be ye' in the plural; see *Sidatsangar\u00e0*, \u00a7 51.\n\n---\n\n* The initial *a* in *api* is generally lost in composition in the Sinhalese, as in *pi-nasa* 'nose-affection.'\n\n\u2020 This is the only word, the relation of which to the Sanskrit does not clearly appear.\n\n\u2021 Here, it will be observed, the Sanskrit *t* is changed into *l* in the Sinhalese.\nIt may be convenient here to notice the other verbal analogies to which Dr. Stevenson refers under the head of (1) Voices, (2) the formation of tenses, (3) the Participle, (4) the Infinitive, (5) Verbal nouns, and (6) the Relative participle.\n\n**The Voices.**\n\n*The Negative Voice.* Dr. Stevenson points out a *Negative Voice*, in the Dravidian as well as in the North-Indian dialects, but admits that \"to the observations under this head, the Sinhalese seems [it indeed is] an exception, having no affix which it adds to deny the existence of the act, beyond that which is known to the Sanscrit family of languages.\"\n\nTo render this more plain:\u2014The Dravidian dialects add a negative particle between the radical and the verbal theme, e.g. var-\u00e1 du, 'do not come'; whereas in the Sanskrit and the Sinhalese the mark of negation, generally na, is prefixed to the radical. Thus, asti Sanskrit, and ati Sinhalese 'it is,' become n\u00e1sti and n\u00e1ti, respectively in expressing 'it is not.'\n\nAnother peculiarity connected with the Dravidian negative verb, is, that it has but one tense, which is an aorist, or is indeterminate in point of time; e.g. pogen Tamil, 'I go not,' means either 'I do not go,' 'I did not go,' or 'I shall not go.' There is no such indefiniteness as to tense in the Sinhalese or the Sanskrit, in both which the tenses are regularly formed notwithstanding the negative affix; as no-yami 'I go not,' no-giyemi 'I went not,' and no-yannemi 'I shall not go.'\n\n*The Passive Voice.* Many who have not thoroughly mastered the Sinhalese have laboured to shew that the Sinhalese language, like the Dravidian dialects, is devoid of a regular passive voice. This is as much a mistake as to suppose that it has not a relative pronoun, or an instrumental case. The mistake arises from a careless observance of our best writers, and too much adherence to the ignorant usage of illiterate men. I am free to confess that the\nSinhalese in their colloquial dialect make an effort to express themselves in the active rather than in the passive voice. It is also true, as stated by Dr. Stevenson, that they generally express themselves as in the North-Indian vernaculars, 'I ate a beating' instead of 'I was struck.' This is after the fashion of the people with whom they had been, and from whom the Sinhalese were long ago separated. And the reason why the North-Indians have adopted this idiom may be found in the constant intercourse which they have had for centuries with their Dravidian neighbours.\n\nYet because a foreign idiom is adopted, or the Sinhalese shews a tendency to adapt itself to circumstances it must not be concluded that the language is destitute of a passive voice. It must moreover be borne in mind that in the particular investigation in hand it is not necessary to enquire what is the tendency of the Sinhalese at the present day\u2014twenty-four centuries after it had been fixed in Ceylon\u2014but what was its state, as to this passive voice, according to its earliest writings, its acknowledged grammatical system, and the learned usage in respect of it at the present day. There is scarcely a single Sinhalese book in which the passive voice is not unmistakeably expressed by its author. It is expressly treated of in the only ancient Sinhalese Grammar of authority, the Sidat-sangar\u0101; it is found in writings contained in the Newspaper Press of this Island; and it is familiar to every one who reads his Lord's Prayer in Sinhalese.\n\nBut it is said that the word used is laeba 'receive.' It signifies nothing what the auxiliary verb is that is employed to express the passive, so long as it conveys, when joined to the principal verb, which laeba does, a passive signification. If exception be taken as I have seen it has been, that laeba is by itself a separate word, what will the critic say to the verb substantive which enters into the composition of the English passive verb? What to the ya (from ya 'to go') which is added to the Sanskrit verb? Surely the one or the other of these is as much a distinct word and a verb\nas laba or lada. Surely the addition of be in English or ya in Sanskrit does not divest the verb, to which they are added, of the passive signification which they impart. If not, it would seem that laba, from its very meaning of, 'passion,' 'endurance' or 'suffering' is calculated to make this voice more distinctly marked than either be or ya.\n\nThe formation of the passive voice in the Sinhalese is two-fold; one with inflexions, and the other with the periphrastic or auxiliary laba. The first may be regarded as the original form, and the second the form adopted to render the voice distinctly marked in such writings as paraphrases, rik\u0101s, etc. Of the first see examples in all our ancient works; and the latter the reader meets in every modern writer. Now, the exceptional use of the active for the passive with a turn of expression does not show that the Sinhalese is allied to the Dravidian any more than that the Dravidian exhibits a relation to the Semitic, from the resemblances which the one class bears to the other in the formation of roots [Cald. p. 160.] Even after the too general adoption of this form of expression, it will be found, we have not altogether ceased to use a passive voice: and I may indeed adopt the very language of Dr. Stevenson in 1843, a year after he wrote his Essay published in the Bombay A. S. Journal, and say \"There is undoubtedly such a thing as a passive verb occasionally used [in Sinhalese as well as] in Mur\u0101thi; but its use is very limited, compared with that of the English passive verb, and its place is generally supplied by intransitive verbs, or by circumlocution.\"\n\nThere is also another peculiarity connected with the Sinhalese passive, or, as some call it, the middle voice, which may be noticed here. 'When' says the Sidatsangar\u0101, 'the agent and the object are the same, (as when a thing is produced of itself,) the verb takes a pas-\n\n* Mur\u0101thi Grammar, p. 87.\nsive termination.' This is of frequent use in the Sinhalese, as *gaha va\u1e6duni* 'the tree fell.'\n\nThe formation of the causal verb both in the North and South-Indian classes, is according to the Sanskrit. The *aya* in the latter is changed into *ay* or *ave* in the Pr\u0101krit, into *va* in the Sinhalese and Mur\u0101thi,* and *vi* in some of the Dravidian dialects.\n\n**Conjunctive System.**\n\n*The present tense.*\u2014The Sinhalese verb, like the Pr\u0101krit, is formed by suffixing pronominal fragments to the root, as *kara* root 'do'; *kara-mi* 'I do.' As in the Dravidian, there is no sign whatever in the Sinhalese verb to indicate the gender of the third person. The pronominal signs are however in both suffixed, not prefixed. The Sinhalese has also of late years shewn a tendency, especially amongst the lower orders of the people, to divest the verb of all signs of personality, and to use it with a pronoun or a nominative. This is certainly not after the fashion of the Dravidian, nor from Dravidian influences; for the most ignorant Tamulian uses the verb with its proper personal inflexion. The use of the substantive verb, as an auxiliary in the formation of some of the tenses, is not known to the Sinhalese as it is to the Dravidian, and some of the North-Indian vernaculars. But these resemblances, and differences lead to no important results in the particular investigation before us. I shall therefore proceed to\n\n*The Past Tense.*\u2014Here again I may allude to what Dr. Stevenson has pointed out, under this head, as an analogy which pervades all the Dravidian, and the North-Indian dialects, viz: that the past tense of the verb is marked by affixes and not prefixes as in the Sanskrit. The Sinhalese is not without a prefix to form the past tense as *yami* 'I go' and *gi-ye-mi* 'I went'; but, I admit that the Sinhalese verb generally accords with the Dravidian in the\n\n---\n\n* Dr. Stevenson's Mur\u0101thi Gr. p. 87.\npeculiarity noticed by Dr. Stevenson. This admission however does not at all militate against the position, that the Sinhalese and her North-Indian sisters are indebted for this grammatical form to other than Dravidian influences. It is true that the Sanskrit takes the augment \\(a\\) in the [Hiyattani, Ajjatani, and K\u0101latipatti] past tenses; but the P\u0101li, which is the dialect which exhibits the nearest approximation to the Sanskrits, shows the earliest traces of a departure from this rule. For, on reference to Kachchayna's Pali Grammar [lib. vi.chap. iv. \u00a7 38] it will be seen that this change of the present into the past by the augment \\(a\\), is \"optional;\" e.g. \\(a\\)-gam\u0101 = gam\u0101 'he went.' After the P\u0101li had taken this first step of departure from the Sanskrit the other Pr\u0101krit dialects have followed the secondary formation of the P\u0101li preterite. See Vararuchi's Pr\u0101krit Grammar, sec. viii. \u00a7 23. Not only they but the North-Indian Vernaculars have along with the Sinhalese, and some of the Indo-European languages * followed the practice of retaining the radical without a prefix in the aorist, e.g. amo, amavi, Latin; do, did; Eng., etc., etc. Caldwell in summing up the relations which several languages bear to each other in the formation of the preterite, says 'In a large proportion of the verbs in the Germanic tongues, in the modern Persian, in the Turkish and Finish families of languages, in the vernacular languages of Northern India, and, with a few exceptions, in the Dravidian languages, the preterite is formed by suffixing to the verbal theme a particle, generally a single consonant only, which is significant of past tense.\n\nThe future tense.\u2014The characteristic sign of the future in the Dravidian dialects is \\(v\\) or \\(b\\). The Bengali has also adopted \\(a b\\), which Professor Max Muller identifies with the \\(b\\) or \\(be\\) 'which forms characteristic sign of the Latin future, and which is considered to be a relic of an old substantive verb.' Now the Sinhalese future has no sign in common with any of these languages. It takes\n\n* Caldwell, p. 391.\nnemi, being simply an introduction of an n to the personal termination of the present tense.\n\nParticiples\u2014On examination, I find a peculiarity which distinguishes the Sinhalese from the Dravidian Participle, viz., that the latter is destitute of what the former, in common with all the North-Indian and Indo-European dialects, possesses, the verbal participle, which participates in the nature of adjectives.*\n\nI may here notice another analogy in the formation of the participle to which Dr. Stevenson refers. He says that in the Sinhalese, Telugu, Carnatika, and Tamil......the present participle active receives the signs of the persons as affixes, to form the present indicative. 'In the Northern family generally (he adds), I believe, as in the Hindi, and with a negative in Gujarathi, the present tense is formed by the participle and the substantive verb as in our form, I am reading.'\n\nThe sign of the Sinhalese present participle has indeed, apparently, a distant resemblance to the sign of the first person; but I feel persuaded that its formation is totally unconnected with the principle upon which the verbal termination in the first person of the indicative mood is formed. In the latter, the first person takes, as in several other languages, the pronoun for the first person, which is m in the Sinhalese; but the participle takes min, which is the Sanskrit and the Pali m\u00e2na in the same part of speech. e.g. Gachcham\u00e2na, Pali and Sanskrit (neuter) 'going'; and this again is more like the termination in the English 'sing-ing,' or the Scotch 'sing-in.'\n\nThe Infinitive\u2014Dr. Stevenson says that in the languages, whose agreement in grammatical forms he has noticed, the infinitive adopts the sign of the dative. So far as appearances go this is quite correct. If any inference can be drawn from this resemblance, it will be observed that the same inference may also be drawn as between all these dialects, and the English. See ante p. 57.\n\n* Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 384.\nBut, says Caldwell, 'the supposition that the final ka of most Tamil infinitives is in any manner connected with ku, the sign of the Dravidian dative and of the Hindi dative-accusative, is erroneous. A comparison of various classes of verbs, and of the various dialects shows that the ka in question proceeds from a totally different origin.'* I am not prepared to state that in this I quite agree with Mr. Caldwell; but I do believe that the Sinhalese, in which we find, not a ka as already explained at p. 57, but a ta both in the dative and in the infinitive, is not indebted to the Dravidian for the principle of this formation. It should however be borne in mind, that the analogy sought to be deduced is, not that the same form ku occurs in the dative and the infinitive of both the Dravidian and the Sinhalese; but, that though each uses different forms, yet each employs one and the same sign in the dative noun and the infinitive verb, thus establishing a common principle upon which the dative and the infinitive are formed in those languages. If this principle were recognized, we should indeed find no difficulty in tracing out the same analogies in languages belonging to the Sanskrit family. In the Sanskrit, as in the Sinhalese, the infinitive is ever to be received as the object of a verb expressed or understood. 'As the object of the verb,' says Monier Williams, 'it may be regarded as an equivalent to an indeclinable substantive, in which the force of two cases, an accusative and dative, is inherent.' Now in the Sinhalese the infinitive, as well as the accusative and the dative, take the same termination ta. The reason for the adoption of the same inflexion in the infinitive which occurs in the accusative and the dative is therefore obvious. The use of the infinitive, continues Professor Williams, as a substantive, with the force of the accusative case, corresponds to one use of the Latin infinitive; thus, tat sarvam srotum icch\u00e1mi, 'I desire to hear all that,' id audire cupio, where srotum and audire are both equivalent to accusative cases, them-\n\n* p. 423.\nselves also governing an accusative. Similarly *roditum pravitt\u00e1* 'she began to weep;' and *mahin jetun \u00e1rebbe*, 'he began to conquer the earth,' where *makijayan \u00e1rebbe* 'he began the conquest of the earth' would be equally correct.* All that is here said of the Sanskrit equally applies to the Sinhalese: and, when we moreover learn from the authority already quoted, that 'infinitives in the Veda may also be formed by simply adding the usual case terminations,' we need no longer hesitate to account for the existence of the dative and accusative sign in the Sinhalese infinitive, and to trace its cause to the genius of that language, the Sanskrit, in which 'the infinitive most commonly involves,' as the Sinhalese does, 'a sense which belongs especially to the Sanskrit dative viz., that of the end or purpose for which any thing is done;' and in which, as in the cases above given, it would be equally correct to substitute the dative for the infinitive.\u2020\n\nThere is yet another peculiarity, to which Dr. Stevenson has called attention, and which it is convenient to notice here. It is that of nouns being used with the verb 'to do,' 'give,' 'take,' &c. This does not possess a characteristic by any means distinguishable from the Sanskrit. What is here described as nouns are verbal derivatives. Though they present all the appearance of nouns, yet they are deduced from, and are clearly traceable to, verbs; e.g., *horakan kal\u00e1* 'he made steal-ing.' Now, as remarked by Bopp, \"the Sanskrit verbs of the tenth class, and all derivative verbs, periphrastically express the reduplicated preterite by one of the auxiliary verbs\u2014*kri*, 'to make,' *as* and *b\u0101s*, 'to be.'\u2021 E.g., *chorag\u0101nchak\u0101ra* 'he made stealing.' The Sanskrit also uses 'go' as an auxiliary, as *apushtam\u0101rtham varay\u0101m prachakramuh*, 'they went to a solicitation.' So likewise in the Sinhalese, as well as in\n\n* Mon. William's Sanskrit Grammar, p. 367.\n\u2020 ib. p. 368; also Sidatsangara, \u00a7 30. p. 35.\n\u2021 Also see Panini, iii. i. 35 seq.\nON THE ORIGIN OF\n\nother Indo-European dialects.\" See Bopp's Comp. Grammar, ii. p. 841, et seq.\n\nSo again in the Pali, as in the Rule, bhu kar\u00e2 sabba dh\u00e0tuvattik-\nesveva santi, tato setiti sayanan karotit yat ho* i.e. Bhu 'be,' and\nkara 'do,' enter into the sense of all verbs; then seti 'he sleeps'\nhas the sense of sayanan karoti 'he does the sleep.'\n\nTHE RELATIVE PARTICIPIAL ADJECTIVE.\n\nThough the Sinhalese participles, both in the active and passive\nvoices, materially differ as regards their inflexions and their forma-\ntion from the Dravidian, yet a peculiarity has been pointed out\nwith reference to their use, as shewing the affinity of those lan-\nguages. It is this\u2014that whenever practicable the Sinhalese as\nwell as the Dravidians use, as adjectives, the relative participles of\nverbs in preference to nouns of quality, or adjectives properly so\ncalled. Now, the Dravidian dialects have no relative pronouns what-\never, and it is on that account they resort to this, if I may so call it,\nmake-shift, a 'relative participle'\u2014a part of speech which is invari-\nably followed by a noun, and which [when not understood] is preceded\nby the words or phrases which depend upon the relative. E.g.,\nv\u00e2rum \u00e2l in Tamil 'the coming person,' for 'the person who comes.'\nThe Sinhalese and the North-Indian vernaculars, however, are not\ndestitute of the relative pronoun. They have ya, yah, yad, 'who,' 'which;' and the same is clearly and distinctly found in the litera-\nture of Ceylon. In the Pansiapanas J\u00e2taka, in which the Trans-\nlators have not disdained to use pure unadulterated Dravidian words\nand phrases, as already shewn, at ante p. 25, we find the relative\npronoun as frequently as in any Sanskrit or Pali work. Here is\nan example. Yam gasak mula sevane s\u00e2tapi yam-ek hunnevi nam\ne gusa attak vevai satpurusa tanette no-bidineya. 'If a person\nrecline under the shade of a tree, even a branch of that tree does\n\n* B\u00e2lavatara; also examine Prof. Mon. William's Sanskrit Grammar, p. 347.\nnot the righteous man break '\u2014' The righteous man does not break even a branch of the tree, under whose shade he reclines.'\n\nThis form of the relative clause, though different from that in which it is expressed in the English, is nevertheless identical with that used in the Pali or the Sanskrit. It may be unsuited, or may, as remarked by a late writer, sound 'ludicrous' to the English ear; yet it must be remembered that it is peculiar to the idiom and usage of Sanskritic dialects. E.g. yena Bhagav\u00e2 [vihari] tena r\u00e2j\u00e2 upasan-kami, in Pali is equivalent to, yam taenaka Buduhu vis\u00e2da, etanata raja p\u00e6m\u00eeniyaya in the Sinhalese. 'Did Buddha dwell anywhere, the king arrived there.'\n\nThough the existence of the relative pronoun in the Sinhalese is undoubted, and there is not a trace of it in any of the Dravidian dialects; yet the use of the relative participle is very frequent and even common in the Sinhalese as in the North-Indian Vernaculars. Caldwell thinks that this is 'through an under-current of Dravidian, or at least of pre-Sanskrit influences\u2014p. 412. I am however inclined to a different belief, not only on account of the simplifying process to which all vernaculars resort, and the undoubted existence of the relative pronoun in the Sinhalese; but because the so-called relative participle is known to Sanskritic dialects and even the Sanskrit as much as to the Dravidian. E.g. bh\u00e2sayantah bh\u00e2nava\u1e25 'brightening rays;' avatarantan munin 'descending sage;' kri-yam\u00e2nan karma 'being-to-be-made act,'\u2014Sanskrit. The use of this relative participial adjective is the same in the Pali, the Sinhalese, the Greek, the Latin, and English. E.g. Sakin vutt\u00e2nti vachan\u00e2ni=varak ki vachana=hapax legomena rematai,=semel dicta verba='once spoken words.'\n\n**Adverbs.**\n\nThe Dravidian dialects have no adverbs at all; and as attempts have been made by some writers to shew that in this respect also the Sinhalese may be identified with the Dravidian, I annex the\nfollowing comparative statement to shew that the Sanskrit, Pali, and Sinhalese adverbs present no great diversity either in form, or in their use. For further examples I may refer the reader to the Sidatsangar\u00e0, Appendix, p. 170 et seq.\n\n| Sanskrit.       | Pali.     | Sinhalese. |\n|-----------------|-----------|------------|\n| Mama puratae    | mama purato | m\u00e0 perata   |\n| Adya gatah      | ajja gato  | ada giye   |\n| Saha nidrayati  | saha niddayati | h\u0113 nidai |\n| Att mah\u0101n       | attva mah\u0101  | it\u0113 mahat  |\n| Div\u0101 y\u0101ti       | div\u0101 y\u0101ti  | daval yayi |\n| Pasch\u0101t tapah    | pacch\u0113 tapo | past tevilla |\n\nIt would thus appear that, whilst the Sinhalese is admitted by Dr. Stevenson himself to be an exception to two out of the ten Grammatical peculiarities which he has cited* to shew a relation between the North-Indian and the Dravidian, there are, as already pointed out, five others [c. g., as regards (1) the inflexion of nouns, (2) the interchange of the nominative and accusative cases, and the formation (3) of the imperative, (4) the present tense, and (5) the infinitive], which bear no analogy whatever to the Sinhalese; that the remaining three are secondary forms, which exist along with a primary Sanskrit form distinguishable from the Dravidian Grammatical system; and that all are traceable to Sanskrit influences. So much for the 'unequivocal proof' of lexical and grammatical analogies. I shall proceed to an examination in,\n\nSECTION FOURTH,\n\nOF SYNTACTICAL ARRANGEMENT.\n\nI am not quite certain whether it is necessary to enter into the Syntax of the languages under consideration, which I have already partially done in the above submitted details, though, perhaps, not so methodically as I could have wished; but, since it\n\n* See Bombay As. Soc. Journal, vol. i. p. 106.\nhas been remarked by the same writer, to whom I have so frequently referred in the course of my remarks, Dr. Stevenson, that the general structure of all [the North and South-Indian dialects] is the same, and has certainly remained unaffected [by Brahmanical influences], a few remarks may not be deemed unnecessary.\n\nMr. Caldwell in summing up all the Syntactical differences between the Sanskrit family of languages and the Dravidian, says:\u2014\n\n\"The situation of the governing word is characteristic of each of these families of languages. In Sanskrit and the Indo-European family it usually precedes the word governed; in the Dravidian and in all the Scythian languages, it is invariably placed after it; in consequence of which the principal verb always occupies the last place in the sentence. The adjective precedes the substantive; the adverb precedes the verb; the substantive which is governed by a verb, together with every word that depends upon it or qualifies it, precedes the verb by which it is governed; the relative participle precedes the noun on which it depends; the negative branch of a sentence precedes the affirmative; the noun in the genitive case precedes that which governs it; the pre-position changes places with the noun and becomes a post-position in virtue of its governing a case; and finally the sentence is concluded by the one, all-governing, finite verb. In each of these important and highly characteristic peculiarities of syntax, the Dravidian languages and the Scythian are thoroughly agreed.\"\u2014p. 36.\n\nThere seems to be some misapprehension here; for I cannot perceive so great a diversity, as here stated, in the construction of Indo-European and Dravidian dialects. I fail also to perceive much difference, in many of the particulars above stated, between the former and the Sinhalese. If the peculiar characteristic in the construction of a Dravidian sentence is, that the governing words are preceded by those that are governed, the Sinhalese, like some of her North-Indian sisters, is certainly an exception, in many respects, to the rule; and, where it is not, it\nis indeed remarkable, that it accords with the Pali or Sanskrit on the one hand, or with the Latin or Greek on the other.\n\nE. g., In the Dravidian as well as in the North-Indian dialects including the Sinhalese, the adjective precedes the substantive which it qualifies: so it does in Pali,* Sanskrit, Latin, and English.\n\n2.\u2014The adverb precedes the verb: so likewise in Latin, and Pali.\n\n3.\u2014The genitive precedes its governing noun: so it does in Sanskrit.\n\n4.\u2014The relative participle precedes the noun on which it depends. Here the relative participial adjective is evidently meant, for there is no relative in the Dravidian dialects. In the use of the relative participial adjective not only the Latin and Greek, but the Pali and the Sanskrit are equally agreed with the Sinhalese.\u2020\n\n5.\u2014The noun which is governed by a verb precedes the latter: so likewise in the Latin and Pali; 6.\u2014The finite verb takes the last place in the sentence: so it does in the Pali and Sanskrit.\u2021 And 7, the negative branch of a sentence precedes the affirmative. This, I admit, is generally the case in the Sinhalese; but there are exceptions to the rule; and an exceptional rendering in one of the examples given below is not the less elegant on that account, like the English sentence\u2014'Not that I loved Caesar less\u2014but that I loved Rome more.'\n\nLet us, in the next place, examine these 'highly characteristic peculiarities' of construction in Dravidian dialects, with reference to the Syntax of a Pali, as compared with a Sinhalese sentence. If, by such comparison I can shew that the Sinhalese approaches very nearly to a very ancient type of the Sanskrit, of undoubted Northern origin, I believe it will be unnecessary to examine the construction of the Dravidian. Proceeding therefore\n\n* Agahita visesana\u00e9 buddhi visessamhi na-uppajjatiti visesananam pabben hoti\u2014B\u0101la-vatara, i.e. 'The mind unembued with the attribute comprehends not the substantive; wherefore the adjective precedes (the noun.)'\n\n\u2020 Vide supra, p. 77.\n\n\u2021 Vide remarks infra.\nto the comparison of the Pali and the Sinhalese, I shall divide my observations into three classes: first their lexical, secondly their grammatical, and thirdly their syntactical analogies.\n\nP\u0101li.\u2014Tissadatta thero kira Bodhi mande suvanna sal\u0101kan gahetv\u0101 ath\u0101rasasu bh\u0101s\u0101su katara bh\u0101s\u0101ya kat\u0113mi-iti pavaresi.\n\nSinhalese.\u2014Tisdat tera van\u0101hi Bodhi mandap\u0113 suvarna (or ran) sal\u0101kava gena daha-ata b\u0101s\u0101ven kavara b\u0101savakin kat\u0101 karam-d\u0113yi p\u0113veri.\n\nEnglish\u2014'Tissadatta ther\u0101 having taken up the gold broomstick in the Bodhi-yard, requested to know in which of the eighteen languages he should speak.'\n\ni. Here are fifteen words, of which two alone cannot be traced to the Pali. They are van\u0101hi and d\u0113yi, both indeclinable particles. Of the others, all which are independent of the Dravidian, suvarna is nearer Sanskrit than the Pali. It is true that the ancient Sinhalese word for 'gold' is ran, different from the above; but even that word is clearly a derivative of the Pali aranna.\n\nii. Though the Sinhalese nominative a ia tera is distinguishable from the Pali; yet the Pali locative e in mande is the same as in the Sinhalese. The similarity in the termination of the verb in the third person singular 'pavaresi' is obvious. The only difference in the grammatical construction of the two languages, as exhibited in the above versions, is that the Pali locative bh\u0101s\u0101su, is expressed in the Sinhalese by the ablative. I have followed the modern usage with a view to exhibit the difference between it and the ancient, which, as we find from the Am\u0101vat\u0101ra and Pr\u0101d\u012bpik\u0101va, preferred the locative. The locative if used in the Sinhalese would not be less elegant than the ablative.\n\niii. Syntactically, it will be observed that every word in the Sinhalese takes the same position which it occupies in the Pali. The nominative is the first word in the sentence; the adjective precedes the substantive; the accusative suvanna precedes the past participle gahetv\u0101, which it governs; the locative mande\ntakes the precedence of the accusative; and the finite verb is placed last in the sentence.\n\n**P\u0101li**\u2014Tan pana tena athhato uggahetv\u00e0 pav\u00e0ritan; na-patisambhid\u00e0ya chitena; sohi mah\u00e0 pannat\u00e0ya tan tan bh\u00e0san kath\u00e0petv\u00e0 ugganhi: Tato uggahethatv\u00e0 evan pav\u00e0resi.

For, being a very wise personage he knew those several dialects by learning: wherefore, being one of (such) acquirements, he so inquired. This is said here (to illustrate) that men acquire a language (by study). Parents place their children, when young, either on a cot or a chair, and speak different things, and perform different actions. Their words are then distinctly impressed on the children (on their minds, thinking,) that such was said by him, and such by the other; and in process of time they learn the entire language.\u2019\n\ni.

The nearness of signification and form of *uggahethatva* to *igemehi-sita* is remarkable; also of *n\u00e0ma* and *nam*; and of *k\u00e0le* and *kala*. Here is an illustration of the Sinhalese words *mavu-piya* for 'father' and 'mother,' being of Sanskrit origin. No Sinhalese scholar, I am persuaded, will introduce into the above sentence *app\u00e1* or *amma*, any more than an English writer would 'papa' or 'mamma.' The Pali *dahara* and the Sinhalese *la-daru* are synonymous, the *la* being in the latter added to mark the 'tenderness' of the infant. The Pali *ti* is expressed by the Sinhalese *yi*, and in the use of them there is not the slightest difference. Again there is not a single word, in the above sentence, which has the most distant relation to the Dravidian.\n\nii. The Sinhalese auxiliary *artayen* is expressed *athato* in the Pali. The passive voice is here undoubtedly expressed by *pavaranaladit*, and *kiyana-ladit*. There is, moreover, no grammatical form that may be pronounced to have had its origin in the Dravidian.\n\niii. In rendering the above Pali passage into the Sinhalese, idiom has rendered the displacement of only two words. One is the negative particle *na*, which, in the Pali, is prefixed to *patissambhid\u00e1ya* when the verb is understood, but which in the Sinhalese should be added to the verb substantive which is generally expressed. The other is the principal verb *vavaatth\u00e1pentu=niyamakara-ganiti*, 'determine,' which in the Pali precedes the quotation following, but which in the Sinhalese follows the passage expressed as the thought that is passing in the children's minds. Adverting to the only remaining analogy to which Dr. Stevenson refers,\u2014that in the Dravidian dialects 'the verb is used, last in the sentence,' I may remark that the difference here between the Pali and the Sinhalese is, that contrary to the position of the verb in the first example, the Pali finite verb in example second does not occupy the last place in the sentence, whilst the Sinhalese verb\ndoes. As already remarked it is a mistake to suppose that this is at all a characteristic which distinguishes the Sinhalese from the Sanskrit; for in the latter, as stated by Professor Monier Williams (See his Grammar p. 348) 'the verb is commonly, though not always, placed last in the sentence.'\n\nSuch is the evidence which I promised to adduce; and so far as historical testimony, lexical, grammatical and syntactical analogies go, I believe I have supported my position with the 'unequivocal testimony' which others have claimed for a contrary theory. Doubtless there are few Dravidian words and Grammatical forms to be found in the Sinhalese; and these, which, like the cases in the desert, are few and far between, I have not failed to point out. But, which is the confessedly Sanskritic dialect that has not departed more than the Sinhalese from its parent stem? In order to establish an original identity between two dialects it is not essential that there should be a resemblance in all their words and Grammatical forms. 'Philology (says Bopp) would ill perform its office if it accorded an original identity only to those idioms in which the mutual points of resemblance appear everywhere palpable or striking; as, for instance, between the Sanscrit dad\u0101mi, the Greek Lithuanian dumi, and Old Sclavonic damy. Most European languages, in fact, do not need proof of their relationship to the Sanscrit; for they themselves shew it by their forms, which, in part, are but very little changed. But that which remained for philology to do, and which (he adds) I have endeavoured to the utmost of my ability to effect, was to trace, on one hand, the resemblances into the most retired corners of the construction of language, and, on the other hand, as far as possible, to refer the greater or less discrepancies to laws through which they became possible or necessary.'\n\nIn the comparisons, however, which I have instituted, it was even unnecessary to resort to the 'most retired corners' here spoken of. For, the resemblance which the Sinhalese bore, both\nlexically and grammatically, to the P\u0101li, and therefore to the Sanskrit, has been found to be so 'palpable and striking' that their relationship appeared at once to be even greater than that between the Sanskrit and the Indo-European dialects. I am fully persuaded that no one, who has followed me closely through the investigations which are here submitted, could fail to notice that the prominent features of the Pali are indelibly impressed upon the very face of the Sinhalese, and so clearly, that it is impossible to deny to them the affinity of mother and daughter. But whether their relationship is so close or more distant, the points of resemblance which I have exhibited between some of the North-Indian vernaculars (so entirely different from the Dravidian), and the Sinhalese, especially in the case of Pronouns, see p. 63; and the still closer resemblance which the Sinhalese bears to the Pali, when compared with the North-Indian dialects, must satisfy any candid mind that the Sinhalese had at one time a local existence in the North of Hindustan, and that her early separation from her Sisters, combined with the help which Pali literature has rendered her, on the one side, and on the other, the implacable hatred of our forefathers towards their Dravidian neighbours which induced her to repel their advances, has enabled her to live upwards of two thousand years without those material changes which her Hindu Sisters have undergone. Indeed, I may remark in conclusion, with far less weighty evidence, than I have adduced, did Professor Max Muller\u2020 lay down his brief, and leave his case in the hands of an English Jury, confident of their verdict as to the relationship of the Hindu, Greek, and the Teutonic. With, however, the venerable authorities which I have cited, the overwhelming results of the cross-examination to which I have subjected the witnesses on the opposite side, and the\n\n* Professor M. Williams's Sanskrit Grammar, p. 348.\n\u2020 Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 11.\nvery strong and irresistible testimony which the P\u00e2li has borne in favor of its relation to the Sinhalese, I believe I have a right to expect that the same English Jury will give their verdict in my favor; and that they will, without retiring from the jury-box, pronounce that 'The Sinhalese is a Sanskritic, North-Indian,\u2014not a Dravidian\u2014dialect.'\nBUDHISM:\u2014A Lecture delivered before the Colombo Young Men's Christian Association; by the late Rev. D. J. Gogerly.\u2014With Introduction by the Rev. John Scott, and Notes by the Rev. D. de Silva.\n\nIn a recently published essay on Buddhism, Professor Max M\u00fcller after referring to the Pali studies of the late Mr. Turnour says, \"The exploration of the Ceylonese literature has since been taken up again by the Rev. D. J. Gogerly, whose essays are scattered about in Sinhalese periodicals and little known in Europe.\" Mr. Gogerly devoted a great part of the labour of forty years to researches in Buddhism as set forth in the original Pali works, and the results of his investigations cannot fail to be of value to the students of a religion which is professed by nearly one third of the human race. The following lecture, delivered in Colombo shortly before Mr. Gogerly's death, contains, it is believed, the latest and most comprehensive account published by him of this strange oriental system of mingled religion and philosophy.\n\nThere are some of the lecturer's conclusions to which it may be desirable to attract attention. For instance, a question much agitated some years ago was, which was the earlier system, Brahmanism or Buddhism? It will be seen Mr. Gogerly holds the opinion now generally entertained, that Buddhism was a reaction against the abuses of the Brahmanical system. The second paragraph of the lecture refers to Goutama's statement that many preceding Buddhas had existed;\u2014possibly some of his doctrines had been\ntaught by more ancient sages, and this fact may have been exaggerated into the notion of the Buddhas of preceding calpas.\n\nA considerable part of the lecture is occupied with Buddha's description of the material universe. This is the weak point of Buddhism, which is thus placed in antagonism to the most obvious teachings of science. These statements are no mere allusions to the popular belief of that period; they are positive and detailed affirmations made by Buddha on the authority of his omniscience. To escape from the difficulty, an ingenious attempt was made a few years ago to prove that these accounts of the universe were to be understood in an allegorical sense. Mr. Gogerly however, in his Christiani Pragnyapti demolished this explanation, shewing that what Buddha taught concerning the world was intended by him to be believed literally, as an essential part of his religion. Thus the states of reward and punishment are assigned to definite localities in the universe, so that if (for instance) Maha Meru is allegorical, the heavenly worlds on the sides and summit of Maha Meru must be allegorical also.\n\nProbably the chief novelty in the following lecture will be the representation it gives of Buddha's doctrines as to a Creator. The usual opinion of persons acquainted with Buddhism has been, that the existence of a Supreme Being was neither affirmed nor denied in this system, the subject being simply ignored by Buddha. This however was not Mr. Gogerly's view. He held that the idea of a Supreme and Infinite Creator was familiar to the mind of the founder of Buddhism, and deliberately rejected by him. Some curious extracts on this subject will be found in the lecture.\nThere are three doctrines closely connected together and singularly characteristic of Buddhism. These doctrines relate to the nature of man, transmigration, and Nirvana. On each of these points Mr. Gogerly's Pali studies led him to conclusions which are clearly stated in the following lecture. First\u2014Buddhism denies the existence of a soul in man; therefore,\u2014Secondly, there can be no transmigration, in the popular sense of the term\u2014there is only a series of beings\u2014the later beings in the series inheriting the merit or demerit of the earlier beings. Thirdly\u2014Nirvana is no Paradise, for when the series of sentient beings comes to an end there is no soul to continue. Nirvana therefore is simply extinction. This is the view of Nirvana held by the highest authorities on Buddhism; and it will be seen that the independent investigations of Mr. Gogerly caused him to arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nThe notes are written by the Rev. David de Silva of the Wesleyan Mission. He was formerly a student of Mr. Gogerly, and has acquired an extensive knowledge of the Buddhist Scriptures in Pali.\n\nBuddhism, which was once the dominant religion of India is now completely unknown in its native country; but when excluded from that region it spread itself in other directions, and at present prevails in Nepaul, Thibet, China Burmah, Siam, Ceylon and other countries, and numbers among its votaries a large portion of the human race. (1.) Brahmanism certainly prevailed extensively at the time\n\n(1.) The Right Rev. P. Bigandet, in his preface to the first edition of the \"Life or Legend of Gotama,\" says of Buddhism, \"that in our own days, it is, under different forms, the Creed pre-\nwhen Goutama Budha was born, for upon his birth Brahmans were consulted respecting the fortunes of the new-born prince (2.) ; and it is stated that the progress of Buddhism was most rapid among the inferior castes: the Kshatriya or Warrior tribe rejecting it from the pride of birth, and the Brahmans from the pride of learning: but the Brahmanism of that period differed materially from that of the present time; no trace appearing in the sacred books of the Buddhists of the worship of Siva and Vishnu. The God to whom offerings were generally made, was Agni, the God of fire. (3.)\n\nvailing in Nepaul, Thibet, Mongolia, Corea, China, the Japanese Archipelago, Anam, Cambodia, Siam, the Shan States, Burmah, Arrecan, and Ceylon.\"\n\nSir Emerson Tennent's Christianity in Ceylon, page 199, tells us the followers of Buddhism amount to more than one-third of the human race. Hardy's Eastern Monachism says, \"It is computed there are 369,000,000 of Buddhists.\"*\n\n(2.) On the birth of Siddharta, 108 Brahmans were brought together, of whom there were eight chiefs; seven of these having observed the 32 attributes of personal beauty in the prince, lifted each two of their fingers, and pronounced, that if he remained a laic he would be universal monarch; if he turned priest, he would become Buddha. Sach\u00e9 agfran wasissati r\u00e9j\u00e1 hoti chak-kawatti. Sach\u00e9 pabbejissati buddhobhawissati,\" while the youngest Brahman Kondanya positively affirmed, that he would not remain a laic but would become Buddha, and lifted up one finger in token of this. (Manorathepurane)\n\n(3.) Professor Wilson, on Rig Veda Sanhita, affirms, that there\n\n* Max Muller in his Essays on the Science of Religion, p. 214, says that Goutama \"became the founder of a religion which after more than 2000 years, is still professed by 456,000,000 of human beings.\" He adds however the following note: \"Though truth is not settled by majorities it would be interesting to know which religion counts at the present moment the largest number of believers. Berghaus in his 'Physical Atlas' gives the following division of the human race according to religion.\n\n| Buddhists | 31\u00b72 per cent. |\n|------------|----------------|\n| Christians | 30\u00b77 \"         |\n| Mohammedans| 15\u00b77 \"         |\n| Brahmanists| 13\u00b74 per cent. |\n| Heathens   | 8\u00b77 \"          |\n| Jews       | 0\u00b73 \"          |\n\n\"As Berghaus does not distinguish the Buddhists in China from the...\"\nThe state of caste at that time was also different from that which prevails at present, the Warrior tribe being regarded as the first, and the Brahmanical as the second in the scale of dignity. Many princes having embraced the doctrines of Buddhism, the Warrior tribe became its supporters, but were ultimately subjected by the ascendancy of the priesthood. Much obscurity rests upon that historical period which we shall not attempt to remove; confining ourselves briefly to the doctrines of Buddha as recorded in their sacred books.\n\nAlthough the present system of Budhism is of comparatively recent origin, Goutama affirmed, that in the most remote ages the doctrines which he taught had been proclaimed by an incalculable number of Buddhas who lived in previous kalpas; as well as by three who preceded him in the present kalpa. The doctrines taught by them are represented as being identical with those of the present Buddha. (4) The whole field of truth is stated to have been open before each Buddha, who is therefore named sabannyu, omniscient; chackhuma, the\n\nis no reference in the Vedas to Trimurti, Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, to Durga, Kali, or Rama, or to any other of the gods that are at present the most popular in India. The principal deities are Agni and Indra.\n\n(4.) When the priests of Buddha were assembled in the sitting hall of Kar\u00e9ru in the garden of Anathapindika at Jet\u00e1w\u00e1na near S\u00e1watty, they were anxious to be taught respecting the former states of existence. Buddha addressing them, says, that 91 kalpas previous to his time there appeared a Buddha whose name was Wipassi; 31 kalpas previous, there was one Sikhi; in followers of Confucius and Laotse, the first place on the scale belongs really to Christianity.\"\nseeing one: He who has an eye seeing in every direction. The Buddhas therefore saw all things with unfailing accuracy, and their teachings agreed with those of Goutama even on the minutest points. But these teachers and their doctrines had been long forgotten before the birth of Goutama Buddha, and he became the unaided re-discoverer of the system. (5.)\n\nGoutama Buddha was born in Kapilawastu, a city in or near to the present province of Oude, in the year 624 before\n\nthe self same kappa there was Wessabhu, in the present Bhadda kappa, there were Kahusandha, Konagamana, and Kassapa and himself. Wipasi, Sikhi, and Wessabhu, were of the Warrior tribe. Kakusanda, Konagamana, and Kassapa were of the Brahman tribe, while he himself was of the Khattia tribe. (Digha Nikaya Mahapadane Suttan). In 30 natural circumstances, all Buddhas agree Sabbe buddh\u00e1nan sametinsawidh\u00e1 dhammat\u00e1 (Sarussanga, page 24.)\n\n(5.) In the Dhammachakkappawattana Suttan, Buddha says,\n\n\"Idan dukkan ariya sauchanti me Bikkhaw\u00e9 pubb\u00e1nanusesth\u00e9su dhamm\u00e9su chakkun udep\u00e1di ny\u00e1nan udep\u00e1di, pany\u00e1 udep\u00e1di wijj\u00e1 udep\u00e1di \u00e1l\u00f3k\u00f3 udep\u00e1di.\u2014O priests! for the attainment of these previously unknown doctrines, this noble truth, that sorrow is connected with existence, the eye was developed within me; knowledge was developed within me; wisdom was developed within me; clear perception was developed within me; and light was developed within me.\"\n\nIn the same Suttan it is said \"Yathochakho m\u00e9 bikkhaw\u00e9 im\u00e9su chatusu ariyasachch\u00e9su \u00e9wan t\u00edpariwattan dw\u00e1das\u00e1k\u00e1ran yath\u00e1bh\u00fatan ny\u00e1nadasassan suwisudhan ahosy ath\u00e1han bikkhaw\u00e9 sad\u00e9wek\u00e9 l\u00f3k\u00e9 sam\u00e1arak\u00e9 sabbrahmak\u00e9 sassumma brahm\u00e1n\u00edya\nthe Christian era. His father was a sovereign prince named Sudhodana. (6.) He was called the Prince Siddharta, and lived in regal splendour till his 29th year. About that time he became disgusted with sensual pleasures; considered the circumstances of disease, decrepitude and death, and being desirous of obtaining deliverance from the continual reproduction of existence, embraced the life of an ascetic and retired to the wilderness. His object appears to have been twofold: 1st, To obtain that complete freedom from the passions and affections which would ensure the entire cessation of his own personal existence: and 2nd, That he might attain to that perfection of wisdom and knowledge which would enable him to teach others the paths of perfect liberty. For this purpose, during six years, he performed painful penances, and his abstinence from food was such that his body was reduced to a skeleton; and, completely exhausted, he fainted and was regarded by his associates as dead. He however revived, and finding no advantage from this course of life he abandoned it, and took the sustenance necessary for the restoration of his bodily strength, and with renewed en-\n\npaj\u00faya sadewemanuss\u00e1ya anuttaran samma sambhodin abhisambuddho patiny\u00e1sin.\u2014O priests! when my perception, relative to these four grand truths, which are threefold, and therefore of twelve kinds, was perfectly clear, then, O priests, I knew I had acquired the most complete and perfect wisdom attainable in the universe, including the human, heavenly and Brahma worlds.\"\n\nIn the Aggappas\u00e1dana Suttan, Buddha is said to have had no preceptor \u00e1cariy\u00f3 atti.\n\n(6) In the Mah\u00e1pad\u00e1ne Suttan, Buddha says \"Om. \u00c1v\u00e1dehi \u00e1dhip\u00e1ttehi \u00e1s\u00f3pann\u00e1yehi vass\u00e1yehi vass\u00e1yehi om. \u00c1v\u00e1dehi \u00e1dhip\u00e1ttehi \u00e1s\u00f3pann\u00e1yehi vass\u00e1yehi vass\u00e1yehi.

(7.) This profound meditation is termed Jh\u0101na, and while the devotee is engaged in these exercises he becomes insensible to all external things: he can neither see, hear, nor feel, but is in a state something similar to that which is called the mesmeric trance, and no means exist by which he can be aroused from this state until the meditation is ended. (8.) Buddha states to the Brahmin Weranjo, that he, being persevering, tranquil in body and mind, pure in heart and free from all sensuality, engaged in examination and research on the nature of things, and thus enjoyed the first Jh\u0101na. Investigation and research being terminated, with a tranquil and self-concentrated mind he enjoyed the serene pleasure of the second Jh\u0101na. Free from the disturbances of pleasure, thoughtful and wise, and healthy in body, he enjoyed the third Jh\u0101na, called the state of thoughtful contentment. Free from the emotions of joy or sorrow, previous exultation and depression being removed, with a contented and holy mind he attained to the 4th Jh\u0101na, being unmoved either by pleasure or pain.\n\nBeing thus mentally tranquil, pure and holy, free from passion or pollution, he recalled to mind former states of\n\n(7) It is no peculiar prerogative of the Buddhas to attain to the jh\u0101na: Brahmans, ascetics, as well as priests, may exercise these meditations (See S\u0101manyaphala Sutta in the Digha Nik\u0101ya.)\n\n(8) In the Parajika section of the Winnaya Pitaka we find, that when Buddha was once residing with 500 priests, in the city of Weeranja, not far from the tree Puchimanda Margos, which was the residence of a demon named Nal\u00e9ru, he gave to Brahman Weeranja the order in which he had overcome sensual gratification and exercised the Jh\u0101na meditation. The Jh\u0101nas are four; first, second, third, and fourth. Buddha had not only exercised these profound meditations and attained to all the\nexistence through many calpas, together with their causes and circumstances.\n\nHe then with a clear and godlike vision, transcending that of men, beheld Beings dying or being born, noble or base, beautiful or deformed; marked their conduct and its results. Having thus attained to a high degree of wisdom, he afterwards ascertained the causes of sorrow and continued existence, and the mode in which the series of existence and the wretchedness connected with it might forever cease. When he had obtained this knowledge he became a Budha, perfect in wisdom, purity and knowledge, and the chief of all existing beings from, the highest Brahma world to the lowest hell; rendering honor to no one as his superior, but being worthy of receiving supreme honor from all.\n\nWe shall now briefly notice his teaching relative to the system of the universe, embracing its inhabitants; and afterwards consider his metaphysical and moral doctrines.\n\nfour, but he had also acquired the three Wijj\u00e1. In this he had succeeded during the same night; he sat down at the foot of the Bo tree determined to become Buddha; the night was divided into three watches. During the first watch, he recalled to mind previous states of existence; one state of existence, two states born in such a place, having such a name, such a tribe, and so on to thousands of births. During the second watch he beheld beings dying, existing, and so on. During the third watch, at the time of dawn, he attained the third Wijja, by which he was not only freed from passion, but also obtained the knowledge of the four grand truths: 1, Dukkha\u2014That every existing thing is a source of sorrow; 2, Samuda\u2014That continual sorrow results from a continual attachment to existing objects; 3, Nirodha\u2014That a freedom from this attachment liberates from existence; and 4, Magga\u2014The path leading to this state. The action of the chicken is compared to the action of a chicken, which by successive operations cleaves the shell and comes forth \"Kukktachch\u00e1pakass\u00e9wa undak-kusamh\u00e1ty.\u2014As the chicken from the egg.\"\nBuddha does not attempt to account for the origin of existing beings; he says \u201cBikhus, the initial point of the series of transmigration is not known: The commencement does not appear.\u201d (9.) He therefore confines his teachings to the system as it is during the present calpa. The duration of a calpa he does not arithmetically define, but uses\n\n(9.) \u0db4\u0dd6\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dcf\u0db4\u0dba\u0da7 \u0dc4\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0d85\u0dad\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd3\u0db8\u0dda.

All large measures of length are computed by yoduns: thus 4 singhalese hetekma, or miles form a gow, or league, and as the hetekma is less than an English mile, the gow or league may be about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles; 4 of these, or about 14 miles, constitute a yodun. (11.) The universe comprises an infinite number of systems or Sakwalas: each complete in itself, having its own sun, moon and stars, and its own heavens and hells. (12.) The Sakwala with which we are connected is surrounded by an immense rocky circle, which is in height 82,000 yoduns or more than\n\nWapassam\u00e9ti, tatiyajjh\u00e1n\u00e9ne, p\u00edtin wir\u00e1j\u00e9ty.

Its worth, previous to its being used, is unspeakable; after it has been used it is worth 30,000 n\u00edlakarshas (of the value of 20 or 30 small silver coins) and even when old it is worth 12,000 karshas. Were a man to take a piece of cloth of this most delicate texture, and therewith to touch in the slightest possible manner, once in a hundred years, a solid rock, free from earth, a yojana high, and as much broad, the time would come when it would be worn down, by this imperceptible trituration, to the size of a mung or undu seed. This period would be immense in its duration; but it has been declared by Buddha that it would not be equal to a Maha Kalpa.\u201d (Manual of Buddhism, page 1.)\n\n(11.) As to the exact size of a yojana it is not agreed. It is more than 10 and less than 16 miles; 14 miles is the nearest.\n\n(12.)

In the Anguttara Nikaya, page 55 Buddha, speaking to Ananda, says\n\n\"In that Sapassadha world there are 1000 moons, 1000 suns, 1000 maha merus, 1000 jambudwipas, 1000 aperagoyanas, 1000 utterakurus, 1000 pubbewid\u00e9has.\" (It is evidently clear that although Buddha does not give a description of the sakwalas, yet he takes it for granted that the popular view of a sakwala is correct, and teaches accordingly). The whole of the Pitakas and Atuwavas were caused to be written by Rahats of eminent power in the cave Al\u00f3ka in the province Malaya in Lanka, under the guardianship of provincial rulers caused to be written (i.e. the whole of satt\u00e1kathan sabban buddha wachanan, the whole of Budha's words with their comments) in books\" (Sarasangaha).\n\n(13.)

(16.) Between these circles and the Sakwala rocks four large continents exist, each accompanied by 500 islands, and separated from each other by stormy seas, so as to be inaccessible to all who are not possessed of super-human powers. The four continents are Jambudwipa (17) to the south of Maha Meru; this is the world inhabited by men: Uttarakura is situated to the north, Aparagoyana to the west, and Purwawideha to the east of\n\nstands encircling that: thus to the end of Assakanna the seven rocks stand in succession encircling Sineru\" (Wisuddhimagga, and comment to the Winnaya.)\n\n(16.) \"Of these the rock Yugandare is forty thousand yojanas beneath the surface of the sea, and as much above its surface; Isadhare forty thousand beneath the surface of the sea, and as much above its surface; in this order the others encircle Maha Meru by half their height.\" (Wisuddhimagga and commentary Winnaya.)\n\n(17.) When speaking of the inhabitants of other Dwipas besides Jambudwipa the continent in which men are said to reside, the word Manussa is used. \"The sphere inhabited by men who arrived from Pubbewidehe was called Widehiratan from its original signification.\" \"The sphere inhabited by men who arrived from Aperagoyana was\nMaha Meru. In reference to this a Pali stanza states:\n\"When the sun rises on this continent (Jambudwipa) it is\nmid-day in Wideha, (18) evening in Goyana and midnight at\nnamed Aperanthajanapada.\" Utterakurutho \u00e1gatha manuss\u00e9hi\n\u00e1wasithappad\u00e9so Kururattanthi n\u00e1man labhi. \"The sphere inha-\nbited by men who arrived here from Utterakuru was called\nKururattan.\" (Mahanid\u00e1ne Sutta wannena.)\n\n(18.) \"When the sun rises in the continent of Goyana, it is midday\nin Utterakuru, evening in the continent of Goyana, and midnight in\nthis continent.\" (Comment on Dijhanikaya.)\n\nIn the Aganya Sutta Wannena it is stated that \"the moon\nresides in the palace of a gem, and the outside is covered with\nsilver, both being cold. The sun resides within the palace of gold,\nand the outside is covered with crystal both being hot. In size\nthe moon is 49 yojanas in diameter, and 147 yojanas in circum-\nference: the sun in diameter 50 yojanas, in circumference 150\nyojanas. The moon is below and the sun above, between them one\nyojana. From the lowest part of the moon to the highest part of\nthe sun, a hundred yojanas; the moon travels in a straight line,\nslowly, and rapid crosswise; on her two sides the planets travel.\nThe moon moves towards them as a cow to her calf; the planets\ndo not change their position. The motion of the sun in a straight\nline is rapid, and that crosswise slow. He is, on the day after the\nnew moon 10,000 yojanas away from the moon; the moon then\nappears like a line; on the second day 10,000 more, thus gradually\ntill the day of full moon, at the rate of 10,000 yojanas, he is\nfarther and farther away from the moon. The moon then gradually\ngrows, and on the fifteenth day is full. Then on the first day,\nagain the sun travels 10,000 yojanas closer; the second day\n10,000 again, till the day of new moon, at the same rate daily.\nThe moon then gradually appearing less on the day of up\u00f3satha\nKuruna,\" for the Sun, Moon and Stars are represented as travelling daily round Maha Meru at the altitude of Yughandera.\n\nIn a sermon on earthquakes (19) in the Anguttara Nikaye Budha states, that the earth rests on water, and that water (new moon) she becomes totally invisible; the moon being below and the sun right above; as the covering of a small vessel by a larger one or the overpowering of a lamp by the sun's rays at midday, the moon is covered by the sun. There are three paths, the goat, the bull, and the elephant, the goats hate water, the elephants desire it, and the bulls desire heat and cold in equal proportions. Therefore when the sun and moon rise up to the goat path, then there is not one drop of rain; when they are on the elephant path the rain pours down as if the heavens were opened; when they rise up to the bull path the seasons continue alike. The sun and moon during six months of the year, move from Maha Meru towards the Sakwala rocks; and during the other six months from the Sakwala rocks towards Maha Meru. In the month of July they move close to Maha Meru, then going off for two months in November they move in the centre; thence going towards Sakwala, move near it three months, then coming off in April they move in the centre, and afterwards, in two months, arrive near Maha Meru. To what extent do they give light? They give light at once to three continents. When the sun rises on this continent (Jambudwipa) it is midday in Pubbewidehe, it is evening in Utterakuru, and midnight at Aperagoyana; when it is rising in Pubbewidehe, it is midday in Utterakuru, evening at Aperagoyana and midnight in this continent. When it is rising in Utterakuru, it is midday in Aperagoyana, evening in this continent, and midnight in Pubbewidehe. When it is rising in Aperagoyana, it is midday in this continent, evening in Widehe, and midnight in Utterakuru (Page 102.)\n\n(19.) The same is stated in the Mahaparinibbana suttan in Digha nikaya.

The four great continents are very frequently spoken of by Budha in his sermons. At the bottom of the system eight principal hells, each accompanied by 16 subordinate hells, are situated. Under Maha Meru is the Asura world. The Asuras were formerly Gods inhabiting the summit of Maha Meru, but they gave way to intemperance so as to become insensible, and Sakra (or Indra) with his hosts, cast them down to the bottom of Maha Meru, and occupied the conquered region.

Asur Rahu desires injury to the sun and moon.\" (Anguttara\u20144th Nipata.)\nshould almost have doubted that this were a doctrine of the Buddhist religion, were it not recorded in two Sutras (22) or discourses of Buddha, in the Sanyutta Nikaya, which forms a part of the three Pitakas. On one occasion Suriya, the God of the Sun, is represented as being in great distress in consequence of the efforts of Rahu to swallow him and his residence. He invoked the aid of Buddha, who rebuked Rahu and commanded him to desist from his efforts. Rahu became terrified, and trembling fled to the Asuralokaya. The Sutra immediately preceding this states that the Moon experienced a similar danger and called upon Buddha for help, who delivered him from the power of Rahu. These discourses, in addition to the one referred to concerning the cause of earthquakes in the Anguttara Nikayo, shew the incorrect nature of Buddha's physical philosophy. On the summit of Mah\u0101Mau, or 42,000 yojanas above the earth, the ch\u0101tummah\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101 heavens are placed, and in succession, above each other; the heavens of yama, tusita, nimmanarati, and paranimmata wasawatti. (23) In this world, and these six heavens, the pleasures of sense are enjoyed, and either virtuous or vicious actions may be performed.\n\nThe period of the life of man in this world is estimated to be about 100 years, that of the gods of the heaven immediately above the earth (ch\u0101tummah\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101) is thus calculated; one day and night, are equal to 50 years of men: 360 of these\n\n(22.) The translation of the two sutras are found in the \"Friend,\" vol. II., p. 228.\n(23.) See Wibhanga section of the Abhidamma Pitaka, also Anguttara, 3rd Nip\u0101ta.\ndays make one year, and the duration of life 500 of these years: the whole period being 9,000,000 years of men.\n\nThe period of life in each ascending heaven is in a four-fold proportion, thus in t\u0101vat\u012bsa it is 36,000,000, in y\u0101ma 144,000,000, in tusita 576 millions, in nimm\u0101nasati 2,304 millions, and in paranimmita wasawatti, the duration of life is 9,216 millions of years.\n\nThe whole of these details are taken from the Vibhanga division of the Abhidarma Pitaka. (24)\n\nAbove these heavens there are 16 Brahma worlds. A birth in the Brahma worlds results from the performance of the four Jh\u0101na, or courses of profound meditation. (25) There are three modes in which the Jh\u0101na may be attended to, the imperfect, the medial, and the perfect.\n\nThe imperfect performance of the first Jh\u0101na, comprehending investigation and research concerning the nature of things, procures a birth in the lowest of the Brahma worlds named brahma p\u0101risajja, the duration of life being one-third of a kalpa. (26) The medial performance of the same Jh\u0101na leads to the brahma purohita Brahma world, in which the duration of life is half\n\n(24.) See Friend, vol. II. p. 65, 66.\n(25.) P\u0101r\u012btta, imperfect; Majjhita, medial; and P\u0101nita, perfect.\n(26.) To what is the initial contemplation of the first Jh\u0101na introductory? The initial contemplation of the first Jh\u0101na introduces to a residence with the gods of Brahmap\u0101risajja. What is the length of their life? One third of a kalpa.\nThe perfect performance of that Jh\u00e1na gives an entrance into the Maha Brahma world, the duration of life being an entire calpa. These three Brahma worlds, the six heavens, the earth, the residence of the N\u00e1gas and Asuras, and the various hells are all destroyed at the termination of each calpa.\n\nThe performance of the 2nd Jh\u00e1na, comprehending the clear and undisturbed perception of truth, procures an existence in the paritt\u00e1bh\u00e1 appam\u00e1nabh\u00e1 and \u00e1bhassara Brahma worlds, the period of life being 2, 4 and 8 calpas. We shall have occasion again to refer to the \u00e1bhassara Brahma world. The 3rd Jh\u00e1na, in which the devotee is free from the perturbations of pleasure or pain, and being healthy in body and in mind lives in the calm and contented meditation on the doctrines of truth, gives access to three other Brahma worlds more exalted than those previously mentioned, the term of life being 16, 32 and 64 calpas. The 4th Jh\u00e1na, in which the passions are so subdued that the devotee is always contented, being uninfluenced by the sensations of pleasure or pain, gives access to the remaining seven Brahma worlds, and the four Arupa worlds. The duration of existence is immense, being from 500 to 16,000 calpas. There is a peculiarity in\n\nIn this order, by means of the Jhanas, residence is obtained in the Brahma and Arupa worlds (Wibhangapprakarana and Suman-galawilasini &c.)\n\nFrom the heaven above, the gods obtain apparitional birth chatumsh\u00e1jiketo patt\u00e1ya uperi d\u00e9w\u00e1 opepatikay\u00e9wa. So the beings in hell and the Pretayas, tatlm nereyika \u00e9t\u00e9spicha; they spring up at once to full maturity, being twelve years old &c., opepatik\u00f3 olawesudd\u00e9siko hutwa, (Suman-galawilasini &c.)\nthe first world in this last series, namely, the asannayasatta Brahma world. In this the duration of life is 500 calpas, but there is only corporeal existence without consciousness: they have neither sensation, perception, thought nor knowledge; but are as beings in a dreamless, profound sleep. The whole of the inhabitants of the Brahma worlds are entirely free from sensual pleasures or desires: they are not subject to the laws of gravitation, but move at pleasure through the atmosphere without obstruction, and their pleasures and pursuits are all intellectual and pure, resembling perhaps what St. Paul meant when he spoke of \"spiritual bodies.\"\n\nIn the four Arupa worlds completing the series, there are no organised bodies, but the inhabitants possess sensation, perception, reasoning, and knowledge or consciousness. I do not clearly understand the nature of the existence or modes of operation in these worlds, and therefore cannot attempt to explain them. The term of life is stated to be 20,000\u201440,000\u201460,000 and 84,000 calpas. This last is the longest possible duration of the existence of any Being.\n\nI have before stated that at the end of a calpa the three lowest of the Brahma worlds, the six heavens, the earth, and all below the earth will be entirely destroyed. The next destruction is to be by fire, and the mode in which this is to be effected is thus stated by Buddha in his discourse on the ascent of seven suns, contained in the Anguttara Nikaya: \"Bikhus, Seneru (or Maha Meru) the King of Mountains, is in length 84,000 yoduns, in breadth 84,000 yoduns, beneath the great sea 84,000 yoduns, and above the sea 84,000 yoduns. A time will come when for many hundreds, thousands, and hundred thousands of years as\nrain will descend from the clouds; in consequence of which cultivated plants and herbs, forests, gardens and trees will become completely dried and burnt up. At the expiration of a long period after this, a second sun will appear, (27), and by the heat of these two suns the small rivers, ponds and lakes will be dried up and disappear. After another long period a third sun will arise, and by the heat of these three suns the large rivers, as the Ganges, the Jumna, &c., will be completely dried up. By the rising of a fourth sun, the seas into which these large rivers flow will be dried up. A fifth sun will afterwards arise, and by the heat of five suns at one time the great ocean (84,000 yoduns deep), will be gradually dried up until only a few puddles remain. A sixth sun will arise, and by the conjoined heat of these six suns, the great earth and Maha Meru will smoke continuously like the skin of a potter. At length a seventh sun will arise; and by the heat of these seven suns, this great earth and Maha Meru, the King of Mountains, will burn, blaze up and become one mass of fire, and the flames will by the wind ascend as high as the Brahma worlds; and by the accumulated heat of the burning and blazing mountain, its rocky peaks, from 100 to 500 yoduns in extent, will be destroyed, and finally this great earth and Maha Meru will be so completely consumed that even ashes shall not appear nor exist. Even as when butter or oil is consumed in a vessel no residuum appears or exists, thus this great\n\n(27.) When there are two suns, one would be rising and the other setting. When there are three, one rising, one setting, and one on the zenith, &c., (Manorathapura\u1e47a 962)\nceed to examine the more prominent parts of its metaphysics. The existence of a Creator of all things, and the dispensation to man of joy or sorrow, Buddha expressly denies; affirming that the pains or pleasures experienced by intelligent beings are not in any way the result of the power of a Creator. He himself claims to be the supreme: he said to Upak\u00f3, an ascetic, who enquired who was his teacher and whose doctrine he embraced, \"I have no teacher: there is no one who resembles me. In the worlds of the Gods I have no equal.\" (30) I am the most noble in the world, being the irrefutable teacher, the sole, all perfect Buddha.\" In the P\u0101r\u0101jika section of the Wissiya Pitaka, Brahmin Weraso, who accused him of not honoring aged Brahmins, of not rising in their presence, and of not inviting them to be seated, he replied, \"Brahmin, I do not see any one in the heavenly worlds nor in that of M\u0101raya, nor among the inhabitants of the Brahma worlds, nor among Gods or men whom it would be proper for me to honor, or in whose presence I ought to rise up, or whom I ought to request to be seated. Should the Tathagato (i.e., Buddha) thus act towards any one, that person's head would fall off.\" And in the J\u0101taka Atuwawa it is stated, that from the lowest hell to the highest Brahma world there is no equal nor superior to Buddha in wisdom, virtue, and knowledge. These assumptions are altogether irreconcilable with the doctrine of a universal Creator, who must necessarily be superior to all the beings formed and supported by him. Buddha says:\n\n(30) \u0db8\u0dda\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d85\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db0\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dc2\u0dab\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dc4\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db1\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd0\u0dad. \u0db8\u0dda\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d85\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db0\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dc2\u0dab\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dc4\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db1\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd0\u0dad. \"I have no teacher: there is no one who resembles me; in the worlds of Gods and so on I have no equal.\"\naware of the doctrine of a Creator being held by the Brahmins, and he endeavours to account for its existence. In the Brahma J\u0101la Sutra, which is the first in the Dirga Nikaya, he discourses respecting the 62 different sects in the philosophical Schools,(31), for they can scarcely be called religions, among whom four held the doctrine both of the pre-existence of the soul, and of its eternal duration through countless transmigrations. (32) (The Buddhist doctrine of \u0905\u0902\u0936\u0902 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0902 is, antecedents and consequents.) Others believed that some souls have always existed while others have had a commencement of existence. Among these one sect is described as believing in the existence of a Creator, and Buddha denies the correctness of this opinion. In explaining how the opinion originated he says: \"There is a\n\n(31.) \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u091c\u0932\u0902 brahmaj\u0101la. Brahminical net. These 62 different philosophical sects are arranged in two general divisions, with their ten subdivisions \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0923\u093f Pubbantha kappik\u0101, philosophers on the past, and \u0906\u092f\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0923\u093f aperantekappik\u0101 philosophers on the future.\n\n(32.) These are \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0902 sassathaw\u0101da, those who hold the eternity of matter and spirit, \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0902 \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0902 \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0902. sassathan ath\u0101nancha l\u014dkancha panaya penthi, they hold the soul and the world to be eternal. They are of four classes, viz.I.\u2014Those who have a recollection of former states of existence from one up to many hundred thousand previous births. II.\u2014Those whose recollection extends from 1 up to 10 \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0902 sanwattawiwatta, i.e., kalpas. III.\u2014Those who remember from 10 up to 40 \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0902 kalpas. The philosophers of these three classes remember he states in which they formerly existed. \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0923\u093f \u0905\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0925\u093f their names, caste, complexion, joys, and sorrows, and the duration of their lives, at the termination of which they were born in another place and thus continued until they attained to their present state of being. The conclusion they draw is \"Eternal are the soul and the world, unproductive of new existence, immutable, firm. Living beings flee away, they travel and fro, they die, they are born, but they (the soul and world)\ntime Bikhus, when after a very long period this world is destroyed. On the destruction of the world very many beings obtain existence in the Abassara Brahma Loka, (which is the sixth in the series and in which the term of life never exceeds 8 calpas) They are there spiritual beings (having purified bodies uncontaminated with evil passions or with any corporeal defilement): they have intellectual pleasures: are self resplendent, traverse the atmosphere without impediment, and remain for a long time established in happiness. After a very long period this mundane system is reproduced, and the world named Brahma Wim\u00e2ne, (the third of the Brahma Lokas) comes into existence, but uninhabited.\"\n\n\"At that time a Being, in consequence either of the period of residence in Abassara being expired, or in consequence of some deficiency in merit preventing him from living there the full period, ceased to exist in Abassara, and was reproduced in the uninhabited Brahma Wim\u00e2ne. He was there a spiritual being: his pleasures were intellectual: he was self resplendent, traversed the atmosphere, and for a long time enjoyed uninterrupted felicity. After living there a very long period in solitude a desire of having an associate is felt by him, and he says, Would that another being were dwelling in this place. At that precise juncture another being ceasing to exist in Abassara, comes into existence in the Brahma Wim\u00e2ne in the vicinity of\n\nremain for ever identically the same.\"\nthe first one. They are both of them spiritual beings, have intellectual pleasures, are self\u2014resplendent, traverse the atmosphere, and are for a long time in the enjoyment of happiness. Then the following thoughts arose in him who was the first existent in that Brahma Loka: I am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Supreme, the Invincible, the Omniscient, the Governor of all things, the Lord of all. I am the Maker, the Creator of all things. I am the Chief, the Disposer and controller of all; the Universal Father. This being was made by me. How does this appear? Formerly I thought, Would that another being were in this place, and upon my volition this being came here. Those Beings also, who afterwards obtained an existence there, thought, this illustrious Brahma is the Great Brahma, the Supreme, the Invincible, the Omniscient, the Ruler, the Lord, the Creator of all. He is the Chief, the Disposer of all things, the Controller of all, the Universal Father. We were created by him, for we see that he was first here, and that we have since then obtained existence. Furthermore, he who first obtained existence there, lives during a very long period, exceeds in beauty, and is of immense power; but those who followed him are short lived, of inferior beauty, and of little power. It then happens, that one of those Beings, ceasing to exist there, is born in this world, and afterwards retires from society and becomes a recluse. He subjects his passions, is persevering in the practice of virtue, and by profound meditation he recollects his immediately previous state of existence, but none prior to that: he therefore says, that illustrious Brahma is the Great Brahma: the Supreme, the Invincible, the Omniscient, the Ruler, the Lord, the Maker, the Creator of all.\nHe is the Chief, the Disposer of all things, the Controller of all, the Universal Father. That Brahma by whom we were created is ever during, immutable, the eternal, and unchangeable, continuing for ever the same. But we, who have been created by this illustrious Brahma, are mutable, short lived and mortal.\"(33)\n\nBy this extract it appears that Budha had a clear perception of the doctrine of a supreme, self existing Creator, yet he pronounces that doctrine to be false, for he says in another part of the same discourse. \"The teaching of those Samanas and Brahmins, who hold that some Beings are eternal and others not eternal, is founded on their ignorance and their want of perception of truth, and is the result of the impressions made upon the senses.\"(34.)\n\nThere are many who are called Buddhists who acknowledge the existence of a Creator: but they do this from ignorance of the teaching of Budha. The Buddhist system\n\n(33.) The second class of philosophers on the past is Ekacha sasatika ekatcha assasatika. These hold that some beings are unchangeable and eternal, and others derived and mutable. Under this head is the passage translated in the lecture.\n\n(34.) These epithets are defined in the comment. The word is explained thus: Patewi himewanta sineru chakkawala mah\u0101 sumudde chandim suriy\u0101cha maya nimmit\u0101ti. \"The earth, the Himala, the Mera, the Sakwala, the great oceans, the sun and moon were created by me.\" This was, Buddha says, an erroneous view of that school. Budha says, again, that there are four subjects improper to think about, schenteiya dhamma, one of which was about the world (as the Comment says, who created the sun, moon, &c.,) if any one would think about them he would turn insane (Anguttara, page 97.)\ndoes not acknowledge the possibility of such a Being existing. (35.)\n\nHaving noticed the tenets of Buddhism respecting a Creator, we will consider what it teaches respecting the nature of man. The whole of the constituent parts of a sentient Being is arranged in five divisions called khand\u0101 or collections: they are the r\u016bpakkhandho, the organized body; vedanakkhandho, the sensations of pleasure pain or indifference; sannyakkhanhdo, or the perceptions; sankharakhandho, or the thoughts contemplations and reasonings; and the winny\u00e0nakhando or the understanding, the consciousness. Except the body there is no entity among these. (36.) There is merely\n\n(35.) The Buddhists in general do now openly deny the existence of a Creator.\n\n(36.) The-Khandas are divided into\u2014I. A'yatan\u0101ni, sentient organs and their relative objects; there are twelve of them classed in 6 pairs:\u20141, chakkhu and rupa, the eye and figure; 2, the ear and sound, sota and sadda; 3, the nose and odour, ghana and gandha; 4, the tongue and flavour, jehwa and rasa; 5, the body and touch, kaya and phassa; and 6, the mind and objects of thought mansa and dhamma.\n\nII. Dh\u00e1tuyo, which are arranged in 6 triplets, as the eye and the figure, and the consciousness of the eye or vision, being the first triplet.\n\nIII. Indriy\u0101ni, the organs and their capabilities; there are 22 of them.\n\nIV. A'h\u0101ra, the food of action, this is fourfold.\n\nV. Phass\u00e9, contact.\n\nVI. Wedan\u00e1, sensation; there are seven of them.\n\nVII. Sann\u00e1, perception.\n\nVIII. Chetan\u00e1, thought.\n\nIX. Chitt\u00e1ni, thoughts. These are included in the five Khandas. The Wedan\u00e1, Sann\u00e1, and Sankhara khandas are elicited by contact with external objects (Wibhangga of the Abhidhamma).\nan organized body, and inherent in this body a capability of sensation, perception, contemplation and knowledge, elicited by contact with other objects: there is no feeling, thinking or knowing soul in a man.(37.) The body itself is mutable, and the other khandha are in a perpetual flux. According to this system, man is never the same for two consecutive minutes: the ar\u016bpadhamma as the whole of the khandha except the body are called, are constantly changing: they are produced, they cease to be, and never remain the same: they are compared to the periphery of a wheel in motion, always altering its position: and to the light of a burning lamp, which though continuing to shine has its rays continually changing. The lamp continues to burn during the whole night, constantly emitting fresh rays: so the man continues so long as his body lives, but the mental processes are constantly changing. This doctrine of Buddha is certainly not held by the majority of the Buddhist laity, and was not, and perhaps up to the present day is not, received by several of the priests, but it is most clearly taught in the sacred books. To clear up this question it is necessary to determine the meaning to be attached to the Pali word atta, translated into Singhalese by the word\n\n(37.) Of Rupa kanda, it is said by Buddha, Rupan bhikkhaw\u00e9 anichchan yadanichchan tan dukkhan yan dukkhan te tanatt\u00e1 yadanatt\u00e1 tan n\u0113tan mama n\u0113s\u00f3 hamasmi nam\u0113s\u014d att\u0101ti. Priests body is impermanent, that which is impermanent is sorrow, that which is sorrow is not the soul, that which is not the soul is not mine, that is not myself, and is not my soul. So of the other four Khandas (Sagyu nik\u0101ya, Sal\u0101yatanewagga).\n\u00e0tm\u00e0ya and which we render \"soul.\" In the Brahma Jala Sutra, Budha states, that some taught that the soul (att\u00e0) is eternal in duration; they said \"living Beings transmigrate: they die, they are born, but their existence continues as being eternal.\" In another part of the same sermon when speaking of the doctrines of the uchch\u00e9\u00e9daw\u00e1da, or those who believe that the soul will be finally annihilated, he relates a conversation between some philosophers: \"Another will reply and say, Friend, I do not deny that there is such a state as you have mentioned, but the soul will not then be annihilated: there is, Friend, another state unknown and unexperienced by you, but known and perceived by me; in that state the form is godlike, the pleasures are mental, and all the powers and faculties are in perfection. Upon the dissolution of that body by death the being is cut off, destroyed and no longer exists.\" These extracts are sufficient to prove that by the word att\u00e0 or soul, is meant an immaterial substance which continues to exist after the death of the body. The Comment states, that there are four leading opinions respecting the nature of the soul, the last of which is, that it remains in the body as a jewel deposited in a casket: and that upon death it flies away as a bird from its cage. There can therefore be no doubt but that Budha attached to the word att\u00e0 the meaning we attach to the word \"soul.\"\n\nWe have already noticed that the whole constituent parts of a man are divided into five but there is also another arrangement called \u00e1yatana or residences: they are the six personal ayatana; viz. the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the understanding;\nand the corresponding external \u0101yatana, figure, sound, odours, taste, touch, and material or immaterial objects. Budha declares that none of the khandh\u00e1 or \u0101yatan\u00e1 constitutes a soul.(38) There is also a more compendious arrangement into n\u0101mar\u00fapa, the r\u00fapa signifying the body,(39) and the n\u0101ma, the intellectual faculties; this is frequently used in the writings of Budha. Concerning the kh\u00e1ndh\u00e1 he says, \u1e5bupa anatt\u00e1 chava\u1e43 \u015b\u0101lyo d\u0101rav\u012b r\u016bpasya sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na bhikkhawe anatt\u00e1, weda\u1e47a anatt\u00e1 sanny\u0101 anatt\u00e1, sankh\u0101ra anatt\u00e1 winny\u0101nan anatta\n\n(38.) \u1e62bl\u0101, \u1e62atkriya r\u016bp\u0101ya\u2014\u015baksha. \u015b\u016b\u1e47i, \u1e63v\u0101ga. \u1e62atkriya s\u0101ya \u015a\u0101pa\u1e45n\u0101.

Buddha, in the Wibhangsa section of the Abhidhamma defines what n\u0101mar\u00fapa N\u0101mar\u00fapa is ta\u1e47ha\u1e47\u1e47a. \u1e62bl\u0101 \u1e5aupa\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e47a sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na Tathakatham\u0101na Winn\u0101naparichay\u0101 n\u0101mar\u00fapan atthi\u1e47\u0101nam attiri\u1e47\u0101pan. What, are the N\u0101ma R\u00fapa resulting from consciousness? there is N\u0101ma, there is R\u00fapa, sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na d\u0101ra\u1e45g\u012b sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na d\u0101ri\u1e45gam\u0101 \u1e5bupa \u1e5bupa ther dadu\u1e45kha\u1e45ga.

What is R\u016bpa? The four elements and a form produced from the four elements. This is called R\u016bpa. Here we do not see that the \u1e5aupa\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e47a is included in sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na, but it must be borne in mind that it depends for its existence upon N\u0101ma and R\u016bpa sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na, \u1e5bupa \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na \u1e5aupa \u1e5aupa sa\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101na samud\u0101ya samm\u0101n\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa nirodh\u0101 win\u00f1\u0101na nirodho. With the origin of N\u0101ma r\u016bpa is the origin of Winy\u0101na, with the cessation of N\u0101ma r\u016bpa is the cessation of Winy\u0101na.\n\"Bikhus, the body does not constitute a soul, the sensations do not constitute a soul, the perceptions do not constitute a soul, the reasonings do not constitute a soul, the consciousness or understanding does not constitute a soul.\" Thus he affirms of each of the khand\u0101 that it is not a soul. Again he says \u1e5b\u016bpa \u0101v\u0101c\u0101ya \u0101y\u0101ya \u0101v\u0101c\u0101ya \u0101y\u0101ya \u0101v\u0101c\u0101ya \u0101y\u0101ya \u0101v\u0101c\u0101ya \u0101y\u0101ya \u0101v\u0101c\u0101ya \u0101y\u0101ya r\u016bpan bhikkhawey, anatt\u0101 yopi hetu yopi pachchayo r\u016bpassa upp\u0101d\u0101ya sopi anatt\u0101 anatt\u0101 sambhutan r\u016bpan kuto att\u0101 bhavissati. \"Bikhus, body is not a soul: if there be any kind of cause for the production of body, that cause also is without a soul: how can body become a soul since it is produced by soul-less causes?\" He repeats the same verbatim concerning the sensations, the perceptions and the reasonings: and although some unlearned Buddhists have supposed that the \u1e5b\u016bpa winny\u0101nan is a transmigrating soul, Budha says. (40) \"The understanding or consciousness (\u1e6dh\u0101na winny\u0101nan) is not a soul: if there be any cause by which the \u1e5b\u016bpa winny\u0101nan is produced, that cause also is without a soul: how can \u1e5b\u016bpa winny\u0101nan be a soul, seeing it is produced by soul-less causes?\"\n\nTo remove all doubt respecting his doctrine being that a soul does not exist, we refer to his conversation with \u1e5b\u016bpa Susimo Paribb\u0101jiko. Budha says, \"Susimo, the body, the sensations, the perceptions, the reasonings, the understanding or consciousness (enumerating each distinctly) whether past, future or present, whether internal or external, whether gross or minute, base or excellent, remote or near, are not mine; none of them constitute \"I.\" None of\n\n(40.) See Salayatana section of Sanyut Nik\u0101ya.\nthese are to me a soul. This is known by true wisdom.\" This teaching, which is again and again reiterated, is clear: there is no soul: nothing of which an individual may say, \"This is I.\" Body exists; the other khandhas are only functions of the living body, produced by the contact of external objects with the bodily organs. The same doctrine is enforced, in similar language respecting the eye, the ear and other bodily organs, together with the mano, or winny\u0101nan or understanding, the seat of which is the heart, as the eye is the seat of vision; this is repeated respecting the various organs, both individually and collectively. (41)\n\nBut how does this affect the doctrine of transmigration, or more properly the continued processes of perpetuated existence? In the book called Milinda Prashna, or the Questions of King Milinda, the subject is discussed by the king and the learned priest N\u00e1gas\u00e9na. This work is of high authority among the Buddhists, although not one of the Sacred Books. The term n\u00e1mara\u00fapan is frequently used in this discussion, comprising all that we mean by body and mind. I shall omit the Pali, merely giving a translation of the conversations.\n\nThe King enquired, Lord N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, what is conceived (in a new birth)? The Priest replied, the body and mind\n\n(41.) So of all the other Khandhas (Sanyut Nik\u00e1ya also Budha's conversation with Anuruddha).\nGreat King, are conceived. But, Lord N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, are this same body and mind (namar\u00fapan) conceived? No, Great King, this same body and mind are not conceived: but by this body and mind good or evil actions are performed, and in consequence of these actions another body and soul are conceived (t\u00e9n\u0101 kamm\u00e9na annyan namar\u00fapan patisandahati.)\n\nTo remove all doubt the King enquires, saying \"Lord N\u00e1gasena, you have spoken of namar\u00fapan. Of these what is N\u00e1ma and what is R\u00fapan? Great King, is any thing material (olarikan) that is R\u00fapa. Is any thing immaterial (sukum\u00e1) the thoughts, they are N\u00e1ma.\" Thus namar\u00fapan is represented as constituting the whole man, body and soul, and the doctrine clearly laid down is one of antecedents and consequents. (42) A man performs good or bad actions: this is the antecedent. Because of these actions another Being, another body and mind are produced: this is the consequent. They are in no sense the same: the latter is a result of the former, but there is no transmigrating soul. The King does not appear satisfied, and prosecutes his enquiries: saying, \"Lord N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, does conception take place without any being transmigrating? Yes, Great King, conception takes place without any Being transmigrating. How does this take place? explain it by a metaphor. Great King, a man lights one lamp from another lamp: does the one lamp transmigrate to the other lamp? No, my Lord. In the same way, Great King, conception takes place without transmigration.\"\n\n(42.) Milinda is referred to in Manorathepureni comment on Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya, page 5.\nThe King further enquires, \"Lord N\u00e1gas\u00e9na is there any Being who transmigrates from this body to another body? No, Great King. But, \"Lord N\u00e1gas\u00e9na, if there be no Being who transmigrates from this body to another body, is there not a deliverance from the consequences of evil actions. True, Great King, if there be no conception there is deliverance. By this body and mind good or evil actions are performed, and in consequence of those actions another body and mind are produced, and therefore there is not deliverance from the consequences of sin.\"\n\nBudha explicitly declares that sin and punishment are necessarily united. But it appears that it is sin that is punished, and not the sinner. To avoid the difficulty connected with this doctrine, the Buddhists say, that although the child born is not the same with the man who previously existed, he cannot be said to be entirely a new Being, because his present existence is the result of actions performed by a person who formerly existed, but who is now non-existent; and they illustrate it by the metaphor of a mango-tree. A mango from the tree having been eaten the stone is planted, and a fresh mango-tree is produced, which is not properly a new tree but a continuance of the old one, being produced from it. (43) But according to this, the son must be the same with his father, being produced by his instrumentality. The mango-tree metaphor is this: the mango tree represents an existing man: the mango fruit the good or evil conduct of that man: as from a stone of that tree another tree grows which is not altogether different from the first tree being a result of that first tree,\n\n(43.) This metaphor of the Mango tree is also used by N\u00e1gas\u00e9na (Milinda Prashna.)\nso from the good or bad actions of a man another man is produced, who is not properly another but a continuation of the first. The metaphor will not bear strict investigation; but the doctrine of Budha undoubtedly is, that the performer of an action is not the recipient of the result of that action. In the Sanyut Nikaya it is stated that a Brahmin came to Budha and asked, \"How is it Goutama, Does he who has performed actions (in a previous birth) experience (in this world) the results? Brahmin, the doctrine that he who has acted receives the result is one extreme (the \u1e63assata w\u0101d\u0101 or doctrine of the perpetual existence of a transmigrating soul.) How then, Goutama, does one person perform the action, and another person endure the results? Brahmin, the doctrine that one person performs the action and that another person endures the result is the other extreme (the uchch\u00e9daw\u0101d\u0101 who teach the annihilation of an existing soul.) The Tagato avoiding both these extremes preaches a middle doctrine: namely, that in consequence of ignorance, merit or demerit is accumulated, &c., declaring the doctrine of the patichcha samupp\u0101do which we shall examine hereafter. We quote part of another discourse, where the subject is more fully declared: The Paribajako recluse, named Timbaruko, come to Budha and said, Goutama, does a person receive happiness or sorrow as the result of his own conduct (in a previous state?) Budha replied, Not so, Timbaruko. What Goutama! does he receives happiness or sorrow as the result of another person's conduct? Not so, Timbaruko. What Goutama! does he receive happiness or sorrow as the result of the joint action of himself and of some other person? Bagawa replied, Not\nso, Timbaruko. What then, Goutama, does a man receive happiness or joy, irrespective of his own conduct or the conduct of others? Not so, Timbaruko.\" (44) He afterwards declares that he has abandoned the doctrine of a transmigrating soul, as held by the sassatasawad\u00e1 and also the excision of an existing soul, as held by the uch'chedawad\u00e1 and has chosen a middle doctrine, and then recites the patichcha samuppada which appears to be the key of his philosophical position, explaining the processes by which existence is perpetuated. (45) We must in endeavouring to explain this, quote the Pali and afterwards state the meaning.\n\n(44) The conversation with Timbaruka is found in Suyutta Nik\u00e1ya, page 1, the Pali is\n\n(45) See note 30.\nIn consequence of ignorance, merit or demerit is produced. In consequence of merit or demerit the consciousness, in consequence of consciousness the body and the mental faculties, the six organs of sense; in consequence of the six organs of sense, touch or contact (or the sensation of touch); in consequence of contact the sensations, in consequence of the sensations desire, in consequence of desire an attachment to existence, in consequence of attachment or cleaving to existence, a place of birth; in consequence of a place of birth, birth itself; in consequence of birth decay, death, grief, weeping, pain, discontent and dissatisfaction are produced. It is then added, that a complete cessation of ignorance, necessarily results in a cessation of all the consequents, so that being itself becomes extinct. It will be observed, that the intervention of a previously existing soul, or of a creator, or even of parents, is not regarded as necessary to the completion of this chain of existence; the two first as being non-existent; the other (parents) as that which may be for the production of the body, but which is not absolutely necessary, as in many instances the\nformation, (which Turnour in his translation of Maha Wanso calls \"the apparitional\" appearance) supersedes the necessity of parents, as in these instances merit or demerit leads to the instantaneous and full development of a perfect man or woman, as well as of the gods and the sufferers in the hells.\n\nThis account appears to be very unphilosophical and confused. In the Vibhanga division of the Abhidarma, the terms used are clearly defined: thus \u0905\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 awijj\u0101 or ignorance is defined to be the ignorance of the four principal doctrines of Buddha: (46) they are 1. That sorrow is connected with existence in all its forms. 2.\u2014That its continuance results from a continued desire of existence. 3. That a deliverance from existence and its sorrows can only result from the complete extinction of this desire: and 4thly. That this extinction can only result from a course of pure morals, eight divisions of which are specified.\n\nFrom this ignorance \u0905\u0915\u0941\u0936\u0932\u0924\u093e sankh\u0101ran results, which is defined to be \u0915\u0941\u0936\u0932\u0924\u093e kusal\u0101 and \u0905\u0915\u0941\u0936\u0932\u0924\u093e akusal\u0101 or merit and demerit, accumulated in the various worlds of gods and men, or of the Brahma gods, or of the inhabitants of the Arupa\n\n(46.) \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0925\u093e \u0915\u0925\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0905\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 dukkh\u0101 ann\u0101nan dukkha samuday\u0101 ann\u0101nan dukkha nirodh\u0101 ann\u0101nan dukkha nirodha gaminiy\u0101 patipad\u0101ya ann\u0101nan ayan wuchchati awijj\u0101.\n\n(47.) \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0925\u093e \u0915\u0925\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0905\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 pachchhay\u0101 sankh\u0101ra punn\u0101bh\u0101 sankh\u0101ro apunn\u0101bh\u012bsankh\u0101ro anujabhisankh\u0101ro k\u0101yasankh\u0101ro wachisankh\u0101ro chittasankh\u0101ro. Of these what is the \u0905\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 sankhara resulting from ignorance? accumulation of merit and demerit, merit accumulated in the Arupa worlds; that of bodily actions, of words and of thoughts.\nIn the case of any individual coming into existence, this sankhara is the merit or demerit of the acts of his immediate predecessor in that chain of being. From this sankhara winnyanan is produced, which is defined to be the consciousness of the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the understanding, which form the six Ayatana and are not in existence until after the body is formed: winnyanan therefore can only be understood as signifying a power hereafter to be developed, when the organs have come into existence and come in contact with external objects. How consciousness can exist in the abstract, without the existence of any conscious being, is difficult if not impossible to understand. This undeveloped consciousness is regarded as the antecedent of body and mind, and this body and mind as the antecedent of the organs of the body and mind.\n\nThe winnyanan or consciousness, which is the third in this chain of existence, is declared to be the winnyanan or consciousness of the organs of body and mind which are the fifth in the series. All this unphilosophical confusion of thought and expression is used\n\n(48.) tattha kataman sankharaappachchaya winnanan chakkhuwinnanan sotawinnanan ghana winnanan jihawinnanan kaya winnanan manowinnanan idan vuchhati sankharaappachchaya winnanan. What is the Winnana the consciousness, the consequence of Sankhura, the consciousness of the eye, the consciousness of the ear, the consciousness of the nose, the consciousness of the tongue, the consciousness of the body, the consciousness of the mind, this is the consciousness, the result of Sankhara.\n\n(49.) See Dhamma chakkappa wattana suttan.\nto avoid the necessity of acknowledging the existence of a creator. We may observe that the \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0937\u094b or \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0937\u0902 does not signify that by which a thing is made or produced, but that which is the antecedent of the thing produced, and without which the thing would not be. Thus the beautiful organization of the body, with all its indications of a designing and powerful architect, is stated to be the consequent of its own consciousness: and the eye with its complicated mechanism is represented as being the consequent of the \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0937\u094b chakkh\u00fawinny\u00e1nan or the eye consciousness: and the same holds good with respect to the other bodily organs. Besides, in this passage the \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0937\u094b sank\u00e1r\u00e1 are not existing things, but merely the qualities of actions previously performed, and Budha teaches, that the qualities of actions performed by a Being (whether man or animal) now non-existent, is the efficient cause of the production of the body and mind of a new Man, without the intervention of any active agent. This I believe is a correct statement of the doctrine of the \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0937\u094b p\u00e1tiecha-sammupp\u00e1d\u00e1 so far as the production of the body and mind of man is concerned.\n\nThe doctrine of Nirwana is intimately connected with the preceding. The word \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923 nirwana (from \u0928\u093f ni, a negative, and \u0935\u093e\u0923 w\u00e1na desire) signifies a complete freedom from desire, and this necessarily leads to a complete cessation of existence. Thus at the close of Budha's first discourse at Benares, having stated that he has experienced this cessation of \u0924\u0928\u094d\u0939\u093e tanh\u00e1 or desire, he observes, \u0905\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093f \u0928\u0924\u094d\u0925\u093f \u0926\u093e\u0928\u093f \u092a\u0941\u0928\u093e\u092d\u0935\u094b. \"This is my last birth; henceforth I shall have no other state of existence\" and at the close\nof his discourse called Brama J\u00e1la (50) he says, Bikhus, that which binds the Tatagato (i.e. Budha) to existence is cut off, but his body still remains, and while his body remains gods and men perceive him; but at the end of life, when the body is dissolved neither gods nor men will perceive him; that is, he will no longer exist. (51)\n\n(50.) \u0915\u093f\u0902\u0935\u0926\u0902 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947\u0928\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0943\u0939\u093f\u0923\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947\u0928\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0943\u0939\u093f\u0923\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0902 bhik khawe tath\u00e1gatassa k\u00e1yo uchchinna bhawanetiko titthati assak\u00e1y y\u00e1wa thassati t\u00e1wa dewa manuss\u00e1nan dakkhinti (see the English in the Lecture).\n\n(51.) There was a controversy at M\u00e1tara some years ago on the subject of Nirw\u00e1na; one party holding that it was the entire cessation of existence, while the opposite party held that some part of the Wi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na (consciousness) existed and enjoyed perfect happiness, although none but a Rahat could explain the nature of that existence nor its enjoyment. Mr. G.'s view is the correct one, according to Buddhism there is nothing immortal. When Buddha died it is stated that Sakray\u00e1 uttered the following stanza,\n\nanichch\u00e1watan sankh\u00e1r\u00e1 upp\u00e1dawaya dhammino upajjitw\u00e1 nirujjhanti t\u00e9asanvupasamo sukhoti. \"Truly the Sankh\u00e1r\u00e1s, the component parts of human nature, are impermanent; their nature is to come into existence and die. Being born they disappear; their \u00fapap\u00e1wupasamo complete subjection is happiness. Then the Priest Anuraddha rehearsed this G\u00e1ta, Asall\u00edtena chittena wedananajjha wasayi pajjotassewa nibb\u00e1nan wimokhochetasaahuti. With a firm mind he bore the pain, as a fire which extinguished itself the mind became free (from every thing existing) (Mahaparinibbana Suttan.)\n\nAs the Patichcha samupp\u00e1da gives the consequence of ignorance and so on, the complete cessation of ignorance necessarily results in a cessation of all the consequents, so that the being himself ceases to exist. It is said j\u00e1t\u00ed nirodho j\u00e1ra marana Soka paridewa dukkha domanassup\u00e1yas\u00e1 nirodho. from the cessation of birth is the cessation of decay, death, sorrow, crying, pain, disgust and passionate discontent. Thus this whole body of sorrow ceases to exist. (Sanyut Nik\u00e1ya.)\nNirvana is represented by the metaphor of a large fire which has burnt itself out, and by a lamp the oil-and wick of which are completely consumed so that nothing remains. Nirvana is the entire cessation of existence. It differs from annihilation, as that supposes that an existent soul has been destroyed, whereas according to Budha there is no soul in existence which can be annihilated.\n\nThe morality of the Buddhist system is pure, no vice being tolerated. The five precepts binding on every Buddhist are:\n\n1. Not to destroy animal life,\u20142. To abstain from stealing.\n3.\u2014To abstain from lying,\u20144. To abstain from illicit intercourse with women, and 5.\u2014To abstain from drinking intoxicating liquors. (52) In addition to these precepts, tale bearing, slander, harsh and injurious language, envy and anger are prohibited, and the opposite virtues are recommended. Almsgiving is specially recommended, and the most excellent of all gifts is stated to be that of religious instruction. (53) Budha, however, only legislated for his priests; with respect to others he was only a Teacher. (54) His commands respecting the morals of the Priesthood are contained in the P\u0101r\u0101jika and Pachitti sections of the Winiya Pitaka. A digest of these laws, called Pr\u0101timoksha is directed to be read in each Chapter of the Order on the\n\n(52.) \u091c\u0940\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0923 p\u0101natip\u0101ta taking away life, 2 \u0905\u0926\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0928 adinn\u0101d\u0101na theft (lit taking that which is not given) 3 \u0905\u092a\u092e\u093e\u0923 mus\u0101v\u0101da lying 4 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u0947\u0939\u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e michehch\u0101h\u0101ra, illicit sexual intercourse 5 \u0938\u0941\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0947\u0930\u092f\u093e \u092e\u093e\u091c\u091c\u092a\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0926\u0924\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928\u093e sur\u0101meraya majjapam\u0101 datth\u0101na.

The laws respecting ecclesiastical discipline are contained in the Maha Waggo and Chula Waggo of the Winiya Pitaka, but the subject is too large to be entered upon in this lecture. Great care has been taken to ensure the moral purity of the Priesthood, and to preserve peace and harmony between its members; with what success it is not easy to state. The distinctions of Caste are not admitted in the Priesthood. (55)\n\n(55.) Budha says: By birth there is no chand\u00e1la, by birth there is no Brahmano, by actions there is chand\u00e1la, and by actions there is Brahmana.\n\nWhen king M\u00e1dhura waited on the priest Mah\u00e1kachch\u00e1na and said, \"Venerable sir, the brahmins are of high caste, other castes are low, the brahmins are of white caste, others are of black caste; the Brahmans are pure, those who are not Brahmans are not so, the Brahmans are the only beloved sons of Brahma, they proceed from his mouth, begotten by Brahma, created by Brahma and are inheritors of Brahma.\" The Priest replied, \"It is so, Venerable sir, the brahmins are of high caste, other castes are low, the brahmins are of white caste, others are of black caste; the Brahmans are pure, those who are not Brahmans are not so, the Brahmans are the only beloved sons of Brahma, they proceed from his mouth, begotten by Brahma, created by Brahma and are inheritors of Brahma.\"\nThe legends of Budhism are numerous, many are contained in the Pansya panas Jataka book, and in the Ras\u0101 Wahini. (56) The Singhalese translation of these latter tales being contained in Saddharma Alank\u0101ra, I give a sketch of one of them exemplifying the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties.\n\nHISTORY OF DARMA SONDA.\n\nLong after the doctrines of Budhism had been forgotten and a comparatively short time previous to the appearance of another Budha, a desire to know what the doctrines of that religion were, sprang up in the minds of individuals. Among them was a King of Benares, named Dharma Sonda. After he was established in his kingdom, he became deeply impressed with the importance of religious knowledge. He\n\n(56.)

It is however written in easy but very elegant P\u0101li, and is generally the first book the P\u0101li student is required to construe.\nthought much on the subject, and considered that a Prince without a knowledge of religion, was like a man, ornamented with jewels, but destitute of garments requisite for the purposes of decency. He communicated his thoughts to his councillors, and enquired if any of them could either instruct him or tell him where he could obtain information on this important subject. The noblemen of his Court acknowledged their inability to give their Sovereign the information he required. The King then directed the public crier to make proclamation, that if any individual could explain any of the doctrines of Budha he should be munificently rewarded, upon communicating his knowledge to the King. He afterwards sent an elephant laden with the most costly treasures, round the city, promising to bestow the whole upon any person who could communicate to him any portion of the teaching of a former Budha. Not meeting with success he afterwards offered to become the personal slave of any one who could recite to him only one stanza spoken by a Budha.\n\nHis mind became exceedingly agitated with this unquenchable thirst for religious knowledge, and he determined to leave his kingdom in charge of his Chief Ministers while he sought in foreign lands the information he so much desired. During his travels he entered a thick forest, and regardless of the fierce animals who dwelt there, entertained a hope that he should succeed in his efforts even in that unpromising place.\n\nWhen a peculiarly meritorious act is performed by any person, the Crystal Throne of India (or Sakraya, the King of the Gods residing on the summit of Maha Meru,) becomes hot, and by this his attention is directed to the\ncircumstance. In consequence of the eminent merit of the proceedings of Darma Sonda, the throne of India became heated, and the God, perceiving the whole of the circumstances, determined to assist him. For this purpose he assumed the form of a fierce man-eating demon, and armed with a sharp sword and a massy club, and with blood dripping from his jaws, stood before the King. The Prince was unmoved by his fierce appearance, but hoping to obtain, even from him, the knowledge he so earnestly desired, courteously addressed him, saying, O thou who inhabitest this delightful forest, I have left my kingdom in search of religious knowledge. Are you acquainted with any of the teachings of Budha? The demon replied, I know one stanza. Will you communicate it to me, said the Prince. What reward will you give to your teacher, asked the demon. Were I in my kingdom, observed the Prince, I would reward you most liberally, but in this forest I have nothing but my person to present to you. That will be sufficient, said the demon, let me eat you. But, asked the Prince, how can you instruct me after you have eaten me? And how can I teach while I am hungry, replied the demon. But I will propose a plan by which both of us may be gratified: and turning towards a rock perpendicular on one side and a yodun (about 14 miles) high, which he had miraculously formed, he said, Do you see this rock? Ascend to its summit, and I will stand here below. I will open my mouth wide, and you must leap from the rock into my mouth, and during your descent I will repeat a stanza spoken by a Budha. Agreed, exclaimed the Prince, and moralising as he went ascended the mountain. When he had gained the summit, he cried out, Demon, attend! teach\nme while I make my leap: and so saying, he sprang from\nthe rock towards the extended jaws of the demon: but\nIndra assuming his own proper shape, received the King\nin his arms, conveyed him to the summit of Maha Meru,\nand after having treated him with the highest respect,\nplaced him upon his throne, and repeated the following\nstanza:\n\nanicheha wata san-\nkh\u0101ra upp\u0101da waya dhammino uppajitwa nirujjanti t\u0113san\nwupasamo sukho.\n\n\"The component parts of human nature certainly are\nmutable: they are things produced and destroyed. Being\nborn they cease to be: Happiness consists in their com-\nplete subjection.\"\n\nMany tales, equally improbable might be produced, but\nlittle of the doctrines of Budha can be derived from them.\n\nIt is hoped that the sketch of Budhism contained in this\nLecture will be found correct, as it is drawn from the most\napproved Pali authorities.\nDescription of two Birds new to the recorded Fauna of Ceylon.\n\nBy H. Nevill, Esq.\n\nThe announcement that two birds have been discovered new to the recorded Fauna of the Island, which I to-day have the pleasure of making to the Society, is accompanied by circumstances rendering it noteworthy.\n\nBoth species are from the country round Nuwara Eliya, and both are already known as denizens of the Nilgherry Hills of the continent.\n\nThe first, a solitary snipe, possesses no great interest, as the birds of that genus are known to have a wide range; but the second, a Flycatcher of feeble flight, is one of those instances of the repetition of a species in isolated localities, that for the present are unaccountable, and act as a bar to all but idle speculation; and, as it is only by patiently and carefully tracing each link, that we can hope ever to find the original chains that bound our Island to the Continent or other tracts now covered by the sea, each species held in common between two such widely separated highland districts, brings us a step nearer to the original bond of affinity or source of community.\n\nThe Snipe, Scolopax nemoricola, Hodg., is found among low bushes at the edge of swampy Patina lands, and is scarce.\n\nIts flight is similar to the first rise of the Woodcock, but it drops quickly, as that bird does at certain seasons; and hence it is very probable that the Scolopax rusticola, L., entered as a native of Ceylon in Sir E. Tennent's list of\nbirds, is no other than the present species. However, as *S. Rusticola*, L., has been frequently obtained in India, it is much to be desired that sportsmen would forward skins for identification.\n\nThe Flycatcher, *Leucocerca fuscoventris*, Frankl., affects the edges of jungle, living in pairs, though occasionally two or more such pairs associate, and perch on the topmost twigs of the brushwood, whence they flit after passing insects.\n\nThese, a Pericrocotas, and the Blue Creeper, *Denarophila frontalis*, Horsf., have a curious habit of accompanying each other in quest of food; probably the two former follow to catch the insects started from moss and lichen by the active Creepers, though possibly they merely unite to guard better against the swoop of the Hawk and Kestrel.\n\nWhichever it may be, this peculiarity struck me most forcibly, when sitting hidden among the hills, I have gazed at the dark and lifeless shade around, and been almost startled by the noisy twittering of the three allies, exploring the recesses of the old Rhododendron trees above me before passing on to other haunts, leaving the forest as silent as before.\n\nI append a very brief description of each species for information of any one who may take an interest in our Ornithology.\n\n*Scolopax Nemoricola*, Hodg.\n\nThis species is very similar in general plumage to the common snipe, *Gallinago gallinula*, L., but may be at once distinguished, by the whole of the plumage beneath being barred with dusky brown.\n\nMr. Hodgson remarks, \"its general structure is that\nof a snipe, its' bill a woodcock's, and the legs and feet are larger than in Gallinago.\"\n\nLength, 12\u00bd inches, Extent 19\u2014of wing, 5\u00bd\u2014bill 2\u00bd tarsus, 1\u00bd\u2014Weight, 6 oz.\n\n*Leucocercae fuscoventri* Frankl.\n\nPlumage above, dusky black\u2014head, cheeks, and chin, black. Beneath, white, somewhat tinged round the vent and under tail coverts. Breast, broadly banded with mingled black and white Tail dusky, lighter (save on the central feather) at the tips. Irides brown. Bill and legs, dark.\n\nLength 6\u00bd inches\u2014wing, 3\u2014tail, 3\u00bd.\n\nThis species may be at once distinguished from *L. compressirostris*, Blyth, by its breast band, which resembles in colour the fur of the Chinchilla.\nDescription of a New Genus and five new Species of Marine Univalves from the Southern Province, Ceylon.\u2014By G.

R. Blake.\n\nThe Dutch Records preserved in the Colonial Secretary's Office consist of a great number of volumes and embrace a vast variety of subjects. The curious investigator will have his labours amply rewarded by the rich store of materials which those records will furnish on almost every given subject; historical and political; educational and ecclesiastical; foreign and domestic; despatches to Holland and Batavia; official letters civil and military; reports concerning tanks and cultivation, pearls and cinnamon; instructions to Dissavas; terms of contract with natives; treaties with foreign powers; sailing directions for Indiamen, and orders of battle for ships of war, &c. &c. Intermingled with these and other important matters, one will not only meet with a very orthodox Protestant catechism for young people, but what also may have been regarded by the sedate Dutch matrons of the period as equally orthodox and important, a recipe for the making of beer!\u2014not indeed the veritable beer of Europe\u2014the offspring of malt and hops\u2014but some colonial invention, and designated either Klein bier or Zet bier. The brave soldiers of the garrison of Colombo were found to be poisoned by abominable mixtures sold in the market under the respectable\nname of beer; the supply ships from Holland used to arrive only once in a twelve-month; and the soldiers, like all brave warriors of ancient and modern times, would have their beer. It is no wonder then, that in going over the multifarious records of the Dutch period, that I happened to light on a notice of Robert Knox and his companions in the sad state of their captivity.\n\nThe first notice that I happened to discover is to be found in the 2nd volume of the Dutch records, in a Minute of Council, dated Saturday, 18th September, 1660. In this document mention is made, not indeed of the arrival of the frigate Ann (which was commanded, as is well known, by Captain Knox, senior) at the Bay of Cottiar, but of its sudden departure, \"sailing away from Cottiar, and leaving her Captain and some of the crew in captivity among the Kandians.\" The Government is also informed by the authorities at Trincomalee, that the crew of the English vessel had come on shore at Cottiar, cleared the jungle, and cut palisades with great labour and trouble, with the view of erecting a fortification; and that a raging fever had made great havoc amongst them, sweeping away nine of them, and leaving twenty-five in a miserable condition. The Council express their astonishment on hearing these things, and appear to be at a loss whom to blame the most, whether the Kandian monarch, whom they suspect of bad faith, or their good friends and allies the English; and finally resolve to adopt effectual measures for securing the island against foreign invasion, and guarding against the treachery of Rajah Singha. The next notice occurs in the 7th volume, where we find a Minute of Council, dated Monday the 21st, and [Thursday] the 24th October, 1669, which an-\nowers to the 10th year of Knox's captivity. This Minute is as follows:\n\n\"By the Englishmen who, some years ago, came on an embassy to Cottiar, and were carried captive by Rajah Singha, and have to the present time been forcibly detained, an ola, inscribed in English, and secretly despatched in the hands of a Malabar named Perga, for the purpose of being conveyed to Madras, having been handed by the said bearer to His Excellency the Governor, it is translated and reads as follows:\n\n\"Honored Sir Edward,\n\n\"In the year 1664, we received a packet marked 61, and particularly addressed to us, which is all that we have received, although Mr. Vassal* has received some, but concealed the fact from us, and money too, which we have not once received, though our neediness is so great. Our comrades are all still alive and in health. Only Arthur Emery, the Captain, and John Gregory are dead. There are twenty-three of us alive at present, who would be glad to regain their liberty. As for news, we dare not write any, fearing that our note may be intercepted or miscarried; and we refer you to the bearer, Perga, who can inform you of all that has passed better than we can write. He has hazarded his life in carrying this. We intreat you to\n\n* This man, Mr. William Vassal, was one of the crew of the ship \"Persia,\" wrecked upon the Maldives in the year 1658.

Knox gives particulars about him and his companions in ch. 4, part IV, of his account of his captivity.\nreward him liberally. The Dutch are not so careless as to let him pass unperceived. If you can by any means send some assistance, as the bearer Perga can direct you, to us poor afflicted captives, we shall not cease to implore for you long life, health, and prosperity, while we remain your Honor's servants.\n\n(Signed) John Loveland,\nRobert Knox.\"\n\nThe writing in the margin, is as follows: \"Zealand, 21st August, 1669.\" The direction was, \"Into whatever good Christian hands this note shall come, we pray, for God's sake, to aid in forwarding it.\"\n\nThis translation having been read, the Minute proceeds to state:\n\n\"With reference to the forementioned ola, it being considered that we and the English nation are not only neighbours, good friends and allies, but especially also of the same religion, and are consequently so much the more obliged in conscience, among other things to afford them help in their necessity, so far as the circumstances of time and place permit, in a more especial manner at present, when the aforesaid bearer is persuaded by His Excellency to go up again, in order to carry to them some relief and return with further intelligence, it is, for these and other weighty reasons, (and also that we may hereafter send through the same some support to our own poor countrymen,) found good and understood, to send back the said ola-bearer, with a sum of 50 gold pagodas for the maintenance of our aforesaid good friends and allies, and as much of clothing\nas he may dare, and can conveniently, carry on his shoulder as a chitty, and also a note written in English as well as in Dutch, enclosed in a quill, and containing as follows:\n\n\"To all our good friends and dear allies, the honorable officers, and captives of inferior rank of the English nation.\n\nBeing informed of your great need and wretchedness, we cannot refrain from performing the Christian duty of assisting you with such articles of clothing as the bearer will deliver to you, together with 50 pagodas ready money. We have sent to Madras the ola addressed to Sir Edward, as well as a copy of this. Send back the bearer as soon as possible, that we may see whether through his fidelity, we could, to some extent, assist such of our own countrymen as are suffering great want [like yourselves].

We remain, your good friend,\n\nRykloff Van Goens.\"\n\n\"Colombo, 22nd October, 1669.\"\n\nAfter this the Minute proceeds in the following strain.\n\n\"And since we find ourselves obliged to forward the ola to Madras as early as possible, to the end that the friends of these men there may become acquainted with the condition of their poor countrymen, it is resolved to send the forementioned ola, by the first opportunity, to Mr. Paviloen, Governor in Coromandel, who shall thence forward it to Madras, together with a despatch to the English authorities there, conceived in the following terms:\u2014\n\"To His Excellency the Governor presiding at Madras on behalf of the Honorable Company of the illustrious English nation.\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"Three days ago, a black man, calling himself Perga, appeared before me in Colombo, and placed in my hands the accompanying note written on the leaf of a sugar tree,* and from it Your Excellency will learn the wretched state of your people, and their great necessity, which permits not of being any longer neglected. We have assisted them with some clothes, and 50 pagodas ready money, which the abovementioned Perga has undertaken to convey to them without fail, and return, on a promise of a reward of 20 pagodas; and we hope we shall always be able by means of him, to help both your people and ours.

Of our people there are living 18 or 20 persons out of 64, the rest having been put to death, after being distributed, like your own people, in the King's Court and in other places round about Kandy. One of your people was lately put to death for having broken a porcelain dish in the palace. We hope that God will at length be moved with compassion, and make provision for the release of these wretched men. We shall all take great pains to attain this end, seeing that we are now, (praise God) arrived so far by our outposts that we can reach both your people and ours in two days. But the whole of the way lies through dense jungles, and over wild mountains, which we may pass more by wariness, consideration, and secrecy, than by violence. Let me assure you that we will not be remiss, but attempt every thing in our power to bring out both your people and ours, without distinction, from their captivity. May God Almighty, whom we ought to pray to and call upon, bless this resolution!

S. Coles.\n\nThe subjects of the following paper are extracted from a portion of the Canonical Books of Buddhism, which, as far as we know, has not generally been unfolded to Oriental scholars and philologists. It is well known to all whose investigations have been carried on in this direction, that the Canonical Books of the Buddhist system have a three fold-division, and are designated the Tun Pitakas, or The three Caskets. The first of these is called the Winiya Pitaka, from the root \"Ni\" \"to guide,\" with its intensive prefix \"Wi,\" and signifies, propriety, good conduct, or discipline; and it is in this latter sense especially that this word is used as a distinguishing epithet to the first five books of the Buddhist Scriptures, which entirely belong to the Priesthood, and contain injunctions and regulations relative to their moral and official course of actions. And inasmuch as the contents of these books afford us information on Buddhism as it practically existed in the time of its founder, we are bound to examine them carefully and impartially, to see whether the theories advanced in the Sutta Pitaka, the portion delivered to the laity, and which contains the doctrines of Buddha, are there maintained. It is well known that as to its doctrines, Buddhism is a system of Atheism, since, according to its tenets, there is no Creator nor Preserver of the Universe; no one to reward the virtuous or punish the ill-doer; but that every animal is ever serving under one master\u2014\"Kamma,\" the fruit of actions; and that every state which he arrives at is determined by his previous deeds. Buddha never rewards nor punishes. He was only the Teacher, and declared that\nobedience to his commands would, ipso facto, bring a reward superior to that of all other religions.\n\nWith regard to these moral precepts it must also be borne in mind, that they are not exclusively Gotamo Buddha's; in fact it may be doubted whether he even laid claim to originating any one of them. He himself declared that his Dhamma (doctrine) was like that of the former Buddha's; which evidently means that he learnt it from other religious teachers of his time, especially the Brahmans; and a very superficial glance at the Vedas and other books of the early Brahmans will convince any one that Gotamo, in addition to his inward monitor, that judge of right and wrong, had ample materials around him, to mould up into a religion, so far resembling Brahmanism as not to make it unnecessarily distasteful to the populace, and at the same time so different, that he might hope to break the yoke of the Brahman priests, which was galling to the people, but more especially to the kings. It would be interesting to note how far the parallelism extends in the case of North Indian kings favouring Buddhism in order to rid themselves from the pretension of the Brahmans, and that of the monarchs of Western Europe countenancing the Reformation in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, so that they might deliver themselves from the yoke of Rome; but we must haste on to the consideration of the matter now before us, and remind our readers that as regards his Dhamma,\u2014the doctrines revealed in the Sutta Pitaka,\u2014Buddha claimed no authority except that of a kind of temporary omniscience, possessed by him only at such times as he wished, by means of which he declared the four paths of virtue, with their fruition, and the summum bonum, Niwan.\n\nBut when we descend to the Winiya Pitaka, Buddha appears to us in a new light. He is there the Primate and\nChief Shepherd of the Buddhist Church\u2014the master of his servants the Bhikkhus (priests) and the Father of his clerical family. He claims here the power not only to legislate but also to execute, and was the judge to give sentence when any one of his laws had been violated. The remarkable feature in these laws however is, Gotamo never legislated for the Bhikkhus until some one of them had committed an act in direct opposition to the general tenour of the religion.\n\nThe name of the first book in this division is the P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 Book, from the root \u201cji\u201d to conquer; with two prefixes, \u201cpara\u201d and \u201ca,\u201d the former meaning other, foreign, &c., and the other a particle of negation. Consequently, the meaning of the whole is overcome or defeated. There are four P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1s or defeats mentioned in the book called Methuna Dhamma P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, Adinna D\u00e1na P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, Manussa Wiggaha P\u00e1r\u00e1jika, and Uttari Manussa Dhamma P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, and the meaning of each of the several terms is:\u2014The cohabiting P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1; the taking of things not given P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1; the man-tormenting P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1; and the assumption of superhuman powers P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1; or, more briefly, cohabitation, theft, murder, and the unwarranted assumption of superhuman powers and faculties.\n\nThe nature of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jika fault is thus defined by Buddha; \n\n\u201cSeyyath\u00e1pi n\u00e1ma sisachchinno abhabbo tena sarira\u00f1 bandhanena jiwitu\u00f1 Ewamewa Bhikkhu methuna\u00f1 Dhamma\u00f1 patisewitw\u00e1 assamano hoti asakya puttiyo tena wuchchati p\u00e1r\u00e1jika hoti.\n\n\u201cAs one who has been decapitated is unable to live by tying the head to that body, so a Bhikkhu who has been guilty of the Methuna Dhamma fault becomes excommunicate\nand a non Sakya son. On this account he is said to become guilty of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jika fault.\"\n\nAgain; Seyyath\u00e1pi nama pandupal\u00e1s\u00f3 bandhana pamutto abhabbo hari-tattaya.

Tena wuchchat\u00ed P\u00e1r\u00e1jika hoti.\n\n\"As in any way when the head of the Palmyra has been cut off it cannot be raised to the same place, i.e., re-united, so a Bhikkhu with a sinful and premeditated desire having declared that he possesses the Uttari Manussa Dhamma (Superhuman powers) which does neither belong to him nor exists (as far as he is concerned), becomes excommunicate and a non Sakya son. On this account he is said to become guilty of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jika fault.\"\n\nFrom the above extracts it is evident that a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 is an irremediable breach of discipline, and its meaning is that any Bhikkhu who has thus become guilty can never in this life become an Upasampad\u00e1 (superior) priest. Beside the P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1s there are lesser faults, the nature of which is determined by various causes, as will subsequently appear. These are Sangh\u00e1disesa, Thullachchaya, and the Dukkata faults, and can all be easily remedied, the two latter especially, as after a fault of this kind has been committed, the culprit has only to confess to his Upajjh\u00e1 (ordinating priest) without much delay, and is then exempted from all evil consequences; but the Sangh\u00e1dises\u00e1 being more serious (about half of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1) a course of penance has to be submitted to, and confession without delay made to 25 superior Bhikkhus. The nature and extent of these penances are not defined in the first book of the Winiya Pitakas, but in others, to which reference will be made when those books are brought under consideration. Suffice it to say, that they can possibly have no deterring effect on crime, but rather form loopholes through which most enormous and disgusting misdeeds may be committed, and yet the perpetra-\ntor may remain not only as a Buddhist, but a Bhikkhu; and what is more remarkable is, that crimes the most abominable were judged to be less heinous than others for which some possible excuse might have been pleaded on account of natural desires and the force of temptation.\n\nBut we must leave it to all intelligent readers to draw their own conclusions from premises which we will advance, by giving a succinct and faithful account of the contents of the P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101 book.\n\nThis book opens with an account of Gotamo Buddha's disputation with Weranja Brahman, who accused the former of being an uncivil, destitute, unpractical, scoffing, domineering ascetic, and barren person. Buddha accepted all these epithets, but dexterously changed their signification so as to declare by them the nature of his religion, and explained how he arrived at the Buddhahood. The Brahman became a convert, and requested Bhagaw\u00e1, the blessed one, (the title of Buddha used almost exclusively in this portion of the Buddhist Scriptures) to come to his neighbourhood and pass the Was (rainy) season there. Bhagaw\u00e1 assented and Weranja Brahman departed.\n\nAn account is then given of the manner in which the Great Moggallano, one of the especial favourite Bhikkhus, desired to overturn the surface of the earth, that he might provide the Bhikkhus with the edible crust of honey to be found beneath. Bhagaw\u00e1 objected to this, saying, \"It will disturb the animal creation if such be done.\"\n\nAnother favourite Bhikkhu, Sariputto, asked Bhagaw\u00e1, why it was that the Brahma chariya, (state of celibacy,) enforced by some previous Buddhas, lasted for only a short time; and why that of others was of long duration. Bhagaw\u00e1 answered, that the first mentioned Buddhas were easily discouraged, and enunciated their Brahma chariya before the proper time; and\nthis caused a speedy declension; the others were however more wary and successful.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Was season, Bhagaw\u00e1 informed Weranja of his intention to depart, and went to various cities and provinces. It is difficult to surmise as to what could have been the purpose of inserting the above mentioned matters in the commencement of the book, as they appear to have no connection with the name nor general subjects therein contained. I have thought it possible, that Bhagaw\u00e1, if the order of the subjects may be ascribed to him, from the brief mention of former Buddhas having promulgated, some at the proper time and some prematurely, their laws and discipline, wished to intimate that his system could not be declared till the fit opportunity had arrived.\n\nWe next come to the subject matter of the book, the four P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1s; and first in order is the Methuna Dhamma P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1. This commences with an interesting story of Sudinna, the only son of a wealthy Chetty who became a Bhikkhu, relinquishing his possessions, and forsaking his wife before she had any child. Shortly after he was very much persuaded by his relatives to come and dwell with them again as a layman; but being invincible on this matter, they requested that he would only cohabit with his former wife, so as to preserve the family name and possessions from extinction. After much persuasion, he thus far consented, and in due time a child was born; but the whole course of nature was disturbed at the deed, and the gods of the upper and lower worlds were greatly moved. Sudinna was called into the presence of Bhagaw\u00e1, and severely reprimanded, but he endeavoured to excuse himself because the injunction prohibiting cohabitation with women had not yet been delivered. Bhagaw\u00e1 then reminded him that there was the Dhamma in existence condemning evil desire, hatred, and\nignorance, the three-fold sources of all evil; and issued his P\u012bma P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101 injunction, declaring that if any Bhikkhu should cohabit with a woman, he became guilty of a P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101 and excommunicate. It must be remembered that Sudinna was exempt from this, as his fault was committed before the injunction was given. The Bhikkhus however were not slow in discovering a way of evading this enactment, and one of them in Wesali, (probably Oude,) cohabited with a female monkey, and afterwards excused himself by saying that the previous injunction was given with regard to women and not beasts. Bhaggaw\u0101 then declared that he henceforth prohibited cohabitation with beasts.\n\nOne would be inclined to think that the matter would have been finally settled here; but no, Bhikkhus disrobed themselves for the nonce, and as laymen satisfied their brutish appetites. Men with men, men with demons, with neuters, with Hermaphrodites are reported to have done those things which it is a shame even to speak of. Every possible plan was frequently employed to evade the enactment, and yet satisfy the more than brutish desires; and when their ingenuity was exhausted with regard to the living, the Bhikkhus turned to the dead, in order apparently to prove to their master that howsoever his enactments might abound, their sins could still keep ahead, and they could discover loopholes of escape. If the corpse was free from decay the fault was a P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101, but if not it was only a Thullachchaya or Dukkata. Several instances of the latter are enumerated as having been committed with skeletons, skulls &c.,* but these were declared to be only minor faults and easily\n\n---\n\n*Tena khopana samayena a\u00f1\u00f1ataro Bhikkhu siwathikan gantv\u0101 ye bhuyyena khayitap sarirap passitwa tasmin Methunap Dhamma; patisowi.

Very many instances are given of the Bhikkhus submitting to a little gentle violence, and afterwards declaring to Bhagaw\u00e1 that there was no volition on their part. He declared that then there was no culpability.\n\nThe account of the four P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1s does not occupy more than half of the book of that name, the remainder being devoted chiefly to details, with the greatest minutiae, of sins of self-defilement, onanism, and its kindred abominations; because in the eyes of the Great Teacher, the pure and sanctified Bhagaw\u00e1, they were less heinous than cohabiting with one's former wife, or stealing an article to the value of a p\u00e1da.\n\nThere are many reasons for believing that this book contains, on the whole, a true account of events which actually did take place. There are very few instances of oriental exaggeration, as found in the Commentaries, to be met with here. Bhagaw\u00e1 has generally only 500 Bhikkhus with him, who live and act in a manner which we know exists in India. The locality in which the various deeds were done is very limited, and the crimes mentioned are in many cases those which are peculiar to such semi-civilized countries.\n\nThe Second P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, called Adinna d\u00e1na P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 relates to stealing; and here too the enactment was preceded by a crime which compelled Bhagaw\u00e1 to declare that henceforth such deeds should be denominated P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 faults. The crime mentioned was as follows:\u2014A Bhikkhu, the Venerable Dhaniyo, was much troubled by grass women and collectors of firewood,\n\nTassa kukkanuchcha\u1e47 ahosi.

To prevent the recurrence of this, he resolved to make use of his knowledge as a potter, he being of that caste, and formerly very expert in his profession, and erect a house, like the tub of Diogenes, similar to a water vessel, of only one piece, from clay burnt hard. His efforts were crowned with complete success, the house was completed, was of a brick red colour, and sounded like a bell when struck; but the poor man had scarcely finished his work and gone off to collect alms, when Bhagaw\u00e1 saw the strange structure and enquired whose it was. Being informed that it was built by the Venerable Dhaniyo, one of his Bhikkhus, he exclaimed \"Go, O Bhikkhus! and smash it.\"\n\nShortly after the owner returned, and his chagrin may be more easily imagined than described. Bhagaw\u00e1 severely censured him, because by such actions damage would be done to insects, worms, &c. Dhaniyo then had recourse to an old friend, a conservator of the royal forests, and requested him to supply him with timber suitable for a wooden house. The keeper declared his inability to give without permission from the king. Dhaniyo said, \"I have permission,\" and took some timber which was near a certain city. The timber was missed, and the conservator called to account for it. On his way to trial he was met by the Venerable Dhaniyo, who promised to haste to the king, and explain the matter; otherwise the conservator might lose his life. He accordingly went and reminded the sovereign of M\u00e1gadha Seniyo Bimbi Saro, that when he was crowned, he promised to all ecclesiastics \"firewood, grass and water.\" The king acknowledged this, but replied that by the promise of firewood, timber was not included, and severely reprimanded the Bhikkhu for his dishonesty. People in general took up the matter, and the whole company of Bhikkhus was charged with\npilfering and theft. Bhagaw\u00e1 speedily collected his Bhikkhus, censured Dhaniyo, and declared, that if any Bhikkhu with a dishonest purpose shall take a thing not given, he shall become guilty of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 and excommunicate. Several hundreds of instances are then given of the Bhikkhus evading or endeavouring to evade Bhagaw\u00e1's enactments, by taking goods from places which he had not then specified, or of such a value as not to come within the definition of the P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 fault. Thus when Bhagaw\u00e1 had prohibited taking things in the jungle, the Bhikkhus took from the villages, and when that had been prohibited, they said the command applied only to things on the ground, and took those which were on a table or any other article of furniture; things suspended in the air, in the water, &c. The P\u00e1da is mentioned as the value necessary to make the fault a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1. This was a coin of gold or silver equal to five m\u00e1sas, the latter weighing about $4\\frac{1}{2}$ grains each.\n\nThere are three degrees of guilt mentioned as connected with stealing any article:\u2014(1) Approaching, examining and feeling with a dishonest purpose the property of another is a Dukka\u1e6da fault; one only requiring confession to a superior Bhikkhu.\n\n(2.) Shaking the article is a Thullachchaya fault, only a little greater, and atoned for by confession.\n\n(3.) Removing it from its place is a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1.\n\nWe now proceed to give a brief summary of the Third P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, called Manussa Wiggaha P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, which relates to murder. This too opens with the story of Migalandaka Bhikkhu, who, for the purpose of appropriating to himself the bowl and robes of the Bhikkhus, went about sword in hand and promised any one who wished speedy deliverance from this evil world and admission into a better, to fulfil their desire by the weapon he carried about with him. It seems that\nmany believed his word, for he succeeded in disposing of the lives of 60 Bhikkhus before Bhagaw\u00e1 returned from a season of meditation in the wilderness. On his arrival, Buddha in a long discourse descanted on the moral benefits to be derived from slow and systematic breathing, and at its close severely reprimanded Migalandaka for his wholesale murders, and declared, that if any Bhikkhu wittingly take away the life of a man, or take a weapon in his hand for that purpose, he becomes guilty of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1. Afterwards some Bhikkhus who had become attached to the wife of a sick devotee, assured him that death was far preferable to life, as by its means he would enter on a state far superior to any he could possibly anticipate here. He listened to their advice, refused food and medicine, and died. His widow however spread an ill-report of the Bhikkhus, and Bhagaw\u00e1 declared, that if any Bhikkhu henceforth persuade a man to die, he shall be guilty of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 fault and excommunicate.\n\nA vast number of instances are then given of Bhikkhus taking away life, yet so as to evade previous prohibitions, and in many cases they were successful. Thus, a Bhikkhu ordered a Bhikkhu, saying, take away the life of such an one. \"This is a Dukka\u1e6da fault. He, mistaking his victim, murders another man. The originator is not guilty, but to the perpetrator there is a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1.\n\nAgain, A commands B to tell C to tell D to tell E to take away the life of F. This is a Dukka\u1e6da fault. E consents; this is a Dukka\u1e6da. E kills F; the originator is not guilty; but to D and E there is a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1.\n\nThese two instances, extracted from a large number, are quite sufficient to enable us to estimate the standard of morals which Bhagaw\u00e1 established for the Bhikkhus, and which they very frequently sought to evade.\nThe fourth P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, is called Uttari Manussa Dhamma P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, or the false assumption of the powers of Rahatship.\n\nHere too we have a story of Bhikkhus finding it difficult to obtain a sufficiency by alms-asking, except they could lay claim to supernatural powers; and so they agreed that they should say of each other that such an one was arrived at the 1st Jh\u00e1na,* another at the 2nd, another at the 3rd, and another at the 4th. Such an one was come to Sota, another to Sakad\u00e1j\u00e1ma, another to An\u00e1g\u00e1mi, and another was a Rahat; the several states approaching Niwan. This plan perfectly succeeded, and the people brought many offerings; but Bhagaw\u00e1 when he had called them and made inquiries, declared, that if any Bhikkhu for the sake of gain shall henceforth thus act, he will become guilty of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1. It is unnecessary to adduce instances of the ingenuity of the Bhikkhus endeavouring to transgress this command; they are quite equal in number to those enumerated in relation to the first three P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1s.\n\nI proceed to give a translation of a portion of the P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 book. I have in this translation given as literal a rendering as possible, not because it is the best form, but because it gives the mode of thought and expression found in the P\u00e1li language. This will be appreciated by the philologist, as it will enable him to make comparisons between this and other languages, and the tyro in P\u00e1li will be much assisted in understanding the composition of sentences in this language.\n\n* A state of superior knowledge, of which states there are four. See ante, p. 94, et seq.\nTranslation of the P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 Book.\n\nWorship to him (who is) the Blessed, the Sanctified, the True, the Omniscient Buddha.\n\nAt that time Buddha the Blessed one dwelt in Weranja, at Naleru, near the root of the Margosa tree, with about 500 of the assembly of the Excellent Bhikkhus (1). Weranja Brahman heard that the Religionist, the truly blessed Gotamo, the son of Sakya (2), of the Sakya family, having become a religious ascetic, lives at Naleru in Weranja, at the root of the Margosa tree, with about 500 of the assembly of the Excellent Bhikkhus. There is such a good and high report (concerning) Gotamo, the Blessed. And so this Blessed one (is a) Saint, a True one, and Omniscient, Proficient in Wisdom, and arrived at a virtuous disposition. He who knows the world, who is the subduing charioteer of men, the Teacher of gods and men is Buddha, the Blessed one. He having obtained his own great wisdom, declares this world, the Divine, the M\u00e1ra (3), the Brahman, the Samana Brahman, the Sentient, the Regal and Human (worlds). He preaches Dhamma (4), and declares the Brahmachariya (5), which is perfect as regards time and quality, meaning and grammar.\n\n(1.) Bhikkhu\u2014A person who lives on fragments; a Buddhist Priest.\n(2.) Sakya\u2014The reigning race at that time in India; Buddha was of this race.\n(3.) M\u00e1ra\u2014The Personification of death. The great opponent of Buddha.\n(4.) Dhamma\u2014Doctrine, also order, thought, &c.\n(5.) Brahmachariya\u2014Celibacy, chastity, continence.\nVery well! Such a form has the appearance of Rahatship. Then Weranja Brahmin, Was Bagaw\u00e1 in any place (1) came to that place; and having arrived and accosted (him) concluded with Bhagaw\u00e1, a complimentary conversation, sat down on one side. Weranja Brahman, who was seated on one side, said this to Bhagaw\u00e1:\u2014It has been heard by me, O virtuous Gotamo, that the Samana Gotamo neither salutes reverently nor stands up (before), nor invites to a seat, decayed, reverend, aged, ancient Brahmans. So it is, O virtuous Gotamo, that the virtuous Gotamo neither salutes reverently nor stands up (before) nor invites to a seat Brahmans who are decayed, reverend, ancient, arrived at old age. This is not proper, O virtuous Gotamo that it should be so.\n\nI do not perceive, O Brahman, either in the Divine M\u00e1ra Brahman, Samana Brahman, Sentient, Regal or Human worlds, beings who may either be worshipped, or stood up before, or invited to a seat by me. O Brahman, if Tath\u00e1gato (2) were either to worship, or stand up before, or offer a seat to any one, his head would fall off.\n\nThe illustrious Gotamo is uncivil.\u2014O Brahman, there is a cause, and by that cause it may well be said, that the illustrious Gotamo is uncivil. O Brahman, these, viz., taste, the desire for form, sound, smell, taste, and feeling, are separate from Tath\u00e1gato, and like the palmyra cut up at the root, which has no further existence nor another birth. This is the rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said, that the Samano Gotamo is uncivil; but not on the account of which you speak.\n\n(1.) A set form in the Pali, used, as there is no relative pronoun. More lit.: \"By what was Bhagaw\u00e1? By that he came.\"\n\n(2.) Tath\u00e1gato\u2014Various meanings, as, \"he who thus has departed,\" or, \"he who thus came.\" The Teacher.\nThe illustrious Gotamo is destitute.\u2014O Brahman, there is a cause, and by that it may well be said, the Samano Gotamo is destitute. O Brahman, these, viz., food (objects) for form, sound, smell, taste, and feeling are separated from Tath\u0101gata, and like the palmyra cut up by the roots, which has no further existence nor future birth. This is the cause, O Brahman, and by that it may well be said, the Samano Gotamo is destitute; but not on the account of which you speak.\n\nThe illustrious Gotamo is unpractical.\u2014There is a rule, O Brahman, and by that it may well be said, that the Samano Gotamo is an unpractical person. I declare, O Brahman, my unpractical state. I declare the non-practice of the various kinds of sins and demerits connected with bodily misdemeanour, verbal misdemeanour, and mental misdemeanour. This is the rule, O Brahman, and by it it may well be said that the Samano Gotamo is an unpractical person; but not on the account of which you speak.\n\nThe illustrious Gotamo is an exterminator.\u2014There is a rule, O Brahman, by which it may be well said of me, that the Samano Gotamo is an exterminator. I declare, O Brahman, my extermination. I declare the extermination of the various kinds of sins and demerits connected with desire, hatred, and ignorance. This is the rule, O Brahman, and by this rule it may well be said of me, the Samano Gotamo is an exterminator; but not on the account of which you speak.\n\nThe illustrious Gotamo is a despiser.\u2014There is a rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said of me, the Samano Gotamo is a despiser. I despise, O Brahman, the arrivals at the various kinds of sins and demerits arising from evil deeds, evil words, and evil thoughts. This is the rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said of me, that the Samano Gotama is a despiser; but not on the account of which you speak.\nThe illustrious Gotama is a subjugator.\u2014There is a rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said of me, the Samano Gotamo is a subjugator. I declare, O Brahman, the subjugating Dhamma. I declare the subjugating Dhamma of the various kinds of sins and demerits connected with evil desire, hatred, and ignorance. This is the rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said of me, the Samano Gotamo is a subjugator; but not on the account of which you speak.\n\nThe illustrious Gotamo is an ascetic (1.)\u2014There is a rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said of me, the Samano Gotamo is an ascetic. I declare, O Brahman, the ascetism (literally scorching) of the course of sins and demerits. I declare, O Brahman, the scorchings of evil deeds, evil words, and evil thoughts. To any person is there the renunciation of the courses of sins and demerits, as the palmyra tree cut up by the root has no existence and no other birth? I declare that ascetism. To Tath\u00e1gato, O Brahman, are the scorchings and renunciations of sins and demerits, as the palmyra tree when cut up by the roots has no being nor future birth. This is the rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said of me, that Samano Gotamo is an ascetic; but not on the account of which you speak.\n\nThe illustrious Gotamo is excluded from birth.\u2014There is a rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said of the Samano Gotamo, that he is excluded from birth. As to any person, O Brahman, there are exclusions from another f\u0153tus, another state, and another birth, like the palmyra cut up by the roots, which has no more being nor future birth. I declare that exclusion from birth. To him (to me) there are exemptions from becoming a f\u0153tus in the womb, another state,\n\n(1.) Ascetic.\u2014Pali \u1e6dh\u0101s\u0101ya a scorcher, a burner, with reference to bodily desires, &c.\nand another birth, as the palmyra cut off at the roots has no future existence nor future birth. This is the rule, O Brahman, and by that rule it may well be said, that the Samano Gotamo is excluded from birth; but not on the account of which you speak.\n\nO Brahman, as the hen when sitting on 8, 10 or 12 eggs, having warmed them and turned them, the one from her brood who first either with his bill or claws breaking the shell comes with health out of it,\u2014what do you call him? The elder or the younger? O virtuous Gotamo, it is proper to call him the eldest; he is the eldest.\n\nIn the same manner, O Brahman, I, having split the shell of ignorance connected with the received shell of folly and existence, am alone in this world the incomparable, the true, the omniscient and illustrious Buddha. That I, O Brahman, am supreme and chief of the world. By me, O Brahman, was begun untiring effort, durable, fixed, and unerring memory, a subjugated body in which lust was conquered, and a peaceful heart having only one object (in view). That I, O Brahman, arrived and dwelt in the First Jh\u00e1na, (1,) having become exempt from desire, and a sinning nature, (with which Jh\u00e1na is connected) reason, investigation, and the pleasure of isolation. And having surmounted reason and investigation, I arrived at and dwelt in the Second Jh\u00e1na, connected with clearness of intellect, mental effulgence, the relinquishment of reason and investigation, and the joy and pleasure arising from mental tranquillity. Having subjugated joy, I arrived at and dwelt in the medium state\u2014possessed memory, fixity of mind, and bodily ease, and that which the Rahats call the delightful\n\n(1.) Jh\u00e1na.\u2014A state of knowledge. There are four Jh\u00e1nas, the nature of which both in Brahmanism and Buddhism is very similar.\u2014See Wilson, Dhay\u00e0na.\nabode of indifference and mind; and thus I arrived at and dwelt in the Third Jh\u00e1na. I (then) arrived at and dwelt in the Fourth Jh\u00e1na, connected with the extinction of former joys and sorrows, the extinction of former pleasures and pains, which has neither sorrow nor joy, (but) the purity of heart which arises from isolation.\n\nThus, when I had subdued, purified, cleansed, washed, separated from lusts, rendered soft, prepared for good action, and made my heart firm, I bent my mind to the recollection of former states (of existence). In what manner? 1 birth, 2 births, 3 births, 4 births, 5 births, 10 births, 20 births, 30 births, 40 births, 50 births, 100 births, 1,000 births, 100,000 births, various destructive kalpas, various kalpas of formation; in such and such a place there was such and such a name, such a tribe, such a colour, such a possessor of food, and endured such pleasure and pain; and so he (I) having arrived at old age, departed from that state, and was born in such and such a place, and was of such a name, such a tribe, such a class, such a proprietor, and endured such pleasure and pain. And thus having reached the end of life, departed from that state, and was born here.\n\nIn this manner I remember various prior states of existence. By me, O Brahman, in the first watch of the night was attained the first (gradation) of wisdom. Ignorance departed, and wisdom was attained; darkness fled, and light was produced. In a certain way, with a fixed memory, and the purpose of subjugating desires, and separated from lust, to me, O Brahman, came the first Great achievement, as the chick comes out of the shell; and so that I, when I had established a peaceful, pure, clear, abstract, separate from defilement, and a good-natured heart, bent my mind to the deaths and births of animals.\nThat person (I) with a divine, clear, and superhuman eye behold beings. I know beings who die, are born, are debased, excellent, of good report, of ill report, of good disposition, of ill disposition, according to the nature of their actions; that certainly these creatures, O fortunate one, who are addicted to evil actions, evil words, and evil thoughts, who are revilers of Rahats, heathens, and partakers of the actions of heathens\u2014these, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are born in the Ap\u00e1ya (1), Duggati (2), Winip\u00e1ta (3), and Niraya (4) hells; and these creatures, O fortunate one, who are practised in good deeds, good words, and good thoughts, who are not revilers of Rahats, pure religionists, and partakers of the actions of those religionists\u2014these, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are born in the good and heavenly world. So I perceive with the divine, clear, and superhuman eye, creatures, and know creatures who die, are born, are debased, excellent, of good report, of ill report, of good disposition, of bad disposition, according to the nature of their actions. By this person, me, O Brahman was attained, the Second Wijj\u00e1 (5); ignorance was dispersed, and Wijj\u00e1 produced; darkness fled, and light came. In this manner, to me, O Brahman, who was industrious, active, and dwelling apart, happened the second Exodus, as the chick bursts from its shell. That I, when I had thus established a peaceful, pure, clear, abstract, separate from defilement, and a good-natured heart, bent my mind to the wisdom of the extinction of sensual desires. I knew that this is sorrow from its very nature. I knew\n\n(1.) Ap\u00e1ya.\u2014Apa, not; aya, ease.\n(2.) Duggati.\u2014Du, bad; gati, nature or disposition.\n(3.) Winip\u00e1ta.\u2014Wi, intensive prefix; ni, ditto; pata, a falling.\n(4.) Niraya.\u2014Nir, not; aya, good fortune.\n(5.) Wijj\u00e1.\u2014An advanced state of knowledge.\nfrom its nature that this is the cause of sorrow. I knew from its nature that this is the extinction of sorrow. I knew from its nature that this is the means for the extinction of sorrow. I knew from their nature these are sensual desires. I knew from its nature this is the cause of sensual desire. I knew from its nature this is the extinction of sensual desire. I knew from its nature that this is the means of the extinction of sensual desire. To that person, me, who thus knew and saw, happened the deliverance of the heart from sensual desires, from the desire of existence, from the desire of external objects, from cleaving to ignorance, and as regards emancipation came wisdom; and I knew the Brahmachariya which is called the wasted state, how it is effected, and that afterwards it will not be so and so. O Brahman, to me, in the last watch of the night came the Third Wijj\u00e1; ignorance departed, and knowledge was produced, darkness fled, and light came. To me, O Brahman, in this manner, who was industrious, active, and dwelling in seclusion, happened the Third Exodus, as the chick bursts forth from its shell.\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, Weranja Brahman said this to Bhagaw\u00e1:\u2014The illustrious Gotamo is excellent; the illustrious Gotamo is supreme. It is refulgent, O Gotamo; it is refulgent, O Gotamo! As by any means an inverted thing may be set upright, or a secret revealed, or to one who has erred the path be shewn, or in darkness a lamp may be lit and carried, or a figure shewn to the eye of him who sees; just so, in various ways, the Dhamma is proclaimed by the illustrious Gotamo. I go to the Refuge (1) of that illustrious Gotamo, and to the Dhamma and company of Bhikkhus. May the illustrious\n\n(1.) Refuge.\u2014Sarana, from sara \u201cto go.\u201d This form is used by all Buddhists, similarly to prayer by Christians.\nGotamo receive me as a Buddhist layman; from this day forward, till life shall close, may the refuge be granted me, which I have arrived at, and may I be favoured by the illustrious Gotamo, with the great company of Bhikkhus, observing Was(1) in Weranji. The illustrious Bhagaw\u00e1 assented by being silent. Then Weranja Brahman knowing that Bhagaw\u00e1 had assented, rose from his seat, saluted Bhagaw\u00e1, and departed, having his right side presented (2).\n\nAt that time there was a famine in Weranja; men's minds were distracted, they became like skeletons, their crops failed, and it was not easy by begging to obtain a livelihood. At that time horse-dealers from the North arrived at Weranja, in the Was season, with about 500 horses, and there in the horse-sheds were some measures of gram prepared. The Bhikkhus at dawn of day having robed themselves and taken their bowl and robes, and not having received any alms, came to the horse-sheds, took some measures of gram, pounded and pounded them in a mortar, and eat them. The Venerable Anando having ground on a rock a vessel full of the gram, brought it near to Bhagaw\u00e1. Bhagaw\u00e1 ate it. Bhagaw\u00e1, hearing the sound of the mortars (and pestles)\u2014(knowing a matter Tath\u00e1gat\u00e1s enquire, knowing a matter they do not enquire; knowing the time they enquire; knowing the time they do not enquire; purposely Ta-th\u00e1gat\u00e1s enquire, not without a purpose, but for removing the cause of there not being a purpose to Tath\u00e1gat\u00e1s. There are two modes in which the wise Bhagaw\u00e1s question the Bhikkhus (saying) Shall we preach the Dhamma, or promulgate the Commandments to the disciples?)\u2014Then Bhagaw\u00e1 called the\n\n(1.) Was; lit. rain.\u2014A season of seclusion among Buddhist Priests for a period of three months.\n\n(2.) A respectful form of going out of the presence of a dignitary.\nVenerable Anando, What is this pounding noise? Then the Venerable Anando made known the matter to Bhagaw\u00e1. Very well, very well, O Anando, mankind will think that by you virtuous men victory was gained over grain, meat, and rice.\n\nThen the Venerable Great Moggal\u00e1no (1) came to the place where Bhagaw\u00e1 was, and having arrived and reverently saluted Bhagaw\u00e1, sat down on one side, and the Venerable and Great Moggal\u00e1no who was seated on one side, said this to Bhagaw\u00e1:\u2014There is now a famine, O Lord, in Weranja, people are distracted and reduced to skeletons, the crops have failed, and it is by no means easy to gain a livelihood by gleaning (begging). O Lord, underneath the surface of the Great Earth there exists (something) comparable to small drops of honey, and there being no bees, it will be good. Is it good, O Lord, may I overturn the earth? The Bhikkhus will then eat that edible crust of the earth. There are creatures, O Moggal\u00e1no, in the earth. How will you treat them? I will preserve the creatures, O Lord (by making another world), and how many creatures soever there may be in this world, I will collect and place them there, and with one hand I will overturn the earth. It is not proper, O Moggal\u00e1no; do not wish to overturn the world; the creatures may experience discomfort. Very well, O Lord, shall the whole company of Bhikkhus go to the north to ask alms? It is not proper, O Moggal\u00e1no; do not wish that all the company of Bhikkhus should go to the northern continent to collect alms.\n\nAfterwards this kind of thought and reasoning happened to the Venerable S\u00e1riputtoo who was retired and in solitude:\u2014How is it that the Brahmachariya of such Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s\n\n(1.) Moggall\u00e1no.\u2014One of the two Chief Priests of Buddha, who attended him throughout his ministrations.\ncontinued not for a long time, and how was it that the Brahma chariya of such Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s continued a long time? Afterwards the Venerable S\u00e1riputtoo at eventide coming forth from his solitude, came to the place where Bhagaw\u00e1 was, and having reverently saluted Bhagaw\u00e1, sat on one side. The Venerable Sariputto who was seated on one side, said this to Bhagaw\u00e1. Here to me, O Lord, who was in secret and solitude, came this kind of thought and investigation: Which of the Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s' Brahmachariya did not continue for a long time; and of which of the Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s did the Brahmachariya continue for a long time? Of which of the Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s, O Lord, did the Brahmachariya not continue for a long time? and of which of the Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s Brahmachariya did continue for a long time?\n\nO Sariputto, the Brahmachariya of Wipassa Bhagaw\u00e1, of Sikhi Bhagaw\u00e1, and of Wessabhu Bhagaw\u00e1 was not of long duration; and the Brahmachariya, O Sariputto, of Kakusanda Bhagaw\u00e1, of Kon\u00e1gama Bhagaw\u00e1, and of Kasappa Bhagaw\u00e1 continued for a long time.\n\nO Lord, what was the cause, and what the means by which the Brahmach\u00e1riya of Bhagaw\u00e1 Wipassa, of Bhagaw\u00e1 Sikhi, and of Bhagaw\u00e1 Wessabhu, continued only for a short time?\n\nO Sariputto, Bhagaw\u00e1 Wipassa, Bhagaw\u00e1 Sikhi, and Bhagaw\u00e1 Wessabhu became disheartened in declaring their Dhamma at length to their disciples. The Sutta (7), Geyya (8).\n\n(1.) Wipassi Buddha. The 19th Buddha of this system.\n(2.) Sikhi do. 20th do.\n(3.) Wessabhu do. 21st do.\n(4.) Kakusandha do. 22nd do.\n(5.) Kanagamo do. 23rd do.\n(6.) Kassapo do. 24th do.\n(7.) Sutta, oral declaration.\n(8.) Geyya, a kind of mixed composition of prose and poetry.\nmethodical compositions, stanzas, pleasing words, their revealed births, wonderful doctrines, and dialogues were few; instructions and discipline were not imparted to the disciples, and the P\u00e1ti Mokkha (1) was not shewn; and from the disappearance of these Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s, and from the disappearance of their contemporary disciples, their subsequent followers being of various names, various tribes, various castes, and various kinds of ascetics, their Brahmachariyas quickly became extinct. As in any way, whatsoever, O S\u00e1riputtoo, when flowers of various kinds are placed on a shelf without being strung together, the wind shakes, scatters, and strews them about. What is the cause of that? Because they are not united by a string. Just so, O S\u00e1riputtoo, from the disappearance of those Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s, and the disappearance of the disciples contemporary with those Buddhos, their subsequent followers being of various names, various tribes, various castes, and various kinds of ascetics, their Brahmachariya quickly became extinct.\n\nThese Bh\u00e1gaw\u00e1s became not weary of declaring, advising perfectly, the hearts of their disciples. O S\u00e1riputtoo, at a former time, the Blessed, the Sanctified, the True and Omniscient Wessabhu Buddha, in a certain fearful jungle, knowing intimately their hearts, exhorted 1,000 Bhikkhus:\u2014Reason thus; thus ye must not reason; thus consider; thus ye must not consider; remove this; being thus situated, remain. Then to Sariputtoo and the 1,000 Bhikkhus who had been thus exhorted and admonished by the Blessed, the Sanctified, the True and Allwise Wessabhu, came deliverance of their hearts from the desire of existence. There, O Sariputtoo, to that\n\n(1.) P\u00e1ti Mokkha:\u2014a book in the Winiya Pi\u1e6daka, containing rules on monasticism.\nfearful jungle, happened a wonder. Any person who entered that jungle, if he were not free from desire, all his hair stood on an end. This was the cause, O Sariputto, and this the means of the Brahmachariya of Bhagaw\u00e1 Wepassi, Bhagaw\u00e1 Sikhi, and of Bhagaw\u00e1 Wessabhu continuing for a short time only.\n\nWhat, O Lord, was the cause, and what the means, by which the Brahmachariya of Bhagaw\u00e1 Kakusandho, of Bhagaw\u00e1 Konagama, and of Bhagaw\u00e1 Kassapa, continued for a long time?\n\nO Sariputto, Bhagaw\u00e1 Kakusandho, Bhagaw\u00e1 Konagama, and Bhagaw\u00e1 Kassapo became not weary of explaining their Dhamma at length to their disciples. The Sutta, Geyya, methodical compositions, stanzas, pleasing words, revealed births, wonderful doctrines, and dialogues, were very extensive. Instruction and discipline were imparted to their disciples, and the P\u00e1ti Mokkha was enunciated. (Therefore) on the disappearance of those Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s and their contemporary disciples, their subsequent followers being of various names, various tribes, various castes, and various kinds of ascetics, established their Brahmachariya for a long time. As in any way, O Sariputto, a number of flowers which are strung together and placed on a board, the wind neither shakes, scatters, nor strews them about. What is the cause of that? Because they are well joined by a string. Just in the same manner, O Sariputto, on the disappearance of those Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1s and their contemporary disciples, their subsequent followers being of various names, of various tribes, various castes, and various kinds of ascetics, they established for a long time their Brahmachariya. This, O Sariputto, was the cause, and this the means, of the Brahmachariya of Bhagaw\u00e1 Kakusandho, of Bhagaw\u00e1 Konagama, and of Bhagaw\u00e1 Kassapa, continuing for a long time.\nAfterwards, Sariputto having risen from his seat, with his robe covered one shoulder, and worshipped Bhagaw\u00e1 in the place where he was, by joining his hands at his forehead, said this to Bhagaw\u00e1:\u2014O Bhagaw\u00e1, this is the time for that; this is a good time for that. May Bhagaw\u00e1 proclaim the discipline to the disciples; may he declare the P\u00e1ti Mokkha. In some way or other the Brahmachariya will continue for a long time. Wait, O Sariputto; wait, O Sariputto, Ta-th\u00e1gata knows the time. Until that time, O Sariputto, the Teacher proclaims not his discipline, nor declares the P\u00e1ti Mokkha. Until workings of lust descend to some of the priesthood, and till after, O Sariputto, the workings of lust have descended to the priesthood, the Teacher does not proclaim the discipline to his disciples, nor the P\u00e1ti Mokkha, for the destruction of the operations of those lusts. Then, O Sariputto, some of the priesthood are not subject to the workings of lust. The priesthood is not yet become experienced nor extensive. O Sariputto, when the priesthood has become experienced and extensive, then the operations of desire descend to some of the priesthood, and then the Teacher declares his discipline to the disciples, and proclaims the P\u00e1ti Mokkha for the destruction of the operations of lust. Then, O Sariputto, the operations of lust do not descend to some of the priesthood. The priesthood is not yet become great. O Sariputto, when the priesthood has arrived at a great state, then, the operations of lust descend to some of the priesthood; and then the Teacher declares the discipline to the disciples, and proclaims the P\u00e1ti Mokkha for the destruction of the operations of those lusts; then, O Sariputto, the workings of lust do not descend to some of the priesthood. The priesthood has not yet come to the state of receiving great offerings. When the priesthood has arrived at the state of receiving great offerings; then the\noperations of lust descend on some of the priesthood; and then\nthe Teacher proclaims the discipline to the disciples, and\ndeclares the P\u00e1ti Mokkha for the destruction of the operations\nof those lusts; and then, O Sariputto, the workings of lust do\nnot descend on some of the priesthood. The priesthood has\nnot yet arrived at the great truths (of Buddha's doctrine).\nWhen the priesthood has arrived at the great truths, then the\noperations of lust descend on some of the priesthood, and then\nthe Teacher proclaims the discipline to the disciples, and\ndeclares the P\u00e1ti Mokkha for the extinction of the operations\nof those lusts. O Sariputto, the company of Bhikkhus being\nfaultless, separate from evil, reformed, pure, settled in merit,\namong these 500 great Bhikkhus the least of them is arrived\nat Sowan path, delivered from extinction, having Nirwana as\na certainty; also the future paths.\n\nAfterwards Bhagaw\u00e1 said to the venerable Anando, That\nwhich I intend to declare will henceforth become a custom.\nIf any one has been invited to pass the Was season, he must\nnot depart without informing (him who invited him). O\nAnando, let us go and inform Weranja Brahman. Just so,\nO Lord, answered Anando to Bhagaw\u00e1. Then Bhagaw\u00e1\nhaving robed himself, and taken his bowl and robes, with\nAnando as his attendant, came to the place where Weranja\nBrahman's house was, and having arrived, sat on the prepared\nseat.\n\nThen Weranja Brahman came to the place where Bhaga-\nw\u00e1 was, and having arrived and reverently saluted Bhagaw\u00e1,\nsat on one side. Then Bhagaw\u00e1 said this to Weranja Brah-\nman who was seated on one side: O Brahman, we have com-\npleted the Was, to which you have invited us. We inform\nthee that we desire to depart to journey in inhabited districts.\nTruly, O virtuous Gotamo, you were invited by me for the\nWas season; but I have not given anything which may be proper to bestow. I did not give, not because I had it not, nor because I did not wish to give. When can this be done by the laity with their many duties and cares? May the illustrious Gotamo consent to come with the company of Bhikkhus to partake of food to-morrow? Bhagaw\u00e1 by silence gave consent. Afterwards Bhagaw\u00e1 having declared a doctrinal speech to Weranja Brahman, implanted it in his heart, produced a desire (towards it), and made him satisfied (with it), arose from his seat, and departed.\n\nAfterwards, when the night had gone, Weranja Brahman having provided proper and suitable food, made known the time to Bhagaw\u00e1 (saying), O Lord, virtuous Gotamo, the meal is ready. Then Bhagaw\u00e1, in the morning, having robed himself and taken his bowl, and robes, came to the place where Weranja Brahman's dwelling was, and having arrived, sat on the seat provided for him, with the company of the Bhikkhus. Then Weranja Brahman having provided with his own hands food for the Bhikkhus and their chief, Buddha, which food was delicious, fit, and suitable to be eaten,\u2014when Bhagaw\u00e1 had eaten, and the bowl was put aside, Weranja clothed Bhagaw\u00e1 with three robes, and each of the Bhikkhus with a pair of cloths. Afterwards Bhagaw\u00e1 having declared a doctrinal speech to Weranja Brahman, implanted it in his heart, produced a desire (towards it), and made him satisfied (with it), arose from his seat, and departed. Afterwards Bhagaw\u00e1 having resided in Weranja as long as he wished, without going to Soreyya, Samkassam, or Kantakujja, came to the place where the river P\u00e1yaga was, and having arrived and crossed over, came to Benares, and having dwelt as long as he wished there, came to Wesali city, and according to custom, dwelt there, in the Rock Hall in the great jungle near Wesali.\n\nThe Weranja Bana portion is finished.\nNo. II. Par\u00e1jika Book.\n\nThere was at that time a village not far from Wesali, called Kalanda village. A chetty, Sudinno, the son of Kalanda lived in it. At that time, Sudinno of Kalanda, from some cause or other, went to Wesali with several of his companions. On that occasion Bhagaw\u00e1 was seated in the midst of many of his attendants preaching the Dhamma. When Sudinno of Kalando had seen Bhagaw\u00e1 seated in the midst of his attendants, and preaching the Dhamma to him, it thus happened (he thought thus)\u2014It will be good if I also hear this Dhamma. Then Sudinno came where the crowd was, and sat down on one side, and to Sudinno, who was seated on one side, came this thought:\u2014By some means or other I have heard the Dhamma proclaimed by Bhagaw\u00e1; (but) it is not easy to practise the truly complete, holy, and pure, Brahmachariya, by those who are householders, and dwell in the lay state. It is good therefore, if I having shaven my head and beard, assumed the yellow robes, and renounced the lay state, become a mendicant cleric. Then that company, when it was well instructed, had well taken to heart, was interested, and having appreciated the Dhamma, rose from their seats, reverently saluted Bhagaw\u00e1, and departed keeping their right side towards (Buddha.)\n\nThen Sudinno, not long after the company had arisen, went to the place where Bhagaw\u00e1 was, and having arrived, and reverently saluted Bhagaw\u00e1, sat on one side. Sudinno, who was seated on one side, said this to Bhagaw\u00e1:\u2014By\n\n(1.) Sudinno is always called the son of Kalando, throughout the narrative, but I have omitted it.\nsome means or other, O lord, I have heard the Dhamma declared by Bhagaw\u00e1, (but) it is not easy to practise the truly complete, holy, and spotless Brahmachariya, by those who are householders and dwell in the lay state; it is good, therefore, if I, having shaven my head and beard, assumed the yellow robes, and renounced the lay state, become a mendicant cleric. May Bhagaw\u00e1 ordain me! Hast thou, S\u00fadinno, obtained the consent of thy mother and father, to renounce the lay state and become a mendicant cleric? I have not, O Lord, obtained the consent of my mother and father to renounce the lay state and become a mendicant cleric. O Sudinno, Tath\u00e1gato does not ordain him who has not obtained the consent of his mother and father. He said, I, O Lord, will do so, since my mother and father may consent to my renouncing the world and becoming a mendicant cleric.\n\nThen Sudinno, having finished whatever he had to do in Wes\u00e1li, went to Kalanda village, where his mother and father were, and having arrived there, said this to his mother and father:\u2014O mother, O father, by some means or other, I have heard the Dhamma preached by Bhagaw\u00e1, (but) it is not easy to practise the truly complete, holy, and spotless Brahmachariya, by those who are householders, and dwell in the lay state. I wish to receive tonsure, assume the yellow robes, and become a mendicant cleric, separate from the laity. Grant permission to become a mendicant cleric, separate from the laity. When he had thus spoken, the mother and father of Sudinno said to Sudinno, O thou child, Sudinno, who art dear (to us); thou hast pleasure, and hast been tenderly nourished, thou hast not experienced any sorrow. Even by death we cannot desire your separation. What! shall we then consent, while you are alive, that you should separate from the laity, and become a mendicant cleric?\nAnd so the second time the mother and father of Sudinno said to Sudinno, Thou art, O child Sudinno, our only son, well-beloved, surrounded by pleasures, and tenderly nourished. Thou art unacquainted with grief. And the third time, Sudinno said to his mother and father:\u2014O mother, O father, by some means or other, I have heard the Dhamma proclaimed by Bhagaw\u00e1, (but) it is not easy to practise the holy, complete, holy, and spotless Brahmachariya, by those who are householders and dwell in the lay state. I wish (therefore) having shaven my head and beard, assumed the yellow robe, and separated from the laity, to become a mendicant cleric. Give permission that I may separate from the world, and become a mendicant cleric. And the third time the mother and father of Sudinno said this to Sudinno:\u2014Thou art, O child, our only son, well-beloved, surrounded by pleasures, tenderly nourished, and unacquainted with any grief. Even by death we cannot desire to be separated from you. What then! shall we consent, while you are still living, that you should separate from the laity, and become a mendicant cleric.\n\nThen Sudinno thought:\u2014My mother and father do not consent that I should become a mendicant cleric, separate from the laity: and fell down there on the bareground (saying) Either here will I die, or become a mendicant cleric. Then Sudinno did not partake of one meal, 2 meals, 3 meals, 4 meals, 5 meals, 6 meals and 7 meals. Then the mother and father of Sudinno, said this to Sudinno:\u2014Thou art, O child, our only son, well-beloved, surrounded by pleasures, tenderly nourished and unacquainted with any grief; even by death we cannot desire separation from you. What then, shall we consent, while you are still alive, that you should separate from the laity, and become a mendicant cleric. Get up, O child, Sudinno, eat and drink, and surrounded by your companions\neating, drinking, with your retinue enjoying yourself, and performing merits, become cheerful. We do not consent to your separation from the world, and that you should become a mendicant cleric. When that was said, Sudinno was silent; and the second time, &c. And the third time also, the mother and father of Sudinno said this to Sudinno:\u2014Thou art, O child Sudinno, our only son, well-beloved, surrounded with pleasures, tenderly nourished, and unacquainted with any grief. Even by death we cannot desire separation from thee. What then! shall we consent, while you are still alive, that you should separate from the lay state, and become a mendicant cleric? Get up, O child Sudinno, eat and drink, and surrounded by your companions, eating, drinking, with your retinue enjoying yourself, and performing merits, become cheerful. We do not consent to your separation from the world, that you should become a mendicant cleric. And the third time Sudinno, the son of Kalsando, was silent.\n\nThen the companions of Sudinno went to the place where Sudinno was, and having arrived, said this to Sudinno:\u2014Thou art, O friend Sudinno, the beloved and only son of thy mother and father, endeared, surrounded with pleasures, tenderly nourished, and established in ease. O friend Sudinno, thou hast not known any grief; and by death even, your mother and father do not desire your separation. What then! will they consent, while you are alive, that you should separate from the world, that you may become a mendicant cleric?\n\nGet up, O friend Sudinno, eat and drink, and surrounded by your companions, &c.\u2014Vide supra.\n\nWhen they had thus said, Sudinno was silent; and the second time, &c.; and the third time, &c., &c.\n\nAnd the third time also Sudinno was silent. Then the companions of Sudinno went to the place where the mother\nand father of Sudinno were, and said this to the mother and father of Sudinno:\u2014O mother, O father, that Sudinno, fallen on the bare earth, says, Either here I will die, or receive ordination. If ye do not give leave to Sudinno to separate from the world, and become a mendicant cleric, he will die there; (but) if you give permission to Sudinno to separate from the world, and become a mendicant cleric, you will see him again; and if he does not delight in separation from the world, and the state of a mendicant cleric, another disposition will come to him, and he will return again to this place. Give permission to Sudinno to become a mendicant cleric, separate from the laity.\u2014We consent that our child, Sudinno, shall become a mendicant cleric, separate from the laity.\n\nThen the companions of Sudinno went to the place where Sudinno was, and having arrived, said this to Sudinno:\u2014Get up, O friend Sudinno; thou art permitted by thy mother and father to forsake the world, and become a mendicant cleric. Then Sudinno said:\u2014I am permitted by my mother and father to separate from the world and become a mendicant cleric; and being glad, well pleased, joyful, and rubbing his body with his hands, he rose up.\n\nAfterwards, Sudinno having for several days strengthened himself, went to the place where Bhagaw\u00e1 was, and having arrived and saluted Bhagaw\u00e1, sat down on one side. Sudinno who was seated on one side said this to Bhagaw\u00e1:\u2014I am permitted, O lord, by my mother and father to separate from the world, and become a medicant cleric. May Bhagaw\u00e1 ordain me. Sudinno received ordination (S\u00e1manera) (1) and (2) Upsam-\n\n(1.) S\u00e1manera.\u2014A clerical novice, whose age must be at least eight years to receive ordination.\n\n(2.) Upasampad\u00e1.\u2014A superior priest, not under twenty years of age.\npad\u00e1, near Bhagaw\u00e1; and the venerable Sudinno having subjugated his desires, became a dweller in the wilderness, a mendicant, a wearer of castaway garments, and a methodical beggar (1) (i.e., one who asks from every house) and resided near a certain Wajji village.\n\nAfterwards there was a famine in Wajji, men's minds were distracted, they were reduced to skeletons and everything sown become blasted. It was not easy, therefore, to gain a living by gleaning (alms-asking). Then this thought came to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014In this Wajji is a famine, men's minds are distracted, they are reduced to skeletons, and the crops are blasted. It is not easy, therefore, to get a living by gleaning, (but) I have many relatives in Wes\u00e1li who are rich, very wealthy, great proprietors, and have more than sufficient gold and silver, superabundant means and enormous quantities of grain, &c. It is good if I reside near my relatives. My relatives on my account will bestow gifts and perform merits; Bhikkhus will be benefited, and I shall not become weary in begging. Then the venerable Sudinno having rolled up his mat and taken his alms-bowl, and robes, departed for Wes\u00e1li and dwelt there after the former (2) custom. Then the venerable Sudinno dwelt in the great Wes\u00e1li jungle near the great Rock hall. The relatives of the venerable Sudinno heard that Sudinno had arrived at Wes\u00e1li, and they brought and presented about 60 vessels of rice to the venerable Sudinno. Then the venerable Sudinno having divided the 60 vessels of cooked food among the Bhikkhus, dressed in the early morning, and taking his bowl and robes, entered the village of Kalando.\n\n(1.) A command given by Bhagaw\u00e1 to his clerics, that they should omit no house when alms-asking.\n(2.) Appointed.\nAs he was methodically collecting alms in Kalando village, he came where his father's house was, at a time when a female servant of the relatives of the venerable Sudinno was thinking about throwing away some stale rice, the remains of the previous evening meal. Then the venerable Sudinno said to the servant-maid of his relatives:\u2014If you have a throwing away Dhamma (purpose) O sister, put it into my bowl. The servant-girl of the venerable Sudinno's relatives put the stale rice which was left from the previous evening meal into the bowl, and recognized the marks of his hands, feet, and voice. Then the maid-servant of the relatives of the venerable Sudinno went to the place where the mother of the venerable Sudinno was, and having arrived, said this to the mother of the venerable Sudinno:\u2014What do you think! Our master Sudinno has come.\u2014Do you speak the truth, you wench? If so, I will emancipate you.\n\nAfterward the venerable Sudinno ate the stale rice in a retired place. The father of the venerable Sudinno coming home from his work, saw the venerable Sudinno eating the stale rice in a retired place, went to the place where the venerable Sudinno was, and having arrived, said this to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014Truly, O child Sudinno, will you eat stale rice? Truly, O child Sudinno, it is proper to go to your own house.\u2014I went to your house, and there I received this stale rice. Then the father of the venerable Sudinno having taken hold of the arm of the venerable Sudinno, said this to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014Come, O child Sudinno, we will go to the house. Then the venerable Sudinno went to the place where the house was, and having arrived, sat on the seat spread out for him. The father of the venerable Sudinno said to the venerable Sudinno,\u2014Eat, O child Sudinno. Not so, O layman, I have eaten my food for to-day.\u2014Consent, O child\nSudinno to eat rice to-morrow! The venerable Sudinno by silence assented. Then the venerable Sudinno having risen from his seat departed.\n\nThen the mother of the venerable Sudinno, after that night, having smeared the floor with new cowdung and caused to be made two heaps for him, one of gold coins, and the other of gold,\u2014those two offerings were so great that a man on this side sees not a man on that; et vice versa,\u2014she covered over those heaps with mats, prepared a seat in the middle, suitably surrounded (ornamented) them, and called the former wife of the venerable Sudinno. Now, O woman, put on those ornaments, and beautify yourself in a manner most pleasing to Sudinno.\u2014Just so, O lady; answered the former wife of the venerable Sudinno to the mother of the venerable Sudinno.\n\nThe venerable Sudinno at dawn having clothed himself and taken his bowl and robes, went to the place where his father's dwelling was, and having arrived, sat on the prepared seat. Then the venerable Sudinno's father came where the venerable Sudinno was, and having uncovered the heaps, said this to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014O child Sudinno, these are thy mother's property, the woman's dowry, that which is proper to be given to the female. The father's property is separate\u2014our ancestors' too is separate; O son Sudinno, having disrobed yourself, you may receive this property, and perform meritorious actions. O father, I cannot attempt it, I am unable. I having a desire to the Brahmachariyat, will practise it. So the second time, &c., &c.; and the third time also the father of the venerable Sudinno said to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014This is your mother's property, which was given as her dowry at marriage. The father's property is separate, and the grandfather's too. Take these things. O child Sudinno, possess these valuables, and perform merits, having come to the\nlay state. Make up your mind, O Sudinno, to possess this property and perform merits.\n\nLet us say this, O layman, if you will not become angry.\u2014Say, O child Sudinno, said the father. Well then, O layman, get a large sack, fill it with the gold coins and the gold, put it into a cart, and throw it into the current in the middle of the river. If it be asked why. On account of these things may arise either fear, trembling, horripilation or trouble in keeping it. Then neither of these will happen to thee. When he had thus spoken, the venerable Sudinno's father became displeased, and said:\u2014O child Sudinno, how can you speak thus?\n\nThen the father of the venerable Sudinno called the former wife of the venerable Sudinno and said:\u2014Because, O woman, you are dear and pleasing, it may be my son Sudinno will obey your word; if so, it will be well. Then the former wife of the venerable Sudinno embracing his feet, said this to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014With what kind of expectation, O dear lord, do you practise the Brahmachariya? (1)\u2014I do not, O sister, live as a celibic for the purpose of receiving a divine female, (said Sudinno.)\n\nThen the former wife of the venerable Sudinno said:\u2014From this day do you intend to call me sister; and fainted and fell on the floor.\n\nThen Sudinno said to his father:\u2014O layman, give me the food which is proper to be given, but don't bother me.\n\nEat, O child Sudinno. Then the mother and father of the venerable Sudinno with their own hands provided him\n\n(1.) It appears that in those days men having become dissatisfied with their wives, became ascetics in order to accumulate merits, on account of which they would be able to marry a most beautiful goddess after death. Hence this question of the wife.\nwith, and persuaded him to partake of excellent food, until he was satisfied. Then the mother of the venerable Sudinno, when she had provided him with excellent food, and when his bowl was put aside, said this to him:\u2014O child Sudinno, our family is rich, has large possessions, much food, much gold, and silver, much wealth and much grain. Receive all this, O Sudinno; to possess these things, and having come to the lay state, perform merits. Come, O child Sudinno, possess these things, and perform merits.\u2014O mother, I will not attempt it; I am not able; (for) with great desire I practise the Brahmachariya. And the second time, &c. And the third time also the mother of the venerable Sudinno said to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014Now there is, O child Sudinno, a rich family, large possessions, much food, much gold and silver, much wealth and much grain. Therefore, O child Sudinno, give seed; do not allow this, that the Lichchhawi (1) should carry off our heirless wealth.\n\nI can do that, O mother, he said. Where do you dwell, O child Sudinno? In the great jungle, O mother, he said. Then the venerable Sudinno having risen from his seat, departed; and the mother of the venerable Sudinno called the former wife of the venerable Sudinno: Now, O woman, whenever you are in your courses, and the menses come, tell me. Yes, O lady, said the wife of the venerable Sudinno to the mother of the venerable Sudinno. Then the wife of the venerable Sudinno, after no long period, was in her courses, and the menses came; and then she said to the mother of the venerable Sudinno, O lady, I am in my courses, the menses have come. Therefore, O daughter, bedizen yourself with the same ornaments by which you formerly pleased my son\n\n(1.) Lichchhawi, probably Rajputs.\nSudinno, and gained his affection.\u2014Just so, O lady; answered the former wife of the venerable Sudinno to the mother of the venerable Sudinno. Then the mother of the venerable Sudinno, taking the former wife of the venerable Sudinno, came to the jungle where the venerable Sudinno was, and having come, said this to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014Now, O child Sudinno; now O child Sudinno; our family is rich, has large possessions, much food, much gold and silver, much wealth, and much grain. Receive all this, O Sudinno, and to possess these things, come to the lay state, and to perform merits; come, O child Sudinno, possess these things, and perform merits.\n\nO mother, I will not attempt it; I am unable to do it; with great desire I practise the Br\u0101hmachariya. And the second time, and the third time also the mother of the venerable Sudinno said this to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014Now, O child Sudinno, our family is wealthy, has large possessions, much food, much gold and silver, much wealth and much grain. Receive all this, O child Sudinno, and give seed. Do not allow this, that the Lichchhawi should carry off our heirless wealth. I can do that, he said;\u2014and having taken hold of the arm of his former wife, and gone to the great jungle, cohabited (1) thrice with his former wife; the discipline at that time having not been declared, and he not knowing that it was wrong. From that time she conceived. (Then) earthly deities caused this sound to be heard:\u2014Certainly the company of the Bhikkhus is faultless, and free from evil, (but) by Sudinno a fault has been committed, and evil begotten. The gods of the Ch\u0101tu Mah\u0101 R\u0101jika worlds having heard the sound of the earthly deities, caused that sound to be heard, &c. The T\u0101vatimsa\n\n(1.) Did \"Methuna Dhamma,\" the name of the first P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101.\nThe Y\u00e1ma gods, &c. The Tusit\u00e1 gods, &c. The Nimm\u00e1na rati gods, &c. The Paranimmita Wasawatti gods, &c. And the Brahmak\u00e1yik\u00e1 gods caused this report to be heard:\u2014Certainly the company of the Bhikkhus is faultless, and free from evil, (but) by Sudinno a fault has been committed, and sin begotten. At the same moment, and at that very instant, the sound ascended to the Brahma worlds.\n\nAfterwards the former wife of the venerable Sudinno gave birth to a son who had arrived at maturity in her womb. Then the companions of the venerable Sudinno gave the name Bija (seedling) to his son; to the former wife of the venerable Sudinno, Bija M\u00e1t\u00e1 (the mother of the seedling); and to the venerable Sudinno, Bija P\u00edt\u00e1 (the father of the seedling). Subsequently, both (the mother and the son) separated from the world, became mendicant religionists, and attained the state of Rahatship. Then to the venerable Sudinno came perplexity, and he repented, saying:\u2014Certainly, I have sustained losses; certainly it is not profitable to me; certainly it is a bad matter; and certainly there is no gain. (Although) I have become a Bhikkhu of such a perfectly enunciated course of discipline, I shall not be able, to the end of life, to practise the perfect and holy Bramachariya. In consequence of that perplexity and sorrow, he became thin, ill-favoured, disfigured, sallow, indifferent, morose, and sorrowful.\n\nThen the fellow Bhikkhus of the venerable Sudinno said to the venerable Sudinno:\u2014Formerly, O friend Sudinno, thou wast of a fair colour, of a captivating appearance, of a pleasing countenance, and a good complexion; but now thou art emaciated, ill-favoured, sallow, bent, with veins prominent, unsatisfied, morose, and sorrowful. What! do you not practise, O Sudinno, the Bramachariya, free from desire?\n\nI have practised the Bramachariya, but not without lust.\nBy me a sinful act has been committed, cohabitation with my former wife. I am perplexed on account of it, and much grieved. Certainly I have sustained losses; certainly it is not profitable to me; certainly it is a bad matter; and certainly there is no gain. And although I have become a Bhikkhu of the well-enunciated course of discipline, I shall not be able, to the end of life, to complete the perfect and pure Brahmachariya.\u2014O friend Sudinno, you may well be perplexed and sorrowful. You having become a Bhikkhu of the well-enunciated course of discipline, will not be able, to the end of your life, to fulfil the perfect and pure Brahmachariya. O friend, has not the Dhamma, for the abandonment of lust, been declared by Bhagaw\u00e1 in various ways? This is not on the behalf of lust. The Dhamma for separation from lust, not for the fulfilling of lust; the Dhamma for the extinction of lust, not for the operation of lust. Now then, O friend, when Bhagaw\u00e1 has in various ways proclaimed the Dhamma for the abandonment of lust, you are meditating on lust; when the Dhamma for separation from lust has been declared, you are thinking of fulfilling lust, when the Dhamma for the extinction of lust has been declared, you are thinking on the operation of lust. O friend, has not the Dhamma by Bhagaw\u00e1 for the abandonment of lust been declared in various ways\u2014for the subjugation of pride, for the suppression of the thirst (of lust), for the destruction of being, for the extermination of desire, for the refraining from lust, for extinction, and for Niwan? O friend, has it not been declared by Bhagaw\u00e1 in various ways, abandonment of lust, the knowledge of the characteristics of lust, the suppression of the thirst of lust, the excision of lustful thoughts, and the quenching of the burnings of lust?\n\nThis, O friend, is neither for the satisfaction of those who are now dissatisfied, nor for the further satisfaction of those\nwho are now well disposed. Again, O friend, it is for the further dissatisfaction of those who are still dissatisfied, and for causing a new state to those who are now well disposed. Again, O friend, if it be for the dissatisfaction of those who are still dissatisfied, some of those who are now well disposed, will become of another mind.\n\nThen those Bhikkhus in various ways scoffed at the venerable Sudinno, and made known the fact to Bhagaw\u00e1.\n\nThen Bhagaw\u00e1, for that cause, and that subject, caused the company of Bhikkhus to be assembled, and enquired of the venerable Sudinno:\u2014Is it true, Sudinno, that you have cohabited with your former wife? It is true, O Bhagaw\u00e1. Buddho Bhagaw\u00e1 censured him and said:\u2014O wicked, empty, cross-grained, hideous, irreligious, unsanctified, and worthless man! O vain man, after being initiated in the well-enunciated course of discipline, how now will you be able to practise the perfect and pure Brahmachariya? Has not the Dhamma by me for the abandonment of lust, &c., &c.\u2014Vide supra.\n\nIt were good for thee, O vain man, thou shouldst place thy private member in a most poisonous serpent\u2019s mouth; but it is not so, cohabiting with a woman. It were good for thee if thou shouldst place thy private member in the black serpent\u2019s mouth, &c., &c.; in a heap of burning charcoal, &c., &c. What is the reason? From either of those causes, O vain man, you may possibly neither die, nor on the dissolution of the body, by that cause, be born in either of the Ap\u00e1ya, Duggata, Winip\u00e1ta and Niraya hells.\n\nFrom this cause, O vain man, after the dissolution of the body, and death, you may be (will be) born in Ap\u00e1ya, Duggata, Winip\u00e1ta or Niraya hells.\n\nFrom that cause, O vain man, you will arrive at a sinful nature, an adulterous state, a degraded condition, lecherous\nhabits, unclean practices (lit. such as require ablutions), secret actions, and cohabitation. O vain man, thou hast been the originator of many sins. O vain man, this is neither for the satisfaction of those who are now dissatisfied, nor for the further satisfaction of those who are well disposed. Then, O vain man, if it be for the dissatisfaction of those who are ill-disposed, some of those who are now satisfied will become of another opinion. Then Bhagaw\u00e1 in various ways censured the venerable Sudinno, and having declared the disadvantages of the slothful man with regard to the difficulties of obtaining a livelihood, of satisfying his innumerable desires, and of quelling his discontent, declared in various ways the privileges of the man of few desires, of the satisfied man, of him who regulates his passions, of him who subdues his longings, of him who has a calm heart, of him who has but few cares, and of him whose energies are awakened; and having declared to the Bhikkhus a Dhamma discourse concerning duties and obligations, he said this to the Bhikkhus:\u2014Now, O Bhikkhus, I will declare the precepts to the Bhikkhus, for ten purposes, viz., for the good of the assembly, for its ease, for the putting to shame sinful-minded persons, for the comfort of expert Bhikkhus, for the regulation of the desires concerning rewards in this life, for the extinction of desires for rewards in a future state, for the satisfaction of those who are ill-disposed, for the further satisfaction of those who are well inclined, for the advantages of those who are established in the true Dhamma, and for discipline. Therefore, O Bhikkhus, receive this precept:\u2014If any Bhikkhu is guilty of cohabitation, he incurs a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 fault, and becomes excommunicate.\n\nSo this precept by Bhagaw\u00e1 has been promulgated to the Bhikkhus.\n\n[The conclusion of the Sudinno Bh\u00e1na.]\nThe next instance given is one of beastiality, committed by a Bhikkhu in Wes\u00e1li, with a monkey. Many Bhikkhus were witnesses of his crime, and when they charged him with it, he endeavoured to exonerate himself by declaring that Buddha had hitherto prohibited only cohabitation with a woman. Bhuddha, as in in the former case, severely reprimanded him, and declared that if any Bhikkhu cohabits with any kind of beast, from the least to the greatest, he is guilty of a P\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 fault, and becomes excommunicate.\n\nVery many Wajji Puttaka Bhikkhus in Wes\u00e1li having indulged themselves in luxurious eating, drinking and bathing, neglected their meditations, and through ignorance of their imbecility with regard to the observation of the precepts were guilty of Methuna Dhamma. Subsequently they, on account of affection to their kinsman and continued desire, went to the venerable Anando, and said thus to him:\u2014O lord Anando, we have not despised, we have not despised the Dhamma, we have not despised the Priesthood, we have not despised self, and O lord Anando, we have not despised others; (but) we are very unfortunate, and although we have a little merit from having been initiated in this declared course of discipline, yet we shall not be able, till the end of life, to complete the perfect and pure Brahmachariya. Now, O lord Anando, may we receive the cleric state, and the order of Upasampad\u00e1, in the presence of Bhagaw\u00e1; and may we be permitted to pass the first and last watches of the night in contemplation of the revelation of the meritorious Dhamma, and of the orthodox and wise Dhamma. It is good, O lord Anando, declare this to Bhagaw\u00e1.\u2014Just so; the venerable Anando answered to the Wes\u00e1li Wajji Puttaka, and went to the place where Bhagaw\u00e1 was, and having arrived, made known the matter to Bhagaw\u00e1.\u2014It is difficult, O Anando: Tath\u00e1gat\u00f3 has not the means either\nas regards the Wajji people or the Wajji Puttak\u00e0, of abrogating\nthe promulgation of the P\u00e0r\u00e1jik\u00e0 discipline as regards the\nclerical body. Then Bhagaw\u00e0, for that cause and reason,\nhaving delivered a Dhamma discourse, called the Bhikkhus\nand said:\u2014O Bhikkhus! if any Bhikkhu, through ignorance of\nhis imbecility with regard to the observance of the precepts,\nis guilty of Methuna Dhamma, when he has come (for the\npurpose of being ordained) is not worthy of being admitted to\nthe Upasampad\u00e1 order. Any one knowing his imbecility with\nregard to the observance of the precepts, if he is guilty of\nMethuna Dhamma, he is fit to be made Upasampad\u00e1, when he\nhas come for it. And so, O Bhikkhus, receive this precept:\u2014\nIf any Bhikkhu, through ignorance of his imbecility with\nregard to the observance of the precepts, is guilty of Methuna\nDhamma with any beast, from the least to the greatest, he\nincurs a P\u00e0r\u00e1jik\u00e0 fault, and becomes excommunicate.\n\nThe term any one is as follows:\u2014A person of whatsoever\ndegree, of whatsoever race, of whatsoever name, of whatsoever\ntribe, of whatsoever attainments, of whatsoever conduct, of\nwhatsoever ability, whether an elderly man, or a youth, or a\nmiddle aged man;\u2014such an one is called any one.\nJOURNAL\n\nOF THE\n\nCEYLON BRANCH\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\n1867\u201470.\n\nPART II.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nOffice Bearers ........................................... v.\nRules of the Society .................................... vii.\nDo.
