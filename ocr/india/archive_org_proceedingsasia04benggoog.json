Woodburn, Esq., C. S.\nB\u00e1bu Gerindranath Dutt.\nH. K. W. Arnold, Esq., (Re-elected.)\nH. N. Thompson, Esq.\n\nThe following gentleman is a candidate for election at the next meeting:\n\nG. O. Arthur, Esq., C. S., proposed by E. J. Kitts, Esq., seconded by C. Little, Esq.\nThe President announced that the Council had elected Mr. C. R. Wilson to officiate as Philological Secretary and member of Council in the place of Dr. Hoernle, while he was engaged with the publication of the Bower Manuscript. Dr. Hoernle retains the numismatic work.\n\nThe following paper was read:\u2014\n\nAn account of an old inscription.\u2014By Monshi Debiparsad of Jodhpore. Communicated by The Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper recorded the discovery of an old Sanskrit inscription in the village of Bijapur in Marwar.\n\nThe inscription is engraved on a piece of black stone $2\\frac{1}{4}$ ft. in length and $1\\frac{1}{4}$ ft. in breadth. With the exception of a few places, where the letters have been obliterated, the writing is quite legible and the meaning clear.\n\nThe stone is said to have been taken from the door of a Jaina temple which stands alone in the jungle, two or three miles from the village of Bijapur, on the site of the old city of Hasti Ku\u1e63\u1e6di now called Hatundi.\n\nThe city lay on the borders of Mewar and Marwar, at the foot of the Aravali hills. Remains of its walls may still be seen. They are thick enough to allow a cart to be driven along the top of them.\n\nIt appears from the inscription that the city of Hasti Ku\u1e63\u1e6di was till the eleventh century of the Samvat the capital of a branch of the Rashtrakuta family, who reigned there in great splendour.\n\nAccording to Monshi Debiparsad, the inscription mentions the following kings:\u2014\n\n1. R\u0101ja Harivarman.\n2. Vidagdha R\u0101ja (son of Harivarman), a mighty king, who in samvat 978 erected a great Jaina temple, and levied taxes in its behalf on his subjects and foreign traders.\n3. Dhavala R\u0101ja (son of Vidagdha R\u0101ja), who in samvat 996 doubled these taxes, and who was ruling Rajputana with increased authority in samvat 1003, when the temple was restored by a leading Jaina community.\n\nThe inscription also mentions four other kings, who were tributaries of Dhavala R\u0101ja; viz:\u2014\n\n4. \u015ar\u012b Mu\u1e47\u1e0da, the conqueror of Mewar.\n5. R\u0101ja Dharanivardha, then a refugee at the court of Dhavala R\u0101ja.\n6. M\u016bla R\u0101ja, the conqueror of R\u0101ja Dharanivardha.\n7. \u015ar\u012b Durlabha R\u0101ja, who was reigning in great pomp and glory\nMonshi Debiparsad considers that M\u00fala R\u00e1ja and Durlabha R\u00e1ja are kings of Gujar\u00e1t, of the Solankhi family. He identifies them with the M\u00fala R\u00e1ja and his grandson Durlabha R\u00e1ja whose history is given in the Dvai\u015bhar\u00e1ya.\n\nHe also says that Dhara\u1e47ivar\u00e1ha was a great r\u00e1ja of M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, who divided his kingdom amongst his nine brothers, and that this accounts for his weakness.\n\nLastly Monshi Debiparsad believes that Mu\u00f1ja R\u00e1ja is the same who was uncle to R\u00e1ja Bhoja of Dh\u00e1r, and is the V\u00e1kpati R\u00e1ja of whom one inscription dated samvat 1031 has been found.\n\n---\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in December last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

The election of one member was cancelled by request as he was contemplating an early return to Europe. The total number of members at the close of 1891 was thus: 295 against 303 at the end of the preceding year; of these 101 were Resident, 134 Non-Resident, 10 Foreign, 21 Life, 27 absent from India, and 2 special Non-Subscribing Members as will be seen from the following table which also shows the fluctuations in the number of Ordinary Members during the past six years.\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying |\n|------|--------|------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total | Grand Total |\n| 1886 | ...     | 98         | 142     | 18    | 259   | 16     | 48       | 2       | 66       | 819     |\n| 1887 | ...     | 98         | 187     | 15    | 250   | 17     | 44       | 2       | 63       | 313     |\n| 1888 | ...     | 98         | 198     | 15    | 240   | 20     | 34       | 2       | 66       | 305     |\n| 1889 | ...     | 108        | 185     | 13    | 256   | 23     | 27       | 2       | 51       | 307     |\n| 1890 | ...     | 105        | 140     | 10    | 255   | 21     | 25       | 2       | 48       | 303     |\n| 1891 | ...     | 101        | 134     | 10    | 245   | 21     | 27       | 2       | 50       | 295     |\n\nThe six Ordinary Members the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were Dr. A Barclay, Mr. C. W. Baumgarten, Mr. John Boxwell, Dr. Ottakar Fiestmantila, R\u00e1ja Rajendral\u00e1lia Mitra and Lt.-Col. Sir O. B. St. John.\n\nIntimation of one death amongst the corresponding members was received, viz., Rev. H. Baker of E. Malabar. The number now stands at 6.\n\nThe lists of Special Honorary Members, Honorary Members, and Associate Members continue unaltered from last year, there having been no casualties; their numbers standing at 5, 24, and 8 respectively.\n\nNo members compounded for their subscription during the year.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nNo presentations were made over to the Indian Museum.\n\nThe Indian Museum returned to the Society the gilt-seated figure of the Dharma R\u00e1ja of Bhootan which was transferred to them with the other collections of the Society's Museum.\n\nThere was only one change amongst the Trustees, caused by the\nresignation of Mr. H. Beveridge in consequence of leaving India, and\nthe Hon. Sir A. W. Croft was appointed to fill the vacant place.\n\nThe other Trustees on behalf of the Society were:\u2014\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoornle.\nA. Pedler, Esq.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nC. Little, Esq.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1 in the\nAppendix under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society, and of\nthe different funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1891 was taken at the following figures:\u2014\nReceipts Rs. 15,570\u2014Expenditure Rs. 14,323.\n\nThe actual results were found to be:\u2014Receipts 16,007\u20130\u20133. Ex-\npenditure Rs. 12,975\u201313\u201310.\n\nThe Receipts thus show an increase of Rs. 437\u20130\u20133 and the Expen-\nditure a decrease of Rs. 1,347\u20132\u20132 on the Budget Estimate, leaving a\nbalance in favour of the Society of Rs. 3,031\u20132\u20135.\n\nThe increase in Receipts is under the heads of Subscriptions and\nSales of Publications. Subscriptions were estimated at Rs. 7,500,\nwhilst the actuals were Rs. 7,786\u20138\u201310, the excess being due to some of\nthe arrear subscriptions from members having been realized. Sales of\nPublications show an increase of Rs. 1,004\u201312\u201311. This large increase\nis due to the adjustment of Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner's accounts for 18 months,\nand of the unexpected sale of periodicals during the period.\n\nAs only 15 new members were elected, there is a reduction of Rs.\n172 under the head of receipts from admission fees; and the difference\nbetween the estimated and actual miscellaneous receipts is due to the\nrefund of income tax not yet having been granted.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the items, of \"Books,\" \"Binding\" and\n\"Printing of Circulars,\" &c., show an increase. Books were estimated\nat Rs. 1,800 whilst the actuals were Rs. 2,372\u201313\u20133, the increase\nbeing due to the adjustment of Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner's account for 18 months.\nTaking into account the period the amount covers, the expenditure on\nBooks is within the Budget Estimate. Binding has increased by Rs.\n51\u201315\u20133. This is due to the binding of some old books, which were\nrequired by members at the close of the year.\n\nAs new labels for sending the publications to Foreign Societies had\nto be printed, and a larger number of circulars than usual were required\nowing to the suggested alteration of rules there is an increase under\nthis head of Rs. 55\u20132.\nThe actual expenditure on the Journal and Proceedings was as follows:\n\nJournal \\{ Part I.\u2014Rs. 860 4 0 \\\\\nPart II.\u2014,, 2,752 13 11 \\\\\nProceedings\u2014,, 814 13 0 \\\\\n\\}\n\nmaking a total of Rs. 4,427 14 11\n\nwhich is less than the Budget Estimate by Rs. 772 1 1.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of Ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1892 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts Rs. 14,988. Expenditure Rs. 13,378.\n\nOn the receipts side the estimate for \"Subscriptions\" has been reduced by Rs. 100, taking into account the number of members elected last year. Miscellaneous has been increased by Rs. 218 as the proceeds of the sale of duplicate coins of the Society at various times since 1887 have been received this year.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the items of \"Petty repairs\" and \"Binding\" have been slightly increased.\n\nDuring the greater part of the past year the appointment of Assistant-Librarian has been vacant. This vacancy will probably be filled up during the present year, but there will still be a considerable reduction in salaries. The estimate is Rs. 3,400.\n\nStationery has been reduced by Rs. 20 as the expenditure of last year has been smaller than usual.\n\nThe details of the Budget Estimate are as follows:\n\n**Receipts.**\n\n| Item                  | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions         | Rs. 7,400 0 0 |\n| Sale of Publications  | 400 0 0   |\n| Interests on Investments | 5,388 0 0 |\n| Rent of Rooms         | 720 0 0   |\n| Miscellaneous         | 1,080 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 14,988 0 0\n\n**Expenditure.**\n\n| Item     | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Salaries | Rs. 3,400 0 0 |\n| Commission | 400 0 0 |\n| Stationery | 80 0 0 |\n| Lighting  | 80 0 0 |\n\nCarried over ... 3,960 0 0\n| Item                  | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Petty Repairs         | 25     |\n| Municipal Taxes       | 819    |\n| Postage               | 700    |\n| Freight               | 10     |\n| Meeting               | 83     |\n| Contingencies         | 150    |\n| Books                 | 1,800  |\n| Local Periodicals     | 31     |\n| Binding               | 500    |\n| Journal, Part I       |        |\n| Journal, Part II      |        |\n| Proceedings           | 1,000  |\n| Printing Circulars &c.| 100    |\n\nTotal Rs. 13,378\n\nLondon Agency.\n\nMessrs.

One number of the late Mr. Atkinson's Catalogue of the Insects of the Oriental Region issued as Supplement No. 2 to Part II of 1890, containing 139 pages of letter press; and the Index to the Journal, Part II for 1890 were also published.\n\nCoin Cabinet.\n\nDuring the year 103 coins were added to the Cabinet, of which 2 were of gold, 72 of silver, 28 of copper and 1 of mixed copper and silver. 97 of these coins were acquired under the Treasure Trove Act. The other 6 were presented by the Government of Bombay under the same Act. They comprise 12 Path\u00e1n, 30 Mughal, 5 Bengal, 28 Jaunpur, 9 Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed, 6 Durr\u00e1n\u00ed, 6 Indo-Sassanian, 1 Sikh, 1 Old English, 1 Baroda, 1 Central Asian, 1 Fanam, 1 Padmatanka coins, besides one of uncertain ascription. Detailed notices of nearly all of them will be found in the Society's Proceedings for August and November.\n\nOffice of Secretaries.\n\nDr. Hoernle returned from leave in March and took charge of the duties of Philological Secretary from Mr. Tawney who had agreed to carry on the work till Dr. Hoernle's return.\n\nMr. Sclater carried on the duties of Natural History Secretary and Editor of the Journal, Part II during the year except for the month of December when he resigned owing to his leaving India, and Dr. Walsh was appointed in his place.\n\nDr. W. King carried on the duties of Treasurer during the year except for one period of about one month when he had to leave Calcutta on duty and Mr. Sclater took charge of the work during his absence.\n\nMr. Little carried on the duties of General Secretary throughout the year.\n\nMr. H. Ronaldson resigned the post of Assistant-Secretary and Librarian in March last and Mr. J. H. Elliott, the Assistant-Librarian, was appointed to officiate in addition to his own duties.\n\nThere were no changes in the posts of Cashier, Pandit and Copyist, which were held by the permanent incumbents B\u00e1bu Nritya Gopal Basu, Pandit Hari Mohan Vidy\u00e1bh\u00fasan and B\u00e1bu Joges Chandra Chatterjee respectively.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\nThirty-four fasciculi were published during the year, of which 11 were in the Arabic-Persian, 20 in the Sanskrit, and 3 in the Tibetan series.\nThey belong to 20 different works of which 4 are in Arabic-Persian, 14 in Sanskrit and two in Tibetan. There were only three new publications one in the Arabic-Persian and two in the Sanskrit series, viz., A commentary on Ten Ancient Arabic Poems and English translations of Aniruddha's Commentary on the S\u0101mkhya S\u016btras and of the Ain-i-Akb\u0101ri. Three works only were completed, namely, the Brihan-N\u0101r\u0101diya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the Nirukta and the T\u0101r\u012bkhi-Firuz Sh\u0101h\u012b. Of these 34 fasciculi, 9, belonging to four works, are translations into English and the rest are editions of texts. The five fasciculi of the Ain-i-Akbari completes, as was expected last year, the English translation of the Second Volume.\n\nIn the Annual Report for 1891 it was estimated that 36 fasciculi would be issued, the actual out-turn has been less by two. During the course of the year it was found that the Oriental Publication Fund was publishing more works than it could meet the cost of, and the editors were accordingly requested to proceed slowly with their work till the liabilities were paid off. The expenditure out of the Oriental Fund during the year was Rs. 12,378, which includes printing charges for 23 and editing charges for 26 fasciculi, which gives an average of Rs. 506 for each fasciculus. If 24 fasciculi are published during the year 1892 there will be no difficulty in meeting current expenses as well as paying off old debts.\n\nNo new works were sanctioned for publication during the year.\n\nThe following are the works already taken in hand of which no fasciculi appeared during the year:\n\n(1) Tabakati-N\u0101siri (index of persons and places); (2) Pr\u0101krita Lakshana, (English translation and notes); (3) K\u0101tantra (introduction); (4) Apastamba Strauta S\u016btra (Text); (5) Lalita Vistara (English translation); (6) Brihaddharma Pur\u0101\u1e47a; (7) Taittir\u012bya Samhit\u0101.\n\nOf the following works sanctioned in previous years, no fasciculi have appeared as yet:\n\n(1) Pr\u0101krit\u0101dhy\u0101ya (Text and translation); (2) Charaka (English translation with notes); (3) Naqaid-ul-Farazdag-Jerir (Text with English translation in prose and verse); (4) K\u0101la Viveka (Text); (5) Ved\u0101nta S\u016btra Commentaries on, (Text); (two of these, viz., Anubh\u0101shyam and Sribh\u0101shyam have been commenced); (6) Karan\u0101 Grantha (Text); (7) Muntakhub-ut-Taw\u0101rikh, Vol. I (English translation); (8) Taj-ul Ma'\u0101sir (Text); (9) T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Wassaf (Text); (10) T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Yamini (English translation with notes); (11) Jnat\u0101dharma Kath\u0101 S\u016btra and Vip\u0101ka S\u016btra (Text); (12) Saddharma Pundar\u012bka (Text); (13) Svayambh\u016b Pur\u0101\u1e47a (Text); (14) Bhattotpala's commentary on Var\u0101ha Mihira's Brihat Sanhit\u0101.\nThe following is a descriptive list of the publications during 1891:\n\nA.

Compared with the previous six years, the figures for the last six show, it is true, a steadily downward tendency in the number of paying members; but this decline seems for the present to have been arrested, as the average number for the three years 1889 to 1891 is at any rate slightly higher than that of the previous three. However much this decline in the number of members from decade to decade may be regretted, it need cause us no surprise. The strain and pressure of official duties in India increase year by year; and the majority of public servants in this country find little leisure for the cultivation of those sciences and the pursuit of those researches which it is the object of this Society specially to foster. There is happily no diminution in the supply of papers read before the Society, or in their interest and value; but a Society constituted as this is lives not only by the papers read but by the subscriptions paid; and it is vitally affected by any cause that tends to reduce the number of those who, feeling a general interest in what has been performed by man or produced by nature within the continent of India, would naturally seek admission to our Society if fuller opportunities for stimulating that interest were afforded them in their daily life and work. But this is an old complaint, and one which it is beyond our power to mend.\n\nThe Society has lost several valued members by death during the past year.\n\nRaja Rajendralala Mitra, C.I.E., was a scholar of European fame. His connexion with this Society extended over a period of nearly half a century. Entering it when a young man, as Assistant Secretary and Librarian, his commanding abilities and untiring industry soon brought him into prominence; and while we may congratulate ourselves that it\nwas this Society which first gave him the opportunity of satisfying his inexhaustible craving for knowledge, we must gratefully admit that he has amply repaid the debt by the contributions that he has made to Oriental learning, and by the lustre that his name and attainments have shed upon the Society, of which he was one of the most distinguished in the long roll of Presidents. When the Centenary Review of the Researches of the Society was in preparation in 1863, Dr. R\u00e1jendra-l\u00e1la Mitra was at once selected as the man to write its history. It was an appropriate and happy choice, and the duty laid upon him and cheerfully undertaken was admirably discharged. His eminence in the field of learning was recognised by the University of Calcutta, which conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor in Law, and by Her Majesty the Queen Empress, who admitted him to the Order of the Indian Empire. But his most enduring title to fame lies in the work which he has done, the extent and solidity of which are acknowledged, not only within the walls of this Society, or even in India, but wherever in the civilised world Oriental scholarship is valued.\n\nSurgeon Major A. Barclay was a man whose premature death was a heavy loss to that distinguished service of which he was one of the most prominent members, and whose honour and interests he had ever at heart. A man of wide and varied cultivation and untiring energy, it was to the study of parasitic fungi that he devoted his special attention; and the scientific world knows well the value of the contributions that he made to that obscure and important subject, not merely in advancing the bounds of our theoretical knowledge, but in suggesting remedies for some of the most dangerous and destructive pests of both animal and vegetable life. His kind and gentle disposition endeared him to all who had the privilege of his friendship.\n\nJohn Boxwell had been a member of our Society for 23 years. Amid the engrossing occupations of a Magistrate and a Commissioner in Bengal, he gave up his rare moments of leisure to the literature of India and the traditions of her people. The character of his learning was varied: he knew the Rig Veda, and he knew the fairy tale; but unhappily the hand of death removed him before he could anshrine the results of his studies in any permanent form. But\n\n\"The world which credits what is done,\nIs cold to all that might have been,\"\n\nand so he has missed the fame which otherwise might have been his. He was a man of a singularly winning and simple nature; and the cross that marks his grave at Dacca fitly describes him as one cum doctrina tum moribus exornatus.\n\nColonel Sir Oliver B. St. John, K. C. S. L., R.E., was another worker\nwhose loss we have to deplore. As Major St. John, Director of the Anglo-Persian Telegraph in 1869-71, he made an extensive collection of zoological specimens chiefly belonging to the Vertebrata, and at the same time kept copious notes of the Fauna. He subsequently contributed largely to the collection brought together by Mr. W. T. Blanford, F.R.S., who accompanied him on the Persian Boundary Commission in 1872. These collections formed the materials for Blanford's work on the Zoology of Persia (Eastern Persia, vol. II), in the preparation of which Major St. John's notes on the Fauna proved of essential service. To the account of the journeys of the Commission (Eastern Persia, vol. I) Major St. John contributed a brief but valuable sketch of the physical geography of Persia, together with an interesting itinerary, in every page of which the ardent naturalist is apparent.\n\nThe financial position of the Society, which at one time gave cause for apprehension, is now approaching a very satisfactory state. The Society is more than Rs. 3,000 better off at the beginning of the current year than it was at the beginning of 1891; the balance in favour of the Society, including the invested securities, having advanced from Rs. 1,37,612 to Rs. 1,40,750, which is higher than it has been at any time since 1887. The report supplies full details of the manner in which this improvement has been effected. Our receipts have been better and our expenditure has been less than in the previous year, the savings having been chiefly effected under the heads of establishment and printing. I should add that only a trifling amount of unpaid bills remains outstanding.\n\nDuring the course of the year the Council proposed that a portion of the Society's invested funds should be transferred from Government Securities, then at a high premium, to Calcutta Municipal Debentures yielding a better rate of interest. The proposal was accepted by the Society, but in endeavouring to carry it out it was found that Municipal Debentures were very firmly held and rarely came into the market. No change in the investment has therefore been made.\n\nThe Oriental Publication Fund shows similar improvement, the Council having found it advisable to take somewhat vigorous measures during the course of the year to reduce the expenditure from this Fund, which was found to be on a scale considerably exceeding its normal income.\n\nNow, therefore, that the period of financial difficulty which once threatened both the Society and the Oriental Publication Fund seems to be over, a brief reference may be made to the causes of these temporary difficulties, and the heads of expenditure which have shown the greatest fluctuations may be compared. Without taking into account\nthe very necessary outlay on the buildings in 1888, which was partly met by the purchase-money of the strip of land adjoining Park Street, the more variable items are salaries and the expenditure on the two parts of the Journal. The total sum spent on the second (or Natural Science) part of the Journal during the past six years is Rs. 20,990, which gives a yearly average of little less than Rs. 3,500. The average for the first (or philological) part during the same period is Rs. 1,255, in which is included the cost of Mr. Grierson's Vernacular Literature of Hindustan, which was however to a large extent met by the receipts on account of copies taken by the Imperial and Provincial Governments.\n\nThe outlay on printing the Journal has been given separately for the two parts in the yearly accounts from 1882 only, so that the expenditure during the past six years can be compared with that of only the four preceding. The average cost for the Journal, Part I, during the years 1882 to 1885 was Rs. 2,244, and for Part II Rs. 1,393. It follows that the cost of Part I decreased in the second period by nearly one-half, while that of Part II increased two-and-a-half times. This increased expenditure on the Natural History Part of the Journal undoubtedly represents a large amount of valuable work on the part of the Natural History Secretary and of those members of the Society who devote their time to science, and it has certainly increased the value of the Journal to the scientific world. Still, we must follow the homely maxim of cutting our coat according to our cloth. The fact that the credit-balance of the Society was lower in 1888 by several thousand rupees than it had ever been before, and that it was lower still in 1890, shows that the outlay incurred during the past four years has been considerably beyond the means of the Society. At the same time it must be borne in mind that about 1885 the work done for the Oriental Publication Fund was largely increased, and the effect of this was naturally shown in the reduced cost of the first part of the Journal. Thus in 1885 the cost of this part was Rs. 2,324; in 1886 it fell to Rs. 1,075, and in 1887 to Rs. 420; after which it again increased, but did not exceed Rs. 1,100 except in 1890. Now that the balance in the Oriental Publication Fund has been exhausted, and the work, as I shall explain directly, has been reduced to its normal dimensions, it is to be expected that the number of papers selected for publication in Part I of the Journal will again increase, thus furnishing an additional reason for keeping the expenditure on Part II of the Journal within normal limits.\n\nThe average yearly payment for salaries from 1882 to 1885 was Rs. 4,173; and during the past six years this average has been exceeded twice only, in the years 1889 and 1890, while the average for these\nyears has been Rs. 3,840, or Rs. 330 less than during the previous four years. As the strictest economy has been practised whenever possible, advantage was taken of the opportunity given by the resignation of Mr. Ronaldson to work with a reduced staff, so that the salary bill for the past year has been much less than at any time in the previous ten years. The whole expenditure under this head in 1891 is Rs. 3,138, or more than a thousand rupees less than the average for the years 1882 to 1885.\n\nThus during these past six years there has been, in comparison with the previous four, a considerable saving on Part I of the Journal, and in salaries. It appears that the low balance in 1890 was chiefly caused by the expenditure on Part II of the Journal. Between the years 1879 and 1885 the balance at credit of the Society varied between Rs. 1,42,000 and Rs. 1,45,000, but since the latter year it has exceeded Rs. 1,42,000 in 1887 only. In 1888 it was Rs. 1,38,032, and in 1890 Rs. 1,37,611. Owing to the careful economy practised by the Council during the past year, the balance is now nearly Rs. 1,41,000, and there is every prospect of a further increase. The opportunity should now be taken to revert to the rule that all entrance fees should be added to the permanent investment instead of to the cash balance; and as there is no longer any urgent reason for keeping the staff on its present reduced footing, the permanent appointment of an Assistant Secretary may now be taken into consideration.\n\nThe financial history of the Oriental Publication Fund during the past ten years is altogether different from that of the Society. Up to 1884 the credit-balance was steadily increasing by variable amounts of from two to five thousand rupees a year, the number of fasciculi produced annually at that time being on an average about 21. In 1884 the balance was over Rs. 21,000, and it then became evident that the rate of publication must be increased. A larger number of Sanskrit and Persian works was taken up for publication, with the result that the balance diminished by about Rs. 4,000 a year, and was practically exhausted at the end of 1890. The number of fasciculi published reached a maximum in 1888, when it stood at 58. It became apparent, however, during the past two years that the machinery thus set in motion would continue to work longer than was desirable, and measures have been adopted by the Council, especially during the past year, to limit the publication to the normal number, that is, to the number which can be paid for from the yearly income. Not only has no new work been undertaken, but the less important work already in hand has been suspended. The full effect of\nthis will appear in the reduced charges for printing and editing during the current year. Assuming that the total income is Rs. 12,000, the working expenses Rs. 2,000, and the average cost of a fasciculus for both editing and printing Rs. 400, the number that can be produced annually is 25. The Council has now arranged that during the current year this number shall, at any rate, not be exceeded.\n\nStatement No. 2 of the accounts for the past year shows that the condition of the O.P. Fund at the end of the year is fairly satisfactory; the cash balance having increased from Rs. 469 to Rs. 1,172, and the outstanding liabilities having been largely reduced, though they still stand at about Rs. 6,000, a considerable portion of which, however, will be paid off during the current year. The improvement is due to the sale of publications having been larger than usual, and to the accounts, as rendered by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co., covering a period of 18 instead of 12 months. But judging from the increased receipts from the sale of publications during the past few years, there is good reason to suppose that there will be a steady income to the fund under this head of about Rs. 3,500.\n\nBefore passing on to a brief review of the work done by the Society and outside it in some of the different departments of Literature and Science during the past year, it is my duty, and a very agreeable duty, to remind you of the services rendered to the Society by its Officers, and of the obligations under which their zeal and devotion place us. The extent and pressure of the work that devolves upon the Secretaries are perhaps little understood except by those who have practical experience of it; and, without an amount of labour that is always considerable and often severe, it is not too much to say that the work of the Society could not be carried on. The death of R\u00e1ja R\u00e9jendral\u00e1l\u00e1 Mitra created a vacancy in the Vice-Presidentship, which the Council have proposed to fill by the nomination of Mr. C. J. Lyall, c.l.e., to that office, a nomination which you have now confirmed. I need hardly remind you that Mr. Lyall is known to the learned world as one of the most erudite and accomplished of Arabic scholars, and that he has already placed us under obligations by his edition of Abu Zakariya's Commentary on Ten Ancient Arabic Poems. The closer connexion of Mr. Lyall with the Society cannot fail to increase its usefulness. Mr. Little has discharged the onerous and important duties of the General Secretary throughout the year with eminent success. To Dr. Hoernle's conspicuous services as Editor of Part I of the Journal the Society is greatly indebted. Dr. Hoernle has now been placed on special duty by the Government of Bengal in order to complete the editing of the Bower MS. He has\naccordingly expressed a desire to be relieved of the office of Philological Secretary, the duties of which have been readily undertaken by Mr. C. R. Wilson, with the exception of the numismatical work which Dr. Hoernle has consented to retain. Mr. W. L. Sclater has been no less devoted and successful as Editor of the Natural History section of the Journal. On his taking furlough to Europe, Dr. Tull Walsh very kindly consented to take up these duties. Lastly, on R\u00e9ja R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra's death, Pandit Hara Prasad Shastri was invited by the Council to undertake the duties connected with the search for Sanskrit MSS., and with the supervision of the Sanskrit portion of the Bibliotheca Indica publications. For such duties he is eminently fitted, and he has been recommended by the Council for appointment as additional Philological Secretary, in order to enable him to discharge them more effectively. To all these gentlemen, and to our Honorary Treasurer, Dr. W. King, the Society rests under deep obligations, and I would ask you to pass a cordial vote of thanks to them for their services so freely rendered during the past year. (The vote of thanks was carried by acclamation).\n\nMy own obligations to the Secretaries and other members of the Society are of a different kind. In the review that follows I have had to rely very largely\u2014in the department of Natural Science I may say entirely\u2014on the assistance of gentleman who are experts in their respective branches of knowledge, and I beg to offer them my cordial thanks for the help so willingly rendered. I am especially indebted to Dr. Hoernle, Dr. Tull Walsh, Mr. Cotes, Dr. Prain, Pandit Hara Prasad Shastri, Col. Thuillier, R. H., Col. Waterhouse, Mr. C. R. Wilson, Mr. Wood-Mason, Babu Sarat Chandra Das, c. i. e., and, for constant assistance of every kind, to Mr. Little.\n\nI begin, therefore, with some notes on the literary and archaeological department of our work, including Philology, History, Ethnology, Archaeology, Epigraphy and Numismatics. Papers on nearly all these subjects have been published in Part I of the Journal and in the Proceedings. Of the Journal, Part I, two numbers have been issued; a third is nearly ready and was to have been issued before the close of the year. It has been delayed by fresh researches, resulting in important discoveries regarding the Bower MS., of which an account will be given later on.\n\nUnder the head of Philology the publications of the Bibliotheca Bibliotheca Indica. Indica occupy an important place. During the year 34 fasciculi have been issued, including 20 Sanskrit, 11 Arabic and Persian, and 3 Tibetan publications. As already explained, a larger number might have been produced, but the\nstate of the Oriental Publication Fund rendered it necessary to restrict the out-turn. Next year there will be a still greater reduction; but in future years it may be anticipated that the recovery of the Fund to a solvent condition will enable us to return to our normal issue. Three works were completed during the year; these were the T\u00e1rikh-i-Firuz Sh\u00e1hi of Shams Siraj 'Arif, edited by Maulavi Vilayat Husain of the Calcutta Madrasa; the Brihanm\u00e1rdiya Pur\u00e1na, edited by Pandit Hriki-ke\u015ba Sh\u00e1stri; and the Nirukta, edited by Pandit Satyavrata Sama\u015brami.\n\nAmong the numbers issued, the two following works deserve conspicuous notice.\n\nThe Ain-i-Akbari of Abulfazl, Translated with Notes by Col. H. S. Jarrett. 2nd Volume.\n\nThe first volume of this translation was published by the late Mr. Blochmann as long ago as 1873, and is deservedly held in very high estimation. At the time of the author's death, it was thought that he had left the remainder of the translation in manuscript; but it could never be discovered, and the Society afterwards made repeated attempts without success to secure the completion of the work. At last Col. Jarrett undertook the task; and the Society is to be congratulated on the completion of the second volume. The third volume is in course of preparation, and will probably be finished in another year. Col. Jarrett's translation is made uniform with Mr. Blochmann's, and is similarly furnished with copious notes illustrating the difficulties of the text.\n\nA Commentary by Abu Zakariya Yahya at-Tibrizi on Ten Ancient Arabic Poems, edited by C. J. Lyall, c. i. e. Fasc. I.\n\nThe ten poems included in this work, which are all pre-Islamic, are the seven Mu'allag\u00e1t and three other odes, by al-A'isha, an-N\u00e1bighah, and 'Abid ibn al-Abras respectively. The only one of the ten which has not previously been printed is the last. But the commentary, which is by the same hand as the great commentary on the Ham\u00e1sah published by Dr. G. W. Freytag, has remained till the present inedited. It is now published on the basis of an excellent ancient MS. at Cambridge, collated with others from Leiden and the British Museum, and with three MSS. of an-Nahh\u00e1s's commentary upon which Tibrizi chiefly relies. The fasciculus issued this year carries the work to the middle of the poem of 'Antarah: another will complete the text, to which it is intended to add indices and a critical apparatus.\n\nI would also draw attention to the Tibetan publications of the Tibetan Literature. Bibliotheca Indica series, for which we are indebted to Babu Sarat Chandra Das, c. i. e., and Babu Pratap Chandra Ghosh. This is a comparatively new field of work, which is arousing considerable interest in Europe. The mass of\nTibetan literature accessible to us is enormous, and of very unequal value; and it will be necessary to exercise great care in selecting works for publication in this series.\n\nReference may also be made to a paper on the life of the Indian Pandit, Atisa, otherwise known as Dipamkara Srij\u00f1\u00e1na, by Babu Sarat Chandra Das, c. i. e., published in Part I of the Journal. Dipamkara was a learned Pandit of Magadha, to whom Lha Lama, the king of Tibet, sent messengers in the first half of the 11th century, inviting him to visit Tibet in order to restore the pure doctrines of Buddhism, which had become debased in that country by an admixture of Tantric and Pon mysticism. After many refusals he was prevailed on to visit Tibet in the year 1038 A.D., when the king received him with the utmost respect and veneration, and conferred on him the title of Jovo Atisa, (the Supreme Lord who has surpassed all). He revived the practice of the pure Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na doctrine, and died near Lhasa in 1053 A.D. at the age of 73.\n\nI may also notice the papers of the late Dr. Karl Marx, published in numbers 2 and 3 of Part I of the Journal, one being a translation of a dialogue from the Tibetan between a wicked king and his minister, and the other a notice of documents relating to the history of Ladakh, at which place Dr. Marx was a missionary. Death has been very busy in the last few years with Tibetan scholars. We have lost Schiefner, Minayeff, and J\u00e4schke, and now the successor of J\u00e4schke at Ladakh has followed him.\n\n*Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary.*\u2014An account may here be given of the Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary, in the preparation of which Babu Sarat Chandra Das, as the Tibetan Translator to Government, has been engaged for the last two or three years under the orders of the Government of Bengal. At the close of the Preface to his Tibetan Dictionary, published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1834, Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s wrote:\u2014\"When there shall be more interest taken in Buddhism and in the diffusion of Christian and European knowledge throughout the most Eastern parts of Asia, the Tibetan Dictionary may be much improved, enlarged and illustrated by the addition of Sanskrit terms.\" The projected dictionary is intended to satisfy this requirement, only much more fully than de K\u00f6r\u00f6s contemplated. Since his time another Tibetan Dictionary has appeared, the production of J\u00e4schke, the Moravian Missionary at Ladakh. This work, though a great improvement on Csoma's, does not meet the critical requirements of the present day. J\u00e4schke had not at his command the resources necessary for such an undertaking. He was thoroughly familiar with Tibetan as a spoken language; but as regards its literary form, he had access to only a\nlimited number of Tibetan works that had been published in Germany and at St. Petersburg, besides a few block-prints obtained from itinerant Lamas at Ladakh. More than this, words of every style and of every age are collected together in J\u00e4schke's dictionary without any attempt at classification.\n\nThe dictionary which Babu Sarat Chandra Das with his coadjutors has now in hand is of much wider scope than either of its predecessors, and its materials are derived from many different sources. It was in the first instance undertaken at the suggestion of Professor Max M\u00fcller, who was anxious to ascertain the exact force of the Tibetan renderings of current philosophical terms used in Sanskrit-Buddhist literature. These technical terms, it was known, were rendered into Tibetan by their precise syllabic equivalents, in conformity with a system framed for the purpose by the Pandits engaged in the work of translating into Tibetan the sacred books of Indian Buddhism. It was hoped that in this way much new light would be thrown on the original meaning of the philosophical terms of that literature, which is now in many instances most obscure.\n\nThe dictionary has accordingly been framed on these lines. The Tibetan word is first given, and then its Sanskrit equivalent, if any, followed by (1) a literal translation of the word according to its etymology, (2) the sense or senses in which the word is used in speech or literature, (3) illustrative examples taken from Tibetan works either published or accessible in known libraries. In order to secure, as far as possible, an exhaustive vocabulary and a copious supply of illustrations, Tibetan literature has been ransacked. Recourse has been had, not only to Tibetan-Sanskrit vocabularies like the Vyutpatti and the Mah\u0101vyutpatti, some of which had already been translated by R\u00e9msat into French and by Csoma into English; and to Sanskrit works like the Kalpalata Kavy\u0101dar\u015ba with their absolutely faithful Tibetan translations; but also to a still larger treasury of literary and scientific wealth. The Kahgyur, or collection of Buddhist Scriptures, comprises 108 volumes of about 500 leaves each. With the help of Lama Sherab Gyatsho, of the Goom Monastery near Darjeeling, 90 of these volumes have been analysed for the purposes of the dictionary. The Tangyur, which contains 225 volumes, is a still richer storehouse of learning. It contains the text of P\u0101\u1e47ini and other grammarians, treatises from the Sanskrit on ethics, political science and political economy, and even poems like the Meghad\u016bta\u2014all transcribed literatim in the Tibetan character, together with Tibetan translations and commentaries. The Tangyur is in fact a cyclopaedia of Indo-Tibetan literature; and the means by which so many ancient Sanskrit works had been preserved in Tibet\nand interpreted to the people had long been a source of wonder to scholars in Europe. Unfortunately we possess no copy of the Tangyur, as we do of the Kahgyur. Babu Sarat Chandra Das has succeeded in obtaining the loan of one volume from the Labrong Monastery in Sikkim; but if the whole were accessible to him, the value of his work would be greatly increased.\n\nBut it is not merely the scientific terms of classical literature that will find a place in this dictionary. The work is intended, as far as possible, to be complete; and will include the language of the present time and of every-day use\u2014in fact, the current vernacular of Tibet. Contributions have also been levied from a large collection of Tibetan and Bhootea correspondence, captured during the late Tibetan campaign. These contain a great variety of idiomatic and honorific words and phrases, the use of which is confined to correspondence and to polite conversation. From another quarter has been obtained a large stock of words peculiar to the terminology of the Pon mysticism, which is thought to have preceded Buddhism in Tibet. These terms are little known to orthodox Buddhists, and were entirely unknown to either Csoma or J\u00e4schke. Readers of our publications will remember how many papers on the Pon religion Babu Sarat Chandra Das has contributed to the Journal, from books and materials which he collected during his residence in Tibet. Aid is also promised from abroad; Professor Foucaux of Paris having kindly offered to place at Babu Sarat Chandra Das' disposal the materials that he has himself collected with a similar object, including a long list of philosophical terms from Buddhist-Sanskrit sources. Finally, in the interpretation of Sanskrit terms, Babu Sarat Chandra will have the valuable assistance of Pandit Hari Mohan Vidyabhushan, the Pandit employed by this Society.\n\nThe arrangement of the dictionary will be alphabetical; all the words derived from one root being placed together under that root, and each word being again found in its alphabetical place, with a reference to the word under which its meaning is discussed. The difficult question of pronunciation is provided for by a method at once simple and clear. Typographical devices will be used to distinguish modern and colloquial words from those that are scientific or ancient. Some of the work is now ready for the press, but it will necessarily take a long time before so elaborate an undertaking is completed.\n\nOf works published in 1891 outside the Society, on subjects relating to Oriental Philology, the following may be noticed:\n\n*Introduction to the History of Language*, by H. A. Strong, W. S. Logan and B. I. Wheeler.\u2014This useful book professes to be little\nmore than an exposition of the German work of Prof. Paul on the Principles of the History of Language\u2014a reproduction of the same matter in less technical language, and with illustrations drawn mainly from languages with which the English student is thought to be familiar. It will be welcomed by all to whom the German work may be inaccessible.\n\nComparative Dictionary of the Indo-European Languages by Professor A. Fick. Fourth edition.\u2014The first edition of this great work was published more than 20 years ago, and created an epoch in the history of scientific philology. Since then Comparative Philology has made great progress; some old theories have been overthrown, some disputed points have been determined, and new discoveries have been made. It is no wonder, then, that the fourth edition is, in many respects, a new work. The field is too vast for one scholar, and Prof. Fick has now secured the assistance of the best men in each department, such as Sir Whitley Stokes, Prof. Bezzemberger and others. The Dictionary contains three comparative vocabularies, one of the \"parent speech,\" another of the Eastern, and the third of the Western European periods of linguistic unity.\n\nThe Memoirs of Sh\u00e1h Tahm\u00e1sb I of Persia, by Dr. Paul Horn.\u2014The Persian text of this work, towards the editing of which the Society contributed a MS. from its library, has been published by Dr. Horn in the Journal of the German Oriental Society for 1891. A German translation has been published by him in a separate little volume, with some useful notes and an index of names.\n\nM\u00e1nava Dharma S'\u00e1stram, edited with a Commentary by Pandit Bhi-ma Sena Sarman.\u2014This is a new edition of the well-known law-book of Mann, which has been repeatedly published, the last time by Professor Jolly in Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series. The author explains in his preface his reasons for republishing the work, on which he promises to throw much new light in his commentary. It promises to be an extensive undertaking. Seven fasciculi have appeared, and the Pandit is still in the midst of his introductory dissertation, in which he discusses such questions as the identity of Manu, the date of his writing, and the object of his law-book, and speculates on the contents of each of its chapters. The book is written in both Sanskrit and Hindi.\n\nCatalogus Catalogorum, by Professor Th. Aufrecht.\u2014This is perhaps the most valuable publication of the year. It is a descriptive list of all Sanskrit Literature and Sanskrit authors known, and has been published at the expense of the English Government.\n\nTheodore Aufrecht holds a very high place among the Sanskrit scholars of Europe. He was already well known to the learned world\nby his Latin Catalogue of Sankrit MSS. in the Bodleian at Oxford, and by his English Catalogue of those in Trinity College, Cambridge. His *Catalogus Catalogorum* is a work of the first importance, which has cost him thirty years of close application. In it he has arranged in alphabetical order the names of Sanskrit works and their authors so far as they were procurable. He has given references to the catalogue or catalogues in which these names are to be found. Under the titles of books, he has given the names of their Commentaries in alphabetical order, and under the names of authors, he has given the names of all books attributed to them. It is an invaluable work of reference to the bibliographer and to those engaged in the search for Sanskrit MSS. The labour of these investigators will be greatly economised, for they will not need to trouble themselves about works which have already been described by eminent men like B\u00fchler, Peterson and others. Economy of space in future catalogues is a matter of great importance.\n\nAufrecht has compiled his work from 56 different series of catalogues, published from the time of Sir William Jones up to the present day. He has made full use of the catalogues published in connexion with the search for Sanskrit MSS. in India. It was a drawback to him that these works have not been prepared on one uniform plan. Some of them are mere lists of names; others, while giving some information about the works in a tabular form, are silent as to their contents; others again give detailed information in English about important works, relegating those of less importance to a tabular statement of no great value, while the descriptions, being given in English, are useless to the pandits of India. It requires a thorough acquaintance with these different catalogues to be able to find out from Aufrecht whether any MS. under inquiry has been adequately described or not in a previous catalogue.\n\nTo the works above named may be added, *Studies on the History of the Indo-European Languages*, by C. Bartholomae, and a *Grammar of the Khassi Language* by the Rev. H. Roberts.\n\nAmong papers that have appeared in the different periodicals of Europe, the following deserve mention:\n\n1. A series of papers by Dr. R. Morris in the *Academy* (May to August 1891,) on P\u00e1li and Jaina Prakrit words of obscure or peculiar etymology.\n\n2. A paper by Professor E. Leumann in the *Vienna Oriental Journal*, Vol. V, No. 2, on the legend of Chitta and Sambh\u00fata, as given in Buddhist and Jaina records. (This is one of the 550 J\u00e1takas or birth-stories of the Buddhists.)\n\n3. A paper in the same number of the *Journal*, by Professor H. Jacobi on Indian Metres, showing that the development of Indian\nmetres cannot be explained on the rhythmical theory, but must have followed an entirely different line; and that it cannot be fully known what this line was until we acquire a more accurate knowledge of Indian Music. Mr. C. B. Clarke's paper on the theory of Indian Music, originally published in the Calcutta Review, is doubtless familiar to many members of this Society, and was, I believe, the first attempt made to treat the question scientifically.\n\n(4) A paper by A. Conrady in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, containing the grammar and examples of the Newari language.\n\n(5) A paper in the same Journal by Prof. Th. N\u00f6ldeke, on the texts of the Book of the Ten Vazirs, especially on an old Persian version of it.\n\nSearch for Sanskrit MSS.\u2014Professor Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum leads me to refer to the work that has recently been done in the search for Sanskrit MSS., for which purpose a liberal grant has been for some years made by the Government of India. I am indebted to Pandit Har Prasad Shastri for the following account of the work of the last few years.\n\nThe collection of Sanskrit MSS. and the publication of their catalogues by eminent men like Sir William Jones, Colonel Mackensie, Horace Hayman Wilson, Colebrooke and others, created an interest in these MSS. in Europe from the time that Sanskrit first became known to scholars about a hundred years ago. Every one in India who had a taste for Sanskrit collected MSS., and gave or sold them to one or other of the numerous libraries in Europe. But about 25 years ago it was found that with the decadence of Native States, the encouragement given by the Government of India to English education, and the consequent loss of the influence which Brahmins exercised over the Hindu population, Sanskrit learning was falling into neglect, tols began rapidly to disappear, and collections of MSS. remained uncared for in the possession of men who could not appreciate their worth. A great pandit dies; his son, an educated gentleman with no knowledge of Sanskrit, takes some care of the MSS., but merely as a memento of his learned father; wraps them up carefully, dries them in the sun after the rainy season, and preserves them in the best room in his family dwelling house. But his tastes are different, his children are educated under widely different circumstances, and these consider the MSS. as mere lumber, which occupy space where they could conveniently put a table or a chair. As soon as they come into possession, they relegate the MSS. to the lumber room, the cook-room or the cow-shed, where young girls taught by the Zenana Mission use them as waste-paper; the planks being utilised to kindle fire for cooking. This state of things\nbecoming widely known, a letter was addressed by Pandit Radha Kissen of the late Lahore Darbar to the Government of India, urging Government to do something for the preservation of these MSS.; and after much correspondence a liberal grant was made for the purpose by the Government of Lord Lawrence. The various Provincial Governments made their own arrangements for carrying on the search for Sanskrit MSS. In Madras these operations have been carried on by A. C. Burnell, Gustav Oppert and Lewis Rice; in Bombay by the celebrated scholars, B\u00fchler, Kielhorn, Bhandarkar and Peterson; in the Punjab by Kashinath Kunte; and in Oudh by Deviprasad. In the North-Western Provinces the duty was entrusted to the Librarian of the Benares Sanskrit College. In Bengal the work was given to the Asiatic Society, which made it over in turn to R\u00e1ja R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra who, assisted by three pandits, one of whom travelled all over the country, published several volumes of Notices of Sanskrit MSS. in the course of 19 years. A very large number of private libraries was visited. Notices were prepared by the travelling pandit in a prescribed form, giving a detailed abstract of any new book that he happened to find. But the work of compiling and editing these Notices, and putting them into a presentable shape, was done by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself. His work has elicited just praise from Theodore Aufrecht in the Catalogus Catalogorum. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 intended to write a critical report of the works brought to light during the period he was in charge, and it is a source of great regret that he has been removed from the scene of his labours before he had time to accomplish his wishes.\n\nInspection of Sanskrit Tols.\u2014The attention of the Government of Bengal having been directed to the decline that was alleged to be taking place in the popularity and efficiency of the indigenous institutions known as tols, in which for centuries past Sanskrit has been taught by pandits of repute to successive generations of pupils, the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Charles Elliott, deputed Mah\u00e1mahop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya Mahes Chandra Ny\u00e1yaratna, c. i. e., the Principal of the Sanskrit College of Calcutta, to inspect and report on these institutions. For more than 60 years an allowance of Rs. 100 a month has been made by the Government for the support of pupils in the tols of Nadiya, and this allowance has in recent years been increased to Rs. 150, and again to Rs. 200 a month. Grants of Rs. 500 a year each are also made to the Dacca Sarasvat\u00ed Sam\u00e1j and the Behar Sanskrit San\u00e1van, two local associations of pandits and of those interested in Sanskrit study, for the improvement of the tols by means of examinations and rewards. The Lieutenant-Governor intimated a wish to make a further grant in support of the tols, if it should be found on inquiry that money could be usefully spent in the\nfurtherance of that object. Pandit Mahes Chandra Ny\u00e1yaratna was accordingly placed on special duty for three months, during which he visited all the chief centres of Sanskrit learning in Bengal, Behar and Orissa; and he has now submitted a report which will, I hope, soon be made public, and which gives many interesting details, hitherto unpublished, regarding the constitution of the tols, the course of studies pursued in them, and the special characteristics which distinguish them in different parts of the province. A full account is also given of the various institutions, religious or secular, which have been locally established in recent years for the promotion of Sanskrit study; of the Sanskrit schools maintained by these associations as well as by individual patrons of learning; of the examinations conducted by them, either independently or in subordination to the Sanskrit Title examination, held annually by Government in Calcutta and other centres for the award of Sanskrit titles to the students of tols; and of the effect of such examinations in maintaining and stimulating the study of Sanskrit. The following extract from the report will be of interest, as showing the causes that have led to the decline of the tols:\n\n\"The old custom of sons pursuing the calling of the father, which made pandits' sons grow up to be pandits, unless they happened to lack the mental power to do so, is losing its hold upon the country, and pandits' sons are accordingly being trained up for secular callings that promise better prospects from a worldly point of view than the calling of a pandit. Thus it is that families of pandits in Bengal have all been tending to assimilate themselves to the other Brahman families of the province, i.e., have all been tending towards secular callings that hold out prospects of pecuniary gain. Most of the best pandits of Bengal, all the Mah\u00e1mahop\u00e1dhy\u00e1yas without exception, have trained up or are training up their sons or grandsons for other callings than their own\u2014have given them or are giving them, in fact, an English education. It is but natural that men should prepare their sons for such walks of life as they think would be most advantageous to them, and this is what the pandits of Bengal have been doing. Non-pandit Brahman families hardly ever think of training up any juvenile member at a tol for the career of a pandit. Our tols are thus being threatened with a stoppage of supply of boys. An utter stoppage of supply is not likely to occur in the near future, but matters appear to be clearly tending to this. The aggregate intellectual capacity of the present generation of tol students is lower than that of the past generation as unquestionably, I think, as the number is lower; and this deterioration in quality and decrease in number, judging from present circumstances, tend to be progressive. To arrest this\ndecline very liberal help from individuals and from the State would be needed.\"\n\nThe proposals of Pandit Mahesha Chandra Nyayaratna involve considerable expenditure, in the way partly of providing stipends for selected teachers of distinction, and partly of assigning rewards to teachers and scholarships to pupils on the results of annual examinations. I think we shall all agree that if the decline of these ancient and interesting schools of Sanskrit can be arrested at a moderate outlay on the part of Government\u2014an outlay which will almost certainly arouse the liberality of the wealthy in this country\u2014the money will be well spent.\n\nThe number of publications received in 1890, under Act XXV. of Vernacular Literature of India. 1867, in the eleven libraries of the Empire was 7,877, and reports on these works have been issued by the Home Department of the Government of India. Several catalogues for 1891 have also been issued, but with the exception of those for Bengal, Bombay and Madras, the catalogues are generally mere lists. In the following paragraphs, for which I am indebted to Pandit Hara Prasad Shastri, M.A., the Bengal Librarian, a brief account will be given of the most important of these publications.\n\nThey naturally divide themselves under two heads, viz., Original works and Republications. It is remarkable that the original works of the present day are almost wholly in prose, and the republications almost wholly in verse. Since the days of the Br\u00e4hma\u1e47as and Upanishads no original work of any value has until recently been written in prose; that having been left entirely to the Commentators and to the heretical Buddhists and Jains. The vernaculars of India, with the exception of Urdu, were altogether without prose until the introduction of English education in this country about 50 years ago. Greater activity is, however, now displayed in searching for and publishing ancient works, than in writing new ones. The original works include art, biography, history, fiction, essays on all subjects, and voyages and travels; the republications including poetry, grammar, dictionaries, and theology in almost all its phases.\n\nFine Arts.\u2014Valuable works on Fine Art have been written by, or published at the expense of, titled gentlemen of wealth and influence. Rajah Sir Saurindra Mohan Tagore keeps up the reputation of Bengal by publishing works on the literature of music; and the Senior Rajah of Venkatagiri is the author of a Telugu work on music, which embraces both the Hindu and Muhammadan systems. This valuable work teaches music, both vocal and instrumental, and also dancing. Painting has not much advanced, but the religious pictures drawn by the students of the\nGovernment School of Art are a great improvement on the painting practised 20 years ago. The maps of various countries recently published show a great improvement in artistic skill.\n\n**Biography.**\u2014The biographical literature of India is rich and useful. The people are learning to study man as he is, and are leaving off the old way of deifying and worshipping every great man of their nation. The list of biographies, which, it will be seen, is by no means confined to India, contains the following names:\u2014The late Dewan Peshkar of Pudn Cota, in English; Sh\u00e1h Lat\u00edf, the greatest poet of Sindh, in Arabic-Sindhi; Socrates in Gujarati; Richard Cobden in Marathi; Tantia Bhil in Bengali, English and Marathi; Bachchar\u00e1ja, a Jaina saint, in Gujarati; B\u00e1gbhata, a great medical writer, and Kaly\u00e1na Deva, a Rajput hero, in Marathi; Ballabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, the great Vaishnav reformer of Western India, in Gujarati, and in Sanskrit and Gujarati; Udar L\u00e1l, a great Hind\u00fa saint of Sindh, who saved many lives from Muhammadan persecution, in Arabic-Sindhi; Bh\u00e1nn D\u00e1s, a great worshipper of Bithova in Pandarpur, in Marathi; B\u00e1pu Gokl\u00e1, the last of the great Marhatta generals, who died manfully fighting in the defence of Marhatta independence, in Marathi; Chaitanya, the great Bengal reformer, in Canarese; Ku\u00f1war Fathl\u00e1lji Mahata, in Urdu; Henry Lawrence in Urdu; Edward Gibbon in Hindi; Abraham Lincoln in Marathi; Bradlaugh in English and in Marathi; Bhol\u00e1n\u00e1th S\u00e1r\u00e1bh\u00e1i, the well-known theistic Reformer of the Western Presidency, in Gujarati; Pandit J\u00e1varachandra Vidy\u00e1s\u00e1gara, Narottama D\u00e1s, Prabodh\u00e1nanda Sarasvat\u00ed, and Dr. Duff, in Bengali.\n\n**Drama and Fiction.**\u2014Prose works of imagination, namely, dramas and works of fiction, are many and various, but they do not show much originality or boldness of conception. They treat mostly of the quarrels of the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law; of educated ladies married to uneducated men of equal family rank; of learned B\u00e1bus married to illiterate wives; of the miseries of married widows, written by the orthodox classes; and of the miseries of girl widows, by the friends of progress. For instance, *Indulikha* in Malayalam is a tale of a girl's marriage against her wishes; *Bhulbhulam\u00e1ri* in Gujarati and *Sankay\u00e9 Str\u00ed* in Marathi, are stories of jealous wives; *Shirin Madam* in Gujarati is a lifelike picture of Parsi life in Bombay.\n\nThe writers often desert India and travel to European countries in quest of their heroes and heroines. For instance, the *Chaste Jewess* in Gujarati gives a description of the persecutions of the Jews by the English in the 13th century. *A'iche M\u00e1l\u00edn\u00ed*, in the same language, is a Christian tale. *Chh\u00e1y\u00e1* in Bengali is a picture of a joint family just before its decline under the altered circumstances in which India is now placed.\nAndh B\u0101lak presents a faithful picture of Hind\u016b family life in the Mufassil, both in wealth and in poverty. Vi\u1e41\u015ba S'at\u0101bd\u012b is a work of fiction, giving a picture of what India may be a hundred years hence. Sankalpa S\u016bryodaya in Tamil is an adaptation of a Sanskrit drama of the same name, which is unknown to the learned world outside Southern India. It is something like an allegory, though not written in the manner of the Prabodha Chandrodaya of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Mi\u015bra. It is written in the interest of R\u0101m\u0101nuja's followers.\n\nThe drama describing the career of the great Jaina saint Sthulabhadra in Gujar\u0101t\u012b shows that Jaina saints have still a hold on the people of India. Bambh\u0101manjar\u012b is a newly written Sanskrit drama from Southern India. Such works in Sanskrit are not at all rare in any part of India. K\u0101l\u012b Kautuka R\u0101paka is an allegorical Hind\u016b drama which describes the evils of the K\u0101l\u012b Yuga.\n\nGrammars and Lexicons.\u2014These works are of great philological value, and some of the very best books have been published during the period under review. The Pandits of East Bengal are rapidly publishing all supplementary works of the K\u0101tantra or Kal\u0101pa school of grammar. Pandit H\u1e5bidike\u015ba Sh\u0101str\u012b has finished his edition of the Supadma Kaumud\u012b, a work based on P\u0101\u1e47ini, but written, it is said, by a descendant of the great Vararuchi. Rasagang\u0101dhara, an important rhetorical work of great value, is being published in the K\u0101vyam\u0101l\u0101 series of Bombay.\n\nWorks still more rare and important have been issued in Madras. Urichol Nik\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du is a rare lexicon of the Tamil tongue. It was long supposed to have been lost. It gives, in the form of the celebrated Amar\u0101kosa, the synonyms of all things in heaven and earth, with the exception of abstract qualities. Nigha\u1e47\u1e6du, of which Nik\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du is only a Tamil form, means 'a work of synonyms'; and we have the great Vedic Nigha\u1e47\u1e6du, on which Y\u0101ska has written his Nirukta in the form of a Commentary. Pingala Nik\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du is another important discovery of a lost work. The synonyms in this work are those of metrical, grammatical and rhetorical terms. Another lexicon, a medical one, in Telugu, gives synonyms of words divided according to the six medical rasas to which all things belong. Many Gujar\u0101t\u012b merchants trade with the Western Coast of Africa, where the Swahili is the chief language, and so these merchants have published a guide to the Swahili language in the Gujar\u0101t\u012b character. This, like most African languages, has no written character of its own. Besides these, Bombay has published a Hebrew Dictionary, to help people in acquiring a knowledge of the Hebrew, Chaldaic and Talmudic languages, and a metrical grammar of the Avasta language.\n\nThe V\u012bra Ko\u015ba, a Beng\u0101li encyclopedia, was stopped for want of\nsupport five years ago. B\u00e1b\u00fa N\u00e1gendra N\u00e1th Basu has undertaken to carry it on, and has published 12 parts in the year. The last word is Kalik\u00e1t\u00e1, or Calcutta, and the writer has collected a mass of very valuable information on the history and antiquities of the city.\n\nHistory.\u2014The historical literature of Bengal, the North-Western Provinces, and Sindh is of no great importance. Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra and the Panjab have a history, and are therefore rich in historical literature. The Panjab has not, however, published anything of importance except Karin\u00e1m\u00e1-i-waliyan Sialkot, giving the history of Peshwara Singh and Kashm\u00edra Singh, the reputed sons of Ranj\u00edt Singh, the Lion of the Panjab. In Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, however, have been published a history of Shambh\u00faji and R\u00e1j\u00e1ram, the sons of Shivaji; Dhundhu B\u00e1la Kri\u0161ha Sahasrabuddhi's account of the career of Parasur\u00e1m Rao and of the troubles of his times; the Chronicles of the Peshwas from 1713 to 1818, that is, for the entire period of their existence as a great power in India, by an officer of the Court of B\u00e1ji Rao II, written either immediately before or immediately after the British conquest in 1818; and a history of Madhu Rao II, who was succeeded by Baji Rao II. The history of Surat from its foundation 700 years ago, in Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed; an abstract history of Mecca in Urd\u00fa; a history of the Iti\u00e1-pura family in Madras, who materially helped Government in suppressing the rising of the Polygars in 1800, in Tamil; T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i Bandras in Urd\u00fa; the letters of '\u00c1lamg\u00edr in Persian; and the Memoirs of Dehli and Fyzabad in English, compiled from Persian sources,\u2014these are all the works in history of any importance which have been published during the period under review.\n\nEssays.\u2014A Collection of the Political Opinions of the late Sir T. Madhava Rao, in two parts, in English, is the only work on politics worth the name. Sir T. Madhava Rao was a sound thinker on religious, social and administrative matters, and his opinions have always exercised an immense influence on the educated natives of India. The literature of the Congress and of the Cow Protection movement is as copious as in previous years. We have works on the Cow Protection movement in almost every language. Even the Central Provinces, which publish next to nothing of importance, have issued an appeal for the protection of cows. The Consent Bill agitation has produced a very large number of pamphlets, many of which have not been received in the libraries as they were intended for private circulation only.\n\nThe Caste books are becoming more and more important. The Son\u00e1rs of Southern India claim descent from Vi\u00e9va Karman and call themselves Brahmans. They have published books both in Tamil and in\nMar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b. The pretentions of the Kayasthas of Bengal to a Kshatriya descent have been opposed by a Brahman in the work entitled Hath\u0101t Kshatriya. The publication of the Ball\u0101la Charita is significant. The Jogis and Sonar Baniyas of Bengal think that Ball\u0101l Sen degraded them, and so they have unearthed a Ball\u0101la Charita, which paints Ball\u0101l in the darkest colours possible. The Sennars or toddy dealers of Southern India have been cried down in a Tamil pamphlet.\n\nThe Arya Samaj people have been for years carrying on a controversy against the orthodox Hindus on the one hand, and against the Musalmans on the other, giving to the literature of the Panjab a life and vigour which are wanting in other provinces. No less than 15 pamphlets have been marked in one quarterly catalogue alone against the theory of the transmigration of the soul. The locusts have also absorbed a good deal of the attention of Panjabi writers. The immorality and dissolute lives of the Mahar\u00e1jas, or Abbots of the followers of Ballabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, have been exposed in a work entitled Pushtim\u00e1rga.\n\nTravels and Voyages are rarely undertaken by the great majority of the Indian people. Most of the works under this head treat of single journeys on business, from one part of India to another or from India to England. Paudit\u00e1 R\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed, however, is writing a large work, in parts, of her travels in England and America. A description of the journey undertaken by the Sh\u00e1h of Persia to England and France has appeared in Urdu. V\u00ed\u015bvagu\u1e47ad\u00e1rkana is the description of an imaginary journey in Sanskrit, which has been translated into Tamil for the benefit of the people of Southern India.\n\nPoetry and Religion.\u2014In the palmy days of Indian literature, when the Hind\u00fa mind retained its full vigour, the domains of poetry, philosophy and religion were kept distinct. But with the decadence of literature and the loss of independence, these three things began to be so blended together that it is impossible to separate them; as is the case with the medi\u00e6val poetry of India. The Premabhaktichandrik\u00e1 and the Smara\u1e47amangala, both in Beng\u00e1li, by two of the great leaders of the followers of Chaitanya, belong to this class of poetry. They comprise the poetry, philosophy and religion of Vaishnavism. The R\u00e1ma Ras\u00e1yana in Beng\u00e1li is also a work of this class. It shows, however, how the different sects in India derived their materials from the original Aryan and Brahmanic sources, and adapted them to their own use. As a Vaishnava work, the R\u00e1ma Ras\u00e1yana leaves out those incidents of R\u00e1ma's life which have any thing to do with S\u00e1kta or Saiva worship. Nalayira Divya-prabandham, called the Tamil Veda, in Tamil verse, is a large work in honour of Vishnu. It was written by the Vaishnav\u00e1 Alwars. There is a very noteworthy point of difference between the\nBengal and the Madras religious publications. While in Bengal the writers are concerned more with the spread of the worship of different superhuman beings like the Satyan\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Trid\u0101tha, Mangal\u0101ch\u0101rya and others, the Madras people are fond of writing short treatises in honour of the deities of different temples, such as the Vishnu of Tera Narayanpura, the \u015aiva and Durg\u0101 of Tera Mulainayal, the N\u0101\u1e6de\u015ba of the Chidambaram temple, and so on.\n\nJaina religious works in prose and verse are to be found in almost every province of India. The most remarkable production of the year is the Jayati Hu\u1e47\u1e0da Stotra, in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, by the great commentator Abhaya Deva \u015a\u016bri, who lived about 800 years ago. He discovered an image of Jina on the banks of a river, and consecrated it in Cambay. The work is in honour of this image. The Jaina S'at\u0101ka in Sanskrit by Bh\u016bd\u0101n D\u0101s, the Rasika Stavana Sangraha in Gujar\u0101ti, are also Jaina works of importance published during the year. Ch\u016bl\u0101mani is a rare classical poem of Jaina origin, published for the first time in Tamil. The Dincard is a very ancient work in Pahlavi. It has been published for the first time, though in a very mutilated form for want, apparently, of good texts, with an English and a Gujar\u0101ti translation. D\u0101r\u0101 Shiko, the eldest son of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, was a very enlightened prince. He was a follower of the Il\u0101h\u012b religion of his great-grandfather, and often held conversations on religious matters with professors of different religions, especially with Hind\u016b devotees. A dialogue between him and B\u0101b\u0101 L\u0101l D\u0101s, in Persian, has been translated into Urd\u016b. It is a work of the nature of the Milinda Pr\u0101\u015bna, between Menander and a Buddhist monk. The ex-R\u0101j\u0101 of Venkatagiri has written a remarkable work in Telugu, in which he discusses some of the most abstruse doctrines of religion. Books in support of the Brahmo movement have been received from all the southern presidencies.\n\nA collection of epigraphical songs by Tukar\u0101m, N\u0101ma Deva, Ekan\u0101tha, &c.; Kabir\u0101j Bhukhan's short poems on Shivaji and Chhatras\u0101l, the R\u0101j\u0101 of Panna; and a collection of ballads in three parts devoted to the glorification of the Satara R\u0101j family, the Peshwa family, and the Marhatta Sird\u0101rs, are publications of great value to the Marhatta people.\n\nAmong the serial publications of philological interest, B\u0101b\u016b Prat\u0101pa Chandra Raya's English translation of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is steadily approaching a conclusion. It has advanced to the S'\u0101nti Parvan. Pandit R\u0101man\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Tarkaratna is issuing regularly in parts some of the most important works on Chaitanyaism in Sanskrit and in Beng\u0101li. He is now engaged with the Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bita Mah\u0101k\u0101vy\u0101 and the Haribhaktivil\u0101sa. The Khargavil\u0101s Press of Bankipur has issued,\nunder the distinguished patronage of Mr. Grierson, a complete R\u00e1ma Chariit M\u00e1nas, commonly known as Tuls\u00ed Krita R\u00e1m\u00e1y\u00e1na. It has been edited from very ancient MSS. B\u00e1b\u00fa Barada Pr\u00e1sad Basu's revised edition of S'abdakalpadruma, with copious and valuable additions, has come up to the letter ya, and his edition of the Devibhagavat is making fair progress.\n\nThe Anand\u00e9rama series of Sanskrit works, published at Poona, has issued six important works\u2014S'ri S'ankaradigvijaya, with the commentary of Dhanapati S\u00fari and extracts from the commentary of Achyuta Rao Modak, the Rudr\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya, with the Bh\u00e1shyas of Sayana Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Bhaskara, three Upanishads with rare commentaries, and Vidy\u00e1-ranya Sw\u00e1min'a Jivana Mukti G\u00edt\u00e1. The K\u00e1vyam\u00e1l\u00e1 series, published at Bombay, contains a very large number of poetical pieces of all sizes in Sanskrit, written mostly before the Muhammedan conquest. The MSS. of these works were discovered by Messrs. B\u00fchl\u00e9r, Kielhorn, Bhandarkar, and Peterson in the various libraries of Western and North-Western India, both public and private, while in charge of the operations in search of Sanskrit manuscripts. The last number contains the Hara Vijaya by R\u00e1j\u00e1nka Ratn\u00e1kar, so well described in one of the Bombay Reports. The Pr\u00e1china K\u00e1vyam\u00e1l\u00e1 Grantha, published from Ahmedabad and Baroda, has issued twelve parts. It contains the works of Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed poets of great celebrity and popularity.\n\nWhile treating of the publications of philological value in Bombay, the labours of Colonel G. A. Jacob deserve prominent notice. He has worked hard for eight years in preparing a complete concordance of the principal Upanishads and the Bhagavat G\u00edt\u00e1, entitled Upanishad V\u00e1hya Kosha. The greatest activity in editing and publishing Sanskrit texts is to be found, as might be expected, in Benares, the centre of Hind\u00fa culture from the remotest period of Indian antiquity. The P\u00e1ndit, a monthly paper edited by the Pandits of the Benares Sanskrit College, continues to be published. It contains many rare works of great value. In the Benares Sanskrit series Messrs. Griffith and Thibaut are publishing a number of philosophical works; and in the Vijayanagaram series under the superintendence of Mr. Venis, who is now engaged in the publication of the Ny\u00e1ya Kandal\u00ed, written by a Beng\u00e1li Brahman in the 10th century of the Vikrama era, much valuable work is done.\n\nNor should I omit to mention the Ush\u00e1, edited by the venerable Pandit Satyavrata S\u00e1m\u00e1r\u00e1mi, who has done so much for Vedic Literature in India. The Ush\u00e1 is a Vedic journal, and it has already published a large number of small works bearing on the pronunciation, chanting and meaning of Vedic words.\nUnder this head we have a paper by Mr. C. H. Tawney, c. i. e., on some ancient Indian Methods of electing History, Ethnology, Kings, published in the Proceedings of November &c. 1891; and another by Mr. W. P. Driver on some interesting Kolarian tribes of Chutia Nagpur and the borders of Orissa, published in Part I of the Journal. There is also an interesting paper in the Journal by Dr. Waddell on \"Place and River Names in Sikhim,\" in which an account is given of the different ethnic elements of the population of this tract, and the etymology and meaning of names derived from different sources are determined.\n\nIn the Indian Antiquary we find papers by Mr. J. F. Fleet, c. i. e., on the Chronology of the Eastern Chalukya Kings, and on the computation of Hindu dates; by Major R. C. Temple, on the Burman system of arithmetic, a cumbrous system which, in a modified form, is still in vogue among Hindu astrologers all over India; by Professor Kielhorn, an examination of questions connected with the Vikrama era, and a paper on the Saptarshi era; and by Dr. Hoernle, two pattavalis of the Sarasvati Gachchha of the Digambara Jains,\u2014the first publication of a complete series of the Pontiffs of the Digambara section of the Jains. There is also a series of papers on Indian folk-lore, by G. F. D'Penha, Pandit Natesa Shastri and Putlibai D. H. Wadia. Professor B\u00fchler publishes a paper in Vol. V., Part 3, of the Vienna Oriental Journal, on the origin of the Gupta Vallabhi era, in which he proves, against Fleet, that the Gupta era is not a Nepalese but an Indian era, marking the epoch of the accession of Chandra Gupta I to imperial rule. The Journal of the German Oriental Society contains several papers of value on Indian Subjects.\n\nThe Tribes and Castes of Bengal, by H. H. Risley, c. i. e., c. s.; 4 volumes.\u2014This extensive work, consisting of 4 volumes, gives us the results of the ethnographic inquiry instituted by the Government of Bengal in the beginning of 1885. The inquiry was originally intended to extend to the whole of India, but ultimately it was not found possible to go beyond Bengal. Mr. Risley, who was placed in charge of the inquiry, has succeeded in these volumes in bringing together what appears to be an exhaustive account of Bengal with reference to the tribes and castes inhabiting it. In the first two volumes he gives an enumeration and description of them in alphabetical order in the form of a glossary. In the last two are put together the tables of anthropometric data, on which Mr. Risley's ethnographic generalisations are based. These he sets out in the introduction to the first volume, and they form not the least important or interesting part of his work. The conclusions at which he arrives are briefly these: The whole of India is inhabited by a\nlong-headed (dolichocephalic) race; the broad-headed (brachycephalic) race occurs only along the northern and eastern borders of Bengal, and can hardly be deemed Indian at all. In the long-headed race, however, two extreme forms can be distinguished; one (the Aryan) has a straight, finely-cut nose, a long, narrow face, a well developed forehead, regular features, high facial angle, and fairly high stature; the other (the Dravidian) has a thick broad nose, low facial angle, thick lips, wide and fleshy face, coarse and irregular features, rather low stature, squat figure and sturdy limbs. Between these two extreme types a large number of intermediate groups can be distinguished, each of which forms for matrimonial purposes a sharply defined circle, commonly known as a caste, beyond which none of its members can pass. If these groups are arranged in the order of their average nasal index, or the formula indicating the proportion of the length of the nose to its breadth, so that the caste with the finest nose shall be at the top, and that with the coarsest at the bottom of the list, it is found that this order substantially corresponds with the accepted order of social precedence. Thus Mr. Risley arrives at the curious result, that it may be laid down as a \"law of caste organisation in Eastern India, that a man's social status varies in inverse ratio to the width of his nose.\" Whether the two extreme types really represent two distinct races, as Mr. Risley is disposed to believe, or whether they do not rather represent the two extreme points of differentiation of the same race under differing conditions, is a question which may be considered open to further research. Mr. Risley's volumes are published as a preliminary edition in order to invite criticism with the object of supplying omissions and correcting mistakes. We may hope that their accomplished author will soon be enabled to give us the second edition of his valuable work in its final form.\n\nVedic Mythology by Prof. A. Hillebrandt of Breslau. 1st volume: Soma and Cognate Deities.\" (In German).\u2014The author of this excellent book will be well-known to many members of our Society as the editor of the Sankhayana Sruta Sutra in the Bibliotheca Indica. He has made the study of the Vedas his speciality, and in the present work he has given us not the least important results of his researches. The question of the identity and the name of the famous Soma plant has been long discussed, and still remains undecided. It will be remembered that at the time of the Afghan Boundary Commission, the naturalist who accompanied it was instructed to make inquiries on the subject. These inquiries would perhaps have been more fruitful, if it had been possible to place in his hands a brief abstract from Sanskrit authors of all notices of the Soma plant occurring in them, leaving his mind unbiassed by\nany theories. This want has now been supplied by Prof. Hillebrandt, and it should be a great help in any future practical inquiries. Unfortunately it now turns out that the oldest sources, the Vedas, afford very little definite information; but they show that the Soma was not the flower (hops) or fruit (grapes) of any plant, as some great authorities have thought, but young light-coloured shoots of a plant growing in mountainous places, whence they used to be brought down by traders and sold to the priests for their sacrifices. For the latter purpose four small and deep holes were dug in the ground, forming a small square; over these two wooden boards were laid to serve as \"sounding boards;\" over the boards a red skin was spread, the hairy side uppermost; on this skin the stones were laid with which the juice of the Soma shoots was expressed by pounding. Sometimes a mortar and pestle were used instead of the stones. The juice thus extracted was mixed with water in a large vessel, whence it was afterwards poured into smaller vessels and mixed with milk or liquor. For libation and consumption cups were used. In the second part of his work, Prof. Hillebrandt treats of the mythological transformation of Soma and its cult.\n\nThe Computation of Hindu Dates in Inscriptions, with General and Special Tables. By Professor H. Jacobi.\u2014The substance of this work was originally published in the Indian Antiquary. It is now republished, enlarged and revised, as a part of the Epigraphia Indica. The verification of Hindu dates is an intricate business. It is beset with difficulties of two kinds: one is caused by the strictly astronomical basis of the calendar; the other is due to the intricacy of the calendar system, which is further enhanced by the variety of usages adopted in different parts of India as regards some of the elements. Professor Jacobi's work is a very successful attempt to reduce these difficulties to a minimum, and to all students of the epigraphical records of India, so many of which are dated, it is a most welcome contribution.\n\nThe Badoej's, by Dr. Jul. Jacobs and J. J. Meijer. (In Dutch).\u2014This book gives an interesting account of a small and very little known community of people living in the wilds of the western part of Java,\u2014the \"Badoej's,\" as Dr. Jacobs spells their name. They are of particular interest to India, as representing probably a survival of Indian Buddhism. Owing to the strict seclusion in which they maintain themselves, very little has hitherto been known about them. Dr. Jacobs, as Sanitary Officer of the Dutch East Indian Legion, had special facilities of intercourse with them; and his book gives us the first trustworthy information on the religion, manners and customs of this interesting little people. The Badoejs are said to have retired into the wilds of Western Java on the conquest of their country by the Muhammadans under\nMaulana Hasanuddin, in the early part of the 16th century. The principal names of the Hindu pantheon are still familiar to them.\n\nIt is in the department of Archaeology and Epigraphy that the greatest activity is found. The *Epigraphia Indica* is wholly, and the *Indian Antiquary* almost wholly devoted to it; and numerous papers on these subjects appear in the Journals of all Asiatic Societies. Mr. Fleet, Professor Kielhorn, Dr. Hultzsch, and Professor B\u00fchler have published readings of numerous copperplate grants and other inscriptions in the *Indian Antiquary* and the *Epigraphia Indica*. Amongst the papers deserving of special mention are the following:\n\n(1) Prof. B\u00fchler's papers in the *Epigraphia Indica* on \"New Jaina Inscriptions from Mathura.\" These inscriptions have all been recently dug up by Dr. F\u00fchrer of the Archaeological Survey. They are of very high importance as affording genuine contemporary evidence of the Jaina traditions.\n\n(2) Prof. B\u00fchler has also contributed to the *Vienna Oriental Journal* a paper on 'Indian Inscriptions to be read from below.' Dr. Hultzsch was the first to prove the existence of this curious class of inscriptions. Prof. B\u00fchler shows that some hitherto unintelligible inscriptions make sense if read in this way.\n\n(3) The same authority publishes Contributions to the Explanation of the Asoka Inscriptions, in the *Indian Antiquary* and in the *Journal of the German Oriental Society*.\n\n(4) Prof. Kielhorn has a paper on \"Sanskrit Plays, partly preserved as Inscriptions at Ajmere,\" in the *Indian Antiquary* for June 1891. These are two unique inscriptions of very great interest, inasmuch as they preserve portions of two hitherto unknown dramas, and afford actual proof of the fact that Hindu kings composed poetry. One of the dramas is a composition of Vigraha Raja Deva, a Chohan Prince of the 12th century A.D.\n\n(5) M. Etienne Aymonier publishes in the *Journal Asiatique* of the French Asiatic Society, a Study of the Chame Inscriptions in the vulgar language of the ancient kingdom of Champa in Further India (Annam). They date from the beginning of the 9th century A.D. onwards.\n\nOne of the most useful publications of the year is Dr. A. F\u00fchrer's report on \"The Monumental Antiquities and Inscriptions in the N.W. Provinces and Oudh, described and arranged.\" This is a goodly volume, 425 pages quarto, published by the Archaeological Survey of India. The information in it was partly collected by Dr. F\u00fchrer himself, partly reprinted by him from different Oriental scientific journals, such as the\nJournals of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain, the Indian Antiquary, &c., It serves the useful object not only of putting on record a complete list, so far as they are known, of the antiquities and epigraphs of each district, but also of furnishing general information for the guidance of those who may have the wish and the leisure to interest themselves in the character and history of the places in which they live.\n\nTransfer of the Behar Collection of Buddhist remains to the Indian Museum.\u2014A very important collection of Buddhist and other Indian remains was made some years ago by Mr. Broadley, then subdivisional officer of Behar in the district of Patna. This is the country, formerly known as Magadha, in which the Buddha lived and preached, and which is associated in the closest way with the origins of Buddhism. A suggestion having been made that the collection should be transferred to Bodh Gaya, the Trustees of the Indian Museum appointed a Committee to consider the question. The Committee in the first instance deputed Babu Purna Chandra Mukharjea, an archaeologist who had been recommended to their notice, to proceed to Behar and make a catalogue and descriptive list of the objects forming the collection. From his report it was abundantly manifest, in the first place, that the collection, the Buddhistic portion of which Dr. Burgess had described as the largest in India, was of rare interest and value to the historical student; and in the second, that it was exposed to serious risk from neglect and mischief, from the action of the weather, and from depredations, which had already wrought deplorable havoc. The Committee therefore strongly recommended that the collection should be preserved from further injury by being transferred to the Indian Museum. On a representation being made to him, Sir Charles Elliott, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, generously promised a grant of Rs. 5,000, partly to defray the cost of transporting the collection to Calcutta, and setting it up in the Museum, and partly to provide for the prosecution of further researches by Babu P. C. Mukharjea at Rajgir and Baragaon, two places in the neighbourhood, which are no other, if Genl. Cunningham's identification be accepted, than R\u0101jag\u1e5bha and N\u0101land\u0101, so well-known in connexion with the history of Gautama Buddha. The Babu's report showed how full these places were of remains of the highest interest, what damage had been done to them by the action of the climate and of men, and how desirable it was both to preserve permanent records of them, and to keep them from further decay. It is a matter of congratulation that, thanks to the liberality of the Lieutenant-Governor, this valuable collection of over 600 sculptures, Buddhistic and Brahmanical, is now safely housed in the Indian Museum, where it is not only secure from\nfurther loss and injury, but is made permanently accessible to the student of archaeology and of the history of religions. A full catalogue of the collection will be prepared as soon as Babu P. C. Mukharjea returns from his present tour.\n\nSite of the Black Hole of Calcutta.\u2014During the year 1891 a considerable advance has been made towards accurately determining the topography of Old Fort William, Calcutta, the result of which has been to disturb the accepted views regarding the site of the Black Hole. Reports of these investigations have appeared from time to time in the daily papers; but it seems desirable to give a permanent place in the Proceedings of this Society to a short account of a discovery which we owe to the energy of our Philological Secretary, Mr. C. R. Wilson, to whose kindness I am indebted for the following notes.\n\nThe first attempts in this direction were made nine years ago by Mr. R. R. Bayne, a member of the Asiatic Society, who discovered nearly all the foundation walls of the northern portion of the Fort, during the erection of the East India Railway Offices in Clive Street. In February 1883, Mr. Bayne laid before the Asiatic Society the results of his investigations. Unfortunately they suffered under two disadvantages. In the first place, the portions of the old building actually excavated were on the northern and least interesting side of the fort. In the second place, Mr. Bayne had no proper plan to guide him in his conjectures as to the position and nature of the remaining portions of the fort. The investigations of 1891 have been carried on under far more favourable conditions. Availing himself of the opportunity afforded him by the erection of the New Government Offices in Dalhousie Square, Mr. Wilson has succeeded in discovering considerable remains of the buildings on the south side of the Fort, where the Black Hole and other places of interest were situated; and he has had the advantage of being guided in his excavations by a detailed plan of Fort William in 1753, a photographed copy of which was presented to the Asiatic Society by Mr. T. R. Munro. The results of these investigations have been so successful that it has been found possible to draw up a plan of the Old Fort, accurately showing its position with reference to the modern houses now standing on or near its site, together with the main features of its principal buildings. Mr. Wilson's investigations began with the discovery of the true dimensions and position of the east gate of the Fort. The gate was found to be much smaller than Mr. Bayne had conjectured it would be. Its centre lies on the central line of the road in front of Writers' Buildings, which has always been one of the principal streets of the city. In the next place Mr. Wilson has traced out, as far as was possible, the main features of the factory within\nthe Fort, in which were situated the apartments of the Governor. This was in its day one of the finest English houses in India. It consisted of a main building facing the river, with two wings behind at right angles to the main building. Almost all the foundation walls of these wings have been traced out by excavations, and the position of the walls of the main building has been ascertained, although the walls themselves could not be traced out, as the site of the main building is at present occupied by the Government Opium godowns and by the out-houses of the Custom House. Besides this, Mr. Wilson has endeavoured as far as possible to ascertain the positions of the south curtain, of the south-east bastion, and of that portion of the east curtain which lay between the south-east bastion and the east gate, together with the adjoining arcades and chambers. Considerable difficulty has been experienced in coming to any definite conclusion on these points; for, in the first place, the Post Office covers the site of the south-east bastion and the adjacent south curtain wall, and so prevents any extended excavations in this region; and in the second place, the plan of the old Fort which has elsewhere proved to be extremely accurate, seems at this point to fail. Still, in spite of these difficulties, Mr. Wilson has been able to definitely fix the position of the south curtain wall and of the three parallel lines of arches within it, and to show that tradition was right in asserting that the old arcade and arches which still stand in the Post Office compound were part of the old Fort. The arches of the south face of this arcade are what remains of the first line of arches within the south curtain, and the arches in the middle of the arcade are what remain of the second line of arches. The foundation wall of the third and innermost line of arches has been traced out for some distance. It was found in the passage on the north of the Post Office. Starting from this wall, or, what is practically the same thing, from the north face of the Post Office, Mr. Wilson has traced out the east curtain wall as far as the east gate, the inner wall containing the chambers built against the curtain, and the wall of the piazza or verandah running west of the chambers. The Black Hole prison was one of these chambers; but to fix its exact position it is necessary to ascertain, not merely the positions of the curtain wall and the inner wall, which formed its eastern and western walls, but also the position of the cross-walls which formed its northern and southern boundaries, and divided it off from the other chambers built against the east curtain. Unfortunately these cross-walls were run up with hardly any foundation, and hence it is extremely difficult to trace their position. One such cross-wall has been found at a distance of about 100 ft. from the centre of the east gate, and to the south of this there is another cross-wall which Mr. Bayne discovered in 1883, and\nwhich according to his theories must have been the north wall of the prison. According to Mr. Wilson this cannot have been the case; because the space south of this cross-wall is shown by the plan of the Fort to have been occupied by the foot of the staircase leading to the south-east bastion. On the other hand Mr. Wilson thinks it quite possible that this wall is the south wall of the prison. Mr. Wilson, however, still hopes to gain additional information concerning this and other points in the topography of the Fort by further excavations and by the examination of old records.\n\nDiscovery of the Bower MS.\u2014I will now draw attention to the great event that has marked the history of the year, in the discovery in Kashgaria of the Bower MS., so called by Dr. Hoernle after Lt. Bower, who found and brought it to India. Of the history of this discovery we have the following account by Lt. Bower. The MS., which is written on birch-bark, \"had been dug out of the foot of one of the curious old erections just outside a subterranean city near Kuchar.\" These erections are described as being \"generally about 50 or 60 feet high, in shape like a huge cottage-loaf; built solid of sun-dried bricks with layers of beams now crumbling away.\" Dr. Hoernle reasonably conjectures that these erections are Buddhist st\u016bpas. Such st\u016bpas, he observes, often contain a chamber enclosing relics and other objects; these chambers are generally near the level of the ground, and are often dug into by persons in search of hidden treasure. From such a practically air-tight chamber, Dr. Hoernle thinks, this MS. was probably dug out, perhaps not long before it came into Lt. Bower's possession; and there is no reason why a birch-bark MS., thus preserved from the chances of injury, should not endure for any length of time.\n\nThe MS. was sent by Lt. Bower to Col. Waterhouse, who exhibited it at the meeting of the Society in November 1890, but it could not then be deciphered. An account of its acquisition by the finder, together with facsimile reproductions of two leaves of the MS., appeared in the Proceedings for that month. On Dr. Hoernle's return to India in March 1891, the MS. passed into his hands; and in the Proceedings for April Dr. Hoernle gave a preliminary account of the MS., which he had then ascertained to be written in Sanskrit of a very archaic type. The detailed description of the MS. was published in No. II of Part I of the Journal for 1891. In that paper Dr. Hoernle minutely analysed the forms of the letters occurring in the MS.; and by a chain of arguments, the strength and lucidity of which are such as to compel the assent of every reader, proved that the MS. was written not in the S\u0101rada character of Kashmir, as had been previously conjectured, but in the Gupta character, a much earlier form; that separate portions of it were written by\ndifferent scribes and at different dates; and that the latest portion must be ascribed to a date not later than the second half of the 5th century, or say 475 A.D., while the earlier portion must be referred to a date half a century earlier. The Bower MS. is therefore the oldest Indian MS. yet discovered, and one of the oldest MSS. existing in the world.\n\nAs to its subject matter, the MS. is composed of five distinct portions, of which the first and fifth are medical works, the latter merely a fragment. The second and fourth are collections of proverbial sayings; and the third contains the story of a charm against snake-bite, given by Buddha to Ananda while he was staying in Jetavana. The following translation of the introductory lines of the first portion will be interesting:\u2014\"Salutation to the Tath\u0101gatas. I am going to write an approved compendium (of medicine) called the N\u0101vanitaka, based on the excellent system of the Mah\u0101rshis as composed by them in olden times. Whatever is useful to men and women afflicted with various diseases; whatever is also useful for children, that will all be declared in this book. It will command itself to those physicians whose minds delight in conciseness; but on account of the multiplicity of its prescriptions, it will also be welcome to those whose minds love many details.\" After enumerating the contents of the several chapters (16), the preface concludes,\u2014\u201cIt should not be given to any one who has no son, nor to any one who has no brother; nor should it be taught to any one who has no disciple.\u201d\n\nDr. Hoernle has now transcribed nearly the whole of the MS., which consists of 55 leaves, and has translated a large portion of it. In the forthcoming 3rd number of the Journal, he will publish \u201cAn Instalment of the Bower MS.\u201d giving the text, and an English translation (with notes) of its 5th portion, consisting of five leaves and containing a fragment of a medical work. He has succeeded in tracing some of the prescriptions given in the MS. to the Su\u0101ruts, Chakradatta, and Vangasena\u2014medical works still current. Some of the prescriptions are verbally identical.\n\nDr. Hoernle\u2019s estimate of the age of the MS. is confirmed in a striking manner by Dr. B\u00fchler of Vienna, who, examining the question by the light of the account and the facsimile plates published in the Proceedings of November 1890, came independently to the same conclusion as to its date. In the account which Dr. B\u00fchler published in the July number of the Vienna Oriental Journal, he writes as follows:\n\n\u201cI trust that Dr. Hoernle, the able and learned Secretary of the Society, will take the volume in hand and give us a full account of its contents. If the Society wishes to render a real and great service to the students of Indian Palaeography, it will publish photo-etchings of the whole volume. Every line of the MS. is of the highest importance.\u201d\nIt would, however, have been beyond the means of the Society to carry out the work on so elaborate a scale; and when this fact was represented to the Government of Bengal, and subsequently to the Government of India, these two Governments, by a joint arrangement, very readily and liberally agreed to render the necessary assistance for the editing and publication of the MS. The Society will be glad to learn that the Government of Bengal has relieved Dr. Hoernle of his other duties during the whole time necessary for the completion of the work, while the Government of India has undertaken to defray the considerable expenses connected with the publication, including photographic facsimiles of every page of the MS. For these services to scholarship, the cordial thanks of the Society and of all interested in the progress of Oriental research are due to the Governments concerned.\n\n[Since the foregoing was sent to Press, Dr. Hoernle informs me that he has received a further communication on the subject of the date of the MS. from Professor B\u00fchler, who now intimates that he is inclined to assign to the MS. an even higher antiquity than that already assigned to it, possibly by 50 or 100 years. Indeed, Dr. Hoernle himself has independently come to the conclusion, since writing his paper of November 1891, that no part of the MS. can probably be dated later than the first half of the 5th century. Dr. B\u00fchler, I may add, in a second paper published in the Vienna Oriental Journal, recommends Dr. Hoernle's \"able and elaborate argumentation\" to all Indian epigraphists for most careful study, and describes it as \"by far the most important contribution to Indian epigraphy which has appeared of late.\"]\n\nI may begin my remarks under this head with the following extract from the Preface to an elaborate report on the progress of Numismatics in India from 1886 to 1891, which was presented by Mr. Vincent Smith to the recent Congress of Orientalists. This preface is republished in the Academy of October 31st, 1891. After giving a very interesting description of the eleven classes into which he divides Indian coins, with an account of the chief discoveries under each, in which he quotes largely from the Proceedings of this Society, Mr. Smith proceeds:\n\n\"I shall conclude by calling special attention to the disinterested labours of Dr. Hoernle, much of whose valuable time is taken up by the examination of the thousands of coins which are poured in upon him from all quarters. In his address for 1889, the President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal records the fact that during the previous year Dr. Hoernle had examined and reported upon more than 4,000 coins, of which vast number 2,460 were noted in the Proceedings. In 1887 the same indefatigable worker examined more than 3,200 coins.\"\nDr. Hoernle informs me that he has examined and reported on about 2,000 coins since his return to India in March 1891, though only one among them required particular notice, namely, the very rare gold Gupta coin of the \"Couch\" type, noticed below. Nearly all were sent to him under the Treasure Trove Act.\n\nMr. J. Rodgers' private collection, containing upwards of 8,000 coins, has been purchased by the Punjab Government for the Lahore Museum,\u2014a great acquisition. Duplicates will probably be supplied to other Museums. Its special feature is the collection of Indian Moghul coins, which is almost exhaustive.\n\nMr. Rivett-Carnac's valuable collection will probably, it is understood, be purchased by the Government of India for the Indian Museum. The special feature of this collection is the series of gold Gupta coins, which is unequalled in quantity and quality, containing upwards of 100 specimens, some unique and most of them rare; e.g., the gold coin of the \"Couch\" type of Chandra Gupta II, an account of which by Dr. Hoernle was published in our Proceedings for August.\n\nAn important find of Roman coins was made near Bangalore in the course of the year. They number 163, all silver denarii of ten types, belonging to the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Antonia, mostly of the two first-named. All are of known types. A report on these coins has been given by Mr. Rice in the Records of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, to which specimens of the coins of Augustus and Tiberius have been presented by the Mysore Government.\n\nThe following work recently published by an Honorary Member of our Society deserves prominent notice:\n\nCoins of Ancient India from the earliest Times down to the Seventh Century, A.D.\u2014By Major-General Sir A. Cunningham, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., R.E.\n\nThis is a most welcome contribution from the greatest living authority on Indian numismatics; all the more so, as it treats of the more obscure classes of the ancient Indian coinage. The well-known and generally well-preserved coins of the Satraps of Surashtra, and of the Gupta kings of Magadha, have been fully described in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, the former by the late Pandit Bhagwan Lal Indraji, the latter by Mr. V. Smith. But no one seemed to feel equal to the task of bringing together and classifying the numerous smaller classes of silver and copper coins, the ascription of which was obscure, and many of which were in a very indifferent state of preservation, Sir A. Cunningham alone possessed the requisite knowledge and experience; and the long-expected work from his pen will, therefore, be most gratefully welcomed by all numismatists. It first explains,\nin an introduction, the origin of Indian coinage, and its relation to that of Assyria, Babylonia, Phoenicia and Greece. It then describes successively the so-called punch-coins, which may be as old as 600 B.C., and the coins of Taxila, Odumbara, Kuninda, Kosambi, Yaudheya, Panchala, Mathura, Ayodhya, Ujain, Eran, the Andhras of South India, and Nepal. These descriptions are illustrated by 13 plates and a map. It may be added, that the learned author promises to publish a second volume, which will describe the coins of medi\u00e6val India, from 600 A.D. down to the Muhammadan conquest.\n\nMr. E. J. Rapson contributed \"Notes on Gupta Coins\" to the Numismatic Chronicle, Part I, for 1891. The paper gives some additions to Mr. V. A. Smith's standard work on the subject. The Indian Antiquary for September 1891 contained a paper by Dr. E. Hultzsch on the \"Coins of the Kings of Vijayanagar,\" being the first attempt to give a complete list and description of these coins.\n\nI now turn to that department of your work which deals with the Natural Sciences. Of Part II of the Society's Journal, which is reserved for papers on these subjects, three parts have already appeared during the past year, and the volume will be completed by part 4, which is now in the press and will shortly appear with the index and title-page for 1891.\n\nIn reviewing the Zoological work done during the year 1891, I have thought it sufficient to confine my observations to purely Indian communications, either from members of this Society throughout the country, or from others working in the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.\n\nThere is no longer much scope for original work among mammals, and I have only to notice the issue of a carefully compiled Catalogue of Mammalia in the Indian Museum, by Mr. W. L. Sclater, M.A., F.Z.S. This catalogue includes the orders from Rodentia to Monotremata, and is really the second part of a catalogue commenced by Dr. Anderson and issued in 1881. Mr. Sclater has further drawn up and published a List of the Snakes in the Indian Museum, and has also contributed to the Society's Journal a short but valuable paper, accompanied by a plate, on the Snakes in the Indian Museum. Five new species were described, viz.:\u2014Ablabes Stoliczka, Simotes Wood-Masoni, Zaocys Tenasserimensis, Tropidonotus Pealii, and T. nicobarensis.\n\nIn the January number of the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Mr. J. Wood-Mason and Dr. A. Alcock published the first part of a most interesting and useful paper on the results of the deep-sea dredgings made by the officers of H.M. Indian Marine Survey Steamer \"Investigator\" during the season 1889-90. The materials dealt with\nwere collected in depths ranging from 90 to 1439 fathoms, and, in the paper referred to, were arranged in catalogue form, but no systematic details were given except in the case of Fishes and Crustaceans. In the order Madreporia Dr. Alcock named and described three new corals; two, Caryophyllia ephyala and Stephanotrochus nitens, taken by the collectors on the \"Investigator,\" and one, Rhisotrochus Worsleyi, presented to the Indian Museum by Captain Worsley. The type specimen of Stephanotrochus nitens is a very fine one. A complete list of 35 deep-sea fishes collected during that season is given, and includes 24 new species. Of the other classes noted in this part of the paper, it must be mentioned that the deep-sea Holothurians were worked out, named, and described by Dr. J. H. Tull Walsh, who published the results of his investigations in the Journal of our Society, Part II, No. 2. Dr. Walsh has described all the deep-sea forms obtained from 1887 to 1891, and notes two new genera and seven new species. In connexion with the study of Holothurians, I would draw attention to a valuable translation of a paper by Dr. Hubert Ludwig on the development of these creatures, which appeared in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for December 1891. In the February issue of the above-mentioned Journal another portion of the paper by Mr. Wood-Mason and Dr. Alcock appeared, and this is chiefly noteworthy on account of the new species of Crustaceans described by Mr. Wood-Mason, and for the very good original drawing of Nephropsis Atlantica & Norm. which it contains. The March number contained a further instalment of notes on Crustaceans by Mr. Wood-Mason, the most interesting and important of these being the full and clear description of a new crab, Parilia Alcocki.\n\nTo the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for July, August, October, November and December, Mr. Wood-Mason and Dr. Alcock contributed a series of papers showing the results of the \"Investigator\" deep-sea dredgings during the season 1890\u201391; and in the issues for July and August Dr. Alcock described fully many new bathybial fishes. In the October and November numbers Mr. Wood-Mason contributes further to the literature of the Crustacea, and finally in the December number Dr. Alcock describes certain new star-fishes. These two authors have also conjointly contributed a most important paper to the Proceedings of the Royal Society, \"On the Uterine Villiform Papillae of Pteroplatea micrura and their relation to the Embryo, being Natural History Notes from H. M. Indian Marine Survey Steamer 'Investigator,' Commander R. F. Hoskyn, R. N., Commanding, No. 22.\" To these nutrient villi, which are found in certain selachian uteri, the authors have given the name of trophenemata, at once suggesting the part they play in relation to the embryo, which is practically suckled in utero. I will com-\nplete this rough sketch of Dr. Alocok's work during 1891 by referring to a paper contributed by him in March to the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, \"On a Viviparous Bathypial Fish from the Bay of Bengal, Saccogaster maculata,\" in which the embryo is developed while still in the oviduct. The male of this species is provided with a distinct copulatory organ, but there does not appear to be any special modification of the oviduct in the female.\n\nIn the December Bulletin of the Microscopical Society of Calcutta, I find an interesting paper by Mr. Wood-Mason on Olathulina elegans, Cienk., a pretty Protozoan, a specimen of which was discovered in the General's Tank by Mr. W. J Simmons, an active member of the Microscopical Society.\n\nOutside this Presidency Mr. Alfred Gibbs Bourne, lecturer on biology in the Madras University, has done some good work during the past year, contributing papers to the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science on Naidiform Oligochaeta; on Megascolex ceruleus, Templ., found in Ceylon; and on Pelomyza viridis, a new species of Rhizopod discovered in a tank near the Presidency College, Madras. Of Mr. Bourne's papers the most important one is that on the Naidiform Oligochaeta.\n\nThe file of the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society shows that its members have not been idle during 1891. Lieut. Barinos, F. Z. S., continues his notes on \"Nesting in Western India,\" and his letterpress is accompanied by very trustworthy coloured drawings of most of the eggs collected. Mr. A. W. Morris, F. Z. S., contributes to the Journal an interesting paper on \"Abnormal Horns of the Indian Antelope,\" with a plate.\n\nTurning to another branch of Natural Science I must not forget to mention that Col. Waterhouse has been continuing his observations on electro-chemical reversals of photographic plates with Thio-carbomides, and has published notes in the Proceedings of this Society and in the Journal of the Photographic Society of India.\n\nThe fascinating study of Indian Entomology has attracted a large number of workers during the past year, and several interesting communications upon the subject have been read before this Society.\n\nAmong the publications of the year may be noticed:\n\n(1.) Mr. Hampson's elaborate monograph on the moths of the Nilgiris, published by the Trustees of the British Museum. In this work Mr. Hampson describes and figures about three hundred new species, the classification being chiefly based upon the Indian Museum Catalogue of Moths. The figures are coloured, and the work will be a most valuable aid in the identification of species.\n(2.) Part IV of Mr. Distant's monograph on Oriental Cicadidae, published by order of the Trustees of the Indian Museum. This part, which comprises about 42 species and is beautifully illustrated, brings the work down to the genus Cicada, which is the last in the family; it may therefore be hoped that the monograph will soon be completed. The Cicadidae are a small group of insects which attract some attention in India on account of the species which sing so lustily in the still air of the Himalayas.\n\n(3.) The second part of Mr. Wood-Mason's Catalogue of Mantodea, published by order of the Trustees of the Indian Museum. This part, which is illustrated with two excellent plates, deals with nineteen species of Mantodea from different parts of the world. It includes descriptions of two new species from the Indian region.\n\n(4.) Parts 4 to 7 of Mr. Moore's extensive work on the Lepidoptera of India. The seven parts of this book that have appeared deal altogether with 78 species of Euplocinae; and the scope of the undertaking may be gathered from the fact that, on the present scale, something like 800 quarto plates and 2000 pages of letterpress of corresponding size will be required for the description of the butterflies alone.\n\n(5.) Mr. Watson's Hesperidae Indica (Vest and Co., Madras). This is a useful compilation of descriptions of Indian Hesperidae, which have hitherto been scattered over a number of more or less inaccessible publications.\n\nNumerous papers and reports on Indian Entomology have, as usual, appeared in the serials of the past year.\n\nIn the Journal of this Society, Dr. J. H. Tull Walsh gives an interesting account of some spiders which mimic ants. Mr. Doherty describes a number of new and rare Indian Lycaenidae, besides contributing some valuable notes on the butterflies of the little known islands of Engano, Sumba, and Sumbawa in the Malay Archipelago. Mons. Bigot contributes the first part of his Catalogue of the Diptera of the Oriental Region, and the Rev. A. E. Eaton furnishes a paper on the Ephemeridae of the Indian Museum.\n\nIn the Scientific Memoirs by Medical Officers of the Army of India, Dr. J. H. Tull Walsh writes on the habits of certain harvesting ants which he found at work both at Pooree and on the Maidan in Calcutta.\n\nIn Indian Museum Notes, Lord Walsingham describes a new species of Tineidae which attacks tea in Ceylon; Mons. Bigot describes a new fly which attacks melons in Baluchistan; Mr. Maskell describes some new species of Coccidae which attack tea and other plants; Mr. Moore and Mr. G. C. Dudgeon write on a new Psychid which attacks the Sal tree in the Darjeeling district; Mr. Cotes gives a number of notes on\ninsects sent to the Indian Museum as destructive to crops, with descriptions of new species by Messrs. Moore, Buckton and Kerremans. In the same periodical also appear reports by Mr. Cotes on the Wild Silk Insects of India, on White Insect Wax in India, and on the Locusts of Bengal, Madras, Assam and Bombay; also a paper by the late Mr. E. T. Atkinson on American blight.\n\nIn the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, Mr. Watson writes on some butterflies of the Chin Lushai Hills; Mr. Betham on the butterflies of the Central Provinces; and Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville on new and little known butterflies from the Indo-Malayan region. Brief entomological notes also appear by Captain Sage and Mr. Wroughton, besides a reprint of a report by Mr. Cotes on the Locust of North-Western India, which was out of print.\n\nIn the Transactions of the Entomological Society of London, Colonel Swinhoe describes a number of new species of moths from South India. Mr. Snellen gives a Catalogue of the Pyralidina of Sikkim, and Professor Westwood describes an aphid which infests bread-fruit trees in Ceylon.\n\nIn the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, Mr. Kirby describes several new species of dragon-flies from Ceylon, and Mr. Elwes discusses the butterflies collected by Mr. W. Doherty in the Naga and Karen Hills and in Perak.\n\nIn the Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Mr. Kirby gives a revision of the Forficulidae, and amongst others, he describes some new species from India and Ceylon.\n\nIn the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Mr. Gahan describes five new species of Longicorn Coleoptera and three new Galerucidae; Mr. Waterhouse describes five new species of Scarabaeidae; and Mr. Warren three new species of Pyralidae; all from the Indian region.\n\nIn the Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Entomologique de Belgique are a series of papers on the Coleoptera collected by Mons. Cardon, Missionary in Chota Nagpore. Of these Coleoptera, the Buprestidae are described by Mons. Kerremans, the Tricentotomidae and Cerambycidae by Mons. Lameere, the Haliphiidae, Dytiscidae and Gyrinidae by Mons. Severin, the Cicindelidae by Mons. Fleutiaux, and the Elateridae by Mons. Cand\u00e8ze. Mons. Forel also describes some new species of Indian ants; Mons. Kerremans writes on a Buprestid from the Indian Museum collection, and Mons. Haylaerts describes some new Indian Psychidae.\n\nIn the Memoirs and Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, Mr. Cameron describes a number of minute Hymenoptera, some of them from the Indian Museum collections.\n\nThe contribution to Indian Botany during the year under review\nBotany.\n\nthat possesses the greatest general biological interest is a striking paper by the late Dr. A. Barclay On the Life-history of a remarkable Uredine (Uromyces Cunninghamianus) published in the Transactions of the Linnean Society, Vol. 3. Hardly less interesting is a noteworthy paper by Dr. D. D. Cunningham, F. R. S., On some species of Choleraic Comma-Bacilli occurring in Calcutta, published in Scientific Memoirs by Medical Officers of the Army of India, Part vi. This latter periodical contains two papers on cryptogamic botany by Dr. Barclay\u2014on Two Autecious Caomata in Simla, and on Rhododendron Uredinea.\n\nThe most important contributions to Indian Systematic Botany have been the completion of Sir Joseph Hooker's masterly account of the Indian Orchidaceae, in Part xvii (the opening portion of Vol. vi) of the Flora of British India; and revisions by Dr. G. King, c. i. e., f. r. s., of great economic as well as systematic value, of the Indian Magnoliaceae and of the Indian and Malayan species of Myristica, both contained in Annals of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, Vol. 3, which has been issued during the year. In the Society's Journal Dr. King has also continued his Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula, a systematic work of the highest value. The part last published (No. 3) contains description of the species of Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae and Tiliaceae. A valuable contribution to systematic botany during the year has been an account, by Dr. D. Prain, of the genus Gomphostemma in Annals of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, Vol. 3. Dr. Prain has also contributed to the Society's Journal, Part II, descriptions of a species of Nepeta and of two species of Glyptopetalum. Sir D. Brandis has noted in the Indian Forester (Oct. 1891) the existence in Burma of a new species of Terminalia; and Mr. H. N. Ridley has described four new orchids in the Journal of the Linnean Society.\n\nThe most important contribution to Indian Phyto-geography during the year has been A Sketch of the Vegetation of British Baluchistan, with Descriptions of New Species, by Mr. J. H. Laco, of the Indian Forest Department, assisted by Mr. W. B. Hemsley, of the Kew Herbarium. Dr. Prain has contributed a paper to the Society's Journal, Part II, on The Vegetation of the Coco Group, and has also published in the Society's Proceedings (Dec. 1891) an account of a botanical visit to Little Andaman and the Nicobars, with lists of plants from two islands never before botanically investigated.\n\nThe most important contribution to Indian Economic Botany for the year has been the issue of Vol. 5 of the Dictionary of the Economic Products of India, by Dr. G. Watt, c. i. e. The volume has been prepared by Dr. Watt, with the collaboration of Mr. J. F. Duthie and of Drs. J.\nMurray and W. R. Clark, and embraces economic subjects, alphabetically arranged, from L to O.\n\nThe Geological Survey Department continues to direct its attention to economic mineral exploration; though geological investigation is kept in fair progress. The very extensive area occupied by the Dharware (Transition) in the Anantapur, Bellary, Cuddapah, and Karnool districts of the Madras Presidency has, for all practical or economic purposes, been fully surveyed by Mr. Foote, and its position in the formational succession of India has thus been brought into closer correlation with certain transition divisions in Central India and the north-west frontier of Bengal, particularly the Gwalior and the Bijawars. At the same time, the associated crystalline rocks of this region have been differentiated into two series; the more foliated (or even schistose) sub-division of which can be connected with other bands in the Carnatic and Northern Districts, the whole constituting a distinct newer sub-series in the crystallines of Southern India. The importance of this survey of the Madras gneisses becomes manifest when considered in the recent light thrown on their relations by the remarkable paper, \"Contributions \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des gneiss \u00e0 pyrox\u00e8ne et des roches \u00e0 wern\u00e9rite,\" by M. Al. Lacroix, in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francaise de Min\u00e9ralogie, for April 1889; which gives the result of the first detailed microscopical work on the crystalline rocks of Ceylon and Salem.\n\nIn Baluchistan Mr. Oldham's work has been among the Cretaceous, Tertiary and Recent formations; the most interesting and important feature of which has been his recognition of a series of passage-beds, constituting his Dunghan Group, which he describes as probably representing the gap between the Secondary and Tertiary periods in Europe. This is an important link in the chain of evidence already gained in Peninsular India and in Sind, regarding the occurrence of series of strata offering similar interpretation. His examination of the recent deposits in the valley plains of Quetta, Pishin and the Dasht-i-Bedaulat, in connexion with the interesting group of natural artesian wells at Quetta itself, has enabled him to report on the mode of occurrence and probable distribution of artesian waters in these valley plains.\n\nOn the North-Western Frontier, the posting of Mr. Griesbach with the Miranzai Force, and of Mr. Middlemiss with that of the Black Mountain Expedition, afforded opportunities for some examination of the geology of those regions. Mr. Griesbach's survey has furnished material for a report which includes Notes on the Safed Koh and its skirting ridges; on the Geological Results of the Miranzai Expedition; on the Geology of the Khaibar hills; and on the Petroleum springs of\nPannoba. The main feature in this report, of interest to geologists in Europe, is his discussion of the possible connexion of the Safed Koh with the Hindu Kush system. He goes entirely against Prof. Waggon's extended interpretation of the views of Prof. Suess, as given in the former author's latest fasciculus of the Salt-Range Fossils (Palaeontologica Indica Series XIII, Vol. IV, Part 2, Geological Results); concluding that the Safed Koh is distinctly not part of the Hindu Kush system. Orographically speaking, it differs in strike; and structurally it is not analogous to the latter. The Hindu Kush contains, within its flexures, a series of marine miocene beds which take part in all the contortions and flexures which have affected the older rocks; it therefore dates in its entirety from post-miocene times. On the other hand, within the Safed Koh system there is no marine formation interposed between the later nummulitics (Murree series) and the Sivaliks. The elevation of this area was therefore finished, or at all events sufficiently so to form dry land, in miocene times, together with the ground north-east of it in the Himalayan system. The petroleum shows at Pannoba in Kohat are extremely poor; and Mr. Griesbach's examination of them does not lead to any prospect of improvement by drilling.\n\nIn mineral exploration, the work of the Survey may be summarised as follows: complete localisation of the important gold tracts in southern India; recognition of indications suggestive of the possible existence of lower Gondwana coal-measures under the Sriperambur group near Madras; examination by boring of the Daltonganj coal-field in Bengal; completion of the Darjiling coal survey; a fairly promising survey of the copper occurrences in Sikkim; renewed examination of the Garo hills coal; coal and oil exploration in Baluchistan and the south-east slope of the Takht-i-Suleiman on the Punjab frontier; and continuation of the Mergui tin exploration with very favourable results.\n\nThe Survey of India Department under Colonel Thuillier, R.E., again has a good record of geographical reconnaissance, the total area of new country mapped on various scales during the Survey year 1890-91 amounting to no less than 103,426 square miles. This area includes portions of Persia, Baluchistan, the North-Western Frontier of India, and Upper Burma, and is exclusive of the area surveyed by the topographical and revenue parties of the department.\n\nUpper Burma.\u2014Four columns operated on the Frontiers of Upper Burma during the season 1890-91, and were all accompanied by survey detachments. That under Lt. Elliott proceeded from Bhamo along the right bank of the Irrawaddy to the confluence of its two main branches,\nthe Malikha and the 'Nmaikha, at about 150 miles by land from Bhamo. Some rough measurements taken here gave approximately 33,500 cubic feet per second as the volume of the 'Nmaikha or eastern branch, while that of the Malikha or western branch was only 23,000. The temperature of the water in the former was also found to be 5\u00b0 or 6\u00b0 colder than that of the latter, from which it would appear that the 'Nmaikha receives more snow water than the western branch. The Malikha is navigable for boats when the water is low to Sardan, 24 miles north of the confluence, and possibly much further, but owing to rapids the 'Nmaikha is only navigable some six or seven miles from the junction. The latter being wider and deeper than the Malikha, and having the greater discharge of water, may fairly be considered the main source of the Irrawaddy.\n\nThe expedition proceeded northwards through a dense jungly country to a hill known as Pumlum Pum, about 57 miles from the confluence, but was unable to advance further. From this point Major Hobday was able to map in a good deal of the country along the course of the Malikha, almost to the Kanti country previously reconnoitred by Col. Woodthorpe in 1884-85. The expedition then moved back to Punwai and went eastwards to Sabaw on the Malikha, thence south along the right bank of the latter to Kwitao, and then crossing the river reached the 'Nmaikha at Lekonnoi ferry, some 20 miles east of the confluence. From this point they marched via Mailompum to Maingna, on the left bank of the Irrawaddy. A second attempt was made to ascend the 'Nmaikha, but it failed owing to the opposition met with at three marches from Maingna. This river has been accurately mapped in from the confluence as far as 'Nsentarn, where it makes a sudden turn to the west after flowing from the north. Beyond this point its general direction is known to be northerly, but the river itself is soon lost behind high mountains, and trustworthy information regarding its further course could not be obtained. No information of the existence of the Naungsa lake, which was reported to be the source of one of the branches of the 'Nmaikha, was obtained; and it appeared doubtful whether the river was fed by any large lake source, though it seemed probable that it had a large eastern tributary at a point several days' journey from the confluence. The Kantis refer to two rivers to their east, called the Nam Tisan and the Namdu Mai or Phung Mai. From the accounts given by the Kanti Shans of the position of the latter river, about 45 miles to the east, as well as from the similarity of the names and other points, there seems to be no question that it is the 'Nmaikha in its upper reaches, and is the eastern branch of the Irrawaddy. The Kanti Shans further state that there were two other large rivers to be crossed before\nreaching China, and these would be the Lukiang or Salween, and the Lan Ts'angkiang or Mekong. Little doubt therefore remains that the Lukiang is identical with the Salween, though there is so far no absolute proof of it. It is to be hoped that this will not long be wanting.\n\nMajor Hobday, who accompanied this party, succeeded in mapping 4,300 square miles of hitherto unexplored country lying to the N. E. and E. of Bhamo.\n\nCaptain Longe, R. E., and Lieutenant Gordon accompanied the columns which operated to the north and west of Mogauung, and succeeded in reconnoitring some 1,500 square miles of new country. The expedition under Lieutenant Daly, which started from Lashio and visited the chief villages of the states on the eastern frontier of the Shan States, was accompanied by Captain Renny Tailyour, R. E., who during the march of the column reconnoitred 5,250 square miles of unexplored country. This officer was enabled, at Meunglem and at Kenghung on the Cambodia, to compare the results of his work with those of M. Garnier, a French surveyor. These results agreed closely in latitude, but there was some difference in longitude. The Kyaington Chiengmai frontier mission under Mr. Archer was accompanied by Mr. Kennedy as survey officer. He succeeded in mapping 9,000 square miles of previously unknown country, lying chiefly to the north of that mapped during the previous year by the Anglo-Siamese Boundary Mission.\n\nIn addition to the above special reconnaissances, the general survey of Upper Burma has been carried on by two parties under Captain Longe, R. E. and Mr. Ogle respectively, and the outturn of their past season's work amounts to 21,794 square miles.\n\nBaluchistan.\u2014Geographical surveys on the \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch scales have been carried on by the party under Colonel Holdich, R. E., in the Zhob Valley, in Mekran, and on the Perso-Baluch frontier, the total area amounting to 30,240 square miles.\n\nPersia.\u2014Sub-Surveyor Imam Sharif Khan Bahadur was employed during the year on exploration work in Persia, and returned with the large total of 30,500 square miles of reconnaissance, on the scale of 8 miles to the inch.\n\nN.-W. Frontier.\u2014The expeditions which operated on the Miranzai border and in the Black Mountain country were accompanied by Captains Mackenzie and Wahab, R. E., respectively. In the former, 278 square miles were surveyed on the 1 inch scale, and 20 on the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch; and in the latter, 184 square miles on the 2 inch, and 360 square miles on the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch scale.\n\nA party under Lieutenant Close, R. E., has continued the principal\nTrigonometrical Surveys.\n\nTriangulation in Burma along the North West Karen hills. Observations were taken from nine principal stations, and the series was extended over a direct distance of 45 miles, embracing an area of 900 square miles. The selection and completion of thirteen principal stations in advance of the season's completed work will allow of the employment of two observers during the current season, and the outturn of work will be materially increased.\n\nDuring the year tidal observations were carried on at 17 stations on the coasts of India, Burma and Ceylon. The observatories at Madras, Coconada and Chittagong were closed during the year, while registrations were commenced at Trincomalee and Minicoy.\n\nThe levelling operations of the year comprised three lines of double levelling, namely from Rajkot to Dhasa and thence along the Bhavnagar-Gondal railway line to Bhavnagar, from Sanoora station on the same line to the Chachuda Temple near Salbet, and from Naydongri station along the north-eastern division of the G. I. P. Railway to Bhusawul, and thence to Malkhed station on the Nagpur branch; in all 425 linear miles.\n\nObservations for latitude were carried out by Lieutenant Lenox-Conyngham, R. E., at seven stations, between the parallels of 13\u00b0 and 15\u00b056', situated on the Madras Meridional Series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The instrument used was a new zenith telescope designed for the application of Talcott's method\u2014a system well known in America but not previously tried in India. The results prove that this instrument is very little inferior to the zenith sector, while it is not one-tenth of its weight.\n\nPhotographs of the sun have been taken, as in former years, at the Trigonometrical Branch office, Dehra Dun, on all days on which the sun was visible. The computing section of this office has carried on the work of the final reduction and publication of the results of the operations of the Trigonometrical Survey. Volume XIV, containing the details of the triangulation of the S. W. Quadrilateral, has been completed, in addition to three synoptical volumes. Progress has also been made with the volumes dealing with electro-telegraphic and tidal operations.\n\nThese have been carried on in Chittagong, Jalpaiguri, the Southern Maratha country, Gujarat and Rajputana, Mergui, Baluchistan and the Himalayas. Forest Surveys were continued in Hoshangabad, Cen-\ntral Provinces; in North Canara, and in the Poona and Thanna districts of the Bombay Presidency; in Coimbatore, Tinnevelly and Madura districts, Madras Presidency; in the Prome and Toungoo districts in Lower Burma; while new surveys were instituted in Jalpaiguri and in the Lansdowne Cantonment.\n\nThese operations have been continued in Chittagong, Tipperah and Jalpaiguri, in Bengal; in Garhwal and the Cadastral Surveys. Rampur State in the N.-W. Provinces; in Kamrup, Nowgong, Darrang and Sylhet, Assam; in Mandalay, Meiktila, Thongwa and Amherst, Burma; and in Pooree and Cuttack, Orissa. Traverse Surveys were carried on by two parties, one in Mandla, Central Provinces, and the other in three districts of Lower Burma.\n\nThe work of the publishing offices of the Survey has progressed steadily, though there are no new publications of special importance to note. A third edition of the 32-mile map of India, with considerable extensions in Baluchistan and Burma, is well advanced. Constant additions are being made to the maps of the new country in Upper Burma and our S.-E. Frontier. The heliogravure process continues to make good progress in the photographic office, and it is proposed to bring out the sheets of the new survey of the City of Calcutta by its aid on a reduced scale. During the year a process of photo-block printing in half tones was introduced, and seems likely to have many useful applications.\n\nThere is nothing very special to record regarding Asiatic Geography during 1891 except Lord Lamington's journey Trans-Frontier and other Geographical Explorations. from Siam to Tonquin, but nevertheless the year has not been an unfruitful one, and has been specially marked by the publication of some of the important results obtained during the explorations in Central Asia that had been in progress in the previous few years. The need for a more exact knowledge of our border lands on our own part is yearly becoming accentuated by the steady advance of our European neighbours on the N.-W. and S.-E., and though there is reason to believe that the subject is receiving due attention, it is to be regretted that some of the results which might be of scientific interest are not permitted to appear.\n\nSiam.\u2014The Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society contain a very interesting account by Lord Lamington of his journey through the Trans-Salween Shan States to Tonquin. Starting from Bangkok he proceeded to Chieng Mai, where he joined Mr. Archer, the British Consul, who was then starting on an expedition to settle the frontier between the Shan States and Siam, and accompanied him as far as\nHong L\u00fck. Then diverging to the east he went on towards Tonquin, through the Sipsong Pana, passing through nearly 300 miles of hitherto quite unknown country and reaching French Territory at Muang Jheng. Thence he went to Lai Chau on the Black River, which he descended by boat to Cho Bo, the highest point navigable by steamers, owing to a barrage of rocks. From here he went down through an open fertile and thickly populated country to Hanoi. He was exceedingly well received by the French officers he met; and though his paper is entirely geographical, some light is thrown upon the unhealthy nature of the country and the difficulties the French have to contend against in settling their new possessions. It also shows how the French possessions are being advanced towards the line of the Mekong. Lord Lamington found the greatest difference in salubrity and productiveness between the Shan States and the country he passed through along the Black River, the advantage being with the former. He made a very careful survey of his route, and his complete map when published will be a valuable addition to our knowledge of this part of our Eastern Trans-Frontier.\n\nMr. James McCarthy, Superintendent of Surveys in Siam, has fixed the longitude of various places in Siam by telegraph, among them Luang Prabang (Pagoda), 102\u00b0 05' 56\" E., and Korat (Court House) 102\u00b0 06' 52\" E.\n\nFrench Possessions.\u2014The question of the navigability of the Me-nam-Kong (commonly but erroneously called the Me-Kong; its real name being the Nam-Kong, or River Kong\u2014Me, an affix meaning mother) still continues to excite the interest of the French, with the object of developing trade with the country about its upper waters. A launch was to have been sent up with this object, but was unable to pass the Kong rapids. It has been found that a steamer service could be maintained all the year through for that part of the river comprised between the junction of the Sa-mun and the sea, and from July to January or February for the part lying between Luang Prabang and Kemmarat. The Siamese are also alive to the importance of steam navigation on the upper part of the river, and are said to be arranging for the transport of a launch from Bangkok.\n\nThe Comptes Rendus of the Paris Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Geographie contain a short account of an expedition made by Father Guignard, a missionary in South Tonquin, to the upper part of the river Ngan-Kha or Song-Mo. He started from Ka-chai with a military reconnoitring party. The river was navigable for three days in junks, after which canoes had to be used and often had to be towed. At the ruined village of Cua Kao, the Ngan Kha divides into the Nam Mo, going east, and the Nam Nom.\ngoing north. Father Guignard followed the former to Tu-do on the frontier of Tran Ninh, which although belonging to Annam, is occupied by Siamese. Here he visited the Meos, a tribe of Chinese origin who have fine cattle, fruit trees, especially peaches, and a very large and productive species of maize; but they are ruined by opium smoking. The wild Meos live on the top of the mountains. From Muong Xa the party followed the Nam Tam till it joined the Nam Non at Muong Lam; then the Father went on up the Nam Non, which was a succession of rapids and waterfalls, to Hat Bo and afterwards to the Muong Mat, to obtain the release of two Christian captives. He returned in boats furnished by the Muong Mat, most probably down the Nam Mat, to Muong Lam, and thence he proceeded to Ka-chai via Kanh Trap.\n\nUnder the superintendence of Captain Bauchet new maps of the French possessions in S. E. Asia are being prepared at Hanoi, (1) in 40 sheets on the scale of 1 : 200,000, (2) a reduction of the above map on the scale of 1 : 500,000, and (3) a general map on the scale of 1 : 1,000,000. The maps are printed in colours.\n\nEastern Tibet.\u2014In the Proceedings of the R. G. S. Mr. A. E. Pratt has published a very interesting narrative of two journeys from Shanghai and Hankow, made in 1889 and 1890, to Ta-Tsien-lu on the eastern borders of Tibet. In the course of the second journey he visited Mount Omei, 11,000 feet high, and a Buddhist place of pilgrimage of great sanctity. Here he several times witnessed the phenomenon known as the \"glory of Buddha.\" Mr. Pratt was engaged in collecting natural history specimens, and the paper contains information regarding many new plants, &c., found. He met Prince Henry of Orleans and M. Bonvalot at Ta-tsien-lu, and it was by Mr. Pratt's instrumentality that the collections made by the Prince were safely despatched to Europe.\n\nA full account of Mr. Rockhill's journey from China in the direction of Lhasa, noticed in last year's address, has also been published during the year.\n\nCentral Asia, Eastern Turkestan.\u2014In the Izvestia of the Russian Geographical Society, the brothers Grum-Grjimailo have given an account, with a map, of the results of their expedition to the Tian Shan oases. This account has been translated by Mr. E. D. Morgan, and is published with the map in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society. The route taken by these travellers was noticed in last year's address, and their observations and collections are now being worked out. An examination of the hypsometrical observations made by Major-General Dr. von Tillo, has revealed the existence of a depression in the hollow between the Tian Shan and the Chol Tau range of the Altais near Lukchin, in the neighbourhood of Turfan, from which it would appear that Lukchin is about\n164 feet below the level of the sea, with an approximate error of \u00b1 82 feet. To connect this point with a series of levels, to found a meteorological station there, and to take pendulum observations, would be objects of the highest scientific interest; and Major-General von Tillo proposes to visit the spot and investigate this remarkable depression, which was observed by Colonel Pievtsoff as well as the brothers Grum-Grjimailo. Another point of interest, as reported in the above account of these travels, is the existence of Uighur ruins at Syngym, an oasis in the Tingi-tan mountains, where it is said that gold and silver things, copper vessels and censers, &c., are found; also of Uighur writings, which are frequently found with grains of wheat in a particular kind of earthenware vessels; as well as leaflets with inscriptions on them, enclosed in horn and wooden boxes, but so brittle that they often fall to pieces on being handled. These last seem to be specially interesting in connection with the birch-bark MSS. found by Lieut. Bower.\n\nThe same account gives notes on the large Natural History collections formed by the brothers, amounting to about 13,000 specimens, which are now being worked out, the Russian Government having voted a sum of 24,000 roubles for publishing the work of Gromchevski, Pievtsoff and Grum-Grjimailo.\n\nFurther accounts of the explorations in the neighbourhood of the Astyn Tagh Mountains, made by Colonel Pievtzoff's expedition, have been published. The expedition returned to Russia last March, having made a topographical survey of 5,000 miles, and 50 determinations of geographical positions, besides magnetic and other observations. They have also gathered vast geological, botanical and zoological collections, about 40 camel loads.\n\nFrom a paper read before the Geographical Society of Berlin by Herr L. Conradt, who accompanied Gromchevski as naturalist, it would appear that Chinese Eastern Turkistan, a region about 320,000 square miles in extent, is really a desert, except about the river system of the Tarim, where there are cultivated oases. The tyrannous government of the Chinese is likely in case of a revolution to give way to the Russian dominion, which is popular among the Muhammadans of Central Asia.\n\nRussian activity in Central Asia has been sustained, and further advances have been made. Under the leadership of Capt. Bachewski, an expedition left Samarkand in May, with the object of exploring routes in the Pamir and the passes over the Hindu Kush into Kafristan, supplementing Gromchevski's work. This party claimed the Pamirs as Russian territory and warned off our English explorers.\n\nM. Katanoff was exploring in the Tian Shan, principally in the interests of ethnography, and was to spend the autumn in Turfan and the winter in Kuldja.\nM. Dutreuil de Rhins, the author of an exhaustive monograph on Central Asia, has, at the instance of the French Academy, undertaken a scientific exploration in Chinese Turkistan accompanied by M. Grenard, a student of the School of Living Oriental Languages. At the last news he was at Khotan and would winter there. He had made meteorological and astronomical observations on his way, and had accurately determined the position of Khotan astronomically, as $37^\\circ 6' 35''$ N. lat., $79^\\circ 58' 15''$ E. long. from Greenwich, and 4639-191 feet above sea-level. He had also been exploring the country about Keria and Polu.\n\nMons. J. Martin, whose journey was noticed in the Address for 1890, appears to have met with many misfortunes. An attempt to proceed from Sutachen from east to west along the northern slopes of the Altyn Dagh to Lob Nor, which might have settled the question of the existence of the lake, failed owing to his being unable to obtain guides. He was obliged to make a detour across the Gobi, and proceeding via Hami, Karashar, and along the Tarim to Lob Nor, and then along the Cher Chan river, he arrived at Cher Chen on the 20th June and returned to Russia.\n\nAccounts of their adventurous journey through Asia have appeared from the pens of Prince Henry of Orleans and Mons. Bonvalot. The Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie contains a short account by the Prince, illustrated by an excellent map. A complete history of the journey by Mons. Bonvalot has been published under the title of \"Paris \u00e0 Tibet,\" and also an English translation of it.\n\nIn the Zeitschrift der Gesell. f\u00fcr Erdkunde zu Berlin, Dr. G. Wegener has very fully discussed the orography of the Kuen Lun range, which has a length of about 2,390 miles with a maximum breadth of about 500, and may be roughly estimated to cover 425,000 square miles. He also discusses the geology of the Kuen Lun and surrounding regions, and the observations of Riehthofen, Loczy and other travellers. The paper is illustrated by a map containing much that is new, and accompanied by a tracing showing the routes of travellers in Central Asia.\n\nThe Proceedings R. G. S. for July, contain a very interesting paper entitled, \"Our present knowledge of the Himalayas,\" by Colonel H. C. B. Tanner, late of the Survey of India, an officer who probably knows the different parts of the Himalaya mountains better than any other.\n\nUnder the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society an expedition has been arranged for to explore the high peaks and glaciers of the Kara-Koram. It will be under Mr. W. M. Conway and the Hon. C. G. Bruce (5th Gurkhas), who will be accompanied by Mr. Eckenstein, a practised Alpine climber, Mr. McCormick, an artist, and a Swiss guide.\nThey propose to make the Baltoro glacier in Baltistan their centre of operations at first.\n\nThe Proceedings R. G. S. contain an account of Major General T. E. Gordon's journey from Teheran to the Karun and Mohamrah; and also a paper by Mr. C. E. Biddulph of his journey in company with Capt. Vaughan across the western portion of the Great Persian desert, via the Siah Kuh mountains and the Darya-i-Namak, in which he shows that what is called the Great Salt Desert is not salt throughout; that the deposit known as kavir is the same saline efflorescence found in Sind and the Panjab; and that the Darya-i-Namak, or sea of salt, is an instance of a salt formation quite distinct from the ordinary kavir.\n\nThe Scottish Geographical Magazine contains an account by Captain A. C. Yate of his journey to Taskeft, and is accompanied by a very useful orographical map of Central Asia.\n\nIn the same Journal, for March, Mr. J. G. Bartholomew gives a very valuable list of published maps of Asia, with a map showing the extent and value of the geographical surveys. Out of 17,250,000 square miles only about 750,000, or one twenty-third, are absolutely unexplored.\n\nDr. J. Burgess, c. i. e., has a paper in the same Journal on \"Mapping and place-names in India,\" in which he draws attention to the correct representation of place-names in maps, and to the necessity for an index of geographical positions\u2014a want which measures are now being taken to supply, though it must necessarily be a work of time.\n\nIn this brief and imperfect review of the scientific and literary work of the past year, done by workers both in and outside of India, enough will, I trust have been said to show that considerable additions of high interest and value have been made to our knowledge of Indian subjects in many departments. No doubt it is true, and the complaint has actually been made to this Society, that most of the papers contributed to the Journal possess little interest except to specialists in their particular lines, and are not attractive to the general reader. This cannot be denied, and indeed the fact constitutes the very reason for our existence. We are here, as a Society, for the purpose of advancing the bounds of knowledge in different directions; and though articles of popular interest are freely admissible into our pages, we have to march in line with scientific workers in the Asiatic field all over the world; and if we are to retain our position, our contributions to the general sum of knowledge must keep pace with the progress of research, in other words, must be for the most part abstruse and technical. I may add, on this point, that there is one direction in which members of our Society can very usefully promote its interests. The Library of the Society is intended, not\nmerely for reference within these walls, but also for the use of members living at a distance, who are entitled to take out books subject to certain necessary (and not very onerous) conditions. A valued member of the Society, himself a worker in the field of anthropological inquiry, has taken the trouble to specify a number of books which he wished the Society to procure in order to assist him in his own investigations. If other members, working in different fields, would help the Library Committee with similar suggestions, the effect would be to increase the value of the Library for practical purposes and its usefulness to members; and the Council would, I may safely say, be very ready to meet such suggestions so far as it lay within their means to do so.\n\nIn his Annual Address last year my predecessor, Mr. Beveridge, threw out a suggestion that, instead of monthly meetings at which subjects of all kinds were discussed indiscriminately, we should have separate fortnightly meetings for the discussion alternately of literary and arch\u00e6ological subjects, and of those relating to the Natural Sciences. Mr. Beveridge observed that \"under the present system, only about half of the audience is interested in any paper that is being read. As a rule the zoologist does not care for inscriptions or coins, and the numismatist or philologist does not care for animals or plants.\" This suggestion has since been repeated; but so far as I could understand the general sense of the Society, it was rather to the effect that the proposal left out of sight that considerable number of members who, without being specialists in any subject, took a general interest in all. These are the members whom we wish to attract to the Society, in the hope that some of them may be stimulated, by what they see and hear at our monthly meetings, to devote themselves to some branch of inquiry, it may be scientific, or it may be literary, which may from time excite their interest. Nor do I think that the restriction of interest to one branch of knowledge or the other is, even among specialists, so absolute as is sometimes supposed. If so, it would be hard on such members to compel their attendance at two meetings where one has hitherto sufficed.\n\nGentlemen, I beg to offer you my cordial thanks for the honour that you did me last year in electing me your President, and for the patient attention with which you have listened to this address.\n\nThe President announced that the Scrutineers reported the result of the election of Office-Bearers and Members of Council to be as follows:\n\nPresident.\n\nHon.

During the reign of King \u00c1soka, the country to the north of the Himalayas was first explored by his generals and called Himavata. Buddhism rapidly spread there and gained much importance on account of the learning of its teachers. In the schism which took place after the second Council in Buddhism, the name Himavata was given to the school that prevailed in Tibet. The Chinese pilgrim Fahian visited the headquarters of the Himavata school in Western Tibet which, in vulgar language, was called Hima-desa, *i.e.*, the snowy country. In the beginning of the seventh century, the first Tibetan who came to Magadha to study the art of writing was called Sambhota, the excellent Bhota. From that time Tibet has been known to the people of India by the name of Bh\u00f4t or Bhota. Hence the general epithet of a native of Bh\u00f4t was Bhotya or Bhotia. The Tibetans, when the art of writing was first introduced in their country about A.D. 630 to 634, endeavoured to reproduce the name Bh\u00f4t in their language with the newly formed Tibetan character b, o and d, *i.e.*, Bod, the literal meaning of which is to call or invoke. But in the Tibetan language the letter B is pronounced as p and the last consonant of a word is seldom or very imperfectly pronounced. Hence the name written as Bod becomes in pronunciation P\u00f6.*\n\nThe name by which Tibet is known to the Tibetans is therefore P\u00f6. The name Tibet by which Marcopo\u0142o designated the country, seems to have been the corruption of \"Tu-bod,\" the epithet by which the\n\n*In the history of Sikkim the name Tribota Narendra (Tibetan king) appears to be the principal designation of the first Mah\u00e1raja of Sikkim who came from Tibet.*\ncountry was known to the Turks and Tartars. In the Travels of Solyman the Arab merchant, which, according to Reinaud, was published in 850 A.D., the name Tibet was first mentioned. The Chinese name for the whole country is Tufan. From an inscription on the Doring monolith of Lhasa dated 822 A.D., in Chinese and Tibetan character, the name Bod is written with the Chinese initial Fan. Hence it appears that the Chinese name Tufan is the same as Tubod which is still the Mongolian name for Tibet. The name Weitsang applied to Tibet by the Chinese is compounded of the two names of the two principal provinces of the country, vis., Wu and Tsang. The names Hsi-Tsang and Hsi-fan (in which hsi = west) are also indiscriminately applied to the country by the Chinese.\n\nThe name Alak\u00e1vati by which Tibet is also known to the Indians may be traced in the term Changlo-chan by which the part of the province of Tsang, lying to the north of the Chomo-Lhari and Kang-chan Junga mountains, is designated. The Tibetan word Changlo-chan (in which Changlo = Alaka and Chan = vati) signifies Alak\u00e1vati or the place where men and women wear flowing or braided locks. The custom of wearing the Changlo exists, even now, as it existed before, in Tibet. There the men wear only one plaited tail while the women enjoy the privilege of braiding their flowing hair into two. Tibet was for this reason designated Alak\u00e1vati by the Indians, though the Tibetan equivalent of that name was applied were to a part of Tsang by the Tibetans themselves. The grove of Changlo-chan situated on the river Painam with its attractive scenery, forms an important landmark to travellers who proceed to Lhasa from the south, via Gyan-tche.\n\nAccording to Sum-pa the great Tibetan Historiographer and also the early records of Tibet, it is mentioned in certain Chinese histories that the people who inhabited the Arya-bhumi, the blessed land of the Hsi-thian (western heavens) originated from the gods, the people of China, the flowery country\u2014sprang from the dragon, the offspring of the heaven and the earth, the Mongolians originated from the demons and last of all the Tibetans descended from the Yakshas, a kind of mischief-making demigods. The Hindus regarded the Saki-Tartars and the early Persians, who worshipped the Ahura (Asura) and lived at the foot of Meru, i.e., about the Parapomisus* mountains as the descendants of the Asuras who waged war on Indra, the Emperor of India and his nobles. The Hindoos designated the Tibetans by the name of Huna and Ga\u00f1a or the legions of Kuvera, the god of wealth. From the internal evidence of the classical writings of the Hindoos, it appears that the specific designation which they had for the Chinese really signified the Tibetans.\n\n* Para and apa Nished mountain.\nIn the passage of the *Udyoga parva* \u201cB\u00e1jina\u00f1cha Sahasr\u00e1ni Chinade\u015bodbhav\u00e1nicha\u201d the Tibetan pony was evidently referred to.*\n\nIn the Buddhist work called *Sambhara Samudra* Tibet is mentioned as one of the 24 abodes of the celestial nymphs, where sages still in their human shape, resided in peace. Even when Buddha preached his doctrine in India, there lived, in the country of Himavata men, who by the dint of their moral perfections, were able to achieve wonders. The place where these intellectual giants, male and female, called in Tibetan *Pah-vo* and *Pah-mo* lived, is conjectured by the historians of Tibet to be the district of *Pha-bonkha* near Lhasa. The Mahabharata also tells us that the sacred abode of the divine sages was a place in Himavata called *Paraloka*, beyond the snowy Himalayas, where to the holy brotherhood there was immunity from disease and the troubles of a worldly life. The author of the *Surya Siddhanta* called this country by the name of Siddha-pura, the land of perfection and accomplishment, and the description that he has given of the place tallies with that of the Mahabharata.\n\nThe name Pur-gyal by which Tibet was called in early times, as may be gathered from Pon, as well as old Buddhist works, may have been derived from the name *Para loka* where *loka* means world and *gyal* (dominion). *Pur* in Tibetan means \u201cthe dead.\u201d Hence *Para loka*, the future world, may be brought very near to the meaning of the name Pur-gyal.\n\nThe legendary accounts of Tibet as preserved in the *Debther Nonpo* and other works give different stories about the origin of the Tibetans. It is said that in early times a race of people called Noi-jin, (*yaksha*) i.e., the mischief-makers inhabited the country. Though they were rich, having in their possession precious stones and metals, yet they used to do mischief to each other and to live in a state of continual warfare. So late as the first century B.C. twelve Noi-jin chiefs are said to have partitioned the country among themselves, a few years before the Indian prince Nyah-thi-tsanpo visited Tibet. The tradition about the Tibetans as related in Gyalrab and other works which is credited by the people at large as the true story\u2020 of their origin, is both interesting and curious. A certain monkey, having gone to Tibet, lived in a solitary\n\n* In the early records of Tibet, it is mentioned that the Chinese language was called *Nagabhasha* by the Indians, while Sanskrit was called the language of the gods; and that the people who traded with India, coming from beyond the seas with such commodities as satin (*chin\u00e1m \u015baka*), camphor porcelain, &c., were called the *Nagas*. From this, it appears, that in olden times the merchants, who coming from the direction of the Indian Ocean used to trade with India, were no other people than the Chinese. These *Naga* merchants had settlements at P\u0101taliputra and other great centres of trade.\n\n\u2020 Some identify this monkey with Hanumana the hero of the Ramayana.\ncavern, of a dark brown rocky cliff. There he meditated in peace on the moral perfections of the saints. Once, while he was engaged, in meditation, an Amazonian woman, Rakshasi, in the garb of a beautiful maiden, came to see him. The saintly appearance and character of the monkey ravished her mind, in consequence of which she paid him frequent visits. At last she opened her mind to him and entreated him to accept her as his companion. At this, the monkey who being tired of the world had besought himself to the solitudes of the Himavata, became very much embarrassed. When the woman again approached him with the same prayer, he replied; \"I am a devotee of Arya Lokesvara and have taken the vows of purity. How is it possible for me to enjoy your company?\" If you permit me to serve you, said the woman, your purity will increase, but if you do not allow me to be your wife I shall put an end to my life and thereby make you the cause of my death. So saying she made him a profound salutation. Seeing his monkey holiness unmoved she fell prostrate on the ground and with tears flowing from her eyes thus implored:\u2014\"Oh prince of the monkeys, do vouchsafe unto this suppliant woman your mercy and love. At length the kind-hearted monkey moved by compassion, proceeded to the sacred hill of Potala on the top of which stood the mansion of the divine saint Lokesvara. Arrived at the gate he thus invoked him:\u2014Oh thou, merciful Lord, Protector of the world, accept my prayers. Since becoming a devotee of thee this humble monkey has been keeping his vows just as one preserves his life. While I was engaged with my sacred duties in a solitary cavern, a maiden of unsurpassed beauty came to see me. She does not leave me alone. By her constant attendance upon me, my vows are about to be broken. At this critical time, command me, Oh saint of saints, how to behave.\" To this a voice from heaven replied:\u2014Take her for your wife. A second voice from the saintly goddesses Tara and Bhrukuti said: That is excellent, that is excellent. Then the patriarch monkey and the woman lived as husband and wife and in course of time they got six children. These being of mixed origin, partly resembled their father and partly their mother in the inward and outward features. In their traits of character they differed much from one another. The patriarch kept them for a period of three years in the forest called the grove of peacock's assembly. Then more children were born. They lived upon wild fruits during a part of the year and when their supply diminished or became exhausted the monkey children lifting their arms cried;\u2014Father, what to eat? mother, what to eat? The patriarch now reflected within himself:\u2014What have I done? Why have I given existence to so many that are starving for want of provisions? Oh merciful Lord, it was at thy command that I gave birth to\nthis numerous progeny. It was not for satisfying any lust or unholy desire that I permitted myself to be united with the demon of a woman. It was simply out of compassion that I took her. Is compassion, therefore, the cause of this misery of myself and children? How am I to be saved from this mire of worldly troubles? Grant me thy grace and tell me how I am to support my children. Then a voice from heaven was heard to say:\u2014Your children shall be protected by me, Oh prince of monkeys, do not be concerned at all. Then the Lord Lokesvara proceeding towards the deep recesses of the Sumern Mountain brought the seeds of six kinds of grain, such as barley, wheat, peas, oats, maize and buck wheat and scattered them on the ground. So these grains grew up uncultivated by the hand of man. Then the great patriarch took his children to the table land of Kong-poi ri, where the grain grew wild, and told them Ta-soi Zoi-dang, (now then eat and eat) From that time, the rich and fertile plains of Che-thang became known by the names of Zo-thang and Tasoi. Then the children of the patriarch monkey began to subsist on these six kinds of grain eating them to their heart's content. From the effect of the grain on their constitution, their tails and the hair of their body grew shorter and at last the former totally disappeared. In course of time they learnt to talk and to live as human beings. Subsisting on the wild and uncultivated grains of Tibet, the earliest people of Tibet lived, for a long time, in a state of nature. Then they used to clothe themselves with leaves and keep themselves warm by means of the barks of trees. On account of their mixed parentage, the Tibetans have inherited from the side of their father, the saintly patriarch, the virtues of good temper, faithfulness, compassion, industry, love of pious actions, politeness in language and skilfulness in conversation. From their mother's side they have inherited wrathfulness, a passion for gain and trade, cupidity, sense of rivalry and emulation, the habit of breaking into loud laughter, a powerful physique, intrepidity, impatience, speculativeness, delighting at other's faults and fierceness of character. At this period, forests of trees multiplied in the bleak plateau of Tibet, the valleys and ravines were filled with water. The glacial lakes were drained by the overflowing of their banks, and cultivation of the plains commenced, and towns and villages were founded.*\n\n* \"It is asserted that Tibet, in remote times, was almost totally inundated; and the removal of the waters that covered its surface, is imputed to the miraculous interposition of some object of their worship, whose chief temple is reported to be at Darjedan, (Vajra san in Buddha) Gaya. He, it is said, in compassion to the few inhabitants which Tibet contained, who in that age were little better than monkeys, drew off the waters through Bengal, and by sending teachers among them humanized...\"\nLong before the advent of Buddha, when the countless armies of the Kuru were defeated by the Pandus and the hero Duryodhana fell in the battle-field of Kurukshetra, one of his generals named Rupati dressed in woman's attire fled towards the Himalayas with one thousand followers. For fear of being pursued by the enemy, he penetrated into the country of Himavata and settled there with his men. At that time, the aborigines of Tibet were still wild and uncultured and lived in caves and holes dug in mountain sides. In course of time, the Indians visited the country and multiplied their settlements. The people of Hor (Tartary) also came to Tibet. These three people mingling together, produced the Tibetans proper, and Avalokitesvara, the patron deity of Tibet, feeling compassion for the benighted hordes chose to appear among them as a Lama or a king. It is on this account that even infants spontaneously lisp, in the sacred six syllables 'Om mani-peme-hum.'\n\nA scion of the Pandava dynasty after wandering in the Himalayas, as a traveller, at last entered the country of Himavata by crossing the pass over Lhari-tse now called Yarlung-shambo. From the top of this mountain he descended to the valley of Yarlung, which on account of its fertility as well as scenery and also being the place where the first king was anointed, was called Tsan-thang go-shi (King's plain with four entrances). At this time twelve chief herdsmen had been pasturing their cattle in that plain. As soon as they saw the solitary prince coming towards them from an unexpected quarter, they were struck with wonder and curiosity, and assembled round him. When asked who he was and whence he came, the graceful youth not knowing their language pointed his fingers to the top of Lhari-tse which he had crossed. The Tibetans inferred from it that he was devaputra the son of a god come from heaven, descending the Lhari-tse (the top of the god's mountain). They conferred together what to do with him and at last resolved to make him their king. They then placed him on a chair resembling a dooly and conveyed him to Yam bu la gang. From being carried on the back (Nyah) of the people in a chair (thi) and made king (Tsang-po) he was called Nyah-thi-tsan-po.* The Tibetans under his direction built for him a lofty house of stone called Yambu lha khar\n\n* There are different accounts of the parentage of this prince in the records and ancient histories of Tibet.\n\nthe wretched race, who were subsequently to people it. In this belief of the Tibetans, which is too general to be totally rejected, it is not difficult to discover strong traces of the universal deluge, though the tradition, as might naturally be expected, is obscured by fable, and disfigured by a mixture of absurdity.\"\nIt was, therefore, the first palace that was erected in Tibet. Nyah-thi tsanpo trained the Tibetans in the art of war, established a system of government hitherto unknown to them, and gradually extended his sway over the whole country by bringing to subjection the petty chiefs who ruled over the different provinces. He married Nam-mug-mug, the handsome daughter of a Tibetan chief, and by her got So-thi-tsanpo who succeeded him on the throne. At this time the Bon religion was introduced into Tibet from the country of Sum-bha.\n\nThe following paper was read:\u2014\n\n*The Buddhist Pictorial Cycle of Existence (with 2 plates and a diagram)*\u2014By L.

Communicated by the Philosophical Secretary.\n\nThe Buddhist Bhava Chakra (Cycle of Existence) by Hari Mohan Vidy\u00e1bh\u00fasha\u1e47.\n\nThe theory of Prat\u00edtya-Samutp\u00e1da (causal formation, or evolution,) has ever been regarded by the Buddhists as containing the essence of Buddha's doctrine, and occupies the highest place in the philosophy of Buddhism, and occurs in both schools of Buddhism, in the lesser and the greater vehicles. The P\u00e1li Mah\u00e1vagga and the Lalita-Vistara of the Northern Buddhist literature, both explain it in the same way. Mr. Foucaux has published a French translation of the latter in the \"Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet,\" and Professor Sir Monier Williams gives an account of the theory in his \"Buddhism,\" p. 102. But these, being merely translations from the texts (P\u00e1li and Sanskrit), do not throw any additional light on the interpretation of the original.\n\nIn course of reading the Avad\u00e1na Kalpalat\u00e1 with Babu Sarat Chandra Das, which is being published for the Bibliotheca Indica, I came across the 75th Pallava called Prat\u00edtya Samutp\u00e1da Avad\u00e1na which consists of only 11 Slokas.\n\nHere the great poet Kshemendra has so clearly set forth the theory in his inimitable style of versification that one is almost tempted to regard it as the key to the abstruse Buddhist ontology which is so imperfectly understood.\n\nI have carefully studied Sir Monier Williams' account of the theory, and the comparison which he has made between Buddhism and the Ved\u00e1nta and S\u00e1nkhya schools of philosophy. I have also compared the text of the Kalpalat\u00e1 with the controversial argumentation of V\u00e1chaspati Misra in Bh\u00e1mati, and I find that there are additional materials to be drawn from the latter for a thorough elucidation of the famous theory.\n\nThe Kalpalat\u00e1 runs as follows:\u2014\n\nTHE TEXT.\n\n\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0941\u0903 \u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0941\u0903 \u0915\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094b\u093d\u092f\u0903 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0903 \u0965\n\n\u2014\n(1.) Who except the Omniscient can understand, explain, and dissipate, the manifold operations of this tree of Sams\u00e1ra, of which Avidy\u00e1 is the root?\n\n(2.) In ancient times, when the blessed all-seeing Lord Buddha was residing at the Jeta grove in Sr\u00e1vasti, he spoke thus to the assembled Bhikshus:\u2014\n(3.) Oh Bhikshus, whose minds have become purified by the light of wisdom, listen to me. I will explain to you the law of causes and effects in their proper order:\n\n(4.) The all enveloping Avidy\u00e1 is the radical up-binding cause of Sams\u00e1ra, the great tree of poison which is full of misery.\n\n(5.) Avidy\u00e1 is the efficient cause of Samsk\u00e1ras, which have in them the essence of body, speech, and mind. Samsk\u00e1ra gives rise to Vijn\u00e1na (consciousness), which has in it the conception of mind.\n\n(6.) From Vijn\u00e1na comes N\u00e1ma-R\u00fapa, the idea of individuality, which brings into operation the six organs of sense.\n\n(7.) The connection, or contact, of Nam\u00e1-R\u00fapa with the six organs of sense is called Spar\u015ba. Sensation caused by contact with the senses is called Vedan\u00e1.\n\n(8.) Vedan\u00e1 operating on objects produces Trishn\u00e1 (desire). The activity of desire is called Up\u00e1d\u00e1na.\n\n(9.) Up\u00e1d\u00e1na produces Bhava (re-incarnation), in the three states, namely K\u00e1ma, R\u00fapa, and Ar\u00fapa.\n\nRe-incarnation causes species, i.e., moving to different kinds of existence.\n\n(10.) J\u00e1t\u00ed, or individualized existence, brings on old age, misery, and death. Cessation from Avidy\u00e1 stops all these sufferings.\n\n(11.) This cycle of causality based on Avidy\u00e1 is of manifold operation. You, O Bhikshus, who enjoy peace and retirement in solitude should fully comprehend it by meditation. So that in course of time Avidy\u00e1 becoming weakened may be dissipated.\n\nThe Buddhists presuppose the existence of certain aggregates of atoms (some internal and some external) which constitute this universe. The external aggregates constitute the elements of earth, water, fire, &c. The internal or mental aggregates consist of Skandhas or groups of sensation, knowledge, feeling, &c. All these taken together constitute the basis of all personal existence. The personal existence is formed out of these by the cycle of causality called Pratitya Samutp\u00e1da headed by Avidy\u00e1, a term which has been variously rendered by scholars as Nescience, Ignorance, &c.\n\nFirst of all Avidy\u00e1 operates on the basis of the impersonal existence of a being, or in other words on the union of the two kinds of aggregates, and thereby generates what is called Samsk\u00e1ra.\n\nIt must not be here supposed that by the appearance of Samsk\u00e1ra Avidy\u00e1 at all disappears. It continues to work as a concurrent cause with Samsk\u00e1ra. Samsk\u00e1ra in its turn causes consciousness, or Vijn\u00e1na, a term by which the Buddhists convey the idea of soul. When Vijn\u00e1na appears, Samsk\u00e1ra also continues to operate as a concurrent cause; Vijn\u00e1na again generates N\u00e1ma and R\u00fapa, i.e., the individual being.\nThe individual being is possessed of the six organs of sense. The operation of these six organs of sense is called Spar\u015ba. The state of pleasure, pain, or indifference, produced by Spar\u015ba, is called Vedan\u0101. Vedan\u0101, or Sensation, working in reference to objects external or internal produces desire. Desire again in reference to its objects generates a kind of activity or Up\u0101d\u0101na, a word which conveys the same idea as the well known Buddhist term \"Karma.\" This activity causes Bhava, i.e., a new existence based on a new set of aggregates. This again by Up\u0101d\u0101na, now acting as a concurrent cause, is moved to existence in species, i.e., J\u0101ti. The condition of existence in the species, be it in a god of long life or in a short lived insect, is old age, misery, and death.\n\nIn this process it is evident that a cause, or a system of causes, operating on each other, or on the aggregates, produces effects which are changeful according to the nature of Karma in the individual being. In Buddhism though it is generally held that everything is transient and illusory, the identity or oneness of an entity in all its embodiments is maintained. This is clearly illustrated by the writers of the J\u0101takas of Buddha and other saintly Buddhists. For at the end of each J\u0101taka its hero is made to declare that in such and such birth he was a god, a tiger, or a worm, and so on.\n\nThe idea of Ekot\u012bbh\u0101va the continued oneness of an entity in all its embodiments thus pervading the doctrine of Buddhism forces us to think that Dharma, or phenomena, alone are transient and non-permanent, and not the principal entity. The successions of phenomena and the conditions of existence are changeful, the entity or Sattva that enjoys or suffers remaining all the while the same.\n\nThe Buddhists think that it is possible to liberate the Sattva, the individual self, from the influence of Avidy\u0101, and thereby from the working of the cycle of causality believed to be the prime mover of the Bhava Chakra.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1.

In doing so, he begged again to express his thanks to the Society for the honour they had done him in electing him a second time to the office of President, an honour of which he was deeply sensible.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. An Account of the Journey of a Bengal Pandit to Tibet in 1037-38 A.D., by Bromton, the founder of the Grand Hierarchy of Tibet.\u2014By Babu Sarat Chandra Das, C. I. E.\n\nThe Paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. Brief note on the site of Ghiaspur, Bengal,\u2014By H. Beveridge, Esq., C. S.\n\nThomas in his initial coinage of Bengal, J. A. S. B. for 1867, pp. 50, 51 and 62 mentions a mint-town in Bengal named Ghiaspur and says that he has been unable to identify it. I beg to suggest that it is Ghiaspur on the left bank on the Bhagirathi between Baluchar and Jangipur.\n\nOn the right bank of the Bhagirathi on the way from Baranagar (famous for Rani Bhowani's temples) to Raghunathganj opposite Jangipur, there is a place called Ghi\u00e1s\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is described by Captain Layard in J. A. S. B. for 1853, p. 577, and two stones from there are now in the Indian Museum. (Vide Dr. Anderson's Catalogue, Vol. II, s. v. Ghi\u00e1s\u00e1b\u00e1d.)\n\nAt Ghiasabad I saw the dargah described by Captain Layard. It is in a desolate condition, but contains four Mahomedan tombs. One is in the centre and is higher than the others. I was told that it was the tomb of Ghiasuddin Sultan Ahl-i-Qoresh, and that the other three were those of his wife and two daughters. Captain Layard was unable\nto make out what Ghiassuddin this was. I beg to suggest that it was Bahadur Khan or Bahadur Shah who also had the name of Ghias or Ghiassuddin. (See Thomas and the Riy\u00e1z.) Bahadur Shah was skinned according to Ibn Batuta and the skin was taken to Delhi, but the body may have remained.\n\nThe other name of Ghi\u00e1sab\u00e1d is B\u00e1drihat (not Bodrihat, or Badrihat) and Hunter speaks of this as the Hindu name. But this is doubtful. May it not be a contraction for Bahadurihat, i.e., the market of Bahadur Shah?\n\nI have not visited the Ghi\u00e1spur or the other side of the river. It is about 2 miles higher up the river than Ghi\u00e1sab\u00e1d. I am told that there is nothing there, that the place has been washed away, and that there is also jungle. Bahadur Shah, or Ghias, whoever he was, may have had his city on both sides of the river just like Murshidabad was. Ghi\u00e1spur is disguised in the map under the name Goyespoor. If the Ghias of Ghissabad be not Bahadur Shah he may be the Ghiassuddin who was killed in battle with Nasiruddin. The words \"near Gaun\" may be a mistake. Of course Ghi\u00e1sab\u00e1d may really be Ghi\u00e1spur.\n\n3. Remarks on the Fauna of Narcondam and Barren Island.\u2014By D. Prain, Esq., M. B.\n\nDuring a botanical visit to these two islands, the results of which are now being elaborated, the writer, though unable and indeed unqualified to devote much attention to their fauna, could not avoid coming in contact to some extent with their animal and insect life. And perhaps his few rough notes made at the time, if thrown into a connected form, may induce by their perusal some qualified animal biologist to visit and investigate them thoroughly. In Mr. Mallet's exhaustive monograph of the geological structure and physiological aspects of the islands* their flora and fauna are only casually mentioned; similarly, in the writer's forthcoming notice of their vegetation, there can be but incidental allusions to their topography, geology, or zoology. Yet from what the writer was himself able to observe it is probable that their zoology will prove as interesting as their geology or their botany. It need hardly be said that the notes which follow allude entirely to air-breathing creatures and that no reference will be made to the marine fauna of the localities.\n\nMAMMALIA:\u2014A rat swarms everywhere on both islands and is the most plentiful mammal present. Examples preserved in the Indian Museum, obtained in Barren Island by Mr. Oldham, show that the\n\n* Memoirs of the Geol. Survey of India, vol. xxi, pp. 251-286.\nspecies is the Andamanese form of the widely distributed Tree-Rat (Mus ratus var. andamanensis).*\n\nIn Narcondam at dusk a frugivorous bat was observed flitting from tree to tree, and in Barren Island the writer came upon an example of Ficus Rumphii, on the outer aspect of the outer cone and about half a mile to the north of the landing place at the hot-spring, which was the home of a colony of these creatures. The writer was able to reach a point on the cliff almost overlooking the tree and where he was not more than twenty-five yards away from the bats. He was able to see that they were of a very dark brown (almost black) colour but, having no fowling-piece, he could not secure a specimen.\u2020 It is not improbable that, as in the case of the rats, the bats on the two islands belong to the same species.\n\nGoats have more than once been landed on both islands. On Narcondam there were however none to be seen and when one recollects that for a considerable portion of the year the island is absolutely waterless the fact is not surprising. And those formerly landed on Barren Island must also have perished, for a few years ago, Col. Tucker, then in charge of the Andamans, found it necessary to land five more. During our visit we several times saw three goats in company and as we discovered among the lava blocks the skeletons of two others it is not impossible that we were thus able to account for the whole five. The three seen together were all adults, perhaps therefore they have either not begun to breed or their young have been unable to survive. A well-trodden foot-path across the lava causeway near the landing-place shows that the goats come daily, at least during the dry season, to drink at the only spring the island possesses, hot-water charged with over 200 grains per gallon of saline matter.\u2021 Each morning during the writer's\n\n* Catal. of Mammalia in the Indian Museum, pt. ii, p. 63.\n\n\u2020 Had a specimen been shot it probably could not have been secured, for a direct descent from the writer's position to the foot of the tree was impracticable and to reach the spot where the specimen must have fallen would have entailed\u20141, a return to the landing-place (two hours work to begin with); 2, rowing half a mile to the mouth of the gulley in which the tree stood; and (granting that the sea-mouth of the proper gulley was hit off and, if it was, that a landing could have been effected\u2014neither event being at all a necessary consequence.) 3, a search for the particular tree involving a climb of over 800 feet through a particularly difficult jungle with much the same prospect of ultimate success that there would be in the proverbial search for \"a needle in a haystack.\" But this should only whet the appetite of the true collector for a visit to the islands; it will however show that the geologist or botanist who visits the place with but a limited time at his disposal, must confine his attention to his own subject and can do but dilettante work in any other direction.\n\n\u2021 Memoirs of the Geol. Survey of India, vol. xxi, p. 277.\nvisit we could see when we landed, from the new foot-prints on the wet sand round the spring and from the fresh dung there and along the pathway, that the goats had visited the spot overnight.*\n\nBirds:\u2014A brief sketch of the Avi-fauna of the islands has already been written by Mr. A. O. Hume.\u2020 His visit to each island was however very short; it may not therefore be uninteresting to give a list of the birds seen by him and to mention in addition those seen and recognised by the writer. It is unnecessary to say that even now the list must be very far from complete.\n\nList of the Birds of Narcondam and Barren Island.\n\n1. Cuncuma leucogaster Gmel. (White-bellied Sea-Eagle.) Stray Feathers ii, 149.\n\nVery plentiful in both islands, but especially in Narcondam, where to watch six or eight of them sweep and wheel and dart at each other, apparently in play, far overhead, was a most fascinating occupation. While ascending the mountain that composes the island we saw what was evidently the nest of this species at about 1,500 ft. elev.\n\nDistrib. India, Burma, Andamans, Nicobars, Malaya.\n\n2. Collocalia linchi Horsf. (Rock Swiftlet.) Stray Feathers ii, 157.\n\nA swiftlet is very common on both islands and can be seen as one rows along the coast darting in and out from every cavern hollowed by the sea under the old lava-flows. As no edible birds'-nests are found on either island this is most probably the species that one observes.\u00a7\n\nDistrib. Andamans, Nicobars, Malaya.\n\n* The landing of goats on such islands has little to recommend it from the economic point of view while the humanitarian aspect of the act has two sides. It is no doubt praiseworthy to attempt to stock such islands with goats in the hope that their flesh may prove of use to shipwrecked mariners, but to deliberately condemn the animals to a death by thirst\u2014as is done every time that goats are landed on Narcondam\u2014appears to the writer to be an act which should not be repeated. Nor is it at all certain that the landing of goats on Barren Island may not be\u2014all the physical conditions of the island considered\u2014an act of even more refined cruelty.\n\n\u2020 Stray Feathers, vol ii, pp 103\u2013110. The localities are again mentioned in connection with the birds themselves in Mr. Hume's detailed list of Andamans birds, l. c. pp. 139\u2013324.\n\n\u00a7 It ought to be observed however that some recent writers, (very notably Guillemand, in the Cruise of the Marchesa, vol. ii), return to the view which Hume, l. c., so strenuously opposes and apparently satisfactorily refutes, that Collocalia Linchi is the swift which makes edible nests. If Guillemand be right then the Rock Swiftlet referred to by Mr. Hume and the writer must be a different species.\n3. *Halcyon atricapillus* Gmel. (Small Kingfisher.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 168; also p. 104.\n\nThis, Mr. Hume says, *l. c.* p. 104, is most probably the Kingfisher he observed on Barren Island. Oddly enough the writer saw no Kingfisher on Barren Island, but several individuals, perhaps of this species, were very actively employed on the coast at the north-east corner of Narcondam.\n\n**Distrib.** India, Burma, Andamans, Nicobars.\n\n4. *Rhyticeros narcondami* Hume. (The Narcondam Hornbill). *Stray Feathers* i, 411; ii, 176.\n\nThis species, which is confined to Narcondam, is exceedingly plentiful there. It is very far from shy, for on one occasion when the writer and his attendants were busy cutting down a tree, three or four of these birds, apparently attracted by the noise, came and settled above us, continuing to scream and chatter overhead, while the tree vibrated under our strokes, for some time before making up their minds to fly away.\n\n**Distrib.** Endemic.\n\n5. *Palaeornis affinis* Tytler. (Red-cheeked Andaman Paroquet.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 184.\n\nCommon on both islands.\n\n**Distrib.** Andaman group, including Coco Islands and Preparis.\n\n6. *Eudynamys malayana* Cab. (Andaman Koel). *Stray Feathers* ii, p. 192.\n\nThe writer saw this Koel several times during his stay on Narcondam; Mr. Hume did not happen to have an opportunity of noting the species.\n\n**Distrib.** India, Burma, Andamans, Nicobars, Malaya.\n\n7. *Arachnothera andamanica* Hume. (Andaman Sun-Bird). *Stray Feathers* ii, 198.\n\nObserved by Mr. Hume on both islands, not seen by the writer.\n\n**Distrib.** Andaman group, including Coco Islands and Preparis.\n\n8. *Otocompsa emebia* Shaw. (Red-Whiskered Bulbul.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 225.\n\nObserved by Mr. Hume on Barren island, not seen by the writer.\n\n**Distrib.** India, Burma, Andamans, Nicobars (introduced).\n\n9. *Corvus levaillantii* Lesson. (The Bow-billed Corby). *Stray Feathers* ii, 243.\n\nThe writer one day noticed five of these large Andaman Crows\non Barren Island. There were none there apparently when Mr. Hume visited the island.\n\n**Distrib.** Himalaya; India; Burma, Andamans; Malaya.\n\n10. *Carpophaga aenea* Linn. (Imperial Pigeon.) *Stray Feathers*, ii, 260.\n\nNoticed once on Narcondam.\n\n**Distrib.** Himalaya; India; Indo-China, Andamans; Malaya.\n\n11. *Carpophaga bicolor* Scop. (Pied Fruit-Pigeon.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 260.\n\nExceedingly plentiful on both islands; a visitant from the southward.\n\n**Distrib.** Malaya; Nicobars; Andamans (a visitant).\n\n12. *Caloenas nicobarica* Linn. (The Nicobars Fruit-Pigeon.)\n\nNoticed several times on Narcondam, and once (three individuals together) on Barren Island, on the inner aspect of the outer crater to the south of the landing-place; a visitant from the Nicobars.\n\n**Distrib.** Nicobars; Malaya; Andamans (a visitant).\n\n13. *Cirrhipedemus mongolicus* Pallas. (Mongolian Shore-Plover.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 289.\n\nRather common on both islands.\n\n**Distrib.** Eastern Asia.\n\n14. *Tringoides hypoleucus* Linn. (Sand-Piper.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 299.\n\nVery common on both islands.\n\n**Distrib.** Cosmopolitan.\n\n15. *Gallinula phoenicura* Penn. (Water-Hen.)\n\nBarren Island. This was not met with by Mr. Hume and it is not a bird that one would expect to see in these islands. Yet each time we landed on Barren Island and each time we returned to the beach from the interior we observed in the vicinity of the small hot-spring at the landing-place what appeared to us to be the same individual of this species. On being disturbed it walked leisurely away and disappeared among the crevices of the adjacent black lava-flow. Mr. Hume notes his having met with the species in suitable localities everywhere from the Great Coco to Acheen; we must therefore suppose that the individual we saw had by some accident reached the island from one of the neighbouring members of the group and was making the best of the situation.\n\n**Distrib.** India; Indo-China, Andamans; Nicobars, Malaya.\n16. *Demiegretta sacra* Gmel. (Blue Reef-Heron.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 304.\nCommon on both islands.\n*Distrib.* India, Burma, Andamans, Nicobars.\n\n17. *Ardeola grayii* Sykes. (Pond-Heron.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 309.\nBarren Island only (*Hume*); not seen by the writer.\n*Distrib.* India; Andamans (a visitant).\n\n18. *Sternula melanauchen* Temm. (Snowy Tern.) *Stray Feathers* ii, 319; also p. 107.\nBarren Island (*Hume*).\n*Distrib.* Malaya; Nicobars; Andamans.\n\nThe common Fowl is said to have been landed on both islands along with the goats, there is now, however, no trace of its existence. Possibly the large lizard\u2014*Hydrosaurus salvator*\u2014which is common, at least on Narcondam, may be held responsible for its disappearance, nothing being more certain than that a fowl, if nesting on the ground, must sooner or later fall a victim to this voracious creature.\n\n**Reptiles:**\u2014There is on Narcondam at least one land-snake, for the writer and his companion (Mr. McCausland, commander of the \"Nancowry\") came upon one cast-off skin in the centre of the island.\n\nLizards, both iguaniform lizards and skinques, are very common on Narcondam though not at all frequent on Barren Island. The whole of the crested ones were very shy but the skinques were the reverse of timid.\u2020 The large water-lizard, *Hydrosaurus salvator*, is very common on Narcondam and is so unused to being disturbed that it waits till one comes so close as to be able to touch it before turning aside into the jungle. It was most common near the north bay where there is a small sandy beach frequented by turtles. Doubtless here, as elsewhere, the\n\n---\n\n*In this list of birds only the distribution within the limits of South-Eastern Asia (India and Ceylon; Indo-China; Malaya and Northern Australia) is given, a more detailed account of the distribution for the few that extend beyond this area being, for our present purpose, unnecessary.*\n\n\u2020 Having one forenoon crossed the island from the landing-place near the anchorage at the north-east corner to the north bay the writer with his companion (Mr. Kellog, Gunner of the \"Nancowry\") rested for lunch in the shade of the Coconut grove there; while eating we were amused to watch the skinques prospecting for the crumbs that fell aside; after a little\u2014we in the meantime sitting as still as possible\u2014some of the bolder or more confident lizards climbed our legs in search of more. We observed besides that others of them disputed with the hermit-crabs which swarmed there for a share of the nutty portion of some opened coco-nuts that we had thrown aside after drinking the \"milk.\"\neggs of the turtle form one of the staple foods of the *Hydrosaurus*, to\nthe omnivorous propensities of which the writer has already had occasion\nto allude.\u2020 In Barren Island none of these lizards were seen but it is\nnot at all improbable that they are present, for there are two small bays\nat the south-west corner where there are sandy beaches with a *Pandanus*\nfence and some Coco-nut trees behind. Owing to the strong swell and\nheavy surf the writer was unable to land at either of these places, nor\ndid he succeed in crossing the outer cone at a point whence he could reach\nthem from the interior. It is, however, not at all unlikely that turtles\nvisit these sandy patches and, if so, there is no doubt that, if *Hydro-\nsaurus* exists on the island, he will be in evidence there.\n\n**CRUSTACEANS:**\u2014Besides hermit-crabs, which are very plentiful, there\nare, at least on Barren Island, land-crabs.* And, as might be sur-\nmised, *Grapes* is plentiful on the rocks along the coast and is a source\nof interest to the Blue Reef-Heron and some of the other sea-fowl.\n\n**OTHER AIR-BREATHING CREATURES:**\u2014The writer did not see a single\nbeetle on Barren Island, but perhaps the season of his visit (March\u2014\nApril) had something to do with their absence. One or two were met\nwith on Narcondam\u2014the specimens obtained including, amongst others,\na Golden-Beetle.\n\nSpiders are common on both islands, particularly on Narcondam,\nwhere also a scorpion is to be found. It was, however, only seen once,\nwhen digging up an *Amorphophallus* tuber, and was not preserved.\u2021\n\nAnts are very common, the two chief kinds being the common red\nmango-ant, or a species very like it, both physically and physiologically;\nand a very small species that makes long powdery tunnels along the\noutside of, and sometimes also makes its home inside, the stems and\nbranches of various shrubs, e.g., it is common to find it inside living\nbranches of a species of *Leea* and of two species of *Ficus* (*F. brevicuspis*\nand *F. hispida* var. *daemonum*).\n\nAmong insects, besides a sand-fly and a mosquito, whose pres-\nence goes without saying, there is a very striking form, only\nnoticed however in Barren Island, in the shape of a small hornet which\nbuilds sometimes a discoid nest composed of single cells, mouth down-\nwards, in juxtaposition, and sometimes a long narrow nest of single\n\n---\n\n* Journ. As. Soc. Beng. vol. lx, pt. 2, p. 403, [footnote].\n\n\u2020 Land-crabs were not observed either on Narcondam or on Barren Island, but\nMr. Wood Mason has very kindly shown the writer specimens of a land-crab that\nare preserved in the Indian Museum; these were obtained in Barren Island by Mr.\nOldham.\n\n\u2021 The writer's native collector promptly treated it as vermin, and ere a protest\ncould be uttered had crushed it between two stones.\ncells in one or two rows on the under-surface of slender twigs.* Its sting is very sharp at the time; fortunately the irritation passes off almost completely in half-an-hour or so; unfortunately the nests are very numerous on all the drier slopes where there is any jungle.\n\nButterflies are not numerous in either island. On Narcondam one species (Cynthia erota) is plentiful, and another (Hephina lichinosa) is common; the other species are, at least at the season of the writer's visit, but poorly represented. On Barren Island all the species seen are, at that season, particularly scarce. The writer collected on Narcondam a few of most of the kinds seen, and during his visit to Barren Island he had the pleasure of the company of Mr. R. Wimberley, of the Port Blair Commission, whose ardour as a lepidopterist is well-known to his Indian brethren. As Mr. Wimberley came on purpose to collect the butterflies of Barren Island the writer paid but little attention to them; he had hoped that Mr. Wimberley might prepare a note, which could not fail to be highly interesting, on the species he had collected. Mr. Wimberley has not seen his way to do this; he has, however, most obligingly supplied the writer with a list of the species obtained by him; this list is given below verbatim. As regards the specimens collected on Narcondam the writer has had the privilege of the kind assistance of Mr. deNic\u00e9ville, who has most obligingly examined the small collection and named the species.\u2020\n\nList of Butterflies seen on Barren Island.\n\n(Prepared by Mr. R. Wimberley, Port Blair.)\n\n1. Hypolimnas bolina Linn. \u2642 two.\n2. Nacaduba celestis DeNic\u00e9v. Several.\n3. Castalius (species, could not tell).\n\n* To the writer's perhaps prejudiced imagination it appeared that it preferred making its nest on Capparis sepiaria to building elsewhere. The arrangement is excellent; an outlying sprawling branch hooks itself unobserved to one's leg or one's arm; the next movement sets the whole bush a-shaking and before one is aware his head and face form the point d'appui for a whole army of angry wasplets. The nests, from their shape and situation, are particularly difficult to see, and after forming the firmest resolve to be more wary next time, one only knows that he has blundered into another nest when it is necessary to pick the creatures off his face and from out his hair. So far from trying to obtain specimens our principal object was to keep out of the creature's way.\n\n\u2020 While thanking Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville for his kindness in naming this small collection, the writer would take this opportunity of mentioning that Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville has also kindly pointed out that the butterfly mentioned in Jour. As. Soc. Beng. lix, pt. 2, p. 256, as feeding on Calotropis gigantea, and as a recent introduction into the Andamans is not Danais genutia, as there stated, but Danais chrysippus.\n4. *Arhopala centaurus* Fabr. 9 one.\n5. *Heromia roepstorffi* Wood-Mason. Several.\n6. *Ixias andamana* Moore. Several.\n7. *Huphina nama* Moore. Two or three.\n\nUnfortunately Mr. Wimberley does not say if it is the Andamans race (*coruscans*) of *Arhopala centaurus*, or one of the other local forms, that he obtained.\n\nBesides the species in Mr. Wimberley's list the writer observed two others on Barren Island. One of these was the common \"Wandering Snowflake\" (*Leptosia xiphia*) which was seen in a gulley on the east side of the island on the outer aspect of the outer cone; in the same gulley the wings of a bird-eaten example of a very bright *Lycaenid* were picked up. From this it will be seen that our knowledge of Barren Island butterflies is capable of further extension. The same remark applies with perhaps even force to the list of Narcondam butterflies which follows:\n\n**List of Butterflies seen on Narcondam.**\n\n(Of the species marked (!) specimens have been examined and named by Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville.)\n\n1. **Cynthia erecta** Fabr.!\n   Several of both sexes caught. This is the commonest butterfly on Narcondam, the male being much more usual than the female though both are \"abundant.\" Mr. Wimberley and the Revd. Mr. Latham-Browne have informed me that though not rare, the species is not \"abundant\" in South Andaman and that there it frequents damp hollows. In Narcondam it is plentiful everywhere from sea-level up to 800\u2014850 feet elevation.\n\n   **Distrib.** N. E. India; Burma; Andamans.\n\n2. **Paethenos gambrius** Fabr.!\n   **Distrib.** Eastern Bengal; Indo-China; Andamans; Malay Peninsula.\n\n3. **Lampides elpis** Godart.!\n   One male.\n   **Distrib.** Himalaya (Sikkim); India; Burma; Andamans; Malaya.\n\n4. **Catochrysops onejus** Fabr.!\n   One female.\n   **Distrib.** India; China; Indo-China; Malaya; Andamans and Nicobars; Australia; Polynesia.\n5. **Leptosia xiphia** Fabr.\nOne specimen caught on high ground near the north end of the island. Not previously found in the Andamans, though a distinct form (*var. nicobarica* Doherty) occurs in the Nicobars.\n\n**Distrib.** India; Indo-China; Malaya.\n\n6. **Huphina lichinosa** Moore!\nOne female; after *Cynthia erota* the commonest butterfly.\n\n**Distrib.** India; Indo-China; Malaya; Andamans.\n\n7. **Ixias andamana** Moore.\nSeen during our ascent of the peak at about 1,200 feet elevation; no example was obtained.\n\n**Distrib.** Andamans.\n\nBy reviewing the distribution of the birds and butterflies (of which two groups, so far as these remarks go, anything precise is known) we may perhaps form some idea of the general relationship of the fauna of these two islands to that of the nearest adjacent lands. For it is extremely probable that, though neither group is completely detailed in its list, these lists nevertheless are representative. And it is equally probable that all the groups of air-breathing creatures will, when thoroughly known, be found to owe their presence here to the agencies that are accountable for the presence of the species enumerated.\n\nThe two islands, though spoken of ordinarily as members of the Andaman group, are only to be admitted as such with a very considerable qualification, since in reality they belong to quite a different physio-graphical system from that to which the Andamans proper are to be referred.\n\nThe Andamans themselves are, as in well-known, undoubtedly a continuation of the chain of tertiary sandstone hills known as the Yomah of Arracan, the connecting links being Diamond Island off the south coast of Arracan, Preparis Island and the Coco Group, the same system of peaks reappearing with certain limitations and modifications* in some\n\n---\n\n*For example, at the southern end of Great Andaman there are to be found, besides the sandstone about Port Blair which is exactly like that of the Coco Group and of Diamond Island, a different kind of sandstone rock in the \"Archipelago\" to the north-east of Port Blair and a coralline limestone in the \"Sentinels\" to the south-west; whether the \"Archipelago\" sandstone recurs in the Nicobars the writer is unable to say, the \"Sentinel\" limestone undoubtedly does, e.g., in Batti Malv.\nat least of the Nicobar Islands. Beyond the Nicobar group this system is continued southwards, not as is commonly said, (and perhaps generally supposed), into Sumatra, but into the Nias, a chain of islands lying along the west coast of Sumatra.\n\nThe two volcanic islands under discussion\u2014as well as a third peak, Flat Rock, which reaches the surface but no more at a point some 50 miles south of Barren Island\u2014are separated from the Andaman chain proper by a strip of sea 90 miles wide and over 1,000 fathoms in depth. In all probability therefore we see in these islands a northward continuation of the chain of volcanoes that stretches upwards from Flores and Sumbawa though the whole length of Java and of Sumatra to Barren Island and Narcondam and perhaps even beyond them to the extinct volcanic peaks of Popah in Upper Burma and of Han-Shuen-Shan in Western Yunnan. But even if this be true there is little doubt that both Barren Island and Narcondam conform essentially to the class of \"Oceanic\" islands and never have possessed any previous land-connection with neighbouring islands either to the south or to the west, or with continental Asia to the North-east. The present physical conditions in Narcondam appear moreover to be very ancient; there is no trace of a crater at the top of its peak* which rises 2,330 feet above the level of the Andaman Sea, and the whole island is clad with a dense jungle much richer in species than the forest on Barren Island is. But though the present biological features of Barren Island are of much more modern aspect, is it not necessary to consider that island as really less ancient than Narcondam. The topography of its outer cone, combined with the historical fact of recent activity on the part of the volcano, points to the possibility of some catastrophe similar to that which devastated Krakatau having once happened in Barren Island. And if this has been the case it would follow that the island must have required, even if previously covered with vegetation, to be stocked de novo with vegetable and animal life. Still, granting that the present fauna and flora of Barren Island are of more recent introduction than those of Narcondam, the fact remains that we must look upon every species present, even in the island with the older biological features, as an immigrant one.\n\nDealing first with the birds since these may include both voluntary and involuntary immigrants, we find that of the eighteen species enumerated, the Sea-Eagle, all the sea- and shore-fowl, the three Fruit-Pigeons and the large Corby, making altogether ten species, or 55 per\n\n* The appearance of the hill indicates however that there never has been a crater.\ncent. of the list, are probably deliberate visitants. And though the Sea-\nEagle has become a permanent resident and breeds on the spot, perhaps\nmost of the others are still seasonal visitants and nothing more. This is\ncertainly the case with the Fruit-Pigeons, two of which, Carpodectes\nbicolor and Caloenas nicobarica come annually from the Nicobars or from\nMalaya; the third, Carpodectes cunea, may come from Malaya or from\nIndo-China. Equally is this the case with Pond-Heron, which is a visit-\nant from India, and it may be the case with the Sand-Plover and the\nSand-Piper which are, in all probability, visitants from the north, and\nwith the Snowy-Tern which is probably a visitant from the south.\nPerhaps the Blue Reef-Heron, though probably at first a deliberate\nimmigrant, is now, like the Sea-Eagle, a permanent resident.\n\nThe Rock-Swiftlet and the Small King-fisher may either have come\ndeliberately or may have been driven by stress of weather to the islands.\nThe former is now certainly, the latter is probably, a permanent resi-\ndent. The Swiftlet, if driven here involuntarily, must have been an\nimmigrant under the influence of the south-west monsoon, the King-\nfisher may have reached the island under the influence of either the\nsouth-west or the north-east monsoon.\n\nThe Water-Hen may also have been driven here involuntarily,\nbut is quite as likely to be a deliberate, though an inadvertent, immi-\ngrant. In either case it has probably come from the Andamans, whence\nalso the large Corby has certainly come; the latter has probably, how-\never, not come deliberately but has been driven by stress of weather.\n\nThe Paroquet and the Sunbird, the Koel and the Bulbul are prob-\nably all involuntary immigrants, the two former under the influence\nof the south-west, the two latter under the influence of either monsoon.\n\nThe most interesting bird of the list is the Narcondam Hornbill,\nnot merely because it is endemic in that island,\u2014pointing to its arrival\nthere being an event of very considerable antiquity since it has had time\nto develop peculiarities that appear to entitle it to specific rank, and\nindicating moreover that the event is one which has recurred very in-\nfrequently, if at all\u2014but because, there being no Hornbills in the\nAndaman group proper, whence birds driven by the south-west mon-\nsoon must have been derived, we are led to conclude that it owes its\npresence in the island to the influence of the usually weaker north-east\nmonsoon.\n\nThe probabilities of the case are more compactly indicated in the\nsubjoined table.\n### Derivation of the Avifauna of Narcondam and Barren Island.\n\n| Species Introduced | Possibly | Certainly | Probably |\n|--------------------|----------|-----------|----------|\n|                    | Volunt.  | In-volunt.| Volunt.  | In-volunt.| Volunt.  | In-volunt.|\n| From India or Indo-China | 7        | ....     | 4        | ....     | 5        | ....     |\n| ,, Andamans or Malaya   | 9        | ....     | 5        | ....     | 7        | ....     |\n| By N.-E.

At the same time it is clear that the opposite monsoon, though blowing with less force and over a wider sea, is not altogether inactive, but on the contrary must be held accountable for the introduction of certain species which, though they have reached these islands from Indo-China, have not yet succeeded in passing beyond them to the Andaman Group proper. The precise extent of either influence it would however be premature, in the present state of our knowledge, to attempt to assess.\n\n4. **Further materials for a Malayan flora,**\u2014By Dr. G. King, F. R. S.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n5. **The Calcutta (Chatanati) Factory, first week of its History.**\u2014By the Rev. H. B. Hyde, M. A.\n\nJob Charnock and his party actually began their third and final\noccupation of the village of Chatanati on the 24th of August, 1690. This is the true foundation day of the City of Calcutta. There exists at the India Office a series of eleven volumes, extending to 1706 the first of which is entitled \"Diary and Consultation Book for affairs of the Rt. Hon'ble English, East India Company, kept by the Rt. Worshipful the Agent and Council beginning 16th July, 1690.\" From this the extracts following are taken. They disclose the state of things with which the Agent and Council had to contend during their first week of settlement.\n\nIt will be remembered that after a couple of months occupation of the village in the cold weather of 1686 and 1687, during which the Nawab's Commissioners gave him promises of recognition and support which their master refused to ratify, Charnock attacked the Thana forts, Higili and Balasore. About November of 1687, after some 9 months of this disastrous warfare, Charnock, a second time, attempted a settlement at Chatanati. On this occasion he remained nearly a year and erected some factory buildings. The Company's prospects in Bengal are not wholly unpromising when in September Captain William Heath, the Company's Naval Commander-in-Chief arrived and insisted in carrying off in his ship the whole of the officials of the factory. After a stay at Madras Charnock and the Bengal Council returned on the Princess and finally established the Chatanati factory.\n\nThe Diary above-mentioned records:\u2014\"1690, August 23rd. On board the Maddapollam.\" [The party had quitted the Princess, perhaps at Balasore, and had embarked on a Ketch to ascend the Hugly River.] \"Ordered Mr. William Skinner Pylott to leave the Madras Friggat and go on board the Maddapollam to help her go to Chutanuttee.\"\n\nThey ascended the River safely as far as Sankral, a village on the west bank of the river just below the present Botanic Gardens, and within sight of the Thana Fort which stood on the site, it is believed, of Dr. King's house and was then held by the Nawab's Government. The Diary continues:\n\n\"August, 24th. This day at Sankral ordered Captain Brooke to come up with his vessel to Chutanuttee where we arrived about noon; but found the place in a deplorable condition, nothing being left for our present accommodation and the rain falling day and night. We are forced to betake ourselves to boats, which considering the season of the year, is very unhealthy. Mullick Burcoorder and the country people at our leaving this place burning and carrying away what they could. On our arrival here the Governor of Tanna sent his servant with a compliment.\"\n\nThis Mullick had formerly been Governor of Hugly and in January 11th, 1684 had acted as one of the Nawab Shasteh Khan's three Mun-\nsubdars or Commissioners to treat with Charnock for the establishment of the new factory. The articles were concluded but the Nawab did not confirm them and it was believed the whole negociation were merely a ruse to secure to the Nawab time for his military preparations against the English. In November, 1687, he was again employed during the second settlement for a similar purpose, this time as sole Commissioner, and, though Captain Heath in his headstrong manner refused to listen to him, professing to believe that the recent death of Mullick's brother in war with the English had incurably prejudiced him against the Company's interests, he was apparently really desirous of adjusting peace. Heath on the 8th of November embarked Charnock and all his Council and subordinates on board his vessels and so abandoned the Chatanati factory buildings to be pillaged by the natives.\n\nMr. Henry Stanley and Mr. Mackrith had been sent on as Charnock's representatives to occupy Hugly. They arrived there about a fortnight before the latter reached Chatanati. Charnock anticipating that the commonest conveniences of life would be unobtainable on his arrival, wrote to Stanley to ask for supplies to which request Sir Henry Yule preserves a portion of a reply [H. D. ii, 283].\n\n\"The necessaries your worship, &c., gave us a note of are such of them as are ready to be had, herewith sent, viz.\n\n1 pr. of Gurras, 10 as. per pces [thought to be a sort of coarse cotton cloth, g\u00e1rh\u00e1].\n\n3 large Dishes of our own stores from Madrass.\n\n2 dozen of Trencher plates belonging to Mr. Croke, such as he sold for 2\u00bd rupees per corge [i.e., per score.]\n\nThe rest shall follow\"......\n\nOn Thursday, the 28th of August, the first consultation of the Bengal Council was held at the newly re-established factory, it is worth quoting in full from the Chatanati Diary:\n\n\"At a consultation\u2014Present.\n\nThe Rt. Worshipful Agent Charnock.\n\nMr. Francis Ellis.\n\nMr. Jere[miah] Peachis.\n\nResolved that a letter be sent to Mr. Stanley, &c., to come from Hugly and bring with them what Englishmen are there that the warr with the French may be proclaimed and also that Commissions be given to all command[ers] of ships in order to the prosecution of the same.\n\nIn consideration that all the former buildings here are destroyed, it is resolved that such plans be built as necessity requires and as cheap as possible, viz.\n\n1. A warehouse.\n2. A dining room.\n3. The Secretary's Office to be repaired.\n4. A room to sort cloth in.\n5. A cook-room with its conveniences.\n6. An apartment for the Company's servants.\n7. The Agent's and Mr. Peachie's house to be repaired which were part standing and a house to be built for Mr. Ellis, the former being totally demolished.\n8. The Guard House.\n\nThese to be done with mudd walls and thatched till we can get ground whereon to build a factory.\n\nResolved that 2000 maunds of wheat and 200 maunds horse grain be bought at Manloa [Mandoa?] that being the cheapest place and here to be provided 6000 maunds rice, 200 maunds butter and 200 maunds of oyle (and 200 maunds oyle) [sic] to be sent to Fort George.\n\nJob Charnock.\nFrancis Ellis.\nJeremiah Peachie.\n\nJ. Hill, Secretary.\n\nA few days later under date of August 31st, the Agent and Council record the following memorandum\u2014\n\n\"Received advices from Mr. Meverell at Ballasore that Captain Haddock departed this life the 23rd instant as also that a Portuguese vessel was arrived bringing news of the French Fleets coming to the bay and that the Dutch Commissary is coming with 4 shippes from Negapatam. Governor Pitt with 5 ships from Maddrass also Captain Heath from said place and that 3 Danes Shippes from Trincumbar are ready to joyne with them.\n\n\"September 5th. All the English according to order being arrived from Hughly, war was proclaimed against the French.\"\n\nThese hostilities against the French were the result of a declaration of war against that nation by King William dated 7th May, 1689, which by His Majesty's accession on the following 9th September, to the Treaty called \"The grand alliance\" implied a general attack on French trading interests throughout the world. The Dutch and Danish vessels mentioned in the foregoing memorandum were coming to support the British in their attack upon the French Indiamen.\n\nSo began a desultory naval warfare which lasted in Indian waters for several years.\n\nThe Chatanati Diary thus exhibits to us Charnock and his Council of 2, his few factors and his 30 soldiers passing the first week of what proved to be their final and successful attempt to found the factory\nwhich has become the City of Calcutta, under most deplorable circumstances.\n\nThey could not live ashore because of the excessive rain and because of their former mud-built houses only three were even partly standing; therefore they made the best of it in sloops and country boats, in addition to this they expected to be engaged in immediate war with the French.\n\nIt would seem that many months passed before they materially bettered their condition for from two extracts from the Fort St. George letters preserved by Sir Henry Yule, (which he says convey the whole information he had been able to collect respecting the first year or two of this establishment of Charnock's.) We learn that so late as May of the next year, 1691.\n\n\"They (in Bengal) could dispose of little [merchandize] nor have they safe goedowns to secure them from damage, and the truth is they live in a wild unsettled condition at Chuttinutee, neither fortified houses nor goedowns, only tents, huts and boats, with the strange charge of near 100 soldiers, guardship, &c.\"\n\nThis \"guardship\" suggests that they had not succeeded in erecting the projected guardhouse, and was apparently a \"great portuguez frigott\" purchased by Charnock for the purpose. [Hedge's Diary ii, pp. 87 and 88]. It is probable that the Mahomedan Government wholly prohibited the erection of anything like a defensible building by the English in the Chatanati village.\n\n6.

An account of an old inscription found at Burtr\u00e4 in the district of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r,\u2014By Munshi Debipershad of Jodhpore. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nBurtr\u00e4 is a village situated nearly 20 miles east of Jh\u00e1lor in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Here, under a tree, a stone was found about 1 foot 6 inches square, bearing an inscription in the N\u00e1gar\u00ed character. The villagers, believing that the stone marked the position of some hidden treasure, for a long time preserved it with great care, till they learnt the purport of the writing. From this it appears that the stone belonged to a well which was built by R\u00fap\u00e1devi, a daughter of Ch\u00e1cha, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jh\u00e1lor, and was consecrated by her, in the reign of her brother S\u00e1myanta Si\u0144ha, on Monday, the 7th Jyaishtha, Samvat 1340. It also appears from the inscription that R\u00fap\u00e1devi was married to Tejas Si\u0144ha, and had a son called Kshetra Si\u0144ha.\n\nThe stone is evidently a monument of the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jh\u00e1lor, who belonged to the Son\u00e1gira clan. It gives the following names:\u2014\n\n(1). Samara Si\u0144ha.\n(2). Udaya Si\u0144ha.\n(3). His son Ch\u00e1cha.\n(4). His son S\u00e1myanta Si\u0144ha.\n\nThe founder of this dynasty, Ketu, gained possession of the fort of Jh\u00e1lor in Samvat 1218. The name of the hill on which the fort was built was Son\u00e1giri, whence the family of Ketu were called Son\u00e1giras.\n\nThe son of Ketu was Samara Si\u0144ha, from whom Udaya Si\u0144ha was descended. According to Firishta, Shams-ud-D\u00edn Altamsh attacked Udaya Si\u0144ha in Samvat 1268 for not paying tribute, and reduced him to obedience.\n\nCh\u00e1cha, the son of Udaya Si\u0144ha, in Samvat 1319 built a temple to the goddess Ch\u00e1mun\u1e0d\u00e1, which was situated in a pleasant valley in Jaswant-pura, a district of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. S\u00e1myanta was Ch\u00e1cha's son. The inscription belongs to his reign.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Kanardeo, the son of S\u00e1myanta Si\u0144ha, fought bravely for many years with Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji, who attacked him in the fort of Jh\u00e1lor, but in Samvat 1368 the fort was taken, and Kanardeo was killed with his son Vir\u00e1mdeo. Maldeo, the brother of Kanardeo, who escaped, submitted to Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, and was made Kill\u00e1d\u00e1r of Chittor, as we learn from the Ain-i-Akbari.\nThere are still to be found in M\u0101rw\u0101r and Mew\u0101r many Sop\u0101gira Chauh\u0101ns who are descended from Maldeo.\n\n3.

An account of an old inscription found at Burtr\u00e4 in the district of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r,\u2014By Munshi Debipershad of Jodhpore. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nBurtr\u00e4 is a village situated nearly 20 miles east of Jh\u00e1lor in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Here, under a tree, a stone was found about 1 foot 6 inches square, bearing an inscription in the N\u00e1gari character. The villagers, believing that the stone marked the position of some hidden treasure, for a long time preserved it with great care, till they learnt the purport of the writing. From this it appears that the stone belonged to a well which was built by R\u00fap\u00e1dev\u00ed, a daughter of Ch\u00e1cha, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jh\u00e1lor, and was consecrated by her, in the reign of her brother S\u00e1myanta Si\u0144ha, on Monday, the 7th Jyaishtha, Samvat 1340. It also appears from the inscription that R\u00fap\u00e1dev\u00ed was married to Tejas Si\u0144ha, and had a son called Kshetra Si\u0144ha.\n\nThe stone is evidently a monument of the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jh\u00e1lor, who belonged to the Son\u00e1gira clan. It gives the following names:\u2014\n\n(1). Samara Si\u0144ha.\n(2). Udaya Si\u0144ha.\n(3). His son Ch\u00e1cha.\n(4). His son S\u00e1myanta Si\u0144ha.\n\nThe founder of this dynasty, Ketu, gained possession of the fort of Jh\u00e1lor in Samvat 1218. The name of the hill on which the fort was built was Son\u00e1giri, whence the family of Ketu were called Son\u00e1giras.\n\nThe son of Ketu was Samara Si\u0144ha, from whom Udaya Si\u0144ha was descended. According to Firishta, Shams-ud-D\u00edn Altamsh attacked Udaya Si\u0144ha in Samvat 1268 for not paying tribute, and reduced him to obedience.\n\nCh\u00e1cha, the son of Udaya Si\u0144ha, in Samvat 1319 built a temple to the goddess Ch\u00e1mu\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, which was situated in a pleasant valley in Jaswantpura, a district of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. S\u00e1myanta was Ch\u00e1cha's son. The inscription belongs to his reign.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Kanardeo, the son of S\u00e1myanta Si\u0144ha, fought bravely for many years with Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilj\u00ed, who attacked him in the fort of Jh\u00e1lor, but in Samvat 1368 the fort was taken, and Kanardeo was killed with his son Vir\u00e1mdeo. Maldeo, the brother of Kanardeo, who escaped, submitted to Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, and was made Kill\u00e1d\u00e1r of Chittor, as we learn from the A\u00edn-i-Akbari.\nThere are still to be found in M\u0101rw\u0101r and Mew\u0101r many Sop\u0101gira Chauh\u0101ns who are descended from Maldeo.\n\n3.

This arrangement was made about the year 1582, and is commonly ascribed to Rajah Todar Mal. Lists of the contents of the Sark\u00e1rs are given in the Ain, and Mr. Blochmann made much use of them when he was elucidating the old geography of Bengal. Unfortunately there are many errors in the MSS. of the Ain. Sometimes these can be corrected by referring to the lists in Tieffenthaler, but more effectual help is afforded by Grant's analysis in the Fifth Report, and by local knowledge. Grant's lists are those of Jaffar Khan's arrangement of 1722, but he also supplies the names of the old Sark\u00e1rs.\n\nThe object of this note is to compare the lists in the Ain with those in the Statistical Account of Bengal. I only do this for Moorshidabad, and I would suggest that similar comparisons be instituted for other districts. In this way the lists might appear in a correct form in the forthcoming translation of the second volume of the Ain.\n\nThe present district of Murshidabad is mainly comprised in Todar Mal's Sark\u00e1r of T\u00e1ndah, alias Audambar, alias Audner. This Sark\u00e1r extended southwards from Agmahal, i.e., Rajmahal and included parganas both in the Ra\u00f1h and the Bagri, that is, on both sides of the Bh\u00e1girathi, as far south as Chunakhali, or a little to the south of the town of Murshidabad. The rest of the Ra\u00f1h was included in Sark\u00e1r Sharifabad. The remainder of the district, i.e., the portion lying south and east of Chunakhali seems to have been included in Sark\u00e1rs Mahmudabad and B\u00e1rbak\u00e1b\u00e1d. The pargana of Plassey in the extreme south and which perhaps now wholly belongs to Nadia was included in Sark\u00e1r S\u00e1tg\u00e1on according to Grant. I cannot find it in the Ain, unless it is the Belkasi which is there entered as included in Mahmudabad. Belkasi is not very like Plassey, but in Tieffenthaler the name appears as Belessi.\n\nOn comparing the lists in the Ain, pp. 394-408 with that in the Statistical Account of Bengal, IX, 232-36, I find the following correspondences:\n\nI.

Laskharpur.\n\nI do not think that these lists are at all complete, nor will it be found that the spellings of the Ain and of the Statistical Account exactly agree. Indeed one of my objects is to show that they do not, and that the text of the Ain wants revision. Thus Chunakh\u00e1li is disguised in the Ain under the name of Jonagh\u00e1ti, and the old and extensive parganas of Gow\u00e1s and Gankar appear there as Kahas and Gankarah. Some well-known parganas do not appear at all in the Ain. For example, Ghi\u00e1s\u00e1b\u00e1d, which Grant places, no doubt correctly, in Shar\u00edfabad, is not mentioned in the Ain. Under Sark\u00e1r Mahmudabad, we find Babhangola and Barmapur. Can these be Bhagw\u00e1ngola and Berhampur?\n\nThe name Shar\u00edfabad for the Sark\u00e1r comprising the R\u00e1jh is interesting for it suggests the family of Husain Shah, the famous king of Gaur. An ancestor of his is said to have been Sharif of Mecca, and his father's name was Ashraf. Perhaps the latter gave his name to the pargana of Ashraf Bh\u00e1g. In the Ain this pargana appears under the name of Darsan Ashrafnahal, and in Tieffenthaler as Darsan Ashrafbh\u00e1l.\n\nI ought to mention that I have been assisted in making my lists by a valuable map in Col. Gastrell's report on Murshidabad, in which the principal parganas are shown.\n\nIf we had similar maps of other districts, or even with the aid of the pargana maps in the Survey Office, a map might be made of the 19 Sark\u00e1rs which would show the divisions of Bengal in 1582. Another might be made showing the Sark\u00e1rs of Orissa and Assam. A third map might be made showing Jaffar Khan's 13 Chaklas corresponding to the 34 Sark\u00e1rs of Todar Mal. No doubt the labour would be con-\nsiderable, and it would be necessary to make many local inquiries in order that the names of the parganas might be correctly given. But they would be valuable historical documents. Perhaps Mr. Beames, who has already done something for the geography of the Akbarn\u00e1ma, might undertake the task.\n\n5. Note on the Topography of the river in the 16th century from the H\u00fagli to the Sea as represented in the Da Asia of De Barros.\u2014By C. R. Wilson, Esq., M. A.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n6. Note on three North Indian Butterflies\u2014Euthalia nara, E. sahadeva, and E. anyte. By Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville, F. E. S., C. M. Z. S.\n\nEuthalia nara, Moore, E. sahadeva, Moore, and E. anyte, Hewitson, have always proved to be puzzling species both to collectors and cabinet naturalists. E. nara was described from a female, E. sahadeva from a male, and E. anyte also from a male. All three species occur in Sikkim. That region has been so thoroughly well worked entomologically of recent years that it is inconceivable that the opposite sexes of three such large butterflies should be still uncaptured, and, on looking over the material at my disposal in consequence of the receipt of a letter from Mr. H. J. Elwes, suggesting that E. sahadeva is the male and E. nara* the female of one species, I find that I can discriminate the opposite sexes of all the three species with ease. The short diagnoses given below will, I think, enable any one having specimens of these species to distinguish between them without difficulty. In \"The Butterflies of India,\" I described as the supposed male of E. nara, a specimen which now proves to be the true female of E. nara; what I, at the time of writing, took to be E. nara female turns out to be the true female of E. sahadeva. It is strange that Mr. Elwes should have omitted E. anyte from his \"Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of Sikkim,\" as it has been recorded from thence more than once. In the Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1891, p. 279, Mr. Elwes describes the supposed female of E. anyte.* I am unable to follow his description, nor can I agree with his conclusions, as I contend that E. nara and E. anyte are female and male respectively of one and the same species, which stands under the former name. Euthalia iva, Moore, described as a male from Darjeeling, is probably a female, and has still to be re-discovered.\n\n* Since this article was put into type I have heard again from Mr. Elwes, and he tells me that the specimens which he took to be the females of E. nara are really the opposite sex of E. sahadeva.\n1. **Euthalia nara**, Moore.\n\n*Adolias nara*, Moore, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., new series, vol. v, p. 78, n. 35, pl. viii, fig. 1, female (1859); id., Butler, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1868, p. 602, n. 17; *Euthalia nara*, de Nic\u00e9ville, Butt. of India, vol. ii, p. 197, n. 493 (1886); id., Elwes, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1888, p. 357, n. 175; *Adolias anyte*, Hewitson, Ex. Butt., vol. iii, *Adolias* pl. ii, fig. 5, male (1862); id., Butler, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1868, p. 603, n. 23; *Euthalia anyte*, de Nic\u00e9ville, Butt. of India, vol. ii, p. 198, n. 494 (1886); id., Elwes, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1891, n. 279.\n\n**Habitat**: *E. nara*:\u2014Unknown (Moore and Butler); Sikkim; N. Khasi Hills (de Nic\u00e9ville); Sikkim; Buxa, Bhutan, July and August; Khasia, 4,500 ft., September (Elwes); *E. anyte*:\u2014East India (Hewitson and Butler); Sikkim; Nepal (de Nic\u00e9ville); Sikkim; Bhutan; Naga Hills (Elwes).\n\nThe female of *E. nara* may be known from that sex of *E. sahadeva* by its smaller size; by its more golden (less greenish) bronzy colour on the upperside; by the posterior spot of the discal white band in the first median interspace of the forewing being very narrow and therefore appearing to be more elongated; and on the underside of both wings being more greenish (less golden) bronzy; and in the hindwing \u201cin the submarginal small black spots\u201d present in the true female of *E. sahadeva* \u201cbeing replaced by a diffused line darker than the ground-colour,\u201d this line being characteristic of the male of *E. nara* (*E. anyte*), while both sexes of *E. sahadeva* have a series of rounded black dots on the underside of the hindwing, one in each interspace except the submedian, which has two; these dots, moreover, being further removed from the outer margin than the diffused line is in both sexes of *E. nara*.\n\nIn Colonel A. M. Lang\u2019s collection a female of this species from Sikkim is correctly named.\n\n2. **Euthalia sahadeva**, Moore.\n\n*Adolias sahadeva*, Moore, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., new series, vol. v, p. 80, n. 39, pl. viii, fig. 3, male (1859); id., Butler, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1868, p. 601, n. 11; *Euthalia sahadeva*, de Nic\u00e9ville, Butt. of India, vol. ii, p. 199, n. 495 (1886); id., Elwes, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1888, p. 357, n. 176; *E. nara*, var., id., Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1891, p. 278.\n\n**Habitat**: Unknown (Moore); Nepal (Butler); Nepal; Sikkim; Assam (de Nic\u00e9ville); Sikkim (Elwes); *E. nara*, var.:\u2014Naga Hills (Elwes).\n\n**Female** (hitherto underscribed). **Expanse**: 3\u00bd to 4\u2153 inches. Differs from the female of *E. nara*, Moore, in its larger size. **Upperside**, forewing with the posterior spot of the discal band, broad, twice as broad as in *E. nara*. **Underside**, hindwing with a series of small round submarginal black spots, one in each interspace except the submedian, which has\ntwo. In the female of *E. nara* these spots are replaced by a continuous diffused line of a darker shade of colour than the ground, which, moreover, is placed considerably nearer the outer margin than is the series of black spots in *E. sahad\u00e9va*. The shape of the hindwing in both sexes is also characteristic, in *E. sahad\u00e9va* it is much more square, therefore broader, and less regularly rounded than in *E. nara*.\n\n*E. confucius*, Westwood, was described from China from a female specimen. Under this name are two specimens of what I consider to be the true female of *E. sahad\u00e9va* in Colonel A. M. Lang's collection, probably named by Mr. Moore; the latter probably also recording this species from Darjeeling in Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1865, p. 767, under the name of *E. confucius*. The female is figured by Messrs. H. Grose Smith and W. F. Kirby in \"Rhopalocera Exotica,\" pt. xvii, pl. *Euthalia* iii, figs. 1, 2 (1891), and differs from the same sex of *E. sahad\u00e9va* in having the discal band of the forewing much wider, and the spots on both wings yellow (\"stramineous\"), instead of white as in *E. sahad\u00e9va*. The male is said to be very similar to the female. It is an abundantly distinct species.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in May last.\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals,** presented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

R. Wilson read a short note on an old picture of the riverside in the north part of Calcutta in 1788.\n\nNote on an old Picture of the Riverside in the north part of Calcutta in 1788.\n\nThis picture is one of a set of nine pictures of old Calcutta in the possession of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. There is also a very large copy of it at Belvedere. The date is 1788. It obviously represents a house, temple, and bathing ghats, in the northern part of Calcutta. There is the steeple of a church in the distance. The difficulty is to determine the precise spot. I have spent a good deal of time in the attempt to do this. Remembering that the present Strand was once covered with water I have walked up and down the northern part of it, and have examined all the buildings which lie to the east of the roadway. I have thus discovered the temple and all that remains of the buildings seen in the picture.\n\nThe most conspicuous object in the picture is a large three-storied house built by the waterside and behind it a smaller two-storied house. The three-storied building, was in 1788, the Thakur Bari of Babu Jugul Kisore Addy, and the two-storied building was his house of residence. Babu Jugul Kisore had bought the land from a Madrassee called Naina P\u00e1 and built the Thakur Bari upon it. At his death the property came to his son Nanda Lal Addy who only survived his father a few years. The\nnext owner of the property was Nanda's son Doyal Chand Addy, who was in his day a distinguished resident of Calcutta. He was a great rider and kept a large stud of horses. I find his name in October 1806 as one of the signatories of an address to Sir Henry Russel then Chief Justice of Bengal. Doyal Chand died in 1835. His son Babu Raj Ballub Addy is still living and is an old man of 72. It is to him and to Babu Gaurd\u00e1s Bysack that I am indebted for my information about this old Calcutta family. The three-storied Thakur Bari is not now in existence. It is shown in Simms' Survey of Calcutta in 1849, but it has since been pulled down, and the site sold and covered with huts and sheds. The two-storied house is still standing in Dharmahatta Street at the corner of Darpa Naraian Tagore's Street. The house is much altered, but I have been all over it, and I am convinced that it is the same house as that shown in the picture.\n\nThe little temple is also still standing, but is almost hidden away from sight by a large shed belonging to Messrs. Ralli Bros. built close up beside it and behind it. It is a temple of Siva and belongs to a Biswas family.\n\nThe picture shows at least two ghats. I am a little uncertain as to their names. The one adjacent to the temple and immediately north of it was called the R\u00e1m Sit\u00e1 Ghat; the other to the south of this, according to the maps of Wood and Upjohn, was called Hurreenant Dewan's Ghat in 1785-95, but from some valuable maps which have been kindly lent me by Babu Gaurd\u00e1s Bysack it appears that in 1830 the R\u00e1m Sit\u00e1 Ghat had disappeared and that the second ghat was called the Seebtolah Ghat. This name, however, is given by Wood and Upjohn to another ghat further north of this spot which seems also to have disappeared by 1830. There were therefore in 1788 three ghats near this place\u2014the Seebtolah Ghat, the Ram Sita Ghat and Hurreenant Dewan's Ghat. The first two were subsequently done away with, and the name Seebtolah was transferred to the third ghat.\n\nThe spire in the distance belongs to the Armenian Church. The warehouses along the river side south of Jogul Kisore Addy's Thakur Bari have mostly disappeared, many of them having been pulled down to make room for the Mint.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1.

Note on the Indian and Malay Peninsula Butterflies comprised in the subgenus Stictoplea of the genus Euploea.\u2014By Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., F. E. S., C. M. Z. S.\n\nI recently received the following pathetic letter from the Rev. Walter A. Hamilton:\u2014\"I am to-day sending you by parcel-post a box containing 500 specimens of Euploea from the Khasi Hills. Will you kindly sort and name them for me? I have had to give it up, having nearly worn my eyes out in trying to discriminate between the various described species, the differences between which appear to be minute.\" The collection on examination consisted practically of two species, and as Mr. Hamilton was good enough to say I might keep any I required, I sorted them very carefully, and picked out specimens of all such as appeared to be in any way abnormal. I propose to deal in this Note with the Stictopleas. In Part VII of Mr. Moore's \"Lepidoptera Indica\" six species are given from Sikkim, Assam, and Burma. I give below a key to these species which graphically brings out the points on which Mr. Moore relies in separating them.\n\n**Key to certain Indian species of the subgenus STICTOPLEA.**\n\nA. Upperside, forewing with numerous spots on the disc in addition to the submarginal and marginal series.\n   a. Of large size; hindwing with complete submarginal and marginal series of spots.\n      E. (STICTOPLEA) HOPEI, Assam.\n   b. Of small size; upperside, hindwing in the male (as described) with three submarginal spots only, (six marginal spots figured); female with additional marginal spots.\n      E. (STICTOPLEA) PYGMEA, Assam.\n   c. Of large size; upperside, hindwing with three or two submarginal spots.\n      E. (STICTOPLEA) BINOTATA, Sikkim.\n\nB. Upperside, forewing with no spots on the disc, submarginal and marginal series of spots as in A.\n   a. Upperside, hindwing with complete submarginal and marginal series of spots.\n      E. (STICTOPLEA) HARRISII, Burma.\n   b. Upperside, hindwing with three submarginal spots.\n      E. (STICTOPLEA) CROWLEYI, Burma.\n   c. Upperside, hindwing immaculate.\n      E. (STICTOPLEA) REGINA, Assam.\n\nIn the work above referred to Mr. Moore does not record E. harrisii from the Malay Peninsula, though he previously* gave Malacca and Cochin China amongst other places as its habitat. Mr. Butler also in his original description of S. binotata records it from Borneo as well as\n\n* Proc Zool. Soc. Lond., 1883, p. 320, n. 4.\nfrom India. Mr. Moore in his Monograph of the *Euploea* does not record it from Borneo, but describes from thence *S. tyrianthina*. There is something mysterious about the latter species. Having originally described it from Borneo and Sumatra, Mr. Moore, in Lep. Ind., p. 138, records it from Sumatra only. In the original description it is said to be similar to *S. harrisii* on the upperside of the forewing, i.e., richly glossed with blue. But in Lep. Ind. it is said to be \"without the blue gloss.\" Again, in Captain Shopland's List of the Butterflies collected by him in Aracan, Burma, p. 4, *E. tyrianthina* is recorded. I am almost certain that there is no *Stictopteaa* in any part of India that is not blue-glossed, and as Captain Shopland most probably named his specimens at the British Museum, and as none but blue-glossed species occur in India, I think Mr. Moore must be mistaken in saying that the species is not blue-glossed. As originally described Mr. Moore placed it between two blue-glossed species (*S. harrisii* and *S. pygmaea*), and all the indications would go to show that it is a blue-glossed species, in which case it is probably another synonym of *E. harrisii*.\n\n*E. pygmaea* may, I think, be dismissed at once, as it is obviously only a stunted form of *E. binotata*. I possess from the Khasi Hills an even smaller specimen than the type, with which it agrees in markings. The two commonest forms in the Khasi Hills are *E. binotata* and *E. regina*, but the other three described species also occur there, but less commonly. Every gradation exists between the most heavily-marked *E. hopei* on the one side and the most sparsely-marked *E. regina* on the other, as represented in these Khasi Hill specimens, and I can come to no other conclusion than that we have here to deal with a single protean species which must stand as *E. (Stictopteaa) harrisii*, Felder. Although this single species has been split up into six by three different entomologists (Moore having described three, Felder two, and Butler one), this by no means exhausts the number of species which might be created on similar lines, as there is hardly any combination in the different arrangement of the discal spots of the forewing and the marginal and submarginal spots of both wings which might not be met with were sufficient material available; at any rate, in the nearly one hundred set specimens and two hundred unset ones now before me as I write, there are numerous individual specimens which are quite as distinct as any hitherto described. And the species is obviously variable throughout its range, though in the Khasi Hills of Assam, where it appears to be commonest, these variations are the most numerous, and comprise the extreme north-westerly (Sikkim) form which seems to always possess the discal spots on the\n\n* l. c., p. 320, n. 5.\nupperside of the forewing, and the southerly (Burma and Malay Peninsula) form in which these spots are invariably absent, but in which there is usually (not invariably) a prominent submarginal and marginal series of spots on the hindwing which are not usually found in the north-westerly form.\n\nI give below a brief description of the species as I think it should be known, together with its synonymy in full. In the latter I include the *Stictoplea microsticta* of Butler, described without locality, as it is a form which appears to occur commonly in the Khasi Hills. Mr. Moore says it is a broader-winged insect in both wings than *E. hopei*, but as will be found stated below, even the shape of the wings in this species is inconstant.\n\n**Euplexa (Stictoplea) harrisii**, Felder.\n\n*Euplexa harrisii*, Felder, Reise Novara, Lep., vol. ii, p. 328, n. 451, male (1865); *Stictoplea harrisii*, Moore, Journ.

UPPERSIDE, forewing glossed with magnificent blue throughout; two prominent black impressed elongated sexual brands in the submedian interspace placed one above the other, the anterior rather the shorter; marginal blue dots varying from none to nine, when present invariably commencing at the anal angle and never reaching the apex of the wing; a submarginal series of larger spots varying from five to eight, and shewing great variation in size; an angulated series of discal spots placed beyond the discoidal cell, varying from none to five, also very variable in size; a spot at the outer posterior end of the cell and another on the costa between the origin of the first and second subcostal nervules, both sometimes present, sometimes absent. Hindwing rich dark piceous, becoming lighter towards the costa, the latter broadly cinereous; marginal white dots none in some specimens, to a complete series of twelve in others; a submarginal larger series varying from nine to ten, very inconstant in size, when present always commencing from the apex of the wing; sometimes with, sometimes without two discal bluish-white spots divided by the third median nervule beyond the discoidal cell. Underside, both wings rich dark piceous; some white dots at the extreme base of the wings; the markings as above, but invariably much smaller, white, or bluish-white, as variable as on the upperside; sometimes with, sometimes without a spot at the end of each discoidal cell. Forewing with the inner margin broadly cinereous. Female differs from the male in the inner margin of the forewing being straight instead of strongly outwardly bowed, and in the absence of the sexual brands on the upperside, which are represented in some specimens by a small blue streak; all the markings on both sides in both wings as variable as in the male. Underside, forewing with two elongated bluish-white streaks in the submedian interspace. This latter marking is very useful, and by it a female Stictoplea can be at once identified, as it occurs in no other group of Euplea.\n\nThe shape of the forewing in this species shews considerable variation, some specimens being much broader than others, while the apex of the wing is also somewhat produced in some examples, much rounded in others.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in July last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

An account of an old copper plate Solankhi Mularaja,\u2014By Munshi Debiprasad. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis copper plate was produced in a M\u00e1rv\u00e1r court in A.D. 1872, and again in A.D. 1881, in connection with a law suit. It bears an inscription purporting to be a gift of land to a Br\u00e1hman who had come to M\u00e1rv\u00e1r from Kanauj. The Br\u00e1hman is called Durga Ach\u00e1rya, the son of D\u00farlabha Ach\u00e1rya. The land granted is described as the village Barnak in Satyapur [Sanchor] which was bounded by the four villages Banar Gandauk, and it is said to be the site of the modern village of Baler\u00e1m. The grant is made by the well-known Solankhi king Mularaja, and is dated Samvat 1051, M\u00e1gha Sudhi 15 on the occasion of the lunar eclipse. This date corresponds with Saturday, 19th January 995 A.D. when there was a lunar eclipse visible at La\u1e45ka.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in August last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAmsterdam.

S.\n\nIn the Proceedings of the Society for November last year, Mr. Tawney draws attention to the fact that in a collection of Jaina tales\u2014the Kath\u00e1 K\u00f3ta\u2014and also in the Kath\u00e1 Sarit S\u00e1gara, the Indian Kingships are occasionally described as bestowed by lot or ordeal, and Mr. Tawney invites further communications from other than Jaina sources. I find the same practice mentioned in a Buddhist work; viz., the Biography of the Indian Buddhist Monk Atisha (or Dipa\u0144k\u00e1ra) written by his lamaist pupil Bromton shortly after Atisha's death in 1050 A.D. And a variant of the same story appears in Tar\u00e1n\u00e1tha's History of Indian Buddhism under the Chapter on King Gop\u00e1la. In describing the origin of the P\u00e1la dynasty of Magadha, with the later members of which Atisha seems to have been intimately associated, his biographer states that the founder of the P\u00e1la dynasty (viz., Go-p\u00e1la) was originally a Yogi of The Middle Country who went to the shrine of Marici\u00b9 in the South of India and prayed for a kingdom and kingly knowledge to administer it. The image replied 'Go towards the East.' In obedience to this command the Yogi travelled eastwards, and latterly reached a city where the king was being changed, and at that time the kingship had fallen to the lot of the son of a female Cow-keeper who was giving way to her grief. The Yogi on enquiring about her trouble was informed that her son had just been elected king; and on asking why that was a cause for grief rather than joy, he was told that to be made the king of that country practically meant death. The Yogi then offered himself as a substitute for the Cow-keeper's son and was gladly accepted and installed as king. Now it had happened that the queen-consort of a previous king had on dying been reborn as a wicked N\u00e1gini, who regularly devoured all the subsequent kings on the first night after their installation. So this Yogi remained all night chanting his dhar\u00e1sis to his tutelary goddess Marici with sword\u00b2 in hand, and when the N\u00e1gini appeared in the form of a great serpent it was killed by the force of these mantras. In the morning, when the servants came as usual to remove the corpse of the king of the previous day, they were astonished to find the king alive and the N\u00e1gini dead instead. The Yogi was then confirmed in the Kingship and named Go-p\u00e1la although he was not really a Go-p\u00e1la or Cow-keeper, but only the Cow-keeper's substitute. And it is added 'Only Bhangala was under him.'\n\n\u00b9 Tar\u00e1n\u00e1tha calls the goddess Chanda.\n\u00b2 Tar\u00e1n\u00e1tha says 'with the staff emblematic of his tutelary goddess.'\n2. Identification of the old Orissan port of Chitratala, the 'Che-li-ta-lo' of Hiuen Tsiang.\u2014By L. A. Waddell, Esq., M. B., M. R. A. S.\n\nIn regard to few of the ancient Indian sites described by Hiuen Tsiang, have more widely divergent attempts at identification been made than in the case of the old Orissan port of 'Che-li-ta-lo.' St. Martin, Cunningham, Fergusson, &c., having each selected widely different sites, in various parts of Orissa and Western Bengal\u2014over 200 miles apart, and none of them satisfy the pilgrims' description even in a general way.\n\nThis wide divergence of opinion has been due partly to the want of local knowledge on the part of the writers and also to the geographical vagueness of the country of 'U-cha' in which this port was located, owing to the non-identification of the preceding capital of Karnasuvarna from which the pilgrims' route is calculated and described.\n\nIn a recent paper, I have fixed the site of the capital of Karnasuvarna as being almost certainly at K\u00e1nonnagar near the Kanchanagar suburb of Burdwan town. And by the same process which proved so successful in that deltaic inquiry, viz., by searching along the old rivers of the delta for the survival of the name and also taking into account the traditional capital and ports of the people, I have been led to determine locally the site of the Old Orissan port of 'Che-li-ta-lo.'\n\nAt the time of Hiuen Tsiang's visit, circa 640 A.D. Y\u00e1j\u00e1pur, was undoubtedly the capital of the country of 'U-cha'\u2014the northern portion of Orissa which lay to the south-west of Karnasuvarna, and to the north-east of 'Kong-u-tha' (Khordh\u00e1) north of Kalinga. Indeed the 'U-cha' of the pilgrim seems intended to represent the Sanskrit Y\u00e1-ja.\n\nHiuen Tsiang describes the port thus:\u2014\"On the south-eastern \"frontiers of the country (of U-cha) on the borders of the ocean, is \"the town of Che-li-ta-lo,\" about 20 li round. Here it is merchants\n\n---\n\n1 Memoires Contrees Occident., ii, 395.\n2 Ancient Geography of India.\n3 Jour. Royal As.

A. Waddell, published by The Government of Bengal, Calcutta, 1892.\n5 Still locally spelt as above, but usually pronounced 'J\u00e1ipur.'\n6 And a note by the Chinese editor states Fa-hing or 'city of departure'\u2014though it is not stated whether this is a definition of the site or the etymology of its name. Beal (H. Tsiang, II, p. 283) has shown that the second or 'Southern' Charitrapura of Julien has no place in the text.\n7 i.e., over 3 miles in circumference.\n\"depart for distant countries, and strangers come and go and stop here \"on their way. The walls of the city are strong and lofty. Here are \"found all sorts of rare and precious articles. Outside the city are five \"convents one after the other; their storeyed towers are very high and \"carved with figures of the saints exquisitely.\"1\n\nIn the locality here indicated\u2014in exact keeping geographically with the distances and directions noted by the pilgrim\u2014in the Mahanadi delta, about 15 miles below Cuttack, we find the older channel of the great Mahanadi River is still known as the 'Chitratola River,' although no village or town of that name now exists on its banks. But at the highest point of this part of the Mahanadi channel, where the name of Chitratola still clings to this branch of the Mahanadi, at the village of Nendra, opposite Kendwapatana lock of the Kendrapara canal, the villagers point out the site of the old port on what is now a vast expanse of sand in the river bed. And they relate the tradition that the town and port of Chitratola which stood there, was cut away by the river long before the Mahratta occupation of Orissa; and that most of its inhabitants removed to the northern bank of the river and further down the delta to Kendwapatana and Kendrapara.\n\nThe former proximity of this port, the sea and its tidal character, are attested by the name of the other branch, here given off by the Chitratola River, viz., the Nun Nadi or 'The Salt River,' which again joining the Chitratola River further down, discharges into the sea at False Point. And along the Chitratola and Nun Rivers is found growing luxuriantly the dwarf Screw-pine which fringes the salt-water swamps near the sea.\n\nThe site of Chitratola is now inland about 50 miles from the present coast line and about 15 miles above tidal limits\u2014the seabord having retired before the immense amount of silt brought down by the Mahanadi from the Central Indian Highlands, from a hill-area, according to Hunter,2 of 45,000 square miles. And, as the Mahanadi delta is very short and deep, the alluvial accretion must have buried up much of the remains seen by the pilgrims over 1,200 years ago. The great demand also for blocks of stone to stay the erosions of the Mahanadi River and latterly for the irrigation and transit canals must have consumed most of the superficial stones.\n\nBut there are still a good many old remains in the high tract immediately to the south of and continuous with the eroded site of Chitratola, consisting of several old tanks, carved lateritic blocks strewn throughout the adjoining villages of Nendra and Manikpur; and several\n\n1 Hiuen Tsiang, BEAL's Translation, II, 205.\n2 Orissa, I, 47.\nold Jaina and Saivic Hindu images of laterite and basalt enshrined in buildings of great carved laterite blocks rudely piled together, and evidently survivals of the wreck of former temples, thus preserved by the inhabitants of these decayed villages. I had no leisure to explore the neighbourhood, but a careful search through the adjoining villages on both banks of the rivers would doubtless reveal numerous other remains and traces of the Buddhist convents which were in its neighbourhood. I was informed that many carved stones exist in the adjoining villages of Samitunga, Santpur, Santolo, Bandapur\u2014one to two miles to the south of Nendra.\n\nThe modern restoration of Huen Tsiang's phonetic transcription of the name of this port, as adopted by Julien, and followed by subsequent writers, vis., 'Charitra' is thus doubtfully correct. The original name seems more nearly to resemble or be identical with the still current name\u2014'Chitratola.' Most of the Orissan place-names of a Sanskritic origin are found to have preserved their medi\u00e6val form remarkably well. The pargana or parish between this site and the present seabord is called 'Chhedra Kila' in the old Muhammadan maps. And the relatively recent formation of this part of the delta is well seen in the adjoining parganas which are named Suknai or 'the dry,' and Nayakhand or 'the new tract.'\n\nThis identification is of considerable geological interest, as it affords data for estimating the rate of the process of deltaic land-formation within the past 1,250 years.\n\n3. Note on the 'Ma-gu-ta' or Cha-rung Kh\u00e1-shar Stupa\u2014a celebrated place of Lamaist pilgrimage in Nepal.\u2014By L. A. Waddell,\n\nM. B., M. R. A. S.\n\nOne of the celebrated places of Lamaist pilgrimage, outside Tibet, is the Ch\u00e1-l-rung kha-shar Chh\u00f6-rten, about two miles to the north-east of Khatmandu. Immense numbers of Tibetans, both lamas and laity, visit the place every winter and encamp in the surrounding field for making their worship and offerings and circumambulating the sacred spot. It is the chief place of lamaist pilgrimage in Nepal, attracting far more votaries than the Sambhun\u00e1th Stupa, which is not far distant. Its special virtue is reputed to be its power of granting all prayers for worldly wealth, family and everything else asked for. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, in his account of Nepal, written about the beginning of the present century, gives a drawing of the monument, which is of a almost simple hemispherical form, of the type of the earliest stupas; and Wright under the title of 'Temple of Bodhn\u00e1th' gives a rough chromo-\n\n\u00b9 Spelt pya. \u00b2 Nepal, pp. 22, 100.\nlithograph of its more modern appearance with its additional buildings and investing wall. But no description or account of the monument seems to be on record.\n\nAs I have obtained a copy of the printed booklet which is sold at the stupa to the pilgrims, I here give a short abstract of its contents, which are interesting as showing how the Stupa is brought into intimate relations with the chief legendary and historic persons of early Lamaism. The print is a new revision by Punya Vajra and another disciple of \"the great Lama Zhab-dkar.\" This latter Lama, I am informed, lived about thirty years ago, and gilded the short spire of the stupa and built the present investing wall.\n\nThe book states as follows:\n\n\"This Stupa enshrines the spirit of the Buddhas of the ten directions, and of the Buddhas of the three times, (i.e., the present, past and future), and of all the Bodhisatwas, and it holds the Dharma-k\u0101ya.\n\n\"When King Thi Srong Detsan\u00b9 asked The Guru,\u00b2 at Samyas,\u00b3 to tell him the history of the Ma-gu-ta stupa in Nepal, made by the four sons of 'the bestower of gifts' named 'the poor mother Pya-rdsi-ma (Fowl-keeper),' then the Guru thus related (the story):\n\n\"In a former Kalpa\u2014time beyond conception\u2014the Bodhisatwa Mah\u00e1satwa Avalokitesvara, approached the Tathagatha Amitabha and prayed for the animals immersed in the miry slough, and after saving these he went to Mount Pot\u015bla. There he saw hosts of unsaved animals, innumerable like unto mounds of murwa\u2074 lees, and (seeing this he) wept. Two of his pitying tears were born into Indra's heaven as god's daughters, named respectively Kangma and the Little Kang-ma or Kang-chhung-ma. This latter having stolen in heaven some flowers, was as a punishment, reborn in earth, in a low pigherd's family in Maguta in Nepal, under the name of Sambhara or 'the Chief Happiness,' her mother's name being Purna. On marriage she had four sons, and her husband's early death left her with the sole care of the family. She with her family undertook the herding and rearing of geese for the wealthy, and in this pursuit having amassed much wealth, she\u2014Ma-pya-rdsi-ma (or mother Fowl-keeper)\u2014decided to build a large Stupa in honor of the Tathagatha. She, thereon, went to the king and begged for a site, saying, she wanted only so much ground as one hide could cover.\n\n\u00b9 The king of Tibet who introduced Lamaism.\n\u00b2 i.e., Padma Sambhava, or Ugyan the founder of Lamaism.\n\u00b3 The first lamaist monastery in Tibet.\n\u2074 The millet seed (eluine crocanum) about the size of mustard seed, from which is made the Himalayan beer.\nThe king assented saying, 'Oha-rung,' which literally means 'do' + 'can,' i.e., 'you can do (so)'1. Then she cutting a hide into thin thongs (forming a long rope) enclosed that very large space which now is occupied by this chaitya. And she, with her four sons, and a servant, and an elephant and an ass, as beasts of burden, brought earth and stones and commenced to build this chaitya by their own personal labour.\n\n\"Then the king's ministers appealed to the king to stop such an ambitious building, as they asserted its magnificence put to shame the religious buildings of the king and the nobles. But the king answered 'Kha-Shor'\u2014which literally means 'mouth + (has) spoken'2\u2014and so refused to interfere. (Thus is the name of the Stupa\u2014'Charung Kha-shor'\u2014accounted for).\n\n\"After four years, when only the base had been laid, the mother died, but her sons continued the building till its completion. And in the receptacle was placed one Magadha measure (drona) of the relics of the Tathagatha Ka\u015byapa. This event was celebrated by the manifestation in the sky, above the Stupa, of Ka\u015byapa himself, and the circles of celestial Buddhas and Bodhisatwas, and their hosts of retinue, and amongst showers of flowers the gods contributed divine music and rained perfume. Earthquakes thrice occurred, and through the glory of the assembled divinities there was no darkness for five nights.\n\n\"One of the sons then prayed 'May I in my next rebirth be born as a great scholar (to benefit mankind)'\u2014and he was born as Thonmi Sambhota3\u2014the introducer of the so-called 'Tibetan' character and the first translator of Indian Buddhist texts into Tibetan) circa 650 A.D.\n\n\"The second son prayed in a similar manner, and was reborn as 'The Bodhisatwa'4\u2014the abbot of the first monastery of Tibet.\n\n\"Then the elephant or lang-po (hearing these prayers) said 'These two neglecting me, who contributed so much assistance, are asking all the good things for themselves, therefore, let me be reborn in a form to destroy them or their work.' And he was afterwards reborn as Langdarma\u2014the persecutor of Lamaism.\n\n\"The third son, hearing the elephant's request, prayed that he might be reborn in a form to neutralize the evil of the elephant's incarnation; and he was born as Hlo-lung phel kyi rdorje\u2014the lama who murdered Langdarma, the Julian of Lamaism.\n\n1 This story, and indeed the greater part of the legend, seems to have its origin in a false etymology of the proper names.\n2 Vide previous footnote.\n3 The 750 who introduced to Tibet of a written character, and the first Tibetan translations from the Indian Scriptures.\n4 The Indian Buddhist monk Santarakshita who was the abbot of the first monastery of Tibet (Samayas).\nThis Stupa is also worshipped by the Nepalese Buddhists, viz., the Newars\u2014the semi-aborigines of the Nepal valley, and the Murmi, a cis-Himalayan branch of Tibetan stock. The name 'Maguta'\u2014pronounced 'Makuta'\u2014is doubtless a contraction for Makuta bandhana, the pre-Buddhist 'crested chaitya' such as existed at Buddha's death at Kusinagara, in the country of the Mallas\u2014a tribe which I believe to be the same which penetrated latterly to the adjoining country of Nepal and there established the 'Mall' dynasties.\n\n4. Burmese Buddhist Rosaries.\u2014By L. A. Waddell, M. B., M. R. A. S.\n\nIn my contribution on Lamaic Rosaries I made incidental reference to the rosary as used by the Southern Buddhists. I have now, mainly through the kindness of Mr. Monng Hpo Myin of Rangoon, obtained a set of the various kinds of rosaries used by the Burmese Buddhist monks and also some interesting information on the subject.\n\nThe rosary is admitted by the learned Burmese monks or phungyis to be of comparatively recent introduction into Burmese Buddhism, where it has been in use for some centuries at least. Its exact time and mode of introduction is, however, unknown; but it is believed by the Burmese monks to have been unknown in, and not obtained from, Indian Buddhism. And in this connection I may note that in none of the many Indian Buddhist sculptures, and Ajanta frescoes examined by me\u2014even the most modern\u2014have I found a rosary in the hands of the monks or as a part of their outfit. My own opinion is, that it was probably brought to Burma from India by pilgrims during the latest Tantric stage of Buddhism about the 11th cent. A.D., when, according to the more reliable Tibetan accounts, the rosary held a conspicuous place in the mystical and highly impure form of Buddhism then existing throughout India.\n\nNow-a-days in Burma it is quite exceptional to find any monk or lay devotee without a rosary; and the monks support their use of it by a quotation from one of Buddha's own sutras or sermons in the collection of the Tika Anguttara Nikaya, which is believed by many to date to the first Council in the year of Buddha's death, and in which occurs the following passage:\n\n\"Upasathan upawasanena paruparodhapati sangutta kammanita navita rotappa, khayavayagananum karontena vitinamitabhan.\" Which \"may be translated\u2014\"Those who observe uposatha should pass their\n\"time in counting the number of times of decay and of the breaking up of all nature.\" The occurrence here of the word 'counting' is held to justify the use of the rosary.\n\nThe rosary is known by its Burmese name of *Tsi-puth* \u1e62a\u1e45gh\u0101 which literally means 'the mind garland,' i.e., the meditation-rosary, and the exercise of telling the beads is believed to facilitate the abstraction of the mind from worldly matters and its concentration on the topics enunciated.\n\nLike the lamaist rosary it consists of 108 beads, corresponding, it is alleged, to the 108 symbols on Buddha's sole or foot-prints.\n\nIts general form is the same as that of the Bo-dhi-tse rosary of the gelukpa Lamas, except in the absence of the strings of 'counters' of the latter. The central bead, through which the two ends of the rosary string are passed, is extra to the 108, and it is surmounted, as in the gelukpa rosary, by two or more beads, spherical and discoid in shape, to form a vase.\n\nThe material of which the beads are made varies according to the taste and means of the owner, or in the case of the monks, the donor, of the rosary. The most common rosary consists of beads made from cocoa-nut shell, darkened by steeping in oil, and turned on a lathe into ovoid, spherical or discoid beads. Beads are also turned from the black heart wood of a certain tree, from the bones and tusks of elephants, the horn of the bison, &c. The rosaries of varnished pellets, noted in my previous paper,\u00b9 are also not uncommon. Light and tiny rosaries of amber, &c., are mostly used by ladies. A most rare and costly rosary found occasionally amongst the wealthy lay devotees is formed of compressed sweet scented flowers, pressed into cakes of a wood-like hardness and then turned on a lathe into beads. Such beads retain their perfume, it is said, for ages. This is the nearest approach to the more primitive rosary viz., a garland of flowers.\n\nThe rosary formula in most common use amongst the Burmese Buddhists is, as previously noted by me, the pessimistic *Trividy\u00e1*: *Anitya, Dukha, Anatta*\u2014'All is transitory, painful and unreal!'\n\nAfter this, the next most common use to which the rosary is put is to tell off the attributes of Buddha, and less frequently the attributes of The Three Holy Ones.\n\n\u00b9 The number in that case should also have been given as 108, the particular rosary seen by me at that time having been broken and incomplete.\nThe late king Thebaw's father was a great patron of the rosary, and used to bestow it freely as a royal gift.\n\n5. Graeco-Roman Influence on the Civilization of Ancient India. Supplementary Note.\u2014By V. A. Smith, Esq., M. R. A. S., Indian Civil Service.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n6. De Ranunculaceis Indicis Disputationes\u2014Scripsit P. J. Br\u00fchl.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe present paper is the first of three which will deal chiefly with those species of Ranunculaceae which grow within the limits of the Indian Empire, and in those countries which can, or might be reached by travellers making India their base. We shall, however, also refer incidentally to species growing in more distant places, whenever the subject matter renders it desirable for us to do so. In the preface we have a few words to say about the material which has been the object of our investigations and about a certain abbreviated notation, grown out of one used by Professor Drude, which we have found convenient to use.\n\nWe have thought it expedient to devote a whole paper to Aquilegia, about which there appears to exist a good deal of confusion in various herbaria; thus in Boissier's Supplementum we find reference made, under the name of Aquilegia pubiflora, to a form which is only indirectly related to that Wallichian species. When endeavouring to bring order and law into the chaos of Indian forms, we found ourselves compelled to extend our studies over the whole genus. The American specimens in the Calcutta Herbarium are, however, not numerous enough, to write a detailed monograph of the whole of the species, although their number is sufficiently large to investigate their true relationships and come to certain definite conclusions with respect to the degree of variability exhibited by the species which group themselves round A. formosa.\n\nWe have consequently concentrated our attention chiefly on the group of species or varieties which arrange themselves round the typical A. vulgaris as a centre and, as it appears, as a parent form. We may also state that our investigation, which has, of course, been directed more especially to the Indian Aquilegias, has led us to the same result at which Hooker and Thomson arrived years ago when studying European and Asiatic Aquilegias in connection with the publication of the Flora Indica; that is to say, all the so-called Himalayan and\nEuropean, together with several Siberian species are only varieties which branch off from the genuine Aquilegia vulgaris and which, notwithstanding a frequently striking diversity in aspect, are still connected with the parent form by traceable links. Such connecting links exist especially in that region where the Himalaya, the Kara Korum, the Kuenlun, and the Hindu Kush meet, a fact which is not without significance. We are convinced that the number of species has been unduly multiplied by botanists who, having a sharper eye for differences where they exist than for intermediate forms in which those differences do not exist, attribute too great importance to characters which, in the nature of things, are essentially variable. We shall, however, not follow up the subject any further, but confine ourselves to stating the main results to which our investigation of the genus Aquilegia has led us. They are the following:\n\n1. Neither the presence nor absence, nor the nature of the indumentum of the vegetative parts can serve as specific characters.\n\n2. The leaves are so variable as regards degree of division and shape and size of leaflets, that it is absolutely impossible to separate species by them.\n\n3. All parts of the flower which have reference to cross-fertilization by insects are essentially variable.\n\n4. The close relationship of the various forms of Aquilegia explains the ease with which they form hybrids.\n\n5. Plants, the same in all essential characters, may originate in regions which are widely apart, not only from the same parent form, but also from essentially different varieties.\n\n6. Forms belonging to the same variety may sometimes be found in distant places in consequence of some younger variety reverting to the parent type in regions into which the latter has not penetrated directly.\n\n7. The genus Aquilegia is one of the more recent among Ranunculaceae, being probably derived from the parent form of Isopyrum grandiflorum and Isopyrum microphyllum, and exhibiting also relationships to I. anemonoides and I. biternatum.\n\n8. The genus Aquilegia appears to have originated in Eastern Asia, and spread from its birth-place in two streams, one invading Europe and spreading into the Himalaya along the ranges which form the western boundary of the ancient Gobi Sea, the other overrunning North-America and forking off through the hills of China proper towards the eastern termination of the Himalaya.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part II.\n7. Notes on the Banks of the Hugli in 1495.\u2014By Pandit Haraprasad Shastri.\n\nThe writings and researches of Messrs. Bloehmann, Long, Marshman, Gurdas Bysak, and, last though not the least, of Mr. Wilson our Philological Secretary, have roused an interest in the Antiquities of the Capital of the British Empire, and the places in its vicinity, and people are doing their best to search into old records in order to bring new and interesting facts to light, and as an humble worker in the same field, I beg to approach you, though with diffidence, with a paper on the subject.\n\nIn the course of my search for Sanskrit Manuscripts I came across in a rather out of the way corner of Bengal, viz., far in the Barasat Sub-Division, two bundles of Bengali Manuscripts. One of the bundles proved on examination to be the \"Manasar Bhadsan,\" by the joint authorship of Kshem\u00e1nanda and Ketak\u00e1d\u00e1s; the other bundle contained three works, the first is a copy of the \"Manasar Bh\u00e1sin,\" the second a work on Manasa, or the Goddess of serpents, by a perfectly unknown author named Biprad\u00e1s. This work is incomplete. It has only 31 leaves without the first page; and the third is also an incomplete copy of the same work without the first page. The first 45 pages of the second fragment are written on old paper, and in old handwriting, and the rest with a new pagination is written on more modern paper and in newer handwriting.\n\nThe name of Biprad\u00e1s as a Bengali poet, is not at all known. In both the copies he gives copious information about himself, about the time in which he wrote, and the circumstances under which the book was written. He belonged to the R\u00e1hiya distribution of Brahmans in Bengal; he was a descendant of B\u00e1tya Muni, and the village which his Bengali ancestors obtained from the descendants of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Adi\u00e1\u00far who brought the five Brahmans in Bengal, was Pippalai. He professed the S\u00e1ma Veda in its Kauthuma S\u00e1kh\u00e1. He lived from his earliest childhood at Batagram near B\u00e1dur\u00ed\u00e1. The readings of the two copies of the name B\u00e1dur\u00ed\u00e1 do not agree. In one place it is distinctly B\u00e1dur\u00ed\u00e1 and in another it is Namury\u00e1. The year is indicated by the words \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f \u0935\u0947\u0926 \u0938\u093e\u0927\u093f that is \u0967\u096a\u0967\u096d. By the well-known rule of inverting the digits we come to the Saka year 1417, and this is corroborated by the fact that the author mentions Hussain Shah as the reigning Sultan of Bengal. Saka 1417 is 1495 A.D., that is, three years before Vasco de Gama landed at Calicut. Chaitanya was then only ten years of age. The writer says that the Goddess of serpents inspired him in a dream to write a poem in her honour. This is the stereotyped way of pleading divine inspiration for writing poetry. It is a fact, however, that the worship of the goddess\nof serpents was very prevalent in those days. It was an easy way for Brahmans to get into fortune. In Chaitanya's early youth people advised him to take to the worship of this goddess if he wanted wealth. But he refused to listen to them. The examination of a few pages shews that Biprad\u00e1s possessed poetical powers of no mean order, and that he knew much of serpents and their life-history. The portion of the book, with which we are concerned, is where he describes the voyage of Ch\u00e1nd Sad\u00e1g\u00e1r, who hated the goddess of serpents and did his best to put a stop to her worship, but after much persecution by the avenging goddess, was at last obliged to submit to her worship. His voyage commences at Champ\u00e1inagar which is sometimes identified with Champ\u00e1nagar, the modern Bhagalpur.* His small fleet consisting of seven vessels passed by Raj-gh\u00e1t, which had not yet got its modern name Rajmahal; then it passed by R\u00e1me\u015bvara and Dharma-kh\u00e1n, places which cannot be identified, before it came to where the Ajaya meets the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. Passing by a small place named Uj\u00e1in where a mel\u00e1 is still held annually, the fleet came to the confluence of the S\u00edva with the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed: then the fleet anchored at Indra Gh\u00e1t near Catwa. Catwa is still one of the chief places of trade in the district of Burdwan, and the Purgana in which it is situated is called Indr\u00e1ni. Indra Gh\u00e1t means one of the 12 Gh\u00e1ts in the Purganna Indr\u00e1ni, both the Purgana and the Gh\u00e1t deriving their names from the worship of Indra. The author says that the merchant worshipped Indra at this place. Pandit R\u00e1ngati Ny\u00e1yaratna, the historian of Bengali literature, speaks of an Indr\u00e9\u015bvar S\u00edva in this Purgana, from which it may be inferred that, as in other parts of India, the primitive worship of the rain-god gave way to that of the more popular gods S\u00edva, Vishnu, &c., which was very prevalent in those days. Then the fleet passed by the well-known places named Nadiya, Amba (modern Calna) Fuli\u00e1, on the other side of the river, Guptip\u00e1r\u00e1 and Mirz\u00e1pur, and came at last to Triven\u00ed, the famous junction of the three rivers. In this list, Mirz\u00e1pur is nearest to Navadv\u00edpa, then Calna, then Fuli\u00e1, then Guptip\u00e1r\u00e1 and after that Triven\u00ed. The writer puts Mirz\u00e1pur last which is curious. At Triven\u00ed the Sad\u00e1g\u00e1r lands to have a look at Satgaon, the great emporium of trade. Then follows a description of Satgaon and its wealth. Hindus and Muham-madans lived in peace and enjoyed equally the prosperity of the city and its surrounding country. The merchant stopped there for two days and then recommenced his downward voyage. The first place after\n\n* There are many places in Bengal which claim the honor of being the birth place of Ch\u00e1nd and each has some authority to support its claim.\npassing Triveni, was Kum\u00e1rhatta, an important Br\u00e1hmanic settlement of very ancient date. Its modern name is H\u00e1risahar in the district of 24 Purganahs. Kum\u00e1rhatta was on the left; on the right however, he saw Hugli, modern Hugli. It was at this place that the Portuguese settled early in the 16th century to have a share of the commerce of S\u00e1tgaon. Hugli was even before the settlement of the Portuguese, a place of some importance, otherwise the Portuguese would not have settled there. Some people think that the name Hugli was given to the place by the Portuguese, its ancient name being Golin. But Biprad\u00e1s who writes before the arrival of the Portuguese in India, mentions it by its proper name Hugli. Then it mentions on the left Bh\u00e1tp\u00e1r\u00e1, and on the right Boro. Chinsura and Chandannagar are not mentioned at all. Bh\u00e1tp\u00e1r\u00e1 is a very ancient settlement of R\u00e1hiya Brahmans. The Vaidika Brahmans of Bh\u00e1tp\u00e1r\u00e1 who now occupy a prominent position in Bengal were not as yet settled at the place. Boro is now a very insignificant place lying within the French territory of Chandannagar, with a local goddess K\u00e1l\u00ed named Bor\u00e1i Chanq\u00ed. On the other side of Boro is mentioned K\u00e1nk\u00edn\u00e1r\u00e1, which also is now an insignificant place. The mention of these small places in preference to others of more importance in modern times, shews that the text of the book has not been altered in copying. In fact in a rare work like this the chances of interpolation and tampering with the text are much less than in the case of well-known books which enjoy great popularity. Then on the east are mentioned Mul\u00e1jore and G\u00e1\u00f1\u00faruli\u00e1, places which still exist, and contain old Br\u00e1hmanic settlements, and on the west Paikp\u00e1r\u00e1, which is a very insignificant hamlet now, to the south of Telinip\u00e1r\u00e1, and Bhadre\u015bvar, a well-known place for trade in grains. Then on the two sides of the river are described two villages, viz., Ch\u00e1mpd\u00e1n\u00ed and Ich\u00e1pur, places which are still well-known in Bengali Society. Then on the Eastern side of the river is mentioned a place named B\u00e1nkit\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2014which was anciently a place of some importance, as in the year 1725 A.D. the Ostend East Indian Company, established by Charles VI, the Emperor of Germany, father of the celebrated Maria Theresa, made their factory at this place. For eight years they carried on a lucrative trade at B\u00e1nkit\u00e1z\u00e1r, but were expelled from the Indian soil in the year 1733 by the united efforts of the English at Calcutta, the Dutch at Chinsur\u00e1 and the Fouzd\u00e1ra of Hugli. The exact site of the factory and of B\u00e1nkit\u00e1z\u00e1r was long a matter of speculation, but the present manuscript settles it, as being on the other side of Ch\u00e1mpd\u00e1n\u00ed. It is in fact situated two miles to the north of Baracipur on the river, and it belongs to Aunapurn\u00e1 D\u00e9vi of Calcutta. Beyond B\u00e1nkit\u00e1z\u00e1r, but on the other side of the river, is mentioned the celebrated Nim\u00e1i\nTirtha, in which was situated the holy Nim* tree which was supposed to produce the red Jab\u00e1.\u2020 It was a small place of pilgrimage, and is still regarded as a Ghat of the Ganges specially holy.\n\nThen comes Dvig\u00e1nga, a double river, because a branch of the Sarasvat\u00ed fell here into the Ganges and is still known as the Baidyabdiir Kh\u00e1l. There is a small place here which still is known as Digg\u00e1nga and gives its name to a family of Br\u00e1hmans who live there. Then the merchant passes by Ch\u00e1nak, which is wrongly supposed to derive its name from Job Charnock, the founder of Calcutta. It is a much older place than Job Charnock and a old settlement of Hindu Bhudraloks. Here is mentioned the Burania country. What can be the meaning of the words Burani\u00e1r De\u00e9? It may be the region of floods or it may mean the region inhabited by \u092c\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e people, i.e., the divers. The first meaning appears to give a better sense as below Ch\u00e1nak the country is low. On the other side of Ch\u00e1nak are mentioned R\u00e1mn\u00e1n, Akn\u00e1 and M\u00e1he\u015ba, but Sr\u00edr\u00e1mpur is not mentioned. M\u00e1he\u015ba had an image of Jagann\u00e1th, the priest of which in Chaitanya\u2019s time was Kama-l\u00e1k\u00e1r Pippal\u00e1yi, a man belonging to the same family with the author. Then on the Ch\u00e1nak side of the river is mentioned Khardaha. It is one of the oldest and most respectable settlements of the R\u00e1h\u00edya Br\u00e1hmans, one endogamous group of whom derives its name from this place. It had not yet become the chief place of Chaitanya Vaishnavism: yet it is called Srip\u00e1th, an epithet which is used as an honorific epithet for the residence of one\u2019s spiritual guide. Khardaha was perhaps the place where the author\u2019s Guru resided. On the western bank are mentioned Rishira, Konnagar and on the east Sukchar, Kotrang, K\u00e1m\u00e1rh\u00e1ti, Ariadaha and Ghusuri are also mentioned before the fleet reaches Chitpur, with its ancient temple dedicated to the Sarvamangal\u00e1 Devi. After passing Chitpur on the eastern side, mention is made of Calcutta. It is a mere mention, just as that of Ariadaha or Ghusuri or Sukhchar. More prominent mention is made of course of Betor, on the other side of the fort, with its ancient temple of Bet\u00f3\u00ed Cha\u1e47\u1e0d\u00ed where the merchant comes down to pay his homage to the Goddess, and where he and his men take some rest, to do some shopping and prepare their mid-day meal. Betor was a place of trade, and it seems to have had a market. It was to Satgaon, what Zedda is to Mecca. Passing by a place named Dhaland\u00e1, the name of which still survives in the Daland\u00e1 Lunatic Asylum at Alipur, the fleet comes to K\u00e1ligh\u00e1t, where the merchant offers his worship to the Goddess. Then he passes Chur\u00e1gh\u00e1t, which is perhaps Chur\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1, a market town a few miles below K\u00e1ligh\u00e1t included within the South Suburban Municipality, Jayadh\u00fali, Dhanasth\u00e1n, and then comes to B\u00e1ruipur.\n\n* Malia Azadiracta. \u2020 The China rose.\nB\u00e1rnipur was a whirlpool sacred to K\u00e1l\u00ed. There the Goddess of serpents tried to put the merchant into difficulty by raising a storm and sending an army of serpents of various size, colour and ferocity. But the merchant Ch\u00e1nd overcame all difficulties and continued his downward voyage. Then he entered into the river Huni\u00e1 and reached Chhatrabhog, a place mentioned in other ancient Bengali works. He performed all the sacred duties enjoined in the Sh\u00e1stras for performance at a place of pilgrimage. He took a large quantity of fresh water in his vessel from a pool named Badarik\u00e1 Kunda. Passing it he entered the Purgana of H\u00e1tiag\u00e1rh, so well known in the history of Pir Gor\u00e1ch\u00e1nd and in Musalm\u00e1ni Bengali literature. It was here that the Pir received a mortal wound from his Hindu opponents\u2014\u00c1k\u00e1nauda and B\u00e1k\u00e1nanda. From Hatiaag\u00e1rh the fleet entered Satamukhi, i.e., the hundred streams, and thence Chaumukh\u00ed,\u2014the four streams. Before entering the great ocean he worshipped Sankar M\u00e1dhav and performed his religious duties on the sea shore.\n\nSome question may arise as to the authenticity of the information given in Biprad\u00e1s's work. Those who are disposed to consider Biprad\u00e1s's work as authentic may yet contend that though his information is meagre at the commencement of the voyage, as also at the end, he is very elaborate between S\u00e1tgaon and K\u00e1ligh\u00e1t; and this is an indication that some verses may have been interpolated. But there is an explanation for this. Biprad\u00e1s belonged to B\u00e1duriya Ba\u1e6d\u00e1g\u00e1ram in the Bas\u00edrhat Subdivision, and if he ever came to bathe in the Ganges, he came to this part of the country and so he knew it better. It is also to be noted that the Pippal\u00e1\u00eds i.e., the family to which he belonged had a settlement at M\u00e1h\u00e9s and \u00c1kn\u00e1 where one of them held the high position of a priest to the local Jagann\u00e1th. The absence of any mention of places, noted in the history of Chaitanya's religion and for European commerce, puts the authenticity of the information given in the book beyond question.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in November last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAngers.
