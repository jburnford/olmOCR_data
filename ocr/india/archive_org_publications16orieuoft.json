Catholic authorities have drawn this distinction between \u2018experimental\u2019 and \u2018doctrinal\u2019 mysticism,\u00b9 and it is a great help towards clear thinking on this subject. The religious emotion common to all mankind is, so to speak, raised to its nth power in the mystics. They are overwhelmed by the sense of the Divine omnipresence, and of their own dependence on God. They are dominated and intoxicated by their vivid sense of the close relation subsisting between the soul and God. They conceive themselves as being in touch with God, feeling His motions in their souls, and at times rising to direct vision of Him by the \u2018inner light\u2019 vouchsafed to them. These religious experiences were the rough material out of which the doctrinal reasoned system, set out in treatises like the *Law\u0101\u02bei\u1e25*, was built up. Psychologists have advanced various theories as to the genesis of these experiences.\u00b2 With these we are not at present concerned. But as to the origin of the philosophical ideas and terms employed in the *Law\u0101\u02bei\u1e25* and similar works to formulate the \u1e62\u016bf\u012b theology, there can be little doubt. The source of \u1e62\u016bf\u012b theology was Neoplatonism.\n\nThe title of the book, *Law\u0101\u02bei\u1e25*, or \u2018Flashes of Light,\u2019\n\n\u00b9 See the article on \u2018Mystical Theology\u2019 in Addis and Arnold\u2019s \u2018Catholic Dictionary.\u2019\n\n\u00b2 See Dr. William James\u2019s \u2018Varieties of Religious Experience\u2019 (Longmans, 1902). It may be doubted whether the \u2018subliminal self\u2019 affords a satisfactory solution of the problem.\nsuggests the philosophy employed to systematize and give a reasoned basis for the unreasoned 'experiences' of unlearned \u0160\u016bf\u012bs. It of course refers to the 'inner light.' The Platonists were called Ishr\u0101q\u012bn or Illuminati, because they regarded intellectual intuition or intuitive reason as the main source of knowledge, whereas the Peripatetics (Mashsh\u0101'\u012bn) recognised no sources of knowledge except the senses and the discursive reason (Dianoia). The word Ishr\u0101q, or 'Lights,' is often met with in this connection. Thus Shams-ud-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad ash-Shahraz\u016br\u012b is called by Haji Khalfa 'a metaphysician learned in the inner lights' (Ishr\u0101q).\u00b9 Shih\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn as Suhraward\u012b, who was put to death at Aleppo in 537 A.H. by order of that valiant defender of the Faith, Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25-ud-d\u012bn, wrote a book entitled \u1e24ikmat-ul-Ishr\u0101q, or 'Philosophy of Inner Light.'\u00b2 The author of the Dabist\u0101n says that the belief of the pure \u0160\u016bf\u012bs is the same as that of the Ishr\u0101q\u012bn or Platonists,\u00b3 and also that \u0160\u016bf\u012bs were classed as orthodox (Mutasharri\u02bf\u012b) and Platonists.\u2074 Haji Khalfa, in his article on \u0160\u016bf\u012bsm (Tasawwuf), says that anyone who reads \u0160\u016bf\u012b books cannot fail to remark that their terminology is borrowed from the Platonists (Ishr\u0101q\u012bn), and more especially from the later ones\u2014i.e., the Neoplatonists.\u2075\n\nIt was probably at about the end of the fifth century A.H. that Neoplatonic gn\u014dsis began to influence and modify \u0160\u016bf\u012b doctrine. Up to that date the doctrine had been expounded in short precepts, parables (mith\u0101l), and similes like those in the Koran. But educated Moslems had outgrown these primitive methods of instruction. They wanted something more systematic. Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b tells us how his critics assailed him for dealing in trivial examples and parables instead of giving a systematic account of the stages of the soul's ascent to God.\u2076 Ibn Khald\u016bn mentions Mu\u1e25\u0101sib\u012b and\n\n\u00b9 Haji Khalfa, iii. 479.\n\u00b2 Ibn Khallikan, iv. 158. This Shih\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn must not be confounded with his more famous namesake who died at Baghdad in the odour of sanctity in 632 A.H.

We have Ghazz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s own account of the way in which he was attracted to \u0160\u016bf\u012bsm, and other passages in his writings prove that he used the forms of Greek thought to explain \u0160\u016bf\u012b principles. If it be asked how Greek philosophy reached Ghazz\u0101l\u012b, who was a native of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, the answer is easy. When Justinian closed the schools at Athens, Damascius and his Neoplatonist brethren fled to the court of Nushirv\u0101n. They only remained there about a year, and left in 538 A.D.; but Nushirv\u0101n had some translations of Neoplatonist books made at the time, and these were followed by many others, made two centuries and a half later, under the Abbasides at Baghdad.\n\nGreek philosophy was expounded by the so-called Arabian, but really Persian, philosophers, Al Far\u0101b\u012b and Avicena, and afterwards in the Ikhw\u0101n-us-Saf\u0101. Shahrast\u0101n\u012b, a contemporary of Ghazz\u0101l\u012b, gave accounts of all the chief Greek philosophers, including the \u2018Shaikh of the Greeks\u2019 or Plotinus, his editor Porphyry and Proklus. The so-called \u2018Theology of Aristotle,\u2019 which is a summary of the \u2018Enneads\u2019 of Plotinus, appeared probably soon afterwards. The result was that Neoplatonism, mainly in the form expounded by Plotinus, was used by all the more learned \u0160\u016bf\u012bs to explain and justify the simple emotional sayings of the early \u0160\u016bf\u012bs. Henceforward, Neoplatonism pervades all systematic treatises on \u0160\u016bf\u012bsm, such as the Fa\u1e63\u016b\u1e63-ul-Hikam, the Maq\u1e63ad-ul-Aq\u1e63\u0101, the Gulshan i R\u0101z, and the Law\u0101\u02bei\u1e25. Even the poets use the\n\n---\n\n1 'Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits,' xii., pp. 301, 302.\n2 See Schm\u00f6lders, '\u00c9coles Philosophiques chez les Arabes,' p. 55.\n3 See the passage on 'Tawhid' given in Appendix I.\n4 Khur\u0101s\u0101n was the 'focus of culture,' as Hamner says, and most of the philosophers came from that Eastern province.\n5 Whittaker's 'Neoplatonists,' p. 133; and Schm\u00f6lders, 'Documenta Philosophiae Arabum' (Bonn, 1836), Introduction.\n6 See Dieterici's 'Die Weltseele' (Leipzig, 1872).\n7 See Haarbr\u00fccker's German translation of Shahrast\u0101n\u012b's 'Book of Sects,' ii. 192 (Halle, 1850).\n8 See Dr. Br\u00f6nnle's note, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, April, 1901. The book was published with a Latin translation by Petrus Nicolaus in 1518.\n9 The late Professor Palmer published a summary of this book under the title of 'Oriental Mysticism' (Cambridge, 1867).\n10 Edited and translated by me (Tr\u00fcbner, 1880).\nGreek terminology. Thus Hak\u012bm San\u0101\u2019i, who lived at the same time as Ghazz\u0101l\u012b, introduces \u2018Universal Reason\u2019 and \u2018Universal Soul,\u2019 the second and third hypostases of the Trinity of Plotinus, and the principal later poets follow suit.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe first \u0160\u016bf\u012bs differed from ordinary Moslems only in their quietism (tasl\u012bm) and their puritan ideal of life. They held the orthodox doctrines, with perhaps a few reservations. But when Greek influences came into play all these doctrines underwent more or less modification. Take the following samples:\n\n1. The cardinal doctrine of Isl\u0101m was altered from Monotheism to Monism. \u2018There is no God but Allah\u2019 became \u2018There is no real Being or real Agent but \u201cThe One,\u201d \u201cThe Truth\u201d\u2019 (\\textit{Al Haqq}).\n\n2. God is no longer a supramundane Deity, enthroned above the empyrean heaven, creating the world by one fiat, ruling His subjects, like some mighty monarch, by commands and prohibitions, and paying them wages according to their deserts. He has become a Being immanent and \u2018deeply interfused\u2019 in the universe,\\(^2\\) and giving it all the real existence it has. The Koran speaks of Allah as omniscient, but omniscience was now expanded into \u2018omni-essence,\u2019 if one may use such a word.\\(^3\\) And the Plotinian emanation doctrine was borrowed to support this.\n\n3. Like all great religious teachers, Muhammad laid chief stress on right conduct, and this consisted in implicit obedience to every one of Allah\u2019s commands, as disobedience to any one was sin. The distinction between moral laws and com-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Nicholson has brought this out in his \u2018Diw\u0101ni Shamsi Tabr\u012bz\u2019 (Cambridge, 1898). For a sketch of the system of Plotinus see Appendix II.\n\n\\(^2\\) \\textit{Cp.} Wordsworth, \u2018Lines on Tintern Abbey\u2019:\n\n\u2018A sense sublime\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\nAnd the round ocean and the living air,\nAnd the blue sky, and in the heart of man;\nA motion and a spirit that impels\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\nAnd rolls through all things.\u2019\n\n\\(^3\\) \u2018Or omneity,\u2019 as Sir Thomas Browne calls it in the \u2018Religio Medici,\u2019 \u00a7 35.\nmands merely relating to ritual observances was not clearly laid down. It has been said that Isl\u0101m means 'striving after righteousness.'\u00b9 That is so, but righteousness was interpreted as including the scrupulous observance of trivial rules as to ablutions, prayers, fasting, etc.\u00b2 It may well be doubted if Mu\u1e25ammad is responsible for some of the directions about ritual which are ascribed to him,\u00b3 but, be this as it may, more and more importance came to be assigned to the scrupulous observance of these ritual forms. The early \u0160\u016bf\u012bs disliked this externalism, and came to regard all rites as of small account. They thought that the mechanical routine of rites (taql\u012bd) only served to induce the spiritual torpor, which Dante called 'Accidia.'\u2074 St. Bernard remarked this result in his monks, but he set it down to the fault of the men, not to that of the system. The \u0160\u016bf\u012b theologians adopted the Neoplatonist view that the ritual law is not binding upon spiritual men. St. Paul held a similar view. Shabist\u0101r\u012b contrasts the mere outward Isl\u0101m of ritual observances with the true piety of some heathens, much to the advantage of the latter, and Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b declares that 'Fools exalt the Mosque while they ignore the true temple in the heart.'\u2075\n\n4. The Koranic doctrine of future rewards and punishments was ultimately refined away. The early \u0160\u016bf\u012bs held very strongly that love to God should be quite disinterested and untainted by hope of reward. They thought 'otherworldliness' no better than worldliness. According to the \u0160\u016bf\u012b theologians there is no material heaven or hell.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Surah, lxxii. 14; Hirschfeld, p. 14; and Suhrawardy's 'Sayings of Mu\u1e25ammad.' Jorj\u0101n\u012b defines Isl\u0101m as unquestioning obedience and submission to Allah's commands ('Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits,' x., p. 53).\n\u00b2 See the rules about ablution, etc., in the 'Mishc\u0101t ul Mas\u0101b\u012bh,' translated by Matthews (Calcutta, 1809). Cp. Omar Khayy\u0101m's 'whimsical complaint,' Quatrain 180.\n\u00b3 They seem opposed to the spirit of the text: 'Righteousness does not consist in turning to the east or to the west,' etc. (Surah, ii. 172).\n\u2074 Purgatory (Canto XVII.).\n\u2075 'Gulshan i R\u0101z,' l. 877; and 'Masnav\u012b,' p. 100, and Introduction, p. xxxiv (second edition). But elsewhere (at p. 76) Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn says forms and symbols are generally needed. In default of some outward and visible sign which they can perceive, men find it hard to conceive the inward spirit.\nunion is attained, asked Shabistari, 'of what account then will be Paradise and the Houris?' On the other hand, those who lead evil lives would lose by degrees the portion of real being within them, dropping to the level of animals, or even plants, and finally relapsing into non-existence. This result is nowhere clearly stated, but seems implied in the language used, which is, of course, very guarded.\n\n5. Mu\u1e25ammad had no taste for speculation. He said: 'Think on the mercies of God, not on the essence of God.' And again: 'Sit not with those who discuss predestination.' His language on predestination is merely popular. In one passage it is that of determinism, in another that of freewill. In one place Allah constrains all, guiding some aright and causing others to err. Elsewhere man acts freely without constraint. But the theologians fastened on these obscure problems, and did their best to shift the religious centre of gravity from right conduct to right opinion on these problems. The traditionists fathered on Mu\u1e25ammad various sayings to prove that he regarded orthodoxy on these 'afterthoughts of theology' as all important for salvation. Thus the saying, 'My people shall be split into seventy-three sects, all of whom but one shall perish in hell fire,' is one which betrays theological authorship. In Mu\u1e25ammad's lifetime the contest was not with sects within Isl\u0101m, but with those who denied Isl\u0101m altogether. For these he had no mercy, but he would scarcely have been so hard on his own people for venial errors of opinion. Again, he could hardly have said, 'Qadarians are Magian (dualists),' at a time when (as is almost certain) no sect of that name had yet arisen. The early \u0160\u016bf\u012bs did not concern themselves with the disputes of the sects. But the \u0160\u016bf\u012b theologians could not altogether ignore them. They took sides against the sects which leaned to anthropomorphism, and, on the other hand, fully agreed with the doctrine of the Compulsionists or extreme Predestinarians. That sect held that God, as the One real Agent,\n\n1 'Gulshan i R\u0101z,' l. 701.\n2 See Omar Khayy\u0101m (second edition), Appendix, p. 358.\n3 Koran, xvi. 38, 39.\n4 The Qadarians would be classed as semi-Pelagians by Western theologians.\n5 See 'Gulshan i R\u0101z,' l. 105 and 538.\nnot only permitted evil, but of set purpose allotted evils, present or future, to the majority of mankind. This strange doctrine (which has its parallel in Europe) forced the \u1e62\u016bf\u012b theologians to attempt some reconciliation of Divine power, as thus interpreted, with Divine goodness, and here, like Augustine, they availed themselves of the 'not-being' ('adm) of Plotinus.\\(^1\\)\n\nPerhaps, however, the true \u1e62\u016bf\u012b spirit was best interpreted by Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b, when he declared that he agreed with all seventy-three sects as being all honest attempts to grasp the obscure truth. Errors in 'naming the names of God' are of small account. According to the \u1e24ad\u012bth, 'He who does the works will know the doctrine.' And true love to God atones for all mistakes of doctrine.\\(^2\\)\n\nJ\u0101m\u012b is a typical \u1e62\u016bf\u012b theologian. He works hard to construct a reasoned basis for \u1e62\u016bfism, but finally realizes that his logical definitions and syllogisms cannot express the truth as it really is, and add nothing to the grounds on which the convictions of \u1e62\u016bfis must always rest. It is only by means of the spiritual clairvoyance generated by love that Divine knowledge (ma\u02bfrifat) can be attained.\\(^3\\) Those who have these spiritual intuitions do not need demonstrations, and to those who have them not all demonstrations are useless.\n\n6. Mu\u1e25ammad, like Luther, rejected asceticism. Suhrawardy quotes several of his anti-ascetic sayings, including the familiar one, 'There is no monasticism in Isl\u0101m.' He approved of poverty, it is true, and prescribed a month of fasting, but set his face firmly against the cloistered life and celibacy.\\(^4\\) The early \u1e62\u016bfis were, perhaps, attracted to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See 'Masnav\u012b' (second edition), Introduction, p. xxx, etc., and Flash XXVII. in this treatise.\n\n\\(^2\\) See the parable of Moses and the shepherd who was faulty in theology, but fervent in spirit ('Masnav\u012b,' p. 82, and also p. 139).\n\n\\(^3\\) See 'Masnav\u012b,' p. 260. Newman ('Apologia,' p. 19) quotes Keble as saying, 'The firmness of assent which we give to religious doctrine is due, not to the probabilities which introduced it, but to the living power of faith and love which accepted it.' This is worked out in Newman's 'Grammar of Assent.'\n\n\\(^4\\) See the 'Sayings of Mu\u1e25ammad,' by Suhrawardy (Constable, 1905), Nos. 125, 304, 186, etc.\nasceticism by the example of the Christians in Syria, where\nthe first \u1e62\u016bf\u012b convent was built; and Neoplatonist doctrine\nfurnished the rationale of ascetic practice. Matter was evil,\nand therefore all material and sensuous taint, including the\nnatural instincts (*phron\u0113ma sarkos*), must be purged away and\nextirpated by all who claimed to be spiritual men.\\(^1\\) Thus\na double system of religious conduct was set up\u2014the external\nlaw for ordinary men and \u2018the counsels of perfection,\u2019 the\nmore perfect way of asceticism and contemplation for spiritual\nmen. The external law of ritual observances had no longer\nany dominion over spiritual men.\\(^2\\) This abrogation of the\nceremonial law naturally tempted some undisciplined \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs,\nas it has tempted some professing followers of St. Paul,\nto laxity in the observance of the moral law. It is needless\nto say that these antinomian developments were never\ncountenanced by any reputable theologians or teachers, but,\non the contrary, were always condemned by them. Still, it\ncannot be denied that wild enthusiasts and false brethren did\noccasionally misinterpret \u1e62\u016bf\u012b doctrines in this way, and thus\ngave some ground for the prejudices of orthodox Moslems\nagainst the whole body of \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs.\n\nHarnack, in his \u2018History of Dogma,\u2019 has shown how pro-\nfoundly Christian theology has been affected by Neoplatonist\nideas. The disputes about *Ousia*, *Hypostasis*, and *Physis*\nwhich rent Christendom asunder\\(^3\\) mainly grew from \u2018after-\nthoughts of theology\u2019 suggested by these ideas, and their\ninfluence has extended to our own days.\\(^4\\) It is hardly too\nmuch to say that their influence on the course of events has\nbeen as considerable as that of the Roman law. In Isl\u0101m\ntheir influence has been much more restricted than in\nChristendom, but, such as it was, it is instructive to trace it.\\(^5\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b, however, takes occasion to warn his disciples that\nthis counsel of perfection is not to be taken too literally. See the parable\nof the peacock who tore off his plumage to avoid the pursuit of the\nfowlers (\u2018Masnav\u012b,\u2019 p. 228).\n\n\\(^2\\) See \u2018Masnav\u012b,\u2019 p. 224.\n\n\\(^3\\) Gibbon\u2019s \u2018Decline and Fall,\u2019 chapter xxi.\n\n\\(^4\\) \u2018Paulus genuit Augustinum et Augustinus genuit Calvinum.\u2019 With\nPaul should be coupled Plotinus. See Bigg\u2019s \u2018Introduction to Augustine\u2019s\nConfessions\u2019 (Methuen, 1903).\n\n\\(^5\\) For a sketch of the system of Plotinus, who is the best exponent of\nNeoplatonism, see Appendix II.\nThe manuscript of the Law\u0101\u2019i\u1e25 now reproduced is undated, but was probably written within a century of J\u0101m\u012b\u2019s death in 898 A.H. It once belonged to the royal library at Delhi, and the outside pages contain notes by the librarians, one of which, dated the twenty-fourth year of Aurangzib, states that it was worm-eaten even then. W. H. Morley, who also owned it, has noted on the fly-leaf his opinion that it is not J\u0101m\u012b\u2019s work, but written by one Sayyid \u2018Abd-ul K\u0101fi. This, however, is certainly a mistake. Haji Khalfa, in his notice of J\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Law\u0101\u2019i\u1e25, quotes the beginning, which agrees with the beginning of this manuscript,\u00b9 and one of the quatrains gives J\u0101m\u012b\u2019s name. The British Museum possesses three copies\u2014viz., Add. 16,820 (Rieu, p. 44a); Add. 16,819, iv (Rieu, p. 826b); and Add. 7,689, iv, folio 150 onwards (Rieu, p. 810b). Copies are to be found in other libraries. In addition to that now reproduced, I possess one, written in an Indian hand, probably in the eighteenth century.\u00b2\n\nThe facsimile of the manuscript has been made by Messrs. Nops, of Ludgate Hill. They have been very successful in removing nearly all traces of the stains and worm-holes in the original, and I think the writer of the manuscript himself, could he see it, would find little fault with their reproduction of his handiwork.\n\nI began the translation some years ago, but, owing to failing eyesight, had to stop after getting to the end of Flash VII. I have now been fortunate enough to secure the assistance of a very competent scholar, Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Kazv\u012bn\u012b, who has furnished me with a literal French version of the whole, together with some valuable notes. In his translation the Mirz\u0101 has chiefly followed the British Museum Manuscript, Add. No. 16,819, which contains several passages not found in this manuscript. Most, if not all, of these seem to me to be glosses which have crept into the text, but I have given them in this translation, marking them with square brackets.

From the beginning of Flash VIII. to the end of the book the translation is the Mirza\u2019s French version turned into English by me. In this part of the work I have followed the Mirz\u0101 closely, only referring to the original to verify a word here and there. I am solely responsible for the preface and notes. If they contain errors of fact or doctrine, these must not be imputed to the Mirz\u0101.\n\nThe references to the Gulshan i R\u0101z are to my edition of that work (Tr\u00fcbner, 1880); those to the Masnav\u012b of Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b to my translation of that poem (second edition, published in Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s Oriental Series, 1898); those to Omar Khayy\u0101m to my text and translation, published in the same series, second edition, 1901.\n\nAs regards transliteration, I follow the rule laid down long since by the Indian Government, that when foreign words have become naturalized in English they should be spelled according to English usage. Thus I write Calcutta, Delhi, Koran, Abbasides, etc. Again, when a Persian writer has chosen to transliterate his own name in a particular way, I do not presume to interfere with his discretion. I give titles of books as they are spelled on the title-pages, and, like Rieu, I represent Hamza by the \u2018spiritus lenis\u2019 ('). With these exceptions I have in the main observed the transliteration rules of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nE. H. W.\nTRANSLATION OF THE LAWA\u2019IH.\n\n\u2018I do not render praises unto Thee.\u2019\u00b9 How is this, seeing that \u2018all praise returns to Thee\u2019?\u00b2 The threshold of Thy sanctity is too high for my praises. Thou art what Thine own praises declare Thee. O Lord, we are not able to tell Thy praises or set forth Thy glories. Whatsoever is manifested on the pages of the universe is praise reflected back to the threshold of Thy most glorious Majesty. What can faculty or tongue of mine declare worthy of Thy glory and honour? Thou art such as Thou hast Thyself declared, and the pearls of Thy praise are what Thyself hast strung.\n\nIn the vast largesse of Thy Majesty\nThis whole world\u2019s but a drop from out the sea;\nWhat power have we to celebrate Thy praise?\nNo praises save Thine own are meet for Thee!\n\nWhere the speaker of the words, \u2018I am the most eloquent [of the Arabs]\u2019,\u00b3 lowered the flag of his eloquence, and found himself impotent to render Thee fitting praises, how shall a mere stammerer venture to open his mouth or a dullard deliver an apt discourse? Nevertheless, in this case to excuse one\u2019s self on the ground of one\u2019s incapacity and deficiencies is itself the gravest of defects, and to put one\u2019s self on a level with that prince of the world and of the faith would be a serious breach of propriety.\n\n\u00b9 A saying of Muhammad.\n\u00b2 Fluegel (Haji Khalfa, v. 344) translates, \u2018Quomodo possim?\u2019 Cp. Surah, xvii. 46, \u2018Neither is there aught which doth not celebrate Thy praise,\u2019 and Ps. cxlv. 10.\n\u00b3 Referring to the saying, \u2018I am the most eloquent of those who pronounce the letter Z\u0101d (Dz\u0101d),\u2019 the Arab shibboleth.\nWhat am I? Can I count myself the peer\nOf the poor dog that's suffered to draw near?\nI may not join the caravan\u2014enough\nIf from afar the camel bells I hear.\n\nO Lord, send down Thy blessing upon Muhammad, the standard-bearer of praise and possessor of 'the glorious station,'\u00b9 and upon his family, and upon his companions who through earnest endeavour have succeeded in attaining the goal of their desire, and pour upon them all Thy perfect peace!\n\nSUPPLICATIONS.\u00b2\n\nO God, deliver us from preoccupation with worldly vanities, and show us the nature of things 'as they really are.'\u00b3 Remove from our eyes the veil of ignorance, and show us things as they really are. Show not to us non-existence as existent, nor cast the veil of non-existence over the beauty of existence. Make this phenomenal world the mirror\u2074 to reflect the manifestations of Thy beauty, and not a veil to separate and repel us from Thee. Cause these unreal phenomena of the universe to be for us the sources of knowledge and insight, and not the cause of ignorance and blindness. Our alienation and severance from Thy beauty all proceed from ourselves. Deliver us from ourselves, and accord to us intimate knowledge of Thee.\n\nMake my heart pure, my soul from error free,\nMake tears and sighs my daily lot to be,\nAnd lead me on Thy road away from self,\nThat lost to self I may approach to Thee!\n\nSet enmity between the world and me,\nMake me averse from worldly company:\nFrom other objects turn away my heart,\nSo that it be engrossed with love to Thee.\n\n\u00b9 'It may be, O Muhammad, that thy Lord will raise thee to a glorious station' (Koran, xvii. 81), interpreted to mean, his power of intercession.\n\u00b2 The headings are all omitted in this manuscript, but spaces are left, which were probably intended to be filled in with gold lettering.\n\u00b3 A prayer ascribed to Muhammad. See 'Gulshan i R\u0101z,' p. 21, note 1.\n\u2074 The divine Real Being is reflected in 'Notbeing' ('adm) as in a mirror, and gives it all the reality it possesses. See 'Gulshan i R\u0101z,' p. 14, l. 134. This idea comes from Plotinus, 'the Shaikh of the Greeks.'\nHow were it, Lord, if Thou should\u2019st set me free\nFrom error\u2019s grasp and cause me truth to see?\nGuebres by scores Thou makest Musulmans,\nWhy, then, not make a Musulman of me?\n\nMy lust for this world and the next efface,\nGrant me the crown of poverty and grace\nTo be partaker in Thy mysteries,\nFrom paths that lead not towards Thee turn my face.\n\nPREFACE.\n\nThis is a treatise entitled *Lawa\u2019ih*\u00b9 (\u2018Flashes of Light\u2019), explanatory of the intuitions and verities displayed on the pages of the hearts and minds of men of insight and divine knowledge, and of those who enjoy spiritual raptures and ecstasies. It is written in suitable language adorned with pleasing explanations. I trust that readers will hold of no account the personality of the author of this commentary, and will refrain from taking their seats upon the carpet of cavilling and animadversion. For the author plays only the part of interpreter in the following discussions; his sole function is that of mouthpiece, and nothing else.\n\nBelieve me, I am naught\u2014yea, less than naught.\nBy naught and less than naught what can be taught?\nI tell the mysteries of truth, but know\nNaught save the telling to this task I brought.\n\nFor poverty to make no sign is best,\nOn love divine to hold one\u2019s peace is best;\nFor him who never felt ecstatic joys\nTo play a mere reporter\u2019s part is best.\n\nWith men of light I sought these pearls to string,\nThe drift of mystics\u2019 sayings forth to bring;\nNow let his trusty slaves this tribute bear\nFrom foolish me to Hamad\u0101n\u2019s wise king.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Haji Khalfa (v., p. 344) says Sayyid K\u0101seh Karr\u0101n\u012b wrote a Persian commentary upon it.\n\u00b2 The person referred to is probably Sh\u0101h Manuchahr, Governor of Hamad\u0101n, who paid much attention to J\u0101m\u012b when he visited the town in 877 A.H. See Lee\u2019s preface to the \u2018Nafah\u0101t,\u2019 p. 11. Note the pun on \u2018Hama D\u0101n\u2019 (\u2018All-knowing\u2019). Amir Sayyid \u2018Al\u012b of Hamadan, a S\u016bf\u012b saint, is mentioned in the \u2018Nafah\u0101t,\u2019 p. 515, but as he died in 786 A.H., it is not likely that J\u0101m\u012b is speaking of him.\nFlash I.\n\nGod has not made man with two hearts within him. The Incomparable Majesty who has conferred the boon of existence upon thee has placed within thee but one heart, to the end that with single heart thou mayest love Him alone, and mayest turn thy back on all besides and devote thyself to Him alone, and refrain from dividing thy heart into a hundred portions, each portion devoted to a different object.\n\nO votary of earthly idols' fane,\nWhy let these veils of flesh enwrap thy brain?\n'Tis folly to pursue a host of loves;\nA single heart can but one love contain!\n\nFlash II.\n\nDistraction or disunion (Tafriqah) consists in dividing the heart by attaching it to divers objects. Union or collectedness (jam\u2018iyyat) consists in forsaking all else and being wholly engrossed in the contemplation of the One Unique Being. Those who fancy that collectedness results from the collecting of worldly goods remain in perpetual distraction, whilst those who are convinced that amassing wealth is the cause of distraction renounce all worldly goods.\n\nO thou whose heart is torn by lust for all,\nYet vainly strives to burst these bonds of all,\nThis \u2018all\u2019 begets distraction of the heart:\nGive up thy heart to ONE and break with all.\n\nWhile thou\u2019rt distraught by hell-born vanity,\nThou\u2019rt seen by men of union base to be;\nBy God, thou art a demon, and no man,\nToo ignorant thy devilry to see.\n\nO pilgrim on the \u2018path\u2019 vain talk reject;\nAll roads save that to Unity neglect;\nNaught but distractedness proceeds from wealth:\nCollect thine heart, not store of wealth collect.\n\n1 \u2018L\u0101\u2018ihah.\u2019 These headings, which are found in other manuscripts, are omitted in this, as before remarked.\n2 Koran, xxxiii. 4.\n3 Also \u2018tranquillity,\u2019 \u2018congregation,\u2019 \u2018totality.\u2019\n4 Nasn\u0101s; literally, a fabulous monster, a satyr.\n5 S\u0101lik.\nO heart, thy high-prized learning of the schools,\nGeometry and metaphysic rules\u2014\nYea, all but lore of God is devils' lore:\nFear God and leave this evil lore to fools.\n\nFlash III.\n\nThe 'Truth,' most glorious and most exalted, is omnipresent. He knows the outer and inner state of all men in every condition. Oh, what a loss will be thine if thou turnest thine eyes from His face to fix them on other objects, and forsakest the way that is pleasing to Him to follow other roads!\n\nMy Love stood by me at the dawn of day,\nAnd said, 'To grief you make my heart a prey;\nWhilst I am casting looks of love at you,\nHave you no shame to turn your eyes away?'\n\nAll my life long I tread love's path of pain,\nIf peradventure 'union' I may gain.\nBetter to catch one moment's glimpse of Thee\nThan earthly beauties' love through life retain.\n\nFlash IV.\n\nEverything other than the 'Truth' (may He be glorified and exalted) is subject to decay and annihilation. Its substance is a mental figment with no objective existence, and its form is a merely imaginary entity.\n\nYesterday this universe neither existed nor appeared to exist, while to-day it appears to exist, but has no real existence: it is a mere semblance, and to-morrow nothing thereof will be seen. What does it profit thee to allow thyself to be guided by vain passions and desires? Why dost thou place reliance on these transitory objects that glitter with false lustre? Turn thy heart away from all of them, and firmly attach it to God. Break loose from all these, and cleave closely to Him. It is only He who always has been and always will continue to be. The countenance of His eternity is never scarred by the thorn of contingency.\nThe fleeting phantoms you admire to-day\nWill soon at Heaven's behest be swept away.\nO give your heart to Him who never fails,\nWho's ever with you and will ever stay.\n\nWhen to fair idols' shrines I did repair,\nI vexed my heart with griefs encountered there;\nNow earthly beauty has lost all its charm,\nEternal beauty is my only care.\n\nThings that abide not to eternity\nExpose thee to misfortune's battery;\nIn this life, then, sever thyself from all\nFrom which thy death is bound to sever thee.\n\nPerchance with wealth and sons endowed thou art.\nYet with all these erelong thou'lt have to part.\nThrice happy he who gives his heart to One,\nAnd sets affection on the men of heart.\n\nFlash V.\n\nThe Absolute Beauty is the Divine Majesty endued with [the attributes of] power and bounty. Every beauty and perfection manifested in the theatre of the various grades of beings is a ray of His perfect beauty reflected therein. It is from these rays that exalted souls have received their impress of beauty and their quality of perfection.\\(^1\\) Whosoever is wise derives his wisdom from the Divine wisdom. Wherever intelligence is found it is the fruit of the Divine intelligence. In a word, all are attributes of Deity which have descended from the zenith of the Universal and Absolute to the nadir of the particular and relative. [They have descended] to the end that thou mayest direct thy course from the part towards the Whole, and from the relative deduce the Absolute, and not imagine the part to be distinct from the Whole, nor be so engrossed with what is merely relative as to cut thyself off from the Absolute.\n\nThe Loved One's rose-parterre I went to see,\nThat beauty's Torch\\(^2\\) espied me, and, quoth He,\n'I am the tree; these flowers My offshoots are.\nLet not these offshoots hide from thee the tree.'\n\n\\(^1\\) Spenser in the 'Hymn of Heavenly Love' expresses the same idea, which comes from Plato.\n\\(^2\\) Literally, 'Torch of Tir\u0101z,' a town in Turkist\u0101n famed for its beautiful women.\nWhat profit rosy cheeks, forms full of grace,\nAnd ringlets clustering round a lovely face?\nWhen Beauty Absolute beams all around,\nWhy linger finite beauties to embrace?\n\nFlash VI.\n\nMan, in regard to his corporeal nature, stands at the lowest point of degradation; nevertheless, in regard to his spiritual nature, he is at the summit of nobility. He takes the impress of every thing to which he directs his attention, and assumes the colour of every thing to which he approaches. Wherefore philosophers say that when the reasonable soul adorns itself with exact and faithful impressions of realities, and appropriates to itself the true character of such realities, it becomes such as if it were itself altogether essential Being. In like manner the vulgar, by the force of their conjunction with these material forms and extreme preoccupation with these corporeal liens, come to be such that they cannot distinguish themselves from these forms or perceive any difference between the two. Well says the Maulavi of R\u00fcm (may God sanctify his secret) in the *Masnav\u012b*:\n\nO brother, thou art wholly thought,\nFor the rest of thee is only bone and muscle:\nIf thy thought be a rose, thou art a rose-bouquet;\nIf it be a thorn, thou art fuel for the fire.\n\nWherefore it behoves thee to strive and hide thyself from thy sight,\u00b9 and occupy thyself with Very Being, and concern thyself with the \u2018Truth.\u2019 For the various grades of created things are theatres of His revealed beauty, and all things that exist are mirrors of his perfections.\n\nAnd in this course thou must persevere until He mingles Himself with thy soul, and thine own individual existence passes out of thy sight. Then, if thou regardest thyself, it is He whom thou art regarding; if thou speakest of thyself, it is He of whom thou art speaking. The relative has become the Absolute, and \u2018I am the Truth\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018He is the Truth.\u2019\n\n\u00b9 Variant, \u2018hide thyself from the sight of the world.\u2019\n\u00b2 The saying of Man\u1e63\u016br i \u1e24all\u0101j (or Ibn \u1e24all\u0101j), the Sufi martyr.\nIf love of rose or bulbul fill thine heart,\nThyself a rose or eager bulbul art.\nThou art a part; the 'Truth' is all in all.\nDwell on the 'Truth,' and cease to be a part.\n\nOf my soul's union with this fleshly frame,\nOf life and death Thou art the end and aim.\nI pass away; Thou only dost endure.\nWhen I say 'me,' 'tis Thee I mean to name.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhen will this mortal dress be torn away,\nAnd Beauty Absolute His face display,\nMerging my soul in His resplendent light,\nBlinding my heart with His o'erpowering ray?\n\nFlash VII.\n\nIt is necessary for thee to habituate thyself to this intimate relation in such wise that at no time and in no circumstance thou mayest be without the sense of it, whether in coming or in going, in eating or sleeping, in speaking or listening. In short, thou must ever be on the alert both when resting and when working, not to waste thy time in insensibility [to this relation]\u2014nay, more, thou must watch every breath, and take heed that it goeth not forth in negligence.\n\nThe years roll on; Thou showest not Thy face,\nYet nothing from my breast Thy love can chase;\nThine image ever dwells before mine eyes,\nAnd in my heart Thy love aye holds its place.\n\nFlash VIII.\n\nIn like manner, as it behoves thee to maintain the said relation continually, so it is of the first importance to develop the quality thereof by detaching thyself from mundane relations and by emancipating thyself from attention to contingent forms; and this is possible only through hard striving and earnest endeavour to expel vain thoughts and imaginations from thy mind. The more these thoughts are cast out and\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare the story of the \u0160\u016bfi aspirant who was refused admittance by his Pir till he ceased to speak of 'me' and called himself 'thee' ('Masnav\u012b,' p. 47).\nthese suggestions checked, the stronger and closer this relation becomes. It is, then, necessary to use every endeavour to force these thoughts to encamp outside the enclosure of thy breast, and that the 'Truth' most glorious may cast His beams into thy heart, and deliver thee from thyself, and save thee from the trouble of entertaining His rivals in thy heart. Then there will abide with thee neither consciousness of thyself, nor even consciousness of such absence of consciousness\u2014nay, there will abide nothing save the One God alone.\n\nFrom my brute nature, Lord, deliver me,\nAnd from this life of evil set me free;\nPurge me of my own sense and ignorance,\nAnd make me lose my very self in Thee.\n\nWhen poor indeed and dead to self thou'lt need\nNo visions, knowledge, certitude, or creed;\nWhen self has perished naught but God remains,\nFor 'Perfect poverty is God indeed.'\n\nFlash IX.\n\nSelf-annihilation consists in this, that through the overpowering influence of the Very Being upon the inner man, there remains no consciousness of aught beside Him. Annihilation of annihilation consists in this, that there remains no consciousness even of that unconsciousness. It is evident that annihilation of annihilation is involved in [the very notion of] annihilation. For if he who has attained annihilation should retain the least consciousness of his annihilation, he would not be in the state of annihilation, because the quality of annihilation and the person possessing such quality are both things distinct from the Very Being, the 'Truth' most glorious. Therefore, to be conscious of annihilation is incompatible with annihilation.\n\n1 See the passage from Ghazz\u0101l\u012b in Appendix III.\n2 Dad\u012b, brutishness. Some manuscripts read duwi, disease, but this does not suit the rhyme, which in verses with a burden (rad\u012bf) always precedes it. Scan d\u0101d\u012byi, dissolving long \u012b and lengthening the i\u1e93\u0101fat.\n3 Seemingly a \u1e24ad\u012bth. Poverty, utter annihilation of self ('Gulshan i R\u0101z,' l. 128, and note).\n4 So Ghazz\u0101l\u012b, quoted in Appendix III.\nWhile fondness for your 'self' you still retain,\nYou'll not reduce its bulk a single grain\u2014\nYea, while you feel one hair's-breadth of yourself\nClaims to annihilation are but vain.\n\nFlash X.\n\nUnification\\(^1\\) consists in unifying the heart\u2014that is to say, in purifying it and expelling from it attachment to all things other than the 'Truth' most glorious, including not only desire and will, but also knowledge and intelligence. In fact, one must quench desire of all things hitherto desired, and cease to will what one has hitherto willed, and also remove from the intellectual vision all concepts and all cognitions, and turn away the mind from all things whatsoever, so that there remains no consciousness or cognition of aught save the 'Truth' most glorious. [Khw\u0101ja 'Abdull\u0101h An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b said: 'Unification is not merely believing Him to be One, but in thyself being one with Him.'\\(^2\\)\n\n'Oneness' in pilgrims' phraseology\nIs from concern with 'other' to be free;\nLearn, then, the highest 'station' of the birds,\\(^3\\)\nIf language of the birds be known to thee.'\n\nFlash XI.\n\nSo long as a man remains imprisoned in the snare of passions and lusts, it is hard for him to maintain this close communion [with the 'Truth']. But from the moment that sweet influence takes effect on him, expelling from his mind the firebrand of vain imaginations and suggestions, the pleasure he experiences therefrom predominates over bodily pleasures and intellectual enjoyments. Then the painful sense of effort passes away, and the joys of contemplation\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tau\u1e25\u012bd is the Hen\u014dsis of Plotinus, the becoming one with the 'One.'\n\n\\(^2\\) This sentence occurs only in the British Museum copy, Add. 16,819. Khw\u0101ja 'Abdull\u0101h An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b of Her\u0101t, who died 481 A.H., was named the Shaikh of Isl\u0101m, and is often quoted by J\u0101m\u012b in the 'Nafah\u0101t.' See Haji Khalfa, i., 235.\n\n\\(^3\\) Alluding to the 'Discourse of the Birds and their Pilgrimage to the S\u012bmurgh,' by Far\u012bd-ud-d\u012bn 'Att\u0101r.

He ought to know, for instance, that even though he should employ an eternity in cultivating this communion, that would count as nothing, and he would not have discharged his duty as he ought.\n\nOn my soul's lute a chord was struck by Love,\nTransmuting all my being into love;\nAges would not discharge my bounden debt\nOf gratitude for one short hour of love.\n\nFlash XIII.\n\nThe essence of the 'Truth' most glorious and most exalted is nothing but Being. His\\(^2\\) Being is not subject to defect or diminution. He is untouched by change or variation, and is exempt from plurality and multiplicity; He transcends all manifestations, and is unknowable and invisible. Every 'how' and 'why' have made their appearance through Him; but in Himself He transcends every 'how' and 'why.' Everything is perceived by Him, while he is beyond perception. The out-\n\n\\(^1\\) So in the *Stabat Mater*:\n\n'Fac me cruce inebriari.'\n\n\\(^2\\) I prefer to emphasize the religious rather than the philosophic and abstract aspect of the 'Truth,' and therefore use the personal pronoun. Thus, the 'Ideal Good' of Plato's 'Republic,' Book VI., is spoken of as 'God' in the 'Timaeus.' Just so 'To Kurion' has changed into 'Dominus' in the Western version of the Nicene Creed.\nward eye is too dull to behold His beauty, and the eye of the heart is dimmed by the contemplation of His perfection.\n\nThou, for whose love I've sacrificed existence,\nArt, yet art not, the sum of earth's existence;\nEarth lacks true Being, yet depends thereon\u2014\nThou art true Being: Thou art pure existence.\n\nThe Loved One is quite colourless,\\(^1\\) O heart;\nBe not engrossed with colours, then, O heart:\nAll colours come from what is colourless,\nAnd 'who can dye so well as God,'\\(^2\\) O heart?\n\nFlash XIV.\n\nBy the word 'existence'\\(^3\\) is sometimes meant simply the state of being or existing, which is a generic concept or an abstract idea. Taken in this sense, 'existence' is an 'idea of the second intention,'\\(^4\\) which has no external object corresponding with it. It is one of the accidents of the 'quidity'\\(^5\\) [or real nature of the thing] which exists only in thought, as has been proved by the reasonings of scholastic theologians and philosophers. But sometimes 'existence' signifies the Real Being, who is Self-existent, and on whom the existence of all other beings depends; and in truth there is no real external existence beside Him\u2014all other beings are merely accidents accessory to Him, as is attested by the intuitive apprehension of the most famous Gnostics and 'Men of Certitude.' The word ['existence'] is applicable to the 'Truth' most glorious in the latter sense only.\n\nThings that exist to men of narrow view\nAppear the accidents to substance due;\nTo men of light substance is accident,\nWhich the 'True Being' ever doth renew.\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n1 B\u012brang\u012b. Absence of visible or knowable qualities.\n2 Koran, ii. 132.\n3 Waj\u016bd, usually 'necessary being' as opposed to 'contingent.' J\u0101m\u012b wrote a treatise on it, quoted in the 'Dabistan,' chapter xii.\n4 Ma'q\u016bl\u0101t i th\u0101n\u012byah. In scholastic terminology terms of the second intention are those which express abstractions from concrete individual objects\u2014e.g., genus, species, etc. Rabelais made fun of this term: 'Utrum chimera bombinans in vacuo comedere possit secundas intentiones?'\n5 Quidity, what a thing is, a word derived by the Schoolmen from m\u0101hiy\u0101t. See Schm\u00f6lders, 'Documenta Philosophiae Arabum,' p. 133.\n6 'In Him we live and move and have our being' (Acts xvii. 28).\nFlash XV.\n\nThe attributes are distinct from the Real Being in thought, but are identical with Him in fact and reality. For instance, the Real Being is omniscient in respect of His quality of knowledge; omnipotent in respect of His power; absolute in respect of His will. Doubtless, just as these attributes are distinct from each other in idea, according to their respective meanings, so they are distinct from the Real Being; but in fact and reality they are identical with Him. In other words, there are not in Him many existences, but only one sole existence, and His various names and attributes are merely His modes and aspects.\n\nPure is Thy essence from deficiency,\nExpressed its 'how' and 'where' can never be;\nThy attributes appear distinct, but are\nOne with Thy essence in reality.\n\nFlash XVI.\n\nThe Real Being, qud Being, is above all names and attributes, and exempt from all conditions and relations. The attribution to Him of these names only holds good in respect of His aspect towards the world of phenomena. In the first manifestation, wherein He revealed Himself, of Himself, to Himself, were realized the attributes of Knowledge, Light, Existence and Presence. Knowledge involved the power of knowing and that of being known; Light implied those of manifesting and of being manifest; Existence and Presence entailed those of causing to exist and of being existent, and those of beholding and of being beheld. And thus the manifestation which is a characteristic of Light is preceded by concealment; and concealment, by its very nature, has the priority over, and is antecedent to, manifestation; hence the concealed and the manifested are counted as first and second.\n\nAnd in like manner in the case of the second and third manifestations, etc., as long as it pleases God to continue them, these conditions and relations always go on redoubling\nthemselves. The more these are multiplied, the more complete is His manifestation, or rather His concealment. Glory be to Him who hides Himself by the manifestations of His light, and manifests Himself by drawing a veil over His face.

Viewed as unconditioned by modes and qualities, including even the potentiality of being thus unconditioned, it is the stage termed 'Unity'; and so possesses Concealment, Priority, and Existence from eternity. On the other hand, when viewed as conditioned by modes and qualities, it is the stage termed 'Singleness,' and in this aspect it is marked by Manifestation, Posteriority, and Duration to all eternity. Among these modes of the stage 'Singleness,' some are such that the qualification of the One\n\n\\(^1\\) Cp. 'Rosa mystica' in the Litany of the Virgin.

The first Emmanation is 'Unity' with the 'Truth' as being His image and mind (Logos endiathetos), but when evolved to view (Logos prophorikos), and as the channel of Being downwards, it is 'Unity' with a difference, which is sought to be expressed by the term 'Singleness' (W\u0101\u1e25idiyat instead of A\u1e25adiyat).\nBeing by them has regard to the stage called the 'Whole,'\\(^1\\) whether they imply the realization in the universe of things corresponding to the names 'Creator' and 'Sustainer,' etc., or merely attributes, such as Life, Knowledge, and Will. This is the class of attributes which pertain to the Divinity and the Sovereignty. The forms under which the One Real Being is conceived, when clothed with these names and attributes, are the 'divine substances.'\\(^2\\) The clothing of the outward aspect of Being\\(^3\\) with these forms does not necessitate multiplicity of beings. Other modes are such that the qualification of the One Real Being by them has relation to the various grades of 'mundane existences,'\\(^4\\) as, for instance, Difference, Property,\\(^5\\) and the phenomena which distinguish external objects from one another. The forms under which the One Real Being is conceived, when clothed with these modes, are 'the mundane substances,'\\(^6\\) and the clothing of the outward aspect of Being with these forms \\textit{does} necessitate a multiplicity of beings. Among these mundane substances, some are such that when Being, considered in the stage of the 'Unity of the Whole,'\\(^7\\) is interfused in them, and His effects and properties manifest themselves therein, these substances have the potentiality of being theatres exhibiting all the Divine names\u2014save those peculiar to the Divine Essence\u2014according to the varying strength of the manifestations, which may be powerful or feeble, irresistible or defeasible. These are the perfect individuals of the human race\u2014to wit, prophets and saints. Others, again, are such that they have the potentiality of being theatres exhibiting only some of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \\textit{Martaba i Jam'}.

These are the rest of the human race.\n\nThe Majesty of the One Real Being, viewed under the aspect of the 'Unity of the Whole,' which comprehends all His modes, both Divine and mundane,\\(^1\\) is for ever immanent in all these substances, and manifesting Himself in them. These substances are the parts of the whole Unity, whether they exist in the world of spirits or in that of 'ideas,'\\(^2\\) in the sensible and visible world, in the world that now is, or in that which is to come. The final Cause\\(^3\\) of all this process is the realization or manifestation of the perfection of the Divine names, which is termed \\textit{jal\u0101} and \\textit{istijl\u0101}. \\textit{Jal\u0101} signifies their outward manifestation according to their various modes; and \\textit{istijl\u0101} their display to the Deity Himself, according to these same modes. \\textit{Jal\u0101} is a visible and intelligible manifestation or representation, just as the whole is represented by its parts. Contrariwise, the perfection of the Divine Essence, is the manifestation of the One Real Being to Himself, for Himself, without relation to anything beside Himself. This is a secret and intelligible manifestation.\n\nAbsolute self-sufficiency is a quality involved in Divine Perfection. It signifies this, that in a general and universal manner all the modes, states, and aspects of the One Real Being with all their adherent properties and qualities, in all their presentations, past, present or future, manifested in all grades of substances, Divine and mundane, are present and realized in the secret thought of that Divine Being, in such wise that the sum of them all is contained in His Unity. From this point of view He is independent of all other existences, as it is said, 'God most glorious can do without the world':\\(^4\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) I.e., plurality summed up in Unity.\n\n\\(^2\\) The world of 'ideas' is the Platonic 'intelligible' world of ideas or archetypes, apprehended only by Reason (\\textit{nous}), as opposed to the 'sensible' world of phenomena apprehended by the senses\u2014'\\textit{\u0101lam i 'ilm\u012b}' as opposed to '\\textit{\u0101lam i 'ain\u012b}'.\n\n\\(^3\\) In Aristotle's language the end (telos) of a thing is its 'final cause'\u2014i.e., the reason of its existence.\n\n\\(^4\\) Koran, xxix. 5.\nThe robe of Love is independent, free\nFrom need to soil with dust its purity;\nWhen Actor and Spectator are the same\nWhat means this 'we' and 'thou'?

When, again, you abstract the\ncharacteristics of each species, i.e., their 'differences' and\n'properties,' all such species are gathered up into the reality\nof the genus 'animal.' Again, when you abstract the\ncharacteristics of the genus 'animal,' and those of all other\ngenera included in the higher genus 'growing body,' all such\ngenera coalesce under that genus, 'growing body.' So when\nyou abstract the characteristics of 'growing body,' and all\nother genera included along with it under the higher genus\n'body,' all such genera are united in the reality of the genus\n'body.' Furthermore, when you abstract the characteristics\nof 'body' and those of all other genera included therewith in\n\n1 Cp. Omar Khayy\u0101m, Quatrain 475, and 'Gulshan i R\u0101z,' p. 15,\nl. 143. 'He [God] is at once seer and thing seen.'\n2 Contingent being is opposed to necessary being. It is, so to speak,\nunreal matter permeated with Real Being. 'It thus is, and is not, and\npartakes both of existence and of non-existence,' as Jowett says.\n3 So Mans\u016br-i-Hall\u0101j: 'The numbers of Unity are only the counting of\nUnity.'\n4 The controversy of realism and nominalism raged among Moslems as\nwell as among European Schoolmen (see Schn\u00f6lders, 'Documenta,' etc.,\np. 3). J\u0101m\u012b was evidently a realist. He holds genus and similar general\nterms to be actual realities (ma'ni), and not mere names. The whole\nargument in this section rests on the assumption that these genera are real\nentities.\nthe higher genus 'substance,' to wit, the 'intelligences' and 'souls,' all such genera will be united in the reality of the higher genus 'substance'; so when you abstract the characteristics distinctive of 'substance' and 'accident,' these two genera are united into the [reality of the genus] 'contingent.' Finally, when you abstract the characteristic distinctions of 'contingent' and 'necessary,' these two are united in the 'Absolute Existence,' which is the veritable Being, existing of Himself, and not through another being beyond Himself. Necessity is His external quality, and 'Contingency' His internal quality\u2014i.e., they are the 'archetypal ideas'\\(^1\\) generated by His self-revelation to Himself when assuming His 'modes.'\n\nAll these distinctions, whether called 'difference' and 'property' or 'appearances' and 'characteristics,' are 'Divine Modes,' contained and involved in the 'Unity of the One Real Being.' First, these modes are represented under the form of the 'archetypal ideas' in the stage called the 'Divine Thought' (or knowledge);\\(^2\\) in the next place, in the stage of the 'sensible world,' when clothed with the properties and attributes of external existence\u2014which is the theatre of manifestation, a mirror reflecting the inner Divine Being\u2014these modes assume the forms of external objects.\n\nIt follows, therefore, that in the external world there is only One Real Being, who, by clothing Himself with different modes and attributes, appears to be endued with multiplicity and plurality to those who are confined in the narrow prison of the 'stages,' and whose view is limited to visible properties and results.\n\nCreation's book I studied from my youth,\nAnd every page examined, but in sooth\nI never found therein aught save the 'Truth,'\nAnd attributes that appertain to 'Truth.'\n\n\\(^1\\) A'y\u0101n i th\u0101bitah, the 'Ideas' of Plato's 'Intelligible World,' the archetypes or patterns of all things in the external and 'sensible world.' In the system of Plotinus these ideas are all contained in the first emanation, reason (nous). J\u0101m\u012b expresses 'intelligible world' by '\u0101lam i 'ilm, and 'sensible world' by '\u0101lam i 'ain.\n\n\\(^2\\) Martaba i 'ilm, i.e., 'aql i kull, nous, or Logos, the first epiphany or emanation.\nWhat mean Dimension, Body, Species,\nIn Mineral, Plant, Animal degrees?\nThe 'Truth' is single, but His modes beget\nAll these imaginary entities.\n\nFlash XIX.\n\nWhen one says that the multiplicity of things is comprehended in the Unity of the One Real Being, this does not mean that they are the parts contained in an aggregate, or as objects contained in a receptacle; but that they are as the qualities inherent in the object qualified or as consequences flowing from their cause. Take, for instance, the half, the third, the fourth, and other fractions up to infinity, which are potentially\\(^1\\) contained in the integer, one, though not actually manifested until they are exposed to view by repeating the various numbers and fractions.\n\nIt follows from this that when one says that the 'Truth' most glorious comprehends all beings, the meaning is that He comprehends them as a cause comprehends its consequences, not that He is a whole containing them as His parts, or as a vase containing things within it. God is too exalted above everything which is unworthy to touch the threshold of His holiness.\\(^2\\)\n\nThese modes\\(^3\\) are in the essence of the 'Truth,'\nLike qualities which qualify the 'Truth';\nBut part and whole, container and contained,\nExist not where God is, Who is the 'Truth.'\n\nFlash XX.\n\nThe manifestation or concealment of the modes and facets\u2014in other words, the circumstance that the outward aspect of Being does or does not clothe Himself with them\u2014causes no change in the 'substance' of such Being or in His essential\n\n---\n\n1 Potentiality and actuality are two of Aristotle's forms of thought, *dunamis* and *energeia* (*q\u012bwat* and *fi\u02bfl*).\n2 God pervades everything, but everything is not God. Thus the strict Monism of some previous statements is considerably toned down.\n3 *Sh\u0101\u02ben.* The 'Modalists' used the term 'modes' to indicate differences of form appearing in the One Substance (Harnack 'On Dogma,' iii. 53), and thus to avoid ditheism.\nattributes, but only a change in His connections and relations, which, in fact, necessitates no change in His essence. For instance, if 'Amr gets up from the right of Zaid and goes and sits down on his left, the relation of Zaid to 'Amr in respect to position will be changed, but his essence and his inherent qualities will remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the One Real Being underlying all outward existence does not become more perfect by clothing Himself with noble forms, nor does He degrade Himself by manifestation in inferior theatres. Although the light of the sun illuminates at once the clean and the unclean, yet it undergoes no modifications in the purity of its light; it acquires neither the scent of musk nor the colour of the rose, the reproach of the thorn nor the disgrace of the rugged rock.\n\nWhen the sun sheds his light for all to share,\nIt shines on foul things equally with fair;\nFair things do not augment its radiance,\nNor can foul things its purity impair.\n\nFlash XXI.\n\nThe Absolute does not exist without the relative, and the relative is not formulated without the Absolute; but the relative stands in need of the Absolute, while the Absolute has no need of the relative. Consequently, the necessary connection of the two is mutual, but the need is on one side only, as in the case of the motion of a hand holding a key, and that of the key thus held.\n\nO Thou whose sacred precincts none may see,\nUnseen Thou makest all things seen to be;\nThou and we are not separate, yet still\nThou hast no need of us, but we of Thee.\n\nMoreover, the Absolute requires a relative of some sort, not one particular relative, but any one that may be substituted for it. Now, seeing that there is no substitute for the Absolute, it is the Absolute alone who is the 'Qibla' of the needs of all relatives.\nNone by endeavour can behold Thy face,\nOr access gain without prevalent grace;\u00b9\nFor every man some substitute is found,\nThou hast no peer, and none can take Thy place.\n\nOf accident or substance Thou hast naught,\nWithout constraint of cause Thy grace is wrought;\nThou canst replace what's lost, but if Thou'rt lost,\nIn vain a substitute for Thee is sought.\n\nIt is in regard to His essence that the Absolute has no need\nof the relative. In other respects the manifestation of the\nnames of His Divinity and the realization of the relations of\nHis Sovereignty are clearly impossible otherwise than by\nmeans of the relative.\n\nIn me Thy beauty love and longing wrought:\nDid I not seek Thee how could'st Thou be sought?\nMy love is as a mirror in the which\nThy beauty into evidence is brought.\n\nNay, what is more, it is the 'Truth' who is Himself at\nonce the lover and the beloved, the seeker and the sought.\nHe is loved and sought in His character of the 'One who is\nall';\u00b2 and He is lover and seeker when viewed as the sum of\nall particulars and plurality.\u00b3\n\nO Lord, none but Thyself can fathom Thee,\nYet every mosque and church doth harbour Thee;\nI know the seekers and what 'tis they seek\u2014\nSeekers and sought are all comprised in Thee.\n\nFlash XXII.\n\nThe substance of each individual thing may be described\neither as the epiphany of Very Being\u2074 in the 'intelligible\nworld,' according to the particular facet whereof such thing\nis the monstrance, or as Very Being Himself made manifest\nimmediately,\u2075 in the same intelligible world and according to\nthe same facets.

And in each of these degrees He has certain names, attributes, and modes, applicable to that particular degree and not to the others; e.g., the names Divinity and Sovereignty [are not applicable] to the degrees called Subordination and the Creature-state. Consequently, to apply the names 'Allah' and 'the Merciful,' etc., to created beings is sheer infidelity and heresy.

In this aspect He cannot be described by epithets or attributes, and is too holy to be designated by spoken or written words; neither does tradition furnish an expression for His Majesty, nor has reason the power to demonstrate the depth of His perfection. The greatest philosophers are baffled by the impossibility of attaining to knowledge of Him; His first characteristic is the lack of all characteristics, and the last result of the attempt to know Him is stupefaction.\\(^4\\)\n\nTo you convictions and presumptions wrought\nBy evidence intuitive are naught;\nHow can one prove your own reality\nTo such as you who count all proofs as naught?\n\nHowever great our heavenly knowledge be,\nIt cannot penetrate Thy sanctuary;\nSaints blest with visions and with light divine\nReach no conceptions adequate to Thee.\n\n\\(^1\\) Siddiq, veracious, like Abu Bakr 'a\u1e63-\u1e62iddiq.'\n\\(^2\\) Zindiq.\n\\(^3\\) See note 2, p. 27.\n\\(^4\\) Hair\u0101n\u012b.

This degree is named the 'First Emanation,'\\(^2\\) because it is the first of all the manifestations of the Very Being; and above it there is no other degree than that of the 'Unmanifested.'\n\nThe third degree is named the 'Unity of the Whole Aggregate,'\\(^3\\) which contains in itself all the active and efficient manifestations. It is named the degree of 'Divinity.'\\(^4\\)\n\nThe fourth degree is the manifestation in detail of the degree named Divinity; it is the degree of the names and the theatres wherein they are manifested. These two last-named degrees refer to the outward aspect of Being wherein 'necessity'\\(^5\\) is a universal condition.\n\nThe fifth degree is the 'Unity of the Whole Aggregate,' which includes all the passive manifestations whose characteristic is the potentiality of receiving impressions, i.e., passivity. It is the degree of mundane existence and contingency.\\(^6\\)\n\nThe sixth degree is the manifestation in detail of the preceding degree; it is the degree of the sensible world.\\(^7\\) These two last degrees refer to the exterior of the intelligible world,\\(^8\\) wherein contingency is one of the invariable qualities.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) R\u016bm\u012b describes love as spiritual clairvoyance.

Contingency is not found in the immediate reflections of Being, but only in the reflections from the intelligible world of Divine Ideas.\nIt consists of the revelation of the Divine Mind to Himself under the forms of the substances of the contingent.\n\nConsequently, in reality there is but One Sole Being, who is interfused in all these degrees and hierarchies which are only the details of the Unity ('Singleness').\u00b9 'Very Being' in these degrees is identical with them, just as these degrees when they were in the Very Being were identical therewith. ['God was, and there was not anything with Him.']\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 The 'Truth' appears in all; would'st thou divine\nHow with Himself He doth all things combine?\nSee the wine-froth: the wine in froth is froth,\nYet the froth on the wine is very wine.\n\n'Tis the bright radiance of Eternity\nThat lights Not-being, as we men may see;\nDeem not the world is severed from the 'Truth':\nIn the world He's the world, in Him 'tis He.\n\nFlash XXV.\n\nThe 'Truth of truths' which is the essential, most exalted Divine Being is the Reality in all things. He is One in Himself, and 'unique' in such wise that plurality cannot enter into Him; but by His multiple revelations and numerous phenomenal displays He is sometimes presented under the form of substantial independent entities,\u00b3 and at other times under the form of accidental and dependent entities.\u2074 Consequently, the One Essential Being appears as multiple by reason of the numerous qualities of these substances and accidents, although in point of fact He is 'One,' and is in no wise susceptible of numbers or plurality.\n\nRase the words 'this' and 'that'; duality\nDenotes estrangement and repugnancy;\nIn all this fair and faultless universe\nNaught but one Substance and one Essence see.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Wahidiyat.

On the other hand, viewed in His aspect of multiplicity and plurality, under which He displays Himself when clothed with phenomena, He is the whole created universe. Therefore the universe is the outward visible expression of the 'Truth,' and the 'Truth' is the inner unseen reality of the universe. The universe before it was evolved to outward view was identical with the 'Truth'; and the 'Truth' after this evolution is identical with the universe. Nay, more, in reality there is but One Real Being; His concealment [in the Divine Mind] and His manifestation [in the sensible world], His priority and His posteriority [in point of time], are all merely His relations and His aspects. 'It is He who is the first and the last, the exterior and the interior.'\n\nIn the fair idols, goal of ardent youth,\nAnd in all cynosures lies hid the 'Truth';\nWhat, seen as relative, appears the world,\nViewed in its essence is the very 'Truth.'\n\nWhen in His partial modes Truth shone out plain,\nStraightway appeared this world of loss and gain;\nWere it and all who dwell there gathered back\nInto the Whole, the 'Truth' would still remain.\n\nFlash XXVI.\n\nThe Shaikh (may God be well pleased with him) says in the Fa\u1e63\u1e63 i Shu\u02bfaib\u012b, that the universe consists of accidents all pertaining to a single substance, which is the Reality underlying all existences. This universe is changed and renewed unceasingly at every moment and at every breath. Every instant one universe is annihilated and another resembling it takes its place, though the majority of men do not perceive this, as God most glorious has said: ['But they are in doubt regarding the new creation.']\n\n1 Koran, lvii. 3.

Text omitted in this manuscript.\nAmong Rationalists,\\(^1\\) no one has perceived this truth with the exception of the Asharians,\\(^2\\) who recognise it in certain departments of the universe, to wit, 'accidents,' as when they say that accidents exist not for two moments together; and also with the exception of the Idealists,\\(^3\\) called also Sophists, who recognise it in all parts of the universe, whether substances or accidents. But both these sects are in error in one part of their theory. The Asharians are wrong in asserting the existence of numerous substances\u2014other than the One Real Being underlying all existence\u2014on which substances, they say, depend the accidents which continually change and are renewed. They have not grasped the fact that the universe, together with all its parts, is nothing but a number of accidents, ever changing and being renewed at every breath, and linked together in a single substance, and at each instant disappearing and being replaced by a similar set. In consequence of this rapid succession, the spectator is deceived into the belief that the universe is a permanent existence. The Asharians themselves declare this when expounding the succession of accidents in their substances as involving continuous substitution of accidents, in such wise that the substances are never left wholly void of accidents similar to those which have preceded them. In consequence of this the spectator is misled into thinking that the universe is something constant and unique.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe ocean does not shrink or vaster grow,\nThough the waves ever ebb and ever flow;\nThe being of the world's a wave, it lasts\nOne moment, and the next it has to go.\n\nIn the world, men of insight may discern\nA stream whose currents swirl and surge and churn,\nAnd from the force that works within the stream\nThe hidden working of the 'Truth' may learn.\n\n\\(^1\\) Ahl-i na\u1e93r, as opposed to ahli shah\u016bd, men of spiritual intuition.\n\n\\(^2\\) The followers of Ab\u016b-l \u1e24asan al Ash\u0101r\u012b, died about 330 A.H.

See Lumsden, 'Persian Grammar,' ii: 323.\nAs regards the Sophists, though they are right in asserting the ideality of the whole universe, they are wrong in failing to recognise the Real Being underlying it, who clothes Himself with the forms and accidents of the sensible universe, and appears to us under the guise of phenomena and multiplicity; likewise in denying any manifestation of Real Being in the grades of visible things under the guise of these forms and accidents, whereas in truth these accidents and forms are only manifested to outward view by the operation of that underlying Real Being.\n\nPhilosophers devoid of reason find\nThis world a mere idea of the mind;\n'Tis an idea\u2014but they fail to see\nThe great Idealist who looms behind.\n\nBut the men gifted with spiritual intuition see that the Majesty of the 'Truth,' most glorious and most exalted, reveals Himself at every breath in a fresh revelation,\\(^1\\) and that He never repeats the same revelation; that is to say, He never reveals Himself during two consecutive moments under the guise of the same phenomena and modes, but every moment presents fresh phenomena and modes.\n\nThe forms which clothe existence only stay\nOne moment, in the next they pass away;\nThis subtle point is proven by the text,\n'Its fashion altereth from day to day.'\\(^2\\)\n\nThe root of this mystery lies in the fact that the Majesty of the 'Truth' most glorious possesses 'names' opposed\\(^3\\) to one another, some being beautiful and some terrible; and these names are all in continuous operation,\\(^4\\) and no cessation of such operation is possible for any of them. Thus, when one of the contingent substances, through the concurrence of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See 'Masnavi,' p. 24.\n\\(^2\\) Koran lv. 29.\n\\(^3\\) Lu\u1e6df and Qahr, or Jam\u0101l and Jal\u0101l, the opposite Divine attributes of mercy and vengeance, beauty and terror. The Divine economy is sometimes represented as effected by the eternal struggle between these two opposite phases of Deity, as manifested in Adam and Iblis, Abraham and Nimrod, Moses and Pharaoh, etc. (see 'Masnavi,' p. 301), a daring Monist hypothesis, which, needless to say, is not pursued into its consequences.\n\\(^4\\) These 'names,' like the Stoic logoi, are sometimes spoken of as ideas, sometimes as forces or energies.\nthe requisite conditions, and the absence of opposing condi-\ntions, becomes capable of receiving the Very Being, the mercy\nof the Merciful takes possession of it, and the Very Being is\ninfused\\(^1\\) into it; and the Very Being thus externalized,\\(^2\\)\nthrough being clothed with the effects and properties of such\nsubstances, presents Himself under the form of a particular\nphenomenon, and reveals Himself under the guise of this\nphenomenon. Afterwards, by the operation of the terrible\nOmnipotence which requires the annihilation of all pheno-\nmena and all semblance of multiplicity, this same substance\nis stripped of these phenomena. At the very moment that it\nis thus stripped this same substance is reclothed with another\nparticular phenomenon, resembling the preceding one, through\nthe operation of the mercy of the Merciful One. The next\nmoment this latter phenomenon is annihilated by operation\nof the terrible Omnipotence, and another phenomenon is\nformed by the mercy of the Merciful One; and so on for as\nlong as God wills. Thus, it never happens that the Very\nBeing is revealed for two successive moments under the guise\nof the same phenomenon. At every moment one universe is\nannihilated and another similar to it takes its place. But he\nwho is blinded by these veils, to wit, the constant succession\nof similar phenomena and like conditions, believes that the\nuniverse constantly endures in one and the same state, and\nnever varies from time to time.\n\nThe glorious God, whose bounty, mercy, grace,\nAnd loving-kindness all the world embrace,\nAt every moment brings a world to naught,\nAnd fashions such another in its place.\n\nAll gifts soever unto God are due,\nYet special gifts from special 'names' ensue;\nAt every breath one 'name' annihilates,\nAnd one creates all outward things anew.\n\nThe proof that the universe is nothing more than a combi-\nnation of accidents united in a single essence, i.e., the\n\n\\(^1\\) *If\u0101\u1e93at*, production by emanation.

For example, when one defines man as a 'rational animal'; and animal as a 'growing and sentient body, possessed of the faculty of voluntary movement'; and body as a 'substance possessing three dimensions'; and substance as an 'entity which exists per se and is not inherent in any other subject'; and entity as 'an essence possessed of reality and necessary being'\u2014all the terms used in these definitions come under the category of 'accidents,' except this vague essence which is discerned behind these terms. For 'rational' signifies an essence endued with reason; 'that which is growing' signifies an essence endued with the faculty of growth; and so on. This vague essence is, in fact, the 'Truth,' the Very Being, who is self-existent, and who causes all these accidents to exist. And when the philosophers allege that these terms do not express the differences themselves, but only the invariable marks of these differences whereby we express them, because it is impossible to express the true differences otherwise than by these invariable marks or others more recondite still, this assumption is inadmissible and undeserving of serious attention. And even if we admit it as a hypothesis, we affirm that whatever is essential in relation to special substances is accidental in relation to the Very Truth; for though this alleged essential quality is part of the essence of a particular substance, it is extraneous to the Very Truth upon whom it is dependent. And to say that there is any substantial entity other than the One Essential Being is the height of error, especially when the spiritual intuition of the men of truth, which is borrowed from the lamp of prophecy, attests the contrary,\u00b9 and when their opponents cannot cite any proofs in favour of their own view. ['God saith what is true, and directeth man in the right path.']\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Cp. 1 Cor. ii. 15, 'He that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.'

Consequently, power and action are ascribed to the creature ('abd) because of the manifestation of the 'Truth' under the form of the creature, and not because such action is really effected by the creature himself.

Self-assertion is presumption towards God.\nFlash XXVII.\n\nSince the qualities, states, and actions manifested in the theatres are in reality to be ascribed to the Very Being manifested in those theatres, it follows that if a certain evil or imperfection is found in any of them, it may possibly be caused by the non-existence of something else; for Being, qu\u00e2 Being, is pure good; and whenever it seems to us that something existent contains evil, that is owing to the lack of something else which ought to exist, and not to the really existing Being, qu\u00e2 Being.\\(^1\\)\n\nAll good and all perfection that you see\nAre of the 'Truth,' which from all stain is free;\nEvil and pain result from some defect,\nSome lack of normal receptivity.\n\nPhilosophers have alleged that the proposition 'Very Being is pure good' is a necessary (self-evident) one.\\(^2\\) By way of illustration, they have given some examples. Thus, they say cold, which spoils the fruit and is an evil in relation to the fruit, is not an evil [absolutely], because it is one of the qualities [of Being], and in this respect one of His perfections; but [it is evil] because it prevents the fruit attaining the perfection proper to it. Thus too killing, which is an evil, is not an evil by reason of the murderer's power of killing, nor by reason of the power of the instrument to cut, nor of the liability of the body of the person killed to be cut; but [it is an evil] because it deprives a person of life, which is the mere negation [of something positive];\\(^3\\) and so on.\n\n\\(^1\\) 'Being is good in whatever it be. If a thing contains evil, that proceeds from \"other\"' ('Gulshan i R\u0101z,' l. 871). This represents evil as something positive. So Dante says matter is intractable ('Paradiso,' Canto I.). Augustine, like J\u0101m\u012b, makes evil merely a deficiency of good. See 'Confessions,' Book VII., chapter xii.\n\n\\(^2\\) Zar\u016brat. Necessary truths are those of which the contrary is inconceivable. Of course, in J\u0101m\u012b's time necessity of thought was supposed to involve necessity of the object of thought.\n\n\\(^3\\) The ideas that God is all and determines all, and that evil is unreal, may seem true to men like Augustine, glowing with religious emotion, but are untenable in practice, and if translated into hard theological formulas become a stumbling-block. Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn quietly drops them when it comes to a question of practice.\nWherever Being's ambit doth extend,\nGood and nought else but good is found, O friend;\nAll evil comes from 'not-being,' to wit,\nFrom 'other,' and on 'other' must depend.\u00b9\n\nFlash XXVIII.\n\nShaikh \u1e62adr-ud-d\u012bn Q\u016bniav\u012b\u00b2 (may God sanctify his secret) says in the book Nu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63: 'Knowledge is one of the qualities pertaining to Being; that is to say, that every existing substance is endued with knowledge; and the difference in the degrees of knowledge results from the differences of these substances in their reception, whether perfect or imperfect, of Being. Thus a substance capable of receiving Being in a most complete and perfect way is capable of receiving knowledge in the same way; and that which is only capable of receiving Being imperfectly is endued with knowledge in the same degree. This difference originates in the stronger or weaker influence of 'necessity'\u00b3 or 'contingency' over each substance. In every substance in which the influence of 'necessity' is the stronger, Being and knowledge are most perfect; in the remainder, in which the influence of 'contingency' is more prevalent, Being and knowledge are more imperfect.'\n\nIt would seem that what the Shaikh states as to knowledge specially being a quality appertaining to Being is meant to convey one example only, because all the other perfections which are likewise qualities pertaining to Being, such as life, power, will, etc., are in the same position as knowledge.\n\nCertain other [\u1e62\u016bf\u012bs] have said: 'No single existent thing is without the quality of knowledge'; but knowledge is of two kinds, one ordinarily called knowledge and the other not so called. Both kinds, according to the men of truth, belong to the category of knowledge, because they recognise the\n\n\u00b9 'Gulshan i R\u0101z,' l. 871.\n\u00b2 'An-Nu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63 f\u012b t\u0101\u1e25q\u012bq i \u1e6daur il makhs\u016bs,' by the celebrated \u1e62\u016bf\u012b Shaikh Sadr-ud-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad bin Ish\u0101q al Q\u016bniav\u012b, died 672 A.H.

It is in the second class that we must place \"water,\" for example, which is not ordinarily considered as possessed of knowledge. But we see that it distinguishes between up and down hill; it avoids the rise and runs downwards; again, it sinks into porous bodies, whilst it only wets the surface of dense bodies and passes over them, etc. Therefore, it is by virtue of the quality of knowledge that it runs, according to the capacity of one object to admit it, and the absence of opposing properties in such objects. But, in this degree, knowledge is manifested only under the form of nature.\\(^1\\) In this manner knowledge is immanent in all other existing things; or, rather, all perfections pertaining to Being are immanent in all things without exception.\n\nBeing, with all its latent qualities,\nDoth permeate all mundane entities,\nWhich, when they can receive them, show them forth\nIn the degrees of their capacities.\n\nFlash XXIX.\n\nJust as the 'Truth,' the Very Being, in virtue of His absolute purity, is immanent in the substances of all beings in such wise as to be essentially identical with these substances, as these substances are, when in Him, identical with Him; in like manner His perfect qualities are entirely and absolutely immanent in all qualities of the substances in such wise as to be identical with their qualities, even as their qualities when in those perfect qualities were identical therewith. For example, the quality of knowledge, in the knowledge of the knower of particulars,\\(^2\\) is identical with this knowledge of particulars, and in the knowledge of him who knows universals\\(^2\\) is identical with this knowledge of universals; in active and passive\\(^3\\) knowledge it is identical\n\n\\(^1\\) I.e., in unconscious objects.

It certainly makes the sense clearer.\nwhilst in other passages he seems to say that what is ascribed to the Majesty of the 'Truth' is merely an emanation\\(^1\\) of Being; and as regards the qualities dependent on existence, they are effects produced by the substances themselves. These two statements may be thus reconciled: The Majesty of the 'Truth' most glorious is revealed in two manners\u2014the first the inward, subjective\\(^2\\) revelation, which the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs name 'Most Holy Emanation';\\(^3\\) it consists in the self-manifestation of the 'Truth' to His own consciousness from all eternity under the forms of substances,\\(^4\\) their characteristics and capacities. The second revelation is the outward objective manifestation, which is called 'Holy Emanation';\\(^5\\) it consists in the manifestation of the 'Truth,' with the impress of the properties and marks of the same substances.\\(^6\\) This second revelation ranks after the first; it is the theatre wherein are manifested to sight the perfections which in the first revelation were contained potentially in the characteristics and capacities of the substances.\n\nOne grace a host of suppliant forms designed,\nA second to each one his lot assigned;\nThe first had no beginning\u2014of the last,\nWhich springs from it, no end can be divined.\\(^7\\)\n\nWherefore, the ascription of existence and the perfections dependent thereon] to the 'Truth' most glorious and most exalted has regard to the two revelations taken together; and the ascription to the 'Truth' of existence alone, and of its dependents to the substances, has reference to the second revelation; for the only result of the second revelation is the emanation of Being into the substances, and so making\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *If\u0101\u1e93at*, production by emanation.

Neither is He like to anything that exists, nor is anything like to Him; nor is He determinate in quantity, nor comprehended by bounds, nor circumscribed by differences of situation, nor contained in the heavens. He sits upon the throne, after that manner which He Himself hath described, and in that sense which He Himself means, which is a sitting far removed from any notion of contact, or resting upon, or local situation; but both the throne itself, and whatsoever is upon it, are sustained by the goodness of His power, and are subject to the grasp of His hand.\\(^2\\) But He is above the throne and above all things, even to the utmost ends of the earth; but so above as at the same time not to be a whit nearer the throne and the heaven; since He is exalted by (infinite) degrees above the throne, no less than He is exalted above the earth, and at the same time He is near to everything that hath being\u2014nay, \u2018nearer to men than their jugular veins, and is witness to everything\u2019\\(^3\\)\u2014though His nearness is not like the nearness of bodies, as neither is His essence like the essence of bodies.

As to the attribute of perfection, He wants no addition. As to being, He is known to exist by the apprehension of the understanding; and He is seen as He is by immediate intuition, which will be vouchsafed out of His mercy and grace to the holy in the eternal mansion, completing their joy by the vision of His glorious presence.\\(^1\\)\n\n**His Power.**\u2014...

He it is who gave all things their beginning; He is the Creator and Restorer, the sole Operator of what He pleases; there is no reversing His decree nor delaying what He hath determined; nor is there any refuge to man from his rebellion against Him, but only His help and mercy; nor hath any man any power to perform any duty towards Him but through His love and will.\\(^4\\) ...\n\n---\n\n1 The beatific vision of Dante's Paradise.

The Koran, the Law, the Gospel, and the Psalter, are books sent down by Him to His apostles, and the Koran, indeed, is read with tongues, written in books, and kept in hearts; yet as subsisting in the essence of God it doth not become liable to separation and division when it is transferred to hearts and to papers.\\(^2\\) Thus, Moses also heard the word of God without voice or letter, even as the saints behold the essence of God without substance or accident. . . .\n\nHis Works.\u2014He exists after such a manner that nothing besides Him hath any being but what is produced by His operation, and floweth from His justice after the best, most excellent, most perfect, and most just models.\\(^3\\) . . .\n\nAll things were created by Him\u2014genii, men, the devil, angels, heaven, earth, animals, plants, substance, accident, intelligible, sensible.

Now, He created all things in the beginning for the manifestation of His power and His will and the confirmation of His word, which was true from all eternity.

In an often-quoted passage Plato says the Ideal Good is beyond existence (epekeina t\u0113s ousias).\n\nNext in the descending scale he placed the 'Intelligible World' of Ideas or archetypes, conceived by reason (Nous). Then came the 'Sensible World' of phenomena, which were only copies of the divine archetypes reproduced in matter.\\(^1\\) This matter was of itself non-existent (m\u0113 on); in fact, a mere potentiality of taking the imprints of the archetypes.\n\nWith the Stoics monism made its appearance, and took the place of the previous dualism. For Plato's 'Ideas' they substituted Logoi, thoughts, forms, or forces immanent in the universe. And these Logoi were often spoken of as all summed up in the one Logos. Most Stoics, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, regarded the universe as natura naturans, manifested Logos or Anima Mundi; others regarded the Logoi as only functions of matter (natura naturata).\n\nPhilo, the Alexandrian Jew, who lived at the same time as St. Paul, managed to combine this Logos doctrine with the Hebrew Scriptures.\\(^2\\) By allegorical interpretation he identified the Stoic Logoi with the angels mentioned in the Scriptures, and at the same time he reduced the personal Yahveh of the Scriptures to the abstract Being of Greek philosophy.\n\n\\(^1\\) See 'Masnavi,' p. 226.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Book of Wisdom, probably the work of a Hellenizing Jew, prepared the way for Philo, but the cautious writer speaks not of Greek 'Logos,' but of Hebrew 'Wisdom,' as the first effluent, the mirror and express image of the Deity (Wisd. vii. 26).\nThe Hebrew prophets had almost personified the 'Word of the Lord' and 'Wisdom'; and Logos, with its double meaning of thought and word (ratio and oratio), was easily identified with 'Word' and 'Wisdom.' As Dr. Hirschfeld has pointed out, Amr and Kalima underwent a similar process in the Koran.\\(^1\\) The Logos, having been thus personified, plays a very important part in Philo's system. It becomes the Demiurge or Architect of the world. The metaphor of generation is employed to picture the mode of its operation. Sometimes it is figured as masculine, sometimes as a female agent, but in either case it is one of the parents of the world of phenomena.\\(^2\\) On the whole it may be said that Philo's leading principles were, first, to remove the Deity far away from any contact with matter, and, secondly, to explain the existence of the world by the hypothesis of intermediate and subordinate agencies through whom the Deity worked, so as not to touch matter Himself.\n\nHence Philo's system was dualism. And this dualistic tendency was fostered by the growing influence of Manicheism. Manes, who formulated this old Persian dualism, did not live till the third century A.D., but many of the Gnostic sects of the second century A.D. held what were in fact Manichean opinions. And this led some, like Basileides, to emphasize the separation of the Deity from the evil material world. Basileides, for instance, though he firmly believed in God, declared in hyperbolical language that He was ouk \u014dn, 'without existence' in the sense of the phenomenal existence known to man.\\(^3\\) Others, like Valentinus, imagined a series of \u00c6ons or intermediate Intelligences, so as to remove the transcendental God as far as possible from contact with matter. These \u00c6ons were possibly the prototypes of the \u0160\u016bfi Ten Intelli-\n\n\\(^1\\) 'New Researches in the Qor\u0101n,' 1902, p. 15. Some \u0160\u016bfi theologians identified Mu\u1e25ammad with 'Universal Reason,' or Logos. See Palmer's 'Oriental Mysticism,' p. 43, and 'Masnav\u012b,' p. 179.\n\n\\(^2\\) Yonge's translation of Philo, i. 359 and ii. 205 (quoted in Appendix to 'Masnav\u012b'). Tholuck, when he encounters this idea in 'Masnav\u012b,' p. 77, and 'Gulshan i R\u0101z\u012b,' l. 622, finds it shocking; but few like to face the historical antecedents or parallels of cherished tenets.\n\n\\(^3\\) See Mansel's 'Gnostic Heresies,' p. 147.\ngences and of the Celestial Hierarchies of Dionysius, which supplied the frame of Dante's Paradise.\n\nPlotinus, who lived in the third century A.D., was a mystic who busied himself with philosophy only to seek corroboration of his mystical beliefs. He started with the conviction that the One was all in all, and that all phenomena had no existence apart from it. He tried to reach a conception of the transcendental One by abstracting or stripping off all limitations and conditions incident to phenomenal existence, and by assuming that the residuum was the One. But as this residuum was void of all positive contents, it could not be conceived by common reason, and could be described only in negative terms, as 'Unconditioned,' 'Infinite,' 'Incomprehensible,' and the like. Reason could not say what it was, but only what it was not. His position thus seems to be precisely that of agnosticism, as expounded in H. Spencer's 'First Principles.' But here the resemblance ceases. Plotinus held that the impotence of reason to conceive the Absolute proved that ordinary reason must be entirely discarded in these matters, so as to give free play to the superior faculty of spiritual intuition or intuitive reason (Nous), which alone is competent to deal with them.\\(^1\\) This faculty discerns the One to be no mere negation, but a supreme energy of self-manifestation.\\(^2\\) Without any diminution or decrease of itself the One ever pours forth or rays out effluences. Hence arises an image or reflection of the One in Nous or Reason, the First Emanation, comprehending all being and all thought. From this proceeded in like manner the Second Emanation, called the 'World-soul,'\\(^3\\) Psych\u0113, which acted as the mediator between the supra-sensible and the sensible worlds. This, again, generated the particular souls, human, animal, and vegetive, and, lastly, all inorganic substances. The substratum of all\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Just so the Nominalists and their modern followers deny to reason a voice, not only on questions of pure ontology, but on all points settled by traditional dogma (Harnack, vi. 163); but thus to discard reason altogether is to make every superstition impregnable.\n\n\\(^2\\) The scholastic term was 'Actus purus,' pure actuality or energizing.\n\n\\(^3\\) The later history of the 'World-soul' is given in Renan's 'Averroes.' Dante censured it, and the Lateran Council of 1518 anathematized it. Pope, following Spinoza, revived it.\nthese manifestations of the One in the sensible world was matter, which was non-existent of itself (m\u00e9 on), and yet the basis of each sensible object (bathos ekastou);\u00b9 in other words, it was a mere potentiality of receiving the imprint of the Divine effluences.\n\nThe One, the Reason, and the World-soul, constitute the so-called Plotinian Trinity, which is one, not of equality, but of subordination. Plotinus says Reason (Nous) is the Logos of the One, and Soul (Psych\u0113) the Logos of the Reason.\u00b2\n\nSo much for the theory. As regards practice Plotinus held that man\u2019s duty was to return to the One.\u00b3 The motive for this return was the love of the divine spark in his soul for its source, and its consequent craving to be reunited therewith. The One was itself unmoved, but attracted its effluents through being the object of their love and desire. The return was to be effected by retracing the downward course into the realm of matter. By what Dionysius later called the \u2018negative way,\u2019 the mystic aspirant must abstract and strip off all the material and sensuous accretions which had overlaid his real essence. This was to be effected,\u2074 first, by practising civic virtues, next the purifying virtues of asceticism and self-mortification, and finally the deifying virtue of contemplation.\u2075 At last he would transcend all the barriers separating him from the One, and would be absorbed and reunited with the One. Of this blessed state he could only hope to gain transient glimpses during life, but when the body perished he would abide for ever one with the One. Plotinus sums up by saying this is \u2018the flight of the Alone to the Alone.\u2019\n\nAs Dr. Bigg points out, this mystical ascent of the soul is\n\n\u00b9 \u2018Not-being\u2019 is an equivocal term\u2014nothing in relation to God, but a very pernicious something in relation to man.\n\u00b2 Ennead, V., 1 and 6, quoted in Whittaker\u2019s \u2018The Neoplatonists,\u2019 p. 37, note 1.\n\u00b3 Plotinus followed Plato, who had said man\u2019s object should be to attain likeness to God as far as possible (Homoi\u014dsis t\u014d the\u014d).\n\u2074 This threefold division of the virtues agrees with the \u1e62\u016bf\u012b division of the Law, the Path, and the Truth.\n\u2075 Contemplation, The\u014dria was Theou or\u0101sis, the \u2018beholding God\u2019 according to the Schoolmen\u2019s derivation of the word. Plotinus says the One is seen \u2018in presence which is better than science\u2019 (kata parousian epist\u0113m\u0113s kreittona).\ndescribed by Augustine almost in the words of Plotinus:\\footnote{See Bigg's 'Confessions of St. Augustine,' p. 321 and note. All these Plotinian ideas were worked into Christian theology by Clement and Origen, himself a pupil of Ammonius Saccas, under whom Plotinus had studied. See Bigg's 'Christian Platonists of Alexandria.'} 'Thus as we talked and yearned after the eternal life, we touched it for an instant with the whole force of our hearts. We said then, if the tumult of the flesh were hushed; hushed these shadows of earth, sea, and sky; hushed the heavens and the soul itself, so that it should pass beyond itself and not think of itself: if all dreams were hushed and all sensuous revelations, and every tongue and every symbol; if all that comes and goes were hushed\u2014they all proclaim to him that hath an ear: \"We made not ourselves; He made us who abideth for ever.\"\u2014But suppose that, having delivered their message, they held their peace, turning their ear to Him who made them, and that He alone spoke, not by them, but for Himself, and that we heard His word, not by any fleshly tongue, nor by an angel's voice, nor in the thunder, nor in any similitude, but His voice, whom we love in these His creatures\u2014suppose we heard Him without any intermediary at all\u2014just now we reached out, and with one flash of thought touched the Eternal Wisdom that abides above all. Suppose this endured, and all other inferior modes of vision were taken away, and this alone were to ravish the beholder, and absorb him and plunge him in mystic joy, might not eternal life be like this moment of comprehension?'\n\nThis is an admirable statement of the Plotinian 'return' to the One.\\footnote{See Ghazz\u0101l\u012b's account in Appendix III. Also 'Hayy Ibn Yokdhan' or 'Philosophus autodidactus,' published by Pococke in 1671, and now translated by Dr. Br\u00f6nnle under the title 'The Awakening of the Soul' (Murray, 1905). See his Introduction, pp. 17-19. A passage of this is quoted by the Quaker Barclay in his 'Apology,' edition of 1678, p. 126. Plotinus's own account may be read in Thomas Taylor's translation (Bell and Son's reprint, 1895, pp. 301-324).} It also well illustrates the main characteristic of the system\u2014viz., its ultimate dependence on emotion rather than on intellect. Philosophy is only the handmaid of theology, only used to support and justify pre-existing beliefs. When his reason lands him in contradictions, as it must do when it tries to transcend its limits and outsoar the very\natmosphere that bears it up, Plotinus straightway falls back on feeling and the inner light. Love and faith are a mighty spell, as Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b says,\\(^1\\) and with Plotinus love and faith are always at hand to supplement the deficiencies of pure intellect.\n\nThe best accounts of Plotinus are those of Harnack in his 'History of Dogma,' English translation, i. 347; of Caird in his 'Evolution of Theology in the Greek Philosophers,' ii. 210; and of Whittaker in his 'Neoplatonists.' Opinions differ as to whether he is to be classed as a Monist or as a Dualist. This would depend on whether his 'not-being' is to be regarded as nothing or as something. Be this as it may, no one can read his impassioned outpourings without seeing that his theological reasoned statements by no means give the full measure of his beliefs. What he did believe in with a very passion of conviction was a Deity endued in some sense with the principal attributes of a personal God.\n\n\\(^1\\) 'Masnav\u012b,' p. 262.\nAPPENDIX III\n\nGHAZZ\u0100L\u012a ON MYSTICAL UNION\n\n'Prayers' have three veils, whereof the first is prayers uttered only by the tongue; the second is when the mind, by hard endeavour and by firmest resolve, reaches a point at which, being untroubled by evil suggestions, it is able to concentrate itself on divine matters; the third veil is when the mind can with difficulty be diverted from dwelling on divine matters. But the marrow of prayer is seen when He who is invoked by prayer takes possession of the mind of him who prays, and the mind of the latter is absorbed in God whom he addresses, his prayers ceasing and no self-consciousness abiding in him, even to this extent that a mere thought about his prayers appears to him a veil and a hindrance. This state is called 'absorption' by the doctors of mystical lore, when a man is so utterly absorbed that he perceives nothing of his bodily members, nothing of what is passing without, nothing of what occurs to his mind\u2014yea, when he is, as it were, absent from all these things whatsoever, journeying first to his Lord, then in his Lord. But if the thought occurs to him that he is totally absorbed, that is a blot; for only that absorption is worthy of the name which is unconscious of absorption.\n\n'I know these words of mine will be called an insipid discourse by narrow theologians, but they are by no means devoid of sense. Why? The condition of which I speak is similar to the condition of the man who loves any other things\u2014e.g., wealth, honour, pleasures; and just as we see some\n\n1 The Arabic text and a Latin translation of this passage are given by Tholuck in his 'Ssufismus,' pp. 3 and 105.\n2 Dhikr is the term used to denote the orisons of the Dervishes.\nengrossed by love, we see others overpowered by anger so that they do not hear one who speaks, or see one who passes, and are so absorbed by their overwhelming passion, that they are not even conscious of being thus absorbed. For so far as you attend to the absorption of your mind, you must necessarily be diverted from Him who is the cause of your absorption. . . .\n\n'And now, being well instructed as to the nature of \"absorption,\" and casting aside doubts, do not brand as false what you are unable to comprehend. God most high saith in the Koran: \"They brand as false what they do not comprehend.\" The meaning of \"absorption\" having been made clear, you must know that the beginning of the path is the journey to God, and that the journey in God is its goal, for in this latter, absorption in God takes place. At the outset this glides by like a flash of light, barely striking the eye; but thereafter becoming habitual, it lifts the mind into a higher world, wherein the most pure, essential Reality is manifested, and the human mind is imbued with the form of the spiritual world whilst the majesty of the Deity evolves and discloses itself. Now, what first appears is the substance of angels, spirits, prophets, and saints, for a while under the veil of I know not what beautiful forms, wherefrom certain particular verities are disclosed; but by degrees, as the way is opened out, the Divine Verity begins to uncover His face. Can anyone, I ask, who attains a glimpse of such visions, wherefrom he returns to the lower world disgusted with the vileness of all earthly things, fail to marvel at those who, resting content with the deceits of the world, never strive to ascend to sublimer heights?'\n\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u062f\u0647\u200c\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0644\u06cc\n\u062f\u0631\u06a9\u0647
