(Taketori no Okina no Monogatari.) A Japanese Romance of the Tenth Century. Translated, with Notes, etc., by F. Victor Dickins, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe Coming of the Lady Kaguya and the Days of Childhood.\n\n(Kaguya Hime no Oitachi.)\n\nFormerly there lived an old man, a bamboo-hewer, who hewed bamboos on the bosky hill-side, and manywise he wrought them to serve men's needs, and his name was Sanugi no Miyakko. Now one day, while plying the hatchet in a grove of bamboos, was he suddenly ware of a tall stem, whence streamed forth through the gloom a dazzling light. Much marvelling, he drew nigh to the reed, and saw that the glory proceeded from the heart thereof, and he looked again and beheld a tiny creature, a palm's breadth in stature and of rare loveliness, which stood midstmost the splendour. Then he said to himself, \"Day after day, from dawn to dusk, toil I among these bamboo-reeds, and this child that abides amidst them I may surely claim as mine own.\" So he put forth his hand, and took the tiny being, and carried it home, and gave it to the goodwife and her\n\n1 Mukashi\u2014here, as often, equivalent to the Latin 'olim.'\n2 Or Saruki, or Sadaki. Sanugi, or Sanuki, is a province of Shikoku. Miyakko is mya-tsu-ko, servant of the August Home, that is, of the Court or Palace, equivalent to ason (asomi, nobi) or Baron. The expression was also used in the sense of 'ruler,' 'governor.' But, like many other titles, it degenerated, as here, into a mere name.\nwomen to be nourished. And passing fair was the child, but so frail and tender that it was needful to place it in a basket to be reared. But after lighting upon this gift whilst hewing bamboos, he ceased not from his daily toil, and night after night, as he shone through the reeds and opened their internodes, came he upon one filled with grain of gold, and so, ere long, he amassed great wealth. Meanwhile the child, being duly tended, grew daily in stature, and after three months\u2014wonderful to relate!\u2014her stature was as that of a maiden of full years. Then her tresses were lifted\u00b9 and she donned the robe of maidenhood, but still came not forth from behind the curtain.\u00b2 Thus cherished and watched over and tenderly reared, grew she fair of form, nor could the world show her like, and there was no gloom in any corner of the dwelling, but brightness reigned throughout, nor ever did the Ancient fall into a sorrowful mood but that his sadness was chased away when he beheld the maiden, nor was any angry word ever heard beneath that roof, and happily the days went by. Long the Ancient hewed bamboos, and gathered gold, and thus it was that he came to flourish exceedingly in the land. After this wise grew the girl to maidenhood, and the Ancient named her Mimurodo Imube no Akita, but she was more commonly called the Lady Kaguya, the Precious Slender Bamboo of the Field of Autumn.\u00b3 Then for three days a great feast was held, and\n\n\u00b9 Anciently the hair was allowed to fall in long tresses on either shoulder. At the age of 13 or 14 these were brought up and fastened in a sort of knot on the crown or side of the head. The custom is alluded to in a \"tanka\" of the Many\u014dsh\u016b (The Myriad Leaves\u2014an Anthology of the tenth century):\n\nTachibana no Under the long-roof bright with the hues reflected\ntereru nagaya ni from the orange-blooms,\nwaga ineshi: have I slumbered\u2014\nunahi bakari wa a girl of tender years,\nkami agetsuran ka? shall my tresses ever be bound up?\n\n\u00b2 Hung before the toko, or alcove, or upper end of the house-place. The meaning is that she remained within her mother's care, unbetrothed and unmarried.\n\n\u00b3 Mimurodo means the place of three caves, alluding, perhaps, to the aboriginal habit (still practised in Yezo) of living in caves or half-underground huts. It is sometimes written mimoro, which has the signification of a sacred (mi) place. Imube (imbe or imibe) were originally the hereditary builders of Shinto shrines. In certain provinces\u2014Sanuki was one\u2014the designation became a family-name. Mr. Satow explains it as signifying an association (me or be) eschewing (imi) uncleanness. Akita is the Field of Autumn, more strictly the laboured field made\nthe neighbours, one and all, menfolk and womenfolk, were invited, and they came in merry crowds and noble was the revelry.\\(^1\\)\n\n**The Wooing of the Maiden.**\n\n*(Tsuma-goi.)*\n\nNow the gentles dwelling in those parts, men of name and eke men of low degree, thought of nothing but how they might win this fair maiden to wife, or even gaze upon her beauty, and so distracted were they with love that they let their passion be plain to all the world.\\(^2\\) Around the fence and about the porch they lingered, but in vain, for no glimpse of the maiden could be got, nor slept they when night came but wandered out in the darkness, and made holes here and there in the fence and peered through these, but to no purpose did they strain their eyes, for never caught they sight of her on whom they longed to gaze, and thus sped their wooing from the twilight-hour of the monkey onwards. Well-nigh beside themselves were they with love and woe, but no sign was vouchsafed them, and though they essayed to gain speech of some among the household, no word of answer ever got they. So it was, yet many a noble suitor still lingered thereabouts, watching through the livelong day and through the livelong night, to catch some glimpse of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Such appears to be the meaning of the text, here probably corrupt. The original is *otoko \u014dna kirawazu yobitsudoyete ito kashikoku asobu*, which the commentary thus explains, *otoko \u014dna no kirai naku nigiyashiku yobitsudoyetaru nari*. Another reading is *otoko wa ukekirawazu yo hi hodoyate*, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Which was contrary to good manners, and so a proof of the intensity of their love.\nmaiden; but those of low degree after a time bethought them 'twere vain to pace up and down thus bootlessly, and they departed and came no more. But there tarried five suitors, true lovers, and worthier of the name belike, in whose hearts, love died not down, and night and day they still haunted the spot. And these noble lovers were the Prince Ishizukuri\\(^1\\) and the Prince Kuramochi, the Sadaijin Dainagon Abe no Miushi and the Chiunagon \u014ctomo no Miyuki, and Morotada, the Lord of Iso.\n\nWhen a woman is somewhat fairer than the crowd of women, how greatly do men long to gaze upon her beauty! How much more filled with desire to behold the rare loveliness of the Lady Kaguya were these lords, who would touch no food, nor could wean their thoughts from her, and continued to pace up and down without the fence, albeit their pain was thus in no wise eased. They indited supplications, but no answer was vouchsafed; they offered stanzas of complaint, but these too were disregarded; yet their love lessened no whit, and they affronted the ice and snow of winter and the thunderous heats of mid-summer\\(^2\\) with equal fortitude. So passed the days, and upon a certain day these lords summoned the Hewer and prayed him to bestow his daughter upon one of them, bowing before him and rubbing their palms together suppliantwise. But he said: \"No child of mine by blood is the maiden, nor can she be constrained to follow my will.\" And the days and the months went by, and the lords returned to their mansions, but their thoughts still dwelt upon the Maiden, and many a piteous prayer they made, and many a supplication they indited, nor cared they to cease their wooing, for surely, they said to themselves, the Maiden might not remain unmated for ever. And they\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These names, at least such as require it, will be explained below.\n\n\\(^2\\) Minazuki, i.e. Kami-nashi-tuki, part of July and August under the old calendar. The name signifies \"godless month,\" because during it all the gods were believed to be absent from the world holding council in the bed of the Stream of Heaven (the Milky Way), to determine the fortunes of men during the ensuing year. This legend is of Chinese origin, as indeed are most Japanese legends in a greater or less degree, and embodies, perhaps, some memory of the time when the ancestors of the Chinese dwelt about the sources of the Yellow River, which was supposed to be the continuation on earth of the Stream of Heaven.\ncontinued their suit, and so plainly did they manifest the strength of their passion that the Ancient was constrained to say to the Maiden, \"By the grace of Buddha,\\(^1\\) through the cycle of changes hast thou come to us, daughter, and from babe to maid have we cherished thee, and I pray thee hearken to the words of an old man who loveth thee passing well.\"\n\nAnd the Maiden answered:\n\n\"What might my father say that his daughter would not give dutiful ear to? I know not if I came to thee through the cycle of changes, but this I know, that thou art my dear father.\"\n\nThen the Ancient replied:\n\n\"Right happy do thy words make me, daughter; but consider, I am an old man whose years outnumber seventy, today I may pass away or to-morrow, and 'tis the way of the world that the youth cleave to the maid, and the maid to the youth, for thus the world increaseth, nor otherwise are things ordered.\"\n\nBut Kaguya said:\n\n\"Oh father, what mean these words you utter; must it then be as you say?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" replied the Ancient, \"though strangely hast thou come to us through the cycle of changes, yet hast thou the nature of a woman, while such are thy father's years that he may not long tarry in the world to protect thee. These lords have sought thee to wife for months and years, listen, prithee, to their supplication, and let them have speech with thee, each in due turn.\"\n\nKaguya answered:\n\n\"Not so fair am I that I may be certain of a man's faith, and were I to mate with one whose heart proved fickle, what a miserable fate were mine! Noble lords, without doubt, are these of whom thou speakest, but I would not wed a man whose heart should be all untried and unknown.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Or \"my child, my Buddha,\" i.e. \"my darling.\"\nAnd the Ancient said:\n\"Thou speakest my very thoughts, daughter. But, prithee, what manner of man hast thou a mind to mate with? Assuredly these lords are of noble nature and nurture.\"\n\nThen she answered:\n\"Nay, 'tis but that that I would know what the quality of these noble gentlemen's constancy may be. So like are the hearts of men that one may by no means easily part the better from the worse; go, I pray you, to these lords, and say to them, your daughter will follow him who shall prove himself the worthiest to mate with.\"\n\nAnd the Ancient, nodding assent to her words, said:\n\"'Tis well.\"\n\nNow the night fell, and the suitors assembled and serenaded the Maiden with flute-music and with singing, with chanting to accompaniments and piping, and with cadenced tap and clap of fan, in the midst whereof came forth the Ancient, and thus spake them:\n\n\"Months and years have my lords tarried by this poor hut, and their servant presents his respectful homage and ventures to offer his humble gratitude for their high favour. But many are his years, and he knows not whether he may pass away to-day or to-morrow. After this wise hath he spoken to the Maiden and prayed her to choose one among your lordships for a husband; but she would fain learn which of you be the worthiest, and him alone will she wed. Fair seemed her speech to your servant, perchance your lordships, too, will not disdain her words.\" And they nodded assent, saying: \"It is well.\" Whereupon the Ancient went within and spoke with the damsel, and thus she expressed her will:\n\n\"In Tenjiku\u00b9 is a beggar's bowl of stone, which, of old, the Buddha himself bore, in quest whereof let Prince Ishizukuri depart and bring me the same. And on the mountain\n\n\u00b9 The Japanese form of the Chinese Buddhist name for Northern India, said to be a corruption of \"Shintub,\" or the Chinese form of the name now known as Sindu.\nH\u00f4rai, that towers over the Eastern ocean, grows a tree with roots of silver and trunk of gold and fruitage of pure white jade, and I bid Prince Kuramochi fare thither and break off and bring me a branch thereof. Again in the land of Morokoshi men fashion fur-robes of the pelt of the Flame-proof Rat, and I pray the Dainagon to find me one such. Then of the Chiunagon I require the rainbow-hued jewel that hides its sparkle deep in the dragon\u2019s head; and from the hands of the Lord of Iso would I fain receive the cowry-shell that the swallow brings hither over the broad sea-plain.\u201d\n\nBut the Ancient said:\n\n\u201cTerrible tasks these be\u2014the things thou requirest, daughter, are not to be found within the four seas; how may one bid these noble lords depart upon like quests?\u201d\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d quoth the damsel, \u201cthese be no tasks beyond stout men\u2019s strength.\u201d\n\nThereupon the Ancient saw that there was nothing for it but to obey, and he went out from her, and told the suitors all that had passed, saying:\n\n\u201cThus hath it been willed, and these are the tasks that must be accomplished that your worth may be known.\u201d\n\nBut the princes and the lords murmured among themselves, and said:\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis, forsooth, that the Lady holds in disdain our courteous suit.\u201d So they turned and with heavy hearts fared each to his own home.\n\nThe Sacred Begging-Bowl of the Buddha.\n\n(HOTOKE NO MI ISHI NO HACHI.)\n\nNow the days to come seemed void of pleasure to Prince Ishizukuri\u00b9 if never he might gaze upon the Lady\u2019s beauty, and he fell to turning over in his mind whether he might not light upon the Holy Buddha\u2019s bowl if he went up and down the\n\n\u00b9 Ishizukuri no miko. Miko is noble (mi) child (ko), originally a prince of the blood royal. Ishizukuri (tsukuri) may mean \u2018stone-built,\u2019 or, in a bad sense, \u2018stone-counterfeit.\u2019 Sei-y\u014d zukuri is still a common expression for \u2018western-fashioned.\u2019\nland of Tenjiku in search thereof. But the Prince cared not to set out lightly on such a journey, and after much pondering over the matter he bethought himself it were after all a vain quest to fare tens of thousands of leagues on the chance of finding, in all the broad land of Tenjiku, a certain beggar's dish. Therefore, he let it be made known to the Lady that he had that very day undertaken the Quest; but towards Tenjiku he fared not a league, but hid him in Yamato, and abode there three years, at the end whereof, in a hill-monastery in T\u014dchi, he found upon an altar of Binzuru\u00b9 a bowl blackened by age and begrimed with smoke, which he took and wrapped in a web of brocade. He then attached the gift to an artificial Bloom-branch,\u00b2 and sought again the dwelling of the Lady Kaguya, and caused the gift to be carried in to her. And as she looked upon the Bowl she marvelled greatly, and in it lay a scroll, which she opened, and a stanza was writ thereon:\n\nUmi yama no Over seas, over hills\nmichi no kokoro wo hath thy servant fared, and weary\ntsukushi-hate: and wayworn he perisheth:\nishi no hachi no O what tears hath cost this bowl of stone,\nnamida nagare wa!\u00b3 what floods of streaming tears!\n\nThen the Lady looked again to see if the Bowl shone with light,\u2074 but not so much as a firefly's twinkle could she discover, and she caused the bowl to be returned to the Prince, and with it was bestowed a scroll whereon was writ a verse:\n\n\u00b9 Pindola, the Succourer in Sickness, one of the sixteen Rakan. In the Butsu-z\u014d-zui this Arhat (Rakan) is the first enumerated, and is called Hatsuwa tasha. He is represented as an old man seated by the edge of a precipice overlooking the sea, and holding in his right hand a feather-brush (?) to keep off flies, in his left a scroll (or tablet ?) of the law.\n\n\u00b2 It was a pretty custom in Old Japan to accompany a gift with a branch of peach or plum or wild cherry in full bloom.\n\n\u00b3 The last two lines, by a word-play, may be read ishi no wa chi no namida nagare wa? which would mean 'of a truth this stone hath been the bed of a stream of tears of blood.' In winter, when the rivers in Japan are at their driest, the stony central portion of the broad river-bed is laid bare, along which flows the diminished stream.\n\n\u2074 The intrinsic splendour of a true relic of the Buddha is meant.\nOku tsuyu no hikari wo da ni mo yadosumashi:\nOgura yama nite nani motomekemu?\n\nOf the hanging dewdrop not even the passing sheen dwells herein:\nOn the Hill of Darkness, the Hill of Ogura,\nwhat couldst thou hope to find?\n\nThereupon the Prince cast away the Bowl and made answer thuswise:\n\nShirayama ni ayeba hikari no usuru ka to:\nhachi wo sute mo tanomaruru kana!\n\nNay, on the Hill of Brightness what splendour will not pale?\nwould that away from the light of thy beauty the sheen of yonder Bowl might prove me true!\n\nBut no answer would the Lady make, nor give ear to any supplication, and the Prince, wearied with bootless complainings, after awhile turned him sadly away and departed. And still men say of a crestfallen fellow, \"hachi (haji) wo suteru.\"\n\n1 Situate in the district in which the Bowl had been found. In gura (kura with nigori) is involved the sense of darkness (kurashi), though the character used in writing the name means \"granary.\" So in a tanka (ode) of the Many\u014dsh\u016b:\n\nYuu sareba,\nOgura no yama ni naku shika no koyoi wa nakazu,\nine ni kerashi!\nAs the shades of evening fall on the Hill of Ogura, the calling deer cease this night their cry, and in slumber is wrapped the world.\n\nAnd again:\n\nOhoigawa ukayeru fune no kagari-bi ni Ogura no yama wa na nomi narikeri!\nOn the waters of the Ohoi float the fisher-barks; was it in the glare of their decoy-fires, O Hill of Ogura, thou gainedst thy name?\n\n2 Shirayama is said to be opposite in situation as in the meaning involved in its name (originally, no doubt, Shiroyama or Castle Hill, but corrupted into Shirayama or White Hill), to Ogurayama. The intrinsic brilliance of the Bowl was lost in that of the Lady's beauty, if it were cast aside out of her presence its sheen would become visible.\n\n3 Hachi, bowl, by nigori becomes haji, shame; hence the word-play, conveying a sense of the shame which attends the defeat of a tricky and dishonest scheme.\nThe Jewel-Bearing Branch of Mount H\u014drai.\n\n(H\u014drai no tama no yeda.)\n\nOf a wily turn was Prince Kuramochi, and he gave out to the world that he was about to take the baths in the land of Tsukushi, but to the Lady Kaguya he let it be declared that he was setting out upon the Quest after the Jewel-laden Branch. So he fared towards Naniwa with some of his squires, but not many, for he alleged him fain to travel without state, and took with him but a few of those who were in closest attendance upon their lord, and even these, after they had watched him with their eyes as he took boat, went back to Miako. Thus the Prince made folk think he had departed faring towards Tsukushi or towards H\u014drai, but he tarried three days at Naniwa, and then turned him again capitalwards, being sculled up-stream. Beforehand all needful commands had been given, and six men of the Uchimaro family, the most noted craftsmen of the time, had been sought out and lodged in a dwelling aloof from the world-ways and surrounded with a triple fence, and there the Prince too retreated. Then he furnished the chief of the craftsmen with resources drawn from sixteen of his farms,\u00b9 the produce of which he allotted to that purpose, and caused furnaces to be erected and a jewel-laden branch to be fashioned differing no whit from that which the Lady Kaguya had bidden him go in quest of. Thus cunningly the Prince laid his scheme, and taking the branch with him set off secretly, and embarking in a boat journeyed down to Naniwa, whence he let it be made known to his squires that he had returned, and assuming the guise of one terribly worn and spent with travel, awaited their coming. And his squires and retainers came accordingly to meet him, where-\n\n\u00b9 This seems to be the general sense of an obscure and probably corrupt passage\u2014shirasetaimaitaru kagiri juroku so wo (so?) kami ni kudo wo akete, etc. I have followed the hints given in the commentary of Ohide. Perhaps the passage ought to read, juroku sho (so) no kami no kura, etc. Another commentator suggests that So o kami is the county of S\u014dkami, and retains kudo, furnace, the reference then being to sixteen furnaces or pottery ovens in S\u014dkami. But this interpretation seems far-fetched. Possibly a sort of pun is intended on the Prince's name, Kuramochi, which really meaning (Kuruma-mochi), \"guardian or keeper of the Mikado's carriages,\" may also be read as signifying \"superintendent of the Royal treasuries or granaries.\"\nupon the Prince caused the Branch to be placed in a coffer which was covered with brocade, and a clamour arose as he went through the city. \"Wonderful! the Prince Kuramochi comes up to the capital, bearing with him the Udonge\\(^1\\) in bloom.\" But the Lady Kaguya, when these tidings reached her, said to herself, \"This Prince hath surely gotten the better of me,\" and her heart broke within her. While thus matters stood was heard a knocking at the entrance, and presently it was announced that the Prince had presented himself and begged to be permitted to speak with the Lady, although still wearing his travelling-garb, for he had perilled his life in the quest after the Jewel-laden Branch, and had won it, and now desired to lay it at her feet. The Ancient received the message, and took the Branch and carried it within, and attached to it was a scroll whereon was written a stanza:\n\nItazura ni, Though it were at the peril\nmi wa nashitsu tomo, of my very life,\ntama no ye wo without the Jewel-laden Branch\ntaorade, saye wa in my hands never again\nkayerazaramashi! would I have dared to return!\n\nBut the Lady looked on the Branch and was sad, and the Ancient came to her hastily, saying, \"'Tis the very branch, daughter, thou desiredst the Prince to bring thee from Mount H\u014drai, and he has accomplished the Quest thou badest him undertake without failing in any particular, nor mayst thou delay his guerdon; without tarrying to change his raiment, and before seeking his own mansion, has he hasted hither, nor longer canst thou refuse his suit.\"\n\nBut the maiden answered nothing, resting her chin mournfully on her palm, while the tears streamed in floods over her cheeks. Meanwhile the Prince, thinking that now he need dread no denial, remained waiting in the porch-way, and the Ancient resuming, said: \"The like of this Jewel-laden Branch is not to be found within the four seas, thou\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Buddhist Udumbara; the fig-tree (*Ficus glomerata*), believed to flower once only in three thousand years, hence the expression is used in respect of anything very rare and marvellous.\ncanst not refuse the promised guerdon, nor is the Prince uncomely of person.\"\n\nBut the Lady answered: \"Hard it is thus still to oppose my father's will, but this thing is deemed unattainable whereof I laid the quest upon the Prince, yet how easily hath he won it; a bitter grief it is to thy daughter.\" Then the Ancient fell to busying himself with putting the chamber in order, and after awhile went out and accosted the Prince again, saying: \"Your servant would fain know what manner of place it may be where grows this tree\u2014how wonderful a thing it is, and lovely and pleasant to see!\" And the Prince answered: \"The year before yesteryear, on the tenth of the second month (Kisaragi), we took boat at Naniwa and sculled out into the ocean, not knowing what track to follow; but I thought to myself, what would be the profit of continuing life if I might not attain the desire of my heart; so pressed we onwards, blown where the wind listed. If we perished even what mattered it, while we lived we would make what way we could over the sea-plain, and perchance thus might we somehow reach the mountain men do call H\u014drai. So resolved we sculled further and further over the heaving waters, until far behind us lay the shores of our own land. And as we wandered thus, now deep in the trough of the sea we saw its very bottom, now blown by the gale we came to strange lands, where creatures like demons fell upon us and were like to have slain us. Now, knowing neither whence we had come nor whither we tended, we were almost swallowed up by the sea; now, failing of food we were driven to live upon roots; now, again, indescribably terrible beings came forth and would have devoured us; or we had to sustain our bodies by eating of the spoil of the sea. Beneath strange skies were we, and no human creature was there to give us succour; to many diseases fell we prey as we drifted along knowing not whitherwards, and so tossed we over the sea-plain, letting our boat follow the wind for five hundred days. Then, about the hour of the dragon, four hours ere noon, saw we a high hill looming faintly over the watery waste. Long we gazed at it, and marvelled at the\nmajesty of the mountain rising out of the sea. Lofty it was and fair of form, and doubting not it was the mountain we were seeking, our hearts were filled with awe. We plied the oar, and coasted it for two days or three, and then we saw a woman, arrayed like an angel, come forth out of the hills, bearing a silver vessel which she filled with water. So we landed and accosted her, saying: 'How call men this mountain?' and she said, \"'Tis Mount H\u014drai,' whereat our hearts were filled with joy. 'And you, who tell us this, who then are you,' we inquired. 'My name is H\u014dkanruri,' she answered, and thereupon suddenly withdrew among the hills. On scanning the mountain, we saw no man could climb its slopes, so steep were they, and we wandered about the foot thereof, where grew trees bearing blooms the world cannot show the like of. There we found a stream flowing down from the mountain, the waters whereof were rainbow-hued, yellow as gold, white as silver, blue as precious ruri;\u00b9 and the stream was spanned by bridges built up of divers gems, and by it grew trees laden with dazzling jewels, and from one of these I broke off the branch which I venture now to offer to the Lady Kaguya. An evil deed, I fear me, but how could I do otherwise than accomplish the object of my Quest? Delightful beyond all words is yonder mountain, in all the world there exists not its like. After I had plucked off the branch, my heart brake within me, and I hasted on board, and we sped hitherwards with a fair wind behind us, and after some four hundred days came to Naniwa, whence I departed without tarrying, so great was my desire to lay the Branch at the feet of the Lady, nor did I even change my raiment, soddened with the brine of ocean.\"\n\nMoved by the piteous tale the Ancient composed a stanza:\n\nKuretake no Amid the gloomy bamboo-groves\nyoyo no take toru long long have I hewed bamboos,\nnoyama ni mo: even upon the wild hill-sides;\nsaya wa wabishiki but thus sad an internode\nfushi wo nomi miji! (thus sad a fortune) never have\nI beheld.\n\n\u00b9 See below.\nThe Prince read the verse and said: \"For these many days have I endured misery, now methinks shall I know peace,\" and indited a stanza in reply:\n\nWaga tamoto kiyo kawakereba,\nwabishiki no chigusa\u00b9 no kazu mo wasurarenubeshi!\n\nThe sleeve of my garment but this day hath become dry,\nand of miseries the countless kinds I have endured\nno longer will be remembered by me.\n\nAt this juncture came six men within the fence, one after the other, and one of them carried a cleft bamboo, bearing a scroll in the cleft, and said: \"The chief of the craftsmen, Ayabe no Uchimaro, humbly represents that he and his fellows for the space of a thousand days broke their hearts and spent their strength in fashioning the Jewel-laden Branch. Yet, though long and heavy their labours, they have received no wage for their toil, and he humbly prays that they may be accorded due payment that they may have wherewithal to buy food for their wives and little ones.\" Then he lifted up the bamboo with the scroll in its cleft. The Ancient, with his head on one side, marvelled as he heard the words of the caaftsman, but the Prince was beside himself with dismay, and felt his liver perish within him. And the Lady Kaguya, hearing of the matter, commanded that the scroll should be brought to her, whereupon it was taken within and unrolled and thus was it writ thereon: \"Lately His Highness shut himself up with us mean craftsmen, and caused a jewel-laden branch of the rarest beauty to be fashioned, and promised me by way of guerdon the mastership of the craft. And after pondering over the matter, coming to know that the Branch was to be bestowed upon the Lady Kaguya, who was about to become a Lady of the Palace, I deemed it well to seek aid at the Lady's dwelling that my guerdon might be given me and the wages due be paid to us.\"\n\n\u00b9 Chigusa, thousand herbs\u2014an expression signifying a thousand kinds, or the innumerable, that is, all kinds and varieties of wretchedness.\nAs the Lady Kaguya read these words, her face, which had been clouded with grief, turned radiant with joy, and she summoned the Ancient and smilingly said to him: \"Ha! a veritable Branch from H\u014drai this; by my faith, let his false and trickful Highness be dismissed at once and take his Jewel-laden Branch with him!\"\n\nThe Ancient nodded assent, saying: \"As the Branch is clearly a counterfeit, there need be no hesitation about returning it.\"\n\nAnd with the Branch the Lady Kaguya, her heart now free of gloom, sent this stanza:\n\nMakoto ka to kikite mitsureba,\nkoto no ha wo kazareru tama no yeda ni zo arikeru!\nWas it the true branch of H\u014drai I asked as I gazed on thy gift:\nmere leaves of sound (words) were the jewels that adorned it,\nthe Branch of Bloom thou broughtest me.\n\nSo was the False Branch returned to the Prince. The Ancient remembered the lying tale wherewith he had been beguiled, and regarded His Highness with anger, who meanwhile stood still a space, not knowing whether to go or stay. But as the sun sank deeper in the west, he bethought him again, and slunk off. Now the Lady Kaguya summoned the craftsmen who had caused this bother, and praised them, giving them ample largesse, whereat they rejoiced greatly, saying, thus they knew things would be, and departed. But on their way homewards they were set upon and punished by order of the Prince, blood was shed, and all their treasure was taken from them, and thus despoiled they fled and vanished. But His Highness felt he was put to unexampled shame, and his discomfiture threw a shadow over the remainder of his days. \"Not only,\" he complained, \"have I lost my mistress, but my name has become a reproach throughout the land.\" Thereupon he fled to the deepest recesses of the hills, and dwelt there all the rest of his days. Times and again the chiefs and retainers of his household sought to discover their lord's retreat, but could not, and he\nwas as it were dead. And it was out of this history of His Highness Prince Kuramochi that arose the expression \"tamazakaru.\"\u00b9\n\n**The Flame-proof Fur-Robe.**\n\n*(Hi-nezumi no Kawagoromo.)*\n\nThe Sadaijin\u00b2 Abe no Miushi\u00b3 was a lord of wealth and substance, and mighty withal. In the year whereof we speak, came to our country a merchant of Morokoshi,\u2074 by name W\u014dkei,\u2075 on board a ship of that land, to whom was indited a letter requiring him to buy for the Sadaijin a fur-robe, which was said to exist, made of the pelt of the Flame-proof Rat,\u2076 and Ono no Fusamori, one of the trustiest of his lord's squires, was despatched in charge of the missive. So Fusamori took the letter and went down to the coast,\u2077 and delivered it to W\u014dkei, to whom he likewise gave gold. W\u014dkei unrolled the scroll and read it, and made answer thus:\n\n\"The Flame-proof Fur-Robe is not to be obtained in my country; men have talked of such a robe, but it has not been seen. If it exists anywhere, it is a thing that should assuredly be brought to this land, but 'tis very hard to get by way of trade. Nevertheless, if by any hap such a robe has been carried to India, the great merchants may be able to obtain it, and should they fail, the gold now bestowed upon me shall be returned to him who brought it, to hand back to the Lord Sadaijin.\"\n\nUpon the ship's return from the land of Morokoshi,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 An expression which may by taken to mean either, \"blooming with jewels,\" or \"preciously blooming,\" or again, *tamashii-zakaru*, \"to have one's wits gone a wool-gathering.\"\n\u00b2 Sadaijin, Left Great Minister, next in rank to the Daij\u014ddaijin or Premier.\n\u00b3 In some texts Abe no Mimuraji. Mi-muraji is Great Chieftain, see Mr. Chamberlain's translation of the Kojiki.\n\u2074 An invented name. The characters are \u738b\u537f.\n\u2075 A common designation of China, even up to recent times. Its derivation is uncertain.\n\u2076 Hi-nezumi. Nezumi (root-gnawer or perhaps rice (ine) gnawer) is a generic name for Rodents. In the legend is doubtless involved an allusion to the asbestos-cloth mentioned in Colonel Yule's admirable work on Marco Polo, as a product of the country lying north of China proper.\n\u2077 Probably to Hakata in Chikuzen, a favourite resort of Chinese traders in early times.\nthe Sadaijin, having tidings that Fusamori was on board and was making ready to come up to the capital, despatched a swift horse to meet him, so that he journeyed from Tsukushi to Miako in the short space of seven days. Then a letter was delivered to the Sadaijin, who unrolled it and read these words: \"The Flame-proof Fur-robe have I finally won, after great toil and the despatch of many men in quest thereof, for difficult it is to find now, as it was of old. Long ago a venerable priest from India brought such a robe into our land, and I heard that it was preserved in a certain temple lying among the remote western hills. I besought the aid of the ruler of the district, which was accorded me, and was allowed to purchase the robe, but the money was not sufficient, and fifty riy\u014ds of my own monies were added, which doubtless will be repaid to me ere the ship depart, or the Robe will be returned as pledge for the same.\" \"Nay,\" cried the Sadaijin, \"what is this talk about the gold; let the merchant have his gold without delay; welcome to me beyond words is the fruit of his quest.\" And turning his face towards the land of Morokoshi, he bowed him thrice, clasping his hands thankfully. Then, looking at the casket wherein the Fur-Robe was laid folded, he saw that it was beautifully adorned with inlaid work of various kinds of precious ruri, and the Robe itself was of a glaucous colour, the hairs tipped with shining gold, a treasure indeed of incomparable loveliness, more to be admired for its pure excellence than even for its virtue in resisting the flame of fire. \"'Tis the very Robe, how pleased, methinks, the Lady Kaguya will be,\" cried the Sadaijin, and laid the Robe\n\n1 The distance is described as more than 900 ri (the Chinese li are meant) by the land route.\n\n2 Liang or taels, greatly exceeding in purchasing value, but to an extent not now definitely ascertainable, the tael or riy\u014d of the present day.\n\n3 In the Commentary ruri is said to be a kind of precious stone that stands the fire, ten kinds of which are found within the famous \u5927\u79e6\u570b Ta Ts'in country, supposed by some to be the Roman Empire, by others the countries lying west of China. Possibly varieties of turquoise or lapis lazuli are covered by the name. It has also been identified with the emerald, and Dr. Williams says it is the Sanskrit Vaidurya, which appears to be a sort of lapis lazuli.\n\n4 Probably a brilliant (lit. golden) shade of blue is meant. The Commentary explains the tint as superior to that of the sky \u7a7a\u9752.\ncarefully in the casket which he attached to a Branch of Bloom; and putting on his fairest apparel,\u00b9 and feeling assured that the gift would win him his wooing, added a scroll, whereon was writ a stanza, and carried the gift to the Lady's abode.\n\nKagiri naki  \nomoi ni yakenu  \nkawagoromo:  \ntamoto kawakite  \nkiy\u014d koso wa mime!\n\nEndless are the fires of love  \nthat consume me, yet unconsumed  \nis the Robe of Fur:  \ndry at last are my sleeves,  \nfor shall I not see her face this day!\n\nThus cheering himself, the Sadaijin reached the entrance of the Lady's dwelling, and the Ancient came out and took the casket and bore it within to the Lady Kaguya. And she gazed awhile upon the Robe and said:\n\n\"A fair robe of fur it seems to be, but till it be proved, how can we know if it be not false.\"\n\nBut the Ancient answered:\n\n\"However that may be, deign to invite the Sadaijin to enter; the like of yonder Robe the world doth not appear to hold; be not so distrustful, daughter, nor drive men to despair.\"\n\nThen he went out and invited the Sadaijin to enter. And now the Lady, though her heart was heavy, felt she must receive him, for greatly as the Ancient had grieved over her continued maidenhood, seeking ever to find her a worthy mate, yet never had he sought to constrain her, seeing how deeply she dreaded to give herself to any man.\n\nBut she said to the Ancient: \"If this Robe be thrown amid the flames and be not burnt up, I shall know it is in very truth the Flame-proof Robe, and may no longer refuse this lord's suit. As it has not its fellow in the world, and 'tis averred to be, without doubt, the famous Robe that resists flame, the proof may well be dared.\"\n\nAnd the Ancient agreed, and told the Sadaijin it must be so, whereupon he answered: \"What doubt can there be\u2014\n\n\u00b9 More literally, taking the greatest pains with his personal appearance, as if he was going to a Court Levee\u2014on mi no ke\u014d (ke\u014dh\u014d) s\u014d itaku shite.\neven in the land of Morokoshi the Robe was not to be got, and could only be found after long and toilsome search; nevertheless, as the Lady will have it so, let the Robe be cast among the flames.\"\n\nAnd a fire was kindled, and the Robe was flung therein and in a flash of flame perished utterly. So was it shown that it was not, in truth, made of the famous Flame-proof Fur. When the Sadaijin saw this, his face grew green as grass, and he stood there astonished. But the Lady Kaguya rejoiced exceedingly, and caused the casket to be returned with a scroll in it whereon was writ a verse:\n\nNagori naku mo moyu to shiriseba,\nkawagoromo omoi no hoka ni okite mimashi wo!\n\nWithout a vestige even left thus to burn utterly away,\nhad I dreamt it of this Robe of Fur,\nAlas the pretty thing! far otherwise would I have dealt with it.\n\nBut the Sadaijin withdrew discomfited and shut himself up in his mansion. And men, hearing that Abe had accomplished his Quest and was abiding with the Lady Kaguya, inquired at the Lady's dwelling if that were so, and were told the fate of the Robe of Fur and that he abode not with the Lady, and hearing this they exclaimed \"An ahenashi,\" piece of work in truth, this fruitless job.\"\n\nThe Jewel in the Dragon's Head.\n\n(Tatsu no kubi no tama.)\n\nThe Dainagon \u014ctomo no Miyuki, being in his mansion, assembled his household and deigned to say: \"In the head of the Dragon lies a jewel, rainbow-hued, and on him who\n\n1 There is a word-play here on the i (hi) of omoi, hi meaning 'flame.'\n2 Ahenashi (ayenashi), with nigori, abenashi. Ayenashi \u6562\u7121 or \u7121\u7aef is a locution used of a bootless undertaking, something feeble, awkward and unsuccessful.\n3 Dainagon, Great Councillor, next in rank to the Udaijin, or Right Great Minister, who followed the Sadaijin.\n4 Otomo seems to mean many multitudes or companies of men. Miyuki\u2014the personal name\u2014is homophonous with the word signifying a Royal Progress or Promenade.\nshall win it me shall nought remain unbestowed he may desire.\" His men listened to their lord's words, and one said humbly: \"The high behests of our lord his servants hear with trembling awe; but how shall a mortal man light upon such a jewel, or draw it forth from the head of a Dragon!\" Whereto the Dainagon answered: \"If ye call yourselves the servants of your lord, even at the peril of your lives are ye bound to do his bidding. The jewel whereof I speak is not to be found in our land, nor yet in the land of Tenjiku, nor in that of Morokoshi; the Dragon is a monster that creeps up the hill-slopes from the sea and rushes down them into the ocean\u2014but of what can ye be thinking in shirking this Quest?\" And they said: \"As our lord wills, so must it be, and albeit the task were a perilous one, we will not shirk it.\" Whereupon the Dainagon regarded them with a smile, and cried, \"Ye would not surely put shame on your lord's name nor refuse to do his bidding.\"\n\nThen he dismissed them upon the Quest after the Dragon's head gem, and that they might not want for food and support on their way, endless store of silk and cotton and coin and other things needful were bestowed upon them. And the Dainagon promised that he would live in seclusion, awaiting their return, and bade them not cast their looks homewards until they had won the jewel. So they hearkened humbly each of them and departed.\n\nThey were bidden to take the jewel from the Dragon's head, but where to turn their steps they could not tell, and they fell to reproaching their lord for being thus bewitched by a fair face. Then they divided amongst them what had been bestowed upon them, and some withdrew to their houses, there to lie hid, while others went whither they\n\n---\n\n1 That is, in none of the Sankoku (three countries, Japan, India, and China), of which, in imitation of the Chinese Sankwoh, the civilized world was supposed to consist.\n\n2 In some provinces, says the Commentary, the rivers, roaring down the narrow valleys to the sea during the heavy rains, are supposed to be changed into this particular form of Dragon, which has been seen to lift itself from the sea-surface towards a descending cloud\u2014an interpretation doubtless of the phenomena attending the formation of a waterspout.\nlisted. 'Twas very well to be loyal to parent and prince, as the maxim runs, they muttered, but a behest so burdensome as this could not be obeyed, and bitterly they reproached their lord for having laid upon them such a task.\n\nMeanwhile the Dainagon deeming his mansion common and mean, and unfit to receive the Lady Kaguya, caused it to be adorned throughout and made beautiful with curious lacquer-work in gold and silver, as well as with plain bright lacquer, and over the roof he ordered silken cloths of divers colours to be drawn, and every chamber to be hung with fine brocade, and the panels of the sliding partitions to be enriched with cunningly-wrought pictures, and the splendour of the mansion passed all description. And feeling sure that ere long he should obtain possession of the Lady Kaguya, he put away all the women of his household, and passed the days and the nights in solitude, and through the days and the nights awaited the return of his men; and so a year came and went, but still he heard no tidings of them. At last, weary of waiting, and sick at heart with the lack of news, he took two of his squires with him, and thus meanly served journeyed to Naniwa, and made inquiry there if any of his folk had taken boat in quest of the Dragon, to slay the monster and win the jewel that lay in his head; but the shipmen laughed and answered: \"'Tis a strange thing thou speakest of; on such a business be sure no boat has left this haven.\" Thereupon the Dainagon said to himself: \"These be but silly, feeble ship-folk, how should they know aught of this matter? Myself I will take my bow and despatch this monster, and draw the jewel from his head, nor wait longer for these laggard fellows of mine.\" So he took a boat, and embarked in it, and fared over sea until the land lay far behind him, and still he caused the boat to be sculled on until his keel rode on the waters of distant Tsukushi. Then without any foresign the wind rose and the air darkened, and the craft was driven hither and thither, blown about by the gale; now it seemed as though the boat must founder in the trough of the sea, now great billows threatened to topple over and overwhelm it, while the thunder-god\nthundered so appallingy that his monstrous drums seemed to hang close overhead. So the Dainagon lost heart, and cried aloud, saying: \"Never before have I been in such perilous case, alas! what help may be invoked?\" And the helmsman answered: \"Long have I voyaged in these waters, yet so terrible an ill fortune as this never hath befallen me; if we sink not to the bottom of the sea, the thunder will strike us; if by good hap the favour of the gods save us from these perils, the gale will drive the boat far amid (the barbarian islands of) the southern ocean; woe worth the day I took service with my lord of evil fate, where death, belike, must be the wages!\" And as he spoke the shipman burst into tears. But the Dainagon said:\n\n\"He who fares over sea must needs trust himself to the helmsman, who should be steadfast as a high hill. Why speakest thou then thus despairfully?\" and as he uttered these words a terrible sickness came upon him. Then the helmsman answered: \"Is your servant then a god that he can render service now? The howling of the wind and the raging of the waves and the mighty roar of the thunder are signs of the wrath of the god whom my lord offends, who would slay the dragon of the deep, for through the dragon is the storm raised, and well it were if my lord offered a prayer.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest wisely,\" answered the Dainagon, and he fell to calling upon the god of seafolk, repenting him of his frowardness and folly who had sought to slay the Dragon, and vowing solemnly that never more would he strive to harm so much as a hair of the great ruler of the deep. A thousand times he repeated his prayer, neither standing nor sitting (but bowing him humbly before the god without ceasing). Then\u2014was it not in answer to his prayer?\u2014the thunder died down and the gloom lifted, but still the wind blew mightily. \"'Tis the Dragon's handiwork,\" said the helmsman after a while, \"a fair wind blows now, and drives the boat swiftly towards our own land.\" But the Dainagon could not understand him. For three or four days the bark sped before the wind till land came in sight, and they saw\nit was the strand of Akashi in Harima. Nevertheless the Dainagon would not be persuaded they had not been blown southwards on some savage shore, and lay motionless and panting in the bottom of the boat, nor would he rise, when the governor of the district, to whom his squires had sent tidings of their lord's misadventure, presented himself. But under the pine trees that overshadowed the beach mats were spread, whereupon the Dainagon saw it was on no savage shore they had drifted, and he roused himself and got on land. And when the governor saw him, he could not forbear smiling at the wretched appearance of the discomfited lord, chilled to the very bone, with swollen belly and eyes lustreless as sloes. But the proper orders were given, and a litter got ready in which the Dainagon was borne slowly to his mansion. Then those of his followers whom he had sent upon the Quest got wind somehow of their lord's return, and presented themselves humbly before him, saying: \"We have failed in our quest, and have lost all claim to an audience, but now 'tis known how terribly hard was the task imposed, and hither have we ventured to come, and we trust that a gracious forbearance will be extended and that we shall not be driven out of our lord's following.\"\n\nThe Dainagon went out to receive them and said: \"Ye have done well to return, even empty-handed. Yonder Dragon, assuredly, has kinship with the Thunder-God, and whoever shall lay hands on him to take the jewel that gleams in his head shall find himself in parlous peril. Myself am sore spent with toil and hardship, and no guerdon have I won. A thief of men's souls, and a destroyer of their bodies, is the Lady Kaguya, nor ever will I seek her abode again, nor ever bend ye your steps thitherwards.\"\n\nThen the Dainagon took what was left of his substance, and divided it among those whom he had bidden go in quest of the Jewel. And when his women, whom he had dismissed, heard of his misadventure, they laughed till their sides were sore, while the silken cloths he had caused to be drawn over the roof of his mansion were carried away, thread by thread, by the crows to line their nests with.\nAnd when men asked whether the Dainagon \u014ctomo had won the Dragon-Jewel, they were answered: \"Not so, but his eyeballs are become two jewels very like a pair of sloes,\\(^1\\) nor other jewels has he won.\" \"Ana! tayegata,\"\\(^2\\) was the reply, and thus the expression first arose.\n\n**The Royal Hunt.**\n\n*(Mi-kari no Miyuki.)*\n\nMeanwhile the fame of the incomparable loveliness of the Lady Kaguya had reached the Court, and the Mikado caused one of the palace dames, Fusago by name, to be summoned, and said to her: \"Of many a man has the strange beauty of this Kaguya been the ruin; go thou, therefore, and see what manner of damsel the girl be.\"\n\nThe Dame heard and departed, and came to the dwelling of the Bamboo-Hewer, where she was courteously received by the goodwife and invited to enter. \"'Tis at the bidding of His Majesty I have journeyed hither, who has heard that the beauty of the Lady Kaguya passes all description, and has commanded me to seek audience of her.\"\n\nSo spoke she and the goodwife answered, \"Your servant will humbly repeat your message,\" and sought the inner apartment, and prayed the maiden to receive the Palace Dame. But she would not, for that she was no wise beautiful, she said. Then the goodwife chided her for her churlish speech, and inquired how she dared treat thus rudely the King's message. But the Lady Kaguya still refused to receive the Dame, saying that His Majesty showed little wisdom in despatching one of his ladies upon such an errand. Nor might the Ancient nor his goodwife constrain her, for though she filled the place of a child born to them, ever she held herself aloof from the ways of the world. So the goodwife sought again the Palace Dame, and said, \"Pity 'tis, but of so tender years\n\n\\(^1\\) *Sumomo*.

The Dainagon had got his eyeballs swollen like sloes, and these were uneatable fruits, for his pains.\nis our daughter she may not venture to meet a Lady of the Court.\u201d But the Dame answered, not without some anger: \u201cThe Damsel may not be excused, for His Majesty has bidden me see her, and how can I return without fulfilling the Royal behest? Will she set at nought the commands of the Ruler of the Land, and so be guilty of an unexampled folly?\u201d\n\nStill the Lady Kaguya willed not to give audience to the Palace Dame, saying: \u201cI cannot yield obedience in this matter, if need be, let me be put to death.\u201d\n\nAnd the Dame thereupon returned to the Palace, and made report of what had occurred.\n\n\u201cVerily,\u201d said His Majesty, \u201cI can well believe \u2019tis a woman who revels in the destruction of men.\u201d So after a pause, thinking over the matter, the Mikado concluded that she must be constrained to yield due obedience, and caused the Ancient to be summoned to the Palace, to whom was conveyed this command. \u201cA daughter thou hast, Kaguya by name, whom we bid thee bring to us. Fair of face and form we have heard she is, and we sent one of our Ladies to see her, but she would not be seen. How comes it our will is thus disdainfully received in thy house?\u201d\n\nTo which the Ancient answered humbly: \u201cIt is true the child willed not to become a Lady of the Palace, and caused your servant sore grief, but he will hasten back to his dwelling and lay your Majesty\u2019s gracious commands upon her.\u201d To which was deigned the reply: \u201cHow! has not the Ancient reared the child, and may she oppose his will? Let the Maiden be brought hither, and a hat of nobility, perchance, shall be her father\u2019s reward.\u201d\n\nThe Ancient rejoiced greatly at hearing this, and returned to his dwelling, and conveyed the Royal command to the Lady Kaguya, bidding her no longer refuse obedience. But she said: \u201cNever will I serve His Majesty as \u2019tis desired; and if constraint be used towards your daughter, she will pine away and die, and the price of my father\u2019s hat of nobility will be the destruction of his child.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, die thou shalt not,\u201d cried the Ancient; \u201cwhat were\na hat of nobility to me if never again I beheld thee? Yet, daughter, I pray thee, tell thy father why thou refusest to become a Lady of the Palace and why shouldst thou die if thou shouldest serve his Majesty?\"\n\n\"Empty words seem thy daughter's,\" answered the Damsel, \"but true will they prove if she be constrained to do this thing. Many a suitor has wooed her, lords of no mean estate, who nevertheless have been dismissed, and should she listen to his Majesty, her name would become a reproach among men.\"\n\nThen the Ancient answered: \"Little care I for matters of state, but thy days must know no peril, nor shalt thou be in any wise constrained, and I will hasten to the palace and humbly represent to His Majesty that thou mayest not become an inmate thereof.\n\nThereupon he went up to the Capital, and represented that the Lady Kaguya, after hearing the Royal Command, nevertheless willed not to become a Lady of the Palace, and might not be constrained without peril of her life; and further, that she was not the born child of Miyakko Maro, but had been found by him one day when hewing bamboos on the hill-side, and that she was in ways and moods of other fashion than the fashion of this world. Upon this being reported to his Majesty, he said: \"Dwells not this Miyakko Maro among the hills hard by our capital? Let a Royal Hunt be ordered, and, perchance, thus we may gain a glimpse of the Maiden.\"\n\nThe Ancient, when the Royal pleasure was made known to him, said: \"'Tis an excellent device; thus may his Majesty, without difficulty, on the Hunt being unexpectedly ordered, gain a glimpse of the Lady Kaguya ere a thought of it enters her heart.\"\n\nSo a day was appointed, and the Royal Hunt ordered, and the Mikado watched for an opportunity and entered the Bamboo-Hewer's dwelling. And as the threshold was crossed, it was seen that the house was filled with light, and midmost the glory stood a Being. \"Ha! 'tis the Lady,\" cried the Mikado, and drew nigh, but she made to fly, and a\nroyal hand was laid upon her sleeve, and she covered her face, but not with such swiftness that a glimpse of it was not caught, and the loveliness of it was seen to be incomparable. And His Majesty would fain have led her forth, but she stood there and spoke these words: \"No liege of your Majesty is his servant, and she may not therefore be thus led away.\" But it was answered that she must not resist the Royal Will, and a palace litter approached, whereupon of a sudden the Lady dissolved in thin air and vanished. The monarch stood dumb with astonishment, and understood that the Lady was of no mortal mould, and said: \"It shall be as thou desirest, Maiden; but 'tis prayed that thou resume thy form, that once more thy beauty may be seen.\"\n\nSo she resumed her form and the glory of her loveliness filled the Royal heart with overwhelming delight; and graciously was the Ancient remembered, through whom this joy had come to His Majesty, and upon him was bestowed the rank of Chief of the Hiyak'kwan.\u00b9\n\nBut great was the grief that the Lady willed not to dwell in the Palace, and as the Monarch was about to be borne away, it seemed as if the Royal soul was being left behind, and a stanza was composed whereof the words were these:\n\nKayeru sa no miyuki mono uku omohoyete;\nsomukite tomaru Kaguya Hime yuye!\n\nAnd the Lady answered thuswise:\u2014\n\nMugura hafu shimo ni mo toshi wa t\u014drinuru mi no;\nnanika wa tama no utena wo mo mimu!\n\nMournful the return of the Royal Hunt,\nand full of sorrow the brooding heart;\nfor she resists and stays behind,\nthe Lady Kaguya!\n\nUnder the roof o'ergrown with hopbine\nlong were the years she passed,\nhow may she dare to look upon\nthe Palace of Precious Jade?\n\n\u00b9 Here Chief of the Mikado's Retinue:\u2014it was, however, merely an honorary, not a real appointment.\nWhen the answer was read, more than ever was the Monarch disinclined to go back bootless to the Palace, and long the litter was delayed, for no resolve could be come to, until it seemed at last as though the dawn would be there waited for through the night; whereupon reluctantly was the order given to return. But the Ladies of the Court were disdained, for their beauty paled before that of the Lady Kaguya, aye the fairest of them, when compared with her image, lost all her charms. Only on the Lady could the Royal heart dwell, and on none other, and the apartments of the Palace Dames were abandoned and desolate, sad to say! while letter after letter was sent to the Lady Kaguya, who answered them not ungently,\u00b9 and verses were composed and fairly writ on scrolls attached to posies, and interchanged, and thus the days passed by.\n\nThe Celestial Robe of Feathers.\u00b2\n\n(Ame no ha-goromo.)\n\nSo in the Palace and in the Hut was consolation attained; and three years went by, when, in the early spring, the Lady Kaguya fell to gazing upon the shining orb of the rising moon, and a brooding sadness seemed to take possession of her. She was counselled not thus ceaselessly to contemplate the face of the moon, for so was bred mournfulness; but she still in solitude watched the orb, until tears of grief ran down her cheeks in floods. Then, on the mid-month day of the seventh month rose the full moon, and unutterable grew the misery, and the maidens who served the Lady sought the Ancient and said: \"Long has the Lady Kaguya watched the moon, waxing in melancholy with the waxing thereof, and her woe now passes all measure, and sorely she weeps and wails; wherefore we counsel thee to speak with her.\"\n\n\u00b9 \"Go henji sasuga ni nikukarazu kikoyekawashitamaite.\"\n\u00b2 The fifth quest\u2014that of the Lord of Iso\u2014is omitted, principally on account of its triviality and lack of interest. A brief account of it will be found in the concluding portion of this article.\nAnd the Ancient went to her and said: \"What hast thou on thy mind, daughter, that ever thou gazest thus sadly on yonder moon's pallid face? Lackest thou aught that may be needed for thy happiness?\"\n\nBut she answered: \"As I gaze upon the moon I am sad because my heart is broken as I consider the wretchedness of this world.\"\n\nAnd deeper grew her melancholy each time the Ancient visited her chamber, till sorrow-struck by her distress, he said: \"Ah! my darling, my Buddha, why broodest thou thus? what grief oppresses thee?\"\n\n\"'Tis no grief, save the grief that breaks my heart because of the wretchedness of the world.\"\n\n\"Watch yonder moon no more, daughter; ever art thou gazing upon it, and thus thy woe deepens.\"\n\n\"How may I cease, father, to gaze upon the orb!\" said the Lady, and still she watched the moon from its rising to its setting, her face wet with tears the while; but when the nights were moonless, her woe departed from her. Yet as the new moon came and waxed again, the Lady wailed and wept, and her women whispered among themselves that ever deeper grew the misery; but they could not learn the secret of her woe, neither could the Ancient. So the eighth month came in due course, and when the moon was at its full the Lady wept floods of tears, nor essayed she to hide her grief. And again and again her foster-parents prayed her to tell them the cause of her wretchedness. The Lady yielded to their prayer, and said, weeping sorely the while: \"Again and again have I willed to tell you all, but I felt assured your hearts would be wrung with grief by my words, and therefore have I forborne till now; and now is the hour come I may no longer abide with you. No maid of this mortal land am I, but the Capital of Moonland is my birth-place. Long ago it was decreed that I should descend upon this earth, and bide there somewhile; but now is the time at hand when I must go back whence I came, for when yonder orb shall be\n\n1 After the 21st day of the month, explains the Commentary.\nat its fullest, a company of moonfolk will come down from the sky to bear me away. Well I knew this was my doom, and now ye can understand my misery and wherefore I have wept and wailed so sorely since the spring followed winter.\"\n\nAnd as the Lady spoke, again the tears flowed in abundance down her cheeks. But the Ancient said: \"What thing is this thou speakest, daughter? I found thee, 'tis true, in the hollow of a bamboo, but no bigger wert thou than a rape-seed, and have we not cherished thee while thou grewest up to full maidenhood? None dare take thee from us, by heaven! I will not let thee go.\"\n\nAnd he clamoured, amid his tears, that he was like to die; unbearably piteous 'twas to see his misery. But the Lady answered: \"My father and my mother are still numbered among the dwellers in yonder Moonland's capital. It was but for a while I came down to earth, and now many a year has gone by since you found me. So long have I dwelt among you that I have forgotten my father and my mother, and now I look upon you as though I were your very child; nor indeed would I fain do otherwise than remain with you, but, though terrible to me is the thought of quitting you, I may not flee my fate.\" And she fell to weeping, and the old folk wept also, and her women who had tended her through so many years and watched her grow up into perfect beauty, now hearing they must lose her whom they loved so well, could not swallow their tears, and, oppressed by a like woe, were consumed with grief.\n\nNow the Mikado, hearing of these things, sent a messenger to the Hewer's dwelling, and the Ancient came out to receive him, weeping abundantly. So bitter had been his grief that his hair had turned white, and his limbs become bowed, and his eyes blear, and though his years were but fifty,\\(^1\\) he seemed as if his woe had all at once turned him into an old man.\n\nThe messenger inquired if the tidings which had reached\n\n\\(^1\\) He has previously been described as a man of seventy. The Commentary treats the question with befitting gravity in a long note.\nHis Majesty as to the cause of the Hewer's distress were true, and the Ancient, still weeping, answered:\n\n\"At the full moon a company from the Moonland capital will come down to bear away our daughter. Deeply grateful am I to His Majesty, who deigns to make inquiry about this matter, and I humbly represent that if at the time of full moon a guard of soldiers be granted us, these Moonfolk, if they make their raid, may all be captured.\"\n\nThe messenger thereupon returned, and reported to the Mikado the plight wherein he found the Ancient.\n\nAnd the Mikado said: \"But a passing glimpse have I had of the Lady Kaguya, yet never shall I lose the memory of her exceeding loveliness; how hard then must it be for those who are wont to see her morning and evening to lose her!\" So orders were given that the captains should be ready by the full moon, and the General Taka no \u014ckuni was commanded to take a thousand men from each of the Left and Right Regiments of Royal Guards to protect the Hewer's dwelling against the raid of the Moonfolk. When the two thousand soldiers reached the Ancient's abode, one moiety was posted around it on the earth platform whereon it stood, and the other moiety on the roof of the house, all with bow bent and arrow on string, while the men of the household too were arrayed, and so many were the defenders that no spot remained unguarded, and even within the dwelling the women kept watch and ward, while the Lady was placed in the store-house, surrounded by her attendants, the door whereof the Ancient bolted, and posted himself outside thereof, saying: \"Watch and ward thus strict, even Heavenfolk may not win through,\" and crying to the soldiers on the roof to look out for the first sign of a swoop being made through the air, and slay whatever creature might in this way approach them, whereto they answered: \"Have no care, so keen our watch not even a bat shall escape our artillery, and due exposure of its head, by way of punishment, should it venture near our ranks.\"\n\nAnd the Ancient was greatly comforted by these words, but the Lady Kaguya said: \"Though ye thus surround me\nand protect me and make ye ready to fight for me, yet ye cannot prevail over the folk of yonder land, nor will your artillery harm them nor your defences avail aught against them, for every door will fly open at their approach, nor may your valour help, for be ye never so stout-hearted, when the Moonfolk come, vain will be your struggle with them.\"\n\nThen the Ancient was angered, and shouted: \"If these Moonfolk come, my nails shall turn into talons to claw out their eyes. I will seize them by their forelocks and twist them off, and trample upon them; their hinder-parts will I tear to pieces; to shame will I put them before the face of these Royal warmen.\"\n\nBut the Lady said: \"Make not so great a clamour, lest the warmen hear thee, which were unseemly. Ere long, alas! I shall no longer be within your love, ere long I must know the bitterness of parting, nor can I ever return to show my love and gratitude, for closed to me will be the world's ways. When I went out month after month to watch the waxing moon, I prayed for yet another year to bide with you; but the boon was refused me, and I could but wail and weep as ye saw me. I have beguiled your hearts to love me, and now must quit you; alas, alas! Of that pure essence are these Moonfolk that they know not old age nor ever suffer from any pain or grief, yet fain would I abide with my foster-parents; terrible it is to me to think that ye will grow old with no child to cherish you.\" So saying, the Lady wept sorely, but the Ancient, restraining his grief, said:\n\n\"Nay, daughter, thou must not anger beings so lovely as those thou speakest of.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the night wore away, and, at the hour of the Rat, behold! a glory fell about the dwelling that exceeded the splendour of noon and was ten times as bright as the brightness of the full moon, so that the smallest hair-pore could be seen on the skin. In the midst thereof came down through the air a company of angels riding on a coil of cloud that descended until it hovered some cubits' height above the ground. And there the angels stood ranked in due order; and when the warmen on guard saw them, a great fear fell\nupon them, upon those without as upon those within the dwelling, and they had no stomach for fighting. But after a while they rallied; and some bent the bow, but the strength departed from their arms, and they were as though stricken with palsy; and mightier men let fly anon, but the shafts went all astray, and these too could not fight, and thus feeble and bootless proved the vaunted watch and ward of the Royal Warmen.\n\nIn shining garments were the angels clad, that had not their like under heaven, and in the midst of them, as they stood in serried ranks upon the cloud, was seen a canopied car hung with curtains of finest woollen fabric, where sat One who seemed to be their lord. And the Archangel turned towards the Hewer's abode, and cried out in a loud voice, \"Come thou forth, Miyakko Maro.\" And the Hewer came forth, staggering like a drunken man, and fell on his face prostrate.\n\nThen the Archangel said, \"Thou fool! Some small virtue didst thou display in thy life, and to reward thee was this maiden sent to bide with thee somewhile, and years and years hath she dwelt under thy ward, and heaps and heaps of gold have been bestowed upon thee, and thou hast as it were become a new man. To expiate a fault she had committed was the Lady Kaguya doomed to bide a little while in thy wretched home, and now is the doom fulfilled, and we are come to bear her away from thine earth. Vain is thy weeping and lamentation, render up the girl and delay not.\"\n\nThen the Ancient answered humbly, \"For over a score of years thy servant has cherished the maiden, whereof his lord speaks strangely as being but a little while. Perchance the Lady whom his lord would bear away with him dwells elsewhere; the Lady Kaguya who bides beneath this roof is very sick and may not leave her chamber.\"\n\nNo answer was vouchsafed, but the Car was borne upwards on the cloud till it hovered over the houseroof and a voice cried, \"Ho there, Kaguya! how long wouldest thou tarry in this sorry place?\"\nThereupon the outer door of the storehouse, wherein stood the Lady Kaguya, flew open and the inner lattice-work, untouched by any hand, slid back and the Lady was seen in the light of the doorway, surrounded by her women, who, understanding that her departure could no longer be stayed, lifted up their hands and wept. But the Lady passed out, and drew nigh to where lay the Hewer, grovelling on the ground, weeping and stunned with grief, and said: \"My fate bids me, father; will you not follow me with your eyes as I am borne away?\"\n\nBut the Hewer answered: \"Why in my misery should I follow thee with my eyes? Let it be done unto me as may be listed, let me be left desolate, let these angels who have come down from the sky to fetch thee bear thee thither with them.\" And the Ancient refused to be comforted. Then the Lady indited a scroll, seeing that her foster-father was too overcome with grief to listen to her words, and left it to be given him after she had gone, weeping sorely and saying that when her father should yearn after his daughter, the words she had written should be read. And these were the words she wrote: \"Had I been born in this land, never should I have quitted it until the time came for my father to suffer no sorrow for his child;\u00b9 but now, on the contrary, must I pass beyond the boundaries of this world, though sorely against my will. My silken mantle I leave behind me as a memorial, and when the moon lights up the night, let my father gaze upon it; now my eyes must take their last look, and I must mount to yonder sky, whence I fain would fall meteor-wise to earth.\"\n\nNow the Angels brought with them a coffer, wherein were contained a Celestial Feather Robe and a joint of bamboo filled with the Elixir of Life, and one of them said to the Lady Kaguya: \"Taste, I pray you, of this Elixir, for soiled has your spirit become with the grossnesses of this filthy world.\"\n\n\u00b9 An euphemistic phrase hinting at her longing to remain with her father till death took him, and her fate could no longer grieve him.\nThen the Lady tasted of the Elixir, and would have privily wrapt up a portion in the mantle she was leaving behind, as a memorial of her; but an Angel stayed her, and drawing forth the Celestial Robe, made ready to throw it over her shoulders, whereupon she said: \"Have patience yet awhile; who dons yonder robe changes his heart, and I have still somewhat to say ere I depart.\" And again she fell to writing, and an Angel said: \"'Tis late, and you delay, Lady, overmuch.\" But she rebuked him, and before all, mournfully and composedly, she wrote on; and the words she wrote were these:\n\n\"Your Majesty deigned to send a host to protect your servant, but it was not to be, and now is the misery at hand of departing with those who have come to bear her away with them. Not permitted was it to her to serve your Majesty, and maugre her will was it that she yielded not obedience to the Royal Command, and wrung with grief is her heart thereat, and perchance your Majesty may have thought the Royal will was not understood, and was opposed by her, and so will she appear to your Majesty lacking in good manners, which she would not your Majesty deemed her to be, and therefore humbly she lays this writing at the Royal Feet. And now must she don the Feather Robe and mournfully bid her lord farewell.\" Then when she had finished writing the scroll, the captain of the host was called, and it was delivered over, together with the bamboo joint containing the Elixir, into his hands, and as he took it, the Feather Robe was thrown over the Lady Kaguya, and in a trice, all memory of her foster-father's woe vanished, for those who don yonder Robe know sorrow no more. Then the Lady entered the car, surrounded by the company of Angels, and mounted skywards, while the Hewer and his Dame and the women who had served the Lady shed tears of blood, and stood stunned with grief; but there was no help. And the scroll left for the Ancient was read to him, but he said:\n\n\"What have I to live for? a bitter old age is mine. Of what profit is my life? whom have I to love?\" Nor would\nhe take of the Elixir, but lay prostrate on the ground and would not rise.\n\nMeanwhile the Captain of the host returned to the capital with his men, and reported how vain had been the attempt to stay the departure of the Lady Kaguya, and all that had occurred, and gave the scroll, together with the bamboo joint containing the Elixir, to be laid before the Mikado. And His Majesty unrolled the scroll and read it, and was greatly moved, nor would take food nor any diversion. After a while a Grand Council was summoned, and it was inquired which among the mountains of the land towered highest towards heaven. And one said: \"In Suruga stands a mountain, not remote from the capital, that towers highest towards heaven among all the mountains of the land.\" Whereof His Majesty being informed composed a stanza:\n\nAu koto mo, Never more to see her!\nnamida ni ukabu Tears of grief overwhelm me,\nwaga mi ni wa; and as for me,\nshinanu kusuri wa with the Elixir of Life\nnani ni ka wa semu? what have I to do?\n\nAnd the scroll together with the Elixir was given into the hands of one of the ladies of the palace, and she was charged to deliver them to one Tsuki no Iwakasa, with the injunction to bear them to the summit of the highest mountain in Suruga, that there, standing on the top of the highest peak thereof, he should cause the scroll and the Elixir to be consumed with fire.\n\nSo Tsuki no Iwakasa heard humbly the Royal Command, and took with him a company of warriors, and climbed the mountain and did as he had been bidden. And it was from that time forth that the name of Fuji\\(^1\\) was given to yonder mountain, and men say that the smoke of that burning still curls from its high peak to mingle with the clouds of Heaven.\n\n\\(^1\\) One among the many ways of writing Fuji (Fusiyama) was \u4e0d\u6b7b, Immortal.\nJapanese literature begins with the *Kojiki*\\(^1\\) or Record of Ancient Matters, which appeared in A.D. 712. During the eighth and ninth centuries various works were produced, none of which, if we except the Anthologies, have any claim to admiration on literary grounds. But in the next century the Japanese mind seems to have taken a fresh flight, or rather to have awakened to a consciousness of its powers, and the remarkable series of *monogatari* or romances, of which the Tale of Taketori is at once the earliest example and the type, gave a lustre hitherto unknown to the literature of Japan.\n\nAmong these early romances, unsurpassed, probably unequalled, in literary quality, by the later fiction of Japan, the *Genji-monogatari*\\(^2\\) holds the chief place in the estimation of native critics, who scarcely condescend to notice the Hewer's simple and tender story. To European readers, however, the record of Genji's love-adventures soon becomes wearisome, despite the clever dialogues upon the virtues and failings of women regarded as ministers to men's sensuous or aesthetic pleasures that relieve the monotony of the narrative\u2014dialogues, by the way, that wear a strangely modern air, and might, with a few necessary changes, be transported bodily into a drawing-room novel of nineteenth-century London.\n\nIn the sense in which Shakespeare is said to have had little invention, the nameless author of the *Taketori* lacked originality. Most of the materials of his story are drawn from Chinese or Sinico-Indian sources. It could hardly\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This extraordinary farrago of feeble and often filthy myths and legends has had the good fortune to meet with so able a translator as Mr. B. H. Chamberlain. Trivial, even childish, as the collection is, it is interesting as furnishing striking instances of what myths in their crude beginnings really were. In addition, the traits of a fairly ample picture of the social life of the unsinicized Japanese may be gathered from it, and the songs it contains, though devoid of literary value, have considerable philological interest. Mr. Chamberlain has enriched his version with notes and commentaries that constitute an invaluable aid to the study of the origins of Dai Nippon.\n\n\\(^2\\) Many chapters of this history of a Japanese Don Juan have been recently translated by Mr. Suyematsu.\nhave been otherwise, for even as early as the tenth century the legends and traditions of his country had been either replaced by Chinese myths or recast in a Chinese mould, and, excepting in the Rituals of Shinto, and some of the songs quoted in the Kojiki or collected in the Anthologies, all vestiges of the unwritten literature of primitive Japan seem to have been lost. But the art and grace of the story of the Lady Kaguya are native, its unstrained pathos, its natural sweetness, are its own, and in simple charm and purity of thought and language it has no rival in the fiction either of the Middle Kingdom or of the Dragon-Fly Land.\n\nThe tags of word-plays that close the tale of each Quest are, I cannot but believe, the additions of later hands, and I am loth to look upon the story of the fifth Quest\\(^1\\) as other than the broad farce of some manipulator of a coarser period. Perhaps, indeed, the Moon-maiden's story stood originally alone, the work of some pious but not too orthodox Buddhist, who shaped a Taouist legend into an allegory exemplifying the great doctrine of inguwa, or Cause and Effect, in the maiden's recovery of her celestial home through subduance of the very feeling the indulgence of which had led her to exile, despite the circumstance that a Mikado sought to inspire, and a father to foster, the tender sentiment. In such a story the narratives of the Quests may have been afterwards interpolated, partly to display more fully the maiden's constancy and purity, partly by way of gentle\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Chiunagon Marotada has to present the Lady with a Cowry shell (Koyasugai) brought by a swallow, tsukakurame, probably the Hirundo gutturalis, Scop., which, according to Messrs. Blakiston and Pryer, nests always in a house, where a shelf is provided for its accommodation. He has recourse to his retainers, who devise various schemes, more or less trivial and ridiculous, in pursuance of one of which the Chiunagon endeavours to catch a swallow sitting upon its nest and in the act of wagging its tail. Thus far he is successful, but only to be rewarded by a ball of dung, which he grasps firmly in his hand, believing he has obtained the much-desired prize. In being lowered from his post of observation, to which he had been raised in a sort of basket attached by a rope, he meets with a mishap, and falls into a rice cauldron, from which his retainers drag him out still grasping his supposed prize\u2014the nature of which he then, to his stupefaction, discovers.\n\nThe Koyasugai is described in the Wakan sanzai as the shell currency of ancient China. The word is often written \u5b50\u5b89, under a false notion of its etymology\u2014probably Koyasu is a strengthened form of the root Koye, to bring over, import, etc.\nsatire upon the taste for love-adventures which all the early romances show to have characterized the peaceful age, when neither Hei nor Gen had yet raised the stormy din of factious arms.\n\nTo render literally an Oriental text involves the effacement of whatever charm the original may possess.\\(^1\\) I have therefore sought to give an English dress to the ideas, rather than to the mere language of the teller of this old-world story, probably the most ancient work of fiction extant of the whole Altaic race. But I have desired, at the same time, to preserve in the version as much as possible of the spirit, as distinct from the structure, of the unsinicized tongue of early Japan; and with this object have reproduced, to some extent, the loosely composite paragraph and sentence characteristic of Japanese prose, and abhorred of Chinese writers, who delight in a terse and antithetic, but bald and artificial style, that too commonly sacrifices wit to an obscure brevity, and loses all naturalness in the strain after mere symmetry of literary form. I have endeavoured, also, to retain the impersonality which so markedly differentiates Turanian\\(^2\\) from Aryan speech; but I have usually found this possible only so far as it resulted from avoidance of metaphorical forms of expression. Of the numerous word-plays that disfigure the text I have not attempted any explanation unless needed to give some definite meaning to the passages where they occur. The 'honorifics' in Japanese have often little more than a pronominal value, and I have not been careful to translate them when not used to emphasize respect. The word 'mi' is the honorific commonly employed in the text in relation to the Mikado, and is usually rendered\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) An Italian version of the *Taketori* has been made by M. Severini, which I cannot greatly praise. It has also been translated into German, and through German into English. Of these latter versions I have seen neither. The present is, I believe, the first direct translation into English that has been produced, and the only one based on Daishu's text, or annotated with any approach to adequacy.\n\n\\(^2\\) On this peculiar feature of Turanian languages the reader is referred to some excellent observations by Mr. Lowell in his *Chos\u00f6n or Land of Morning Calm* (Korea). Mr. Aston, too, has some admirable remarks on the subject in a paper on the Korean and Japanese languages, which will be found in Vol. XI. Part III. of this Journal.\n'imperial' or 'august,' expressions to which I have preferred the simpler 'royal.' In his preface Tanaka Daishu (the Sinico-Japanese pronunciation of the characters with which \u014chide is written) says that if you read the Taketori over lightly, it will seem quite easy to understand; but if you want to 'taste' it, you will find it no easy matter thoroughly to comprehend it, not only because the style is antique and concise, but because by dint of frequent copying the text is not unfrequently corrupt. I have experienced to the full the justice of these remarks, and am less certain now of the accuracy of many passages in my translation than I was at the beginning of my task; it was only after prolonged study of the text that I found I did not always fully 'taste' it.\n\nJapanese art has but rarely drawn its motives from the scenes of the Tale of Taketori. The earliest edition I have met with is illustrated with coarse woodcuts, but these are destitute of all merit. My friend M. Philippe Burty, however, possesses the concluding roll of an illuminated maki-mono, which he has kindly lent me, and the second of the three chromo-lithographs, with which I have been allowed to illustrate this translation\u2014the Upbearing of Kaguya\u2014is a reduced reproduction of its last scene. The two remaining chromo-lithographs are taken from makimonos in my own possession; the View of Fujisan from a roll bearing the title Sanka rekish\u014dzu, a Series of Pictures of Hills and Streams, and the other, which I have called The Oread's Haunt, from a roll that is partly calligraphic and partly a copy of a Chinese painting. The latter roll is contained in a case of black persimmon wood (Diospyros kaki), superscribed T\u014dgen senseki, \u6843\u6e90\u4ed9\u8e5f, and on the silk lining of its lid is a legend written in Chinese by the copyist, of which the subjoined version may be found interesting:\n\n\"Hath any mortal, pray you, ever trod the streamy domains where the Fairy's peach-tree blooms? Now the\n\n1 The Chinese Orend (\u4ed9), Si Wang Mu, the Western Royal Mother, who on Mount Kwenlun rules over thousands of Taoist genii. A peach-tree growing within her domain on the borders of the Gem Lake (\u7464\u6c60) bears fruits which confer immortality upon those who are allowed by the Mother to partake of them.\nsage T\u014drei (\u9676\u4ee4) beheld the wickedness of the world, and his heart was sore within him, and he fled from men, and made his abode among the Eastern wilds, and the gates of the Fairies' domain were opened to him, and in that mystic land untrodden by foot of man he gained the fruits of creative energy. To Meich\u014d (\u660e\u8d99), whose days were when the Ming ruled, came the fame of the adventure of T\u014drei, and he bethought him and wrought a picture, and depicted the high hills rising endlessly one above the other, and many a dizzy precipice, and the mulberry bush and the hemp plant, and fair to behold was the varied scene. There, too, were upland fields and valley rice-lands, and amidst them was seen the humble thatch of the husbandman. It was cunningly limned, one might liken it to fine needlework or the tracery of a patterned fabric. And in the course of time the scroll was brought within the borders of Kishiu, and my lord begged the loan of it, and at my lord's behest I made this copy of the picture. Though the scroll has been borne over the surging sea, amid roaring gales, over wild passes and streamy hills, and has been in peril from fire and struggle of armed men, and from tooth of rat and gnaw of worm, as from harm by spear or arrow, yet has no hurt come to it, for the gods and demons, I trow, have ever watched over its safety, during the many hundred years that have passed since it was wrought. Fair is the retreat among the wild hills, by the lintels of the door waves a willow, hard by the chrysanth blows, and a little beyond a pine-tree overshadows the meeting of three ways. Who shall now say that never have the gates of the Fairy Domain been thrown open to mortals? Written on a forenoon, in the second month of the second year of Ansei (A.D. 1855-6), at Sanke (?), within the province of Kishiu, by Kikuchi T\u014dsei.\"\n\nAs the legend of Mount H\u014drai (P'\u00eang lai) is, doubtless,\n\nKwenlun is by some identified with the range of mountains known as the Hindu Kush (see Mayers' Chinese Readers' Manual, p. 108), and the legend is evidently in great part of Indian origin.\n\n1 Not to be confounded with the Japanese Meich\u014d \u660e\u9577.\nintimately connected, in part at least, with that of Si Wang Mu, I have used a portion of Chao's picture, no adequate representation of the Island Mountain being known to me, as fairly conveying the Sinico-Japanese idea of the fabled Immortal Isle of the Eastern Ocean.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn the third volume of the *Gunsho ichiran* (a Japanese bibliography published about the year 1800), the early *monogatari*, among which the Hewer's tale holds the first place in merit as in time, are enumerated and briefly noticed, often with a good deal of learning and acumen. The account given of *Taketori* mentions as sources of some of the elements of the story the *Many\u014dshiu* and the *Kojiki,\\(^2\\) and among others the Naigeden (\u5185\u4f20), whence a curious Buddhist legend is cited to the following effect. Three recluses, after long-continued meditation, found themselves possessed of the truth, and so great was their joy that their hearts broke and they died. Their souls thereupon took the form of bamboos with leaves of gold and roots of precious jade, and after a period of ten months had elapsed, the stems of these bamboos split open and disclosed each a beauteous boy. The three youths sat on the ground under their bamboos, and after seven days' meditation they, too, became possessed of the truth, whereupon their bodies assumed a golden hue and displayed the marks of saintliness, while the bamboos disappeared and were replaced by seven magnificent temples. The legend is manifestly of Indian origin, and seems to have been first quoted by K\u016bkai or K\u014db\u014d Daishi from a sutra intituled H\u014drokaku (\u5b9d\u697c\u95a3). Of the authorship of the *Taketori* nothing certain is said to be known, but it is doubtfully ascribed to one Minamoto Jun, who is also believed by some to have had a hand in the composition of the *Utsubo monogatari,\\(^3\\) and the *Ochikubo monogatari*, both of which are\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Mayers, *op. cit.*, Nos. 559 and 647. Compare also the description of Amida's Paradise in Prof. Max M\u00fcller's translation of the text of the *Sukhavati* brought from Japan. Part II. Vol. XII. of this Journal.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kaguya, for instance, is the name of a princess who is mentioned in the history of the Mikado Suinin (B.C. 70\u2014A.D. 70), and one of her five lovers is, I believe, called Otomo no Miyuki (see the third Quest).\n\n\\(^3\\) An account of this work will, I believe, be found in the American Cyclopaedia, from the pen of Mr. Satow.\nnoticed in the Gunsho. The Sumiyoshi monogatari is a lengthy love-story, the plot turning mainly upon the craft and cruelty of a step-mother: it is considered one of the best of the series. An old writer, says the Gunsho, ascribes the authorship to the heroine of the tale, who is said to have written the whole story on a screen in a small room near the north-eastern gate of the Palace, which was a favourite rendezvous for lovers. More popular, perhaps, is another of the series, the Yamato monogatari, a collection of tales from which Mr. Chamberlain has taken his pretty story of the Maiden of Unai. It seems to have been, in part at all events, written by the Retired Mikado Kwanzan (A.D. 983-5), and the accepted editions contain nearly three hundred 'uta' or quintains. It is specially recommended, together with the Ise monogatari and the Genji monogatari to the attention of those who desire to become proficient in the art of composing 'uta' with elegance and rapidity, an art held in high honour at the court of the early Mikados. For an account of the Genji the reader is referred to Mr. Suyematsu's translation. The authoress, the Princess Murasaki Shikibu, was asked, says the Gunsho, to compose a story in a more modern style than that of the earlier romances such as the Taketori, and this she was able to do after passing a moonlit night in meditation and prayer. She repented towards the close of her life of the frivolities of her youth, and made with her own hands six hundred copies of the Hanniya Sutra in order to merit salvation. The Izumi Shikibu monogatari, which is next described, contains the lady's correspondence with her lover, the fourth son of the Mikado Reizei. Among the remaining monogatari a few only can be briefly mentioned here. The Ima monogatari is rather a series of poet-biographies than a romance, but it narrates, among other curious matters, a singular dream of one of its personages that Murasaki Shikibu may, after all, have gone down into Hell. The sixty volumes of the Ima mukashi monogatari (so called from its beginning with the time-honoured phrase ima mukashi 'once upon a time') describe the habits and customs of Japan\nand India, the wonders to be found in both countries, the examples and effects of good and bad conduct they afford, and the traditions concerning the Buddha current in them.\n\nThe *Akinoyonaga no monogatari* (A Long Autumn-night's Story) is of later date. It narrates the unlawful loves of the priest Keikai, who lived in the reign of Horikawa II. (A.D. 1222\u201334), and is characterized as extremely pathetic and interesting. The priest finally repented of his evil ways and founded the temple of Unky\u014d. The *Matsuho monogatari* is similar to the last in style and matter. The *Omina meshi monogatari*, or 'Girls' Stories,' is a series of narratives of celebrated women, containing many wise saws and exemplary instances of successful diligence. Of the remainder of the nineteen *monogatari* enumerated, some are collections of essays rather than stories, and are evidently compilations. Indeed, in the Hewer's tale we have the only pure fiction of the whole series\u2014at least the story of the Lady Kaguya may justly be so regarded\u2014absolutely free from every trace of grossness, which is more than can be said of the *monogatari* which succeeded it. The word-plays it contains are its only blemishes, and these are far less common than in the later romances, where almost every page bristles with them. Even the narrative of the fifth Quest is rather vulgar and trivial than coarse in matter or manner, and in the imaginative literature of Japan which it ushered into being, the *Taketori monogatari* remains to the present day unsurpassed, nay unequalled, in purity, simplicity, pathos, and unstrained quality of style.\n\nThree editions of the *Taketori* are known to me. One in two volumes has been already mentioned. Another, also in two volumes, published in the period Temmei 1781\u20139, is enriched with interpretative notes, by Koyama Tadashi. But the edition I have used is the work of Tanaka Daishu, a native of the province of Owari, which appeared in the year 1829. It is in six volumes, the first being an introductory essay upon the story and its sources, the remaining five volumes containing the text, distributed in short portions, each followed\nby a commentary, in which obsolete expressions and customs are explained, and various readings are presented and discussed, often at great length, and always with considerable learning and critical power. I have subjoined Daishu's text romanized in accordance with the system adopted by the R\u014dmaji-kai (Society for the Romanization of Japanese\u2014a reform I was the first to advocate some twenty years ago). It does not appear that the Taketori was printed before the middle of the last century, and the text has doubtless suffered considerably at the hands of the MS. copyists, whose labours have handed it down during a period of eight hundred years.\n\nThe language of the text, the oldest prose of the Altaic races,\u00b9 is almost wholly archaic Japanese (Yamato kotoba); but a few Chinese expressions occur in it. Originally it was probably written, like the Many\u014dshiu, partly in syllabic partly in Chinese, character, and the rendering of the latter into Yamato kotoba has, doubtless, not been accurately preserved in all cases. It is worthy of notice, as showing the extent to which Japan merged whatever indigenous civilization she possessed in the imported civilization of China, that the Taketori hardly contains a single reference to Shint\u014d or to any primitive tradition or myth. So at the present day we see modern Japan, discarding Chinese modes of life and thought, engaged in a strenuous endeavour, despite her geographical remoteness, to gain a place in the great family of Western nations.\n\nIt had been my intention to extend these somewhat superficial notes so as to include some criticism of the text and an adequate examination of the Chinese and Sinico-Indian sources whence the author of the Taketori drew most of his materials. But I found my own library quite insufficient for the purpose, and with regard to researches of the kind I had in view, the doors of the great library in Bloomsbury are practically closed to those who do not command a much more abundant leisure than I am ever likely to enjoy.\n\n\u00b9 The Kojiki, Nihongi, etc. are written in a style which is a bad imitation of Chinese.\nTHE TEXT.\n\nKAGUYA HIME NO OI-TACHI.\n\nIma wa mukashi Taketori no okina to iyeru mono aikeri.

II.\u2014An Essay on the Br\u0101h\u016bi Grammar, after the German of the late Dr. Trumpp, of Munich University.\n\nBy Dr. Theodore Duka, M.R.A.S., Surgeon-Major Bengal Army.\n\nIn the range of philological study and research there is nothing so attractive as the discovery of certain tribes who speak a language unconnected with the languages of the peoples which surround them. In Europe we have the striking example of the Basque language on the French and Spanish frontier, and, on a larger scale, we find the descendants of the ancient conquerors of the upper part of Pannonia\u2014the Hungarians\u2014surrounded by German, Slav and Latin elements, speaking the Magyar language, a language wholly isolated, whose philological position has not as yet been determined to the satisfaction of all. Such isolated peoples appear like islets on the vast ocean of Languages. Another remarkable example is the language of the Br\u0101h\u016bi in the north of Sindh and on the east of Baluchistan, on the north-west of British India, which is the subject of the present essay. This language is spoken in a region to which much attention has been attracted of late; it is the territory formerly known as the Kh\u00e1nat of Khelat. The writing of the Br\u0101h\u016bi is the Arabic alphabet, and the letters l and t are pronounced from the roof of the mouth with a strong emission of the breath.\n\nThe first notice of this language was given by the late Major Leech, of the Bombay Army, who, in 1838, presented a short sketch of it, with a list of words and sentences, adding a few fables, published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1839.\n\nProfessor Christian Lassen, of Bonn, has critically analyzed Major Leech\u2019s work in the fifth volume of the \u201cZeitschrift f\u00fcr\ndie Kunde des Morgenlandes.\u201d After careful examination, he came to the conclusion that the language of the Brah\u00fa\u00ed people belongs to the Dravidian family; but the material at Lassen\u2019s disposal was so scanty and so incorrect, being, moreover, overladen by typographical errors, that he could not venture beyond certain general conclusions on the subject. The structure of the speech had to be guessed at rather than fixed with any certainty, in consequence of which suspicion arose that the Brah\u00fa\u00ed had been wrongly classified as an idiom connected with the southern Dravidian languages.\n\nThe monograph of the Italian philologist, Felice Finzi, scarcely deserves serious consideration\u2014he merely copied Leech. His comparisons are far too superficial to be of any value, and his own additions are mostly erroneous.\n\nIn 1874 Dr. Bellew published a work entitled \u201cFrom the Indus to the Tigris\u201d (Tr\u00fcbner and Co.), to which, by way of appendix, he added a short grammar and vocabulary of the Brah\u00fa\u00ed language. Bellew accompanied Sir Richard Pollock\u2019s mission, traversed that very region which is the home of the Brah\u00fa\u00ed, and being an industrious observer, he availed himself of his opportunities, and, in the capacity of a medical man, often came in contact with the people; great credit is due to him for having bestowed so much attention on the subject of language, and for having made careful notes of his enquiries. Welcome as this addition to our knowledge was, no important advance was made by it. Bellew did not fully grasp the subject, and, not being previously acquainted with the language, he stated much that was erroneous: he even repeated the mistakes into which Leech fell. In 1877 there appeared at Karachi a \u201cHandbook of the Birouhi Language, by Alla Bux,\u201d a native of India. His grammar covers barely thirty-nine pages, but it is a considerable stride in the right direction, since the grammatical rules were worked out with the assistance of some of the native Brah\u00fa\u00ed, who frequently visit Karachi in large numbers. This essay is merely a compendium of elementary grammatical forms;\n\n1 Bolletino della Societ\u00e0 Geografica Italiana, June, 1850.\n2 The author, \u0628\u062e\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, thus anglicizes his name, which we have retained.\nin many points it is deficient; but in addition to a very valuable list of the most important irregular verbs, the correctness of which has been since verified, we find sixty-three pages of Brah\u00fai text, with an English translation, and the next twenty-two pages contain Brah\u00fai fables with translation into English. From a thorough study of this material, the grammar is capable of being considerably amplified. Dr. Trumpp,\\(^1\\) an Agent of the Church Missionary Society, who was for some years in Sindh, compiled a Brah\u00fai grammar and presented his important work to the Academy of Sciences of Munich on the 4th December, 1880. The following pages are intended to be an adaptation of his work for English students. Trumpp makes frequent use of Alla Bux\u2019s colloquial sentences and stories, since, notwithstanding numerous misprints, what the Maulawi says can be thoroughly depended on.\n\nLeech states that the Persian alphabet had already been adopted for the Brah\u00fai, but it is the Maulawi\u2019s merit of having (in a linguistic treatise) for the first time made use of it. In this manner we are better enabled to judge of the language, and also to facilitate the learning of it to the Brah\u00fai themselves. The Hindust\u00e1ni development of the Arabic alphabet is peculiarly suited to it, as it is capable of noting all the cerebrals. Moreover, as the Brah\u00fai are followers of Muhammad, nothing better could be offered for their acceptance. Some vowel-sounds, however, cannot be indicated with complete precision.\n\nIn the same year and place as the Maulawi, Capt. Nicolson published a Brah\u00fai reader, under the title of \u201cMeanee,\u201d etc., being a compilation of extracts from Napier\u2019s Conquest of Sindh and Grant Duff\u2019s Mahratta History, etc., translated into English. The title of this book scarcely corresponds with its contents, as the extracts just mentioned are very short and very few: the work was compiled with the aid of some Brah\u00fai Sepoys, the translation being from English into the vernacular. Capt. Nicolson tells us that the first translation was submitted to a committee of native Brah\u00fai, and\n\n\\(^1\\) The Reverend Dr. Ernest Trumpp, late Professor of Oriental Languages at Munich, died in 1884. He was the author of Sindhi and Pasht\u00fa Grammars, and translator of the Adi Gran\u1e6dh.\nthat passages which they could not make out were altered, until the Hindust\u00e1ni translation made by the committee was made to correspond with the English text. The merit of these Brah\u00fai texts, therefore, is that we can with certainty rely upon idiomatic Brah\u00fai expressions. Unfortunately, we have here only the text, without any vocabulary: the learner, therefore, is obliged to get through his task the best way he can.\n\nThe first desideratum now is a dictionary, for which Mr. Masson, the celebrated traveller's, collection of words could very well be utilized. Until a lexicon is obtained, no further progress can naturally be hoped for.\n\nUpon the material mentioned above, and especially on the Brah\u00fai texts of Alla Bux and of Capt. Nicolson, all of which have been carefully examined and collected, Dr. Trumpp compiled his grammar, regarding which he says: \"I hope that, by comparing this language with the Dravidian idioms on one hand, and on the other with its neighbours the Baluchi and the Sindhi languages, I may have succeeded in establishing the grammatical structure of the Brah\u00fai language, as well as its position in Philology. With the scanty material at my disposal, I cannot claim for my investigations anything like completeness; they are intended rather as a guide to others who may have the opportunity and advantage of prosecuting the study of the Brah\u00fai, in the country of that people.\"\n\nDr. Trumpp is fully convinced that the Brah\u00fai is a language belonging to the Dravidian family. At first he was inclined to class it with the Kolarian group, but further investigations convinced him that this would be an error, especially as the Brah\u00fai knows nothing of the formation of a dual, which is a prominent characteristic of the Kolarian class of languages.\n\nWe must admit, nevertheless, that the Brah\u00fai differs in certain points from the South Dravidian dialects, but that is hardly to be wondered at, considering the gap of a thousand years by which it is separated from them. It is, on the contrary, very notable that, notwithstanding its complete separation from its sister-dialects, and absolutely without any literature, the Brah\u00fai should have possessed sufficient vitality\nto maintain its linguistic type. As to its neighbours, only the Bal\u00fachi language seems to have exerted recently some influence upon its grammatical forms; but even this apparent influence may admit of further explanation.\n\nFrom the J\u00e1t dialect of the Sindhi language on the east the Brah\u00fai has certainly borrowed many words, but its grammatical structure is in no way affected by it.\n\nOf the ancient history of this neglected and cast-away people hardly anything is known. So much, however, may be inferred, that the Brah\u00fai were probably driven away from their ancient abode on the Lower Indus, towards the inhospitable and inclement mountainous regions of Middle Bal\u00fachistan, where they hold their own to this day against the encroachments of the Bal\u00fachi from the west. The Bal\u00fachi are a nomadic tribe. Notwithstanding the high altitude of their domicile and the cold climate in which they live, the Brah\u00fai have retained a dark complexion, which distinguishes them at once from their immediate neighbours, the J\u00e1t and the Bal\u00fachi. It is true, however, that the Brah\u00fai do not intermarry with other tribes. Many of them live in Sindh, and all retain the distinguishing peculiarities of their race, namely, the olive-coloured skin, a feeble, middle-sized frame, and a dark, thin beard. Their features have nothing of the Mongolian type; on the contrary, they resemble entirely the Caucasian race. The habits of the Brah\u00fai are favourably described not only by Pottinger, but by all the more recent travellers; they bear a favourable comparison with their robber-neighbours the Bal\u00fachi. They lead a pastoral life, living on the produce of their herds, and are generally inoffensive, sociable, and given to hospitality. Bellew mentions a laudable instance of gratitude of a wounded Brah\u00fai horseman.\n\nThey are divided into several tribes, owing chiefly to the difficulty of access to their mountain-homes: these, as a rule, they abandon in the winter for a warmer climate in the plains. There they live in Tumans, or tent-villages, in the Provinces of Sarawan and Jalawan, penetrating as far as K\u00fach in Makran, on the south-west. They avoid the heat in the plains, where the Bal\u00fachi reside.\nThe Brah\u00fai consider themselves as the original inhabitants of the country, and probably they are. But, judging from appearances, the Persians from Seistan seem to have preceded them and taken possession of the fertile tracts of Bal\u00fachistan, because we find today the middle and westerly parts of the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1t of Kelat occupied by an agricultural tribe, the T\u00e1jik, whose mother-tongue is Persian. In the south-east, the province of Las, and the plains extending towards the Indus, and almost the whole province of K\u00fach Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, is the home of the J\u00e1t, who speak a dialect of the Sindhi language. The Bal\u00fachi, coming from the south-west, were the last settlers. Being unable to dislodge the Brah\u00fai from their mountain slopes, they migrated towards the north-east, and possessed themselves of the tract between Sindh and K\u00fach Gand\u00e1v\u00e1. Thence they pressed into Sindh, under the leadership of the Talpur, and took possession of the most fertile tracts of land.\n\nThe first historical record of the Brah\u00fai we find mentioned at the end of the seventeenth century, when Kambar, the head of the Mirv\u00e1ri tribe, drove away the sovereign of Kelat and took possession of his throne. Ever since, this Brah\u00fai dynasty has reigned in Kelat; the different nationalities, having embraced Islam, formed themselves under it for political reasons into one homogeneous state, although powerful clansmen even yet occasionally disturb the sway of the Khan. It is remarkable, however, that although the sovereign power is now in the hands of a Brah\u00fai dynasty, the language of the Court is Bal\u00fachi, or Persian, the Brah\u00fai language being considered as not sufficiently refined for Government purposes.\n\nThe national name, Br\u00e1h\u00fa\u00ed, is pronounced in several ways. Nicolson and Maulawi Alla Bux spell it Biruhi (that is, Biroohi or Birouhi); but we must not forget that Bir\u00fahi (\u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u200c\u0648\u06cc) is a Sindhi word, and it is therefore difficult to say how the people in question call themselves. In Nicolson's Reader the word occurs twice written \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u200c\u0648\u06cc, which cannot be pronounced otherwise than Br\u00e1h\u00fa\u00ed or Bir\u0101h\u00fa\u00ed, and this should, therefore, be adopted as the proper pronunciation of the word.\nWe find also the name Kurdgali given to the language, meaning the speech of the Kurds, evidently from the fact that the Kurds are a tribe of the Brah\u00fai people, having many subdivisions on the northern parts of the Kh\u00e1nat, as far as the Dasht-i-bi-daulat, \"the luckless desert.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the many subdivisions into numerous tribes and subtribes, and the general ignorance of the people, their language has nevertheless, as Dr. Trumpp pointedly declares, proved itself to be the intellectual power which kept up the bond and consciousness of national unity among them to this day. In the absence of all historical records and tradition, the language remains the only means which enables us to assign to the Brah\u00fai people its due place in the great family of nations.\n\n\u00a7 1. The System of Sounds (the Alphabet).\n\nThe vowels in Brah\u00fai are the following:\n\nsimple: \\(a\\), \\(\\bar{a}\\); \\(e\\), \\(\\bar{e}\\); \\(i\\), \\(\\bar{i}\\); \\(o\\), \\(\\bar{o}\\); \\(u\\), \\(\\bar{u}\\).\n\ncompound: \\(ai\\), \\(au\\).\n\nThe sound of \\(e\\) frequently occurs at the end of a word, and is marked by hamza \\(^\\circ\\), sometimes by the letter \\(\u0649\\), but it is always short; \\(o\\) has often the sound of \\(u\\). Compound vowels, or diphthongs, occur chiefly in foreign words. To facilitate the exact pronunciation of the long \\(e\\) and \\(o\\), Trumpp recommends the signs \\(\u0649\\) and \\(\u0648\\) for the use of Europeans.\n\nThe consonants are as follows:\n\nGutturals: \\(\u0643 k\\), \\(\u062e kh\\), \\(\u063a g\\), \\(\u062e gh\\), \\(\u062d kh\\), \\(\u063a y\\).\n\nPalatals: \\(\u062c jh\\), \\(\u0686 chh\\), \\(\u0686 jh\\), \\(\u0686 jh\\).\n\nCerebrals: \\(\u062a t\\), \\(\u062b th\\), \\(\u062f d\\), \\(\u0630 dh\\), \\(\u0631 r\\).\n\nDentals: \\(\u062a t\\), \\(\u062b tha\\), \\(\u062f d\\), \\(\u0630 dh\\).\n\nLabials: \\(\u0628 p\\), \\(\u067e ph\\), \\(\u0628 b\\), \\(\u067e bh\\), \\(\u0641 f\\).\n\nSibilants: \\(\u0633 s\\), \\(\u0634 sh\\), \\(\u0635 z\\).\n\nNasals: \\(\u0645 m\\), \\(\u0646 n\\).\n\nDemivowels: \\(\u064a y\\), \\(\u0631 r\\), \\(\u0644 l\\), \\(\u0648 w\\).\n\nAspirate: \\(\u0647 h\\).\n\n1 The use of the Greek letter is Dr. Trumpp's.\nTo these should be added the special Arabic sounds which, however, occur only in foreign words; they are pronounced \\( \\text{\u062b} = s; \\text{\u062d} = h; \\text{\u062e} = z; \\text{\u0631} = zh; \\text{\u0633} = s; \\text{\u0634} = s; \\text{\u0637} = t; \\text{\u0638} = z; \\text{\u0642} = q; \\text{\u063a} = ghain; \\text{\u062e} = ghain \\) already mentioned.\n\nFrom the above we notice that the Brahui possesses cerebral sounds, but among them there is no cerebral \\( r \\): the \\( r \\) is a modification of the sound \\( d \\), as in Sindhi and Hindi, and the two are often substituted one for another.\n\nA striking peculiarity in the Brahui is this, that through all the Vargas the aspirates are identical with those used in the Indo-Arian languages, and the Brahui would therefore seem to be intimately connected with them; whilst, on the contrary, the Dravidian languages of the South, according to their fundamental type, are, as a rule, wanting in such aspirates. Many words, however, are reducible to a Sindhi origin, such as \\( \\text{\u0686\u06be\u0646\u062f\u0646\u06af} \\) 'to shake,' Sindhi \\( \\text{\u0686\u06be\u0646\u062f\u0646\u06af} \\); \\( \\text{\u062f\u06be\u06af\u06cc} \\) 'a cow,' Sindhi \\( \\text{\u062f\u06be\u06af\u06cc} \\), etc. Nevertheless, the use of aspirates seems not to be opposed to the spirit of the Brahui language itself. In words of Persian, Arabic, or Hindi origin, the aspirate occurs as a matter of course; like \\( \\text{\u0686\u06be\u0648\u06a9\u0631\u06cc} \\) 'a girl'; \\( \\text{\u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc} \\) 'a room,' etc. Such undoubted Brahui words as \\( \\text{\u067e\u06be\u062f\u06cc\u0646} \\) 'cold,' \\( \\text{\u067e\u06be\u062f\u06cc} \\) 'coldness,' possess aspirates, and may therefore be taken as a proof of the fact.\n\nThe sound \\( \\text{\u062e} \\) although foreign to Dravidian tongues, occurs in true Brahui words, and may be considered as a softened \\( k \\). For instance, \\( \\text{\u062e\u0644} \\) 'stone,' in Tamil \\( \\text{kal} \\); Brahui \\( \\text{\u062e\u0627\u0646} \\) 'eye,' in Tamil \\( \\text{kan} \\). It also occurs in many Brahui verbs, as \\( \\text{\u062e\u0627\u0686\u0646\u06af} \\) 'to lie down,' \\( \\text{\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0646\u06af} \\) 'to strike.'\n\nThe sound \\( \\text{\u063a} \\) (ghain) also occurs in pure Brahui words, e.g. \\( \\text{\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u063a} \\) 'the pupil (eye),' \\( \\text{\u06c1\u0648\u0631\u063a} \\) 'thunder,' \\( \\text{\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u063a} \\) 'bread.' The \\( \\text{\u063a} \\) is also used, as in Persian, to fill the hiatus between two vowel-sounds, but especially in the declensions, e.g. \\( \\text{\u0633\u06cc\u0645} \\) 'sword,' \\( \\text{\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u0631} \\) 'land.'\n\nThe palatal sounds are fully represented, and are pronounced in\nthe usual way. Lassen thought that \\( jh \\) was absent, such, however, is not the case, e.g. \u062c\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064f \\( jh\u0101mar \\) 'the cloud.'\n\nThe cerebral \\( j \\) is one of the accepted sounds: for instance, \u0627\u0650\u06cc\u0650\u0631\u064f \\( \u012br \\) 'sister,' \u06a9\u0650\u06cc\u0631\u064f \\( gir\u0101 \\) 'a thing.'\n\nThe labial \\( f \\) is peculiar to the language, whilst it is unknown to the Dravidian group in general. For instance, \u0647\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0646\u06af\u064f \\( harafng \\) 'to ask,' \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0646\u06af\u064f \\( tafng \\) 'to bind.' We shall further see that the formation of the causal verb is effected by the addition of \\( f \\) to the root; in the negative form, however, the \\( f \\) changes with \\( b \\), in accordance to certain rules. The \\( f \\) occurring in Brahui words is sometimes changed into \\( b \\), as \u067e\u0650\u0644\u067e\u0650\u0644\u064f \\( pilpil \\) for \u0641\u064e\u0644\u0641\u0644\u064f 'pepper.'\n\nAmong the sibilants, the sound expressed by \\( jz \\) is of especial interest, because it occurs not merely in words borrowed from other sources, but we find it in those of undoubted Brahui origin: for instance, \u0628\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064f \\( bh\u0101z \\) 'much,' \u0632\u0650\u0644\u064f \\( zil \\) 'finger-nail.'\n\nAs to the nasal sounds, the Brahui does not possess the Anusv\u0101ra, and, therefore, these sounds should always be fully pronounced, even when in combination with a consonant. For instance, in the terminal syllable of the infinitive \\( ing \\) the \\( g \\) is fully sounded.\n\nOf the demi-vowels, the \\( r \\) often drops, as we shall notice in the conjugations. In some instances the \\( r \\) changes into \\( s \\), as, for example, \u0627\u0650\u0633\u064f \\( ase \\) for \u0627\u0650\u0631\u064f \\( \u0101ri \\) = 'he is.' So, likewise, the Brahui uses sometimes the sound \\( s \\), when in other Dravidian idioms the sound \\( r \\) prevails.\n\nThe aspirate \\( s \\) is soft; therefore we find indifferently written \u0627\u0650\u0646\u062a\u064f \\( ant \\), and \u0647\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064f \\( hant \\) = 'what?' \u0627\u0650\u0645\u064f \\( am \\), and \u0647\u064e\u0645\u064f \\( ham \\) = 'also.'\n\nDr. Trumpp proposes that when the Hindustani alphabet is used, the sound of the short final \\( a \\), in the nouns, should be expressed by \\( s \\), as in Persian, with the view of avoiding mistakes in reading, and also because the Persian words ending in \\( s \\) have almost the same inflection as in the Brahui. In order to recognize the final \\( a \\) in the present definite tense, he proposes to discard the long alif (\\( l \\)) and mark it likewise with \\( s \\), particularly as the accent does not rest on it; by this practice much confusion would be avoided.\nCompounding of consonants is rare in the Brahui: if it does occur, it is seldom that there are more than two consonants in apposition. Reduplication of consonantal sounds is common enough, as, for instance, \u067e\u06cc\u0646\u06cc pinni 'the thigh,' \u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0647 lumma\u1e25 'mother,' \u062e\u0644\u06cc khalli 'a jug.'\n\n\u00a7 2. The Noun, its Gender and Number.\n\nThe Brahui, like the whole Dravidian group, makes no distinction of gender in the nouns. Where it is necessary to distinguish sexes, the words \u0646\u0631 'male,' \u0645\u0627\u062f\u06c1 madah 'female,' are used. Example: \u0646\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0634 'male donkey,' \u0645\u0627\u062f\u06c1 \u0628\u06cc\u0634 'female donkey.' The same rule exists in the Malayalam and in the New Persian.\n\nThe Brahui has two numbers, the singular and the plural; the Kolarian group of languages possesses a dual as well.\n\nThe plural number is formed by an affix, hence, strictly speaking, there is only one type of the plural. But observe that:\n\n1. Nouns ending in a consonant add the affix \u0101k to the root; for instance, \u0628\u0627\u0645\u0633 b\u0101mas 'nose,' pl. \u0628\u0627\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062a b\u0101mas-\u0101k; \u0628\u0646\u062e banday 'man,' \u0628\u0646\u062e\u0627\u062a banday-\u0101k 'men.' The exceptions to this rule are:\n   a. Nouns ending in \u0646, where the preceding vowel is short, the letter k alone assists in forming the plural, for instance, \u062e\u0627\u0646 khan 'eye,' pl. \u062e\u0627\u0646\u06a9 khan-k 'eyes'; \u067e\u06cc\u0646 pin 'name,' pl. \u067e\u06cc\u0646\u06a9 pin-k 'names.'\n   b. Nouns ending in \u062a or \u0631, drop their final-consonant for the sake of euphony, and simply substitute the plural k for it, as \u0646\u0627\u062a nat 'foot,' pl. \u0646\u06a9 feet;' but the difference, with respect to a long penultimate vowel followed by r, is this, that the r falls off, for instance, \u0645\u0627\u0631 m\u0101r 'son,' pl. \u0645\u06a9 m\u0101k 'sons.'\n\n2. Nouns ending with the aspirate take, for the sake of euphony, the sound \u063a before the plural termination, for instance, \u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0647 lumma\u1e25 'mother,' \u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0627\u062a lumma-\u03b3-\u0101k 'mothers.' The aspirate of the singular may be disregarded and dropped, as it stands there merely as a diacritical sign.\n\n3. Nouns ending in a long vowel form the plural by the simple addition of k, as \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0627 d\u0101na 'a wise man,' pl. \u062f\u0627\u0646\u06a9 d\u0101na-k\n'wise men'; \u0648\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0648\u064f\u062f\u0652 'hand,' pl. \u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062f\u0652 'hands.' But nouns ending in a long i may form their plural in iy-ak.\n\nIt often happens that the plural affix is not used at all, its presence can be guessed at from the context. But when a collective noun is the subject of a verb, then the verb must stand in the plural number, for instance, \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u0648\u0631 'his soldiers will cook one thousand fowls;' here the plural future \u0628\u0633\u0648\u0631 basor indicates that the word \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0647\u06cc sepahy requires the plural number. But it is incorrect to say, as Leech teaches, that in similar cases the word \u0628\u0627 b\u0101z 'much' is used to indicate the plural. The word b\u0101z always retains its own meaning, and is not used as an expletive. Caldwell's observation, therefore, that the number of the nouns in Brah\u00fai remains as a rule undefined, is applicable to very few instances. Caldwell repeats Leech's remark as to the use of the words 'much' and 'some,' which Trumpp declares to be incorrect.\n\nThat the plural suffix ak and k is of Dravidian origin may be assumed with certainty.\n\nThis plural sound k occurs in what were called the Northern Turanian languages; in Hungarian we have, for instance, h\u00e1s 'a house,' pl. h\u00e1s-ak; there are even traces in the Turkish of the plural k, as, for instance, \u0627\u06cc\u062f\u06a9 id-ik 'we were.'\n\n\u00a7 3. The Declension.\n\nDeclension, properly so called, is unknown in the Brah\u00fai, as in what Trumpp calls the Dravido-Turanian group of languages; the cases are determined by affixes, which, with slight modifications, are the same in both the numbers.\n\nThe root of the noun always stands in the nominative, but an interesting point occurs when we closely consider the formation of the Brah\u00fai singular and plural.\n\nThe Dravidian languages, in a large number of nouns, add their case-affixes not to the root, but to what is called the formative, and we know such to be the case in languages of Northern India also; this phenomenon, Trumpp tells us, is entirely absent\nin the Turanian. In this peculiarity the Brahui approaches, in a striking manner, the Dravidian idioms, a circumstance which has been overlooked hitherto. The cases of the singular number are formed merely by the addition of the affixes, but in the plural we notice vestiges of the formative, as we shall presently see.\n\nThe affixes of the singular number are these:\n\n| Case          | Affix |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Nominative    |       |\n| Genitive      | nd\u0101   |\n| Dative        | \u0113     |\n| Accusative    | \u0113     |\n| Instrumental  | \u0101t    |\n| Conjunctive   | t\u014d, at\u014d |\n| Ablative      | \u0101n    |\n| Locative      | \u0101e and ti |\n\nWhen the nominative ends in a consonant, or in a long vowel, or the short vowel s ah, the affixes are simply added; not unfrequently we find the letter \u0113 inserted between the final letter and the affix. Supposing the affix commences with a vowel, in such a case the final mute s ah is dropped; example, Dat. Acc. zaifa or \u0636\u0639\u064a\u0641\u064a z\u0101ifa-\u03b3-e \u2018to a woman.\u2019\n\nThere is an important peculiarity in the use of affixes, as far as the plural number is concerned. The nominative plural, as we saw, ends in \u0101k or merely in k; we might therefore expect that the affixes would, as in the singular number, be simply added, and Bellew in his Grammar puts it so, that is, he writes kasar\u0101k \u2018the ways,\u2019 genitive kasar\u0101k-na, dative kasar\u0101k-e. Trumpp, however, states that he only found one single instance of such an inflexion. Example: \u0634\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0647\u0627\u06a9 \u0646\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0628\u0628 \u067e\u062f\u0627 \u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0633 \u0631\u0646\u06af \u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0648 shar banday\u0101k n\u0101 mahabbat pad\u0101 y\u0101 m\u014dn, ti as rang ti \u014d \u2018the love of good men to our face or behind our back is of the same colour\u2019 (Nicolson, p. 14, line 1). It is therefore possible that the form may prevail in some of the Brahui dialects, but it appears to be very rare. Leech and Bux make no mention of it at all. This is a point for further investigation.\nThe peculiar phenomenon connected with the plural is this: the nominative of the plural ends in \\( \\text{\u0101k} \\) or \\( k \\). We should therefore expect that the affixes will be added to the termination. But such is not the case, because \\( \\text{\u0101k} \\) or \\( k \\) changes into \\( \\text{\u0101t} \\) or \\( t \\). The genitive plural should stand as a rule thus: \\( \\text{\u0101t-na} \\) or \\( t-na \\), but it changes into \\( \\text{\u0101t-\u0101} \\) or \\( t-\u0101 \\). The affix \\( e \\) of the dative-accusative is similarly added to \\( \\text{\u0101t} \\) and \\( t \\), and becomes \\( \\text{\u0101t-e} \\) and \\( t-e \\). It should be here stated that this case serves as a formative for the instrumental, conjunctive, ablative, and the locative, and for some other affixes.\n\nAs to the origin of these affixes, we have noticed already that the genitive affixes \\( n\u0101 \\) and \\( \u0101 \\) are found in Dravidian languages; the same happens with the dative-accusative affix \\( e \\), of which there is an equivalent in Tamil in \\( ai \\), and in Malayalam in \\( -e \\).\n\nThe vocative is identical with the nominative, but is usually preceded by the interjection \\( ai \\), and occasionally the Persian affix \\( ai \\) is added. For instance, \u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0648\u0627 \u2018O father!\u2019\n\nThe inflexions given by Bellew, Leech, and Finzi, appear according to Trumpp to be erroneous.\n\nHere follow examples of nominal inflexions.\n\nI.

Nicolson sometimes simply adds them to the root, at others he writes them separately. Trumpp prefers adding simply to the root those affixes which begin with a vowel; but such as commence with a consonant, stand separate. As to the pronunciation, Bux changes the e of the plural into i, and for euphony's sake inserts y between them. For instance, in the ablative and locative cases, khalatiy\u0101n, khalatiy\u0101s. This mode of writing, however, appears to have been borrowed from the Urdu, as the spirit of the Brahui would prefer using the \u0121 to fill up hiatuses. The e of the accusative sing. and plural seems to be short and mute, because the accent appears to fall on the root. For instance, khal-e, khal-\u0101k, khal-\u0101t-a, khal-\u0101te-at (or khal-\u0101tiy\u0101t), khal-\u0101te-t\u014d, khal-\u0101te-an, (khal-\u0101tiy\u0101n), khal-\u0101te-de (khal-\u0101tiy\u0101e), khal-\u0101te-t\u012b.\n\nConcerning the affix t\u014d, we find in Bux's examples the following forms: \u0645\u0633\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0648 masir\u0101t-t\u014d and \u0628\u0627\u0648\u063a\u0627\u062a\u06cc\u062a\u0648 b\u0101va-y-\u0101t-e-t\u014d. We see in the first case the t\u014d added to the plural at, and in the other to the formative of the plural. Trumpp found it mostly in connection with the formative of the plural.\n\nb.

For instance, \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u062a 'mother,' pl. \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u062a 'mothers.' In those nouns on the other hand, in which the final ah is preceded by a long vowel, the ah is dropped, and the plural k substituted. For instance, \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06a9 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06a9 'son,' pl. \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06a9 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06a9 'sons.'

For instance, \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0647\u06cc sip\u0101h\u012b-e 'to the soldiers.'\n\nThe \u0639 (ain) is an unknown sound in the Brahui; therefore, words written with a final \u0639 are considered as ending in a simple long vowel. For instance \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 shur\u016b\u02bf 'beginning,' \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0627\u0646 shur\u016b\u02bf-\u03b3-\u0101n 'from the beginning.'\n\n### The Articles.\n\nThe definite article is unknown in the Brahui, but there is the indefinite one as. If the noun ends in a consonant, as (the short form of \u0627\u0633\u06cc asi 'one') is added thereto; but it often happens that the \u0627\u0633\u06cc is used at the same time before the noun, for instance, \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u0628\u0646\u06af\u0633 as\u012b banday-as 'one man.'\n\nWhen the noun ends in a vowel, the \u0627\u0633\u06cc, as a rule, is put before; an instance to the contrary is cited by Trumpp in \u062c\u062a\u06be\u06cc\u0633 chithi-as (Bux, p. 12, l. 9).\nWhen the noun ends in \\( \\text{ah} \\), the postposition \\( \\text{as} \\) is written separately, for instance, \\( \\text{pinjra-as} \\) 'a cage.'\n\nObserve, however, that the \\( \\text{as} \\) can never be put between the root and the inflecting syllable.\n\n\u00a7 4. The Adjective and its Grammatical Relations.\n\nThe language of the Brahui knows only roots of nouns and has no special adjectives; the noun, used in the form of an adjective, has therefore no gender, and is subject to the general rules of inflection given above.\n\nThe noun-adjective precedes the subject, and forms with it a grammatical whole; the affixes, therefore, of the number and cases belong to the last noun only. Example: \\( \\text{\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0647\u06af\u0627\u062a\u0627 \u0639\u0642\u0644 \u062a\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u06cc} \\) 'according to the wise men it is good.'\n\nThe noun-adjective remains in the singular, even if the subject to which it relates stand in the plural number. Example: \\( \\text{\u062f\u0627 \u0647\u06cc\u062a\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u062a \u062d\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0631} \\) 'over this matter they were perplexed' (Nicolson, p. 22, l. 8).\n\nA peculiarity noticeable here is this, that the descriptive adjectives are capable of assuming a determinate or indeterminate form, by the addition of a long \\( \\text{a} \\) for the former, and, as a rule, of a short \\( \\text{o} \\) for the latter, for instance, \\( \\text{\u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0644 \u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u06a9\u06cc\u062a\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0634\u0633} \\) 'thou sittest in thy palace on the royal throne' (Abu'l Hasan, p. 7, l. 9); the adjective here is \\( \\text{\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u06c1\u06cc} \\) \\( \\text{badshahi} \\), its determinate form being \\( \\text{\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u06c1\u06cc\u0627} \\) \\( \\text{badshahia} \\). Also \\( \\text{kabena karim} \\) 'the important business' (adj.). Adjectives ending in \\( \\text{a} \\) or \\( \\text{s} \\) remain unchanged. Example: \\( \\text{\u067e\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0647\u06af\u0627\u062a \u062a\u06cc\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0631} \\) (Sindhi \\( \\text{\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940} \\) = \\( \\text{\u0939\u0932\u093e} \\)) 'honest men like we' (Nicolson, p. 1, l. 5 from below).\n\nNo examples are forthcoming of adjectives ending in other vowels.\n\nIt seems, however, not to be the absolute rule to determinate an adjective by the addition of \\( \\text{a} \\); exception to this we find especially in foreign words. Example: \\( \\text{\u06a9\u0645\u0632\u0648\u0631 \u0631\u0639\u06cc\u062a\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062a\u0645\u062d} \\) 'Show love to weak subjects, that thou mayest not be overcome by a strong enemy' (Nicolson, p. 5, l. 6).\nThe indeterminate form is expressed, as a rule, by affixing \u0648 \u0648. Example: \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a\u0633 'a blind man' (Bux, p. 116, l. 11), \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a 'an old man,' \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a 'a good man,' \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u0628\u062f\u0646\u06af\u0644\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a 'an ugly man.' Adjectives ending in a long vowel remain unchanged when the vowel is an \u0627. Example: \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u0646\u0634\u06cc \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a\u0633 'a drunken man' (Nicolson, p. 19, l. 5).\n\nWhen the ending is in a \u0627, the \u0648 \u0648 may be added or not. Example: \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a\u0633 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u06cc 'a wise man said,' \u0647\u0645\u0686 \u06a9\u0633 \u067e\u0631\u0646\u06af\u0627 \u0636\u0639\u06cc\u0641\u0647 \u067e\u0633\u0646 \u06a9\u067e\u0631 'nobody wants an old woman.' A few adjectives change the terminal \u0627 into \u0648 \u0648. Example: \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0648 bhalo 'good' (from \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0627, Sindhi \u0645\u0644\u06cc). Example: \u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0648 \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0633 'thou art a great vezir of this kingdom' (Nicolson, p. 23, l. 3).\n\nAdjectives with a terminal s ah remain unchanged or assume an \u0648 \u0648. Example: \u062f\u0627 \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u0647 \u0628\u06cc \u0634\u06a9\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a \u0646\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0631\u06cc 'this is a deed of a low and ungrateful man' (Nicolson, p. 7, l. 7), \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u06af\u0646\u062f\u0648\u06af\u0631\u0632\u0627 'a bad thing.'\n\nThese affixes have struck Lassen's attention, without being able to explain their meaning; nor can Trumpp determine from the scanty materials at his disposal what the original signification of the above affixes \u0627 and \u0648 \u0648 may be. They seem to be traceable to some Dravidian affinity. The affix anga 'like' appears to be of Bal\u00fachi origin, e.g. \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0646\u06af\u0627 pir-anga 'old,' from \u067e\u06cc\u0631 pir 'an old man.' The affix aga seems also to be of Bal\u00fachi source, having converted the Bal\u00fachi adjective termination en into ang, anga, e.g. \u0628\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0631\u063a\u0627 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u0646\u06af\u0627 \u0647\u0644\u0645\u06a9\u062a \u06a9\u0647\u0634\u06af\u0631 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0631 'many swift horses perished,' \u0644\u0646\u06af\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u0634\u0642\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a \u062f\u0631\u0627\u062e \u0645\u0633 'the sick man recovered,' \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc 'the lame donkey accomplished his journey' (Nicolson, p. 16, l. 1, 2).\n\nDegrees of comparison there are none in the Brah\u00fai: we find the same peculiarity in all the Dravidians. The adjective remains unchanged, and the object with which it is compared is placed in the ablative case, as \u062c\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0686\u0628 \u062a\u0648\u0648\u0644\u06af \u06a9\u0634\u0631\u0626\u06cc 'It is better\nto sit still than to quarrel' (Bux, p. 108, l. 6), ham\u012bn\u0101 ust banday na ust\u0101n sakht \u0101re 'his heart is harder than the heart of the man' (Bux, p. 116, l. 1).\n\nYou may also raise the meaning of the adjective by the use of the words bah\u0101z 'much,' and whalo 'great,' or the word ziy\u0101sti 'addition,' e.g. 'my sister is more beautiful than I' (Bux, p. 129, l. 2). da ziy\u0101sti shar e 'that is better.'\n\nThe superlative is expressed by the word kul or drust, e.g. da tajvis kal\u0101n shar e 'that plan is best' (Bux, p. 86, l. 9).\n\n\u00a7 5. The Numerals.\n\nThe Brahui has words of its own for the first three numbers only; the rest have been probably forgotten and eventually borrowed from the neighbours, especially from the Persian tongue.

The other Ordinal Numbers are\nformed in a regular manner by affixing *miko* or *viko*. The terminal *ko* seems to answer to the Dravidian *agu* (Caldwell, p. 251).\n\nThe meaning 'times' is expressed in Brahui as in Baluchi and Persian by \u0648\u0627\u0631\u060c for instance, \u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0644\u06cc 'this is the first time,' (Nicolson, p. 33, l. 7), \u062f\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u067e\u0627 dov\u0101r p\u0101 'say it a second time.'\n\nThe subject numbered stands, after a cardinal number, as a rule, in the singular, for instance, \u0635\u062f \u0633\u0627\u0644 sad s\u0101l 'one hundred years' (Bux, p. 115, l. 4-5), \u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0647\u06cc\u0626\u062a 'I have taken up two asses' burden;' but sometimes the plural also is used.\n\nExample: \u0627\u063a \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0646\u062c \u0628\u06cc\u0636\u0647 \u063a\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0632\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0648 \u06a9\u0644\u06af\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u06cc \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u0648\u0631 'When the Sultan gives an order to take five eggs by force, then his soldiers will cook a thousand fowls' (Nicolson, p. 8, l. 5 from below). The verb stands in the plural with the numbered subject, even when after a cardinal number the subject be in the singular. Example: \u062c\u0647\u0644 \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u067e\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0644\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0631 \u0647\u0645\u0648\u0641\u062a\u06cc \u062a\u0648 \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0648 \u062a\u0648\u0628 \u0622\u0634\u0631 'forty thousand infantry extended over the plain, fifty big guns accompanied them' (Nicolson, p. 28, l. 2-5 from below).\n\n\u00a7 6.

'were' plur.\nThe instrumental case should be *kane-at*, *nane-at*, but Trumpp has not met with an instance of it.\n\nHow far *i* and *kan* are related to the Dravidian forms is still uncertain. The plural *nan* corresponds entirely to the Dravidian analogies (for instance, *nam* in Tamil), and we may therefore conclude, with some certainty, that there must be a Dravidian root for the singular as well.\n\nWe might ask, why should not the genitive be written *kan-na* and *nan-na*? Bellew indeed writes \"kan\u0101 and in the plural nann\u0101,\" but this is not admissible. Bux declares that the final *n*, for instance, in *kan* before the genitive affix *na*, should be dropped; hence *kan\u0101*, *nann\u0101* would be preferable.\n\n**The Second Person.**\n\n|       | Singular | Plural |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| Nom.  | \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651   ni, 'thou.' | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u064f\u0651 num. |\n| Gen.  | \u0646\u064e\u0627   n\u0101. | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0627 num\u0101. |\n| Dat.  | \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651   ni | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 nume. |\n| Acc.  | \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651   ni | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 nume. |\n| Conjunct. | \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u062a\u0648\u064f ni-t\u014d. | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u062a\u0648\u064f nume-t\u014d. |\n| Abl.  | \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 ni-an. | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 nume-an. |\n| Loc.  | \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650 ni-\u0101o. | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650 nume-\u0101o. |\n|       | \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0650 ni-ti. | \u0646\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0650 nume-ti. |\n\n*Obs.*\u2014The root *ni*, *num* (*num\u0101*) is found in all the Dravidian languages (Caldwell, p. 519).\n\nIn Brah\u00fa\u00ed the genitives of pronouns stand for the possessive pronouns.\n\n**The Third Person.**\n\nThe Brah\u00fa\u00ed has no pronoun for the third person; such is the case in the Dravidian languages also; but, to supply this defect, it makes use of Demonstrative Pronouns. These are: \u062f\u0627 da 'this,' \u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0648 \u0101 'the same,' \u0627\u06cc \u0113 'that.'\nb.

The demonstrative root da appears in the adverbial formations also, for instance, \u062f\u0627\u0632\u06cc d\u0101-re or \u062f\u0627\u0632\u06cc d\u0101-s\u0101 'now.'\n\nTo appreciate properly the inflexion of the oblique cases of the singular (with the exception of the genitive), it is necessary to assume that d\u0101d is the root, the final d of which is changed into the cerebral \u1e0d or r; and, indeed, such cerebral \u1e0d is to be found in the Telugu word v\u0101\u1e0du 'he.' The plural form daf-k would show that there exists a singular in daf or dav; these final letters, however (f and v), may be used by way of euphony.\n\nWe also find that the Brahui adopts the Persian particle \u0647\u0645 ham 'that very,' as a preposition to the demonstrative pronoun \u062f\u0627, and says \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0627 hand\u0101. Example: \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0647 \u067e\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u06af\u0626\u062f\u0627\u0633\u0627 \u06af\u0626\u0648 'if that matter is so, speak, that I may now go'; hand\u0101d-t\u014d bar\u0101m \u0113t\u0113 'marry me to this man' (Leech, p. 15, l. 5 from below).\n\nThe use of \u0647\u0645 in connection with the demonstrative pronoun has evidently been borrowed from the Baluchi.\n2. \u0627\u0648 \u0648 = 'it, the same.'\n\nThis occupies a middle place between the demonstrative pronoun da and e, and corresponds to the Dravidian u 'it,' Latin 'is.'\n\nSingular.

But when the demonstratives refer to a noun, they are looked upon as adjectives, and are not inflected, e.g. \u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0686\u06cc\u0631\u06a9 \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06af \u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u06cc da mokhirik bining n\u0101 ar\u0113r 'these shoes are there to put on'; \u062f\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0646\u06af\u0627\u062a\u0627 \u0644\u06af\u0647; \u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0644 \u062a\u06cc this is that man's mother' (Bux, p. 96, l. 6); \u067e\u0647\u0644\u0648 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u06cc 'are the fish in this river very large' (Bux, p. 52, l. 1 from below).\n\nc. The Reflective Pronoun.\n\nImmediately on the personal pronouns follows the reflective pronoun \u062a\u06cc\u0646 ten or \u062a\u06cc\u0646 t\u0113nat: the latter is used in the nominative only, while all the case-affixes are connected with \u062a\u06cc\u0646. In the Dravidian languages this occurs as tan or t\u0101n, and is there inflected in a regular form.\n\nThe form \u062a\u06cc\u0646 ten or \u062a\u06cc\u0646 t\u0113nat has no plural, the number being expressed either by another pronoun or by a verb.\n\nSingular and Plural.\n\n| Nom. | \u062a\u06cc\u0646 ten, \u062a\u06cc\u0646 t\u0113nat, 'self.' |\n| Gen. | \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 ten\u0101. |\n| Dat. | \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc t\u0113ne. |\n| Acc. | \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc t\u0113ne. |\nConjunct. \u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0648 t\u0113n-t\u014d.\nAbl. \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u0646 t\u0113n-\u0101n.\nLoc. \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06ba t\u0113n\u012b-\u0101o.\n\u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06ba \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06ba t\u0113n\u012b-\u0101o.\n\nThe locative seems irregular. It should stand \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06ba t\u0113n-\u0101o; but Nicolson gives the following example: \u0627\u0648 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06ba \u0647\u0631\u0627 o t\u0113n\u012ba hira \u2018he looked upon himself.\u2019\n\nAn example of how \u062a\u06cc\u0646 is used in the plural form is given by Nicolson: \u0646\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u062c\u0648\u0632 \u06a9\u06cc\u0646 nane bah\u0101nah-t\u014d t\u0113n murdah j\u014dr k\u0113n \u2018we shall by simulation make ourselves dead\u2019 (Abu\u2019l-Hasan, p. 18, l. 2).\n\n\u062a\u06cc\u0646 is used in the same manner as \u062e\u0648\u062f in Persian, because it expresses not merely the meaning, \u2018self,\u2019 in the nominative (Example: \u0647\u0631 \u06a9\u0633 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u06a9\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u062a \u06a9\u06cc let every man look out for himself,\u2019 Bux, p. 90, l. 9), but in the other cases represents the pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence. Example: \u0627\u0648 \u062e\u0644\u06cc \u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0648 \u062a\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 o khale t\u0113n to tik\u0101 \u2018he took the stone to himself\u2019 (Nicolson, p. 9, l. 6 from the bottom).\n\nThe genitive \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 represents in Brahui the possessive also, since it has to follow the subject to which it refers, like the Persian \u062e\u0648\u062f following after a noun. Examples: \u0627\u06cc \u0646\u06cc \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0632\u06cc\u0632 \u0646\u0627 \u062c\u06af\u0647 I shall not put thee again, in the place of a friend,\u2019 etc. (Nicolson, Abu\u2019l-Hasan, p. 14, l. 3 from below), \u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u062e\u0632\u0627 \u0646\u0686\u06be\u06cc \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u062a\u0633 Afterwards he gave the order to his treasurer\u2019 (Nicolson, Abu\u2019l Hasan, p. 20, l. 5).\n\nd. Interrogative Pronouns.\n\n1. The interrogative pronoun \u062f\u06cc\u0631 d\u0113r \u2018who,\u2019 refers to living subjects only. It has no plural, and therefore the idea of plurality has to be gathered from the context. It is used as a substantive noun only.\nSingular and Plural.\n\nNom. \u062f\u06cc\u0631 d\u0113r.\nGen. \u062f\u062a\u0627 din-na.\nDat. \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u06cc d\u0113r-e.\nAcc. \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u06cc d\u0113r-e.\nConjunct. \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u062a\u0648 d\u0113r-t\u014d.\nAbl. \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 d\u0113r-\u0101n.\nLoc. \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u0626 d\u0113r-\u0113.\n\u062f\u06cc\u0631\u0626 d\u0113r-\u012b.\n\nD\u0113r is of Dravidian origin. Caldwell, at p. 317, mentions y\u0113r, and with a transition from y\u0113 in d\u0113 and d\u0113r.\n\nFor the genitive case we must suppose the existence of din, which has been formed by adding the formative n to d\u0113. There is a corresponding form dane \u2018what,\u2019 in the Tulu. Example: \u0646\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u0633 ni d\u0113r-us \u2018who are you?\u2019 \u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u06a9 \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u0648 da m\u0101k d\u0113r-o \u2018who are these boys?\u2019 \u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u0627 \u062f\u062a\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u06cc da ur\u0101 dinna-e \u2018whose house is this?\u2019 Idiomatically we may say, \u0646\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u0626\u06cc n\u0101 pin d\u0113r-ae \u2018what is your name?\u2019 (Bux, p. 56, l. 4), because the word name refers to a person: on the other hand, \u062f\u0627 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0646\u0627 \u067e\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0633\u06cc da shahar n\u0101 pin antase \u2018what is the name of this town?\u2019 (Bux, p. 58, l. 9 from below). Here inquiry is made for the name of a thing.\n\n2. \u0627\u0646\u062a ant or hant refers to inanimate subjects only, whether nouns or adjectives, and is not inflected, e.g. \u0646\u0627 \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0633\u06cc n\u0101 k\u016bkm ant-se (ant-ase) \u2018what is your command?\u2019 (Bux, p. 54, l. 8), \u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062a \u06a9\u0648\u0646\u0648\u0633 ni ant kun\u014ds \u2018what wilt thou eat?\u2019 (ibid. l. 4), \u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u06a9\u06cc\u0633\u0627 ni ant kar\u0113m kisa \u2018what business are you doing?\u2019 (Bux, p. 56, l. 15). To emphasize the question \u2018what kind,\u2019 the word \u0627\u0633 as \u2018a, an\u2019 may be affixed to the noun, e.g. \u0647\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0633 \u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u06cc hame ant gunah-as kar\u0113nti \u2018what crime has he committed?\u2019 (Bux, p. 56, l. 7).\n\n1 Bellew gives the case as d\u0113ry\u0101n, which according to Trumpp is incorrect.\n2 In Telugu y\u0113mi is \u2018what,\u2019 of which y\u0113di is the neuter; d\u0113ni is the inflection of both.\nN.B.\u2014 \u0627\u0646\u062a corresponds to the Tamil enda, which, according to Caldwell, is an adjective interrogative by changing e into a.\n\nThe Brahui form \u0627\u0646\u062a\u06cc anta-e 'why?' should be noticed here, e.g. \u0627\u0646\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u062d\u0645 \u06a9\u067e\u0633\u06d2 anta-e raham kap\u0113s\u0101 'why do you not show mercy?' (Nicolson, p. 19, l. 6). This seems to correspond to the Tamil enn\u0101y (Caldwell, p. 321), which is formed in a similar manner.\n\n3. \u0627\u0631\u0627 ar\u0101, both in meaning and in use, is the same as \u0627\u0646\u062a\u060c e.g. \u0627\u0648 \u0622\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0648 \u0622\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0648 \u0622\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0648 \u0622\u0631\u0627 ao ur\u0101 dr\u0101-a\u0113 'what house is that?' (Bux, p. 62, l. 6), \u0646\u06d2 \u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0627\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u062e\u0646\u0627\u0633 ne \u0101r\u0101 vakt aod\u0113 khan\u0101s 'at what time sawest thou him?' (Bux, p. 64, l. 2).\n\nThe etymology of \u0627\u0631\u0627 ar\u0101 is doubtful; perhaps it is related to the Telugu el\u0101 (Caldwell, p. 327).\n\nIf \u0627\u0646\u062a or \u0627\u0631\u0627 follow the relative pronoun \u06a9\u06c1 kah, then these interrogatives become demonstrative pronouns, 'that which,' e.g. \u0647\u0631\u06a9\u0633 \u06a9\u06c1 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u06c1\u0646\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0647\u0646\u062a \u06a9\u06c1 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u0622\u0634\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u06a9 \u067e\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u062a 'he who takes away his hand from his head, speaks that which comes into his heart' (Nicolson, p. 1, ll. 3-4). Should, moreover, \u0627\u0633 'a, an' be added to \u0627\u0646\u062a or \u0627\u0631\u0627, then the meaning is 'whatever,' e.g. \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0633 \u06a9\u06c1 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u06af \u06a9\u06cc\u06a9 \u062e\u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0627 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u063a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0631\u06cc 'whatever a man does, proceeds from God,' (Bux, p. 134, l. 1).\n\n\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0633\u06cc\u06a9\u0647 ant-as\u0113-kih (this is written mostly in this form) signifies 'because that,' 'for that,' literally, 'what is it that,' e.g. \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0633\u06cc\u06a9\u0647 \u06a9\u06c1\u0645 \u06a9\u06c1 \u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u062e\u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u064a 'because that, which I have done, God has done' (Bux, p. 134, l. 5 from below).\n\ne. Relative Pronoun.\n\nIn conformity with the true Dravidian dialects, the Brahui possesses no real relative pronoun. From its neighbour, the Baluchi, it borrows \u06a9\u06c1 kah to represent the relative pronoun, which is used entirely in the same manner as in the Baluchi, and in the Persian languages; the case and the number, which, as a matter of course, should belong to the relative, are taken up by a real pronoun. If the relative, logically speaking,\nstand in the nominative case: then, the pronoun just alluded to is left out, the same happens as to its accusative case also, e.g.\n\n\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06cc\u06a9 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062e\u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u06a9 \u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0631 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u0634\u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0627 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0632\u0646\u062c \u06a9\u067e\u0633\u06c1\n\u2018Such as are God-fearing men do not vex the hearts of their enemies\u2019 (Nicolson, p. 13, l. 2 from below).\n\n\u06c1\u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0646\u062f\u063a \u06a9\u06d2 \u0627\u0648\u0688\u06cc \u062a\u063a\u060c \u0628\u0634\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u062a \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0631\u06cc\n\u2018That man to whom sleep is better than waking, his death is better than his life\u2019 (Nicolson, p. 6, l. 2 from below).\n\n\u06a9\u06d2 by itself is sufficient to express this relation, especially when it refers to quality, quantity, time, or place, e.g.\n\n\u06a9\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0633\u060c \u0647\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0633\n\u2018as you speak, so will you hear\u2019 (Bux, p. 106, l. 17),\n\n\u06c1\u0645\u06cc \u0648\u0642\u062a \u06a9\u06d2 \u0632\u0627\u0647\u062f \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u0627\u06af\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc\u06af\u0627\n\u2018at that time when the ascetic returned to his house\u2019 (Nicolson, p. 14, l. 5 from below).\n\nf.

Yet the following sentence occurs also: \u0646\u0627 \u0637\u0628\u06cc\u0639\u062a \u0622\u0645\u0631\u0626\u06cc na tabiat amar-ae 'How is your health?' (Bux, p. 54, l. 9).\n\n4.

In the substantive form it means a 'thing,' and is used in the plural as well, e.g. \u062f\u0627 \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u062a\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0644\u0627\u0633 \u0634\u06a9\u06af \u0622\u0631\u06cc\nda gir\u0101t\u0101o gir\u0101o sang \u0101re 'on these goods is there any discount?'

Correlatives are formed by adding the relative pronoun \u06af to the interrogative adjective of quality or quantity, in consequence of which it obtains the power of a demonstrative pronoun, being a correlative in an adjectival form, answering the question.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{\u0622\u062e\u0647 \u06a9\u0647} - \\text{\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0647} \\\\\n&\\text{\u0647\u0686\u0647 \u06a9\u0647} - \\text{\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0632\u062e\u0647} \\\\\n&\\text{\u0622\u062a\u062f\u0631\u06a9\u0647} - \\text{\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0632 \u062a\u062f\u0631} \\\\\n&\\text{\u0647\u06af\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u06a9\u0647} - \\text{\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0646} \\\\\n&\\text{\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u06a9\u0647} - \\text{\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0646}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n'as much\u2014so much.'\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{\u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u06a9 \u0647\u0645\u0648\u062e\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u0633} \\\\\n&\\text{hakha ke kh\u0101hak hamokha d\u012btas} 'as much as he wishes, so much you may give' (Bux, p. 90, l. 4);\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nham\u014dn ke \u0101st\u0101d mar\u014d-e, ham\u014dn sh\u0101gird\u0101n mar\u014dr 'as the teacher, so will the pupils be' (Bux, p. 102, l. 11).\n\n\u00a7 7. THE VERB.\n\nThe Brahui language has only one conjugation, which, in accordance with the general type of the Dravidian languages, is inflected in a regular manner by agglutination. It differs, nevertheless, from the more cultivated of the Dravidians, as, for instance, from Tamil, in so far, that it has developed a greater number of tenses,\nowing probably to the influence of the neighbouring language, the Bal\u00fachi.\n\nAs regards the form, there is no difference between transitive and intransitive verbs; both are inflected in the same manner; and so is the causative verb, which in the Brah\u00fai was developed in accordance with the analogy of the Dravidian idioms.\n\nThe Brah\u00fai has an active as well as a passive form, although the latter seems to be seldom used.\n\nBut the special mark, which characterizes the Brah\u00fai as a Dravidian tongue, is the existence of the negative form, which runs through all the tenses. The negative is formed by adding the negation to the verbal root, before the personal inflection.\n\nThe Brah\u00fai has no moods, except the imperative\u2014we find no subjunctive, no optative, no conditional. The manner in which these are expressed we shall notice further on. The development of the participles is likewise very meagre.\n\n\u00a7 8. The Active, Affirmative Form of the Verb.\n\nAll the tenses in the Brah\u00fai language are divided into\u2014\n\nI. Such as are composed with the infinitive, and\n\nII. Such as are composed with the past participle.\n\nI. Tenses which are composed with the Infinitive and the Verbal Root.\n\nThe infinitive of all the Brah\u00fai verbs ends in ing, e.g. \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06af bin-ing \u2018to hear,\u2019 \u0647\u06cc\u0646\u06af hin-ing \u2018to go.\u2019\n\nThe infinitive is a verbal noun, and can therefore be declined like any other noun, e.g. \u0646\u06cc \u0648\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06d2 \u0647\u06cc\u0646\u06af \u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u0627\u062f\u06c1 \u0627\u0631\u06cc ni vildy-tae nd ar\u0101dah \u0101re \u2018is it your wish to go to Europe?\u2019 (Bux. p. 58, l. 7). This ending of the infinitive corresponds to the Tamil infinitive g-a, with a nasal pronunciation ng, with which the affix ngei should be compared (Caldwell, pp. 425, 434). By dropping the terminal syllable ing, we obtain not merely the root, but also the second person of the imperative, e.g. \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06af bin-ing \u2018to hear,\u2019 \u0628\u0646 bin \u2018hear thou\u2019; \u06a9\u0646\u06af kun-ing \u2018to eat,\u2019 imperative \u06a9\u0646 \u2018eat thou.\u2019\nThe second person plural of the imperative is formed by using the terminal \\( b\u014d \\), e.g. \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0646\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652} \\) bin-b\u014d \u2018hear ye,\u2019 \\( \\text{\u0643\u064f\u0646\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0652} \\) kun-bo \u2018eat ye.\u2019\n\nThere are a great number of verbs, which, as in the new-Persian, form their imperative in an irregular manner, since they do not derive it from the root inherent in the infinitive, but substitute a different verbal root for it; e.g. \\( \\text{\u062a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0652} \\) tin-ing \u2018to give,\u2019 imper. \\( \\text{\u0647\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0652} \\) hin-ing \u2018to see,\u2019 imper. \\( \\text{\u0647\u0650\u0631\u0652} \\) hir \u2018see,\u2019 from \\( \\text{\u0647\u0650\u0631\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) hir-ing, which is also in use.\n\nAs a rule, verbs whose root in the infinitive ends in \\( n \\), change it in the imperative into \\( r \\), and now and then the syllable \\( ak \\) is added, being an affix which seems to emphasize the imperative, e.g. \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) man-ing \u2018to be,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652} \\) mar \u2018be thou\u2019; \\( \\text{\u062f\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) dan-ing \u2018to take away,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0652} \\) d\u0101rak\\(^1\\); \\( \\text{\u0643\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) kan-ing \u2018to do,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652} \\) k\u0101-rak; \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) ban-ing \u2018to come,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652} \\) b\u0101-rak; \\( \\text{\u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) khan-ing \u2018to see,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0643\u0652} \\) kh\u0101n-ak; \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) bin-ing \u2018to hear,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0643\u0652} \\) bin-ak.\n\nOther imperatives drop the terminal consonants of the root of the infinitive, e.g. \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) pan-ing \u2018to say,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0627} \\) p\u0101; or they add \\( th \\) to it, e.g. \\( \\text{\u062a\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) tul-ing \u2018to sit,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u062a\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062b\u0652} \\) tul-th; \\( \\text{\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) khal-ing \u2018to strike,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062b\u0652} \\) khal-th; \\( \\text{\u062d\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) hal-ing \u2018to take,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u062d\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062b\u0652} \\) hal-th.\n\nOthers, again, retain in the imperative the same root as in the infinitive, e.g. \\( \\text{\u062c\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) char-ing \u2018to peregrinate,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u062c\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) charing, Sindhi \\( \\text{\u091a\u0930\u094d\u091a\u0942} \\); \\( \\text{\u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) tar-ing \u2018to spin,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) taring; \\( \\text{\u0631\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) ras-ing \u2018to arrive,\u2019 Imp. \\( \\text{\u0631\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0646\u0652} \\) rasing (Sindhi \\( \\text{\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f} \\), Persian \\( \\text{\u0631\u0633\u06cc\u062f\u0646} \\) rasidan).\n\nThe affix \\( ak \\) is dropped before the plural termination \\( b\u014d \\), e.g. \\( \\text{\u0647\u0650\u0646\u0652} \\) hin-ak, plur. \\( \\text{\u0647\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0652} \\) hin-b\u014d.\n\nIf the Imperative ends in \\( r \\) or \\( \\text{k} \\) \\( \\text{\u0647} \\) \\( \\text{k} \\) \\( \\text{\u0647} \\), these letters are also dropped before the plural termination \\( bo \\), e.g. \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652} \\) b\u0101-b\u014d; \\( \\text{\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652} \\) kar \u2018do,\u2019 \\( \\text{\u0643\u064e\u0628\u0652} \\) k\u0101b\u014d; \\( \\text{\u0634\u064e\u063a\u0652} \\) sh\u0101y \u2018put down,\u2019 pl. \\( \\text{\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0652} \\) sh\u0101-b\u014d, etc.\n\n\\( Th \\) will likewise, like \\( ak \\), be dropped in all plural cases, e.g. \\( \\text{\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062b\u0652} \\) khal-th \u2018strike,\u2019 plur. \\( \\text{\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0652} \\) khal-bo.

The same happens with the final vowel, e.g. \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc et\u0113 'give,' plur. \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u0628\u0648 et-b\u014d.\n\nThese peculiarities of the Brahui imperative require further elucidation, when more material is placed at our disposal.\n\nFrom the infinitive the continuous present\\(^1\\) is formed by adding to the present tense of the substantive verb \u0627\u062a ut, the postposition \u062a\u06cc ti 'in,' thus: \u062a\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc\u0646\u06af \u062a\u06cc ut, literally, 'I am placing.' This, however, can hardly be called a tense, as, in fact, it is a complete sentence, in which the infinitive takes the place of a noun, with a case-affix added thereto. Similar formations are to be found in the Baluchi, whence they were borrowed by the Brahui.\n\nFrom the verbal root of the imperative, after dropping the emphasized terminal ak and th, are formed:\n\na. The indefinite (simple) present tense (the aorist of English grammar) defining the time in a general way, and may therefore be used in the subjunctive, potential, and optative mood.\n\nThe verb substantive \u062a\u06cc ut is added to the root, but its pronunciation becomes soft. Moreover, the terminal t (ut) changes into v, but only in the present tense (both definite and indefinite); in the future, in the preterite, and in the perfect tenses, the t (of ut) is retained. In the third person plural, the personal termination r is strongly accentuated, whilst in the substantive verb the r is dropped.\n\nThe following are the terminations of the indefinite present tense. It should, however, be observed here that the Brahui verbs use no personal pronouns, except when emphasis is to be placed on a special person. Bux uses the personal pronouns, as in English.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. iv (ev) | in (en) |\n| ,, is (es) | ire (re) |\n| ,, e | ir (er) |\n\n\\(^1\\) Praesens continuum of Dr. Trumpp.\nIf the root ends in a long vowel, the \\( i \\) (above) is dropped, e.g. \\( p\u0101-(i)v \\) \u2018I may say,\u2019 plur. \\( p\u0101-n \\) \u2018we may say.\u2019 The \\( o \\) of the 3rd person singular, however, remains, e.g. \\( p\u0101-o \\) \u2018he may say.\u2019 The accent falls on the root; therefore, the personal endings are not sounded, e.g. \\( tikh-iv \\) \u2018I may place.\u2019\n\nb. The definite present tense is formed from the indefinite present tense by adding an \\( a \\) to the first and second persons singular, and likewise to the first and third persons plural. The third person singular takes a terminal \\( k \\), whilst the second person plural remains the same as in the indefinite form.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. \\( iv-a \\) (\\( eva \\)) | \\( in-a \\) (\\( ena \\)) |\n| 2 ,\\( is-a \\) (\\( esa \\)) | \\( ir-e \\) (\\( ero \\)) |\n| 3 ,\\( e-k \\) | \\( ir-a \\) (\\( era \\)) |\n\nN.B.\u2014To avoid confusion, which is noticed in the writings of Nicolson, Leech, Bux, and Bellew, not to mention Finzi, Dr. Trumpp proposes that the terminal \\( a \\) of the conjugations be designated by the aspirate \\( s \\), instead of the \\( l \\), or the diacritical \\( ' \\) fath, because this terminal \\( s \\) is not pronounced.\n\nc. The Simple Future Tense\n\nis formed by adding the terminal \\( o \\) to the verbal root, and also the verb substantive, which drops its vowel sound, except in the 3rd person singular. Therefore:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. \\( \u014d-t \\) | \\( \u014d-n \\) |\n| 2 ,\\( \u014d-s \\) | \\( \u014d-ro \\) |\n| 3 ,\\( \u014d-e \\) | \\( \u014d-r \\) |\n\nFrom the imperative \\( \u0113t\u014d \\), the future will be formed thus: \\( \u0113t-\u014d-t \\) \u2018I shall give.\u2019 From present indefinite \\( \u012b k\u0101v \\) \u2018I may go,\u2019 the future will be \\( \u012b k\u014d-t \\), etc.\n\nThe Brah\u00fai \\( \u014d \\) is derived from the Dravidian \\( o \\) by changes through \\( av \\).\nd. The Compound Future.\n\nIs formed by adding to the formative of the future ending \u014d, the past tense of the substantive verb, viz. \u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0627 etc., and dropping, as in the simple future, the \u0101. In the 3rd person singular the preterite of the substantive verb will be sas (= asas), instead of the usual form of asak or as. The personal terminations therefore are these:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Person: \u014d-suf. | \u014d-sun. |\n| 2 ,, | \u014d-sus. |\n| 3 ,, | \u014d-sas. |\n\nN.B.\u2014Bux, Bellew, Leech, and particularly the Italian Finzi, have entirely mistaken the composition of this tense.\n\nII. Tenses compounded with the Past Participle.\n\nThe real difficulty in studying the verbs commences with the formation of the past tenses, all of which proceed from the past participle. The usual way of forming the past participle is by adding \u0101 or \u0113 to the verbal root, e.g. \u062a\u06a9\u06be\u0646\u06af tikh-ing, past participle \u062a\u06a9\u06be\u0627 tikha; \u062a\u0627\u0645\u0646\u06af tam-ing \u2018to fall,\u2019 past participle \u062a\u0627\u0645 tam-\u0101; \u062b\u0627\u0631\u0646\u06af thar-ing \u2018to cut,\u2019 past participle \u062b\u0627\u0631\u0647 thar-\u0113.\n\nIf the verbal root end in \u0641 f, the past participle terminates with very few exceptions in \u0113; e.g. \u062a\u0627\u0641\u0646\u06af taf-ing, past participle \u062a\u0627\u0641 taf-\u0113.\n\nSome past participles end in a consonant, changing at the same time their infinitive verbal root, like the following:\n\n\u0628\u0646\u06af ban-ing \u2018to come,\u2019 past participle \u0628\u0646 bas.\n\u0628\u0646\u06af bin-ing \u2018to hear,\u2019 ,, ,, \u0628\u0646\u06af bing.\n\u062e\u0644\u0646\u06af khal-ing \u2018to strike,\u2019 ,, ,, \u062e\u0644\u06a9 khalk.\n\u062f\u0646\u0646\u06af dan-ing \u2018to take away,\u2019 ,, ,, \u062f\u0631 dar, \u062f\u0631\u06cc dar-\u0113.\n\nOther verbs retain the infinitive entirely, and form the past participle by simply adding to it the letter \u0101; e.g. \u0686\u0631\u0646\u06af char-ing \u2018to wander,\u2019 past participle \u0686\u0631\u0646\u06af\u0627 charing-\u0101; \u0631\u0633\u0646\u06af ra-ing \u2018to arrive at,\u2019 past participle \u0631\u0633\u0646\u06af\u0627 rasing-\u0101.\n\n1 Futurum exactum of Dr. Trumpp.\nIt is important to note here that the past participles, be they formed by transitive or intransitive verbs, have an active meaning and never a passive one, e.g. \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e khalk means \u2018one that has struck,\u2019 and not \u2018one that was struck.\u2019 This is quite contrary to what we find in the Bal\u00fachi, and in the North Indian languages.\n\nThe following is the formation of those tenses which are effected by composition with the past participle:\n\n1. The Simple Past Tense.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe present tense of the substantive verb is added to the past participle; the 3rd person of the singular, however, has no such an addition, yet \\(ak\\) (-\\(k\\)) may be added, especially if the previous syllable end in a vowel.\n\nIf the past participle end in a consonant, the personal terminations are added unchanged, except that in the third person plural we find \\(ur\\) used instead of \\(\u014d\\).\n\nThe following is the form:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers.  |        |\n| \u0627\u06cc \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u062a\u064f kh\u00e1lk-ut\\(^2\\) \u2018I struck,\u2019 etc. | \u0646\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u0646\u0650 kh\u00e1lk-un. |\n| 2        |        |\n| \u0646\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u0633\u064f kh\u00e1lk-us | \u0646\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u0631\u0650 kh\u00e1lk-ure. |\n| 3        |        |\n| \u0627\u064e\u0648 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e kh\u00e1lk | \u0627\u064e\u0646\u06a9 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u0631\u0650 kh\u00e1lk-ur. |\n| \u0627\u064e\u0648 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u06a9 kh\u00e1lk-ak | \u0627\u064e\u0646\u06a9 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u0631\u0650 kh\u00e1lk-\u014d. |\n\nIf the past participle end in a vowel, the initial vowels of the substantive verb are dropped, e.g.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers.  |        |\n| \u0627\u06cc \u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064f khan\u0101-t \u2018I saw,\u2019 etc. | \u0646\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 khan\u0101-n. |\n| 2        |        |\n| \u0646\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0633\u064f khan\u0101-s | \u0646\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650 khan\u0101-re. |\n| 3        |        |\n| \u0627\u064e\u0648 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0627 khan\u0101 | \u0627\u064e\u0646\u06a9 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650 khan\u0101-r. |\n| \u0627\u064e\u0648 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0627\u0644\u0650\u06a9 khan\u0101-k |\n\nThe same happens if the past participle end in \\(\\varepsilon\\). In the 3rd person plural we always find the personal termination in -\\(r\\) if the past participle end in a vowel.\n\n\\(^1\\) The praeteritum of Dr. Trumpp.\n\\(^2\\) kh\u00e1lk-ut. See footnote, page 91. The transliteration of the personal pronoun has been omitted as superfluous.\nN.B.\u2014Bellew, Leech, and Finzi have entirely misunderstood this tense, and mixed it up with the imperfect.\n\nb. As the present definite is formed from the present indefinite, by the addition of \\(a\\): in like manner is the imperfect from the simple past. It is evident, therefore, that this terminal \\(a\\) must be a sign of something definite and permanent. To the third person singular there must invariably be added the personal termination \\(-ak\\) (-\\(k\\)), to distinguish it from the simple past, to which, therefore, is added the \\(a\\) of the imperfect. The second person plural does not take up the \\(a\\), and is therefore in appearance identical with the 2nd person plural of the simple past. The following is the scheme of the personal terminations of the imperfect. It should be noted, however, that the \\(a\\) at the end, be it written with \\(\\text{alif}\\), \\(\\text{hamza}\\), or \\(\\text{fatah}\\), is always mute.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. \\(t-a\\) | \\(n-a\\) |\n| 2 , \\(s-a\\) | \\(re\\) |\n| 3 , \\(\\begin{cases} ak-a \\\\ -k-a \\end{cases}\\) | \\(r-a\\) |\n\nN.B.\u2014Bellew, Leech, and Finzi are mistaken about the tense.\n\nc. The Pluperfect\n\nis formed by adding to the past participle the imperfect of the substantive verb, namely \\(\\text{asak}\\), and if the past participle end in a vowel, then the initial vowel of the verb substantive is dropped. In the third person singular the verb substantive becomes \\(\\text{asa-s}\\) instead of \\(\\text{asak}\\); and if the past participle terminates in \\(s\\), then \\(as\\) only is assumed for the sake of euphony.\n\nThe scheme of the pluperfect:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. \\(\\text{asuf}, -\\text{suf}\\). | \\(\\text{asun}, -\\text{sun}\\). |\n| 2 , \\(\\text{asus}, -\\text{sus}\\). | \\(\\text{asure}, -\\text{sure}\\). |\n| 3 , \\(\\text{asas}, -\\text{sas}, \\text{as}\\). | \\(\\text{asur}, -\\text{sur} (\\text{sur, so}).\\)\n\nN.B.\u2014Bellew and Leech have mistaken this tense for the perfect.\nd. The Formation of the Perfect\n\nis peculiar, *un* being added to the past participle if it end in a consonant; if in a vowel, merely the letter *-n*. To the past participle thus formed, is added the verb substantive in its present tense.\n\nThe scheme of the perfect is then:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers.  | *un-ut*, *-n-ut*. | *un-un*, *-n-un*. |\n| 2        | *un-us*, *-n-us*. | *un-ure*, *-n-ure*. |\n| 3        | *un-\u0113*, *-n-\u0113*.   | *un-\u014d*, *-n-\u014d*.    |\n\nN.B.\u2014This formation of participle is entirely of Dravidian character, because even in the Tamil (Caldwell, p. 393) we find *i-in* as the sign of the past. Originally, therefore, the terminal *un* was nothing but a past participle; but as the Brahui has developed other forms for its past participle, it uses this old form for the perfect tense.\n\nThe following is the formation of all the tenses of the affirmative verb in the active voice.\n\n**Infinitive:** \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u064a\u064f khan-ing 'to see.'\n\n**Imperative:** 2nd Person Sing. \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652 khan or \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u064a\u064f kh\u00e1n-ak 'see thou.'\n\n2nd Person Plur. \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0628\u064f khan-b\u014d 'see ye.'\n\nA.

In those verbs where the imperative ends in ak, or where th was added to the root, which addition seems, likewise, to denote an emphasis, these terminals must be dropped.\n\nThe declinable present participle is formed by adding ok (sometimes \u014dk-\u0101, ok-\u014d) to the verbal root, e.g. khan-ok 'seeing,' from khan-ing 'to see;' kan-ing (imperative kar), kar-ok 'doing;' t\u016bl-ing (imper. t\u016bl-th), t\u016bl-ok 'sitting;' khal-ing (imper. khal-th) khal-ok 'striking.' Examples:\n\nA man who will sit in that house; 'One day the preacher said' (Bux, p. 127, l. 20).\n\nThe second participle of the present, or rather, the indeclinable gerund, is formed by adding to the verbal root the affixes esa or isa. Bux, at page 15, says that the affix is simply sa. The terminal o seems identical with ah. Example:\n\nBecause on the morrow, in the morning, at the time when some horsemen of the Mogul came galloping on their horses towards Singaph, and making a noise, beating the drums, swinging their swords, arrived near the fort' (Nicolson, page 33, l. 1\u20133).\n\n'Complaining, sobbing she went to Zubaidah' (Nicolson, p. 19,l.5).\n\u00a7 9. The Active Negative Form of the Verb.\n\nThe special characteristic by which the Brahui becomes stamped as a Dravido-Turanian language is the negative form of its verb. It is formed by adding the negative affix to the verbal root and then inflecting the personal terminations in the usual manner.\n\nThe Brahui, moreover, has this peculiarity that it possesses two negative affixes, namely, one for those tenses which are formed by the past participle, and another for those compounded with the verbal root.\n\nN.B.\u2014The observations made on this point by Bellew, Leech, and Finzi are wrong.\n\nA. Tenses Compounded with the Negative Form of the Verbal Root.\n\nThe infinitive seems to be absent, being considered as a noun.\n\nThe imperative mood and the tenses of the present, future, and of the futurum exactum, take up the syllable pa. The negative, respectively prohibitive form of the imperative mood, stands therefore thus:\n\n2nd person singular \u06cc pa. 2nd person plural \u06cc p\u014d.\n\nExample: sing. \u062e\u0627\u0646 pa \u2018see not!\u2019 plur. \u062e\u0627\u0646 pa-b\u014d.\n\nIf in the imperative, the root end in r or \u1e63 (\u03b3), then the terminal is dropped, e.g. \u06a9\u0631 kar \u2018do thou,\u2019 prohibitive \u06a9\u0627 pa\u2019 (instead of kar-pa), plural \u06a9\u0627 pa-b\u014d; \u0634\u0627\u06cc sh\u0101y \u2018pour in,\u2019 prohibitive \u0634\u0627 pa.\n\nIf p is placed between two vowels, it is often changed into f, e.g. \u0628\u06cc fa \u2018come not\u2019 (\u0628\u0631 \u2018come\u2019), \u0645\u06cc fa \u2018be not,\u2019 instead of \u0645\u0627\u0631 pa.\n\nThe imperative affixes ak and th are always dropped before the negative, e.g. \u062f\u0627\u0631 ak \u2018take,\u2019 prohibitive \u062f\u0627 pa; \u062e\u0627\u0644 th \u2018strike,\u2019 prohibitive \u062e\u0627\u0644 pa.\n\nIn many verbs an e is placed before the negative affix, e.g. \u0628\u0633 e.g. \u0628\u0633 \u2018boil,\u2019 prohibitive \u0628\u0633 pa; \u0628\u06cc\u0646 bin \u2018hear,\u2019 prohibitive \u0628\u06cc\u0646 pa; \u062a\u0648\u0644 th \u2018sit,\u2019 prohibitive \u062a\u0648\u0644 pa.\n\n1 Kd-pa, etc. The accent is Dr. Trumpp\u2019s.\nSome are quite irregular, e.g. \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc etc 'give' (from \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u06a9), prohibitive \u0646\u0626\u06cc ti-fa.\n\nThe inflection of the present indefinite is as follows:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. pa-r | pa-n |\n| 2 ,, p-is (-es) | p-ire (-ere) |\n| 3 ,, p (i-p) | pa-s |\n\nThe peculiarities here are: the termination of the first person in pa-r, which, in accordance with the general rule, ought to be p-i-v. The third person singular ends in p(i-p), instead of p-e. In the 3rd person plural the pa-s is in reality a modification of the original r into s, in order to avoid confusion with the first person of the singular. We have met with this change of r into s in other Brahui words already.\n\nThe present definite has the same affixes with the addition of terminal a, to which, however, in the 3rd person singular, k is added. The form is this:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. pa-r-a. | pa-n-a. |\n| 2 ,, p-is-a (-es-a). | p-ire (-ere). |\n| 3 ,, pa-k. | pa-s-a. |\n\nThe Simple Future.\n\nHere we should expect the ending in p-ot, p-\u00f6s, etc.; but it is not so, as we notice by the following form:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers. pa-r-\u014d-t. | pa-r-\u014d-n. |\n| 2 ,, pa-r-\u014d-s. | pa-r-\u014d-re. |\n| 3 ,, pa-r-\u014d-e. | pa-r-\u014d-r. |\n\nThe r here appears as a formative affix of the negative verb.\n\nThe Compound Future.\n\nis similar to the simple future, since, instead of the present of the\nsubstantive verb, its past tense is used as in the affirmative form. Therefore:\n\n**Singular.**\n\n1 Pers. pa-r-\u014d-suf.\n\n2 ,, pa-r-\u014d-sus.\n\n3 ,, pa-r-\u014d-sas.\n\n**Plural.**\n\npa-r-\u014d-sun.\n\npa-r-\u014d-sure.\n\npa-r-\u014d-sur.\n\n**Conjugation of the Prohibitive Verb** \u062e\u0646\u06a9 kh\u00e1n-ing.\n\n1. **Imperative.**\n\n**Singular.**\n\n2 Pers. \u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0647 kh\u00e1n-pa 'see thou not.'\n\n**Plural.**\n\n\u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0648 kh\u00e1n-pa-b\u014d.\n\n2. **Present indefinite.**\n\n**Singular.**\n\n1 Pers. \u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0647 kh\u00e1n-pa-r 'I may not see.'\n\n2 ,, \u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0633 kh\u00e1n-p-is.\n\n3 ,, \u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0628 kh\u00e1n-p.\n\n**Plural.**\n\n\u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0646 kh\u00e1n-pa-n.\n\n\u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0633 kh\u00e1n-p-ire.\n\n\u062e\u0646\u06a9\u0633 kh\u00e1n-p-a-s.\n\nN.B.\u2014It should be noticed that the prohibitives \u06af\u06cc\u060c \u067e\u06cc\u060c \u0631\u06cc\u060c etc., are used in the present tense as well; thus, \u06a9\u067e\u0631 ka-par 'I may not, I will not do it.'

Negative Tenses Compounded with the Past Participle:\n\nThey are the simple past, the imperfect, the pluperfect, the perfect.\n\nThe negative particle here is ta, and not pa, as above. This leads to the supposition that these two forms are identical in their origin, and also that the Brahui ta, pa are derived from the Dravidian ka, through a change in the pronunciation.\n\nThe past participle has a peculiar formation, in taking up the negative affix, which renders the original root almost undistinguishable.\n\nIf the past participle end in a vowel, it is dropped and ta affixed to the root; then follows the affix of the past participle, which is pronounced au or ao, instead of simply a, e.g. \u062a\u06a9\u06be tikh-a, negative \u062a\u06a9\u06be-\u062a-\u0627 au.\n\nParticiples ending in r or s drop these terminals before taking up negative t, e.g. \u06a9\u0631\u06cc kar-\u0113 'he did' becomes \u06a9\u0648 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u06cc ka-t-au; \u067e\u0627\u0631\u06cc p\u0101r-\u0113 'he said' \u067e\u0627\u062a\u0648 p\u0101-t-au; \u0628\u0633 bas 'he came' \u0628\u062a\u0648 ba-t-au.\n\nIf the past participle end in a double consonant, the last is dropped, e.g. \u06a9\u0633\u06a9 khask 'he died,' negative \u06a9\u0633\u06a9\u0648 khas-t-au; \u0647\u0644\u0643 halk (from \u0647\u0644\u0643) 'he took,' negative \u0647\u0644\u0643\u0648 hal-t-au.\n\nThis is the scheme of the negative tenses connected with the past participle:\n\nThe Simple Past Tense.\n\nSingular.  \n1 Pers. t-av\u00b9-at.  \n2 ,, t-av-is (-es).  \n3 ,, t-au.\n\nPlural.  \nt-av-an.  \nt-av-ire (-ore).  \nt-av-as.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 au before a vowel becomes av.  \n\u00b2 r changes into a.\nImperfect.\n\nSingular.  \n1 Pers. t-av-at\u00b7a  \n2 ,, t-av-is-a  \n3 ,, t-av-ak-a\n\nPlural.  \nt-av-an-a  \nt-av-ire  \nt-av-as-a\n\nPluperfect.\n\n1 Pers. t-av-asu\u1e6d  \n2 ,, t-av-asus  \n3 ,, t-av-asas\n\nPerfect.\n\n1 Pers. ta-n-u\u1e6d  \n2 ,, ta-n-us  \n3 ,, t-a-ne\n\nHere is an example of the conjugation of these prohibitive tenses:\n\n6.

III. The Formation of the Verb Causative.\n\nThe formation of the causative form is, as a rule, effected by the addition of *if* (*ef*) to the verbal root; e.g. \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0646\u06af 'to eat,' \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0646\u06af 'to make eat, to feed,' Hungarian *omni*, *et-omni*. Bollew speaks of a double causative form, for instance, *khuling* 'to be afraid,' *khulifing* 'to frighten,' *khulifing* 'to make frightened.' Dr. Trumpp thinks this a mistake.\n\nThe conjugation of the *causative* is otherwise quite regular. It should be observed, however, that the past participle always ends in *\u0113*, as has been noted already.\n\n1 Dr. Trumpp transfers the accent to the second syllable, possibly a printer's error.\nThe Conjugation.\n\nInfinitive.\n\n\u0631\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064e\u0646\u06af r\u00e1s-of-ing 'to cause to arrive.'\n\nImperative.\n\nSing. \u0631\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0641 r\u00e1s-of (-if) 'cause thou to arrive.'\nPlur. \u0631\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0641\u0648\u0648 r\u00e1s-of-bo (if-bo) 'cause ye to arrive.'\n\nA.\n\n1.

IV. The Passive Form.\n\nThe passive is formed by the addition of ing to the simple root, which is afterwards inflected regularly through all the tenses. To all appearance the passive root is the same as the infinitive of the active verb, although it has no intimate relation with it.\nThe Dravidian idioms have no special affixes for the passive voice, and are therefore compelled to define the passive meaning in sundry ways; the Turanian languages, on the contrary, possess many such particles. It seems that the Brahui terminal *ing* stands nearest to the Turkish reflective affix *i-n*, which, in verbal roots ending in a vowel or in *l*, is used as an affix for the passive voice. This passive formation is a special characteristic of the Brahui tongue.\n\nWhether an infinitive of the passive form exists or not, is uncertain; but, judging from the existence of a continuous present tense, we may assume that there is an infinitive of the passive in the Brahui language. *Imperative* it has none.\n\n**The Passive Form.**\n\n*Infinitive* \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u06af\u0650\u06cc khan-ing-ing \u2018to be seen.\u2019\n\nA.\n\n1. **Continuous Present tense.**\n\n   \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u06af\u0650\u06cc \u0627\u062a khan-ing-ing-ti ut \u2018I am being seen.\u2019\n\n2. **Present indefinite.**\n\n   \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u06af\u0650\u06cc khan-ing-iv \u2018I may be seen,\u2019 etc. Examples:\n\n   \u2018When a man is brought up on a charge of murder\u2019 (Bux, p. 92, l. 15).\n\n   \u2018The bedroom should be cleaned out at breakfast-time\u2019 (Bux, p. 74, l. 14).\n\n   \u2018In order that they may appear beyond their number\u2019 (Nicolson, p. 32, l. 5 from below).\n\n3. **Present definite.**\n\n   \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u06af\u0650\u06cc khan-ing-eva \u2018I am seen,\u2019 etc., e.g.\n\n   \u2018Afterwards, as often as the backs of the robbers were seen, the troops of the Government went after them\u2019 (Nicolson, Qal\u0101t, p. 3, l. 5).\n4. **Simple Future.**\n\n\u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u06af\u0648\u064f\u062a khan-ing-\u014dt 'I shall be seen,' etc., e.g.\n\n\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u06c1\u0646\u0648 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u06af\u0631\u0633 \u062a\u06d2 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u06af\u0648\u064f\u062a \u0646\u06cc 'If you do such a thing again, you shall be beaten' (Bux, p. 82, l. 11).\n\n5. **Compound Future.**\n\n\u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u06af\u0648\u064f\u0633\u062a khan-ing-\u014ds\u016bt 'I shall have been seen.'\n\nB.\n\n6. **Simple Past Tense.**\n\n\u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u06af\u0627\u062a khan-ing-\u0101-t 'I was seen,' etc., e.g.\n\n\u0647\u0645\u0648 \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0627\u0648\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u0648\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u0632\u063a\u0645\u0633 \u0644\u06af\u0627 \u0627\u0648\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0633 \u062a\u06be\u0632\u0646\u06af\u0627 'At that time a sword struck his hand, and one of his fingers was cut off' (Nicolson, p. 32, l. 8).\n\n\u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0626 \u0628\u06c1\u0644\u0648 \u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u06c1\u0633\u067e\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0631 'Some great chieftains of Siraj-ud-daulah were killed' (Nicolson, p. 29, l. 7 from below).\n\n7. **Imperfect.**\n\n\u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u06af\u0627\u0626\u06d2 khan-ing-\u0101-ta 'I was seen,' etc.\n\n8. **Pluperfect.**\n\n\u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u06af\u0627\u0626\u0633\u062a khan-ing-\u0101-s\u016bt 'I have been seen.'\n\n9. **Perfect.**\n\n\u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u06af\u0627\u0626\u0626\u062a khan-ing-\u0101-n-ut 'I had been seen,' e.g.\n\n\u06a9\u0626\u06a9\u0646 \u0645\u0633 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u0627\u0633\u06cc \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0646\u0627 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0632\u06d2 \u063a\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06af \u0646\u0627 'It so happened that they had been caught at the gate of a city on suspicion of being spies' (Nicolson, p. 22, l. 5).\n\nIt should be stated that the Brahui uses an inflecting passive participle of the preterite form, which coincides with the present participle of the active form. Example: \u062e\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0648\u064f\u062a khan-\u014dk (-ka, ko) 'seen,' \u06a9\u0631\u0648\u064f\u062a 'done'; this was overlooked by Leech, Bellew, and Bux; but the following examples place the fact beyond doubt:\n\n\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u067e\u0627 \u06af\u06cc\u0646\u06a9 \u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u062d\u0648\u064f\u062a \u0627\u0631\u06cc 'The sticks are exposed for sale' (Bux, p. 110, l. 13).\nA chain was tied to his neck from a window; he was sitting' (Nicolson, p. 13, l. 2).\n\nAt that time was there any cord round his neck or not?' (Bux, p. 94, l. 14).\n\nBecause that, by me written letter, nobody can read but myself' (Bux, p. 118, l. 11).\n\nShe saw his eyes bound, and his face swollen from the bandage' (Nicolson, Abu'l-Hasan, p. 23, l. 6).\n\nSince in the forms adduced in the above examples we find no vestige of the passive affix ing, there seems to be no doubt that the formation in ok, although used in the passive sense, is really identical with the present participle of the active form. The Brahui therefore follows, in this respect, the lines of the Dravidian idioms, which employ the participles of the active form in a passive sense.\n\nWhether a gerund, terminating in isa, be formed from the passive voice, cannot as yet be proved by an example; but if it exist, it will stand thus: khan-ing-esa. Nor has Dr. Trumpp found an example of the negative form in the passive voice, although there is nothing to stand in the way of such a formation. It would appear thus: khan-ing-par.\n\nDr. Trumpp draws attention to yet another form, which looks like a gerund; but from the only example he had met, he does not dare to determine its nature, namely the word kro in this sentence 'have you such business that has to be done, or desirest thou perhaps anything' (Nicolson, Abu'l-Hasan, p. 5, l. 3).\n\u00a7 12.

It is the root \u00e1re, which, in its turn, is inflected with the aid of \u0627\u062a, being related to the Dravidian ir.\n\nPresent definite.\n\nSingular.\n\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u064a\u062a i \u00e1re-t 'I am, I exist.'\n\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u064a\u0633 ni \u00e1re-s 'thou existesth.'\n\u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0631\u064a, \u0627\u0633\u064a \u062f\u0633\u064a \u014d \u00e1re, \u00e1se, se 'he exists.'\n\n\u00b9 Bux writes o throughout.\nPlural.\n\n\u0646\u0646 \u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u06cc\u0646 nan \u00e1re-n 'we are, we exist.'\n\u0646\u0645 \u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u06cc nom \u00e1re-re 'you exist.'\n\u0627\u0648\u06a9\u062a \u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u06cc \u00f2fk \u00e1re-r 'they exist.'\n\nObs. 3.\u2014Leech's and Bellew's present tense and aorist in asitut is a mistake: such verbal formation is impossible in the Brahui.\n\nThe negative form of \u0623\u062a and \u0627\u0631\u064a\u062a is effected with the root \u0627\u0641 'it is not,' to which are added the terminals of the substantive verb \u0623\u062a ut; in the 3rd person singular, however, ak is added, as in the past tense, or the root stands by itself.

Irregular Verbs.\n\nTo conjugate a Brahui verb it is necessary to know, besides the imperative, the prohibitive form and the past participle. In some instances, however, this is not sufficient, since the definite and indefinite present of the affirmative form are not derived from the imperative, but either the root is changed or another verb substituted. Such are in reality the irregular verbs in the Brahui.\n\nThe following are the irregular verbs we most frequently meet with, i.e. \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u06af kan-ing 'to do,' and \u0647\u06cc\u0646\u06af hin-ing 'to go.'\n\nI. \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u06af kan-ing 'To do.'\n\nImperat. sing. \u06af\u0631\u06a9 k\u00e1r-at\u00b9 'do thou,' plur. \u06af\u0648 k\u00e1-b\u014d 'do ye;'\npast. part. \u06af\u0631\u06cc k\u00e1r-\u0113 'done;' prohibitive sing. \u06af\u0647 k\u00e1-pa 'do not thou,' plur. \u06af\u067e\u0648 ka-pa-b\u014d 'do not ye.' The present definite and indefinite are not formed from the root \u06af\u0631 kar, but from \u06af\u064a ke.\n\nPresent indefinite.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers.  | \u0627\u06cc \u06af\u06cc \u06cc\u0627 ke-v 'I may do.' | \u0646\u0646 \u06af\u06cc \u0646\u0627\u0646 ke-n 'we may do.' |\n| 2        | \u0646\u06cc \u06af\u06cc \u0646\u06cc ke-sa 'thou dost.' | \u0646\u0645 \u06af\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0645 ke-ro |\n| 3        | \u0627\u0648 \u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0648 ke 'he does.' | \u0627\u0641\u06a9 \u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0641\u06a9 ke-ra |\n\nPresent definite.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1 Pers.  | \u0627\u06cc \u06af\u06cc \u06cc\u0627 ke-va 'I do.' | \u0646\u0646 \u06af\u06cc \u0646\u0627\u0646 ke-na 'we do.' |\n| 2        | \u0646\u06cc \u06af\u06cc \u0646\u06cc ke-sa 'thou dost.' | \u0646\u0645 \u06af\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0645 ke-ro |\n| 3        | \u0627\u0648 \u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0648 ke-k 'he does.' | \u0627\u0641\u06a9 \u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0641\u06a9 ke-ra |\n\nObs.\u2014The future and the future exact, on the contrary, are regularly derived from the root \u06af\u0631 kar, viz. \u06af\u0631\u0648\u062a kar-ot 'I shall do,' and \u06af\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a kar-ot-sut 'I shall have done.'\n\nObs. 2.\u2014The tenses of the past are regularly derived from the\n\n\u00b9 See footnote, page 91.\npast participle, i.e. the simple past, \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u062a kar-\u0113-t 'I did;' imperfect, \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u062a kar-\u0113-ta; pluperfect, \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a kar-\u0113-sut; perfect, \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u062a kar-\u0113-n-ut, etc.\n\nThe Negative Form\n\nhas a regular inflection.

A List of Irregular Verbs.\n\nThe following list, which has no pretension whatever to completeness, contains verbs presenting an irregularity either in the imperative mood, in the prohibitive form, or else in the past participle. It should be noted, again, what has already been said, that the regular past participle ends in \u0101, or if the root terminates in f, then the terminal of the past participle will be \u0113. All past participles not formed in this manner are classed as irregulars.\n\nBellew also has a list of this kind, but it is far from reliable.\n\n| Infinitive | Imperative | Prohibitive | Past

Postpositions.\n\nIn addition to the postpositions already mentioned when speaking of the declension, there are others which also are directly joined to the noun. Postpositions, which originally were nouns, require the genitive, or, if they express the idea of separation, division, or distance, the ablative case. Some of the latter class are joined to another postposition, with which they express a combined idea.\n\nN.B.\u2014Bux speaks of prepositions only, and mentions a few; they are comprised in this paragraph.\n\n1. Postpositions which are immediately joined to the Noun.\n\nTheir number is small:\n\n*isk\u0101 'until' (usque ad). Example: \u0628\u06c1\u0627 \u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0627 \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0633 'May you be spared for many days' (Nicolson, Abu'l-Hasan, p. 20, l. 2).\n\nsin\u0101n, siy\u0101n 'from, with.'

Forms a postposition, when joined to a noun, as \u06a9\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 'under,' etc.\n\nki 'in order, for the purpose of,' etc. Example: \u0647\u0645\u0648 \u0648\u0642\u062a \u06a9\u06d2 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u06cc \u0628\u0634 \u0645\u0633 'At the time when, for the purpose of saying prayer, he stood up' (Nicolson, p. 14, l. 8).\n2. Postpositions governing the Genitive.\n\nThese are all nouns having the meaning of adverbs, with or without a postposition, excepting those few derived from the Persian. They are:\n\n\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u06cc\u0627\u0646 b\u0101t-y\u0101n, \u0628\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u06cc\u0627\u0646 b\u0101t-y\u0101o 'up, on, over.'

Examples: 'After some years I came at the same time from Damascus' (Nicol. p. 20, l. 2 from bottom); 'At the end of (after) ten days I shall have lived three years in this house' (Bux, p. 82, l. 2 from bottom).\n\n\u0645\u064f\u0634\u064e\u062a 'must' Example: 'Look upon your life as a gain before the day when the news may arrive that this or that person is dead' (Nicol. p. 3, ll. 2, 3).\n\n\u0648\u0650\u06cc\u062f 'besides, without.' Example: 'The khalif said: besides God there is no other God' (Nicol. p. 20, ll. 2, 3).\n\n\u00a7 16. Adverbs.\n\nJudging even from the few examples at our disposal, it seems that Brahui is capable of forming adverbs from adjectives by means of the terminal ika, although this seems not quite in accordance with the spirit of the languages of the Dravidian group.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Just like Telugu, which forms adverbs from adjectives by adding ga: k and g are frequently interchangeable.\nExamples: 'Thou hast not wiped it well' (Bux, p. 74, l. 4 from below); 'How am I to walk when there is no strength in my feet?' (Nicolson, p. 17, l. 4).\n\nMost of the postpositions mentioned above (2, 3), are used as adverbs also, e.g. \u0628\u064f\u0632\u064e\u0651\u0627 burza 'above,' \u062a\u0650\u0647\u0650\u064a tahti 'inside,' \u062e\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0643 khuruk 'near,' etc., to which may be added \u0631\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 rah\u0101 'near,' \u0645\u064f\u0631 mur 'far.'\n\nBesides these, the Brahui has a number of real adverbs, which we can classify thus:\n\n1. **Adverbs of place**, as \u062f\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc dange, \u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc d\u0101ri 'here,' \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0648\u06cc hand\u0101re 'just here,' \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u06cc ham\u0113ngi, \u0627\u06cc\u0632\u06cc \u0113zi 'there,' \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc ham\u0113r\u012b 'just there.' The affix -nge corresponds to the Tamil -ngu, as ingu 'here,' and -re to the Tamil -ndu, Tulu -de and ide.\n\nTo this class belong the interrogative adverbs of place, such as \u0627\u0631\u0627\u067e\u06a9 ar\u0101-pik 'where?' \u0627\u0631\u0627\u067e\u06a9 ar\u0101-ng 'where?' \u0627\u0631\u0627\u067e\u06a9 ar\u0101-ng 'to where?' \u0627\u0631\u0627\u067e\u06a9 ar\u0101-k\u0101n 'whence?'\n\n2. **Adverbs of time**: viz. \u0627\u064a\u0646\u0648 \u0113no 'to-day,' \u067e\u06be\u06af\u0627 phag\u0101 'tomorrow,' \u067e\u06be\u0644\u0645\u06cc phalmi 'day after to-morrow,' \u0686\u0648\u0648\u0627 chhiv\u0101 'when?' \u0686\u0648\u0648\u0627 chhivat\u0101n 'how long since?' \u0647\u0631\u0686\u06be\u0648\u0627 har-chhiv\u0101 'whenever,' \u062f\u0627\u0633\u0627 d\u0101sa 'now,' \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0633\u0627 han-d\u0101sa 'just now,' \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0648 dar\u014d 'yesterday,' \u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc dare nan 'yesternight,' \u06a9\u0648\u0645\u0644\u062e\u0648\u062f\u0648 kumulkhud\u014d or \u0645\u0644\u062e\u0648\u062f\u0648 mulkhud\u014d 'two days ago,' \u0644\u0648\u0686\u0627\u0631\u06cc lo\u010d\u0101ri 'again,' \u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u0646 nanik\u0101n 'by night.' The compounds, such as \u0627\u0631\u0627\u0648\u0642\u062a ar\u0101qaqt 'when?' \u0647\u0631\u0648\u0642\u062a harvaqt 'at all times,' \u062f\u0648\u0627\u0631 dv\u0101r 'again,' do not belong here.\n\n2. Pronouns denoting quality may be used in a similar sense as adverbs, e.g. \u0647\u0645\u0648\u062d\u0646 hamohun 'in that manner,' \u062a\u06af\u0646 dahun 'in this manner,' \u0627\u0645\u0631 amar 'in what manner?' \u0627\u0646\u062a\u06cc anta-e 'why?' is in reality the dative of \u0627\u0646\u062a anta, corresponding to the Persian \u062c\u0631\u0627.\n\nSubstantive nouns also are used as adverbs, especially when repeated, for instance, \u0645\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646 mad\u0101n mad\u0101n 'slowly;' or the adjective \u0632\u0627 sa 'quick, quickly' (Persian \u0632\u0648\u062f).\n\u00a7 17. Conjunctions.\n\nIt is strange that the Brahui has developed no conjunctions: all are borrowed, though partially formed with Brahui roots.\n\nExamples:\n\n- **isk\u0101 kih** 'so long as' (or simply isk\u0101, identical with the postposition). Example: \u0627\u06cc\u0633\u06a9\u0627 \u06a9\u06c1 \u062d\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0646\u063a \u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u062a 'So long as the villain finds himself in circumstances of fortune' (Nicol. p. 10, l. 3).\n\n- **ag** 'when.' Example: \u0627\u063a \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0646\u0627\u0633 'If thou beholdest its walls, thou wouldest be surprised' (Nicol. Abu'l-Hasan, p. 3, ll. 2, 3).\n\n- **anta-e kih** 'because, for.' Examples:\n  \n  - \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0626\u06cc \u06a9\u06c1 \u06a9\u06cc \u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u0627 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648 'Because I shall go out early' (Bux, p. 110, l. 10).\n  \n  - \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0626\u06cc \u06a9\u06c1 \u06a9\u06cc \u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u0627 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648 'For I did not know of your presence' (Bux, p. 120, ll. 1, 2).\n\n- **bi** 'also' Sindhi \u0645\u06cc\u06ba or \u0645\u06cc\u06ba. Example: \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0632\u06cc \u06a9\u06c1 \u06a9\u0644 \u0627\u0631\u06cc 'Where there is a rose, there is also a thorn' (Bux, p. 102, l. 8).\n\n- **par** in the sense of 'and.' Example: \u0627\u0631\u063a \u067e\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u06c1 \u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0648 'Bring bread and milk.'\n\n- **tah** 'then, there' (Sindhi \u062a\u06be), especially in sentences which have a conditional meaning. Examples:\n  \n  - \u0627\u06af\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u06a9 \u062a\u06be \u06a9\u0644 'If he had the command, then he would do everything for his good' (Bux, p. 134, ll. 3, 4).\n  \n  - \u062e\u0644\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0626\u06cc \u062a\u06be \u0627\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u0626\u0648 'If he will show me the pain, then I will show him God' (Bux, p. 134, ll. 6, 7 from below).\n\n- **kih** (Persian) 'that, as, since, because.' Examples:\n  \n  - \u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0644\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u06a9\u06c1 'I fear that I have given you much trouble' (Bux, p. 119, l. 2 from below); \u06a9\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u06c1 \u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627 'He asked (that) where the master of the house had gone?' (Bux, p. 120, l. 2 from below).\n\n- **nav\u0101 nav\u0101 kih** (from the Persian \u0646\u0628\u0648\u0627 nav\u0101ra) 'lest, in\norder that not.' Example: 'I fear lest the thieves may come' (Bux, p. 132, l. 6).\n\n\u0648\u064e 'and,' is seldom used in Brahui.\n\n\u064a\u0627 ya or \u064a\u0627 \u064a\u0627 ya-ya 'whether\u2014or?'

The preparation of this Essay was suggested to him by the Honorary Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, Dr. R. N. Cust, who thought that Dr. Ernest Trumpp\u2019s valuable German Monograph\u00b2 should receive adequate notice in this Journal. He had himself supplied Dr. Trumpp with all the material for the monograph, having obtained the data from Missionaries and from Sir William Merewether. In endeavouring to put this plan into execution, the writer found that a Paper on such a subject as this, to be of any value, must deal with details of every part of the Grammar, and could not therefore be restricted to a few pages.\n\nThis Paper is not a mere translation, but rather an abbreviated adaptation of Dr. Trumpp\u2019s \u201cGrammatische Untersuchungen,\u201d and of the other Brahui authorities, for the assistance of the English student, who looks for something like a short grammatical compilation on the Brahui Language. Such a work at the present time may prove of special usefulness, as the language is scarcely known. It will be understood that all the comments and criticisms on preceding writers are Trumpp\u2019s, and that the Examples, etc., with their translations, are quoted unaltered.\n\nIf, aided by such slender linguistic knowledge as he may possess, the writer should in any degree have succeeded in his task, notwithstanding many shortcomings and imperfections, the labour which he has spent on it will have ample reward.\n\nTHEODORE DUKA.\n\n55, NEVERN SQUARE,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON, S.W.\n\n16th Nov. 1886.\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Trumpp places the accent on all the vowels and writes thus: Br\u0101h\u016bi. Maulawi Alla Baksh uses none.\n\u00b2 See: Sitzungsberichte der k. b. Akademie der Wissenschaften zu M\u00fcnchen. 1880, Supplement\u2014Heft vi. bei G. Franz.\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n1.

IV.\u2014Hints to Oriental Students: No. 1.\u00b9 Some Useful Hindi Books. By G. A. Grierson, M.R.A.S., Bengal Civil Service.\n\nIt has often struck me how helpless European students are when they are in search of books published in India. These books are so cheap, and their demand in Europe is so limited, that it does not pay Indian publishers to have agents for their sale here. In addition to this, students have no means of knowing what works are published in India; and even if they knew their names, that is no criterion of the value of their contents. I therefore put down the following notes regarding books which I myself have found useful in studying Hind\u012b, in the hope that they may be acceptable to my fellow students.\n\nMunsh\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101 L\u0101l, Deputy Inspector of Schools, Gay\u0101, has long been known as the author of several excellent educational works. His best work is a Hind\u012b Dictionary, with explanations in that language, which I have often found very helpful. It is not scientifically accurate, but it is valuable as containing a good native scholar\u2019s explanations of difficult vernacular words. The first edition is out of print, but a second was in preparation when I was leaving India a year and a half ago. Amongst his educational works may be mentioned his Hind\u012b Kit\u0101b, also called Bh\u0101kh\u0101 B\u014ddhini, in four parts, of which the first, second and fourth are published. To the European student they will be found a useful set of Hind\u012b reading-books. The first is very elementary, consisting of short sentences and verses. The latter, being in a\n\n\u00b9 It is hoped that this will be but the forerunner of many similar papers from other correspondents, bearing upon the study of Asiatic Languages and Dialects, in and out of India.\n\n\u00b2 This address will find him, if he is written to. So for the other names subsequently given. As a rule, in India, authors sell their own books.\ncolloquial style, would probably be found difficult by the unassisted European student. The prose, however, is easy, and could readily be made out with the help of a good grammar and dictionary. Part II. consists principally of fables in easy narrative prose. Part IV. is adapted for more advanced students, and is well worth their attention. It is principally an anthology from the works of the best Hindi poets. Sanskrit scholars will recognize in the first part an ingenious adaptation of a portion of the first book of the Hitopad\u0113\u00e7a, containing some Kundaliy\u0101s, by the well-known Gir'dhar the Kabir\u0101j (or poet laureate). The prices of the three parts are as follows: Part I., 1\u00bd annas (say 2\u00bdd.); Part II., 3 annas (say 4\u00bdd.); Part IV., 10 annas (say 1s. 3d.).\n\nAnother well-known writer of educational works is P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit Bih\u0101r\u012b L\u0101l Chaub\u0113, 2nd Sanskrit Teacher at Patna College, Bankipore. His Bh\u0101kh\u0101 B\u014ddh is very popular and deservedly so. It is well printed on very fair paper, and the four parts form an excellent series of readers for European students. The latter part of Part IV. consists of selections from various poets' works, which will be found very useful. The prices of the four parts are as follows: Parts I. and II. 1\u00bd annas (say 2\u00bdd.); Part III. 2 annas (say 3d.); Part IV. 4\u00bd annas (say 7\u00bdd.). Patra B\u014ddh, another work by the same author, is a polite letter-writer in Hindi, and should be studied by any one who has to correspond with natives in the vernacular. No people are more particular about the ceremonial beginnings and endings of letters than Hind\u016bs. Its price is 1\u00bd annas (say 2\u00bdd.). The best work by this author is the Bih\u0101r\u012b-Tu'l-si-Bhukhan-B\u014ddh (price 12 annas, say 1s. 6d.), which is a valuable treatise on Hindi rhetoric and poetical conceits, founded on the S\u0101hitya Darpa\u1e47a, with hundreds of examples drawn from all the great vernacular poets. It is a work of considerable research, and is admirably suited to advanced students.\n\nI should advise persons in want of Hindi books to put\n\n---\n\n1 Not 'Doctor of Medicine' as the Saturday Review maintained when it reviewed a translation of one of this poet's sonnets.\nthemselves in communication with B\u0101b\u016b Sahib Prasad Sinha, Khadgbilas Press, Bankipore (Patna). This gentleman, and his partner B\u0101b\u016b Ram Din Sinha, are extensive publishers, and can direct the inquirer as to the most likely places for finding printed books. Amongst books published by this firm, I may mention the Kshatriya Patrika, a monthly magazine in Hindi, containing a great deal of original matter by writers of repute. It often contains instructive articles on the Hindi language, and not seldom is very pugnacious on the subject. The subscription to this magazine is Rs. 6 as. 6 per annum. Those who wish to familiarize themselves with the Kaithi character, now much used in Bih\u0101r, cannot do better than buy the Sut\u0101-Prab\u014ddh (price 4 annas, say 6d.), published by the same. It is a reading-book for girls, in simple Hindi. I would also draw particular attention to a work entitled Bh\u0101kh\u0101 S\u0101r (Part II.), which comes from these publishers. In my opinion it is the best Hindi reader for advanced students extant. Besides the usual and proper extracts from the Pr\u0113m S\u0101gar and the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47 of Tul'si D\u0101s, it contains selections from the writings of nearly all the best modern Hindi writers. Chief among the authors laid under tribute is Harishchandra, whose late lamented death at an early age has been a severe blow to the progress of Hindi literature. Amongst writings by him here given may be mentioned extracts from the History of K\u0101shmir (K\u0101shmir Kusum), founded principally on the R\u0101ja Tarangi\u1e47\u012b, the History of Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the Nil D\u0113vi (a play, in which the language and customs of Musalm\u0101ns and Hind\u016bs are well contrasted), and the P\u016br\u1e47a-Prak\u0101sh-Chandra-Prabh\u0101 (a well-known and much-admired novel). Harishchandra's unique and most valuable essay, entitled Hindi Bh\u0101kh\u0101, on the different dialects of Hindi known to him, is given in full. In this essay, after a note on the various dialects current in the city of Ban\u0101ras, including that of the thieves, he gives samples of a great\n\n1 I should mention that many of the above books can also be had in the Kaithi character.\nnumber of local dialects and of various local songs sung to peculiar melodies, with the legends connected with them. He shows how utterly unsuited modern Hind\u012b is for poetry, and vindicates triumphantly the claim of poets to write in their own dialects, till something better is produced as a standard. He then gives examples of the modern style of prose Hind\u012b, written and spoken. Of this he describes six kinds: 1) that full of pure Sanskrit words; 2) that containing a few Sanskrit words; 3) that containing no Sanskrit, and only pure Prakrit words; 4) that in which words from foreign languages are admitted; 5) that which is full of Persian words; and 6) that which admits English words. He states that he himself prefers the second and third styles, and I fancy that in this every European scholar will agree with him. It will be observed that he calls all these, even the fifth style, Hind\u012b. As will be seen hereafter, amongst natives, the true criterion between Hind\u012b and \u016ard\u016b is not vocabulary, but idiom and order of words. I may add that the sixth style is that in general use at the present day amongst educated Hind\u016bs of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. English words are used much as the words \u2018jockey\u2019 or \u2018a shake-hands\u2019 are used in French. After some examples of the bad Hind\u012b used in various localities, he winds up this part of his essay, in a grim humour, with samples of three new kinds of Hind\u012b, the Hind\u012b of the Beng\u0101l\u012b B\u0101b\u016b, the Hind\u012b of the English S\u0101hib, and the Hind\u012b of the railway companies. In these, the first two especially, the faults of the nationalities of the speakers are most cleverly hit off. The essay concludes with specimens of the writings of English Hind\u012b scholars. Foremost honour is given to the Christian hymns by Mr. John Christian, lately deceased, J\u0101n S\u0101hib, as he is affectionately called by the natives. He is the only European I have ever met who has achieved any success as a Hind\u012b writer; and the best native scholars admit that many of his hymns are faultless compositions so far as their language goes. Natives of India much admire his works, and they have had a strange fate, for, in addition to being put to their legitimate purposes, they are sung by n\u0101ch girls all over Bih\u0101r, together with\nVaishnava songs of Bidy\u0101pati and S\u016br D\u0101s. The expressions in the songs are so truly native, and Mr. Christian has so cleverly caught the style of these old masters, that these girls have no idea that they are singing Christian hymns.\n\nThere are also given copies of letters in Hind\u012b, written in England to Native friends in India, by Messrs. Nicholl and Pincott. I suspect that they were hardly intended for publication. I say this, judging from their contents, and not from the Hind\u012b style, which, it is needless to say, I do not criticize here.\n\nThe book also contains the well-known \"Kah\u0101ni Th\u0113nth Hind\u012b m\u0113n\" (Tales in pure Hind\u012b), which should be studied by every European student for two purposes: firstly, to master its wonderfully pure vernacular vocabulary; and secondly, to learn what is not Hind\u012b. This set of stories is a veritable lusus naturae. It contains only the purest Hind\u012b vocabulary, i.e. words derived only from Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit sources; not a single Arabic or Persian word finds entrance into it, and yet it is not Hind\u012b, but \u016ard\u016b. The work is continually referred to by native Hind\u012b scholars as showing how impossible it is for a Musalm\u0101n (for such was its author) to write in that language, and the very first sentence, sir jhuk\u0101 kar n\u0101k ragar't\u0101 h\u016bn us ap'n\u0113 banan\u0113val\u0113 k\u0113 s\u0101mk'ne, 'bowing my head, I show my humility before my Creator,' is often quoted for that purpose. Here the verb is in the middle of the sentence; and in Hindi narrative prose it must come at the end. The quotation, in spite of its vocabulary, is very good \u016ard\u016b, but it is very bad Hind\u012b.\n\nThe Kah\u0101ni Th\u0113nth Hind\u012b m\u0113n is followed by an appropriate antidote, extracts from the elegant R\u0101m-Kath\u0101 of Pandit Chh\u014d\u1e6d\u016b R\u0101m Tiw\u0101r\u012b, Professor of Sanskrit at Patn\u0101 College. In this work the old familiar story of R\u0101m is told again in mingled prose and verse. It is universally recognized as a model of pure Hind\u012b, written in a flowing and not too learned style. So highly appreciated is the book, and so great was the demand for it, that I believe there was actually a large sale of the proof-sheets before it could be completely printed off.\nSelections from Bait\u0101l, Kab\u012br, and other poets make up this really excellent reading-book. I hope that a new edition will soon be called for, and that, encouraged by the sale of the first, the publishers may see their way to printing it with better type, on better paper.\n\nA member of the same firm, B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101m Din Singh, published a useful Bh\u0101kh\u0101 By\u0101karan, a work written by Gir\u2019dhar D\u0101s, the father of Harishchandra. It is the only native work which deals with the grammar of Tul\u2019s\u012b Das, and is well worthy of attention. I have myself found it very useful. To the European student, its style may be found difficult, as it is written in verse. As at present published, it only goes down to the end of nouns. I hope the rest will soon be published. It is printed by Pandit K\u0101l\u012b Pras\u0101d Tiw\u0101r\u012b, at the Dharm Prak\u0101\u015b Press, Bankipore (Patna), and its price is one anna (say 1\u00bdd.).\n\nThe D\u0113v\u0101kshara-Charitra, printed at the Light Press, Ban\u0101ras, by Gopeenath Pathak, and priced at 3 annas (say 4\u00bdd.), is a \u201cSerio-comic Drama,\u201d by Pandit Ravidatta \u0160ukla. It is a play with a purpose, which is to show the tyranny the mass of the people groan under, owing to the use of the Persian character and \u016ard\u016b language, which none of them can understand. The play is based on a number of absurd mistakes made by persons endeavouring to act on Government orders written in an illegible Persian character. It concludes with a prayer for the introduction into Government offices of the D\u0113van\u0101gar\u012b character, and of a language \u201cunderstood of the people.\u201d To the European student the work is principally valuable for the examples of the Bhoj\u2019p\u016br\u012b dialect scattered through its pages, and for the imitation of the faults in Hind\u012b speaking, which are made by Englishmen in office.\n\nA favourite trial of skill amongst native scholars is for one to give another a part of a stanza, which the other has at once to weave into a short impromptu poem. The portion of stanza used as a text is called in Hind\u012b samasy\u0101 or (sic) samatsy\u0101, and the performance of the challenge, samasy\u0101-p\u016brti or samatsy\u0101-p\u016brti. The Samatsy\u0101-p\u016brti-pachisi (price\n1 anna, say 1\u00bdd.), by Pandit K\u0101li Pras\u0101d Tiw\u0101r\u012b already mentioned, may be interesting as a curiosity of this description. It contains twenty-five of these ingenious impromptu verses by the author. I may add that he has also written an excellent Bh\u0101kh\u0101 R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47 in prose and verse, which adds one more to the many versions of the life of R\u0101m.\n\nIn a future paper, I propose to deal especially with some of the works of B\u0101b\u016b Harischandra previously spoken of.\nArt. V.\u2014Original Vocabularies of Five West Caucasian Languages. Compiled on the spot by Mr. Peacock, Vice-Consul of Bat\u00fam, Trans-Caucasia, South Russia, at the request of, and communicated by, Dr. R. N. Cust, Hon. Sec. R.A.S., with a Note.\n\nWhen I visited Trans-Caucasia in 1882 for the purpose of collecting information regarding the Languages of the Caucasus, the result of which was published in Vol. XVII. of the Journal, I became aware of the scantiness of the Vocabularies, and I mentioned this to Mr. Peacock, the Vice-Consul of H.B.M. at Bat\u00fam, who had resided some time at Poti, and had made excursions into regions not often traversed. He was good enough to undertake the duty of collecting Vocabularies, and I forwarded to him a copy of the Standard Form of Words and Sentences prepared by the Bengal Asiatic Society. After some delay, owing to the heavy press of his official duties, and a visit to England, when I had the pleasure of seeing him, and again encouraging him on the subject, he has forwarded to me the subjoined Vocabularies, which are highly important.\n\nRobert N.

Each sheet contains Five Languages, and those Languages should be selected for each sheet which are cognate to each other. When the whole is completed and printed, it becomes the basis for a further advance as regards those Languages of which we have no Grammars or Vocabularies. Care should be taken that all loan-words from English, Arabic, Portuguese, etc., are excluded. Only the pure words of each language should be used. One system of transliteration should be adopted: the best is that of Lepsius; but at any rate one system only should be adopted for Languages entered upon the same sheet; and when Lepsius' system is not adopted, explanatory notes should be added, giving the exact value of each symbol, letter, or diacritical mark employed.\n| English  | Georgian | Mingrelian     | Laz  | Swanetian   | Abkhazian |\n|---------|----------|---------------|------|-------------|-----------|\n| One     | Erti     | Arti          | Ar   | Eshkhvi     | Ak\u00e9       |\n| Two     | Ori      | Jiri          | J\u00fcr  | Yervi       | Ubha      |\n| Three   | Sami     | Sumi          | Sum  | Semi        | Khpa      |\n| Four    | Otkhi    | Otkhi         | Otkhu| Voshtkhv    | Tshba     |\n| Five    | Khuti    | Khuti         | Khut | Vokhvishd   | Kpa       |\n| Six     | Efksi    | Amshvi        | Ashi | Usgya       | Fba       |\n| Seven   | Shvidi   | Shvitki       | Shkit| Tshgvrid    | Bjba      |\n| Eight   | Rva      | Rua           | Orvo | Ara         | Ahba      |\n| Nine    | Tsikhra  | Tchkhero      | Tchkholo | Tchkhara | Iba       |\n| Ten     | Ati      | Wetti         | Vit  | Eshd        | Iaba      |\n| Twenty  | Otsi     | Etchi         | Etchi| Yarveshd    | Waja      |\n| Fifty   | Ormotsi da ati | Jarnetchi da wetty | Jurnetchi da vit | Vokhvishdeshd | Uneujajaba |\n| Hundred | Assi     | Oshi          | Oshi | Ashir       | Shke      |\n| I       | Me       | Ma            | Ma   | Mi          | Sara      |\n| Of me   | Tchemgan | Tchkimisheni  | Tchkimda| Mishgvaji | Saraspe   |\n| Mine    | Tchemi   | Tchkim        | Tchkimiran| Mishgvi   | Siepu     |\n| We      | Tchven   | Tkwa          | Tchku | Na         | Khara     |\n| Of us   | Tchvengan| Ettinas       | Tchkunda   | Nishgveji | Kharakhkant |\n| Our     | Tchveni  | Tchkhimi      | Tchkuniran | Nishgve | Kharakhpu |\n| Thou    | Shen     | Si            | Si    | Si          | Wuara     |\n| Of thee | Shengan | Tkwa          | Skandan    | Isgvaji    | Orokuant  |\n| Thine   | Sheni    | Tkwan         | Skani   | Isgvi       | Wuarayupu |\n| You     | Tkven    | Tkwa          | Tkwa   | Sga         | Sh\u00e9ra     |\n| Of you  | Tkvengan | Tchuende      | Tkwandan  | Isgveji     | Sherashkant |\n| Your    | Tkveni   | Skani         | Skani   | Isgve       | Sherashpu |\n| He      | Ts       | Tishi         | Kiamushiron | Adja     | Abant     |\n| English | Mingrelian | Laz | Swanetian | Abkhazian |\n|---------|------------|-----|-----------|----------|\n| Of him  | Misgan     | Tinepiache | Hetepebia | Etoheji |\n| His     | Missi      | Tineops    | Hemushian | Achasch |\n| They    | Taemini    | Atemps     | Hemtepe   | Adjiar  |\n| Of them | Madgan     | Tinepishe  | Hemteps   | Adjiarga |\n| Their   | Mati       | Tishe      | Hemtepebia| Adjiersh |\n| Hand    | Kheli      | Khe        | Khe       | Tvet-shi |\n| Foot    | Pekhi      | Kutikhke   | Kutohkhe  | Tchishkh |\n| Nose    | Takhviri   | Tekhkhindi | Nafkhvna  | Apindas |\n| Eye     | Tyali      | Toli       | Toli      | Ala     |\n| Mouth   | Kharkha    | Pidji      | Nuku      | Atchi   |\n| Tooth   | Kibili     | Kibiri     | Kibiri    | Khapits |\n| Ear     | Kuri       | Aldji      | Udji      | Shitig  |\n| Hair    | Tma        | Tuma       | Toma      | Shitish |\n| Head    | Tavi       | Didi       | Ti        | Paty    |\n| Tongue  | Ena        | Nina       | Nena      | Tkhlviash |\n| Baby    | Metseli    | Kwara      | Kolba     | Nin     |\n| Back    | Zurghi     | Ochishti   | Bhka      | Khad    |\n| Iron    | Rkina      | Rkina      | Demiri    | Kintokhh |\n| Gold    | Okro       | Okro       | Altuni    | Beroj   |\n| Silver  | Vertakhli  | Vartokkheli| Ghemiish  | Yokor   |\n| Father  | Mama       | Muma       | Baba      | Vortekhhil-Tskilian |\n| Mother  | Deda       | Dida       | Nana      | Arezn   |\n| Brother | Zma        | Djima      | Nana      | Mu      |\n| Sister  | Da         | Da         | An        | Di-Dia  |\n| Man     | Katai      | Kotch      | Anwe      | Aaha    |\n\nOrokuant (?)

REPORTS OF MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY, SESSION 1886\u201387.\n\nFirst Meeting, 15th November, 1886.\u2014Col. H. Yule, R.E., C.B., President, in the Chair.\n\nElections: Louisa, Lady Goldsmid and Surgeon-Major John Anderson, M.D., C.I.E., as Resident Members; Messrs. J. H. Barber, S. M. Burrows, J. K. Birch, Charles A. Cookson, C.B., Hector Van Cuylenberg, Jai Singh Rao Angria, K. Raganathji, C. Venketramana Naidu, J. D. Rees, and G. Stack, as Non-Resident Members.\n\nThe following paper was read by the author: The Present State of Education in Egypt, by Mr. H. B. Cunynghame. Starting with the proposition that those who would understand the condition of Muhammadan thought at the present day should revert to the ideas prevalent in Europe before the Renaissance, the lecturer proceeded to relate the results of a personal inspection of Cairo schools, and gave many interesting details illustrative of a system opposed to Western civilization. After treating of defects and shortcomings, he turned to the more favourable side of the question and said, in conclusion, that while Egyptians had much to learn in the matter\n\n1 Although arrangements are still incomplete for fitting organizing the department of the Journal under the above head, the Secretary has gratefully to acknowledge the promise of assistance received in several quarters to enable him to improve the character of the \"Notes,\" and render them a useful reference to Oriental scholars and students. In furtherance of this last-mentioned object, communications from kindred Societies and Institutions (at home and abroad) that may wish to see their Proceedings summarized and Journals analyzed, or from publishers who may desire to have catalogued or otherwise noticed their latest published works, will meet with ready attention, if sent to the Royal Asiatic Society's rooms in Albemarle Street.\nof education, they had lately been making efforts which deserved the highest encouragement. In the face of a deficient revenue, they had to contend with religious prejudice, the enmity of the University, and the interference of foreign powers. Fortunately, the immediate supervision of education in Egypt was now in the hands of Yu'kub Artin Pasha, a most highly cultivated minister, well acquainted with European education. Keen to seize new ideas and yet cautious in applying them, the schools, under his hands, were being slowly moulded into shape, and bid fair in time to become really satisfactory.\n\nNo discussion followed; but thanks were given to Mr. Cunynghame for his interesting paper, which will be printed in extenso in the April number of the Journal.\n\nIt was notified that the next Meeting would take place on the 20th December.\n\nII. PROCEEDINGS OF ASIATIC OR ORIENTAL SOCIETIES.\n\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, 5th May, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President, in the chair.\n\nSeventeen presentations were announced, two Ordinary Members elected, four candidates proposed for election, and two withdrawals notified.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read a report by Dr. Hoernle on an ornament of ancient gold coins found in the Maniky\u00e1la Tope, and forwarded by the Deputy-Commissioner of R\u00e1wal Pindi. This discovery had formed the subject of \"conversation\" in the Numismatic Department announced in the Proceedings for April. The description of it as a \"necklet\" was considered of doubtful accuracy. It has rather the appearance of an \"armlet,\" worn on the upper arm; but the identification of the coins as belonging, three to Antoninus Pius and two to his wife Faustina, was confirmed. At Dr. Hoernle's suggestion, the ornament has been deposited in the Imperial Museum in Calcutta. After the disposal of papers in the Natural History Department, and a discussion on Silkworms, Mr. Barton Grove exhibited four illustrated MSS. from the Palace at Mandalay. The last of these, a bark manuscript in ill-spelt Sanskrit, was accompanied by an explanatory note of Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1lu Mitra.\n\n2nd June, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., in the chair.\n\nTwelve presentations were announced; the election of four\nOrdinary Members and two withdrawals notified; and one candidate for election proposed.\n\nOne gold and two silver coins found at Bijap\u00far, and copper coins from Oudh, were exhibited; and a report was read by the Philological Secretary on a find of 22 old silver coins in the Jalandhar District. The first were of Aurangzib and Shah Jahan, and the last all round rupees of Akbar.\n\nAmong the papers read was one by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra \"On the Derivation and Meaning of the Buddhist term Ekotibh\u00e1va\"; one \"On the M\u00edn\u00e1 Tribe of Jaipur in Mewar,\" by Kavir\u00e1j Shy\u00e1m\u00e1l D\u00e1s; and one \"On Coins supplementary to Thomas's Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Dehli.\" The second of these was the chosen subject of conversation in the Philological Secretary's Department.\n\n7th July, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., in the chair.\n\nTwenty-seven presentations were announced; the election of one Ordinary Member and one withdrawal notified; and two candidates for election proposed.\n\nTwo silver coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Hissar were exhibited; and two reports, one on 12 silver coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Hoshiarpur, and one on 69 coins and a silver chain from the Deputy Commissioner of Montgomery, were read by the Philological Secretary. Some Japanese Magic Mirrors were shown, and their character and uses explained by Babu P. Ghosha; and the two following papers were read:\n\n1. Note on some of the symbols on the coins of Kunanda; by W. Theobald, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\n2. Remarks on an Inscription of Mahendrap\u00e1la Deva of Kanauj; by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra.\n\nStraits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Singap\u00far, 16th January, 1886.\u2014W. A. Pickering, Esq., C.M.G., Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nThe Report of the Council for 1885 was read; the Honorary Treasurer's accounts were passed; the officers for 1886 and two new Members were elected. For the Presidential chair the choice of the Society fell upon the Hon. J. F. Dickson, C.M.G.\n\nAmong other matters of interest noted in the Report, it was stated that two volumes of Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China and the Malay Peninsula, edited for the Society by Dr. Rost, were completed and approaching publication; and that it was proposed to continue the series by publishing two more volumes in the course of the year. A grant of 500 dollars in aid\nof the work had been promised by the Local Government. The preparation of a Statistical Gazetteer for the Colony was, moreover, suggested, to supply an evident want. Reference was made to a serial paper which had appeared in the Journal under the head of \"Notes and Queries,\" and the continuance of which it was hoped to facilitate by an accession of new contributions and correspondents.\n\nChina Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Shanghai, 26th May, 1886.\u2014Dr. R. A. Jamieson, Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nIt was announced that seventeen Ordinary Members had been elected since the last previous meeting; and that the Rev. Angelo Zottoli, of the Jesuit Mission, Sienwei, had, in consideration of his distinguished service as a Sinologist, been made an Honorary Member. Regret was expressed at the loss to the Society, by death, of Count Kleczkowski and Mr. Scherzer, both eminent Chinese scholars.\n\nThe Chairman adverted to a project that had been started for securing a complete chronological and representative series of Chinese art specimens in porcelain and bronze, especially the former, and invited Members to give their views on the subject. A certain sum would be necessary to commence with\u2014perhaps $1000\u2014but something might be done with half that amount, and one gentleman offered $50 if nine others would follow his example. Mr. Kingsmill approved the suggestion, and thought it quite possible that if the Council could show that the community was prepared to erect a substantial addition to the existing Museum, the British Government might listen to proposals regarding the site. A committee of five gentlemen was appointed to consider the question.\n\nFourteen papers, contributed to the \"Symposium,\" were more or less lengthily noticed, though treated mainly in a collective sense, by Messrs. Kingsmill and Playfair and the Rev. Y. K. Yeung, but as these form the first article in the Society's Journal, they will be alluded to under another head.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, Paris, 18th June, 1886.\u2014M. Ernest Renan, President, in the chair.\n\nAfter the election of three new Members and ordinary business, the President announced that, owing to the Secretary's absence in India, the Annual Report for 1885 would appear in conjunction with that of 1886. Mr. Rubens Duval read a portion of the Preface to his edition of the Syriac Dictionary of Bar Bahlul, no\nin the press of the \"Imprimerie Nationale.\" M. Clermont-Ganneau read a paper on the words \"Mane, Thecel, Phares\" (noticed among the contents of the Journal). The Abb\u00e9 Quentin, after explaining to the Society his views on the Assyrian Inscriptions he had recently inspected at the British Museum, read a paper on his translation of an unpublished inscription of Assurbanipal. This would appear in a future number.\n\nIII. CORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. The Persian for Rouble.\n\nLONDON, 30th September, 1886.\n\nSIR,\n\nWill it be of interest to any of our readers to be informed that the \"Persian name for a rouble,\" the word \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a, mentioned in Vol. XVIII. p. 465 of our Journal, is really not Persian, but Russian, and means money, coin, not \"rouble,\" in Russian. The word is \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 (moneta), which the Persians have made into \"\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442.\" A paper rouble is not \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 in Russian, and even the \"silver rouble\" is called on the coin itself \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c (a cash rouble).\n\nYours, etc.\nJ. W. REDHOUSE.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n2. The \"Farhang Jahangiri.\"\n\nLONDON, 1st October, 1886.\n\nSIR,\n\nThe mention of the \"Farhang Jahangiri\" (read Ferhengi Jih\u0101ng\u012br\u012b) in p. 325 of the July Number of our Journal gives no details; and, consequently, the inclosed extract from that work, text and translation, with a few notes, may be suitable for the \"Correspondence\" section of the next Part. I submit the same, hoping it may prove of interest.\n\nThe Jih\u0101ng\u012br\u012b was written in the latter part of Ekber's reign, but not being quite ready by his death, was dedicated to his son and successor Selim Jih\u0101ng\u012br, after whom it was named.\n\nYours, etc.\nJ. W. REDHOUSE.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\nThe Red Idol and the White Idol.\u2014These are two idols which the syntheists have hewn out of the rock and raised in relief out of the mountain, in the time of Ignorance, in the locality of B\u0101miy\u0101n, of the dependencies of K\u0101bul, which is on the frontier of Badakhsh\u0101n, and which they worshipped. In Arabic they are called Ya\u02bf\u016bq and Yag\u016bth; some have said Men\u0101t and L\u0101t.\n\nNear those two effigies is another effigy in the form of an old woman, smaller than those two effigies, the name of which is Neerem, though some say Nestw\u0101.\n\nThese effigies are among the wonders and curiosities of the world; for the height of each of them is fifty-two cubits. The interior of these effigies is hollow, so that there is a way from the soles of their feet. And they have formed the steps of a staircase, by which one can pass through all the cavities of them, to the tips of their fingers and toes.\n\nIn some dictionaries it is said that the Red Idol was the lover of the White Idol.\n\nNotes.\n\nBy \u201cRed Idol\u201d may probably have been originally meant the Golden or Gilt Idol, since gold is commonly called Zeri Surkh \u2018red gold\u2019 in Persian.\nThe \"White Idol\" may then have been overlaid with silver or some other white metal.\n\nThe Arabic names are of course a mere supposition, dating from the times of Isl\u0101m.\n\nThe smaller \"old woman\" effigy is perhaps what is now called the \"baby.\" What its names of \"Nesrem\" or \"Nestw\u0101\" may be is an enigma for scholarly solution.\n\n\"Fifty-two cubits\" is a very vague measurement, as the cubit is, and always has been, of several lengths. Probably cubits could be suggested, fifty-two of which would make 173 feet and 120 feet respectively. But legendary Oriental measurements must not be too critically examined.\n\nThe \"staircase\" turns out true; but not so the detail as to all parts of the effigies being reachable \"to the tips of their fingers and toes.\"\n\nN.B.\u2014The above two letters were received too late for insertion in the October Number.\n\nAccompanying a letter dated Tehr\u00e1n, 27th October, Mr. Sidney Churchill has kindly favoured the Secretary with the following:\n\n3. Note on \"A Modern Contributor to Persian Literature. Rez\u0101 Qul\u012b Khan and his Works.\"\n\nSince writing the above (vide Vol. XVIII. Part II. p. 196) I have secured two of Rez\u0101 Qul\u012b Kh\u00e1n's works mentioned by me, but which I had not yet seen. The one is a D\u00edv\u00e1n, consisting of a collection of ghazels, qat'ahs, tarj'bands and rub\u00e1'is; altogether about 12,000 distichs, beginning:\n\n\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u062f \u062a\u0648 \u062f\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u06cc\u062f\u0627\n\u0648\u06cc \u0648\u0635\u0644 \u062a\u0648 \u0646\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0631\u0632 \u0639\u0646\u0642\u0627\n\nThis MS. is now in the British Museum.\n\nThe other MS. is entitled \"Mift\u00e1h ul-Kun\u00faz\" (vide Schefer, Chrestomathie Persane, vii. p. 79, note 2).

This volume is concerned with the description of the towns, villages, and notabilia connected with them, which are passed on the road from Meshhed to Tehran. In it, moreover, has been inserted a valuable note of a score of pages or more on Nishapur, by General Schindler, the well-known authority on Persian geography. Nearly all the inscriptions to be met with along the road have been noted and given by the San' ud-Dauleh. The text is very clearly lithographed. This same distinguished author has begun in the Court Journal, as a feuilleton, another of his important geographical memoirs. Up till now he had published a memoir on Talaqan by himself; an anonymous history of Sistan; and a memoir on Isfahan by Aga Muhammed Mehd\u00ed, Arb\u00e1b, Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed: now he has commenced a memoir on the District of Nur of the Province of Mazander\u00e1n.\n\n4. The Idols of Bamian.\n\nNovember, 1886.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose an extract from a book published about a quarter of a century ago\u00b9 by Messrs. Smith and Elder, Cornhill, which may be interesting to the readers of the Asiatic Society's Journal. Though it may not throw any new light on the subject so exhaustively treated in the leading paper of the July Number, a comparison of it with that article will, perhaps, tend to show that the volume from which it has been taken is authentic.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nALFRED HAGGARD.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n\"Between Afghanistan and Balkh, about six miles from Bameean, is the city of Gulguleh (City of Confusion). It was the town of Jellaladeen, a great king who lived eight hundred years ago, and was also the founder of Jellalabad.\n\n\"In Bameean I saw the great images of Subsal and Shamona, otherwise called Surkbut and Konuckbut, or, in Arabic, Yaouck and Yasouck (sic). These figures are supposed to represent the first\n\n\u00b9 \"Lost among the Afghans,\" being the adventures of John Campbell (otherwise Faringhee Basha) amongst the wild tribes of Central Asia.

We could see their immense forms from a great distance, and all the horses shied on approaching them.\n\n\"When we arrived close to them, we were all looking up, bewildered by the amazing height, and I proposed that some one should climb up and get on the head of one of them. The soldiers declared that it would be impossible; but I said, 'If you give me some money, I will do it.'\n\n\"They dared me to fulfil my promise, and offered me a small sum from each one of them if I should succeed in performing the feat; but they made me sign a paper to say that if I perished by my temerity they were not guilty of my blood.\n\n\"I went to a cave, where was a poor woman, and asked her to show me the way up. The images are placed in enormous niches made for them in the face of the rock which shelters them, and between them is the entrance to the cave. The woman lighted a candle, so we entered the narrow cavern, and began ascending some steps. We were an immense time going up, but at last we came out opposite the shoulders of the image on the inside of the niche.\n\n\"I was within reasonable jumping distance to get on to the shoulder of the figure, but oh! the thought of missing my foot made me shudder! I looked across at the image and down far below me at the army, the soldiers looking like little children playing beneath me. If I slipped I must inevitably be dashed to pieces.\n\n\"It was a fearful thing to do. I shut my eyes and took the leap, and in a moment was clinging with a beating heart on the broad shoulder of the image. I walked across to the opposite shoulder and all the people shouted and clapped their hands from below me. Then came the return. I had fulfilled my promise, and did not care to risk my life for nothing. So I told the woman to bring a rope, one end of which she flung across to me and I made it fast on the image; she secured the other end on the rock, and I soon got safely back into the cave. I ran down the steps and hastened to collect my money from the soldiers, and altogether it amounted to a considerable sum.\"\u2014pp. 108 and 110\u2013112.\n5.

A reference to the Journal of the Society of Arts, vol. xxviii. p. 791, and to the Academy of November 6th, 1886, p. 313, will show that several scholars have brought forward, before him, the theory which he advances; and\n\n2.

Obituary Notices.\n\nDuring the past quarter the Society has had to regret the loss of one of its lately-named Vice-Presidents, James Gibbs, Esq., of H.M. Bombay Civil Service, a Companion of the Star of India and Indian Empire, and late Senior Member of the Viceroy's Council in India.\n\nMr. Gibbs entered the service of the Hon. East India Company on the 7th December, 1846, but, within a year after his arrival in Bombay, was obliged to return to England on medical certificate for two years. Again landing in India in 1850, he passed examinations in the native languages, and was appointed Assistant Judge and Sessions Judge at Surat in April, 1851. During the month of November of the following year he was appointed Senior Assistant Judge and Sessions Judge at the detached station of Broach, and, in December, 1853, Judicial Assistant to the Commissioner in Sind, then the lamented Sir Bartle Frere. In 1855, on the departure of Mr. (now Sir Barrow) Ellis, Mr. Gibbs received charge of the office of Political Assistant to the Commissioner, and from that period continued to perform the work which it entailed, in addition to that of Judicial Assistant. Throughout the Mutinies of 1857-58, he assisted Sir Bartle Frere in those exceptional and highly important duties which the circumstances of the day threw upon that distinguished statesman. At the close of the said crucial epoch in 1859, Mr. Gibbs was appointed, under a special Commission, to try rebel chiefs of the Nagar P\u00e1rkar districts for high treason, being invested with extraordinary powers to pass such sentences as he might consider necessary, without previous reference; and the \"great care and intelligence\" shown by him in the conduct of the\ntrial were acknowledged in a Resolution of the Bombay Government approving the sentences so passed.\n\nMr. Gibbs remained in Sind until September, 1860, when he was ordered to the Presidency on special duty connected with the Income Tax Act, then just passed through the Legislative Council of India. First appointed Special Commissioner, he subsequently became President of the Commission and Collector of the Tax; thus having, for the town and island of Bombay, the entire management of that unpopular measure. He took leave to England in 1862, and while on furlough was called to the Bar by the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. On return to India in January, 1865, after resuming for a few weeks his former duties, and acting as Collector of Bombay, he was appointed Judge of P\u00fana and Agent for the Governor for the Sirdars in the Dakhan. These appointments he held until the beginning of 1866, when, having been named by her Majesty one of the Judges of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, he left P\u00fana for the Presidency. Here he continued at his post until April, 1874, and was the first civilian judge, selected by the Chief Justice to sit on the \"Original Side\" of the Court, which represented the former \"Supreme\" or \"Queen's,\" in contradistinction to the \"Sadr\" or \"E.I. Company's Court,\" and on which up to that time, Barrister Judges alone had sat. During a year and a half he took his share with his Barrister colleagues in every branch of the duties\u2014civil, criminal, and chambers on that side of the Court, while he had already for some years presided over the insolvent business. On resigning his seat on the Bench to become a member of the Government of Bombay, he was addressed by the senior Barrister in behalf of the Bar in very complimentary terms, and also by the Native Pleaders on the Appellate Side.\n\nMr. Gibbs was from May to October, 1873, a temporary member of the Bombay Government, and in April, 1874, succeeded permanently to that office, holding charge of the Political, Judicial, and Railway Departments, and for a time that of the Public Works; he brought in and passed several important measures through the Legislative Council, including Acts for Mufassil Municipalities, Compulsory Vaccination, Jails, the amendment of the Municipality of the City of Bombay, and lastly the purchase of the entire foreshore of the island and reconstitution of the Port Trust, a measure of the greatest importance to the trade of the city. He took a prominent part in the arrangements for meeting and dealing with the famine\nin the Bombay Presidency in 1876\u201378, and in the preparation of rules which have since been approved of for future general guidance in the event of such a calamity recurring; and for the personal part he had taken in the initiation and support of these measures, he was admitted to the third class of the Order of the 'Star of India.'\n\nIn 1870 Mr. Gibbs was first appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bombay, and continued by four re-appointments to hold that office until his departure from India in 1879. On his resignation a meeting of the Fellows was held, an address voted, and a subscription for a testimonial opened, to which the public were invited to join. The fund raised has been divided to defray the cost of a bust placed in the University Library and procure a large addition to the books. In addition to this, Jahangir Cowasji Jahangir Readymoney gave Rs. 1000 to found a prize of books, value Rs. 40 every year, to be called \"The Gibbs Prize,\" at the University; while the Kach Darbar gave Rs. 2500, and the Junagarh Darbar Rs. 2000 for Vernacular Prize Essays in Mr. Gibbs's name, making a total Testimonial of Rs. 22,100, being one of the largest testimonials raised in Bombay in honour of a departing public servant. Before he resigned, Mr. Gibbs had the satisfaction of bringing the scheme for conferring degrees in science to a completion, and it received the approval of the Senate about a month after he had left India. During the last few weeks of his residence in Bombay, he received several other public recognitions of his services, and his departure was witnessed by one of the largest assemblies of Natives and Europeans assembled for such a purpose. Not a few of the former, including several Chiefs, had travelled long distances for the sole purpose of bidding him farewell.\n\nMr. Gibbs, who had returned from India in 1885, died at his London residence, after a long illness, on the 30th October, in his sixty-second year, much regretted by those who appreciated his kindliness of heart, and amiable qualities. His remains were attended to the Brompton Cemetery by many friends and old companions.\n\nArthur Grote, son of George Grote and brother of the historian, was born on the 29th November, 1814, at Beckenham in Kent. Nominated by Mr. George Lyall, Director of the East India Company, on the recommendation of Mr. James Pattison, he entered Haileybury College early in 1832, and passed out in December, 1833, as 'highly distinguished,' having obtained prizes\nin Classics, Bengali, Persian, Hindustani and Arabic. He arrived in India on the 14th June following, admitted a Writer on the Bengal establishment, and shortly afterwards was placed under the Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit in the Aligarh Division, then appointed Assistant to the Magistrate and Collector of Jessore. In 1836 he was transferred as Assistant to the Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit in Bauliah and Murshidabad respectively, exercising the power of Magistrate at Hugli. Next year he was placed in charge of the Civil and Sessions Judge\u2019s Office at Hugli; and in 1838 he conducted the duties of the Collector\u2019s Office at Midnapur, subsequently officiating as Deputy-Collector of that place and of Hijili. In 1839, appointed Superintendent of Settlement Duties at Midnapur, he conducted at the same time the duties of the Judge\u2019s Office there, and those of the Special Deputy-Collector\u2014being confirmed in the latter post (including Hijili) in 1840. Magistrate of Champaran in 1845, he proceeded to Europe on furlough in 1846, and returned to India in 1849, to be nominated Superintendent of Revenue Survey in the 24 Parganahs. In 1852 he held a similar appointment in Bhagalpur, afterwards becoming Collector of Sylhet. The following year he was made Junior Secretary, and in 1855 promoted to Senior Secretary to the Revenue Board of the Lower Provinces of Bengal. In 1857\u201361, Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit, first in the Naddia and secondly in the Chittagong Divisions, he was, in 1862, appointed a Member of the Revenue Board in the Lower Provinces of Bengal. He resigned the service in July, 1868, and became an Annuitant on the Fund.\n\nWhen in India, Mr. Grote had taken an active part in furthering the interests of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and, among other functions performed on their behalf, had occupied the President\u2019s chair for four successive years (1859\u201362), and again for one detached year (1865). On return to England, he joined the London Royal Asiatic Society, and at the period of his decease had been on its List of Members for 17 years\u2014for a great part of the time one of its Vice-Presidents or Councillors. He was, moreover, a Fellow of the Zoological Society and a contributor to its Journal; also a Fellow of the Linnaean Society. At all these, as at the Athen\u00e6um Club, his presence will be missed and loss regretted: and the\n\n---\n\n1 The above information has been, for the most part, kindly supplied by Mr. C. Prinsep, of the India Office, to whom the Journal is also indebted for the brief obituary notice of Mr. J. H. Batten in the October Number.\nnumber of mourners who attended his funeral at Kensal Green on the 9th December, bear testimony to the high esteem and regard in which his memory is held by a large circle of friends.\n\nV. Excerpta Orientalia.\n\nNo. 2 of the first part, vol. lv., Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, contains an article by Mr. E. E. Oliver on \"the decline of the S\u0101m\u0101nis and rise of the Ghaznavis in M\u00e1war\u00e1u-n-Nahr and part of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n.\" It is gratifying to find the younger officers of the Indian Government\u2014now no longer restricted to the covenanted circle\u2014devote their leisure and opportunities to the advancement of the knowledge of Indian History, not only checking dates, but creating data by the light of coins. The substantial aid supplied to the Historian by the Numismatist is well illustrated in Mr. Oliver's useful paper, prepared with evident care and industry. Mr. Whiteway's \"Place-Names in Marw\u0101ra\" is suggestive of the improvement which might be effected in our Gazetteers by the compulsory record of the meaning or origin of every name entered. Captain Tufnell, of the Madras Staff Corps, supplies the third and last article in an analysis of a collection of South Indian coins.\n\nJournal Asiatique, huiti\u00e8me s\u00e9rie, tome viii. No. 1 (Juillet-Ao\u00fbt, 1886), contains a Report of the General Meeting of the 18th June, with a list of the Society's officers and members, and the following articles:\u2014Man\u00e9, Thecel, Phar\u00e8s, et le Festin de Balthasar, in which M. Clermont-Ganneau discusses the interpretation given to the three mysterious words of the fifth chapter of Daniel; M. S\u00e9nart's continuation of his study of the Piyadasi Inscriptions; a new instalment of M. Sauvaire's materials for a history of Muhammadan Numismatics and Metrology; and the usual \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes.\" The last paper reviews at length a recent edition of the \"Po\u00e9sies Gastronomiques\" or parodies of Abu Ish\u0101q \u1e24all\u0101j Shir\u0101zi, who flourished early in the fifteenth century, and supplements the notice of the same work and the same author, which appeared some time ago in the British Museum Catalogue of Persian MSS. (vol. ii. p. 634). M. Rieu's MS. of the \u0643\u0646\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0628\u0627 \"treasure of appetite,\" is of A.D. 1685; whereas the present edition, published at Constantinople, and said to do honour to the Turkish printing press, is hailed as a sign of revival of a taste for Persian literature among Ottoman readers of the day. The editor, Mirza Habib Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed, has already attained local repute as the author of a Persian Grammar and translator of Moli\u00e8re's \"Misanthrope.\" No. 2 of the same volume of the Journal (Septembre-Octobre, 1886), besides a continuation of the respective articles of MM. S\u00e9nart and Sauvaire, and the \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes,\" has a contribution by M. Abel Bergaigne on the \"Samhita primitive du Rig Veda,\" and another by M. J.

Among these the essay on Malay Roots and the Vocabulary are of undoubted utility: the first, by Dr. Pijnappel, was read in the Polynesian Section of the Oriental Congress held at Leyden in September, 1883. \"Hua Hoey\" supplies a curious and an entertaining subject of consideration, and is illustrated with numerous drawings. Printed separately from the Journal, are \"Notes and Queries,\" edited by the Hon. Secretary. These contain Local memoranda of interest, original and selected. En passant, some kind of answer may be given to the question as to the existence of any biography of Captain T. J. Newbold, of the 23rd Madras Light Infantry. A list of that officer's writings will be found in a book published at Madras in 1874, and bearing on the title-page, \"Men whom India has Known, Biographies of Eminent Indian Characters, by J. J. Higginbottom, F.R.A.S.,\" and at the close of that list, reference is made to a Biographical Notice of the deceased in the \"Bombay Times, May, 1850.\"\n\nIssued at Shanghai, August, 1886, are Nos. 1 and 2, Vol. xxi. of the Journal of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. Exclusive of Notes and Queries, and Literary Notes, its articles are thus designated:\u20141. The Advisability, or the Reverse, of endeavouring to convey Western knowledge to the Chinese through the Medium of their own Language. 2. Histrionic Notes. 3. The Seaports of India and Ceylon, Part II. 4. Roadside Religion in Manchuria. 5. Alphabetical List of the Dynastic and Reign Titles of the Chinese Emperors. 6. Where was Ta-ta'sin? a question\nreplied to by No. 6. In \"Notes and Queries\" the signatures of Dr. Edkins and Messrs. Playfair and Giles, are guarantees of matter worthy the reader's attention.\n\nArchaeology.\u2014Vol. iv. of the Archaeological Survey of Southern India, lately issued from the Madras Government Press, and No. ii. of the Archaeological Survey of Western India, both do honour to Mr. Burgess, the Department in his charge, and the many Assistants thrown in his way, and are full of instructive and interesting information. In the first\u2014which deals with Tamil and Sanskrit Inscriptions and village Antiquities\u2014may be specially indicated the admirable care and method with which the record of the Copper-plate Grants is carried out. The volume is divided into three parts respectively designated:\u2014Notes and Inscriptions from Temples in the Madura district; copied Tamil Inscriptions from Temples in the R\u00e1mn\u00e1d Z\u00e1m\u00ednd\u00e1ri; and Copper-plate Grants in the Madras Museum and elsewhere. A note by Mr. Robert Sewell, communicated to the Athen\u00e6um (11th September), refers to the identification by Mr. Burgess, of the Hindu Temple at Srisailam, amongst the mountains south of the Krishna river, with the Buddhist Monastery described by Fah-Hien (A.D. 400) as the \"Po-lo-yu,\" and by Hiouen Thsang as on the mountains of Po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li. Western India's archaeology is illustrated in the other volume by Lists of Antiquarian Remains in the Bombay Presidency, with an Appendix for Gujr\u00e1t Inscriptions. Mr. Burgess explains the practical use of this arrangement to be in affording data for the ready preparation of classified monuments for conservation; and when it is observed that such utilization of his material applies to no less than fifteen Provinces, States, Territories or Districts, and sixteen so-called \"Zillas,\" it will be admitted that an important object has been attained. Apart from these considerations, however, the book will be valuable on its own intrinsic merits.\n\nMr. Burgess writes in the Academy of October 9, that when at the site of the Amar\u0101vati Stupa, he discovered an inscription of the Andhra king Pulum\u0101vi, belonging to the second century A.D. It commemorates the gift of \"a Dharmachakra to the great Chaitya belonging to the school of the Chaitik\u00e1yas.\" The Chaitychas and P\u016brvasailas being one and the same, and the Avarasailas a different division of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas, it is suggested that the assumption, from Hiouen Thsang's reference to the latter, that the Avarasalla Sangh\u0101s\u0101ma was identical with the Amr\u0101vati St\u016bpa may be unfounded. Burgess contends that, in any case, the inscriptions appear to prove Amr\u0101vati the site of the great P\u016brvasaila St\u016bpa.\n\nThe Quarterly statement for November of the Palestine Exploration Fund is full of interesting details obtained from Capt. Conder and other contributors. A paper by Herr Schumacher, giving the results of a recent visit to Southern Palestine, is notable for its description of a singular brick building excavated at Askalan; a second by the Rev. H. G. Tomkins on \"Gath and its Worthies\" may possibly provoke some new discussion; and another by Herr Schick on further investigations at the Pool of Siloam, relates to\nthe important discovery referred to in the Annual Report of this Society for July, 1886. Mention is made in the \"Notes and News\" that a new and corrected edition of the \"Memoir of Twenty-one Years Work\" (well reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of October 2) is now available to subscribers and the public, and that the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society has issued the \"Mukaddasi,\" translated by Mr. Guy Le Strange, and annotated by himself with Sir Charles Wilson. The Report of the Public Meeting held on June 28th, at the Royal Institution, has been deferred for detailed notice until January.\n\nUnder the head of \"A New Reading of the Moabite Stone,\" the Academy of Nov. 27 gives an interesting notice of a publication issued by Professors Lind and Socin, entitled Die Inschrift des K\u00f6nigs Mesa von Moab. This report is the result of a minute examination of the squeeze of the monument preserved in the Louvre by the aforesaid two savants. The subject had been, however, treated by Neubauer two months before in an article in the Athen\u00e6um, September 25, which brought forth a valuable note on \"Ariel\" a fortnight later, from Professor Sayce.\n\nThe Indian Antiquary for September opens with Mr. Fleet's paper on \"The History and Date of Mihirakula,\" followed by No. 164 of the same indefatigable Epigraphist's researches into Sanskrit and Old Kanarese Inscriptions, the special subject being the Mandasor Pillar Inscriptions of Yasodharman. Mr. Rehatek continues his translation from the T\u0101rikh Sult\u0101n\u012b of Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Khan B\u0101rakz\u0101i already noticed; Sir Walter Elliot discourses on \"Ancient Tenures of Land in the Maratha country\"; and, together with a small instalment of Mrs. Grierson's Gipsy Index, there is a third contribution by Mr. Fleet under the designation of \"The meaning of Bappa and Bava.\" The natural inference that the first is the old Prakrit form of the modern b\u0101p 'a father,' and the second the older Prakrit word from which come the b\u0101bd, b\u0101wd and b\u0101vd of Western India, is supported by that kind of argument which could only be applied by an adept in Indian antiquarian research. In the 'Miscellanea' are notes on the origin of the Gupta Era, the latest translation of the Upanishads, and the reason why the name Brihaspatana has been given to a certain set of Brahmanes; also Yudhishtira's answer to four questions of a water demon, devourer of those who failed to supply them. Among the Book Notices, Capt. Temple reviews the late Arthur Burnell's translation of the Ordinances of Manu, and Mr. V. A. Smith analyses vols. xxi. parts 1 and 2, of the Archaeological Survey of India. The October number of the Indian Antiquary contains the concluding portion of Mr. Rehatek's paper on Shah Shuja'a's Last Years; the Four Princesses, a Kashmiri tale by the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles; Dr. Hultzsch's analysis of the Bhagatpur Plate of Narayanapala, and more of the Gipsy Index; also some interesting contributions to the \"Miscellanea,\" among which is a letter from the late Sir Arthur Phayre to Sir Walter Elliot touching\nthe ancient settlements from Telingana on the coast of Pegu. In No. 189 of the same journal, for November, will be found a continuation of Mr. Murray-Aynsley's articles on the Comparative Study of Asiatic Symbolism, the conclusion of Mr. Knowles' Kasmiri tale, a new contribution by Dr. B\u00fchler on Valabhi Inscriptions, the Gipsy Index, and the instructive \"Miscellanea,\" in which Mr. Grierson's practised pen plays a conspicuous part.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of September 25 reports that M. Guillaume of the Institut de France had been placed in charge of an arch\u00e6ological mission to Greece and Asia Minor.\n\nHebrew and Semitic Languages.\u2014Professor N\u00f6ldeke's valuable contribution to part 84, vol. xxi. of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica lately issued, defines the \"Semitic\" as Hebrew and Ph\u0153nician, Aramaic, Assyrian, Arabic, \u00c6thiopic (Geez and Amharic). It would be interesting to compare his definition and general argument with Renan's, but that thirty years of progress in this, as in other branches of scientific study, have effected marvellous changes in thought and theory\u2014a fact on which the learned German writer significantly dwells. Acknowledging the charm and brilliancy of the \"Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Langues S\u00e9mitiques,\" he says, \"A work upon the subject which realizes for the present state of science what Renan endeavoured to realize for his own time unfortunately does not exist.\"\n\nThe Academy of 11th September reports that the 18th Annual Session of the American Philological Association began at Ithaca on July 13th, under the Presidency of Professor Tracy Pack of Yale. Mr. Cyrus Adler of Philadelphia read a paper \"on the Hebrew Words in the Latin Glossary, Codex Sangallensis 912\"\u2014intended to be a contribution towards the collection and explanation of Hebrew words found in late and medi\u00e6val glossaries; Professor Blackwell of Missouri proposed a new etymology for Ashtoreth the Canaanitish Goddess, which he referred to the Akkadian Ishtarat, Ishtar, whereas the common assumption was to identify it with Ashareh. The latter he \"referred to a root asher 'to go before,' not substantiated in Hebrew, but found in Assyrian and Arabic.\"\n\nStrack's Hebrew Grammar, a continuation of Petermann's series, is noticed in some detail by the Rev. C. J. Ball, who sees in it \"a marvel of compression but hardly of expression;\" yet allows that advanced students will find it \"both interesting and, to a certain extent, edifying.\" He himself acknowledges having read the book \"with much pleasure and some profit.\" The English translation is by the Rev. A. R. S. Kennedy of Glasgow.\n\nAn elaborate notice of Dr. Cornill's revised Hebrew text and translation of the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, published at Leipzig, is contained in the Academy of the 9th October.\n\nWe learn from the Athen\u00e6um that the Delegates of the Clarendon Press have undertaken the publication of a new and much needed Hebrew dictionary, in preparation by Canon Driver of Oxford, and Professors Brown and Briggs in America.\nAmong new publications may be mentioned:\n\nDie Aram\u00e4ischen Fremdw\u00f6rter in Arabischen von Siegmund Fraenkel (Brill, Leipzig, 1886).\n\nChwoolson, D.\u2014Syrische Grabenschriften aus Semirjetschie Ureg. u. erkl\u00e4rt (St. Petersburg, 2 m.).\n\nBondi, J. H.\u2014Dem Hebr\u00e4isch-Ph\u00f6nizischen Sprach-zweige angeh\u00f6rende Lehrrnworther in hieroglyphischen u. hieratischen Teuton (Leipsic, Breitkopf und H\u00e4rtel, 3 m.).\n\nLevy, J.\u2014Neu hebr\u00e4isches und Chald\u00e4isches W\u00f6rterbuch, part 20 (6 m.).\n\nDerenbourg, J.\u2014Le livre des parterres fleuries: Grammaire Hebra\u00efque en Arabe, d\u2019Aboul Walid Merwan ibn Djanah de Cordoue (Paris, Viewig, 25 fr.).\n\nGasselin, E.\u2014Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais-Arabe, tome i. (Paris, Challamel atn\u00e9, 120 fr.).\n\nAssyriology.\u2014In the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie for August, M. J. Oppert reverts to his revised interpretation of the word napah, and discusses the question in a separate article of some ten pages, whereas his former notice on the subject was confined to a passage in the \u201cSprechsaal.\u201d Contenting himself in the first instance with stating his proposition, he now shows cause for its assertion by argument and illustration. The second paper by M. Jensen, on the \u201cKakkab Mesri,\u201d carries on the contest already begun by M. Schrader in respect of M. Oppert\u2019s interpretations. To those interested in this learned discussion, a further argument still will be found in M. Hal\u00e9vy\u2019s dissertation on the Star above mentioned in the French Journal Asiatique for September-October. This writer considers the key of the disputed passage to be the word ka\u1e63\u1e63u, commonly translated \u201cearthquake;\u201d but which M. Oppert renders by \u201cwind-tempest,\u201d M. Jensen by \u201ccold,\u201d and M. Hal\u00e9vy by \u201cheat.\u201d The remaining articles in the number under notice are by N\u00f6ldeke on the term \u201cAssyria;\u201d M. Amiaud on Hittite Inscriptions, and notably the \u201cbulle de Iovanoff\u201d; M. Reber on old Chald\u00e6an art (painting); the Sprechsaal, in which are communications by Messrs. Oppert and Jensen and Professor Sayce; the \u201cRecensiones,\u201d in which are reviewed Tiele\u2019s Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte, Pinches\u2019 Assyrian Antiquities, and Brunengo\u2019s Impero di Babylonia; and the Bibliographie.\n\nThe Academy of the 20th November announces that Professor Paul Haupt was to deliver a course of Lectures on Assyriology at the Johns Hopkins University during January, 1887, beginning on the 3rd and ending on the 29th id. Individual instruction would be given at the same time in the Semitic Languages.\n\nTwo numbers of a new periodical designated \u201cThe Babylonian and Oriental Record,\u201d edited by Messrs. de Lacouperie, Pinches and Capper, have appeared. No. 1 for October contains \u201cSumerian and Akkadian in Comparative Philology\u201d by Prof. T. de Lacouperie; Singasid\u2019s gift to the Temple \u00c9-an\u00e1, by Mr. Pinches; and the Plague Legends of Chald\u00e6a, by a writer who signs himself \u2018B. W.\u2019\nNo. 2 for November has the Burning Fiery Furnace, by Mr. Bertin; the Erechite's lament over the desolation of his Fatherland, by Mr. Pinches; Gleanings (I.) from Clay Commentaries, by Mr. Boscawen; and the Kushites, who were they? by M. de Lacouperie. Each number has critical notices of appropriate books and \"Notes, News and Queries.\" From the last it appears that two very interesting courses of lectures on Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Ancient Civilization of the East have been delivered at the British Museum in November by Mr. Bertin and Mr. Boscawen.\n\n**Hittite.**\u2014Professor Sayce contributes to the *Academy* of the 23rd October an interesting letter on a Hittite Inscription discovered by Professor Sokolouski, between Ikonium and Ilgim, and reported on last year by Prof. Perrot. The localities had been visited last summer by Prof. Ramsay, from whose careful drawing of the text new conclusions have been reached. Prof. Sayce finds that the characters and their combinations are the same as those found in the monuments of Carchemish and Hamath, and infers that \"the Hittite monuments of Central and Western Asia Minor cannot be the work of the inhabitants of the country, but of invaders from Syria and Kappadocia. They confirm the Egyptian inscriptions in indicating the existence of a Hittite Empire in Asia Minor.\" But the whole letter in which, among other questions, the association between the Hittite and Amorite names is treated, is full of that high interest which attaches to Biblical archaeology. It may here be added that in the *Academy* immediately succeeding the number noticed, Profs. Cheyne and Neubauer both resume discussions of the last-mentioned subject, the correspondence being further continued to the reader's advantage for three successive weeks.\n\n**Arabic.**\u2014A noteworthy attempt to simplify the grammatical study of Arabic has been made in an octavo volume published at Chicago under the title of *An Arabic Manual by Dr. Lansing*, Professor of Old Testament Languages and Exegesis in the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Church at New Brunswick. Its four main divisions are under the respective heads of Orthography, Etymology, Paradigms and Chrestomathy.\n\nThe first of a series of Memoirs on Oriental Geography and History, published at Leyden, in a neatly-printed, handy volume, is entitled *Memoires sur les Carmathes du Bahrein et les Fatimides*. It is, in fact, a new edition of M. J. de Goeje's publications of 1862, intended as a serial, but continued for three issues only; and both the writer and readers may be congratulated on the revival of the project.\n\nBrill of Leyden has published *Primeurs Arabes*, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par le Comte de Lundberg, fascicule i., and *Ibn Anb\u00e2r't's Asr\u00e2r al 'Arabiya*, edited by C. F. Seybold.\n\nAmong the gift books of the season is one published by Unwin, bearing the emblem of the Crescent and Star, and the title of \"Tales of the Caliph.\" They profess to relate certain noteworthy occurrences in the life of the Khalif Harunu-r-Rash\u00eed, and to be written by \"Al Arawiyah.\"\nThe Academy of October 2nd, reviewing Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental publications, places first in importance the Indica of Al Beruni, Arabic text and English translation, both by Professor Sachau of Berlin.\n\nThe Lord Almoner's Professorship of Arabic, vacant by the resignation of Professor Robertson Smith, the University Librarian, has been conferred upon the Hon. I. G. N. Keith-Falconer, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nSyriac.\u2014The Syriac text of the \"Book of the Bee,\" with an English translation by Mr. Ernest Budge, has been issued from the Clarendon Press, Oxford. It is edited from four MSS.: two in London\u2014one from the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society, and one from the British Museum; one from the Royal Library at Munich, and one from the Bodleian at Oxford. Irrespective of intrinsic worth, the publication deserves high praise for clearness of type, whether Syriac or Roman.\n\nAryan Languages.\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014At the meeting of the American Philological Association before mentioned, Professor Whitney read corrected translations of part of the \"Katha Upanishad,\" remarking that the Buddhistic system of pessimism was possibly rather the product of some special school, than of popular growth.\n\nThe Academy, 18th September, learns that Professor Petersen of Bombay had nearly finished a third report on the search for Sanskrit MSS. in Western India, also a new edition of the Hitopadesa\u2014publication having hitherto been delayed from failing eye-sight. These were to be followed by a catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. at Ulwar for the Maharaja of that place.\n\n\"Selected Vedic Hymns,\" by Professor Cowell, and \"Sanskrit Grammar,\" by Mr. Neil, form, according to the list published in the Academy of Oct. 16, two of a course of five lectures on Philology to be given at Cambridge.\n\nThe issue of the same paper of Nov. 20 contains a letter from Dr. Rajendralal Mitra to Mr. Macdonell of Oxford, in which he explains the delay in publishing his Brihaddevata, but expresses his opinion that a month's leisure would enable him to do the needful. In the paragraph immediately following, it is stated that Prof. C. R. Lanman of Harvard contemplates bringing out a critical edition of the same work, and that Professor Kuhn of Munich had offered to place at his disposal some of his father's essays on it.\n\nMr. C. Bendall's Journey of Literary and Archaeological Research in Nepal and Northern India during the Winter of 1884-5 is analysed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 23rd October, and is spoken of as \"a welcome addition\" to the writer's \"excellent Catalogue of the Buddhist-Sanskrit MSS. in the University of Cambridge.\"\n\nThe high estimate of Mr. Boxwell's powers of metrical translation, recorded in our Annual Report for the past year, has been more than confirmed by the same ready writer's Latin version of a Sanskrit poem which appears in the Academy of the 20th November.\nAmong Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner's new publications may be noticed the text of the Manava-Dharma-\u00c7astra, edited with critical notes by Professor Jolly of W\u00fcrzburg. There is also procurable at the same publishers the second part of Capeller's \"Sanskrit-W\u00f6rterbuch, nach den Petersburger W\u00f6rterb\u00fcchern bearbeitet\" (Karl Tr\u00fcbner: Strassburg, 3 M.). The fourth book of the M\u0101itr\u0101yani Samhit\u0101, edited by Schroeder, and printed at the cost of the German Oriental Society, has appeared at Leipzig (Brockhaus, 12 M. 25 Pr.).\n\nThe second, third, fourth and fifth parts of Panini's Grammar, by Otto B\u00f6htlingk, have been published at Leipzig; and, at Brussels, the \"troisi\u00e8me notice\" of M. Van den Gheyn's \"Nouvelles Recherches sur la Huiti\u00e8me Classe des Verbes Sanscrits.\"\n\nThe Clarendon Press has again done itself honour in the issue of Katyayana's Sarvanukraman\u012b of the Rig Veda, with extracts from Shadguru\u015bishya's Commentary, entitled Ved\u0101rtha\u1e0dipik\u0101, edited with Notes and Appendices by Mr. A. A. Macdonell.\n\nPersian.\u2014Persia, the Land of the Imams, is noticed by Mr. C. E. Wilson in the Academy of the 15th November, as containing many interesting details, but showing want of system in its transliteration of proper names. Its author is Mr. James Basset, a Missionary of the Presbyterian Board. The book was more briefly referred to in the Athen\u00e6um of the preceding month (October 23rd), and a conclusion arrived at much to the same effect.\n\nMr. Pincott's letter to the Academy, in the issue of the 20th November, states that an Urd\u00fa book of much interest had reached the India Office from the Panj\u00e1b, entitled the Kuw\u00e1\u2018iyid-i-Baragst\u00e1, or grammar of the Baragst\u00e1, by Ghul\u00e1m Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n Popalz\u00e1i. The language in question is shown to be \"the dialect of the people named Ormar, a colony of whom resides near Pesh\u00e1war, and another cluster is found at Logur, near K\u00e1b\u00fal; but the principal seat of the tribe is at K\u00e1ni-Karam in the Was\u00edrf district of Afghanist\u00e1n.\" It is Aryan in character, of the Pasht\u00fa type, though inclining to Persian. Mr. Pincott enters into some particulars regarding it, and notes the author's promise to prepare a dictionary and an exercise book.\n\n\"Persia and the Persians\" is a handsomely got-up volume with superior illustrations, published by Murray. It relates the experience of Mr. S. G. W. Benjamin, late United States' Minister at the Shah's Court, and is rather a general survey of the country in which the author passed the year or two of his diplomatic career than a record of daily occurrences.\n\n\"A Sketch of Persian History, Literature, and Politics,\" entitled Persian Portraits, by Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot, formerly of the Bombay Civil Service, has appeared as the Journal is going to press, and is reserved for notice in the ensuing number.\n\nTurkish.\u2014Sir Richard Burton takes up the well-translated \"History of the Forty Viziers\" in the Academy of the 20th November, and pronounces upon it an opinion which cannot but be satisfactory to the translator. As regards the final short a being\nused at the end of a word instead of \\( \\text{ah} \\), the reviewer mentions in a special footnote that he has joined issue with Mr. Gibb. The latter would write Z\u00e1da and F\u00e1tima; Burton prefers Z\u00e1deh (or possibly Z\u00e1dah) and F\u00e1timah. Perhaps, if it were understood that an unaccented final \\( a \\) always represented, in transcription, \\( \\text{ah} \\), some trouble might be saved, and mistakes could not well be made in the meaning of words. When the \\( \\text{alif} \\) is expressed, as in Agh\u00e1, the English \\( a \\) would carry the accent.\n\nM. Van den Gheyn, of Louvain, has republished from the Revue des Questions Scientifiques, of July last, his paper of ethnographic and linguistic interest on Le peuple et la langue des Cumanes; treating of a section of the Turkish race which entered Europe prior to the Othmanlis, in the seventh or eighth century, but has now disappeared.\n\nChinese.\u2014Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co. are about to publish Professor Beal\u2019s translation of the Life of Hiuen Tsiang, written by his disciples Hwui Li and Yen-tsung, a sequel to the Si-yu-ki.\n\nLa Chine Inconnue of M. Maurice Jametel has reached a fourth edition.\n\nProf. Beal has written a long and interesting review of Prof. Legge\u2019s Record of Buddhist Kingdoms, a work which was noticed in the last number of the Journal.\n\nThe Department of Oriental MSS. at the British Museum has been enriched within the last few days by the addition of two curious MSS. from China, of which a description is given in the Academy of the 30th October.\n\nAccording to the Academy of Nov. 20, Sir Thomas Wade, late H.M. Envoy Extraordinary in China, had agreed to present his valuable collection of Chinese books to the Library of the Cambridge University, on the sole condition that he should be its Curator. This offer has, it appears, been readily accepted.\n\nThe Histoire de l\u2019Empire de Kin ou Empire d\u2019Or, being a French translation from the Manch\u00fa by M. C. de Harlez, furnishes a new proof of the usefulness and activity of the learned Professor of Louvain in the field of Oriental research.\n\nA remark made some seven years ago by Mr. A. W. Franks, in his Catalogue of Oriental Porcelain and Pottery, to the effect that we require enlightenment in the science, as it were, of the subject he had in hand, is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of a paper from Dr. Bushell in the Journal of the Peking Oriental Society, which has been reproduced in pamphlet form by the Pei-T\u2019ang Press of Peking. Chinese Porcelain at the Present Day may be commended as an instructive manual of a popular manufacture.\n\nJapanese.\u2014Japanese Names and their Surroundings, by Edward L. Morse, is pleasantly noticed in the Academy of the 11th Sept. by Mr. Cosmo Monkhouse, who seems to trace \u201cthat universal feeling of something more than friendliness which Europe entertains for the Japanese alone of all the nations of the East,\u201d from the fact of \u201ctheir direct unsophisticated naturalness.\u201d In the\nnext issue of the same paper, Mr. Frank Dillon points out that a complete Japanese Room, in accordance with Mr. Morse's description, had been transported at his, the writer's, request to England, and can now be seen at the Bethnal Green Museum.\n\nMessrs. Tr\u00fcbner have announced the publication of a Romanised Japanese Reader, with English translation by Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain, of Tokyo. This gentleman's Simplified Grammar of the Japanese Language is, according to the critic in the Athen\u00e6um (October 16th), not simple enough, and should be recast, as an easy method of making it a most useful book.\n\nMr. G. A. Audsley's \"splendidly illustrated\" two volumes on the Ornamental Arts of Japan meet with fitting attention in the Athen\u00e6um of the 16th October. The details of the various crafts discussed are pronounced \"instructive, and in many places rich in anecdote, and calculated to give an adequate idea of the surprising ability of the Japanese as artificers.\"\n\nA short statement of the aim and method of the Japanese Roman Alphabet Association has, at the suggestion of H. B. M. Minister in Japan, been drawn up in English for all foreigners who may be interested in the subject. This is printed in pamphlet form at the Tokyo press, and bears the signatures of the Hon. Secretaries of the Romaji Kai. Three numbers of the Society's Monthly Journal, the Romaji Zanhi, which have been forwarded to the London Royal Asiatic Society, are good specimens of the application of the principle of transcription involved. Whether the disuse of the native character is a desirable end or not, is a question on which an opinion is not here put forward.\n\nAn illustrated article by F. Kakenberg, on \"Dance and Song in Japan,\" is among the contents of the 15th October number of the Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient.\n\nArmenian.\u2014Professor N\u00e8ve, who has rendered such good service as a Professor and writer in the field of Asiatic research, has just published an interesting volume on Christian Armenia and its Literature. It is in a great measure a reproduction of essays on a subject which has engaged his attention for the last forty years; and well merits a place in the library of serious students of Oriental history. Many will echo the sentiment expressed in the following eloquent passage of his Preface: \"Le peuple arm\u00e9nien, fort d'une admirable fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 \u00e0 son caract\u00e8re comme \u00e0 sa foi, survit aux guerres et aux r\u00e9volutions qui l'ont en quelque sorte d\u00e9cim\u00e9: il poss\u00e8de dans son idiome litt\u00e9raire et liturgique un signe de sa vitalit\u00e9 et un gage de sa perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9. On croirait qu'il est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre part quelque jour \u00e0 la r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de l'Asie.\"\n\nEgypt.\u2014For the three months September, October, and November, the Academy contains, as usual, interesting accounts of the work done by the Egypt Exploration Fund. Sept. 4th has a description of the exhibition of antiquities from Tell Nebesheh and Tell Defenneh (Tahpanhes) at the Royal Arch\u00e6ological Institute. As the Academy states, this exhibition was in many respects the most generally\ninteresting yet shown, containing as it did \"Egyptian antiquities for the Egyptologist, Gr\u00e6co-Egyptian antiquities for the classical archaeologist, relics from a famous Biblical site for the Bible student, and an abundance of those domestic curiosities which especially delight the general public.\" In Sept. 11th Miss A. B. Edwards writes a pleasant review of Sir J. W. Dawson's little book \"Egypt and Syria\"; and in the same Academy is a letter from Mr. H. G. Tomkins on the name \"Takhpankhes.\" In the Academy for Sept. 25th this writer has \"Original Verse\" on \"Jeremiah at Takhpankhes.\" Sept. 18th has a long review by Mr. J. H. Middleton of Mr. Petrie's Naukratis, Part I., with its chapters on pottery, inscriptions, and coins by Messrs. Cecil Smith, Ernest Gardner, and Barclay V. Head. In the following Academy it is stated that second editions of \"Naukratis\" I. as well as of \"Tanis\" I. are in preparation. Oct. 9th and 16th contain some account of the Egypto-African section of the Orientalist Congress at Vienna. M. Naville presided over this section, and at the conclusion he laid before the meeting his recent edition of the \"Book of the Dead,\" giving a most interesting account of the origin, progress, and completion of his work. Amongst papers read was one by Miss A. B. Edwards on \"The Dispersion of Antiquities consequent upon the recent discovery of certain ancient Egyptian Cemeteries in Upper Egypt.\" Miss Edwards strongly urged the identification and registration of historical antiquities in private collections and provincial museums in Europe and America. A resolution was passed in furtherance of this\u2014taking the practical shape of a wide dissemination of Miss Edwards's paper, M. Guimet undertaking to publish it in French in his Annales. Oct. 30th gives a notice of Lectures given at the British Museum by Mrs. Tirard (Miss Helen Beloe) on \"Life in Ancient Egypt\"\u2014the Egyptians at home, at work, at play. These interesting Lectures do much to popularize Egyptology. They are illustrated by admirable diagrams.\n\nIn Nov. 6th is a letter from J. Goldziher on the influence of the Egyptian \"Voice of Memnon\" upon the development of legends in the East. In the same Number Miss A. B. Edwards gives a glowing account of M. Masp\u00e9ro's forthcoming \"L'Arch\u00e9ologie Egyptienne.\" Nov. 13th has Mr. Gardner's Report of his winter's work at Naukratis, where he was left to carry on the excavations begun in the previous season by Mr. Petrie.\n\nThe Atheneum has also a review of Mr. Petrie's interesting volume\u2014Naukratis, Part I.\n\nIn the Oesterreichische Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for Sept. is an article by Julius Wiesner on the \"Microscopical Examination of the Faiyum Papyri\"; and in the Number for Oct. J. Karabacek writes on \"New Discoveries from the Archduke Rainer's Papyrus.\"\n\nThe Revue Critique for Sept. 13th gives a review of J. Lieblein's \"Gammel\u00e6gyptisk Religion, popul\u00e6rt fremstillet,\" by K. Piehl. At the meeting of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres\nOct. 29, M. Masp\u00e9ro presented M. Victor Loret's work, \"The Tomb of an Ancient Egyptian.\" Amongst other studies, M. Loret had spent some time in tracing the composition of perfumes used by ancient Egyptians. Two of these, Kyphi and tasi, had been made under his direction by MM. Rimmel and Dom\u00e8re. M. Masp\u00e9ro submitted specimens to the meeting.\n\nOf books published we may note: The Sarcophagus of Anchnesaneferab Queen of Ahmes II. (about B.C. 564\u2014526), by E. A. Wallis Budge, M.A.; Reise Erinnerungen aus Egypten und Arabia Petraea, by A. Dulk.\n\nAlso an article by Andrew Lang in the Sept. Number of the Nineteenth Century, on \"Egyptian Divine Myths.\"\n\nAnd a brochure entitled \"Zophnat Paneach\" by D. Paulus Cassel, dedicated to the Oriental Congress at Vienna.\n\nMr. Stanley Lane Poole's Art of the Saracens in Egypt is reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 27th November. High praise is accorded to its \"excellent\" chapter on woodwork, while that on \"textile fabrics\" is considered \"one of the best in the volume.\" The author asserts that the present form of Saracenic art is to be seen in Egypt, and points to the mosques in Cairo as giving its normal character.\n\nIndia.\u2014Miscellaneous.\u2014In the Academy of September 4, Mr. H. C. Keene, C.I.E., favourably reviews Mr. H. C. Irvine's collection of \"Rhymes and Readings,\" calling it \"a bright and scholarly little volume,\" and \"a welcome contribution to the not large body of Anglo-Indian imaginative literature.\" Mr. A. N. Wollaston, C.I.E., in the next issue of the same journal, writes an appreciative notice of the late Sir E. Clive Bayley's History of India as told by its own Historians, and in the Athen\u00e6um of 18th September, Mr. Keene's History of Hindustan from the first Muslim Conquest to the Fall of the Mughal Empire is called a \"useful and instructive volume,\" and \"exceedingly readable.\" The Academy of the 23rd October states that Sir Edward Colebrooke, \"who wrote an admirable life of Elphinstone two years ago,\" has resolved to place in Mr. John Murray's hands a continuation of the distinguished statesman's History of India. Mr. Edwin Arnold's \"India Revisited,\" noticed in the Academy of the 30th October, naturally obtains a verdict of approval. A review of Dr. George Smith's Biography of \"William Carey, D.D., Shoemaker and Missionary,\" contained in the Athen\u00e6um of October 2nd, is clearly the work of one well-qualified to deal with the subject.\n\nPart i. of the Comparative Dictionary of the Bihari Language, by Messrs. Hocnle and Grierson, is reviewed by Mr. E. Kuhn, in his Literatur-Blatt f\u00fcr Orientalische Philologie.\n\nFrom the September number, the periodical hitherto known as Panj\u00e2b Notes and Queries, under the able editorship of Capt. Temple and Mr. Longworth Dames, was issued as Indian Notes and Queries, conducted by Capt. Temple, with the assistance of eleven gentlemen whose names are sufficient guarantee for competent representa-\ntion of the departments or localities to which they are officially attached. Messrs. W. Crooke (N.W.P.); M. L. Dames (Panjab); K. Douglas (British Museum, China); D. M. Ferguson (Ceylon); J. F. Fleet, C.I.E. (Sanskrit, Bombay); G. A. Grierson (Bengal); Rev. J. H. Knowles (Kashmir); D. F. A. Hervey (Malacca); E. H. Man (Andaman Islands); R. Sewell (Madras); and G. Watt, C.I.E. (Economic Products), are all more or less known to the reading public, especially that portion of it connected by taste or association with the Indian Empire. The prospectus explains the reason of modification to be that the old title was found too restricted, and the new one admits of an extension of the periodical's sphere of usefulness. Otherwise there will be no change of arrangement or character, and the monthly will be conducted on precisely the same lines as before.\n\nThe following works have been recently issued, and treat of weighty subjects:\u2014History of India under Queen Victoria, by Capt. Lionel Trotter (Allen), and India under British Rule, by Mr. Talboys Wheeler.\n\nMessrs. Allen have also published a Memoir of Capt. Dalton, the defender of Trichinopoly, and the Defence of Kahun, which should interest military readers.\n\n_Calcutta Review._\u2014In the October number, Mr. H. G. Keene leads the way with an article on the Norman Archipelago: and is followed by the Reverend Dr. Scott, with Lives of the Twelve Caesars as written by a contemporary. The question \"Is Hindu Music Scientific?\" forms an appropriate one for discussion, and its treatment is brought to a close with the sensible assertion that if this particular art, or whatever it is called, \"is to be improved scientifically... then that improvement can only come from native musicians who have mastered the science of European music and especially of European harmony.\" A paper by Mr. H. A. D. Phillips on Comparative Criminal Procedure is succeeded by Mr. Dawson's important survey of the influence and position of English-women in India, which, though in two parts, is to all intents and purposes a single contribution. Then follow articles on Imprisonment for Debt, by Mr. Stephen; on Bi-Metallism by Mr. Hibbert; on Simla, Calcutta and Darjeeling as Government Centres, by Mr. C. J. O'Donnell, and two short poems by Mr. Spencer and T. H. T.\n\nThe Quarter, Summary of Annual Reports, and Critical Notices are the last items of a liberal menu. Among the vernacular works reviewed it is worthy of notice that one is called \"an outcome of the movement now going on in Bengali Society for the revival of Hinduism\"; while another is entitled \"A Contribution to the Literature of the Brahmo Samaj.\"\n\nAmong the forthcoming publications of the Clarendon Press are noted the Thesaurus Syriacus, edited by Dean Payne Smith, fasc. viii.; a catalogue of Persian MSS. in the Bodleian Library by Dr. H. Eth\u00e9, and one on the Muhammadan coins there by Mr. Stanley Lane Poole; and four volumes of the Sacred Books of the East, in\naddition to those already mentioned in the R.A.S.J., viz. vol. xxxi. The Zend Avesta, part iii.; the Yasna, Vispurad, Afrinay\u0101n, and G\u0101ha, translated by the Rev. L. H. Mills: xxxii. Vedic Hymns, translated by F. Max M\u00fcller, part i: xxxiii. N\u0101rada, and minor law books by Julius Jolly: xxxiv. the Ved\u0101nta S\u016btras, with Sankara's Commentary, translated by G. Thibaut.\n\nVol. xxi. of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica is full of sound and choice reading. The articles Holy Sepulchre, Septuagint, Samaritans, as well as Sa'di, Samarkand, Sanskrit, Seljuks, Semitic Languages, Shanghai and Siam, should be exceptionally interesting to Asiatic Societies.\n\nAfrican Philology (communicated by the Hon. Secretary).\u2014\n1. Prof. Reinisch of Vienna has conducted through the press a translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew in the Ittu Dialect of the Galla Language of the Hamitic Group.\n2. Dr. Fred M\u00fcller of Vienna has published a Grammatical Note and Vocabulary of the Musgu, or Musuk Language of the Negro Group in Central Africa North of the Equator, based upon information collected by G. A. Krause in Africa.\n3. Missionary Brincker, of the Rhenish Society, is carrying through the Press a Dictionary and Grammar of the Herero and Yambo Languages of the Southern Branch of the Bantu Family.\n4. Dr. Sims, of the Livingstone Mission, has published a Vocabulary of the Teke Language of the Western Branch of the Bantu Family, spoken on the Kongo, North of Stanley Falls.\n5. The same author is carrying through the Press a Vocabulary of the Yansi Language, also of the Bantu Family, spoken higher up the bed of the River Kongo.\n6. Mr. Holman Bentley, of the English Baptist Mission, has completed his magnificent Kongo Dictionary with a valuable Grammatical Note. This book renders the important language of the Kongo perfectly accessible to scholars.\n\nAmong the \"Selected Foreign Books\" in the Academy of November 6, is \"Manuel de la langue Tigrai parl\u00e9e au Centre et dans le Nord de l'Abyssinie,\" by J. Schreiber, Vienna, H\u00f6lder, 6m.\n\nOne word of welcome may be added for the newly-formed Italian Asiatic Society, of which the distinguished Signor Angelo do Gubernatis is President.\n\nN.B.\u2014Owing to the press of other matter, the heads \"Epigraphy\" and \"Numismatics\" are not separately considered for the current quarter.\nVI. Seventh International Oriental Congress.\n\n[Communicated by the Honorary Secretary.]\n\nThe Meetings were held at Vienna from Monday, Sept. 27, to Saturday, October 2. His Imperial and Royal Highness the Archduke Rainier was Patron, and Baron von Kremer President, with a strong Committee of Management. The meetings were held in the hall and lecture rooms of the magnificent new University. Hospitality was shown to the foreign members by the Archduke, the Minister of Public Instruction, the Municipality, and the Committee of Management. The attendance was very large, and the arrangements of every kind perfect. Ladies were admitted as Members of the Congress, and took part in the business.\n\nAn opening meeting and a closing meeting of the whole body were held in the Great Hall; the actual discussions took place in the rooms set apart for the Sections, of which there were six. I. Modern Semitic; II. Ancient Semitic; III. Aryan; IV. African, Egyptian; V. Central Asia, East Asia, and Polynesia. The assembled Members divided themselves according to their predilections into Sections, and elected their Presidents, Vice-Presidents, and Secretaries. The use of four languages was permitted, English, French, German, and Italian; as a fact, only the three former were made use of.\n\nAll the countries of Europe were represented, with the exception of Spain and Portugal. Egypt in Africa, and India and China in Asia were fully represented by Natives, who took their share in the discussions. America also sent representatives. The Royal Asiatic Society sent five Delegates: Dr. Duka, Professor Lacouperie, Mr. Bendall, Mr. Grierson, and Dr. R. N. Cust, the Honorary Secretary. British India was represented by Dr. Hoernle and Dr. Bhandarkar, a Maratha of Bombay. Tsckeng Kitong, the accomplished Secretary of the Chinese Embassy at Paris, in his native dress, but in the language of France, ably represented his country. Other English Members were present, Capt. Temple, Miss Amelia B. Edwards, Mr. MacAuliff, Dr. Ginsburg, Professor Platts of Oxford, the Rev. C. Ball of Lincoln\u2019s Inn, Dr. R. Rost of the India Office Library.\n\nIn the Semitic Sections Dr. Bezold brought forward a Prolegomena to a Babylonist-Assyrian Grammar, and the Rev. C. Ball broached a theory on the formal element in Hebrew lyrics; discussions took place on both. Baron von Kremer read a paper on the Yearly Budget of Har\u00fbn-er-Rashid. Professor Guidi spoke\nabout Arabic Lexicography. Professor Ethe spoke on the Poem of Firdusi's Yusuf and Zulikha.\n\nIn the Aryan Section Mr. Grierson explained his practical scheme for a systematic inquiry into the actually existing Dialects of India, and the collection of specimens of handwriting. Hopes were expressed that the Government of India would carry this scheme out. Mr. Bendall commented on a newly-discovered Indian Alphabet. Dr. Bhandarkar explained in accurate and well-pronounced English, and in a scholarlike manner, the results of his examination of the Libraries of the Bombay Presidency. Dr. Hoernle exhibited and explained some Bakh\u00e1li Manuscripts. Professor Legn\u00e1na of Rome read a paper on a portion of the Rig Veda. Professor Hunfalvy of Buda Pesth raised a discussion on the origin of the Language of Romania, on which a discussion ensued. Capt. Temple alluded to his edition of Hindust\u00e1ni Proverbs collected by the late Mr. Fallon.\n\nIn the African-Egyptian Section Professors Eisenlohr and Lieblein read papers of great importance on the contents of Papyri. Captain Grimal de Guirandon described the Fulah of Senegambia in West Africa; but the feature of these Congresses is that scores assemble to discuss a question of Semitic Grammar, or the curved stroke of an Indian Alphabet, while their ears are closed to any other subject. As for an Egyptologist, he would let the whole world be consumed while he was unrolling his mummy and deciphering his Book of the Dead.\n\nIn the united Sections Central and East Asia and Polynesia, in the presence of about a score of hearers, Dr. R. N. Cust read a paper in the German language on our present knowledge of the Languages of Oceania. Great progress had been made and scores of languages brought to book, languages exhibiting wonderful features of structure, and entirely isolated word store, leading the student back to the origin of Human Speech, but few can escape from the fascination of the well-worn tracks of the highly elaborated Sanskrit and Arabic and the stunted Hebrew. M. Feer followed with a paper on the origin of the word Tibet, and in the discussion which followed Tsckeng hi Kitong took a part, and displayed the power of an educated Chinese.\n\nIn the Ancient Semitic Section Professor D. M\u00fcller gave a history of the sound of the letter S; in the discussion of this minute though important question, several scholars took a part. Herr Strassmeyer made communications on the subject of the Inscrip-\ntions of Nabonid. Mr. Smith, of America, described a translation of the Inscriptions of Assur-bani-pal. Dr. Ginsburg read a paper on the Fragments of a Targum, newly discovered, of Isaiah.\n\nIn the Aryan Section discussion took place on the texts of a Jaina book, and the Jaina Religion. Mr. Grierson followed with a really important paper on the Medi\u00e6val Vernacular Literature of Northern India, of the nature of which he gave a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from 1200 B.C. to 1000 A.D. A resolution was framed, and carried by acclamation, urging upon the Government of India the importance of carrying out a general and detailed survey of the Dialects of India. The search for Manuscripts and inquiry into the Vernaculars might be carried on simultaneously.\n\nIn the East Asian Section Professor Lacouperie handed in his treatises on the old numerals of China and the beginning of writing in Tibet. He also pointed out the trace of alphabetic writing in China, and explained the Inscriptions in Easter Island in Polynesia.\n\nIn the second meeting of the African Egyptian Section, Miss Amelia B. Edwards read a most interesting and important paper \"On the dispersion of the Antiquities found in newly-discovered Cemeteries in Upper Egypt.\" Large collections have been dispersed in country houses and local Museums, and it is most desirable that descriptive Catalogues should be made of all such collections and sent to the British Museum. Prof. Dumichen and Lieblein and Dr. Krall also read papers, but the chief interest centred round M. Naville's report of the completion of his great work, the Edition of the Book of the Dead. He had been commissioned to this task at the Congress held in London in 1874, and the work was only now thoroughly completed.\n\nIn the second meeting of the Modern Semitic Section, Dr. C. Snoucke Hurgonje, of Leyden, read a paper on the Proverbs and Sayings of Mecca. Yak\u00fbb Artin Pasha read a paper on the work of the Egyptian Institute from the date of its foundation. He was followed by Rashad Effendi, with a report upon Public Instruction in Egypt from the conquest of the Arabs to the present time. Shaikh Fateh Allah read an Arabic communication upon the great influence which Arabic had exerted upon general Education. This was a notable paper, being by an Egyptian in the Arabic language on a technical Arabic subject.\n\nIn the second meeting of the Aryan Section Capt. Temple made a communication upon the value of a book called Hir Ranjha by Waris Shah, as a specimen of the Panj\u00e2bi Language. After\nsome technical papers Prof. B\u00fchler exhibited a specimen of Mr. Fleet's third volume of Corpus Inscriptionum Indicorum. Capt. Temple followed with remarks upon the great importance of the office of Epigrapher of British India, and an earnest appeal to the Government of British India to renew the appointment. After remarks by other Members, a motion was proposed by Professor Kielhorn, and seconded by Mr. Bendall, to memorialize the Government in this sense, on the grounds that a real history of India cannot be written until we have a systematic record of the numerous Inscriptions, which are to be found on all sides. Dr. Stein of Buda Pesth gave a summary of the traditions attached to the Plateau of the Pamir, and suggested Geographical identifications. Professor Ernest Kuhn read a most interesting paper on the affinity to each other of the Languages and Dialects of the Hindu-Kush. He had been supplied by Dr. R. N. Cust with certain Vocabularies collected during the last Afghan war, and had made a serious study of these and other available material. Mr. Leland of the United States, so well known as a Romany Scholar, read a paper on the origin of the Gypsies. His remark that he had been informed that there was a wandering tribe still in the Panjab to this day, whose Vernacular was Romany, brought four Members of the Indian Civil Service, all employed in North India, on their legs, and none of them, notwithstanding their intimate knowledge of the people, their interest in this special subject and acquaintance with the details of the late Census of 1882, could in the least way support this assertion.\n\nIn the Second Meeting of the Section of North and East Asia and Polynesia Dr. Heller made remarks on the subject of a copy of the Si-ngan-fu Inscription in China. Professor Kamori of Presburg broached the very deep subject of the affinities of the Aryan, Semitic, and Altaic Family of Languages. Professor Lacouperie read a paper on the languages of China before the immigration of the great Nation which bears that name.\n\nIn the Second Meeting of the Ancient Semitic Section Professor Noldeke urged the necessity of a critical Edition of the Talmud: after some discussion the suggestion was accepted. Prof. D. M\u00fcller recommended in his own and in the name of Prof. Patkanoff that a memorial be addressed to the Russian Government to urge the expediency of preparing a methodical collection of the Cuneiform Inscriptions in Trans-Caucasia, and supporting the attempt to collect similar inscriptions in Turkish-Armenia. This proposition was\naccepted. Prof. Chwolson described the Syrio-Nestorian monumental inscriptions lately found in Fergana alias Kokand. Professor Oppert read a most important paper on the juridical texts of Chaldea from the remotest times down to the most recent. Dr. Heckler, Chaplain to the English Embassy, explained his Chronological Chart of Biblical History specially prepared for the Congress, in which all the latest researches of Assyriologists was incorporated.\n\nIn the last meeting of the Aryan Section Prof. F. M\u00fcller explained some passages in the Avesta. Mr. Macauliffe, of the Indian Civil Service, exhibited a lithographed facsimile of an original life of Baba N\u00e1nak, and made some interesting remarks.\n\nA great many works were presented in the different Sections, with remarks by their authors, which sometimes elicited comments. Dr. R. N. Cust presented to the Congress translations of portions of the Bible in one hundred and four languages of Asia, Africa, America, and Oceania.\n\nNothing could be more courteous, and yet more thorough, than the Proceedings of this Congress. Nothing interrupted the harmony and the interest from the opening to the close. In the early Congresses, owing to the novelty of the circumstances, there had been hitches and unpleasantnesses, but experience had made the way quite smooth.\n\nThe next Congress was announced to be held at Stockholm in 1890, after an interval of four years. One sad feature of these gatherings is the disappearance of well-known and honoured faces, which mark the flight of time. Warm friendships are formed on these occasions, kept alive by correspondence until the next meeting.\nART. VI.\u2014Some Remarks on the Narrative of Fa-hien.\u00b9 By the Rev. S. Beal, M.R.A.S.\n\nFa-hien, the Chinese Buddhist Pilgrim to India (A.D. 400), has left an interesting narrative of his travels, in a little volume known as the Fo-kuo-ki. This was first translated by MM. R\u00e9nusat, Klaproth, and Landresse into French (A.D. 1836). Their version, being accompanied by valuable notes, was found of great use in the study of the Buddhist Religion by those who took up the subject, after Mr. Hodgson's discovery of the Nepalese Sanskrit texts. Other translations have been produced since the time of R\u00e9nusat to the present date. The last of these versions is by Dr. J. Legge, of Oxford.\n\nHaving myself had occasion to go over the Chinese text afresh, I have made a few notes on some doubtful or obscure passages, which I take this opportunity of reproducing.\n\nI. I find in the account of India, or of \"the Buddhist regions,\"\u00b2 written by Taou S\u00fcn (K. T p. 12. b), that Pao-Yun, one of Fa-hien's companions, also wrote a work which he called \"Narrative of travels in the West;\" this may possibly be the volume which is sometimes referred to as the \"Narrative of Fa-hien's travels, in one book;\" but of this there is at present no proof, and I only suggest it as a possible explanation of the reference made in the catalogues to two, or even three, works, written by Fa-hien, or one of his companions, and relating to India.\n\nII. We find it stated that at Chang-yeh the King acted as Patron or D\u0101napati to the Pilgrims. The Chinese expression Tan-yue is the phonetic form for the Sanskrit D\u0101napati; the\n\n\u00b9 Read at the Monthly Meeting, 20th December, 1886.\n\u00b2 The work is called \"Shih-kia-fang-chi,\" No. 1470, Nanjo's Catalogue. Taou S\u00fcn lived A.D. 650.\nsymbol yue \u60aa being frequently used for the termination ra, pa, and pati in proper names. We cannot, therefore, accept the statement that the character yue is here employed in its literal sense. Hence I think we may explain the compound Tin-y\u00fct, or Tin-yue, referred to by Mr. Kingsmill in his paper on \"The Intercourse of China with Eastern Turkestan.\" He tells us (on p. 83) that the agents of Chang-kien, in their efforts to open up relationship with the West through Sze-chuen, heard that there was a country where elephant carriages were used some 1000 li to the West of Yunnan, called Tin-y\u00fct. Mr. Kingsmill suggests that this may refer to the ancient Sth\u0101n\u0113\u015bvara. But I think this improbable. It is more likely that the symbol tin has here the alternative sound of chin, and that Chin-y\u00fct is Champ\u0101, which corresponds in situation to the Chinese requirements, and is celebrated for its elephants and elephant carriages. In this case the symbol \"y\u00fct\" or \"yue\" would be equivalent to pa.\n\nIII. There is another instance of the power of this symbol at the beginning of the fifth chapter of the narrative, where we read that the King of Kie-ch\u2019a was holding \"the great quinquennial assembly,\" known as the Pa\u00f1cha varsha parishad. In this passage the symbol for va, in varsha, is yue (as before). But there is no symbol for parishad (hucui).\n\nWith reference to this assembly, of which we read so much in Fa-hien and Hiuen Tsiang, I think it is incorrect to say that it was first instituted by King A\u015boka for religious purposes; the third Edict seems to imply that the assembly or meeting (anusamy\u0101na) held every five years was already an established custom in India, and that A\u015boka ordained that the R\u0101juka and district governor should repair, on duty, to this assembly, for the purpose of making known certain religious precepts. This corresponds with the duties of the \"heralds\" at the Greek games. It seems likely that these assemblies were held principally for the purpose of commemorating the intercalary year, but were turned to a religious purpose by A\u015boka when he became a follower of the priesthood. We are told by Censorinus (De die Natali, c. xv.),\n\n1 So also in Chap. 35 Po-lo-yue is for Parvat\u012b; for the interchange of vati and pati cf. Oldenberg, Buddha (English Translation), p. 94 n.\nthat this, too, was the object of the Pythian and Olympic games [viz. to commemorate the intercalary year].\u00b9\n\nWhilst alluding to this Mah\u00e1parishad, or great quinquennial meeting, in India, I may suggest that it might have originated the custom of the Mah\u00e1pras\u00e1d, still known in the Central Provinces, and especially in Orissa. This custom, which is connected with the absolute equality of all those engaged, or taking a part in the meeting, is illustrated by the account given in Hiuen Tsiang of the assembly convoked by Sil\u00e1ditya, to which Brahmins, Buddhists and Nirgranthas, were all alike invited, and whilst assembled were on perfect terms of equality.\n\nIV. In the first chapter of the Narrative we meet with the expression \"hea-tso,\" which certainly refers to \"the Rest-season,\" observed as a primitive ordinance by the Buddhists, during the rainy period in India. The reason given for this ordinance in the Vinaya is that the mendicants by travelling here and there when the young crops were growing trod them down and did damage. So Buddha, in agreement with the rules of other mendicant societies (as we are told), decreed that during the three months of the rainy season the mendicants should live in \"fixed abodes.\"\n\nThere has been a great deal of bewilderment in explanation of the Chinese equivalents for this season of religious Retreat. The entire Sanskrit expression is Varsha-r\u00e1sana, which simply means \"rain-dwelling.\" This has been translated into Chinese by symbols denoting rain-rest \u96e8\u5b89\u5c45, or explained by a hybrid compound as hea-tso \u590f\u5750, or la-tso \u814a\u5750; in these compounds the symbol hea is the phonetic equivalent for va, the first portion of the Sanskrit varsha; in the other case la is the phonetic equivalent for the middle syllable of varsha, which is written, more Sinico, as Va-la-sha. So that the three phrases yu-'an-ku, hea-tso, la-tso, denote the same thing, viz. the Rest during the rain-months. The symbol tso (which literally means \"to sit\" or \"remain\") may perhaps be the equivalent for the symbols 'an-k\u00fc which represent r\u00e1sana. Hence we sometimes have in F\u00e0-hien's narrative the\n\n\u00b9 For the reference to Censorinus I am indebted to Mr. J. R. Anderson, an accomplished scholar, well known by his discoveries at Tarentum.\nexpression for tsa, and sometimes tan-ku, and sometimes the symbol la is used for tarsha in the sense of \"years\" or period after ordination. But in all cases there can be no reference to \"summer\" retreat or \"winter\" retreat, or \"Decembers.\"\n\nThere is an expression in the 16th chapter of the Narrative which bears on this point, and deserves notice; Fa-hien is speaking from hearsay about the customs of South India. Amongst other remarks he says: \"In the latter month of the Religious rest the most religious families urge one another to prepare the festival for the priests.\" The latter month in this passage is heou-yih-yueh \u540e\u4e00\u6708, which probably refers to the last month of the second partition of the Rest-season. As Hiuen Tsiang explains the matter (and his account agrees with the notice in the Dipavamsa v. 5, and Mah\u0101vagga iii. 2), there were two periods of Rest, \"the former three months\" and the \"latter three months\"\u2014that is, the priests who were not able to arrive in time to keep the three months from the full moon Ash\u0101dha, were permitted to keep their rest from the full moon next to that of Ash\u0101dha. It was in the last month of this second division that the par\u0101r\u0101na (Ch. ts'z, tsz \u81ea\u6063) festival was held, and I take it that to this month the expression in Fa-hien's text quoted above refers. At any rate, I know no authority for the statement that there are three terms applied to the months of the Rest Season, viz. the first, middle, and last. Such a division, I believe, is not known in Buddhism. These remarks will explain my reason for differing from M. Julien on p. 64 of the first volume of the Si-yu-ki, where he would alter the symbol for \"two\" or \"double\" \u96e8 (liang), into the symbol for rain \u96e8 (yu), and translate the passage \"the priests of India retire into fixed residences during the seasons of the Rains.\" But relying on the fact of a double retreat, as described in the Mah\u0101vagga, and referred to in the Dipavamsa, I have retained the symbol \"liang,\" and rendered the passage \"the priestly fraternity have a double resting time.\"\n\nV. There can be little doubt as to Fa-hien's route from Tun-hwang to Shen-Shen: this district is to the south of Lake Lob, and not up at Pidshan, as Mr. Mayers\u00b9 and others have supposed.\n\n\u00b9 Chinese Reader's Manual, p. 536.\nIn confirmation of this we refer to a short account of the three routes from China to India in a work called *Shih-kia-fang-chi* (written by Taou-S\u00fcn). These routes are called the Eastern, the Middle, and the Northern. In speaking of the Middle route the author (Taou-S\u00fcn) has the following passage:\n\n\"From *Shen-chau*\\(^1\\) going through the Eastern valley about 100 *li*, and then turning North 600 *li*, we arrive at *Liang-chau*, and Eastward from this 2000 *li* we reach the capital (Loyang).\n\nFrom *Liang-chau* going West a little North 470 *li*, we come to *Kan-chau*; West of this 400 *li* is *Su-chau*. Going West a little North from this 75 *li* we come to the old Yuh-men barrier, between the North and South Mountain range. West of this, less than 400 *li*, we reach *Kuca-chau*, and then going South-West through a sandy and stony district 300 *li*, we come to *Sha-chau*; South-West from this, going through a similar district, after 700 *li* or so, we come to the old kingdom of *Na-pu-po*, which is the same as the territory of *Lu-lan*, also called *Shen-Shen*.\n\nAccording to this account the district of *Shen-chau* is S.W. from *Liang-chau* about 700 *li*, whilst *Shen-Shen* is upwards of 2000 *li* from the same place, and about 700 *li* S.W. from *Sha-chau*. The situation of *Sha-chau*, according to Prejevalsky, is 40\u00b0 8' N. and 94\u00b0 30' E., and according to A\u2014K. 40\u00b0 12' N. and 94\u00b0 2' E.; and from this place Lake Lob lies about 3 degrees of longitude W. by S. So that the Chinese account dating back to the Tang dynasty is tolerably correct. This at any rate seems to fix the position of *Shen-Shen*. *Tun-hwang* is considerably to the north of *Sha-chau*, which will account for Fa-hien's greater distance of 1700 *li* to *Shen-shen*; and probably this is more correct than Taou-s\u00fcn's account.\n\nVI. From *Shen-shen* our traveller proceeded N.W. for fifteen days, and came to *Wu-i*. This corresponds with the *Wu-k'i* (or, as M. Julien writes it, *Yen-k'i*) of Hiuen Tsiang; and so with the old Turki word *Yanghi*; there is a district *Yanghi* still marked on the maps extending to Kara-shahr. It was probably to this district of *Yanghi* Fa-hien\n\n\\(^1\\) Si-ning.\nproceeded from Shen-shen. The situation of Yanghi-shahr is about 42\u00b0 N. and 85\u00b0 E.\n\nVII. I may here call attention to the statement of F\u00e2-hien in Chapter II. relating to the clothing of the people of Shen-shen, viz. that the difference between them is marked by \"serge and felt,\" i.e. that some use \"serge\" or \"hair-cloth,\" and others \"felt.\" No doubt this refers to the distinction still noticed by A\u2014K. in his Report, recently published, \"that the Mongolians use white felt, and the Tibetans black stuff made of Yak's hair.\" The distinction, then, observed by F\u00e2-hien, was that between the Mongolians and the Tibetans, who dwelt in common about the district of Shen-shen.\n\nVIII. Leaving Yanghi, F\u00e2-hien now toiled for a month and five days into a south-westerly direction to Khotan, crossing with difficulty the numerous streams that here intersect the country.\n\nIt is interesting to find that Buddhism was so thoroughly established in Khotan at this time. F\u00e2-hien tells us that there were several 10,000 priests and fourteen large convents there, besides smaller ones, and he says moreover that most of the priests, including those of the principal monastery of Gomati, were given to the study of the Great Vehicle. This is an interesting fact, as it shows that at this early date the system, known as the Mah\u00e2y\u00e2na, had become so well established as to reach Khotan. It probably came to this place from Turkestan, and not from India Proper:\u00b9 and I think that this alone would tend to show that the principles of the Great Vehicle, mixed up, as they were, with philosophical speculations, and doctrines strange to Primitive Buddhism, were chiefly derived from foreign sources.\n\nThere is an expression used by F\u00e2-hien, in his account of the priests of this place, which has been variously translated, \"the priests take their food in common,\" or \"the priests receive their food from a common store,\" or \"the priests have their food provided for them, i.e. receive commons.\" The Chinese phrase is Chung-sih, which is a literal translation of the P\u00e2li s\u00e2\u1e45gha-bhattam, and refers to the food belonging to the\n\n\u00b9 I have given reasons for this opinion in the Introduction to \"Records of the Western World,\" p. xiv.\ncommunity as distinguished from the food obtained by begging. This again indicates a departure from the primitive rule, by which the monks were ordered to beg their food from door to door, in agreement with the example of the Founder of their religion.\n\nIX. Leaving Khotan the pilgrims travelled for twenty-five days, and reached Tseu-ho, a term which I take to refer to the meeting of the streams,\\(^1\\) probably at Kugi\u00e4r, which is west of Khotan about 200 miles, but would be reached by a circuitous route, probably through Karghalik by a caravan route as laid down in the map of Turkestan, Sheet No. 4 of the Indian Survey.\n\nDue south four days from Kugi\u00e4r would bring them to the point of junction with the southern route towards Ladak, along the course of the Karakash River. It would seem more probable that the travellers did not follow this route, nor reach so far south as Skardo; but turning west among the mountains (as the Corean Text happily gives it), toiled on for twenty-five days to Kie-cha.\n\nX. Kie-cha must, I think, represent Kash, or \"the river region,\" the Cassia Regio of Ptolemy.\\(^2\\) It was, in fact, the region about the Sir-i-k\u00fal Lake, from which the four rivers of the earth were supposed to proceed; this region has been famous in all time as \"the roof of the world.\"\n\nThere is a note in Taou-s\u00fcn's account of this place, which tells us that Kie-cha is the same as Su-li, i.e. as Syr, which possibly connects it with the Syr-dary\u00e0: the Syr-dary\u00e0, or \"the yellow river,\" is so named, I should suppose, from an old idea that yellow was the colour of the water which was fabled to exist at the earth's bottom; there is a well-known phrase in Chinese, \"the yellow springs,\" as in Cap. xvii. of the Narrative before us, to denote the part below the earth where water is found; so that in primitive times the great rivers, being supposed to come from the earth's reservoir, were called \"Yellow Rivers.\" Hence the name Syr-dary\u00e0 and the Hoang-ho in China.\n\nXI. From Kie-cha they went on towards North India in a westerly direction, and crossed the Tsung-Ling. This name\n\n\\(^1\\) At Do in Tibetan.\n\\(^2\\) This has already been suggested by M. V. St.-Martin and others.\nis of wide application; the Northern Tsung-Ling, corresponding with Bel\u00f3r Tagh, reaches up to the Muzart Pass; the Southern Tsung-Ling includes the mountain ranges of the Hindu Kush and Wakhan, forming the southern walls of the Pamir Valley. The traveller tells us in Cap. VI. that by the Tsung-Ling he means the Snowy Mountains. It was probably through one of the passes opening into the valley of Ta-li-lo that Fa-hien penetrated into North India, and finally struck the Indus.\n\nXII. I think there is no evidence in the narrative that Fa-hien himself crossed the Indus. Hiuen Tsiang, in his corresponding account of this region (Bk. III. p. 134, Records), says, that going N.E. from Mung-kia-li we ascend the course of the Indus, using foot-bridges, and suspended ropes across the chasms, etc.; but he says nothing about crossing the great river. Nor does Fa-hien. He tells us that men in former years bored the rocks, and cut the steps and placed the ladders, and that at the bottom there was a hanging-bridge by which they crossed, but he does not imply that he used it.\n\nIt seems plain to me that Fa-hien, after passing the Snowy Mountains, entered the Ta-li-lo Valley, which was decidedly, according to Hiuen Tsiang, on the right bank of the Indus. He could not have passed the Snowy Mountains into this valley if he had been at Skardo or Ladak, nor can we place Kie-cha by any manipulation in that district. If it be objected that at the beginning of Cap. VIII. it is said, \"after crossing the River we come to Udy\u00e2na,\" I reply that the river they passed was not the one alluded to in the previous chapter, for they had now gone through the valley of Ta-li-lo, and were travelling in a S.W. direction corresponding with the contrary course of Hiuen Tsiang from Udy\u00e2na, which he tells us was N.E.;\u00b9 they would thus come to the Swat River, on the other side of which was the pleasant country of Udy\u00e2na, or, the \"Parkland.\"\n\nXIII. Before passing on to remark upon Fa-hien's account of this country, I should like to notice his record about the figure of Ma\u00eetreya set up in the kingdom of To-li or Ta-li-lo, i.e.\n\n\u00b9 In my version of the Records I have accidentally made the direction N.W. instead of N.E., vol. i. p. 133.\nDardisth\u00e1n. This figure is described as being made of wood and seated with its legs crossed. In this position the feet are upturned, and from the length of the foot the height of the entire figure is calculated, being ten times that of the foot. But writers on this passage have concluded that the measurement denoted by the expression Tsuh kea is the entire width at the base from knee to knee, and so have fallen into the difficulty of making a human figure ninety feet in height and nine feet at the base when sitting with its legs crossed. Of course this is impossible. I would also call attention to the similar proportion of the figure set up by Nebuchadnezzar in the plain of Dura.\n\nXIV. Crossing the River Swat (as we assume), the pilgrim reached the country of Udy\u0101na, with which so many Buddhist legends are connected in Sung-yun and Hiuen Tsiang.\n\nWe need not allude to these, but pass on to some observations about Mihirakula. It is recorded of this monarch that he slew the last Buddhist patriarch Simha, and, as the record found in \"The History of the Patriarchs\" says, this occurred in the country called Ki-pan, which may be either Ka\u015bmir or the region about the Kabul River. Mr. Fleet has asked\u00b9 how the date 472 A.D. is fixed for the Chinese work Fu-fa-tsang-yin-un, in which the record of Simha's death is found. The reply is that such is the date given for the translator Kakaya's arrival in China. But it is quite possible that he may have lived for many years after this period, even down to the time of Mihi-rakula, as fixed by Mr. Fleet, viz. 515 A.D., and that the work he completed, which closes with the murder of Simha, was published at his death. If Mr. Fleet's date is correct, it would seem to follow that the arrival of Bodhidharma in China was immediately subsequent to Simha's death, and that the three Patriarchs, generally named after that event and before Bodhidharma, were living at the same time with him, and were not in the succession, and this is probably the case.\n\nThe legend found in Wong Puh about \"the flowing milk\" (Wong Puh, \u00a7 179), and which I supposed, when translating his account, referred to the Swat River, I now\n\n\u00b9 Indian Antiquary, Sept. 1886.\nfind relates to a story told of Simha, that when his head was cut off by Mihirakula during the persecution, instead of blood, a torrent of white milk gushed from his body, which rose several feet in height. This strange story accounts for Wong Puli's ambiguous, and otherwise unintelligible record, \u00a7 179. But although there is no reference to the Swat River in connection with Simha, I do not doubt that the persecution of Mihirakula was the cause of the desolation of this district after the time of Fa-hien and before Hiuen Tsiang. I am inclined to think that the persecution occurred just after the visit of Sung Yun, for this reason: we find in his Record that in the year 520 A.D., when he went to Gandh\u00e2ra, there was a cruel and vindictive monarch fighting against the country, who received him with ill-concealed hatred. Now, it was about this time, if Mr. Fleet's date is correct, that Mihirakula, whose atrocious cruelty was proverbial, was engaged in subduing Gandh\u00e2ra and the neighbourhood. It is possible, then, I think, that Sung Yun had an interview with this very monarch. His name, Mr. Fleet tells us, was Mihirakula, or Mihiragula, and Cosmas also mentions a cruel potentate called Gollas, who was at this time engaged in warfare in Western India.\n\nThe Mllechhas, of whom the Raja Tarangini speaks (in connection with Mihirakula), were probably the Ephthalitae of Procopius, who were engaged in war with Perozes and Cabades just before Mihirakula's date, i.e. at the end of the fifth century A.D. Procopius, in describing their appearance, says, \"that these alone, of all the Huns, are white-skinned and not bad-looking,\" \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f00\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c8\u03af\u03c3 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, and he says that they came from a region at the extreme north of Persia, the capital city of which was Gorgo. Now Gorgo was the capital of the Chorasmii, the present Urgheng, and the country of the Chorasmii is Khw\u00e2razm, lying on the banks of the Oxus towards the Caspian. Of this people we have notices in Arrian, Pliny, and other writers.\u00b9 But of their power and treachery Procopius gives us the best account in\n\n\u00b9 King Pharasmanes came to Alexander with 1500 horsemen, and said that his kingdom extended to the nation of the Kolkhi and the Amazon women.\u2014Arrian.\nthe third chapter of the first book, *De Bello Persico*. The Ye-tha, whom Sung-yun encountered in the neighbourhood of Dardisth\u00e1n, in this case, would be nomads from this region of the Oxus, and they answer, in many particulars, to the notices we have left on record about these people, in respect of their persons and habits.\n\nOf these notices I shall only refer to two; the first as to the external appearance of this people. Procopius tells us that they were \"*o\u1f50\u03ba \u1f00\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f64\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2*,\" and of white skin. This, I think, may explain the account given us by Hiuen Tsiang of the interview of Mihirakula with the mother of Bal\u00e1ditya, who persuaded him to uncover his face that she might see his well-favoured features.\\(^1\\) His white skin, and so on, would naturally impress her, and she got him his freedom. Then we read that his brother had meanwhile gone back to his country, and taken his army with him, and usurped the government. This answers precisely to the account of Sung-yun, who tells us that just on the borders of the Snowy Mountains they entered the territory of the Ye-tha, whose king did them honour, and received their message from the Empress with politeness. This King (if the dates proposed are accurate) would be the brother of Mihirakula, who had retired to his territories after that monarch\u2019s capture. And the allusion of Sung-yun to the reception afforded him by this king, contrasted with the behaviour of the monarch lording it in Gandh\u00e2ra, would correspond with the history and the character of these respective rulers.\\(^2\\)\n\nAgain, we are told by Procopius of a curious custom prevalent among the Ephthalites. He says, in the third chapter, that the richer class amongst them were accustomed to take as friends and sharers of their private estates any of their neighbours or others to whom they felt an attachment. But, he adds, when he who was their patron died, it was customary for the clients to be thrown alive into the same tomb with him, even whilst in full health and strength.\n\nWe may compare with this a singular record about Mihira-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Records of the Western World*, vol. i. p. 169.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Vide Records of the Western World*, vol. i. p. ci.\nkula, who, when returning to Ka\u015bmir, found an elephant entombed in a chasm, and uttering fearful cries. On this, says the author of the Rajatarangini, the cries of the tortured beast gave him such delight, that he ordered a hundred others to be entombed with him, and to perish together. But if we suppose Mihirakula to be an Ephthal, and to be influenced by the rules of his tribe, this transaction would admit of another explanation.\n\nAnother circumstance may be noticed with regard to these Ye-tha, or Ephthalitae. The head-dress of the ladies is noticed by Sung-yun as remarkable for its singularity. They wore horns, with veils attached, that cover their persons like canopies. Sung-yun tells us that these horns are eight feet in length, but I think there must be here a mistake in his not very accurate text, and the right measurement should be eight inches or more; but anyhow this curious custom has been compared with that of the women of the Druse tribe, who occupy the northern slopes of the Libanus in Syria. It is a curious fact that the Khw\u00e2razm people were driven from their original home into Syria, as noted in the Jesuit edition of Pliny, vol. i. p. 314, and having driven the Franks thence, occupied it as their own territory. Doubtless they carried their customs with them.\n\nFrom these notices I think we may safely conclude that the Ye-thas, who were opposed to Buddhism, and whose chief Mihirakula destroyed the temples and slew the priests in the neighbourhood of the C\u00e2bul River, were nomads from Chorasmia, the Ephthalites of the Byzantine writers.\n\nXV. Fa-hien does not seem to have visited Takshasila, or the spot where the Bodhisattva threw himself down from an eminence to feed the tiger-cat, but he refers to these spots, using the symbol \"yu\" instead of \"hing,\" to show that he spoke from hearsay. I may observe that the history of Buddha's sacrifice for the Tiger is the first of the J\u00e2takas in the J\u00e2takam\u00e2l\u00e2 written by \u00c2ryas\u00fbra, who is the same as A\u015bvaghosha. In the J\u00e2taka the transaction is said to have taken place in the neighbourhood of the large village of Panch\u00e2la. The account of the miraculous St\u00fbpa which Buddha caused to appear corresponds with the Maniky\u00e2la Tope in\nsome particulars, especially with respect to the caskets with the seven precious substances, inside which were deposited the relics of the Bodhisattva's body. If this be so, it would appear probable that A\u015bvaghosha, who compiled the J\u0101taka, and who was a follower of Kanishka, witnessed the erection of this important St\u016bpa.\n\nXVI. Fa-hien, in the 12th chapter, speaks of a king of the Yue-shis, or Yue-chis, who wished to carry off the alms bowl of Buddha from Gandh\u0101ra. I have already remarked that the symbol \"Yue\" is used for the Sanskrit va; so that the Yue-chis are really the Vajjis, or Vrijjis, who at an early date had penetrated to Vais\u0101li. Another body of these people seem to have wandered away towards the borders of China, whence they were driven by the Hiung-nu, in the second century B.C. Whoever they were, it appears improbable that they had anything to do with the Ephthalites. It is more likely from the account given of their dress and equipages that they came from the neighbourhood of Media. Whether the Guzanas and the Minni, of whom we read in the Assyrian Eponym Canon, have anything to do with the Kushans and Minni of India, I leave others to determine.\u00b9\n\nXVII. There is mention made in the 17th chapter of the Narrative of the monarch styled a Chakravartti. He is generally styled a Holy Chakravartti. He is described as \"one who flies as he goes.\" Also, \"as the most distinguished for religious merit among all the men of Jambudvipa.\" Also, \"as a king in whom dwells the holy spirit of the Supreme Ruler of Heaven (Wong-ti).\" In numerous works met with in China, and translated from foreign originals, the birth of Buddha is said to have resulted from the descent of a holy spirit on his mother.\u00b2 I take it that this constitutes the claim of Buddha to the title of a spiritual Chakravartti; he himself directed that his funeral obsequies should be those of a Chakravartti monarch.\n\n\u00b9 But at any rate the Vrijjis are identified with the Lichchhavis who, after their expulsion from India, appear to have conquered Nep\u0101l about the beginning of the Christian era.\n\n\u00b2 The works referred to are named in my Catalogue of the Buddhist Tripitaka, Appendix; and also in my Introduction to vol. xix. Sacred Books of the East.\nI trace back this description of the Chakravartti to the Fravartish, which, according to Haug, corresponds to \"the idea\" of Plato, the ideal in fact of every being in the good creation. Hence, Ahuramazda himself has his Fravashi, and it appears to me that the \"Winged Circle\" in which resides the truncated human figure, standing over Darius in the Behistun sculpture, really represents the spirit of Ahuramazda (i.e., the All-wise or the All-beneficent Spirit), which that monarch ever claimed as his special guide and counsellor. Hence we may understand such a passage as this (Vendidad, Fargard xix., Haug's Essay, p. 334, (Tr\u00fcbner's Edition), \u00a7 14):\u2014\"Do thou invoke, O Zarathushtra, the spirit (fravashi) of me who am Ahuramazda, that which is the greatest and best and most excellent, and strongest and wisest and most beautiful and most pervaded by righteousness.\" This description of the spirit of Ahuramazda corresponds to the Chinese definition of a Chakravartti, and I observe also that Sir Henry Rawlinson defines the word Fravartish as \"the very celebrated\" (J. R. A. S. Vol. X. p. 121).\n\nSo that it seems to me, if we are to account for the statement so often met with, that a holy spirit descended on the mother of Buddha, and that he himself claimed to have the character of a Holy Chakravartti, we must explain it in this way, as derived from the representation of a winged deity found on most of the monuments of the Ach\u00e6menian Kings at Behistun, Persepolis, and other places, and which is said to have originated in Assyria, and to have been copied by the Persians (Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. Vol. XV. p. 338). So that \"Assur, my lord,\" of the Assyrian tablets, which led those monarchs to conquest, is the spirit that constituted Buddha not a conqueror as they were, but a true Jina over the world of evil. Whether the terms Chakravartti, which Wilson defines as he who dwells within the Chakra, and Fravartish are not identical (Fra being equal to Chakra), I again leave to others better qualified than myself to determine.\n\nXVIII. I was glad to find that a suggestion made in\n\n1 This explanation will appear (perhaps) absurd, to those who believe that Buddhism is a purely Indian product. I have long given up that belief.\na paper read before this Society, that the term found in Hiuen Tsiang as equivalent to the \"black peak\" in connection with the Pigeon Monastery (cap. 35) was really a mistake for \"the black bee,\" is confirmed by Taou-S\u00fcn's corresponding account of the locality in his history of India (second part, p. 2. b), where he has the character \"fung,\" a bee, instead of \"fung,\" a peak. The site of the Pigeon Monastery has been placed by Dr. Burgess at Sri S\u0101ilam, and I presume that Bhramar\u0101mba, to whom the priests of this shrine still sacrifice, is indeed another form of Mother D\u016brga, under the title of the \"black bee.\"\n\nXIX. May I briefly refer to the singular legend respecting the origin of the word Sinhala for Ceylon? This legend is given fully by Hiuen Tsiang, and refers to the cohabitation of a lion and a captured woman of India. Now it is well known that the Vajjians who invaded India at an early date were called \"Lions\"; this has been shown from the translation of the Buddha-charita, which forms the 19th Vol. of the Sacred Books of the East. It would appear therefore that the story of the Lion and his captive wife is merely a corrupt form of a Vajjian invader, intermarrying with a native woman, probably carried off in a raid to Ceylon. Perhaps the singular sculptures found in the R\u0101ni K\u0101 N\u00fbr, and the Gane\u015ba Gumpha caves, may refer to this rape of an Indian woman by a Northerner; the figure too of the Yavana warrior from the R\u0101ni K\u0101 N\u00fbr cave, whose appearance so much resembles that of the Vajjians at Vais\u0101l\u012b, is a further corroboration of the argument, that the Vajjians were the Lion tribe that emigrated to Ceylon.\n\nXX. Whether Fa-hien really touched at Java or at Palembang (the Chinese \u015aribhoja) in Sumatra, on his return voyage to his native country, is not yet certain. I am strongly inclined to think he stopped at Sumatra, and that \"Yava\" was a term applied to all the fertile lands of Sumatra and Java, corresponding in fact to \"Bh\u014dja,\" and that \u015aribh\u014dja was the central point of these districts, corresponding as I have lately endeavoured to show with the neighbourhood of Palembang\u2014where we ought to seek for and find many Buddhist remains.\n\n1 vv. 1788, 1789.\n2 Viz. in Tr\u00fcbner's Record, Nov. 1886.\nXXI. I should have referred in my previous notes to a remark made by Fa-hien as to \u015aakra-deva, who came to Buddha with Pa\u00f1cha\u015bikha, the celestial musician, and proposed to him forty-two questions, respecting forty-two subjects. (Cap. xxviii.) These subjects, with the tracings left on the rock, are very probably connected with the forty-two combinations of the Sanskrit roots, which are detailed in many Chinese works, and of which I give here a copy from a translation of Amogha-siddha made into Chinese in the eighth century (A.D. 719).\n\nXXII. Lastly let me call attention to the phrase \u2014 \u5fc3 (one heart) found in Chapter 40 of the Narrative. This phrase means more than \u201call the heart\u201d; it corresponds to the P\u0101li ekodi or ekaggacitta (vid. a letter from Dr. Morris in the Academy, No. 725), and to the Greek \u1f10\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, as used by Plotinus for mystic union, or identity, with the object of contemplation. This statement may be verified by any Chinese student who will take the trouble to consult the second part of the Kwan-yin Liturgy, which I have named and translated in the Catena, etc.\n\nI would also add that the symbol \u5ff5 in the same phrase means much more than \u201cto think on\u201d; it is used in Buddhist formularies in the sense of \u201crecite,\u201d or \u201crepeat\u201d the name of, the object contemplated.\n\nNotes.\n\nIn reference to \u00a7 XIII., Professor Douglas has pointed out that the Chinese symbol kea is equivalent to fuh \u2018the instep,\u2019 and therefore the passage may simply mean that the figure was an erect one, and the length of the foot (instep) 1/6th that of the entire height.\n\nIn reference to \u00a7 XIX., I would refer to the fabled origin of the Turkish tribes from the cohabitation of a woman and a wolf. Vid. Etruscan Researches, by Isaac Taylor, p. 370, also Indian Antiquary, April, 1880, p. 93.\n\n1 Catena of Buddhist Scriptures, etc., p. 401, n. 2.\nART. VII.\u2014Priority of Labial Letters illustrated in Chinese Phonetics.\u00b9 By the Rev. J. Edkins, D.D., Peking, Hon. Member R.A.S.\n\nPanini made gutturals precede labials; but this was because, having given to a precedence among vowels, it was natural to place gutturals in the first position among consonants; for a is allied to k as o (or u) is allied to p, and i to t.\n\nIn tracing the primitive evolution of letters, however, we have not so much to follow the current of vocal air as it issues from the lungs and passes through the throat and mouth, nor shall we find here the key to the order in which the letters were evolved. What we have to do is to consider what circumstances would, in the time when language was first made, be favourable to particular groups of letters, so as to give them priority over other letters.\n\nThe group of letters which would be most favourably received, and most easily imitated, by the men who were for the first time making a language, would be the labials. The lips in forming these letters are visible to the eye. The gutturals have not this advantage, and those made with the help of the teeth have it only in a limited degree. This circumstance would be sufficient to give priority to the labials, so that p, b, m would be used in word-making earlier than t, d, n and k, g, ng.\n\nAmong labial letters we may count p, b, m, f, v, o, u, \u00fc, and some others. These letters do not all, in regard to priority, stand on the same platform. Some are differentiated by the drawing-in of the under lip to the upper teeth. This complex act is fatal to the claim of f and v to any very early\n\n\u00b9 [Sir Thomas Wade, with reference to this paper, writes: \"The subject that has occupied Dr. Edkins belongs, perhaps, more properly to the department of anthropology, or to general, as distinct from Oriental, linguism; but it has thus much of claim upon the Orientalist, that Dr. Edkins's theory of the evolution of certain sounds is illustrated almost exclusively from the Chinese phonetical systems, consideration of which cannot be ignored by the compiler of any serious lexicon of Chinese.\"\u2014Ed.]\nuse in language. They would not compare in antiquity with the more simply formed letters \\( p, b, m \\). As to the relative age of \\( p, b, \\) and \\( m \\), something is to be said in favour of \\( m \\) as first claimant, because the nose passage is left open in ordinary breathing, and remains so when \\( m \\) is pronounced. This letter among all the letters has the most of gesture, and is the most sonorous. The shutting of the nose passage to pronounce \\( p, b \\), requires an additional muscular effort. Hence \\( b \\) and \\( p \\) would scarcely be in use so early as \\( m \\). Then, as to the relative priority of \\( p \\) and \\( b \\), the letter with the loudest sound would be the earlier. Hence \\( b \\) would precede \\( p \\), as being more audible to the unaccustomed ear. Two forms of \\( p \\) dispute the claim to priority, the aspirated and the not-aspirated. The Sanskrit aspirated \\( p \\) exists in very few words. In the Mongol and Manchu languages the aspirated \\( p \\) is uniform. There is no unaspirated \\( p \\) in these languages. In Chinese the aspirated and unaspirated \\( p \\) exist side by side as letters, each having full powers to occupy an independent place in the alphabet, and both are developed from \\( b \\). In these circumstances we may assign the priority to the aspirated \\( p \\), on the ground that it is by the added breathing made more audible, which would give it a better chance of survival. In regard to the labial vowels, \\( a \\) ought to be counted as one of them, because this vowel requires the lips to be wide open. Then we have \\( o \\) and \\( u \\). The law of least exertion will help us here. \\( A \\) would be first (the \\( a \\) in father). \\( O \\) would be second. As to other vowels, such as \\( i, u, \u00fc \\), they would be later, because there is not so much opportunity to distinguish them in the mere act of watching the movements of the lips. In primitive times every help was needed to give words a ready currency. The imitative instinct of man is often held in control by a wilful spirit of contrariety. If words are to endure, they must be clothed with attractions and facilities for imitation. This necessity is in the instance of labial letters met by the visible movements of the lips.\n\nTake as an example the nasals \\( m, n, ng \\). Of these, \\( ng \\) is by far the least common in early language. It is much used\nas a final in modern Chinese, but it is evolved from \\( m \\). Thus \\( tam \\) \u2018to carry a load,\u2019 is also \\( tang \\). \\( Feng \\) \u2018wind\u2019 was anciently \\( bam \\). The reason why \\( ng \\) does not appear in ancient roots with the same prominence as \\( m \\) is that \\( m \\) was favoured originally by the circumstance of its visibility to the person whom the speaker was addressing. \\( Ng \\) has come to be very much a mere substitute for \\( m \\), because it was from the first invisible. The case of \\( n \\) is similar. It also occurs in Chinese as a substitute for \\( m \\). In Mandarin speech \\( sin \\) \u2018heart\u2019 is for \\( sim \\). \\( Lan \\) \u2018blue\u2019 is for \\( lam \\). These belong to recent changes. An older stratum of changes includes those which occurred in the age when the ancient poetry was made, so that \\( jen \\) \u2018patient,\u2019 \u2018hard,\u2019 is in old authorities \\( nin \\) (B.C. 1000), while in Amoy and Swatow, which are very old dialects, it is \\( jim \\), down to the present time. So \\( hwan \\) in the Tiechiu dialect stands for what is elsewhere \\( huan \\) \u2018calamity.\u2019 There is no doubt that the final \\( m \\) is truly primitive, although in North China, where the poems were made, the sound had changed to \\( nin \\) 2800 years ago, for the phonetic \\( \\text{N} \\) \\( nim \\) used in \\( \\text{N} \\). \\( nim \\) \u2018patient\u2019 proves it. This phonetic is used in several other words, which all have in the same two dialects the final \\( m \\). Consequently \\( m \\) should have been in the pronunciation when the characters were made 4300 years ago. We conclude from the fact that this phonetic was pronounced with final \\( m \\) 4300 years ago, and from the greater fact that far the greater part of the phonetics kept their finals, whether \\( m \\), \\( n \\) or \\( ng \\), unchanged till recently, that the evolution of final \\( n \\) out of \\( m \\), of which this is an instance, had at that time nearly concluded its course. We have also instances of the evolution of \\( ng \\) out of \\( n \\). Thus \\( ming \\) \u2018decree,\u2019 \\( ling \\) \u2018command,\u2019 had formerly final \\( n \\), but now they have \\( ng \\). They rhymed with final \\( n \\) in the Odes 2800 years ago. The change has been in each case from the more visible nasal to the less visible. When the aid of the eye was no longer required to comprehend the meaning of the word, the special configuration of the lips was abandoned. Probably less exertion is needed in pronouncing \\( n \\) and \\( ng \\) than \\( m \\). At any rate, whether the\ncause be the law of least exertion or not, the final \\( m \\) has in China been abandoned more and more each century with steady perseverance in favour of \\( n \\) and \\( ng \\). This being the order of change, it follows that, in the first stages of the language, \\( m \\), as a final, had a great preponderance over \\( n \\) and \\( ng \\); and this shows that visibility of the action of the lips held really an important place in fixing the pronunciation of Chinese words before the characters were made. When we remember also that a large number of Chinese words now beginning with \\( w \\) once had \\( m \\)\u2014so that \\( wu \\) \u2018military\u2019 was \\( mo \\); \\( wen \\) \u2018civil,\u2019 \u2018refined,\u2019 \u2018literary,\u2019 was \\( mun \\); \\( wan \\) \u201810,000,\u2019 was \\( man \\); \\( wei \\) \u2018flavour\u2019 was \\( mi \\), we gain additional evidence to show that \\( m \\) has greatly lost ground in Chinese, the reason being that the watching of the lips in speaking was abandoned, and men were able to understand what was meant by the help of the ear alone without the eye\u2019s assistance.\n\nBut it is not only among the nasal letters that the lips had priority in early Chinese usage. The same is true of \\( p \\) and \\( b \\), as compared with \\( t \\), \\( d \\) and \\( k \\), \\( g \\). Facts show that \\( p \\), as final and initial, has lost ground, and that it has been changed for \\( t \\) and \\( k \\). The character \\( \u6cd5 fa \\) \u2018law,\u2019 is in old dialects, and in the tonic dictionaries of a thousand years ago, called \\( pap \\). In Amoy it is \\( hucat \\), while at Tiechiu in Canton province it is \\( hwap \\). Here we see that \\( h \\) takes the place of \\( p \\) to begin the word, and \\( t \\) appears instead of \\( p \\) to finish it. Change from a labial letter to a throat-letter and a tooth-letter meets us at once in our examination of old dialects. The physiological cause is that when the special action of the lips is found to be no longer required for intelligibility, the muscles cease to make the necessary effort in that part of the mouth which is visible to the person addressed, and muscular action of diminished force takes place instead in the interior of the mouth. A very common change in Chinese is from \\( k \\) to \\( h \\). Whenever this occurs, there is a saving in muscular action. So also \\( p \\) and \\( f \\) become \\( h \\) in dialects. There is in this change also a saving in muscular energy, rendered possible because the meaning can be conveyed successfully with less amount of energy. In a Fukien dictionary all words normally\nin \\( f \\) will be found written with \\( h \\), if not with \\( p \\). The region where final \\( p \\) has been changed, partially or wholly, for \\( t \\) embraces South Fukien, Canton, and parts of Kiangsi; that is, the Amoy, the Tiechiu, and the Punti dialects. The indisputable antiquity of these dialects renders this fact respecting final \\( p \\) of very great importance in the history of the language. If, then, we find that the finals \\( k \\) and \\( ng \\) have a great extension in modern times in Fuchow and in the Shanghai and Ningpo dialects, this must be interpreted as indicating that the people of those parts have, to a large extent, fallen back recently on the throat-letters in place of the lip-letters, as when \\( fa \\) \u2018law,\u2019 \\( fu \\) \u2018destitute,\u2019 both having final \\( p \\) in ancient Chinese, are pronounced \\( huak \\) in the city of Fuchow.\n\nThe direction of change in letters is not always from lips to throat, but it is quite enough so to prove the rule. An exception is found in Canton, where initial \\( f \\) occurs sometimes for \\( h \\), and for the aspirated \\( k \\). Thus, \\( huo \\) \u2018fire\u2019 is \\( fo \\); this is a local irregularity. The change from final \\( t \\) to \\( k \\), which we find in Fuchow, serves to show that the proper course of change is from the outer parts of the mouth towards the throat. Yet we meet with a dialect, the Hakka, in which final \\( k \\) has become final \\( t \\). In Kiangsi also there is a dialect, that of Nankangfu, in which \\( p \\) is retained, while the finals \\( k \\) and \\( t \\) are both lost. We do not know enough of that dialect at present to allow of the reason of this peculiarity being fully explained. Yet this may be said, that in South China, Nankang is the city which retains the old labial initials and finals with the greatest persistence, but there is no one dialect where all the peculiarities of the old Chinese pronunciation are retained with exact uniformity. If any dialect preserves the finals well, it falls short in the initials. If its initials are old, its finals will be deficient in antiquity. Nankang comes under the same law that rules everywhere else in South China, namely, that dialects and cities which preserve the old pronunciation in some points, are deficient in others.\n\nThe priority of labials to other letters may be illustrated by the upgrowth of \\( f \\) and \\( v \\). Many words used to write\nSanskrit names, commencing with \\( p \\) and \\( b \\) seventeen centuries ago, are now pronounced with \\( f \\). The word \\( Fo \\) for 'Buddha,' is one of these. The tonic dictionaries show that this was once pronounced in China \\( But \\), as it is by the Japanese still. But in China now it is \\( Fo, Fu, Veh, \\) or \\( Put \\). That is to say, \\( b \\) has changed to \\( v \\) and to \\( f \\). There is no known instance of change in an opposite direction, so far as I am aware. Many hundreds of words exist which can be proved by the native syllabic spelling to have changed \\( p \\) and \\( b \\) to \\( f \\) and \\( v \\). The old tonic dictionaries show this with superabundant clearness and certainty.\n\nThe labial initials appear to have changed, not only into \\( f \\) and \\( v \\), but into tooth-letters and gutturals, and the time when they made these changes seems to have been for the most part earlier than the formation of the characters. To illustrate this it will be well first to give examples of synonymous words in these three groups. \\( Ping, ming, c'hang (t'ang), kwang \\) all mean 'bright.' \\( Pim, tim, kim \\) mean 'stone lancet,' 'lancet,' and 'sword.' \\( Pang, siang, kwang \\) all mean 'assist.' \\( Feng, teng, hing \\) all mean 'abundant.' \\( Ping, ling \\) both mean 'ice,' and \\( ngang \\) or \\( ying \\) means 'hard.' \\( Pok \\) is 'full,' 'satisfied,' while \\( tsok, kok, \\) mean 'enough.' \\( Po, c'hi, k\u00fc, \\) shortened from \\( pak, dik, kok, \\) all mean 'hold in the hand.' \\( Pit, shwat, hut \\) all mean 'brush.' \\( Fam \\) is a 'frame,' and \\( fang \\) 'square,' while \\( c'hwang \\) and \\( k'wang \\) both mean 'rectangular frames.' Cases like these are so numerous that it becomes necessary to suppose that \\( p \\) and \\( m \\) have by evolution originated the other forms. There can be no reason for omitting the nasal \\( m \\) in stating the law, thereby limiting this evolution to \\( p \\). Thus, we find \\( feng, mang, \\) both meaning 'a sharp edge.' \\( Meng \\) 'to grow,' 'to bud,' is correlate with \\( chang \\) 'to grow,' with \\( sheng \\) 'to be born,' and with \\( ging \\) 'rise,' and \\( hing \\) also 'to rise.' Such changes may take place in initials, just as the dialects show them taking place in finals. The difference is in the fact that the finals have changed recently, while the initials appear to have changed mostly before the invention of the characters.\n\n1 \\( Tsu \\) and \\( keu \\) in Mandarin, which has dropped final \\( k \\).\nProbably it happened in this way. Just as with little children there is first a time when they become familiar with labial letters, and the other sounds are beyond their powers, so it was with man. Man first made use of syllables such as ba, ma, map, bap to express his ideas. He had very few roots, and very few letters with which to construct those roots. The sounds increased in number, and the roots multiplied by derivation. Ninety-nine roots in a hundred, viewed from a physiological standpoint, were probably at first derivatives. The hand that points and strikes, itself a derivative, is the fruitful source from which hundreds of words have been derived. So with the foot, that takes its name from the sound of stepping or stamping, and may be a derivative in a family of many hundreds of words. In the creation of derivatives, material assistance was given by changes in letters. The two processes went on side by side. Philology is safe when it is based on the correct physiology of the vocal organs. The more we can reduce letter-changes in all their complexity to a few simple laws, the more assured will be our progress in understanding the history of language. The Chinese language seems to show that at first there was a labial period, slowly followed by an age in which tooth-letters prevailed with labials, and this again was precursor of a time when gutturals grew into extensive use. When the age of the invention of writing arrived, men had already formed a fairly complete system of letters, among which m, n, ng, k, t, p, g, d, b, with s, sh, a, i, u, are all found. We cannot feel sure that we can read out with certainty all these letters in the old phonetics, but they seem to be indisputable, except the s and sh.\n\nThere is a fact of great importance for the proof of the evolution of the gutturals from the tooth-letters. It is that in many phonetics the initial letter is variable. Thus it may be either k or l. Now the letter l is derived from d, and k from g. For instance, kam \u2018to see,\u2019 is also lam, with the same \u7236 as phonetic. Liang \u2018cold,\u2019 is written with a phonetic which is called king, and king also sometimes means \u2018cold,\u2019 when it takes the form kiang \u2018frozen hard.\u2019 Kien \u6771 \u2018pick\nup' is also lien. There are several tens of such phonetics. The best explanation of this circumstance is that d changed to g, and that this change was not yet completed when the characters were being made. We do not find fewer than fourteen phonetics where the initial may be k or l. There are thirty-four phonetics where the guttural k or h stands as initial on equal terms with s, sh or ts, and there are eight more where the initial is either k or t. These facts mean something, and what they mean is that there has been a metamorphosis of the initial. But, more than this, not only has k or g or ng been formed out of t, d, s or ts; the initials p, b and m have changed in phonetics in a similar way. For example, pok, 'a spoon,' has become tok, chok and shau, which it is at present. Four phonetics present the spectacle of p changing to k, and four more of p changing to h. There are five instances of p becoming ts, four of p becoming l, and two of p becoming j. The letter m changes to sh in one instance, to h in four instances, and to l in one instance.\n\nIn an appendix to this paper I give the necessary references to Callery's Systema Phoneticum, so that any one who desires to know on what facts precisely I rest this doctrine of the metamorphosis of the lip-initials into tooth- and throat-initials, and of tooth-initials into throat-initials, may see readily how the case stands. There are 1040 phonetics in Callery, and eighty of these show by the variety of their initials that since the characters were made there has been a metamorphosis, not only of k into h, which is extremely common, nor of t into s, or sh, or l, or ts, all of which are also very common, but of p and m into j, l, h, ts, sh and k. Probably some of the instances are delusive. The cause of difference in initial may be sometimes exclusively ideographic, and not phonetic at all. But the greater part of the eighty phonetics will be found to present a solid phalanx of proof contributed to the support that there has been the metamorphosis for which I am contending.\n\nThe force of this proof for the change of lip-initial to tooth- and throat-initial may be much increased if we consider the general direction and increasing complexity of recent\nletter-changes in Chinese. The change of \\(d\\) to \\(l\\) was already fully established in the Tang dynasty. This means that a part of the words once commencing with \\(d\\) took \\(l\\) in place of \\(d\\), and that when the early tonic dictionaries were made, about A.D. 600, this change was complete. At that time many words now commencing with \\(ch\\) had \\(t\\) instead of \\(ch\\). But \\(ch\\) is a compound of \\(t\\) and \\(sh\\). From a Chinese standpoint, \\(t\\) is the base from which \\(ch\\) has proceeded. Before \\(t\\) threw off a large section of its words that they might take \\(ch\\) instead of their old initial, it had done the same with another large detachment which took \\(ts\\). Previous to this time \\(t\\) appears to have thrown off two other detachments in succession, which took \\(sh\\) and \\(s\\) for their initials. While \\(t\\) was thus employed in subdividing into subordinate branches, \\(d\\) was not idle. \\(D\\) also threw off in succession four detachments of words, which took for their initials \\(z\\), \\(zh\\), \\(dz\\), \\(dzh\\). We find that \\(dzh\\) and \\(ch\\) were not yet complete in A.D. 600, and on this ground we deduce the order of origination to have been \\(z\\), \\(zh\\), \\(dz\\), \\(dzh\\) in the sonant series, and \\(s\\), \\(sh\\), \\(ts\\), \\(tsh\\) (\\(ch\\)) in the surd series. There is here a change from simplicity to complexity. \\(T\\) changed to \\(s\\) before it changed to \\(ch\\). The direction of change was from without inwards. The tongue was induced by the ruling mind to do more and more varied work for the improvement of language and the multiplication of words. To use Mr. Melville Bell's definitions, in \\(t\\) the point of the tongue touches the upper gum, in \\(sh\\) the point and front of the tongue are both raised, and the front approaches the rim of the palatal arch. This is a change from without inwards, as is the case also in the evolution of \\(h\\) from \\(k^1\\) and from \\(g\\), a process which was also completed in A.D. 600, as the tonic dictionaries show. Thus, while Chinese philology teaches that compound initials come from a simple base, it also teaches that the law of change is ordinarily from without inward. It is, therefore, not in the least likely that the lip, tooth, and throat letters were introduced into language at the same time. There was an\n\n\\(^1\\) \\(H\\) is described in Bell's Visible Speech as emission of breath with the throat wide. This is quite behind the point where \\(k\\) and \\(g\\) are formed.\norder of evolution in these also, and in that order the lip letters must have stood first.\n\nAs a conclusion to this argument I add that the labial letters having been first evolved, the earliest roots must have had forms such as ba, bo, ma, mo, map, mam, bap, p\u2019a, pap, bam. That is, they would be biliteral or trilateral combinations of a, o, b, m, p, and aspirated p. From these first syllables the others would all be evolved very gradually as those who used the language required them.\n\nPolysyllabism seems to be not easily conceivable in the earliest stages of language. Assuming that monosyllabic structure was the rule in human speech during its primitive development, any law of progress true in Chinese ought, so far as it is physiological, to be true in the history of any other linguistic stems.\n\nNote I.\n\nCallery\u2019s Systema Phoneticum must always be useful, because its arrangement allows of a large number of instances of the use of the same phonetic being seen together. But Chalmers\u2019 Concise Kanghi, while it does not translate the meanings of words, is much fuller than Callery. I first give the reference to Callery, and afterwards add from Chalmers as an example the whole of his article on one of the phonetics pok or tok, but rearranged by myself in the order of evolution. The principle of arrangement is to proceed from labials to t, d, ts and ch. From them the order proceeds to the upper and lower y and u, afterwards reaching h, k, and k aspirated, and finishing with j and l. It is extremely curious and interesting to trace the development from b in this way from a time long preceding the invention of writing 4300 years ago down to the present day. If writing had been invented much earlier, the descent down the ladder could have been represented in a more complete form. As it is, we cannot trace in an orderly way the development of meanings in their actual succession. We can only roughly represent the development of sounds. The evolution of meanings was always independent of the\ncharacters, and when each new meaning had been evolved, it was the scribe's duty to find a character to represent it. This would be a long time after the new word first appeared.\n\nReferences to Callery's Systema Phoneticum.\n\nChange of \\( p, f \\) to \\( k, ch \\), page 16, 20, 34, 70, 218, 459; \\( p \\) to \\( sh, t, ts, s \\), p. 36, 131, 472, 133, 185, 359, 196; \\( p \\) to \\( h \\), p. 56, 141, 154, 398; \\( p \\) to \\( l \\), p. 240, 131, 279, 459, 472; \\( p \\) to \\( j \\), p. 146, 172; change of \\( m \\) to \\( h \\), p. 44, 174, 237, 406; \\( m \\) to \\( k \\), p. 187; change of \\( ts, s, sh, ch \\) to \\( h, k \\), p. 30, 45, 48, 50, 56, 135, 157, 173, 310, 323, 347, 265, 278, 432; change of \\( l \\) to \\( k \\), p. 62, 141, 190, 200, 233, 244, 261, 331, 361, 426, 442, 412; change of \\( t, ch \\) to \\( k, h \\), p. 36, 42, 48, 96, 108, 164, 233, 406; change of \\( s, sh \\) to \\( h \\), p. 43, 84, 122, 128, 137, 146, 158, 199, 235, 257, 348, 355, 387, 390, 430, 434; change of \\( m \\) to \\( sh \\), p. 59, 431; change of \\( m \\) to \\( l \\), p. 187.\n\nRemark.\u2014There are misprints in Callery, as of \\( hiuen \\) for \\( siuen \\).\n\nNote II.

It was a scoop of wood, a gourd, or a cocoa-nut shell with a handle attached to it. This is found in astronomy as the name of the seven stars of Ursa Major. The sound heard when water is baled would give the name. The cracking of the knuckles is also called pok, as, too, the sound of wind (4), of stepping, of beating (3, 5), of striking with the feet (5), of leaping (5), of an arrow striking a target (11). The influence of astronomy on the formation of words is not likely to be long anterior to the invention of writing.\n\nThis variety of sounds imitated shows that in inventing words primitive men made use of very few letters. A noise heard, whether that of breaking, of the dashing of water, of striking, or of jumping, was called bok, or more probably, if we go back a stage, bop. It was the work of the mind afterwards gradually to apply a convenient diversity of sound to each modification in sense by means of the vocal organs. Here lies that union of the metaphysical with the physical which constitutes the basis of language.\n\nResemblance to familiar objects led to an extension of words. A water ladle gave a name to the seven stars of the Great Bear. A winnowing implement, shaped like a dustpan, received the same name. The loud crack of wood when burnt, though not here mentioned, was the cause of a name for sparks, for bright spots, and hence for any spots. From some of these sources came pok, the name of the spotted\npanther, the bull\u2019s-eye of an archer\u2019s target, and the white corolla of certain flowers.\n\nThe verb \u2018to tie\u2019 deserves attention. It is bau and dik in columns 1, 7. In 8 it is tik \u2018to wrap,\u2019 and in 12 it means \u2018to tie fish.\u2019 It is tiau in col. 16, where the final k is dropped. It is yak in col. 27, with various derived meanings, and lastly yau. Here we have five forms of the verb \u2018to tie.\u2019 But outside of this phonetic we may also readily find the derivatives shok, vok and fok, with shu and fu, and these, though written with different phonetics, may be regarded as forms from the same root, the words being independent of the writing.\n\nPok appears to be the ultimate root for to lead, to beat, to cross a stream, to swell, to ladle, to take, to pour, a white colour, a spot, thin, to roast. The sound of all seems to have been the same when each began its career, but probably not at the same time. In the course of their history all these words became differentiated in pronunciation. For this abundant opportunity was given by variations in the movements of the organs of speech. Any given configuration of the organs becomes wearisome after a time, and is slightly modified. Words in want of a distinctive utterance take advantage of this, and adopt either the old or the new configuration. \u2018To lead\u2019 occurs four times in the example given, and should be compared with the common verb tau \u2018to lead.\u2019 \u2018To beat\u2019 or the sound of \u2018beating,\u2019 occurs seven times, and may be compared with chai or tsek \u2018to beat,\u2019 and p\u2019ai or p\u2019ak \u2018to beat.\u2019 The five examples of white colour, and the two flowers named, may be compared with pai or bak \u2018white.\u2019 The idea of thinness in clothing should be compared with the common adjective bok, pau \u2018thin.\u2019\n\nThis and other phonetics plainly show how, while initials vary from age to age, the final consonant (in this case k) may remain firm for many centuries, till it is dropped in favour of a long vowel or of a diphthong. But the modifications of the ideas inherent in words refuse to be restrained by the trammels of the written characters. They proceed independently on their perpetual career of progress. We must, therefore, compare the words given under any one\nphonetic, with those embraced by other phonetics. We then find that the final consonants of roots are in the long run just as variable as the initials, and the vowels that come between them not less so.\n\nRoots without a clear cut shape in sound and in sense were, on the whole, always impossible. If indistinctness enters, it can be but temporary. The efforts of language will be employed incessantly till distinctness is restored. When derivation takes place, there will be indistinctness for a time, but that time will not be long. The senses of primitive man were clear, and gave him distinct information. His roots then must have been correspondingly clear in their shape.\n\nNote IV.\n\nReserved evidence.\n\nIn order to be brief, nothing scarcely has in the foregoing paper been said of the Kwang Y\u00fcn. This dictionary gives valuable evidence in the point argued in this paper. Its date is about A.D. 600. In it we find the following proportions of space occupied by the six final letters known to ancient Chinese:\n\n| Letter | Pages |\n|--------|-------|\n| M      | 33    |\n| N      | 102   |\n| NG     | 81    |\n| P      | 16    |\n| T      | 33    |\n| K      | 51    |\n\nFrom all the facts open to us, the proportion here is to be explained only on the hypothesis of change from \\( m \\) to \\( n \\) and \\( ng \\), and of \\( p \\) to \\( t \\) and \\( k \\). The proportion assigned here to \\( ng, n, t, k \\) is much greater, without doubt, than it was in the time of Confucius.\n\nNotwithstanding this, many words which are now heard with \\( ng \\) have \\( m \\) in the Kwang Y\u00fcn, and similar facts occur under other finals. To some minds this circumstance, the secular contraction of the area of \\( m \\) and \\( p \\), and the corresponding expansion of the area of the other finals, will constitute a proof of considerable force for the thesis of this paper.\n\nI have omitted the space occupied by words ending in vowels. This would require amplification.\nART. VIII.\u2014The Present State of Education in Egypt.\u00b9 By H. CUNYNGHAME, Esq.\n\n(Communicated through Mr. Habib Anthony Salmon\u00e9, M.R.A.S.)\n\nVolumes have been written about the political and financial state of Egypt, but little attention has been directed to the present condition of education in that country. Therefore the results of a personal inspection of the schools in Cairo may not be uninstructive, especially since the importance of the subject has been strongly emphasized in Lord Dufferin's celebrated despatch (Feb. 6th, Egypt, No. 6, 1883).\n\nEducation in Egypt is not the simple matter that it may at first sight appear; it is surrounded with difficulties, most of them arising out of the wide difference between Oriental ideas and those of Christian countries.\n\nThe present condition of Muhammadan thought may best be understood by calling to mind the ideas prevalent in Europe before the Renaissance. When we open a philosophical or theological work of the middle ages, our chief feeling is one of astonishment, both at the ideas expressed and the reasoning by which they are supported, and we are inclined to wonder how any one in his senses can possibly have possessed them, and more still at how they can have influenced the age.\n\nTake, for example, the reasoning of St. Thomas Aquinas upon the question whether Angels are many or one. He shows that scripture has clearly declared the existence of many angels. But, again, not being material, they must be forms\u2014but a form means that which is, so to speak, typical or ideal only; it lacks content. Now multifoldness can only be given by content, that is, can only exist where there is materiality. Hence then, on the other hand, reason\n\n\u00b9 Read at the Monthly Meeting, 15th November, 1886.\nrequires us to conclude that the existence of many angels is impossible. Here arises a difficulty, which however the writer solves by pronouncing angels to be a genus\u2014not a species; and thus capable of being manifold, without being material. We should call all this metaphysical jargon resting on a series of unproved assumptions. Yet the seraphic Doctor was the acutest intellect of his time, and the writer whose works were considered the most ingenious, convincing, and philosophical. The reason is that we have lost the key by which to read his works. The key can be found, but only with the aid of much archaeological groping in dark corners.\n\nThe spirit of the middle ages was a spirit of authority in matters mental as well as in things political. The ideal of a true knight was unreasoning loyal allegiance, that of a true saint unhesitating faith and obedience; and the knight and the saint then formed the two ideals of holy human life. As a result, science was paralyzed. Men were taught to exclaim with St. Anselm, \"Credo ut intelligam.\" Doubt was proscribed, it was looked upon as unholy, and those who expressed it openly were censured or burned. The chief field of faith was in theology, but even in scientific matters, blind belief was no less demanded. To a young student who alleged he had discovered some new facts in natural history, his teacher replied, \"Young man, this is not in Aristotle; I counsel you to leave these vain inquiries and waste no more time in the foolish pursuit of experiments. Read Aristotle and become wise.\"\n\nAnd the studies of the middle ages were all of this tendency. They are well described in Hallam's Middle Ages. Theology, Logic, Rhetoric, and Law were the principal, but those studies which are based on observation or experiment hardly existed. Magic and witchcraft were firmly believed in; and pilgrimage to shrines and beggary were considered as the road to piety. Heretics were burned, and science discouraged.\n\nBut by degrees the renaissance came to dethrone the principle of authority, to make the human conscience and reason supreme; the study of natural science was placed by\nBacon on its present experimental basis. Descartes founded philosophy on a critical examination of the reason. Protestantism dethroned the principle of authority in religious matters. And in politics, a series of revolutions, sometimes violent, sometimes peaceful, asserted the individual rights of man. These considerations render most interesting a study of Muhammadan life and thought. For to the Muhammadan world the renaissance movement has never come, and therefore learning in the East is now almost exactly in the same condition in which it was in Europe five or six hundred years ago. To the Muhammadan doctor the highest and noblest effort of the human mind is an uncritical and unscientific study of the complicated rules of Arabic grammar, rhetoric, and poetry. He commits to memory thousands of precepts from the Koran, and thousands of sentences from the poets. His speech abounds in parables and elegant similes, involving the most subtle and delicate verbal distinctions.\n\nBut all this is conducted in an entirely unscientific manner. For instance, although knowledge of Arabic is prized far above all other learning, and although, of all living tongues, there is none that illustrates so splendidly the laws of development of language, yet Arabic grammar is taught without even a suspicion that such a science as etymology exists. Indeed, to inquire into such matters would savour of impiety, seeing that the great oracle of the language is the Koran, which not only fixes the articles of belief, but also decides all disputed grammatical questions. The most authentic copy of this work is said to exist at Mecca, written out on ancient skins of parchment. It is asserted not to contain one single grammatical mistake, to be absolutely inimitable by any human pen, and to be the standing miraculous proof of the truth of the religion of Islam. It is not unnatural that he who believes in the verbal inspiration of the Koran should conclude that the grammar must be absolutely perfect. Next in importance to the Koran are the Commentaries upon it, which contain the precepts of the Muhammadan Fathers, the traditionary sayings of the Prophet, and the lives and miracles of Saints. In these commentaries there\nis much which is not in the Koran, and which is yet tenaciously believed. In fact, very many of the most important ceremonial and religious beliefs and observances rest solely upon tradition.\n\nAt one time the study of philosophy and logic threatened to produce on the doctrines of Islam an effect somewhat similar to that of the scholastic philosophy in Europe upon the doctrines of the church. Thus the question was raised whether the Koran was uncreate and eternal, subsisting in the essence of God from all time, or whether it was created by Him; a controversy which Al Ghazili attempted to reconcile by saying that the word of God was in His mind from eternity, but that the transcription thereof was an act of creation. The matter appears finally to have been left to the discretion of believers, but not before great numbers on both sides had been imprisoned, whipped, and executed for heresy. Again, the questions with what body believers shall be raised up; whether angels and animals will be raised up as well as men; whether a perfectly sinless being could be the author of evil; whether punishment after death shall be eternal; and like matters were the subjects of active dispute. Had this tendency of thought prevailed, it might have prepared the Oriental mind for the advent of something corresponding to our renaissance movement, which raised conscience to the position of a fountain of knowledge and supreme guide in spiritual matters, and made the reason the ultimate judge in the domain of science. But it bore no fruit and died away. The philosophical sects were branded as unorthodox, and philosophy itself was regarded as impious. In Spain, indeed, there were not wanting signs of a coming change of thought, but the fall of the power of the Moors put an end to it.\n\nThe only movement which in any way resembled the change of thought in Europe was the rise of the Wahabees, a sect of violent puritans, who forbad luxury and destroyed shrines, not respecting even that of the Prophet.\n\nAnd thus it happens that although in the East learning is regarded with the highest veneration, yet it has never\nattained to a scientific altitude. The learned Hakim considers a knowledge of thousands of precepts from the Koran and the Commentaries as the highest form that theology can take, and the dry rules of Arabic grammar as the principal department of secular learning. Modern science, physics, and chemistry, are looked upon partly as a series of childish conjuring tricks, and partly as the result of intercourse with evil spirits. Educated Europeans coming into contact with a temper of mind like this are usually at first quite unable to believe or comprehend the contempt in which they and their learning are held, a contempt not perhaps wholly unmixed with a sort of awe, but a contempt deeply embittered by religious hatred.\n\nIn Egypt the struggle between the old and the new ideas is most actively going on, and therefore the education question affords the interesting spectacle of a battle-ground, in which the ancient Arabian learning is brought face to face with the knowledge of the West. And this struggle is all the more intense because Cairo has always been considered the fountain-head of Arabic literature, and therefore the war is, as it were, being waged in the very capital of the enemy. It is on this account that a short survey of the schools at Cairo is so interesting, and so instructive.\n\nBefore the advent of Europeans to Egypt, the education of the natives depended on two institutions, the Kuttab or writing schools, and the University. The Kuttab schools were frequented by boys from the earliest age up to puberty, and still remain the primary schools of the country. The little children are collected in some dirty shop or room which would at once be condemned by a sanitary inspector. Here they are placed under the care of a teacher at a cost of about threepence per month per head, and provided with sheets of tinned iron, such as are used to make kitchen utensils. On these, passages from the Koran are written out in ink, and the children learn the verses by rote, and to read by repeating the passages over and over again, while they look or pretend to look at the slate. It is a curious sight to see the little things clothed in long shirts of brightly coloured cotton,\nsquatting on the floor and rapidly swinging their bodies backwards and forwards, while they patter away at the lesson that not one of them understands; for even men are unable to understand the Koran without a commentary. The instructor, a peaceful, gentle-looking man, who is generally incapable of explaining a single word to the children, corrects the exercise in a dreamy way until one of those periods of energy comes to him that generally interrupt the indolent repose of Orientals, and then the children are smacked and thumped for a time until things relapse into their original quiet.\n\nThe boys are also taught to sing in a manner reminding one of Gregorian chants. They use no desks to write at, holding their slate or paper inclined in their hands. It is impossible to write on paper in any other way. For as they use the right hand to write from right to left, a steel pen is inadmissible, for its point, driven forwards like a plough, would penetrate the paper. This therefore requires the use of a soft reed. But ink will not remain in a reed without flowing to the point and making blots, unless the reed is held nearly horizontal, which therefore necessitates the paper being inclined to the horizontal nearly at an angle of $45^\\circ$. This is the reason why Arabs always hold up a piece of paper in the hollow of their hands when they wish to write. The difficulty can be surmounted by the use of a small sliding metal tongue, placed in the hollow of the reed to retain the ink, but I could not find that such a device had ever been used.\n\nMost of the Kuttab schools are dirty in the extreme, clusters of flies hang round the eyes of the children, and in many the smell is intolerable. In some of the school-rooms, even where the children were under seven years of age, I observed that the falaka was used,\u2014a thick stick with a loop of cord in it, to which their feet are strapped down while they are being bastinadoed. It is found that a free use of the rod is a wonderful stimulator of the memory, if it does not much assist the reason. The children appear happy, and there are altogether about 130,000 of them in the Kuttab\nschools. If the rooms are dirty and unhealthy, it must be remembered that so also are most of the peasants' houses throughout Egypt.\n\nAs soon as boys have reached about the age of fourteen years, they cease to attend the Kuttab schools, and then, if they are to become learned men, they go to the University at the Mosque al Azhar, situated in the centre of the native quarter in Cairo. If the scholar is poor, a pittance is doled out to him to live upon, and he sleeps on the floor of the Mosque, an example how little the true student requires. His education is completed in from three to seven years. He is taught commentaries on the Koran, a further mass of undigested tradition is committed to his memory, and then he commences the study called law, but which mostly consists of a knowledge of ceremonial observances. This education is then completed by a short course of logic, rhetoric and the art of constructing verses, and behold our young professor now equipped with all the learning of his ancestors, prepared for each point of controversy with a perfect armoury of wise saws and ancient instances, looking down from his pinnacle on the hateful heresies and foolish learning of the West. The similarity of this course of instruction with those of the Universities in the middle ages is too striking to escape the most cursory view.\n\nTo correct the defects of this method of study has been the chief task of the modern Egyptian Educational Department. They have, however, been strenuously opposed by the Wakf, or body of Muhammadan Ecclesiastical Endowment Commissioners, who are exceedingly jealous of any interference with the old system, and whose efforts have hitherto been completely successful in preventing any changes being made. Thus, while the Education Department has on paper the power of inspecting the Kuttab schools, it has never been exercised, for fear of the storm which would be raised, and any attempt to interfere in the slightest degree with the hotbed of fanaticism in the Al Azhar would be out of the question.\n\nThe efforts of the department have therefore been confined to the foundation of an improved system of primary and\nsecondary schools of their own, at which attendance is voluntary. They have thus erected a series of new institutions side by side with the old ones, and which are so far recognized by the Al Azhar, that sheiks or holy teachers of religion and Arabic are sent from the University to the various Government Schools, wherever they are required. But religion is not made compulsory. The Government has not attempted the formation of elementary schools on a wide scale, therefore their primary schools are still mainly recruited from the Kuttab. The primary school destined to serve as a model to the others is the \"Nassiret,\" and is a very excellent institution.\n\nIt contains 400 day boys and 300 boarders. It is exceedingly clean, and the boys look very happy. They are taught English, French, arithmetic, and drawing, and in fact the elements of a primary education. The age of twelve is the upper limit. I saw some very good elementary Arabic text-books for teaching English. They had been printed in Cairo. The fee for board and lodging and teaching is \u00a314 a year. Day boys pay less, and some are admitted gratis. Of these schools there are twenty-nine in Egypt, I was informed, with a total of about 4000 scholars.\n\nNext in ascending order after the primary schools comes the preparatory school, mainly designed for those who intend to follow the learned professions, or to enter the service of the state. It is situated close to the Khedivial Library at Cairo, in which is contained perhaps the most magnificent collection of Arabic manuscripts in the world. In the preparatory school instruction is given in modern languages, Arabic, arithmetic, a little chemistry, geography and drawing.\n\nThe school-house is a good one, being an ancient palace (as is the case with most of the public buildings in Cairo). It contains hot and cold bath sheds, a rough gymnasium, and two playgrounds, in which it is attempted to make the boys speak French and English during play-hours. About one-third of the pupils sleep in the school, in clean, airy dormitories. The food looks nice and well cooked. They sit, of course, Arab fashion, eating with the right hand out of the\ndish (being the hand destined for all cleanly purposes). The store-room and kitchen are guarded all day by sentries selected from among the boys, who see the food weighed out, cooked, and watch it till it is brought up to table. No corporal punishment is allowed, but offenders are imprisoned in small cells. This prohibition of moderate corporal punishment is a decided mistake. Boys of spirit are sometimes obliged to be removed from the school, who could easily be dealt with if the cane were allowed. The management of the school is in the French manner, the boys being more watched than would be the case under an English system.\n\nOn entering the class-rooms, several characteristic traits of the Egyptian boy present themselves at once, even to the most casual observer. The first is their extraordinary docility and desire to learn. An English schoolmaster could hardly believe such angelic boys existed out of Paradise. This is no mere pretence, it is the fact, and is attested by all engaged in teaching here. Again, the absence of mischief is remarkable. They are being taught in an old palace, the walls of which are still decorated with Arabic paintings, and yet I could nowhere see one trace of wilful damage. English boys would have put pipes into the mouths of all the peacocks, and scratched their names everywhere. The next characteristic is their extraordinary self-confidence. If a boy is selected to do a sum before the class, he steps up at once, without a trace of embarrassment, and goes on in a firm decided tone. No mistake abashes him, and he rarely pauses to think.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the boys are tiresome to teach on this very account. They are so glib, so easily satisfied, and so quick, that they float over the surface of a subject without sounding its depths, and constantly mistake a knowledge of words for a knowledge of things. This fault is mostly due to the pernicious system adopted in the Kuttab schools. I do not for a moment suggest that a knowledge of the Koran is not most desirable for Muhammadans. Too great inroads are being made already on their religion. Wine-drinking, the eating of prohibited food, and unlawful pleasures of all\nkinds, are unfortunately only becoming too common in Egypt; and a class of men has arisen in Cairo who have imitated Parisian vices, without acquiring European virtues; who are neither good Muhammadans, good Christians, nor even good Infidels.\n\nIt is the spectacle of these effeminate luxurious young men, who come back from Paris with the airs of the monkey who had seen the world, that excites the scorn of the strict and self-denying devotees of the Muhammadan religion, and greatly retards the progress of civilization and improvement. Fortunately there are bright exceptions, but the Egyptian nature is so keenly susceptible to the allurements of pleasure, that great care ought to be taken to place those students who go to Europe in positions where they will not be too much exposed to temptations. But while religious instruction in the Kuttab schools ought by all means to be encouraged, yet the Koran might be made, like the Bible, a means of imparting moral truth combined with instructive history. This is not done, the poor little children's nascent powers are warped and stunted, and the results appear when their higher education is attempted.\n\nAlthough the Egyptian boy is deficient in inventive capacity, acts from impulse, is wayward and changeable in mind, and, as I have endeavoured to show, is stunted as to his reasoning faculties, he is not without other compensating advantages. He has a vivid imagination, quick perception, and a power of intuitively sympathizing with others. He is therefore by nature more or less of an artist, and this is shown by the most cursory inspection of the drawings done at any of these schools.\n\nDifficulties, it is true, formerly presented themselves, owing to the Koranic precept against images, which had been interpreted to mean all representations of things which have life. This difficulty has been surmounted; for the sheiks of the mosques who teach in the government schools have lately decided that the word \"image\" must be restricted to sculpture. As a result, the boys have all begun to copy heads from the flat, and that with the most remarkable ability. I\nwas so incredulous that the boys had actually done unassisted the drawings shown to me, that I watched them at work. The result left no doubt whatever as to their powers. Unfortunately they were badly provided with copies. There were a few good crayons from the antique, but for the most part the boys were set to work on lithographs of heads such as were in vogue for books of beauty half a century ago; of languishing females with braided hair in loops, and holding nosegays of flowers or baskets of fruit, or perhaps a captive bird. Nevertheless, the real appreciation of form and the combined delicacy and spirit in handling were surprising for boys so young, and would bear comparison with any drawing school in England or France.\n\nAfter the preparatory school come the applied schools of languages, law, engineering, medicine, arts and manufactures, and military science. I do not propose to weary you with a detailed account of them all, but only to notice a few of their salient characteristics.\n\nIn the school of languages I found the young men rather backward, in spite of the pains taken to teach them and the evident trouble they take to learn. The fault, I think, proceeds from the want of good text-books. I found the French master translating a French grammar into Arabic for the boys to copy out, which, of course, caused a great waste of time. In the English class I dictated a few sentences to one of the boys selected at random, who wrote them out remarkably well. I then entered into conversation with the class, choosing the subject of astronomy, in order to see what their ideas were on this point. Some of the better instructed told me that the earth was 455 miles from the sun and revolved in 44 hours, which I think was a mistake for 24 hours. On further interrogation, it appeared that these boys had learned this from Europeans or from other boys in the engineering school; but the ignorance of the class in general on these simple matters was really disgraceful. It showed that they had never had even the most elementary scientific instruction. Not one boy in the class knew the names of the planets, nor how many there were, and on my telling them\nthat the planets were named by the Europeans after certain ancient gods, I was amused at the face of horror with which one of the boys asked if Englishmen believed in those gods. He appeared greatly relieved when he learned that the English were not polytheists. An obstacle formerly in the way of astronomical studies has been removed by the recent discovery of no less than nineteen texts in the Koran which show that the earth goes round the sun. The interpretations of certain other passages which had suggested a contrary opinion are therefore now discredited.\n\nThe Polytechnic, or Engineering school, is mostly taught by French professors. From this school came the late Astronomer-Royal of Egypt, a man of remarkable scientific knowledge. Here, again, the defects of early education glaringly appear, a strong tendency being exhibited to imitate those persons who learn Euclid by rote, without understanding it. The drawing in this school was quite remarkable; nothing better could be desired as far as artistic execution was concerned. A black boy from the Soudan, who had been about three years under instruction, had shaded and coloured a drawing of an engine in a manner that would bear comparison with the best work done in England.\n\nThe school of medicine is being largely extended. It is situated close to a hospital, and here, also, the manipulative power of the young men was exhibited by the delicacy of their skill in dissection. The great difficulty is that there are no good medical text-books in Arabic. A law is shortly to be proposed making it compulsory on all medical students to be able to read with facility one European language\u2014an excellent regulation, which, as the Arabs are very expert at languages, will not entail much hardship.\n\nThe Ecole des Arts et M\u00e9tiers presents the usual features of a technical workshop on the French system. The boys are being well taught. One of the difficulties with them is that they greatly dislike the European fashion of standing up to their work instead of squatting. Here were being made every conceivable kind of machinery and furniture.\nI saw agricultural machines, patent American wringing machines, models of all kinds, and some very well-executed chairs, tables, and wardrobes. But by far the most striking sight was the beautiful decoration of the walls and ceilings in Old Arabian and Moorish patterns. Nothing better could have been desired than these elaborate traceries in gold and colours. They had mostly been taken from the illuminations in the magnificent collections at the Khedivial Library. The walls of many of the rooms were painted in oil with maps of various countries, in which the most delicate sense of the harmony of colour was apparent.\n\nHow much it is to be regretted that the moneyed classes in Cairo prefer to ornament their houses and public buildings with a poor imitation of modern French and Italian decorations, instead of the beautiful designs of their own country. I have seen palace after palace, which the folly of the past rulers of Egypt has erected, enormous piles of stucco and plaster, covered with rococco ornament and painted to imitate marble. Many millions must have been spent on these palaces, filled as they are with badly-made furniture of the style of Louis XV., and yet I do not recollect having seen in any one of them a sign that the native artists of Egypt have been employed. Their foundations are crumbling, and most of them will soon be heaps of ruins, to be remembered only by the part they have borne in producing that gigantic debt, which still, like an incubus, weighs down the prosperity of Egypt. Let us hope that if the aspirations of the Egyptians towards freedom from foreign intervention are ever realized, they will mark its advent by a return to their own architecture. They have two styles to choose from, both indigenous to the soil, and both suitable to the climate, viz. the ancient Egyptian and the medi\u00e6val Arabian. Of both they possess the finest specimens which exist. What a pity it is, that they, from whom the world has learnt so much in the arts of decoration and architecture, should neglect their own native art and allow their own native artists to starve, while they introduce foreigners from abroad to supply them with an article of a poor and degraded character. The chief\ndefect in Cairo at present is the absence of general technical instruction for the craftsmen, and their repugnance to learn. The handicrafts in Egypt are in a very bad condition. For instance, the work done by the jewellers is simply disgraceful. Slovenly, careless ornament is patched on gold and silver, which only the sharpest vigilance of the purchaser can prevent from being recklessly adulterated, and the tools employed in the jewellers' bazaar would disgrace the Kaffirs. Considering the present cheap price of English and American tools, and the excellent manipulative power of Egyptians, they ought to be exporting jewelry, instead of seeing all the best work taken before their eyes by foreigners.\n\nNor is the artistic skill of the Egyptian inferior to that of any other race. At Thebes such wonderful forgeries of Egyptian antiquities are made, that even experienced persons are deceived by them. It is not only the things that are imitated, but the very spirit of the ancient workman that has been reproduced. A good collection of such forgeries would be quite an acquisition to any museum. At Luxor, a donkey-boy taken at random, and provided with my knife and some limestone, did a series of excellent miniature copies of the cartouches of the principal kings. The pottery all along the river is justly admired for its graceful form, and yet the bazaars are full of French and English crockery, to the exclusion of native work. The clay is to be had, the men exist, but unfortunately the education and the enterprise as yet are wanting.\n\nNo more interesting effort could be made than a wise attempt under suitable guidance to revive and restore the dying Arabian industries.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be remembered, that while the Egyptians have much to learn in the matter of education, they have been making efforts which demand the highest praise and encouragement. They have to contend with religious prejudice, the enmity of the University, and the indifference of foreign powers, and this too in the face of a deficient revenue. If we condemn some of the faults of their educational system, is it not true that our own is also full of\ndefects, and that too with far less excuse for them? It is a fortunate thing for the country that the immediate supervision of education in Egypt is now in the hands of one who is probably the most highly cultivated of all the ministers, and the most thoroughly acquainted of all with European education. Yacoub Artin Pasha is a man who has travelled widely, and has not travelled in vain. Keen to seize new ideas, and yet cautious in applying them, under his hands and with the interest which the Khedive (a sincere and pious Muhammadan) has always taken in education, the schools are slowly being moulded into shape, and bid fair, in time, to become really satisfactory.\n\nAbove all, it ought to be recognized that in order to improve the Muhammadans, we must learn to understand them. In former days they showed themselves keenly susceptible to the Greek learning. If they now persecute heretics, is it more than Europeans were doing not so very long ago? They are capable of being deeply influenced by Europeans; but such influence, to be permanent and salutary, ought to work from within through the medium of ideas, rather than be exerted by means of external force.\n\nNote as to Arabic pens.\u2014The difficulty of writing Arabic on paper placed horizontally may be surmounted by the device which I here exhibit, and which consists of an elastic tongue of metal placed under the pen. I have tried a great many experiments, but none succeeds so well as this. These pens may also be used for writing in Gothic characters, and the peculiar nature of Gothic alphabets, combined with the fact that in old pictures the monks are always represented writing with very inclined desks, makes it not unlikely that they used reed pens. Nor would it be surprising that the medi\u00e6val art of illumination in Europe was got from the Arabs, from whom almost all medi\u00e6val learning was derived.\n\nA further advantage of this pen is that it holds so much ink that a great many words may be written without dipping it again in the inkstand.\nART. IX.\u2014The Tri-Ratna. By Frederic Pincott, M.R.A.S.\n\nIn the very valuable paper on \"Early Buddhist Symbolism\" contributed to the July issue of the Journal by Mr. Sewell, we have many interesting statements showing the possible influence of the West upon Indian symbolism. These, however, do not, to my mind, lead to the conclusion Mr. Sewell desires to establish; and, in fact, he contents himself with the assertion that the sicastika is emblematic of sun-motion, that the chakra represents the sun, and that the tri\u015bula \"is nothing more nor less than a conventionalized scarab\u2014a sun-emblem.\" The first two assertions seem to have been considered self-evident; but, in support of the last, several remarkable coincidences are brought together.\n\nIn my opinion, the difficulty in understanding these symbols arises from looking too far afield for an explanation. We may take it as a rule that all old symbols were intended to represent simple ideas, which in the course of time lost their original meaning, and assumed technical or mystical import. It is safe to conclude that Buddhistic emblems form no exception to this general rule. It is needful to bear in mind, also, that there are two Buddhas and two Buddhisms,\u2014the one is the real reformer and the doctrines which he preached; and the other is the imaginary pre-existent omnipotent being, with his endless co-equal repetitions, and the complicated speculations to which he and they stand sponsor. Enquirers who rest entirely upon the ideas of modern Buddhists, and on the Vaipulya-S\u016btras, will be carried into the realms of imaginary antiquity with its cycles of Buddhas and Bodhisattwas, inculcating crudities and profundities, that may as well be deduced from the sun, or the moon, or from any other equally remote source. We should steadily keep before our minds the fact that the Buddha who gave rise to all this wonderment was a Rationalist of very pronounced type, who set his face against metaphysical speculation. His object was to draw his countrymen away from idle dreaming, and to teach\nthem to concentrate their efforts on the practical duties of life. This is clearly seen by the authoritative words of the rock-cut and pillar inscriptions, by the incidental statements of old Hind\u00fb plays, by the express assertion of the Vishnu-Pur\u00e2na, and even by a discriminative reading of Buddhist literature itself. This being so, we may be sure that all really Buddhistic emblems originated in simple, rational, and practical ideas.\n\nThis historical Buddha, as is well known, accepted the prevailing opinions of his compatriots on a variety of subjects which did not conflict with his own leading ideas. He seems to have held the Agnostic view of personal Deity, which left his followers to branch off into two sects, one theistic, the other atheistic. He accepted the notion of a future state, but left its nature undefined; deeming it sufficient that mankind should know how the lamp of life was to be blown out (Nirv\u00e2na). His reticence on this point has caused all the curious inquiries of succeeding generations as to what he desired us to understand by Nirv\u00e2na. He did not invent, he accepted the theory of metempsychosis. He saw that births and deaths were continually taking place; and as \"misery\" arising from \"desire\" reigns supreme in life, the only way to attain beatitude seemed to be to strip the living principle of \"desire,\" until perfect apathy stopped its vital functions. Buddha seems to have wished to induce his countrymen to abandon traditional dogmas based on revelation, and to accept instead thereof reason as the efficient guide in matters of faith. Reason, he held, teaches us that a pure moral life produces happiness in this world; and, by subjugating desire, destroys all wish for life and the things of sense, and thus accomplishes the Nirv\u00e2na or cessation of transmigratory births. The Parinirv\u00e2na-S\u00fbtra shows that Buddhism carefully abstained from describing Nirv\u00e2na with any definiteness; and the same book makes Buddha say that he \"entangles himself with no such questions . . . What I deal with are the questions of sorrow, accumulation, extinction, and the way. I explain and analyse these truths: here is my field\nof speculation; therefore I exclude and ignore all other questions, all preferences, or questions about transmigrations or idle and vain questions. I devote myself wholly to moral culture, so as to arrive at the highest condition of Moral Rest.\"\u00b9 A man whose purpose in life can be thus stated by his disciples is not likely to be connected with solar myths.\n\nStarting from a rational basis, it is not difficult to explain the emblems found in Buddhist sculpture. And the very first remark I have to make destroys all chance of connecting the Tri\u015bula with the sacred scarab. The Tri\u015bula is the three-pronged object on the top of the illustrations in the paper of Mr. Sewell on which I am commenting. It is a term never applied to the circular object found underneath it. The two objects are totally distinct, and are often represented separately in different places, and for different purposes. This could never be the case if they formed parts of one object; for there is no sense in depicting the front claws of a scarab on one building, and his headless trunk on another. Furthermore, when the two objects are placed together, they are seen to be two separate things one over the other, and not always in the same order, for sometimes the Circle is above the Tri\u015bula. This annihilates the scarab theory, but leaves the origin of the symbol still open to question; I, therefore, add my explanation of the symbols to which Mr. Sewell has called attention.\n\nThe Chakra is the \"circle\" or \"wheel,\" symbolizing the endless revolutions of births and deaths; also the eternity of truth, the complete \"circle\" of the law, the progressive character of the faith, and the universal predominance of its power. The Chakra was a well-known symbol expressing universal sovereignty, and was applied to many Indian R\u0101j\u0101s who were styled chakrav\u0101rtin under the assumption that the \"wheels\" of their chariots could revolve everywhere without obstruction. Nothing could be more apt than to speak of Buddha (who was of royal race) and his Law as\n\n\u00b9 Rev. S. Beal's Catena, p. 183.\nchakrav\u0101rti or universal, and to depict it in sculpture as a wheel. The common Buddhist expression for prayer and preaching is \"to turn the wheel of the Law,\" that is to say, to spread the truth, and to give currency to the views of the Tath\u0101gata. This expression is sufficient of itself to explain the symbol, and to strip it of all allusion to the Sun.\n\nA circular object was also a very complete symbol for Buddhism from another point of view; because, when filled with petals instead of spokes, it represented the Lotos, a flower which, from its calmly reposing on the water and from peculiarities in its growth, beautifully symbolizes both the endless cycle of births and deaths, and the still repose of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. This, indeed, is the most common form which the circular emblem assumes in Buddhism; and the special connection of the Lotos with this creed is expressed in the sacred formula \"Om! mani padme h\u016b\u1e43!\" \"The jewel (is) the lotos,\" a phrase of special significance in all ages and in all lands professing Buddhism. This object, as was long ago pointed out in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (vol. iv. p. 131), was \"the emblem always borne by a Chakrav\u0101rti R\u0101j\u0101, and a fortiori by Buddha.\" Thus, whether we regard the circular symbol as a Wheel or as a Lotos, it is equally expressive of the well-known dogmas of Buddhism.\n\nThe Tr\u012b\u015bula is an emblem of enormous importance to Buddhism, as is seen by its universal diffusion in all ages and in all places, and by the remarkable prominence always given to it. Look where we will on Buddhistic work, there we find this seal impressed. It caps pillars, it sits on thrones, it is carried aloft on standards, it is impressed on coins, and it adorns monuments in the greatest profusion. At S\u0101nch\u00ee this singular device forms the most striking object in the whole building; and at Amr\u0101vati countless representations of it are adorned with the richest ornamentation. It is clear, therefore, that it must represent some idea of universal acceptance among Buddhists; and some\nidea, also, of pre-eminent importance to the professor of that religion.\n\nIf we examine this symbol apart from the circular object on which it is so often mounted, we shall see that it is shaped exactly like the old Indian letter J, y. No amount of floriation materially alters its shape; the two arms are, at times, forked, or tridented, or floriated; the central stem may be shortened or almost disappear; but, in despite of all such changes, its original character is never lost, it remains a Y throughout.\n\nWe have now to see whether the history of Buddhism furnishes us with any watchword or expression which might fairly be held to render the letter Y a recognizable sign of that faith, sufficiently distinctive to stamp anything on which it might be found as Buddhistic. There is such a formula in the celebrated phrase beginning Ye Dharm\u00e1. This formula is now, and always has been, the shibboleth of Buddhism, the great confession of faith, daily and hourly repeated by every member of that community. The sentence Ye Dharm\u00e1, etc., was considered the quintessence of all doctrine, the expression of the four truths, the perfect exposition of the faith, the recognition of the saving power of Dharma, and of the exalted wisdom of the Tath\u00e1gata. These facts seem to me naturally and satisfactorily to explain why the letter Y was used to symbolize Dharma, or the doctrines of Buddha, and why it so frequently recurs on all Buddhistic monuments. There being no personal Deity in early Buddhism, and Dharma, or the Law, being a life of virtue and benevolence, it is clearly impossible to invest it with outward shape for the purpose of depicting it in plastic art. When, therefore, it became desirable to represent the Faith in sculpture, what could better serve the purpose than the first, or most prominent, word of the sacred formula which was held to give full expression to it, more especially when that word consisted of a single consonant?\n\nBut we need not depend solely on reasoning for the ultimate decision; because the sculptures at Amravati have representations of wheels with the letter Y attached round the\nperiphery. These can only be intended to represent praying-wheels, with the Ye Dharm\u0101 attached to them, in the way now daily practised in all parts of the present Buddhistic area. One example in illustration is here given, in which a devotee is standing by, evidently receiving the benefit of the revolving prayers, indicated by the Ye Dharm\u0101 on slips of paper attached to the edge of the wheel.\n\nAnother discovery results from the recognition of this letter Y as the Ye Dharm\u0101 and the emblem of the Law; for it enables us to recognize the object so frequently spoken of in Buddhist literature as the Tri-Ratna. This is known to mean Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha conjoined; but the command to \"worship the Chaitya and the Tri-Ratna\" implies that the latter had some sculptural form to which adoration could be paid. Just such an object is met with in great profusion in all Buddhist remains, consisting of the Trisula, the Chakra, and a supporting stem or stand, often terminating in an impression of the Sacred Feet of Buddha. Any student of Buddhism will instantly recognize the object of which I am speaking, and will be aware of the prominence accorded to it in Buddhistic art. It is constantly found on both sides of doorways, or mounted on thrones as a special object of adoration. The stem on which the Chakra and Trisula rest is often represented as the trunk of a tree, from which protrude short branches from top to bottom, on which are conventional leaves, and, at times, also necklaces of jewels.\nThis combination is certainly intended to represent the Tri-Ratna\u2014the Tr\u012b\u015bula representing Dharma, the Chakra representing Buddha, and the stem with its leaves representing Sangha, the congregation of the faithful\u2014the whole blended into one figure, of which Dharma is the head, Buddha is the body and heart, and Sangha is the limbs, terminating in the Sacred Feet.\n\nBut I must here point out another circumstance, viz. that, instead of a tree-like stem, the Chakra and Tr\u012b\u015bula at times rest upon parallelograms, as may be seen in Mr. Sewell\u2019s illustrations, Figures 1 and 15; and it is not a little remarkable that these parallelograms are, I believe, always four in number, almost obviously intended to symbolize the Four Castes. The Sangha, or congregation, consisted of members of each of the castes; for all caste distinctions were abrogated by the Law of Buddha. A curious confirmation of this explanation is found in the figures of Jagann\u0101th, the bodies of which rest upon four upright stems, as though intended to symbolize that, under that form of the faith, the castes are co-ordinate, none being superior or inferior to the others.\n\nFrom the foregoing facts it seems to me clear that the Tr\u012b\u015bula is simply the letter Y, symbolizing the formula Ye Dharm\u0101, or the Buddhistic faith; and that, in combination with the Chakra (symbolical of Buddha, and the universality of his dominion), supported by the objects representing the four castes, or Sangha, constituted the Tri-Ratna so constantly spoken of in Buddhist books. This gives a precise and natural explanation of the figure on the gateways at S\u0101nch\u012b, shown by Mr. Sewell in his Fig. 15. It is, in reality, the Tri-Ratna, or combination of Dharma, Buddha, and Sangha, so passionately extolled by ancient Buddhists as an object of adoration, and hence placed in the most conspicuous position by the architects of the building.\n\nThe emblem which remains to be spoken of is the Svastika; and it will strip this of much superstition to remark that it is so called from the Sanskrit prefix su \u2018good,\u2019\nexcellent,' and the verbal form asti 'existing,' followed by the adjectival affix ka. It may be taken to mean, literally, \"excellently-existent,\" or \"what exists perfectly\"; and is used as a substantive implying benediction or good fortune. It is a kind of antithet to n\u0101stika 'non-existent,' which, as a substantive, means an atheist. The Swastika was impressed upon objects as a mark of good fortune; but it was a symbol of special sanctity in the estimation of Buddhists, for it is not infrequently represented in the position of greatest honour on the seat of a throne, with, in some cases, adoring devotees around.\n\nIt deserves notice that the arms of the Swastika symbol do not always point in the same direction. They point to the right or left with seeming indifference, many being shaped thus \u0950, and others in the reverse direction, thus \u0913\u0964 The lines are not always angular, sometimes they are rounded; others again consist of a plain cross with four added ornaments; while others consist of a complicated arrangement of intertwining lines, departing widely from what is taken to be the primitive type. When resting on a throne it is constantly depicted as a kind of cake, like our \"hot-cross-buns,\" thus \u0913\u0964 These peculiarities, to which attention has never, that I am aware, been drawn, militate against the idea that this symbol represents the motion of the Sun; for the sun is not likely to have been depicted as revolving in opposite directions, or as getting into a complicated whirl.\n\nThis curious object, in reality, represents simply a given space divided into four equal parts, united in the centre; and this suggests a metaphorical combination of the four castes united in a common society, the bent divisional arms of which appear to indicate revolution or recurrence, i.e. the endless revolution of recurring births and deaths. When looked at carefully, each side, as it revolves, suggests the figure of the Tr\u012bsula, the emblem of Dharma, while the whole circulating object represents the Chakra or Buddha; and the four compartments depict the four castes or Sangha. Thus this venerated symbol presents us with the most\ncondensed form of the Tri-Ratna; and ascribing to it that meaning, we have a full and satisfactory explanation of its wide diffusion over every district to which Buddhism penetrated. It is quite possible that this distinctly Buddhist emblem may have an accidental resemblance to some other object venerated by other nations; but before any real relationship can be claimed, the various distinguishing features of each should be carefully noted and compared, and the probability of borrowing should be reasonably ascertained. The figure is a very simple one, not requiring much skill to invent, and might well have suggested itself to many people to represent many different ideas. I may mention that the old Indian letters SUSTK, the essential characters of Sustaka, the P\u0101li form of the word, when superposed as a monogram, form a symbol exactly like the Swastika emblem. It may, therefore, like the Trisula, be merely a monogram.\n\nWhatever may be thought of my attempt to rationalize the Swastika mark, it seems to me perfectly clear (from an examination of hundreds of specimens, and after considering all that Maissey, Cunningham, Prinsep, Wilson, Burnouf, and Fergusson have said on the subject) that the Trisula is the letter Y, monogramatically depicting the Ye Dharm\u0101; and that the Chakra symbolized the revolutions of birth and death, and the universality of the dominion of Buddha's religion. Such explanations are not only reasonable in themselves, and in precise accord with the ideas ascribed to Sakya Muni, but they fully account for the important positions accorded to these emblems in sculpture, and for their combination as the so-called Tri-Ratna, or their separation into individual symbols on coins, etc.\n\nAlthough differing from Mr. Sewell in the powers I would ascribe to the symbols of Buddhism, I gladly recognize the value and research of Mr. Sewell's paper. The sincerity and modesty his paper exhibits lead me to think that he will welcome any suggestions tending to elucidate a subject in which he evidently takes deep interest.\nART. X.\u2014Description of the Noble Sanctuary at Jerusalem in 1470 A.D., by Kam\u00e2l (or Shams) ad Din as Suy\u00fbti. Extracts Re-translated by Guy le Strange, M.R.A.S.\n\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\n\n'Traduttore traditore.'\u2014Italian Proverb.\n\nAmong the many useful works that have appeared under the auspices of 'The Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland,' none is perhaps more palpably open to criticism than the Rev. J. Reynolds' History of the Temple of Jerusalem.\u00b9 To judge from the translation, Mr. Reynolds had, to begin with, but a very imperfect knowledge of Arabic, and, in the second place, from the extraordinary blunders he makes, he can have put himself to no pains whatever to become acquainted, by means of plans, and the descriptions of modern travellers, with the localities of which the Arab author speaks. It is not my present purpose to re-edit and correct Mr. Reynolds' work, for the book runs to some 550 pages, large 8vo., and it may safely be asserted that there is not a single one of his pages that would not require considerable alteration, to make it a tolerably exact rendering of his author's text. Moreover, the pages of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal hardly afford room for so lengthy a work. I must therefore content myself with giving the headings of each of the seventeen chapters, and shall only translate such passages in the text as have seemed to me of most importance from an archeological or architectural point of view, and for throwing light on the vexed question of the sites of the Holy Places.\n\n\u00b9 The History of the Temple of Jerusalem, translated from the Arabic MS. of the Im\u00e2m Jalal ad Din as Si\u00fbti, with notes and dissertations by the Rev. J. Reynolds, B.A., etc. London, 1836.\nIt is necessary, however, before passing on to the book itself, to point out that Mr. Reynolds has made a first mistake in ascribing the work to the Im\u00e2m Jal\u00e2l ad D\u00een as Suy\u00fbt\u00ee. Jal\u00e2l ad D\u00een as Suy\u00fbt\u00ee is an extremely well known personage to any one who has turned over the pages of Sale\u2019s \u201cKoran,\u201d and is principally known by his numberless exegetical works on the Kuran and the traditions, his \u201cHistory of the Caliphs\u201d (translated by H. S. Jarrett, 1881), with various dictionaries, etc., etc.; for, according to the catalogue he himself gives of his writings, their number exceeded 300, and they treat of every subject that came under the cognizance of the learned in Isl\u00e2m. The details of Jal\u00e2l ad D\u00een as Suy\u00fbt\u00ee\u2019s life are perfectly well known. He was born in A.H. 849 at Asi\u00fbt, in Upper Egypt, and he died in A.H. 911 as a recluse in his garden on the Island of Roda above Cairo. With this most learned personage Shams ad D\u00een as S\u00fby\u00fbt\u00ee, the author of the book Mr. Reynolds took in hand, has only in common that both were born at Asi\u00fbt. Shams ad D\u00een as Suy\u00fbt\u00ee gives a full account of himself in the preface to the work which is now occupying us. The date of his birth is not given, but he states that after completing his education in the schools of Cairo, he set out on the Pilgrimage to the Holy Cities, and reached Mekka in A.H. 848 (A.D. 1444; that is to say, a year before Jal\u00e2l ad D\u00een, the other Suy\u00fbt\u00ee, was born). After spending a year at Mekka, he became tired of the place and returned to Cairo. However, a year later he sets out with his household, and paying a flying visit to the Tomb of the Prophet at Medina, he proceeds on to Mekka once more, and takes up his quarters for the next nine years in the precincts of the Ka\u2019abah.\n\nIn the beginning of A.H. 857 we find him back in Cairo, occupying a position of trust in the household of one of the nobles who attended the court of the Maml\u00fbk Sultans. It had always been Suy\u00fbt\u00ee\u2019s wish to visit Jerusalem, and thus complete his acquaintance with the Holy Cities of Isl\u00e2m; when, therefore, his patron was sent on a diplomatic mission to Aleppo, he agreed to accompany him, in the hopes that\nfrom Aleppo they might return to Egypt, taking the Holy City on their way. Matters, however, fell out differently, and it was only many years later, in A.H. 874, when he again found himself at Damascus, that he was able to carry out his long-deferred purpose of joining the caravan that was going south to Jerusalem; he reached the Holy City in the month of Ramadan of that same year (A.D. 1470). At Jerusalem he wrote the work which is the subject of the present paper, the title of which, *Ith\u0101f al Akhiss\u0101 fi fadd\u0101l al Masjid al Aks\u0101*, may be rendered 'A Gift for Intimates concerning the Merits of the Aks\u0101 Mosque.'\n\nAlthough there is no manner of doubt as to our author's identity, his age, and the salient incidents of his biography, some confusion, it must be allowed, exists as to his precise name. One of the British Museum MSS.\\(^1\\) calls him Shaikh Ibrahim, while in another\\(^2\\) he is Muhammad as Suy\u016bt\u012b; and to render this matter still more puzzling, Hajji Khalfa, in his Bibliographical Dictionary (ed. by Fluegel, No. 42), gives the name of the author of the *Ith\u0101f* as \"Kam\u0101l ad D\u012bn Muhammad ibn Abu Shar\u012bf,\" while the title-page of one of the Paris MSS.\\(^3\\) calls him Al Minh\u0101j\u012b as Suy\u016bt\u012b. The point, however, is after all of no great importance, the notable fact being that our Suy\u016bt\u012b has nothing whatever to do with the great commentator Jal\u0101l ad D\u012bn \u2019Abd ar Rahman as Suy\u016bt\u012b, who was only born a year after our author, already of man's estate, was making his pilgrimage to Mekka.\n\nTurning now from the man to his work, which, as before noted, Suy\u016bt\u012b compiled during his sojourn in the Holy City, the MSS. all coincide in dividing it into seventeen chapters preceded by an introduction, in which the author recounts the main incidents of his life, and, in conclusion, notes the names of the books on which he has mainly depended for his materials. The most frequently quoted are the following:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) B.M. Add. 7326.\n\\(^2\\) Add. 7327.\n\\(^3\\) Suppl. Arabe, 919. In the two other Paris MSS. (Arabe, 836, 838) he is called Kam\u0101l ad D\u012bn Muhammad ibn Abi Shar\u012bf.\nI.

Of this work I was happy to find three excellent MSS. in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris.\u00b9 From the author's own statement in his preface, we learn that the Muth\u00eer was written at Jerusalem in A.H. 752 (A.D. 1351). Of the writer's personal history all we know is that he was born in A.H. 714 (A.D. 1314), that he gave lectures in the Tenkezieh College at Jerusalem, and that he died at Cairo in A.H. 765 (A.D. 1364).\u00b2\n\nOn comparing the Muth\u00eer with Suy\u00fbti's work, I found that what were, to me, the most interesting portions of the latter, namely those relating to points of archaeological, topographical, and historical interest, had been simply copied verbatim et literatim by Suy\u00fbti (A.D. 1470) from the Muth\u00eer (A.D. 1351), and further that Muj\u00eer ad D\u00een (whose description of Jerusalem was written in A.D. 1494) had to all appearance merely copied these same sections of the Muth\u00eer from Suy\u00fbti. The Muth\u00eer, therefore, as the earliest authority I have come upon for many of the more remarkable accounts in Suy\u00fbti, has seemed to me worthy of special attention, and as the MSS. of the Muth\u00eer are rare, I have not hesitated to print the text of certain chapters or portions of chapters of the Muth\u00eer which Suy\u00fbti has taken. Before, however, passing on to other authorities quoted by Suy\u00fbti, it may be worth while to give in briefest summary the contents of the Paris MSS. of the Muth\u00eer. The work is divided into two parts.\n\n\u00b9 Anciens fonds, Nos. 716, 841, 842. I may here take occasion to express my grateful thanks to the authorities of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, and to Monsieur Delisle, the Director, in particular, for the liberal manner in which, under a guarantee from our Embassy, he allowed me to borrow MSS., and carry them off to my own house for copying. I must also add my cordial acknowledgment of the favour extended to me by the Director of the Royal Library of Munich, who during the vacation, when the library is generally closed to the public, gave me free use of the many treasures that are stored on its shelves.\n\n\u00b2 W\u00fcstenfeld, Geschichtschreiber der Araber, No. 425. Hajji Khalfa, No. 11372.\nThe first treats of the many excellences of Syria, the limits of the province, the origin of the name, the political division into districts, and is followed by a quotation of those verses of the Kur\u0101n which celebrate its praise. The second part treats of the many excellences of the Ak\u1e63a Mosque and what pertains thereto, in particular and in general, from the date of its first foundation. An account is given of its building, and what may be found therein of wonders and remains of former days. It is from this portion of the work that I have printed the extracts relating to Omar's visit to the Noble Sanctuary, when it was yet covered by an enormous dung-hill of refuse thrown here by the Christians; also the chapter giving an account of the building of the Dome of the Rock by 'Abd al Malik, and the service for the same instituted by him. These accounts, as they now stand, date from A.D. 1350, fully six centuries from 'Abd al Malik's days, and over seven hundred years from those of Omar; also, I must confess, that they seem to me extremely apocryphal. The source from which they are derived is to me quite unknown. I have given the text as found in the Muthir\u2014which, as before noted, has been copied in turn by both Suy\u016b\u1e6di and Muj\u012br ad D\u012bn\u2014it being the earliest version with which I am acquainted. The story of Omar's conquest and visit, and 'Abd al Malik's building of the Dome of the Rock, as given by the Muslim Annalists, from Tabari down to Ibn al Ath\u012br, is confined to a simple statement of the facts, and is devoid of all the details which abound in the present text. Possibly in the Muthir we have another specimen of the romantic history-books which Isl\u0101m produced during the age of the Crusade, and of which the pseudo-W\u0101kidi set so agreeable an example.\u00b9 The Muthir concludes by a section filled with short biographical notices of the various Prophets, Saints, Patriarchs, and following them the most notable of\n\n\u00b9 The Byzantine historian George Theophanes (died A.D. 818) is generally quoted as the authority for what may be called 'the Christian tradition' of the events of Omar's conquest. Is it possible that his work, translated into Arabic, may have been the source, direct or indirect, of the very circumstantial account furnished by the Muthir, which agrees in many points with the narrative of Theophanes.\nthe Muslim worthies, who visited the Holy City. I may add that from this section Muj\u00eer ad D\u00een has also freely plagiarised, and most of the biographical notices found in his work are taken verbatim from the Muth\u00eer.\n\nII. A second work, also bearing the name of *Muth\u00eer al Ghar\u00e2m*, is bound up with the first Muth\u00eer in the MSS. 716 and 842 of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. It is the 'Muth\u00eer al Ghar\u00e2m li ziy\u00e2rat al Khal\u00eel,' The Exciter of Desire to the Visitation of (the city of) the Friend (of Allah, that is, Hebron). It was written by Abu'l Fid\u00e2 Ish\u00e2k al Khal\u00eeli (of Hebron), whose family had originally come from Tadm\u00fbr (Palmyra), and hence Suy\u00fbt\u00ee, who states in his preface that this work is his chief authority for all that relates to Hebron and the Tombs of the Patriarchs, quotes him under the name of Tadm\u00fbr\u00ee. He died in A.H. 833 (A.D. 1430). The account he gives of an alleged visit to the Sepulchres of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Cave of Machpelah, is copied by both Suy\u00fbt\u00ee and Muj\u00eer ad D\u00een, and though legendary enough in its present form, is perhaps founded on fact. I have therefore thought it worth while to translate the account in full, more especially as Mr. Reynolds' version leaves much to be desired in point of accuracy.\n\nIII. An authority whose name occurs on every other of Suy\u00fbt\u00ee's pages is Ibn 'As\u00e2kir. This is not the celebrated 'Ali ibn 'As\u00e2kir who wrote the 'Chronicle of Damascus,' but his son Bah\u00e2 ad D\u00een. The latter spent most of his literary lifetime editing his father's works, and died in A.H. 600 (A.D. 1204) at Damascus. His book 'On the Excellences of the Ak\u00eed Mosque' (Kit\u00e2b al Uns fi fad\u00e2il al Kuds), which Suy\u00fbt\u00ee speaks of in his preface, and frequently quotes, contains, in collected form, the lectures which he gave in the Mosque at Jerusalem during the year 596 A.H. Unfortunately I have not been able to learn that any MSS. of this work exist in our libraries.\n\n---\n\n1 W\u00fcst. cp. cit. No. 267.\n2 W\u00fcst.

The earliest specimen of the Arab mosque consisted of an open courtyard, within which, round its four walls, run colonades or cloisters to give shelter to the worshippers. On the side of the court towards the Kiblah (in the direction of Mekka), and facing which the worshipper must stand, the colonade, instead of being single, is, for the convenience of the increased numbers of the congregation, widened out to form the J\u0101mi\u2018 or place of assembly. Three rows of columns with the boundary wall will here form three transverse aisles. In the centre of the boundary wall on the Mekka side is set the great Mihr\u0101b of the mosque, indicating the direction of the Kiblah; and in all descriptions of a mosque it is taken for granted that the visitor is facing the Kiblah, and is standing in the court (Sahn) of the mosque. Fronting him therefore is what is called the covered part (al Mughatt\u0101) or the fore part (al Mukaddamah) of the mosque; while in his rear is the colonade against the wall of the courtyard, furthest from the Mekka side, and this is called the hinder part of the mosque (al Mu-\u0101khirah). Bearing these points in mind, and coming now to the Noble Sanctuary at Jerusalem, we must remember that the term 'Masjid' belongs not only to the Aksa mosque (more properly the J\u0101mi\u2018 or place of assembly for prayer), but to the whole enclosure with the Dome of the Rock in the middle, and all the other minor domes and\nchapels. As M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 has pointed out, the Dome of the Rock is not itself a mosque or place for public prayer, but merely the largest of the many cupolas in the court of the mosque, intended merely to cover and do honour to the Holy Rock which lies beneath it.\n\nGreat confusion is introduced into the Arab descriptions of the Noble Sanctuary by the loose manner in which they apply the terms al Masjid or Masjid al Aksa, J\u0101mi\u2018 or J\u0101mi\u2018 al Aksa. The late Professor Palmer laid down what is the rule with great clearness, and I cannot do better than quote his words, premising that in point of fact nothing but an intimate acquaintance with the locality described will prevent a translator ever and again misunderstanding the text he has before him, since the native authorities use the technical terms in an extraordinarily inexact manner, confounding the whole, and its part, under a single denomination. Professor Palmer writes\u00b9: \u201cWhen the Masjid el Aksa is mentioned, that name is usually supposed to refer to the well-known mosque on the south side of the Haram, but such is not really the case. The latter building is called El J\u0101mi\u2018 el Aksa, or simply El Aksa, and the substructures are called El Aksa el Kadimeh (the ancient Aksa), while the title El Masjid el Aksa is applied to the whole Sanctuary. The word J\u0101mi\u2018 is exactly equivalent in sense to the Greek \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae, and is applied only to the church or building in which the worshippers congregate. Masjid, on the other hand, is a much more general term; it is derived from the verb sejada \u2018to adore,\u2019 and is applied to any spot the sacred character of which would especially incite the visitor to an act of devotion.\u201d\n\nIn the present texts, however, the word Masjid is so constantly used to denote not only the whole Haram area, but also the main building or covered part, the J\u0101mi\u2018 or Aksa Mosque proper, at its southern extremity, that I have thought it better to translate al Masjid by \u2018the Haram Area,\u2019 or \u2018the\n\n\u00b9 p. 84 of Jerusalem, the City of Herod and Saladin, by W. Besant and E. H. Palmer. London, 1871.\nNoble Sanctuary,' in the one case, and by 'the Aksa Mosque' in the other, that the matter might be perfectly clear to European readers. It may at the same time be added that Muslim authorities speak in the same loose way of \"the Rock,\" when they mean \"the Dome of the Rock\" (Kubbat as Sakhrah), which covers the same; but this, after all, is only as we speak of the \"Holy Sepulchre,\" meaning \"the Church,\" which is built to cover it.\n\nIn concluding these preliminary remarks, which I regret have taken up more space than I had originally intended, I would add that I have given a few quotations from Mr. Reynolds' translation in my notes, from no motives of self-glorification, or invidious comparison, but only since I deemed it necessary to show cause for undertaking to re-translate the passages which it seemed to me were of greater importance. That my own new translation will be found incorrect and imperfect in many parts, by those who, being better scholars than I am, will take the trouble to examine the texts, is a matter on which I am under no illusion; but Mr. Reynolds' translation is too incorrect to stand unchallenged, and unfortunately many passages from his rendering of the misnamed 'Jal\u00e2l ad D\u00een' have been quoted in standard works and books of reference, notably in M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9's most excellent work, 'Le Temple de J\u00e9rusalem,' and in the useful compilation called 'The Dictionary of Isl\u00e2m' (Allen & Co.) written by Mr. Hughes. The late Professor Palmer was, I believe, one of the first to draw attention to the very incorrect nature of Mr. Reynolds' work, but how much this is the case readers may now judge of for themselves by looking through the quotations which I have given at the foot of many of the pages of my translation. After all, I fear that in so thorny a matter I had best quote, as applying to my own work, the proverb Traduttore traditore.\nREFERENCES TO THE PLAN.\n\nA.

Of the prayer that he prayed after the completion of the building for the sakes of all who should enter therein, and also of the place of his praying.\u00b2\n\nIt is also related that Solomon\u00b3\u2014God's prophet\u2014when he had finished the building (of the Temple) sacrificed 3000 heifers and 7000 ewes at the place which is in the after (or northern) part of the Haram area, in the vicinity of the B\u0101b al Asb\u0101t (the Gate of the Tribes).

From the entrance down into the Cave lead stone steps descending. On these stairs is a small shelf, near where the pilgrims stop to visit the Tongue of the Rock. At this spot is a marble column, the lower part of which rests on the south portion of the shelf aforesaid, while its upper part abuts against the Rock, as though to prevent its giving way towards the south,\u2014or may be it is for some other purpose,\u2014and the Rock that lies below supports it. The Place of the Angel's Fingers is on the western side of the Rock, and is distinct from the Place of the Noble Footstep mentioned above. It lies close to, and over against, the western gate of the Sakhrah (or Dome of the Rock).\u00b9\n\nChapter IV.\n\nOn the excellence of prayer in the Holy City and its counting for double there. And whether or not this doubling of the effect of prayer extends to the obligatory prayers as well as to those of supererogation. Also whether this doubling of the effect would include good actions as well as bad. Also of the excellence of almsgiving, and of fasting in Jerusalem; and of the calling to prayer, and of watching there for the new moon of the months of the greater and the lesser Pilgrimage. Also the excellence of providing oil for the illumination of the M\u0101jid, and how so doing may stand in the place of actual visitation thereunto for those to whom even intention so to do is an impossibility.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 How Mr. Reynolds has translated this curious, though not very important, passage may be seen by those who care to refer to his pages. Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b's description corresponds exactly with what is shown at the present day. The \"Footprint\" is that of the Prophet (in Crusading times it was called \"Christ's Footprint\"), when he mounted the steed Al Bur\u0101k to ascend into heaven. The \"Tongue\" was given to the rock when it addressed the Khalif Omar in welcome; and the marks of the angel Gabriel's \"Fingers\" are those left when the Rock, wishing to accompany the Prophet to heaven, had to be pushed down and kept in its place. All this is of course only interesting as showing how early these legends took their rise.\n\n\u00b2 Reynolds, p. 54. As a specimen of how Mr. Reynolds does work, his version of the above heading may be quoted: Upon the surpassing efficacy of Prayer in the Baitu-l-Mukaddas, and how it becomes double. Also upon the New Moon of Reduplication, when by prayer the Sacred Precept, and the merits of Works of Supererogation may be diffused to the public. Also the New Moon of Reduplication, when blessings and cursings may be communicated. Also the marvellous effect of pious donations, and fastings and listening to preaching therein. Also the New Moons of the Sacred Pilgrimage and the Sacred Visitation. Also the marvellous efficacy of supplying Oil for the Lamps, and how by this the rank and merit of pilgrimage may be made to exist for those who are unable to undertake the journey.\nChapter V.\n\nAn account of the water which flows out from the foundation of the Rock, and how the same is a river of the rivers of Paradise, and how it is cut short in the midst of the Masjid on every side, whereby none may draw of this water except such as the heavens draw up\u2014by His permission\u2014to pour down again on the earth. And of the good of entering this place, and how he who prays there is answered, and how he who would enter thereto should proceed, and what prayers are to be avoided by him who prays over that place. Also an account of the Chain which hung there in early times, and the cause of its removal, and description of the Black Slab of rock which is over the Gate of Paradise, and how prayer thereon is answered, and the invocation of the prayer that brings aid.\u00b9\n\nChapter VI.\n\nAccount of the night journey of the Prophet to the Holy City, and his ascension into Heaven therefrom. Concerning the excellence of the five prayers. Concerning the excellence of the Dome of the Ascension and of prayer therein; and in the Prayer Station of the Prophet and the excellence of the Dome over the same; and of the Prophet Muhammad's praying therein with former Prophets and Angels on the night of his Night Journey. And of the great worth of both these noble Domes and of prayer therein and of continual adoration there. Also of the great worthiness of almsgiving in the place wherefrom the Prophet ascended, and in his Prayer Station, and of the invocation of the prayer that brings aid.\u00b2\n\nThe\u00b3 Dome named the Dome of the Prophet is, as I understand it, the one which lies to the east of the Sakhrah, being also called the Dome of the Chain.\u2074 It was built by the Khalif \u2019Abd al Malik, as will be described later on. . . .

The other dome stands back at the Gate of the Noble Sanctuary, on the northern side, near the Gate of the Glory of the Prophets,\\footnote{See Plan, C. and X.

It is called the Dome of Sulaim\u00e2n,\u2014not after the Prophet Solomon,\u2014but perhaps after the Khal\u00eef Sulaim\u00e2n, the son of \u2019Abd al Malik. As to the Dome of the Ascension, it is, as everybody knows, on the Terrace of the Sakhrah, and much visited by the pilgrims.\\footnote{Plan, d.}\n\nHence, therefore, it is likely that what Al Musharraf, and the author of the Mustaks\u00e2, and of the B\u00e2\u2019ith an Nufus\\footnote{See above, p. 253, VII. and VIII.} refer to when speaking of the Dome of the Prophet is that now known as the Dome of the Chain, which was built by the Khal\u00eef \u2019Abd al Malik. Now as to the place where the Prophet prayed in the company of Prophets and Angels, it is said that the spot is beside the Dome of the Ascension where, on the Terrace of the Sakhrah, there used to stand a beautiful Dome. When, however, they flagged the court (Sahn) of the Sakhrah, they did away with this Dome, and set in its place a handsome Mihr\u00e2b,\\footnote{Or Prayer Niche, showing the direction of Mekka. At e. of the Plan.} the floor of which is laid in a circle with red marble flags after the manner of other parts of the Sakhrah Court. This, then, as it is said, in the place occupied by this Mihr\u00e2b, is where the Prophet made his prayer with the Angels and Prophets. He then advanced a step forward from that place, and there rose before him a ladder of gold and a ladder of silver, and thereby was the Ascent into Heaven, as will be found described elsewhere.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nAccount of the walls surrounding the Noble Sanctuary; and what is found within the same of Mihr\u00e2bs, that are objects of visitation and wherein prayer should be said: such as the Mihr\u00e2b D\u00e2ud, and the Mihr\u00e2b Zakariyy\u00e2 and the Mihr\u00e2b Maryam\u2014upon her be peace\u2014and the Mihr\u00e2bs (of the Khalife) Omar ibn al Khatt\u00e2b and Mu\u2018awiyah. Also what pertains to the gates, and what is their number. Also an account of the stones that are at the gate of the Haram Area. Also the measurement of the Haram Area in its length and breadth, and the Tradition of the Leaves, and an account of the W\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum which lies beyond the wall on the eastern side thereof, and what is found therein. Also the dwellings of Al Khidr and of Iliy\u00e2 near that spot.\u00b9\n\nNow as regards the wall that surrounds the Noble Sanctuary of the Aksa Mosque, and compasses it on all sides, verily its foundations were laid by David when he built the Temple. . . .\n\nThe Mihr\u00e2bs\u00b2 worthy of visitation, which lie within the Noble Sanctuary, are the following, and in them prayer should be said.\n\nThe Mihr\u00e2b D\u00e2ud (of David).\u2014There is diversity of opinion as to its identification. Some say it is the great Mihr\u00e2b,\u00b3 which is in the south wall of the Haram area; others, that it is the great Mihr\u00e2b in the neighbourhood of the Mimbar (or pulpit of the Aksa mosque).\u2074 The author of the work called \u2018al Fath al Kudsi\u2019\u2075 asserts that the Mihr\u00e2b of David is in the castle (H\u00ee\u1e63n) of the Holy City, in the place where David stood to pray. For his dwelling being in the castle, there also was his place of worship. Now the Mihr\u00e2b, whereof mention, by Allah, is made in the Kur\u00e2\u00een in the words (xxxviii. 20), \u201cWhen they mounted the wall of the\n\n\u00b9 Reynolds, p. 120.\n\u00b2 Reynolds, p. 122. A Mihr\u00e2b is a prayer niche; the mihr\u00e2b of a mosque is the special niche which indicates the direction of Mekka (the Kiblah), towards which the Muslim faces when saying his prayers. Besides the great mihr\u00e2b, there may be numerous other prayer niches, or chapels, in other parts of the sacred precincts, dedicated to the memory of individual saints and prophets, whose intercession is deemed of efficacy in the granting of prayers.\n\u00b3 See Plan, q.\n\u2074 See Plan, i.\n\u2075 \u2018The Conquest of Jerusalem,\u2019 a name common to many works.\nMihr\u00e1b,\" is generally admitted to be the Mihr\u00e1b of David, where he prayed, and it was situated in the Castle, that being his place of worship; while the spot known as the great Mihr\u00e1b, which is inside the Haram area,\u00b9 is looked upon as the place where he prayed when he came into the Haram. When Omar came thither, he followed in David's steps, and made his prayer in the place where David had prayed. Hence the place came to be called the Mihr\u00e1b of Omar, from the fact of his having prayed there, for the first time, on the day of the capitulation of Jerusalem; but originally it had been named the Mihr\u00e1b of David. In confirmation of this is the fact of Omar's veneration of this spot. For when he asked of Ka'ab,\u00b2 \"Which place wishest thou that we should institute as the place of our prayer in this Sacred Area?\"\u2014and Ka'ab had answered, \"In the hinder part thereof, where it may be near the Sakhrah, so that the two Kiblahs\u00b3 be united,\"\u2014Omar had said, \"O Abu Ishak, so thou wouldst act still in Jew fashion? Are we not the people to whom the fore part of the Holy Area belongs as of right?\" Then Omar marked out the Mihr\u00e1b, which had been that of David, and where had been his place of worship in the Haram Area. Thus Omar's opinion, and his veneration for this spot, both confirm the view that David in ancient times\n\n\u00b9 At q or h.\n\u00b2 \"Ka'ab al Ahbar (or al Hibr), surnamed Abu Ish\u00e2k ibn M\u00e2ni' al Himyari, was originally a Jew, and became a Muslim during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr (some say during that of Omar). He is a celebrated authority for traditions, and is noted as having been a very learned man. He died at Hims in A.H. 32.\" So says the author of the Muthir, who devotes a few lines to his biography when enumerating the eminent persons who visited or lived at Jerusalem. In point of fact, Ka'ab (like his co-religionist the celebrated Jew Wahb ibn Munabbih, who also embraced Islam, both of them becoming the great authorities among the early Muslims in all matters of ancient history), was in time discovered to have been a great liar.\n\u00b3 The two Kiblahs are the Kiblah of Moses, the Rock on which was placed the Ark of the Covenant, and the Muslim Kiblah, which is Mekka. In the early days of the Hijra, after the Prophet had fled to Medina, and for a time had thoughts of abandoning Mekka and its Kaaba, he directed his followers to pray facing in the direction of Jerusalem. The Kiblah of Islam had therefore been for seventeen months (i.e., down to Rajab A.H. 2) identical with that of the Jews. Had Omar accepted the suggestion of Ka'ab, and placed the mosque on the northern side of the Haram area, the Muslim Kiblah, which in Jerusalem points south, would in the mosque have faced the Rock, which thus would have been in front of the Muslim who was turning towards Mekka. As the Aksa Mosque now stands, those who pray there turn their back on the Rock.\nhad fixed on this place and had chosen the same as his place of prayer.\n\nThe Mihr\u00e1b of Zakariyy\u00e1 (Zacharias).\u2014Most agree that it is that within the (A\u1e33\u1e63\u0101) mosque in the aisle (riw\u0101k), near the eastern door.\u00b9\n\nThe Mihr\u00e1b of Maryam (Mary).\u2014This is the place where she was wont to worship. It is now called the Cradle of Jesus (Mahd \u2019Is\u0101).\u00b2 It is notorious how prayer offered up here is granted. . . .\n\nThe Mihr\u00e1b of Omar.\u2014People differ as to which this may be. Some say it is the great Mihr\u00e1b, close to which now stands the Noble Pulpit (mimbar), and fronting the Great Gate, through which you enter the A\u1e33\u1e63\u0101 Mosque.\u00b3 Others say that it is the Mihr\u00e1b in the eastern aisle of the A\u1e33\u1e63\u0101 Mosque, being in the (south) wall of the mosque,\u2074 seeing this said aisle with its adjacent parts is called the Jami\u2018 of Omar, and that this is the very place which he cleared of filth, he and those who were with him of the Companions, and swept clean before they prayed thereon. Whence it is called the Jami\u2018 of Omar. Most, however, are of the opinion before mentioned, namely, that the Mihr\u00e1b of Omar is the great Mihr\u00e1b near the Mimbar (Pulpit). Further mention of all this and explanation will be given later on, in Chapter IX., relating the conquest of the Holy City, and Omar\u2019s entry therein on the day of the capitulation.\n\nThe Mihr\u00e1b of Mu\u2018\u0101ciyah.\u2014This is said to be the beautiful Mihr\u00e1b, which is, at the present time, enclosed within the Maks\u016brah (the part railed off) for the preacher of the Khutbah (or Friday sermon).\u2075 Between it and the great Mihr\u00e1b comes the beautiful pulpit aforementioned.\n\nWithin the Aksa Mosque, and also without the same in\n\n\u00b9 In the Muslim legend \u201cZacharias, the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar\u201d (Math. xxiv. 35), and Zachariah, the son of Jehoiada, the priest who was \u201cstoned with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord\u201d (II. Chron. xxiv. 22), and Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, are all one. The Mihr\u00e1b Zakariyy\u00e1 is still pointed out at l. on the Plan.\n\n\u00b2 See Plan, p.\n\n\u00b3 See Plan, h.\n\n\u2074 See Plan, k.\n\n\u2075 That is to the west of i. on the Plan.\nthe Haram Area, but still within the boundary-wall, are many other Mihr\u00e2bs. These have been erected by people of various ranks, to mark venerated spots. As, for example, where a certain person may have seen in his dream that one of the Prophets had made his prayer, or where perchance some one of the Saints had appeared. All these are worthy of visit. Among them is the spot cleft by the angel Gabriel, and where he tied up the steed Al Bur\u00e2k. It lies outside the B\u00e2b an Nabi (the Prophet\u2019s Gate).\u00b9 . . . There are, too, the stones which lie in the after (or northern) part of the Haram Area, in the neighbourhood of the B\u00e2b al Asb\u00e2t (the Gate of the Tribes); and near these is the place called Solomon\u2019s Throne, where he prayed when he had brought to completion the building of the Temple\u2014as has been described in a former chapter\u00b2\u2014and Allah there was wont to grant his prayers. Verily it is very worthy to make visitation of all these Mihr\u00e2bs and places.\n\nNow as regards the gates in the walls of the Noble Sanctuary.\n\nThe B\u00e2b ar Rahmah (the Gate of Mercy).\u2014This lies to the east of the Aksa Mosque, and is in the wall of which Allah has made mention in the words\u00b3\u2014\"But between them (the Hypocrites and the Believers on the judgment day) shall be set a wall with a gateway, within which shall be the Mercy, and in front, without it, the Torment.\" The valley which lies beyond this gate is the W\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum.\u2074 The Gate of Mercy itself is inside the wall which encloses the Haram Area;\u2075 and the gate referred to in the above verse of the Kuran, as on the W\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum, is now closed,\u2076 and will only be opened at some future time and by the will of Allah\u2014be He exalted.\n\n\u00b9 Plan, K.\n\u00b2 Plan, V, and see above, p. 258, Chapter II.\n\u00b3 Kur\u00e2n lvii. 13.\n\u2074 The Muslim W\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum is not the Jewish Valley of Hinnon, or Gehenna, for that is the valley to the south-east of Jerusalem, which the Arabs call W\u00e2d\u00ee ar Rab\u00e2bi. The W\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum is the K\u00eadron or Valley of Jehoshaphat, and according to Muslim tradition will be the place of the Last Judgment. This agrees with the Jewish traditions about the 'Valley of Jehoshaphat derived from Joel iii. 2.\n\u2075 Plan, O.\n\u2076 Plan, P.\nAnd as to Bab at Taubah (the Gate of Repentance), it joins and makes one with the Gate of Mercy,\\(^1\\) but through neither of them at the present day do men pass. Near the Gate of Repentance, and thus between the Gate of Mercy and the Gate of the Tribes, is the House (Maskin) of Al Khidr and Ilyas.\\(^2\\)\n\nBab al Asb\u00e2t (the Gate of the Tribes) is in the hinder (or northern) part of the Haram Area, not far from the House of Al Khidr and Ilyas. In the work called Fa\u1e0d\u0101il Bait al Mukaddas (The Excellences of the Holy City) by the H\u0101fid Abu Bakr al W\u0101siti, the Khatib, there is mention made of the B\u0101b Maskin al Khidr (the Gate of Al Khidr\u2019s House), as standing here, but the author of the Muthir al Ghar\u0101m gives no indication of any such gate having existed, although he mentions the House of Al Khidr when enumerating the saints who entered and dwelt in the Holy City. The author of the Kit\u0101b al Uns, on the authority of Shahr ibn Jaushab, states that the House of Al Khidr is in the Holy City at a spot between the Gate of Mercy and the Gate of the Tribes; and he continues that Al Khidr was wont to pray every Friday in five different mosques, namely, in the Mosque of Mekka, and the Mosque of Medina, and the Mosque of Jerusalem, and the Mosque of Kub\u0101, and on every Friday night in the Mosque of Sinai.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The two Gates of Mercy and Repentance together form the great tower in the east wall of the Haram Area, generally known as the Golden Gate (Plan, N. and O.). According to M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 (Le Temple de J\u00e9rusalem, p. 68), the architecture of this building shows it to date from Byzantine times only, in fact probably as late as the sixth century A.D. The denomination of the Golden Gate does not occur apparently before the thirteenth century (Sawwufi), and the name Porta Aurea is due to a misunderstanding by medieval pilgrims whose knowledge of Greek was rudimentary of \u1f18\u03cc\u03c0\u03b1 \u1f10\u03c3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7, the gate called \u201cBeautiful,\u201d mentioned in Acts iii. 2, as the spot where St. Peter healed the lame man. The site of this miracle, which must in point of fact have taken place at one of the inner gates of the Temple, the early pilgrims and the Crusaders, proceeding in their usual arbitrary manner, saw fit to locate at this Byzantine structure.\n\n\\(^2\\) St. George and Elias.

Reynolds (p. 127) translates \u201cand the Mosque of Kissa (near Larissa) and the Mosque of Tyre.\u201d Kiss\u0101 is certainly a false reading, all the MSS. giving Kub\u0101, and though Masjid at T\u00fcr may be taken to mean either the Mosque of Sinai or the Mosque of Kebr T\u00fcr, the village crowning the Mount of Olives, \u2018T\u00fcr\u2019 is certainly not \u2018Tyre,\u2019 which is called \u2018S\u00fbr\u2019 by the Arabs.\nB\u0101b Hittah \\(^1\\) (the Gate of Remission), so called because the Children of Israel were directed to enter their House of Prayer thereby, saying, \u2018Remission, O Lord, for our sins.\u2019 . . .\n\nThe following is given on the authority of \u2019Ali ibn Sall\u00e2m ibn \u2019Abd as Sall\u00e2m,\u2014who was told by his father that he had heard Abu Muhammad ibn \u2019Abd as Sall\u00e2m state as follows, namely, that the brazen gate (al b\u0101b an nah\u0101s), which is in the (Aksa) Mosque, is the B\u0101b al Hamal al Ausat (the middle Ram Gate), and is of the workmanship of the Chosroes; and that the brazen gate which closes the (main) gateway \\(^2\\) of the Haram Area is the Gate of David through which he was wont to go from Sion to Solomon\u2019s Market Place; while the gate of the gateway known as the B\u0101b Hittah (Gate of Remission) was formerly at Jericho, which city having come to ruin, the gate was transported thence to the Noble Sanctuary. . . .\n\nB\u0101b Sharaf al Anbiy\u0101 \\(^3\\) (the Gate of the Glory of the Prophets) is that now called B\u0101b ad Dawid\u00e2riyyah.\\(^4\\) It opens from the northern side of the Haram Area.\n\nB\u0101b al Ghaw\u00e2nimah (the Gate of the men of the family of Gh\u00e2nim),\\(^5\\) is that adjoining the Lieutenant\u2019s Palace (the D\u00e2r an Niy\u00e2bah). It is the first (or northernmost) on the western side of the Haram Area. Anciently, it is said, this gate was called B\u0101b al Khal\u00eel (the Gate of Abraham).\n\nB\u0101b an N\u00e2thir (the Gate of the Inspector).\\(^6\\)\u2014This is a gate that is said never to have been restored.

Anciently it was called after Argh\u016bn al K\u0101mili, who founded the Madrasah (College) of the Argh\u016bniyyah, which lies on the left hand as you go out through it.\n\nB\u0101b al Katt\u0101nin (the Gate of the Cotton Merchants).\u2014It is one of those that has been restored. Al Malik an N\u0101sir ibn Kal\u0101\u016bn was the prince who first built it, but it afterwards fell into complete ruin and disuse. When the late N\u0101ib (Lieutenant) of Syria, Tankiz an N\u0101siri, built the Colonade (riw\u0101k) which runs all along the western wall of the Noble Sanctuary, and the S\u016bk al Katt\u0101nin (the Cotton Market), he rebuilt at the same time this gate with the high portal seen here at the present day.\n\nB\u0101b as Sikk\u0101yah (the Gate of the Reservoir).\u2014It is said to be an ancient gate, but it had come to be destroyed. When the late \u2019Al\u0101 ad din Al Bu\u1e63\u012br\u012b constructed the Tank of Absolution, which he gave the people, he rebuilt too this gate. May it not be allowed to fall again into ruin!\n\nB\u0101b as Sakinah (the Gate of the Shechinah or Divine Presence).\u2014This lies near the Gate of the Madrasah (College), called Al Baladiyyah; and close by it also is the Southern Minaret. The royal College, called Al Madrasah al Ashrafiyyah, lies to the north of it.\n\nB\u0101b as Silsilah (the Gate of the Chain) and the B\u0101b as Sakinah are side by side. The B\u0101b as Silsilah was anciently called the B\u0101b D\u0101\u016bd (David\u2019s Gate).\n\n1 Plan, F.\n2 Argh\u016bn al K\u0101mili was Lieutenant of Syria.

He died in A.H. 782 (A.D. 1380).\n7 The Madrasah Ashrafiyyah was founded by the Maml\u016bk Sult\u0101n Kait Bey in A.H. 885 (A.D. 1491). It stood apparently within the wall of the Haram Area.\n8 Mutta\u1e25id\u016bn, some MSS. may read Mustajidd\u016bn, which would mean \u2018restored.\u2019 It would appear, however, that the first is the better reading, and that the two portals, that of the Chain and that of the Shechinah, were so close to one another as to form but a single gateway; as is the case at the present day at I. in the Plan.\nB\u0101b al Magh\u0101ribeh (the Gate of the Mogrebins or Westerns).\u2014So called from its being in the neighbourhood of the gate of the Mosque of the Mogrebins, where they have their prayers. And the quarter named from this gate lies at the south-eastern corner of the Haram Area. This gate is also called B\u0101b an Nabi (the Gate of the Prophet).\n\nNow as to what has been said on the subject of the Noble Sanctuary, and its length and its breadth, the author of the Muth\u012br al Ghar\u0101m has devoted thereto one of his chapters, giving therein all that is known as to what the Khalif \u2019Abd al M\u0101lik and others built in the Haram Area, and the same is his seventh chapter. It is stated by Ibn \u2019As\u0101kir that the length of the Haram Area is 755 ells (dh\u012br\u0101'), and its breadth 465 ells, the ell being the royal ell (dh\u012br\u0101' al Malik). And, continues the author of the Muth\u012br al Ghar\u0101m, so also writes Abu'l Ma'\u0101li al Musharraf in his book. Now I myself, in old times, have seen in the northern wall of the Haram Area, above the gateway which adjoins the Dawid\u0101riyyah, and on the inner side of the wall, a slab on which was inscribed the length and the breadth of the Haram Area, and it differed from what these two have stated. And what was inscribed on it\n\n1 Plan, K.\n2 Plan, T.\n3 These paragraphs, showing how the gates of the Noble Sanctuary stood in the middle of the fifteenth century A.D., are not without interest, and Suy\u016bti's account has been copied by subsequent compilers; as, for instance Mujir ad Din. To show how little Mr. Reynolds' translation can be relied on, I copy his version of the foregoing paragraphs (p. 134): \"The Gate of the Glorious Prophets is now called the Gate al Dawid\u0101ri (the Gate of the Templars); it is on the western side, but itself is in a northern direction. The Gate of the Sheep is west of the Gate of the Guard, on the front side of the Mosque. This gate is called the Antechapel of Abraham. The Gate of the Conqueror is said to be the same as the Gate of the Jealousy-search; it is now called Angel's Gate, because Gabriel is said to have bound Al Bur\u0101k there.\" And in a note to this farrago of nonsense he adds: \"Several gates are enumerated in the original, which, as possessing no interest, are omitted.\"\n4 The text of this chapter of the Muthir is given in extenso, p. 303.\n5 The Dh\u012br\u0101' al Malik, the royal ell or cubit, differs from the Dh\u012br\u0101' al 'Amm or common ell, in that the latter contains six Kabdah (or fists), while the royal ell contains seven. The royal ell was instituted by one of the ancient Chosroes of Persia (Lane, s.v. Dh\u012br\u0101').\n6 See p. 253.\n7 Plan, at C.\nwas: length 784 ells, breadth 455 ells.' The author of the Muth\u00eer continues: 'it gives in the inscription the indication of the ell used, but I am not sure whether this is the ell mentioned above (i.e. the royal ell) or some other, for the inscription has become indistinct.' The author of the Muth\u00eer further states that 'the Haram Area was measured in his days with a rope, and that along the eastern wall it measured 683 ells, and along the western wall 650 ells, while in the breadth (i.e. along the northern and the southern walls) it measured 438 ells. These measurements being exclusive of the width of the outer walls.' So ends the account of the author of the Muth\u00eer.\n\nNow as to the Tradition about the Leaves (of Paradise), there are many and various accounts thereof. In the first place from Abu Bakr ibn Abi Maryam, through 'Utayyah ibn Kais, comes the tradition that the Prophet said, \"Verily a man from among my people shall enter Paradise, walking upon his two feet (and come back again), and yet shall live.\"\n\n1 The text of this passage from the Paris MSS. of the Muth\u00eer will be found on p. 305. Reynolds (p. 134), has given us a translation that reads nonsense. The identical slab, with the inscription mentioned by the author of the Muth\u00eer, was discovered by Mons. Clermont-Ganneau in 1874, in the north wall of the Haram Area. Part of the inscription, however (as noted also by our author), has become damaged. It runs as follows: \"In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful: the length of the Masjid is seven hundred and four and . . . ty ells, and its breadth four hundred and five-and-fifty ells, the ell being the ell of . . .\"\n\nAccording to Mons. Ganneau's view, the space for the word representing the tens in the enumeration of the length, will only allow of the word being either 'eighty' or 'thirty.' The Persian traveller, N\u00e2s\u00eer-i-Khusrau, who visited Jerusalem in A.H. 438 (A.D. 1047), states that he saw the inscription and read it thus, \"length 704 gez, breadth 455;\" the gez (ell = dhir\u00e2') being the royal gez.\" Ali of Her\u00e2t, who wrote about the year A.D. 1200, read the numbers of the inscription as \"700 and 455.\" The earliest notice of this measurement, however, that I have met with in Arab writers is that given in the work of the Spanish traveller, Ibn 'Abd Rabbih (who died in A.H. 328 = A.D. 940). Without any mention of the inscription on the slab, he states the length and breadth of the Haram Area to be respectively 784 and 455 ells, the ell used being the Im\u00e2m ell. Thus in his figures he agrees with the author of the Muth\u00eer; and his 'Im\u00e2m' ell which is probably that of the Im\u00e2m Ali, is possibly the same as the Malik or royal ell. Lastly, and without any reference to Mons. C. Ganneau's discovery, Mona Schefer, on the authority of M. Alric Chancelier du Consulat de France \u00e0 J\u00e9rusalem (p. 72 of his edition of N\u00e2s\u00eer-i-Khusrau's Travels), states that on the stone which may still be seen in the northern wall of the Haram Area, may be read quite clearly, \"length 750 ells, breadth 455 ells, of the royal ell.\" Mons. Ganneau, however, is of opinion, that whatever else it be, the designation of the 'ell' in the inscription cannot be read, as the word 'al Malik' or royal, on account of the space and also of the number of strokes, yet distinguishable. So much then is the diversity of opinion, ancient and modern, about this very simple matter.\nNow during the Caliphate of Omar a caravan of men arrived at the Holy City to make their prayers there. And one of them, a man of the Bani Tam\u00eem, named Shuraik ibn Hab\u00e2shah, went off to get water (from the well). And his bucket falling down into the well, he descended to get it up. In the well he found a door opening into gardens, and passing through the door into the gardens, he walked therein. Then he plucked a leaf from one of the trees, and placing it behind his ear, he returned to the well and mounted up again. And the man went to the Governor of the Holy City and related to him of what he had seen in these gardens, and how he had come to enter therein. So the Governor sent men with him to the well and they descended, many people accompanying them, but they found not the door, neither did they attain to the gardens. And the Governor wrote to the Caliph Omar concerning it all, recalling how it was reported on tradition that one of the people of Isl\u00e2m should enter the Garden of Paradise and walk therein on his two feet and yet live. Omar wrote in answer: \"Look ye to the leaf; whether it be green and do not wither. If this be so, verily it is a leaf of Paradise, for naught of Paradise can wither or change; and it is recorded in the aforesaid Tradition of the Prophet that the leaf shall not suffer change.\"\n\nAnother version of the tradition runs as follows: Shuraik ibn Hab\u00e2shah al Tam\u00eem\u00ee came into the Holy City to get water for his companions, and his bucket slipped from his hand, so he descended (into the well) to fetch it up. And a person called to him in the well saying, \"Come thou with me,\" and, taking him by the hand, he brought him into the Garden of Paradise. Shuraik plucked two leaves, and the person then brought him back to where he had first found him. Then Shuraik mounted up out of the well, and when he rejoined his companions, he told them of all that had happened. The affair reached the ears of the Caliph Omar, and it was Ka'ab who remarked how it had been said (by the Prophet) A man of this people of Isl\u00e2m shall enter the Garden of Paradise and yet live, adding, \"Look ye to the\nleaves; if they suffer change, then are they not of the leaves of Paradise, and if they change not, then must they verily be of the leaves of Paradise.\" And 'Utayyah asserts that the said leaves never after did suffer change.\n\nAccording to another tradition (coming from Al Walid), Abu-n-Najm, who was Im\u00e2m (leader of prayer) to the people of Salamiyyah (Salaminias), and their Muezzin in the year 140, and died in the year 150, related that the people of Salamiyyah, many of whom were of the desert tribes, told him how they had themselves been well acquainted with Shuraik ibn Hab\u00e2shah when he was living at Salamiyyah. And they were wont to inquire of him concerning his entrance into the Garden of Paradise, and what he saw therein, and of how he had brought leaves therefrom. And these people continued: We inquired further whether there yet remained by him any one of the leaves which he had plucked there; and when he answered us affirmatively, we asked to see the leaf, and the man called for his Kur\u00e2\u00ee, and took from between its pages a leaf that was entirely green and gave it into our hands. When we had returned it to him, after laying it over his eyes, he placed it back again between the pages of his Kur\u00e2\u00ee. And when he was at the point of death, he enjoined that we should put this leaf on his breast under the shroud, and his last words were to conjure us that this should exactly be done. Al Walid continues: I inquired of Abu-n-Najm whether he had heard a description given of the leaf; he replied 'yes, that it was like the leaf of a peach treee (Dur\u00e2kin), of the size of the palm of a hand, and pointed at the tip....'\u00b9\n\nNow the mouth of the Well of the Leaf is by the Aksa Mosque, on the left hand as you enter by the door facing the Mihr\u00e2b.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Many other similar accounts of the same tradition follow, for a mass of legendary story has gathered round all that relates to the great water tanks excavated in the rock which underlies the Haram Area.\n\n\u00b2 Plan, n. I quote the last sentence as translated by Mr. Reynolds (p. 138), as a specimen of his method: \"This well of the Leaves is situated at the entrance of the Mosque al Akse, on the left of the gate of the courtyard of the towers.\" Mr. Reynolds always translates Mihr\u00e2b by \"Tower.\"\nChapter VIII.\n\nAccount of the Spring of Silw\u00e2n (Siloam) and of the other spring that was near thereto, and the Well which is called after our lord Job, and concerning the Pools. Also an account of the wonderful events which have taken place in the Holy City, and of what happened there at the time of the murder of 'Ali ibn Abu T\u00e2lib and his son Al Husain, and of him who said that it was a place of refuge, and how he yearned for the people thereof. Also a description of the Talisman against serpents. Also the Mount of Olives, and the Plain called As Sahirah, and the Holy Mountains, with an account of Jabal K\u00e2siy\u00fbn in particular, and what is to be met with there.\u00b9\n\n...\u00b2 The author of the Kitab al Uns gives the following account of the Well (Bir) which goes by the name of the Prophet Job;\u2014'I have read a paper in the handwriting of my cousin Abu Muhammad al K\u00e2sim,\u2014who gave me permission to make use thereof\u2014which states that he read in a certain book of history how once the water ran scarce among the people of the Holy City, and in their need they went to a well in the neighbourhood, which they descended to a depth of eighty ells. At its mouth the well was ten or more ells, by four ells across, and its sides were lined with masonry of large stones, some of which might measure even five ells, but most of those in the depth of the well were one or two ells only in length. A wonder was it how these stones had been set in their places. The water of the well was cold and wholesome to drink, and the people used thereof during all that year, getting it at a depth of eighty ells. But when the winter was come, the water rose abundantly in the well, till it overflowed the brink, and ran over the ground in the bed of the W\u00e2d\u00ee, and turned mills for grinding flour. Now once (says Abu Muhammad), when there was scarcity of this water and of that in the 'Ain Silw\u00e2n, I descended with some workmen to the bottom of the\n\n\u00b9 Reynolds, p. 139. The chapter opens with an account of the various traditions connecting the Virgin Mary with the 'Ain Silw\u00e2n.\n\u00b2 Reynolds, p. 141, and see above, p. 252.\nwell to dig there, and I saw the water flowing out from under a rock the size of which was a couple of ells by the like in height, and there was a cavern the entrance of which was three ells high by an ell and a half across. From this cavern there rushed out an extremely cold wind, which made the lights nearly go out, and I perceived that the roof of the cavern was lined with masonry. On entering a short distance within it, the torches could not be kept alight by reason of the force of the wind which blew therefrom. This well is in the bed of the W\u0101di, and the cave is in its bed too, and above and all around are high steep hills, which a man cannot climb except with much fatigue. This also is the well of which He spake to His prophet Job, saying, \"Stamp,\" said we, \"with thy foot. This (fountain) is to wash with; cool and to drink.\" And so the account ends.\n\nRegarding now the pools that are in the Holy City. On the report of Damrah from Ibn Abi S\u016bdah, it is related that a certain king of the Kings of the Children of Israel named \u1e24az\u1e33\u012bl (Hezekiah) constructed six pools for the Holy City, namely, three within the city which are the Birkat Bani Isr\u0101\u02beil, the Birkat Sulaim\u0101n, and the Birkat \u2019Iy\u0101d; and three without the city which are the Birkat M\u0101mil\u0101 and the two Birkats of Al Marj\u012b\u02bf. And these he made to store the water for the people of the city.\n\n1 Kur\u0101n xxxviii. 41. The overflowing of the waters of Job\u2019s Well, down the Kidron Valley, is of yearly occurrence. Whether this Well be the Fuller\u2019s Spring, En Rogel,\u2014mentioned by Joshua (xi. 7) as on the boundary-line between the Tribes of Judah and Benjamin,\u2014is still a matter of dispute. Robinson (Biblical Researches, 2nd ed. i. 332) asserts this to be the case without doubt; while Conder (Handbook to the Bible, p. 335) advocates the identification of En Rogel with Virgin\u2019s Fountains, higher up the Valley under the walls of Jerusalem.\n\n2 Reynolds, p. 145.\n\n3 The Birkat (Pool) of the Children of Israel lies to the north of the Haram Area. Which the Birkat of Solomon may be, is matter of question, as also is the identification of the Pool of \u2019Iy\u0101d. This last takes its name from \u2019Iy\u0101d ibn Ghann\u0101m, a celebrated Companion of the Prophet (who died in A.H. 20 = A.D.641), and has nothing to do with \u201cGad,\u201d as writes Mr. Reynolds (p. 145). The Pool of Mamilla lies a short distance west of the Jaffa Gate of Jerusalem. The Pools of Al Marj\u012b\u02bf are those known as Solomon\u2019s Pools, some miles from Hebron; from these Pilate\u2019s Aqueduct brought the water to the city.\nChapter IX.\n\nAccount of the Conquest of the Holy City by the Commander of the Faithful 'Omar ibn al Khatt\u0101b, and what he did there in uncovering the Noble Rock from the dirt and dung thrown thereon. An account also of 'Abd al Malik ibn Marw\u0101n's building, and what he accomplished there. Also an account of the unique pearl that was hung over the middle of the Rock, and the two horns of Abraham's ram, and the crown of the Chosroes, all of which were transported thence to the Noble Ka'abah, at the time when the Caliphate passed to the House of 'Abbas. Also an account of the Conquest of the Holy City by the Franks, whereby it was taken from the hands of the Muslims, after 'Omar's Conquest; and how long it remained in the hands of the Christians. Further, the account of the Conquest thereof by the Sultan, the victorious king, Sal\u0101h ad D\u012bn Yusuf ibn Ayy\u016bb, whereby it was taken back out of the hands of the Franks, and how he obliterated all trace of their sojourn there, and how he restored the Masjid to what it had been before, and to the condition in which it has remained even unto this day, and please Allah will so remain to the Day of Resurrection.\u00b9\n\n...\u00b2 The following is related as coming from Shad\u0101d ibn Aus, who accompanied Omar when he entered the Noble Sanctuary of the Holy City on the day when Allah caused it to be reduced by capitulation. And Omar entered by the Gate of Muhammad,\u00b3 crawling on his hands and knees, he and all those who were with him, until he came up to the Court (of the Sanctuary). There he looked around to right\n\n\u00b9 Reynolds, p. 154.\n\u00b2 Reynolds, p. 174. Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b has copied the whole of this part verbatim out of the Muthir, the text of which, from the Paris MSS., will be found on p. 297. From what sources this very curious account of Omar's proceedings in the Holy City was taken, I am unable to state. But I must repeat that there is nothing of all this in the works of the older annalists, from Tabari to Ibn al Athir. The greater portion of this chapter has already been given in English by the late Professor Palmer in the fourth chapter of his and Mr. Besant's joint work on \"Jerusalem\u2014the City of Herod and Saladin.\" I make no apology, however, for giving it again, for I am able to supply a better text than that on which Professor Palmer worked. Extracts from Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b's text, with a Latin version, had previously appeared, edited by P. Lemming, under the title Commentatio philologicae. Specimen libri Ith\u0101f etc., auctore Kem\u0101loddino Muhammede etc. Hauni\u00e6 M.D.CCCXVII.\n\n\u00b3 Plan, K.\nand to left, and, glorifying Allah, said, \"By Allah, verily this, by Him in whose hands is my soul! must be the Mosque of David, of which the Apostle spake to us saying, 'I was conducted thither in the night journey.'\" Then Omar advanced to the fore (or southern) part of the Haram Area and to the western side thereof, and said, \"Let us make this the place for the Mosque.\"\n\nOn the authority of Al Walid ibn Muslim,\u00b9 it is reported as coming from a Shaikh of the sons of Shad\u00e2d ibn Aus, who had heard it from his father, who held it of his grandfather, that Omar, as soon as he was at leisure from the writing of the Treaty of Capitulation made between him and the people of the Holy City, said to the Patriarch of Jerusalem, \"Conduct us to the Mosque of David.\" And the Patriarch agreed thereto. Then Omar went forth girt with his sword, and with him 4000 of the Companions who had come to Jerusalem with him, all begirt likewise with their swords, and a crowd of us Arabs, who had come up to the Holy City, followed them, none of us bearing any weapons except our swords. And the Patriarch walked before Omar among the Companions, and we all behind the Khalif. Thus we entered the Holy City. And the Patriarch took us to the Church which goes by the name of the Kum\u00e2mah,\u00b2 and said he, \"This is David's Mosque.\" And Omar looked around and pondered, then he answered the Patriarch, \"Thou liest, for the Apostle described to me the Mosque of David, and by his description this is not it.\" Then the Patriarch went on with us to a Church called that of (Sihy\u00e2n) Sion, and again he said, \"This is the Mosque of David.\" But the Khalif replied to him, \"Thou liest.\" So the Patriarch went on with him till he came to the Noble Sanctuary of the Holy City, and reached the gate thereof, called the Gate of Muhammad. Now the dung which was\n\n\u00b9 Al Walid ibn Muslim, the celebrated traditionist, was a freedman of the Om\u00e2y\u00fbds, and a native of Damascus. According to Naw\u00e2wi (ed. by W\u00fcstenfeldi, text, p. 618), he died in a.h. 194 or 195, aged 73.\n\n\u00b2 Al Kum\u00e2mah, literally, 'the Dunghill.' This is a designed corruption on the part of the Muslims of 'Al Kav\u00e2mah,' 'Anastasis,' the name given to the Church of the Resurrection (the Holy Sepulchre) by the Christian Arabs.\nthen all about the Noble Sanctuary had settled on the steps of this gate, so that it even came out into the street in which the gate opened, and it had accumulated so greatly on the steps as almost to reach up to the ceiling of the gateway. The Patriarch said to Omar, \"It is impossible to proceed and enter except crawling on hands and knees.\" Said Omar, \"Even on hands and knees be it.\" So the Patriarch went down on hands and knees, preceding Omar, and we all crawled after him, until he had brought us out into the Court of the Noble Sanctuary of the Holy City. Then we arose off our knees and stood upright. And Omar looked around, pondering for a long time. Then said he, \"By Him in whose hands is my soul! this is the place described to us by the Apostle of Allah.\"\n\nAnd it is reported on other authority to the last, namely, from Hish\u00e2m ibn 'Amm\u00e2r, who had it from Al Haitham ibn Omar ibn al 'Abb\u00e2s\u00ee, who related that he had heard his grandfather, 'Abd Allah ibn Abu Abd Allah, tell how, when Omar was Khalif, he went to visit the people of Syria. Omar halted first at the village of Al J\u00e2biyah,\\(^1\\) while he despatched a man of Jad\u00eelah to the Holy City, but shortly after he became possessed thereof by capitulation. Then Omar himself went thither, and Ka'ab was with him. Said Omar to Ka'ab, \"O Abu Ishak, knowest thou the position of the Rock?\" and he answered, \"Measure from the wall which is on the W\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum so and so many ells; there dig and ye shall discover it,\" adding, \"At this present day it is a dungheap.\" So they dug there, and the Rock was laid bare. Then said Omar to Ka'ab, \"Where sayest thou we should place the Mosque, or rather the Kiblah?\" Ka'ab replied, \"Lay out a place for it behind the Rock, whereby you will make one the two Kiblahs, that, namely, of Moses, and that of Muhammad.\" But Omar answered him, \"Thou hast leanings still towards the Jews, O Abu Ishak. The Mosque shall be in front of the Rock (not behind it).\" And so the Mosque was erected in the fore part of the Haram Area.\n\n\\(^1\\) In Jaul\u00e2n.\nAnd on the like authority as the foregoing, and as an addition to what has been said above on the warranty of Ibrahim ibn Abu 'Ablah al Mukaddasi, who had it of his father, saith he: Omar then came to the Holy City, and encamped on the Mount of Olives. And afterwards he descended therefrom, and he entered the Noble Sanctuary by the Gate of the Prophet. Now, when he came to stand erect therein, he gazed to the right and to the left, and exclaimed, \"By Him than whom there is no other God! this is the Mosque of Solomon the son of David, of which the Apostle of Allah related to us that he had been brought thereto by night.\" Then he went to the western part of the Noble Sanctuary and said, \"Let us place the Mosque for the Muslims here, to be a place of prayer for them to pray in.\" And on the authority of Sa'id ibn 'Abd al 'Aziz it is related: When Omar conquered the Holy City, he found on the Rock great quantities of dung that the Greeks had thrown down here for an insult to the Children of Israel. And Omar spread his cloak, and began to sweep together all that dung, and so did also the Muslims who accompanied him.\n\nFurther, Al Walid adds, on the authority of Sa'id ibn 'Abd al Aziz, that the Letter of the Prophet had come to the Kaisar (Caesar) while he was sojourning at the Holy City.\u00b9 Now at that time there was over the Rock of the Holy City a great dungheap, which completely masked the Mihr\u00e1b of David, and which same the Christians had put here in order to offend the Jews, and further even, the Christian women were wont to throw here their cloths and clouts, so that it was all heaped up therewith.\u00b2 Now when the Caesar had perused the letter of the Prophet,\u00b3 he\n\n\u00b9 In the year of the Hijrah 7, the Prophet despatched envoys to the Chosroes of Persia, and to the Caesars of Byzantium, calling on them to acknowledge his mission as Allah's Apostle.\n\u00b2 The text here appears to me to be corrupt. The general sense, however, is plain enough.\n\u00b3 As a specimen of Mr. Reynolds' method of translation, the following may be quoted from p. 179, representing the above passages:\n\"We are also informed by Al Walid that Sa'ad Ibn-Abdul-Aziz said, A letter (an epistle) of the Prophet of God (upon whom be the mercy and peace of God!) came to Al Kais; and this it is\u2014In the Bait-ul-Mukaddas, and upon the\ncried and said, \"O ye men of Greece, verily Ye are the people who shall be slain on this dungheap, for that ye have desecrated the sanctity of this Mosque. And it shall be with you even as it was with the Children of Israel who were slain for the sake of the blood of Yahy\u00e2 ibn Zakariyy\u00e2 (John the Baptist).\" Then the C\u00e6sar commanded them to clear the place, and so they began to do, but when the Muslims invaded Syria only a third part thereof had been cleared. So when Omar had come to the Holy City and conquered it, and saw how there was a dungheap over the Rock, he regarded it as horrible, and ordered that it should be entirely cleared. And to accomplish this they forced the Nabathaean of Palestine to labour without pay. On the authority of Jab\u00eer ibn Naf\u00eer it is related that when Omar first exposed the Rock to view, by removing the dungheap, he commanded them not to pray there until three showers of heavy rain should have fallen. Al Wal\u00eed further relates, as coming from Kulth\u00fbm ibn Ziy\u00e2d, that Omar asked of Ka\u2018ab, \"Where thinkest thou that we should put the place of prayer for Muslims in this Holy Sanctuary?\" Said Ka\u2018ab, in answer, \"In the hinder (or northern) portion thereof, in the part adjoining the Gate of the Tribes,\" but Omar said, \"Not so; seeing that, on the contrary, to us belongs the fore part of the Sanctuary,\" and he then proceeded to the fore part thereof. Al Wal\u00eed again relates\u2014on the authority of Ibn Shadd\u00e2d, who had it of his father\u2014\"Omar proceeded to the fore part of the Sanctuary Area to the side adjoining the west (i.e. to the south-west part), and there began to throw the dung by handfulls into his cloak, and we all who were with him did likewise. Then he went with it\u2014and we following him to do the same\u2014and threw it into the W\u00e2di which is called Sakhr\u00e2 of the Bait-ul-Mukaddas, there shall be a great sewer, whereby the tower of David (on whom be salutation!) is spoiled by the injurious abuse of the lying Christians, in order to hurt the Jews, until those changing times shall come that the cities be stirred up to wrest the precinct from Greece. Then shall the Sakhr\u00e2h be met with. Therefore said Al Kais, when he read this epistle of the Prophet of God,\" etc., etc.\n\nThere is here a specimen of nearly every kind of blunder. A whole passage is interpolated, the very common word Kaisar, C\u00e6sar, is read twice over as an Arab proper name, Al Kais.\nW\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum. Then we returned to do the like over again, and yet again,\u2014he, Omar, and also we who were with him,\u2014until we had cleared the whole of the place where the Mosque now stands. And there we all made our prayers, Omar himself praying among us. . . .\n\nNow when Omar made the capitulation with the people of the Holy City, and entered among them, he was wearing at that time two long tunics (kam\u00ees) of the kind called Sumbul\u00e2ni. He prayed in the Church of Mary, and when he had done so he spat on to one of his tunics. And it was said to him, \u201cDost thou spit here, because that this is a place in which the sin of polytheism has been committed?\u201d and he answered, \u201cYea, verily the sin of polytheism hath been committed herein, but now in truth the name of Allah hath been pronounced here.\u201d It is further reported that Omar did carefully avoid praying near the W\u00e2d\u00ee Jahannum.\n\nThe Khalif \u2019Abd al Malik it was who built the Dome of the Rock and the (Aksa) Mosque of the Holy City, and according to report he devoted to the expenses of the same the revenues (khar\u00e2j) of Egypt for the space of seven years. The historian Sibt al Jauzi states in his work, the Mir\u00e2t az Zam\u00e2n, that \u2019Abd al Malik began the building here in the year 69 of the Hijrah, and completed the same in the year 72. (A.D. 687\u2013690). But others say that he who first built the Dome (of the Rock) of the Holy City was Sa\u2019id the son of the Khalif \u2019Abd al Malik, and that he afterwards too restored it. Now on the authority of Rij\u00e2 ibn Hay\u00e2h, and of Yaz\u00eed ibn Sall\u00e2m, \u2019Abd al Malik\u2019s freedman, it is reported\n\n---\n\n1 Reynolds, p. 182. The text of this passage is not from the Muth\u00eer, and where Suy\u00fbti obtained it I do not know.\n2 Lane, in his great Dictionary (v. sub voce) says that the Kam\u00ees Sumbul\u00e2ni is a shirt ample in length, so as to hang down to the ground, and adds that it is so called in relation to a town or district in the Greek Empire. The Church of Mary (Kan\u00eesah Maryam), here mentioned, may be the Church of the Virgin described by Procopius.\n3 This is the beginning of the sixth chapter of the Muth\u00eer (see p. 300 for the text). Reynolds, p. 184.\n4 Abu\u2019l Mikd\u00e2m Rij\u00e2 ibn Hay\u00e2h ibn Jar\u00fbl, of the Kendah tribe, was a man celebrated for his learning, and a great friend of the Khalif Omar (II.) ibn \u2019Abd al Az\u00eez. Yaz\u00eed ibn Sall\u00e2m, his colleague, was a native of Jerusalem.\nthat on the occasion of the building the Dome of the Rock of the Holy City and the Aksa Mosque, the Khalif came himself from Damascus to Jerusalem, and thence despatched letters into all the Provinces, and to all the Governors of cities, as follows: \"'Abd al M\u0101lik doth wish to build a Dome over the Rock in the Holy City, whereby to shelter the Muslims from heat and cold; as also a Mosque. But he wisheth not to do this thing without knowing the will of his subjects. Therefore let his subjects write to him their desires and whatever may be their will.\"\u00b9 And letters came back to him from the governors of the Provinces which assured the Commander of the Faithful of the full approval of all men, and that they deemed his intention a fitting and pious one. And said they: \"We ask of Allah to give completion to what the Khalif doth undertake in the matter of building in the Noble Sanctuary, and the Dome therein and the Mosque; and may it succeed under his hand, for it is a noble deed both for him and for those who follow after him.\" Then the Khalif brought together craftsmen from all parts of his empire, and commanded that they should set forth the proportions and elevation of the building before they began to build the Dome itself. So they laid out the plan thereof in the Court of the Haram Area.\u00b2 And he commanded them to build a Treasure House on the east side of the Rock, and the same is the building which stands close beside the Rock.\u00b3 So they began to build: And the Khalif set apart great sums of money, and instituted to be overseers thereof Rij\u00e2 ibn Hay\u00e2h, and Yaz\u00eed ibn Sall\u00e2m, commanding them to spend the same, and giving\n\n\u00b9 The text as given in the Muth\u00eer (p. 300) is, I think, corrupt; but there can be no doubt of the general import.\n\n\u00b2 I am by no means sure of my translation of this passage. If we read Suffat-al-Kubbat, it would mean \"the porch of the Dome,\" i.e. one of the porches at the four gates. I prefer, however, to read S\u00eefat, and to translate as I have done. Muj\u00eer ad din in the corresponding passage (p. 241 of the Bul\u00e2k text, printed in A.H. 1283) gives quite a different reading. What he says is: \"And 'Abd al M\u00e2lik carefully described to the artificers what he wished to be built, and how it should stand. And while he remained in the Holy City, the architects built for him the small Dome which stands to the east of the Dome of the Rock, and is now called the Dome of the Chain. And this he so much admired that he ordered the Kubbat as Sakhrah (the Dome of the Rock) to be built like it.\"\n\n\u00b3 Now called the Dome of the Chain, Plan, c.\nthem authority therein. So they made expenditure for digging the foundations, and building up the structure, until the moneys were near to be all expended. Now when the edifice was complete and solidly constructed, so that not a word could be said for improvement thereto, they wrote to the Khalif at Damascus: \"Allah hath given completion to what the Commander of the Faithful commanded concerning the building the Dome over the Rock of the Holy City, and the Aksa Mosque also. And no word can be said to suggest improvement thereto. And verily there remaineth over and above of what the Commander of the Faithful did set apart for the expense of the same,\u2014the building being now complete and solidly built,\u2014a sum of 100,000 (gold) din\u00e2rs. Let the Commander of the Faithful expend the same in whatever matter seemeth good to him.\" And the Khalif wrote to them in reply: \"Let this then be a gift unto you two for what ye have accomplished in the building of this noble and blessed house.\" But to this they sent in answer:\u2014\"Nay rather, first let us add to this the ornaments of our women and the superfluity of our wealth, and then do thou expend the whole in what seemeth best to thee.\" So the Khalif wrote to command them to melt down the sum and apply it to the adornment of the Dome. And all this sum was melted down and laid out to adorn the Dome of the Rock, to such an extent that it was impossible by reason of the gold thereon for any one to keep the eye fixed and look at it.\n\nThey prepared also two coverings to go over the Dome, of felts and of skins of animals, and the same was put over it in the winter to preserve it from the rains and the winds and the snows. Rij\u00e2 ibn Hay\u00e2h and Yazid ibn Sall\u00e2m also surrounded the Rock with a lattice-screen of S\u00e2sim (or ebony wood), and outside the screen they hung between the columns curtains of brocade.\u00b9 Each day fifty-and-two\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Reynolds' translation (p. 187) of the foregoing passages is so remarkable that I quote it, in further proof of my assertion that his work needs emendation. 'Then he [the Caliph] wrote to them, \"A great sum hath been expended and paid by the public for the chapel; therefore I will spend and lay out upon it (money for the purchase of) that which every one may look at\u2014gold work, and ornament\npersons were employed to pound and grind down saffron, working by night also, and leavening it with musk and ambergris, and rose-water of the J\u00fbri rose. At early dawn the servants appointed entered the Bath of Sulaim\u00e2n\u00b9 ibn \u2019Abd al Malik, where they washed and purified themselves before proceeding to the Treasure Chamber (al Khaz\u00e2nah), in which was kept the (yellow perfume of saffron called) Khul\u00fbk. And, before leaving the Treasure Chamber, they changed all their clothes, putting on new garments made of the stuffs of Marv and Her\u00e2t, also shawls (of the striped cloths of Yaman) called \u2019A\u1e63b, and taking jewelled girdles they girt them about their waists. Then bearing the jars of Khul\u00fbk in their hands, they went forth and anointed there-with the stone of the Rock, even as far as they could reach up to with their hands, spreading it all over the same. And for the part beyond that which they could reach, having first washed their feet, they attained thereto by mounting on the Rock itself, anointing all that remained thereof, and by this the jars of Khul\u00fbk were completely emptied. Then they brought censers of gold and of silver filled with aloes wood of Kim\u00e2r (in Java), and the incense called Nadd, compounded with musk and ambergris, and letting down the curtains between the columns, they swung to and fro the censers, and the incense would rise into all the space between the columns and the Dome above by reason of the quantity thereof. Which done and the curtains again drawn up, the censers were carried outside the building, whereby the sweet smell went abroad, even to the entrance of the market beyond, so that all who passed therein could scent the perfume. After this the censers were extinguished. Proclamation then was made by criers from before the screen,\u2014\u201cThe Sakhrah, verily, is\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. of Suy\u00fbt\u00ee give \u201cHamm\u00e2m Sulaim\u00e2n\u201d only, as though it were King Solomon. I have found no notice of this bath elsewhere. The J\u00fbri rose is named from the town of J\u00fbr or G\u00fbr, in Persia, afterwards called Fair\u00fbz\u00e2b\u00e2d, which was so celebrated for its roses as to be surnamed Balad al Ward, the City of Roses (see Yak\u00fbt, ii. 147).\nopen for the people, and he who would pray therein, let him come.\u201d The people hastened to come and make their prayer in the Sakhrah, the most of them performing two Rika\u2018ahs, while some few acquitted themselves of four. And after, he who had thus said his prayers had gone forth again, they would perceive on him the perfume of the incense, and say, \u201cSuch a one has been in the Sakhrah.\u201d (After the prayer-time is over, the servants) wash off with water the marks left by the people\u2019s feet, cleaning everywhere with green myrtle (brooms), and drying with cloths. Then the gates are closed, and for guarding each were appointed ten chamberlains, since none might enter the Sakhrah, except the servants thereof, on other days than the Monday and the Friday.\n\nOn the authority of Abu Bakr ibn al H\u00e2rith, it is reported that during the Caliphate of \u2019Abd al Malik the Sakhrah was entirely lighted with (oil of) the Midian B\u00e2n (the Tamarisk or Myrobalan) tree, and oil of Jasmin, of a lead colour. And the chamberlains had said to the Khalif, \u201cO Abu Bakr, command for us candelabra with lamps (kandil) in which we may put oil, for the same would be more agreeable unto us.\u201d And the Khalif granted them their request. Such are the matters which pertain to the days of the Caliphate of \u2019Abd al Malik.\n\nSaith Al Wal\u00eed, it hath been related to me by \u2019Abd ar Rahman ibn Mansur ibn Th\u00e2bit, who said, I have it of my father, who had it of his father, and he from his grandfather,\n\n1 Prayer prostrations.\n2 What Mash\u00e2ni or Mas\u00e2ni mean I do not know; the word is omitted in the MSS. of Suy\u00fbfi. Mr. Reynolds has completely misunderstood these paragraphs. I quote a single passage (p. 189), that, namely, which is supposed to give the translation of the above sentence, \u201cThen the men went out; and whosoever smelt the smell of their incense said, This is from some one who has entered the Sakhrah; and they washed the soles of their feet, and slightly passed a moistened hand over their face, at the threshold of St. George, and napkins were wetted, and gates were split open (i.e. although they only slightly wetted their faces, and then wiped them with a napkin, yet, from the number who did this, the napkins were entirely wet, and from the rush of their entrance the gates were split open). Also at every gate were ten beadle,\u201d etc. I need hardly point out that the commentary introduced with \u201ci.e.\u201d is as much beside the mark as the remainder of the translation. The text of all this may be seen on p. 302.\n3 The MSS. read, somo Zumbal, which is \u2018Oil of Jasmin,\u2019 and somo Z\u00eeb\u00e2h, which is \u2018Quicksilver.\u2019 If the latter be right, and it concords better with ar-ras\u00eed \u2018of lead,\u2019 I fail to comprehend how the Mosque was lighted with \u2018Quicksilver of lead.\u2019 Mr. Reynolds offers no solution, for he leaves these words out.\nthat in the days of 'Abd al Malik there was suspended from the chain hanging down in the middle of the Dome of the Rock a single unique pearl, also the two horns of the Ram of Abraham, and the Crown of the Cosroes. But when the Caliphate passed to the Abbasides, they had all these transported to the Ka'abah, which may Allah preserve.\n\nOn the authority of the H\u00e1fidh ibn 'As\u00e1kir, the testimony going back to Abul Ma'\u00e1li Al Mukaddas\u00ee, it is related how 'Abd al Malik built the Dome of the Rock and the Aksa Mosque; which, further, is inserted by the author of the Muthir al Ghar\u00e1m in his seventh chapter, citing 'Ukbah as his authority, and continuing to the following effect: Now in those days there were in use in the Mosque 6000 beams of wood for the ceilings, besides the beams for the wooden pillars. And the doors were 50 in number. There were 600 pillars of marble, and seven Mihr\u00e1bs, and of chains for suspending the candelabra 400 minus 15 (i.e. 385), of which 230 were in the Aksa Mosque, and the remainder (i.e. 155) in the Dome of the Rock. The length of all these chains put together was 4000 ells, and their weight 43,000 Syrian (pounds or) ratls. There were 5000 lamps, and in addition to these they were wont to light 2000 wax candles on Friday nights, and on the middle nights of the months of Raj\u00e1b, Sha'\u00e1b\u00e1n, and Ramadh\u00e1n, as also on the nights of the Two (Great) Festivals. (In the various parts of the Haram Area) are 15 (small) Domes, besides the (Great) Dome of the Rock, and on the Mosque roof there were 7700 sheets of lead, each sheet weighing 70 ratls, Syrian measure, and this did not include what was on the roof which covered the Dome of the Rock. All this was of that which was done in the days of 'Abd al Malik. And this Khalif appointed for the perpetual service of the Noble Sanctuary 300 servants, who were (slaves) purchased with moneys of the Royal Fifth from the Treasury; and as these servants in time died off, each man's\n\n---\n\n1 See above, p. 253.\n2 See p. 303.\n3 The ratl (from the Greek \u03bb\u03af\u03c1\u03b1) is of about 6 lbs. English.\nson, or his son's son, or some member of his family, was appointed in his place. And so the service has continued on for all time, generation after generation; and they receive their rations from the public treasury. In the Haram Area there are 24 great water cisterns, and of minarets 4, to wit, three in a line on the west side of the Noble Sanctuary, and one that rises above the B\u0101b al Asb\u0101t (Gate of the Tribes). And among the servants of the Haram there were Jews, from whom was exacted no poll-tax; originally there were ten men, but their families increasing the number rose to twenty, and it was their business to sweep up the dust left by the people at the times of visitation both in summer and in winter, and also to clean the places of ablution that lay round the Aksa Mosque. There were also ten Christian servants of the Noble Sanctuary, whose office went by inheritance likewise. These made and likewise swept the mats of the Mosque. They also swept out the conduits which carried the water into the cisterns, and as well attended to the keeping clean of the cisterns themselves, and other such service. And among the servants of the Sanctuary, too, were another company of Jews who made the glass plates for the lamps, and the glass lantern bowls, and glass vessels and rods. And it was appointed that from these men also no poll-tax was to be taken, nor from those who made the wicks for the lamps, and this exemption continued in force for all time, both to them and their children who inherited the office after them, even from the days of 'Abd al Malik, and so for ever.\n\nOn the authority of 'Abd ar Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Mansur ibn Th\u00e2bit from his father, who had it from his grandfather, it is reported that in the days of 'Abd al Malik all the gates of the Mosque were covered with plates of gold and of silver. But during the reign of Abu Ja\u2018afar al Mans\u00fbr, in the year 130 (A.D. 746), both the eastern and the western portions of the Mosque fell down, and it was reported to the Khalif, saying, \"O Commander of the Faithful, the earthquake hath thrown down the eastern part of the Mosque and the western part thereof also, now therefore give orders\nto rebuild the same and raise it again.\u201d And the Khalif replied that as there were no moneys in his treasury, (to supply the lack of coin) they should strip off the plates of gold and of silver that overlaid the gates. So they stripped these off and coined therefrom din\u00e2rs and dirhems, which were expended on the rebuilding of the Mosque, even till it was completed. Then occurred the second earthquake, and the building that Al Mans\u00fbr had commanded to be built fell to the ground. In the days of Al Mahdi, who succeeded him, the Mosque was still lying in ruins, which, being reported to him, he commanded them to rebuild the same, adding that the Mosque had been (of old) too narrow, and of too great a length,\u2014and for this reason it had not been used by the people,\u2014so now in rebuilding it they were to curtail its length and increase its breadth. The restoration of the Mosque was completed on this plan during his reign.\n\nIn the year 452 (A.D. 1060) the Great Lantern (Tann\u00fbr) that hung in the Dome of the Rock fell down, and there were in it 500 lamps. Those of the Muslims who were there augured evil therefrom, saying, \u201cOf a surety there will happen some portentous event in Isl\u00e2m.\u201d\n\nAl Wal\u00eed further writes, on the warranty of Abu \u2019Amir ibn Damrah, who said it on the authority of \u2019At\u00e2, who had it of his father, that in early days it was the Jews who were appointed to light the lamps in the Noble Sanctuary, but that when Omar ibn \u2019Abd al Az\u00eez came to reign, he deprived them of this office, and set in their place servants who had been purchased with moneys of the Royal Fifth. And a certain man of these servants, a slave bought of the Royal Fifth, came once to him and said, \u201cGive me manumission, O Khalif!\u201d but Omar answered, \u201cHow then! for verily I cannot emancipate thee! but shouldst thou depart (of thine own accord), behold I have no power over a hair even of the hairs of thy dog!\u201d\n\n1 The Omeyyad Khalif, who reigned at Damascus A.H. 99-101 (A.D. 717-720).\n2 The remainder of this chapter is devoted to an account of the taking of Jerusalem by the Crusaders, and its re-conquest by Saladin; the details of which being matters of history, and fully treated of in other works, need not detain us here.\nChapter X.\n\nAn account of those who have entered the Holy City, of the various Prophets, and also of the Companions of the Prophet and of their Followers, and others besides.

How Solomon built the Sepulchre that is there, and of the advantages to be derived from visiting the above-mentioned tombs.

Then Abraham himself died and was buried at her side. Then Isaac's wife Rebecca died and was buried there, and Isaac himself later was buried beside his wife. When Jacob died, he was buried at the mouth of the cave, and when his wife Lik\u00e2 (Leah) came also to die, she was buried beside him. Then the sons of Jacob met together, and also Esau and his brethren, and they said, \"Let us leave the entrance of the cavern open, so that when any die he may be buried therein.\" But afterwards a dispute arose among them, and one of the brothers of Esau, or, as some say, one of the sons of Jacob, raised his hand and struck Esau a blow that caused his head to fall off and roll into the cave. And they carried forth his body and buried it without the head, for the head remained within the cave. And the cave they closed by a wall. Then over each grave they erected a monument, inscribing on each severally \"This is the tomb of Abraham,\" \"This is the tomb of Sarah,\" and so forth, after which they all departed, closing the gates. ...2\n\n1 Reynolds, p. 359.\n2 The following curious account of a visit to the Cave of Machpelah has been copied by Suy\u00fbt\u00ee verbatim from Chapter XV. of Ishak al Khal\u00eel\u00ee's \"History of Hebron,\" mentioned above, p. 252.\nMuhammad ibn Bakr\u00e2n ibn Muhammad al Khat\u00eeb, who was Khat\u00eeb (Preacher) of Abraham\u2019s station, has reported as having heard Muhammad ibn Ahmad the grammarian relate the following: and it is given in his own words: Once I went with the K\u00e2d\u00ee Abu \u2019Amr \u2019Othm\u00e2n ibn Ja\u2019far ibn Sh\u00e2dh\u00e2n to visit the tomb of Abraham\u2014upon him peace. We had sojourned there for the space of three days, when, on the fourth, the K\u00e2d\u00ee approached the inscription which is facing the tomb of Rebecca, Isaac\u2019s wife, and ordered it to be washed, that the writing thereon might be made clear; and he set me to copy all that was on the stone, in exact facsimile, on a roll of paper that we had brought. And after this he returned to Ar Ramlah;\u00b9 where he brought together men of all tongues to read what was thereon, but no one among them was able to interpret it; but they agreed that the same was in the language of the ancient Greeks, and that if any one there were who knew how to read it, it would be a certain Shaikh of Aleppo. So the K\u00e2d\u00ee Abu \u2019Amr sent expressly to this Shaikh requesting his presence at Ar Ramlah, and when he had arrived he caused me also to be present. And behold he that was come was a very ancient man; and this Shaikh from Aleppo dictated to me as follows, being the translation of what I had copied: \u201cIn the divine and adored Name, the sublime, the mighty, the well-directing, the strong, the powerful! Verily the mound which is facing this is the Tomb of Rebecca, the wife of Isaac, and that which lies near thereto is the Tomb of Isaac. The great mound over against this is the Tomb of Abraham the Friend, and the mound which faces it on the eastern side is the Tomb of Sarah his wife. The further mound, which lies beyond that of the Tomb of Abraham the Friend, is the Tomb of Jacob, and the mound adjoining it is the Tomb of \u0130liy\u00e2 (Leah), Jacob\u2019s wife. And Esau wrote this with his own handwriting.\u201d\n\n\u00b2 Further, Muhammad ibn Bakr\u00e2n speaks of another\n\n\u00b9 At that time the capital of Filast\u00een.\n\u00b2 This second account is omitted by Suy\u00fbt\u00ee.\naccount, and that the copy of the inscription cut on the above-mentioned stone, lying to the east, stated that the head of Adam\u2014peace be on him\u2014was therein, the interpretation thereof being as follows:\u2014\"In the divine and adored Name, the high, the mighty, the victorious, the strong, the puissant\u2014this mound which lies near this inscription is the Tomb of Rebecca, the wife of Isaac, and the mound thereto adjacent westwards is the Tomb of Isaac. The great mound which lies on the opposite side, and corresponding thereto, is the Tomb of Abraham, and the mound which is facing this to the east thereof is the Tomb of his wife Sarah. The mound that lies farthest off, but in a line with the Tomb of Abraham the Friend, is the Tomb of Jacob, and the mound adjacent thereunto and to the east thereof, is the Tomb of his wife Iliy\u00e2\u2014the benediction of Allah and His mercy and His blessing be upon them all, for purity lieth in His grace.\"\n\nThese then are the two accounts.] Muhammad ibn Bakr\u00e2n Al Khat\u00eeb notes that the name of (Leah) Jacob's wife is Iliy\u00e2, but that in some books her name is written Lay\u00e2 (or Liy\u00e2), and she is known also as L\u00eeka, but Allah knows alone the truth thereof. The K\u00e2d\u00ee mentioned in the first account\u2014Abu Amr 'Othman ibn Ja'afar ibn Sh\u00e2dh\u00e2n\u2014was a judge of high renown and well known; the narrator of the account, however, was not certain as to the exact name of his father; I have reason to believe that he was 'Othman son of Muhammad ibn Sh\u00e2dh\u00e2n. He was K\u00e2d\u00ee (Judge) of Ar Ramlah during the Khalifate of Ar R\u00e2d\u00ee billah, in the year 320 and odd (A.D. 932), and the years following. He is an authority for Traditions, which he held at many hands, and a great number of very learned Traditionists also cite him as their authority.\n\nThe H\u00e2fiz Ibn 'As\u00e2kir writes: In a certain book of Traditions I read and copied the following: 'Muhammad ibn Bakr\u00e2n ibn Muhammad al Khat\u00eeb\u2014who was Khat\u00eeb of the Masjid of Abraham the Friend\u2014states (having heard it from Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn 'Ali ibn Ja'afar al Anbari, who himself had heard Abu Bakr al Ask\u00e2fi give the\naccount), as follows: \"With me it is of a surety that the Tomb of Abraham is at the spot now shown as the same, for I have looked on it and seen it with my own eyes. And it was after this manner:\u2014I had expended great sums, amounting to nearly 4000 dinars, on the Holy Place and its Guardians, hoping thereby to obtain favour of Allah\u2014may He be exalted\u2014and I wished also to convince myself of the exactitude of what was reported concerning (Abraham's tomb). So when the hearts (of the Guardians of the Holy Place) were won by all that I had done there in the way of pious deeds and generous giving, and in the making of presents, and honourably entreating of them, and other such bounties, I proposed to get at the root of the truth which my heart desired to know. So, on a certain day, I said to the Guardians, when we were all assembled together, 'I would fain ask of you to conduct me to the door of the Cave, that I may descend therein and be a witness for myself (of the tombs) of the Prophets. The Benediction of Allah and His mercy be upon them.' The Guardians answered me, 'We would certainly agree to do this for thee, for thou hast put us greatly in thy debt, but at this present time the matter is impossible, for travellers are constant in arriving,\u2014but do thou have patience till the winter shall have come.' And when the month of the II. Kan\u00fbn (January) was entered, I went to them again, but they said to me, 'Remain with us yet awhile until the snow falls.' So I remained with them till the snow fell. Now when the travellers had ceased coming, the Guardians brought me to where was the stone which lies between the Tomb of Abraham the Friend and that of Isaac,\u2014Peace be on them both,\u2014and they raised this slab, and one of them, a man of the name of Sa'l\u00fbk, a just man, who did many pious works, prepared to descend to guide me. And he descended, and I with him and following him. We went down seventy-two steps, until we came to a place on the right as it were a great bier built of black stones\u2014even like a merchant's stall in the bazaar\u2014whereon lay the body of an aged man, on his back, long-bearded and hairy of cheek, with clothes of a green colour upon him. Said\nSa'l\u00fbk to me, 'This is Isaac\u2014peace be on him!' Then we went a little further, and came to a yet larger bier than the first, and upon it extended on his back lay an aged man, the hair on his breast already whitened with age, and his head and beard and eyebrows and eyelashes white also. Under his white hair there appeared green garments, which covered his body and also the greater part of the bier, and the wind blew about his white locks to right and to left. Said Sa'l\u00fbk to me, 'This is Abraham the Friend,' and I threw myself upon my face glorifying Allah\u2014may He be praised and magnified\u2014for what He had vouchsafed to me. Then we continued on yet again and came to a smaller bier, on which lay an old man, with a face much browned by the sun, and a thick beard. On his body there were green clothes, which covered him over. Said Sa'l\u00fbk to me, 'This is Jacob, the Prophet\u2014on him be Peace!' Then we turned to go to the right, as though to go to the Harem.\" \"At this point (says Muhammad al Anbari) Abu Bakr al Ask\u00e2f\u00ee swore to me that his story must end. So I arose from beside him, the time of the visit and his telling me of all this having drawn to a close. But at my convenience I went later to the Masjid Ibrah\u00eem (Hebron), and, coming to the Mosque, inquired for Sa'l\u00fbk. Said they to me, 'In an hour he will be here.' And when he came, I went to him, and sitting down beside him, began to tell him part of the story. But he looked on me with an eye that would have denied all knowledge of the circumstances related by me. Then I turned towards him to gain his favour, and showed him that I was free of evil intent, for that Abu Bakr al Ask\u00e2f\u00ee was as my paternal uncle, whereby he began to incline to me. And I said to him, 'O Sa'l\u00fbk, by Allah! when ye did turn as though to go towards the Harem, what happened, and what was it that ye saw?' And he said to me, 'But did not Abu Bakr tell thee thereof?' I answered, 'I desire to hear of it from thee.' Then said he, 'We heard, as coming from out near the Harem, a voice of one crying\u2014Depart ye from the Harem! and Allah have mercy on you\u2014and we fell down and lost all sense. After a time we came to ourselves again\nand arose, but we despaired of life, and our companions (above) had despaired of us also.'\n\nThe Shaikh further told me that Abu Bakr al Askafi lived on but a few days after he had related to him this account, and Sa'lik also died shortly after\u2014Allah have mercy on them both.\" 1\n\n1 I have given this curious account in extenso, for it has been copied by many later Arab historians and abridged. The following version of this and also a notice of another visit to the Cave has appeared to me worth translating from the pages of Yakut's great Geographical Dictionary (ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, vol. ii. p. 469, s.v. Al Khalil).\n\nThe place is called Al Khalil; originally, however, it was named Habris, and also Habra; and in the Books of Moses it is written how Al Khalil (the Friend of God, Abraham) bought a piece of ground from Afrun ibn Suhir al Haithi (Ephron the son of Zochar the Hittite) for four hundred dirhems of silver, and buried therein Sarah. Many of the Traditionists are of this town; and it is a pleasant, wholesome, and agreeable place, wherein many blessed sights are to be seen. It is said that its fortress was built by Solomon the son of David. Al Harawi relates as follows: \"I went to Jerusalem in the year 567 (A.D. 1172), and both there and at Hebron I made the acquaintance of certain Shaikhs, who informed me that in the year 513 (A.D. 1119), during the reign of King Bardawil (Baldwin II.) a certain part over the Cave of Abraham had given way, and that a number of the Franks had, by the King's permission, made their entrance therein. And they found (the bodies of) Abraham and Isaac and Jacob\u2014peace be upon them\u2014their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall. Over each of their heads were lamps, and their heads were uncovered. Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more.\" Al Harawi continues: \"I once read, when attending the lectures of As Suffi, that a certain man, who is called the Armenian, being of a mind to make his visitation at Hebron, gave large sums in presents to the Guardians (of the shrine), and had asked one of them whether it were not possible for him to take him down to see the (body of the) Patriarch\u2014on whom be peace. The man replied that at that time it was not possible, but that if he would wait till the press of pilgrims was over, that he could do it. And so (when the time of the pilgrimage was passed, he raised up a stone flag (in the floor of the Mosque), and taking a lamp with him, he and the other descended some seventy steps to a spacious cavern. The air here was blowing freely, and there was a platform on which lay extended (the body of) Abraham, peace be on him, clothed in green garments, and the wind as it blew tossed about his white locks. At his side lay Isaac and Jacob. And the guide went on with him to the walls of the cavern, telling him that behind the wall lay Sarah, and he had in intention to show him what was beyond the wall, but lo! a voice cried out, saying, 'Beware, for it is the Haram!' The narrator adds that he returned and came up by the way he had gone down.\"\n\nThe person quoted by Yakut is Abu'l Hasan Ali al Harawi (of Herat), who died in A.H. 611 (A.D. 1215) at Aleppo, and wrote a book describing the Holy Places of Palestine, of which work a MS. exists in the Bodleian Library. In Ibn al Athir's Chronicle, under the events of the year 513 (A.D. 1119), that is in the very year mentioned by Al Harawi, there is the notice \"That in this year was opened the Tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob, at a place near the Holy City. Many people saw them. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\"\n\nAll the extant notices of visits to the sepulchres of the Patriarchs at Hebron are ably brought together and discussed by Comte Riant, in a paper inserted at p. 411 of the Archives de l'Orient Latin, vol. ii. 1884. On Hebron in general, the note given by M. Quatrem\u00e8re in the Appendix (p. 239) to vol. i. part ii. of his Histoire des Sultans Mamlouks (one of the most useful of the Oriental Translation Fund Publications), may with advantage be consulted.\nChapter XIV.\n\nConcerning the birth of Ishmael and how he went to Mekkah, also how our lord Abraham rode thither on the steed Al Burdak to visit him and his mother Hagar. Also of Hagar's death and burial, and Ishmael's age and his burial, and how many were the years that elapsed between his death and the birth of the Prophet Muhammad.\u00b9\n\nChapter XV.\n\nThe story of Lot, and the place of his sepulture. Also description of the Cave which is below the Old Mosque, and facing it on the west. And of the Mosque al Yakin, and the Cave which lies to the west thereof.\u00b2\n\nThe Shaikh Abu 'Ukbah 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, the Hanifite, of Marv, says, I have read in certain of the Lives of the Prophets that Lot lies buried in a village called Kafar Barik, lying about a farsakh from Masjid al Khalil (Hebron); and that in the cave to the west, beneath the Old Mosque, lie 60 Prophets, of whom 20 were also Apostles. And Lot's tomb has been a place of visitation and veneration from ancient times, the men of the age succeeding those who have gone before.\n\nThe author\u00b3 of the Kit\u00e2b al Badi' fi Tafs\u00eel al Mamlakat al Isl\u00e2m, says that at a distance of a farsakh from Hebron is a small mountain which overhangs the Lake of Zughar. This is the site of Lot's Villages, and a Mosque has been built here by Abu Bakr as Sab\u00e2h\u00ee, in which is preserved Abraham's bedstead; it is sunk in the earth to the depth of an ell. It is related that when Abraham perceived the Villages of Lot before him in the air, he stood still there (or lay down), and cried out, \"I testify that He is the Truth, the Certain (Al Yak\u00een).\" Hence this Mosque was named Masjid al Yak\u00een.\n\nAt Tadm\u00fbri,\u2074 however, states that he never found any one whose works he had read, among the writers of history, who\n\n\u00b9 Reynolds, p. 370.\n\u00b2 Reynolds, p. 377.\n\u00b3 That is, the well-known geographer Al Mukaddasi.\n\u2074 At Tadm\u00fbri, the Palmyrene, is Abu'l Fid\u00e2 Ish\u00e2k al Khal\u00eel\u00ee, mentioned above, p. 252.\nmentioned aught of Lot's death, or of his life, or of his tomb. Here ends the account. . . .\n\nChapter XVI.\n\nAs to what is related concerning the burial-place of our lord Moses, and concerning his life, and his prayer at his place of sepulture. Also his benevolence to the people and his compassion for them. And mention of certain of his miracles and why he was called Moses, besides other matters.\u00b9\n\nChapter XVII.\n\nConcerning the excellence of Syria, and what has been said thereon of old and in the chronicles. Also the reason of its being called Ash Sh\u0101m (Syria), and the delineation of its frontiers. Also the Traditions of the Prophet relating to this land and its inhabitants, and its being the home of true believers and the centre pillar of Isl\u0101m. Also the prayer of the Prophet in favour of this land, and an account of all the places therein that are desirable places for visitation and holy places where prayers are granted. Also a general and particular advertisement of all that concerns the same.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Reynolds, p. 378.\n\u00b2 Reynolds, p. 391. Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b's description of Damascus, and his account of the building of the Mosque by the Khalif al Wal\u012bd is too lengthy to insert here. Besides, Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b is not an original authority on these points, and nearly all the information he gives may be found, in a slightly different form, translated into French, and inserted by Quatrem\u00e8re in a long note (vol. ii. pt. iii. p. 262) to his Histoire des Sultans Mamlouks. It may, however, be worth while to give what Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b writes of the political divisions of Syria, noting that on this subject he merely copies word for word what the author of the Muthir had written in A.D. 1361. Mr. Reynolds has given not a few misreadings (p. 394, et seq.). The first town of Syria, says the Muthir, is B\u0101lis (not Bay\u0101s, as in R.), and the last Al 'Ar\u012bsh of Egypt. Syria is divided into five districts, namely\u20141. Filast\u012bn, whose capital is Iliya (\u00c6lia), eighteen miles from Ar Ramlah, which is the Holy City, the metropolis of David and Solomon. Of its towns are Ascalon, Hebron, Sibastiah, and N\u0101bulus. 2. Haur\u0101n, whose capital is Tiberias, with its lake, whereof mention occurs in the Traditions anent Gog and Magog; and 'tis said that at the time of the birth of him (i.e. the Prophet), whom Allah bless and keep in peace (Ji wak\u012bti wil\u0101datih\u012b sal\u0101l All\u0101hu 'alaihi wa sal\u0101ma, which Mr. Reynolds renders, \"in the time of Wal\u0101dat\"), the Lake overflowed. Of its territories are those of the Gh\u014dr, the Yarm\u016bk (Hieromax), and of Beis\u0101n (Bethshean, Scythopolis), which is the town of whose palm trees the Antichrist (ad Dajjal) will enquire (Reynolds has, \"from whose palm trees pitch is sought, whence its name Al Dijjalat, the Tigris\"). Also the Jordan, more often called Ash Shar\u012b'ah. 3. The Gh\u016btah. Its capital is Damascus; Tripoli is on its coast. 4. Hims (Emessa; the name of the province, and of its chief town). (Of its dependencies is the city of Salamaniah (Salaminias. Reynolds writes 'Salam\u012bt'). 5. Kinnasrin (not 'Kinnarin' as in Reynolds). Its chief town is Aleppo, and of its dependencies are Sarmin (not 'Samwil,' as in Reynolds) and Antioch.\nExtracts from the Muth\u00eer al Ghar\u00e2m.\n\nFrom the Fifth Chapter of the Muth\u00eer al

QUARTER\n\n(December, January, February).\n\nI. REPORTS OF MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY, SESSION 1886\u201387.\n\nSecond Meeting, 20th December, 1886.\u2014Col. H. Yule, R.E., C.B., President, in the Chair.\n\nElections: Lieut. Walter Henry Simpson, Bengal Staff Corps, and Mr. W. McDouall, of the Persian Gulf Telegraph Department, were elected Non-Resident Members.\n\nThe President, on taking the chair, expressed his deep regret at another loss the Society had experienced in the death of their Member of Council (formerly one of the Vice-Presidents), Mr. Arthur Grote.\n\nProfessor R. K. Douglas, in the absence of the author, read Mr. Beal\u2019s paper, the subject of which was mainly an endeavour to reconcile certain doubtful passages in the travels of Fa-Hien the Chinese pilgrim, as recorded in available texts, whether in respect of verbal interpretations or the identity of places. The President and Professor Douglas adverted to one or two points which suggested discussion; while the paper itself appears in extenso in the present Number of the Journal (pp. 191\u2013206).\n\nAmong the presents notified, twenty-six brightly bound volumes in Arabic and Turkish, for the greater part of an educational character, presented by the Turkish Ambassador, under instructions of H.I.M. the Sultan; and two valuable French translations from the Arabic\u2014the \u201cVoyages d\u2019Ibn Batoutah\u201d and \u201cPrairies d\u2019Or de Ma\u00e7oudi\u201d\u2014presented by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique through M. Ernest Leroux, called for special notice and acknowledgment.\n\nThird Meeting, 24th January, 1887.\u2014Col. H. Yule, R.E., C.B., President, in the Chair.\n\nElections: Mrs. Finn, and Pandits Sh\u00e1m L\u00e1l and Lakhs\u00ed Nar\u00e1yn\nwere elected Resident, and Messrs. A. Rae, C. De Morgan, C. Mullaly, and A. Baumgartner, Non-Resident Members.\n\nDr. R. N. Cust, Hon. Secretary, gave a viv\u00e2 voce address on the subject of the Languages of Oceania. He divided the vast Region into I. Polynesia, II. Melanesia, III. Mikronesia, IV. Australia, and dealt with each separately. He stated the five distinct theories of the origin of the Polynesian race: I. a submerged Continent; II. South America; III. China and Japan; IV. New Zealand (autochthonous); and V. Malaysia. He then passed under review each Island and Language of Polynesia, stating that they were all of one Family. Passing on to Melanesia, he described the infinity of separate languages in this Region, which extends from Fiji to New Guinea, inclusive of both. He alluded to the great progress which had been made, and the linguistic books published: much more, however, remains to be done. In Mikronesia he alluded to the languages which had been studied in the Carolines, Ladrones, Marshall and Gilbert Groups, all North of the Equator. Of Australia he remarked that, though scores of languages were catalogued, the information supplied was most inadequate: in Tasmania the last Native had died; in Australia there were still about one hundred thousand surviving, and it was hoped that something might still be done with regard to this remnant.\n\nMr. G. W. Rusden, being called upon, bore testimony to the homogeneity of the language spoken by the Polynesian race throughout the Pacific; i.e. of the race to which the Maori belong. He had himself, in New Zealand, heard a Sandwich Islander, a native of Rarotonga, and Maori, joining together in an animated conversation about the events which are supposed to have preceded the migration of a portion of the people of Hawaii to the south in a fleet of canoes of which the names are still preserved. Slight differences of inflection, and the use by the Northerner of where the Maori used r, did not prevent freedom of discussion. Nor was such freedom of speech a new thing. When Captain Cook visited New Zealand in 1769, he took Tupia, a Tahitian, with him; and Tupia easily conversed with the Maori. On two other occasions Society Islanders interpreted between Captain Cook and the Maori (1773, 1776). As to the quarter from which the Maori traditions declare that their forefathers came, it is always the same\u2014from the Hawaiki in the north-east. The Rarotonga Islander, whose home is at the north-east of New Zealand, declares that his ancestors came from Avaiki, also in the north-east. At Tahiti the natives aver that their forefathers migrated thither from Hawaii. Hawaii, at the Sandwich Islands, is still, as of old, Hawaii; and the inhabitants preserve traditions of the departure of a fleet of canoes to the south-west. There seems no reason to doubt the\ntruth of these. If there were no other proof than they contain of the fancifulness of the speculation of the French writer (Lesson) who asserts that the Maori was autochthonous in New Zealand, and despatched numerous colonies throughout the Pacific as far as the Sandwich Islands, the well-authenticated genealogies of Maori families would suffice to destroy that theory. The Maori was proud of the nobility of his race. The eponymous heroes of the original pilgrim-fathers are venerated to this day. The records of each descent are preserved on a genealogical tree\u2014a notched wand\u2014on which the serrations indicate by their largeness or smallness whether the ancestor commemorated had a long or a short life. The accuracy of these genealogies has been tested in a singular manner in the Native Land Courts established by the Colonial Government. In tribes separated by long distance from one another, the wands were retained; and when, as sometimes happened, marriages occurred between members of distant tribes, the records in each tribe were so kept as, by collation, to convince the Judges of the trustworthiness of the genealogical trees. The speaker added\u2014Of this I have been assured by Mr. Fenton, late Chief Judge of the Land Court, who by the way has propounded a new theory as to the ancestry of the Polynesian or brown race. He has written a work, which I have presented to the Library of this Society, to prove that the Maori are sprung from the Sabaeans of Southern Arabia. He detects a kinship between Sabae and Savai, or Hawaii or Hawaii. The few places in the Pacific at which there are remains of architecture or sculpture are called in to support his theory. Very remarkable are those sculptures at Easter Island, to which I almost wonder that Dr. Cust did not allude. Gigantic idols, some said to be 70 feet high, abound there. No such works are found elsewhere in the Pacific, though in the Caroline Group, which lately formed a bone of contention between Germany and Spain, there are remains of what is said to be Cyclopean masonry, some of them submerged on the shore of a small island. But the progenitors of the Maori had stone-carved idols. Two were carried to New Zealand by the Arawa tribe, who occupied the Lake Country, the scene of recent eruptions. One of the idols is still preserved with veneration in the small island of Mokoia in Lake Rotorua; the other is in the possession of Sir George Grey, in his island Kawau.\n\nMr. H. H. Howorth, M.P., remarked that wherever a race which had no literature was distributed over a wide area, and presented few dialects in its speech, it was pretty certain that that race had spread comparatively recently from some focus. This was the case in such a typical example as Russia, and it seemed to him to be conclusive about the Polynesian race. Apart from this, wherever Polynesians were found south of the Equator, the peculiar fertility in devising ornaments, the character of the ornaments, and of the arts of the islanders, pointed to the Polynesians found there having invaded and occupied an area previously occupied by Melanesians, who were either incorporated or driven out. Such conclusion was\napplicable to all parts from Easter Island to New Zealand. All this confirmed remarkably the traditions of the New Zealanders themselves about a comparatively recent migration of their ancestors from one of the many Hawaiki of the Central and Northern Pacific, and also their traditions about finding other people when they arrived in New Zealand. His own view was that the Hawaiian Archipelago, which occupied an area known to be sinking, and marked by the best proofs of proximity to a sinking area, viz. volcanoes, represented the remains of a former small continent, which was the original home of the Polynesian race.\n\nSir George Campbell, M.P., Mr. Park Harrison, and Professor Terrien de Lacouperie, continued the interesting discussion which followed Dr. Cust\u2019s address. The attendance was unusually good. A large diagram of the Region referred to had been lent for the occasion by the Royal Geographical Society.\n\nThird Meeting, 21st February, 1887.\u2014E. L. Brandreth, Esq., in the Chair.\n\nElections: Mr. Charles Edward Johnston and Mr. Sydney Wynn Graystone as Resident Members, and Dr. Marc Aurel Stein as Non-Resident Member.\n\nA letter was read from Surgeon-General Bellew, regretting inability to read his \u201cNotes on the Names borne by some of the Tribes of Afghanistan\u201d\u2014the paper announced for this day\u2019s meeting\u2014owing to indisposition, and the strict prohibition of his medical adviser. The Chairman further intimated that as it had been thought advisable to defer consideration of this paper until the author\u2019s recovery, Captain Temple would give a short account of his several publications, notably Indian Notes and Queries and the Indian Antiquary. The impromptu address given was to the following effect: \u201cI have in my hand a copy of the Indian Notes and Queries, a journal started some years ago under the name of the Panjab Notes and Queries by a body of 31 gentlemen belonging to the Panjab Commission, and which I was asked to edit. Subsequently it passed entirely into my own hands, and the general interest taken in it so increased that, last year, in order to comply with the wishes of many of its supporters, and to enable me to extend its contents over a wider sphere, the title was changed to Indian Notes and Queries. In its present shape I merely conduct it, editing it so far as is necessary with the assistance of many competent scholars in all parts of Asia\u2014in Aden, Persia, Ceylon, Straits Settlements, Burma, Siam, China, Japan, and in all parts of India. And I apprehend that, in order to meet the ever-increas-\ning demand for space for notes from all parts of the East, the title will have to be still further widened to *Asiatic Notes and Queries*. The Journal began with 12 pp. of matter monthly, and I am now obliged to print 18 to 24 pp. in order to cope with the mass of useful and valuable matter that comes in. There seems to be no limit to the material available, as indeed might be expected from so wide a field to work upon\u2014and the size of the Journal is limited only by the subscription. The principle upon which the Journal is conducted, and the character of its contents, may be best gauged by a reference to the original prospectus, which says in effect that it affords a ready means of recording and rendering generally available all kinds of miscellaneous information regarding the country and the people, and also of an interchange of experience regarding practical difficulties. Englishmen in India are, as a rule, far too busy to undertake any systematic inquiry into the religious and social customs of the natives. But every resident in it is constantly meeting with curious and interesting facts bearing upon those customs; while every year old residents leave India in possession of the most varied and extensive information on the subject. Few have both leisure and inclination to publish this information; and indeed it is often so fragmentary and miscellaneous in its nature, and seems so much a matter of course to its possessor, that he does not think it worth while to work it up into literary shape; and so his knowledge dies with him, and never becomes generally available. If, however, some ready means are at hand of recording and publishing such odd scraps of information as they are picked up, many people, who will not be at the trouble of writing set articles for magazines or journals, avail themselves of those means and send rough notes to a periodical such as this, and in a few years there is thus formed a most valuable collection of facts regarding the country and its inhabitants. Such a collection increases our own knowledge of the people, and so enhances our influence over them, and renders our intercourse with them at once more easy and more interesting. But it has a still wider value. Within the last few years the learned have turned their attention to the institutions and structure of Indian society, and the need which they most often feel and express is for a larger supply of well-ascertained facts and for more minutely-detailed information. We constantly find European writers on social institutions quoting customs which they have laboriously discovered in old notices of strange tribes, and wholly unaware that the every-day routine of any Indian village would\nfurnish far better instances of the facts they are in search of. The periodical also serves yet another purpose. Every Indian official must have often felt the need of some ready means of exchange of information and experience with his fellow-workers. On all matters of principle, and on all important matters of practice, it is to his official superiors that he must look for instruction. But in the every-day routine of administration a thousand petty doubts and difficulties arise, which are hardly fit matter for official reference, but which must have been settled many times over in other districts and by other men. And a periodical in which he can state his difficulty and ask for advice affords him a means of availing himself of the experience of others. The principles, then, on which Indian Notes and Queries is conducted may be summarized thus. It admits short notes and articles, questions and answers to those questions on all points connected with the physical and ancient geography, antiquities, history, flora and fauna, or products of India; or with its people, their history, distribution, languages, caste, customs, trades, and occupations. It also admits similar notes and queries bearing upon any branch whatever of practical administration. But under no circumstances is any contribution admitted which can be interpreted as in any way criticising the principles followed, the measures adopted, or the rules of procedure laid down by Government. Politics, in fact, are strictly tabooed.\n\n\"I should like to say a few words as to my contributors. About half are natives of India, whose contributions give me much trouble, speaking as an editor, but they are welcome always, because it is to the natives that we must look for our best, minutest, and widest information. As the majority are not well acquainted with English, their notes require much editing and sitting. Many do not write English at all, and this entails a certain staff of native assistants, who turn the vernacular contributions into some kind of English, which has to be eventually worked up into a form suited to a high-class publication, and thus made available to students in a manner that would be otherwise impossible. Perhaps the most hopeful sign of all of the ultimate success of the periodical, is the number of natives of all classes that contribute to its pages.\n\n\"A few words will suffice for the Indian Antiquary, an old journal, well known to many Members of this Society. Dr. Burgess started it,\n\n1 Captain Temple here gave an illustration of the sort of note obtained and admitted in his Journal. The specimen selected was taken from under the head of Folk-Lore (No. 90 in vol. iv.).\nand edited it for 13 years, and rather more than two years ago Mr. Fleet and I took it over from him. I am happy to report that we have been successful in keeping it up to its former very high standard as regards contents, in materially increasing its circulation, and in procuring a constant succession of able contributions. During the Vienna Congress of Orientalists last year, I was much gratified in finding how great was the esteem in which it was held all over the Continent, and I trust that as long as the present editors conduct it that esteem will never be diminished. It is an expensive Journal for its size, but the comparatively high price is caused by the heavy expense entailed by the many and elaborate illustrations which are to be found in almost every number. It has always been the pride of the *Indian Antiquary* that it has done more for Oriental Epigraphy than has any other learned periodical, and that it has thus materially advanced our knowledge of early Indian history. But the constant reproduction of facsimiles of inscriptions and copperplates to scale is a very expensive and troublesome affair, and if the subscribers are called upon to pay rather more than is usual, they must kindly bear in mind that there is a very good reason for the demand. As regards this Journal, too, I am able to say that contributions are so plentiful of a first-class description that of late we have been obliged occasionally to issue double numbers, in order to keep up with them, and will have to do so frequently in the near future.\n\n\"I will only now trouble you with a few remarks on the *Legends of the Panjab*, published in volumes of twelve fasciculi each, the third volume being at this time in progress. The object of the work is to give the *ipsissima verba* of the bards of the Panjab, and so preserve the legends and stories of the people, and at the same time their various dialects. In this way it is hoped that our knowledge both of the ideas of the Panj\u00e1bi and of their language will be materially increased. The principle adopted is to give the text exactly as taken down from the lips of the bards, with a running translation and notes where necessary. These notes are often the most difficult portion of my task. By way of showing you how vast is the field to be thus worked, I may say that when I began I anticipated having matter enough to fill two volumes; but I have already filled nearly three, and even then I have not given more than half of the material I already have in hand. I may also say that not only in the Panjab, but everywhere in India from Peshawar to Cape Comorin, the bard is an institution,\nand that what he has to say is always for many scientific reasons worthy of recording. But there are signs beyond doubt that his popularity is on the decline, and that before very many years more it will be extremely difficult to make researches in this direction. It is indeed a case of now or never. I sincerely hope, therefore, that my work in the Panjab will not remain alone for long. In conclusion I have to say that I have shortly to go to new fields in Burma, where, however, I trust that I shall still be able to carry on the work I have above noticed. At any rate I am much encouraged to go on with it by the kindly manner in which you have listened to me this afternoon.\"\n\nA vote of thanks having been proposed to Captain Temple by Colonel Fryer, Dr. R. N. Cust rose to second the proposition. He not only thanked the above-named officer for his interesting discourse, but still more for the devotion of his talents and industry, in the midst of heavy official duties, to all subjects connected with India. The accomplished son of an accomplished father, his publications were of the highest importance; and all lovers of India must sincerely hope that Captain Temple might be spared for a long time to prosecute his studies in his new sphere of Mandalay. Dr. Cust alluded to the Choohur Shah Dowlah of the Punjab: parents who had the misfortune to have idiot and ill-formed children, used to consecrate them at the shrine of Shah Dowlah, where they were taken care of. They were called Choohur or Rats, from their extraordinary heads, shaped like a rat; and an enterprising showman, presuming upon the ignorance of the community, exhibited them at Paris in 1851 as Azteks or Earthmen of Central America. This would be impossible since publication of the full account of them in Captain Temple's book.\n\nII. PROCEEDINGS OF ASIATIC OR ORIENTAL SOCIETIES.\n\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, 4th August, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President, in the Chair.\n\nTwenty-four presentations were announced; the election of two Ordinary Members notified; and three candidates for election proposed.\n\nThe papers read were:\u2014On the Antiquity of Khotan, translated and compiled from the Tibetan MSS. the \"Bod-kye-yigtshang,\" and the \"Dsam-ling Gyeshi,\" by Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e2s, C.I.E.; and the same writer's translation of the Tibetan Chronological Table \"Re-humig,\" from the MSS. historical work, \"Choos-joong-\"\njonsang,\" compiled by Lama Yeshe Palgor of Amdo in 1747 A.D. Both are to be published in the Journal.\n\nIt was notified that the Government of Bengal had referred to the Society, for criticisms and suggestions, certain papers relating to an inquiry into the castes and occupations of the people of India now being prosecuted by Mr. Risley, C.S.\n\n3rd November, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President, in the Chair.\n\nSeventy-seven presentations were announced; the election of six Ordinary Members and six withdrawals notified; and one gentleman was proposed for election as an Associate Member. Intimation was also made of the death of three Ordinary and two Associate Members.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited three silver coins, being part of a find of Treasure Trove in the Khaira District; and read six Reports on other coins, chiefly silver, found in various places.\n\nThere were, moreover, read, a paper on the Land-shells of Perak; two papers on Butterflies, and a paper on Solar Thermometer Observations at Allahabad.\n\n23rd November, 1886 (Special Meeting).\u2014The President on this occasion introduced Mr. C. Stevens, of Brisbane, Australia, who read a paper on \"The result of inquiries and observations among the wild Veddahs of Ceylon, as to their religious belief, domestic and social life and intellectual capacity, undertaken with a view to obtaining a vocabulary and such information as would tend to solve the question as to the origin of the race.\"\n\nThe Chairman, in expressing the thanks of the meeting for the paper communicated, remarked on the existence of several kindred hill tribes in Kumaon, Nepal and Assam, who lived exactly like the Veddahs, entertaining a similar belief that they were superior to the natives of the plains. He thought it the duty of one or other of the Society's members to work up further inquiries in regard to the interesting people of whom Mr. Stevens had spoken.\n\n2nd February, 1887.\u2014Bearing this date, the Annual Address of the President has been separately printed. It supplies an interesting r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the year's events, more or less directly connected with the objects and interests of the Society. Three Englishmen have been selected for special mention from its obituary. These are our late Treasurer, Mr. Edward Thomas, and our late Vice-Presidents, Messrs. Gibbs and Grote. Of the papers in our own\nJournal which have attracted attention as dealing with Indian subjects are the contributions of Dr. Edkins, Sir Monier Monier-Williams, Mr. Sewell, Mr. Grierson, Mr. Pincott, and Capt. Talbot. Reference is made to the Oriental Congress at Vienna; and besides noting proceedings in Assam and Burma, the President sketches the local progress made in Semitic and Aryan studies, in Dravidian languages, in Bihari, and Vernacular literature in general. As regards the domain of Natural Science, the concluding sentence of the Address is strongly indicative of the true bent of the Indian mind. An indirect expression of regret at the little interest taken in the study by Native Members, is followed by the statement that \"perhaps with the exception of the late Babu Harimohun Mukharji and one gentleman in Bombay, there is not a single native of India, known outside its limits, for proficiency in either Botany or Biology.\"\n\nAsiatic Society of Japan, Tokyo, October 21st, 1885.\u2014B.

Dautremer, was read by the Secretary. It is published in part. ii. vol. xiv. also. After a few remarks, the annual reports were presented and adopted. With reference to the year's obituary, the Society had to express its sorrow at the loss of one of its oldest friends, Rear-Admiral Shadwell, and of a sound scholar, Mr. Thomas R. H.

The substance of these is not considered important, except on account of the Sanskrit dh\u0101ran\u012bs and quota-\ntions apparent in one of them; and Mr. Rockhill, who wrote a report on them in detail, adds, that the kind of Sanskrit text which they exhibit appears to be the only one now obtainable in and about the Chinese capital. He hoped, however, to ascertain later on whether there was not something of interest to be discovered at Wu t\u2019ai shan, the oldest sanctuary in Northern China.\n\nAn interesting letter from Protap Chandra Roy, dated Calcutta, July 17, 1886, was read; and a scheme of the Rev. Stuart Dodge submitted for founding a School of Biblical Archaeology and Philology in the East. Beirut is looked upon us the probable locality of the proposed Institution.\n\nThe following is a list of the papers read or accepted for reading:\n\n1.

Notes on Persian Literature from Tehran.\n\n10th February, 1887.\n\nSince writing my note on Rez\u0101 Qul\u012b Kh\u00e1n and his works, further details concerning some of that author's literary productions have reached me as follows: The Lat\u0101'if ul-'\u0100rif\u012bn is a S\u016bf\u012b tract in prose mixed with verse. The Ris\u0101l\u0101t ul-'\u0100rif\u012bn is divided into a Muqaddimmeh, called a \"Had\u012bqeh,\" two \"R\u014dzehs\" and a \"Ferd\u00f3s\"; concluding with a Kh\u0101timeh, called a \"Khuld.\" The Khuld contains a biography of the author. I hope to be able shortly to announce the publication here, in lithograph, of this biography of the S\u016bf\u012bs.\n\nThe Fehras ut-Tav\u0101r\u012bkh, a chronology of general Asiatic History, appears to have been lost, save that portion which was lithographed at Tabr\u012bz in A.H. 1280, but which has never been distributed. It may here be noted that the \"Muntazem N\u0101s\u012br\u012b\" of Muhammed Hasan Kh\u00e1n, San\u012b' ud-Dowleh, Mar\u0101gh\u012b, which is a Chronology of Historical Events in Asia from A.H. 1 to 1300, and which was issued in lithograph in three folios in A.H. 1298, 1299, and 1300 as a Year Book, is a very similar production. Volumes I. and II. of the \"Muntazem N\u0101s\u012br\u012b\" are taken up with general events; to each of these volumes a supplement is added, recording the events of the current year. Volume III. is devoted entirely to the Chronology of the Q\u0101j\u0101r dynasty. Volume II. contains a translation of a contemporary memoir on the Fall of the Sef\u0101v\u012bs, originally written in Latin, in the reign of Sh\u0101h Sult\u0101n Husain Sef\u0101v\u012b, by a European who had spent twenty-six years at Isfah\u0101n. This memoir was translated into Ottoman Turkish by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and entitled \"'Ibr\u0101t N\u0101meh.\" The Persian version is by 'Abd ur-Razz\u0101q Beg, author of the Persian original of Harford-Brydges' \"Dynasty of the K\u0101j\u0101rs.\" The same volume also contains an extract from M\u012brz\u0101 'Abd un-Neb\u012b Behbeh\u0101n\u012b's \"T\u0101r\u012bkh Afgh\u0101n\u012b,\" also a contemporary record of the Afgh\u0101n invasion of Persia.\n\nThe works of 'Ubaid Lak\u0101n\u012b, edited by M. Fert\u00e9 of the French Embassy at Constantinople, and printed in the clear and elegant type of the Ab\u016b az-Z\u012b\u0101 press at Constantinople\u2014for private circulation only\u2014have just appeared in one volume, dated 1303 A.H.\nThe Tarjum\u00e1n ul-Lughat of Muhammad Yahya Qazv\u00edn\u00ed is in the course of being re-lithographed here. This ponderous work, which is a Persian version of the Q\u00e1mus ul-Lughat of Majd ud-D\u00edn Ab\u00fa T\u00e1hir Muhammed B. Ya\u2019q\u00fab ul-Firuz\u00e1b\u00e1d\u00ed ush-Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, was completed by order of Sh\u00e1h Sult\u00e1n Husain Sef\u00e1v\u00ed, in A.H. 1117. The text being now re-lithographed is that prepared and published by 'Al\u00ed Asghar B. 'Abd ul-Jabb\u00e1r Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed in A.H. 1273.\n\nThe \u201cTabsiret ul-'Av\u00e1m\u201d of Murtez\u00e1 R\u00e1z\u00ed ul-Husain\u00ed, which is an exposition of the principal creeds of the East, has just been lithographed at Tehr\u00e1n, dated A.H. 1304, for the first time. Bound up with the Tabsireh is a re-litho of Muhammad B. Sulaiman Tenek\u00e1buni\u2019s \u201cQisas ul-'Ulam\u00e1,\u201d a biography of the \u2019Ulam\u00e1, which was originally lithographed in A.H. 1290.\n\nMacGahan\u2019s \u201cKhiva\u201d has been translated into Persian from the Ottoman Turkish version.\n\nSIDNEY J. A. CHURCHILL.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n3. Assyrian Names of Domestic Animals.\n\nJust before going to press we are favoured with the following note:\n\nAmong the names of animals found in the Assyrian and Babylonian lists it is, perhaps, noteworthy that many of those designating beasts of burden seem to be changes (as it were) rung on the roots m-r, b-r, p-r, b-l, and p-l; triliteralized, however, by the addition or insertion of a weak radical or vowel.\n\nThe following is a list giving most of those hitherto found:\n\n| Akkadian | Assyrian |\n|----------|----------|\n| mu-u-ru (m\u00fbru), young ass. |\n| mi-i-ru (m\u00eeru), young ox. |\n| bi-i-ru (b\u00eeru), ox. |\n| pi-i-ru (piru) elephant. |\n| pi-i-lu (p\u00eelu) |\n| bu-lu (b\u00fblu), animal. |\n| i-me-ru (\u00eemeru), ass. |\n| im-me-ru (immeru), sheep. |\n| i-bi-[ru] (\u00eebiru), a road-bull. |\n| i-bi-lu (\u00eebilu), an old ass(?). |\nTo these may be added the words *parru* and *parrat*, apparently 'bull' and 'cow' respectively. It is probable, also, that the Assyrian for 'son' *dplu* (Akk. *ibila*), and 'male child' *m\u0101ru* (fem. *m\u0101rtu*, Akk. *dum*), come from some of the above roots.\\(^1\\) The word *tibiru* (in Akkadian *am-si \u1e0darran* 'the horned bull of the road') is even found in Egyptian under the forms \\[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{\ud80c\udc03} \\\\\n\\text{\ud80c\udc04} \\\\\n\\text{\ud80c\udc05} \\\\\n\\text{\ud80c\udc06} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\] *\u0101bar*, \\[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{\ud80c\udc03} \\\\\n\\text{\ud80c\udc04} \\\\\n\\text{\ud80c\udc05} \\\\\n\\text{\ud80c\udc06} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\] *\u0101bari* 'an animal imported from Syria' (Chab. voy. p. 87, Brugsch, Pierret, Lauth, who all compare the Hebrew \\[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{\u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05df} \\\\\n\\text{\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d9} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\] Ps. xxii. 13, \\[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{\u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05df} \\\\\n\\text{\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d9} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\] 'bulls of Bashan'). The word was probably imported into Egypt with the animal.\n\nTheo. G. Pinches.\n\nIV. OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nAlthough the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society is neither privileged nor required to place on record in its Obituary Notices the services of statesmen and others who pass away from the living circle of distinguished public characters, on the mere plea that they happen to have been enrolled among its subscribers, it is nevertheless within its competence to give expression to its profound regret for the loss, and respect for the memory, of one who, like the late Earl of Iddesleigh, was not only a Member of eighteen years, but ever a keen promoter of education and literary research, and at one time Secretary of State for India. To add that the sentiment of the Society is universal, is not, in the present case, the utterance of a conventional platitude, but the assertion of a sober truth.\n\nBy the death of Sir Walter Elliot on the 1st of March, and of Mr. Alexander Wylie on the 6th of February, European Orientalists have lost two remarkable members of their body, each eminent in his particular sphere. As regards the first, although a brief notice of his career was in type, it has been thought advisable to await a fuller Memoir promised for the July number of the Journal. A similar course will be pursued in the case of the second, who, though not a Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, seems to merit a careful and substantial record.\n\nAccording to the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 11th of December, the Indian papers report the death of Babu Prasanna Kumar Sarvadhikari, for\n\n\\(^1\\) The ancient Babylonians seem to have derived *dplu* or *\u0101blu* from the root *\u0101p\u0101lu* 'to bring again,' pu'ul *\u0101ppulu* 'to produce.' The Akkadian *ibila* is therefore a borrowed word.\nmany years Principal of the Sanskrit College at Calcutta, and author of several mathematical treatises in the Bengali language. The same paper, on the 18th idem, announces also the death of Dr. John Nicholson, of Penrith, translator of Ewald's \"Hebrew Grammar,\" and, from the Arabic, of the History of the \"Fatimite Dynasty in Africa.\"\n\nV. Excerpta Orientalia.\n\nThe third number of the first part, vol. lv., Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, contains Mr. Theobald's \"Notes on some of the Symbols on the Coins of Kunanda\"; an article on the \"Mina tribe of J\u00e9ypur,\" by Kavi R\u00e1j Shy\u00e1mal D\u00e1s, translated by Babu Ram Prasad; Mr. C. J. Rodgers, on \"Coins supplementary to Mr. Thomas' Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Dehli\"; and Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, on \"Buddhist and other Legends about Khoten.\" As both the contributions of the European writers relate to coins, the brief notice which can be given to them in these pages will be under \"Numismatics.\" The second paper is the outcome of an inquiry concerning the Minas of the Kher\u00e1r, who are compared with the Bhils of the hilly tracts. As to their origin, the contributor gives what would appear to be the generally received opinion, but forms his own separate conclusions on the subject. With regard to Khoten, the scholarly local knowledge of Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s makes all he has to say worthy of attention.\n\nThe Journal Asiatique, huiti\u00e8me s\u00e9rie, tome viii., has in its No. 3 (Novembre-D\u00e9cembre, 1886), the final pages both of M. S\u00e9nart's study of the Piyadasi Inscriptions, and of M. Sauvaire's materials for a history of Muhamadan Numismatics and Metrology. In the Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes, M. Pavet de Courteille reviews Vamb\u00e9ry's Das T\u00fcrkenvolk in seinen Ethnologischen und Ethnographischen Beziehungen; M. Rubens Duval contributes an instructive notice of M. Chwolson's Syrische Grabenschriften aus Semirjetschie; and M. Oppert, under the head, \"Kakkab Mesri,\" argues in favour of his own particular version of a particular Assyrian inscription on a broken obelisk. No. 1 of vol. ix. contains \"Fragments d'un roman d'Alexandre, en dialecte Th\u00e9bain,\" by M. Urbain Bouriant; extracts from \"Tchou-tze-tsieh-yao-tchuen,\" a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the essential principles of the philosophy of Tchou-tze, bearing especially upon morals and the laws of propriety, by the learned Professor De Harlez of Louvain; and M. Clermont Ganneau's \"St\u00e8le de M\u00e9sa,\" commenting upon the inscription of the Moabite king M esa, as interpreted by MM. Smend and Socin (vide Academy, November 27).\n\nJournal of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. xix. Part 2. In his article on Yuen Fszts'ai, M. Imbault-Huart displays an unrivalled knowledge of the most difficult department\nof Chinese literature. But although the Chinese poet may have been justified in singing of himself, \"sous les trois derniers empereurs (K'anghs\u0131, Yangch\u00e9ng and K'ienlung), qui peut m'\u00eatre compar\u00e9 en litt\u00e9rature?\" his poetry, judging by M. Imbault-Huart's examples, hardly rises above the level of neatly-turned vers de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. In the same part is a dissertation by Mr. T. W. Kingsmill upon the S\u00e9rica of Ptolemy, containing much valuable and curious information, somewhat spoilt, perhaps, by a too random philology that takes no account of the achievements the last decade or two have witnessed in philological science.\n\nParts 1 and 2 of vol. xiv. Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, exhibit signs of life and vigour. The first contains Mr. Troup's article \"On the tenets of the Shinshiu or 'True' Sect of Buddhists;\" Mr. Cargill Knott's paper \"On the Abacus in its Historic and Scientific Aspects;\" \"Buddhism, and Traditions concerning its Introduction into Japan,\" by the Rev. James Summers; and Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain's \"Past Participle or Gerund? a point of grammatical terminology.\" In the second are \"A list of works, essays, etc., relating to Japan,\" compiled by Carlo Giussani\u2014a useful contribution, worthy the inspection of Japanese scholars, students, and bibliophiles in all parts of the world, who might supply possible omissions; \"The Art of Landscape Gardening in Japan,\" by Mr. J. Conder, with which may be coupled Mr. Dautremer's \"Situation de la Vigne\" in the same country; and an Aino-English Vocabulary, compiled by the Rev. J. Summers.\n\nThe following fasciculi of the Bibliotheca Indica (New Series, Nos. 575 to 585) have reached the Royal Asiatic Society during the quarter.\n\nSanskrit.\u20141.

Clermont-Ganneau's Recueil d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale, is the article headed \"Man\u00e9, Th\u00e9cel, Phar\u00e8s et le Festin de Balthasar,\" noted last quarter in the contents of the Journal Asiatique, tome viii. No. 1. Another contribution to the Recueil, on the unpublished Inscriptions of Palmyra, independently of its intrinsic value and interest, is rendered especially attractive by excellent illustrations. The whole publication adds honour even to the well-known reputation of M. Leroux.\n\nTome iv. of L'Histoire de l'Art dans l'Antiquit\u00e9, by Mons. Perrot and Chipiez, containing the three divisions Sardaigne, La Jud\u00e9e, and Les H\u00e9t\u00e9ens, is a splendid volume, full of interest and attraction. Jud\u00e6a has many references to the work of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and the names of Wilson and Warren are of constant recurrence in its pages. There is apparent in them a lament that so little of Jerusalem prior to the Captivity\u2014the Jerusalem of the Kings and greater Prophets\u2014has been restored; but no want of acknowledgment for the perseverance and energy of those who undertook and carried out the long and continuous exploration. \"Sans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat que le public anglais porte \u00e0 tout ce qui, de pr\u00e8s ou de loin, se rattache aux \u00e9tudes bibliques, jamais on n'aurait eu l'id\u00e9e d'entreprendre\ndes fouilles aussi dispensieuses, aussi laborieuses, aussi dangereuses que celles de Mons. Warren et Wilson,\u201d is a sentence which may be quoted as characteristic of French opinion; and the estimate is one at which Englishmen should have no reason to demur. Professors Wright and Sayce are largely quoted in the division appropriated to \u201cLes H\u00e9t\u00e9ens,\u201d subdivided again into four chapters as follows:\n\n1. Hittites: their history and writing. 2. Northern Syria: Eastern Hittites. 3. Asia Minor: Western Hittites. 4. Monuments of Hittite Art in Asia, on this side the Halys.\n\nThe second part of Mr. Growse\u2019s \u201cIndian Architecture of to-day, as exemplified in the new buildings in the Bulandshahr district,\u201d is not only of interest from a number of well-executed photographs, with descriptive letterpress; but its Preface and Epilogue invite the sympathy of aesthetic and art-loving readers\u2014especially those whose opinions are not hampered by forced allegiance to Departments of State. Mr. Growse has done admirable service to the cause he so earnestly advocates; and the architectural results of his labours at Bulandshahr are alone monuments of a taste and industry on the exercise of which both he and the district may be warmly felicitated. Among the photographs, the \u201cGarden Gate\u201d and the \u201cColvin Gate\u201d should arrest the attention of the most phlegmatic observer.\n\nThe Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, published in January, contains the full report of the Anniversary Meeting held on the 22nd June, at which the Archbishop of York, President of the Society, took the Chair. After his Grace\u2019s impressive address, Mr. Glaisher, Sir George Grove, Sir Charles Wilson, Captain Conder, and Canon Tristram spoke well and to the purpose; Mr. John MacGregor followed with the relation of an appropriate incident of exploration; and Professor Hayter Lewis, strong not only in general acquaintance with his theme, but in the fact of having paid a second and recent visit to Jerusalem, closed the discussion with some interesting observations. Among these may be here noted \u201ca tribute of respect to the memory of Mr. Fergusson,\u201d who is called \u201cone of our most zealous of Biblical scholars,\u201d who \u201cdevoted an immense amount of energy and literary research to the subject,\u201d and regarding whom all would bear witness \u201cto the great learning, the great skill, and the great earnestness with which he pursued his work.\u201d Besides the Report, there are many valuable contributions to the Journal by MM. Schumacher and Clermont-Ganneau, Sir Charles Warren, M. Conrad Schick, and others, some accompanied by well-executed illustrations.\n\nIn connection with the work of the Fund aforesaid, mention may be made of a paper read in January before the Jews\u2019 College Literary Society, by Marcus N. Adler, Esq., under the presidency of Sir Charles Warren, who referred to the lecture as throwing much light \u201con the ancient customs and traditions of Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nThe Indian Antiquary for December contains \u201cA Selection of\nKanarese Ballads,\u201d \u201cSanskrit and Old-Kanarese Inscriptions, Nos. 166 and 167,\u201d and \u201cSome Fantastic Characters,\u201d by Mr. Fleet; the Rev. S. Beal\u2019s remarks \u201cOn the Age and Writings of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva;\u201d a paper on the \u201cHathasni Inscription of the Mehara Chief Thepaka,\u201d with a note by Mr. Fleet; Pramada-Dasa Mitra\u2019s Sanskrit translation of the British National Anthem; together with an instalment of Mr. Patlibhai D. H. Wadai\u2019s \u201cFolk Lore in Western India,\u201d and one of Pandit S. M. Natesa Sastri\u2019s \u201cFolk Lore in Southern India.\u201d In the January number, Mr. Fleet resumes his exposition of Sanskrit and Old-Kanarese Inscriptions, with an analysis of the \u201cKauthem Plates of Vikrama-Ditta V.;\u201d the December articles on Folk Lore are continued; and there are contributions on \u201cThe Dakhan in the time of Gautama-Buddha,\u201d by the Rev. Thomas Foulkes; the \u201cStudy of Asiatic Symbolism,\u201d by Mr. Murray-Aynsley; the \u201cGrammar of Sakatayana,\u201d by Prof. Kielhorn; and on the Gipsy Language and People, by Mrs. Grierson and Mr. Grierson respectively. The \u201cMiscellanea\u201d are learned and instructive, and there is a Book Notice referring to the Kavyamala, \u201ca collection of old and rare Sanskrit K\u0101vyas, N\u0101takas, Champ\u016bs, Bh\u0101\u1e47as, Prahasanas, Chhandas, Al\u0101\u1e45k\u0101ras, etc., edited by Pandita Durgaprasada and Kashinatha Panduranga Paraba.\u201d\n\nHebrew and Semitic Languages.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of December 4 has an interesting paper by Professor Neubauer on \u201cAzazel and Goat Worship.\u201d That the word Azazel signified a pagan divinity is not perhaps so clearly shown as that the goat itself had a sacred character among Canaanitish tribes; but the names En-gedi, one of the six cities in the wilderness, Gadi, the father of Menahem, and Gaddiel, the son of Sodi, especially the first, may bring evidence to that effect. The writer says that from the Mishnah we learn only that \u201cthe Azazel was considered by the tradition of the Rabbis to be a steep mount, which is called Tsook. In the book of Enoch Azazel is turned into a demon.\u201d\n\nThe Academy of 25th December has a contribution by the Rev. J. Davies on the word \u201cKip\u00f4d,\u201d found only in Isaiah xiv. 23, xxxiv. 11; and in Zephaniah ii. 14. \u201cIn our Authorized Version,\u201d he writes, \u201cit is translated \u2018bittern,\u2019 and in the Revised Version, following the Septuagint, \u2018porcupine.\u2019 Rabbi Kimchi says that it is the name of a bird that dwelt in desolate places, but Rabbi Joseph says that its proper meaning is \u2018tortoise,\u2019 and Rabbi Salomon wavers between the meanings of \u2018hedgehog\u2019 and \u2018owl.\u2019 Buxtorf asserts that it was a name of the Anataria, a kind of eagle that dwells in marshy places. The Arabic version of the word is Al-houbara, which is said by Shaw to be the name of a bird nearly as large as a capon.\u201d Mr. Davies is of opinion that the word is a form of the Sanskrit Kap\u014dta, \u201ca kind of pigeon that has always been a bird of ill-omen.\u201d This recalls the Persian kab\u016btar, a word well known throughout India; while the houbara (ub\u00e1ra) is a familiar sound to many Indian sportsmen who are acquainted with the species of bustard otherwise called \u201ctil\u016br.\u201d\n\"Some Books of Hebrew Philology,\" being works by Dr. Delitzsch, M. Jastrow, and Dr. W\u00fcnsche, afford the reviewer an opportunity of recording in the Academy of the 5th February certain learned and appropriate remarks, worthy the attention of the Hebrew student, who will not improbably be led to consult the original books brought to notice.\n\nDr. Neubauer's labours in compiling the Catalogue of the Hebrew Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library form the subject of an appreciative review in the Athen\u00e6um of the 18th December. To the same article belongs a notice of forty Facsimiles that accompany the Catalogue, which include \"the well-known autograph of the great Maimonides, and, for completeness, the curious script recently discovered by Dr. Harkavy.\" In the next succeeding issue of the Athen\u00e6um is the statement that Dr. Steinschneider has completed his Bibliographical Supplement to Benjacob's \"Treasure of Hebrew Books\" (Wilna, 1880), which is arranged alphabetically according to titles.\n\nArabic.\u2014The Academy of 4th December has a favourable notice of Mukkadasi's Description of Syria, as translated by Mr. Guy Le Strange. It is one of the publications of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society, and a fair specimen of the good work they have set themselves to perform. In the following week, Miss Edwards reviews Lady Burton's edition of her husband's Arabian Nights, coming to the conclusion that a large debt of gratitude is due by the public \"for the happy thought which places an inaccessible work at the disposal of all sorts and conditions of readers.\"\n\nSir Richard Burton writes to the Academy of the 22nd January, to impart the discovery of the original text of the \"Zayn al-Asnam and Aladdin,\" both of which so-called \"Gallandian tales\" are contained in two folios written in a modern Syrian hand, recently purchased by M. Hermann Zotenberg, of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of 25th December says that among the MSS. brought by Dr. Harkavy from the East is a large fragment of an Aramaic text of Karaitic casuistic rules (Halakhah) which may possibly turn out to be a fragment of the 'Fadlakhah' of Anan (the founder of the Karaite sect).\n\nFasciculus ii. of Part i. of Howell's Grammar of the Classical Arabic Language merits more than the hurried notice which could be given in the current number of the Journal. Analysis of this important work must therefore be deferred for the present. Meanwhile, it may be stated that it meets with approval in the Calcutta Review for January, and is pronounced in that periodical to be in some respects superior to the Grammars of Forbes and Palmer.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of 1st January reports that Dr. Simeone Levi has commenced the publication of the 'Hieroglyphic-Coptic-Hebrew Vocabulary,' for which the Accademia dei Lincei at Rome awarded him the great quadrennial prize founded by the King of Italy. The Italian Ministry of Public Instruction contributes \u00a330 to this important publication.\nAssyriology.\u2014The first instalment of Tiele's *Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte*, forming part of a series of \"Hand Books of Ancient History,\" under publication at Gotha, has recently been issued, and is reviewed in the *Academy* of the 1st January, a number which contains also mention of M. Berthelot's paper read before the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, on \"Certain Metals and Minerals used in Ancient Assyria and Chald\u00e6a.\" One vase of pure antimony, and a statuette of copper devoid of tin, are cited as remarkable specimens of unalloyed metal brought home by M. Sarzec.\n\nM. Bertin, in a letter to the *Academy* dated 8th January, answers a question put by Dr. Edkins, as to whether the Babylonians had a zodiac of twenty-eight signs. He says that they never made use of a zodiac of twelve signs, but had thirty divisions of the ecliptic, and that he had found in the British Museum a tablet giving their names. The correspondence is continued by Mr. G. Brown in a letter from Barton-on-Humber, dated January 24, published in the *Academy* of the 29th idem.\n\nAccording to a notice in the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 8th January, M. Strassmaier's book (Leipzig, Hinrichs), with the bilingual title *Alphabetisches Verzeichniss der Assyrischen und Akkadischen W\u00f6rter der Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia*, vol. ii, contains about 10,600 words \"gathered together during the course of several years' study of the published and unpublished cuneiform texts preserved in the British Museum, Liverpool Museum, and elsewhere; and the other volumes of the 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia' have been laid under contribution.\"\n\nThe next part of this Journal will contain an article by Mr. T. G. Pinches, upon the document known as \"the Babylonian Chronicle.\" This ancient record (of which a paraphrase has been published in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology) has a peculiar interest, and will be found to be of great value to Bible students. It treats principally of affairs in Babylonia, beginning with the reign of Nabonassar; but refers also incidentally to Assyria and Elam, a part of the chronology of which last-named country it enables us to restore. The chronicle forms part of an ancient record, extending from the earliest to the latest period of Babylonian history, and was probably meagre at first, but given in greater detail as time went on, and the records were more carefully kept. Of the complete series, if such could be obtained, it is difficult to over-estimate the value.\n\nSmith (S. A.), *Die Keilschrift Texte Assurbanipal*, part 1, is announced among new publications.\n\nTwo more numbers of the *Babylonian and Oriental Record* have given a kind of stability to this new record of the \"Antiquities of the East\"; more especially as the last issue shows an increase of nine declared collaborateurs, making thirty-six in all. In No. 4, for October, Professor De Harlez continues his \"Iranian Studies;\" Mr. Pinches has three \"Babylonian Notes,\" treating of two\nkings\u2014Gadd\u00e2s and Tarz\u00eea\u2014and the Deities Ilan and Har; Mr. Tyler discourses on the \"Babylonian idea of a disembodied Soul,\" and Professor de Lacouperie asks, \"Did Cyrus introduce Writing into India?\"\u2014seeing in the word \"Khar\u00f6st\u00ee\" used in the Lalita-vistara, a probable recipient of the name of the Persian monarch. No. 5 contains \"A Babylonian Land Grant,\" interpreted by Mr. Boscawen; a suggested illustration by a Babylonian seal of a verse in the New Testament, by the Rev. W. A. Harrison; a continuation of the Pahlavi study by Prof. De Harlez; \"A Fragment of a Babylonian Tithe-List,\" by Mr. Pinches; and a \"Note on Babylonian Astronomy,\" by Mr. W. T. Lynn. In the concluding notices, promise is held out of interesting discussions.\n\nThe Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie for November contains, irrespective of the Sprachsaal, Reviews, and Lists of recent publications, the following articles:\u20141. Ueber einen Nebukadnezar-cylinder des Berliner Musuems, von Hugo Winckler. 2. Grammatische Bemerkungen zu den Annalen Asurnasirpal's, von Ernst M\u00fcller. 3. The Hittite Boss of Tarkondemos, by A. H. Sayce. 4. Bemerkungen zu einigen Sumerischen und Assyrischen Verwandtschaftsw\u00f6rtern, von P. Jensen. 5. Mene tekel upharsin, von Th. N\u00f6ldeke, with reference to M. Clermont-Ganneau's interpretation in the Journal Asiatique. 6. Kleinere Assyriologische Notizen, von Friedrich Delitzsch. 7. Two unedited Texts, K. 6 and K. 7, by S. A. Smith. In the \"Sprachsaal,\" M. Oppert has something to say on the \"Mul Kaksidi,\" or vexata questio of the Star, to which allusion has already been made.\n\nAramaic.\u2014Dedicated to his much-respected teacher, N\u00f6ldeke, the \"Aramaischen Fremdw\u00f6rter im Arabischen\" of Siegmund Fraenkel, mentioned among the new issues of last quarter, exhibits the learned treatment of a subject which tells of a labour of love, as of scholarship.\n\nEthiopic.\u2014Among late announcements is: Praetorius, F., Grammatica \u00c6thiopia cum paradigmatibus, litteratura, Chrestomathia et Glossaria, Karlsruhe, Reuther.\n\nHittite.\u2014Capt. Conder, so well known in connection with the Palestine Exploration Fund, whose recent book on Syrian Stone Lore (reviewed in the Atheneum of 26 February) merits special recognition, has lately come forward as the exponent of Hittite inscriptions. The result of his later inquiries will be looked for with interest by those who read his report on the subject to the Times.\n\nAryan Languages.\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014In introducing Dr. Speijer's Sanskrit Syntax (Brill, Leyden) to English students, Dr. Kern pronounces it to be the \"first complete syntax of classical Sanskrit,\" expressing, at the same time, his hope that it may be \"the forerunner of a similar work, as copious and conscientious, on Vaidik Syntax.\"\n\nThe Revue Critique of December 6 notices Dr. W. Solf's Die Kasimir-Recension der Paned\u00e7ik\u0101, with acknowledgment of its\nusefulness as an aid to the critical examination of the story of Bilhana, author of the Vikram\u0101nkadevacarita\u2014or rather of the circumstances attending the composition of his poem of fifty stanzas (pa\u00f1c\u0101cat); but demurs to the unqualified acceptance of Dr. B\u00fchler's Kashmirian MS. as disposing of the whole question. According to some, the poet was condemned to death for a love-intrigue with his fair and royal pupil: but the later evidence would show his offence to have been forgiven. M. Sylvain L\u00e9vi, the critic of the Revue, considers the point still unsettled.\n\nParts i. and ii. of the eighth volume of Rajendral\u0101la Mitra's \"Notices of Sanskrit MSS.\" have reached the Society's Library during the past quarter; also the following, received from the Secretary of State for India:\u2014Commentary of Govindar\u0101ja on Man\u0101va-Dharma S\u0101sana, edited with notes by R\u00e1o S\u00e1hib Vishvan\u00e1th N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Mandlik, C.S.I. Parts xxi. xxiii. xxviii. and xxix. of \"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, translated into English Prose,\" stated to be \"published and distributed, chiefly gratis, by Protap Chandra Roy,\" should, moreover, be acknowledged.\n\nAmong new publications are noticed:\u2014Panini's Grammatik: hrsg. \u00fcbers. erl\u00e4utert. etc. v. O. B\u00f6htlingk, 6 Lfg. Leipzig, Haessel. Speijer, J. S., Sanskrit Syntax. Leiden, Brill.\n\nPersian.\u2014In the Athen\u00e6um of December 11th, the reviewer of \"Persia as it is,\" by Dr. C. J. Wills, says:\u2014\"These bright sketches of Persian life form a worthy continuation of the preceding volume, and augur a successful career in the paths already trodden.\" The same book is approvingly noticed by Mr. C. E. Wilson in the Academy of Jan. 15. And of Mr. Benjamin's \"Persia and the Persians,\" noticed in the last number of the R.A.S. Journal, while the Athen\u00e6um (15th January) recommends it as \"a gift book combining novelty, instruction, and a graceful exterior;\" the Academy admits that, with certain drawbacks, it is \"interspersed with much interesting and trustworthy information.\"\n\nMr. F. F. Arbuthnot's \"Persian Portraits\" is a small volume intended to convey, in a simple and popular form, such information on Persian history, literature, manners and customs, and politics, as would be useful to those who may not care or have leisure to become Oriental scholars or students. As regards \"literature\" there is not only supplied a sketch of the subject generally, but the whole question itself occupies more than three-fourths of the book. A separate notice is given to each of seven Greater and fourteen Lesser Poets (a classification which might, perhaps, be disputed), and the various forms of Persian poetry and some popular tales and stories current in the country are summarized for the reader.\n\nThe first part of Mittelpersische Studien, by C. Salaman, has been published among the \"M\u00e9langes Asiatiques\" from the Bulletin de l'Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale des Sciences de St. P\u00e9tersbourg, tome ix. It treats of the Ganjeshaya-gan, Andarze Atrep\u00e2t M\u00e1raspand\u00e1n, M\u00e1dig\u00e1ne Chatrang, and Andarze Khusroe K\u00e1vat\u00e1n, by P. D. B.\nSanjana, mentioned in the R.A.S. Journal for October under the head of Pahlavi. The original text in that language is transliterated in Zend characters, and translated into Gujarati and English.\n\nTurkish.\u2014The first part of the second volume of M. Barbier de Meynard\u2019s \u201cDictionnaire Turc-Fran\u00e7ais\u201d has appeared, and brings up the purely lexicographic process to the verb \u0635\u0627\u0646\u0639. Three more parts will complete the work, the condition of which is to supplement heretofore published dictionaries by giving: 1. words of Turkish origin; 2. Arabic and Persian words used in Osmanli; 3. proverbs and popular forms of expression; and 4. a geographical vocabulary applicable to the latest distribution of territory throughout the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Turkish Race.\u2014In his retrospect of the year for Hungary, contributed to the Athen\u00e6um, under \u201cContinental Literature in 1886,\u201d Professor Vamb\u00e9ry says with reference to his work bearing the above designation (\u2018A T\u00f6r\u00f6k Faj\u2019): \u201cI have tried to comprise in that book partly my own personal experiences gathered during my travels among the Turkish-speaking races of the world, partly the notes I collected from reading Turkish, Persian, Arabic and Russian descriptions of the people, extending from the banks of the Iena to the shores of the Adriatic.\u201d\n\nIt may interest readers of the Journal who took note of the literary controversy referred to in page 467 (July, 1886), to learn the nature of M. Vamb\u00e9ry\u2019s reply to M. Hunfalvy on the Turko-Tatar and Finn-Ugric question. The substance of his statement made before the Academy of Sciences at Budadapest on the 22nd November last was as follows:\u2014His opponent looked upon language alone as the principal, if not sole guide, in investigating the origin of a nation; though it is evident that language was of a changeable and transient character. Numerous instances might be adduced of a purely Iranian people speaking an Ural-Altaic language or vice versa. It was doubtful whether M. Hunfalvy could succeed in proving to the satisfaction of all that the Magyar language belonged to the Finn-Ugric type, and, if he could, it did not follow that the Magyar nation must be of Finn-Ugric origin. His own inquiries confirmed him in the opinion that the Magyars were \u201can offshoot from the Turkish stem.\u201d The very name \u201cMagyar\u201d was an ethnical rather than political expression, characterizing a warlike, conquering, Turkish host, making its way from the southern slopes of the Altaic mountains towards the river Volga. The word \u2018Magyar,\u2019 in the Turkish language majar (\u0645\u062c\u0631), meant \u2018lord,\u2019 \u2018sovereign,\u2019 \u2018commander,\u2019 and in reality this was the \u201cappellation by which the Turkoman and the Khirgiz of to-day called their foreign masters. These children of the wilderness addressed their Russian conquerors as: \u2018majar-im, cajar-im,\u2019 meaning \u2018my lord!\u2019\u201d\n\nChina.\u2014The Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, at their sitting of the 19th November last, conferred the Stanislas Julien Prize for the best work relating to China, on Father S\u00e9raphin\nCouvreur, for his Franco-Chinese Dictionary (Ho-kien-fou, 1884). Professor Terrien de Lacouperie furnishes an interesting paper to the Academy of February 19th, on \"A new writing from Western China.\" In it he gives an account of the Shui-kia or \"Water People,\" from whom the MS. in question is said to have been obtained.\n\nCochin-China.\u2014The May-June number of Excursions et Reconnaissances opens with a continuation of M. Aymonier's Notes on Annam, the scope of which the writer explains to have been considerably narrowed by the events of July, 1885. So far, however, as the inquiry has been pursued, he has succeeded in putting together much valuable information both on the country and people visited. M. Aymonier has added a further paper on the method of transcription adopted for Europeanising the native written character. The other articles in this number are the short account of a trip by steamer in the M\u00e9kong, by M. Reveilli\u00e8re, and a \"Dictionnaire-Stieng\"\u2014being a collection of 2500 words of the Stieng language\u2014together with a description of the Stiens of Brolam, by Father Az\u00e9mar, Missionnaire Apostolique. Both of these contributions are to be continued, and promise information of a novel and useful kind.\n\nBurma.\u2014Although Mr. Smeaton's book on the Loyal Karens of Burma meets with carefully directed criticism in the Academy of Jan. 29th, those who are not acquainted with local Burmese history may find in the small volume referred to much interesting matter about an interesting people.\n\nTr\u00fcbner's American, European and Oriental Literary Record, No. 231, states, with reference to the collection of manuscripts lately in the possession of King Theebaw, and now in the India Office: \"It is due to the energy and influence of Dr. Rost that this invaluable treasure was secured for the Library entrusted to his care, and he has thereby at once succeeded in making the India Office Collection of Pali and Burmese MSS. by far the most important one in existence. He can boast of having added to an already extensive and valuable collection over 500 beautiful and costly MSS., of which about 200 are Burmese and the remainder Pali. While many of the Burmese MSS. are translations of, or commentaries on, Pali books, others are peculiarly interesting, particularly because they treat almost exclusively of the modern history of Burma and Siam.\"\n\nJapan.\u2014M. Guimet, whose interest in the life and art of Japan is well known, has printed a lecture he gave some time since at the Cercle St. Simon on the Theatre in Japan, which is well worthy of perusal, and gives a clear and picturesque account of the strange phase of Japanese manners presented by the stage and audience of a shibaya. He does not, however, explain the etymology of the word used for a theatrical representation, an etymology full of interest and significance. Shiba-i means simply 'amid the grass,' and carries us back to the time when spectacular exhibitions were\nheld al fresco on a cleared spot of ground, while the audience squatted around 'amid the grass' or bushes. So, only a few centuries ago, the Cornishmen assembled in their 'rounds' to witness the miracle plays which Norris's labours have preserved.\n\nM. Guimet's account ends with a brief statement of the plots of three popular tragedies, of which one, that of the Chushingura or Loyal League, founded on the story of the 47 R\u014dnin, so well told by Mr. Mitford, has been translated into English. It may be doubted whether M. Guimet's estimate of the Japanese theatre is not a somewhat extravagant one; but it is certain that many Japanese comic actors show great artistic power, and excite among their own countrymen a quite boundless enthusiasm. M. Guimet's brochure, it should be added, is embellished by characteristic illustrations, drawn by that inimitable delineator of Japanese life, F\u00e9lix Regamey\u2014the duett of dancing girls on p. 30, in especial, represents the peculiar charm of the 'musum\u00e9' with singular fidelity and grace.\n\nThe Academy of December 11th has a long and appreciative notice, by Mr. Cosmo Monkhouse, of Mr. Anderson's Pictorial Arts of Japan, and Descriptive and Historical Catalogue of a Collection of Japanese and Chinese Paintings in the British Museum. Parts iii. and iv. of the former form also the subject of an elaborate review in the Athen\u00e6um of the 26th February.\n\nIn the Academy of February 26th, it is stated that Bunyin Nanjio, now Professor of Sanskrit at Tokio, had been sent by his Monastery on a scientific and religious mission to India. Having come to Oxford some years ago to study Sanskrit under Prof. Max M\u00fcller, he received, on leaving India, the honorary degree of M.A. He is the author of works on Buddhism, and translator into Japanese of Max M\u00fcller's Sanskrit Grammar.\n\nThe first part of the Memoirs of the Literature College of the Imperial University of Japan, which has just appeared, consists of an essay on Japanese and Aino Philology, by Mr. B. H. Chamberlain, that will sustain the high reputation of the recently-appointed Professor of Philology, and a Grammar of the Aino\u2014or more correctly Ainu\u2014language, by the Rev. J. Batchelor, who has laboured during many years among the almost unknown dwellers in the northernmost parts of the Japanese group, that entirely supersedes all previous work on the subject. Mr. Chamberlain's essay contains a most interesting investigation of place-names in Japan, many of which, from Aomori to Kagoshima, he finds to be of Aino origin, showing that the aboriginal population of the entire Japanese archipelago was, in great part at least, of Aino race. Of these important contributions to philological science no adequate notion can be given here, but Mr. Dickins proposes to prepare a summary of Messrs. Chamberlain and Batchelor's work, adding some comments of his own, that will supply the deficiencies of the present notice.\n\nEgyptology.\u2014The fourth annual general meeting of the Egypt\nExploration Fund was held on December 8th, in the theatre of the Royal Institution, Albemarle Street. The objects of the Fund, as submitted to and approved by this meeting, are as follows:\n\n\"(1) To organize excavations in Egypt, with a view to further elucidation of the history and arts of Ancient Egypt and to the illustration of the Old Testament narrative in so far as it has to do with Egypt and the Egyptians; also to explore sites connected with early Greek history, or with the antiquities of the Coptic Church, in their connexion with Egypt. (2) To publish, periodically, descriptions of the sites explored and excavated, and of the antiquities brought to light. (3) To ensure the preservation of such antiquities by presenting them to museums and similar public institutions.\" At the meeting on December 8th, Miss Amelia B. Edwards (Hon. Sec.) was able to announce the completion of the Fowler Fund, founded in 1883 by Mr. William Fowler, who offered a challenge of \u00a350, provided that nineteen other donors could be found to give the same sum. The Treasurer's report showed an increase on last year's support. Probably the Tahpanhes excavations will have done much to excite the interest of the public generally in the valuable labours of the Egyptian explorers.\n\nMr. Ernest Gardner gave some account of his second season's work at Naukratis. Mr. J. S. Cotton informed the meeting that Professor Masp\u00e9ro had been elected Hon. Fellow of Queens' College, Oxford, and read portions of a report by Mr. Griffith on recent excavations at Gemayemi (some three miles from Nebesheh) and Kantara. Miss Edwards read Mr. Flinders Petrie's report of work at Naukratis, at Nebesheh (ancient Egyptian \"Am\"), at Tell Ferain (Buto), and at Tell Defenneh (Tahpanhes). Miss Edwards then read her own report, giving first a retrospective glance at the past work which had been so rich in results, and a prospective glance at the future, pointing to the expedition of M. Naville, whose object would be\u2014in continuation of his work at Pithom and Goshen\u2014to determine the route of the Exodus. Donations of antiquities to the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts at Boston, U.S.A., and various other Museums, were then voted.\n\nThe Academy of Dec. 4th announces M. Masp\u00e9ro's two courses of Lectures in Egyptology at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes: (1) On the interpretation of hieratic texts of the early Empire, with special reference to the Berlin papyrus 3, containing a dialogue between an Egyptian and his soul; and (2) On the representations of armour and fighting in the monuments. The same paper tells that M. Guieyesse is lecturing on Egyptian Grammar.\u2014Dec. 11th gives a brief account of a paper read by Mr. J. Offord, jun., upon \"The Papyrus Literature of Ancient Egypt as illustrated by Recent Discoveries,\" and mentions the beginning of the publication of the Archduke Rainer's Fayum Papyri.\u2014In Jan. 8th is an account of the Recent Excavations at Gizeh, by Mr. Flinders Petrie.\u2014In Jan. 22nd a letter by Professor Sayce on the inscribed Ostraka still to be found in the mounds of\nancient cities in Egypt. This No. has also a short notice of Prof. Pott's *Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft* und Carl Abel's *Aegyptische Sprachstudien*. Under the head \"Egyptian Jottings,\" Miss Edwards announces a course of Stone Lectures on Egyptology to be delivered in America by Dr. Kellogg, and a course by Prof. Taylor on Egyptological subjects at the Peabody Institute, Baltimore; and notices a small pamphlet, by Major G. T. Plunkett, R.E., entitled \"Walks in Cairo.\" She also refers to Masp\u00e9ro's derivation of the name of Asia from *Asi*, the ancient Egyptian name for the island of Cyprus. In the *Academy* of Feb. 12th is a review of Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge's \"Sarcophagus of Ankhnesraneferab,\" by Miss Edwards, who contributes in the No. for Feb. 19th a report from M. Naville, showing the results of his first week's tour in the district of Goshen. In the same paper is a letter from Cairo giving some account of the fallen statue of Ramses II. at Memphis, and stating that the work of raising the Colossus was begun by a party of the Royal Engineers on Feb. 4th.\n\nThe *Athen\u00e6um* for Feb. 5th quotes from the *Weser Zeitung* that Prof. A. Ascherson, the botanist of the University of Berlin, is engaged with his friend Prof. Schweinfurth upon a Catalogue of the Egyptian Flora, which is to be published this year by the *Aegyptisches Institut*. The number of hitherto known species of Egyptian plants is said to be 1260. Prof. Ascherson, the *Athen\u00e6um* tells us, was to start in February upon a journey in Lower Egypt. His intention is to explore the less-known parts of the Nile Delta, and then to follow the march of the Children of Israel through the wilderness, according to the theory of Schleiden and Brugsch. The journey is to be at the cost of the Egyptian Government, and will probably last about three months.\n\nThe *Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient* for February has a paper by A. v. Schweiger-Lerchenfeld, entitled \"Cultur Einfl\u00fcsse und Handel in \u00e4ltester Zeit,\" which is to be continued later.\n\nIn the *Deutsche Litteraturzeitung*, No. 3, Jan. 15th, is a notice of Meyer's \"Geschichte des alten Aegyptens.\"\n\nThe *Revue Egyptologique*, quatri\u00e8me volume, Nos. iii.-iv., contains, amongst other articles\u2014Memoire sur quelques inscriptions trouv\u00e9es dans la sepulture des Apis, par le Vicomte Emmanuel de Roug\u00e9.\u2014Religion et mythologie des anciens Egyptiens d'apr\u00e8s les monuments (Paul Pierret).\u2014Une inscription Grecque de Ptol\u00e9ma\u00efs (Menshi\u00e9h) (M. Miller).\u2014Le po\u00e8me de Pentaour (J. de Roug\u00e9).\u2014Une page de l'histoire de la Nubie (E. Revillout).\u2014Lettre \u00e0 M. Revillout sur les contrats Grecs du Louvre provenant de Faioum (Charles Wessely).\u2014Tess\u00e8res bilingues publi\u00e9es par MM. Revillout et Wilcken.\u2014This number gives some interesting reproductions of demotic texts in illustration of some of the above articles.\n\nIndia and countries adjacent.\u00b9\u2014Urdu.\u2014The *Friend of India* states that the Rev. J. D. Bate, M.R.A.S., of the Baptist Mission at Allahabad, is engaged in the preparation of a \"Roman-Hindustani\n\n\u00b9 Communicated by Hon. Secretary to Independent States inclusive.\nDictionary,\" as also of the reverse\u2014an \"English-Hindustani Dictionary\"\u2014works which \"will not be mere compilations from the existing dictionaries.\" The first \"will contain no less than 15,000 words which have never before appeared in any dictionary of the Hindustani language, and which the author has himself collected from the literature and lips of the people, in constant intercourse with them for many years. Special attention is to be given to the technical uses of words appertaining to the professions (such as law, medicine, religion, navigation, agriculture, etc.) and the sciences (such as astronomy, grammar, geography, etc.). The innumerable crotchety idioms of poetry, prose, and the living dialects, as also the important question of the government of verbs and particles, will be carefully noted, and every word will be traced back to its original root. The words will be arranged in the order of the English alphabet, the letters of the Arabic and Nagari alphabets being given in their respective orders at the beginning of the work. Every word will be printed in the native characters also, in each entry, the Persian words in the Arabic character, and the Hindi words in the Nagari. In whatever character a book may be written, the student will find the word in that character in the dictionary, but in the order of the English alphabet. It will be a Dictionary of Urdu and Hindi combined, the need for separate dictionaries of these two languages being, by the plan of the work, removed at a stroke. There is no idea of depriving either Hindus or Mahomedans of the characters of their respective tongues, but of adapting the dictionary to the long-felt need of those students of Oriental literature who are more familiar with the order of the English alphabet than with that of the Indian alphabets, and of dispensing with the necessity of purchasing two or more expensive dictionaries instead of one. The work will thus be specially adapted to the requirements of European students, and of Indians who read English. It will be a dictionary of both classical and colloquial speech, and will meet the requirements of the scholar as well as of the beginner.\" The Friend expresses its belief, in conclusion, that such a work will \"be highly prized and warmly welcomed by native students and by all men newly coming to India,\u2014missionaries, merchants, magistrates, and men of business generally.\"\n\nProvince of Bengal.\u2014The Rev. E. Droese, a missionary, has published a translation of the Book of Common Prayer into the language of the Hill Tribes of Bhagalp\u00far, known as the Pah\u00e1ri or Maler. He has also translated a Gospel and some educational books, and published them. The language belongs to the Dravidian Family, though spoken by a tribe not far from the Ganges.\n\nProvince of Assam.\u2014The Rev. S. Endle, a missionary, has published at Shillong an excellent Grammar of the Kach\u00e1ri Bara language as spoken in the district Darrang, Assam, with a Vocabulary and Texts, and an important Preface. This language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman Group.\nMr. J. F. Needham, Assistant Political Officer, Sadiya, has published an excellent Grammar of the Shaiyang Miri Language, as spoken by the clan of the tribe of Miri who dwell near Sadiya, with Vocabulary and Texts. This book is of the highest value. This language is also of the Tibeto-Burman Group.\n\nMr. C. A. Soppitt has published a Grammar, Vocabulary, and Texts of the Kachch\u00e1r Naga tribes. This language is also of the Tibeto-Burman Group.\n\nProfessor Avery has published in the Journal of the American Oriental Society papers on the Garo and Ao Naga Language, both of the Tibeto-Burman Group.\n\nWe hear of Grammars published of the Singhpo or Kakhyen Language by Major MacGregor, of Abor by Mr. Needham, of the Angami Naga by Mr. McCabe, and of Grammars proposed to be published by Mr. Soppitt of Kuki, by Mr. Stack of Bhutu-Changho, and a projected Vocabulary by Mr. Stack of Tipura. All these languages belong to the Tibeto-Burman Group, and these linguistic works are a positive addition to our existing knowledge. We only regret that the Government of Assam, or the Bengal Asiatic Society, do not supply the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society with copies, and send over additional copies to be supplied to the Libraries of Europe. We commend to the authors the famous line:\n\n\"Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter.\"\n\nIndependent States.\u2014Professor Avery has published in the pages of the American Oriental Society a paper on the Language of Lepcha, the vernacular of the Independent State of Sikkim in the Himalaya. This also belongs to the Tibeto-Burman Group.\n\nCalcutta Review.\u2014Among thirteen papers contributed to the January number, three by natives of India may be selected for special mention. \"The Growth of Radicalism in India and its danger,\" does credit to the writer Rajah Oday Pertap Singh, a Talukdar of Oudh, in that it is a lucid expression of opinion, and the argument of one who, however conservative, is ready to examine the character of innovations. It is a kind of apology for those of his class who do not send their children and relatives, so generally as might have been expected, to the Canning College. \"Buddha as a Philosopher,\" by Ram Chandra Bose, is also a remarkable paper, illustrative of the tendency of the native mind to reason on the higher question of religion in the latitudinarian spirit of Western criticism. The third article is more practical and less speculative than the other two, and deals largely with statistics. The three together are marvellous indications of the advance of education in India during the last thirty years. It is doubtful whether before the Mutinies a native could have written any one of them. Now, it may reasonably be inferred, that one or all might be written by intelligent natives in either Presidency. The remaining articles are \"A Guro's Revenge,\" and \"Our Station,\" by Esm\u00e9; \"The Massacre of Patna\" (continued from a previous number), by Mr.\nBeveridge; \"Imperial Federation,\" by Mr. Braddon, M.P., written apparently in Tasmania; a criticism of the \"Bengal European School Code,\" by Mr. Gasper; \"Yunan,\" by Major E. C. Browne; \"The Covenanted Civil Service and Financial Reform in Bengal,\" by Mr. C. J. O'Donnell; \"Obsolete Crime in Bengal, and its Modern Aspects,\" by Mr. T. Durant Beighton; a few lines on \"Frederick Archer,\" in Memoriam, by an old Turfite; \"The Birds,\" by J. J. W.; besides the Editorial Summaries and Critical Notices. In the last it will suffice to refer to the publications under the head of \"Vernacular Literature.\" Of these, a book entitled \"Sabitri,\" published by the Secretary of the Sabitri Library, Calcutta, is said to contain a collection of papers read at that Institution, and prize essays of a Bengali Lady; \"Baukim Chandra\"\u2014whether in this case a biography, or a work by the bearer of that name, is not clear\u2014is referred to as the \"first Bengali author of the day,\" but the praise bestowed on him by his biographer or reviewer is of that unqualified character that causes the reader to hesitate in accepting the judgment recorded. Dewan \"Ganga Gobinda Sinha: A Historical Novel,\" by Chandi Charan Sen, is designated a work in which \"there is little to admire and a great deal to condemn;\" Lalkuthi, by Radanath Mitra, if correctly described by the critic, must be a mistake; and Resam-tattwa, part i., is a work on the silk industry of Bengal, which seems to call for attention, not only as an innovation in native literature, but as a sensible step in a right direction.\n\nIndian Notes and Queries for November and December are full of good and interesting matter, and keep up that high reputation so creditable to their industrious editor and his competent staff of assistants. Want of space prevents a more detailed notice.\n\nThe Academy (15th January) states that the forthcoming joint work by Sir Richard Temple and his son will contain journals kept by Sir Richard in Haidarabad, Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim, with elaborate introductions by Capt. Temple. There will be illustrations and numerous maps. Messrs. Allen and Co. are the publishers, and it is expected that they will be ready with the book in two months.\n\nCapt. Trotter's India under Victoria meets with a generally favourable notice from a practised hand in the Academy of the 22nd January.\n\nThe Rise of the British Power in the East, by the late Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone, edited by Sir Edward Colebrooke, has just been published by Murray. It is a continuation of the well-known \"History of India in the Hind\u00fa and Mahomedan Periods,\" supplemented by a chapter of the editor's own writing, bringing to a close the otherwise unfinished narrative of the struggle between the English and French. Sir Edward Colebrooke has also attached to the penultimate chapter a detailed note on \"the grant of the Diw\u00e1ni,\" showing \"some of the difficulties that beset the path of British administrators in applying European principles\nand European agency to the Government of the first great province that came under British rule.\"\n\nParts i. to xi. of the Journal of Indian Art, published by Mr. Quaritch, under the authority of the Government of India, are noticed among illustrated publications in the Athen\u00e6um of Dec. 4th.\n\nEcole Sp\u00e9ciales des Langues Orientales Vivantes.\u2014The success attending a volume of M\u00e9langes Orientaux, published by the Professors of this Institution for presentation to the Members of the Leyden Congress in 1883, has induced the same Professors to offer to the Vienna Congress, held during the past year, a similar volume, under the title of Nouveaux m\u00e9langes Orientaux. Its contents may be briefly recorded:\u20141. The Persian text, and M. Schefer's translation, of Muhammad Ibn 'Ali Ravendi's sketch of the reign of Muizzu'd-din Abu'l Harith, Sultan Sanj\u00e1r. 2. M. Barbier de Meynard's \"Consid\u00e9rations sur l'Histoire Ottomane,\" with extracts from the original Turkish \"T\u00e1rikhi Djevdet.\" 3. Professor Houdas on \"L'\u00e9criture Maghrebine,\" with specimens. 4. Fragment of the Arabic Kharidatu 'l Ka\u1e63r, by 'Im\u0101d ad-d\u012bn al-K\u0101tib, on Ous\u0101ma ibn Mounk\u012bdh, a Syrian Am\u012br of the early Crusades, with introduction by Professor Derenbourg. 5. The Abb\u00e9 Favre's translation of a \"texte Malais\" relating to Moses in the Mount. 6. Summary and part translation of the \"Vogages de Basile Vatace,\" born at the close of the seventeenth century, with original Greek text, and an introduction by M. \u00c9mile Legrand. 7. M. Dozon's translation of \"Les Noces de Maxime Tz\u00e9roni\u00e9vitch,\" a popular Servian poem. 8. Professor Abel des Michels' version of some Annamite tales, to which is added an explanation of a verse in the Chinese \"Y\u01d4 Ki\u00e0ou Li.\" M. Henri Cordier's \"Notes pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire des \u00e9tudes Chinoises en Europe,\" bringing the reader up to the days of the elder Fournont. 10. Professor Vinson's \"Specimen of Tamul Pal\u00e6ography.\" 11. Professor Carri\u00e8re's Armenian Version of the Story of Ass\u00e9nath\u2014otherwise Asenuth, daughter of Potipherah, and wife of Joseph. 12. M. \u00c9mile Picot's \"Notice Biographique et Bibliographique sur l'Imprimeur Anthime d'Ivir, Metropolitain de Valachie,\" and 13. A paper on Japanese writing, by Professor L\u00e9on de Rosny.\n\nThe ordinary publications of the \"\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale\" are noticed under the heads to which they respectively belong; and it is needless to say how great is, in many cases, their value to students. With regard to the admirable Institution itself, the following account will interest many readers, and is appropriate as illustrating one form of encouragement to Oriental study and research, in connection with the \"Statement\" recently circulated by the Royal Asiatic Society to Schools and City Companies, and published in the present number of the Journal.\n\nNotes\u00b9 on the School of Modern Oriental Languages at Paris:\u2014This excellent school was founded at the end of the last century. In the year 1790 Monsieur Langl\u00e8s, an Orientalist, called the\n\n\u00b9 Kindly contributed by Major C. M. Watson, C.M.G., R.E.\nattention of the French National Assembly to the importance of encouraging the study of the living languages of the East, and to the advantage which would accrue from a more general knowledge of these languages, both in the extension of commerce, and as an aid to French political influence.\n\nNo immediate result followed, but in 1795 the question was referred to a committee, of which Lakanal, a member of the Convention, was the President. He drew up a strong report, pointing out the neglect with which the study of modern Oriental languages had been treated in France. He called attention to the fact that while the ancient languages of the East were the object of much consideration, and ample means were provided for teaching them to students, there were, on the contrary, no arrangements for teaching the modern languages, although the latter were of more use both for commerce and for political purposes. He concluded by proposing that a school should be opened and attached to the National Library.\n\nActing upon this report, the French Government, by decree of the 30th March, 1795, established the School of Modern Oriental Languages, with three professorships, i.e. one of Arabic, one of Turkish and Tartar, and one of Persian and Malay. The salary of each professor was fixed at \u00a3120 per annum, and they were instructed to prepare grammars of the languages in which they were to teach.\n\nThe school was located in the Rue Neuve des Petits Champs near the National Library. The first professors were as follows: Arabic, Silvestre de Sacy; Turkish, Venture de Paradis; Persian, Langl\u00e8s. Of these it is only necessary to say a few words.\n\nLangl\u00e8s, who must be regarded as the originator of the School, had been intended for the career of an officer in the army, but ill health prevented his following so active a life. Wishing to obtain some appointment in the East, he devoted himself to the study of Arabic and Persian, and was, in consequence, appointed one of the guardians of the manuscripts in the National Library during the Reign of Terror. He was appointed first administrator of the School when it was established, as well as Professor of Persian, and held the two appointments for twenty-eight years.\n\nSilvestre de Sacy was already one of the most renowned Orientalists of France when he was called to the post of Arabic Professor at the School, and held the position for forty-two years.\n\nVenture de Paradis was the son of a Consul in the Levant, and had been employed for some years as Interpreter in the Diplomatic Service. He was Dragoman to the French Embassy at Constantinople, when appointed to the post of Turkish Professor in the School of Oriental Languages. He held the latter position for two years only, when he was summoned to act as Chief Interpreter to General Bonaparte on his Egyptian expedition, and took with him as assistants several pupils of the School, which thus already began to give a return to the Government for the money spent upon it.\nVenture accompanied Bonaparte into Syria, and died of dysentery at St.-Jean d\u2019Acre in 1799.\n\nFrom time to time other professorships have been added to the School, according as experience showed the necessity of increasing the number of modern languages taught, and care has been taken to avoid the danger of making the instruction of too learned a character, and to carry out the original intention of the School, namely, to teach the students to read, speak, and write the languages as they exist at the present time.\n\nThe School is under the direction of a President, who is chosen from among the Professors, and is responsible to the Minister of Public Instruction. The President is assisted by a Secretary, who also acts as Librarian.\n\nThere are twelve Professors in the School, who instruct in the following languages: Modern Arabic, Literary Arabic, Persian, Armenian, Turkish, Russian, Modern Greek, Hindustani and Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, Annamite, and Malay and Javanese.\n\nThe Professors now receive a salary of \u00a3300 per annum each. They are bound to give three lectures of one hour\u2019s length weekly, of which one lesson is usually for beginners and the two others for students who are more advanced.\n\nThe lectures are free to the public and are gratuitous, the whole cost of keeping up the School being provided by the State. In addition to attending the lectures of the Professors, students are allowed to study in the reading rooms, where, at certain times, assistant teachers attend to help them in their courses.\n\nFrom time to time additional series of lectures are given by qualified persons on cognate subjects, such as upon the history and political and commercial geography of the countries of which the languages are taught.\n\nThere is an excellent library of more than 20,000 volumes, so the students have the advantage of being able to consult all the best grammars and dictionaries without having to purchase them for themselves.\n\nIn addition to the actual work of instruction in the Oriental languages, the School assists in the publication of new works and of translations.\n\nIt is worthy of note that the lectures and course of study were not suspended during the siege of Paris, in the winter of 1870\u201371.\n\nIn 1873 the School was moved to the building which it now occupies, at the corner of the Rue de Lille and Rue des Saints P\u00e8res. This belongs to the Government, and had formerly been used for the school of naval engineering. It is now being enlarged at the expense of the State, and when the alterations are completed, it will be most commodious.\n\nThe number of students appears to be increasing, and many foreigners come to Paris to attend the courses of lectures.\n\nThere is no doubt that the School is a most excellent institution, well deserving of the money expended upon it, and one that might\nbe imitated with great advantage in England, where the study of modern Oriental languages is at a very low point.\n\nThe following is the expense of the School as laid down in the budget for 1887:\u2014Salaries of 12 professors (11 at \u00a3300 per annum, 1 at \u00a3200 per annum), \u00a33500; Additional for the president, \u00a380; Secretary and librarian, \u00a3120; 7 assistant teachers, \u00a3700; Porter and attendants, \u00a3216; Fees for extra courses of lectures, \u00a3360; Rewards for the students, \u00a3340; Lighting, cleaning, etc., \u00a3313; Purchase of books, printing of new publications, etc., \u00a3516; Total per annum, \u00a36145.\n\nVienna Oriental Journal.\u2014We welcome the appearance of the specimen number of this publication, edited by the Directors of the Oriental Institute of the University of Vienna, G. B\u00fchler, J. Karab\u00e1cek, D. H. M\u00fcller, F. M\u00fcller, and L. Reinisch. It is intended to be a central organ, exclusively devoted to the interest of Oriental studies, partly in the English, partly in the German language; French and Latin papers are also admitted. Papers regarding India will, as far as possible, be given in English. It will appear quarterly, and will comprise reviews of important works as well as original articles. The first number well sustains the promise held out.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014Mr. Theobald, in noticing some of the symbols on the coins of Kunanda (Beng. Asiat. Soc. Journal, No. 3, 1886), questions the correctness of identification as regards the deer, which animal he thinks may not always be intended where commonly supposed. The tail and horn seem rather to designate the yak, though in one case he admits the other conclusion. He further discusses the symbol above the animal\u2019s head, stated to represent snakes, and the object or symbol on the reverse, the import of which the late Mr. Thomas expressed himself unable to conjecture. In the same number of the Journal, Mr. C. Rodgers gives an interesting analysis of thirty coins. Referring to the doubtful interpretation of the first, it may be remarked that the word \u201cAm\u012br\u201d suggested by the late Mr. Gibbs, seems preferable to \u201cHab\u012bb\u201d as regards the context. \u201cLord\u201d is more intelligible than \u201cFriend,\u201d when prefixed to \u201cEast and West\u201d \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628; but an inspection of the coin itself is essential to forming a judgment on the word inscribed. Could it be S\u0101hib (\u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628)?\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014Our Director, Sir Henry Rawlinson, has been elected a Membre Associ\u00e9 \u00c9tranger de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, in place of Madwig. There is a laudatory notice of Mr. Fleet\u2019s forthcoming volume of Gupta Inscriptions in the Academy of 15th January; and it is stated to be now so near completion \u201cthat the page-proofs are ready.\u201d The author\u2019s high reputation will no doubt be enhanced by a publication the value of which is to a great extent already certified, and its appearance will be awaited with more than common interest by students of Indian arch\u00e6ology. We are informed in the same paper that Professor de Goeje of Leiden and Dr. Bretschneider have been elected Foreign Corre-\nsponding Members of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, in the place of Dr. Birch and Mr. Edward Thomas, deceased. \"Twenty-three Inscriptions from Nepal,\" collected at the expense of the Naw\u00e2b of Jun\u00e2gadh, edited by Pandit Bhagv\u00e2nl\u00e2l Indr\u00e2ji, together with \"Some considerations on the Chronology of Nepal,\" translated from Gujar\u00e2ti, by Dr. G. B\u00fchler, form the material of a Bombay reprint from the Indian Antiquary. There has also been a reprint at Bangalore of twenty-three \"Coorg Inscriptions,\" translated for Government by Mr. Lewis Rice, Secretary to the Government of Mysore. The dates of these extend over a period of nearly fourteen hundred years, or from A.D. 466 to A.D. 1842.\n\nAfrica (Communicated by the Hon. Secretary).\u2014Dr. Sima, of the Baptist Mission on the Kongo, has published a Vocabulary of the Teke Language spoken at Stanley Pool, and another Vocabulary of the Bangi alias Yansi Language, spoken in the Upper Kongo about the Equator. Both these belong to the Bantu or South African Family. The Rev. Wm. Crisp has published a Grammatical Notice of the Chu\u00e1na Language spoken in South Africa (Central): this also belongs to the Bantu Family. The Rev. Mr. Bentley, of the Baptist Mission on the Kongo, has published a complete Dictionary of the Kongo Language, with an elaborate introduction. This is a most important work. The language is Bantu. The Rev. Mr. Brincker, of the Rhenish Mission, has published in the German language a complete Dictionary, and Grammar and Texts of the Herer\u00f4 language in South Africa on the West side. This language belongs to the Bantu Family. The Rev. Mr. O'Flaherty (deceased), of the Church Missionary Society in Equatorial Africa, prepared during his six years' residence at Rub\u00e2ga, the capital of U-Ganda, grammars, vocabularies, texts, translations of the Scriptures in Ganda. He was on his road home to publish these important works when he died in the Red Sea. This may delay their publication, but they will be utilized when a competent editor is found. This language belongs to the Bantu family, and is spoken on the Equator. Senhor Joaquim d'Almeida da Cunha, Secretary of the Governor-General of the Portuguese Colonies in East Africa, has published the first part of his Studies of the Languages spoken within the Portuguese territory. It is in the Portuguese language, and is valuable as an independent inquiry. He gives a general view of all the languages, and a Vocabulary of the languages spoken by the tribes of Ma-Konde and Ma-Via, on the river Rovuma in West Africa South of the Equator. It belongs to the Bantu Family.\n\nVI. Special Committee, Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n(See President's Address, page v, Proceedings of Anniversary Meeting, in Journal for July, 1886.)\n\nIn connection with inquiries as to the best means for the promotion of Oriental Studies in England, the Council of the Roya\nAsiatic Society have had prepared by the Committee above indicated, and from the best information at their command, lists of appointments in England and India for which a scholarly acquaintance with Oriental Languages is a necessary or important qualification.\n\nAs the information thus collected appears to show that the prospect of remunerative employment open to English Orientalists is less discouraging than is usually supposed, the Council think that the publication of the lists may do something towards stimulating Oriental studies in this country. The lists are accordingly published below, and it is further proposed to notify from time to time in the Journal all new appointments of like character created, and all vacancies and changes of incumbency in existing appointments.\n\nIt will be seen from these lists that, excluding those for which a knowledge of Hebrew only is required, the number of permanent salaried appointments in the United Kingdom is about twenty-nine, the salaries ranging from \u00a350 to \u00a31000 per annum. In India there are ninety-eight Government appointments open to Europeans, with salaries ranging from 250 to 2450 rupees per mensem, for which a knowledge of Oriental languages and literature is either essential or a very important qualification. These appointments include 14 Professorships of Oriental Languages, 45 Headships of Colleges and Schools, 32 Educational Inspectorships, and 7 Directorships of Public Instruction, and all\u2014with the exception of 8 Professorships and 2 Inspectorships\u2014are at present held by Europeans.\n\nBesides the appointments referred to above, there are, in the United Kingdom, Professorships at King's and University College, London, minor College Tutorships at Oxford and Cambridge, Examinerships in connection with Indian Civil Service competitions, and temporary appointments in the British Museum, offering more or less remunerative employment to Orientalists. Again, in India, the Government offers to its Civil and Military servants handsome rewards for proficiency in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, and the languages of India, and success in the examinations for them not unfrequently leads to special advancement in the Service. Lastly, both in England and India, important work is being done, and much more remains to be done, in the editing and translation of Oriental texts, and in the preparation of dictionaries and grammars and other works relating to the history, antiquities, and languages of the East, while, judging from the periodical lists of Messrs. Triibner and other Oriental publishers, the public interest in this class of literature is on the increase:\u2014\nSTATEMENT.\n\nRoyal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland,\n31st January, 1887.\n\nThe Council and Members of the Royal Asiatic Society, in common with every Oriental scholar throughout the kingdom, have long been painfully conscious of the general neglect in this country of Eastern learning. There is no nation to which an acquaintance with Eastern languages, religions, and laws, and with the history and character of Eastern races, is so important. And yet we are almost daily brought face to face with the strange fact,\u2014that perhaps in no great European country is the cultivation of these sciences more backward than in this.\n\nIt may be possible, with more or less plausibility, to attribute that condition of things to a variety of causes, but it seems needless to seek for others, when, at the very threshold of the question, we are confronted with the fact, that in other countries inducements and material assistance are offered by their Governments, Universities, and other Public Institutions, for the promotion of Eastern learning in all its branches, to which nothing of a similar nature in the United Kingdom can be fitly compared. The results are notorious to all who have ever interested themselves in the question. We cannot claim to occupy, even in the study of the Indian languages, and least of all in their scientific study, the foremost place that would naturally be expected of this country. And in departments of Oriental learning, of almost equal importance to us from a national point of view, the effect of a comparison between the results achieved abroad and those accomplished in England is to exhibit us in a light totally unworthy of a great and wealthy civilized nation. Under Government patronage and with its substantial help carefully collated texts and translations of important works by the great Arab historians issue uninterruptedly from the Continental presses. Archaeological and other publications, casting valuable light upon early history and civilization, and upon their expansion from their primeval centres in Egypt\nAssyria or Babylonia, are successively brought forth. Works, in short, upon all the leading subjects of Eastern research are produced, and are produced in sumptuous form, which for generations to come will do honour to the nations to whom the world is indebted for their publication. The record for corresponding work in England must be described, to say the least, as far from creditable. In those cases where important work may have been achieved at the cost of years of labour, the author can rarely depend\u2014unless, indeed, the work has some claim on the consideration of the Government of India\u2014for the purpose of placing the results of his labours before the world, upon anything but the private means which he may or may not be fortunate enough to possess; and instances are not wanting where such work has remained in manuscript for years, simply because the author could not meet the cost of publication. Even in the case of Indian studies we may hear of a publisher being able to undertake the publication of an important Pali text, thanks only to a small allowance from the India Office having been supplemented by a subvention of \u00a350 per volume, granted to him by the Academy of Berlin; whilst the discontinuance of the Sanskrit Text Society, after vain efforts on the part of Professor Eggeling of Edinburgh to prolong its existence, is equally significant. Even while this subject has been under consideration by the Society, it has been announced in the Press that a Bill was to be brought before the German Reichstag providing for the establishment of a school of Oriental languages in connection with the University of Berlin, with six professorial chairs attached.\n\nBut these particular features of the question, however important, are not those to which it is alone or even chiefly desired to direct attention. Our great and first want arises from a deficiency of men possessing the means, in addition to the ability and desire, to enter into and to persevere in a course of Eastern study. The loss thereby incurred from a national point of view can hardly be exaggerated. A considerably larger Mohammadan population, for example, is governed by this country than is subject to any other rule, yet it is almost literally true that nowhere is less encouragement and assistance offered to the student of Mohammadan languages than in this. An analogous case is that of the languages and people of the Chinese Empire, in which our interests are already so great, and in which they promise soon to become of such vast importance.\nThe facts of the case are known and deplored by every person interested in the question, but all are disheartened by the failure of every attempt hitherto made to bring about an adequate amendment. The late Dr. Pusoy, Prof. Max M\u00fcller, Prof. Sayce, and other eminent representatives of Oriental studies at the University of Oxford, exerted themselves some years ago to press upon the commission appointed to amend and reform the existing institutions of the University the application of a portion of the endowments of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge to the interests of Oriental research. The Council of the Royal Asiatic Society took part in signing a Memorial to the Commissioners, asking them to endow and encourage certain branches of Oriental learning, which, though recognized in Continental and American Universities, receive little or no support from their English sisters. The Committee of the Hebdomadal Council, among other recommendations, urged the appointment of Professors for the study and teaching of the languages and antiquities of Assyria and Egypt. Neither that nor similar representations pressed upon the Commissioners were attended with any result.\n\nIt is true that means of study are not altogether absent at the Universities. Chairs have been established and Oriental teachers appointed. The Boden and one or two other Scholarships have been moreover founded or set apart for Oriental learning at Oxford and at Cambridge. We owe to the untiring exertions and perseverance of Sir Monier Williams the foundation at Oxford of the Indian Institute, and its acquisition from the University chest of a small endowment, which, however inadequate, forms at least a happy precedent in the interest of Eastern learning. In Edinburgh, in like manner, we are indebted to the late Dr. Muir for the foundation and endowment of a Sanskrit chair. And it has to be thankfully acknowledged that the University of Cambridge, and more recently Oxford, have admitted Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic, and that of London Sanskrit and Arabic, as subjects in their examinations for degrees; while something has been done, especially by Oxford, in the publication and translation of Oriental texts. But there is little, if anything, more to add, when speaking of our Universities.\n\nAs regards Government assistance or encouragement, so far as the Imperial Government is concerned, they are almost non-existent. It is not requisite to discuss the merits or demerits of our national policy in this particular matter, still less to mention it as a subject\nfor reproach, but the result is a state of things hardly creditable to a nation ruling a great and powerful Eastern Empire.\n\nThe Government of India, indeed, has liberally assisted in the publication of Oriental works, but its assistance is mainly confined\u2014and rightly so\u2014to works more or less directly connected with the languages and literature of India. That Government also offers liberal rewards to its servants, civil and military, for proficiency in Indian languages; but, owing perhaps to the engrossing requirements of the service, the result, so far as scholarship is concerned, is small. Moreover, the present object is not the development of scholarship in the servants of the Indian Government, but the establishment of a comprehensive school of Oriental learning in this country.\n\nTo some of the circumstances that have been touched upon may, perhaps, be attributed a prevalent belief among the public that a knowledge of Oriental languages is of no practical value\u2014that it offers little or no career worth speaking of. This, it must be said, is, even under present circumstances, less true than is usually supposed. We find, on the contrary, as may be gathered from the accompanying abstract, that, chiefly through the mere force of circumstances, a moderate number of appointments exists in England, and a larger number in India, for which a scholarlike acquaintance with Eastern languages is an indispensable or important qualification. And it cannot be doubted that, under a better condition of things, not only would research in all departments of Eastern science be stimulated, but fresh careers of increasing importance would unfold themselves, and would present additional objects of legitimate ambition to students. It is not probable that it would, for instance, still be said of a chair in one of our leading Universities, that \"its emoluments are about equal to those of a Classical Mastership in any good Grammar School.\" The field of Oriental research is a vast one, and full of attractive interest, and an increase in the number of its labourers would demonstrate more and more the practical as well as the scientific value of its fruits. The supply of Eastern scholarship, its public appreciation, and a demand for it, could not fail to act and to re-act upon one another. It is a significant fact, and one far from creditable to us, that at present the supply of properly-qualified Englishmen is not sufficient, and that in order to fill some of the most important of the existing appointments we are obliged to have recourse to scholars trained in foreign seats of learning.\nThe crying want is that of encouragement and assistance to young men, willing, perhaps keenly desirous, to labour in a great and worthy field. But as regards encouragement, the belief is too prevalent, and, it must be said, too well-founded, that the study of Oriental languages affords little opening for school and academic distinction. In the case of our Universities something has been done, especially of late years, to remove this reproach, but in the case of schools encouragement is almost non-existent. Yet how much may be done by even slight means is well exemplified in the case of Merchant Taylors' School, where the grant by the late Sir Moses Montefiore of a silver medal for the study of Hebrew has had the effect of creating a class, from which more than one distinguished Hebrew scholar is able to trace the commencement of his career. At the City of London School, also, a prize of \u00a35 and an exhibition, the gift of Sir Albert Sassoon, have been regularly awarded for several years past for the encouragement of the study of Sanskrit, with excellent results. These examples, it must, however, be added, are solitary ones in our public schools.\n\nThe main obstacle, however, is the deficiency of material assistance, that is of endowments such as exist for the promotion of other departments of science. From scholars at all our seats of learning, whether in England, in Scotland, or in Ireland, the same complaint is to be heard. It is simply impossible for a young man not possessed of independent means, to devote himself to the subject by which he is, it may be, most attracted. Even before he leaves school, the object of relieving the pressure of expense upon his parents or other friends, the necessity he is under of providing himself with means of independent livelihood in the future, and even of finding the means of living during the laborious years of preparation which the acquisition of the most important Oriental languages requires, must of necessity weigh upon his parents and upon himself with constantly increasing force. In the words of the occupant of one of our Oriental Chairs, the student has it ever before him that a smaller expenditure of intellectual energy will, in numerous other directions, secure to him greater distinction, and at the same time, it may be added, more effectual external assistance towards its attainment.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that in two of the great English Universities, Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian are subjects now admitted in their examinations for degrees, and Sanskrit and Arabic in\n| Teacher | Hindustani | and \u00a3100 from University chest \u00a3200 and fees | Elected | Capt.

Henri Cordier, Professor at the \u00c9cole des Langues Orientales Vivantes and \u00c9cole des Sciences Politiques, Paris.\n\n(Communicated by Professor R. K. Douglas, M.R.A.S.)\n\nIt may be at first a matter of surprise to many that an alien by nationality and religion, a Roman Catholic Frenchman, should come before this learned Society to discourse on the life and labours of a British Protestant Missionary. A few words, however, will show that there are strong reasons for my taking up some of your valuable time with an account of the good work done by our late friend.\n\nIndeed, Wylie's library was the very foundation of my Bibliotheca Sinica.\u00b9 In 1869 I was engaged as Honorary\n\n\u00b9 Bibliotheca Sinica. Dictionnaire bibliographique des ouvrages relatifs \u00e0 l'Empire chinois par Henri Cordier. Paris, \u00c9. Leroux, 1878-1885, 2 vols. imp. 8vo. I wrote in the Preface, June, 1878, p. x: \"Tout le monde en Chine conna\u00eet Mr. Alex. Wylie; le savant et modeste agent de la 'British and Foreign Bible Society' donnait de son cabinet de travail situ\u00e9 \u00e0 la 'London Mission,' Shantung Road, Shanghai, les renseignements les plus utiles \u00e0 ceux qui venaient frapper \u00e0 sa porte. Une portion de sa biblioth\u00e8que avait \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 asiatique, mais la plus pr\u00e9cieuse partie \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9taient venus s'adjointre de nouveaux volumes \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e chez lui. Avec une rare bieuveillance, Mr. Wylie m'avait permis de travailler dans sa biblioth\u00e8que, et j'ai \u00e0 m'accuser d'avoir souvent d\u00e9rang\u00e9 cet excellent homme dans ses propres travaux, en venant\u2014avec une indiscretion qui n'a d'excuse que mon d\u00e9sir de produire un ouvrage s\u00e9rieux\u2014m'installer au milieu de ses livres et de ses manuscrits. C'est l\u00e0 que j'ai pu examiner la copie faite par Stanislas Julien de la Notitia du P. de Pr\u00e9mare, une traduction du Tchoung Young du P. de Ventavon, et mille et une plaquettes uniques ou rarissimes. D'ailleurs, Mr. Wylie est un confr\u00e8re, si un \u00e9l\u00e8ve comme moi peut traiter de confr\u00e8re un ma\u00eetre comme lui; n'a-t-il pas \u00e9crit ces Notes on Chinese Literature qui sont aujourd'hui le guide m\u00e9con de celui qui cherche \u00e0 s'orienter dans le labyrinthe de la litt\u00e9rature de la Chine.\"\nLibrarian to compile the Catalogue of the Library of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at Shanghai, the bulk of which came from Mr. Wylie, when an idea of compiling a list of all the books relating to the Middle Kingdom occurred to me. Having published the catalogue of the Asiatic Society, I have devoted the last eighteen years to this task. I drew much of the necessary materials from the N.C.B.R. Asiatic Society's Library, a great deal more from the new collection made by Wylie during his visit to Europe in 1860. His library was situated on the ground floor at the farthest end of the premises belonging to the London Missionary Society in the Shantung Road, at Shanghai. Four or five large book-cases contained the works comprising his new library. The Chinese books were at the back in a sort of passage. Wylie was exceedingly proud of his Chinese library, rivalled or surpassed in China only by the collection of that very learned sinologist and distinguished diplomatic agent, Sir Thomas Wade, Her Majesty's Minister at Peking. Many an afternoon, winter and summer, did I sit with Wylie at his small round writing table, he doing some useful work for some one who might never think of thanking him for it, I copying titles in view of my Bibliotheca Sinica. Wylie was not one of those savants with a solemn appearance who fill with awe and reverence the poor mortals who are allowed to approach them: he had a kindly appearance, a pleasant smile on his face, a modest countenance, and oftentimes, when engaged in conversation, he would make you believe that he was highly interested in and derived much knowledge from what you told him. Though extremely pious, he did not think that religion should make one gloomy, and he was at that time of a very genial and humorous turn of mind.\n\nWhen the Bibliotheca Sinica was published in parts, it was to Wylie that I owed the first public recognition of my labours in the Chinese Recorder, the China Review, Tr\u00fcbner's Record and the London and China Express. Our friendly relations continued to the end. In fact, I published\nin my own *Revue de l'Extr\u00eame-Orient* what I believe to be the last paper written by him, *The Ethnography of the After Han Dynasty*. I think that under these circumstances I may feel quite justified in bringing here my grateful tribute to the memory of a friend whose science I admire, whose character and life I hold in high esteem.\n\nSome years ago, as I intended giving some notices about celebrated sinologists, Wylie, to whom I applied for particulars of his life, sent me his photograph, adding with characteristic modesty:\u00b9 \"Your notices of sinologues will be interesting, but it will be a long time ere it comes to my turn. I really do not know what notes I could give you about myself that would be of any interest to the public. I am essentially one of *hoi polloi*. My birthday was April 6th, 1815, in London, and I reached China August 26th, 1847. The rest I think you know tolerably well.\"\n\nOf the early life of Alexander Wylie I know but few particulars. Dr. James Legge related in *Tr\u00fcbner's Record* (No. 231, vol. viii. No. 1) lately how he made the acquaintance of Wylie, and under what circumstances the latter proceeded to China: \"Having returned from Hong Kong to England for a time in consequence of illness, I was living in London in 1846. It was there that I first saw Mr. Wylie. He called on me with a letter from a friend, which told me that my visitor was a cabinet-maker, whom he knew well, of great intelligence and other high qualities, who had been occupying himself lately with the study of Chinese. I asked the stranger what had made him take up that language, when he said that having picked up, the winter before, at an old-book stall, a copy of Pr\u00e9mare's *Notitia Linguae Sinicae*, he had learned Latin sufficiently to be able to read it, was much interested with it, and wished to obtain some guidance in prosecuting the study of Chinese. There was a New Testament in Chinese on the table. I opened it, and he read with tolerable accuracy a column or two, and translated them with an approximation to correct-\n\n\u00b9 January 21st, 1882.\nness. His pronunciation was not exact, but he had got hold of the principle of relative position by which the meaning of the symbolic characters in their combination is determined. I asked him where he had got a dictionary, and he said he had not got one. \"How, then, did you learn the names and meanings of those characters?\" \"Partly,\" he said, \"from Pr\u00e9mare, and I have tried to make a list of characters and their signification for myself. I got a New Testament from the Bible Society. Turning to the fourth Gospel, I knew that the first verse must contain the name for 'God' twice, and the character for 'Word' three times. I put these down, and went on to determine others in the same way.\" He had brought with him some tracts which he had got from the Religious Tract Society; trying him with one of these, he was not so successful as with the New Testament, but still did wonderfully. I arranged for him to come to me, and get a lesson occasionally. When he left me, I felt sure that if the way could be opened for him to pursue the study under favourable conditions, he was a man who would greatly distinguish himself in the field of Chinese scholarship. The result of that interview was, that soon afterwards he was studying the work and management of a printing office under the auspices of the late Sir Charles Reed, and in 1847 he proceeded to China to take the superintendence of the printing office of the London Missionary Society at Shanghai, which he conducted efficiently till 1860.\"\n\nAs soon as Wylie arrived in China, he set at work to master the Chinese language. Knowing well the enormous influence the Classics have on the mind of the natives, and how necessary it is for the missionary to penetrate into the inner thought of the individual, he undertook to translate for himself the whole of the King. This wonderful labour he successfully accomplished, and I well remember the six or seven half-bound volumes containing his manuscript on the top shelf of one of his book-cases. However, Wylie considered these translations too imperfect to be printed, so they have remained unpublished; they have fallen into good hands, those of his daughter, with the exception of one in\ncare of Dr. James Legge, who speaks in the following terms of the version of the *Li ki*\u00b9: \u201cThe present translation [Dr. Legge\u2019s] is, as I said above, the first published in any European language of the whole of the *Li Ki*; but another had existed in manuscript for several years,\u2014the work of Mr. Alexander Wylie, now unhappily, by loss of eyesight and otherwise failing health, laid aside from his important Chinese labours. I was fortunate enough to obtain possession of this when I had got to the 35th Book in my own version, and, in carrying the sheets through the press, I have constantly made reference to it. It was written at an early period of Mr. Wylie\u2019s Chinese studies, and is not such as a Sinologist of his attainments and research would have produced later on. Still, I have been glad to have it by me, though I may venture to say that, in construing the paragraphs and translating the characters, I have not been indebted in a single instance to him or P. Callery.\u201d\n\nAfter trying his hand in this severe task, Wylie was ready to give to the public some works bearing his name. Many opportunities were soon offered to him.\n\nWylie was one of the foremost contributors to the *North-China Herald* in the early days of that paper. The *Chinese Repository* had ceased to exist in December, 1851, after the completion of its twentieth volume. During the last seven years of its existence, this celebrated magazine had lost from 300 to 400 dollars annually,\u00b2 and its last editor, Dr. S. Wells Williams, had discontinued its publication, thinking\u2014and in this he was wrong\u2014that the appearance of numerous newspapers rendered useless a periodical of the nature of the *Repository*. The *North-China Herald* had been started in 1850\u00b3 at Shanghai, by Henry Shearman, who continued to edit it to his death in 1856.\u2074 News was then scarce, one monthly line of steamers brought letters and papers from\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Sacred Books of the East, translated by Dr. James Legge.

No. 1, Saturday, 3rd August, 1850.\n\u2074 Henry Shearman died, 53 years old, at Shanghai, on the 22nd March, 1856.\nhome, and China was not yet connected with Europe by a telegraphic wire, so Henry Shearman gave much place in his gazette to scientific papers. Wylie was one of those who took advantage of the new periodical to publish articles which\u2014owing to their lasting value and to their length\u2014would no doubt have suited the defunct Repository better than a weekly chronicle. However, at the end of the year, Shearman used to reprint as an appendix to his Almanac a number of the special articles which had appeared in the Herald, making out of valuable materials lost in the files of the newspaper an interesting Miscellany\u00b9\u2014now very rare\u2014which lived until 1858. Charles Spencer Compton, who took Shearman's place, thought it too much trouble to continue a serial which reflected great credit on its editor, but did not bring him \u00a3 s. d.\n\nTwo of Wylie's papers in the North-China Herald at that time call for some special notice: one is on the celebrated Nestorian stone\u00b2 found in 1625 at Si-ngan fou in the Shensi province, which shows, as everybody knows, that the Christian religion existed in the Chinese Empire as far back as the eighth century, under the rule of the Tang Dynasty. One would have thought that all discussions were at an end after the notes, articles, or books from Fathers Terenz, Trigault, Martini, Semedo, Kircher and Visdelou, from Andreas M\u00fcller, Abel R\u00e9musat, Neumann, Leontiev, E. C. Bridgman.\u00b3 Wylie made the subject quite new, and, in spite of more recent researches made by G. Pauthier, Dabry de Thiersant, and others, his series of papers on the Si-ngan fou tablet cannot be overlooked by all who study the progress of Nestorianism through Asia. As late as the 10th of December, 1879, did Wylie busy himself with this\n\n\u00b9 Shanghai Almanac for 1853, and Miscellany. Printed at the \"Herald\" Office, Shanghai, 8vo. The last number is: Miscellany or Companion to the Shanghai Almanac for 1857. Printed and published at the N.C. Herald Office, Shanghai, 8vo.\n\n\u00b2 The Nestorian Tablet in Se-gan Foo (N.C.

It was deemed of sufficient importance to be translated into German,\\(^4\\) and the learned Secr\u00e9taire perp\u00e9tuel of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, Joseph Bertrand, did not think that two lengthy articles in the *Journal des Savans*\\(^5\\) were unnecessary to bring Wylie\u2019s researches before Western mathematicians. This article seems to have been the starting-point of those mathematical and astronomical studies, which, though little known in Europe, are perhaps the most important of the scientific baggage of Wylie. In 1853 he gave a Compendium of Arithmetic in Chinese, *Soo h\u00eb\u00f6 k\u2019\u00eb mung*, with a table of logarithms as an appendix. Four years later he gave one more paper on the bibliography of mathematical books, and he then boldly undertook to translate some European scientific books into Chinese. At the beginning of the seventeenth century the celebrated Matteo Ricci,\\(^6\\) founder of the Jesuits\u2019 Mission at Peking, owed as much of his success to his scientific books as to his religious works, one of which remains famous to this day in China: The True Doctrine of God, *Tien choo she e*,\\(^7\\) while others like the treatise on Friendship, *Kiao yow-luen*, are not yet forgotten. Ricci had given a general Treatise on Arithmetic, *Tong wen swan che shong pien*, a work on Geometry, *Hucan yong kiao e*, etc., and he had translated the first six books of Euclid\u2019s *Elements*, *Ke ho yu\u00e9n p\u00fcn*, in 1608, with the assistance of his noble convert, Seu Kwang ke, whose life he wrote, *Seu Kwang ke hing lio*.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Nestorians in China (*China Review*, viii. pp. 190\u2013191).\n\\(^2\\) Nestorians at Canton (*China Review*, viii. pp. 31\u201334).\n\\(^3\\) \u201cJottings on the Science of the Chinese\u201d (*North China Herald*, 108, Aug. 21, 1852; 111\u2013113, 116\u2013117, 119\u2013121, Nov. 20, 1852).

At the end of the short English preface Wylie remarks: \"To accompany this issue with an apology would almost seem out of place. Truth is one, and while we seek to promote its advancement in science, we are but preparing the way for its development in that loftier knowledge, which as Christian men and missionaries, it is our chief desire to see consummated.\" Henceforth Li Ma-tow (Ricci, Matteo) and Wei-l\u0113\u00e8 Y\u0101-lih (Wylie) were inseparable, and in 1865 Viceroy Tseng Kwo-fan had both of these works reprinted together at Nanking.\n\nNext follow (Shanghai, 1858) a Popular Treatise on Mechanics, Chung hi\u00f2 ts'\u0113en shuo, from the English, and De Morgan's Treatise on Algebra, Tsa\u00e9 so\u014d h\u0113\u014d (Shanghai, 1859). Always indefatigable, at the same place and in the same year (Shanghai, 1859), he produced translations of Loomis' Elements of Analytical Geometry and of the Differential and Integral Calculus, Ta\u00e9 w\u00e9 tseih shi k\u0113h and Herschell's Outlines of Astronomy, Tan t\u0113en. This last work is illustrated by the original steel engravings used at home. The astronomical phenomena \"cannot fail,\" Wylie observes at the end of the Preface of Herschell's Outlines, \"to awaken in inquisitive minds of a certain order, a desire to become better acquainted with these and kindred facts in nature, which is calculated to exercise a healthful influence on the intellectual character. That such facts may lead to juster and more exalted conceptions of 'Him who hath created these orbs,\u2014who bringeth forth their host by number and calleth them all by their names;\u2014who hath made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by His understanding,' is the sincere desire of the translator.\" We think it interesting to note from this same preface the disbursements for the publication of the last three works in Chinese:\u2014\nThey were covered with contributions from friends of the translator to the extent of Taels 1000.\n\nHe occupied himself with these studies late in life, as he devoted a lengthy and most remarkable article to the *Uranographie Chinoise*\u00b9 by Dr. Schlegel, of Leyden, in the *Chinese Recorder.*\u00b2 The work of Schlegel had been very severely criticized, to my mind unjustly, by M. Joseph Bertrand,\u00b3 and Wylie\u2019s high encomium was exceedingly gratifying to the learned Dutch professor. Wylie gave to the Fifth International Congress held at Berlin a paper on the Mongol Astronomical instruments kept at the Observatory at Peking. All visitors to the Capital of the Middle Kingdom have admired on the wall of the city or in the garden below the magnificent bronze castings which are generally ascribed to the Jesuit missionaries of the eighteenth century, especially to Ferdinand Verbiest, though some of them date as far back as the Yuen dynasty. These Mongol instruments are fully described in the memoir presented to the Berlin Congress (1881).\u2074\n\nWhile prosecuting these scientific works, Wylie was studying the Tartar languages, Manchu being especially useful; it is a language more easily acquired than Chinese, and as most Chinese books of importance have been translated into Manchu, a great saving of time may be effected.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 *Sing chin khao youen.

This was done to a great extent by the missionaries at Peking, and by Leontiev during the K\u00e9en-lung period, as well as by Klaproth at the beginning of this century. Wylie was soon able to give articles on some interesting Mongol and Neuchih inscriptions.\u00b9 To facilitate the study of Manchu, he translated in 1855 a Chinese grammar of this language known as the Ts'ing u'dan k'e m\u00fcng.\u00b2 This work had been already put into Russian by Valdykine in 1804; but Russian being almost as inaccessible as Chinese to most readers, this version remained in manuscript, and I do not think that Wylie even suspected its existence in the catalogue of Klaproth's scattered library.\u00b3 Wylie intended giving a Manchu Chrestomathy, but he did not carry out his idea. This Chrestomathy was to include an English translation by Wylie of the so-called Amiot's Grammaire Tartare-mantchou,\u2074 which was really written in Latin by Gerbillon.\u2075 The English version was printed, I have seen it, and comprised 30 pages 8vo., but was not published. Four years later (1859), Wylie edited at Shanghae the Gospels of Matthew and Mark from the Manchu translation by Lipovzov and the Delegates' version in Chinese with the titles Wo\u00f4 cho\u00f2 y\u00e2y soo ke tuh sin e cha\u00f3u shoo and Musei echen isusgheristas i tutapuha itche ghease.

It includes articles somewhat after the style of magazines, and in it appeared the Popular Treatise of Mechanics alluded to already. This serial was, with the exception of the articles on religion, reprinted by the Japanese during the following year.\n\nAbout this time some spirited gentlemen thinking that tea, silk, and Manchester goods, however important they were from a mercantile point of view, were not sufficient food for the mind, created a literary and scientific association, which soon after became affiliated to this Society under the name of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The inaugural address was delivered on the 16th of October, 1857, by the Rev. Dr. E. C. Bridgman, of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the first editor of the Chinese Repository, President of the Society. Naturally, Wylie was one of the first contributors, and he gave in the Journal of the Society, almost at the outset, a long notice of the coins of the present dynasty, illustrated with 232 cuts. This catalogue of coins has been completed in 1878 by Mr. James Kirkwood in the China Review.\n\nEvery one knows of the scion of the Jewish family which emigrated under the Han dynasty, and finally settled at Kai Fung foo, in the Honan province, where its representatives were discovered by the Jesuits at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Indeed, this group of Israelites do not exist any longer: the Tai-ping rebellion has scattered its few remaining members all over China; in fact, I knew one of the last Jews, who was my tailor at Shanghai twelve years ago. But great interest was taken in them formerly in 1850, the Right Rev.

On his return, Dr. Edkins resumed the work.\n\nBut time had come for Wylie to take a little rest, and he returned home in 1860. He had previously ceded his valuable library, which was to be replaced later on by a still more valuable collection of books, to the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. A preliminary list was prepared,\\(^4\\) and I published some years later a full catalogue with notes.\\(^5\\) A change occurred at this time in Wylie's life.

Asiatic Society*.\n\nBibliographical labours are those by which Wylie is best known in Europe; indeed his *Notes on Chinese Literature* is actually the only guide to the general literature of China. His debut in this field of learning was the now very rare Catalogue of the London Mission Library at Shanghai.\u00b9 It is not a meagre list of Chinese titles arranged in alphabetical order, but a catalogue raisonn\u00e9, with most interesting notices on the works and the authors. It is really a very brilliant prelude (1857) to his greater undertaking. He had given a bibliographical list of works printed in Manchu, in the preface to his translation of the *Ts'ing w\u00e4n ke'mung* (pp. xlix et seq.), and a descriptive catalogue of the languages into which the Bible has been translated in his *Chinese Western Almanac* for 1860. Wylie always refused to recognize as his own the very useful bio-bibliographical book entitled *Memorials of Protestant Missionaries* (1867).\u00b2 He wrote to me once (28th January, 1872): \u201cI was instrumental in furnishing Gamble\u00b3 with nearly all the information in the \u2018Memorials of Protestant Missionaries,\u2019 but never authorized him to put my name to it. I protested against it at the time he issued it, but have repudiated it so often that I now let the thing take its course.\u201d The work, nevertheless, bears fully his mark; it contains the surname and Christian names of every missionary, his native name, and a full list of his publications, whether in Chinese, Malay, or in any other language.\n\nIn 1867 the *Notes on Chinese Literature*\u2074 appeared. Bibliography is not merely a list of works strung together in\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Catalogue of the London Mission Library, Shanghae.

To be a good bibliographer, some general and technical knowledge to classify books, tact to make a discriminate selection of works, exactitude to describe volumes accurately, are required. These qualities are possessed in a high degree by the Chinese, who are first-class bibliographers. Wylie's book is based mainly on the splendid catalogue of the Imperial Library at Peking, compiled during the period K\u00e9en-lung from 1772 to 1790, Kin ting sz\u00e9 k'oo' tse\u00fcen shoo ts\u00fcng m\u00fch, an abridgment of which, containing less than a tenth of the original matter, was published under the title of Kin ting sz\u00e9 k'oo' tse\u00fcen shoo k\u00e9en ming m\u00fch l\u00fch. Wylie followed the Chinese system of classification under four headings, sz\u00e9 koo, I. Classics (Yih-king, Shoo-king, etc.). II. History, S'k\u00e9 (History, Geography, etc.). III. Philosophy, Tsse (including Religion, Arts and Sciences). IV. Belles-lettres, Ts\u00e9i, the largest of the four divisions, including the various classes of polite literature, poetry, and analytical works. Over 2000 works are described with notes by Wylie, and the whole is headed by a preface and introduction, including a list of the translations of Chinese works into European languages. At the end are to be found an appendix, containing a list of general collections of works, Tsung shoo, then an index of the titles of books, and an index of the names of persons to terminate the volume.\n\nThe work carried on by an agent of a Bible Society partakes somewhat of the nature of the labour performed by a peddler: the chief quality of an agent is activity characterized by itinerancy. Wylie never failed to do his duty, and he travelled extensively throughout the Celestial Empire; he has kept the record of one of his longest journeys in the central provinces in the Journal of the N.C.B.R. As. Society.\u00b9\n\nAbout this time Wylie, who was one of the Vice-Presidents of that Society, the late Egyptologist, C. W. Goodwin,\n\n\u00b9 Itinerary of a Journey through the Provinces of Hoo-pih, S'ze-chuen, and Shen-so, by A. Wylie (Journ. N.C.B. Roy. Asiat. Soc. n.s. No. v. December, 1868, Art. VIII. p. 153).\nbeing the President, had the greatest share in editing the Journal. It was during this brilliant period that the Society built rooms for itself, that the library was removed and catalogued, that a museum of natural history was created, and that in the Journal were published the remarkable articles of W. F. Mayers, on the introduction and use of gunpowder among the Chinese,\u00b9 of the Abb\u00e9 Armand David on the Natural History of China,\u00b2 of the Archimandrite Palladius on Marco Polo,\u00b3 of Dr. Emil Bretschneider on the Medi\u00e6val Geography of Central and Western Asia.\u2074\n\nWylie himself gave little to the Journal, being fully occupied elsewhere, and he returned to his old studies with two papers on the eclipses recorded by the Chinese, and the opinions of the Celestials regarding these Phenomena.\u2075 He soon took the editorship of the Chinese Recorder. A periodical devoted to missions had been started in January, 1867, at Foochow, under the name of the Missionary Recorder;\u2076 it soon was changed into the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal,\u2077 with the Rev. S. L. Baldwin and Justus Doolittle as successive editors; but it was short-lived owing to its almost exclusive tendency; two years later\n\n\u00b9 On the Introduction and Use of Gunpowder and Firearms among the Chinese, with notes on some Ancient Engines of Warfare, and Illustrations, by W.

He had much of the spirit which guided the Jesuits at Peking during the last century; he was too liberal-minded to separate science from religion; both could march together to their mutual benefit. At once the Recorder,\\(^1\\) transferred to Shanghai, published papers of the highest order due to Archimandrite Palladius\\(^2\\) and to Dr. Bretschneider;\\(^3\\) room was largely given to history and geography, while the Term question was renovated with new vigour. But it was Wylie's last great effort. Age, fatigue, and more than age or fatigue\u2014his failing eyesight\u2014compelled him to return to Europe in 1877.\n\nWith Palladius' death at Marseilles, just landing from the mail steamer, Bretschneider's return to St. Petersburg, Wylie's demise, historical and geographical studies have suffered irreparable losses in China; in Europe the innumerable correspondents of these scholars knew well their worth. I may be allowed to quote the following lines: \"Not a few of the kind friends and correspondents who lent their aid before have continued it to the present revision. The contributions of Mr. A.

On his way back to England he stayed a few days in Paris. The latter days of his laborious life were spent at 18, Christchurch Road, Hampstead, where he could enjoy pure air and the splendid view of the Heath. His last work was the translation of the Ethnological part of the History of Han, but he would make himself useful to others, and he revised, among other things, the proof-sheets of the book on Chinese Buddhism by his old friend, Dr. Edkins.\n\nBut his eyesight was rapidly failing him. The last autograph letter I received from Wylie in March, 1881, is written by a hand which is no more guided by the eyes; later on his devoted daughter acted as his secretary, and he only signed his name to the letters; towards the end the mind had not survived the eyes, and Wylie had forgotten the world, whilst the world was still expecting some new\n\n---\n\n1 Works of Pauthier (Evening Courier, Shanghai, May, 1873).\n2 Works of Stanislas Julien (Shanghai Budget, April 26, 1873).

Joseph Edkins).\nwork from the veteran sinologist. When this man of good works and deeds breathed his last on the 6th of February, his valiant spirit had long since abandoned his enfeebled body.\n\nLike S. Wells Williams, like many other sinologists whose primary object in life was the propagation of the Gospel in the Celestial Empire, Wylie was a self made man, and proud he might be of it, that self-made man, seeing that he could write his own language in such a simple and cheerful manner, could understand and speak French and German, read Latin and had a knowledge of Russian. He had studied successfully mathematics and astronomy, and mastered so thoroughly the Manchu and Chinese languages, that he leaves translations of Euclid and Herschell and his Notes on Chinese Literature as everlasting monuments of his learning and industry. If I add that Wylie never neglected his duties as a missionary, I think I shall be quite right in saying that he may be set as an example, not only to his fellow-workers in the evangelical field, but also to men of science at large. Alexander Wylie's name ought to be a pride to his profession and to his country. I only hope that full justice will be done to his memory.\nonce occupied the space which has gradually subsided, and the Islands are the summits of the loftiest mountains: 2, that the Eastern portion of the region was colonized from South America: 3, that the whole region was colonized from Asia: 4, that New Zealand was the birthplace of an autochthonous race, which spread over the Eastern Islands, and as far North as the Sandwich Islands. The ingenious Frenchman, who starts this theory within the last five years, has a peculiar contempt for those, who still, even in a faint-hearted way, adhere to the generally received notion of a common origin of the human race. As a fact, within the region there are three distinctly-marked separate races, the brown race, which occupies the Eastern Islands, the black curly-haired race, which occupies the Central Islands, including New Guinea, and the black straight-haired race, which is found surviving in Australia: so none of the last three theories cover the whole ground; and as to the \"Sunken Continent\" theory, it is merely pushing the problem back to a remoter period, for, when we have grasped the idea of a Continent, we have still the question of the origin of the races before us.\n\nEverything in this region is thorny and controversial: no one can agree as to the nomenclature. No doubt the names of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America are illogical and insufficient, but somehow or other they have obtained, and no author thinks of altering them; but as regards this fifth region every writer tries his hand at a new and often a phantastical nomenclature. I follow the Geographical order and method, and divide the region into four sub-regions, using Geographical Names:\n\nI. Polynesia.\nII. Melanesia.\nIII. Mikronesia.\nIV. Australia.\n\nI am glad to find that Keith Johnston's Colonial Atlas of 1886 has adopted these terms, and they are obviously more convenient than such mystic symbols as Mahori, Sub-\nPapuan, Sa-wai-Ori, Tara-Pon. Imagine the inhabitants of the British Isles being called by a name composed of a syllable of each of the names of the three kingdoms\u2014e.g., \"Scot-Ire-Eng,\" and yet this kind of name is suggested in the last two terms above mentioned, as a proper appellation for South Sea Islanders.\n\nLet us describe each Sub-Region separately. Polynesia extends from Easter Island on the East, not so very far from South America, to Tonga on the West, and from the Sandwich Islands on the North to New Zealand on the South. It is an established fact, that the inhabitants belong to one race, brown in colour, straight-haired, magnificent in stature, gentle and hospitable, excellent navigators, and not without certain arts and culture. Their languages belong to the same Family. Perhaps the degree of affinity and mutual intelligibility has been exaggerated, and many are the stories that are told of the languages of one Group of islands being understood in another. I could meet them with anecdotes stating just the contrary. We have the great fact, that the Missionaries belonging to the Protestant Societies have prepared translations of the Scriptures in eight distinct languages of this Family, all published by the British or American Bible Societies, who would certainly not have incurred the expense, if one or two translations were sufficient. No doubt a very superior linguist might be able to understand and make himself understood, to a limited extent, by the speakers of another Language; but it is clear that the Languages are as distinct as Italian from Spanish, or Hindust\u00e1ni from Mar\u00e1thi.\n\nThe chief Languages of the family are as follows:\n\nI. The Society or Georgian Group speak Tahiti.\nII. The Cook or Harvey's Group speak Rarotonga.\nIII. The Marquesas Group speak Marquesas.\nIV. The Sandwich Group speak Hawaii.\nV. Savage Island speak Nieu\u00e9.\nVI. The Navigators' Group speak Samoa.\nVII. The Friendly Group speak Tonga.\nVIII. The New Zealand Group speak Maori.\nBut within the Region are no less than nine smaller Groups, of which the Languages are represented, and which may, upon more complete knowledge, resolve themselves into Dialects of the above-mentioned chief Languages, and they possess a certain amount of literature. More than this, beyond the Geographical Region of Polynesia, and within that of Melanesia, we find colonies of Polynesians established, sometimes independent, sometimes crossed with the Melanesian Races, but conserving in more or less purity their ancient Language. In the cases of the Islands of Aniwa and Futuna portions of the Scriptures have been translated. Canoes laden with members of both sexes have been picked up by European vessels at immense distances from the Island to which they belonged. A sudden storm, or tribal quarrel, has driven Polynesians westward, sometimes to maintain an independent settlement. Sometimes no doubt the males were overpowered and killed, and their women appropriated by the black Islanders, leading to a fusion of race and language.\n\nWhitmee, who has had long personal acquaintance with this Family of Languages, as a written and oral medium of communication, has recorded the following characteristics:\n\nThe Adjective follows the Substantive. The Number is indicated by a change in the Article. The Possessive Pronoun precedes the Noun. The Nominative follows the Verb. Time is indicated by a preceding Particle, and there is no Grammatical Gender. The Passive is formed by a Suffix. Intensity and Continuity of action is indicated by a Prefix and Reduplication. Causation is effected by a Prefix. Reciprocity of action is indicated by a Prefix and Suffix, and often by a reduplication of the word as well. Words always end with a vowel.\n\nThe Language is spoken with Grammatical accuracy: the word-store is sufficient for the expression of every idea. There is generally a ceremonial Language for Chiefs: the component parts of a Chief's name are disused for his life, and sometimes after his death.\ntection of Great Britain and the United States; the influence of the Region will pass gradually under some European control, with the probable consequence of the entire extinction of the pure Native population.\n\nTo the West of Polynesia lies the Region of Melanesia. From Fiji on the extreme East extends a necklace of Islands in a semicircular sweep to New Guinea, the whole of which, with its adjacent Islands, is included. The Region is populous, but the Groups of Islands are well demarcated, so that we can proceed with absolute Geographical certainty, though with some degree of accuracy with regard to Language. The inhabitants apparently belong to one race, brown in colour, woolly-haired, small in stature, fierce and inhospitable, unskilled in Navigation, and in a low type of culture. Each Island has its own language, and in some Islands there are several languages totally distinct. Perhaps this statement is exaggerated, and as the languages are better known, more will be discovered, and the differences be found to be merely dialectal. Translations have been published by the English and Dutch Bible Societies in nineteen languages, and Bible texts are available in many more as well as Grammars, Grammatical Notes, Dictionaries and Vocabularies. As regards New Guinea and New Caledonia, and some of the larger Islands, we have no certainty, that we have not yet at finality as to the number and variety of forms of Language.\nTHE MODERN LANGUAGES OF OCEANIA.\n\nSubdivision I.\n\nI.

Scientific travellers have also contributed their share.\n\nWhitmee has thus recorded the characteristics of this Group of Languages, for it cannot be safely asserted, that they are a Family: they are very distinct from each other, and it is difficult to account for the number of isolated Languages. Still upon certain particulars there is a general agreement, at least they are more like each other than they are to any other Group or Family of Languages. They use consonants much more freely than the Polynesian; they have some consonantal sounds not found in the latter, which are difficult to transliterate. Many syllables are closed. There is no difference between the definite and indefinite article except in Fiji. Nouns are divided into two classes, with or without a pronominal Suffix, and the principle of division is the nearer or more remote connection between the possessor and possessed, e.g. the parts of a man's body\nwould take the Suffix, but not an article possessed for use. Gender is only sexual. Many words indiscriminately represent Noun, Adjective, or Verb without change; sometimes a Noun is indicated by its termination. In some of the Languages the plural is indicated by a Prefix without any other change. Case is indicated by Particles prefixed. Adjectives follow Substantives. Pronouns are numerous, and the Personal Pronouns have four numbers, Singular, Dual, Trinal, and Plural, also inclusive and exclusive. Almost any word may be used as a Verb by adding a verbal Particle. The common characteristic of all is to mark Tense and Mood, and in some languages Person and Number, by Particles prefixed. These Particles vary in the different languages; they have a Causative, Intensive, Frequentative, and Reciprocal Form.\n\nWe hear of no legends; the people are cruel Cannibals, treacherous and revengeful, but they have been cruelly used by Europeans: whole islands depopulated by the labor vessels, and the natives deported to Queensland or Fiji, some never to return, and those who did return by means improved. The Fiji Group has been occupied by Great Britain, the Loyalty Islands and New Caledonia by France. The New Hebrides are a bone of contention between Great Britain and France. Banks' Islands, the Torres, Cruz, and Swallow Groups are awaiting annexation. The southern portion of the Solomon Group is by treaty with Germany left within the sphere of British influence. The Northern portion, as well as the Bismark Archipelago, and a portion of the North Coast of New Guinea, have passed under Germany. The Southern portion of New Guinea, the Islands of Torres Straits, and the Louisiade Archipelago, have passed into the sphere of influence of Great Britain. Beyond the parallel of 141\u00b0 E. Longitude, New Guinea and its adjacent islands are under the protection of Holland. But regards these Islands it will only be over the land, that European Kingdoms will have sway, for the population rapidly disappearing all over Polynesia and Melanesia. Neither the brown race, nor the black race, have the viv\nrousness and lasting powers of the African Negro, and the man-stealing, intoxicating liquors, contagious disorders, and the adoption of European dress and customs, have led to their wasting away, and the Languages will expire with the people. It is a bitter satire on the so-called advantages of European civilization. Fifty thousand died of the measles in Fiji to celebrate the British annexation.\n\nThe Region of Mikronesia extends over a large area from 130\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 East Longitude and 20\u00b0 North Latitude to the Equator, but it embraces very small and unimportant Groups of Islands. Singularly enough they are exceedingly populous, and have escaped up to this time the curses of civilization, but their evil day is at hand, for it is stated in the American Mission Reports that, when a Native Pastor dissuaded his flock from frequenting the Liquor Shops, the newly-established German Authorities fined him 500 dollars for his interference with their profits. The people are gentle and sociable, and the American Missions have worked among them with success: portions of the Scriptures have been translated into five languages, and nearly all we know of them is derived from that source. The Sub-Region embraces the Groups of the Carolines, Ladrones, Marshall, and Gilbert or Kingsmill, and some few scattered Islands, and only fourteen Languages are brought to book.\n\nWhitmee thus describes their characteristics. Their sounds are the same, or nearly so, as the Polynesian; closed syllables are common, occasionally double consonants are used with a slight breathing between them; the accent generally falls on the Penultimate. In some of the Languages there is no Article, and, when it exists, it is placed after the Noun. Gender is sexual only. The Number is left to be inferred from the context, or expressed by a pronominal word or a Numeral. Case is marked by position, or a post-position. In Ebon one class of Nouns takes a pronominal Suffix, which gives the appearance of inflection. This class has the sense of close relationship. Words can be used as Nouns, Adjectives, or Verbs without change of form. In some Languages the personal pronoun can be singular, dual,\nor plural. In others there are special dual forms. In the Ebon there are special inclusive and exclusive forms of the Personal Pronoun. Verbs have no inflections to express Mood, Voice, or Tense, but use Particles. In Ebon, however, the tenses are distinctly marked. There are Causative, Intensative, and Reciprocal forms of the Verb. Words of ceremony are used in some of the Languages, and there are special words for religious functions. The syllables, which occur in the names of chiefs, are disused.\n\nSpain and Germany divide the Group betwixt them, but all the modern culture of the natives is derived from the American Missionaries, whose head-quarters are in the Sandwich Islands.\n\nThe Region of Australia presents phenomena totally different from those hitherto described. Of its two Sub-Regions the people of Tasmania have totally disappeared, the last representative of the race, a woman, having died in 1876, and with her perished any linguistic interest in that Island, and no text has survived to show what the Language was. In the other Sub-Region the same causes are in operation, and will probably lead to the same result. European civilization will have its way either in the destruction of the race, or the treading out of the Language. It is supposed, that at least 60,000 Australians still survive, which exceeds the population of Polynesia, but the environment is difficult. In New Guinea our knowledge is incomplete, because the country has not been explored, but the whole of Australia has been explored, and occupied by British, and the Natives pushed aside. As far as I can ascertain, such Missions do exist make English the vehicle of instruction: this policy can have but one result. One translation of a portion of the Scriptures has been made, but the Edition is exhausted, and no second Edition called for. A long list of no less than eighty-two varieties of tribes and Languages is given in the usual Books of reference, and in a general way marked off into Regions; but the Natives in Colonial estimation so entirely go for nothing (the Shepherd certainly less valuable than the sheep) that the idea of preparing a Language-map of Australia,\nor any of the Australian Colonies, has never been entertained.\n\nSome Grammars and Vocabularies have been compiled, and in general books of Philology an analysis of these passes muster for a representation of Australian languages; but I cannot realize the problem in Australia even as clearly, or as hopefully, as I do in New Guinea. It is generally asserted, that all Australian Languages have a common origin, but this has not been proved: there is indeed a general accordance in phonetics, as shown by the universal rejection of Sibilants: a common stock of primitive words, members of the body, objects of a general nature and Personal Pronouns: the imperfect conception of Number, and the uniform use of the same word for \"two\": the use of the dual Suffixes, and duplicate terms for the same objects: but on the other hand there are tremendous differences in the word-store of even adjacent tribes. In the last generation African Languages were spoken of as a unit, but we know better now. The theory of a connection of the typical Australian, before the Languages have been thoroughly studied, with the typical characteristics of the Dravidian of South India may be passed over as premature. All the Languages known are agglutinative, they have no Relative Pronoun or Article, and only sexual Gender: the accent falls generally on the Penultimate: there is an extensive use of onomatopoeic words. The perfection of the Language, as a Language, is a contrast to the barbarity of the people, as a people, but this is not an uncommon phenomenon. The construction is very complex, and some of the sentences are impossible to translate. It is much to be regretted that the study of these Languages has been so neglected, as the Australians occupy the lowest round in the ladder of human civilization, on a level with the Bushmen of South Africa, and the logical arrangement of thought, as represented by their word-forms, and sentence moulds, presents most interesting peeps into the working of unsophisticated minds.\n\nIt is obvious that a great deal more has still to be done before anything like a complete statement of the Languages of Oceania can be made, and I can only repeat what I\nhave often said before, that, until accurate data of all the Languages of the World are collected and collated, all speculations as to the origin of Language-Families, or of the power of Speech itself, are premature. Speculations as to the affinities of these Languages of Oceania with those of the rest of the World seem to be hazardous, as we have no written records to guide us. The existence of the English Language, as the Vernacular of Pitcairn's Island, would have been a puzzle, if the Mutiny of the Bounty had happened a thousand years ago, and had not been a part of written Modern History. Many a mutiny, many a storm and shipwreck, many a fortunate wind-driven passage over a vast ocean, has contributed its quota to the population of these Islands; but the brave men, who founded the new Colony, are like those, who lived before Agamemnon, and are forgotten. Even in these last days the results of the working of Commercial instinct are marvellous. These Islands of Melanesia had once an unequalled supply of Sandalwood, and have still an inexhaustible supply of a particular Slug called \"Beche de Mer\": the wood was a requisite for the Chinese Joss-worship, and the Slug for Chinese Belly-worship, and Englishmen and Americans from their distant homes were the degraded agents in this commerce. There is still an English patois current in the Islands, known as \"Beche de Mer English,\" and it is amusing to read in a Frenchman's account of New Caledonia, that he had to communicate with the Natives in this choice Patois, in which Frenchmen are always spoken of as \"Wee wee,\" and God as a \"Big Fellow,\" both terms being used with most profound respect. British are called in New Guinea \"Biritani Dimdim,\" no doubt for the same National Word peculiarity, that led Froissart to call them the English \"Goddam\" at the battle of Agincourt, 1405 A.D. The French system everywhere is to make the use of their Language the test of loyalty, but they will have a hopeless fight in Oceania against English owing to its innate freedom from the shackles of Grammatical Inflections, Genders and Number, and its power of assimilation of foreign words. Bishop Selwyn (the elder) remarked, that the first\nEuropean word known in the New Hebrides was \"Bishop,\" and the second \"Tobacco.\" There is a danger that the literary Language, which springs up from the prentice-hands of good and earnest men, is not calculated to convey a clear idea of the primitive simplicity of the form of speech, as it flows undefiled from the lips of men. It could have been wished that more legends and stories had been taken down verbatim from the mouths of the people gathered together in social intercourse, than translations of a book written in a totally different type of Language, and transferred to another, fettered by theological interpretations and pre-possessions. Unless the translator had caught the real genius of the Language, not only the Language in existence, but its undeveloped power of providing for new ideas out of its own plastic resources, it is to be feared, that new and foreign and unsympathetic phrases, idioms, and even grammatical forms may have been introduced by a single translator, working in his study with the aid of a couple of catechists, brought up in his own school, and not exposed to the candid criticism of an independent and educated audience, or the fiery attacks of a Public Press. What would the fate of Hindi and Urdu have been, had they been left to the tender mercies of the English Judge and his Writer of Proceedings? It is stated that old men in Oceania converse with each other in an idiom no more understood by their children than the words of an old Manx woman in the Isle of Man are by her grandchildren in the English-speaking Board-School.\n\nIt must be recollected that this sketch of a great subject does not in any way pretend to finality: it is merely a kind of literary \"Vorschmack\" to whet the student's appetite. The Map, specially prepared, at any rate is physically exact: the list of Languages is susceptible of expansion, as Explorers traverse new Regions, and Missionaries collect together new tribes, but susceptible of contraction, as Linguistic Knowledge deepens, and great comparative linguists point out that many of the forms of speech recorded and deemed distinct are nearly identical, at the best only dialectal\nvarieties, at the worst only branches and twigs of the same common stock.\n\nPROVISIONAL LIST OF LANGUAGES OF OCEANIA UP TO MAY, 1887.\n\n1 Polynesia ........................................... 30\n2 Melanesia I.

XIII.\u2014Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da in Sindh. By Major-General M. R. Haig, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe extract from the Narrative of his Travels by Ebu \u2018Abdu-\u2019ll\u0101h Muhammed of Tangier, commonly called Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da, an English translation of which appears below, relates to his experiences in the province of Sindh, and touches on matters of local history and geography which may interest some readers, and be thought deserving of such elucidation as may be possible. These matters are noticed in the remarks subjoined to the extract, a form of comment which I have thought preferable to the alternative of interrupting the narrative by frequent and copious footnotes.\n\nThe edition of Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da\u2019s work which I have used is that of Defr\u00e9mercy and Sanguinetti,\u00b9 and the extract begins vol. iii. p. 93, where the second part of the book opens with the account of the traveller\u2019s arrival in India.\n\nTRANSLATION.\n\n\u201cOn the 1st Muharrem, the commencement of the year 734 A.H. (12th Sept. 1333 A.D.), we reached the river Sind, known as the \u2018Panj\u0101b,\u2019 the meaning of which is \u2018Five rivers.\u2019 This is one of the largest rivers in the world. It overflows during the hot season, and the people of the country sow their lands during the inundation, as do the people of Egypt during the inundation of the Nile. At this river begin the territories of the revered Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Muhammed Sh\u0101h,\u00b2 King of Hind and Sind. When we arrived at the river, the\n\n\u00b9 Voyages d'Ibn Batoutah.

Publi\u00e9 par La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique.\n\u00b2 Muhammed Sh\u0101h bin Tughlaq succeeded to the Delhi throne in 725 A.H. (1325 A.D.).\nofficial Intelligencers came to us and wrote information about us to Qutbu'l-Mulk, the governor of the town of Mult\u0101n. The chief governor of Sind at this time was a slave of the Sult\u0101n named 'Sart\u012bz,' (holding the office or title of) 'Aridzu'l-Mem\u0101lik, and charged with the oversight of the royal forces. The meaning of his name is 'the sharp head,' for 'sar' means 'head,' and 't\u012bz' means 'sharp.' At the time of our arrival he was at the town of Siwast\u0101n in Sind, between which place and Mult\u0101n there is ten days' journey. Between the country of Sind and the capital (Delhi) there is fifty days' journey, and when the Intelligencers write to the Sult\u0101n from Sind, their reports reach him in five days owing to (the rapidity of) the Berid.\"\n\nHere follows an account of the 'Berid' or Post, of the Sult\u0101n's regulations for the reception of travellers from foreign countries, and a description of the 'Karkadan' or Rhinoceros, a specimen of which the author saw just after crossing the Indus.\n\n\"We travelled for two days from the river Sind, and arrived at the town of Jan\u0101n\u012b (\u062c\u0646\u0627\u064a\u0646\u064a), a large and beautiful town on the bank of the river Sind, possessing excellent markets. Its inhabitants are a tribe called Es-S\u0101mara (\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0629), who have had their home there from ancient times, and whose ancestors settled in the place at the time of its conquest in the days of Hajj\u0101j, son of Y\u016bsuf, according to what the chroniclers have recorded concerning the conquest of Sind. The Sheykh Ruknu'd-d\u012bn, son of the Jurist Shemsu'd-d\u012bn, son of the Im\u0101m Beh\u0101'u'd-d\u012bn Zekariy\u0101, Qureysh\u012b (one of the three persons whom the Sheykh Burh\u0101nu'd-d\u012bn El-A\u2018arej, in the city of Alexandria, told me I should meet in my travels, and meet them I did, praise be to God!), told me that the greatest of his ancestors was named Muhammed, son of Q\u0101sim Qureysh\u012b, and that he took part in the conquest of Sind in the army which Hajj\u0101j, son of Y\u016bsuf, when he governed Ir\u0101q, sent for that purpose; and that he settled in the country, and his descendants grew numerous.\n\nThe tribe known as 'Es-S\u0101mara' do not eat in company with\n\n1 Barn\u012b gives the title as 'Sart\u012bz-i-Sult\u0101n\u012b.'\n2 That is, from the left, or eastern bank, to which the author had crossed. The crossing of the river is mentioned at the beginning of his account of the Rhinoceros.\n3 The numerous eulogistic epithets applied to the Sheykh and his ancestors are omitted.\nanybody (not belonging to them), and nobody looks at them when they are eating; they form no marriages with those not of their tribe, and no stranger marries among them. At this time they had a chief named Wunar,\\(^1\\) an account of whom we shall give.\n\nWe travelled from the town of Jan\u0101n\u012b, and arrived at S\u012bwast\u0101n.\\(^2\\) This is a large town. The country outside it is desert and tracts of sand; there is not a tree in it but the Acacia (Umm Ghayl\u0101n), and they cultivate nothing on its river but melons. The food of the people is Dhura (Sorghum or Indian Millet), and the pulse which they call Mushunk (Mung, Phaseolus Mungo), of which (the millet) they make bread. Here there is abundance of fish and of Buffalo-milk. The people of the place eat the 'saqanq\u016br,' a small reptile resembling the chameleon, which the people of Meghreb call 'Huneyschetu'l-jenna' (small garden-lizard), except that it has no tail. I saw them digging in the sand and pulling out the creature from it, then ripping up its belly, throwing away its contents, and stuffing it with 'Kurkum' (safflower), which they call 'zerd-sh\u016bba' (ch\u016bba), meaning 'yellow-stick,' which with them takes the place of saffron. When I saw this little reptile, and the people eating it, I regarded it as unclean and did not partake of it.\n\nWe entered this town during the intensely hot period of the summer,\\(^3\\) and the heat of the place was extreme, so that my companions seated themselves naked, each placing a waist-wrapper round his middle, and a wrapper moistened with water over his shoulders. But a little time passed till the wrapper dried, when it was again wetted, and this went on continually. I met in this town its preacher, named Esh-Sheyb\u0101n\u012b. He showed me a written deed of the Commander of the Faithful, the Khalifa 'Umar, son of 'Abdu'l-'Az\u012bz, (granted) to the greatest of his ancestors, conferring on him the preachership of this town. The family have held it by inheritance from that time till now.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The author gives the details of spelling and pointing, so that 'Wunar' is what he intended, but it will hereafter be shown that the person referred to was named Unar.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the detail of the pointing of the name it is said that the second sin is meku\u016br; we should therefore transliterate Siwast\u0101n. At the present day many Sindhis would follow this pointing in writing the name, as it is a common practice to point a consonant with ke\u1e63ra, which, in strictness, ought to be quiescent. In such cases, however, the pronunciation of the ke\u1e63ra is so faint as to be hardly perceptible to the ear. This old name of S\u0113wan is now obsolete. I am uncertain whether Siwast\u0101n or Siwist\u0101n is the correct form.\n\n\\(^3\\) comprising part of May, all June and July, and part of August.\nform of the deed is: 'This is the command of the servant of God, the Commander of the Faithful, 'Umar, son of 'Abdu'l-'Ariz, & so and so,' and its date is 99 H. (717\u201318 A.D.). On it is written, as the said preacher told me, in the handwriting of the Commander of the Faithful: 'Praise be to the One God!' In this place I also met the aged Sheykh Muhammed of Baghd\u0101d, who (lived) in the hospice by the tomb of the upright Sheykh Uthm\u0101n of Mered. It was said that his age exceeded 140 years, and that he was present at the murder of El-Must'asim-bi'll\u0101h, the last Khal\u012bfah of the Ben\u012b 'Abb\u0101s dynasty, who was slain by the infidel Hul\u0101q\u016b (Hul\u0101q\u016b) grandson of Tang\u012bz (Ching\u012bz) the T\u0101t\u0101r. The Sheykh, though of so great an age, was strong of body, and went about on foot.\n\nA Story.\n\nThere lived in this town the Am\u012br Wun\u0101r Es-S\u0101m\u0101r\u012b, who has been previously mentioned, and the Am\u012br Qayser Er-R\u016bm\u012b, both in the service of the Sult\u0101n, and with them some 1800 horsemen. There, too, lived an infidel Hind\u016b named Ratan, who was skilled in reckoning and writing. He waited on the King of India with certain nobles. The King was pleased with him, named him a noble of Sind, gave him the government of that country, and assigned to him Siwast\u0101n and its dependencies in fief. He also conferred on him the honorific distinctions of drums and banners such as are granted to the great nobles. When he arrived in the country the precedence of the infidel over them galloped Wun\u0101r Qayser and the rest, and they determined on his assassination. Accordingly, when some days had passed after his arrival, they suggested to him to go out into the dependencies of the town to inquire into the state of affairs there; so he went with them. When night fell, they raised an alarm in the camp, pretending that a lion had attacked it, and they went to the tent of the infidel and killed him. They then returned to the town and took what royal revenue there was in it, amounting to 12 laks. [The 'lak' is (an amount of) one hundred thousand (silver) din\u0101rs, and the 'lak' (of silver din\u0101rs) is equal to ten thousand din\u0101rs of Indian gold. The Indian (gold) din\u0101r is equal to two and a half din\u0101rs.]\n\n1 This holy man flourished in the 13th century. His shrine, better known than that of Lal Sh\u0101h B\u0101z, is still of great celebrity.\n\n2 The tragedy witnessed by the Sheykh occurred in 656 H. It does not follow that he must have been of an unprecedented age in 734 H., or 78 lunar years later.\nthe gold of Meghreb (Northern Africa west of Egypt).] They then placed at their head the aforesaid Wun\u0101r, and named him Melik F\u012broz. He distributed the revenue among the troops. Afterwards he took fright about himself because of his distance from his people, so he went off to them with such of his intimate associates as were with him. The remainder of the troops placed Qay\u1e63er-er-R\u016bm\u012b over themselves. Information about them now reached \u2018Im\u0101du\u2019l-Mulk Sart\u012bz, the slave of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, and the chief governor of Sind, who had his residence in Mult\u0101n. He assembled an army and started an expedition both by land and by the river Sind. Now between Mult\u0101n and S\u012bwast\u0101n there is ten days' journey.\u00b9 Qay\u1e63er went out against him, and an encounter took place in which Qay\u1e63er was routed, and those who were with him shamefully fled and took refuge in the town, where Sart\u012bz besieged them and set up mangonels against them. The siege so distressed them that after forty days from the beginning of the investment they begged for protection, which he granted; but when they came before him, he treated them with treachery, took their property, and commanded that they should be slain. He used to behead some of them each day, some of them he had cleft in twain, and others he flayed, filled their skins with straw, and had them fastened to the town walls. The most of these skins were hung on crosses, terrifying to those who beheld them. Their heads he collected in the midst of the town, so that they formed as it were a mound there. I alighted at the great college in the town just after this event. On the roof of this building I used to sleep, and when I awoke at night and saw these skins hung on crosses, I shuddered at them. I could not bear living in the college, and therefore removed from it.\n\nThe accomplished and just jurist \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u\u2019l-Mulk of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, known as \u2018Fa\u1e63\u1e25u\u2019d-d\u012bn,\u2019 formerly Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b of Hir\u0101t, had waited upon the King of India, who had conferred on him the governorship of the town of L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b and its dependencies in the country of Sind. He had been present in these commotions with \u2018Im\u0101du\u2019l-Mulk Sart\u012bz, among the military force accompanying him. I determined to go with him to the town of L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b. He had fifteen boats in which he proceeded by the river Sind, and with him I travelled.\u201d\n\nHere follows an account of \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u\u2019l-Mulk\u2019s arrangements while voyaging on the Indus.\n\n\u00b9 By river. The distance exceeds 400 miles.\n\"I travelled five days with 'Al\u0101'\u016b'l-Mulk, and we arrived at the seat of his government, L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b, a fine town on the shore of the ocean where the river Sind flows into it, so that two seas meet. It has a large harbour to which come people of Yem\u0101, F\u0101rs, and other places. Owing to this the customs collected are large and the revenues of the place considerable. The above-mentioned 'Al\u0101'\u016b'l-Mulk, the governor, informed me that the collections of this town are sixty laks annually. (The value of the lak we have already mentioned.) To the governor pertains one-twentieth of this. On such condition the sovereign confers governments, (the grantees) taking a twentieth of the revenue.\n\nAccount of a strange thing which I saw in the country outside this town.\n\nI one day rode with 'Al\u0101'\u016b'l-Mulk to a spacious place, distant seven miles (from Lah\u0101r\u012b), called T\u0101rn\u0101, where I saw innumerable stones in the form of human beings and animals. Very many were altered (from their original form) and their (distinguishing) features were obliterated, so that there remained but the shape of a head or foot, or other member. Among the stones, too, were some in the form of grains of wheat, of the chick-pea, the bean and the lentil. There, too, were traces of a town-wall, and of the court-yards of houses (\u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0648\u0631 \u0648 \u062c\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u064f\u0648\u0631). Afterwards we saw the remains of a house in which was a chamber of hewn stone. In the middle of this was a platform (\u0646\u064f\u0642\u064e\u0651\u0629) of hewn stone, like a single block, and on it the figure of a man, except that its head was elongated, and its mouth on the side of the face, and the hands were behind the back like a captive's. There were also pools of extremely stinking water in the place. On part of a court-yard wall there was an inscription in the Hindi language. 'Al\u0101'\u016b'l-Mulk told me that historians state that a great city existed in this place, and that most of its people were depraved, for which cause they were turned into stone, and that their ruler was he who was on the platform in the house which we have mentioned, and which is to the present time called D\u0101ru'l Melik (the ruler's house); also that the Hindi inscription on one of the court-yard walls contains the date of the destruction of the inhabitants of this city, which occurred a thousand years ago or thereabouts.\n\n1 The word Bahr being applicable both to the ocean and to a large river like the Indus, the author fancifully describes the junction of this stream with the sea as the meeting of two Bahrs, or seas.\nI stayed with 'Al\u0101'u'l-Mulk five days in this town. He then furnished me liberally with provisions for travelling, and I parted from him (and proceeded) to the town of Bak\u0101r (Bakhar). This is a fine town; a channel from the Sind divides it. In the middle of this channel there is a fine hospice, where food is provided for passers-by. Kashl\u016b Kh\u0101n built it during the time of his government of the country of Sind.\u00b9 In this town I met the jurist and Im\u0101m, \u1e62adru'd-d\u012bn the Hanifite. Here, too, I met the Q\u0101z\u012b of the place, named Ebu Han\u012bfa, and the devout and self-denying Sheykh, Shemsu'd-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad of Sh\u012br\u0101z, who is among the very aged men. He told me that his age exceeded 120 years. Afterwards I travelled from Bak\u0101r and arrived at the town of \u00dcchch, a large place on the bank of the river Sind, possessing fine markets and excellent structures. Its governor at that time was the accomplished and noble Melik Jel\u0101lu'd-d\u012bn El-Kij\u012b, a brave and generous man. He died in this town in consequence of a severe fall from his horse.\"\n\nHere follows an account of the governor's generosity; also of a pious Sheykh who presented him with a \"Khirqa\" or ragged garment worn by devotees.\n\n\"From \u00dcchch I travelled to the town of Mult\u0101n, which is the seat of government in Sind, and the residence of the chief governor. On the road thither, and at a distance of ten miles from it, is the river known as Khusr\u016b\u0101b\u0101d, a large stream crossed only by boat. Here travellers' goods are examined very strictly, and their luggage closely searched. At the time of our arrival it was their custom to take a fourth of all that the merchants carried, and they levied a duty of seven din\u0101rs on every horse. Two years after our arrival in India the Sult\u0101n did away with these duties, and directed that nothing was to be taken from people but the alms-dues and the tithe. This was at the time when he professed allegiance to the Khal\u012bfa Ebu'l-'Abb\u0101s of the 'Abb\u0101s dynasty. When we began the crossing of the river, and the packages were being examined, I was annoyed by the searching of my baggage, for there was nothing valuable in it, though in the eyes of people it looked considerable, and it was much against my will that it was\n\n\u00b9 Melik Bahr\u0101m Abiya received the title of Kashl\u016b Kh\u0101n from Sult\u0101n Ghiy\u0101su'd-d\u012bn on the accession of this sovereign in 720 H.

In the next reign he rebelled, and in an action with the royal troops was defeated and killed.\nexamined. Through the goodness of the Almighty, one of the principal military officers arrived on the part of Qutb\u016bl-M\u016bk, the lord of Mult\u0101n, and ordered that I should not be subjected to inspection and to the searching (of my baggage), and so it was settled, and I praised God for His goodness vouchsafed to me. We spent this night on the bank of the river. In the morning the Chief of the Ber\u016bl (or Post) named Dahq\u0101n, a native of Samarqand, came to us. He it was who used to write to the Sahib the news of the town and its dependencies, of any fresh occurrences therein, and of those arriving in the place. I made myself known to him, and in company with him I waited on the governor of Mult\u0101n.\"\n\n**Remarks on the Extract.**\n\nThough abounding in curious and interesting information, Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da\u2019s account of his travels is disappointing from a geographical point of view. The traveller had an eye for a fine town or a well-stocked market, and the pronounced taste of the devout Musulm\u0101n for venerable Sheykhs and learned theologians, but his faculty for geographical observation was evidently meagre. The result is that the reader finds himself carried at a bound over vast spaces of country, for the features and topography of which the author has not a word to spare.\n\nIn consequence of this peculiarity of Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da\u2019s, we are left in doubt as to the spot at which his Indian travels may be said to have begun. He tells of his arrival on the bank of that portion of the Indus called the \u201cPanj\u0101b,\u201d but gives no name to the locality, and supplies no means of identifying it. As will presently be seen, there is some reason for placing it in the north of the modern province of Sindh, but this conjecture involves the difficulty of accounting for Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da\u2019s taking such an unusual route from Q\u0101bul as one that would bring him to the Indus so very far down its course. Had he travelled by Qandah\u0101r and the Bol\u0101n Pass, the case would be different; but he says that he proceeded from Q\u0101bul to India by places called Karm\u0101sh and Sh\u0101ntagh\u0101r, and by the latter I think there can be no doubt.\nthat Hashtnagar, also called 'Ashnagar, sixteen miles north-east of Peshawar, is intended. Here, he says, began \"the great desert,\" extending fifteen days' journey, and subject during the hot season to the blasts of the deadly \"Sam\u016bm.\"\n\nIn the absence of any other indications of the line taken, I can only conclude that he travelled along the base of the Suleym\u0101n range, though why the usual routes which would have taken him to Mult\u0101n, or to \u016achch, were avoided, it is impossible to conjecture. After crossing the Indus, and marching for two days, Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da arrived at a town on the bank of the river called Jan\u0101n\u012b. There is no longer, I believe, any place so called on the Indus, but it may well be that, like hundreds of others, the town of Jan\u0101n\u012b has long since been swallowed up by that insatiable river. We are told, however, that it was inhabited by a people called \"Es-S\u0101mara,\" to whom an Arab origin is assigned, but whose customs, as described by our traveller, clearly betray their Hind\u016b stock. Later on I shall show why I believe them to have belonged beyond doubt to the Sam\u0101 tribe of Sindh, and if my view is correct, Jan\u0101n\u012b must have been somewhere within the limits of the Pargana of Kandh\u012b\u0101ro, fifty miles south of Rohr\u012b, which is identical with a very ancient territorial division, and is well known to have belonged from time immemorial to the Sam\u0101s of Upper Sindh.\u00b9 Unfortunately Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da omits to mention the number of marches from Jan\u0101n\u012b to Siwast\u0101n, from which known point a measurement would have enabled us to come to a more satisfactory conclusion regarding the position of the former town; but on the ground above mentioned I think it may be taken that this was somewhere in the Kandh\u012b\u0101ro Pargana, and therefore about fifty miles north-east of Siwast\u0101n (S\u0113wan). In this case Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da must have\n\n\u00b9 The Chach N\u0101ma mentions the northern limit of the Sam\u0101 lands. It says that R\u0101e Chach, when proceeding (circa 633 A.D.) to B\u016bdhiya (N.W. Sindh) and Siwast\u0101n, left Alor \"and crossed the Mihr\u00e1n (Indus) at a place called Dahi\u0101yat, which is on the border of the Sam\u0101 and Alor (districts).\" Dah\u012byat may be identified with a township called D\u0113h\u0101t, on the northern border of the Kandh\u012b\u0101ro Pargana, by which the Indus once ran, as evidenced by its forsaken channel still quite distinct. This spot is about fifty miles south of Alor and Rohr\u012b. The Indus now runs nine or ten miles to the west of the course here referred to.\ncrossed the Indus some forty miles (two marches) high up its course, and therefore but a short distance below Bakhar, then the chief town on the lower Indus, which might thus suppose he had at this time some object in avoiding, though he visited it not long afterwards. But as I shall have occasion to notice hereafter, a long time passed at this period of his travels respecting which our author gives no account whatever. Much may have happened, and many places may have been visited in the interval, but the narrative is a blank in regard to this portion of the writer's experiences. Either recollection failed, or there was a deliberate purpose to suppress the record of what may have been uneventful or unpleasant, and the consequence is some confusion in the narrative and much that remains unaccountable.\n\nThe next place named is Siwast\u016bn, in order to reach which the traveller must have regained the right bank of the Indus, but of this he says nothing. The town is described as large, but the surrounding country as desert and sandy (\u0633\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0621\u060c \u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0644), without any tree but the Acacia. This differs very much from the account of it given by the Arab geographers, some of whom visited it in the tenth century. Of these Ibnu Hawqil, as quoted by Ebu'l-Fid\u0101, says that the town abounded in good things, and was surrounded by villages and townships; while Idr\u012bs\u012b (on the reports of other writers) says of it in the twelfth century that it \"is remarkable for its size and the number of its fountains and canals, for the abundance of its productions, and for its rich commerce.\" 1 Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da's description, however, is quite correct if limited to the country south of the town, which is a sandy ridge extending for about four miles to the lower slopes of the so-called Laki range. On other sides the land is remarkably fertile, though doubtless in the unsettled times described by the traveller it would be lying waste.\n\nIt may be noticed that Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da does not say that the\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot's Historians of India, vol. i. p. 79.\ntown was on the bank of the Indus as Jan\u0101n\u012b was. He speaks, however, of \"its river\" (\u0646\u0647\u0631\u0647\u0627), probably referring to the Aral which flows round the northern side of the town.\u00b9\n\nIt is true that in Istakhri's map, as well as in Ibnu Hawqil's (Elliot's Hist. vol. i. p. 32), both illustrating the geography of Sindh in the middle of the tenth century, Siwast\u0101n (then called Sad\u016bs\u0101n) is represented as actually on the Indus, though in their texts both geographers describe the town as \"to the west of the river,\" not as actually on the west bank. In both maps, too, the town of Daybal, or D\u0113wal, is represented as actually on the shore of the Indian Ocean, though, as I shall presently show, it is physically impossible that any town could have been so situated within the limits of the Delta, and that we must infer nothing more than comparative proximity to the sea\u2014a distance of a few miles more or less. The same may have been the case in regard to the relative positions of Sad\u016bs\u0101n and the course of the Indus in those days, and I think it not improbable that in Ibnu Bat\u016bt\u0101's time, and for many years subsequently, the river ran in a channel, portions of which are still to be seen ten miles east of Sew\u0101n. There is a still older channel twenty miles east of the town.\u00b2\n\nReturning to our traveller, a curious fact, previously alluded to, has here to be noticed. He says that he reached Siwast\u0101n during the intense heat of summer, and from his description of the methods of cooling themselves resorted to by his friends, it is evident that hot winds were blowing. The season must have been that known in Sindh as the\n\n\u00b9 The Aral is really the southern end of the stream called N\u0101r\u014d (\"Western N\u0101r\u014d\") which leaves the west bank of the Indus near L\u0101dk\u0101n\u016b, and after a course considerably exceeding 100 miles, expands into the Manchur lake\u2014or swamp\u2014eight miles due west of S\u0113wan. Thence it issues, and passing eastward, runs close under the walls of the fort of S\u0113wan, rejoining the Indus near the town. It is the portion between Sew\u0101n and the Manchur lake that bears the name of \"Aral.\" Though not mentioned by name, it is distinctly referred to in the \"Chach N\u0101ma,\" in the account of the siege of Siwast\u0101n by the Arabs in 711 A.D.; and it is most probably that which is alluded to by Bel\u0101dhuri in the \"Fut\u016bh\u016b-s-Sind,\" when he speaks of Mu\u1e25ammed Q\u0101sim's \"crossing a river on this (the west) side of the M\u012bhr\u0101n\" (\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0647\u0631\u06cc \u0646\u0632\u062f\u06cc\u06a9), there being, indeed, no other which could be so described.\n\n\u00b2 Within my own experience the Indus has at one time run close under the town, and at another three to four miles or more eastward of it.\nputting it at the utmost possible, being no more have been covered with ease in three weeks, narrative certainly conveys the idea of the journey been continuous, and not having occupied many days Bat\u016b\u1e6da, it must be remembered, would not, especially writing long after the events recorded, himself to notice this discrepancy between the apparent actual lapse of time, for the period referred to was a lunar month\u2014Muharram\u2014and ended with a fine\u2014summer,\u2014and it is only on noting the solar year that particular Muharram fell that the length is discovered. Moreover, his experiences in Sindh a tame and commonplace character, while his life at the court of Delhi was crowded with impressive striking events likely to absorb his recollection, and the memory of a preceding and more uneventful some such way, perhaps, may be explained the fact traveller spent several months in Sindh, of the which he has left no record.\n\nBut a more interesting subject for consideration itself in the account of the local rebellion at headed by Wun\u0101r, the chief, as we have previously told, of the tribe of Es-S\u016bmara. It is well known this time the two most powerful tribes in Sindh\nwhole history is involved in obscurity, as is also that of the early Sam\u0101 chiefs. In the case of both tribes the attempt has been made by zealous Muhammedan writers to conceal the fact of their Hind\u016b origin, and to assign them a descent more distinguished in the eyes of Muslims than their real one from R\u0101jputs. Thus the \"Tu\u1e25fetu'l-kir\u0101m\" (a local history written by a Seyyid of Th\u0101\u1e6da) says: \"The S\u016bmra tribe sprang from the Arabs of S\u0101mira, who arrived in Sindh in the second century of the Hijra, accompanying the Tam\u012bm, who became governors of Sind under the 'Abassides.\"\u00b9 For the Sam\u0101 also an Arab descent was devised, and a still more ridiculous fiction traced their origin to Jamsh\u012bd, and even to S\u0101m, son of N\u016bh!\u00b2 But if any refutation of this rubbish were needed, it would suffice to mention the fact that there are Hind\u016b S\u016bmra and Sam\u0101 in Sindh and Kachchh to this day. The Sam\u0101 too are mentioned in the Chach N\u0101ma as a Sindhi tribe long before the Arab conquest.\u00b3\n\nI have already mentioned that I believe Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da's \"Es-S\u0101mara\" to be the Sam\u0101 tribe. This belief is founded on the fact, first, that his description of their customs clearly shows that the S\u0101mara were Hindus, and therefore an indigenous Sindhi tribe; and next, that he tells us their chief was the Wun\u0101r who headed the uprising at Siwast\u0101n. Now, M\u012br M\u02bfa\u1e63\u016bm, in his \"T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Sind,\" gives the following account of J\u0101m Unar, the first of the Sam\u0101 rulers in Sindh; and though the historian, writing 300 years after the event, and depending apparently on local traditions, is in some confusion as to names and occurrences, and though his chronology does not fit-in with Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da's, it will be seen that he is evidently describing the events of which the traveller, as a contemporary, and almost an eye-witness, gives a more correct account. After describing the accession of one \"Arm\u012bl,\" who succeeded the last of the S\u016bmra rulers, and proved such an intolerable\n\n\u00b9 Elliot's Historians of India, vol. i. p. 485.\n\u00b2 Ibid. p. 495.\n\u00b3 See ante, p. 401, note.\ntyrant that the people resolved to e him, Mr M\u0101\u1e63\u016bm proceeds:\n\n\"A body of Sam\u0101s had come from Kachchh and settled in Sind, and between them and the Sind\u012bs a path of mutual esteem and alliance had been cleared. One of these Sam\u0101s named Unar, was remarkable for intelligence.\" (Account of the murder of Armil.) \"They then proceeded with a number of people and seated Unar on the throne of sovereignty.\"\n\nHe proceeded with a large force to the conquest of Siwast\u0101n and arriving in the vicinity of that place, prepared to attack Melik Ratan, an officer of the Turk dynasty. Melik Ratan with forces arrayed, issued from the fort to the battle-field and commenced the attack. On that day J\u0101m Unar was routed at the first charge, but on a second occasion he collected a force with the aid of his brethren, and appeared on the field of action. Melik Ratan fell from his horse when it was at full gallop, and J\u0101m Unar severed his head from his body. He then took possession of the fort of Siwast\u0101n. Melik Firoz and \u2018Aliyy Sh\u0101h, Turk, who were in the Bakhar territory, wrote to him saying that this audacity was unbecoming, and that he should now prepare to meet the royal forces, and show his valour and firmness on the battle-field. (Alarmed) at these words, he abandoned his enterprise, and proceeded to Thari (a place in Lower Sindh).\"\n\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that Ibn Bat\u016bta\u2019s \u201cWun\u0101r\u201d is identical with the Unar of Mr M\u0101\u1e63\u016bm. The historian gives no date for these occurrences, but from subsequent statements of his in connection with the history of the Sam\u0101 rulers, it may be inferred that he supposed the Siwast\u0101n affair to have happened about 1285 A.D., or some fifty years earlier than Ibn Bat\u016bta\u2019s date. On the other hand, the Beg L\u0101r N\u0101ma (another local chronicle) dates the commencement of the Sam\u0101 rule in 734 H. (1333\u20134 A.D.),\u00b9 the very year in which Ibn Bat\u016bta places the Siwast\u0101n rebellion. Further confirmation is found in Kachchh and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101\u1e0d annals, from which it appears\n\n\u00b9 Elliot\u2019s Historians of India, vol. i. p. 494.\nthat there undoubtedly was a Sam\u0101 chief named Un\u0101\u1e0d (or Unar) ruling in the former province in the early part of the fourteenth century, by whom, or by whose son, the ancient fortress of Ghumli in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101\u1e0d was stormed in 1313 A.D.\u00b9\n\nFrom all this evidence, then, it may be safely concluded that in describing the events immediately preceding his arrival at Siwast\u0101n, Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6d\u0101 has fixed for us within a year or two the date of the commencement of Sam\u0101 rule in Sindh, and thus is solved a question which has been much discussed without, up to the present time, any satisfactory result. It is to be wished that something could have been gathered from Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6d\u0101's pages to throw light upon the much more interesting question of the period at which the conversion of the bulk of the population to Isl\u0101m occurred. Unar is described as a Musulm\u0101n, though the Kachchh Sam\u0101s for the most part ever remained true to their original faith; but it is possible that when he emigrated to Sindh the movement in favour of Isl\u0101m was becoming more active, and that he found a change of religion desirable for the furtherance of his aims in that country. His feelings towards the Hind\u016b Ratan may be explained by the proverbial hatred of the apostate for the professors of his former religion. However this may be, it is certain that soon after the accession of the Sam\u0101s to power, the names of the chiefs of Lower Sindh become distinctly Muhammedan, and it seems probable that a general change of religion was nearly coincident with the transfer of authority from Sumr\u0101s to Sam\u0101s in the first half of the fourteenth century.\n\nBut it is time to follow the further course of our traveller. From Siwast\u0101n, or S\u0113wan,\u00b2 he proceeded down river to L\u0101hari, a voyage of five days he tells us. As the Indus\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Burgess' Report on Antiquities of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101\u1e0d and Kachchh, p. 178. Archeological Survey of Western India.\n\u00b2 This name is spelt by Sindhis as variously as by Englishmen. The most usual form is \u0633\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646\u2014S\u0113wan\u2014and, however written, it is invariably pronounced in accordance with this spelling.\nran in those days\u2014far east of its present course\u2014the distance would be about 300 miles, and as it was the time of high flood (June or July), a progress with the current of sixty miles a day would be quite feasible, supposing the voyage not to be interrupted by the strong southerly gales common at that season. It will be observed that he never once mentions Tha\u1e6da, though he must have passed very near the site of that town. The omission of any notice of this afterwards became the capital of Lower Sindh, and the most populous town in the entire province, at once suggests that either it was not then in existence, or was too unimportant to attract particular attention. The author of the Tuhfat al-Kir\u0101m, himself a native of Tha\u1e6da, says that the town was founded by J\u0101m Niz\u0101mu\u2019d-din, commonly called J\u0101m Nand, who succeeded to the chiefship in 1461 A.D., a statement which shows how little the author\u2019s chronology is to be trusted. The earliest mention of the place, so far as I know, is about 1347-8, near the close of Muhammed Sh\u0101h Tugl\u0101q\u2019s reign, and in connection with the rebellion in Guz\u0101r incited by one of the populace named Tagh\u012b. This man hunted from place to place, at last took refuge at Tha\u1e6da whither he was pursued by the furious sovereign, who died near the town in 1351.\u00b9 We may thus infer that Tha\u1e6da was founded between the time of Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da\u2019s visit to Lower Sind (1334) and the year 1347. According to the local chronicles, the first capital of the Sam\u016bs was S\u0101m\u016bl, or S\u0101mu\u1e25\u012b, the site of which is on the Kalr\u012b branch of the Indus, three miles north of Tha\u1e6da; but while it was still in course of building, the position was found to be unsuitable, and the population migrated to the site farther south. It was perhaps while this movement was in progress that Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da passed by.\n\nThe ruins of L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b, so long the sea-port of Sindh, are still to be seen on the northern bank of a tidal channel called the R\u0101ho, which communicates with the Bagh\u012b branch of the Indus. The spot is twenty-eight miles south.\n\n\u00b9 See Z\u012b\u0101-Barn\u012b\u2019s T\u016br\u012bkh-i-F\u012brozsh\u0101h\u012b.\neast of Kar\u0101ch\u012b, and twelve miles in a direct line from the sea-coast, the distance by water being sixteen miles. As there is no reason to suppose that this part of the Delta has made any very large advance seawards during the five centuries and a half that have passed since Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da was there, it is clear that his expression, \"on the shore of the sea,\" in describing the situation of L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b, was not intended to be taken literally. It is not possible, indeed, for any town to exist in the belt of land in the Delta, some miles in breadth, immediately bordering on the Indian Ocean, as this low-lying tract is liable to inundation at any high tide, and exposed to the furious inroads of the sea during the S.W. Monsoon. The port was variously named L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b, Lah\u0101r\u012b and L\u0101hor\u012b, and later came to be known by Englishmen as Larrybunder. It seems to have existed as early as the beginning of the eleventh century, if, as there appears no reason to doubt, it was the \"Lohar\u0101n\u012b at the embouchure of the river\" mentioned by El B\u012br\u016bn\u012b.\u00b9 The still earlier port of D\u0113wal, mentioned by Arab chroniclers as existing in the first half of the seventh century, and doubtless then some hundreds of years old, was abandoned probably in the thirteenth century, but its name long survived it, and was sometimes applied to its successor L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b. The latter was known to the early Portuguese adventurers as Diul and Dulcindi, and the first English who visited the coast (in 1613) called L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b \"the city Diul,\" while Capt. Hamilton, who was there in 1700, says the branch of the river on which it stood was named \"Divellee,\" evidently his corruption of Diwali.\u00b2 L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b continued to be the port of Sindh down to the end of the eighteenth century, when the entrance to the R\u0101ho channel had shoaled so much that ships had to seek a more accessible anchorage. This was found at Kar\u0101ch\u012b. A writer in the \"Asiatic Annual Register\" in 1800 says that the customs of Kar\u0101ch\u012b averaged Rs. 125,000, and adds: \"This however must be understood to relate to\n\n\u00b9 Elliot's Historians, vol. i. p. 61.\n\u00b2 See Purchas' Pilgrims, vol. i. pp. 495, 530, 531, and Hamilton's New Account of the East Indies, vol. i. p. 130.\nthe period, which is only of late years, since the channel of Laribunder river has been obstructed, by which Carrache has attained its present commercial importance.\"\u00b9\n\nBut a port in the Delta has remained a necessity for part of the sea-borne trade of Sindh even to the present day, and when L\u0101har\u012b was abandoned, its immediate successor in the Delta was Dh\u0101raja, twelve miles to the south-east, and on a different channel.\n\nThe customs collections of L\u0101har\u012b are stated by Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da to have been \"60 laks,\" and he refers the reader to his previous explanation of what is to be understood by \"lak,\" viz. 100,000 silver dinars, equal to 10,000 dinars. What the value of these dinars may be in modern money I am quite unable to say, but if six lakhs of gold dinars were collected annually at L\u0101har\u012b, it is certain that the gold dinar must have been of small value. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the customs of this port amounted, according to the \"\u0100'\u012bn-i-Akbar\u012b,\" to 5,521,419 D\u0101ms, equivalent to 138,035 Rupees, and there is no reason to suppose that by this time the trade of the place had fallen off. In 1613 the Hind\u016b farmer of the L\u0101har\u012b customs informed the English, whose visit has been above mentioned, that the Portuguese trade alone was worth a lakh of rupees to him,\u00b2 and though this was very likely a gross exaggeration, it may be taken to show that the Portuguese contribution formed a large proportion of the customs.\u00b3\n\nIt is unfortunate that we are unable to identify the position of the ruins described by Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da as existing in a plain called T\u0101rn\u0101, seven miles from L\u0101har\u012b, which were evidently those of some ancient Hind\u016b city. General Cunningham considers that they were most probably the\n\n\u00b9 As. Ann. Register, p. 70 of Chronicle for March, 1800. Kar\u0101ch\u012b was founded in 1726 by a body of traders who migrated from a small port at the mouth of the Hab river named Kharak, where the anchorage had silted up.\n\n\u00b2 Purchas' Pilgrims, vol. i. p. 495.\n\n\u00b3 For fourteen years after the British conquest of Sindh the total sea-customs of Kar\u0101ch\u012b and the Delta ports did not amount to a lakh of rupees. Our tariff has of course always been much more liberal than that of the native rulers, but it is needless to say that trade has increased in a far more than corresponding degree. The highest known collections at Kar\u0101ch\u012b under the Talpurs was 1\u00bd lakh.\nruins of D\u0113wal,\\(^1\\) but as that place could not have been abandoned more than a century previously, the site and its name must surely have been familiar to all the people of the surrounding country.\\(^2\\) The fathers of some still living in the neighbourhood may have seen D\u0113wal when it was yet inhabited, and it is quite impossible that a tradition of its having been destroyed a thousand years before could have gained currency. The name \u201cT\u0101rn\u0101\u201d is unknown in the locality, but the large scale maps show that in the open plain south of the Gh\u0101r\u014d channel there is a ruined site called \u201cMor\u0101-M\u0101r\u012b,\u201d eight miles north-east of L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b, which may perhaps be the one described by Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da. The mention of \u201cinnumerable stones,\u201d some of them very large, would indicate a position in the naturally stoneless Delta, not far from the hilly tract immediately north of the Gh\u0101r\u014d, where they could be quarried, and whence they could be conveyed without excessive expenditure of labour. There is thus a strong presumption in favour of identifying Mor\u0101-M\u0101r\u012b, which is only five miles from the nearest point of the hill-tract, with Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da\u2019s ruined city.\n\nFrom L\u0101h\u0101r\u012b our traveller returned to north Sindh, and arrived at Bak\u0101r, by which of course we are to understand Bakhar. The description he gives of this place is singular. \u201cA channel of the river Sind divides it\u201d (\u064a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0647\u0650\u064a \u062e\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064f \u0633\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062f\u0650 \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0631). From this it is evident that he regarded the present town of Rohr\u012b as forming part of Bakhar, and the channel separating the former from the island of Bakhar must have been the Khalij which he mentions. But I am totally unable to identify the place where Kashl\u016b Kh\u0101n\u2019s hospice stood. Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da says it was in the middle of the Khalij. If so, island and hospice must since have disappeared under water. There is no island in either of the channels which separate Bakhar from the mainland, but there are three\u2014one on the north, and two on the south of Bakhar\u2014\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ancient Geography of India, pp. 299, 300.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sultan Jal\u0101lu\u2019d-d\u012bn Khw\u0101razm\u012b was at D\u0113wal in 1224 (see Major Raverty\u2019s translation of the Tabak\u0101t-i-N\u0101\u1e63iri, f. 295 n.). The place appears to have been the seat of a local ruler in 1228 (Ibid, p. 615).\nwhich may be correctly described as situated in the middle of the Indus, and it was perhaps on one of these that the hospice stood.\\(^1\\)\n\nOne more point in our extract may be noticed for its geographical interest. Ibnu Bat\u016b\u1e6da passed on from Bakhar to Uchchh, and thence to Mult\u0101n. At ten miles from this last city he had to cross an unfordable stream (w\u0101d\u012b), named Khusraw-\u0101bad, where he suffered so much vexation from the proceedings of the Customs' officers. This stream must have been the old channel of the R\u0101wi in which that river was still flowing sixty-five years later, when Tim\u016br wrote thus of it: \"The united waters (of the Jh\u0113lam and Ch\u012bn\u0101b) pass below Mult\u0101n and then join the R\u0101wi.\"\\(^2\\) The name of Khusraw-\u0101bad is singular, as it implies an artificial channel. Had the R\u0101wi already begun to show symptoms of changing its course in the distant northern direction which it has since taken, and had it been restrained for a time by means of works carried out under the auspices of some local authority named Khusraw?\n\n**Note on the Situation of Jan\u0101n\u012b.**\n\nIt is possible that H\u0101l\u0101n\u012b, an old town in Pargana Kandhi\u0101ro, and 55 miles N.E. of S\u0113wan, may be Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da's Jan\u0101n\u012b. This town is situated on the left bank of the old course of the Indus mentioned in the note at the foot of p. 401. Ibnu Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da, according to his custom, gives the details of the spelling of the name, and he makes it Jan\u0101n\u012b beyond all question, but it is to be remembered that he wrote\u2014or rather dictated\u2014the account of his travels long years after he had been in Sindh, and that he had lost the papers which he had prepared in India, a fact which no doubt accounts for much that is otherwise inexplicable in his narrative.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The small island north of Bakhar, containing the shrine of Khw\u0101ja Khizr or Jind Pir (Zinda Pir), has in its mesjid what is perhaps the oldest extant Muhammedan inscription in India, dating Hijra 341 (952 A.D.). See Mr. Eastwick's article in Journal Bombay R.A.S. vol. i. p. 203.

Various writers and travellers have mentioned the sort of interesting manuscripts, relics of a former civilization, found in Formosa, such as those sent to the President of the Royal Asiatic Society by our friend and learned traveller E. Colborne Baber.\n\nDuhalde, in 1730, seventy years after the expulsion of the Dutch, speaking of the Formosan aborigines, could say \"that there are many who yet understand the Dutch language, who can read the books of the Dutch, and who in writing use their letters; many fragments of pious Dutch books are found amongst them.\"\n2. Mr. J. Thomson, the traveller and photographer, who has paid special attention to the aborigines of the island, said that some specimens of romanized Malay were still preserved by some tribes, who no longer know the writing nor the language. These documents are chiefly deeds of property, or private contracts.\n\n3. Paul Ibis, a Russian traveller, who saw much of the aborigines before 1877, says that the Sekhoan of Tchang-Hoa\\(^1\\) on the N.W. of the island, have preserved some traces of the Dutch occupation, and that some ancient books and documents are still in existence amongst them.\n\n4. In a notice on the native tribes of Formosa, written in 1874 by Mr. Steere,\\(^2\\) who travelled among them, some interesting information is given regarding such manuscripts. The author says that, among the aborigines submitted to the Chinese and established in the hills East of Tai-wan fu and Takao, the Pepohwans, he has found a number of ancient manuscripts of the old Pepohwan language with roman letters, kept preciously by their owners, though they no longer knew how to read them. The majority of these documents consisted (as is the case with the present ones) of deeds and contracts written in the old tongue, which has been given up for the Chinese language, and is nearly forgotten. Mr. Steere was able to examine twenty-one of these manuscripts and recognize that they were dated in the Chinese fashion, according to the years of the ruling Emperor, and were all of them much later than the expulsion of the Dutch. Four of them were dated during the years Yung-tcheng (1723-1736), sixteen during the years K\u2019ien-Lung (1736-1796), and one at the beginning of Kia K\u2019ing (1796); so that they come down later by 42 years than the latest of those sent by Mr. E. C. Baber and described by him in the following section.\n\n\\(^1\\) *Globus*, 1877, t. xxxi. p. 233; Girard de Rialle, *Formose et ses habitants* (a most valuable paper in *Revue d\u2019Anthropologie*, 1885, t. viii. pp. 58-77, 247-281), p. 254.\n\n\\(^2\\) *The Aborigines of Formosa*, in *China Review*, vol. iii. pp. 181-184.\nb) Note on \"Nine Formosan Manuscripts\" (by Mr. E. C. Baber).\n\n\"This is a story of the decay and death of a people, and a language, and a script; and, incidentally, of a religion.\n\nI.\n\n\"I think it was in the year 1626, or a little later, that George Candidius brought the schoolmasters into the Island. At any rate, it was about thirty years before the dreadful day when Mr. Hambroek unlocked himself from his daughter's arms and returned to the camp of the Pirate, where his wife and two young children were held as hostages. And you know how the Pirate slew him, and other captives and hostages, to the number of five hundred souls, including many schoolmasters. Nor were the women and children spared. This was in the year 1661; and very soon after this the Pirate made himself master of all the western part of the Island.\u00b9\n\n\"But although the schoolmasters were murdered or driven away, the traces of their teaching remained for a hundred years. The nine sheets which lie before you will show you how the light of their learning dwindled and flickered into utter darkness.\n\n\"I need not tell you, for you know it right well, that I am speaking of the things which happened when the Pirate Koxinga was driving the Hollanders out of Formosa. The faded writings which I send you were written by the grandchildren of the native people who sat at the feet of George Candidius and the schoolmasters.\n\nII.\n\n\"I have numbered the sheets I. to IX.\n\n\"The date of No. I. is 1735.\n\"II. ,, 1737.\n\"III. ,, 1737.\n\"IV. ,, 1740.\n\"V. ,, 1740.\n\"VI. ,, 1740.\n\"VII. ,, 1742.\n\"VIII. ,, 1746.\n\"IX. ,, 1754.\n\n\u00b9 \"The Middle Kingdom\" (Williams), vol. ii. p. 436.\n\"Let me first tell you how I make sure of this chronology. You will notice that three of these manuscripts are bilingual, being written in Chinese and in what we may conveniently call Formosan. Nos. V. and VI. are duplicates.\n\n\"In No. III. the Chinese version is dated, after the Chinese manner, 'Kienlung, 2nd year, 9th month;' and in the Formosan we find in the fourth line: 'Gianliong, 2 ni.'\n\n\"It may, therefore, be surmised that these two terms mean the same thing. And when we refer to No. V. for confirmation or contradiction, we find, in the Chinese, 'Kienlung, 5th year, 11th month,' and in the Formosan: 'Gianliong, 5 ni, 101 goj.'\n\n\"This makes the matter sure. For if you suppose that the 'eleventh month' cannot be called the 'hundred and first month,' you are wrong, as you will find anon without any prompting from me.\n\n\"Turning to the six manuscripts which are written in Formosan alone, I copy down the Formosan dates, and place opposite them the rendering which would correspond in Chinese:\n\n| No. | I. Youngsing 103 ni 2 goj | Yungching 13th yr. 2nd m. |\n|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| No. | II. Gianliong 2 ni 6 goj 104 sit Kienlung 2nd ,, 6th ,, 14th d. |\n| No. | IV. Gianliong 5 ni 10 goj | ,, 6th ,, 10th ,, |\n| No. | VII. Gianliong 7 ni 1 goj 20 sit | ,, 7th ,, 1st ,, 20th ,, |\n| No. | VIII. Gianliong 101 ni 3 goj 209 sit | ,, 11th ,, 3rd ,, 29th ,, |\n| No. | IX. Gianliong 109 ni (?) goj | ,, 19th ,, (?) ,, |\n\n\"The Emperor Yungching reigned twelve years and some months. There seems no need to adduce further argument to prove that the dates are established.\n\n\"Unhappily, the words ni, goj and sit cannot be Formosan. They are too evidently a mere transliteration of the Chinese words which, in the dialect of Amoy, mean 'year,' 'moon' and 'day.'\n\n\"However, I proceed to translate the Chinese Text of No. III.\n\n\"'Agreement by Yeh-k'uan. The native Kalung being in want of silver gives two fields as security, whereon Yeh-k'uan lends him 29 ounces 263 of silver. It is agreed that every ounce of silver is every month to bear interest of 4\n\n1 Goj should probably be written Goij, as in Modern Dutch.\"\nCandareens. The full interest must be paid up, by the 12th month. If the interest be not so paid up, the fields will be to the lender to till and to hold, without let or hindrance; and this is to be the condition year by year. The above is the free wish of both parties, and neither may raise difficulties and withdraw from it. As a verbal agreement might not be binding, this is put in writing to make the understanding clear. There is also a loan of 17 piculs and 2 bushels of rice [in husk].\n\n\"Turning to the Formosan version, and considering the first two lines, we find that the words 'Attaing Tasolladt' are common to several of the documents, and probably mean mutual agreement or something of the sort. At the end of the second line we find mention of the weight of silver, which Kalung borrowed, written thus, '209 nio lam, 2 ci, 6 ho, iii.' corresponding with 29 ounces 263 in the Chinese version.\n\n\"Here again the words 'nio,' 'ci,' and 'ho,' are transliterations of the sounds which in the dialect of Amoy, or thereabout, are equivalent to Taels, Mace and Candareens.\n\n\"Nevertheless I think we are close on the track of a veritable Formosan word. For, seeing that the term 'silver' twice occurs very early in the Chinese text, we may expect it to occur twice in the beginning of the Formosan version. And if this be true, the Formosan word for silver must be 'vanitok,' which occurs in the first line, and in the second.\n\n\"But if 'vanitok' means silver, we ought to detect the word in some of these manuscripts, with an amount, or enumeration, appended; because, in the Far East, silver is synonymous with coin, wealth, lucre, pounds, shillings and pence; money, in short.\n\n\"We find it occurring thus:\nNo. II. ki vanitok ki 206 nio . . .\nNo. III. ki vanitok Cata sa 209 nio lam, 2 ci, 6 ho, iii . . .\nNo. IV. ki vanitok ki 102 niou . . .\nNo. VII. ki vanitok tagikalangang ki 408 nio, 3 ci . . .\n\n1 Equivalent to 48 per cent. per annum.\nAnd since we know already that *nio* means ounces, and *ci* tenths of ounces, it is pretty certain that *vanitok* means 'silver.'\n\n\"Pursuing the same method, and remembering that *nio* means ounces, we are sure to find *nio* accompanied by a numeral in almost every case; much in the same way as Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, in an English deed or document, would be attended or interpolated with numerals. I proceed to put down all the instances in which the words *nio*, *ci*, etc., occur in the nine manuscripts.\n\nIn No. I. (they do not occur.)\nIn No. II. . . . Alla\u00ff ki nio tokat . . .\nIn No. II. . . . ki 206 nio . . .\nIn No. III. . . . sa 209 nio lam 2 ci . . .\nIn No. III. . . . ki 1 k inio 4 la\u00ff : . . .\nIn No. IV. . . . ki 103 niou . . .\nIn No. V. } (they do not occur, nor do the corresponding\nIn No. VI. } expressions occur in the Chinese version.)\nIn No. VII. . . . ki 408 nio 2 ci . . .\nIn No. VII. . . . ki 100102\u00b9 nio . . .\nIn No. VIII. . . . sasat kitiang ki niou togot ki sasaat ki\nniou togot ki pahpat ki si . . .\nIn No. VIII. . . . ki 1 ki niou . . .\n\n\"Here we find nine cases, in seven of which the word *nio* is preceded by an unmistakeable Arabic numeral. May we not surmise that in the remaining cases the same word is likely to be preceded by a numeral written in full?\n\n\"I cannot make anything of *allaj ki nio tokat*\u00b2 in No. II. But there can be no doubt that, in No. VIII., the passage *Sasat kitiang ki niou togot ki sasaat ki niou togot ki pahpat ki si* contains several numerals written in full. I confirm this deduction by a comparison with a passage in No. I.\u2014'10 ki sopau 2 ki sopau\u00b3 (?) 3 tau,' which means 'ten piculs and two piculs and (?) three bushels,' that is to say 'twelve piculs (?) three bushels' in all. If you will reflect on this\n\n\u00b9 This portentous sum probably means 112 ounces of silver.\n\u00b2 Compare *tokat* in No. II. with *togot* in No. VIII.\n\u00b3 We know from No. III. that *sopau* means a picul, and *tau* means a bushel. But they are probably Chinese words. Still *sopau* may be native Formosan.\ncomparison, you will derive from it the conclusion that\nkitiang means ten, and that sasaat and pahpat are numerals.\n\n\"But there is still further confirmation to be adduced.\nThese numbers were doubtless 'writ large' for the sake of\nemphasis. I pray you to take notice that they are still\nmore specially emphasized by being impressed with seals.\nThere is a seal on Kitiang. There is a seal on Sasaat. There\nis a seal on Pahpat. And the seal is not a personal seal,\nbut consists of two Chinese characters (in the square form)\n\nwhich read 'Hu F\u00eang,' and mean 'carefully stamped.' A\nsimilar seal (but not the same) occurs in No. IV. line 7,\nwhere again it is impressed upon a numeral.\\(^1\\) In all other\ncases the seals are in the ordinary Chinese character, and\nrepresent, or certify, signatures.\n\n\"Let us collect our results.\n\nVanitok is 'silver.'\nKitiang is 'ten.'\nSasaat is a numeral.\nPahpat is a numeral.\nSopau is a 'picul,' or 'a hundred pounds.'\nKillip baah\\(^2\\) is 'field.'\n\nIII.\n\n\"The problem presented to us is to discover what Formocean\ntribe now represents the folk by whom these documents were\nwritten. We want to give them a local habitation and a\nname.\n\n\\(^1\\) This seal is bilingual, one half being Chinese, in square form, with the mean-\ning 'carefully stamped'; and the other half being Manchu, but too defaced to be\nlegible.\n\n\\(^2\\) Compare kit bagh, No. II. line 6; and pagh in the middle of Nos. V. and VI.\n\u201cAn examination of the seals on some of the deeds will show that they were impressed by the \u2018Aboriginal Chiefs of Sinkiang;\u2019 that is to say, native Formosans who had been appointed by the Chinese to act as Headmen in Sinkiang. I have no map of Formosa at hand; but Sinkiang must have been an important district, and a reference to old Dutch maps of the Island would in all probability at once determine its position. A little local research would very easily discover it.\n\nIV.\n\n\u201cOf the Formosan (and obviously Malay) vocabularies given in the appendix, the first five were collected by Mr. T. L. Bullock, of H.M.\u2019s Consular Service, and Mr. J. B. Steere, of the Michigan University. The following notes are extracted from an article which Mr. Bullock contributed to the China Review (Hongkong, Aug. 1874):\n\n\u201c\u2018The tribes which speak these dialects are called by the Chinese: 1. Tsuihwan; 2. Sekhwan; 3. Buhwan; 4. Pepohwan; 5. Pelam. The vocabulary standing sixth on the list is taken from a small \u2018Dictionary of the Favorlang Dialect,\u2019 compiled in the year 1650 by G. Harpart, a Dutch missionary in Formosa. This work seems to have existed only in manuscript until the year 1840, when it was published in Batavia by W. H. Medhurst.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to remember that the island of Formosa consists of two districts; the one a level plain about twenty miles in breadth, extending along the west coast for nearly the whole length of the Island; the other a mountainous region, through the middle of which runs a high range from north to south. The level country is almost entirely occupied by Chinese, the mountains almost entirely by the uncivilized Aborigines. The civilized Aborigines are hemmed in between the two, dwelling in some places on the plain, in others on the mountains.\n\n\u201cThe Sekhwan (\u2018tame savages\u2019) are a tribe of civilized Aborigines living on the mountain-spurs east of Changhwa. To the east of these live the Buhwan, on or near the central\nrange. The Buhwan are a branch of the Chenghwan, a Chinese term which means 'wild savages.'\n\n\"The Tsuihwan ('water savages'), a very small tribe, inhabit the shores of a lake a day's journey inside the mountains N.E. from Kagee\u00b9 and S.E. from Changhwa.\n\n\"The Chinese term 'Pepohwan' ('savages of the plain') is applied to all the civilized Aborigines living near the mountains in the southern part of the Island. The one name includes a number of ancient tribes which were formerly distinct, and spoke separate dialects. At the present time, however, Chinese is the language used by all; but most of the dialects may be learnt from old people who spoke them when young, and still remember them. The tribe which used the dialect given in the list lives some 25 miles east of Changhwa.\n\n\"The Pelam are a tribe of wild Aborigines inhabiting the east coast in about the latitude of Takow.\n\n\"The position which the Favorlang tribe occupied is doubtful.\"\n\nV.\n\n\"I should like to have added to this list a vocabulary of the Formosan dialect which George Psalmanazar spoke so fluently. Do you not think it very possible that he may have fallen across a vocabulary of one of these dialects, written by a Dutch missionary, and have learnt it by rote? It has always been supposed that George invented a language, but is not the theory which I suggest more probable? It would be interesting to re-examine the question under this light.\n\nVI.\n\n\"I now place the words which I have identified over against the corresponding words in Mr. Bullock's Vocabularies.\n\n| Tsuihwan | Sekhwan | Buhwan | Pepohwan | Pelam | Favorlang |\n|----------|---------|--------|----------|-------|-----------|\n| Silver   | Vanitok | Tsui   | Pilah    | Pilat | Manituk   |\n| One      | Sasaat  | Taha   | Adadamat | Kial  | Sasaab    |\n| Eight    | Pahpat  | Kaspat | Hasubituru | M\u00fcssupat | Pipa     |\n| Ten      | Kitiang | Maksin | Issit    | Nahal | Keteng   |\n\n\u00b9 For the positions of Kagee and Changhwa, see \"Handy and Royal Atlas,\" W. & A. K. Johnston, 1881, Map 29.\n\"You will not hesitate to select the Pepohwan. But before proving that your choice is justified, I write out the translation of No. V.\n\n\"'Agreement of the Aborigines Sijih and Takalung. Whereas Takalung and Sijih have had a dispute about a certain field [or fields], a warrant has been issued for the Interpreter and Chiefs to try the case; and the Interpreter and Chiefs have now deliberated and decided. Sijih and Takalung will accordingly transfer the fields, in compliance with the original agreement, to Tikalung to till and to hold. As regards the charge brought by Takalung about the loss of cattle, he also accepts the advice of the Interpreter and Chiefs, and drops the lawsuit. Except as regards the three\u00b9 Dollars (?), what Sijih says about borrowing money from Ta-mi-lou on the security of family property, is not within the knowledge of Takalung. In case Ta-mi-lou may hereafter raise difficulties, Sijih will hold himself responsible. To this arrangement both parties hereby consent, and will never raise objection. A joint amicable agreement, executed in duplicate, each party holding one copy in proof.'\n\n\"In the Formosan version of this document, Tonghso is merely the Chinese word for 'an interpreter.' It is tempting to surmise that Lohang, if this be the true lection, means 'cattle,' and is equivalent to Loang in Mr. Bullock's Vocabulary; and that Masosoo means 'to state,' or 'to declare,' or what not, corresponding to the Pepohwan Masasuu = 'Talk.' But these are mere ex-post-facto guesses, and should not be accepted without more rigorous proof.\n\nVII.\n\n\"Two years or more ago, at a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, Lord Aberdare drew attention to the interest which attaches to certain manuscripts known to be in the possession of the Formosan aborigines; and it was this remark which prompted the Rev. William Campbell, of Taiwan, to send me these nine deeds from Formosa,\n\n\u00b9 From an inspection of the stamps or seals, I am inclined to think that the words San yuan, translated 'three dollars,' should be regarded as a proper name.\nwhere he had discovered them. I speedily wrote to him, begging him to furnish me with precise particulars; and especially to tell me where he found them. It was not until after I had made the identifications above described that he very kindly supplied me with the following notes:\n\n\"The documents were obtained by me during the first week of July [presumably in 1884] at one of the villages in the low-lying hill region eastward from Taiwanfoo . . . . I wished to make sure that full advantage would be taken of those documents for throwing whatever light they could upon the language and ethnographical place of the people to whom they were once intelligible; because the Pepohwan tribe from whom they were obtained have now lost all knowledge of the language represented in those documents. They removed inland to their present settlements about eighty years ago, their own ancestral region being what was known during the Dutch occupation as the Township of Sinkkan, a name still preserved in the large Chinese market town of Sin-kang, about 20 li (say seven miles) N.N.E. of the city of Taiwanfoo. They are exclusively an agricultural people; and in regard to language, religion, dress and customs, differ now in almost no respect from the neighbouring Chinese. They have decidedly much less force of character than the Chinaman; and some years ago, after an elaborate investigation, one of our Mission Doctors came to the conclusion that they were far from being a prolific race. It was, moreover, chiefly among this tribe that the Dutch carried on that largely successful Christianizing and educational work of which not a single trace can be found at the present day. I should certainly wish to see some attempt made to solve this sadly interesting problem. During the Dutch rule, over 30 Christian Pastors laboured, and over 6000 of the natives were baptized on the profession of faith in our Saviour; but nowhere, in North, South, East or West Formosa, have I ever met with even a distinctively Christian tradition amongst the Aborigines.\"\n\n\"The tale has grown too sad for me to seek in it any me, or any delight. It is a tale of a people which has\nlost its religion, its estate, its nationality, its language, and almost the recollection of its identity. And perhaps it gave away the last record of its traditions when it parted with these nine ragged memorials of its ruin.\n\n\"E. Colborne Baber.\n\n\"Se-ul in Corea, 1 Jan. 1886.\"\n\nc) Remarks on the Nine Manuscripts.\n\n5. These manuscripts are various, and many of them are stamped with seals of the officials. It is not without interest to examine them. The first, dated Tsung sing 1:3 ni 2 goij esi 10 sit, otherwise yung tcheng, 13 year 2 month 10 day, i.e. our 5th March, 1735, bears no stamps. It consists only of eight lines of text, with the single solitary names of four (contracting) parties, whose names, written by the scribe, are followed by four marks made by the parties themselves. Then comes the date and two names (of witnesses?), preceded respectively by the words takalang and vagikalang.\n\n6. The second, reproduced on Plate II., is dated Gianliong 2 ni 6 goij 104 sit, otherwise Kienlung, 2 year, 6 month, 14 day, corresponding to our 12th July, 1737. It consists of 15 lines of text, followed by 27 names and the date. Of the names, all written by the scribe, 19 are double, and all but one followed by a mark made by the party named; the 16th and 19th are finger marks, showing that the party, unable to hold a pen, had to put the tip of his finger into the ink in order to impress his mark. Six other names are single, four of which are accompanied by the seal of the party in Chinese characters. The first of them is Sarday, whose seal reads Sin kiang t'u kwan San tai tu ki, otherwise 'seal of San-tai (Sarday), local official of Sinkiang.'\n\nThe second single name taraya has no seal; but the third, which is somewhat difficult to read tarragi, is accompanied\n\n1 \u4e09\u65b0\n\u81fa\u6e2f\n\u571f\u5b98\u8a18\n\"interpreter\" tohng so (instead of thong so), and on the duplicate (six), in the corresponding passage, he has written tongh so!\n\n2) Sin Kiang tu kwan She Kan ki, which has appeared also on the second MS., but in this case it belongs to the same man rokal. The r is doubtful, as on the first occasion.\n\n3) Sin Kiang tsin king t'u kwan san yuen ki si, which also was stamped on No. II., but there is in the present case no name like that of tarragi, next to which it was affixed in the first MS.\n\n4) Sin Kiang t'u kwan san tai tu ki, also stamped on MS. II. for an individual named Sardaj, whose name appears also in this case without variance of spelling.\n\n5) Sin Kiang shai t'u kwan ta ki li tu ki, or \"Seal of Ta-k'i-li, native official of Sin Kiang hamlet.\" His name is written Dakilis.\n\n6) A small seal, half Chinese half Mandshu, defaced and unreadable.\n\n10. The seventh MS., though written on the same sized paper, is shorter than the others. It is unilingual, and consists of only six lines of text, six names of individuals, accompanied by their own marks, one of them being a finger print, and the date: Gianlioung 7 ni 1 goj 20 sit, otherwise 27th March, 1742, of our calendar.\n\n11. The eighth MS., also unilingual, is much longer as text than the preceding. It consists of sixteen lines of writing, including twelve proper names, arranged by fours, each with their own marks, and the date Gianlioung 101 ni 7 goj 209 sit, or \"Kien-lung 11 year 7 month 29 day,\" otherwise 15th Sept., 1745. It bears seven stamps of two seals.\n\n1) Square, and in square character, and read by E. C. Baber Hu-feng, is repeated five times in the text.\n\n1 \u5927\u65b0\u6e2f\u793e\u5947\u529b\u5716\u8a18\n2) Sin Kiang shai t'u kwan Ti-ka-lioung tu ki,\\(^1\\) or \"Seal of Tikalung, local official of Sinkiang hamlet.\" Tikalung is the representative of the native name Digikalang.\n\n12. The ninth MS. is also unilingual, and has no other seal-marks than two half stamps, so badly impressed that they cannot be read. There are altogether 12 lines of writing, including the date, Gianliong 509 ni ? sit 4? goy; the figures are doubtful, except those of the year, which corresponds to our 1754.\n\nc) Two similar manuscripts in the British Museum.\n\n13. When I spoke of the above-described MSS. to my friend Professor R. K. Douglas, of the British Museum, he remembered having heard that some MSS. from Formosa presented to the National Collection of Bloomsbury had been laid aside because their genuineness had not been ascertained. He inquired about the matter, and we found together, in the limbo where they were buried, two MSS. exactly similar in kind to the nine MSS. sent by Consul Colborne Baber. These two MSS. are stamped as presented to the British Museum on the 25th May, 1876. They are unilingual, but are stamped severally with the red seals of the Chinese and native officials, and both belong to the Kien-lung period, like those described by E. C. Baber, but their seals are very interesting.\n\n14. The first is dated Gianliong 20 ni 5 goey 209 jit, or Kien-lung, 20th year, 5th month, 29th day, corresponding to the 29th June, 1755, of our era. It contains a long text in the native language occupying 28 lines.\n\nIt is stamped with six seals in Chinese, as follows:\n\n1) T'ing (placed as head-title of the seal). Then in perpendicular columns as usual: Sin Kiang she t'ung she T'ung yu\n\n\\(^1\\) \u5f1f\u65b0\u6e2f\u52a0\u5f04\u793e\u5716\u8a18\u5b98\nki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of T'ung yu, interpreter of Sin Kiang hamlet.\"\n\n2) T'ing. Sin Kiang sh\u00ea An-kung An-Liu t'u ki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of An-liu Ankung of Sinkiang hamlet.\"\n\n3) T'ing. Sin kiang sh\u00ea an-kung mi-t'ou ki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of Mi-t'ou Ankung of Sinkiang hamlet.\"\n\n4) T'ing. Sin kiang sh\u00ea t'u-muk wu kia ki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of Wu kia, t'u-muk of Sinkiang hamlet.\" T'u-muk is a title, as we shall see hereafter.\n\n5) T'ing. An-kung siao-ta-li-hu (?) t'u ki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of Siao-ta-li-hu (the) Ankung.\"\n\n6) T'ing. Sin kiang sh\u00ea t'u-muk Hia Nan ma t'u ki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of Hia-nam-ma, t'u-muk of Sinkiang hamlet.\"\n\n15. The second MS. in the British Museum is dated Guian-liong 303 ni 3 goy, otherwise in the third month of the thirty-third year Kien-lung, corresponding to our April-May, 1768. It bears seven stamps of seals, only five of which are different, as follows:\n\n1) Hien tching t'ang. Sin kiang sh\u00ea t'u-muk. T'ing. Siao kia mei t'u ki, i.e. \"District Magistrate Hall. Reception Hall of the t'u-muk of Sinkiang hamlet. Seal of Siao-kia-mei.\" Twice stamped.\n2) T'ing. Sin kiang sh\u00ea An-kung Tcheng Li ho t'u ki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of Tcheng Li-ho, the t'u-muk of Sinkiang hamlet.\"\n\n3) T'ing. Sin kiang sh\u00ea An-kung Lin san yuen t'u ki, i.e. \"Reception Hall. Seal of Lin-san-yuen, the An-kung of Sinkiang hamlet.\" Stamped three times.\n\n4) Hien tching t'ang. Sin kiang sh\u00ea t'u-muk To mao ? tu ki, i.e. \"District Magistrate Hall. Seal of To-mao ? a t'u-muk of Sinkiang hamlet.\"\n\n5) Is partly defaced or badly stamped. Only a part of it can be read. Tching t'ang ? Sin kiang sh\u00ea t'ung she ? ? ? tu ki, i.e., \"Magistrate Hall ? Seal ? ? ? interpreter of Sinkiang hamlet.\"\n\nd) Information Derived from the Seals.\n\n16. Some interesting information about the Chinese settlements and management in the island, and their influence on the aboriginal tribes, may be derived from an examination of the 20 seals above deciphered, if taken in connection with their respective dates.\n\n17. As to the geography, Sin-kiang, or better Sin-Kang, 'New port,' is the place where all the MSS. were stamped, and probably also drafted. Only one other name, Tsin king, or better Chin-keng, appears in one case, and, as it is coupled with Sin-kang which precedes it, we may infer that it was a dependency or subdivision of the same territory. Its local officer is called san-yuen, a name which appears again as that\n\n| \u912d\u65b0\u7406\u6e2f\u9db4\u793e\u5716\u6848\u8a18\u516c | \u5ef3 | \u5802\u6b63\u7e23 | \u5802\u6b63 |\n|-------------------|----|--------|------|\n| \u912d\u65b0\u7406\u6e2f\u9db4\u793e\u5716\u6848\u8a18\u516c | \u5ef3 | \u5802\u6b63\u7e23 | \u5802\u6b63 |\n| \u912d\u65b0\u7406\u6e2f\u9db4\u793e\u5716\u6848\u8a18\u516c | \u5ef3 | \u5802\u6b63\u7e23 | \u5802\u6b63 |\n\n5 As in Amoy.\n6 Like the preceding.\n7 On seal No. 2, year 1737, in the second MS. Also stamped on the v. vi. MSS. of 1741.\nof a more important official in 1768,\u00b9 a relation of the first or perhaps his son, if not himself, as he appears 31 years afterwards. Sin-kang, the Rev. William Campbell says,\u00b2 was known during the Dutch occupation as the township of Sinkkan,\u00b3 a name still preserved in the large Chinese market town of Sin-Kang, about seven miles N.N.E. of the city of Tai-wan fu. Sin-kang is called a \u793e sh\u00e8,\u2074 or better sia,\u2075 which, says Wells Williams, means in Formosa \u2018a clan or tribe, living in a place or collection of hamlets.\u2019\u2076\n\n18. In the earlier MSS. of the collection, namely, in all those sent by Mr. Colborne Baber, the Sinicisation had not advanced to the stage attained when the later MSS. of the British Museum were written. At first, i.e. from 1737-1746, the titles of the officials were as follows:\n\n1) T'u kwan \u571f\u5b98, literally \u2018Local magistrates,\u2019 four of which existed in the Sin-kang territory, as shown by their stamps on the MS. ii. and v.-vi.\u2077 On the latter, one only is different from the former; the T'u kwan Takami of 1737 was probably deceased when the v.-vi. was framed, i.e. in 1741, and the seal of a T'u kwan Takili appears in his stead. In 1746 (MS. viii.)\u2078 only one T'u kwan named Tikalung in Chinese, Dagikalang in the native language, an instance which shows that the presence of the four T'u kwan was not required for the binding of a contract.\u2079 As it is written in the same language as the preceding, and as the stamp bears like the others the name of Sin-kiang, there is no probability that it was written somewhere else.\n\n2) An-kung, in Chinese\u00b9\u2070 \u6848\u516c, or \u2018Pacifying Prince,\u2019 was a more important official than the T'u kwan. It occurs only\n\n\u00b9 On seal No. 18.\n\u00b2 Vid. above, E. C. Baber's note on Nine Formosan Manuscripts.\n\u00b3 Dr. O. Dapper, Gedenkwaardig bedrijf der Nederlandsche Oost Indische Maatschappij in China, Amst., 1670, mentions: Sinkkam, Tanakam, Beklawan, Soelang, Mattou, Tiverang, Fovorlang, Takkeis, Tornap, Tcrenip, and Assoek.\n\u2074 On seals No. 3, 8, 9.\n\u2075 As in Amoy. In current Chinese it means a hamlet, a parish; originally it was the altars of the gods of the land.\n\u2076 Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language, p. 748.\n\u2077 On seals No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.\n\u2078 Vid. seal No. 9.\n\u2079 As might be inferred from the MSS. ii., v.-vi.\n\u00b9\u2070 On seal 6; MS. ii. (1737).\nonce, and that on the MS. ii., which required the stamp of all the officials of the country. The 'An-kung' in that case was not a Chinaman, but simply a native, as shown by his name. It is curious that in the data of Portuguese origin (as we shall see hereafter), made use of by Psalmanazar, we find the same title An-kung under the form 'Angon,' meaning king.\\(^1\\)\n\nBesides the two preceding sorts of officials, there was\u2014\n\n3) The T'ung she \u901a\u4e8b, or 'interpreter,' whose seal occurs on MS. ii. and v.-vi. of 1737 and 1741.\\(^2\\)\n\n19. The MSS. of 1755 and 1768 show by their seals a decided advance in the settlements. The Chinese influence is strongly felt, though neither of the two MSS. exhibit a Chinese translation, as was the case with the MSS. iii. and v.-vi. of the years 1737 and 1741. The seals have been improved. In the MS. of 1755 every one of them bears as a sort of head title the character t'ing, which means a 'hall, a court, a place where cases are heard,' and by extension 'the officer in his court.'\\(^3\\)\n\nThe T'ung-she, or 'Interpreter,' is still one of those whose seals appears on the MS., and also the An-kung; but the latter are more numerous, and two different officials bearing that title have put their stamps on the MS. of 1755. On the other hand, the t'u-kwan have disappeared, and in their stead the title T'u-muk \u571f\u76ee,\\(^4\\) which may be translated 'Local overseers,' occurs on three stamps of the same MS.\n\nOn the MS. of 1768, the change is still greater, and it is easy to see that the thirteen years which elapsed between its date and that of the preceding, were not lost to Chinese influence.\n\nThe seals of two T'u-muk occur on the deed, and bear\\(^5\\) as head title Hien tching t'ang, or 'District magistrate hall,' implying the creation by the Chinese Government of a hien\n\n---\n\n1 Vid. below \u00a7 70.\n2 On seal No. 5 (MS. ii.), stamped also on MSS. v.-vi., cf. the remarks above \u00a7 6 and below \u00a7 70.\n3 Wells Williams, o.c., p. 906.\n4 In Corean tumak is a head man, a sort of mayor in the villages.

Two 'An-kungs,' with their seals, headed only by T'ing, as on the MS. of 1755,\u00b9 are also stamped there, and this shows that they were native officials under the jurisdiction of the T'u-muk Chinese officials of higher grade. The interpreter has also put his seal on the deed, and it seems that his post has increased in importance; the stamp shows that a special residence was officially provided for him, but the third sign of the head-title is obliterated, and cannot be properly deciphered; the first two characters are Tching t'ang,\u00b2 which alone imply the meaning we have expressed.\n\nII. THE WRITTEN CHARACTERS, \u00a7\u00a7 20-27.\n\n20. All these manuscripts are written in Roman characters\u00b3 presenting casually a strange perversion of their original shapes. It was the writing, more or less altered in the mean time, which had been taught to the natives during the Dutch occupation of the Island. The more recent of these, MSS. 1796, shows that this writing was still in use at the time, without having lost too much of its characteristics. However, it gradually faded away, and some imperfect copies, such as would be attempted when copying an unknown writing, are occasionally met with in the island.\n\n21. Lorenzo Hervas in his celebrated Catalogo\u2074 (1784) states that the inhabitants of Formosa possess an alphabet of their own, written, like the Chinese characters, in vertical columns placed from right to left.\u2075 This inexact statement has probably arisen from a combination of two former statements; one about the real existence of an indigenous alphabet in the island, as we shall see hereafter; the other\n\n\u00b9 On seals No. 17 and 18.\n\u00b2 On seal No. 20.\n\u00b3 Dr. H. Kern has favoured me, since the above was written, with the following remarks: \"The writing as well as the spelling recalls the Dutch way of writing in the seventeenth century, as might be expected. We find amongst other proofs the same propensity to use k and c promiscuously in some cases, e.g., matictic and matiklik; the \u0177 with dots, etc. It is not a little interesting to find that the Formosan had in 1737 not yet forgotten the lessons of their Dutch teachers.\" (Leiden, 6 Nov. 1886.)\n\u2074 Catalogo della lingue conosciute e notizia della loro affinita e diversita.\n\u2075 Adrien Balbi, Atlas Ethnographique du Globe, n. 397.\nconcerning the use by the natives of the Chinese characters, as shown by several of the MSS. described above.\n\nPsalmazar, the author of the well-known fictitious description of Formosa\\(^1\\) in 1704, has given in that work an alphabet of sixteen letters, composed of twenty-one characters. It has been generally and wrongly supposed that these were nothing more than another freak of his imagination, like the palaces, altars, costumes, and moneys,\\(^2\\) which figure in his book. But he must be acquitted of this accusation, as we shall see directly.\n\n22. Amongst the splendid collection of printing types of the Imperial and Royal Printing Office at Vienna, is a Formosan alphabet,\\(^3\\) composed of sixteen letters with five variants, making twenty-one altogether, whose genuineness has been doubted because it is exactly similar to that given by Psalmazar. An enquiry at Vienna\\(^4\\) elicited the fact that the twenty-one types have been cut especially for the Alo\u00efs Auers\u2019sche Vaterunser Sammlung, which this celebrated establishment printed in 1847, and taken by the compilers from the collection of Pater noster made by Benjamin Schulze in 1748.\\(^5\\) Reference made to the splendid work of Auer, I find there, besides the alphabet, two versions of the Pater noster in Roman characters, No. 205, beginning with Diam-eta ka tu rullum, \u201cFather-our who in heaven,\u201d borrowed from the Katechism published at Delft in 1645 by Rob. Junius,\\(^6\\) and No. 206, beginning with Rama-jan ka itou Touonnoun, borrowed from the sideic Formulier of Dan. Gravius in 1662.\\(^7\\) In the well-known work of Benjamin Schulze, published in 1748, there is a special plate giving the Formosan Pater noster in this very same alphabet written from right to left in horizontal columns. Reading it, I find the beginning to be Diam-eta, etc., which proves to be that of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa, London, 1704, 8vo.\n\n\\(^2\\) Some of them are Japanese, badly figured.\n\n\\(^3\\) Alfabete des Gesamten Erdkreises aus der K.

Junius' version.\u00b9 This might suggest that the text in this character was given by Junius, and therefore would establish the authority of the alphabet on a better footing, inasmuch as Psalmanazar, who was not acquainted with the work of Junius, made by himself a spurious version of the prayer, which he would have written in the so-called Formosan character, should this alphabet have been invented by him. But there are difficulties in the way. The text (from Junius) in Roman, and that in the foreign character, disagree in a few points, while they agree all through in dividing wrongly the original text. It happens several times that a new sentence or line begins with words, belonging to the previous one, which ought to have been left with the line above. Benjamin Schulze's authority for the text in Roman character is John Chamberlayne (Orat. Dominic. cl\u00fc ling.), who in his turn refers to some letters of Job Ludolph, which I have not seen. Unhappily I have not the means of verifying the fact in the book of Junius itself, as it does not exist in any of the libraries to which I have access.\u00b2\n\n23. The order of the alphabet, as we have it, is peculiar; it is neither Semitic nor Indian, and the squareness of the shapes, like those of a monumental writing, is remarkable. It runs thus in the Vienna collection with the exception of the letters s, x, z and f, and therefore was simply espied from the same source as Psalmanazar, if not from Psalmanazar himself:\n\n| I | a | y | b | \u0399 | d |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| J | m | h, ch | s |\n| U | n | p | E | e |\n| \u039f | t | k, c | f |\n| \u0393 | l | o | Q | r |\n| s | i, y | T | g, j |\n| \u0394 | \u00fc, u, v, w | x | : pause |\n\n\u00b9 In Auers'sche Vaterunser Sammlung, the last words are mikagna. Amen; while in the text in character the words are mikakna. Amen.\n\n\u00b2 The title of this scarce little book is given in Adelung's Mithridates, i. 578, thus: \"Soulat i A.B.C. u.s.f. Katechismus in Formosanischer-Sprache d. Rob. Junius, Delft, 1645, im. 12, s. 24.\"\nIn Schulze's *Orientalische und Occidentalische Sprachmeister*, the full alphabet of twenty letters is given, each having three forms which differ only in the case of eight letters.\n\nThe similarities presented by these characters with other alphabets are ill-defined. First we must observe that the multiplicity of forms in the case of several sounds, such as \\( t \\), \\( h \\) or \\( ch \\), and \\( p \\), recalls the similar phenomenon in some of the Indonesian alphabets, contractions of former ones more rich than was required by the phonetic wants of the languages to the rendering of which they have been applied. The Formosan alphabet so called presents only faint and perhaps occasional affinities with the Ylocana of the Philippines, and also with the Arabic character, while greater and more numerous similarities are met with in the square Pali characters of Burma. But these latter similarities are not such as could be expected in an alphabet of regular derivation or descent, and do not exist for more than half of the letters.\n\n24. Therefore there are *ipso facto* reasons for believing that the adaptation of the Formosan alphabet is not a fact of simple transmission and intercourse. Add to this, the Semitic direction of the writing in horizontal lines from right to left, contrary to the practice of the Indian alphabets. The mere statement of the fact suggests an hypothesis which is perhaps a right hit at the solution of the problem, inasmuch as it would imply somewhat a repetition of a curious event which has happened elsewhere. The Gabali Tana, the modern alphabet of the Maldives, which is said to have been introduced when these islands were reconquered by the Mohammedans from the Portuguese,\\(^1\\) is composed of the fine Arabic ciphers followed apparently by the old Telugu-Tanarese numerals.\\(^2\\) If such an adaptation has been made in the Maldives by the Mohammedan traders, why should not another sort of adaptation have been made by the same people in Indonesia, and imported to Formosa?\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. A. Gray, *The Maldive Islands, with a Vocabulary taken from Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard de Laval, 1602\u20131607*, in J. R. A. S. Vol. X. pp. 173\u2013209.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Dr. Isaac Taylor, *The Alphabet*, vol. ii. pp. 357\u2013358.\nlatter case the adaptation should have included a good number of Indian letters, and the process of making the alphabet would explain the similarities as well as the divergences.\n\n25. I am not aware that the matter has been investigated by any of the scholars who have made researches about Formosan matters in particular, nor by those who have made alphabets and writings their special line of study. It seems to me, however, that the question, which requires some more elucidation, is worth the attention of future travellers and inquirers. The existence of the writing appears to be a fact. In his Official Report for 1871, Mr. Chas. W. Le Gendre, United States Consul at Amoy and Formosa, states that he had in his hands documents from the Baksa tribes, twenty-eight miles east of Ta-kao, written in foreign characters. The statement looks as if the said documents were completely written in a native writing. If they had been written in Chinese or in Roman characters, Mr. Le Gendre would not have used the expression \"foreign characters.\"\n\n26. On the other hand, Mr. G. Taylor, in his interesting notes on the Aborigines of Formosa, chiefly of the South, published last year, has disclosed a curious reference to writing in the traditions of the Amias, on the East coast down to South Cape. This people say that their ancestors were the crew of a large ship wrecked on the coast, an event which must have happened a long time ago, as they appear to have been a local tribe in Formosa for several hundred years. They have a vague idea of lands and peoples, where intercourse is carried on by means other than vocal language. \"This,\" says Mr. G. Taylor, \"is the only trace in South Formosa of any original idea of writing. Some state that the principal chief had manuscripts or books in his possession; but he has denied this to several Chinese. Still the denial might have been caused by a fear that the inquirers might wish to deprive him of them.\"\u00b9\n\n27. On several of the MSS. sent by Mr. Colborne Baber, and\n\n\u00b9 Cf. G. Taylor The Aborigines of Formosa, in China Review, vol. xiv. p. 198. Also my article A Native Writing in Formosa (the Academy, 9th April, 1887).\non one of those in the British Museum, some native witnesses and parties in the contracts have appended some isolated signs next to their names written by the scribes in the Roman and Chinese characters. I had at first some hope that these various signs might prove related to this writing, and be monograms like those made use of by the Ainu; but a close examination has convinced me that they are nothing of the kind. They have no regular connection, as characters of a writing would have, with the written names; they are simply fancy marks made by illiterate people, and are not related to the alphabet we have had under consideration. We leave the matter unsolved, with the hope that further research in the island will help to the solution.\n\nIII. Ethnology, \u00a7\u00a7 28-59.\n\na) From Chinese Sources.\n\n28. Besides the entries in the annals concerning the great Liu-Kiu, there are in Chinese literature a few special works on Formosa. The most important is the Tai-wan fu tchi \u53f0\u7063\u5e9c\u5fd7, a topography of that portion of the island belonging to the Chinese empire. The first edition by Kao Kung-kien was finished in 1694, not many years after the territory had been subdued; a second appeared in 1741 by Lin Liang-pih, in twenty books. The most recent edition is by Luh-shih-tsih, a Mandchu, and Fan Hien, in twenty-five books, which were completed in 1747. Besides the usual statistical details generally given in the Chinese topographies, it contains an account of the various races who have inhabited the island from ancient time up to the present day.\n\nLuh-shih-tsih published also a short account of the customs of the aborigines on the island, with the title Fan sh\u00ea ts\u2019ai fung t\u2019u K\u2019ao t\u2019ih lioh \u756a\u793e\u91c7\u98a8\u5716\u8003\u6458\u7567.\n\n---\n\n1 Nos. v. vi. vii. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, above.\n2 Cf. My Beginnings of Writing, i. 37.\n3 Shwoh lin collection, Bk. 28. These three works are noticed in A. Wylie\u2019s Notes on Chinese Literature, pp. 52, 34, 48.\nA brief description of the institutions, customs, and geography of the island, *Tai-wan Ki lioh* \u81fa\u7063\u7d00\u7565, was written by Lin K\u2019ien-kwang after the subjugation of the famous Koxinga, in 1684.\n\n*Tai-wan tsah Ki* \u81fa\u7063\u96dc\u8a18,\u00b9 Miscellanies about Formosa, is a very short and unimportant memoir written by Ki K\u2019i-kwang.\n\n29. Shall we mention also an illustrated album of some twenty-four water-colour pictures, about the habits and customs of the aborigines submitted to the Chinese rule? It is called *Tai-wan Fan tze t\u2019u* \u81fa\u7063\u756a\u5b50\u5716 \u2018Illustrations of the foreigners of T\u2019ai-wan,\u2019 and is interesting to look at as it displays a *couleur locale* which is not without merit. The copy I have on my table, the only one I have ever seen, belongs to my friend Mr. William Lockhart, formerly of Peking.\n\n30. The *Kin ting Tai-wan Ki lioh* \u6b3d\u5b9a\u81fa\u7063\u7d00\u7565, which must also be mentioned here, is an account in seventy books of the subjugation of the island, drawn up in compliance with an imperial rescript issued in 1778.\u00b2 And we must not forget in our enumeration the monographs concerning Formosa, which are part of one or the other of the great geographical collections and cyclop\u00e6dias, such as that which was translated by Klaproth in 1822, *Tai tsing y tung tchi*, and which goes by the usual and modern name of Tai-wan.\n\n31. In the great geography of the Ming dynasty,\u00b3 and in the Annals of the time\u2074 after 1430, Formosa appears under the name of *Ki lung shan* \u96de\u7c60\u5c71 \u2018Mountain of Kilung,\u2019 still the name of a post on the Northern coast. Tai-wan is mentioned in the Ming Annals after 1620, as a place of *Ki-lung shan* where the red-haired barbarians settled.\u2075\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Same collection and book as the preceding.

Bretschneider, *Chinese intercourse with the countries of Central and Western Asia in the fifteenth century*.\nShould we trust the *Tchung shan she kien*,\u00b9 the name of *Kilung* or a similar one was known as early as the Sui dynasty, and was given to the country by the Chinese envoy who fancied its appearance on the sea was that of \"dragon unicorn,\" *Kiu lung* \u9f8d, whence the appellative of *Liu Kiu* \u6d41\u866c \"flowing dragon.\" The story looks much like a spurious explanation adapting the real circumstances to its purpose, a feat in the accomplishment of which the Chinese mind is most clever, and has sometimes displayed a wonderful power of ingenuity and opportunism. We may see in this appellative *Kiu-lung*, compared to the *Kilung* named above, as many attempts at rendering in Chinese significant characters of appropriate phonetic values an indigenous name, or at least a name imported or not existing there previous to the Chinese expedition.\n\n32. We find that the first Dutch Governor of Taiwan, Pieter Nuyts, writing in 1629, in his report records that \"the island of Formosa, where the settlement or Fort of the Company is situated, is called *Pockan* by the Chinese.\"\u00b2 A modern authority says that *Pak-an* is the indigenous name of the island. We have no Chinese authority to adduce in favour of the statement of the Dutch Governor, nor have we met any other allusion to the indigenous name just quoted.\u00b3 Now the *Paican* on the South-west coast were the first indigenous people with whom the Dutch came into contact.\u2074 Perhaps *Pockan* and *Pak-an* are simply variants of their name, which was at first looked upon, as is often the case, as the name of the island.\n\n33. The Formosans were included by the Chinese ethnographers among the *Tung Fan*, at Amoy *Tong huan* \u6771\u756a, or\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 \u4e2d\u5c71\u4e16\u9451; L. de Rosny, *Les peuples Orientaux connus des Anciens Chinois*, p. 82.

We cannot expect from Chinese sources early direct information about Formosa. The island stands opposite to the coasts of Fuhkien, a region on which, until the Tsin dynasty, i.e. the fifth century, the Chinese had scarcely any hold.\\(^5\\) It is from the north through their early relations with Japan that they heard for the first time, and rather loosely, of the great island as one of those belonging to the elongated line of island groups extending southwards from Corea and Japan to the Philippines. These early statements, which date from the third century, are interesting by their age and by the peculiar importance given therein to races of short men, i.e. of Negrito race, and cognate to the substratum of the population of Japan, to which the present race is indebted for their small size and several features of their language; they were also the very negritos which formed one of the\n\n\\(^1\\) Sheng-fan in Mandarin Chinese.\n\\(^2\\) Shuk-fan in M.C.\n\\(^3\\) Ping-pu-fan in M.C.\n\\(^4\\) Ya-fan in M.C.\n\\(^5\\) They had tried to conquer it about 109 B.C., but they were compelled to retire, and leave the aborigines in possession.

Recent anthropological researches have shown that this small and short race, pure or mixed, spread on sea from the south-east of New Guinea to the Andaman Islands, from Sumatra, Java, Timor, etc., to Japan. And on the mainland it spread from Eastern China, Annam and Malacca peninsula to the West of India beyond the Indus, and from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas.\n\n35. A later information which we have on the subject in Chinese sources dating from A.D. 606, is found in the Dynastic history of the Sui (581\u2013618 A.D.), under the heading of Liu-Kiu,\u00b2 which was the general designation of all the islands east of the Chinese coasts and south of Japan. Formosa, the largest of all, was visited by an expedition in the above-named year. The report of the expedition was the basis of the notice\u00b3 on the island, and from there we learn that the tribes of the south were different in customs, if not otherwise from those located further to the north. By the latter we must understand the tribes occupying the region of and around the modern Taiwan in the south-western part of the island, opposite to the Peng-hu or Pescadores Islands. These tribes had sunken eyes and long noses,\u2074 something like the Hu\u2075 people, says the author. The general sent by the Chinese Emperor was called Tchen Ling. \u201cHe had taken with him some men from the southern states, and among them, what is important for us as we shall see directly, he had taken Kuen-lun men to explain and disseminate what he had to say. Some of them went forward and explained his orders. But the Liu-Kiu people did not listen to them, and rebelled against the\n\n\u00b9 This important fact, of which I publish the proof in another paper, *The Negritos in China*, was not known to Prof. De Quatrefages when he wrote his valuable papers on the great extension of this small race.\n\u00b2 The identification of the Chinese Liu Kiu with Formosa was first made by Prof. d\u2019Hervey de St. Denys in *Journal Asiatique*, Ao\u00fbt-Septembre, 1874, Mai-Juin, 1875: *Sur Formose et les \u00eeles appel\u00e9es en Chinois Lieou-Kieou*.\n\u00b3 *Sui shu in Tai ping yu lan Cyclopedia* of 983 A.D., k. 784, ff. 6-7.\n\u2074 \u5165\u6df1\u76ee\u9577\u9f3b\u985e\u65bc\u80e1\u4eba.\n\u2075 The name in Chinese literature of the races non-Mongoloid in type of Central Asia.\nmandarin army. Then Tchen Ling advanced speedily to their capital city, fought and defeated them, destroyed their palaces and houses, made several thousand men and women prisoners, and then returned.\"\u00b9\n\n36. During the previous year, an unsuccessful expedition had resulted in the bringing over to the mainland one native man prisoner, from whom they got apparently some information which led them to select the sort of men whom they wished to join the expedition. This small though not unimportant event for the future was carefully reported in the official records of the ruling dynasty, the Sui. When brought to court, this man wore his native cuirass, which was seen by a Japanese envoy then present, and declared by him to be like those employed by the people of Y-ye-Kiu \u5937\u90aa\u4e45.\u00b2 Speaking of the manners and customs of the inhabitants of the island, the same record in the annals of the Sui dynasty says that they are much like those of the people of Ling-nan,\u00b3 i.e. south of the modern province of Kiang-su. Now this region is the very same one where Negritos were still settled in the third century A.D., and where the monk Odoric de Pordenone\u2074 met them eleven hundred years afterwards. Tchang sho, a Chinese compiler of the eighth century, has preserved in his work a statement that the Formosan people were like dwarfs, and small like the K\u00fcn-lun men.\u2075 Therefore all these testimonies agree pretty well together.\n\n37. The fact that the Chinese commander took with his army some K\u00fcn-lun men is here highly suggestive of their language being recognized as cognate with those of the great Liu-Kiu or Formosa. It gives us, quite in an unlooked-for way, most valuable information about some point of ethnology of the island, which, as we shall see hereafter, is confirmed by linguistic affinities still recognizable in the present day.\n\n\u00b9 Sui Shu, or 'Annals of the Sui Dynasty' (581-618 A.D.).\n\u00b2 Sui Shu; Tai ping y\u00fc lan, bk. 734, fol. 7 v.\n\u00b3 Ibid, bk. 784, f. 9 v.\n\u2074 My friend Prof. Henri Cordier, the author of the valuable Bibliotheca Sinica, has edited the record of his journey.\n\u2075 Tch'ao ye ts'ien tsai, in Yuen Kien lei han, bk. 231, f. 44.\nBut it involves at the same time an important and interesting solution of a difficult problem, viz. what the word *K\u00fcn-lun* applied in this case means.\n\n38. Of course it cannot be the large range of mountains which in the north of Tibet stretches westwards and eastwards to the Tsung-ling range and the borders of China. In the Flowery Land a range of mountains, otherwise called Peh-ling or Northern Range, north of Szetchuen from west to east, is considered, perhaps not without reason, to be an eastern extension of the great chain; and the name of *Kiu-lung* which it receives is perhaps nothing more than a lessened form, and a local pronunciation without the nasal twang of the same appellative.\n\nThe name is widely spread. The Kokarit hills, Dana mountains, and Poungloung range, east of Tenasserim and Pegu, were called Small and Great K\u00fcn-lun in Chinese records of the T'ang dynasty concerning the Piao kingdom. It exists also in the Malayan peninsula, and we hear of it in former times in Northern Tungking. In the province of Tai-nguyen, belonging to the latter region of Cao-bang, was a town called *Conlon thanh*, in Chinese *K\u00fcn-lun tching*, or K\u00fcn-lun city, built in 257 B.C.\n\nIn Indonesia the name had also made its way.

It was situate northwards at eighty days' journey from the Si-erh-ho, an affluent of the Lan tsang Kiang near Talifu (W. Yunnan).\n\n3 This is however doubtful. As a word for 'mountain' it has a wide extension. We find it in the Pgo Karen *Kulaung*, Sgo Karen *Koelong*, Munipuri *Kalong*, Mon Khalon-*Khyan* (cf. Siamese *Kalohn* 'great'). In my paper *On the Cradle of the Shan Race*, I have shown that the origin of this race took place near this range of mountains in N. Szetchuen. It may be from this smaller range that the name was extended to the great range of Northern Tibet, if not the reverse.\n\n4 *Hoang viet dia du chi* (a native description of Annam), k. ii. f. 9.\n\n5 *Truong Vinh Ky*, *Histoire Annamite*, i. 34.\nto the Philippines, and they were inhabited by K\u00fcn-lun men.\\(^1\\) The second of these names is perhaps the modern Gaddan of Luzon, a Tagala nation,\\(^2\\) and the statement that they were Kun-lun men may have arisen from the name of the Kalingas, also a Tagala tribe in the same island.\\(^3\\)\n\n39. Another instance of the name K\u00fcn-lun much better known is that which concerns the Pulo Condor islands, south-east of Cambodia. Their indigenous name is Conon, according to Father Gaubil, visitor there in 1721,\\(^4\\) and Kohnaong according to Crawfurd,\\(^5\\) who says that this name, like that of the population, is Annamite, and that the ruler was named Cham Kwan Luang. Marco Polo in the thirteenth century calls the two principal islands (there are twelve altogether) Sondur and Condur.\\(^6\\) The latter name is like the modern Condor, which is Malay, and means 'pumpkin,' so that Pulo Condor is 'Pumpkin Island.'\\(^7\\) At the time of the expedition of Kubilai Khan to Chao-wa or Java in A.D. 1292, the same island is called K\u00fcn tun\\(^8\\) in the Annals of the Mongol Y\u00fcan dynasty. In 1730 the Hai Kwoh wen kien luh,\\(^9\\) a small geographical treatise chiefly relating to the islands in the eastern and southern ocean, warns his readers not to confound with the mountains of Northern Tibet the K'\u00fcn lun or K'\u00fcn tun, which are two mountains to the south of the 'seven islands' or Ts'ih tchou, otherwise Pulo Panjang, or 'Paracels islands.' \"One of them\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) T'ang shu\u2014Tai ping yu lan, k. 788, f. 6 v.\n\n\\(^2\\) On these two tribes cf.

The small island is very different. There grow the most pleasant fruits, but no trace of inhabitants can be found in it.\"\u00b9 The San ts'ai t'u huy, a cyclopedia of 1607, in an article about the slaves of K'\u00fcn lun, comes nearer to the point under review. It is there said that K'\u00fcn lun is a land in the south-western sea. \"The body of the inhabitants is black, as if covered with black varnish. They make slaves from amidst their own people, and sell them to foreign merchants, receiving in exchange dresses and other articles.\"\u00b2\n\n40. References to slaves of K\u00fcn lun is not unfrequent in Chinese literature. In the article on Sumatra\u00b3 of the Annals of the Sung dynasty, at the beginning of the latter's reign, i.e. after 960 A.D., it is said that \"slaves of K'\u00fcn lun make music for the Sumatra people by trampling on the ground and singing.\" In the article Ta shi of the same annals, these slaves are described as black men with deep set eyes.\u2074\n\nThe Tung si yang K'ao 'Researches on the Eastern and Western Ocean,' published at Nanking in 1618, in a description of Pahang, East coast of Malacca, says:\u2075 \"The King (then reigning) has the habit of buying from the Mause\u2076 pirates the men they have caught.

Szetchuen, doubtful as it may be, is not the only instance of the name within China proper. We have some better ones. In the centre West of Kuangsi, the mountains north-east of Nan-ning and west of Pintchou bear in history this very name of K\u00fcn-lun, and were inhabited by non-Chinese tribes, a fact important to notice, as we shall see directly.\n\n42. The boat population of Canton, also called Tan-Ka otherwise Tan families, is also known as K\u00fcn-lun slaves, and they are said to be connected with some native tribes in the north of the Kuang-tung province, consequently in proximity to the above K\u00fcn-lun mountains of Kuangsi. On the other hand, the latter barbarians or Tan-Man extended formerly south of the Me\u00efling in Fuhkien province, in proximity to Formosa on the mainland. And the said Tan Ka of Canton are also cognate with native tribes of Hainan. Another link may be found in the name of Ki-lung on the north of Formosa, which, in its Chinese dress and fancied etymology, is perhaps a disguised and altered form of the name carried away with them by the emigrants from the mainland. The word was not carried there as the ordinary word for mountain; in Tayal the chief language in the north of the island, 'mountain' is laoui or malaoui, and as this language is the one which by its glossarial and grammatical affinities was that of the emigrants from the mainland, it is most probable that the above name Kilung is transferred from another and older geographical horizon. The ethnic Tan from the continent is worth more attention. Passing over the linguistic data of Psalmanazar, we may remark the word tanos which he gives for the meaning 'nobles,' and of which the Portuguese final must be dropped. Tan remains, cognate to the above ethnic. The Sekhwan and Favorlang dialects have respectively sanh and sham for 'Man,' which may be\n\n---\n\n1 They were made famous by a clever campaign of a Kiaotchi or Annamese General, who forced the passes through them in 1075 A.D.\n2 Miao Man hoh tchi, bk. i. f. 7.\nthe modern forms of the same, as there is another instance of the equivalence s, sh for t.\n\n43. There are other evidences of importance, which show that the Chinese were acquainted with the dark-skinned occupiers of Formosa as originated from the Philippine Archipelago. The *Yang tchou wen Kao* says that \"the island of Tai-wan (or Formosa), which was formerly called Ki-lung, was originally a port of the Liu-kiu state, which was founded by some descendants of the Ha-la.\" The author does not say what the Ha-la are, assuming that his readers are acquainted with that name, so that we must look elsewhere for the wanted explanation. I find it in the *Miao Man hoh tchi*, \"A Description of the Miao and Man Tribes,\" by Tsao Shu-K'iao of Shanghai. The entry about that people is amongst those of the south. They are described as dark with deep set eyes, a peculiarity which the Chinese stated to be that of the Kun-lun men, as we have seen above. The author of the *Miao Man hoh tchi* says also that the Hala do not know the practice of chewing betel, and he proceeds with some details on their clothes and customs in so far as they are peculiar to themselves, but they are unimportant. Now these Hala of the Chinese are simply the -Gala, commonly Ta-gala, with the usual Ta prefix (?) of the Philippine Islands; and the statement agrees entirely with the inference of ethnologists deduced from travellers' reports as to the parentship of several tribes of aborigines of Formosa with the Tagal population of the Philippines.\n\n44.

Leyden's *On the Languages and Literature of the Indo-Chinese Nations*. This prefix does not seem, however, to be genuine in the language, so that the Chinese have mistaken the first syllable Ta- for their own word (adjective preposed) to 'great,' and dropped it with their usual contempt for foreign nations. But all this is conjectural.\nislands from Japan to the Philippines, states that next to Liu-Kiu lies the country of the *P'i-sh\u00e8-y\u00e9* \u6bd5\u820d\u90aa, in which we must, I think, recognize the Bizayas,\\(^1\\) the most diffused population of the Philippines, and next to the Tagalas in importance. They made a raid on the coasts of Fukien at Tsiuen-tchou during the period 1174\u20131189 A.D., and caused a great deal of havoc. They are described as naked savages with large eyes, greatly covetous of iron in any shape, using bamboo rafts and a sort of javelin attached by a long string, and which they throw on their enemy.\\(^2\\) This people travelling on rafts could not have come from afar, and therefore may be supposed to have come over to the Chinese coast from Formosa. In which probable case, this ought to have resulted from an emigration of them to the great island.\n\n45. Therefore we may conclude from this somewhat protracted inquiry that the Chinese were acquainted with this fact that the two chief elements of the population of Formosa were the Negritos and the Indonesians. Some of their information on the Negritos began as early as the third century of our era, and grew more and more precise; though somewhat mixed in their reports, as it happened they were in reality from admixture and interminglings; the two races are however described with sufficient accuracy to leave no doubt in our minds on the trustworthiness of the Chinese documents here referred to.\n\n### III. ETHNOLOGY.\n\n#### b) From European Authorities.\n\n46. It is to the Dutch that we are indebted for the oldest European information on the island and its population. Though\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) An objection, not insuperable, might be made to the identification of *P'i-sh\u00e8-y\u00e9* with *Bizaya* or *Vizaya*, on the assumption generally repeated that this name was given to them by the Spaniards from the fact that they are tattooed, and that *Bizaya* in their own language means 'painted.' But why should this name have been first applied by the Spaniards, who could have better selected a Spanish word descriptive and telling, unless they did hear it applied by the people themselves or their neighbours?\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf.

Geo. Candidius, who was the first missionary there under Dutch auspices, and who taught the natives with the success that we know of, wrote himself in 1637, a few years after his arrival there, a description of the island, which was published only in 1704\\(^4\\) in London for the first time in English.\n\n47. But, as is often the case with a little-known country where the first remarks refer only to isolated and different spots, the early records are somewhat confusing and contradictory. Joining to this, the craving for marvel, usual accompaniment of the little known, and we may easily understand how it has happened that little credence has been given to these ancient descriptions. I am not sure, however, that they did not deserve a better fate, though some of them may be hard to believe, because they describe an appearance as a reality. I have here in view the marvellous statement of the existence in Formosa of men with tails, according to J. Struys.\\(^5\\) This ethnological fable recalls to mind similar statements concerning the existence of Taylards in Africa, in the Nicobar Islands according to Koeping, in N. E. India according to the Chinese authorities from the third century B.C. downwards, among others. Such\n\n---\n\n1 The Dutch, according to the conditions of a treaty with the Chinese, settled at Tai-wan and the neighbouring territory in 1624. The Spaniards in 1626 settled near Kilung and near Tamsui; they were expelled by the Dutch in 1642.\n2 They have perhaps left distinct descendants.

This was shown to be a fact with the Nyam-Nyams of Central Africa by the late Guillaume Lejean. The Chinese had heard long before the Christian era of tribes named Pu-yen, or Pu-lo, or Po-lo, or simply Puh, in the South-West of Yunnan, i.e. North-East of India, who had tails and were cannibals; the report was looked upon as one of the many ethnological fables which were told by the traders travelling between Western China and Eastern India about the populations of the unknown regions they had to go through, and which told by them in China and in India were the occasion of the similar descriptions of fabulous tribes picked up in India by the Greeks, and reported in Chinese books like the Shan hai King. But quite unexpectedly the report has recently received an explanatory confirmation from a curious custom of some Naga tribes. The late G. H. Damant, Political Officer in the Naga hills, writing about the tribes dwelling between the Brahmaputra and the Ningthi rivers, describes the Sema N\u0101ga, a very extensive and bloodthirsty tribe, numbering some 50,000 souls, south of the Lhota, along both banks of the Doyang river and the east. They were discovered only in 1873. Their men wear\n\n---\n\n1 The Nyam-Nyams and their language were made known to the world for the first time not by Dr. Schweinfurth as Dr. R. N.

Cf. his article in the Revue Orientale et Americaine, 1868.\n\n2 Perhaps for Bore, Abor.\n\n3 Shan hai King; Yung-tchang Kiun tchuen; Fu-nan t'u suh tchuen; Liang tsu wei kwoh tung; Tai Ping yu lan, bks. 787, f. 3; 791, f. 10v. The Yung-tchang Kiun tchuen reports that at 1500 li south-west of Yungtchang Kiun were the 'Tailards Puh;' their tail, similar to that of the tortoise, was four or five ts\u00fcn (inches) in length; when they wanted to seat, it was necessary for them to dig the ground for their tail to be placed comfortably, as when it is broken they die. The Fu-nan t'u suh tchuen reports that on the east of Ko-li was the region of Polo, where the men have tails five or six inches long. Ma Tuanlin has inexcactly quoted the title of the last work as Nan t'u suh tchuen, while it is given accurately in the Tai ping yu lan, l.c.\n\n4 T. de L., The Languages of China before the Chinese, \u00a7 212, and Beginnings of Writing, ii. 156 c.n.\ntails about eighteen inches long, made of wood, to which bunches of goats' hair are attached.\\(^1\\)\n\n49. The fabulous reports about men with tails having so far been verified in two notorious instances, leaving aside other similar cases,\\(^2\\) why should not the same report concerning Formosa be verified in future time by any traveller coming into contact with one of the unknown tribes of the interior having the same mode of ornamenting themselves?\n\n50. Now let us pass to another and more important statement. Valentijn, the great Dutch geographer, reports\\(^3\\) the existence in the beautiful island of \"a race of men, black and extremely tall, inhabiting the mountains, and speaking another language than the other Formosans.\" The statement has been accepted by some scholars as a proof of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) H. Damant, *Notes on the Locality and Population of the Tribes dwelling between the Brahmaputra and Ningthi Rivers*, p. 248 in *J. R. A. S.* 1830, Vol. XII. pp. 228-258.\n\n\\(^2\\) The earliest version in Europe of the tail story goes back to Ptolemy and the Isles of the Satyrs; or rather to Ctesias, who tells of tailed men on an island in the Indian Sea. Galvano (Hackluyt Society, 108, 120) heard that there were on the island certain people called *Darague Dara*, which had tails like unto sheep. And the King of Tidore told him of another such tribe on the isle of Batochina. Mr. St. John (*Forests of the Far East*, i. 40) met with a trader who had seen and felt the tails of such a race inhabiting the north-east coast of that island. The appendage was four inches long and very stiff; so the people all used perforated seats. This Borneo story has, a few years ago, been brought forward in Calcutta, and stoutly maintained, on native evidence, by an English merchant (*Allen's Indian Mail*, July 28, 1869). In the relation of Marco Polo, about Lambri (north-west coast of Sumatra, according to W. P. Groeneveldt, *Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca*, p. 100), we read: \"Now you must know that in this kingdom of Lambri there are men with tails; these tails are of a palm in length, and have no hair on them. These people live in the mountains, and are a kind of wild men. Their tails are about the thickness of a dog's\" (Col. II. Yule, *The Book of Ser Marco Polo*, 2nd edit. vol. ii. p. 282). The people of Canton use to believe that the Yao min (on whom see *The Languages of China before the Chinese*, \u00a7 87), aboriginal tribes at Lieutchou in the north-west of the Kuangtung province, had tails. The *Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie de Paris*, ser. 4, vol. iii. p. 31, contains many similar stories about Africa. Among medieval Mahomedans, the members of the Imperial House of Trebizond were reputed to be endowed with short tails, whilst medieval Continentals had like stories about Englishmen, as Mathieu Paris relates. In the Romance of Cour de Lion, the messengers of Richard are addressed thus by the \"Emperor of Cyprus\":\n\n\"Out, Taylards, of my palys!\nNow go and say your tayled king\nThat I owe him nothing.\" \u2014 *Weber*, ii. 83.\n\nThe princes of Purbandar, in the peninsula of Guzerat, claim descent from the monkey-god Hanuman, and allege in justification a spinal elongation which gets them the name of *Panchariah*, 'Taylards.' Cf. Tod's *Rajasthan*, i. 114, in H. Yule, *Marco Polo*, ii. 284-285.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. Maltebrun, *Annales des Voyages*, 1809, t. viii. p. 366 n.\npresence in the island in former times of Papuas, whose presence was wanted there by some ethnological theories, while it has been rejected by other scholars as unverified and not probable.\\(^1\\) However, the statement of the Dutch geographer was true. A recent traveller,\\(^2\\) better acquainted with the tribes of the interior than many of his predecessors, has come forward, and describes the Diaramocks in such terms that Valentijn's veracity is once more vindicated. They are said to be a fierce and intractable race of cannibals, who disdain all intercourse with the other tribes. They are localised in the mountains, and having no guns, they use merely the bow and spear. Their complexion is very dark\u2014almost black\u2014and their hair hangs down behind to the full extent of its growth. They are said to be a southern branch of the Tangos of the north, who present the same characteristics, and it is not improbable that they are the true descendants of the aboriginal inhabitants of Formosa. No information is given on their language.\n\n51. The appearance in the ethnological descriptions of this region of a black race with the hair not curled, as among the Papuas, cannot fail to attract the attention of specialist scholars, and any further information, which is much wanted, will be welcomed. It is a new element of complication, and perhaps a means of simplification, in the intricate mixture of races which has taken place in the inter-oceanic world.\n\n52. But this is not the sole problem which the ethnology of Formosa has in stock for scholars. There are among several native tribes reports of a tribe of red-haired savages, living among the central mountains, who use brass guns of their own manufacture. They are perhaps descendants of Dutch refugees inland at the time of the conquest of Koxinga.\n\n53. The moment has not yet come to establish a classification of the tribes more or less described by travellers in Formosa; the data are pre-eminently deficient, broken, and\n\n\\(^1\\) Girard de Rialle, *Formose et ses habitants*, l.c. p. 70.\n\\(^2\\) G. Taylor, *The Aborigines of Formosa*, l.c. pp. 286-287.\nsometimes contradictory. A short survey of their list is all that can be made in our present state of knowledge. This has been drawn with talent by a French scholar, M. Girard de Rialle, who has collected and summarized, in 1884, all the ethnological information given by the various travellers.\n\n54. Since he has done his work some most important notices have been published by Mr. G. Taylor, and we have had occasion to refer to them. His descriptions, chiefly relating to the tribes of the south, bear on the\n\n*Paiwans*, tall, fine-limbed, and active, of a bright copper complexion, inhabiting the extreme south and on the west up to Tang kang. They include the Subengs.\n\n*Pepohwans*, the much-mixed inhabitants of the plains.\n\n*Tipuns*, of smaller stature and softer features than the Paiwans; they inhabit the great plain inland from Pilam, and claim to have come from some other country hundreds of years ago, settling where they are now. They conquered the low land aborigines, and ruled over the whole south of Formosa; but at the present day this is a tradition, and no more. The chiefs and their families are tattooed, principally around the wrists, and on the back of the hands and fingers, as lace work, red and blue. When a man marries he becomes part of his wife's family, thus reversing the rule which prevails among the Paiwans. The custom helps them to keep their homogenity, and to increase their number, as they absorb instead of being absorbed.\n\n*Amias*, hirsute and very tall race, foreign to the island, of whom we have already spoken about their tradition concerning written characters.\n\n*Deks*, only mentioned.\n\n*Tierasocks*, *Botans* (or Boutans), *Koaluts*, *Limhucans*, all independent or Sekhwan tribes.\n\n*Cariangans*, mountaineers north of the Paiwans, to whom they are related.\n\nAnd the *Diaromocks*\\(^1\\), the black race mentioned above (\u00a7\u00a7 50-51).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) G. Taylor, *The Aborigines of Formosa*, l.c.\n55. The report which reached the Chinese in the second century of our era concerning the presence of the short-sized Negritos in the island is confirmed by inference in the works of modern ethnologists, and therefore stands on a better footing than those wrongly derived from the Dutch statement about Papuas. Mr. Swinhoe in 1866 had spoken of little savages in the extreme south of the Island,\u00b9 but they have not been actually seen. Dr. Arnold Schetelig\u00b2 and Prof. E. Hamy\u00b3 have been enabled from skull measurements to detect an influence of the Negrito race. Further data are required to settle the question, which, however, cannot fail to receive finally an affirmative answer. The great extension of the Negritos from Japan to Indonesia and the mainland of China, now ascertained, makes it the reverse of an impossibility.\n\n56. The present inhabitants of Formosa include a large number of Chinese emigrants, the majority having come over from the province of Fuhkien through the port of Amoy, and it is the phonesis of the dialect of this port which rules generally the sounds used for the Chinese symbols of writing employed in the island. Other Chinese emigrants have come from different sea-ports; for instance, the Hok-los, also originating from Fuhkien, and settled in the Kwangtung province, have sent many emigrants from Swatow. The Hakkas, a distinct Chinese race said to have come originally from Shantung and now also in the Kwangtung province, have largely migrated to the island. To these must be added the Pun-ti or Cantonese proper represented there by many traders, bankers, etc.\n\n57. Some remarks made by several travellers show that the relationship with the inhabitants of Indonesia is the most apparent. The Batanrang, a tall race, have been found bearing a resemblance to the Tagals, and the Sekhwan of the\n\n\u00b9 Notes on the Aborigines of Formosa, in British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1866, p. 130.\n\u00b2 Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London, 1869, n.s. vol. vii. pp. 216\u2013229.\n\u00b3 Les N\u00e9gritos \u00e0 Formose et dans l'Archipel Japonais (Bull.

Yunnan, pictured in the large work of the French commission in Indo-China.\\(^3\\)\n\n58. The connection here suggested between Formosan tribes and some aborigines of China, which is borne out by linguistic affinities, is supported also by similarities of peculiar customs. Tattooing the forehead in blue, still practised by the independent tribes fighting against the Chinese, was the constant practice of the Non-Chinese tribes of the maritime provinces facing Formosa; and tattooing the cheeks, also an aboriginal custom, and a punishment among the Chinese, is also in honour at Formosa, where tattooing is employed on an extensive scale. Knocking out the front teeth of girls on the occasion of their marriage, common among some tribes of the island, has caused some tribes of the Kih-lao in China to be named To-ya-kih-lao, or 'Tooth-breaking Kih-lao'; and these tribes are among those whose language shows much affinity with the Formosan Tayal. The parallelism could be continued for many other customs touching other events of life, and also as regards burial.\n\n59. As to the greater number of the Formosans so called, they belong to the human substratum which includes so many of the aborigines of China, Ha\u00efnan Island, Indo-China, the Philippine Islands, and the southern Archipelago next to it.\\(^4\\) They have sometimes been looked upon as being of the same race as the Igorrotes, the highlanders of Luzon, and some travellers have compared them to the Dayaks, to the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) L.

The populations of the southern part of the island are, as a rule, of smaller stature than those of the north, and the differences between the tribes amount to a clear suggestion that they have resulted from several ethnical superimpositions, some of which may have taken place previous to the migration of the mixed population.\\(^4\\) Numerous were the migrations into the island, from the mainland, from the Liu-Kiu archipelago, from Japan, from the Philippines, and casually from elsewhere. The migrations did not necessarily belong to different races, but many represented various divisions of one and the same great Indonesian race, settled on the continent of China and the islands, and diverged there individually by their intermingling with populations belonging to other races. In other words, the so-called native population of Formosa is the outcome of successive admixtures of ethnical elements\u2014Negritos, Indonesians, Chinese\u2014which themselves were not unmixed previous to their settlement in the island, and the continuous process of segmentation into distinct tribes, proper to their low standard of culture, has produced the state of intricacy which the ethnologist has to face in studying their origin.\n\n\\(^1\\) Fred.

Girard de Rialle, as a conclusion to his valuable articles on *Formose et ses Habitants*, l.c., p. 281, has expressed an opinion somewhat similar.\nIV. Linguistics, \u00a7\u00a7 60-110.\n\n60. The linguistics and the ethnology of the island of Formosa are composite. Races pure and mixed from the mainland, and from the outward islands, have met there. Sometimes and in some places they have freely mixed. The absence of any strong government on a large area has not permitted any other unification to take place but that which results from the uninterrupted influence of the surrounding circumstances always at work. It was as a matter of fact the opposite case, and the numerous fragmentary chieftainships have produced in the languages as in the people a large number of broken and small units, which, made up of several ethnico-linguistic elements, can hardly be arranged otherwise than according to the prevalence of one or the other of these elements.\n\n61. Like its ethnology, the linguistics of the island are fragmentary; not one of the languages has taken the lead and imposed its sway over the others. It is only on the western coast, where the Chinese colonists, Hoklo, Hakka, Punti, are established, that some native tribes have given up their native tongue and adopted that of their neighbours, somewhat their masters. Such, for instance, as the Baksa Pepohwan, who are the descendants of those who wrote the interesting MSS. which are the occasion of these notes.\n\n62. A general review of the languages and dialects spoken in Formosa cannot be attempted otherwise than in a very incomplete and summary manner. Of the twenty-five languages and dialects enumerated below, only two or three are represented in our data by vocabularies of a certain length, while we know only a few words of the others. Some more are in existence, but nothing is known beyond their names. No grammar of any language of Formosa has ever been composed.\n\na) In Chinese Sources.\n\n63. A precious bit of information is that which results from the Annals of the Sui dynasty, in 606 A.D., as we have\nseen above when dealing with the ethnological question. There we shall see that the Chinese were made cognizant that the language of the Formosans, at least on that southern part of the island facing the province of Fuhkien, was related to the speech of the tribes, mixed in origin otherwise, Negrito-Indonesian, which they knew within and without their dominions.\n\n64. The above-named records contain a few words as a specimen of the Formosan language, which are interesting as the oldest example known. I reproduce them with their Chinese rendering, and also with the Amoy sounds which are usually employed on the island, because of the great number of Chinese emigrants from that port.\n\n| AMOY SOUNDS | MANDARIN SOUNDS | MEANING |\n|-------------|----------------|---------|\n| \u6b4c\u65af Hwan-su | Hwan-sze       | Family name of the king |\n| \u6cb3\u523a\u515c K'at-la-tau | Koh-la-tou | Personal ditto |\n| \u53ef\u8001\u7f8a K'o-lo-yong | Ko-lao-yang | As he is named by his subjects |\n| \u591a\u62d4\u8336 To-puat-tch'a | To-pa-tcha | Name of the queen |\n| \u6ce2\u7f85\u6a80 P'o-lo-tan | Po-lo-tan | A royal residence or city |\n| \u5cf6\u4e86 Lian-lian | Miao-liao | Head man of village |\n\nThese few words are not uninteresting, because of their age, the beginning of the seventh century, though the Chinese orthoepy detracts a good deal from their value. In the recent reorganization of the Chinese administration of the island, a new city will be built on the site of a small village called Hu-lu Tun, south of Tchang-hwa, in the centre of the western coast. The name recalls singularly the Po-lo-tan of the above list.\n\nNothing can be made in the way of comparison of these special words with the modern lists of vocables from the various dialects, because of the deficiency and shortness of these lists when such words do not occur.\n\n1 \u00a7\u00a7 37-41.\nb) According to Psalmanazar.\n\n65. Mr. E. Colborne Baber has suggested that the well-known Psalmanazar, in his fictitious description of Formosa at the beginning of the last century, might not have invented, as he did for the other parts of his book, the language of which he gave specimens. Our learned colleague supposes that the forger had perhaps met with a vocabulary of one of the Formosan dialects written by a Dutch Missionary. I have taken the hint, and consulted the above curious work, where however a few specimens only of the language are given, such as the numerals, some twenty-five words, besides translations of Our Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed, and the Ten Commandments.\\(^1\\) I think that the suggestion of Mr. E. Colborne Baber will prove partially true, and that most likely George Psalmanazar had come across some information concerning a dialect of Formosa through a Portuguese, not through a Dutch source. Such being the probabilities, it may be interesting to quote some of the documents from Psalmanazar's book.\n\n66. About the numerals Psalmanazar writes: \"They (the Formosans) had no names for numbers before the Dutch came here, but they sufficiently declared to one another what number they meant by their signs and fingers; but because the Dutch did not understand this way of reckoning, they persuaded us to invent names to signify numbers, which now we use after the same manner as they do, proceeding from one to ten, from ten to twenty, and so to a hundred, a thousand, etc., as appears in this instance.\n\n1) Taufb, 2) Bogis, 3) Charhe, 4) Kiorh, 5) Nokin,\n6) Dekie, 7) Meni, 8) Thenio, 9) Sonio, 10) Kan; 11) Amkon or Taufkon, 12) Bogiokon, 13) Charhekton, 14) Kiorhkon\n15) Nokiekon, 16) Dekiekon, 17) Menikon, 18) Thenikon,\n19) Soniokon, 20) Borhny. After this Borhny-tauf or Am Borhny Bogio, and so on to 30) Chorhny, 40) Kiorhny,\n50) Nokiorhny, 60) Dekiorhny, 70) Meniorhny, 80) Theniorhny,\n\n\\(^1\\) See below, \u00a7 70 note.\n90) Soniorhny, 100) Ptommftomm, and 1000) Tanate, so 1000, 2000, etc., and this may suffice for this article.\"\u00b9\n\n67. Surely these numerals are not an invention; the short account which precedes them however may be something of a story, though not altogether untrue, as M. Gu\u00e9rin reports that the Tayal cannot make use of his decimal numeration without the help of his fingers.\u00b2 I cannot identify them all through, but several of them may be correct: for instance, taufb 'one' is much like the Pepohwan sasaab; charhe 'four' reminds us of the turu of many of these dialects; bogis 'two' looks like a misprint for rogis, in which case it would be cognate to roussa, loossa, which appear for the same numeral in the lists given herewith; kiorh 'four' apparently for ?tiorh is the turu, taro also in the same lists; dekie 'six' answers to t\u0101i-o; soerio 'nine' corresponds to sio, siuca. These form six similarities out of the ten numerals, and go a long way to show that the Psalmanazar specimens were not invented by him.\n\n68. There are, besides the above, a few statements of the most flimsy character, which display the preoccupation of an ignorant and ill-informed man. For instance, after stating that the language of Formosa is the same as that of Japan, he ventures to prove it by the following comparison:\u00b3\n\n'Ego amo,' in Formosan Jerh chato, in Japanese Jerh chato.\n'Ego eram amans,' in Formosan Jervicye chato, in Japanese Jerh chataye.\n'Ego ero amo,' in Formosan Jerhviar chato, in Japanese Jerh chatar.\n\nAnd he duly notes the difference between the two methods employed for expressing the conditions of time, the Formosan by addition to the pronoun, the Japanese by addition to the verb. The materials at hand are too scanty to permit me to show any assimilation of the verb 'love' in any of the Formosan dialects, and I do not find the word, or anything\n\n\u00b9 A Description of the Isle Formosa, pp. 246-247.\n\u00b2 M. Gu\u00e9rin, Vocabulaire du Dialecte Tayal, l.c. p. 467.\n\u00b3 A Description, pp. 266-267.\napproaching it, in Japanese. But we know more about the pronouns; jerh may be compared to the ware Japanese, and to the yako\u00b9 Formosan, showing a sort of tentative spelling to connect the two words.\n\nThen comes another statement concerning gender, which is said to be known by the articles:\u00b2 oi \u2018hic,\u2019 oy \u2018h\u00e6c,\u2019 ay \u2018hoc,\u2019 as in oi banajo \u2018hic homo,\u2019 os banajos \u2018hi homines.\u2019 Here we have the most distinct proof of the Portuguese origin of the linguistic data made use by Psalmanazar. Os is the Portuguese article.\n\n69. There is no vocabulary in his book; only a few words which it may not be uninteresting to extract, as follows:\n\nBaghathaan cherecaal\u00b3 \u2018emperor or most high monarch\u2019; bagalo or angon \u2018king\u2019; bagalendro or bagalender \u2018viceroy\u2019; tanos \u2018nobles\u2019; os tanos souiletos \u2018governors of cities or isles\u2019; poninos \u2018citizens\u2019; barhaw \u2018countrymen\u2019; plessios \u2018soldiers\u2019; banajo \u2018man\u2019; bajane\u2074 \u2018woman\u2019; bot \u2018son\u2019; boti \u2018daughter\u2019; pornio\u2075 \u2018father\u2019; porniin \u2018mother\u2019; geovreo \u2018brother\u2019; jarraijin \u2018sister\u2019; arrannos \u2018kinsmen\u2019; avia \u2018an isle\u2019; tillo \u2018a city\u2019; casseo \u2018a village\u2019; orhnio \u2018heaven\u2019; badi \u2018earth\u2019; auso \u2018sea\u2019; onillo \u2018water.\u2019\u2076\n\n70. It will be sufficient to identify a few of these words, and to remark the presence again of the Portuguese article, and the otherwise Portuguese appearance or dress of several words. The words for emperor, king, viceroy, may be genuine, though their meaning was respectively greatly magnified for the requirements of the case. They have in common the word bagha or baga, followed by a qualitative according to the requirements of Formosan ideology. Pornio \u2018father\u2019 and geovreo \u2018brother,\u2019 with the addition of in,\n\n\u00b9 Yakko is also the spoken form of yatsu-ko, the old bookish pronoun for I in Japan.\n\u00b2 In the Bouiok, Buhwan, Sekhwan, Tsuihwian dialects; in Pepohwan ya-u, in Pelam iko, altered from yako.\n\u00b3 This word recalls singularly the name chhvea, by which the Malays are known to the Cambodians. Cf. G. Janneau, Manuel de la Langue Cambodgienne, Saigon, 1870, 8vo. p. 63.\n\u2074 Cf. Malay Bahina, Celebes Bahini.\n\u2075 Cf. Sideia rena \u2018mother.\u2019\n\u2076 Psalmanazar, A Description, pp. 270-271.\nbecome porniin 'mother,' and jacraijin 'sister'; now inina, ina, iena, are the full word for 'woman' or 'female' in Formosan dialects. Bot 'son' we find in badda of shiem badda, i.e. 'man child,' in Favorlang. Badi 'earth' is connected with the well-known word batu 'stone.' Auso 'sea' answers to the Shekoan aiass, Favorlang abass, with the same signification.\n\nThe word angon for king is obviously the Chinese 'an-kung,' which we have met with in the legend of the seals of several officials.\n\nIt would be superfluous to go on with these comparisons, the similarities which we have been able to indicate in the numerals and in several words are all that the necessities of the case require.\n\nPsalmazar has completed his linguistic information with the text and translation of three prayers, the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed, and the Ten Commandments, which I consider simply as forgeries.\n\n71. To resume, it may be said, that Psalmazar was not acquainted with any Formosan dialect himself, but that he had got hold of some notes written by an ignorant Portuguese mariner, who in his travels in the eastern seas, and probably\n\n---\n\n1 Orhmio 'heaven,' is perhaps the same word as Thunucoun and Pullun, with the same significations as in the translations of the Paternoster by Junius and Gravins. Cf. below \u00a7\u00a7 77-78.\n\n2 See above \u00a7\u00a7 6, 18.\n\n3 In the biography of Psalmazar (Encyclopedia Britannica, ninth edit.) it is recorded that previous to the publication of his book he was employed by the Bishop of London to translate the catechism into the Formosan language, which he professed to know. Thinking that this translation might have been published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, I inquired from their editorial secretary, Mr. Edmund McClure, who kindly answered me as follows (27th Jan. 1887), \"I am now just editing the minutes of this Society from 1698 to 1705, and I am familiar with all the matters dealt with during this period. There is nothing therein bearing upon a Formosan version of the catechism.\"\n\n4 In the sixteenth century the Spanish missionaries had tried to settle in the island, and traces were found of them. Vid. Aguilar, Annales de la Propagation de la Foi, 1862, p. 112 sq.\n\n5 B. Schulze, in his Orientalische und Occidentalische Sprachmeister (Leipzig, 1748), gives in his work the Formosan numerals, a notice of the language and the alphabet (pars i. pp. 205, 104-105, and 103), which might have been borrowed from Psalmazar himself, as they are very similar to his; but I think that they come from the same faulty source, apparently Portuguese, from which the celebrated forger derived his information, because the alphabet is more extensive than that given in his book. Cf. \u00a7 23 above, and my article on A Native Writing in Formosa in The Academy, 9th April, 1887, p. 259.\non the coast of Formosa, had there picked up some words, which he completed with some other Malay and Portuguese terms.\n\nc. From Dutch and Modern Authorities.\n\n72. Once settled in Formosa, the Dutch, as a matter of course for their purposes of colonization and evangelization, were led to learn the languages of the tribes with which they were brought into contact on the west coast, namely, at Sinkam, Tavokam, Beklawan, Sulang, Mattou, Tivorang, Favorlang, Takkeis, Tornap, Terenip, Assuk, Dorko, Tilocen, etc. Three languages or dialects, viz. those of Sakam, Sideia, and Favorlang, were more or less known to them.\n\n73. Rob. Junius, who was a missionary at Sulang for 14 years, wrote in Formosan (?) a Catechism, which was published at Delft in 1645.\n\nDaniel Gravius, who is said to have laboured as a preacher in Formosa, between the years 1647 and 1651, translated the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. John, published at Amsterdam in 1661, and wrote in the Sideia dialect a formulier of the Christian religion, also published at Amsterdam in the following year. Let us observe that by a singular turn of fortune, these latter valuable works were published just at the time when the countrymen of the author\n\n---\n\n1 Or Sinkkam, Cinckon, Sincam, Siccam, Sicam, Zijkam, Sekam, Sakam, Sakkam, Sakkam.\n2 Or Becloan.\n3 Or Assoek.

It was previously known in the literature concerning Formosa under the following: Evangelia Matthei et Johannis in linguam Formosanam translata cum versione Belgica. Op. Dan.

Amsterd. 1662, 4to.\nwere driven away by the pirate Koxinga from the seat of his former labours. It is from an analysis of the Formulier of Gravius that Klaproth\\(^1\\) was enabled to write his notes *Sur la Langue des Indig\u00e8nes de l'\u00eele de Formose*\\(^2\\) in 1822, and subsequently to compile his *Vocabulaire Formosan*\\(^3\\) of 390 words, and his *Phrases en Formosan*,\\(^4\\) which therefore are exclusively in the Sideic dialect.\n\n74. According to Dan. Gravius, the language he employed was spoken at Sulang, Mattan, Sinckan, Bacloan, Tavokan, Tevorang, and more or less also at Dorko and Tilosen. However, this language seems to have been wanting in uniformity, and several dialects were in existence. Therefore we cannot take his statement otherwise than in a limited sense, meaning that the language spoken of was looked upon by him as the standard of the region he describes. And we are sorry to say, the facts do not seem to justify his statement even as far as that. Rob. Junius, who was at Sulang, one of the localities mentioned by Gravius, wrote in another dialect than the Sideic of the latter; his dialect was most probably that of Sinkam, as shown by similarities of words with those of the manuscripts, and therefore was also the dialect that is now dying out among the Baksa Pepohwans.\n\n75. The great relationship of the language of the manuscripts with that of the Baksas has been shown by Mr. E. Colborne Baber, who has pointed out several words in them, which are similar to those of the said dialect. I subjoin these words here with the corresponding Sideic terms available to show the differences:\n\n| Silver | Vanitok | Manituk |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| Cattle | Lohang  | Lohang  |\n| To declare | Masosoo | Masasu |\n| One | Sasaat | Sasaab | Saat |\n| Eight | Pahpat | Pipa | Kauyphpa |\n| Ten | Kitiang | Keteng | Kytti |\n\n\\(^1\\) \"Je l'ai d\u00e9poill\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement.\" Such are his words, in his *Description de l'\u00eele de Formose* (M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l'Asie, Paris, 1826, vol. i. pp. 321-353), p. 363.\n\n\\(^2\\) Journal Asiatique, Octobre, 1822, i. pp. 193-202.\n\n\\(^3\\) M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l'Asie, vol. i. pp. 354-368.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ibid. vol. i. pp. 369-374.\n76. In order to make good my first statement regarding the dialect employed by Junius, I subjoin the following instances, and the two versions of the *Pater noster* by this missionary and Dan. Gravius. They were given by Adelung in his *Mithridates*, vol. i. pp. 580\u2013582.\n\n| Junius | Gravics | Baksia | Siedic |\n|--------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Father | Diam    | Rama   | Dama   |\n| Heaven | Vullum  | Tounuoun |       |\n| Day    | Wagi    | Wa'i   | Wagi (sun) |\n| Liberate | Sousiame | Hasumi-ei |\n\n77. **Pater Noster**, by Rob. Junius, 1645:\n\nDiam-eta ka tu Vullum, Luiugniang ta Nanang oho; Mahatongal ta tao tu Goum sho Mamatalto ki kamoienu tu Nay, mama tu Vullum.\n\nPe-came ka cangniang Wagi Katta; Hamiecame ki Varaniang mameniang ma-mia ta Varan-ki tao ka mouro ki r\u00fceh emitang.

Gravius, 1661:\n\nRama-yan, ka itsu Touonnoun koio ki Vullum, Pakou tik tik-auh loumoulough ta Nanangoho; Pa-irou-an ta Peissasou-an-oho; Paamtan ta Kamoei-en-hou, mama tou Touonnoun, Kma-hynna tou Na\u00ef;\n\nPhei-Kame Wa'i katta ki Paoul-i-an ka mamsing.

Amen.\n\n79. The two texts are obviously written in dialects closely connected, but they are not one and the same language written by two different persons.\u00b9 Many words\n\n\u00b9 Even admitting, as is here the case, that this language was still unwritten, and that the selection of special words for the rendering of new ideas led to personal differences.\nare in common, such as: ka 'who, which'; tu 'in, on'; mama 'as'; katta 'this'; oho 'thine'; ta 'the'?; kame or came 'us'; nay or na\u00ef 'earth'; nanang 'name'; etc. Other words are nearly similar: pe (J.) and phei (G.) 'give'; ine (J.) and inei (G.) 'not'; imou (J.) and 'am-hou (G.) 'thine'; litto (J.) and lyttou (G.) 'devil'; while some words are altogether different: eta (J.) and yan (G.) 'our'; luiugniang (J.) and loumoulough (G.) 'praised'; etc., etc.\n\n80. The equivalence of sound in the transcriptions of \\( R = D \\) between the Sideic of Gravius and the Sinkan, now Baksa Pepohwan, of Junius and the MSS., is a regular one, as shown by the further examples given below. And it is not uninteresting that this equivalence should be extended to \\( S \\) in another dialect, exemplified by a list of 1072 words found in MS. in the library of the University of Utrecht by Dr. Van der Vlis, and described by him in a paper published at Batavia in 1842.\\(^2\\) This other dialect, unnamed, seems represented by the speech of the Kanagou and Paichien of the present day.\n\n81. The following list illustrates the equivalences spoken of in the three dialects:\n\n| Sideia | Van der Vlis | Pepohwan |\n|--------|--------------|-----------|\n| Father | rama         | sama      | dama     |\n| Mother | rena         | sena      | tena     |\n| Water  | ralaum       | salong    | dalum    |\n| Thunder| rungdung     | singding  | dungdung |\n| Tree   | parannah     | pesanach  |          |\n| Foot   | rahpal       | sapal     | dapal (pelam) |\n| Great  | irang        | isang     |          |\n| Two    | ranka        | (so) soa  | duha.    |\n\n82. Allusion has been made by Valentijn and other Dutch writers to a Sakam language,\\(^3\\) the one in which are written\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Im and 'am are probably another word; leaving ou and hou, which may be forms of oho, 'thine,' as above.\n\n\\(^2\\) Formosaansche Woorden lijst volgens een Utrechtsch Handschrift.

Valentijn himself, in 1644, was commissioned from Batavia to collect a Sakam dictionary or vocabulary, in order that a Malay, Portuguese, Sakam and Dutch vocabulary might afterwards be constructed therefrom. But nothing seems to have been done, though the name of Junius has been, rightly or wrongly, connected with the work. Anyhow, the connection we have disclosed in these pages between the dialect employed by this missionary and that of the MSS. from Sinkiang or Sakam, shows that his Katechism was written in that special dialect.\n\n83. The Favorlang, the other language of Formosa, which has been known to the Dutch occupiers, is quite distinct from the preceding dialects, though related to them. The chief work in that language is an important vocabulary, compiled in 1650 by Gilbertus Happart. It was found in 1839 by Dr. W. R. van Ho\u00ebvell, in the archives of the Church Council at Batavia, and published by him in the eighteenth volume of Transactions of the Batavian Society of Arts and Literature, with some additional remarks. In 1840, W. H. Medhurst translated it into English, and also published it at Batavia, the same year.\n\n84. A manuscript with Favorlang texts has also been found at Batavia, but nothing beyond the Paternoster has been edited from it, and this in 1857 only, by E. Netscher.\n\nHere is this Paternoster in Favorlang, which may be compared with the Sinkam and Sideia versions which we have reproduced above:\n\n---\n\n1 G. Happart was, according to Valentijn, missionary in Formosa from 1649 to 1652 and 1653 to 1655.\n2 The title is given above, n. This volume was, however, completed only afterwards, and bears the date of 1842. The Woordenboek der Favorlandsche Taal, waarin het Favorlangs voor, het duits Achter Gestelt is, door Gilbertus Happart, occupies the pp. 31\u2013381, and the remarks of Dr. Ho\u00ebvell, the pp. 382\u2013430.\n3 Dictionary of the Favorlang Dialect of the Formosan Language, by Gilbertus Happart, written in 1650.

Adelung in Mithridates, i. 578, mentions two new works by Sim. van Breen and by J. Happart. As the latter's vocabulary has been published, that of Sim. van Breen is probably that from which extract.\nNamo ta-man, ta masea paiya de busum, i-pa-dasa yoa moan, i-pa-saiya yoa \u03c7aximit o ai, i-pa-iyoro yoa airab ma-\nibas de busum ma-sini de ta \u03c7anuma, epe-e namo-no piada i\ntoro upo maatsikap soo abo-e namo ta taap o kakosi namoa\nma-ibas \u03c7anuma, namo m-abo ta masea pa rapies i namo, hai\npa-sabas i namo, soo baras i namo, inai rapies ai, inan yoa\nmixo \u03c7aximit o ai soo bar o ai soo adas ai ta-ulaulan. Amen.\u00b9\n\n85. The data which we possess of the other dialects and\nlanguages spoken in the island are still more unsatisfactory\nthan those hitherto described. They consist of vocabularies\nof various length, some of them composed of only a few\nwords, collected by various travellers in various places, at\nvarious times and with various spellings.\u00b2 So that the\ndiversity is great, and no scientific accuracy is attainable.\nAnd though we know thus far the existence of some twenty-\ntwo dialects, we are by no means at all certain that some\nmore may not increase the unpleasant collection.\n\n86. The most important by far of these vocabularies is that\nof the Tayal language (551 words), compiled by M. Gu\u00e9rin\nin the north of the Island and published in the Bulletin de la\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie de Paris in 1868.\u00b3 It consists of several\nhundred words, with some phrases and remarks which make\nit a most important document. The same traveller also\ncollected six other small vocabularies in the same region and\nfurther south, namely, those of the Shabogala, Bouiok, Tsoo or\nTiboula, Sibouken, Kanagou, and in the extreme south the\nKali. Vocabularies of Tsui-huan, Sekhwan, Buhwan, Pelam\nand Pepohwan have been compiled by Mr. J. L. Bullock,\nthe longest comprehending 179 words.\u2074 Mr. Charles Carroll,\nlike Mr. J. L.

As to the position of the Formosan languages in the general classification, it has long been stated, from the lexicological affinities,\\(^1\\) that the civilized agricultural inhabitants of the shores of Formosa spoke a Malayan language. Klaproth, and also Malte Brun,\\(^2\\) on data chiefly belonging to the Sideia and kindred dialects, were able to go as far as that, and to show their affinity, not only with the Malayan tongues of the Indian archipelago, but also with the African Malay (Malagasy) and the Polynesian Malay (Tagalog).\n\nMr. J. Thomson has put side by side his Paichien, Sibucoun, Tibolal, Banga and Bantalang vocabularies, with the same words from the Malay of Singapore; also Shekhoan, Pilam and Baksa Pepohwan, each separately with Malay, and a comparative table of the numerals in the above-named dialects and language, with those of the Jagul and Bisaya (Philippines), New Zealand, Tikopia, Waigiu, Tonga, and Maw (Polynesia), and of the Arfours of Manado (C\u00e9l\u00e8bes), which exhibit a complete relationship.\n\n91. As to the parentage with the Malay exclusively, an analysis of the vocabularies given by Mr. Thomson has yielded the following results:\n\n| Dialect     | Words | Malay Affinities |\n|-------------|-------|------------------|\n| Baksan      | 67    |                  |\n| Pilam       | 48    | 10               |\n| Shekhwan    | 45    | 9                |\n| Bantalang   | 40    | 8 distant affinities |\n| Paichien    | 34    | 3                |\n| Sibucoun    | 21    | 2                |\n| Tibolal     | 9     | 0                |\n| Banga       | 38    | 5                |\n\nSo that the first three dialects on the list stand in closer relationship to the Malay than the succeeding ones; but the parentage must be looked upon as existing with the Indo-\n\n\\(^1\\) Description de l'\u00eele de Formose, extraite des livres Chinois, in M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l'Asie, 1826, i. 321\u2013353, and Vocabulaire, 354\u2013374.\n\n\\(^2\\) Annales des Voyages, 1809, t. vii.; also Analyse de quelques M\u00e9moires Hollandais sur l'\u00eele de Formose, ibid. 1810, t. viii. p. 344.\nnesian languages as a whole, and not with any dialect in particular. I find that Mr. J. Bullock had come to the same conclusion; in comparing ninety words of the various dialects from which he has collected the vocabularies reprinted below,\u00b9 and the lists of A. R. Wallace, comprehending vocabularies of the Malay of Java, Bouton and Salayer of S. Celebes, Menado and Bolanghitam of N. Celebes, and Sangnir of Sula Islands, Mr. J. Bullock has found 31 words, or one-third, identical with some Malayan words.\u00b2 The Pelam having the most, and the Pepohwan the next most similarities. But the comparison shows no connection with any particular dialect.\n\n92. Dr. Arnold Schetelig was the first to study the language of the independent tribes.\u00b3 He came to the conclusion that these independent tribes, also called Senghwan, have only borrowed a sixth part of their vocabulary from their Malay neighbours, from whom they differ otherwise in language, and are physically closely allied to the continental people of China. W. M. H. in 1857\u2074 has called attention to the relationship evidenced by the Kali numerals furnished by Mr. Swinhoe, and the Malay ones, in the case of four, five, six, seven, and ten.\u2075\n\nThe Paiwans speak a language of the general type, and so do the Cariangans; while the Tipuns, avowed foreigners, have only accepted the Paiwan numerals, their language, says Mr. G. Taylor, being otherwise different.\n\n93. The language of the black Diaramocks of the mountainous region inland is altogether unknown,\u2076 and we are still without any other information than that given by\n\n\u00b9 See \u00a7 86, and the Appendix.\n\u00b2 J.

The late J. Logan of Singapore, writing in 1852,\\(^2\\) made a comparison of the Formosan (Sideia, Favorlang) and several Philippine dialects, all of which he included in his North Indonesian subdivision. The dialectic differences of the Formosan connect it with the Pampangan of Luzon, and the most important formatives agree in all the essential points.\n\n95. The late Von der Gabelentz in 1859\\(^3\\) wrote a valuable monograph, its object being to fix the place of the Formosan in the Malay class. Besides the original Sideia data, he was enabled to compare the Favorlang in the dictionary published in 1840. The great German scholar decided that the affinities of Formosan are Indonesian, and that they are not so exclusively Philippine as the geographical relations suggest.\n\n96. The Abb\u00e9 Favre,\\(^4\\) in his remarks added to the important paper of M. Gu\u00e9rin in 1868 on the Tayal dialect, concludes that the dialects of Formosa are of Polynesian (?) origin; the Favorlang being purer than the Tayal, which has diverged from the original type through its contact with the Chinese. I am not sure that this Polynesian origin is borne out by the paper of this scholar, as all the evidence he adduces consists of serious affinities of the Favorlang with the Malay and Javanese, which are also met with in a less degree in Tayal.\n\n97. Dr. Friedrich M\u00fcller, in 1882, in his important, though I am afraid rather overvalued, large linguistic work, has included the Formosan in his Malayan division, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See above \u00a7 50.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ethnology of the Indo-Pacific Islands: Language.

Society, 1875. vol. ix. pp. 53-88) has given a vocabulary of the Kabaran Pepohwan, and also one of the Yukan-Tayal.\nmade it one of the eleven languages\\(^1\\) which he has compared together. But there is very little if anything new there, as his Formosan is the Favorlang, and his sole authority the monograph of Conon von der Gabelentz. (\\$ 95.)\n\nNotwithstanding all these later efforts, the chief authority on the matter, still in advance by far, remains the late J. Logan, who wrote thirty-five years ago the work referred to above, and we can only complain of the deficiency of the documents at his disposal.\n\n98. Therefore all the affinities hitherto pointed out connect the majority of the three groups of Formosan languages, Tayal, Sideic, and Favorlang, \\(^1\\)) with the Indonesian and Pacific languages at large, and the Malayan languages in particular, with reference to the vocabulary, and \\(2\\)) with the languages of the Philippines from the standpoint of structure and morphology. But it must be said that though the existence of an important deviation from the Indonesian standard, supposed to have been caused by the influence of the Chinese immigrants, has been duly noticed, no affinities have been sought for the Formosan languages except in the south and west of the island. The mainland has been neglected, and no thought was given to the non-Chinese.\n\n99. However, as early as 1853, the venerable Brian H. Hodgson, in his paper *On the Tribes of Northern Tibet and of Sifan*,\\(^2\\) had shown the remarkable similarity of verbal formation by piled-up prefixes in the *Gyarung*, a language on the Tibetan frontier of China, and the Tagala of the Philippines. The affinity cannot be denied, but this simple fact, full of ethnological suggestion, has escaped the attention of the above-named scholars. Or, should they have come across Hodgson\u2019s statement, they have neglected it as a fancy of its author, which the geographical distance and the supposed presence of the Chinese in the intervening country from olden times, rendered utterly improbable and not worthy of examination.\n\n\\(^1\\) These eleven languages are the following: Tagala, Ibanag, Formosan, Battak, Malagasy, Altur, Dayak, Malay, Javanese, Mankasar, and Bugis. Vid. his *Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft*, ii. (2) pp. 87\u2013160.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society*, vol. xxii. 1853, p. 121, sq.\n100. But now that the historical inhabitation of China by the Chinese is known to have been the result of a slow growth, the matter has taken a different complexion. In another place I have shown reason to believe, from the own avowal of the historical Chinese traditions, that the Gyarungs were nothing more nor less than one of the *disjecta membra* now driven away by the pressure of the Chinese growth, west, south, and also east, of a former nucleus of the native population of China, Indonesian in character at the beginning and gradually diverging from their former standard under the combined influences of their new surroundings, linguistical and others.\\(^1\\)\n\n101. The Gyarung glossary exhibits numerous similarities with the Blue Miao and T'u man tribes now in Kueitchou, the Toungthus of Burma, in which case they extend to \\(25\\%\\), with the Tayal of Formosa and with the above-named Tagala. This remarkable connection would some years ago have proved unintelligible, while in the present day we may look upon it almost as not unexpected.\n\n102. I have carefully compared the Tayal glossary with the lists of words available from the remnant tribes of the Aborigines, or non-Chinese tribes of the Middle Kingdom, and I have found with several of them the following proportion of similarities:\n\n| Tribe            | Percentage |\n|------------------|------------|\n| Tchung Miao      | 33%        |\n| T'u man          | 25%        |\n| K'i-lao          | 25%        |\n| Lo\u00ef of Hainan    | 25%        |\n| Ngan shun Miao   | 20%        |\n| Blue Miao        | 20%        |\n| Black Miao       | 15%        |\n| White Miao       | 10%        |\n\n103. These figures, with the exception of those concerning the last two names, which belong to a more distant group, exhibit an undeniable connection and larger affinity than\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. *The Languages of China before the Chinese*, \u00a7\u00a7 129-144, and 225.\nwith the Malayan groups. All these tribes, with the exception of the Li, are now located in the Kueitchou province of Western China, where they have been gradually removed or driven from their former seats in the centre and east of China. Unhappily the documents for studying the languages of these and other aborigines are pre-eminently deficient. They consist of lists of words of various lengths and various origins and dates, either casually quoted in the Chinese records, or purposely collected by them or by Europeans, with all their differences in time, place, writing and language owned by their authors.\u00b9 In other words, as a matter of fact, they are the worst materials that could possibly be placed in the hands of the philologist, and permit very little, if any, insight on the structure of the languages they represent.\n\n104. Another, though indirect, means of inquiry is the study of the influence of the native languages on the historical and regional evolution of the genuine Chinese dialects. As I have shown elsewhere, I have been able to ascertain that in former times, in the east of China, on the mainland, the native dialects used, in the construction of their sentences, to place the subject after the verb.\u00b2 This remarkable feature is rather uncommon; it does not belong to the K\u00fcenlunio linguistic formation, which includes the Chinese and the Tibeto-Burmese groups; nor does it to the M\u014dn-Khmer and Taic-Shan families constituting the Indo-Chinese division of the Indo-Pacific stem; but it is a regular feature of the Indonesian, north division, and an occasional one of the Polynesian, both branches of the Oceanic languages belonging to the aforesaid Indo-Pacific stem. Therefore we may adduce from this fact the existence in the east of China of dialects of a north Indonesian character, existence which is further established by the similarities presented by the now removed Gyarungs and several tribes of Kueitchou.\n\n105. Allusion has already been made to the system of\n\n\u00b9 Cf. T. de L., The Languages of China before the Chinese, \u00a7\u00a7 2-7, p. 394-398, in Transactions of the Philological Society for 1885-6.\n\u00b2 Cf. T. de L., ibid. \u00a7 23, p. 406. And more fully in my other work, Ideology of Languages and its Relation to History, \u00a7\u00a7 120-122, pp. 84-87.\nprefixes superimposed one to the other, and also of infixes in the case of the verb in Gyarung, as in north Indonesian. Particular prefixes determining the condition of the sense of the word must also be noticed. For instance, in Gyarung, in 25 verbs I find that 17 begin by ta, the a often displaced by a vowel harmonizing with the word; in 27 adjectives, 26 begin with ka- or ku-, etc.; both prefixes are cognate to the similar prefixes ta-, ti-, te-, and ka- of north Indonesia, ta, ti, of Formosa, tche of the Kih-lao of Kueitchou, k- and t- of the other aforesaid Miao dialects, and the k- and t- of the Gyarung. All of them, derived from common parents, have been diversified in their value and use in the course of the respective evolutions of the languages which have them.\n\n106. Scholars have already compared the ma- and pa- of Favorlang with the mag- of Tayal and the pan-, pa-, of Tayal, Malay, Javanese, Battak, Mankassar, Bugis and Dayak; the suffix -an of Favorlang, with a similar -an in Tagal and Malagasy. We may add the infix -in- of Favorlang and Tayal, with a similar one in Tagal, Javanese, etc. The known prefix m- of the Malay dialects we find appearing as follows in the Formosan dialects:\n\nIn the case of verbs:\n- Favorlang . . . 80 %\n- Pepohwan . . . 75 \"\n- Buhican . . . 60 \"\n- Tsuihican . . . 50 \"\n\nIn the case of adjectives:\n- Pepohican . . . 100 %\n- Tsui-hican . . . 90 \"\n- Favorlang . . . 80 \"\n\nTayal . . . . 33 %\nSekhican . . . . 33 \"\nPelam . . . . 20 \"\nBuhuan . . . . 50 \"\nSekichan . . . . 25 \"\nPelam . . . . 25 \"\n\n107. In Tayal and Tsoo of North Formosa, class-prefixes fused with the word, K- or G-, M-, b- or p-, and l or r, are found in the vocabulary for all parts of the body. In Gyarung k-, b-, r- and t-, correspond in a general way, yet not in all the individual cases, because of the intervening causes of alteration on the two sides, with the similar k-, p-, l- and t- of the aforesaid Miao dialects of Kueitchou in\nChina. The uniformity of system between the Formosan dialects, several Miao languages of China and the Gyarung, is made evident therefrom.\n\n108. With regard to their ideology, hardly anything has been done excepting individual remarks. Therefore, making use of our convenient ideological indices, we are enabled to establish the following list, which shows their similarities and differences, as far as documents permit, and which I extract from my *Ideology of Languages and its Relation to History*:\n\n**FORMOSA:**\n\n| Language     | Order |\n|--------------|-------|\n| Favorlang    | 1 3 6 7 V. |\n| Tayal        | 1 3 6 7 V. |\n| Tsoo         | 2 4 6 7 V. |\n| Shobogala    | 2 4 6 0   |\n| Sideia       | 2 4 (6) 7 IV.

The above list is very telling, and will permit us to lead these long notes to a brief conclusion on a most difficult question, which I hope it contributes to elucidate.\n\nIt brings most important evidence that the dialects of Formosa, especially those of the North and West, are more closely related with a part of the former Non-Chinese population of Eastern China than with the modern Indonesian languages. This conclusion is supported by glossarial (\u00a7 102), morphological (\u00a7\u00a7 105\u2013107), affinities, similarities of customs (\u00a7 58), and also by anthropological craniometry, (\u00a7 59). But we must take into account the diversifications which have been undergone by these languages in their respective surroundings, since the bygone age of their former unity. The Gyarung, in its Tibeto-Chinese location, has been affected by Altaic languages: Mongol and Turk.\u00b9 On the other hand, the other languages have altered under the influence of a superimposition of languages of the same stem at various phases of their respective evolution; the Chinese influence has been at a minimum, and does not appear to have produced more than a change of position of the genitive, passing from Indice 2 to Indice 1. The Miao dialects have been influenced by the neighbouring tribes of the M\u00f4n-Khmer and Ta\u00ef-Shan families, while those of Formosa have mingled with emigrants from the Philippine\n\n\u00b9 Ideol. Ind., 1358 II.\nArchipelago and other islands. The Chinese influence there does not appear to have extended beyond their vocabulary.\n\n110. The following scheme of classification will permit us to apprehend the relative position of the Formosan dialects with the other languages, cognate in various degrees, belonging to the Indo-Pacific Stock of Languages, and the stray affinities which pervade them throughout, and give to their relationship a character so intricate.\n\n**INDO-PACIFIC Stock, including two divisions:**\n\nI. The Indo-Chinese subdivided into three branches:\n\n1) *M\u00f4n-Ta\u00efc*, including a) 7 Pre-Chinese dialects unmixed and mixed, and b) 11 Pre-Chinese dialects Hybridized and Hybrid.\n\n2) *M\u00f4n-Khmer*, including the a) Annamite or Cochinchinese, b) Palaong, c) Peguan, d) Khasi, e) Khmer group, f) Negrito Kamucks, etc., dialects.\n\n3) *Ta\u00efc-Shan*, including four groups, a) Pre-Chinese, b) Ahom, c) Shan, d) Loacian Siamese.\n\nII. The Inter-Oceanic, subdivided into four branches:\n\n1) *Indonesian*, including four groups, a) Pre-Chinese, b) Formosan, c) Tagalo-Malayan, d) Negrito-Aetas.\n\n2) *Micronesian* groups.\n\n3) *Polynesian* groups.\n\n4) *Melanesian* groups.\n\nThe dialects of Formosa may be provisionally subdivided as follows in three sections:\n\n*Tayal*\u2014Tsoo, Shabogala, Sibouken, Black Rock Bay, Kanagu, Paichien, etc.\n\n*Sideia*\u2014Sinkam, Tai-wan, Pepohwan Baksa, Kongana, Pelam, Banga, Bantanlang, Sau-o Bay, Samolei (?).\n\n*Favorlang*\u2014Tsui-hwan, Sekhwan, Buhwan, Bou\u00efok, Kali,

Keene, Esq.\n\nCommunicated through the Secretary R.A.S.\n\nIt is not without sincere diffidence that I venture to lay before Oriental scholars the following remarks. It is my misfortune to find myself constrained to oppose the conclusions of one who, when I first took up the question, was the most accepted authority on the subject\u2014the late Edward Thomas. That learned and distinguished man has recorded, in commenting on some former notes of mine (in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal\u00b9), that I treated the matter in so discursive a way that he was unable to catch my drift. On observing this, I wrote a fresh paper for the Royal Asiatic Society\u2014which has been unfortunately lost\u2014in which I strove to speak out in a manner that should leave no room for misconception. Unhappily Mr. Thomas is no more among us; and one is again in the old difficulty. A hesitating delivery of opinion, which was originally caused by deference to the justly-deserved reputation of the opposing advocate, is now, in a manner, called for by respect for the memory of the departed.\n\nBut magna est veritas; and the importance of the subject ought to be my excuse for saying that Mr. Thomas overestimated the Moghul revenues, and supported his estimates by untenable argument. I desire to say it, with unfeigned respect for his great labours; but I submit that, if only my opinion be right, it is one that ought to be expressed. It is not only of scientific importance to know the truth; the\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B. July, 1873 (vid. ibid. vol. i. pt. i. 1881).\nknowledge of it may have an exceedingly great political importance. It thus becomes necessary to state, as concisely as may be, the grounds on which I have been led to make these assertions.\n\nIn the first place, Mr. Thomas appears to assume that the rupee of those days is equivalent to two-twentieths of a pound sterling of English currency. Anglo-Indians know too well that such is certainly not now the case; but in point of fact it is only known to have been so during the first sixty years of the current century and a short preceding period when British commerce was beginning to work with weight upon Indian markets. In the reign of Aurangzeb, the last powerful Emperor, we learn from Manucci, the Italian physician, that a revenue of thirty-eight *krors* was at one moment\\(^1\\) realized, and that this sum was tantamount to five hundred and eighty millions of *livres*. In another place the same writer reports that the rupee was equal to thirty *sols*. So Tavernier, in estimating the value of \"The Great Table Diamond,\" tells us that it was \"priced at five hundred thousand rupees, or seven hundred and fifty thousand *livres* of our money.\" We have then to imagine what proportion to our pound was borne by the French *livre tournois* of that period, one and a half of which formed the equivalent of the rupee.\n\nFortunately we have, in Justice's *Moneys and Exchanges*, London, 1807, an exact account of the relation between the French and English money of those days.\\(^2\\) The pound sterling was \"an imaginary sum\" not coined, but expressing two hundred and forty pence: and fifty-four pence were equal in exchange to seventy-two sols. Hence the \"imaginary\" pound of two hundred and forty pence was equal to 320 *sols*, or 16 *livres tournois*; or, in other words, the *livre* was the sixteenth part of a pound sterling. Therefore the thirty-eight *krors*\u2014which made Aurangzeb's maximum budget\u2014were only equal to \u00a336,250,000; and the ordinary\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1697.\n\n\\(^2\\) The book is in the Bodleian, and I am indebted for its use to the kind information of Mr. Thorold Rogers. Justice gives the values of 1703.\nrevenue\u2014which was less both before and after\u2014must be reduced proportionally.\n\nIndia was bimetallic\u2014to some extent at least\u2014in the palmy days of the Moghul Empire. We learn from the *Ayin Akbari* that, about the end of the sixteenth century, there was in existence a gold coin (it must have been more in the nature of a stamped ingot, for it weighed $91\\frac{1}{4}$ tolas) worth one hundred \"round mohurs each weighing nearly as much as a rupee.\" Elsewhere we find that half a tola of gold was worth four rupees. This gives a ratio of $8 : 1$, just what was found in Japan when first opened to British commerce in 1860. During the seventeenth century the mines of South America poured silver into Europe, some of which must have found its way into India. According to the table given by Professor Bastable in the *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, from 1545 to 1680 the silver currency of Europe was increased by over eleven thousand millions of francs; say four hundred and fifty millions of pounds sterling. Owing to this cause, perhaps\u2014for some of the vast increase must have found Indian channels through Portugal and other countries\u2014the Empire had adopted a silver currency in the time of Aurangzeb.\n\nNext arises the question whether the estimates of our travellers represent the entire yearly receipts of the treasury, or whether they require to be increased\u2014doubled according to Thomas\u2014on account of receipts from other sources beside the land? For the proposed duplication no proof that I know of has ever been adduced. But I do not think that any addition whatever is to be made; and I believe that all legitimate articles of separate revenue are included in the estimates of contemporary Europeans, except where the contrary is distinctly expressed. No doubt more was paid, but it was not the revenue of the Empire. Some of the money collected stuck to the hands of the farmers and agents employed in the work. Other payments, in the form of gifts, fines and escheats, took place; but these were not made by the contributory in general, and were rather a part of the King's *peculium*, or Privy Purse, than a portion\nof the public fisc. During about half a century there was a poll-tax levied on the Hindus; but there are no means of knowing exactly what amount reached the Treasury under this head. It was probably not above four krors of rupees.\n\nI believe, further, that the revenue of the Empire rose, from one cause or another, from ten krors of rupees in Akbar's reign to whatever it reached in that of Aurangzeb; and that from about 1697 it again steadily declined. For the former estimate I cite 'Abul Fazl and Nizam-ud-din Ahmad, who were both fiscal officers of the Empire towards the end of Akbar's reign. The one says that all India, as ruled by the Moghul, yielded a revenue of \"640 krors of mur\u00e1di tankas\" annually; and mur\u00e1di tanka is a well-known accountant's way of describing copper coins of which sixty-four went to the rupee.\\(^1\\) The other, in the Akbarn\u00e1ma, gives detailed statements (which he calls taqsim-jamas), the total of which aggregates just under ten krors, inclusive of customs. It was to be expected that the two statements should agree; and I can see no reason for doubting that, in point of fact, they do. Coming to the reign of Akbar's son and successor, Jah\u00e1ngir, we are met with the view of a Dutch writer, J. de Laet, who is sometimes cited in support of a higher estimate. On this we need not linger; save to remark that de Laet was a mere compiler who had never been in India, and whose work abounds in errors. Hawkins, who puts the revenues of Jah\u00e1ngir at fifty krors, had local knowledge, but he was a mere mariner who is in direct opposition to an educated contemporary. Coryat, the eccentric but highly observant and intelligent Vicar of Odombe, who was in Hindustan at the same epoch, states distinctly that the income of the Empire was forty millions of crowns of six shillings each, say twelve millions. Hawkins's estimate is from land only;\n\n\\(^1\\) Thomas is much puzzled by the term mur\u00e1di tanka. But he himself shows elsewhere that the rupee was divisible by 64; and a coin of this value (called pais and weighing 100 grains of copper) continued to be struck in the name of the Emperor down to the present century.\nwhich we may see to be extravagant by this one consideration. If a drunken trifler like Jah\u00e1ngir could derive fifty *krors* from land alone, how was it that his avaricious and able successor admittedly raised no more than from twenty-two to twenty-six *krors* from a more extensive area? One contemporary\u2014the author of the *B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1ma*\u2014puts Sh\u00e1h Jahan's revenues as low as eighteen *krors*. Thevenot gives the revenue in 1666 as 376,000,000 *livres*; and Ramusio in 1707, after the annexation of the Deccan and the imposition of the poll-tax,\\(^1\\) at thirty *krors*. It is therefore just possible that, ten years earlier, a maximum budget of thirty-eight *krors* may have been raised, as Manucci believed.\n\nThere is this obvious danger in forming excessive estimates on this subject, that we never can tell what nonsense might be stated, in Parliament or by the press, as to the capacity of the country. India is a very poor country, and its people are not represented in the Government. If, therefore, it were really believed that, with all the subsequent fall of money, the British rulers of India did not raise anything like the same (nominal) amount that was raised by the unscientific Turks of two or three centuries ago, pressure might well come, fraught with the most disastrous consequences. It has been laid down that the Moghul revenues rose, at last, to eighty millions of pounds sterling. What that would be equal to in modern money I do not exactly pretend to know. But it would be a sum the attempt to levy which could only end in some form of ruin.\n\n\\(^1\\) The poll-tax was imposed in 1677, and the Deccan annexed in 1688. These two sources combined may have added eleven *krors* to the revenue of 1666. But the Empire was in disorder by that time.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(March, April, May.)\n\nI. REPORTS OF MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY, SESSION 1886-87.\n\nFifth Meeting, 21st March, 1887.\u2014Col. H. Yule, R.E., C.B., President, in the Chair.\n\nElections: Messrs. C. Capper and Holt L. Hallett, Resident Members.\n\nAfter referring to the recent deaths of Sir Walter Elliot and Mr. Alexander Wylie, two distinguished Orientalists, the former of whom had been a member of the Society for about half a century, the President called upon Professor Douglas, in the absence of the author, to read Mr. Colborne Baber's paper on \"Nine Formosa MSS.\" It described a batch of MSS. received from the island of Formosa, and obtained by the Rev. W. Campbell within the last three years, from the Pepohwan tribe, at one of the villages in the low-lying hill region eastward from Taiwanfoo. These Pepohwans had lost all knowledge of the language represented in the documents. They had removed inland to their present settlements some eighty years ago, their own ancestral territory being what was known under the Dutch occupation as the township of Sink-kan, a name still preserved in the large Chinese market-town of Sinkang, about 21 li (7 miles) N.N.E. of the city of Taiwanfoo.\u2014Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie followed Professor Douglas in remarking upon the MSS. described, and read some notes in connection with the subject which, together with Mr. Baber's paper, would be prepared for publication in the Journal.\u2014Sir Thomas Wade, Mr. H. Howorth, M.P., and others took part in the brief discussion which ensued; and the President, before closing the proceedings, expressed the thanks of the meeting to the authors of the papers.\n\nSixth Meeting, 18th April, 1887.\u2014Col. H. Yule, R.E., C.B., President, in the Chair.\nElections: Professor W. Robertson Smith and Mr. William Simpson, Resident Members; the Rev. A. Sell, Professor Montet, and MM. Henderson and Wheeler, Non-Resident Members.\n\nProfessor Henri Cordier was invited to read a brief memoir which he had prepared on the \"Life and Writings of Alexander Wylie.\" As the paper appears in extenso in the current number of the Journal, the present Report will be confined to the remarks of speakers on the subject put before the Meeting.\u2014Sir Thomas Wade, being called on by the President, replied that he should indeed feel himself culpable were he to remain silent. The last paragraph of Professor Cordier's memoir, in which the many proofs of the late Mr. Wylie's learning and industry were enumerated, had rendered it unnecessary that more should be attempted in that direction, and had indeed disposed of such matter as it might be deemed was more particularly within the province of the Society. Still, having known Mr. Wylie for upwards of thirty years, he should be unwilling to allow this opportunity to pass of bearing testimony to his possession of those qualities which had helped to make Mr. Wylie's labours so valuable; his courageous truthfulness, his generosity, and his modesty. He was essentially a self-taught man; recoiling before no difficulty; assailing it the moment he conceived that it was expedient to surmount it, with the first means that came to hand; though, commencing so many studies as he did, not in early youth but at a comparatively mature age, it was impossible but that his scholarship should in some instances be defective. Even as a Chinese scholar he is not perhaps to be placed on the first line. But the reader may be always sure that the subject treated of in any work of Mr. Wylie's has been conscientiously explored. The most valuable of his achievements, in Sir Thomas Wade's opinion, was his Notes on Chinese Literature. This is the first introduction to the literature of China of anything like the same extent and importance, and in almost any other country but England would hardly have escaped, if not official recognition, at least academical distinction. That it is less known than it deserves to be, however, is in part due, no doubt, to Mr. Wylie's modesty. He could never bear to hear himself praised without protesting.\n\nMr. W. Lockhart spoke as follows:\u2014I am deeply interested in having the opportunity to express my admiration for my late friend and colleague, Alexander Wylie, with whom I have always been closely connected from the time, when, in 1846, I received him at\nWoosung, and took him and the other friends who had voyaged with him from England, up the river to Shanghai. I fully endorse all that has now been said by M. Cordier and Sir Thomas Wade, and would emphatically commend the \"Notes on Chinese Literature\" as an indispensable help to all Chinese students. The labour spent on this book was immense, and the more it is known, the more highly will it be estimated. I had the pleasure of introducing Sir Emerson Tennant to Mr. Wylie. Having translated some passages in Chinese books for this gentleman's History of Ceylon, and finding that he needed further research made; I advised him to apply to Mr. Wylie, who signally helped him in completing his very valuable and useful work. In the same way I had the honour of introducing him to you, Mr. President, when for your great work on Marco Polo, you wanted information from Chinese sources, which as you know he so well supplied. In conclusion, I would thank you, Mr. President, for enabling me to express before this Society my feeling of great regard for the memory of one with whom I was so long associated, and whom I sincerely esteemed and loved.\n\nThe Very Rev. Dr. Butcher, formerly of Shanghai, added:\u2014When one rises to speak on an Oriental topic in the presence of Sir Thomas Wade, one resembles in temerity the man who lectured on the Art of War in the presence of Hannibal. But I feel that I should be neglecting a duty if I failed to add a tribute to the memory of the distinguished man whom I knew for 17 years in Shanghai. I cannot speak of him so fully as Sir Thomas could do, for he was more closely connected with him than I was, but we were often together at the meetings of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and though others more competent than I am can speak to the vastness of his erudition, I yield to none in estimation of his high character, his simplicity, his purity of motive, his deep devotion to duty. I can only say of him as was said of a good man lately taken from us: \"There is no marble white enough to form a monument to his memory.\"\n\nSome feeling words were added by the President, who bore testimony, from his own personal knowledge, to the value of Mr. Wylie's labours, and his worth of character: thanks were then passed to M. Cordier for his interesting memoir.\n\nSeventh Meeting, 2nd May, 1887.\u2014Sir Thomas Wade, K.C.B., Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nElection: M. Enrico Vitto, Vice-Consul at Aleppo of H.M. the King of Italy, as Non-Resident Member.\nSurgeon-General Bellew read selections from a paper which he had prepared for the Society under the title of \"Notes on the Names borne by some of the Tribes of Afghanistan.\" Commencing with the statement that the country now called Afghanistan was hardly known by that name until the establishment of the Afghan monarchy in the middle of the last century, he pointed to the fact that the new kingdom then created by the Abdali chieftain was not called the Afghan kingdom at all. Ahmad Khan Sadozi was crowned at Kandahar, not as sovereign of the nation, but as king of the Dur\u00e1ni people, who, in representing the ancient Drang\u00e6 of Drangiana, revived an apparently obsolete name. After referring to the little that was known of the Afghans, and briefly alluding to the increase of our knowledge regarding them and their country through the means of embassies, followed by war, military occupation, and partial annexation of their country, he proceeded to notice the names borne by some of the tribes now found in Afghanistan, offering suggestions for their identification with peoples bearing similar names, of whom mention is made in the works of ancient Greek and Latin authors. Of the two countries spoken of by Herodotus under the name Pactyica, one, on the western borders of Persia, comprised the Armenians, with the contiguous nations as far as the Euxine; the other, on the eastern frontier of Persia, bounded by the Indus, comprised the Sattagydae, the Dadik\u00e6, and the Aparyte\u00e6. From the application of the name to two countries of similar physical conformation, situated at opposite extremes of the Persian empire, he advanced the conjecture that this similarity of geographical aspect possessed in common by both was significative of the meaning of the name itself, and that this notion appeared to be confirmed by the names which these two regions have respectively borne in subsequent times, as well as by the names applied collectively to the inhabitants of each, even up to the present day. Reviving an old discussion carried on by writers in the past century, on the affinity of Afghan and Armenians, Dr. Bellew, moreover, entered into an elaborate definition of the name Afgh\u00e1n as derived from the Armenian Alw\u00e1n or Alb\u00e1n, written \"Aghv\u00e1n,\" and referred to the close connection which formerly existed between the Eastern and Western provinces of Ancient Persia, as also to the fact that, during the reign of Cyrus, and the reigns of his immediate\n\n1 \u1f08\u03c0\u1f78 \u03a0\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, . . . \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1.

After a brief notice of the different nations mentioned by Herodotus as comprising the several Satrapies of Persia, the lecturer observed that these names probably referred only to the dominant people in those satrapies with which they were associated, citing as evidence in point a passage in Alexander's history tending to show that there were in those days other tribes amongst the Aparyt\u00e6\u2014the modern Afridi\u2014who are not mentioned by the Father of History. The concluding part of the paper was taken up with short notes on tribes supposed to be of Greek descent, and on others representing the Persian inhabitants of the country.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson, admitting the pains taken to make good the proposition, stated that he could not recognise the mode in which the conclusions had been reached as convincing, or exemplifying the true principle of appreciation. The subject, however, was one of considerable interest.\u2014Dr. Stein followed with some remarks and illustrations, and thanks were passed to Surgeon-General Bellew for his paper.\n\nEighth and Anniversary Meeting, 9th May, 1887.\u2014Sir Thomas Wade, K.C.B., Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nThe President's written Address having been read by the Honorary Secretary, and the Report by the Secretary (see page i to vi), the adoption of the Report was proposed by Mr. G. W. Rusden, seconded by Mr. E. Delmar-Morgan, and carried nem. con.\n\nMr. Habib Anth. Salmon\u00e9 took the opportunity of the discussion opened to say a few words on a subject which he had before touched upon in a paper read to the Society, and printed in the Journal. He expressed the hope that, before long, the movement on behalf of the study of Oriental languages, referred to in the President's address, might have some definite and practical result, like the establishment of a special school or schools on the plan of those so successfully conducted on the continent, or in any other more convenient form. Why, he asked, should there not be in London\u2014connected, if thought advisable, with the Imperial Institute\u2014an Oriental college or school which might be held available to all classes of the community? Would not the founding of such an Institution be a very proper way of commemorating the Jubilee of the Empress of India, and was not this Society peculiarly fitted and qualified to take the lead in a matter of the kind?\nMr. Hyde Clarke continued the discussion, and was of opinion that the Asiatic Society had much in its power for promoting the cause of Oriental research. As regards any scheme to be put in execution with this particular object, he laid stress upon the provision that it should be of a practical character, tending to the pupil's advancement in political and commercial knowledge, as well as in literature.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson observed that the Society had always entertained a strong feeling on the advantages of Oriental teaching in England, and its duty would be to support any reasonable measures taken for the formation of an institution like that foreshadowed by the previous speakers. Any suggestion that could be given them on the subject would meet with the most careful attention of himself and colleagues on the Council. This was a wealthy country, and its interests in the East were immense. It seemed strange, therefore, that it should possess no State-recognised institution for promoting the study of Eastern languages and literature. Referring to the then Chairman, as newly elected President of the Society, Sir Henry Rawlinson congratulated the Members on the selection that had been made. He trusted that during the presidency of the distinguished gentleman, whom he was not only satisfied, but proud to see in the post occupied\u2014some distinct move might be made in the direction indicated. He gladly availed himself of this occasion, to wish their new President every success, and to assure him that his Council were prepared to aid him in his task to the utmost of their ability. In conclusion, he expressed a hope that Sir Thomas Wade would leave the Society in a position similar to that which it occupied in olden days, when presided over by intellectual giants; and that it might continue to compete with, if not surpass, other institutions of its class in usefulness and merit.\n\nSir Thomas Wade said that, in the absence of the retiring President, he would address a few words to the Meeting. He was sure that all present deplored the absence of Colonel Yule, and they could hardly break up without recording their unanimous feeling of regret at his inability to come among them. It was unnecessary for him to recall the many practical merits of Colonel Yule, or to refer to the vast range of his acquirements. His thoroughness, his assiduity, his devotedness to his office and all the duties of life, were well known to all. While one of those distinguished scholars to whom so much is owing by the world at large, he was at the same time a great credit to the land of which he was naturally proud.\nDr. Cust, in proposing a vote of thanks to their late President, observed that Colonel Yule had been constantly called upon to take an active part during his term of office, and the duties he had had to perform were very onerous. He had, however, conducted the work with great advantage to the Society, whose Members must deeply regret the cause of his absence on this occasion.\n\nMr. H. Howorth, M.P., in seconding the motion, urged that the Society would do well to formulate questions, and send them to be worked out by certain select men in India. He would wish to see it undertake translations from the Russian and other languages. Especially, in conjunction with the Royal Geographical Society, did he think great service might be rendered by this means to the cause of literature.\n\nThe vote was cordially and unanimously passed, and the proceedings terminated with the announcement that the Annual Dinner would be held that day in the Criterion at 7.30 p.m.\n\nII. PROCEEDINGS OF ASIATIC OR ORIENTAL SOCIETIES.\n\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, 1st December, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President, in the Chair.\n\nTwenty-eight presentations were announced, and the election of an Associate Member, one death, and two withdrawals notified.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited two gold and three silver coins, presented by the Bombay Branch of the R.A.S. The former were stated to be known as the Hun coins of Bijapur, the emblems of which had not been interpreted. They were described as of inferior gold, and had been referred to by Marsden and Tavernier, though neither date nor reign had been assigned. A Report was also read on a find of 405 old coins in the Maldah District\u2014all silver rupees of periods between A.D. 1719 and 1806.\n\nOf the papers read, one was entitled, \"On probable Changes in the Geography of the Panjab and its Rivers,\" and another, \"Notes on Indian Rhynchota.\"\n\n5th January, 1887.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President, in the Chair.\n\nThirty-two presentations were announced, and a re-election of an ordinary Member, and two withdrawals notified.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited four ancient copper coins presented by Kaviraj Shyamal Das of Udaipur, and read a report on 67 round silver rupees, found in the Sag\u00e1r district, of periods between A.D. 1556 and 1707.\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra read the extract of a letter he had received from Professor Max M\u00fcller, asking information as to whether in reference to the word ekotibh\u00e1va, analogies were found in Sanskrit for \"the contraction eka ko\u1e6di into ekoti,\" illustrated in English by wholly for wholely, and in Latin, by nutrix for nutritix. He himself had no hesitation in saying that \"the changes by which eka ko\u1e6dibh\u00e1va can be reduced to ekotibh\u00e1va cannot be accounted for by any rule, general or special, in the Sanskrit Grammars.\" Apart from Grammar, he had \"ransacked the wide field of Sanskrit vocables, but with no better result.\"\n\nThe papers read were a \"Note on the Rice-juice sapper of Madras;\" an \"Account of the Ancient Town of Nagari, apparently the capital of Meyw\u00e1r before Chitor was built,\" with three inscriptions attached; a \"Brief Account of Tibet,\" from \"Dsam Ling Gyeshe,\" the well-known geographical work of \"Lama Tsanpo Nomankhan of Amdo,\" and two more in the Natural History Department.\n\nChina Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Shanghai, 30th November, 1886.\u2014Dr. F. Hirth, President, in the Chair.\n\nIt was announced that seventeen new Members had been elected since the last meeting.\n\nA paper by Mr. Herbert Allen, under the title, \"Is Confucius a Myth?\" was read by the Ven. Archdeacon Moule, and provoked a lively criticism. The speakers were the Rev. Ernest Faber, Archdeacon Moule, Dr. Williamson, the Rev. Mr. Muirhead, and Messrs. Ting and Playfair, all clearly believers in the Philosopher's existence. Notwithstanding the one-sided character of the discussion, the Chairman remarked that the Meeting had been fortunate in hearing the opinions of recognised authorities on the subject mooted. The papers will be found noted among the contents of the Society's Journal.\n\n16th December, 1886.\u2014Dr. R. A. Jamieson, Vice-President, in the chair. After notification of the election of four new Members, a paper was read by Dr. D. J. Macgowan on \"Chinese Guilds or Chambers of Commerce and Trades Unions.\" Some notion of its merits may be obtained from the laudatory observations of the speakers in the discussion which followed the reading, one of whom said: \"All would agree that a more interesting paper had not been read before the Society for many years. It was such papers as Dr. Macgowan's that they would like more particularly to have in the Society.\" A vote of thanks to the author was\ncarried by acclamation, and reference made by the Chairman to the instructive remarks it had elicited from other members present. Further allusion to it will be made in the notice of the Shanghai Journal.\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, Paris, 14th January, 1887.*\u2014M. E. R\u00e9nan, President, in chair. After the election of seven new Members, M. Hal\u00e9vy gave some account of the Semitic word *ra\u1e63am*; M. Berger communicated the results of his investigation of the Neo-Punic inscription of Altiburos; and M. Pognon described a Punic inscription on an ancient dish found at Tripoli, in Barbary, the authenticity of which he had no reason to doubt.\n\n*11th February, 1887.*\u2014M. E. R\u00e9nan, President, in the chair. Three new Members were elected. M. Berger traced an apparent analogy between a Neo-Punic inscription recently discovered at Delos with that presented at the last meeting by M. Pognon, M. Hal\u00e9vy dwelling on a particular word he had himself interpreted in the former. The result of his further studies of this class of inscriptions was also stated by M. Berger.\n\n*11th March, 1887.*\u2014M. E. R\u00e9nan, President, in the chair. The death was notified of M. l'Abb\u00e9 Girard, a scholar who had published a translation of the Psalms from the Hebrew text, and left a manuscript rendering of the Rig Veda from the Sanskrit. M. Oppert presented the translation of a Babylonian tablet of Nabuchodonosor regarding a slave named Barichel. M. Graff made a statement on the formation of Egyptian proper names; and further communications were addressed to the meeting by M. Clermont Ganneau, M. Zotenberg, and M. Berger.\n\n### III. CORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. **Buddhist Remains at Gun\u1e6dupalle.**\n\n*Masulipatam, 5th March, 1887.*\n\nSir,\n\nThe following note on newly-discovered Buddhist remains may interest the readers of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal:\n\nThe Ordnance Survey Map of the God\u0101vari District of the Madras Presidency shows a group of hills about twenty miles north of Ellorc, a large town situated between the God\u0101vari and Krishna Rivers, just at the spot where the irrigation areas of both rivers meet, and a few miles north of the large drainage lake known\nas the K\u014dl\u0113ru (Anglic\u00e9 Colair). On the west side of a small ravine running upwards into these low hills from the cultivated plain is a group of rock-cut remains, regarding which very little has as yet been made known to the public. So far as I am aware, nothing was known of them till 1881, when I alluded to them in my Lists of Antiquities, Madras (vol. i. pp. 35, 36), the only information at my disposal being the following. A native correspondent first wrote of some remains at Gun\u1e6dupalle, stating that there was a temple here cut into the hill-side. \"The roof of the temple was so artfully carved as to form rafters and reepers. In the centre of the temple there is a square stone pavement of four yards length and one yard height. On this pavement there is a dome of one yard and a quarter height; a lingam was constructed on this dome. On each side of the temple at distances of 100 and 70 yards the hill was cut into walls and halls of forty yards length and six yards breadth. In one of these halls there is a small cave through which the water with which the lingam has been bathed is said to have come formerly. There is a Hindu festival here every year at the \u015aivar\u0101ttri.\" To this I added the note: \"From the description given above it might fairly be conjectured that the remains are those of a rock-cut Buddhist monastery and chaitya, with a D\u0101goba in the centre of the latter under a vaulted roof. At any rate it should be carefully examined.\" Shortly after this I received a letter from Dr. W. King of the Geological Survey, telling me of some remains at N\u0101galapalle, in the same range of hills. His description led me in my Lists to enter the remains as different from those at Gun\u1e6dupalle, but I afterwards came to the conclusion that the place he referred to was the same as that at Gun\u1e6dupalle, and personal inspection shows that it was so. The confusion arose from the temple being located by different writers in different villages.\n\nOn my return to duty, after furlough, in October of last year, having been posted to the Krish\u1e47\u0101 (\"Kistna\") District, I took advantage in the Christmas holidays to see these temples for myself. Inspection proves the group to be, as was supposed, pure Buddhist, and though it is probably of no architectural importance, being merely a replica of well-known forms further north, its interest lies in the fact that it is the only group of the kind yet known to exist in the Madras Presidency. As the mere fact of its existence at a point so far South may interest the readers of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal, I have put together these few notes regarding it. My friends, Mr. W. C. de Morgan and Mr. H. Moss, both skilled in engineering\nwork, very kindly drew the plans, while I made the accompanying rough sketches, in the hope that by means of these crude illustrations, all doubt as to the nature of the remains in question might be removed. [See Illustrations 1 and 2 attached.]\n\nGun\u1e6dupalle is a small village in a very out-of-the-way tract, the route to which runs along a road north of Ellore for twenty-one miles to the old foot of K\u0101mavarapuk\u014d\u1e6da (fair tope for camping) and thence, on a village field-path five miles due west to the base of a line of low hills which forms the southern boundary of a somewhat extensive patch of forest-land. The ravine already mentioned leads from the plain northwards into the forest, and is shut in by a ridge that connects the two scarps. Ascending a rough rocky stairway at the head of the little ravine, the visitor turns to the left and finds himself in front of the Chaitya cave. This is a small circular chamber, with a simple fa\u00e7ade somewhat resembling the more elaborately decorated \"Lomas Rishi\" cave in Behar, but with one striking difference. The jambs of both inner and outer doorways of that cave slope outwards from top to bottom; here the inner door-jambs slope inwards from the top, following the curve of the outer horse-shoe arch in its lower half, while the outer door-jambs are perpendicular. Above the inner door is a projecting roof-like member, similar to that in the Lomas Rishi and other caves.\n\nThe chamber is circular, having a domed roof with sixteen deep ribs and three concentric bands, apparently intended to represent the under-side of the sacred umbrella. Occupying almost the entire space of the chamber, and leaving a space of only one foot and a half width all round, for pradak\u1e63ha\u1e47a, is the dagoba, seven feet high. On its summit is, as described by my native correspondent, an object resembling a li\u1e45ga. This may be accounted for in two ways. It is, perhaps, possible that the Tec in this case was not a portion of the dagoba itself, cut out of the solid rock, but that it was lifted to the summit of the dagoba on occasions of ceremony, and held in its place by this solid stone pin. On the other hand, it is remarkable that in one of the T\u016blja L\u0113pa group of Buddhist remains near Junn\u0101r, to which group Dr. Burgess especially likens these Gun\u1e6dupalle caves, one of the chaityas presents,\n\n---\n\n1 Fergusson's History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, p. 109. Cave Temples of India (Fergusson and Burgess), p. 39.\n2 Indian Antiquary, vol. vi. p. 33, Memorandum on the Buddhist Caves at Junn\u0101r (Burgess).\npassage, viz., \"at the base from knee to knee of the crossed legs,\" but as this would make a seated cross-legged figure ten times as high as the space between the points of the knees, it is obvious that Fa-hien cannot have intended to give the expression any such acquired meaning. Besides, the literal translation of the words is all that is required to make their significance perfectly plain. In the several Greek and Buddhist statues which I have measured, I find the proportion of the instep to the height of the figure to be the same as that given by Fa-hien, viz. one-tenth. And anatomically this is correct.\n\nROBERT K. DOUGLAS.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIV. OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nOnly in the second year of his membership, the Society has to regret the loss of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Nicolau da Fonseca, President of the Sociedade dos Amigos das Letras in Goa, a Portuguese gentleman of considerable literary attainments. His death occurred before the close of last year, but was not notified for some months later. An instructive volume from his pen, containing \"an historical and arch\u00e6ological sketch of the city of Goa,\" was presented to the Library of the Society by the author, through our late President, Colonel Yule.\n\nAlexander Wylie.\u00b9\u2014It is with deep regret we record the death of Mr. Alexander Wylie, whose name is well known, both in Europe and the United States, wherever the Chinese language has been studied. One of the most modest and unobtrusive of men, he was at the same time persevering and earnest, as well as intelligent in carrying out all work in which he was engaged, whether in the study or the printing office; and it was the combination of these qualities that won for him the regard and esteem of all who knew him, and enabled him to do the large amount of work he accomplished, both in China and afterwards in England. He was also an unselfish man, always desiring to help others in every way that was possible; and many are under great obligations to him, in respect especially to philological work. He was born on the 6th April, 1815, in London; to which city his father had come from Scotland, towards the close of the last century, settling in business in Drury Lane. He was educated partly in Scotland,\n\n\u00b9 Communicated by W. Lockhart, Esq.\nwhere his early life was spent, and partly in London. Apprenticed, when old enough, to a cabinet maker, he passed, while in this business, some months at Hatfield, restoring the library at Hatfield House, which had been considerably damaged by a fire. He was also much engaged in seeking out and selecting old carvings in wood, and travelled in Germany and France, in pursuit of objects of this character; afterwards recombined and formed into various articles of beauty and taste. In speaking of Mr. Wylie, it is impossible to separate his religious life from his ordinary life, as with him religion was at all times the inspiring motive.\n\nAt this time he became a member of the Church of Scotland, attending the place of worship in Crown Court. Having entertained a strong desire to go to China, presumably as a missionary, he devoted himself assiduously to the study of Chinese. Dr. Legge, alluding to this part of our friend's life, says that he called on him in 1846 wishing to obtain more guidance in the prosecution of the knowledge of that language, and in the course of conversation it transpired, that having obtained at a book stall Pr\u00e9mare's *Notitia Linguae Sinica*, he had learned Latin so as to be able to understand it, and had become deeply interested in the subject. He afterwards obtained a New Testament in Chinese, and endeavoured with much success to gain a knowledge of the meaning of its characters. He also put together in the form of a vocabulary all the words he had so laboriously acquired, and the little dictionary thus formed is a relic of great interest, and is reverently kept as a testimony of his untiring assiduity. It so happened that the Delegates of various English and American Missionary Societies were engaged on what is called the Delegates' Version of the New Testament in Chinese, the British and Foreign Bible Society having engaged to print the book. Dr. Legge was anxious to procure the services of a man to take charge of the London Missionary Society's printing office in Shanghai, where the work was to be done, and eventually Mr. Wylie was engaged and sent to the office of Sir Charles Reed, to study printing for several months, preparatory to his going to China as the paid agent of the London Missionary Society. The printing of the Sacred Scriptures, however, was done at the cost of the Bible Society, and from 1855 to 1861 that Society paid Mr. Wylie's salary. He left England April 6, 1847; arrived at Shanghai August 26, 1847, and at once entered on the work of the printing office.\n\nHe was married to Miss Mary Hanson in 1848. She had been a\nmissionary in Kaffirland for seven years, but had been obliged to return to England on account of the war. She followed Wylie to China, and they were married at Shanghai, but she died the following year, 1849, leaving him with a daughter a few days old, who was early sent to England to the care of relatives. About 1860 he was the means, in conjunction with the Rev. Dr. Edkins, of establishing at Shanghai the local branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, at whose meetings he read a number of valuable papers, on various subjects in which he was deeply interested, as the list of his writings appended sufficiently testifies. He left Shanghai in November, 1860, arriving in England in February, 1861. In 1863 he returned to China as the agent of the Bible Society, for the organization of plans to forward the circulation of the Sacred Scriptures in Chinese throughout the country. He travelled by way of St. Petersburg through Siberia to Peking. On arriving at Peking he was asked by Mr. Lockhart what he thought of the inscription on the Archway in the pass at Kiu-yung kwan, in which he had formerly been so much interested. He said he did pass through an archway, in the dusk of the evening, but did not notice the inscription on the walls, and was much astonished that he should thus unconsciously have passed through the place he had so long wished to see. Letters had been sent to Kiachta, to tell him exactly the position of the place, but they had missed him. The first thing he did was to get men to return with him to obtain rubbings of the Inscription, a work which after great exertion, then, and on a later visit in 1867, with the help of Dr. Edkins, was successfully accomplished. These form the series of the Kiu yung kwan Inscriptions, now in the British Museum, and which are described in the paper for the R.A.S. on this subject, the title of which is in the List. Wylie was the first Englishman of our time who came to Peking via Russia and Siberia. He arrived at Shanghai in November, 1863, and spent the next fourteen years in the service of the Bible Society. His head-quarters during this period were there with his friends, the Rev. Wm. Muirhead, and Rev. J. Thomas, but he took extensive journeys into the interior, arranging his work, and also twice visited Japan. In 1868 he took a long journey, in company with the Rev. Griffith John, through the then almost unknown provinces of Hoopih, Sze-chuen, and Shensi. In this way at various times, he travelled in seventeen of the eighteen Provinces of China, carrying on his work as long as possible, both by personal effort, and by superintending and directing the labours of several foreigners and\nnatives connected with him; and what he undertook was thoroughly and effectually done.\n\nIn 1877, on account of failure of eyesight, Wylie returned to England, and, retiring from active labour, settled at Hampstead, where he resided till his death. His daughter, who now for the first time found a home with him, was his nurse, companion, and helper during all the time of his blindness and illness.\n\nHe was taken ill in 1883, became totally blind, and gradually very feeble, and for the last two years was entirely confined to his room. He was always placid and cheerful, and did not suffer pain. Towards the last his mind used to wander very much, and generally reverted to the active scenes of his earlier life. He peacefully died February 6th, 1887.\n\nSir Thomas Wade writes: \"A better man I think I never knew, whether in what he laid down to be done, or what he did in his own province of Sinology. In both Bibliography and Archaeology he was greatly valued, and I have heard scholars of note admit their obligations to him. Colonel Yule is perhaps the one of whom I am thinking more particularly. I wish thus to show my respect and regard for the man himself.\" Dr. Legge, after eulogising his various writings, concludes by saying: \"In social life he was eminently blameless, and helpful to very many, never seeking his own things, but only the promotion of the great object to which he had consecrated his life. He made many friends, and not a single enemy. Few have more fully realised the ideal of a self-made man.\" Of him it might truly be said, as of Nathaniel, the Israelite, that he was one \"indeed in whom was no guile.\" He was faithful and true to his Christian profession, whilst occupying a foremost rank as a Chinese scholar.\n\n**Works in Chinese and Translations.**\n\nArithmetic for the Young, 1853.\nDe Morgan's Algebra, 1858.\nLoomis's Geometry and Differential and Integral Calculus, 1859.\nEuclid's Elements of Geometry.

The first, on the Tseen Han Shoo, is the history of China, during the two centuries before Christ by Pan Koo. The first and second chapters are about the Heung-noo, whose ancestor was the great Yu founder of the Hia Dynasty. They were a nomad race, probably the ancestors of the Eastern Turks.\n\nThe other chapters deal with the tribes of South and South-Western China and Corea, also Thibet, Yarkand, Khotan, and Kashgar. This volume is complete, and appeared in the Anthropological Society's Journal.\n\nThe History of the How (or After) Han embraces the period A.D. 25 to 220, and takes up the history where the Tseen Han left it, written by Fan-ye; it treats of the tribes and nations on the North-East seaboard of China, and the territory now known as Manchuria and Corea. Also of the subjugation of the various tribes in the South, bringing them under the control of the rulers of China. Three chapters have been published in Monsieur Cordier's Revue de l'Extr\u00eame Orient, 1882. The fourth chapter, treating of Western regions, Rome and India, also of the introduction of Buddhism into China, is finished in manuscript, and it is hoped that the whole may yet be published in one volume.\n\nAs an instance of the indomitable perseverance of Mr. Wylie, it is thought suitable to give briefly an account of the way in which the above was written during his constantly increasing blindness. The first part of the Tseen Han was written in China, and as he was very desirous of completing the second part, he taught his daughter to find characters in the dictionary.\n\nAs his blindness increased, she wrote characters she could not find in the dictionary in large size, and he tried to recognize them\nwith more or less success; but by and bye, when he became quite blind, she had to draw the characters on his hand, and he would thus manage to find out what they were. When a certain number had been found, she would read them out altogether, and he translated the sentence, and she then wrote it down. In this way the chapters were translated, at the rate of two pages of Chinese text a day, as often as he was well enough to work.\n\nAny Chinese scholar can easily understand how difficult it must have been for a blind man thus to translate a work such as that above described.\n\nWe have to record with great regret the death of Sir Walter Elliot, K.C.S.I., LL.D. and F.R.S.,\u00b9 for half a century a Member of this Society, which occurred at Wolfel\u00e9e, near Hawick, on the 1st of March last. An obituary notice would have appeared in the last number of this Journal, had the time available admitted of the preparation of such an account of the leading facts of his career as appeared to be called for, alike by his distinguished public services, and by the literary and scientific work which formed one of the chief interests in his busy and useful life.\n\nWalter Elliot was born in Edinburgh on the 16th January, 1803. He was the son of James Elliot, of Wolfel\u00e9e, Roxburghshire, a member of a junior branch of the old Border family of Elliot of Lariston, and through his mother, Caroline Hunter, he was a great-grandson of the Earl of Cromartie, who forfeited his title and estates in 1745. Walter Elliot's early education was conducted, partly in Cumberland by the Rev. James Traill, afterwards a Government Chaplain in the Madras Presidency, and partly at home under a private tutor, after which he spent some years at a school at Carr House, near Doncaster, under the Rev. P. Inchbald, D.D. In 1818 he was sent to Haileybury College, having obtained a writership in the service of the East India Company at Madras. He reached India on the 14th June, 1821, and two years later was appointed to the public service, after having been granted the honorary reward of 1000 pagodas for proficiency in the Tamil and Hindustani languages. His first appointment appears to have been that of Assistant to the Collector and Magistrate of Salem; but very shortly afterwards he was transferred to the Southern Mahratta country, then administered by the Government of Madras, and was appointed an Assistant to the Principal Collector and Political Agent, Mr. St. John Thackeray, continuing to serve in the Southern Mahratta country,\n\n\u00b9 Communicated by Sir A. Arbuthnot, K.C.S.I.\nchiefly at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, until 1833, when he returned to England on furlough. In the first year of his service in that part of India, he was present at the insurrection at Kitt\u00far, when the Political Agent, Mr. Thackeray, and three officers of a troop of Madras Horse Artillery, sent there to maintain order, and a large number of the men, were killed; Walter Elliot and Stevenson, a brother Assistant, being made prisoners, and detained for several weeks in the hands of the insurgents, at great peril of their lives. In the latter part of Elliot's service in the Southern Mahratta country, that territory, which it had been intended to retain under the Madras Presidency, was annexed permanently to Bombay, and Elliot, in the ordinary course, would have been re-transferred to a Madras district, but at the special request of Sir John Malcolm, then Governor of Bombay, he was allowed to remain until he left India on furlough. During the nine years that he spent in the Bombay Presidency, Elliot made several journeys in Western India, meeting Mr. Mountstuart Elphinstone at Satt\u00e1ra in 1826, and Sir John Malcolm at B\u00edfjap\u00far in 1828. He also made a tour in Gujar\u00e1t in 1832. Leaving Bombay on the 11th December, 1833, in company with Mr. Robert Pringle, of the Bombay Civil Service, he returned to Europe by way of the Red Sea, landing at Kosseir, and riding across the Egyptian desert to Thebes, whence, taking the Nile route as far as Cairo, he crossed into Palestine, and was present in company with the late Hon. Robert Curzon, the author of 'The Monasteries of the Levant,' at the exhibition of the Holy Fire in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, when so many people were killed (Curzon's Monasteries of the Levant, ch. 16). After visiting Constantinople, Athens, Corinth, Corfu and Rome, he reached England on the 5th May, 1835. In the autumn of the following year he again embarked for India as Private Secretary to his relative, Lord Elphinstone, who had been appointed Governor of Madras, and the remainder of his Indian service was spent in the Madras Presidency. In conjunction with the Private Secretaryship, he held the appointments of Member of the Board of Revenue and of Translator to Government in the Canarese language, officiating as Secretary to Government in the Revenue Department during the last few months of Lord Elphinstone's government.\n\nDuring the years immediately succeeding Lord Elphinstone's retirement from the Government, which took place in 1842, Elliot was employed upon the ordinary duties of a member of the Board of Revenue; but in 1845 he was deputed to investigate the condition of Gunt\u00far, one of the districts commonly known as the\nNorthern Sirk\u00e1rs, where there had been a serious falling off in the revenue and a general impoverishment of the people, caused, as Elliot's inquiries proved, by the wasteful extravagance and extortion of the Zemind\u00e1rs, and by the malversation of the native revenue officials, over whose proceedings a very inadequate supervision had been exercised by the English revenue officers of the district. Elliot's recommendations, involving, amongst other matters, a complete survey and reassessment of the district, and the permanent resumption of the defaulting Zemindaries\u2014which had been already sold for arrears of revenue, and bought in by the Government\u2014were sanctioned, although upon terms less liberal to the Zemindars than Elliot had proposed, and at the instance of the Court of Directors, who pronounced a high encomium upon the ability with which he had conducted the Gunt\u00far inquiry, he was appointed Commissioner, with the powers of the Board of Revenue in all revenue matters, for the administration of the whole of the Northern Sirk\u00e1rs. In this responsible charge he remained until 1854, when he was appointed by the Court a member of the Council of the Governor of Madras. He finally retired from the Civil Service and left India early in 1860.\n\nAs a member of the Council, Elliot's duties, though not more arduous, were of a more varied character than those which had devolved upon him as a Revenue officer. While necessarily devoting much time and attention to, and bringing his long experience to bear upon, the important revenue questions which came before the Government from time to time, there were many other subjects of great public interest with which he was required, and was eminently qualified, to deal. Among these were the question of the education of the natives of India, and such matters as the relations of the British Government in India with Christian Missions on the one hand, and with the religious endowments of the Hindus and Muhammadans on the other hand. With the natives he had throughout his service maintained a free and friendly intercourse, recognizing the many good qualities which they possess, and ever ready to promote measures for their benefit. Among those whom he regarded as valued and trusted friends, there was more than one native gentleman, with whom he had been associated either in his official duties or in his literary and scientific researches. Native education was a subject to which Elliot had paid considerable attention when Private Secretary to Lord Elphinstone, under whose Government the first practical measures were taken for imparting\ninstruction in Western literature and science to the natives of the Madras Presidency, and during the intervening years he had lost no opportunity of manifesting a warm interest in native schools. He had also been, throughout his Indian life, a cordial friend, and, in his private capacity, a generous supporter of Christian Missions. One of the most valuable minutes recorded in the Council in connection with the working of the celebrated Education Despatch of 1854, and especially in connection with the development of the Grant-in-Aid System, of which he was a staunch advocate, proceeded from Elliot's pen. While Senior Member of Council, it devolved upon him, owing to the illness of the Governor, Lord Harris, to preside on the occasion of the public reading at Madras of the Queen's Proclamation, issued on Her Majesty's assumption of the direct Government of India.\n\nValuable as he was as a public servant, the branch of Elliot's work which has a special interest to the members of this Society is that with which he occupied the greater part of his leisure time, viz. investigations into the archaeology and the natural history of India. At a very early period of his residence in the Southern Mahratta Country, so far back as 1826, Elliot commenced his archaeological inquiries. Working in concert with a young Brahman, named Rung\u00e1 R\u00e1o, who was attached to his office, and who entered into all his pursuits, joining him in his hunting and shooting expeditions, and with the aid of a gum\u00e1stah, or native clerk, belonging to the village in which he principally resided, Elliot mastered the archaic characters in which the old inscriptions were written, and during the remainder of his life in India devoted much time to deciphering and translating the inscriptions found by him in various parts of the country. In Zoology, Ornithology and Botany he took the keenest interest. In 1837 he published in the Journal of this Society a paper on Hindu inscriptions, and from that year to the last year of his life he was a frequent contributor to one or other of the journals which deal with the objects of his favourite researches. The Madras Journal of Literature and Science, the Indian Antiquary, the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Journal of the Ethnological Society, the Transactions of the Botanical Society, the Journal of the Zoological Society, the Reports of the British Association, the Berwickshire National Club Journal, the Proceeding of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland, all contain contributions, some of them numerous contributions, from his pen, the results of\naccurate and intelligent observation, recorded in a clear and popular style. His most important work is his treatise on the coins of Southern India, published in 1885, when the author was in his eighty-third year, which forms Part II. of the third volume of the International Numismata Orientalia, and contains an interesting account of the ancient races and dynasties of Southern India, derived from the inscriptions and coins which have been discovered. A remarkable fact connected with this treatise, and with all Elliot\u2019s later compositions, is that when they were written, the author, who had been extremely near-sighted all his life, was all but blind, latterly quite blind, and had to depend upon the pen of an amanuensis to commit them to paper, and upon the eyes of relatives and friends to correct the proofs. His collection of South Indian coins, about 400 in number, and a collection of carved marbles belonging to a Buddhist Tope at Amr\u0101vati, which he made when residing in the Gunt\u016br District in 1845, are now deposited in the British Museum, where the marbles are placed on the walls facing, and on each side of, the grand staircase. Three folio volumes of translations, with other valuable MSS. matter, drawings, etc., perished in a vessel laden with sugar, which, encountering a hurricane off Mauritius, shipped a great quantity of sea-water, which wetted the sugar, and penetrating the tin-lined cases, destroyed their contents.\n\nOn some points of Elliot\u2019s character, such as his untiring industry, his eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge, his sound judgment in affairs, an estimate may in some measure be formed from this brief notice of his public life and avocations. His character was not less admirable in the relations and duties of private life. Deeply impressed by the truths of Christianity, but in this and in all other matters perfectly free from ostentation or display; possessing a singularly calm and equable temper; bearing with unfailing patience and resignation in the latter years of his life a deprivation which, to most men, with his tastes and with his active mind, would have been extremely trying; a faithful husband; an affectionate father; a staunch friend, and a kind neighbour, he furnished to all around him an example of qualities, which, if they were less uncommon, would make this a better and a happier world. During the last twenty-four years of his life he resided principally in his home at Wolfelee, taking an active part in parochial and county business, and dispensing a genuine and refined hospitality to his friends and acquaintances. At his house, which was quite a museum, he was\nalways glad to receive and instruct persons who were engaged in his favourite studies. His intellectual vigour remained undiminished literally to the last hour of his life. On the morning of the day of his death he dictated and signed with his own hand, a note to Dr. Pope, the eminent Tamil scholar, stating that on the previous day he had read (i.e. heard read) with much appreciation a notice of Dr. Pope's forthcoming edition of the Kurral, and that notwithstanding loss of sight and advancing years, his \"interest in Oriental literature continues unabated,\" and enquiring whether his correspondent could suggest any method of utilising certain \"disjecta fragmenta,\" connected with the late Mr. F. W. Ellis, which he had collected many years before. In the evening he died, with little or no suffering.\n\nIn recognition of his services in India, Walter Elliot was created in 1866 a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India. In 1877 he was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1878 he received from the University of Edinburgh the degree of LL.D. He was a Deputy-Lieutenant and Magistrate for Roxburghshire. In 1839 he was married at Malta to Maria Dorothea, daughter of Sir David Blair, Bart., of Blairquhan, who survives him, and by whom he has left three sons and two daughters.\n\nSir William Patrick Andrew, K.C.I.E., was a comparatively recent Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, having only been elected in May, 1882. But his long connection with India and Indian Railways, and the active part taken by him in laying before Parliament and the public the important question of establishing a link of communication with our Eastern possessions by means of the Euphrates Valley, have rendered his name familiar to the most superficial English readers of modern Oriental annals. Author of many pamphlets on the above, his favourite theme, and considerations thereto appertaining, he has on one or two special occasions brought out a more ambitious publication\u2014such, for instance, as \"India and her Neighbours,\" which appeared in 1878. In this he expressed the strong opinion that if we failed to connect the Mediterranean with the Persian Gulf, Russia would connect the Persian Gulf with the Black Sea. Sir William Andrew was the only surviving son of the late Mr. Patrick Andrew, of Edinburgh, and was the founder of the Sind, Panj\u00e1b and Dehli Railway. He died on the 11th March, in the eighty-first year of his age.\n\nThe Rev. James Long, whose death took place on the 23rd of March in London, had been for some six years a Member of the\nRoyal Asiatic Society, and was a frequent and interested attendant at the meetings. Indeed, the discussions of Oriental questions, whether literary or political, had a strong attraction for him, wherever held, and his presence had become familiar at the Indian Association, Indian Section of the Society of Arts, and at the United Service Institution; also, when a subject such as the Russian advance towards the Indian Frontier was on the tapis. He has been justly described as \"a true friend of India and her people, and an earnest student of her literature, her social, family and village life.\" According to a brief notice in Tr\u00fcbner's Literary Record, Mr. Long \"was ordained in 1839 by Bishop Blomfield, and shortly after went out to India as a missionary in the service of the Church Missionary Society.\" Here he spent a great part of his life, seeking not only to minister to the spiritual wants of the natives, but to improve their social condition at the same time. In 1861, he \"got into trouble,\" and was fined and imprisoned in Calcutta for translating a native drama reflecting upon the tyranny of the indigo-planters. His paper on \"British Proverbs,\" read in February, 1875, and printed in the R.A.S. Journal, Vol. VII. p. 339, was eminently characteristic of the writer, who set a high value upon the subject he had treated. \"Proverbs,\" he argued, \"which are probably coeval with the discovery of writing, survive the overthrow of empires, and the desolations brought by conquerors.\" They \"photograph the varying lights of social usages; the experience of an age is crystallised in the pithy aphorism.\"\n\nMr. Long died at the age of seventy-three, much regretted by those who could recognize sterling worth and power of research under a somewhat rough exterior.\n\nIt is our painful duty to record the decease of one ripe in years and in learning, but for only a very short time a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. The Venerable Benjamin Harrison,\u00b9 for forty-two years Archdeacon of Maidstone, passed away on the 25th of March last in his eightieth year, after a life of continued intellectual and physical activity.\n\nMr. Benjamin Harrison, his father, a retired merchant, for many years Treasurer of Guy's Hospital, lived in one of those picturesque old houses on Clapham Common, of which so few now remain; and here was his son brought up until he entered as an Undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. After the usual course of study,\n\n\u00b9 Memoir communicated by the Rev. R. Milburn Blakiston, M.A.\nhe took his B.A. degree in 1830, obtaining a First Class in Lit. Hum. and a Second Class in Mathematics.\n\nThe study of Oriental languages was a favourite one with him, and he obtained the Kennicott Hebrew Scholarship in 1831, and the Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew Scholarship in 1832. He studied Semitic languages for some time in Paris, under a then celebrated teacher; and although he did not proceed very far with Arabic and Syriac, yet his proficiency in Hebrew was remarkable. He had been a favourite pupil of Dr. Pusey, the Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford, and, on several occasions when the Professor was absent from Oxford, his place in the lecture room was filled by Benjamin Harrison. His critical knowledge of the Sacred Text of the Old Testament was so notorious that he was unhesitatingly selected as one of the Revisers of that Book. At the meetings of the Revision Company during the many years over which their task was spread he was a very assiduous attendant; and it was a great gratification to him to have lived to witness the publication of the results of this labour of love. For ten years, 1838\u20131848, he was the domestic chaplain of Archbishop Howley, himself no mean Oriental scholar, and during this time he exercised that wise counsel for which he was so well known, in advising George Augustus Selwyn to accept the proposal to go forth as the first Bishop in New Zealand.\n\nArchdeacon Harrison was a man of books. Archbishop Howley bequeathed his library to him, and so did Sir R. Inglis, Bart., M.P., and he also possessed those which had belonged to his father. In addition to these he purchased many himself: and to the last he kept himself an constant with the literature of the day.\n\nWe have only space to add a few words about his sweet, gentle, amiable disposition. He was kindness itself. No one in trouble shrank from consulting him, and never would the interview be without comfort to the distressed one. He was overflowing with lively wit, and his fund of anecdote seemed inexhaustible. It may truly be said of him that he died respected and beloved by all who knew him.\n\nAmong the losses, by death, to the Society during the last quarter, that of a distinguished Honorary Member, Professor A. Neander, demands special notice. He died at Breslau on the 27th February, aged 79. The Academy of March 12 designates him as \"the last of those who may be called the founders of Sanskrit scholarship in Germany\"; adding, \"the present generation of\nyoung Sanskrit scholars in England know little of him and of the good work he did in his day.\" Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner have kindly placed the following brief memoir of the deceased Professor at our disposal:\u2014Adolf Friederich Stenzler was born on July 9th, 1807, at Wolgast, in Pomerania. He studied divinity between 1826 and 1829, at Greifswald, Berlin and Bonn, but soon turned to a more congenial study, viz. Oriental languages. His knowledge of Sanskrit was second to none in those early days of philology, and after having edited Specimens of Brahma-Vaivarta Pur\u00e2na, he visited the Paris University for a year, and then came to London, where he was engaged in literary work at the old East India Company's Library. In 1833 he received the post, which he held till the end of his life, of Professor of Sanskrit at the Breslau University. He was also engaged as sub-librarian at the Breslau University Library from 1834 to 1872. Professor Stenzler was of an amiable and obliging disposition, and had a large circle of friends and acquaintances. He was in London during the Second Orientalists' Congress in 1874. The following is a list of his most important works:\u2014\n\nBrahma-Vaivarta-Pur\u00e2na. Specimen. Textum e. Cod. MSS. Bibliothecae Regiae Berolinensis edidit. 4to.

In justice to his memory, a further extract from the appreciative notice in the Academy is here recorded: \"Those who knew Stenzler personally, knew how the sterling nature of his\nliterary works reflected only his own sterling character. He was an honest scholar and a perfect gentleman, conscious of his own worth, but free from any self-assertion or boasting. . . . . . No one ever suspected him of intrigue, and there was nothing he loathed so much as to see the sacred cause of learning betrayed by those who ought to have been the first to defend it. He belonged to no clique, he never levied tribute from his pupils, he never joined any mutual admiration society. He worked as long as it was day; and to the very last year of his life he was a devoted teacher and unselfish guide to all who had an honest desire to study the ancient language and literature of India in the same spirit in which he had studied it\u2014as a critical scholar, a historian, and a philosopher. His life was bright and serene, and full of useful activity to the very end.\"\n\nV. Excerpta Orientalia.\n\nJournal of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014vol. xxi. (Nos. 3 and 4)\u00b9 is full of instructive and interesting matter. The first and most important article is that by Dr. Macgowan on Chinese Guilds or Chambers of Commerce and Trades Unions. Two parts fairly exhaust the subject expressed in the title, and a third treats of agricultural labourers, agrarianism and the \"Contentment of the Proletariat of China\"\u2014contentment described as \"the result of a legitimately-begotten Conservatism\"\u2014again explained to be \"a Conservatism whose sire was Radicalism, which, more than 2000 years ago, in the form of the one revolution of China, opened the way to rank and power of every qualified man.\" The other papers are \"Is Confucius a Myth?\" and Ta-ts'in and Dependent States, by Mr. Allen: \"Philological importance of Geographical Terms in the Shi-Ki,\" by Dr. Edkins: \"Reply to Mr. Allen's paper on Ta-ts'in and Dependent States,\" and \"Chinese Equivalents of the letter 'R' in foreign names,\" by Dr. Hirth. Notes and Queries, Literary Notes, and Correspondence follow, but these do not call for any special notice.\n\nThe Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, bearing the date of June, 1886, but published in 1887, has a bibliography of Siam by Mr. E.

Preceded by a short sketch of its history, there is a detailed description of its religious buildings, streets, palatial structures, private houses, tombs and fortifications, which will interest the archaeologist, although nothing is certified to belong to a period before the fourteenth century A.D., in the first half of which the Vijayanagar dynasty was founded. The Dhannakarta of the Sri Pamp\u00e1patisvami Temple at Hampi states that inscriptions exist, proving that the g\u00f3pma of the inner prak\u00e1ra of the temple was built in A.D. 1199, when the village of Hampi was given in grant to the temple by a certain Bodayya R\u00e1ja; but the statement still remains to be proved, for it is not borne out by any available testimony. Fergusson mentions a tradition that an earlier city was founded by Vij\u00e1ya Rayal in A.D. 1118. There is, however, no evidence of whole buildings to support a theory to this effect, and that of fragments, though favourable to this belief, is inconclusive.\n\nThe February number of the Indian Antiquary contains the conclusion of \u201cThe Dakhan in the time of Gautama-Buddha,\u201d by the Rev. Thomas Foulkes; as of Mr. Murray-Aynsley\u2019s \u201cDiscursive Contributions towards the Study of Asiatic Symbolism\u201d; a \u201cGaya Inscription of Yakhshapala,\u201d by Professor Kielhorn; \u201cWhy the Fish Talked,\u201d by the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles; and the conclusion of Mrs. Grierson\u2019s \u201cEnglish-Gipsy Index.\u201d In the \u201cMiscellanea,\u201d Mr. Fleet discourses on \u201cHindu Dates,\u201d and Mr. Grierson on Continental periodicals treating of Oriental subjects, and what are called \u201cTatah Kim Verses.\u201d Under \u201cBook Notices,\u201d Mr. Grierson reviews Fasciculus I. of Dr. Hoernle\u2019s Uvasagadasao, edited in the original Prakrit, adding, \u201call scholars must hope for another instalment at an early date of a work begun so well.\u201d Professor Kielhorn also praises the \u201cneat edition of the Siddh\u00e1nta-Kaumudi brought out by the proprietor of the Nirnayas\u00e1g\u00e1r Press, and to be bought for four shillings, while the Calcutta edition costs eight times as much. The number for March opens with Mr. Fleet\u2019s \u201cLunar Fortnight of Thirteen Solar Days,\u201d which he finds to be \u201cthe bright fortnight of the month Jy\u00e9shtha (May-June) of Saka Samvat 1800 (A.D. 1878-79), the Bahudh\u00e1nya samvatsara; Col. Jacob on \u201cThe Vasaduva and Gopichandana Upanishads;\u201d Mr. Howorth\u2019s \u201cChinghiz Khan and his Ancestors,\u201d part xxxiii.; \u201cSilver Copperplate Grant of the Maharaja Rudra-\ndasa,\u201d by Pandit Bhagwan Lal Indraji; \u201cThe Villages mentioned in the Gujarat Rathor Grants,\u201d Nos. iii. and iv., by Professor B\u00fchler; \u201cNotes on the Mahabhashya,\u201d by Professor Kielhorn; and \u201cFolk-lore in Southern India,\u201d by Pandit S. M. Natesa Sastri. In the \u201cMiscellanea,\u201d Mr. Fleet continues his \u201cCalculation of Hindu Dates,\u201d and Mr. Grierson his \u201cProgress of European Scholarship.\u201d The Book Notices comprise the \u201cTarka Kaumudi of Langakshi Bhaskara, by Professor Kielhorn. In April, Mr. Shankar Balkrishna Dikshit, of the Bombay Educational Department, treats of \u201cThe Method of Calculating the Week Days of Hindu Tithis and Corresponding English Dates;\u201d Mr. Howorth supplies the last of his learned papers on \u201cChinghiz Khan and his Ancestors,\u201d winding up with an eloquently-argued deduction that \u201cthe progress of civilization is not continuous;\u201d Mr. Fleet continues his illustrations of Sanskrit and Canarese Inscriptions,\u201d by describing the Parla-Kimedi Grant of Indravarman, already noticed in 1884; Mr. Rehatsek discusses a \u201cLetter of the Emperor Akbar asking for Christian Scriptures;\u201d and Pandit S. M. Natesa Sastri contributes No. xvi. of his Folk-lore in Southern India. The number is closed with a review of Professor Legge\u2019s translation of the \u201cLi Ki\u201d (Sacred Books of the East, vols. xxvii.-viii.). Three articles of interest, viz. Mr. Fleet\u2019s on \u201cThe Scheme and Equation of the Years of the Gupta Era;\u201d \u201cThe Legend of Tulasi as told in Southern India by the Orthodox,\u201d under the initials R. D. M.; and \u201cThe Maurya-Passage in the Mahabhashya,\u201d by Professor Bhandarkar, combine with the \u201cMiscellanea\u201d to make up the May number. Under the last head is a reprint of the proceedings of the Aryan Section at the Seventh International Congress of Orientalists held in Vienna during the autumn of 1886.\n\nThe Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund for April contains a sketch and descriptive note of the Sakhrah, or Summit of Mount Moriah, and the following articles:\u20141. On the Tomb of Philip d\u2019Aubign\u00e9 at Jerusalem, by M. J. E. Hanauer. 2. Notices of the Dome of the Rock and of the Church of the Sepulchre by Arab Historians prior to the First Crusade, translated by Mr. Guy Le Strange. 3. Notes by Captain Conder. 4. A Remarkable Tomb, described by M. Schick, and 5. Conclusion of the paper called \u201cMiddoth, or the Measurements of the Temple.\u201d In the introductory Notes and Queries one item of intelligence is important. This is, that Herr Schumacher has traced the whole wall of Herod\u2019s City of Tiberius, three miles in length and of oblong shape. Dr. Wright\u2019s letter to the Times forwarding the Rev. Mr. Eddy\u2019s report of the discovery of a tomb temple at Sidon, is reprinted with additional particulars. Professor Porter, of the American College at Beirut, referring to one of the tombs, says \u201cthat he saw nothing to equal it in the collection at Athens, and very little in sculpture finer anywhere.\u201d\n\nHebrew and Semitic Languages.\u2014In the Academy, 19th March, the Philology Notes mention the recent discovery of a Hebrew\ninscription at Riva, dated A.D. 620, to be published by Professor M\u00fcller of Vienna. They also notice a laudatory review of Dr. Neubauer's Catalogue of Hebrew MSS. in the Bodleian, contained in the Russian Voskhod. In the Athen\u00e6um of the same date, Prof. T. W. Davies, writing from the Haverfordwest Baptist College, on the 7th March, asks whether the time has not come to establish a British Institute of Hebrew, \"the object being to promote the study of the language, and of other Eastern tongues that help in the understanding of the Old Testament language and literature.\" The writer very aptly cites the success of the American Institute, which, though nominally for Hebrew only, \"seeks to help forward the study of the allied languages\u2014Syriac, Chaldee, Arabic and Assyrian.\" It moreover undertakes to provide for the teaching of Hebrew and cognate languages \"by correspondence and otherwise.\" The last expression, perhaps, needs a somewhat closer definition; but the subject is clearly one deserving of serious attention. In the Athen\u00e6um of the 2nd April, Professor Davies, continuing the discussion, refers to the German Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft, which publishes the Literaturblatt f\u00fcr Orientalische Philologie, expressing his ignorance of the existence of any English Society with a like \"specific object in view.\" Mr. Hyde Clarke sees in our Indian service an effective body of Orientalists, and thinks the Professor would do well to enlist those among them \"who return home as well as those who remain on duty.\" In stating, however, that \"our Asiatic Societies are supported by Indians, and not by our University men,\" he applies a rule which, even at the present moment, admits happily of notable exceptions.\n\nArabic.\u2014The Journal Asiatique for February and March has the following note from M. H. Zotenberg:\n\nGalland's translation of the Thousand and One Nights contains several tales now celebrated, such as Zainu'l Asnam and the king of the Genii, 'Al\u00e1'u'd-d\u00edn or the Wonderful Lamp, the blind B\u00e1b\u00e1 'Abd Allah, S\u00edd\u00ed Noum\u00e1n, 'Ali B\u00e1b\u00e1 and the Forty Thieves, the two Sisters jealous of their younger Sister, and certain others of which the original text is unknown. They are neither to be found in the editions of Habicht, Bulak or Calcutta, nor in any manuscripts of a European library. It has been erroneously supposed that all these tales are included in the fourth volume of that particular copy three volumes of which after Galland's death became the property of the king's library. This fourth volume contained, in all likelihood, the greater portion of the story of Kamaru'l-Zam\u00e1n (the commencement of which is in vol. iii), that of Gh\u00e1nim, that of the Sleeper awakened, and that of the unhappy Lover confined in a mad-house, which Galland never translated: because there is reason to suppose that the first part of the Arab MS. of the National Library (1716), written by the Syrian monk Charis, is transcribed from it.\n\nThe narratives in the later volumes of Galland's selection are traceable to another origin; as may be inferred from the under-\nmentioned facts obtained from the Journal edited by the learned translator:\n\n1. The tales published by Galland in the second part of vol. ix. and vols. x. xi. and xii. were related to him at the beginning of 1709 by a Christian Maronite of Aleppo, named Hanna, who had accompanied the noted traveller, Paul Lucas, to Paris;\n\n2. Galland entered in his Journal a full analysis of these tales;\n\n3. The Maronite Hanna made over to Galland an Arabic text of some of the number, notably the story of the Wonderful Lamp, which he declared he had written from recollection;\n\n4. Galland, in 1710\u20131711, translated from this text the story of the Wonderful Lamp, and perhaps the tales of the Blind B\u00e1ba, S\u00edd\u00ed Nouman and Khoja Hasan at Habb\u00e1l. He edited also the others, i.e. the story of \u2018Ali B\u00e1ba and the Forty Thieves, of \u2018Ali Khoja, of the Enchanted House, the Prince Ahmad and the Fairy Pari Ban\u00fa, and the two jealous Sisters, from the narratives of Hanna entered in his Journal.\n\nSuch is the way in which these stories came to the knowledge of the French translator. But it is important to ascertain their Oriental origin; for it is quite clear that they are not inventions of the Maronite of Aleppo; moreover, M. Zotenberg believes that the communications made to M. Galland were not wholly extemporized by Hanna, who must have possessed a written copy.\n\nM. Zotenberg then intimates to those interested in the matter that there is an Arabic text of \u2018Al\u00fa\u2019n\u2019d-d\u00edn and the Wonderful Lamp in a MS. of the Arabian Nights recently acquired by the National Library. This MS. comprises also the story of the Awakened Sleeper, hitherto to be found only in the abridged edition of Habicht, of Zainu\u2019l-A\u1e63n\u00e1m, which had been translated by Petis de la Croix from the Turkish version of the book entitled \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062d \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062f\u0629 and included in vol. viii. of Galland\u2019s work without his knowledge.\n\nThe MS., in many respects of high value, which has just enriched the French collections, is from the pen of Michael Sabb\u00e1gh, written in the commencement of the present century; and M. Zotenberg thinks he can identify it with one belonging to M. Caussin de Perceval, which the learned M. Fleischer used in 1827, when reviewing the Tausend und Eine Nacht of Habicht. It is copied from a Baghdad MS. of 1115 Hijra (A.D. 1703), as certified in a final note reproduced by Sabb\u00e1gh. As that volume of Galland\u2019s translation which contains the story of the Wonderful Lamp only appeared in 1712, the authenticity, that is, the \u201ccontinuity,\u201d of the Arab text can scarcely be doubted. It is added that Michael Sabb\u00e1gh has copied faithfully and completely from the original, even imitating its material arrangement.\n\nM. Zotenberg proposes to supply shortly further details of this version of the Arabian Nights.\n\nOne of the present year\u2019s periodicals issued from the Leiden Press (Brill) is the Critica Arabica of Dr. Carlo Graf von Landberg,\navowedly a work of pure love, without arri\u00e8re pens\u00e9e of hostility or profit. Brother Orientalists who wish to possess it may, we are told in the Preface, be supplied with it gratuitously; while those whose works are criticised in it are invited to send their replies for publication in its pages. In the first number are a notice of M\u00fcller's Al-Hamd\u00e2ni; De Goeje's Kit\u00e1b\u00fa'l Bald\u00e1n; Houtsma's Ibn Wadih (Al Ya'\u1e33ubi), and Dr. Snouck Hurgronje's Proverbes and Idioms of Makka. The first and last are written in German, the two others in French. M. de Goeje had replied to the comments upon his work, but did not wish his MS. published. The editor's counter-reply, however, shows the general drift of the learned Professor's arguments.\n\nFrom the same brochure, we learn that King Oscar II. has postponed the period for receiving MSS. in response to his offer of prizes (alluded to in Vol. XVIII. Part III. of the Journal, July, 1886) to the 1st January, 1890. The subjects stated were, it may be remembered: 1. A history of Semitic languages; 2. A description of Arab Culture before the time of Muhammad. It is now apparent that there will be many learned competitors, Christian and Muhammadan, for the second award. As regards the first, the field will, probably, be restricted to Europe.\n\nLe Hadhramout et les Colonies Arabes de l'Archipel Indien, by M. L. W. C. Van den Berg, is a volume of great interest as regards geography, ethnology and language. Our information on the tract of mother-country to which it refers is more or less incidental, though one work, that of Heinrich von Maltzan, bears directly upon it, when treating of the exploration of M. de Wred\u00e9 in 1843. If we compare its description in the pages of Wellsted's Travels, or the map attached to Gifford Palgrave's Central and Eastern Arabia, with that now afforded by letterpress and illustrations, in this late issue from the Government Press of Batavia, we scarcely recognize that one and the same locality is intended. But the more important part, as the main object of the publication, is that which treats of the colonists in the Indian Archipelago. The spirit of roaming and enterprize which takes the Hadramaut Arabs from the land of their birth, not only to the comparatively near coast of Abyssinia,\u00b9 but to the islands of Java, and to Sumatra, Singapur, and Borneo, is well worthy the historian's attention in its results, and, viewed in this respect only, the present volume supplies admirable data for history. But instruction is abundant on other points also; and the lives and works of the more intellectual and educated Arab colonists are among the particular passages which render the volume a fitting subject for consideration in the pages of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal.\n\nThe Academy of 12th March notices with much favour the second and third volumes of Lady Burton's Household Edition of\n\n\u00b9 See Munzinger's Journey through the Afar Country, Journal Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. xxxix. pp. 190-211, on the Hadarema in Amphi\u0142a.\nthe Arabian Nights, containing the story of Kamaru'l-zam\u00e1n and of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman, and introducing a large number of minor tales not included in Lane's edition.\n\nThe Political Agent at Maskat has forwarded to the Society a paper on the dialect of Arabic spoken in the principality of Oman, prepared by Surgeon-Major O. S. Jayakar, Civil Surgeon at the Station. As pointed out by Colonel Miles, owing to its remote position and its isolation by a broad desert from the rest of the Peninsula, Oman possesses a very peculiar dialect containing many antique and strange words, which are either unknown or used in a different sense in other parts of Arabia. Explaining that the paper consists of two parts, one exhibiting the grammatical variations, and the other containing a vocabulary to illustrate the first part, he adds that Dr. Jayakar's opportunities of studying the dialect have been exceptional, and as this officer has been enabled to put forward much information that will be new to Arabic scholars, he believes that the MS. will be welcomed as a valuable contribution to Arabic philology.\n\nAssyriology.\u2014M. Carl B\u00e9zold's Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie for January contains, independently of the Sprachsaal, Bibliographie, and notices of books, the following six articles:\u2014Franz Reber on Old Chaldaic Art; J. N. Strassmaier on Two Babylonian Treaties of the Time of Nabonid; G. Hoffmann, who under the comprehensive title of Namen und Sachen, supplies critical notes on Biblical and other readings; C. F. Lehmann on two Edicts of King Assurbanipal; H. Winckler on a Text of Napolassar; and P. Jensen's \"Hymnen auf das Wiederscheinen der drei grossen Lichtg\u00f6tter.\"\n\nThe Babylonian and Oriental Record has appeared for April and May, and shows a long list of collaborateurs. To No. 6, Mr. Pinches contributes an interesting translation of Babylonian Tablets referring to the apprenticeship of slaves: R. Q., a \"Retrospect\" on the subject of the Hittite Inscriptions: Mr. Baynes, a paper on the \"Eranian Origin of the Teutonic Concept of Deity:\" Prof. de Harlez, a continuation of his \"Iranian Studies,\" and Dr. Casartelli, No. 1 of \"Pehlevi Notes.\" No. 7, the May issue, contains Dr. Casartelli's \"Two Discoveries of Chosroes;\" Professor and Dr. Revillout's \"Sworn Obligations in Egyptian and Babylonian Law:\" and an abstract of two of Professor Sayce's recently delivered Hibbert Lectures. It would be satisfactory to see some modification in the outer appearance of this new periodical. The pages of the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie are not so long and broad, but the Leipzig Journal has a more attractive and convenient form, and may commend itself as a fitting model.\n\nSyriac.\u2014Chwolson, in the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Science of St. Petersburg, April, 1886 (xxxiv. No. 4, Syrische Grabinschriften aus Semirjetschie), gives an interesting report on Nestorian epitaphs found in two Syrian cemeteries recently discovered. These are situated about 540 werst west of Kulddha, and 420 werst south of Kashgar. The tombstones are small and rude,\nmostly marked with a cross, and the epitaphs are in Nestorian character. The Turkish words and names which occur in them are the only difficulty in their interpretation, and indicate that the persons interred were chiefly Tartar converts of the Nestorian Christian missionaries. The dates on the headstones are in the Seleucidan era, and vary between A.D. 858 and 1338. Four of the original tombstones have been sent to the Museum in the Palace of the Ermitage. Professor Chwolson has obtained photographic copies of 14 other inscriptions. The Russian Government has sent instructions to have the remaining tombstones collected and photographed.\n\n_Hittite._\u2014Some three columns of the _Academy_ of May 21st are taken up with an interesting notice by Professor Sayce of Captain Conder's _Altaic Hieroglyphs and Hittite Inscriptions_ (Bentley), a book which has been awaited with interest. In the hypothesis put forward by the author, his reviewer observes the following three assumptions: (1) That there is a connection between the Hittite hieroglyphs and Kypriote syllabary which enables us to find certain phonetic values among the former by comparison with equivalents among the latter. (2) \"That the pictures out of which the Cuneiform characters have developed have the same origin as the Hittite hieroglyphs and Kypriote syllabary, and thus throw light on several of the Hittite forms.\" (3) That the grammar and vocabulary of the Hittite texts is \"neither more nor less than Akkadian.\" As regards the first of these assumptions, Professor Sayce allows that the connexion of the Hittite and Kypriote characters is a fact generally accepted by the paleographical authorities. The second he considers untenable, and that there are no sufficient grounds for comparing together Hittite hieroglyphs and Babylonian characters. As to the third assumption, while admitting that the language of the inscriptions is not Semitic, he thinks it quite unlikely that we should discover Akkadian words \"in a recognizable condition among distant tribes in Northern Syria and Kappadokia,\" and proceeds to illustrate the misapprehension under which Captain Conder appears to have laboured in supposing such words to lie concealed under Hittite symbols. In summing up his conclusions, the Professor gives credit to the learned and gallant author for having advanced the solution of the problem, adding\u2014\"His observation that 'a series of groups (of characters) followed by a single emblem indicates a packet, so to say, forming one expression,' is very happy. He is also possibly right in seeing a personal pronoun in the character he would read _ne_ (my e); and his comparison of certain Hittite characters with the Kypriote _re_, _ni_, _ta_, _li_, and _te_, is attractive. Equally good is his observation that the important words\u2014nouns and verb-roots\u2014are apparently distinguished by larger emblems than the grammatical syllables prefixed or following.\"\n\nAt the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, M. Henzey read a paper on certain specimens of so-called \"Hittite\" art discovered near Aidin.\nOf these the more important are described in the Revue Critique, 14th March, to be cylinders and seals, recalling, from the designs engraved on them, the art of Chald\u00e6a and Babylonia.\n\nSanskrit and Aryan Tongues.\u2014The Academy of March 26 notes the purchase by the Bodleian Library of 465 Sanskrit MSS., mostly post-Vedic, acquired by Dr. Hultsch during a recent visit to Kashmir. There had been added, moreover, to the above-named Library some twenty MSS. obtained through Prof. Thibaut of Banaras. Both collections would, probably, be catalogued by Dr. A. A. Macdonell, on completion of the concise, practical Sanskrit dictionary which now occupies his attention. The same paper announces a forthcoming new edition, from the Nirnaya-s\u00e2y\u00e2r Press at Bombay, of B\u00e2ga\u2019s Kddambar\u00ee, \u201cwith a full commentary, and an editio princeps of V\u00e2tsy\u00e2yana\u2019s K\u00e2m\u00e1s\u00fbtra, together with a commentary entitled Jayamangal\u00e1 by Ya\u015bodhara.\u201d Professor R. G. Bhandarkar, one of our Honorary Members, who attended the Congress of Orientalists held last autumn in Vienna, has been reading a paper at P\u00fana on Sanskrit studies in Europe. The Academy of April 2nd reports the Professor\u2019s remarks as follows:\u2014Since the discovery of Sanskrit, the Europeans, especially the Germans, had \u201cdevoted themselves with untiring energy to the study of its language and literature, and to the solution of various problems suggested by it.\u201d Attributing the revival of Sanskrit studies in India largely to the action of European scholars, he found these last to \u201cpossess a critical acumen in which Hindu Pandits are entirely wanting.\u201d\n\nAu reste, the following conclusion is worthy of record: \u201cThe English were the first to discover Sanskrit, but the Germans have now almost entirely monopolized Sanskrit learning in Europe.\u201d They were the \u201cBrahmans of Europe, the French the Kshatriyas, and the English the Vaisyas. Even in England the best Sanskrit scholars are Germans.\u201d\n\nProfessor Jolly has, in the Academy of 16th April, an appreciative and elaborate notice of Professor B\u00fchl\u00e9r\u2019s translation of the Laws of Manu, which forms the twenty-fifth volume of the Sacred Books of the East.\n\nSeven notices of works in part iii. vol. iii. Literatur-Blatt will interest students of Sanskrit and Indian languages. They are:\u2014E. Kuhn on Seshagiri Shastri\u2019s Notes on Aryan and Dravidian Philology; Holtzmann on Protab Chandra Roy\u2019s Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa; W. Jacobi on Dr. Solf\u2019s \u201cDie Ka\u00e7mir-Recension des Panc\u00e2\u00e7ik\u00e2;\u201d Zachari\u00e6 on Franke\u2019s Hemacandra\u2019s Ling\u00e2nu\u00e7\u00e2sana; Jacobi on Pischel\u2019s Rudrata\u2019s \u00c7rng\u00e2ratilaka and Ruuyaka\u2019s Sahridayalil\u00e2; Leumann on Jacobi\u2019s Ausgew\u00e4hlte Erz\u00e4hlungen in M\u00e2har\u00e2shtri; and Kuhn on Grierson\u2019s Bihar Peasant Life.\n\nAmong new publications may be noted L. Scherman\u2019s Philosophische Hymnen aus der Rig- und Atharva-Veda-Sanhita verglichen mit den Philosophemen der \u00e4lteren Upanishad\u2019s, Strassburg, Tr\u00fcbner. E. S\u00e9nart\u2019s \u00c9tudes sur les Inscriptions de Piyadas\u00ee,\ntom. ii. et dernier, Paris, Leroux. P\u0101nini\u2019s Grammatik, Hrsg. \u00fcbers. erl\u00e4utert etc., v. O. B\u00f6htlingk, 7 Lfg., Leipzig, Haessl.\n\nPersian.\u2014In the review of Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot\u2019s Persian Portraits, published in the Academy of 2nd April, Mr. C. E. Wilson describes the selections given as \u201cthoroughly successful and interesting attempts to bring out all the real spirit and force of the originals, and to give thought for thought instead of phrase for phrase, or merely dry and uninteresting explanations.\u201d With reference to the author\u2019s lament that many locally celebrated Persian writers had never been introduced to the home public, the reviewer concludes his notice with making known the significant fact that he himself had on his hands at the time of writing, \u201ca translation of the whole of the Bah\u00e1rist\u00e1n of J\u00e1mi,\u201d for which he had \u201cin vain awaited a publisher since its completion in 1877.\u201d\n\nMr. Whinfield\u2019s Masnavi-i-Manavi, or the spiritual couplets of Maul\u00e1n\u00e1 Jal\u00e1l\u00fa\u2019d-d\u00edn Rumi, affords a new proof of the great attraction which Sufi mysticism presents to Englishmen whose tastes and linguistic attainments enable them to appreciate the Persian poets in the original. The Song of the Reed, so gracefully Anglicized by Sir William Jones about a century ago, has, together with other poems by its author, been reproduced in our tongue by Robinson, Redhouse, Palmer,\u00b9 and it may be many more; and now, again, it reappears in a new English dress as the prologue of a volume which is one of the latest contributions to Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s Oriental Series. In its present form the Masnavi, though a declared abridgment, is a comparatively full translation. Unlike the late Professor Palmer\u2019s, which, in the few specimens given, exhibited a combination of narrative and moral, Mr. Whinfield\u2019s book, separating the two, contains \u201cabstracts of the principal stories and a literal translation, line by line, of the principal doctrinal morals.\u201d\n\nAn article by Mr. Edmund Montet on \u201cLa Religion et le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre en Perse\u201d opens No. 3 of M. Jean R\u00e9ville\u2019s Revue de l\u2019Histoire des Religions, tome xiv. The penultimate sentence expresses the opinion that if Persia is ever enabled to regain a position among nations worthy of her past history, the revolution will possibly be due to the renovation of her literature by means of the drama. Is it not rather a question of regeneration than renewal?\n\nLiterature in India.\u2014No. ccxxiv. of Selections from the Records of the Government of India, Home Department, Serial No. 4, \u201cReports on Publications issued and registered in the several Provinces of British India during the year 1885, published in Calcutta during the current year,\u201d has reached the Society. It is full of statistical interest, and otherwise valuable and suggestive. The two Reports included in it are all dated in 1886; those from the Central Provinces and H\u00e1idar\u00e1b\u00e1d in the month of February; from\n\n\u00b9 Published ten years ago. See the \u201cSufi Poets of Persia,\u201d Pall Mall Gazette, 24th January, 1877.\nAssam and Maisur in March; from Bengal and Burma in August; that from the North-West Provinces (including Oudh) in April; Madras in May; the Panj\u00e1b in June; and Bombay in September. Irrespectively of the usual information obtained from the Calcutta Review, which usually affords data more or less directly bearing upon the progress of the Indian mind, a brief notice of the results achieved by the Departmental machinery applied in India to educational purposes, and tabulated in the State Record, may not be unacceptable. The Provinces are placed according to the order assigned them in the summary of Reports:\n\nMadras.\u2014753 books and pamphlets and 119 periodicals, published in 1885, giving a total of 872, show an excess of 54 publications\u2014that is, of 9 books and pamphlets and 45 periodicals on the numbers of the previous year. Of the whole 872, more than two-thirds are in the current vernacular languages\u2014principally Tamil, thus, for the greater part, Telugu, Malayalam, and Canarese\u2014and more than one-sixth in English and other European languages. A small proportion consists of books in Indian classical languages, and of much the same number in more than one language. 340 are original, 79 translations, and 453 republications. The subjects treated are divided into sixteen heads:\u2014Art, Biography, Drama, Fiction, History, Language, Law, Medicine, Miscellaneous, Poetry, Politics, Mental Philosophy, Religion, Science (Mathematical and Natural), Travels. From an average of ten years, the most significant increase appears to be that shown under Science; nor is it at variance with such result to find that Drama, Fiction, and Poetry are on the decline.\n\nBombay.\u20141527 books and 496 periodicals, published in 1885, giving a total of 2023, show an excess of 394 publications on the numbers of the previous year. Of these nearly 92 per cent. are in Eastern languages\u2014notably Mar\u00e1thi, Gujar\u00e1ti, Urdu, and Sanskrit\u2014and somewhat more than six per cent. in English. Nearly half the Mar\u00e1thi and more than half the Gujar\u00e1ti are first editions of original works. In the former case the favourite subject is Poetry; in the latter, the greater number of publications come under the head \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d\n\nBengal.\u20142309 books and 422 periodicals, published in 1885, giving a total of 2731, show an excess of 341 publications on the numbers of the previous year. Of these more than two-thirds are in the vernacular languages spoken in the province, 208 in the Indian classical language, 322 in more than one language, and 317 in English. Nearly 80 per cent. of the whole are original, and 56 per cent. in Beng\u00e1li. The greater number of publications come under the head \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d; after which Religion, Language, Poetry, and Fiction deserve special mention.\n\nN.W. Provinces and Oudh.\u2014The total number of registered publications is 1290, being 526 more than shown in the previous year, and the highest for any year on record. About 40 per cent. are in Urdu, 22 per cent. in Hindi, and 8 per cent. in Persian (mostly re-\npublications). The proportion of original works is greater for new editions than first issues, and applies mainly to \"Language.\"\n\nPanj\u00e1b.\u20141566 publications were catalogued in 1885, or 31 more than registered in the previous year. Of these more than half are in Urdu, more than a seventh in Hindi, and a little less than a seventh in Panj\u00e1bi. The largest number, over 25 per cent. of the whole, come under the head of Poetry, but the report assigns no high position to these, and some 70 per cent. are republications.\n\nCentral Provinces.\u2014The return shows only 1 English, 1 Sanskrit, and 1 Hindi publication.\n\nBritish Burma.\u201468 publications are registered for this province, of which 29 are on Religion, 16 on Language, and 13 on History. Of these, less than half are first editions of original works.\n\nAssam.\u2014The return shows only 12 works, or a decrease of 4 on the previous year, i.e. 1 original Sanskrit work on Religion, 1 original Assamese drama, and 2 Assamese publications under Poetry; 7 \"Miscellaneous\" works in Bengali, and 1 work on Religion in Bengali and Sanskrit together.\n\nMais\u00far.\u2014The total number for 1885 is 125, of which two are periodicals, being a decrease of 18 on the previous year. They are thus summarised.\n\nIn the vernaculars spoken in the province:\n\nKannada, 65; Telugu, 4; Tamil, 2 ............... 71\nIn Sanskrit ........................................... 38\nBilingual, i.e. English and Kannada, 1; Kannada and English, 1; Sanskrit and Kannada, 14 ......... 16\n\nArranged according to the subjects treated, the largest number fall under Religion (31) and Language (29); Mental and Moral Philosophy have 16; Poetry and Drama 13 each; Fiction 5; Law 4; History and Natural Science 3 each; Biography, Medicine and Mathematical Science 2 each; Arts 1; and Miscellaneous 1. Of the whole 27 are educational and 98 non-educational. In the Civil and Military Station of Bangalur 16 works, including 2 periodicals, were published. This shows a decrease of 42 on 1884, possibly occasioned by the removal of troops to the N.W. Frontier and Burma. Four of the works are in English, 2 in English and Tamil and Telugu and English, 2 in Tamil, and the remaining 8 in Hindustani. The majority of publications are on Religion, all in Hindustani.\n\nHaidarabad.\u2014The report shows that 18 first editions of original works were published in 1885, being 1 less than the figure of the previous year. They consist of 11 numbers of a monthly agricultural magazine, 5 numbers of the \"Berar School Paper,\" an educational periodical, and two publications on crops.\n\nCalcutta Review.\u2014Of the ten articles, other than quarterly summaries and notes, which make up the April number of this journal, that by M. Parbati Churn Roy on \"High Education in Bengal\" is not the least worthy of attention, and bears out the observations made in our last issue, on \"the marvellous indications\nof the advance of education in India during the last thirty years,\" as contained in the well thought out contributions of intelligent natives to English periodical literature. Laying stress on the wonders in this respect of a stirring half-century, the writer certifies that \"though the amount allotted in the budget to the item of Public Instruction has increased more than seventyfold since 1835, Government still finds it difficult to meet the growing demands of the country.\" No doubt he is right, and there is ample cause for congratulation at the past, and for renewed exertions in the future. The fact brought out that, while a percentage of 5\u00b76 of the revenue in Great Britain and Ireland is expended on Education, not 2 per cent. of the revenue of India is given in that country for a similar purpose, offers no cause of legitimate complaint, and the extraordinary increase of educational expenditure in 50 years is no warrant for a further outlay that would bring up India to the home figure. As it is, progress has been sufficiently rapid, and it is pleasant to find that M. Parbati Churn Roy, while defending the Government from the charge of extravagance, considers the wisest statesmanship to lie \"not in disturbing the present line of policy, but in regulating it so that it might yield better results in the future.\" An article from the same pen on Financial and Administrative Reform in India; one by Mr. A. Stephen on Imprisonment for Debt; Mr. H. G. Keene's views on his own question, \"Are Islam and Civilisation Irreconcilable?\"; Mr. Percival on Buddha as a Philosopher; Mr. D'Cruz on the Education Code for European Schools in Bengal; Dr. Cust's Report of the late Vienna Congress; a Ruskinian Address by Mr. Spencer; and the usual summaries and critical entries make up a very respectable number.\n\nIndia.\u2014Miscellaneous.\u2014In the Academy of the 5th March, Mr. Keene reviews the continuation of Elphinstone's History of India, edited by Sir Edward Colebrooke, and lately published by Murray. Though pointing out certain disadvantages under which the work must labour, owing to the long and eventful period which has elapsed since the date of original writing, the reviewer pronounces it to be \"a valuable record of a stirring time, penned by a man whose lightest opinion about Indian topics was once sought as an oracle, and is still superior to that of any other writer who has approached the subject.\"\n\nDr. Rost's letter, in the same number of the same review is, in one sense, a strong argument in favour of lending MSS. from Government or Public Libraries to scholars and students. He states that during a period of several years, many thousands of loans have been effected from the India Office Library, and not a loss recorded. And highly important, in connection with this statement, is the learned librarian's assertion that, except for existing arrangements, \"numerous editions of texts and other works based on our (i.e. the India Office) collections of MSS. would either have been impossible, or at least not possible to their actual extent.\" On the\nother hand, however, Mr. Warren's plea, a week later, on behalf of readers at the Bodleian who go up to Oxford expressly to inspect certain books and documents, and are told they are out on loan, is not without reasonable claim to consideration.\n\nCongress at Stockholm.\u2014His Majesty Oscar II. had entrusted to the organising committee of the Vienna Congress the election of a president and organising committee for the ensuing Congress at Stockholm; but the decision come to was that the Stockholm committee should elect its own president. The latter is thus constituted:\n\nProfessor E. Tegner, of the Swedish Academy, Lund.\nDr. Fr. Fehr, pastor primarius and President of Consistory, Stockholm.\nProfessor Almkvist, Upsala.\nProfessor J. Lieblein, Christiania.\nDr. Count Carlo von Landberg, Stuttgart (Stockholm).\n\nAccording to the last-named authority, from whose Critica Arabica this information has been obtained, a hope has been expressed that the Congress would hold one sitting in the capital of Norway.\n\nChina and Dutch Indian Settlements.\u2014Through the kindness and courtesy of the Government of the Netherlands the Society has received the first and second sections of part i., Dr. G. Schlegel's valuable Nederlandsch-Chineesche Woordenboek in the Tsiang-Tsui Dialect: also a newly-published work of M. Van den Berg, entitled 'De Inlandsch Rangen en Titels op Java en Madoera.'\n\nEgyptology.\u2014The Academy for March 12th contains a letter from Mr. Greville Chester, mentioning various places up the Nile where inscribed Ostraka are still to be found, and making an appeal to Englishmen to raise, by private subscription, a sum sufficient to bring to England the noble head of Ramses given to our nation by Muhammad Ali. It appears that there is some talk of erecting the head on a pedestal at Memphis, where it would be exposed to the knives of tourists and the stones of the Arab boys. March 26th gives a letter from Mr. Flinders Petrie on \"Rock Graffiti in Upper Egypt,\" and under the heading \"Art and Archaeology\" speaks of Mr. Petrie at Thebes taking a series of photographs and paper casts of the typical heads of foreigners in the great bas-relief tableaux of Luxor, Karnak, the Ramesseum and Medinet Habu. We are further told that he has photographed and \"squeezed\" a variety of similar types at Silsilis and other places. The ethnological series will comprise some 250 to 300 heads, including the finest known examples of types of Libyans, Ethiopians, Amorites, Hittites, Sardinians, Ionians, etc. Mr. Petrie has also taken paper casts of that which, as the Academy has it, \"may be called the oldest botanical work in the world,\" viz. the representations of foreign trees and plants brought to Egypt by Thothmes III. in the course of one of his Arabian campaigns, all of which are sculptured with the minutest attention to botanical details on the walls of a chamber.\nin the great temple of Karnak. The plant, or tree, is in most instances given on a small scale complete, with accompanying sculptures on a larger scale, showing the leaves, fruits, and seed-pods precisely as in the botanical works of the present day. April 23rd has an account of the Necropolis at \"Tell el Yahoodieh\" by M. Naville, together with an informal report on the same subject from Mr. F. Ll. Griffith, and some remarks from Miss A. B. Edwards as to the possible Babylonian origin of some of the apparently foreign-shaped vases and coffins. May 7th, under head \"University Jottings,\" announces that Professor L. Dickerman will take a class for the ancient Egyptian language and study of hieroglyphs at Chautauqua College, New York, during the summer session of 1887. In addition to these classes, Prof. Dickerman will deliver a series of four lectures to the students of Chautauqua on \"The Life, Work, Art, Architecture, and Religion of the Egyptians.\" May 14th publishes a letter from Mr. Ernest Gardner in answer to criticisms made by Professors Kirchhoff and Hirschfeld on Naukratis Inscriptions. In the same Academy Miss Edwards gives some account of M. Maspero's \"Bulletin Critique de la Religion Egyptienne,\" which has special reference to the ceremonial rites at funerals and other solemn occasions, and is to appear in the number for May and June of the \"Revue de l'Histoire des Religions.\" In the Academy for May 21st, Miss Edwards has a glowing review of M. Maspero's \"L'Arch\u00e9ologie Egyptienne,\" and May 28th tells of the exhibition to the Cambridge Antiquarian Society of a few of the skulls from the large collection recently made in Egypt by Mr. E. A. W. Budge for the Anatomical Museum of the University.\n\nThe two numbers of the Revue de l'Histoire des Religions for November and December, 1886, and for January and February, 1887, contain a lengthy article by M. E. Am\u00e9lineau, entitled \"Le Christianisme chez les Anciens Coptes.\" The writer is evidently displeased and disgusted with the Copts for being Egyptians. He takes great pains to show that the Copts retain many of the old religious ideas and beliefs under the new garb of Christianity; but he does not appear to approve either of the old or of the new state of things. He makes out that the Egyptian religion old and new is a very selfish bit of bargaining\u2014so much is performed during a short lifetime here in order to win a good time in the future. But he states that the monks in Paradise were found by those who visited them still leading the religious life; that they prayed, sang, read the Scriptures at the same hours of the day and night as on earth. We question whether life such as this should be called a purely selfish end. M. Am\u00e9lineau appears to have arrived at thoroughly despising the Copts, because, like the old monuments, they are too changeless. His advice to them would not be \"Show yourselves to be worthy of your ancestors,\" but rather \"Shake yourselves free from the superstitions of past centuries\u2014forget your origin\u2014the great purpose of Christianity is the progressive elevation of humanity.\"\nThe same contributor has in the *Journal Asiatique* the reproduction of a Coptic document with French translation and remarks. The MS. is one of two (the other is the Life of the Patriarch Isaac), which have apparently lain unnoticed in the Mus\u00e9e Borgia till last year, when they were brought to the notice of students in a lecture delivered at the Egyptian Institute in Cairo by M. Am\u00e9lineau. The \"Document\" given in the *Journal Asiatique* is \"Le Martyre de Jean de Phanidjort.\" It is important as being the latest Coptic work yet known. The martyrdom is said to have taken place on April 29th, 1209 A.D., and the account is written by a priest named Mark in 1210. It is divided for church reading, and appears to be read in the Coptic churches now on the day of the martyrdom.\n\n*Le Mus\u00e9on* for January and for April has articles by M. F. Robiou on \"La Religion Egyptienne.\" The number for April contains three hieroglyphic inscriptions from Boulak, with translations and remarks by Karl Pielh.\n\nIn the *Revue Critique* for May 23rd M. Masp\u00e9ro criticises M. L. Oberziner on Sun Worship amongst the Ancient Egyptians.\n\nThe March and April numbers of the *Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient* give the continuation and ending of A. v. Schweiger-Lerchenfeld's \"Cultur-Einfl\u00fcsse und Handel in Aeltester Zeit.\" The number for May has an article on Karabeck's communications from the Archduke Rainer Papyrus.\n\nAmongst new books on Egypt we note: E. M. Coemans, Manuel de la Langue Egyptienne, Premi\u00e8re partie, Les Ecritures Egyptiennes, Gand. E. Toda, Estudios Egiptol\u00f3gicos, 3 parts, Madrid. Ph. Virey, \u00c9tudes sur le Papyrus Prisse, le livre de Kaqimna et les le\u00e7ons de Ptah Hotep, Paris, Vieweg. Dr. Alfred H. Kellogg, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses in Egypt, Tr\u00fcbner. A. J. Butler, \"Court Life in Egypt,\" Chapman & Hall.\n\n**Numismatics.**\u2014An interesting notice of a catalogue of the Oriental coins in the Rumianzof Museum at Moscow, by a young Russian student, M. Trutowski, appears in the *Atheneum* of the 16th April. Although the work is said to present \"an unnecessarily large number of slips and oversights,\" it is anticipated that such shortcomings will be corrected by experience and study, and the d\u00e9but of the new numismatist is warmly welcomed. \"The Rumianzof Cabinet,\" according to the *Atheneum*, \"contains 4980 coins, of which 2760 belong to the dynasty of the Khans of the Crimea, but 1400 of these are effaced and illegible. There are 963 Ottoman coins of little interest, and 415 specimens of the Golden Horde, mostly well known. The rest consists of Sassanian and other Pahlavi coins, a couple of hundred issues of the Khalifs, the same number of S\u0101m\u0101ni Governors of Samarkand, and some examples of the T\u00e1hiris, Ilek Khans (44), Seljuks, rulers of Volga Bulghar, and other dynasties, with 100 coins of the Shahs of Persia. The Krim Khans and Ileks are the most noteworthy part of the collection.\"\n\nVol. xxii. of the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*, issued in June, contains\nmany papers of interest to students of Asiatic subjects. Among these may be mentioned \"Sunnites and Shi'ites,\" by the late Spitta Bey and Professor A. Muller; \"Syr Darai,\" by Kropotkine; \"Syria,\" by Professor A. Socin, and \"Syriac Literature,\" by Professor W. Wright, LL.D. The first is so interesting and instructive that readers might wish it were fuller: the second is mainly of geographical interest, and relates both to the river and province: the third is by a practised hand, ensuring a fitting treatment: and the last opens a mine of information and learning from which few if any could have selected the more notable specimens with as much discrimination as the writer of the article.\n\nNOTES CONTRIBUTED BY THE HON. SECRETARY.\n\nAsia.\u2014The British and Foreign Bible Society has published a Gospel in the language of the Pangasina, spoken by one million in the Island of Luzon, in the Philippine Islands. The translator is Se\u00f1or Alonzo of Seville, a long resident in the islands.\n\nAfrica\u2014Professor Reinisch, of Vienna, has published in the German language two volumes on the language of the Afar or Danakil. The first volume contains Texts collected by the author on the spot, the second a Dictionary. Both are of the greatest importance, and prepared in the best style. It belongs to the Hamitic Group of Languages.\n\nProfessor Rene Basset of Algiers has published a manual of the Kabail language in the Zouave dialect spoken by the indigenous inhabitants of Algeria. It is a Hamitic Language, and totally distinct from Arabic. The Manual consists of a Grammar, Texts, Bibliography, and Vocabulary. It is a most satisfactory work, and is in the French language.\n\nThe Christian Knowledge Society has just published in the English language a dictionary of the Nika language spoken near Mombasa in East Africa. It belongs to the Bantu Family. This work was compiled by the late Rev. J. Rehmann, of the Church Missionary Society, during his long residence in that country.\n\nDr. Sims, of the Livingstone Mission on the Congo, has just published in the English language a Vocabulary of the Yululema language spoken in the Aruwini, Lolami, and Mawembe districts of the Upper Congo. It belongs to the Bantu Family. The book is accompanied by a small map of the Congo, indicating the precise locality where this language is spoken. Dr. Cust has presented a copy to the Library of the R.A.S. (East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, publishers.)\n\nThe Hon. Secretary has also published at his own charges at the Christian Knowledge Society a Vocabulary of the language spoken by the savage Fan tribe who occupy the region north of the River Gabun and the French Protectorate in South Africa, West Coast. The renderings of the words are in the Spanish language. It is pre-\nsumed to be of the Bantu family. The compiler is a Spaniard, Dr. Osorio, who had resided some time in the country, and who called upon the writer of these notes to help him to publish his vocabulary. As it seemed of value, was certainly genuine, and filled up a great gap in our existing knowledge, Dr. Cust consented to do so, as his contribution to the extension of our knowledge of Africa.\n\nAmong this year's books on African Languages, mention should be made of three published at Vienna: The Manuel de la Langue Tigrai, by M. Schreiber; the Lingua Afar nel Nord-Est del' Africa, by Giovanni Colizza; and Die Bilin Sprache, by Leo Reinisch. The Tigrai is spoken in Central and Northern Abyssinia; it is Semitic, and a sister language of the Tigr\u00e9, both sprung from the old Ethiopian, or Giz. Along the shores of the Red Sea, and in the islands between the Bay of Adulis and Gulf of Tajirah, is the tribe known to outsiders as Danakil, to the members themselves, Afar. Mention has already been made of Professor Leo Reinisch's volumes on this tribe. In the general scramble for Africa, Italy laid hands on Assab, a port of the Red Sea, and Government was induced to send young Italians to acquire the language of the neighbouring tribes with a view to annexation. Hence Signor Colizza's work, a most complete one, and a valuable addition to science. The vocabulary of the Bilin, a language spoken by the Bogos tribe on the northern frontier of Abyssinia, is a masterly production, written in German.\n\nGrundriss der Sprachwissenschaft, von Dr. Fried. M\u00fcller. \u2014 Vienna, Holder, 1886.\n\nThe completion of this remarkable and epoch-making work deserves a notice, though totally inadequate to the greatness of the subject, and the comprehensive manner, in which it has been treated. Six years ago the first volume appeared, and the author promises two additional volumes by way of appendix. But the subject of the Science of Language expands year by year, and this noble work forty years hence will be as far below the high-water level, as the famous Mithridates of Adelung and Vater, which astonished the world in 1817, and is now entirely out of date.\n\nTo this work there is no Index, and there are no Language-Maps. It cannot for one moment be considered to embrace our linguistic-knowledge of the world, as the author restricts himself to those languages of which he has competent Grammars. It is obvious that at the present moment a very large proportion of Languages is represented by Vocabularies alone, and a certain proportion, though known to exist, is unrepresented by any linguistic document. The\n\n1 Contributed by Dr. R. N. Cust.\nbook is therefore a survey of our knowledge of the Science, as far as Grammars have been compiled, and is therefore an inadequate representation of the World's store of the Form of Speech in actual use by Mankind.\n\nThen there is an inherent difficulty in the method adopted, which is meant to combine Ethnological and Philological results. It is obvious that Race is innate, and cannot be changed either by Nations or individuals, and that Language can be changed even without leaving the Native Country, of which we have a notable instance in the Fellahs of Egypt, and the English-speaking Negroes of West Africa.\n\nIt can truly be said that no such a thesaurus of language can be found in any other work, ancient or modern, and no Library is complete without it. The main body of the work consists of careful analyses of the Phonology and Grammatical Forms of every language of which the Sounds and Forms have been brought to book. Texts are in most cases supplied with interlinear translations, and careful grammatical notes. To few, if to any one, has it been given to possess the acumen required for such a task, and the industry to carry the author up to the point of knowledge which would supply the characteristic features of the language, and then drop the subject, and pass on to an entirely different specimen of Sound-Lore, Word-Lore, and Sentence-Lore. If the question arose as to the Grammatical Construction of any language in South Africa, North America, the Extreme Orient, or the South Sea Islands, the student has only to turn to the page assigned to that language, and he will find the phenomena set forth after a careful diagnosis, and a reference to the authority, thus enabling the accuracy to be tested.\n\nThe order in which the author grapples with his subject is the ascending one. He commences with Mankind, as he is found in the lowest round of human culture, but the language of such races is sometimes found to be superior, as a language, to the culture of the race.\n\nIn the first volume he treats of the Woolly-haired races, and passes under review the Bushman, the Hottentots of South Africa, and the Papuans of New Guinea. Thence we rise to the great variety of African Negro Languages spoken in the tropical Regions North of the Equator, and the wonderful Bantu Family, which occupies the whole of South Africa South of the Equator, allowing for the Bushman and Hottentot Enclaves.\n\nIn the second volume we find an account of the Straight-haired\nRaces: the Australians, and the Hyperboreans, the Jenisee-Ostyak, the Ainu of Japan, the inhabitants of the Aleut Islands, and the Eskimo. To them succeed the long row of American indigenous languages from the North to the extreme South of that Continent.\n\nIn the second part of the same volume are passed under review the languages of Polynesia, Melanesia, and Malaysia, the great Altaic Family of High Asia, the Japanese, Korean, the Tibeto-Burman Family, the Tai Family, the Khasia in the Himalaya, the language of Annam, and the languages of China. The vast area traversed in this section indicates how brief, summary, and inexhaustive must be the survey even of the series of languages, of which Grammars have been compiled.\n\nIn the third volume we get a glance, but a glance only, at the great Nuba-Fulah Family of North Africa, and Dravidian of South India; the Basque of the Pyrenees, the languages of the inhabitants of the Caucasus; the Hamitic language of North Africa, and the Semitic of Asia, and we are landed at last in the familiar Region of the great Aryan Family, and touch ground.\n\nThe book is avowedly a continuation of the author's highly esteemed \"Allgemeine Ethnographie.\" We cannot doubt that to the appendices promised in the autumn, there will be added a long row of additional volumes, to be incorporated in a second edition of the whole work in their proper places in the Narrative.\n\nThere is room for an abundance of criticism in detail, and there will be no severer critic of the work than the author himself, but he has to be congratulated on accomplishing his task.\nADDRESS TO THE QUEEN FROM THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY ON THE OCCASION OF HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY'S JUBILEE.\n\nThe draft having been revised in the manner suggested as appropriate to the circumstances,\u00b9 the following Address was forwarded to the care of the Home Secretary:\n\n\u00b9 Previous to the preparation of the above, the following letter from the President to the Secretary of the Society, dated 11th June, 1887, had been circulated for the information of Resident Members:\n\nDear Sir Frederic Goldsmid,\n\nIn the matter of the Address to the Queen which we discussed when we last met, it is clear to me that no action can be taken without the consent of the Society, or at least of the Council, expressed or understood. Now the next meeting of either is not until the 20th inst., the day before the Jubilee. I feel that I owe the Society an apology for not having brought the question to its notice on the 16th ult. My excuse must be that it was entirely owing to the indisposition of our late President that I was placed in the chair on the 16th, and that I had hardly had time to acquaint myself with the duties devolving on me in that position. However, as I cannot but suppose that attendance at a special meeting in the next few days would be inconvenient to many, I propose to request you, as Secretary, to acquaint the Resident Members of the Society that it is contemplated to present an Address to Her Majesty. This Address, I presume, it will be my duty as President to prepare. It will be a purely formal document, but in order to guard against an appearance of undue assumption of responsibility on my part, I shall ask Sir Edward Colebrooke and Sir Henry Rawlinson to associate themselves with me in the consideration of the draft.\n\nI cannot suppose that there will be a dissident voice in the Society regarding the propriety of presenting an Address to Her Majesty on such an occasion as the Jubilee, and I trust that, safeguarded as it will be by the opinions of the eminent coadjutors whom I am inviting to assist me, the Society will be content to leave the draft in my hands.\n\nI remain, etc.,\n\nTHOMAS FRANCIS WADE.\nADDRESS.\n\nMadam,\n\nAt a time when from every side Your Majesty's subjects are hastening to tender their congratulations upon the completion of that half century of rule, which, both morally and materially, has been so blessed throughout Your dominions, it would appear doubly incumbent on the Royal Asiatic Society to pray Your acceptance of its tribute of duty and affection.\n\nFor while, in common with other learned associations, this Society has been, since its first foundation, encouraged by the patronage of the Sovereign, it is under Your Majesty as Empress of India that its labours have acquired for it a special claim to be regarded as a body identified with the interests of Your Majesty's subjects in the far East.\n\nThat the same measure of prosperity that has distinguished Your long reign may be continued throughout the years yet in store for Your Majesty, is the sincere and earnest hope of those on whose behalf, as members of the Asiatic Society, I humbly beg, Madam, to lay this Address before Your Throne.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMadam,\n\nWith the profoundest respect,\n\nYour Majesty's most obedient humble servant,\n\nTHOMAS FRANCIS WADE,\nPresident Royal Asiatic Society.\nThe Address having been laid before the Queen, its acceptance was notified to the President in the following letter:\n\nWHITEHALL,\n30 June, 1887.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have had the honour to lay before the Queen the loyal and dutiful Address of the Royal Asiatic Society on the occasion of Her Majesty attaining the fiftieth year of her reign, and I have to inform you that Her Majesty was pleased to receive the same very graciously.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nHENRY MATTHEWS.\n\nThe President of the Royal Asiatic Society,\n22, Albemarle Street, W.\nallowance for this lack of precision, *miryek* is so much like the Turki *meniak*,\u00b9 \u2018great,\u2019 or \u2018prince,\u2019 that it may be connected with it. The relationship of the Corean with the Turki and other Altaic languages is real, though remote,\u00b2 so that, after all, the word may not be an importation, and simply be a common heirloom; but the probabilities here are the other way, and further investigations and discoveries in Corea cannot fail to throw some light on the matter.\n\nIII.\n\nThe curious double cap of the Miryek of Un-jin is highly suggestive of two of the currents of tradition which are met with in Corea, whilst the oblong slab and its pendants remind us of the old Chinese dress cap as illustrated in the ancient rituals;\u00b3 the repetition of such a thing on a smaller scale above, and their arrangement on a central column, were obviously suggested by the Indian Pagoda-umbrella. There is no doubt that the Miryek of Unjin is Buddhist. The position of the hands,\u2074 and especially the mark between the eyebrows (i.e. the *urna*, one of the 32 lakchamas or characteristic physiological marks by which every Buddha may be recognized),\u2075 are, I think, conclusive.\n\nUn-jin (the Eun-tjin of the missionaries\u2019 map),\u2076 near the Keun Kang, or river within the province or To of Tchyoun=Tchyeng, and in proximity to, but not within the limits of that of Ch\u00f6l-la-To (Tjyen-la-to), Ko-yang and Pha-ju (Hpa-tjiu) at 40 and 80 li N. of the capital, as well as Unjin, all three places where Miryeks still exist, were formerly parts of the Pek-tsi state, where Buddhism (introduced about the end of\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Meniak is also the name of tribes in the east of Tibet.

The huge statues at Bamian have lately been described in this Journal.\u00b2 But others are still unknown or have not been studied. In the Burma Gazetteer, compiled by Major H. R.

The Chinese records, on the other hand, state simply that one of the kings of Lin-yh, a believer in the everlasting principles of India, caused statues to be cast in gold and silver, ten half-cubits in height. The word M\u00e9-c\u00e0n is perhaps an alteration, and intended to represent Magadha, the country of Gautama Buddha. Maritime intercourse was active in former times between Indo-China, the Indian Archipelago and the northern coasts. It is from this intercourse with Japan in the third century, that the Chinese have first heard of Formosa, the Philippines, the Archipelago, etc. And nothing would be surprising should an early spread of Buddhism in Corea have come by this maritime way, thus causing, as in Indo-China, the erection of the Miryeks. The countenance of these huge statues may be found at fault in various details with the standard imagery and statuary of Buddhism, but these differences have obviously resulted from their peculiar surroundings in this remote corner of N.E. Asia.\n\n1 Cf. the Hoang viet dia du chi (Official Geography of Annam), vol. i.\n2 I translate from P. J. B. Truong Vinh-ky, Cours d'histoire Annamite, vol. i.

XVII.\u2014The Pre-Sanskrit Element in Ancient Tamil Literature. By E. S. W. Sen\u0101th\u012b R\u0101j\u0101, LL.B., M.R.A.S.\n\nIt has been the almost invariable remark of certain scholars who have devoted their attention to the study of the old Tamil literature, that it seems, to judge from its actual state and form, to have had no commencement. Unlike the languages and literatures of other peoples, which pass through various stages of natural development before arriving at maturity, the high dialect of the Tamil has apparently sprung up into full-grown manhood from the very instant of its birth, like the fabled offsprings of rishis, without traversing the intermediate states of infancy and youth. The philologist has before him a language which, to borrow the words of an eminent lexicographer, is \"in its poetic form more polished and exact than the Greek, and in both dialects, with its borrowed treasures, more copious than the Latin;\" but of the origin and growth of which he seeks in vain to catch a glimpse through the veil of impenetrable darkness which hangs over it. If we go back to the earliest source of existing literature, we find it to be a grammatical one. In fact, the author of Tolk\u0101ppiyam, perhaps the oldest grammatical work extant, is alleged to have been the immediate disciple of the mythical Agastya, the reputed author of the Tamil language itself. Beyond Agastya all is obscurity. But what seems inexplicable is the division of the Tamil\n\n1 Read in part before the meeting of 28th June, 1887.\n2 Vide the remarks of Dr. Popo in a speech delivered before the Madras University.\n3 Dr. Winslow's English-Tamil Dictionary, Preface, p. vii.\n4 See the Tamil Bharata of Villiptt\u016bran.\nlanguage by the supposed first grammarian, and following his example by Tolk\u00e1ppiyam,\\(^1\\) into three dialects, a poetical (I\u00e7ai), a dramatical (N\u00e2dagam), and a colloquial one (Iyal). How are we to account for the existence of such a threefold division of the language before the commencement of all literature? What was the object and utility of such a classification at almost the birth-time of the language? What was the basis upon which the grammarian proceeded to establish the above distinction? for he could not surely have evolved it out of his own \"inner consciousness.\" These are questions which suggest themselves on the very threshold of any inquiry into the origin of the Tamil literature.\n\nOf the above difficulty two solutions are proposed; one of traditional, and the other of recent origin; but neither of which seems to be capable of bearing the light of criticism. To the orthodox Hindu believer there is nothing surprising in the whole matter; the solution is very simple, it was done by a stroke of miracle; for to a muni like Agastya nothing was impossible. Did not the same sage, though no higher than one's thumb, drink the whole ocean in one sip, and sink down the Vindhya mountain with the mere pressure of his toe? Different sects vied with each other in claiming the invention of the Tamil language for their favourite divinities, though all of them are unanimous in regarding Agastya as the mouthpiece of their respective deity. To the \u00c7aivas it was Skanda who vouchsafed to reveal the language as well as its grammar; to the Buddhists, if we are to believe Buddhamittra,\\(^2\\) the author of Vira\u00e7\u00f4riyam, a standard grammatical treatise, it was Avalokite\u00e7vara who condescended to make this linguistic revelation. In the opinion of the Arhatas, Tamil is one of the eighteen languages revealed by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tolk\u00e1ppiyam, chap. i., with the commentary of Natchin\u00e2rkiniy\u00e2r, manuscript belonging to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris.\n\n\\(^2\\) V\u00eera-\u00e7\u00f4riyam, introductory stanza, which runs as follows: \"Ayum gunat' Avalokitan pakkal Agattiyan k\u00eat'. Eyum puvanik' iyampiya tim Tamil. . . .\" Dr. Burnell ascribes the composition of Vira-\u00e7\u00f4riyam to the eleventh century, apparently from the fact that a certain Vira Chola flourished at that period. According to an anecdote occurring in connection with the Skanda Pur\u00e2na (Tamil), the work was in existence in the eighth century A.D.\nthe omniscient Jina. At this day, however, it is inadmissible that even so great a personage as Agastya, notwithstanding all the supernatural aids he was favoured with, could have invented a language and launched it forth into the world ready-made. We are forced to go upon the supposition that the Tamil had a natural birth and development like all other languages.\n\nBy the side of this theory of divine inspiration, there is another of recent\\(^1\\) birth, which, so far as its chances of probability are concerned, might, I think, well contest the palm with the former. It offers on many points a striking analogy to the former, and appears to be based much on the same fundamental principle, revelation excepted. According to this hypothesis, the \u00c7entamil\\(^2\\) is an artificial style. In the former theory the whole language was the invention of or at least revealed by the instrumentality of one man; in the latter the poetic dialect only can claim that characteristic speciality, the inventors in this case being a certain number of poets and grammarians of the ninth century A.D. This theory would thus confer on the Tamils the unique distinction of a people whose poetical sentiment, not content with its natural expression in intelligible language, gave vent to itself in a conventional gibberish!\n\nI need hardly say that both of the above-mentioned theories are to my mind far from being satisfactory. The language of a people, whether it be poetical or colloquial, can no more be created by one man than by the deliberate consent of a number of men. At least, experience does not seem to confirm such a supposition. On the contrary, it seems to grow up with the people unconsciously, and to undergo its changes slowly, varying in the rapidity of its\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Dr. Burnell's South Indian Paleography, p. 142.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dr. Burnell seems to confound \u00c7entamil with Isai (poetic) Tamil. The poetic language was no doubt derived from \u00c7entamil, but the terms are not synonymous. \u00c7entamil words sometimes undergo in poetry certain modifications, which are caused by the exigencies of euphony and metre. These changes are called \u00e7eyul vik\u0101ram (poetic changes), and the language is then technically called Isae' Tamil. But such abnormal variations are not of the essence of \u00c7entamil itself. \u00c7entamil was at first the dialect of a particular district of the Tamil country.\nmovement according to the march of the nation, to whom it serves as a vehicle of expression. It is for the advocates of the latter theory to prove that \u00c7entamil was an exception, and to furnish historical evidence of the age and circumstances in which and the persons by whom the compact was entered into, of creating \u00c7entamil, and of the exceptional circumstances which justified it. For my part I am unable to discover traces of such a convention, either express or tacit, in the whole field of \u00c7entamil literature.\n\nNot to speak of the unnatural singularity of the above hypothesis, there are two or three strong objections against it, which, as it seems to me, decisively stamp it as improbable.\n\n1. It throws no light on the division of the old language into the three varieties of Iyal, I\u00e7ai and N\u00e0dagam by the very first grammarian, to whom existing literature, in common with tradition, ascribes the first work of that kind.\n\n2. In a sasana belonging to the Jews of Cochin,\u00b9 which Dr. Burnell assigns to the ninth century, the language employed is much like the modern Tamil. If modern Tamil was in current use in the ninth century, and \u00c7entamil was an artificial language invented only in the ninth, how are we to account for the existence in the latter of words common to the whole Dravidian parent stock, but which are unknown to the colloquial idiom? The Telugu and Canarese must have been separated from the Tamil more than 2000 years ago,\u00b2 as Dr. Caldwell has ably demonstrated in his Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages; yet words belonging to the two former abound in \u00c7entamil, while they seem to be unknown to the current language of the present day as to that of the ninth century. For instance, the following words amongst many others are in common use in Canarese and Telugu, while in Tamil, though they are unknown to the daily idiom, they are of very frequent occurrence in the poetic dialect:\n\n\u00b9 See a copy of it in Burnell's South Indian Palaeography, p. 140.\n\u00b2 See Caldwell's Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, Introduction.\n| \u00c7entamil | Canarese | Telugu |\n|----------|----------|--------|\n| Child    | \u00c7i\u00e7u     | Kusu   | Shishuvu |\n| Mother-in-law | Atte   | Atte   | Atta    |\n| Nurse    | T\u00e2di     | D\u00e2yi   | D\u00e2di    |\n| Father   | Tande    | Tande  | Tandri  |\n| Ear      | \u00c7evi     | Kivi   | Cevi    |\n| Body     | Mey      | Mai    | ...     |\n| Cow      | \u00c2        | Akalu  | \u00c2vu     |\n| Nail     | Ugir     | Uguru  | Goru    |\n| Field    | Pulam    | Hola   | Polam   |\n| Water    | Nir      | Niru   | ...     |\n| House    | Mane, illam | Mane | Illam |\n\nIndeed, it seems almost possible to construct a complete \u00c7entamil vocabulary out of Telugu and Canarese alone. On the supposition that \u00c7entamil was an invention of the ninth century, the question arises, whence did the Tamil classical writers derive their vocabulary? It could not have been from the prevailing language of the ninth century, for a hundred years previously modern Tamil was already in use.\\(^1\\) We cannot also admit the hypothesis that the old authors coined them consciously from Telugu and Canarese, for there is no reason why they should not have adopted by preference words from Sanskrit, which was already held in high esteem throughout all India as a literary language. Nor could we suppose that they introduced Telugu and Canarese words into their poetic dialect, knowing the affinity of the two former to the Tamil language, for it is only modern philology which has revealed their relation to one another as cognate languages, and thus dispelled the errors of old grammarians, who regarded all Dravidian languages as mere derivatives\\(^2\\) from Sanskrit. If there was no \u00c7entamil before the ninth century, it is impossible to explain how words now found only in languages separated from the Tamil more than 2000 years ago, were preserved during the interval of nearly 1000-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) South Indian Palaeography, p. 142.\n\n\\(^2\\) See \u0100ndhra\u00e7abda-chint\u0101ma\u1e47i, i. 14\u201318; Manu, x. 43\u201344; Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata \u00c7\u0101ntiparvan, etc.\nyears, so as to be incorporated into a literature which came into being about the ninth century.\n\n3. The above theory does not accord with the little we know of the history of the Tamil people. In the absence of all means of verification I will pass in silence the records of native authorities, according to which more than 200 P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyas\\(^1\\) are said to have reigned at Madura before the commencement of the fourteenth century. It would, however, be well to bear this circumstance in mind, to see how far it is corroborated by external evidence. The Mahavanso\\(^2\\) uniformly refers to the Tamils of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya country as possessing a national existence and civilization anterior to that of the Singhalese, and mentions that Wijaya, the first king of Ceylon, married the daughter of a P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya about the sixth century B.C. The fact of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya kingdom figuring as a well-established monarchy at that period argues to its having been in existence for some two or three centuries at least previously. In the time of Buddha, the principal Dravidian countries appear to have been on a par with those of the North in point of moral and material progress.\\(^3\\)\n\nMegasthenes,\\(^4\\) the ambassador of Seleukos Nikator at the court of Pataliputra in Northern India (302 B.C.), could not have heard of the kingdom of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya in the extreme South, if it had not attained considerable power and reputation in his days. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101shya\\(^5\\) of Patanjali (second century B.C.) speaks familiarly not only of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya and Chola countries, but also of particular towns and rivers in the South, as K\u0101nchi and K\u0101v\u0113ri. The kingdoms of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya, Chola and Ker\u0101la are also met with in the inscriptions\\(^6\\) of Asoka (250 B.C.).

Pliny speaks of the kingdom of Pandiya (A.D. 77), and its capital Madura. Ptolemy (second century A.D.) and the Periplus Mari Erythraei of Arrian (third century A.D.), equally refer to the three Tamil kingdoms as the most prominent in the South. Indeed, Porus in the North and Pandiyar in the South seem to have been the two most powerful monarchs of India whose fame overshadowed the rest in the time of the Greek supremacy in Western Asia. Varaha-Mihira, the astronomer (404 A.D.), makes allusions to the kingdoms of Pandiya, Chola, Kerala, Karnataka, Kalinga and Andhra, all of which were Dravidian, and to the rivers Kaveri and Tambraparni in the South.\n\nFa-Hian, the Chinese traveller in India of the fourth century, heard of a powerful kingdom in the South, which Mr. Ferguson has identified with the Pallava kingdom, a recognized seat of the Tamil language. The testimony of Greek and Roman writers attest that Kolkai, the ancient seaport of the kingdom of Pandiya, was a great emporium of commerce. According to Chinese authorities, in A.D. 500 an ambassador, Lien Woo, came from South India to China, who gave them to understand that trade was carried on between Southern India and the Roman Empire. Arab historians agree as well in affirming that maritime commerce existed from the earliest times between the Phoenicians and Arabs on the one hand and the Pandiya and other kingdoms in the South.\n\n1. \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, whose capital was \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd.

According to M. Chabas, in the reign of Thothmes III. (seventeenth century B.C.) of Egypt, Phoenicians had commercial intercourse with India (Etudes Egyptiennes, p. 120).\nFrom the \u00c7entamil words found in the Hebrew\\(^1\\) Bible as terms to designate peacocks, apes, etc., brought by ships from Tarshish, it has been inferred that commercial intercourse had been going on between the Tamils and the Ph\u0153nicians as early as the days of Solomon, king of the Hebrews (1500 B.C.).\n\nTo suppose that a people who had commercial and sometimes political relations with Ph\u0153nicians, Greeks, Romans, Chinese and Arabs from very early times, and who were in contact for centuries with one of the most refined of languages, the Sanskrit, and who had well-organized kingdoms of their own, as historically attested from at least the sixth century B.C., to suppose, I repeat, that such people had no literature of their own till the ninth century A.D., seems to me, to say the least, to be running counter to all probability. It is difficult to believe that the kingdom of P\u00e2ndiya, sung by poet and bard as the cradle of \u00c7entamil, had continued to exist from before the sixth century B.C., and had produced no literature during its palmy days until its old age and decrepitude in the ninth century A.D., when there was nothing capable of giving such an impulse.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe various considerations referred to above seemed to me sufficient to reject the theory of \u00c7entamil being an artificial language of the ninth century, and to search for a more rational explanation of it. The only method capable of rendering any trustworthy data appeared to me to be the comparative one, which has so often been employed with the most fruitful results.\n\nWhatever doubts one might entertain as regards the period anterior to Asoka, we know to a certainty from the inscriptions\\(^3\\) of that monarch that Sanskrit and North Indian\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Dr. Caldwell, Introduction to the Comparative Grammar of the Dr\u00e2vidian Languages.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the fourth century Fa-Hian found Brahmins and heretics in Java, and the old Kawi literature seems to contain Sanskrit words in a Dr\u00e2vidianized form. See Fa-Hian's Travels by Beal, p. 168, and South Indian Palaeography, pp. 132\u2013133. This would indicate that the old Javanese colonists were either Tamils or Telugus, and that Sanskrit influence and culture had spread through South India long before.\n\n\\(^3\\) Asoka Inscriptions, Tablet II.\ninfluences had penetrated to the Tamil countries in his time (third\\(^1\\) century B.C.). Now, Sanskrit being the only language to which Tamil was indebted, if we deduct from the Tamil language and literature what she has borrowed directly or indirectly from her wealthy neighbour of the North, the remainder must evidently be her pure Dravidian patrimony, of which she must have been in possession at the latest in the third century B.C. Taking, therefore, the inscriptions of Asoka as the basis of our calculations, a hasty process of comparison of the Tamil literature with that of the Sanskrit brings to light some important facts.\n\n1. That the ancient Tamils had an alphabetical system of their own independent of Sanskrit.\n\nAlmost all the Indian languages, whether ancient or modern, even Pali and Singhalese, as well as Canarese, Telugu and Malayalam, have borrowed the Sanskrit alphabetical system. This artificial adaptation, while it gives an apparent completeness to the phonetics of those different languages, has been in many cases utterly unsuited to their wants. Thus some of the letters are useless to them, as there are no words in the language which admit of the employment of those letters, while others are pronounced without any regard to their phonetic values from a national defect of organ on the part of those among whom it has been attempted to naturalize sounds alien to their language. The Tamil\\(^2\\) language on the other hand is free from this artificiality, a circumstance which, I believe, must solely be attributed to the fact that the Tamil alphabetical system has not been elaborated under the auspices of Sanskrit gram-\n\n---\n\n1 The Pali and Magadhi might have had some no very considerable influence on the Tamil. There are some words in Tamil which seem to be derived from Sanskrit through P\u0101li or Magadhi. Perhaps they were brought by Buddhist and Jaina missionaries.\n\n2 Dr. Burnell seems to have arrived also at the conclusion that the Tamil alphabet was not derived from the Sanskrit. The process by which he infers it is somewhat different. He appears to have drawn the conclusion from the meagreness of the Tamil alphabet as compared with the fullness of that of the other Dravidian languages, which have modelled their alphabetical system on the Sanskrit. It may well be doubted whether it is an advantage to the Telugu for instance to have a theoretically complete system of alphabet, while in practice several of the letters are not used at all, or are all pronounced alike by the people.\nmarians. If they had any hand in it, it is improbable that they should have adopted for it a system different from that which they have employed for the other cognate Dr\u00e2vidian languages of Telugu and Canarese.\n\nPal\u00e6ographically, too, the ancient Tamil written alphabet called Vatteruttu has been found to be independent of the characters in which Sanskrit and other North Indian languages have been written at different times.\n\nThe obvious inference is that the Tamils had an alphabetical system of their own before they came in contact with Sanskrit or Pali. The Asoka inscriptions imply that they possessed a knowledge of a written alphabet in the third century B.C., for it would be the height of absurdity to issue proclamations by means of inscriptions to the P\u00e2ndiya, Chola and Chera monarchs, if the latter could not decipher written characters. The Lalita Vist\u00e2ra, a work translated into Chinese in the first century A.D., seems to confirm the above view, for among the sixty-four alphabetical systems which Buddha is said to have learnt in his infancy, is included the Dr\u00e2vida or Tamil. From this fable relating to the supernatural linguistic attainments of Buddha we may draw one rational conclusion at least, viz. that at the time of the composition of the Lalita Vist\u00e2ra, its author or authors knew of the existence of a Tamil alphabet.\n\n2. Another important fact which is elicited by comparison is that the \u00c7entamil versification was independent of Sanskrit.\n\n---\n\n1 See South Indian Pal\u00e6ography, p. 51.\n2 Lalita Vist\u00e2ra, Edition Foucaux, Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet, Adhy\u00e2ya X.\n3 The modern Tamil alphabet is, according to Dr. Burnell, an adaptation from the Grantha alphabet of the tenth century, which again is derived from the Chera alphabet of the third (see South Ind. Pal\u00e6ogr. p. 46). It seems to me, however, on a comparison of the Vatteluttu used in the Cochin S\u00e2sana, with the Tanjore inscriptions of the tenth century, that the modern Tamil characters, allowances being made for the individual peculiarities of writers, might with more probability be said to be derived from the Vatteluttu by a natural process of development than to have been copied from the Grantha.\n\nThe introduction of printing has effected considerable modification in Tamil characters. In a deed of the date of 1737, which belonged to my seventh paternal ancestor, Kuruli K\u00e2vala S\u00ean\u00e2th\u00ee R\u00e2ja Mudaliyar, the characters employed seem to resemble those of the tenth century more than those of the present day. The same remark applies to all documents of the last century that I have met with in the north of Ceylon. What change, when compared with the eight centuries preceding!\nThe metres of the former were radically different from those of the latter. While the sister Dr\u00e2vidian languages, the Telugu\\(^1\\) and the Canarese, have literally borrowed almost all the varieties of ganachchandas and matr\u00e2chandhas from Sanskrit, the \u00c7entamil has preserved intact her ancient metres of Agaval,\\(^2\\) Ve\u00f1p\u00e2, Kalipp\u00e2 and Vanchippa.\\(^3\\) N\u00e2gavarma\\(^4\\) in his rules of Canarese prosody constantly cites Pingula and other Sanskrit grammarians as authorities, while Tolk\u00e2ppiyam, the oldest known Tamil grammarian, knows no higher tribunal than the still older \u00c7entamil\\(^5\\) poets. The \u00c2ry\u00e2, Vait\u00e2liya, Anushtubh, G\u00e2yatr\u00ee, and other ordinary Sanskrit metres, have not their corresponding equivalents in \u00c7entamil, and are incomprehensible to it, while they are closely imitated by Telugu and Canarese poets. Of the six constituent parts of a verse, as enumerated by Centamil grammarians,\\(^6\\) eruddu, a\u00e7ai, cir, talai, adi and todai, the fourth (talai), so valued by Tamil poets, is altogether foreign to Sanskrit poetry. Of the 43 varieties of todai, the m\u00f4nai and edugia are not at all met with in Sanskrit, while there are vestiges\\(^7\\) of them in Canarese, a fact which leads me to the inference that old Canarese poetry originally resembled that of the \u00c7entamil, although it was gradually recast on a Sanskrit mould. In short, \u00c7entamil versification is purely Dravidian, its genius is utterly distinct from that of the Sanskrit, and the whole is free from any foreign admixture.\n\nIt is almost a truism to say that the earliest records of all nations are preserved in their national poetry. That the Tamils have been no exception to this rule is proved by their\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Brown's Telugu Grammar.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Y\u00e4pparungalam and Karigge.\n\n\\(^3\\) See Kittel's Canarese Prosody of N\u00e2gavarma.\n\n\\(^4\\) The hackneyed phrase in Tolk\u00e2ppiyam is 'enman\u00e2r pulavar' (so say the learned or poets).\n\n\\(^5\\) I do not include marudp\u00e2, which is not recognized as a separate and distinct metre by the oldest authorities. It is only a mixture of Venpa and Asiriam or Agaval.\n\n\\(^6\\) See Y\u00e4pparungalam. (See Dr. Pope's Tamil Grammar, and his edition of the Kurral.)\n\n\\(^7\\) According to K\u00easava, in the first period of the Canarese poetry as it exists at the present day, each verse-line in its second letter bears an alliteration, this being the same for all the four lines. (See Kittel's N\u00e2gavarma.) This alliteration is identical with the edugai of the Tamil poets. Compare also Y\u00e4pparungalam on m\u00f4nai and edugai.\nmetres and versification, the only department which has been free from Sanskrit intrusion. The possession of numerous varied and polished forms of verse independent of any Sanskrit model leads to the inevitable conclusion that \u00c7entamil had a literature of her own before her contact with Sanskrit. Without a poetic literature metres and rules of versification are meaningless. If that literature had come into being only about the ninth century, as some have supposed, it would be a mere imitation of the Sanskrit in form and substance, as it is in Telugu and Canarese. This point established, it becomes easy to explain why the author of Tolk\u00e4ppiyam makes frequent allusion to old poets, and cites their authority. If Agastya had been the first inventor of \u00c7entamil, or the first author who composed in it, his disciple would simply have quoted his master as the supreme arbiter on all points.\n\nViewed by this light, the distribution of the old language into three dialects of poetic, dramatic and colloquial, by the earliest grammarians, becomes intelligible also. Of the many old dialects of the Tamil language, one which had originally been the local patois of the tract of land lying between Karuv\u00fbr on the East, Maruv\u00fbr on the West, the river Vaigai on the South, and the river Marutam on the North, had, by some fortunate coincidence of circumstances, been singled out among others, by poets for the purpose of versification.\\(^1\\) A certain amount of national literature, consisting for the most part of war-songs and love-ballads, continued to be produced in it. The language thus employed by a succession of poets and bards to celebrate the victories of their heroes or their loves had naturally come to be regarded as classic, and acquired the name of \u00c7entamil (elegant Tamil), while the other dialects were called Koduntamil (or barbarous Tamil). Thus even at the present day many of the words employed in the Malay\u00e2lam language will be considered vulgar by the\n\n\\(^1\\) There were in ancient times thirteen Tamil n\u00e2du or countries, of which the one enclosed in the limits described was called \u00c7entamil-n\u00e2du. The other twelve Koduntamil-n\u00e2du are the following: Tenp\u00e2ndi, Kuttam, Kudam, Kalk\u00e2, V\u00ean, P\u00fbli, Panri, Aruv\u00e2, Aruv\u00e2vadatalai, Cidam, Mal\u00e2du and Punn\u00e2du. (See Beschi's \u00c7atur-Agar\u00e2di.)\nTamils, and some of them might even shock ears unaccustomed to hear them. The poet or grammarian naturally concerned himself with \u00c7entamil, and took no account of Koduntamil. As early as the first Tamil grammarians of Sanskrit schools commenced their work, they found the Centamil itself already differentiated into a poetic and a colloquial form. In every language the exigencies of rhyme and metre have a tendency to separate the poetic style from the living language. In Tamil and other Indian languages where verses are sung and not read, the rules of euphony compel words to undergo still more serious transformations. The extreme fondness of Tamil poets and writers for classical and archaic forms made them retain many of the terms long after they had become totally obsolete. The earliest grammarian whose works are preserved to this day noted down the language as it was in his time. To the spoken language of his day he gave the name of \u2018Iyat\u2019\u00b9 Tamil (natural or ordinary language), to the classical \u2018I\u00e7ai\u2019 Tamil (poetic), and to the mixture of the above two half-verse and half-prose used in dramatic representations \u2018Na\u1e0daga\u2019\u00b2 Tamil (dramatic). There is nothing artificial in it, the whole process seems to repeat itself in almost every language where poets or writers do not draw their terms from the living language and continue to live in the past only. Agastya or the poets of the ninth century jointly or severally could no more have created the Centamil than they could have the Himalaya Mountains. Agastya can be said to be the father of Centamil in one sense only; he was the first probably to introduce a grammatical system founded on a Sanskrit prototype. It was in all likelihood an imitation of some standard Sanskrit grammarian, as Tolk\u0101ppiyam avowedly is of the Aindra Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a. Before him there was an alphabetical system, a literature, and perhaps grammars, which probably were less scientific in their method of treatment than the production of Agastya.\n\n\u00b9 See Tolk\u0101ppiyam, chap. i.\n\u00b2 Among the ancient Tamils dramatic representation was always accompanied by dance. The verses were first employed in a declamatory form, and immediately afterwards were sung in a chorus by the whole band of musicians, and the actor, who went round the stage dancing.\nIt is also now easy to account why the \u00c7entamil vocabulary is so copious, and contains words more easily understood by Telugus and Canarese than by its actual owners. The truth is that \u00c7entamil has in a certain measure preserved forms common to the whole Dravidian parent-stock before the differentiation of the latter into separate languages. Such of those ancient words as have been employed by a succession of \u00c7entamil poets having become fixed in the poetic language have come down to us obsolete, while some of them by a freak of accident having continued as terms of every-day life among the Canarese and Telugus remain so to the present time.\n\nThe fact that the language of the eighth century is nearly modern is perfectly in accord with and confirmatory of what we have seen above of the history of the Tamil language. There is nothing uncommon in the fact that the language should have undergone slow evolution from the days of Solomon and the Phoenicians, and have assumed its nearly modern form about the eighth century of the Christian era. What seems remarkable is that there should be only so little difference between the language of the eighth century and that of the present day\u2014a characteristic indication how language like everything else has changed only very slowly in India, and what length of time was necessary by this slow process for the transition from the old \u00c7entamil to modern Tamil.\n\nI said that the language of the eighth century is seen to be nearly modern, for I find on examining copies of the s\u0101sanas\u00b9 of the Cochin Jews and Persians, that they contain a certain proportion of classic terms and forms. I have noted the following among others: Vidutta, Kilpark', tenpark', nad\u00e4tti, y\u0101laninr\u0101, n\u014dkkip', p\u0101ynda, melpark', irrisaitta, olirinri, etc. These forms are very valuable as affording additional proof that the older forms of \u00c7entamil were not\n\n\u00b9 See South Indian Pal\u00e6ography, pp. 140, 142. If the Centamil had been an artificial style, it is difficult to conceive how Centamil words and forms could have been employed in S\u0101sanas, which are generally written in the plainest language possible.\nin the eighth century in a state of formation, but of gradual disappearance. For if the tendency of the language in the eighth century was to introduce the new forms of words which is styled Centamil, with the stimulus given to that supposed innovation in the ninth and the succeeding centuries, we should have more of those words in daily use now than during the eighth century. The truth, however, seems to be the reverse of this. The language, instead of marching in that direction, seems to be receding from it, and divests itself daily and unconsciously of the older Centamil words and forms.\n\nFrom what has been said above, it results, then, that the ancient Tamils were in possession of an alphabetical system and a certain amount of literature independent of Sanskrit. The Centamil having received a partial culture during an indefinitely long period, had become divided into a poetical and colloquial dialect even so early as the time of Agastya. The age of Agastya\\(^1\\) was in reality a new era in the history of Tamil literature. It was then that Sanskrit influence first began to be felt. Northern religions and social institutions were introduced, and the Brahmanical priesthood, and in its train Buddhists, Nirgranthas, Ajivakas, and other sects began to pour upon the South. It was then that grammars modelled on those of Vedic schools were first propounded by Agastya and his followers. It was then that literature exclusively Dravidian was replaced by Northern traditions and legends. The national literature was slowly modified, its legends transformed, its heroes amalgamated with or lost in the personality of those of the North, and its gods absorbed with a change of name into the Brahmanical pantheon. This process of gradual change and assimilation\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) By Agastya I do not of course mean the mythological personage who drank the ocean, and who is supposed by ignorant people to be still living in the Podiya mountain. I only speak of the historical predecessor of Tolkappiyam, and the author of the grammatical treatise called Agattiyam, quotations from which are cited in old grammars. It has been the fate of all eminent men in India at all times to have their whole history overclouded by and lost in a host of absurd legends. The childish stories current of the great Panini, of his distinguished successor Patanjali, and indeed of all celebrated men of antiquity, are familiar to students of old Indian literature.\nwas a *fait accompli* before the second century A.D., for in Ptolemy and in the Periplus of the Red Sea, the most Southern point of India is known by its Sanskrit name of Kumari.\\(^1\\) The soul, then, of the old Dr\u00e2vidian literature had taken its flight with the advent of Sanskrit, while the body only has survived with a new life infused into it. The old language only, the *Centamil*, that which served as a medium of thought to ancient Tamil poets and bards, remains unaltered, for it could not be easily changed. It had already become fixed, it was rich in resources, it had many different kinds of verses and metres full of rhythm and euphony. It was in some sort the language of the Dravidian troubadours. It was impossible to recast it on a Sanskrit mould, as was done with regard to Canarese and Telugu. So it was left untouched, and has survived to this day unconscious of its origin, and a puzzle to the philologist.\n\nAre there any traces, however small, it may be asked, of this older purely Dr\u00e2vidian literature? In spite of the complete transformation which the ancient Tamil literature has gradually and almost imperceptibly undergone, the comparative process is again going to reveal to us some interesting vestiges of it in the existing literature of the present day. It is the grammatical authors alone who have preserved many of the old peculiarities, and can furnish a trustworthy clue. The Tamil grammarians from the time of Agastya have incorporated, it seems to me, into their grammatical treatises, composed on Sanskrit models, a portion of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The theory of Dr. Caldwell that Jainism must have existed as an undeveloped esoteric faith in the eighth century, and as some considerable portion of the early Tamil literature which we possess is Jaina, the oldest Tamil work could not have been older than the eighth century, is no longer tenable at the present day. Such a hypothesis was no doubt in accord with what little was known of the Jaina sects at the time when the \"Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages\" was first written. Asoka inscriptions now clearly prove the existence of the Nirgrantha Jains in the third century B.C. Varaha-Mihira in the fifth century A.D. gives even the form and appearance of Jain idols (Dr. Kern's Brihat-Sanhita, chap. 58, 45). Hiuen Thsang testifies that during his visit to India the Nirgranthas were more numerous in the South than elsewhere (see Voyages des Pelerins Bouddhistes, par Stan. Julien, vol. vi. p. 119). See also Colonel Yule's \"Marco Polo,\" vol. ii. p. 271, for an able discussion of the age of Sundara Pandiyan, in which the Colonel assigns that king to the eleventh century, and not to the fourteenth, as does Dr. Caldwell.\nthe old Dravidian literature\\(^1\\) called *Porul* (\u0baa\u0bca\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd) which does not properly fall within the scope of grammar in general. *Porul*, literally meaning a thing or object, was in this case limited in its application to two out of the whole range of physical objects or human events which could exercise the intellect or imagination of a people. They were *love* and *war*. The reason of this to us curious distinction is obvious. Turn wherever we may in a primitive society, *love* and *war* were the two *things* or *objects* pre-eminently so called, to which all others were subordinated. They alone were the two themes capable of arousing the enthusiasm of a poet or the strains of a bard. Accordingly we find the grammarians, following in the wake of poets of olden times, classify all possible themes of poetry according to the notion of primitive times under the two categories of *Agap\u2019 Porul* and *Purap\u2019 Porul*, or Internal and External Economics of man. The sum and substance of the former was love, while the second related exclusively to war.\n\nThe *Purap\u2019 Porul*\\(^2\\) gives us a curious idea of the political organization of the ancient Dravidians. According to it all their science of public or state affairs was summarized chiefly under the head of war, which consisted of nine branches:\n\n1. Seizing and carrying away the cattle of the enemy. The victor in a sortie of this kind was entitled to certain military honours, and was crowned by his chieftain with a garland of the flower called *Vedchi*.\n2. Recovering the cattle carried\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) My materials relating to the subject of *Porul* are drawn chiefly from Irayanar-Agap\u2019porul and Nambi Agap\u2019porul, two works of classical authority. A manuscript copy of the former of these works I have been able to consult at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale by the kindness of M. Feer, and a copy of the latter belonging to the British Museum has been kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Bendall. According to Dr. Burnell, Nambi, the author of the Agap\u2019porul, probably lived before the eleventh century (South Indian Palaeography, 127, 2).\n\n\\(^2\\) According to Irayanar, Agap\u2019porul Purap\u2019porul Pannirupadalam is the name of an older work on the subject. I am not aware if copies of it exist at the present day. It is said to have been a production of the first \u00c7angam of Madura, a literary body founded under the auspices of the old P\u00e2ndiyas, and held in the same high esteem throughout all Tamil countries as is accorded in France to the distinguished and learned assembly called the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. There were three of these \u00c7angams at different periods of the P\u00e2ndiyan rule, and Agattiyam (or Agastya) is said to have been a member of the first Academy of Madura, which is alleged to have continued to exist during the reigns of 81 P\u00e2ndiyas. No literary production was supposed to be of any merit unless it had first received the approbation of the \u00c7angam.\naway by the enemy. The warrior who thus vindicated the honour of his chief and people, had the distinction of being crowned with a garland of Karandai or sweet basil. 3. Invading the territory of the enemy. The aggrieved or the aggressor, as the case may be, desires to settle a pending dispute by the arbitrament of war, and marches on the enemy. To the warrior who in an attempt of this nature successfully attacks the enemy is reserved the honour of wearing a garland of Vanchi. 4. The next stage is resisting an invading enemy. He who offered a valiant resistance to the assailants was entitled to a garland of Kanchi. 5. Defending one's fortress. Those who distinguished themselves in that undertaking wore a garland of Noch'i. The enemy who is besieged is forced by necessity or otherwise to fight. 6. So the next head is fighting. Valiant men, who courted danger and flew to battle, adorned themselves with a garland of Tumbai (Phlomus indica). 7. The next stage is gaining the victory, and the heroes who had by prowess of arms vanquished their foes, wore proudly garlands of Vagai (Mimosa flexuosa). Victory, however brilliant, would be useless unless the enemy was rendered powerless. 8. So the last step was taking possession of the fortified places of the enemy. The warriors who succeeded in this sort of exploit were crowned with garlands of Uligai\u00b9 (Illecebrum lanatum).\n\nI need hardly say that the state of society which we infer from the above carries us back to remote times, to the beginnings of Dravidian society, to a semi-agricultural and nomadic state, when the chief wealth of a tribe consists of cattle.\n\nAgap' Porul treats of love, and is conventionally divided into three heads. The first two of the three heads, though\n\n\u00b9 Wearing long hair was an ancient Dravidian custom, and warriors are described as wearing flowers on their kondai (knot of hair) after their victories over the enemy. The Sinhalese, among whom the custom is in vogue at the present day, have evidently copied it from their neighbours, with many other customs, habits, and even elements of civilization. It was certainly not a Brahmanic custom, and could not be said to have been imported from Magadha. The imitation seems to have taken place very early, for Agathomerus, a Greek geographer of the third century A.D., describes the Sinhalese as cherishing their hair like women. The Sinhalese word itself kondai, signifying a knot of hair, is manifestly borrowed from the Tamil.\nintroduced incidentally to play a subordinate part to the third, are, it seems to me, of the utmost importance historically, as furnishing an insight into the constitution of the ancient Dravidian society in pre-Sanskritic times. The most notable points we gather from them were the absence of caste, and of organized kingdoms with crowned chiefs. There were then five different communities, scattered in various parts of the country, and living apart by clans, each having its own tutelary deities, chiefs, habits, and manner of living. With the introduction of the Brahmanical sacerdotalism the names of the indigenous deities were gradually replaced, it seems to me, at least in poetical compositions, by those of the Vedic, an innovation which was naturally to be expected.\n\nThose communities were: 1. Marutanilamakkal or agricultural tribes. 2. Kurinchimakkal or semi-agricultural tribes. 3. Mullaimakkal or pastoral tribes. 4. Neydamakkal or fishing tribes, and 5. Palaimakkal or nomad tribes.\n\n1. Marutamakkal or agricultural tribes. They consisted of uravar (ploughmen), who inhabited fertile and well-watered spots called marutanilam, so called from the maruta trees (Terminalia alata), which flourish in the vicinity of water. Their tutelary deity lost his local name and was merged in the personality of the Vedic Indra.\\(^1\\) They lived upon rice, which they produced, and drank the water of rivers which ran past their fields. Their occupation consisted of sowing, ploughing, reaping, and celebrating festivals. On festive occasions, and in marching to war, they beat a drum called parrai.\\(^2\\) They had also a kind of stringed musical instrument on which they sang a tribal air\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I venture to think that Dionysus, said by Megasthenes to have been worshipped by the inhabitants of the mountains, was not \u00c7iv\u00e2, as is generally supposed, but Skanda, and that Hercules, worshipped by the people of the plains, was not Vishnu, but Indra. This seems to result from the fact that the first northern colonists to the south identified the god of the Dravidian mountaineers with Skanda, and the god of the agricultural tribes with Indra, designations which they must have given in conformity with the usage of the north.\n\n\\(^2\\) The ancestors of paraiyar (Parias) of the present day, the beaters of parai (drum), which is still their occupation in remote country villages, were originally the slaves of the Vell\u00e2lar, and their chief occupation from the remotest time seems to have been beating the drum. In patriarchal and martial times they beat the war-drums of the agricultural tribes, and at the present day they discharge the same functions more peaceably on certain festive and other occasions.\ncalled marutam. Their towns were called per\u00fbr (large village) and m\u00fbdur (old village), and their chiefs were called \u00fbran (lord of the village) or kiravan\u00b9 (elder, owner).\n\nIt seems from the above that the termination ur, added to the names of large towns and even districts at present (as Tanj\u00e2v\u00fbr, Nall\u00fbr), was originally the name of agricultural villages.\n\nAlso the word kiravan seems to throw some light on the origin of the P\u00e2nd\u00eeyas. The words kiravan and p\u00e2ndiyan are in \u00c7entamil synonymous, and at first meant an old man or elder. When nomad communities settle down to agriculture, the old men, who were before burdens to their descendants, become their acknowledged heads, and begin to exercise at first a sort of patriarchal authority over them. With the increase of family this power augments, and he becomes a chieftain. The first of the P\u00e2nd\u00eeyans appears to have been precisely one of those patriarchs of an agricultural community, as his name seems to imply, who perhaps by conquering some of the adjoining tribes had become a sovereign. This seems to be confirmed by tradition, which describes the first of the P\u00e2nd\u00eeyas as a Vell\u00e2lan, the principal landowner caste in all Dr\u00e2vidian countries. It was no doubt the first Br\u00e2hmanical adventurers from the North, who, finding an apparent similitude of names, traced some connection between the P\u00e2ndavas of the North and P\u00e2nd\u00eeyas of the South, and assigned the latter to Chandravamsa.\n\nI also conjecture that Madura, the ancient capital of the P\u00e2nd\u00eeyas, was only a Sanskritized form of M\u00fbdur, the old name for the town of an agricultural community. The\n\n\u00b9 Kira = pandu = old. The word kiravan seems to contain a vast lore of ancient history in itself. Thus in Centamil, kiravan \u2018an old man,\u2019 comes gradually to signify \u2018a chief,\u2019 perhaps with the evolution of society from a nomadic to a settled state. Then it comes to mean \u2018a proprietor,\u2019 implying appropriation of land by the lords of the tribes. The word p\u00e2ndiyan, anciently the synonym of kiravan, had advanced in parallel lines with the latter until it came to signify \u2018a chief,\u2019 and then has become fixed by becoming the designation of a particular dynasty of kings. The word kiravan, less fortunate than its rival p\u00e2ndiyan, came latterly to signify a mere village chief (see Periya Pur\u00e2na). In its third stage, meaning \u2018a proprietor,\u2019 kiravan has found a synonym in Udaiy\u00e2n (lit. \u2018proprietor\u2019), a term which still continues to designate \u2018a village head man\u2019 among the Tamils. The latter word (Udaiy\u00e2n) has itself been luckier than kiravan, for after the fall of the P\u00e2ndiya dynasty a succession of Udaiy\u00e2r reigned for a time at Madura.\nspelling \u039c\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 given by Ptolemy shows that the transformation had taken place very early.\n\n2. Kurrinchim\u00e2kka], or semi-agricultural communities. They lived in hilly districts called Kurrinchi, a name equally derived from the trees called Kurrinchi, which abound in rugged hilly districts. They worshipped a god who was identified with Skanda.\\(^1\\) The name Kurraver, by which they have been known, is preserved to this day, being applied indiscriminately to mountaineers, foresters, snake-catchers, basket-makers, etc. The tracts of land they inhabited abounded in forests of the odoriferous sandal-wood, in which roamed ferocious tigers, bears and elephants, and thronged with swarms of beautiful peacocks\\(^2\\) and parrots. They fed upon bamboo, rice and millet, which alone their barren tracts were capable of yielding, and drank the pure waters of mountain streams. Their tribal tune was a melodious one called Pan, which they sang to the accompaniment of a flute. They marched to battle to the sound of a drum called ton\u1e0dagam, under their chiefs called Chilamban or Verppan. Their towns were but modest clusters of huts, and were appropriately styled \u00c7irruku\u1e0di (little huts). The termination kudi, it is to be remarked, has survived to our day in the names of towns and villages.\n\n3. Mullaim\u00e2kka], or pastoral tribes. They inhabited jungle tracts of land called mullai, and worshipped a deity who corresponded to Krishna,\\(^3\\) perhaps on account of his\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is curious that the worship of Skanda, so far as we now know, seems to have preceded other forms of \u00c7ivaism in the South. Even in the Vedas the name of Skanda appears to have been more ancient than that of Siva. See \u00c7\u00e2ndogya Upanishad, Prap\u00e2thaka 8, Khanda 1: \"They call Sanatkum\u00e2ra Skanda, yea Skanda they call him.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) The peacock, represented as the vehicle of Skanda, was perhaps of Dr\u00e2vidian origin, and was not improbably first in usage among the mountaineers of Southern India. The god and the vehicle both seem to have belonged to the mountain tribes in a peculiar manner, and were perhaps first associated together by them. Varaha-Mihira in the fifth century represents Skanda as mounted on a peacock (see Brihat Samhit\u00e2, chap. 58). The idols of \u00c7iva and Skanda are also mentioned in Patanjali, who lived in the second century B.C. See Weber, Ind. Stud. xiii. p. 344.\n\n\\(^3\\) The worship of Krishna seems to have been very ancient in India. His oldest Dr\u00e2vidian counterpart was probably a local deity, perhaps Karuppen (the dark one), who is even now worshipped among low castes. (See an interesting discussion on Christianity and Krishnaism by Weber, Ind. Stud. vol. i. p. 400,\ndark complexion. Their land was the abode of stags, hares and wild fowls, on which they fed, as well as on the produce of their cattle and grains, which they obtained by exchange. Grappling with bulls, dancing hand in hand with young cowherdesses on luxuriant meadows where their cattle grazed, and playing on their flutes the tribal air of their clans called c\u0101\u1e0d\u0101ri, such were the favourite pastimes of the youthful cowherds. They lived in villages called p\u0101\u1e0di (from p\u0101\u1e0du \u2018sing\u2019), so named perhaps from the clamorous songs and joyous sounds in which their inhabitants delighted, in addition to their bucolic sports. The word p\u0101\u1e0di again is preserved in the names of many towns and villages in Tamil-speaking countries. Their tribal drum was called pambai.\n\n4. Neytam\u00e2kkal, or fishing tribes. They lived along the sea-coast in small fishing villages called pattanam or p\u00e2kkan. Their occupation consisted in fishing, fish-curing, and salt-making, and fish entered largely into their daily consumption. They paid adoration to a god who was the Dr\u00e2vidian counterpart of Varuna. They made use of a drum similar to that of the pastoral tribes, and played a flute called vilari. Their chiefs were called cerppan or pulamban.\n\nHere we find a curious account of the history of the word pattanam or patnam. Originally applied to small fishing villages, patnam now designates only large towns and cities, such as \u00c7ennapatnam (Madras), Muslipatam. This is evidently from the circumstance that fishing villages generally rose to importance by maritime commerce, and very often attained the proportion of large cities. It seems also extremely probable that all the towns on the sea-coast bearing the termination of pattanam (or its abbreviation of\n\n168, and a masterly refutation of it by Barth, The Religions of India, pp. 218\u2013223. Also see Monier Williams, Indian Wisdom, p. 153.) From the occurrence of the name of Krishna in connection with pastoral tribes, even among the Dr\u00e2vidians, we are led to infer that he was considered as patron of the pastoral tribes in Northern India, and was so identified by the colonists from the north. The omission of his name in the Vedas was perhaps owing to the fact that he was not an Aryan god in the earliest times, and was only worshipped by the surrounding aborigines in the North. The name of Krishna occurs however as early as the time of P\u00e2nini, fourth century B.C. (P\u00e2nini, iv. 3, 87).\ngo upon the old lines of tribal distinction. The reason why Manu styled the Dr\u00e2vidian Vell\u00e2lar as degraded Kshatriyas was doubtless owing to the fact that the first Brahman settlers found them almost in exclusive possession of land like the Kshatriyas of the North, while they practised none of the external rites and ceremonies incidental to that caste. As in primitive society, external forms and rites were of the highest importance, those who failed to practise that rigorous formalism were naturally regarded as degraded.\n\n1 The Singhalese, who had borrowed most of their social and political institutions, laws, arts, and sciences from the Tamils, have adopted the distinction of caste also on the same model as the Tamils. Their castes too have nothing in common with the fourfold division of the \u0100ryans of Northern India. Even the word Vell\u00e2la, which designates the highest caste among them, is undoubtedly no other than the Tamil Vell\u00e2lar. They are equally indebted to the same source for the word mudaliy\u0101r, much prized among them as a title of honour.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTE.\n\nIt is but fair to state that, owing to unavoidable causes, the foregoing paper has not had the advantage of the writer's personal revision.

The name of K\u0101nchi already occurs in Patanjali, and some of the names of places given to them by the Vell\u0101\u1e37a colonists are to be seen in Ptolemy\u2019s tables. K\u0101nchi afterwards became the capital of the celebrated Pallava dynasty, to which are attributed the works of Amar\u0101vati and Mah\u0101-mallapura.\n\nIt is very interesting to observe that in India, where everything becomes fossilized, the five different tribes above enumerated have continued to exist side by side for centuries, some of them even to the present day, with their characteristic habits and manners. There are still people called Kallar (thieves) and Marravar, descendants of the old nomads, and Kurraver or foresters.\n\nThe distinction of caste\\(^1\\) was unknown to the ancient Dr\u0101vidians, and was of course introduced by Northern colonists. Before the introduction of the caste system, the patriarchal communities of the South had become organized states. One at least of the chiefs of the agricultural communities, a kiravan or p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan, had subdued the neighbouring chiefs with the help of his clans, called Vell\u0101\u1e37ar, and had assumed regal power in this Mud\u016br (or Madura). The conquered lands were naturally divided among the Vell\u0101\u1e37a clans, who became a class of hereditary landowners,\\(^2\\) and reduced the neighbouring tribes to a sort of quasi-feudal dependence. The caste distinction brought by the Brahmans, although it was in theory the same as in Northern India, was radically different in practice among the Dr\u0101vidians, and continued to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is borne out by the fact that no express mention is made of any caste. No allusion is made to Brahmans, Kshattriyas, Vaisyas, or Sudras. The only distinction is between the high (Uyarn\u1e6d\u014dr) and the low (Irint\u014dr). So there were only patricians and plebeians, lords and slaves, as we find in all primitive communities, and no caste.\n\n\\(^2\\) Papers on Mirasi Rights, Ellis. Also Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc.

XVIII.\u2014Were Zenobia and Zebb\u0101'u Identical? By J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., C.M.G., Litt.D., etc.\n\nThe French translators of the \"Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems,\" by the Arabian traveller and writer Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy, who composed this book in A.H. 332 (A.D. 943), refer their readers, in their general index, from the name of Zebb\u0101'u, which they have unaccountably transliterated as \"Zibba,\" to \"Zenobie,\" though they never once use this latter name in the eighteen pages (vol. iii. pp. 181-198) of the work devoted to the history of this princess. Neither have they said one word in their notes to that part of the volume to show how Zebb\u0101'u may be identified with Zenobia. (But see the concluding passages to this paper on p. 596.)\n\nPossibly, some other continental writer, of whom I confess myself entirely ignorant, may have discussed the question, and to his own satisfaction clearly established the identity of the two princesses, who, though nearly contemporaneous, were not quite so, whose territories were not quite the same, whose capitals were distinct, and whose reported histories differ widely from one another.\n\nThe system of transliteration of Arabian names used by those translators, too, is exceptionally incorrect, even when we admit that every one is free to adopt or invent for this purpose such system as he may prefer, so long as he does not corrupt the names. Both Jewheriyy and Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101diyy, in their lexicons, give the names of Zebb\u0101' and Jedh\u012bma (which, in the usual inaccurate system, would be written Zabb\u0101 or Zabb\u0101 and Jad\u012bmah or Jad\u012bmah), and there is really no excuse for corrupting them into \"Zibba\" and \"Djodaimah.\"\nOther vicious transliterations abound in this work. I pass them over in silence here, and gladly hasten to offer my tribute of admiration for the generally successful manner in which the difficulties of the translation have been surmounted. The onerous task of collating and editing the Arabic text, again, has been extremely well performed, and the warmest thanks of Orientalists have been abundantly merited on the whole, so as greatly to increase one's regret at feeling compelled to find fault with a mere detail.\n\nI have observed that the eminent scholar, Professor W. Robertson Smith, in his recent, very learned treatise on Kinship and Marriage among the Early Arabs, has adopted the theory of the identity of Zebb\u0101'u and Zenobia. I feel, therefore, doubly bound to weigh the discrepancies with the greatest care, and to lay my difficulties before the Royal Asiatic Society with the utmost diffidence. Should there be a possibility for the Members of that learned body and for Orientalists in general, here and on the continent, in India and in America, to judge that I have not done wrong in directing their attention to the apparent incompatibilities that have caused me to doubt, I shall be amply repaid for the labour of preparing this paper; and in any case, I venture to hope they will pardon any excess of zeal in seeking for the truth, if they are led to conclude that I have not succeeded in fully establishing my contention.\n\nMedi\u00e6val writers generally, and eastern medi\u00e6val authors in particular, are not very accurate or discriminating in relating the details of events that occurred before their time, or in countries other than their own. We have to weigh, as is indeed so necessary even with accounts of our own contemporary domestic events, one statement with another, and thus determine as best we may what we consider to be the truth. For example, here is our gossiping Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy, a kind of Arabian Herodotus, who relates, on the one hand, how \u2018Amr son of \u2018Adiyy, nephew of Jedh\u012bma the Leper, killed Zebb\u0101'u\nin about the twenty-fifth year of the Sass\u0101niyy dynasty, A.D. 251, founded the Lakhmiyy succession at \u1e24ira, and reigned a hundred years, goes on then to give in detail the list of his successors and the length of every reign, until Khusrew-Perwiz (King of Persia from A.D. 590 to 628) put an end to the series by causing its last prince, Nu\u2018m\u0101n, to be trodden to death under the feet of an elephant exactly five hundred years later, i.e. in A.D. 251 + 500 = 751; to which must yet be added a period of somewhat more than 26 years for an unknown remnant of the reign of that king, and the 26 that elapsed after him before the Arabian conquest of Persia in A.D. 651. If we allow only four years for the remnant, we shall arrive at A.D. 781 instead of 651; that is, Mes\u2018\u016bdiyy has exaggerated the Lakhmiyy period by 130 years. On the other hand, he has curtailed the reigns of the Gass\u0101n line from thirty-four princes to twelve; he names seven only of these, Nos. 3, 5, 9, 20, 26, 29, and 34 of the chronological table to be found further on, and he does not give the length of the reign of any one of them. He thus reduces the house of Gass\u0101n to a mere fraction of its totality, while its rival of Lakhm is made to appear more ancient and more important than it really was.\n\nTo put my readers in a position to judge of all the phases of the question known to myself, it may be of interest to them to be informed that although, as above stated, the notes to the eighteen pages of Mes\u2018\u016bdiyy\u2019s Meadows of Gold directly concerned with the history of Zebb\u016b\u2018u give no clue to her identification with Zenobia, a note to an incidental recurrence of her name on p. 275 of the same volume gives a reference to the valued work of an eminent French Orientalist, M. Caussin de Perceval, entitled \u201cEssai sur l\u2019histoire des Arabes avant l\u2019islamisme,\u201d etc., published in Paris in 1847, and in which the learned author, to his own satisfaction (as observed above), and in agreement with a previous \u201cconjecture\u201d by the equally esteemed savant M.\nSaint-Martin, has, not \"proved\" that Zebba'u was not Zenobia, but has on the whole, by admittedly surmised alterations, additions, suppressions, and omissions or suppositions of dates, admissible, perhaps, in conjectural history, come to the conclusion that \"le personnage de Zebb\u00e2 (not \"Zibba\" as in the \"Prairies d'Or,\" etc.) . . . m'a paru offrir une telle ressemblance avec Z\u00e9nobie, que j'ai cru pouvoir identifier les deux h\u00e9ro\u00efnes.\"\n\nThis belief of M. Caussin de Perceval, and the previous conjecture of M. Saint-Martin, are, so far as I now know, the grounds for identifying Zebba'u with Zenobia, and under these circumstances I can but submit to my readers what I have been able to gather from various sources, remark that 'Ibnu-Quteyba and 'Eb\u00fb-'l-Fed\u00e2' are equally defective with Mes'udiyy as to the Gass\u00e2n princes, and then leave the main question of the identity or otherwise of Zebba'u and Zenobia to be settled in candid minds by what is herein set forth, or by other more convincing arguments, should such be forthcoming.\n\nIn the first place, the Sih\u00e2h of Jewheriyy and the Q\u00e2m\u00fbs of Fir\u00fbz\u00e2b\u00e2diyy both describe 'Ez-Zebba'u (the female hirsute one) simply as \"queen (or princess, melika, \u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e\u0629\u064c) of 'El Jez\u00eera, \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064f, who is accounted one of the kings or princes of the tribal or local communities \u0645\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0643\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0637\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0628\u0652 (among whom the empire of Darius was parcelled out on the death of Alexander the Great).\" But a difficulty is created at this early stage of the inquiry, by the details added, I believe, erroneously, by the very learned Turkish translator of the Q\u00e2m\u00fbs, in all probability from sources respecting which no information is given. The Turkish Q\u00e2m\u00fbs says as follows, besides several other meanings of the word:\n\n\"Zebba'u is the name of a woman who formerly was queen or princess (melika) of Jez\u00eeretu-'bni-'Umer, and one of the princes of the local communities; she had very long and abundant tresses of hair, being named Zebba'u for this reason.\"\nJezimetu 'l-'Ebresh (Jez\u012bma the Leper), king or prince of \u1e24\u012bra and \u2018Anb\u0101r, had killed the father of Zebb\u0101\u2019u, and had taken possession of his territories. But Zebb\u0101\u2019u, with much trouble, had regained her dominions and had managed to compass the destruction of Jez\u012bma himself, as is related in books of history and in books of proverbs. The proverb: \u2018For a purpose did Qa\u1e63\u012br cut off his own nose,\u2019 took its rise out of her history.\u201d\n\nThis amplification of the story by the Turkish Q\u0101m\u016bs assumes that the \u201cJez\u012bra\u201d mentioned in the \u1e62\u012b\u1e25\u0101h as well as in the Arabic Q\u0101m\u016bs, and which usually (besides other significations) means Mesopotamia, here stands for the town of Jez\u012bretu-'bni-\u2018Umer. This is the ancient \u201cBezabde,\u201d a strongly fortified city on a rocky island in the river Tigris, some seventy or eighty miles above Mew\u1e63il (Mosul of maps), and in latitude 37\u00b0 27\u2032 N. longitude 42\u00b0 2\u2032 E., in the neighbourhood of Jebel J\u016bdiyy, the \u201cArarat\u201d on which, according to all Arabian legend, Noah\u2019s ark rested on the subsidence of the deluge; our modern Christian Ararat in Armenia being unknown to Arabians. The assumption is probably founded on some legendary basis, but it is not in accordance with the details of the story of Zebb\u0101 and Jedh\u012bma, as given by Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy, where the river Tigris is not once alluded to, the Euphrates alone being there in question.\n\nMes\u02bf\u016bdiyy\u2019s account might now be given, as re-translated by myself, had a few more pages been available, but in default of space, reference, if required, must be made to the French versions. The passages I had selected show how unreliable are the stories told by Arabian authors relating to times anterior to Isl\u0101m. Here we have a Sumeyda\u2019, son of Hewber, king of the Amalekites, and fighting against Joshua son of Nun (about fourteen hundred years before our Era); and then we have his son \u2018Udheyna made king by the Romans. If this \u2018Udheyna be intended for the Odenathus of\nRoman History, husband of Zenobia, and murdered with her suspected privity in A.D. 266, the story would appear to suppose that Sumeyda\u2019s life extended to the ultra-Methuselah period of about 1600 years, though it may be contended that \u2018Udheyyna, the son of Joshua\u2019s contemporary, was not the same person with the \u2018Udheyyna of whom the Zebb\u0101\u2019u of Mes\u2018\u016bdiyy was the great-great-great-granddaughter.\n\nI find in Numbers xxvi. 32, mention made of a contemporary of Joshua who was named Sumeyda\u2019, \u0634\u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0647, \u0634\u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0647, rendered \u201cShemida\u201d in our version. The two names are evidently one, and this one had perhaps been foisted into Arabian history by some zealous Jewish convert to \u2019Isl\u0101m in its very early days. I do not find that Joshua fought the Amalekites in any other battle than that at Rephidim, and no king\u2019s name is mentioned there. The Shemida of our version was a Jew, chief of a family that was a branch of the half-tribe of Manasseh.\n\nBut the \u2018Udheyyna who was a king under the Romans, and was great-great-great-grandfather to Zebb\u0101\u2019u, could not be Odenathus husband to Zenobia. Neither, by Mes\u2018\u016bdiyy\u2019s account, could she be the Roman Zenobia, wife and widow of Odenathus, who had had a former husband before Odenathus, and a son named \u201cWaballath\u201d or \u201cAthenodorus\u201d by that husband. From this alias we may infer that the son\u2019s correct Arabic name was Wehbu-l-L\u0101t, the Gift of (the goddess) L\u0101t, \u0644\u0627\u062a; and that L\u0101t was considered to be Athene, Minerva, as far as he was concerned. Zebb\u0101\u2019u was a virgin when wooed by Jedh\u012bma the Leper, her father\u2019s slayer; she must be supposed to have been so when she put him to death; and there is no mention of her having changed her condition after that event, until she fell a victim herself to the plot of Qa\u1e63\u012br. Whereas the Roman Zenobia, twice a wife, had two families; for \u201cher surviving son\u201d was made king of a petty state in Armenia, and \u201cher daughters were married into noble Roman families.\u201d\nJedh\u012bma is said by Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy to have lived twenty-three years during the reigns of Artaxerxes son of B\u0101bek, and of Sapor the First, son of Artaxerxes. This Artaxerxes is held by chronologists to have become king of Persia in A.D. 226, reigning till A.D. 240, and being succeeded by Sapor, who died in A.D. 273. Jedh\u012bma, then, must have been put to death by Zebb\u0101\u02bfu in A.D. 249, and she may have been killed by \u2018Amr, nephew to Jedh\u012bma, with the help of Qa\u1e63r, in about A.D. 251; whereas Zenobia was captured by Aurelian in A.D. 273, the year of Sapor\u2019s death, and was carried to Italy in A.D. 274, never again quitting the land of her exile. That is to say, Zebb\u0101\u02bfu the virgin was killed twenty-three years, or so, before Zenobia, the twice-married wife, widow, and mother of sons and daughters, was carried alive, as captive, to Rome. Can it be possible, under these circumstances, that Zebb\u0101\u02bfu was Zenobia?\n\nAnother very markworthy difference between the two queens is, that while Zenobia was queen of Palmyra, the Tedmur of the Hebrews and Arabians (\u05ea\u05b5\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05e8, \u05ea\u05b5\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05e8, which words appear to be related to destruction, and have no connection with the date-palm or the dry date-fruit, \u05ea\u05b5\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05e8, \u05ea\u05b5\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05e8, as some have said they have), with a dominion extending to the frontiers of Bithynia, the city of Zebb\u0101\u02bfu was on the west bank of the Euphrates, somewhere between Circesium and Thapsacus. Tedmur is never once mentioned by Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy in his story of Zebb\u0101\u02bfu, nor does he mention Zebb\u0101\u02bfu in his notices of Tedmur. This would be surprising if Zebb\u0101\u02bfu were Zenobia, for Tedmur has always been famous among the Arabians, as the city built for Solomon by his vassal genii.\n\nZebb\u0101\u02bfu is only a nickname, meaning the hirsute or long-haired woman. Her real name is said to have been Na\u02bf\u012bla, \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064c; and out of the nickname Zebb\u0101\u02bfu one cannot possibly form the word Zenobia, though we have seen that Odenathus is a corruption of the Arabic \u2018Udheyna. We may conjecture\nthat Zenobia was a corruption of Dhen\u016bb, but this name is applied only to a long-tailed horse or mare, as dheneb signifies a tail. Even if Dhen\u016bb were used as a woman's name, it would have been corrupted into Denubia or Denobia, not Zenobia. There is an Arabic woman's name, however, that could, imaginably, become Zenobia, and this is the name Zeyneb. One of the wives and one of the daughters of Mu\u1e25ammed bore this name, which is now very much used in \u2019Isl\u0101m. Mu\u1e25ammed is said to have endearingly modified the name of that wife into Zun\u0101b, as we say Maggy for Margaret, etc.; and from Zun\u0101b to Zenobia is not so violent a transition. Local Syrian modifications yet nearer to Zenobia may be, or may have been in use; but Zebb\u0101\u2019u never, in my estimation, could have become Zenobia, or Zenobia become Zebb\u0101\u2019u.\n\nThere is a difficulty arising between the alternative stories given above from Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy, in one of which he explicitly states that Zebb\u0101\u2019u was a virgin when Jedh\u012bma wooed her, and says nothing afterwards of her marrying or having a child until she was killed by \u2018Amr, Jedh\u012bma\u2019s nephew. In the other, however, he mentions a Zebb\u0101\u2019u, whose son was commonly known by her name only; i.e. he was commonly called the son of Zebb\u0101\u2019u, though it is a matter of doubt whether this son of Zebb\u0101\u2019u was \u2018Amr son of \u1e6carib, the father of our Zebb\u0101\u2019u, who killed Jedh\u012bma, his slayer; or whether he was \u1e24ass\u0101n son of \u2018Udheyna, son of \u1e6carib, son of \u1e24ass\u0101n. There is an obscurity about \u2018Udheyna, as there is a mention of \u2018Udheyna son of Sumeyda\u2019, and of \u2018Udheyna son of \u1e6carib. But these are all given as ancestors, more or less remote, of the \u2018Amr who was the father of our Zebb\u0101\u2019u. Jedh\u012bma killed her father, \u2018Amr, after many battles, for which no dates are given; and then Zebb\u0101\u2019u killed Jedh\u012bma in the twenty-third year of the S\u016bs\u0101niyy dynasty, A.D. 249, being killed herself not very long afterwards by his nephew, say in A.D. 251, twenty-three years before Zenobia was carried to Rome. Any former\nZebb\u0101\u2019u, therefore, must have lived at a date more remote still from that of Zenobia\u2019s captivity, and be so much further removed from identity with Zenobia. If a Zebb\u0101\u2019u were really mother of \u1e24ass\u0101n son of \u2018Udheyna, such Zebb\u0101\u2019u and such \u2018Udheyna must have lived more than a hundred years before Zenobia and Odenathus.\n\nMes\u02bf\u016bdiyy, then, writing in A.H. 332 (A.D. 943), leaves the question very strongly decided against the possible identity of his Zebb\u0101\u2019u with the Roman Zenobia of Palmyra.\n\nIn the History of the Res\u016bliyy dynasty of Yemen by \u1e24asan son of \u2018Aliyy, \u2019El-Khazrej\u012byy, of which a unique manuscript copy exists in the Library of the India Office, a gift of Warren Hastings, there is recorded in the preliminary chapter, from an older work by \u2019Eb\u016b-l-\u1e24asan \u1e24amza son of \u1e24asan, of \u2019Ispah\u0101n, supplemented from other writers, the whole list of thirty-four princes of the Gass\u0101n line who acted as viceroys of Rome in trans-Jordanic Syria, from the time when they overcame their Sel\u012b\u1e25 predecessors in that high office, until the last of the line was expelled from the province by the victorious hosts of \u2019Isl\u0101m in the time of the second caliph, \u2018Umer son of \u2019El-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b, in about A.D. 639. The Res\u016bliyy dynasty claimed to be the descendants of the fugitive; and for this reason the ancient history of the line possessed a special interest for them. The length of the reign of each Syrian prince of the house of Gass\u0101n is given, with a few exceptions, so as to reach a total of 616 years.\n\nThe third king of the Syrian line, \u1e24\u0101rith the Great, is apparently the \u201cAretas the King\u201d of 2 Corinthians xi. 12, who ruled for twenty-two years. The conversion of St. Paul at Damascus is put in A.D. 35, when he had to escape thence by stealth, by reason that \u201cthe governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes, desirous to apprehend\u201d him.\n\nBut this king, \u1e24\u0101rith the Great, was also father-in-law to Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, murderer of John the\nBaptist, to whom Pilate, according to St. Luke, sent Jesus before he delivered him over to the Jews for execution. When Herod took to wife the profligate Herodias, the wife of his own brother, the daughter of \u1e24\u0101rith quitted him in disgust, and \u1e24\u0101rith invaded the territory of Herod, inflicting a defeat on his forces. This must have been before A.D. 38, when Herod, after the death of Tiberius, went to Rome and was exiled, first to Gaul, and then to Spain, where he died. It was, perhaps, about the year A.D. 34, after the death of John the Baptist and the crucifixion. Herod had then been tetrarch about thirty-four years, having been appointed on the death of his father B.C. 4. If \u1e24\u0101rith began to reign as late as A.D. 33, one year before he punished Herod, then, as his father, \u2018Amr son of Jefna, reigned only five years, his grandfather Jefna, the conqueror of the Sel\u012b\u1e25 tribe, will have died in A.D. 28, only five years after the date of his victory, as 639\u2013616 = A.D. 28, the date of the commencement of the Gass\u0101n supremacy. This being accepted as, at any rate, approximately correct, the dates of reigns of the Gass\u0101n princes will fall as in the following table:\n\n**Chronology of the Syrian Princes of Gass\u0101n.**\n\n| No. | Name                        | Reigns          | Years |\n|-----|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| 1   | Jefna I, son of \u2018Amr, son of \u2018\u0100mir becomes prince | 17              |       |\n|     | defeats the Sel\u012b\u1e25 tribe and becomes king | 23              |       |\n|     | dies, having been prince and king 45 years | 28              |       |\n| 2   | His son \u2018Amr I. reigns        | 5 years, dying  | 33    |\n| 3   | His son \u1e24\u0101rith I. the Great (Aretas), reigns | 22              | 55    |\n| 4   | His brother Tha\u2019leba reigns   | 17              | 72    |\n| 5   | His son \u1e24\u0101rith II. the Halting, reigns | 20              | 92    |\n| 6   | His son Jebela I. reigns      | 40              | 132   |\n| 7   | His son \u1e24\u0101rith III. the Less, reigns | 10              | 142   |\n| A.D. | Event                                                                 |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 8    | His son Mundhir I. reigns . . . 3 dying                               |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 9    | His brother Nu'man I. the Great, 15                                  |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 10   | His brother Nu'man II. the Younger, 13                                |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 11   | His brother Jebela II. reigns . . 34                                  |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 12   | His brother 'Eyhem I. reigns . . 3                                    |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 13   | His brother 'Amr II. reigns . . 26                                    |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 14   | The son of Nu'man (9), Jefna II. 3                                   |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 15   | Nu'man III. grandson of Mundhir (8), reigns . . . . . 1                |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 16   | Nu'man IV. son of 'Amr bin Mundhir bin Mundhir (VIII). 27             |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 17   | Jebela III. son of Nu'man, reigns 16                                 |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 18   | Nu'man V. son of 'Eyhem bin Harith, reigns . . . . 22                 |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 19   | Nu'man VI. son of Harith bin 'Eyhem, reigns . . . . 18                |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 20   | Mundhir II. son of Harith bin 'Eyhem, reigns . . . . 32               |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 21   | Mundhir III. son of Nu'man, reigns 19                                 |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 22   | 'Amr III. son of Nu'man, reigns 33                                    |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 23   | Hujr, son of Nu'man, reigns . 26                                      |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 24   | Harith IV. son of Hujr, reigns . 12                                   |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 25   | Jebela IV. son of Harith, reigns 19                                   |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 26   | Harith V. son of Jebela, reigns . 21                                  |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 27   | Nu'man VII. son of Harith, reigns 37                                  |\n|      |                                                                      |\n| 28   | 'Amr IV.

Hamza distinctly states that thirty-four princes of the Gass\u0101n line ruled in Syria from Jefna I. to Jebela VI., and gives the period of each prince's rule, with two exceptions. By some fatality, however, a few of the princes are omitted in the Khazrejiyy manuscript, and these have been inserted here from other authors quoted by Khazrejiyy, of a less complete character. The two reigns left unrecorded in Hamza's list as to their duration have been of advantage, as they have permitted hypothesis to be used in their cases, to bring the total to conform to three known or reported facts, related by quite independent authorities.\n\nWe have, in the first place, the king Aretas mentioned by St. Paul. We have that same king warring successfully against Herod; and we have the facts that Pilate sent Jesus to Herod before the crucifixion; as also that Herod went to Rome after the death of Tiberius. These events fix approximately the date of the rule of Aretas (\u1e24\u0101rith the Great, son of \u02bfAmr son of Jefna).\n\nThe second fact is that Mu\u1e25ammed is said by one writer to have been \"sent\" during the rule of \u02bfAwf son of \u02bfAmr \u02bfEb\u016b-Shemir. Now, as \u02bfAwf died in A.D. 592, after a rule of forty-five years, this \"sending\" of Mu\u1e25ammed, usually understood as meaning his being commissioned to announce \u1e24isl\u0101m, must here mean his birth, which happened in A.D. 571, in the \"year of the elephant\" of \u02bfEbreh\u0101, while Khusrew N\u016bshirew\u0101n was king of Persia, who died in A.D. 579. If we are to take the \"sending\" as the prophetic mission, we must put it in the reign of \u02bfEyhem II., son of \u02bfAwf, since the mission is dated in A.D. 610, when Mu\u1e25ammed was forty years of age, and while Khusrew Perwiz ruled in Persia.\n\nThe third fact is the expulsion or voluntary exile of\nJebela VI., in A.D. 639, after he had embraced Islam, and had accompanied the caliph 'Umer, on his return from Jerusalem, to the pilgrimage at Mekka. He was there performing the circumambulation of the Cubical House, his mantle was inadvertently trod upon by a man behind him, and he inflicted on the offender a blow in the face that knocked out some of his teeth. The injured man carried his suit before the caliph, who suggested to Jebela that he should compensate the man privately. Jebela urged due consideration for his princely rank; but 'Umer told him that all Muslims being brethren and equals before the law, he should himself feel bound to command open compensation if the complainant were not privately satisfied and so silenced. Jebela asked for a remand till the morrow, and this was accorded. He then decamped by night, repaired to Antioch, renounced Islam, and rejoined the Christian fold, fleeing shortly afterwards to Constantinople in the suite of the Roman Emperor Heraclius.\n\nIf the foregoing chronological table be approximately correct, then the thirteenth prince of the Gassan line, 'Amr II., son of Mundhir son of \u1e24\u0101rith the Less, who ruled twenty-six years, was lord of the Arabians of trans-Jordanic Syria when 'Erd-Sh\u012br son of B\u0101bek founded the Sasanian monarchy of Persia in A.D. 226; the fifteenth, Nu'm\u0101n III., who ruled only one year, was prince when Sapor I. succeeded in A.D. 240; the sixteenth, Nu'm\u0101n IV., was ruling when Odenathus was murdered in A.D. 266; and the seventeenth, Jebela III., who reigned sixteen years, was on the throne when Sapor died in the same year that Zenobia was captured by Aurelian, A.D. 273, and carried to Rome in A.D. 274. But the father of this Jebela, the above-mentioned Nu'm\u0101n III., must have been still reigning when Jedh\u012bma the Leper was put to death by Zebb\u0101'u in A.D. 249, twenty-three years after the accession of 'Erd-Sh\u012br son of B\u0101bek, and also when Zebb\u0101'u was killed in turn by Jedh\u012bma's nephew, 'Amr son of\n'Adiyy, in about A.D. 251, twenty-three years before Zenobia was carried to Rome, never to return.\n\nThere is, however, a most important remark to offer here with respect to the date of Zebb\u0101'u and of her death. \u1e24amza of Isf\u0101h\u0101n is far more correct and careful in his chronology than is Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy, as has been shown by his list of the princes of Gass\u0101n, and the remarks on the exaggeration of Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy in his list of the Lakhmiyy princes of \u1e2a\u012bra. But this exaggeration requires, according to \u1e24amza's account of the Lakhmiyy dynasty, to be still further corrected in a way that throws the date of the death of Zebb\u0101'u back nearly a century, and removes her far away from the time of Zenobia. It must be remembered that \u1e24amza was really contemporaneous with Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy, his book having been finished eighteen years only later than the date A.H. 332, so frequently adduced by Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy in the Meadows of Gold. The correction is this: According to \u1e24amza, instead of Jedh\u012bma's having been killed and having been succeeded by his nephew 'Amr son of 'Adiyy in the year A.D. 249, the ninth year of Sapor I., and 23 years after the accession of Artaxerxes, Jedh\u012bma was killed at such time that, out of 'Amr's total reign of 118 years (60 only being allowed to Jedh\u012bma), ninety-five were past when Artaxerxes became king of Persia. Zebb\u0101'u must then, by this chronology, have been killed by 'Amr about A.D. 156, in the reign of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, one hundred and twenty-three years before Zenobia was defeated by Aurelian. The lengths of reigns assigned by \u1e24amza to the Lakhmiyy princes that reigned at \u1e2a\u012bra after the death of 'Amr son of 'Adiyy, added together, make a total of 419 years, or more than thirty years over what is required to bring us up to the invasion of \u1e2a\u012bra by Kh\u0101lid son of Welid and the final overthrow of the Lakhmiyy dynasty. But as a reign of 114 years is given by \u1e24amza to 'Imru'u-l-Qays, the successor of 'Amr son of 'Adiyy, those 31 years may be well deducted, so as still to leave him a\nreign of 83 years, whereas Mes\u02bf\u016bdiyy gives him but a modicum of sixty, the length of reign of his son \u2018Amr, according to \u1e24amza.\n\nShould these details of the reigns of the Syrian viceroys of the Gass\u0101n line be found on investigation to be moderately correct, they will form in themselves a not uninteresting chapter of history, and may help to fix the date of many an obscure event connected with the Roman domination in Syria, and with the fortunes of Christianity there. The true history of the rival line of Lakhm at \u1e24\u012bra, descendants of Jedh\u012bma\u2019s sister and her son \u2018Amr son of \u2018Adiyy, may be deduced from the contemporaries of the two lines, and from the known dates of the S\u016bs\u0101niyy sovereigns of Persia; and hence the date of many an Arabian event may become determinable. It is not a little singular that no mention of Zebb\u0101\u02beu or Zenobia is found in them.\nART. XIX.\u2014The First Mandala of the Rig-Veda. By Frederic Pincott, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe paper which I formerly wrote on the Rig-Veda\\(^1\\) was merely intended to lay down the general principles which guided the ancient Arranger of that venerable collection of poems. It was my good fortune to be the first to lay before scholars the following discoveries:\u2014\n\n1. That the hymns of the Rig-Veda are arranged in the order of their diminishing length.\n2. That the First Mandala differs from the rest, and that it possesses a special arrangement of its own.\n3. That Mandalas II. to VII. are uniform in character.\n4. That the hymns of the Ninth Mandala are manifestly arranged according to the metre and length of the hymns.\n5. That certain long hymns in the Rig-Veda can be resolved into short sets of verses.\n6. That the Tenth Mandala consists of, at least, two collections, showing a distinct mark of cleavage between the 84th and 85th hymns.\n\nI am, of course, pleased to find that my views have obtained general acceptance, and that M. Abel Bergaigne has founded upon them two interesting papers in the Journal Asiatique.\\(^2\\) My present purpose is to carry the matter further, by endeavouring to clear the way for a clear apprehension of the nature of the First Mandala.\n\nM. Bergaigne thinks my original suggestion about the First\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal of the Roy. Asiat. Soc., Vol. XVI. Part II.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sept.-Oct., 1886, p. 183; Feb.-March, 1887, p. 191. As the whole of M. Bergaigne's papers are based on my discoveries, it would have been more courteous had that gentleman made a more prominent allusion to me than an obscure reference at the end of the first paper, for the purpose of dissenting from an unimportant detail in my long article.\nM\u0101ndala rather risky. It is, according to him, an \"ing\u00e9nieuse mais tr\u00e8s-aventureuse hypoth\u00e8se.\" Three years ago I pointed out certain facts which indicated that the First M\u0101ndala was a ritual, consisting of hymns selected from those of the various families of Rishis to whom other M\u0101ndalas are ascribed. M. Bergaigne does not attempt to discuss this view; he simply dismisses it with an epithet, and in its place he supplies an elaborate exposition of the M\u0101ndala, in the course of which he is driven to divide the book into sections, to split up single hymns into fragments, to imagine interpolations, to reject hymns altogether,\u00b9 and having, by these hazardous courses, produced a number of clusters of hymns, he ends with the statement that, \"on n'aper\u00e7oit qu'une seule succession \u00e0 laquelle il semble possible d'attacher quelque importance.\" Thus the entire explanation ends, to all intents and purposes, in a fiasco. In proof that I do not exaggerate, I cite M. Bergaigne's final remark on this M\u0101ndala:\u2014\"Il est impossible qu'une samhita aussi syst\u00e9matique que celle qui comprend les M\u0101ndalas II.-VII., ait commenc\u00e9 originairement par le M\u0101ndala I. tout entier, sous sa forme actuelle. . . . Je ne vois donc que deux hypoth\u00e8ses possibles : ou bien le M\u0101ndala I. a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 tout entier apr\u00e8s coup ; ou bien il se composait primitivement d'une seule collection, qui est devenue le noyau autour duquel se sont group\u00e9es successivement les autres.\"\n\nThis plain statement of defeat surely renders it desirable to adduce some of the additional evidence which I formerly withheld, confirmatory of my apparently bold assertion, that the First M\u0101ndala is, in reality, an orderly ritual. To make this clear, I will first indicate the influence under which the Sanh\u012bt\u0101 was arranged; next, I will show that the First M\u0101ndala is, in a way, eclectic; thirdly, I will point out unmistakeable evidence of orderly arrangement; and, lastly, I will adduce some proof of its ritualistic character.\n\n1. It has long been known that the \u0100ngirasas were greatly concerned in the arrangement of the entire Sanh\u012bt\u0101, and in\n\n\u00b9 At the end of his second paper, M. Bergaigne gives a list of 184 hymns, and parts of hymns, in the Rig-Veda which he regards as interpolations.\nthe development of the ceremonial generally.\\(^1\\) A very large number of the hymns in the Rig-Veda are directly ascribed to members of the Angiras family; and this also was the family which gave canonical sanction to the Atharva-Veda;\\(^2\\) which must have been done at an early date, for the book is mentioned as a Veda in the \u015aatapatha-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The \u015a\u0101nkh\u0101yana-s\u016btra (xvi. 1) particularly associates the Angiras family with the Soma.\\(^3\\) Shadguru\u015bishya intimates, in one of his anecdotes, that the \u0100ngirasas claimed authority over Ma\u1e47\u1e0dalas not ascribed to members of their family. It is related that \u015aaunahotra (of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja branch of the Angiras family) pleased Indra, who thereupon changed his name to Gr\u012btsamada, and caused him to be born in the race of Bhrigu, and to become the seer of the Second Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala. This tale seems obviously designed to show that the Second Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala owes its existence to an ancient representative of the Angiras family. A further indication of union between the \u0100ngirasas and the Bh\u0101rgavas is found in the fact that the Atharva-veda\u2014the special child of the Angiras family\u2014is known as the \u201cBh\u1e5bigvangiras,\u201d as well as the \u201cAtharv\u0101ngiras,\u201d thus associating the name of Bh\u1e5bigu with the production.\\(^4\\) Again, the story of \u015aunah\u1e63epha is calculated to show how deeply the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras are indebted to the \u0100ngirasas, and indeed owe their very Brahmanhood to the dominant family.\n\nThe foregoing facts show that the Angiras family claimed an interest in nearly the whole of the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, the Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, and portions of the Ninth and Tenth Ma\u1e47\u1e0dalas. A very similar state of things is found in the case of the \u0100di Granth. That book is well known to have been arranged by the fifth Guru, Arjun; and, having counted the verses, I am able to state that, out of the 15,575 stanzas\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the 83rd hymn of this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala Gotama makes the following statements about his family: \u201cThe \u0100ngirasas first prepared the sacrificial food, and then, with kindled fire, (worshipped) with a most holy rite: they, the institutors (of the ceremony), acquired all the wealth of P\u0101ni, comprising horses, and cows, and (other) animals.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) See the 80th hymn of this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala.\n\n\\(^3\\) See Prof. Max M\u00fcller's *Ancient Sanskrit Literature*, p. 38.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ibid. p. 446.\nwhich the book contains, no fewer than 6204 stanzas were composed by Arjun, the Arranger, himself.\n\nThe predominating influence of the Angiras family is further indicated by the fact that, of the Forty-nine Gotras into which the faithful were divided, no less than thirty-eight are those of \u00c2ngirasas, and their friends the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras and Bh\u0101rgavas. Surely here is enough to prove the powerful influence of this great family, and to relieve one of any charge of venturesomeness in ascribing the arrangement of the Rig-Veda to Angiras influence. In the First Mandala this is yet further marked by the exclusion of \u00c2treya hymns, and by the inclusion of both branches of the Angiras family.\n\n2. The eclectic character of the First Mandala is demonstrated by the fact that it contains hymns of seven out of the eight great families of Rishis.\\(^1\\) This, to my mind, is conclusive on the question. No other portion of the Rig-veda is of this mixed character. The Eighth Mandala (which contains hymns by four families) is in no respect representative; for nearly all its hymns are by \u00c2ngirasas, the only exceptions being one by a K\u0101\u015byapa, one by an \u00c2treya, and three by Bh\u0101rgavas.\n\nThe First Mandala was certainly intended to bring together representatives of the various families of Rishis. There are hymns by the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras, by both the Gautama and the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja branches of the \u00c2ngirasas, by the V\u0101sish\u1e6dhas, by the K\u0101\u015byapas, by the Bh\u0101rgavas, and by the \u0100gastyas. The hymns of these families are arranged in a definite order, as will be shown further on. The only family excluded is that of the \u00c2treyas; but there are reasons which satisfactorily account for this exclusion.\n\nIn the first place, the theology of the Rig-veda is preeminently Solar; and this is strikingly apparent in the First Mandala. The Rishis represented in this Mandala are, all of them, authors of hymns to Agni, the typical Solar deity. It is\n\n\\(^1\\) The \u015aatapatha-Brahmana reckons only seven Brahmarshis, by omitting Agasti from its list; but Agasti is a Devarshi of the highest rank, and the progenitor of an orthodox Gotra or family.\nalso clear that the \u00c2ngirasas were specially interested in the Solar cult; indeed, one of the names of Agni is \"Angiras,\" and, in the 21st hymn of this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, Agni is said to have been \"the first Angiras Rishi.\"\u00b9\n\nAtri is the only Maharshi who never hymned the flaming Agni. Some of Atri's descendants did celebrate Agni, as is seen in the Fifth Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala; but Atri himself was the patron of the Moon, not of the Sun. In my former paper I pointed to the legend that the Moon was produced from the flash of Atri's eye. The special connection of the \u00c2treyas with Lunar worship is emphasized by the fact that the first hymn of their Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is by Budha, the regent of the Moon; and an indication of conversion to \u00c2ngirasas views is plainly shown by the second hymn. This curious poem alludes to the tradition that its author Vri\u015ba, of the Atri race, who was Purohita to the Ikshv\u0101kus, through unskilfulness killed a Brahman child. It was not until Vri\u015ba had acquired the \u00c2ngirasa-mantra that he recovered intelligence and restored the boy to life. The seventh verse of this hymn says, \"Thou hast liberated the fettered \u0160unah\u1e63epha from a thousand stakes; for he was patient in endurance; so, Agni, free us from our bonds.\" Here we have the Rishi of a race specially devoted to the Moon, offering laudation to Agni, the Solar representative, for a boon conferred on the \u00c2ngirasas. Translated into history, this tradition obviously means that the devotees of a Lunar cult were won over to the Solar cult under Angiras influence. This original connection with Lunar ideas is, in itself, a sufficient reason for exclusion from a specially Solar ritual, such as the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala appears to be. But there is another and more cogent reason for the exclusion of \u00c2treya hymns from that book.\n\n\u00b9 Here it may be pointed out that the names of the families represented in the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala themselves indicate Solar attributes; thus, Bhrigu \"the scorching,\" \u00c2ngiras \"the swift,\" Vi\u015bvamitra \"the universal friend,\" Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha \"most wealthy.\" The meaning of Agasti is doubtful; the suggested rendering, \"mountain-thrower,\" is more than problematical. On the other hand, the meaning of Atri \"the devourer,\" and that of Ka\u015byapa \"with black teeth,\" may imply allusions to Lunar eclipse. These are probably mere coincidences; but they curiously accord with the rest of the evidence adduced. Atri may mean \"the devourer (of clarified butter),\" and Ka\u015byapa's having been the first human pupil of Agni, would connect these two also with Solar worship.\nThe \u0100treyas were the friends of the Gaup\u0101yanas,\\(^1\\) who were dismissed from their office of Purohita to the Ikshv\u0101ku race. They made themselves obnoxious in consequence of their dismissal; but were punished by the incantations of their rivals, who are termed m\u0101y\u0101r\u012bn \u201cpossessors of magic arts.\u201d When we remember that the \u0100ngirasas were the Rishis of the Atharva-veda, we see, in this tradition, the record of an enmity between the believers in, and the disbelievers in, the magic formul\u00e6 of the Atharvans; and, as the \u0100ngirasas ultimately gained the ascendancy, they excluded from their ritual the hymns of their opponents.\n\nBut this tradition has another phase. We know that Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra and Vasish\u1e6dha were the rival orthodox Purohitas of the Ikshv\u0101kus, and that Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was connected, in an especially cordial manner (by the \u015aunahsepha affair), with the great Angiras family. Here we have an additional reason for the exclusion, from an \u0100ngirasas ritual, of the hymns written by the friends of those who had been dismissed by the Ikshv\u0101kus, the patrons both of themselves and of their friends the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras.\n\nThe exclusion of the hymns of the \u0100treya family from the First Mandala is certainly remarkable; but the reasons given above are sufficiently cogent to account for it. It may be objected that it is not an easy thing to reject the hymns of an undoubted Devarshi, and unsettle the traditions of so conservative a faith as that of Brahmanism. To this I reply, that the \u0100treyas do not seem to have been popular. They founded only two Gotras out of the Forty-nine, and were thus, apparently, but little known. Furthermore, the Lunar devotees may have been held to be sufficiently represented by the hymn of Ka\u015byapa, the pre-eminent Rishi of the Soma. The fact that the very centre of the Mandala is given to the representative of the Soma or Lunar cult may well be held to have satisfied the claims of both the \u0100treyas and the Ka\u015byapas.\n\nThe rejection of Atri\u2019s family necessarily reduced to six\n\n\\(^1\\) This is plainly shown by the inclusion of the Gaup\u0101yana hymn in the Fifth or \u0100treya Mandala.\nthe number of families taking part in the ritual. A change in number is a far more patent fact than a change of names. There is abundant evidence to show that the ancient originators of Brahmanism were spoken of as the Seven Rishis. In order to make the First Mandala conform to this recognized number, after the rejection of Atri, the simple expedient was adopted of admitting both branches of the Angiras family. The Seven Rishis are not always mentioned under the same names. Conflicting lists of names are given in different works; and, although some of these varying names are equivalents of each other, the diversities are sufficient to show that the only thing settled was the number Seven. This number was preserved, as we have seen, by dividing the \u00c2ngirasas into two branches.\n\n3. As to the arrangement of the First Mandala, my hypothesis is, that the Angiras family of worshippers of Agni by means of Soma, placed the only hymn invoking Agni written by the peculiar Rishi of the Soma (Ka\u015byapa), as a centre, in conjunction with the antique poem of the so-called R\u00e2jarshis, addressed to Indra. On each side of these they placed their own hymns to Agni and Indra, bearing the name of the progenitor of their race, the Devarshi Kutsa. Outside these again were placed hymns from the other branch of their family, thereby monopolizing the posts of honour. Two other families were then admitted, one on each side, flanked by other collections of \u00c2ngirasa hymns; ending, at the two extremes, with the hymns of two other families. Whether my explanation of the reason is the right one, or not, the fact is indubitable, that the family clusters are arranged in the order I have stated.\n\nI have conceived that this very methodical arrangement was intentional, and for liturgical purposes of an eclectic character. It is certainly remarkable that hymns of the\n\n---\n\n1 The hymns are said to have been 'seen' by Kutsa, of the race of Angiras, or the son of Angiras; but the relationship of these remote progenitors is decidedly problematical. Kutsa may have been an old, or specially influential, member of the Bh\u00e2radv\u00e2ja family, and may have been accounted a Devarshi in consequence; or, being already accounted a Devarshi, hymns ascribed to him may have been selected to represent the Bh\u00e2radv\u00e2ja family. It is remarkable that Y\u00e2ska, in his Nirukta, quotes Kautsa as a heterodox disbeliever.\nSeven \u1e5ashis should be found arranged in this peculiar manner; and it is difficult to imagine that this could have occurred through mere accident, or that it could have been purposely done except for a liturgical object.\n\nA startling confirmation of the truth of my suggestion is found in the fact that the \u0100di Granth of the Sikhs is arranged on precisely the same system; and this was done, undoubtedly, for liturgical purposes. The \u0100di Granth, as I showed in my paper last July, consists of three parts; the first contains the sacred texts used in daily prayer, and this is certainly of a liturgical character; the second contains the various R\u0101gs, the equivalents of the Mandalas II.-VII.; and the third part consists of a supplement, not unlike the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Mandalas. In this case, no doubt whatever exists as to the principle of arrangement, and it is, therefore, not unreasonable to conclude that similar causes produced similar effects in the case of the Rig-veda. I must confess that the more I study the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, the more clearly does its liturgical character appear, and to abandon my hypothesis in favour of the explanation proposed by M. Bergaigne seems to me like quitting a Copernican to return to a Ptolemaic system. The orderly arrangement of this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala will be further explained in the next paragraphs.\n\n4. The foregoing facts make it clear to my mind that the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is a collection of hymns intended to represent the families or Gotras of the Seven \u1e5ashis, the grand originators of the Brahmanic faith, and to unite in a single ceremonial observance the entire body of the orthodox. The next point to ascertain is, whether this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is really ritualistic in character. I have spoken of the difficulties and complications into which M. Bergaigne is driven by his rejection of my suggestion that the hymns are clustered round a centre represented by the hymn of Ka\u015byapa. Let any one compare M. Bergaigne\u2019s attempt with my simple exposition, and ask himself which is the more venturesome. I simply lay down the facts as we find them, which arrange themselves in the following manner:\n5. Vai\u015bv\u0101mitra hymns\n4. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns\n3. V\u0101sish\u1e6dha hymns\n2. Gautama hymns\n1. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns (Kutsa)\n\nHymns 1\u201398.\n\n0. Ka\u015byapa and the Five Rishis.\n   1. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns (Kutsa)\n   2. Gautama hymns\n   3. Bh\u0101rgava hymns\n   4. Gautama hymns\n   5. Agastya hymns\n\nHymns 99, 100.\n\nHymns 101\u2013191.\n\nHere we have a perfectly regular system, without the least tampering with the text. In the centre we have Ka\u015byapa\u2019s Soma hymn, outside which the rest is arranged in sets of hymns balancing each other; the intention to place Ka\u015byapa\u2019s hymn in the centre being markedly shown by Kutsa\u2019s hymns to Agni being separated from his hymns to Indra for this purpose.\u00b9\n\nThe subject-matter of the various hymns lends further support to this theory of arrangement. Towards the commencement of the Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala are hymns speaking of the efficacy of ritual observances, and these are followed by the remarkable hymns describing the process of manufacturing Soma. The fully prepared juice is then lauded in the 91st hymn; and then come supplications for the forgiveness of sins; followed by a hymn which speaks of generating fire from wood. Then comes Ka\u015byapa\u2019s verse, \u201cWe offer libations,\u201d followed by prayers asking freedom from sin; and these are succeeded by historical instances recounting the efficacy of sacrificial observances. These indications of methodical arrangement of matter require further investigation; but, so far as they go, they tend still further to show that the prevailing idea in this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala culminates in the hymn of Ka\u015byapa.\n\n\u00b9 In proof that the early Hind\u016bs were familiar with this system of placing ceremonial observances on each side of a medial act, I cite what the Satapatha-Brahmana says of this arrangement of the Purushamedha sacrifice: \u201cThereof the Agnishtoma is the first day: the next is the Ukthya; the next is the Atir\u0101tra; then comes the Ukthya; and next the Agnishtoma; thus it is enclosed on both sides by the Ukthya and the Agnishtoma.\u201d\nIt will be seen that, starting from Ka\u015byapa, the hymns of this Mandala fall naturally into five clusters on each side of it; and, therefore, the entire Mandala consists of eleven divisions. These divisions exhibit themselves on mere inspection, and do not call for the smallest interference with the preserved text. It is an incontestable fact that there are eleven divisions, five on each side of a medial one, whether any special significance attaches to that fact, or not. The mere coincidence of these eleven divisions in an assortment of hymns representing the families of the Seven Rishis, instantly calls to the mind of every student of ancient Brahmanism the old Purol\u0101\u015ba offering in eleven receptacles.\n\nWith respect to this number 11, the \u015aatapatha-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a tells us that, at the Purushamedha, \"for the initiation (there should be) eleven animals fit for Agni and Soma; for them there should be eleven sacrificial posts; eleven syllables are comprised in the Trishtubh metre. The Trishtubh is the thunderbolt\u2014it is vigour... In the rite of consecration there should be eleven victims... because the victims are elevenfold, therefore, verily, is all this creation elevenfold. Praj\u0101pati is elevenfold; all this is truly Praj\u0101pati; all this is the Purushamedha, which is the means for the attainment and subjugation of all this.\" This quotation is sufficient to show that an important sacrifice was really divided into eleven parts, and that a ritual might be expected to follow such an arrangement.\n\nOrderly arrangement is, furthermore, indicated by the fact that the hymns of Kutsa are divided into two portions; those addressed to Agni being placed before the 99th hymn, and those to Indra after it. If we consider the 99th hymn as the medial act of a ceremonial, we then find that the hymns placed in immediate contiguity to it, on each side, are those bearing the name of the great Devarshi representing the very family under whose influence we have excellent reason for believing that the entire Sanhita was arranged. Again, if we consider the verse of Ka\u015byapa as a dividing line, we find that the \u0100pri hymn of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas occurs on one side of that line, and the \u0100pri hymn of the Gautamas on the\nother side, thus conferring very special distinction on the Angiras family. Yet again, it cannot fail to attract attention that, on one side of Ka\u015byapa's hymn there are two sets of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns and one of Gautama, while, on the other side, quite systematically, there are two sets of Gautama hymns and one of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja. It would, indeed, be most remarkable if all this were the result of pure chance; more especially, when we remember that the hymns of Kutsa are quite peculiar in this fact of division, and that the effect is to place the praises of Agni and Indra on each side of a central hymn on the Soma, in conformity with the dictum that Agni and Indra share the Soma between them.\n\nPatient investigation will, no doubt, reveal further confirmatory details; in the meantime it is well to point out that the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala admits of division into eleven parts in another way, still without the least tampering with the text. This is effected by simply utilizing the fact that the hymns of Agasti are in three clusters, viz. those addressed to Indra and the Maruts (hymns 165-172); those celebrating Indra and the A\u015bwins (hymns 173-183); and those devoted to Agni and the Sun (hymns 184-191). Room is found for these new divisions by bringing together the hymns of each family, thus absorbing a cluster of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns on one side of Ka\u015byapa, and a cluster of Gautama hymns on the other side, in the following manner:\n\n1. Vai\u015bv\u0101mitra hymns (1-10).\n2. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns (11-64 and 95-98).\n3. V\u0101sish\u1e6dha hymns (65-73).\n4. Gautama hymns (74-94).\n5. Ka\u015byapa and the Five Rishis (99, 100).\n6. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns (101-115).\n7. Bh\u0101rgava hymns (128-140).\n8. Gautama hymns (116-127 and 141-164).\n\nHymns of Agasti.\n\n9. Indra and the Maruts (165-172).\n10. Indra and the A\u015bwins (173-183).\n11. Agni and the Sun (184-191).\nThis last method of classification satisfies the rule of the Aitareya-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, that the Purol\u0101\u015ba is offered in eleven receptacles, eight of which belong to Agni, and three to Vishnu. There is no difficulty with respect to the first eight divisions; they are all specially consecrated to Agni by beginning with that deity\u2019s hymns; for even the verse of Ka\u015byapa is addressed to Agni, although invoking a blessing on the libation of Soma. With respect to the hymns of Agasti, a careful inspection will show that there is nothing fanciful in this suggested division into three parts. They separate readily and naturally into clusters of 8, 11, and 8 hymns respectively. But a real objection to considering the hymns of Agasti as the portion of Vishnu lies in their subject-matter. There seems no reason why hymns to Indra, the Maruts, the A\u015bwins, Agni, and the Sun, should be held to represent Vishnu in particular. Of course, as the Vishnu of the Vedas is the deity of the fire on the hearth, while Agni is the ethereal or heavenly fire, the last portion may be held to celebrate the earthly or material fire, bearing the oblation from earth to heaven. It seems to me, however, far more probable that the entire ceremonial was completed in eleven acts, which were simply allotted in the proportions of 8 and 3 without particular reference to any part of the ritual. As a fact, furthermore, the material offering was divided into eleven portions in eleven platters, and the rule of division has, probably, reference solely to that fact, without involving a corresponding division of the hymns which accompanied the offering.\n\nIt is not a little remarkable, however, that the First Mandala admits of division into eleven parts in a manner which separates the whole Mandala into three well-defined clusters, with an Angiras \u0100pri hymn in the first and last; and Ka\u015byapa and its companion hymn occupy the centre of the middle cluster. This also is effected without the least interference with the text:\n1. Vai\u015bv\u0101mitra hymns.\n2. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns (with \u0100pri hymn of Kanwas).\n3. V\u0101sish\u1e6dha hymns.\n4. Gautama hymns.\n5. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns\n8. Gautama hymns.\n6. Ka\u015byapa\u2019s hymn.\n7. Hymn of Five \u1e5ashis.\n9. Bh\u0101rgava hymns.\n10. Gautama hymns (with \u0100pri hymn of \u0100ngirasas).\n11. Agastya hymns.\n\nHere, again, we find that by taking the hymns in the order of their occurrence, they fall into three clusters of threes, making nine sets of hymns, into the midst of which two special hymns are inserted, making altogether eleven divisions. It will, furthermore, be perceived that the middle set contains a selection of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns (the very family which arranged the Sanhita), on each side of which is a selection of Gautama hymns (representing the other branch of the same influential race). In the cluster which precedes, we find Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns in the middle, flanked by Vai\u015bv\u0101mitra and V\u0101sish\u1e6dha hymns (opposing family representatives); while the cluster which follows the medial set contains Gautama hymns as a nucleus, with Bh\u0101rgava and Agastya hymns as supporters.\n\nThese three clusters certainly present a systematic grouping, having \u0100ngirasas hymns as the nucleus of each; the medial cluster being entirely \u0100ngirasas in origin; while the two outer clusters are flanked by hymns from other families.\n\nI must also call attention to the fact that the \u0100pri hymn of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas falls near the middle of the first cluster; and the \u0100pri hymn of the Gautamas near the middle of the third cluster; while the remarkable hymns numbered 6 and 7 are exactly in the middle of the central cluster.\n\nThere are several hymns in the Mandala which intimate that a threefold division of the sacrifice was a familiar idea to the ancient Brahmans. The 34th hymn abounds in specifications of threes, particularly mentioning a \u201cthreefold act of\nworship\"; and the 47th hymn speaks of the \"thrice-heaped sacred grass.\" The expression \"thrice eleven divinities,\" which several times occurs, seems to connect the numbers 3 and 11 together.\n\nThe foregoing facts tend to prove still more plainly that the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is systematically arranged; for, in whatever way we test it, we find that it presents features of regularity. This can only be the case when objects recur in an orderly series. Under such circumstances, from whatever point the search may start, an orderly succession is detected. The initial fact of orderly arrangement having been ascertained, the discussion can be narrowed to the discovery of the correct starting-point.\n\nThe arrangement which I think the true one is that set forth in my first paper, in 1884, where I place five sacrificial acts on each side of a middle point. The dogmatic allotment of eight of those parts to Agni, and three to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, on account of the G\u0101yatr\u012b metre and the three mythological steps, seems to belong to an epoch when the primitive ideas had become clouded with misapprehension.\u00b9\n\nThere is one argument against the ritualistic character of the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala which demands consideration, and that is the fact that it contains three \u0100pri hymns. We know that each family was particular in the use of these hymns, and each claimed the right to introduce its own \u0100pri hymn at the sacrifices. If the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is a general ritual, how is it that it contains, not seven \u0100pri hymns, one for each family, nor one \u0100pri hymn of the dominant party, but three \u0100pri hymns? As regards two of them we need feel no surprise; for they are the \u0100pri hymns of the two branches of the Angiras family; one of them being placed before, and the other after, the medial point marked by the hymn of Ka\u015byapa. The predominant influence of the \u0100ngirasa\u015b renders this quite intelligible. Nothing can be more natural than the desire to include both these representative hymns;\n\n\u00b9 The legend that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u stepped three times is found in the 22nd hymn of this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala; but the steps were taken \"to uphold righteous acts,\" and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was aided in the performance \"by the seven metres,\" without allusion to the eight G\u0101yatr\u012b feet.\none to be rehearsed towards the beginning, the other towards the end, of the ceremony.\n\nBut these two hymns exhibit a striking peculiarity. They consist of twelve and thirteen verses, respectively, whereas all the other \u0100pri hymns in the Rig-veda contain only eleven verses each. The ordinary \u0100pri hymns invoke the Sun under either the name Tan\u016bnap\u0101t or Nar\u0101\u015bansa; these two hymns alone invoke the Sun under both those names, and this occasions their extra length. Here we have another plain proof, not only of orderly arrangement, but of designed eclecticism or selective combination. These two hymns were intended to express both forms of adoration; the verse invoking Tan\u016bnap\u0101t gratifying the Agastyas, the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras, the K\u0101\u015byapas, and the Jamadagnyas; while that invoking Nar\u0101\u015bansa must have been pleasing to the Bh\u0101rgavas, the \u0100treyas, the V\u0101sishthas, and the B\u0101dhry\u0101vas. This fact of double invocation, in the case of two \u0100pri hymns, just where (on the ritual theory) we should expect such a phenomenon to appear, is too remarkable to be set aside as a mere accident.\n\nWith respect to the third \u0100pri hymn, it is sufficient to remark that it is found among the hymns of Agasti at the end of the First Mandala. This small batch of hymns contains all the hymns of the Rishi Agasti; and, if his \u0100pri hymn were not placed among them, it would have no place of rest in the canon, according to my theory of the arrangement of the Rig-veda. This of itself is sufficient reason for its present position. There is only one other hymn of the Agastya race in the Rig-veda, and that is one addressed to Soma in the Ninth Mandala; accordingly, if the \u0100pri hymn of this family were rejected from the First Mandala, it would have to form a Mandala by itself. Furthermore, as the First Mandala contains all the hymns of each Rishi whose hymns are included in it, there would be no valid reason for rejecting this hymn, which is ascribed to Agasti himself.\n\nIt is, at the same time, worth remarking that, according to the suggested division of this Mandala into eight and three parts, respectively, the \u0100pri hymn of the Agastyas would fall\nin the latter part, hypothetically devoted to Vish\u1e47u. This would give eight parts and two \u0100pri hymns to Agni; and three parts and one \u0100pri hymn to Vish\u1e47u. Another fact, of which more will be said presently, is that there are twice as many verses of the Agastyas in this Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, as there are verses of the other Rishis, with the exception of the \u0100ngirasas. This fact indicates, possibly, a partiality, which might also have been extended to the admission of the \u0100pri hymn of that family. On this point further investigation is needed. But surely there are sufficient facts in support of my hypothesis, to warrant the serious consideration of my views on this point.\n\nThe interesting question here not unnaturally suggests itself, why the head of each family should not have been selected as its most fitting representative. Why, for instance, should Madhucchhandas be chosen to represent the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras, instead of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra himself? In this particular case we have the legend that Madhucchhandas was the eldest of the sons of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, who consented to recognize the leadership of \u015aunah\u015bepha, after his adoption by their father. He received a special blessing in consequence of this dutiful conduct; and the prominent position assigned to his hymns as the first in the Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is in conformity with the indications of the legend. Close upon the heels of the hymns of Madhucchhandas come those of \u015aunah\u015bepha himself, the first two of whose hymns are those which specially celebrate the circumstances which made him the link between the \u0100ngirasas and the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras. This, of course, emphasizes the distinction conferred upon Madhucchhandas, by implying that the story of \u015aunah\u015bepha was in the mind of the Arranger, when he placed these hymns near each other.\n\nIt is not improbable that other circumstances, which at this distance of time do not readily catch attention, may have led, in a similar way, to the selection of the other Rishis as the representatives of their respective families. It is even possible that the term \u015aatarchin, applied to these Rishis, may indicate that, of all members of their families, their hymns approach nearest to a total of 100 riches. This is, in reality,\nthe case. The founders of the families far exceed that number of verses, and other members of the various families fall far short of that number. Those selected will, upon examination, be found to be the Rishis whose total riches approach nearest to 100 of any member of their respective families.\n\nBut there is another very remarkable fact connected with this name \u0160atarchin, which appears to indicate the true meaning of the term. If the stanzas of the First Mandala be added together, the total number is 1973; and, as this number is ascribed to nineteen Rishis, by dividing the total among them, we get 103 for each, with 16 for a remainder. Thus, by dividing the total of riches among the total of Rishis, we find rather less than 104 for each of them. This is sufficiently good ground for ancient writers to speak of the Rishis of the First Mandala as \u0160atarchin, or \"possessors of 100 riches.\" Should this indeed prove to be the reason for calling these Rishis \u0160atarchin, it at once proves also that the hymns of Agasti form an integral portion of the First Mandala. On totally different grounds I have already shown that they are a necessary part of the First Mandala; but the name \u0160atarchin, in the sense here pointed out, would effectually dispose of M. Bergaigne's suggestion that Agasti's hymns should be severed from the rest, and treated as a separate Mandala, in accidental union with a heterogeneous collection of poems.\n\nAnother very singular fact is revealed, by estimating the totals of the riches in the First Mandala. We find that the\n\n---\n\n1 It may be only a coincidence, but still it deserves notice that the number of stanzas which M. Bergaigne proposes to reject from the First Mandala as interpolations, amount to 177; but as he hesitates about rejecting the tenth stanza of Hymn 45, we may reduce this number to 176. He would, however, reject the whole of hymns 162-164, which specially relate to the Horse-sacrifice; and he would also omit the last hymn (191), addressed to the Sun. These are just the hymns which I consider specially significant of the true character of the Mandala. However this may be, they comprise 103 stanzas, which, deducted from his total rejections 176, leave 73 as remainder, exactly the number which 1973 is in excess of 1900 stanzas, which would allow 100 riches to each of the 19 Rishis. It would thus appear that M. Bergaigne's investigations tend to strengthen my conclusions generally. The above certainly shows that if hymns 162, 163, 164, and 191 be considered integral parts of the First Mandala, and the remaining 73 stanzas be rejected which M. Bergaigne holds to be interpolations, we get exactly the 1900 riches needed to provide the Rishis with 100 each.\nquantities contributed by the different families bear relative proportions the one to the other; and the proportions which they bear to each other are exactly those which my previous arguments would have led the student to expect. The totals of the riches are as follows:\n\n| Family          | Riches |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| K\u0101\u015byapas        | 1      |\n| The Five Rishis | 19     |\n| V\u0101sish\u1e6dhas      | 91     |\n| Bh\u0101rgavas       | 100    |\n| Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras    | 110    |\n| Agastyas        | 229    |\n| Gautamas        | 594    |\n| Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas     | 829    |\n\nTotal ... ... ... 1973 riches.\n\nHere we find that the apostle of the Soma is represented by unity; the V\u0101sish\u1e6dhas (the orthodox antagonists of the \u0100ngirasas and their friends) are in a minority; the Bh\u0101rgavas and Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras (friends of the \u0100ngirasas) have more space accorded to them; while double their number of riches is allowed to Agasti, who sings of Agni and Indra exclusively (a champion of the Solar cult); but four times the space is given to the Gautamas, and eight times the space to the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas. It must not be forgotten that Kutsa\u2019s hymns are placed on both sides of the middle of the Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, and that he was a Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja. This fact, and the enormous preponderance of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja verses in the Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala seem conclusively to prove that the Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, and probably the entire Rig-Veda, as we possess it, were arranged by the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja branch of the \u0100ngirasas, and that Kutsa\u2019s hymns are, in reality, placed in the post of honour, on each side of the 99\u2013100th hymn, which indicates when the libation of Soma was poured out.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 I am, of course, aware that the particular \u015a\u0101kh\u0101 preserved to us is that of the \u015a\u0101kalas, and this appears to have been the \u015a\u0101kh\u0101 followed by \u015aaunaka, of the \u015aunaka-gotra, of the Bhr\u012bgu race. But this does not imply that the text we possess is the Bh\u0101rgava version, and therefore unsuitable as a foundation for\nIt is now necessary to examine this middle point a little more closely, in order to show that, like every other feature of this Mandala, it lends its quota of proof to the hypothesis that the First Mandala is a devotional ritual.\n\nIn the first place, as I pointed out three years ago, the libation of Soma was unquestionably the most solemn moment of the sacrifice; and in the orderly arrangement of the hymns of the First Mandala we find that the medial hymn consists of a single verse, plainly asking the blessing of Agni on the Libation then being offered. This remarkable hymn is ascribed to Ka\u015byapa, the pre-eminent Rishi of the Soma, and therefore the most appropriate Rishi to memorize when the Soma was being offered. All the hymns of the K\u0101\u015byapas, but two, are invocations of Soma. The two exceptions are this very hymn to Agni and one to Indra in the Eighth Mandala. This single-versed hymn is addressed to Agni as J\u0101tavedas \"the knower or possessor of all creatures\"; and this very epithet, by which Agni is here invoked in the act of offering the libation, is an additional testimony to the eclectic character of the whole Mandala. It implies that the offering was made for all creatures, and was, therefore, accompanied by hymns from the Rishis of all sections of Brahmanism. \"Let us offer libations of Soma to J\u0101tavedas,\" is the prayer; that is, let us worship the one who knows all clans, before whom there is no difference of family or race, he who is the owner and knower of all creatures. It is in some such form as this that we should expect the libation to be made, if it were indeed offered in the name of an entire community; and the fact that these remarkable words occur as the very middle of the Mandala strengthens the conviction that they indicate the middle arguments relating specially to the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas; for the Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya of this \u015a\u0101kh\u0101 claims to follow the Sanhita of the \u015a\u0101sir\u012bya-s\u0101kh\u0101. Now \u015ai\u015bira and Mudgala, both founders of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja Gotras, are cited as two of the five students of the \u015a\u0101kala School who propagated varying recensions of the Rigveda; hence I infer that the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas were intimately associated with the \u015a\u0101kal\u0101s. \u015aaunaka, also, though reckoned an adherent to the \u015a\u0101kala School, yet openly differed from the \u015a\u0101kalas on various points.\nceremony of the sacrifice,\u2014the pouring out of the libation,\u2014and also that the office is arranged on eclectic principles.\n\nI have held that the words of Ka\u015byapa were used at what I believe to be the moment of offering the Soma; because he is the peculiar Rishi of the Soma, because of the nature of the words themselves, and because of their medial position. We have not only the evidence of our senses, that nearly all the Soma hymns handed down to us are by members of the K\u0101\u015byapa family; but we have also the express declaration of the Aitareya-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, that the K\u0101\u015byapas conquered the Soma-juice for the benefit of creatures. This is good evidence to show that almost in Vedic times it was acknowledged that the K\u0101\u015byapas were the representatives of Soma worship.\n\nThere is, however, another and equally cogent reason for placing Ka\u015byapa in the middle as the leader in sacrifice. Ka\u015byapa was recognized as the first human teacher who received sacred knowledge from the gods themselves. We find, by the lists of revered teachers preserved in the Van\u015ba-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and the \u015aatapatha-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, that traditional knowledge passed through a long line of teachers, who received divine truth one from another, until, in the remote past, the list ends in Ka\u015byapa, who received the secrets directly from Agni himself. These instructive lists of teachers afford something like historical evidence that the early Brahmans held that their system of belief had its origin from Ka\u015byapa; at any rate, he was certainly regarded as the Father of the Faithful. This high antiquity and venerable position, as the ultimate link in the chain of union between heaven and earth, renders Ka\u015byapa the most suitable of all the Rishis to be the leader in the greatest sacrificial ceremonial. The extravagant veneration felt for Ka\u015byapa is reflected through all stages of Sanskrit literature, and finds its expression in the legends of the Vish\u1e47u-Pur\u0101\u1e47a, in which Ka\u015byapa is fabled to have been the husband of Diti, the parent of the Maruts, the progenitor of the \u0100dityas, if not the very Creator of the Universe. It is this name, written thus deeply in the Brahmanical system, that we find placed in the very middle of the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, as the point around\nwhich all the rest is clustered. It is such a personage as this that we should expect to find in such a position; and the fact that we do find this honoured name there affords the most conclusive proof that my theory as to the arrangement of this book is the true one.\n\nIn immediate connection with this single verse of Ka\u015byapa on the Soma libation, comes the very remarkable hymn of the Five Rishis. In my former paper I said but little of this hymn, because I was then laying down the broad principles of a subject entirely new. My object then was to show the general system of the arrangement of the entire Rig-Veda; and, in the course of doing so, I merely indicated some of the conclusions to which my principles would probably lead. But, now that I am dealing particularly with the First Mandala, and calling attention to the numerous facts which concur to prove its ritualistic character, it becomes needful to examine more fully this peculiar hymn.\n\nThe first thing that arrests attention, in contemplating this hymn, is its composite authorship\u2014it is the only hymn of the First Mandala with more than a single Rishi. This hymn is supposed to have had five Rishis; of whom, however, almost nothing is known. It happens that the name of one of these Rishis is given as Ambarisha, who is said to have been the king of Ayodhya who purchased \u015aunahsepha for the purpose of sacrifice.\u00b9 If this identification be correct, it affords some clue to the distinction conferred upon it; for there can be no doubt that the incident of \u015aunahsepha, and the bond of union created between the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras and the \u0100ngirasas, had a marked influence on early Brahmanism. The fourth verse of this hymn specially praises Indra as \u201cthe most \u0100ngiras of the \u0100ngirasas.\u201d This, of course, may mean, as S\u0101ya\u1e47a suggests, \u201cthe swiftest of the swift\u201d; still\n\n\u00b9 It deserves remark, however, that Ambarisha is, also, the name of one of the ancestors invoked by the Kautsa-gotra of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja race. Was this ancestor and the king of Ayodhya the same person? The lists of Gotras and Ancestors preserved to us date however from only the S\u016btra period of Sanskrit literature; and we know that, long before that time, the meaning of many Vedic words and expressions had become matter of speculation, and the subjects of improbable fables.\nthe use of the word *angiras* in this way may have had its influence in placing the hymn in the prominent position in which we find it. But it seems perfectly clear that a stronger reason lay in the fact that it celebrates Indra and the Maruts in an especial manner. We know positively that Agni along with Indra and the Maruts share the Soma between them; and here, just where other reasons have led us to conclude that the Soma was offered, we find the remarkable verse of libation offered to Agni, immediately followed by this peculiar hymn celebrating Indra and the Maruts.\n\nThe hymn consists of nineteen stanzas, the first fifteen of which end with the refrain, \"May Indra, with the Maruts, be our protection.\" It might almost be inferred that the statement of the 72nd hymn of this Mandala must have special reference to this particular composition. Thus it is seen that both the middle position and the nature of these two hymns answer precisely the conditions requisite to give them the characters I assign to them.\n\nBut this is not all. It will be seen that this hymn of the Five Rishis changes its character after the 15th stanza. Up to that point each stanza ends with the same refrain, but the refrain disappears from the last four stanzas. This peculiarity of fifteen stanzas leads to the reflection that something turns on the number 5. The number 15 may consist of five threes, or of three fives; and it will instantly recur to the mind that this Mandala is divided, by the families of its Rishis, into two sets of five, with the two hymns now under discussion as a point of separation. This implies that some special significance may have been associated with the number 5. The 12th stanza of this hymn of the Five Rishis seems to direct our minds to an exact understanding, by lauding the Soma on the ground that it \"inspires the five classes of beings.\" These five classes of beings have been held by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to mean the four castes and the Nish\u0101das;\u00b9 in other words, they\n\n\u00b9 It is clear from other hymns of this Mandala that by this term is meant all the dwellers on earth; thus the 7th hymn says that \"Indra rules over the five classes of the dwellers on earth;\" and the 89th hymn, wishing to express the universality of Aditi, says, \"Aditi is all the gods; Aditi is the five classes of\nrepresent the community at large, and this precisely tallies with my discovery that the entire Mandala is of a corporative character. It was intended to unite in one common act of worship all sections of the community; and the \"five classes of beings\" were typified by five ceremonial acts before the libation, and by five similar acts after it; while at the most solemn moment of the sacrifice they were specially mentioned in a hymn consisting of three parts of five stanzas each, or of five parts of three stanzas each, and a Supplementary group of four verses.\n\nOn directing attention to this Supplement, it will be seen that the tone of the hymn changes. In the former part, Indra is celebrated as the bestower of rain, the god of the thunder-clouds, the fertilizer and sustainer,\u2014he is, in short, hymned as the farmer's friend. In the Supplement, though still styled \"the showerer,\" he is celebrated as the god of war; and his aid is sought in the subjugation of very human foes. This is one of the hymns which contain unmistakeable allusion to the conquest of the aborigines by the fair-complexioned Aryans. I do not wish to assert that this Supplement is an addition to a previously existing poem; for I am well aware that sudden changes of style and subject are common enough in the Rig-veda; still, it deserves notice that, in the present case, this change of style takes place just after we pass the sets of five verses, and the special refrain of the hymn.\n\nThere can, however, be no objection to the idea of a designed introduction of the warlike character of Indra into the ceremonial; on the contrary, it makes the principal act of worship more complete. Accepting these four stanzas as part of the original arrangement, we should have, in the middle of the ritual\u2014(1) the praises of Agni (fire, warmth,\n\nmen;\" and the 117th hymn says that Atri was \"venerated by the five classes of men;\" meaning that all mankind honoured him.\n\nIt deserves remark that the \u015a\u0101ntipatha-Brahmana expressly tells us that the sacrifice is fivefold. The words are: \"The Purushamedha occupies five days, and is the greatest rite of sacrifice. The sacrifice is fivefold, and fivefold are the sacrificial animals; five are the seasons included in the year. Whatever is fivefold in celestial matters may be obtained through this.\"\nand comfort), who is also asked, in his military capacity, to \"consume the wealth of those who feel enmity against\" the Aryans; (2) the libation of Soma; (3) the praises of Indra and the Maruts for both agricultural and military success.\n\nThe supplemental character of the last four stanzas of the hymn of the Five Rishis deserves remark more from its interference with any idea that might be based on the significance of the numeral 5. There is, however, a further point to remark, which is, that the names of the so-called Five Rishis do not occur in the first fifteen stanzas. They are found in the seventeenth verse, as part of what I call the Supplement. I am not disposed to consider these stanzas as a later addition, on that account; much less, to deem them spurious. I would rather seek to discover their meaning. These five names are asserted to be those of R\u00e2jarshis, possibly because the name of one of them agrees with that of a King of Oudh; for little else is known of them. This interpretation appears to rest on the word V\u00e2rsh\u00e2gir, which, with grammatical correctness, has been held by commentators to mean \"descendants of Vrishagir.\" It has never occurred to any inquirer to suggest that these words are not necessarily patronymics at all. In the note to my former paper I pointed out that V\u00e2rsh\u00e2gir would mean, equally well, \"descendants of the adorers of the sprinkler,\" and that this would very fitly designate those who praised Indra as \"the showerer,\" or rain-god, in the manner of this very poem. If we extend this process to the other names, we shall see that they also are significative in a very unexpected way. The word Rijra\u015bva means \"the horse of the leader,\" or the horse of sacrifice; Ambarisha is a cooking utensil for frying or broiling; Sahadeva is \"the bearer,\" or \"carrying deity,\" a common term for the sacrificial fire; Bhayam\u00e2na is the decoction or preparation of \"fear,\" or \"anxiety,\" not an inappropriate name for the Soma itself; while Sur\u00e2dhas is plainly \"the receptacle of the Soma.\" These translations enable us to see the reason for the introduction of the word rjra\u015bva into the 16th verse. That verse praises the long-limbed coursers of Indra, and asks that they may be made\nspecially beneficent to Rijra\u015bva. There seems to be no particular reason why one of the supposed Five Brothers should be specially selected for benediction; or why the horses of Indra should be likely to become his exemplars; but, if we see in this word a mention of the horse of sacrifice, then we have a fact of the greatest interest. When translated by the aid of my interpretations, verses 16 and 17 read as follows:\u2014\u201cThe long-limbed, decorated, and celestial, red and black Couriers, harnessed with satisfaction to the yoke of the chariot in which the Showerer of Benefits is conveyed, (are) for the benefit of the Sacrificial Horse, distinguished among the armies of mankind. O Indra, the Showerer, the Adorers of the Showerer, the Sacrificial Horse and his accompaniments,\u2014the Cooking Utensil, the Fire, the Soma, and the Soma-receptacle,\u2014address this propitiatory praise to thee.\u201d\n\nIt will be seen that Indra, throughout this hymn, is called \u201cthe Showerer,\u201d which confirms my interpretation of the name V\u00e1rsh\u00e1gir \u201cthe adorers of the showerer\u201d; and the compliment paid to Rijra\u015bva, as \u201cdistinguished among the armies of mankind,\u201d confirms the opinion that the word implies a troop-horse, \u201cthe horse of the leader,\u201d the finest charger selected for sacrifice. The interpretations given to these words indicate that the sacrifice for which the First Mandala was arranged was none other than the famous \u00c1\u015bvamedha. The arguments which lead to this conclusion are greatly fortified by the positive knowledge we possess that the 162nd and 163rd hymns of the First Mandala actually were rehearsed at the \u00c1\u015bvamedha. We also know that this was the most solemn sacrifice in which Brahmanism ever engaged, that it dated from remote antiquity, and was, from its supposed efficacy and the splendour of its ceremonial, the sacrifice most likely to call for a Vedic ritual.\n\nIt must not be lost sight of that, at the \u00c1\u015bvamedha sacrifice, there were twenty-one posts, the eleventh of which was called Agni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101, because standing nearest to the fire. This plainly informs us that there was one yupa or post near the fire, and that the others stretched away, ten on each side;\nthis gives two posts to each of the five ceremonial acts I have spoken of, still further confirming my theory. The Taitiriya-Brahmana tells us that \"ten times eighteen\" heads of animals were required for the \u00c1\u015bvamedha, which again brings two fives before us in connection with this sacrifice. It will also be noticed that \"ten times eighteen\" are 180. Now, there are 191 hymns in the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, that is, 180+11; from this it might be inferred that 180 hymns were each accompanied by the slaughter of an animal, and that eleven (again this figure 11) were repeated without sacrifice. Can it have been that one hymn out of each of the eleven sets into which I have shown that the Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is divided was a simple prayer, introduction, or doxology? At the \u00c1\u015bvamedha a human being was offered, and therefore the peculiarities of a Purushamedha attach to it, as noticed in a previous part of this paper.\u00b9\n\nThe conclusions to which my interpretations and arguments lead are so startling, that the premisses on which they are based will receive, and ought to receive, the keenest criticism; but they are far too numerous, and far too cogent, to be set aside with a contemptuous allusion. We find that the First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala has preserved to us the ritual of the famous Horse-sacrifice, which is admitted to have been the most solemn ceremonial of ancient Brahmanism. The Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala itself, by its repeated mention of Brahman, Adhv\u0101ryu, Hot\u1e5bi, and Pot\u1e5bi priests, shows that a complicated ceremonial existed before the formation of the Sanhita. It is such a ceremonial as that of the \u00c1\u015bvamedha, and only such a ceremonial as that, which could influence the arrangement of the Rig-veda; and it will require serious argument and solid facts to shake the weighty and numerous considerations which I have adduced in support of my discoveries that:\n\n1. The First Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala is an eclectic ritual.\n2. That it is orderly in its arrangement.\n3. That it expresses eleven acts of worship.\n4. That the eleven acts are placed five on each side of a medial one.\n\n\u00b9 See pp. 607 and 620 note.\n5. That the medial point is the hymn of Ka\u015byapa, together with the hymn of the Five Rishis.\n\n6. That the so-called Five Rishis are not historical personages, but are the names of the principal facts in the famous Horse-sacrifice.\n\n7. That the ritual of the First Mandala was intended to unite in one act of worship the \"five classes of beings,\" that is to say, all sections of the community.\n\n8. That there is good ground for believing that the Mandala is the ritual of the A\u015bvamedha.\n\nIn the course of arriving at these conclusions, I have never been driven to amend the text handed down to us. Throughout my elucidation I am able to accept the text as it stands; and, although I do not pretend to have explained all the details, or to have actually demonstrated in an incontestable manner every suggestion which I have advanced, yet I do maintain that I have brought together such an accumulation of evidence that it will require the strongest of testimony to shake the conclusions which I have sought to establish.\nART.

M. Menant, who tried in his grammar\u00b9 to give a list as complete as possible of all the signs of various styles and epochs, has unfortunately accepted many doubtful characters, and has not distinguished the really archaic from the ornamental style. F. Lenormant,\u00b2 who specially studied the Babylonian syllabaries now in the British Museum, has done much to elucidate many points, but his observations bear only on a few characters, and have for principal object to ascertain the values and meanings in order to help the decipherer in reading rightly the inscriptions. He made a great step no doubt in attributing exclusively certain values\n\n\u00b9 Manuel de la langue Assyrienne, Paris, 1880.\n\u00b2 Etude sur quelques parties des Syllabaires Cun\u00e9iformes, Paris, 1876. Les Syllabaires Cun\u00e9iformes, Paris, 1877, etc.\nof the characters to Akkadian and others to the Assyrian texts, but other works seem to have claimed his attention, and he did not follow up the subject.\n\nIn my previous paper, a few words only were said about the development of the Cuneiform syllabary, and nothing about its origin, because these two questions are too important to be treated incidentally. I now propose to take them, but will first follow the evolutions of the syllabary; for it is important that they be well understood before discussing the question of origin.\n\nThe development of the Cuneiform syllabary and the modifications and adaptations it underwent, may be considered under two aspects: what may be called the graphic and the phonetic aspects, that is, the material modifications brought to the writing and those brought to the phonetic values given to the characters.\n\nGraphic Development.\u2014The first stage of the writing was pictorial, objects being drawn not only to represent the objects themselves, as hand, foot, house, tree, but also abstract ideas and actions, as the forearm and fist for power, the mouth for speaking or language.\n\nThe writing being little by little abbreviated and decayed, the images meant became unrecognizable, as in Egyptian hieroglyphs, and also as illustrated by the letters of our alphabet: for instance, A is derived from the Egyptian emblem of divinity, the handlet, through the Phoenician aleph, and has preserved very little of the primitive image.\n\nThere are no Babylonian documents which take us back to this first stage, but its existence is not doubted, as in many cases the figure of the object represented is still visible in the linear or even cuneiform signs.\n\nThe material used for writing had naturally a great influence on the changes brought to the forms of the signs. At first probably papyrus, leaves, bark or other similar material was used, but at an early date the Babylonians\nadopted clay, so abundant and so easily obtained. The use of clay as writing material, combined with the use of a square wooden style,\\(^1\\) gave to all the lines a peculiar form, and originated the Cuneiform writing, each line having the form of a nail or wedge.\n\nAt about the same period stone was also used as a writing material; in that case, for some inscriptions at least, the scribe preserved to the signs a more primitive form; curved lines were rare, but in the Cuneiform style they are impossible. For this reason the linear inscriptions often give us forms nearer to the pictorial stage.\\(^2\\)\n\nOne of the most important modifications, brought on by the use of clay as writing material, is that which affected the grouping of the characters and the direction of the writing. As I have already noticed,\\(^3\\) the inscriptions were at first written in horizontal columns, each column was divided by small divisions running from right to left, and in each of these divisions the signs (three, four or more in number, but forming one word or one connected expression, as *powerful king*, *son of so and so*, etc.), were grouped rather irregularly, the first sign of the expression, however, being always placed at the right hand top corner; representing each sign by one cipher, the following diagram will give an idea of the grouping.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 |\n| 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 2 |\n\n| 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 6 | 5 | 3 |\n\netc.\n\n| 4 | 3 | 1 |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2 |\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Pinches has noticed that on the tablets the grain of the wood impressed by the style is often visible.\n\n\\(^2\\) In some cases the linear inscriptions seem to have been copied from a Cuneiform copy, and the linear character wrongly transcribed; the same has happened in Egyptian, where the scribe or carver had hieratic copies for the texts he had to engrave on the stone. In many cases he transcribed the wrong hieroglyphs.\n\n\\(^3\\) J.R.A.S. Vol. XVIII. p. 422.\nWhen clay was used to write on, and a square piece of wood as style, the scribe was necessarily brought to turn the tablet, and to place what used to be the right hand side at the top. As a consequence of this change, the columns ran from left to right, and the divisions in each column from top to bottom. The irregular grouping of the characters was still preserved, but then the first sign of each group appeared to be placed in the left hand top corner of each division, in consequence of the shifting of the tablet. The scribes preserved for a long time the ancient habit of dividing the tablet into small columns, so small in fact that many words could not have been written in one line if they had wished to do so; little by little they gave up this practice, and when the columns were more extended, the irregular grouping became impossible; they therefore adopted the plan of placing all the characters after one another from left to right; the division lines were preserved only to mark what we call paragraphs. In some Omen tablets, no doubt, by tradition and in a few and exceptional cases, these division lines are retained and used as in the old documents.\n\nIn writing afresh any old tablet, or in copying proper names, or quoting from ancient records, the scribes had naturally to restore to the words the phonetic sequence of the signs irregularly grouped in the original texts; this was easily done for all phonetically written expressions; but when the scribes came to compound ideograms or compound ideographic expressions, the elements of which had no relation to the pronunciation of the group, often, perhaps by ignorance or either because the position of these compound elements had no importance as long as they carried to the mind of the reader the expression meant, they copied these groups irregularly, one or two characters being by so doing transposed. For instance, as I have already noticed, the name of the town of Lagash, written by means of a com-\n\n1 This observation is due to the Rev. Mr. Tomkins (though I do not think it was ever printed), at one of the meetings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology.\n2 J.R.A.S. Vol. XVIII. p. 422.\npound ideogram, and the characters being unequally grouped according to the old arrangement, was\n\n\\[ \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EV} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EI} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{EI} \\quad \\text{EI} \\quad \\text{EV} \\quad \\text{EI} \\]\n\nThe scribes copied either \\( \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EV} \\quad \\text{EI} \\quad \\text{EI} \\) or \\( \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EI} \\quad \\text{EV} \\quad \\text{EI} \\), but read in either case Laga\u0161.\n\nAnother remnant of the old irregular arrangement of the old tablets is preserved in the relative position of the columns of the obverse and reverse of the modern tablets. In the obverse they follow regularly from left to right, but in the reverse from right to left, because, when the scribe arrived at the end of the last column of the obverse, he went on over the bottom edge and straight to the other side,\\(^1\\) so the second column of the reverse had to be placed to the left, and therefore run from right to left, as shown in the following diagram:\n\n| Obverse | Reverse |\n|---------|---------|\n| I.      | VIII.   |\n| II.     | VII.    |\n| III.    | VI.     |\n| IV.     | V.      |\n\nThe change of position of the tablet had a more important consequence for the characters; all the objects represented were by this change reversed on the side, or rather on the back, for, like in early Egyptian, they always faced the right, so the foot \\( \\text{I} \\), meaning \"to stand,\" was reversed to \\( \\text{I} \\), and the Cuneiform character became \\( \\text{I} \\).\n\n\\(^1\\) The position of the reverse is besides contrary to that of the obverse; a tablet is not turned over as the leaves of a book, but as our gold and silver coins.\nThe characters are all and always reversed in the same way, what was the right hand side became the top.\n\nThere are two facts to be always borne in mind when we examine these early forms of characters: it is that generally the part represents the whole of an object or being, and that all the objects or beings always in profile face the right; for instance, \"man\" is represented by the trunk and head with the ribs marked; it became placed on the back in lineary, in archaic Babylonian, in modern Babylonian. An animal, especially a \"dog,\" was represented by the head and neck, which became reversed, and in Cuneiform.\n\nThe characters as impressed on the clay by the wooden style were very peculiar and far from being clear; each wedge was formed by an indentation having a sharp edge on the left hand top side, but the other side was formed by an inclined plane. When several wedges were impressed near one another, they overlapped, so to say, each sharp edge cutting each sloping edge of the previous wedge.\n\nWhen the character is complicated, it makes its decipherment rather difficult.\n\nTo imitate these wedges the stone engravers adopted the conventional regular wedge of the lapidary inscriptions, and it is this style which has been adopted also as the standard by modern Assyriologists for their publications.\n\nAs it has been said above, the system of Cuneiform writing, that is, that made on clay by means of a square wooden style, seems to have been in practice before any of the inscriptions which have come down to us, for in some stone inscriptions the engraver has given a Cuneiform appearance to the lines, and even in the oldest dated inscription, that of Sargon of Agade, the characters are Cuneiform. The linear characters\n\n1 This is without exception. It is an erroneous supposition that any influence was exercised by the shape and size of the characters (vide J.R.A.S. Vol. XV. p. 279).\n2 Dr. Birch noticed it for the earliest Egyptian texts.\n3 This is very visible in photographs, but could only with difficulty be represented in a woodcut.\nare not besides a mark of antiquity, as the material used to inscribe on greatly influenced the scribes. When the stone was soft and the scribe careless, the characters were often linear and badly formed, as the careful engraving of each Cuneiform wedge required much time. We have of the same king linear and Cuneiform inscriptions. In some cases also inscriptions were written in linear characters to give them an archaic appearance.\n\nThe Cuneiform characters were primitively most elaborate; at first the scribe seems to have endeavoured to represent with the straight lines the object meant, but in course of time, through the natural desire to abbreviate and simplify, the characters were more and more decayed till the stage of the later Babylonian Empire, where the most complicated groups are reduced to a few wedges, as we have seen for the sign for \"man.\"\n\nIn some cases it happened that two groups quite different were brought by decay to one form, as the Ninevite \\( \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97} \\) and \\( \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97} \\), often confounded by the scribes; the first comes from the image of a garden \\( \\text{\ud808\udc97} \\), and the latter from that of a tower \\( \\text{\ud808\udc97} \\).\n\nG. Smith was of opinion that in other cases the Babylonian scribes had created a kind of graphic doublets to differentiate two phonetic values of the same polyphonic sign.\n\nThe number of wedges in each sign and their position varied according to the time and the locality. The study of palaeography became for this reason a special branch, for the difficulties were as great for the Babylonians as for ourselves. Lists of these variations were drawn up; one which has come down to us gives twenty different variants of the same character.\n\n1 Pinches, Proc. S.B.A., June, 1886. The author points out that the difference was kept up more clearly in the Babylonian style, in which \\( \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97} = \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97} \\) and \\( \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97} = \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97} \\); see also Zeitschr. f\u00fcr Keilschr. vol. ii. p. 158. For other examples, G. Smith, Phonetic Values, p. 4.\n\n2 Phonetic Values, London, 1871, p. 3.\n\n3 Pinches, Archaic Forms of Babylonian Characters, in Z. f. Keilschr. vol. ii. p. 149 et seq.\nIt is to be noticed that the difference between the Cuneiform signs at Babylon and Nineveh was great enough to make a transcription necessary. In the case of the very old Babylonian documents copied by order of the Assyrian kings, the Ninevite scribes, sometimes unable to transcribe a sign, merely copied it.\n\nThe archaic style, as our old English, was often used as ornamental; it was, for instance, always the one used on seals. One syllabary gives in the archaic style the signs to be explained, using it as a kind of italic.\n\nThe old form of characters used as an ornamental writing has been also employed by several kings, and the inscriptions which affect the oldest or rather the most elaborate style are after that of Antiochus. In one of his inscriptions Nebuchadnezzar has in the same way adopted an archaic style.\n\nIn the case of this ornamental archaic we must be very careful, for often the scribes have adopted signs which they believe or assume to be archaic, but really invented by them. For instance, in the inscription of Nebuchadnezzar the sign for sacrifice is written by this group , intended no doubt for the representation of a Zigarat, as represented on the monuments , but placed on the side, the scribe being under the impression that the sign was the representation of a temple.\\(^1\\) But the real archaic form was in linear before it was placed on the side , which represents a blazing altar with libation or the blood of the victim running down .\n\nThe explanations which the Babylonian scribes tried to give of the origin of the signs are all of the same misleading character, if we judge from those given in the fragment of a tablet now in the British Museum;\\(^2\\) for instance, the sign , which has the meaning of hand, arm, limb, wing, power, etc., is explained as being derived from three different\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This observation is due to Mr. Pinches.\n\n\\(^2\\) Published by the Rev. Mr. Houghton, in his paper S.B.A. Trans. vol. iv. part ii.\nobjects, the first looking as a quiver \ud808\udc97, the second, difficult to determine, may be a jug, and the third appears to be a throne, the scribe being no doubt uncertain, gave the three alternatives; but if we go back to the most archaic \ud808\udc97 and the linear form \ud808\udc97, we have clearly the representation of the fore-arm and fist \ud808\udc97, with an ornamental sleeve.\n\nIn the private documents the writing decayed more rapidly after the Persian conquest. The tablets of this period are very roughly written, but the decay attained its highest point under the Greek and Parthian kings. The documents of these periods are almost illegible, and require a special study.\n\nThe decay of the Cuneiform writing is well illustrated by the private documents: letters, contracts, receipts and the like. The alteration was slow and insensible, though uninterrupted; a simple but careful examination of the writing of a private document is sufficient in fact to fix its approximate date.\n\nThe oldest private documents, those of the time of Hammurabi, have the highest palaeographical interest.\\(^1\\) The characters of these documents seem to be the connecting links between the old complicated and the modern characters, all the wedges which were at a later date left out are faintly impressed, but those which remain are deeply marked, for instance, in the sign \ud808\udc97 na, the three inner lines are faint, and the others give the modern form \ud808\udc97.\n\n**Phonetic Development.**\u2014The modifications which the syllabary experienced, as to the values given to the characters, and the way in which those were combined, were less capricious, and resulted to a great extent from the phonetic peculiarities of the languages or dialects to be expressed. Considered under this aspect, the syllabary went through five different periods, during each of which modifications were brought\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) All the contract tablets of this period have been published in autography by Dr. Strassmaier in the Transactions of the Congress of Orientalists held at Berlin; his copies give a fair idea of the originals; when one knows how difficult these are to read, he cannot be surprised in finding some mistakes.\neither to the values of the characters, or to the way in which they were used.\n\nThe first period, which may be called the figurative stage, has left no documents, so it would be entirely speculative if the texts of later date did not contain figurative expressions. At this period of the syllabary, the signs were all taken as ideograms, the foot \\(\\text{\\small\\textsc{v}}\\), for instance, represented not only this part of the body, but was used also to express the idea of 'to stand,' 'to walk,' 'to journey,' etc.; the context only could give the value of the character used. This purely figurative stage has been preserved in the proper names and in some parts of the Omen tablets, as for instance in the name of Nabuchadnezzar:\n\n\\[\n\\text{\\small\\textsc{nabu-kudurru-usur}}\n\\]\n\nThe first two characters mean 'the god shining forth,' and express the planet Mercury in the morning, considered as the announcer or proclaimer of the day, in Babylonian \\textit{Nabu}; \\(\\text{\\small\\textsc{v}}\\) is 'thing,' \\(\\text{\\small\\textsc{v}}\\) is 'fixed' together, 'what is fixed,' i.e. 'boundaries,' in Babylonian \\textit{Kudurru}; the last character \\(\\text{\\small\\textsc{v}}\\) means 'to protect,' and is to be read as the imperative in Babylonian \\textit{usur}; the whole name is therefore to be read \\textit{Nabu-kudurru-usur}, 'Nebo! protect the boundaries.'\n\nIt is evident that such a pure figurative, or rather ideographic, system of writing could not be maintained for a long time, and the writers soon found the necessity of specifying by one way or another the value which they wished to attach to the signs.\\(^1\\) They did so exactly as the Egyptians and Japanese, by means of phonetic complements, just as we do ourselves when we add a syllable after the ciphers to express the ordinal numbers, 1st, 2nd, 4th, etc.\n\nThis is the second period of the syllabary, or the stage of phonetic complements.\n\nThe greatest number of the characters of the Babylonian syllabary had, as we have seen, several pronunciations and meanings, and each word ideographically represented had besides different forms according to its grammatical\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Also in Egyptian we have no example of purely figurative texts.\nrelation, to determinate the way in which the ideogram was to be read, the Babylonian repeated the final sound of the word. The sign had the values of 'god' \\( \\text{ilu} \\) and 'heaven' \\( \\text{\u0161ame} \\); when they wanted to write the latter, they placed after the ideogram another character having the phonetic value \\( e \\): \\( \\text{\u0161ame} \\). In the same way \\( \\text{V} \\), among its ideographic values, had that of 'to fix,' in Babylonian \\( \\text{\u0161ak\u0101nu} \\) in the infinitive; when the scribe wanted to express the third person of the aorist \\( \\text{i\u0161kun} \\), he wrote after the ideogram another character \\( \\text{un} \\), giving the phonetic ending \\( \\text{un} \\) of the verbal form, to be pronounced \\( \\text{i\u0161kun} \\).\n\nWe may here notice that the Babylonians never went, in the use of the phonetic complements, as far as the Egyptians, who not only expressed the final sound by a phonetic sign, but often placed before the ideogram another sign giving the initial sound.\\(^1\\)\n\nBesides the use of final phonetic complements, the Babylonians had another graphic contrivance in common with the Egyptians, that is, the use of determinatives; but it is, however, much more limited, as the determinatives are found prefixed regularly only to proper names of men and women, names of gods, cities, countries, stars, rivers and months, and may have been pronounced in many cases. The Babylonian differ from the Egyptian determinatives also as to position, they are always placed before and not after the words.\n\nIt is difficult to determine at which period the use of determinatives was resorted to, for it seems to have slowly grown with the desire for clearness. For instance, determinatives placed before proper names of men, \\( \\text{I} \\), and before those of women, \\( \\text{F} \\), appear only after the reign of Hammurabi. The use of determinatives may also have been the outcome of the adaptation of the Semitic syllabary by the Akkadians, though these determinatives were generally pronounced in Akkadian.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) At the later Babylonian period we find, however, in some cases what might be called a phonetic determinative prefix, but it is only to make certain the pronunciation of a syllable which is doubtful, as \\( \\text{e-i\u0161-tin} \\) for \\( \\text{e\u0161tin} \\) 'one,' and \\( \\text{u-ul} \\) for \\( \\text{u\u0161} \\) 'not.'\nThe third period begins with the Akkadian invasion of Mesopotamia. The Akkadians spoke, as far as we can judge, and as generally admitted by Assyriologists, a Turanian agglutinative language having nothing in common with the Semitic tongue of the Babylonians; after the more or less prolonged struggle required to subdue the Semites, they acquired peaceful possession of the country, and adopted the civilization of the conquered race. Their first care was no doubt to adopt the system of writing of the Semites; it was so much more easily done that the writing was still at the figurative or ideographic stage; they had therefore only to take the Babylonian signs and read them in their own language, as we did ourselves for the ciphers borrowed from the Arabs: \\( \\text{\u0161ak\u0101nu} \\) 'to place,' was read \\( \\text{gin} \\), \\( \\text{ilu} \\) 'god,' was read \\( \\text{dingir} \\).\n\nAs a consequence of the use of phonetic complements, the Babylonians had been obliged to employ their signs sometimes ideographically and sometimes phonetically; the Akkadians in adopting the system of writing were naturally brought to adopt the phonetic values of the signs when not used ideographically, and also to give to such signs the phonetic values obtained by the Akkadian readings. To remedy the obscurity resulting from such a polyphony, the Akkadians imagined to write inside or after the ideogram its pronunciation, a system which was also resorted to by the Egyptians,\\(^1\\) and we call these phonetic groups by the same name adopted by Egyptologists\u2014phonetic determinatives. The Akkadians, who borrowed the word for 'price' \\( \\text{\u0161imu} \\) from the Semites, written primitively by the sign \\( \\text{\u0161e-am} \\), wrote inside it, its pronunciation, or rather their pronunciation of it, \\( \\text{\u0161e-am} \\), and the sign became \\( \\text{\u0161e-am} \\).\n\nOften, however, the Akkadians were satisfied in writing inside or by the side of the sign its Akkadian phonetic complement, thus inside the sign for mouth \\( \\text{me} \\), used to express language, they wrote when so used \\( \\text{me} \\), phonetic complement of \\( \\text{eme} \\), in Babylonian \\( \\text{lis\u0101nu} \\).\n\n\\(^1\\) In Egyptian the phonetic determinatives follow the words.\nOne of the most curious peculiarities of the writing of this period is that a certain number of words are read backwards like \\( lu-gal \\) 'man great,' written in archaic characters clearly \\( gal-lu \\), and \\( apsu \\) written \\( su-ap \\). But this comes from the fact that the Akkadians, as I have shown in my previous paper, changed and partly reversed the ideological order of their language; these compound ideograms had been invented, perhaps, before the change, and then retained after by tradition.\n\nOn account of its agglutinative character, and the use of the phonetic determinatives, the Akkadians gave a great development to what may appear at first sight a system of determinative prefixes. The words are easily decomposed into their compounding elements; for instance, \\( gis-uru \\) 'a beam,' which passed in Babylonian with the same meaning, is evidently formed of \\( gis \\) 'wood' or 'tree,' and of \\( uru \\) 'strong.' The first of these two words enters into the composition of many others: \\( gis-sa-ra \\) 'the door post,' in Assyrian \\( giz-sir-ru \\); \\( gis-bar \\) 'the barra tree,' in Assyrian \\( gi\u0161-bar-ru \\).\n\nIn time the first formative element was either neglected in the pronunciation through phonetic decay, or considered as a determinative aphone, as in the following words, which passed into Assyrian at a time when the first element \\( gis \\) was not pronounced at all: \\( gis-si-gar \\) 'a wooden lock,' in Assyrian \\( \u0161i-gar \\); \\( \u0161a-k\u0101-na \\) 'a wooden bolt,' in Assyrian \\( \u0161akanaku \\); \\( apina \\) 'foundation,' in Assyrian \\( epinu \\), and many others.\n\nIn the same way \\( u \\) 'plant,' \\( ku \\) 'clothing,' \\( sa \\) 'stone,' etc., which formed the first element of many words, came to be considered as determinative prefixes.\n\nWhen the phonetic complement gave the pronunciation of the whole word, the ideogram was easily mistaken for a determinative prefix, or even considered as such by the Akkadians themselves, as was no doubt the case for the word for 'horse,' written by the sign for 'ass,' followed by the phonetic pronunciation \\( kurra \\). In the case of this particular word, we must remember that the horse was\nunknown to the Semites before the Akkadian invasion; when the new comers wished to express with the ideographic writing of the Semites the idea of their new animal, they naturally took the ideogram for the most important beast of burden of the Semites, the ass, but to distinguish it they wrote the whole name as a phonetic determinative.\n\nWhen trying to analyze Akkadian words, great care must be taken not to confound compound ideograms with compound words; the former are very abundant in the Akkadian texts, and Assyriologists in some cases have committed serious mistakes in taking ideographic for phonetic elements. The name of the camel might be given as an example. It is written \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), which has been explained as meaning 'the beast of the sea,' but it is rather 'the beast with water in a hollow,' no doubt an allusion to the peculiarity of this animal, which carries water in a special receptacle. If this compound ideogram, formed only to give a notion of the animal meant, was read phonetically, it would be \\( \\text{ansa-a-ab} \\), but it is to be read \\( \\text{gammalu} \\) in Assyrian.\n\nThe Akkadian phonology had a great influence on the values given to the characters, not only on account of the new words translating the ideograms or signs, but also through the peculiarity of the sounds of this language, which at first certainly did not correspond with the Semitic sounds. All the letters of the Babylonian language have been weakened. The simple aspirate \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) often disappears entirely, the \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) is no more an aspirated guttural, and its existence in Assyrian words is often difficult to detect, and is apparent only by its influence on the character of the vowel.\n\nThere is a phonetic peculiarity of Akkadian which had a greater influence still on the phonetic values of the Cuneiform characters. In Akkadian, as also in a few languages of the same stock, the consonants when at the end of a closed syllable become obscure, and the letters of the same order are confounded in a kind of intermediary sound; the consequence was that a character having as value a close syllable, as \\( \\text{bat} \\) or \\( \\text{mas} \\), was used to express also the sounds \\( \\text{bad} \\) and \\( \\text{ba\u0161} \\) or \\( \\text{ma\u0161} \\), \\( \\text{ma\u0161} \\) and \\( \\text{mas} \\).\nThe Akkadian consonants also have not the clearness of sound of the Semitic ones; the same signs are used often to express different syllables, \\(pu\\) or \\(bu\\), \\(sa\\) or \\(za\\), etc.\n\nThese peculiarities contributed not a little to throw confusion into the syllabary, but it had not the same importance for Akkadian as for Babylonian, because Akkadian at all periods was always written much more by means of ideograms than the Semitic language of the post-Akkadian period.\n\nThe fourth period is the one during which the Sumerians made use of the Cuneiform syllabary. The Sumerians, who took the power after the Akkadians, spoke a similar language, or rather a dialect of the same language. There are no grammatical, or at best very few, differences between Akkadian and Sumerian, but only phonetic variations, and, as Akkadian was written chiefly by means of ideograms, the Sumerians had only to read their ideograms with their own pronunciation. By doing so they naturally attributed new values to the characters, values given by the phonetic expressions in their own dialect. All the Cuneiform characters acquired, therefore, as new values all the phonetic variations of Sumerian:\n\n\\[ \\Psi \\text{ gar became mar.} \\]\n\\[ \\langle\\Xi\\rangle \\text{ kim ,, dim, etc.} \\]\n\nThe consequence was to double the number of values attached to each character, already polyphonic in many cases.\n\nThe confusion resulting from this polyphonism caused naturally a greater tendency towards phonetism, and in the Sumerian texts we find a greater number of words written phonetically. There was, however, a great difference still between the phonetism of this period and that of the pure Assyrian and later Babylonian empires. The phonetism of the Sumerian texts is as a rule but the development of the principle of phonetic determinatives; in many cases the words, though phonetically written, are preceded or followed by their ideograms.\n\nDuring this period, and perhaps also during the preceding one, another cause came to add still more to the polyphonism,\nthat is, the phonetic decay. In all unwritten languages, and also in those written by means of ideograms, the phonetic decay is very rapid, as in the symbols used to represent the words there is nothing to keep visible the real or conventional pronunciation; the frequent invasion of Kassites and their domination at various times may have contributed to accelerate the phonetic decay, especially as in Kassite there appears to have been a tendency to abridge all words by dropping a consonant placed between two vowels. At any rate, we see the phonetic decay at work in Akkadian and Sumerian, even at the literary period of these languages; if there was no other evidence than that taken from the syllabary, it would be conclusive; for instance, the sign had at first the value gur, it was weakened in gur or hur, then in mur (wur), and finally in ur; in the same way became \u012b\u0161; the sign , with the meaning of 'flower,' was to be read ku\u0161, and its phonetic value u came perhaps through the same process of decay by the loss of the initial and final consonants.\n\nThe fifth period of the syllabary, which began with the age of Sargon of Agade or some time before, was the result of the adoption, by the Semites of the renaissance, of all the values attributed to the characters in the previous ones, a kind of eclecticism, so to say.\n\nThe Semites, during the long rule of the Akkadian and Sumerian dynasties and their struggle with the Kassites, appear to have lost all clear remembrance of the first age of their independence, and to have accepted the notion that their masters the Akkadians had initiated them in every art and science; they looked at the Akkadian pronunciation of the ideograms as the primitive one. The age of literature was over; the Semitic writers seem to have exhausted their resources during the Akkadian and Sumerian periods, when the Patesi, encouraging fine arts, received at their courts poets and prosators of the two races. The Semitic renaissance was the age of grammarians and commentators.\n\nThe new school of scribes classified the signs of their complicated syllabary, giving to them names drawn from the\nAkkadian vocabulary, wrote lists of Akkadian words or expressions explained in the Semitic language, and also inter-lineary translations of the Akkadian and Sumerian literary productions.\n\nA careful survey of the syllabaries and word-lists, as they have come down to us, leaves no doubt as to the period in which they must have been written. The words, for instance, are classed not according to the Akkadian, but the Semitic root system, and in the lists of verbal forms the third person is always given first, as is customary among Semitic grammarians.\n\nThe Babylonian scribes classified also the Cuneiform characters according to a certain order,\\(^1\\) but, as in some lists certain groups are left out, it is difficult, before more documents are found, to determine according to which principle.\n\nThe Semites at any rate adopted the graphic system, with all the modifications and alterations brought on by their predecessors, not only the new phonetic values, but, as we have seen, the graphic variations and additions, and often took even with the ideogram its Akkadian or Sumerian phonetic complement: \u0161ar was written \\(\u0161a\u2083l\u2083g\u2083l\u2083la\\), the Akkadian word with its phonetic complement; in the same way \\(\u0161u\u2083r\u2083ra\\) stands for hubullu \u2018pledge,\u2019 just like in English No. (the French abbreviation of num\u00e9ro) has been taken to mean \u2018number.\u2019\n\nIn the historical inscriptions the scribes, having clearness as one of their objects, gave a greater development to phonetism, but in the trade documents, in which the writers wanted to economize space and time, ideograms are very common, and also ideograms with Akkadian phonetic complements, even down to the latest age of the Cuneiform writing.\n\nThis strange use of a foreign phonetic complement had no doubt for object to determine more precisely the Semitic word which was to be read, and the Akkadian word with its phonetic complement was really considered as a compound ideogram.\n\nThe use of the real phonetic complements was not resorted\n\n\\(^1\\) Dr. Peiser first pointed it out.\nto by the Semitic scribes as much as in the second period; though it has not disappeared entirely from the historical texts; it is rarer, and generally the phonetic complement is merely the ending of the word, and often only a vowel. *Sibe* 'seven,' is written \ud808\udda0\ud808\ude17, *amelutu* 'servant or slave,' kind of abstract formative of *amelu*, is written \ud808\udda0\ud808\ude7a\ud808\udd40, really a combination of the ideogram for *amelu* \ud808\udda0, with the termination *u-tu*.\n\nAn important fact must be mentioned, which appears, however, to have escaped the notice of the Assyriologists, that is, that the Semites of the historical period have taken the values of the signs much more from their Sumerian than from their Akkadian readings; for instance, the sign \ud808\udda0 has generally the Sumerian value *mi* attributed to it, and not the Akkadian value *gi*. In the same way \ud808\udda0 is more often to be read *dim* than *kim*, \ud808\udda0 *dib* than *dug*, etc.\n\nThe Semitic scribes made a curious use of the phonetic complements, which in that case might be called syllabic determinatives; when they had to use a polyphonic sign, like \ud808\udda0 or \ud808\udda0, and when there might have been a doubt as to the value meant, they added another sign giving the end of the syllable, \ud808\udda0 \ud808\udda0 was without doubt to be read *rab*, the second sign being *ab*. It shows that the first is to be read *rab* and not *gal*; in the same way we found for *\u0161al* \ud808\udda0, really written *\u0161al-al*.\n\nDuring the Greek and Parthian periods the same complicated system of writing was preserved, but there is a tendency to omit the determinative prefixes. Often these prefixes are neglected before the names of gods, stars, months and others. In the astronomical tablets the use of ideograms is so much a matter of course that a set of characters were chosen to indicate the signs of the Zodiac introduced by the Greeks.\n\n*Origin.*\u2014There is very little doubt of the pictorial origin of the Cuneiform characters; it was so natural, and indeed so evident, that the first Assyriologists did not fail to notice it at the very outset of their study, but no attempt was made to demonstrate it scientifically before the Rev. Mr. Houghton.\ntook up the subject.\\footnote{S.B.A. Trans., vol. vi. part ii.} This writer was certainly very happy in some of his identifications, but the progress of Assyriology has shown that he was also wrong in many, as in some cases he took compound ideograms for simple, and simple for compound.\n\nThere is also an important rule, which was unknown to the Rev. Mr. Houghton, and which must not be lost sight of when the characters are identified; it is that all the figures of men, animals, and objects are always represented in profile\\footnote{As far as the signs are explained. Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie has been wrongly informed, when he states that the figures face the reader (J.R.A.S. Vol. XV. p. 279).} and looking to the right, as in Egyptian; for instance, \\texttt{ka} 'the mouth,' ka in Akk. and pu in Bab., is the decayed form of \\texttt{pu}, which appears to be a representation of the opened mouth, with the upper lip covered with a moustache \\texttt{pu}. The signs for 'man' and 'dog' or animal in general are also, as we have seen in the early part of this paper, derived from pictures in profile.\n\nA great many signs still resist our analysis, but enough of them can be identified to leave no doubt on the principle which guided the inventors of the writing. It will not be out of place to give here a few examples:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{used ideographically for 'by the side of,' archaic form \\texttt{being the hand and fore-arm}}.\n    \\item \\texttt{ideogram for 'man,' especially 'servant,' archaic lineary form \\texttt{representing the legs of a man walking}}.\n    \\item \\texttt{ideogram for 'corn' or any other seed, archaic lineary form \\texttt{representing an ear of corn}}.\n    \\item \\texttt{ideogram for 'child,' archaic form \\texttt{, lineary form \\texttt{being the breasts with flowing milk}}}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\footnote{This last form is taken from the fragment of a very archaic inscription which was in the British Museum, but this stone was mislaid when Mr. Budge had the partition of his room raised, and it has not yet been found, in spite of the efforts of Mr. Pinches.}\n\n\\footnote{These identifications are due to Mr. Pinches.}\nideogram to express 'to multiply,' archaic lineary form , representing a fish throwing its eggs .\n\nideogram for 'hollow,' by extension of 'the abyss,' archaic lineary form , being the representation of a well or cistern as still constructed by the Arabs .\n\nideogram for 'to inundate,' lineary form , representing the open door of a canal lock.\n\nThese few examples prove that the principle was the same for the Egyptian and Babylonian picture-writing. But who were the inventors, when and where was it invented? That is what is difficult to decide.\n\nMany theories have been brought forward, but none has been as yet scientifically developed or supported by any proof and a scientific demonstration.\n\nThe opinion, accepted by all the Assyriologists till the publication of my last article, is that the system of writing from which we derived the Cuneiform characters was invented by the Akkadians, according to some before the invasion of Mesopotamia, according to others after their settlement there. One of the strongest arguments in favour of this theory of the Akkadian origin of the writing is the opinion of the Babylonians themselves: though they never said anything about this question, it is evident that, as they attributed to the Akkadians all the inventions in art and science, they must have considered writing as an Akkadian invention. But I have in my last paper shown in a satisfactory way, I think, that writing was known to the Semites previous to the Akkadian invasion. The Akkadian origin of the writing must be therefore dismissed.\n\nAnother theory, the Semitic origin of the Cuneiform writing, which the first Assyriologists were inclined to accept before the discovery of the existence of the Akkadians by Sir H. Rawlinson, was soon abandoned, and the tendency\n\n1 This opinion is the more general, it was that of the late F. Lenormant.\n2 In my last paper I spoke only of this opinion, because after the discovery of Akkadian all the Assyriologists, except myself, had accepted it.\nwas to consider the art of writing as of foreign origin; the indigenous and Semitic origin is advocated now only by those exclusive Semitic scholars, who will not admit that the Semites borrowed anything. There is, however, in support of the theory the fact that some of the characters must have been invented in Babylonia.\n\nMany reasons speak in favour of a foreign origin. The Semites never invented anything; in art and science, as literature, they always copied or imitated their neighbours, and the invention of a system of writing requires certain aptitudes which are wanting in the Semitic race. The Arabs, who, according to most writers, represent the Semites par excellence, lived till the third or fourth century without any system of writing.\n\nThe proximity of Egypt, the constant commercial intercourse of the Semites with this country, and the evident pictorial origin of the Cuneiform characters, seem to have suggested to Dr. Hincks the Egyptian origin of the Babylonian writing. Norris seems to have entertained the same opinion, but his great caution prevented him from writing anything about it. Dr. Hincks only compared two characters, \u1e2ba 'country,' in Egyptian \u1e2ba, and \u1e2ba, archaic \u1e2ba 'city,' in Eg. \u1e2ba;\u00b9 he had noticed no doubt the similarity of other characters, but was perhaps waiting to compare the two systems of writing, that more might be known about the Cuneiform syllabary.\n\nThis similitude of a few characters in the two systems of writing was explained by others in a different way. Mr. Hyde Clarke was the first one\u00b2 who brought forward the theory that both systems of writing\u2014and that also developed in China\u2014sprung from a more archaic system of writing, which was afterwards lost and must have been pictorial. This ingenious theory, supported by only a few philologic considerations, was not however scientifically demonstrated. The two points of Mr. Hyde Clarke's theory are: 1. The common origin of the Egyptian and Babylonian systems of\n\n\u00b9 In the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.\n\u00b2 See Journal of the Society of Arts, vol. xxviii. p. 791.\nwriting; and 2. The existence of a civilization, and the use of a system of writing, in Babylonia previous to the Akkadian and perhaps Semitic occupation. The second point seems to have been partly confirmed.\n\nProf. Terrien de Lacouperie, who took up Mr. Hyde Clarke's theory, has not brought forward any proof in support of his view, but gives to the inventors of the writing, from which the Egyptian and Babylonian systems sprang, the name of Kushites, though at the same time he supposes, on what ground he does not say, a still older system, about which he says nothing.\n\nIt is difficult to accept this Kushite origin of the Babylonian writing, even if it was not scientifically unsupported, when the very existence of the Kushites is doubtful, and when we do not know even what was this population. The oldest school considered the Kushites, that is, the children of Kush, as a race akin to the Hamites, and consequently related to the Egyptians. This was certainly the view of the ancient writers, who took the relation of the Bible as their chief authority. But the desire to find Ethiopians in Asia has caused a great confusion in the use of this name. Still the Kushites were considered as the ancestors of the Semites by most writers. M. Maspero, who as a rule gives on debated questions the opinion generally accepted, represents the Kushites as proto-Semites, and does not make of them a special race. Others go the opposite way, making of the Kushites quite a special race distinct from the Hamites and Semites. Some identify them with the Akkadians, and declare that the Akkadians were black. Some identify them\n\n---\n\n1 When I wrote my last article I had not seen the Professor's note in the J.R.A.S. Vol. XV. p. 279, but the fact is not material, as the assertions which it contains are unsupported by examples or illustrations. The promised article on the Kushite origin of the Cuneiform Syllabary has not yet appeared.\n\n2 If it had not been for the social position of Baron d'Eckstein, his dreams about the Kushites would never have been taken seriously.\n\n3 Maspero, Histoire ancienne, p. 145 et seq. Through a surprising oversight M. Maspero gives the physical characteristics of the Kushites, supposed to be taken from Pritchard, but the characteristics are given by Pritchard not for the Kushites, but for the Ethiopians of Egypt and Abyssinia in modern times. Physical History of Mankind, vol. ii. p. 44. Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie has reproduced this misstatement without correcting it.\nwith the Agau. The natural conclusion is that a theory, having as principal part the hypothetical existence of so uncertain a population, cannot be scientifically entertained.\n\nFor a comparison with Egyptian we have at least more solid ground to stand on. The hieroglyphs of an early period are known to us, and their pronunciation, if still doubtful for a few, is certain for the greatest number.\n\nAs has been said above, the likeness of some of the Babylonian signs with those of Egypt struck the very first Assyriologists, but the subject never was taken into serious and scientific consideration, and no comparative list drawn.\\(^1\\) The vague statement of the common origin or the derivation of the Babylonian from the Egyptian syllabary never was besides, except in the case of the two signs given by Dr. Hincks, supported by any illustration at all.\n\nThere is another most important consideration, which does not appear to have been taken into account by those who hazarded the statement; it is, that in two pictorial systems of writing, even independently elaborated, many symbols must be the same; for instance, a man, a dog, etc., would always be represented by the image of a man, a dog, etc., or by the most characteristic part of the animal; the idea of walking will always also be represented by the foot or leg. We may have two examples of this necessary likeness in the two signs quoted by Dr. Hincks: \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\), Eg. \\(\\text{\ud80c\udc00}\\), may be the representation of an undulated land, and in \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\), Eg. \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\), the representation of a town with its streets; therefore two different inventors may have come to adopt symbols not far dissimilar to represent the same notion, and what in these two cases supports this explanation is, that the phonetic readings of the signs are not the same in both syllabaries. The first, however, \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\), with the meaning \u2018mountain,\u2019 can be read in Assyrian \u0161adu, and in Egyptian we have the value set for \\(\\text{\ud80c\udc00}\\), from its meaning of \u2018country\u2019 \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\) set.\n\n\\(^1\\) A list was drawn by Dr. Hommel; it contained only ten characters, among which were the two given by Dr. Hincks and two very doubtful. A list drawn by Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie contained only ten or twelve characters, among which the two above noted and some others were apparently misread.\nThere are many difficulties which render any comparison of the two syllabaries unsatisfactory and awkward.\n\nI have myself, too hastily perhaps, accepted the probable connection between them; for, when I came to draw parallel lists of the signs of both, my belief was shaken a little, and, though my comparative table contained more than fifty characters, I felt that there were so many things which ought to be taken into account, that what might be considered as a connection may, if the utmost care be not taken, prove often only accidental.\n\nThe objects represented by the Cuneiform characters cannot always be identified with certainty, even when the lineary forms are known, as at that stage they have deviated already from the primitive drawings. We have not to contend with such a difficulty in the Egyptian syllabary, but for both there is a question of great importance which in many cases it is impossible for us to answer satisfactorily; that is, the question of symbolic relationship between the material objects and the abstract ideas. This depends upon many causes, especially on accepted notions, on figures of speech used in the language, and on the use made of the objects. For instance, a feather taken symbolically with us would mean 'to fly away,' but on the Western Coast of Africa it means 'to hear,' from the custom of the inhabitants of this part to use a feather to clean their ears. This one example is enough to show how little we may be able to understand the symbolism of other nations. And how different may have been the symbolical notions of people separated from us by hundreds of centuries, and living under a different climate with different wants!\n\nOn account of the symbolic meaning attached to characters we found that the phonetic value in many cases does not give the name of the object represented.\n\nIn Egyptian a small pot \\( \\sigma \\) has the value \\( nu \\), and we may look in vain in the Egyptian vocabulary for a word \\( nu \\), meaning 'pot,' but this same pot is used as a determinative to words meaning liquids, perfumes, oils; we may therefore\ninfer that the value is taken from *nu* 'sweet water,'\u00b9 an antiquated word, which has been preserved in the name of the Goddess Nut,\u00b2 the primordial water, or the abstract water, the vase being taken to give the idea of its contents.\n\nIn Babylonian we have a similar pot very likely in the sign \ud808\udc97, archaic form \ud808\udc97,\u00b3 from \ud808\udc97;\u2074 it has the phonetic value *ni*; but, as in the case of the Egyptian sign \ud80c\udc03, this value is not the name of the object represented. A bilingual list tells us that its ideographic meaning is *mustabaru* 'conductor.' We have here again a case of symbolic adaptation. Any one carrying an order or doing something for somebody else has been symbolically compared in the East to the vase or vessel containing a liquid, and it explains why this character has the ideographic values of 'conductor' or 'leader,' for the one who leads metaphorically carries his followers, and by extension 'man' in general.\n\nCan we, however, assimilate the two characters \ud80c\udc03 *nu* and \ud808\udc97 *ni*, because their phonetic value is nearly the same, and because they both represent a pot?\n\nThe Egyptian and Babylonian characters are most of them, we must not forget, polyphonic. This of course increases the possible accidental coincidence of sound. As seen above, \ud80c\udc03 and \ud808\udc97 have the phonetic values \u0161ad and set; but the former may be read *mat, nat, lat, kur,* etc., and take its value of \u0161ad from its ideographic meaning of 'mountain' \u0161adu; the Egyptian \ud808\udc97 on the other side may be read set only from its meaning of 'country.'\n\nOther causes come also to increase the number of values attached to the signs.\n\nIn Egyptian there is a double vocabulary. As far back as we can go in the Egyptian literature, we can detect clearly the existence of two sets of words, one which may be called Hamitic proper, and the other which is more or less Semitic. The latter are not a later introduction through foreign\n\n\u00b9 This word is not given in the Dictionary of Pierret; but see S.B.A. Trans. vol. viii. p. 218.\n\u00b2 There is also the masculine form, the god *Nu*.\n\u00b3 This identification is due to Mr. Pinches.\ninvasion, as they already exist in the earliest dynasties before the Asiatic eruptions in historic times. Separating these two vocabularies is often difficult, as they were already amalgamated when the first documents were written in Egypt. These Semitic or proto-Semitic words must be distinguished from the purely Semitic ones introduced at a later period, like \\( \\text{la\u0101u} \\), to be read la\u0101us 'head.'\n\nIn the Babylonian syllabary the alternative readings, as we have seen, are still more numerous, each sign having for values the Akkadian, Sumerian and Babylonian readings. And in both syllabaries there are also all the symbolical derivative meanings given to each primitive picture. In Babylonian we have, however, this advantage, of being able to assign with a certain degree of certainty the approximative period at which the values were given.\n\nWe ought not to be surprised to find in the Egyptian and Babylonian vocabularies a great many words having a close phonetic affinity, as the two languages sprung certainly from the same primitive stock, but the words which belong to the first period of separation of the two races, Hamitic and Semitic, must show the phonetic peculiarities of each branch of language; for instance, we have the Egyptian \\( \\text{seb} \\) 'star,' and the Semitic reduplicated form \\( \\text{kukkabu} \\), Ass. kab-kab, the Egyptian \\( s \\) being represented by \\( k \\) in the Semitic tongue.\n\nA fact which has been a cause of great surprise to me is that often, when I had succeeded in tracing a Babylonian sign to a pictorial symbol, I found, on comparing it to the similar Egyptian hieroglyph, that the Akkadian values and pronunciation answered more often to the Egyptian than the Semitic readings. This would tend to support the theory of Dr. Strassmaier, who supposes that a relationship exists between the Akkadian and Egyptian languages.\\(^1\\)\n\nMost of those who have tried to compare the syllabaries,\n\n\\(^1\\) In the album offered to Dr. Leemann of Leyden.\neither Babylonian, Egyptian or other, have neglected to take into account two important considerations, the change of the meanings of the words, and their phonetic alteration in the long period which elapsed between the invention of the syllabary and the time at which the words of the language known to us belong. The second consideration is especially important for the case which concerns us now.\n\nAs already stated, Egyptian and the Semitic tongues are derived from the same stock, and a regular phonetic change ought to be traced from one language to the other. This is not the place to enter into an elaborate comparison of the two vocabularies, but I may state now that from a slight comparison of them I have noticed the following most important changes:\n\nEg. $m = \\text{Semitic } p$, $n = r$ or $l$, $f = w$ or $m$, $r = l$, $\\chi = s$, $s = k$.  \n\nThese changes are not, however, constant and invariable. Some words, like the pronouns for instance, have escaped the law. We also notice in the Egyptian vocabulary a class of words which give exactly the Semitic forms, but are not of a later introduction, and appear on the monuments of the first dynasties. This might be explained by the supposition that, after the first separation, and after having experienced in their vocabulary the phonetic changes, a few of which we have noticed above, the Semites and the Egyptians came again in contact, and the latter borrowed largely from the vocabulary of the former.\n\nThe two hypotheses, (1) that the hieroglyphic writing was invented before the first separation of the Hamites and Semites, and (2) that after this separation the Egyptian language suffered greatly from phonetic decay, are supported by the curious fact that the phonetic values of the hieroglyphs are more often found to correspond to the Semitic words of the picture, the Semitic tongues having perhaps suffered less from phonetic decay.\n\nI will now give two or three examples of Babylonian\n\n---\n\n1 I cannot here give any examples, as it would extend this paper too much.\n2 This contact must have taken place before the historical period.\nsigns, with their pictorial origin and their possible Egyptian equivalents:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\], lineary form \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), representing a steaming pot, phonetic value \\( ga \\), primitively \\( gur \\), the first is 'milk' in Akkadian, but in the Semitic tongues we have \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) 'to be hot, to boil up,' \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) 'ewer, pot with pointed bottom,' we find in Egyptian the steaming pot \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) as determinative to \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) \\( \u0101r-t \\) 'milk,' perhaps weakened form with loss of initial \\( g \\), and the \\( t \\) mark of the feminine.\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\], archaic \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), lineary \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), represents the sail of a boat \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), the Semitic value \\( rim \\) (for \\( ric \\)) is taken from the root \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) 'to breathe,' the aspirate is often lost in Babylonian. In Egyptian we have the sail used as determinative for the word for 'wind, blow of wind, breathing,' \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) \\( nefi \\). This word corresponds also to the Semitic one, Eg. \\( n=Sem. r \\), Eg. \\( f=Sem. w \\), and the Eg. \\( i \\) represents the lost aspirate.\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\], arch. \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), lin. \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), is the image of an ear of corn, phonetic value \\( \u0161e \\), in Babylonian \\( \u0161eim \\), 'corn, wheat.' In Egyptian we have \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) \\( su \\) 'wheat,' with a feminine form \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) \\( stu \\), to be read \\( sut \\), and \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) \\( \u0161ames \\) 'an ear of corn.'\n\nIt is tempting to compare \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) and \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\) with the Egyptian \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), both signs have the ideographic meaning of 'life,' \\( Balatu \\) in Assyrian, in which it is also used with the value of \\( laku \\) 'to take,' and \\( silu \\) 'side'; its phonetic value is \\( ti \\), supposed to be the Akkadian pronunciation of the ideogram; in Egyptian the sign is read \\( \u1e0dn\u1e2b \\) 'life.' The value 'life' may after all in Babylonian have been given because the sign had the value \\( ti \\), weakened Sumerian form of the word \\( til \\) 'life,' Akk. \\( din \\). The ideogram for life, read \\( din \\) in Akk., is \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), arch. \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), lineary \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), which represents an eating bowl \\( \\text{\u0161a\u0161} \\), and no doubt used symbolically to mean 'living' and 'life.'\nBefore concluding, a few words must be said of the syllabaries derived from that of Babylon. The oldest of these derived syllabaries is that used at Susa, which yet differs very little from that of Babylon, and may be considered as only graphic variants.\n\nThe Vannic syllabary\\(^1\\) is derived from the Ninevite style of writing, and the combinations of the wedges are adapted to stone engraving. The characters have been much reduced in number, but the use of ideograms and determinatives is largely resorted to.\n\nThe syllabary of the Apirian inscriptions at Mal-Amir and that of the Medic text of the Bihustun monument are variants of the same.\\(^2\\) The first one, which is the oldest, appears to have been derived from the Babylonian signs of the later epoch. The characters have been considerably reduced in number and abbreviated; the ideograms are but few, but the determinatives are still maintained.\n\nThe Persian syllabary is nearly alphabetic. It seems to have been devised under the reign of Cyrus, by translating the Babylonian signs and taking for value the initial sound of the Persian words.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe Kappadokian syllabary, of which very little is known, was no doubt derived from early forms of characters used at Babylon. And possibly from it is derived the Cypriot system of writing.\n\nAs far back as 1868 F. Lenormant advanced that the Chinese system of writing was derived from that which was, he supposed, introduced by the Akkadians into Babylon.\\(^4\\) The same theory was advocated by Mr. Hyde Clarke. Lately an eminent Chinese scholar, Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie, took up the theory again; well qualified by his knowledge of old Chinese, but unfortunately unable, through his ignorance of the Akkadian and Babylonian syllabary and languages, to control the statements of the Assyriologists he had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, *Inscriptions of Van*, J.R.A.S.

The last exponent of the theory, Dr. Peters, has however shown much erudition; but the weak point is always the missing links, which would give the forms standing half way between the two systems of writing; he also does not perhaps take enough account of the arch\u00e6ological evidence.\n\n\\(^1\\) For instance, in his *Early History of the Chinese Civilization*, lecture reprinted from the Journal of the Society of Arts, London, 1880, he gives a plate of twelve Chinese characters compared with those of Babylonia; four are misread, and most of the others have the wrong reading attached to the meaning given.\nART. XXI.\u2014The Babylonian Chronicle. By Theo. G. Pinches, M.R.A.S.\n\nAmong the tablets acquired by the British Museum in 1884, is one of peculiar interest. It is a tablet of unbaked clay, $6\\frac{1}{8}$ in. by $7\\frac{3}{4}$ in., inscribed, on both sides, with two columns of writing in the Cuneiform or wedge-character. This tablet is one of a series which must have contained, when entire, a complete chronicle of all the important events which had taken place in Babylonia, Assyria, Elam, etc., in ancient times. The text (of which a paraphrase has already been published by the present writer,) begins with the reign of Nabonassar (747 B.C.), and ends with the accession of \u0160ama\u0161-\u0161um-ukin or Saosduchinos, brother of A\u0161\u0161ur-bani-apli (667 B.C.). The subject of this tablet was continued on others of the series, a part of one of the tablets, referring to the reign of Nabonidus and relating the capture of Babylon by Cyrus, having been acquired in 1878.\n\nThe publication of the present text was announced in the April number of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (p. 327), but my publication of the text of the Chronicle, made known to the world by the paraphrase given by me in 1884, has meanwhile been forestalled by a German Assyriologist, Dr. Hugo Winckler. No notice of his intention was given to me by Dr. Winckler, it having been fondly hoped (as I hear) by him and his friends, that my publication of the text would be rendered superfluous by this act. Dr.\n\n1 Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology for May, 1884.\n2 See the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. vii. part i. 1880.\n3 Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie for June, 1887.\nWinckler's edition of the text, however, is reproduced by the autographic process, and many of the characters are imperfectly printed. It contains, moreover, no less than fifteen mistakes, either of omission or of commission. Whether, therefore, my edition of this text be rendered superfluous or not by Dr. Winckler's forestalling, I leave to the reader to judge.\n\nThe first portion of the text, which includes four short paragraphs, refers to the reign of Nabonassar, during which there was a revolt in Borsippa. The next paragraph tells of the death of Nadinu, his son (who was killed in a revolt), the accession and overthrow of \u0160um-ukin, and the accession of Uk\u012bn-z\u0113r or Chinzirus. After this is a paragraph which speaks of the invasion of Babylonia by Tiglath-pileser III. of Assyria, and his mounting the throne of Babylon.\n\nThe seventh paragraph mentions the death of Tiglath-pileser and the accession of Shalmaneser. The eighth speaks of the death of the last-named and the accession of Sargon in Assyria and Merodach-baladan in Babylonia. The next five paragraphs treat of the conflicts which took place between the Babylonians and the Elamites on one side and the Assyrians on the other. Four of these paragraphs are imperfect, and the connection is sometimes lost. The 13th ends with the accession of B\u0113l-ibni (Belibus), who was placed on the Babylonian throne by Sennacherib. The next two paragraphs give an account of Sennacherib's continued incursions into Babylonia, the deposition of B\u0113l-ibni, and the accession of A\u0161\u0161ur-nadin-\u0161um, his son, to the throne of Babylon.\n\nThe 16th and 17th paragraphs give an account of affairs in Elam, and Sennacherib's invasion of that country, in revenge for which, \u1e2aallu\u0161u, king of Elam, invaded Babylonia, carried A\u0161\u0161ur-nadin-\u0161um captive, and set Nergal-u\u0161\u0113zib on the Babylonian throne. This king, as was natural, resisted the Assyrians, the result being that he was captured by the Assyrians in a battle which took place near Niffer (18). Affairs in Elam are then treated of, and the paragraph ends with an account of a renewed invasion of Elam by Sennacherib, and\nthe accession of Mu\u0161\u0113zib-Marduk in Babylon. The next paragraph (the 19th) refers to the battle of \u1e2aalul\u00ea between the Assyrians and the Elamites, the victory being attributed to the latter. The Elamites, however, seem afterwards to have united with the Assyrians against the Babylonians, and Mu\u0161\u0113zib-Marduk was captured and sent to Assyria.\n\nThe 20th paragraph refers to the affairs in Elam, and\u2014most important of all\u2014the murder of Sennacherib by one of his sons, during a revolt, and the accession of Esarhaddon. This is followed by an account of the rule of Esarhaddon in Babylon (paragraphs 21, 22 and 23), and a notice of his expedition against Sidon, etc., which is continued in the following paragraph. The 25th paragraph speaks of an invasion of Babylonia by Elam, the death of the Elamite king in his palace, \"not sick,\" the accession of Urtagu, and the carrying off of a Babylonian official to Assyria. The 26th refers to an Assyrian expedition to Egypt, and the return of Babylonian gods held captive by the Elamites; the 27th to Esarhaddon's progress towards Egypt, and the death of his queen. The 28th refers again to Esarhaddon's progress in Egypt, and records three battles there, resulting in the capture of the city of Memphis by the Assyrian army. The 30th refers to a second expedition of Esarhaddon to Egypt, his death on the road, and the accession of Assurbanipal in Assyria and Saosduchinos in Babylon. The 31st refers to the restoration of Babylonian gods held captive by the Assyrians, and is followed by the colophon giving the name of the owner and writer of the document.\nCOLUMN III.\n\n* Or\n* Here apparently an erasure in the original.\nTRANSCRIPTION.\n\nCOLUMN I.\n\n1. . . . . . . . . . . \u0161ar B\u00e2bili D.S.\n2. . . . . . . . . ina m\u00e2t A\u0161\u0161ur ina kuss\u00ee i\u0161ab\n3. \u0161attu \u0161uatu . . . m\u00e2t Akkad D.S. ur-dam-ma\n4. \u00e2lu Rab-bi-su u \u00e2lu \u1e24a-am-ra-nu i\u1e2b-ta-bat\n5. u \u012bl\u0101ni \u0161a \u0101l \u0160a-pa-az-za i-ta-bak\n\n6.

Waterhouse submitted some photographs, showing the application of the principle of so-called \"orthochromatic photography\"; also some specimens of heliogravure produced in the Survey of India Offices; and Dr. Rajendral\u00e1la Mitra made some appreciative remarks on the death of our late esteemed Member, Mr. Arthur Grote. After two contributions in natural history, a short paper was read by Mr. J. Cockburn on \"Sit\u00e1's Window, or Buddha's Shadow Cave, near Prabh\u00e1s\u00e1, with an eye copy of an ancient inscription in the Asoka characters.\"\n\n6th April, 1887.\u2014Lieut.-Col. J.

Yate, of the Afghan Boundary Commission.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, Paris, 6 April, 1887.\u2014M. Barbier de Meynard, Vice-President, in the Chair. After the election of a new Member, M. Senart presented a fresh impression of the Bhabra Inscriptions, and explained in detail such passages as had become clearer in its light. M. Cl\u00e9ment Huart made some remarks upon three B\u00e2bi works which would shortly be reported in the Journal. M. Hal\u00e9vy called attention to the following points in Assyrian texts: first, a system of enumeration like that in the Man\u00e9 th\u00e9cel phar\u00e8 of Daniel; second, the orthography Sa-mu-nu-ya-tu-nu for the Ph\u0153nician Eshmounyaton.\n\n13th May, 1887.\u2014M.

The Persian for Rouble.\n\nLONDON, August 10th, 1887.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the Persian *isken\u0101n* (paper-rouble), quoted in the issue of the Journal for April, I would suggest that this word seems to be a somewhat irregular, or rather, vulgar plural form of *askenas* (paper-money), which, according to Kasimirski, comes from the Russian word *assignatsya* (French assignat).\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. G. de Guiraudon, Capt.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n2. The Bibliography of Africa.\n\nLONDON, August 10th, 1887.\n\nSir,\n\nWill you allow me to add some information to the Bibliography of Africa for the current year?\n\nLieut. G. Binger, of the French Marines, has published at Paris, of course in the French language, a *Sketch on the Bambara Language*, as spoken in the Kaarta and the Beledougou, West Sudan: this language belongs to the Mandingo family, and it is the first serious attempt to reduce it to writing. Lieut. Binger's little work contains a short Grammar, many usual phrases, and a Vocabulary of about 2000 words, and is accompanied by an interesting map: this Handbook is a very valuable contribution towards our knowledge of African languages, and it will prove quite useful.\n\nLieut. Binger is now engaged in travelling from Bakel down to the Guinea coast, and he will, no doubt, bring back some interesting notices on the great Mandingo family.\n\nI am informed that the Roman Catholic Missionaries of the Senegambia have collected and will publish shortly an extensive Dictionary of the *Susu* language, also belonging to the Mandingo family, and for which we had only an old Vocabulary by Brunton (1802), with Grammar, and a little Grammar by Rev. J. H. Duport.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. G. de Guiraudon, Capt.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\nIV. OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nThe Rev. George Shirt, Senior Missionary of the Church Missionary Society in Sindh, was born at Cawthorne, Yorkshire, in 1843. Educated at the C.M.S. College, London, and the University of Cambridge, he took his B.A. degree at the latter, with honours (Oriental Tripos) in 1864. He left England for India in 1866, and was shipwrecked on his way out; but after spending four days and nights in an open boat, he and his companions in peril were picked up by a passing vessel, and landed safely in Bombay. Mr. Shirt was appointed to Hyderabad, the old capital of Sindh, and having rapidly acquired the language of the country, he laboured on till 1873, when he left on furlough to England. His stay at home was spent at Cambridge, where he was engaged chiefly in the study of Oriental languages. He returned to Sindh in 1875, and was stationed at Karachi till 1877. During these two years he compiled, at the request of the Government of India, his Sindhi Dictionary. In October, 1881, being in a bad state of health, he went to Quetta for three months, during which short period, besides carrying on his studies in Arabic, he acquired a considerable knowledge of Brahui. In August, 1882, he came to England on furlough, and again settled at Cambridge, where, besides taking an active part in parish work, he continued his Oriental studies in the University. During this period he competed for the \"Brotherton Sanskrit Prize,\" and was adjudged equal with another, the prize being divided. In January, 1885, he returned to India through Persia, by means of which tour he added to an already scholarly acquaintance with Classic Persian a powerful knowledge of the Colloquial.\n\nArriving in Sindh, he made Sukkur his head-quarters, and once again took up the great work of his life, in carrying on his Translation of the Bible into Sindhi. He was spared, not only to translate, but also to thoroughly revise and test, the greater portion of the Holy Scriptures. A number of smaller books, tracts, and hymns were given by him at various times, during his twenty years' work, to the Sindhi Church. In April, 1886, he was sent, in company with Dr. S. W. Sutton, to open the new C. M. S. Mission at Quetta. He entered upon this fresh sphere of work with all his accustomed energy, working at the same time hard at Brahui. At\n\n1 Memoir kindly contributed by the Rev. J. Bambridge.\nthe beginning of June he was taken ill, and on the 16th he died, quite suddenly, and without pain. As a Christian Missionary and Pastor he was equalled by few, whilst by a diligent use of his great linguistic talents, he surpassed many in the amount of literary work he was enabled to accomplish. By Europeans and natives, Christians and Non-Christians, throughout the Province of Sindh, he was beloved and respected. Mr. Shirt was married in 1868, and leaves a widow and eight children.\n\nIn 1878 his name first appears among the Members of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was, moreover, a Fellow of the University of Bombay.\n\nThe Hon. Sir Ashley Eden, K.C.S.I. and C.I.E.,\u00b9 whose death took place in London on the 9th July, was a son of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and educated at Winchester and Haileybury. Of his life at the latter seminary nothing is worthy of remark save his comparative indifference to the results of the periodical examinations, which are popularly supposed to foreshadow the career of after-years. Passing in some way or another through these barriers of successful egress, he passed out in 1852, and joining the Bengal Civil Service, soon began to show of what stuff he was made, with the result, that in 1861, although but of nine years' standing, he was selected as Special Envoy to Sikkim. He did his work well on this occasion, and was rewarded with the Secretaryship of the Bengal Government, a post which he held for the long period of nine years, leaving his duties for a while to take charge of the Special Mission to Bhutan in 1864. In 1871 Mr. Eden became Chief Commissioner of British Burma, and in 1882 succeeded to the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. After the regulated five years\u2014having become in the meanwhile Hon. Sir Ashley Eden, K.C.S.I.\u2014he retired from the Service, and joined the Council of the Secretary of State for India. Possessed of great determination of character, and wide experience of Bengal customs and manners, his loss in this country is well-nigh irreparable. Many who disagreed with his views will avow that he was a most powerful opponent and a most vigorous foe. He became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1882, and at the period of his decease was on the Executive Committee of the Imperial Institute.\n\nThe death of Sir Barrow Helbert Ellis, K.C.S.I.,\u00b2 removes from\n\n\u00b9 By A. N. Wollaston, Esq., C.I.E., M.R.A.S.\n\u00b2 By Sir George Birdwood, M.D., K.C.I.E., C.S.I., M.R.A.S.\nthe world a distinguished member of the Anglo-Indian community of London, and one of the most active Members of this Society, which he joined in 1876, and served on its Council from 1878 to the period of his decease, having been for three years a Vice-President. He was educated at University College School, and University College, London, and matriculated, in 1839, at the University of London, taking a scholarship in classics. He subsequently entered Haileybury College, from which he was appointed to the Bombay Civil Service on the 26th of July, 1843, arriving in India on the 11th December in the same year. He served from 1844 as Third Assistant-Collector, and from 1847 as Second Assistant at Ratnagiri; from 1848 as Commissioner for investigating certain claims against the Nizam's Government; and from 1851 to 1855 as Assistant Commissioner, and from 1855 to 1857 in charge of the office of Commissioner, in Sind. This was during Sir Bartle Frere's absence in England, just before the outbreak of the Mutiny. From 1857 to 1859 he was at different times in charge of the office of Revenue Commissioner for the Southern Division of the Bombay Presidency, Special Commissioner for Jaghirs in Sind, and afterwards Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Revenue, Finance and General Departments, Government Director of the Bank of Bombay, and a Member of the Mint Committee; and, finally, for a short time, Collector and Magistrate of Broach.\n\nIn April, 1860, he was confirmed as Secretary to Government, and in 1862 was made an additional Member of the Bombay Legislative Council, and Revenue Commissioner for the Northern Division of the Bombay Presidency; and in 1865 an ordinary Member of the Bombay Council. On the 2nd of May, 1870, he was selected as a Member of the Governor-General's Council; and on retiring from the Bombay Civil Service, on the 27th of April, 1875, he was appointed a Member of the Council of the Secretary of State for ten years from July, 1875. Within two years of his final retirement from the public service he died, on the 20th of June last, at Aix-les-Bains. His remains were brought home, and buried in the Jewish Cemetery at Willesden.\n\nSir Barrow Ellis was one of the ablest Revenue Officers of the Bombay Presidency, ever prolific of ability in this important department of the Indian administration, the brilliant traditions of which have been so honourably sustained in the present generation by such men as Sir B. Ellis, Mr. Pedder, C.S.I., and Mr. Peile, C.S.I.\n\nSir Barrow Ellis was remarkable also for the perfect confidence he\ninspired in himself, and the Government he represented, among the various native communities of Western India. He was accessible to natives of all ranks and grades, who ever met with a patient and attentive hearing from him, and, where it was possible, the fullest and most cordial support. He thus endeared himself widely among them. His genuine sympathy with them is evinced by his will, in which he has left a sum of \u00a3500 to the Northbrook Indian Society, for the benefit of the Club, at No. 3, Whitehall Gardens, and the further sum of \u00a32500 to be placed in trust for the benefit of the poor of Ratnagiri, his first official charge as an Assistant-Collector in the Bombay Presidency. Also while in Bombay on his way to England in 1875 he presented the local University with the sum of Rs. 1500 for an annual prize of books to the student who, on matriculation, passed the best examination in an Oriental language. Five years before, when leaving Western India to take up his appointment as Member of the Viceregal Council at Calcutta, public subscriptions to the amount of Rs. 7206 were invested on behalf of the Bombay University for awarding a scholarship in the name of Sir Barrow Ellis, to the student who passed the best examination in the English Language and Literature at the annual B.A. examination of the University.\n\nIn private life Sir Barrow Ellis was distinguished for his unbounded hospitality. He kept open house for all comers in India, and in this country his house in Cromwell Road was the common centre of Anglo-Indian officials from the Bombay Presidency, and of natives from every part of India. It is a remarkable fact that all the ablest Revenue Officers in India have been notable for their hospitality, and quick sympathy with the people of India; and no doubt their natural virtue in these respects, through keeping them in close touch with native feeling and opinion, has powerfully contributed to their success as administrators.\n\nIn the Asiatic Society, as in all his other offices, Sir Barrow Ellis was a thoroughly practical and useful adviser. Without any pretence to profound Oriental scholarship, he had a very fair knowledge of more than one Eastern tongue, and was a prominent promoter of education in Sind under the ever memorable government of that Province by the late Sir Bartle Frere.\n\nThe death, on the 7th August, at Malta, of Sir Joseph Ritchie Lyon Dickson, M.D., has deprived the Society of a valued member of more than twenty years' standing. For nearly forty years Physician to H.M. Legation in Persia\u2014i.e. since 11th September,\n1847\u2014Dr. Dickson was well known to European residents and natives of all grades in the Shah\u2019s capital, not only for his medical skill and the readiness and kindliness with which this was rendered available to his fellows, but for his intimate acquaintance with the ways and customs, and sympathy with the character of the people among whom he lived. Many visitors to Teheran during the present generation will bear testimony to the deceased officer\u2019s genial qualities, and usefulness in imparting those lessons of local experience which are invaluable to travellers and diplomatists. His place of residence was always to be distinguished by groups of patient candidates for treatment and advice seated outside the door; and the fluency with which he spoke Persian, as also his intuitive grasp of its idiom, were remarkable. Sir Joseph Dickson accompanied the Shah on his visit to England in 1873, and on the 30th June of that year received the honour of Knighthood.\n\nV. Excerpta Orientalia.\n\nThe first number of part i. vol. lvi. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal contains a brief account of Tibet from \u201cDsam Ling Gyeshe,\u201d the well-known geographical work of Lama Tsam-po Nomian Khan of Amdo, translated by Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, C.I.E., and S\u00edt\u00e1\u2019s Window, or Buddha\u2019s Shadow Cave, by S. J. Cockburn, Esq., M.A.S.Bengal. Mr. Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s is a most painstaking and intelligent Government servant, honourable mention of whose name has already been made in these Notes. His present paper is a reprint from an official report, but valuable in more than an official sense. The second paper, though very brief, is replete with epigraphic interest. The writer would identify the cave to which he refers with the \u201clofty stone cavern of a venomous dragon, in which Buddha was supposed to have left his shadow, and the spot visited by Hwen Thsang in the seventh century.\u201d Mr. Cockburn was enabled to copy the inscription above the door by using an astronomical telescope. He had first discovered it through his own glass, for it is, to all intents and purposes, invisible to the naked eye.\n\nAn extra number of the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society is given up to Prof. Peterson\u2019s third Report on the Search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Circle during 1884\u201386. To this is added an Index of Books for the three Reports, and three valuable Appendices, the first of which is an illustrative and elaborately-prepared catalogue of the Palm-leaf MSS. in the Temple at Santinath, Cambay; the second supplies extracts from books preserved in libraries at Ahmadabad, Boondi, Kotah, Indore and Cambay; and the third relates to the Manuscripts acquired for Government.\nPart I. of the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan contains the following papers: 1. Japanese, by E. H. Parker; 2. The Yellow Languages, by the same; 3. On the Quasi-characters called Ya-jirushi, by B. H. Chamberlain; 4. The Gakashikain, by W. Denning; 5. The Manchus, by E. H. Parker; 6. The Manchu Relations with Corea, by the same; 7. Connection of Japanese with the adjacent continental languages, by Dr. Edkins; 8. On Maritime Enterprise in Japan, by H. A. C. Bonar; and 9. An Ainu Bear Hunt, by B. H. Chamberlain. It will be seen that out of nine articles, no less than four are from the pen of Mr. Parker. The first two of these contributions are linguistic, while the other two are concise historical notes. Of Mr. Chamberlain's two papers the main defect is brevity. Not inferior in interest to any of the articles is Mr. Denning's account of the Society named in his title, founded at the suggestion of the Vice-Minister of Education in Japan. Mr. Bonar imparts to his readers much valuable information, and his pages are beautifully illustrated. Altogether, the June number of the Journal is excellent.\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique, huiti\u00e8me s\u00e9rie, tome ix. No. 3 (Avril-Mai-Juin, 1887), are the following papers:\u20141. Le S\u016btra d'Up\u0101li (Up\u0101li Suttum), by M. L. Feer. This creditable outcome of studies in Buddhism (\u00c9tudes Bouddhiques), is a translation from the P\u0101li text, with extracts from the Commentary, and an instructive prefatory Note. 2. Bibliographie Ottomane: a notice of Turkish, Arabic and Persian Books printed in Constantinople, by M. Cl. Huart. 3. Le premier conflit entre Pharisiens et Saduc\u00e9ens, by M. Montet: a singular paper, discussing three authorities, Josephus, the Babylonian Talmud, and Abu'l Fath, the Samaritan chronicler of the fourteenth century. 4. Le texte originale du Yih-king, sa nature et son interpr\u00e9tation, by M. C. de Harlez. 5. Note sur la grande inscription N\u00e9o-punique, et sur une autre inscription d'Altibaros. 6. Notes d'\u00e9pigraphie et d'histoire Arabe, by M. Clermont-Ganneau. The Nouvelles et Milanges contains M. Rubens Duval's criticism of the method of Dr. Payne Smith's Thesaurus Syriacus, but in no way disparaging its high merit. He says: \"La richesse des renseignements qu'il renferme, l'abondance des citations toujours exactes, emprunt\u00e9es aux meilleurs autorit\u00e9s, les dissertations du savant Orientaliste, toujours en qu\u00eate des nuances les plus d\u00e9licates des mots, font de l'ouvrage un guide indispensable pour quiconque veut acqu\u00e9rir une connaissance approfondie de la langue Syriaque ou \u00e9claircir des locutions difficiles des autres langues S\u00e9mitiques.\" There is also a second note by M. Bergaigne on his Recherches sur l'histoire de la Samhit\u00e1 du Rig-veda; M. Mourier's memoir of Chota Rousthavoli, a Georgian poet of the twelfth century; a paper by M. Rodet, on a subject too little studied, and at one time utterly neglected in Indian Civil Service examinations\u2014the expression of numbers in writing among natives of India; and short reviews of M. Van den Berg's Hadhra-mout and a French translation of the late Count de No\u00ebr's essay on Akbar.\nGerman Oriental Society, vol. xli. part i. contains: \"II. Die Separat-Edicte,\" being a continuation of G. B\u00fchlcr's interpretation of the Asoka Inscriptions; Goldziher's \"Materialen zur Kenntniss der Almohaden bewegung in Nord-Afrika\"; Himly's \"Die Denkmaler der Kantonen Moschee\"; and B\u00f6htlingk's \"Noch ein Wort zur Maurja-Frage in Mah\u00e1b\u00e1shya.\" There is also a review, signed O. B\u00f6htlingk, of Dr. Speijer's Sanskrit Syntax, mentioned in our April Notes.\n\nIn the recently-published Part I. Vol. IX. Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, the Memoir of Dr. Birch, Notes on Antiquities from Bubastis, Professor Sayce's \"Karian Language and Inscriptions,\" and M. Lef\u00e9bure's paper on \"Le Cham et l'Adam Egyptien,\" have all a certain interest for the Royal Asiatic Society. The \"Martyrdom of Isaac of Tiphre\" affords a new instance of the increased activity of Coptic scholars in bringing to light valuable records hitherto little known in this country. M. Am\u00e9lineau, though dwelling chiefly on a later period of Egyptian history, may be looked upon as a fellow-labourer in the same field.\n\nArchaeology.\u2014In the Madras Mail of June 29 Surgeon-General Bidie gives a very interesting account of his visit, in company of Mr. Thorowgood, to the prehistoric graves near Pallavaram. The following are extracts:\n\n\"Such burial-places are known to the natives in some districts as Pandu-kuris or Pandu-kulis, and in other districts as Panda-vagudlu, Pundaval-kovil, etc. . . . In some instances, they are simply kistaevens; in others\u2014and more commonly\u2014dolmens or cairns as on the Nilgiris, and lastly, we have the coffin-like vessels, such as those under notice, made of coarse pottery. The dolmens also differ in type, being in some cases roomy stone-built chambers with a cap-stone, the whole being usually buried in the earth; while in other localities they stand free, the dolmen being surrounded with several circles of stone slabs with rounded tops, like the head stones in a modern graveyard. Excellent specimens of the latter type exist at Tralabanda, Bapanatham, near Palmaner, and in the Kolar district, but this style is not common. The dolmens vary in size, some of those buried in tumuli having a floor area of $8\\frac{1}{2} + 5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet, and being as much as $6\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in depth. In some cases a rectangular stone slab like a couch or bed, and supported at the corners by bits of stone, like legs, has been found resting on the floor of the dolmen. In fact, the construction of these sepulchral chambers shows some resemblance to the dwellings of the living, and we shall find that the similarity was still further maintained by the deposit along with the dead body of household utensils, arms, ornaments and tools, such as were used by the person when alive. It seems also pretty clear that the tumulus with its dolmen in the interior or outside on the crown of the elevation, and its enclosing concentric circles of stones, was the prototype of the Buddhist tope or dagoba, with its rails, mound and relic casket. At present there is no people in Southern India who practise\ndolmen burial, and the time at which these monuments were constructed is so remote that no existing race has any reminiscences of their origin, and all repudiate them. The Pallavaram sarcophagi, which have been so well described by Mr. Thorowgood, are made of burnt clay, and in one fragment of a broken one which I saw, the hard outer layer of the straw which had been mixed with the clay is still extant. The oblong vessels hitherto seen vary in length from upwards of six feet down to a little over two feet, and stand on strong legs which have somewhat the appearance of a pig's snout, nose downwards. The proper sarcophagi have as many as twelve legs, and the smaller six, and each leg is hollow, from seven to eight inches high, and pierced about midway with two round holes, which were probably made to facilitate the escape of gases in firing the clay. Looking at the vessel sideways, it has at a little distance some resemblance to a big caterpillar. . . . Mr. Thorowgood also mentions the occurrence of large globular sepulchral urns. . . . The popular belief regarding these . . . is, according to Bishop Caldwell, that in ancient days men lived to a great age, and shrank to the size of a cat. They were then put in lamp-niches in the walls to keep them out of harm, and when at last the relatives got tired of the aged pigmies, they put them in these large jars and left them to die. This is contradicted by the sizes of the bones found in the urns, which are generally those of ordinary-sized individuals, and is simply one of those myths which are sure to fasten on any object or subject the explanation of which is lost in the mists of antiquity. Besides the large pyriform jars, there are also occasionally found big vessels of a fusiform shape, and one of those exhumed at Pallavaram has been sent to the Museum by Mr. Thorowgood. The articles which are lodged in dolmens and sarcophagi along with human bones, or in the places which once contained the latter, form a very curious paraphernalia, and plainly point to some glimmering idea of a future life, analogous to the present, having been entertained by the dolmen-builders. . . . South Indian dolmens and prehistoric graves differ in one important respect from those found elsewhere, viz. in the fact that they never contain any implements belonging to the Stone age. This, however, is of no value as a chronological fact, as some Indian tribes were making stone hatchets in modern times; and all that it shows, therefore, is that stone implements and weapons were not in common use when the graves were constructed. In a dolmen in the Coimbatore District some small human figures in copper were found. They are now lodged in the Museum, and are believed to be of Jain origin. A number of bronze articles also have been found in the curious Nilgiri cairns. . . . Sir Walter Elliot held the opinion, and so do others, that the dolmens were erected by the Kurumbars, and this view receives support from the fact that at the present time the shepherds of this race in North Arcot erect dolmens upon a small scale when a Goudu or head of a sept dies. On the other hand, it seems strange that any great difference should be found in the plan\nof such monuments if they were the work of one race. It appears to me that not one but many races living at different times were the constructors of the dolmens. In fact, that these structures indicate a certain stage in the mental history of a people, and are due to a psychological principle which is the constant outcome of intellectual development. . . . The differences which we see in them would probably be due to the nature of the constructive materials available, and to the variation in customs and beliefs.\"\n\nIn the Academy of June 4, Mr. Burgess explains how Dr. F\u00fchrer discovered, and obtained his copy of the inscription, in Gupta characters, over the cave of R\u00e1ja Gop\u00e1la (Banda district). He was not at the time aware that it had been previously brought to notice.\n\nA Supplement to the Fatehpur Gazetteer, by Mr. F. S. Growse, published at Allahabad in 1887, purposed to correct certain inaccuracies in the topographical half of the larger work, and to supply the blank in architectural and arch\u00e6ological information occasioned by the incompetence to deal with such matters of the native subordinates engaged on the original compilation. The statement in the preface that \"every paragraph is the result of personal observation\" will carry double weight from the writer's well-known zeal and ability. \"It will now be seen,\" he says, \"that the district, instead of being exceptionally barren in objects of historical interest, is richer than many\u2014far more so than Bulandshahr, for example, in monuments of the past.\"\n\nThe June and July numbers of the Indian Antiquary continue Mr. Patlibhai B. H. Wadia's \"Folk-lore in Western India,\" and Pandit S. M. Natesa's \"Folk-lore in Southern India\"\u2014both pleasant reading and instructive to those who seek more from them than amusement; Professor Kielhorn contributes a note on the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1shya, and a paper on \"Three Chandra Copper Plate Grants\"; the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles three more Kashmiri stories; the Rev. S. Beal \"Some Remarks on the Suhrillekha, or Friendly Communications of Nagarjuna-Bodhisatva to King Shatopohanna\"; Professor R. G. Bhandarkar \"A Supplementary Note on the Maurya Passage in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1shya\"; and Mr. Fleet \"No. 170 of Sankrit and Old-Kanarese Inscriptions,\" as well as \"The Date of the Poet Rajasekhara.\" The Miscellanea and Book Notices of both the Antiquary and Notes and Queries, would, it is believed, carry more weight if invariably signed or initialled by the several writers; or the source specified where an extract is taken from another periodical. Part cxix. for August, besides a continuation of the Pandit's Folk-lore in Southern India, Mr. Fleet's Sanskrit and Kanarese Inscriptions, and Professor Kielhorn's Notes on the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1shya, has a practical and praiseworthy though very short paper, on the \"Som\u00e1li as a Written Language.\" Its writer, Capt. King, of the Bombay Staff Corps, alluding to Dr. Cust's classification of this tongue under the Ethiopic sub-group of the Hamitic family, says:\u2014\"This may be the original stock on which the language mainly is founded; but the existence of a pre-Hamitic\nelement in it is not improbable. Various influxes from Hadhra-\nmant and Yemen have added a Semitic element which now seems\nto predominate, and this element is observable, not alone in\nindividual words, but also in the construction.\u201d A bright note by\nMr. Grierson forms the month\u2019s \u201cMiscellanea.\u201d\n\nIn the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund for\nJuly the chief contributors are Capt. Conder, MM. Schick and\nSchumacher, and Drs. Chaplin and Hutchinson. From the \u201cNotes\nand News,\u201d it appears that Herr Schumacher will arrange with\nthe Turkish authorities for the removal of the sarcophagi recently\nfound near Sidon; and that the same gentleman\u2019s English-translated\n\u201cJaulan\u201d and Ajlun Memoirs will be published by the Society.\nWhatever opposition Capt. Conder may meet with in the pending\nsettlement of the great Hittite question, he will deserve the thanks\nof philologists and other learned bodies for a bold enunciation of\nviews which none but a privileged few are competent to accept or\nreject, as well as for throwing broadcast original linguistic problems\nto interest the many. His notion that Ed Dejj\u00e2l, or more strictly\n\u201cAl Masihu\u2019d-Dajj\u00e2l,\u201d may originate in \u201cthe Masdean ideas of\nthe false prophet,\u201d because \u201cnearly the whole of the Moslem\neschatology is founded on Persian ideas,\u201d needs, however,\nwarranted as a general observation, to be confronted with the\nmany interpretations given by learned Muhammadans of the Anti-\nChrist they have been taught to expect. According to the compiler\nof the Q\u00e2mus, Mr. Hughes reminds us in his Dictionary of Isl\u00e2m,\n\u201cthere have been at least fifty reasons assigned for his (the Dajj\u00e2l)\nbeing called al Mas\u00eeh.\u201d\n\nHebrew and Semitic Languages.\u2014In a note headed \u201cSemitismi\nnel Libro dei Re di Firdusi,\u201d at page 74 of the Giornale della\nSocieta Asiatica Italiana, M. Pizzi finds in the Shah Nameh certain\nAramaic, Jud\u00e6o-Pahlavi, and Arabic words, forms or expressions\nof which he gives instances: Mas\u00eeh\u00e2, Sal\u00eep\u00e2 (salib\u00fb), Sk\u00fbb\u00e2 and\nSk\u00fbp\u00e2 (episkup\u00f4). These, he is disposed to believe, the author\nobtained from a Pahlavi source, rather than that they were words\nin common use by the people among whom he lived. 2. Bad-\nkun\u00eesh he looks upon as exemplifying, in the final sh\u00ee of Kunisht,\na Jud\u00e6o-Persianism, consequently a Semiticism. 3. Khud\u00e2vand,\nwhen used in the sense of Sah\u00eeb, \u201cpossessor,\u201d before the thing\npossessed, he regards as an Arabicism; for instance, Khud\u00e2vand-i-\nn\u00e1m, Khud\u00e2vand-i-shamsh\u00eer, etc., etc. Nishast (inf. Nishastan),\ncombined with G\u00e2h, a place, is compared with the Arabic Majl\u00ees\nor Maglis, a place of sitting. R\u00e2m\u00eesh and R\u00e2m\u00eeshgar, when meaning\nmusic and musicians, are likened to the Tarab and Mu\u1e6drib of the\nArabs. D\u00e2r, used as a capital, is assimilated to the Arabic B\u00e1b.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of July 23 recommends to beginners the Hebrew\nGrammar by the Rev. W. H. L\u00f6we, which has just appeared in\nMessrs. Hodder and Stoughton\u2019s series entitled \u201cThe Theological\nEducator.\u201d It remarks that \u201cMr. L\u00f6we has shown his immense\nlearning in Biblical Hebrew by his commentary on the Psalms and\non Zechariah, and in Rabbinical Hebrew by his edition from MSS. of the so-called Mishnah of the Talmud of Jerusalem, and of a fragment of the Babylonian Talmud of Pesahim.\"\n\nGeneral Houtum-Schindler, in the Academy of June 18, reverts to the translation of the word \"Kip\u00f4d,\" propounded by the Rev. J. Davies in the same journal last December (see page 325 of our Quarterly Notes). He considers the Arabic version hubdra, \"bastard,\" to be the right one\u2014utterly discarding the fanciful connection of this word with the Persian \u00e1h\u00fb-barah \"a fawn.\"\n\nDie Semitische Sprachen. Eine Skizze, von Th. N\u00f6ldeke.\u2014In our January \"Notes,\" allusion was made to Professor N\u00f6ldeke's valuable contribution to vol. xxi. of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. The German original of this article, revised and enlarged, has been reprinted at Leipzig, and forms the subject of an elaborate notice by M. J. Halevy in the Revue Critique of the 8th August. In one respect M. N\u00f6ldeke and his reviewer differ. The former considers the Nabateans to be Arabs who used the Aramean as a literary language; while the latter regards them as Arameans who had borrowed certain Arabic words from the dialects of their Arab neighbours.\n\nDr. M. Rabbinowicz has announced the approaching publication of a new edition of his French translation of the Babylonian Talmud, or that section regarding the civil and criminal law of the Jews, the position of the women, medicine and other sciences, beliefs, manners and customs, and relations with the heathen. The work will be published in six volumes of about 500-600 pages octavo each, printed on fine paper. Six hundred copies, handsomely bound, will be issued to subscribers at one guinea a volume. It is expected that they will be ready at intervals of about six months. Messrs. H. Grevel and Co., 33, King Street, W.C., are the London agents.\n\nIn the Academy, 11th June, Professor Neubauer, under the head \"Arabia in the Land of Goshen,\" throws out the following suggestions: \"Can it be that the word Arabia represents the Hebrew Arba in the old name of Hebron, Kirjath Arba? . . . I have always been tempted to consider the P in such proper names as Balak, Amalek, and Anak as a suffix. Balak would thus be 'one who belongs to Baal'; Amalek, a tribe worshipping Amal=Amel; and perhaps also Dameshek (Damascus), a town consecrated to a deity called Demesh, or something like it.\"\n\nArabic.\u2014The somewhat exceptional character of Howell's Grammar and Prof. Sachau's Albiruni render it necessary to defer notices of both works until January. In the meantime, attention is drawn to the estimate of the former expressed in the Saturday Review of March 26, and to the high value set upon the latter by our distinguished Honorary Member, Senator M. Am\u00e1ri of Pisa.\n\nA new fasciculus (viii. 2) of Lane's Arabic Lexicon, edited by Mr. Stanley Lane Poole, has appeared, reaching page 2912. Two more fasciculi (Athen. 16 July) complete the alphabet. Hasty criticism\nof such a work were mere presumption, unless confined to a particular word or entry. But it is mere justice to the indefatigable editor to acknowledge the self-evident ability he has displayed in the production of this latest instalment of the Arabic-English Dictionary.\n\nAt the sitting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique in Paris on the 13th May, a letter was read from the Archbishop of Damascus, offering a catalogue of the Arabic MSS. in the library of that city; and an announcement was made from the Secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie du Var that a complete translation of the Arabian Nights would be shortly published.\n\nMr. James Richard Jewett, \"who has been teaching in Arabic in a little native school at Zahleek, Mount Lebanon,\" has informed the Oriental American Society \"that he has a large collection of Proverbs and other texts in the common Arabic dialect of Syria, with translation, notes and vocabulary, all well-advanced towards readiness for publication.\" Some Arabic proverbs, it is observed, were submitted by this gentleman to the above-named Society at their meeting in October last.\n\nAssyriology.\u2014By his analysis of the first fascicle of Delitzsch's Assyrischen W\u00f6rterbuch, in the Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, Professor David Lyon has earned the thanks of students. To those who have been unable to subscribe to the work, it will give an admirable account of its teaching; while those who have become privileged to receive its several instalments will have their attention drawn to particular points which the Professor's high reputation stamps as worthy of comment.\n\nM Carl Bezold's Journal of Assyriology for April contains M. Barth's \"Das Nominal-Pr\u00e4fix na im Assyrischen\"; a contribution by M. Winckler on some recently published Assyrian texts, and the Babylonian Chronicle (of which the long since prepared edition by Mr. Pinches appears in the present number of our own Journal); M. Tiele's remarks on E-sagila in Babel and E-zida in Borsippa; a continuation of M. Jensen's \"Hymnen auf des Wiedererscheinen de drei grossen Lichtg\u00f6tter\"; together with the Sprechsaal, Recensionen and Bibliographie.\n\nNos. 8 and 9 of the Babylonian and Oriental Record contain articles of much interest, though for the most part fragmentary. In both M. Amiaud discusses \"the various names of Sumer and Akkad in the Cuneiform texts,\" and Mr. Pinches affords \"Glimpses of Babylonian and Assyrian Life.\" The remaining articles are Babylonia and China, by Professor Dr. T. de Lacouperie; Some Babylonian Cylinders, by Mr. W. H. Ward, of New York; A Statement of Accounts in Nabopolassar's time, by Dr. V. Revillout; a critical notice of Dr. F. Delitzsch's Assyrian W\u00f6rterbuch; an outline of Professor Sayce's third and fourth Hibbert Lectures; the Borsippa Inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar, by Mr. S. A. Smith; No. 2 of Dr. Casartelli's Pehlevi Notes; Remarks on some Euphratean Astronomical Names in the Lexicon of H\u00e9sychios, by Mr. Robt.\nBrown, jun.; and Notes, News and Queries on miscellaneous subjects.\n\nIndependently of its Journal, the Italian Asiatic Society has issued No. 1 of its separate publications, entitled *Crestomazia Assira con Paradigmi Grammaticali*. The author, Dr. Bruto Teloni, claims to be but a compiler, and his work is meant for beginners in Assyriology. It contains a syllabary, a sketch grammar, a few texts, with interlinear transliteration and commentary, and a glossary, in which the words are placed under the Hebrew roots. Some critics will doubtless object that the Doctor follows too closely the German school, and ignores much that has been written in other countries, consequently falling into errors which a wider study might have avoided.\n\n*Hittite.*\u2014In the *Times* of August 22 is described a quadrangular h\u00e6matite seal discovered not long ago near Tarsus by Mr. Greville Chester, and, owing to certain of its characteristics, regarded as Hittite. The presence of equilateral triangles on this, as on the circular seal previously found at Yuzgat (and now in the British Museum), is interpreted to represent sacred or mystical objects. If such notion be correct, the two together are brought into apparent connexion with Indian symbolism.\n\n*Aryan Languages.*\u2014M. Sol. Rainach, in a long and instructive criticism of M. Penka's *Die Herkunft der Aryer* (Wien, Prochaska), speaking of the lately disputed Asiatic origin of the Aryans, writes: \"Le premier qui ait envisag\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me sous toutes ses faces, en appelant \u00e0 son aide les t\u00e9moignages de la linguistique, de l'anthropologie, de la pal\u00e9ontologie, et de l'histoire, pour conclure \u00e0 l'origine Europ\u00e9enne des Aryens, est M. Penka.\" This assertion is of itself a powerful advertisement. But the whole question has just been reviewed by Prof. Sayce in the Anthropological Section of the British Association at Manchester.\n\n*Sanskrit.*\u2014In the *Revue Critique* of June 6 is a notice of Dr. Pischel's edition of Rudrata's \u0106\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ratilaka and Ruyyaka's Sahridayatila. The first of these works, according to M. Sylvain L\u00e9vi, has enabled its author to display that passion for subtle analysis and minute classification which exemplifies at once the genius and mania characteristic of the Hindu mind. The second work is chiefly commended as illustrative of literary composition of a peculiar kind. With reference to the whole performance, it is considered that, whatever value may be attached to the learned editor's own conclusions, his publication and exposition of the native text will henceforth become indispensable to students.\n\nProfessor Max M\u00fcller enriches the columns of the *Academy* of July 30th with a pleasant review of Professor Peterson's edition of the popular *Hitopadesa*, noting his discovery of the verse containing the author's name, \"suppressed,\" for some reason or other, by Schlegel and Lassen. The editor is said, by this new publication, to have \"earned the thanks of all Sanskrit scholars.\"\n\nThe same number also mentions an edition of the *Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101* with \u015ar\u012bdharasv\u0101min's Commentary and a Bengali translation\nunder preparation, chiefly for the use of native students, by Gop\u00e2la Chandra Chattopadhyaya, in Calcutta.\n\nAmong the papers laid before the 18th Annual Meeting of the American Philological Association, held at Ithaca, N.Y., in July, 1886, was a translation by Professor Whitney of the Katha Upanishad. Instead of reading it through, the learned philologist remarked upon the Upanishad literature in general, in its relation to the history of religious thought in India. The abstract of his address, recorded in the Proceedings, concludes as follows:\u2014\"It appears impossible to regard the element of metempsychosis itself as having a popular origin, as developing by any natural process out of the older forms of Hindu religions; it must have been, as it here exhibits itself, rather the product of a school of religious philosophy, though winning afterward a general currency and acceptation, as is testified by its underlying the later systems of philosophy, including the philosophy of Buddhism.\"\n\nIn the Athen\u00e6um of July 30, a Sanskrit Critical Journal, \"edited under the auspices of the Oriental Institute at Woking, by Pandit Rishi Kesh Shastri,\" is noticed. \"Its object,\" we are told, \"is not only the cultivation of Sanskrit learning and research, but also the formation of a linguistic command over that ancient language, especially for the expression of modern ideas.\"\n\nThe publication of Panini's Grammatik Hrsg., \u00fcbers., erl\u00e4utert., &c., O. B\u00f6htlingk, 8 Lfg. Leipzig, Haessel, is notified in the Academy of June 11.\n\nPahlavi.\u2014M. Darmesteter notices in the Revue Critique of June 20 a pamphlet of 80 pages, entitled Gajastik Abalish, professing to be the report of a Theological discussion presided over by the Khalif Ma'm\u00fbn. The text is published for the first time with translation, commentary and lexicon, and should be of exceptional interest to Pahlavi students.\n\nVol. xxxii. of the splendid series of Sacred Books of the East, containing part iii. of the Zend Avesta, translated by the Rev. L. H. Mills, has been received in the Society's Library. Professor Darmesteter, to whom the public is indebted for the translation of parts i. and ii., not having the requisite time at his disposal to continue his labours in this field, had himself apparently indicated a fitting successor.\n\nTurkish.\u2014The June number of the Austrian monthly journal (Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient) has an interesting paper on Turkish Inscriptions of the last century in the grounds at Hadersdorf; and in July there is a notice, dated Basrah, 1884, on the inhabitants and tracts of Turkish Arabia between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf.\n\nCentral Asia.\u2014The Deutsche Litteraturzeitung of July 9 remarks that Karasin's Sketches of Travel on the Road from Orenburg to Tashkend are \"full of life.\"\n\nIndia.\u2014The first Annual Report of the Max Denso Hall Literary Society for 1885-86 is indicative of healthy work at Karachi. There is no apparent reason why this should not be the nucleus of\na yet larger and more important Institution, as contemplated by many of its Members. But efforts must be continuous and wisely directed.\n\nThe three numbers of *Indian Notes and Queries* for the first quarter of 1887\u2014of which February and January were saved from the wreck of the Tasmania, and reached the Society on the 21st July\u2014are fair specimens of the whole work. Capt. Temple's remarks on the Orthography and Transliteration of Geographical names merits particular notice in reference to what is called the somewhat unscientific \"phonetic\" system. The numbers for April and May have followed, and are full of pleasant and instructive reading.\n\nIn an interesting notice of the *Report of the Operations of the Survey of India*, the Athen\u00e6um of July 16 remarks that had the native traveller known by the initials R. N. succeeded in his main object of gaining Gyala-Syndong, \"the lowest point yet reached on the Sanpou,\" and starting thence kept down the stream and reached India without crossing it, \"he would have been the most famous Asiatic explorer of the day.\" But while it was not R. N.'s good fortune to achieve such a triumph as this, he was still enabled to perform a useful and honest piece of work.\n\n*China.*\u2014The resolution of the Chinese Government to send a certain number of their civil servants to study Western lore in Western countries is a remarkable sign of the times in which we live. Each missioner, we learn from the *London and China Telegraph*, is to receive a salary a little over \u00a3500 a year, with an allowance of \u00a3125 a year for an interpreter and travelling expenses.\n\nProfessor Legge, in the Academy of the 9th July, when reviewing Mr. P. H. Balfour's *Leaves from my Chinese Scrap Book*, points to that writer's monograph of Ts'in Shih Hwang Ti, as \"the longest and most discriminating account that has yet appeared in English of this remarkable personage.\" The reviewer's estimate of this hero places him third in the list of Chinese conspicuous above all others by \"grand proportions and distinct personality.\" Y\u00fb the great is the first, and Confucius the second.\n\nThe two beautiful books on the Amoy Yearly Feasts, which have been translated into French and published under the authority of the Minister of Public Instruction as the 11th and 12th volumes of the *Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet*, are worthy pendants of a remarkable series. M. De Groot can hardly complain that justice has not been done him in this reproduction of his valuable work. Type, illustrations, paper\u2014all are unexceptionable. Perhaps the most palpable drawback to the English reader is that the familiar 'Amoy' is replaced by '\u00c9moui.' In showing cause for this, the author tells us in his preface that he might have been more accurate had he written \"E mung,\" and that some European maps have recorded the Mandarin pronunciation of \"Hia-mun.\"\n\nOf less bulk and substance, but attractive in its way, is an essay privately printed in Philadelphia by Mr. Stewart Curtin on \"The Religious Ceremonies of the Chinese in the Eastern Cities of\nthe United States.\" \"The first immigrants,\" we are told, \"uncertain whether the gods would still hear their prayers and protect them in this remote land, neglected even these observances; but as fortune favoured them, many in time erected a figure of their accustomed god, and paid it the usual honour, attributing to its influence some part of their success. . . . In the course of time, as the people made homes for themselves, some of their former many household gods were recognized.\"\n\nJapan.\u2014The Academy of the 6th August has an interesting and appreciative notice, by Mr. F. V. Dickins, of a volume published in the current year by the Imperial University of Tokyo, entitled, \"The Language, Mythology, and Geographical Nomenclature of Japan viewed in the light of Aino Studies, by Basil Hall Chamberlain, Professor of Philology in the Imperial University, including an Aino Grammar by John Batchelor, Church Missionary Society.\" Dr. Cust thus records his opinion of the work:\u2014\"The first part of the subject is ably treated in the first seventy-five pages, and I leave it to others to comment upon it. My task is to draw attention to the Aino Grammar by Mr. Batchelor: it is indeed an addition to Linguistic Science of the highest importance. In the Northernmost Island of the Japanese Group, Yezo, the Aino tribe, who were the aborigines, have still survived in considerable numbers, and are totally distinct from the more numerous and conquering people known as the Japanese. The chief town is Hakodati, and the Missionaries labour from this point. A portion of the Scripture has been translated, and now the Missionary has supplied a Grammar and a Vocabulary. The language belongs to the agglutinative class: it has neither gender, nor grammatical inflections, and the relation of words to each other is indicated by suffixes. The verbs have but one mood, the indicative: all varieties of moods or tense are indicated by auxiliary words. Postpositions take the place of Prepositions and Conjunctions. As regards Syntax, the subject of the verb is always placed at the beginning of the sentence, the verb at the end, and the object immediately before the verb, and the genitive precedes the noun which it qualifies. Some Texts are given to illustrate the Grammar. It is a most satisfactory work, and when it is recollected that it was printed at Tokio, we may well rejoice in the signs of progress in Japan.\"\n\nEgyptology.\u2014The Academy is rich, as usual, in Egyptian data. June 4 has a letter from Mr. Flinders Petrie stating that he had discovered way-marks on the ancient road from Memphis, across the desert, to the Faiyum; also, that on visiting the supposed site of Kanobos, west of Abukir, he had found \"a large site of rock-cut baths in the sea,\" and \"pieces of two granite colossi, and two large sandstone sphinxes thrown into the sea to form a breakwater.\" One of the sphinxes bore the name of a Psammetichos. M. Edward Naville, on July 2, has a long account of nine recent explorations, winding up with an expression of belief that \"we may expect important results from a complete excavation of the temple of\nBubastis, of which we have cleared only about one-third.\u201d July 9 contains a letter from Professor Hirschfeld at K\u00f6nigsberg confirming his view against that of Mr. Gardner that there was no Greek town of Naukratis before the time of Amasis. In July 16, both Mr. Gardner and Mr. Flinders Petrie continue the discussion, ranging themselves on the opposite side of the question. August 6 brings a letter from Professor Sayce as a fresh contribution to the evidence adduced; and Professor Hirschfeld publishes a courteous rejoinder to M.M. Gardner and Petrie on August 20. \u201cIt will perhaps be of use,\u201d he says, to \u201crenew the discussion after the results from Daphnae have been published;\u201d and he is \u201cglad to learn that this will be accomplished with the same promptitude which has already, in the case of Naukratis, won for Mr. Petrie the heartiest thanks of every scholar.\u201d There has been going on for some days in Oxford Mansions a so-called \u201cExhibition of Minor Antiquities\u201d in connection with the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund. On Miss Edwardes\u2019 high authority (see Academy of 13th August), \u201cthose who are interested in flint implements and pottery\u201d are informed that a visit to this quarter will reward them more or less for the trouble involved.\n\nSome interesting papers on Egyptian exploration have appeared lately in the Times, and added to the universally-recognized value of its many columns. One in the issue of August 22, commencing with the statement that Professor Maspero \u201chas laid down the itinerary and topography of the Egyptian Inferno with a circumstantiality that is positively startling,\u201d proceeds to an elaborate analysis of the question mooted. While to the initiated the article will not be unattractive\u2014to the uninitiated it will be instructive and pleasant reading, affording a curious insight into the beliefs of an ancient people.\n\nM. Am\u00e9lineau has published separately the thirteenth century Coptic MS. of the Martyre de Jean de Phanidjoit, mentioned in the last Notes of the Quarter as among the contents of the Journal Asiatique for February and March last. He has also made more generally known, by republishing in pamphlet form, his \u201c\u00c9tude Historique sur Saint Pachome,\u201d heretofore confined to the pages of the \u201cBulletin de l\u2019Institut Egyptien.\u201d Saint Pakh\u014dm or Pakh\u014dn of the Coptic Kalendar was the founder of the C\u00e6nobia, and called the father of the C\u00e6nobites. We read in the Rev. Mr. Malan\u2019s translation of the Arabic Notes of the Coptic Church that he wrote \u201cFifty Rules or Precepts for a Monastic Life,\u201d given in Patres Egypti, p. 9, n. 8, ed. Migne.\n\nIn announcing that he has undertaken the preparation of a history of Christian Egypt, M. Am\u00e9lineau explains the process by which he has attained the necessary knowledge and experience for so important a work. The materials which he has been enabled to collect during his residence in the country are such as throw much new light on the state of its Christian inhabitants, from the period of Diocletian (A.D. 284) to the thirteenth century. Indepen-\ndensity of these, he has taken copies of all Coptic and Arabic MSS., bearing upon this particular subject in various public and private libraries of Europe, sufficient in themselves to fill many large-sized volumes. M. Am\u00e9lineau has already drawn attention to the fact that many Coptic documents, lost in the original language, have been preserved in Arabic translations, made at the time that Coptic fell into disuse as a spoken language, to be superseded by Arabic. He proposes to render his excerpta faithfully into French for the benefit of students; each volume of collections being supplemented by a critical review of the data supplied, written without prejudice or partiality. His own private conclusions will be quite a separate affair, which he reserves to himself the right of expressing in such form as he thinks fit.\n\nThe French Government will lend its aid to the proposed publication, and has furnished the requisite funds for defraying the cost of the first volume (to appear in the course of October), but the subvention will, it is believed, be insufficient to cover the whole expenditure necessitated. An appeal is therefore addressed to learned Societies to secure, by means of a subscription list, completion of the author's labours. The work will be costly, and the price of each volume will depend upon the number of its pages. One volume will appear every year.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014M. A. de Barth\u00e9lemy's short but suggestive notice, in the Revue Critique of June 27, of M. Th\u00e9odore Reinach's \"Essai dans la Numismatique des Rois de Cappadoce,\" designates the work to be a new and eloquent testimony in favour of those data which \"Archaeology supplies for the completion, and often rectification, of classical texts,\" and, moreover, a fresh argument in support of the writer's own proposition that historians and archaeologists can, of themselves, \"render but very imperfect service.\" According to the reviewer, M. Reinach examines successively the state of Kappadocia under the Persian rule (B.C. 546-333), the respective dynasties of the Ariarathes (333-100), and the Ariobarzanes (96-36), and Archelaus, placed on the throne by Mark Antony (36-17). The Persian period he finds illustrated only by a drachma coined at Sinope, and bearing the name of Datames. Now, the best numismatic authorities hold this personage to be the son of Kamissares, Governor of Kappadocia under Artaxerxes II.; but the concise character of the texts does not allow him to accept the fact as indisputable. On the other hand, he writes, \"la s\u00e9rie des Ariarathes et celle des Ariobarzanes est class\u00e9e avec une m\u00e9thode et une critique qui ne laissent rien \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer; la foliation des types, l'examen scrupuleux des surnoms pris par chacun de ces rois homonymes, tout concourt \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que M. R. n'a rien avanc\u00e9 sans \u00eatre \u00e0 m\u00eame de fournir des preuves \u00e0 l'appui de son syst\u00e8me de classification.\"\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014At a sitting of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres on the 29th July, M. J. Halevy made some observations on the word adl\u00e1n, which occurs in the lately discovered\nepitaph on King Tabnit. The passage runs thus:\u2014\"Do not open my sepulchral chamber, nor disturb me, for there is neither an adl\u00e1n of silver, nor yet of gold, nor any treasure whatever.\" \u0395\u1f30\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd in Greek (image) was thought to be the word intended. At the same meeting, the same gentleman had something to say on the origin of the Phoenician letter th\u00e9ti. According to M. de Roug\u00e9, the Phoenicians had borrowed from the Egyptians the 22 letters of their alphabet. M. Halevy, on the other hand\u2014holding the theory that they had only borrowed from them 12 or 13, making up the remainder by adding a diacritical sign to, or otherwise modifying some of these\u2014showed that the letter th\u00e9ti was a combination of two others\u2014the tav and ain.\n\nMiscellaneous.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of July 16 has a criticism of Mr. Arthur Lillie's Buddhism in Christendom. The chapters on ritual and observances, it remarks, are rendered attractive by a number of interesting illustrations.\n\nA volume just published by Messrs. Whittingham, under the title \"Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,\" merits the close attention of those who are sceptical as to the successful results of culture on the African mind. Dr. Blyden, its author, is, it is true, in respect of literary distinction, one of a million; but he shows us in his writings that there are a sufficient number of his fellow-countrymen (in the widest sense of the word) to prove the Negro capable of attaining the higher degrees of civilization. It is to the general tone of the papers put together, of which there are fifteen, exclusive of the Preface and interesting Biographical Note in this book, rather than to the literary composition\u2014however able this may be\u2014that the reader's attention should be drawn.\n\nIn the Oxford \"Examination Statutes\" for the Degrees of Bachelor of Arts, of Music, of Civil Law, and of Medicine, revised to Trinity Term of the present year, it is provided that there shall be two examinations in the Honour School of Oriental studies:\u2014an examination in Indian studies, and an examination in Semitic studies.

Provision is also made for History, general and literary, and special subjects.\n\nVI. NOTES CONTRIBUTED BY THE HON. SECRETARY.\n\nAfrica.\u2014Vocabulary of \"Kavirondo,\" S.P.C.K., 1887.\u2014This tribe occupies the East shore of Victoria Nyanza, in Eastern Africa on the Equator. They are a Negro tribe, and the only one that has pushed down so far South as the Equator: all the tribes South of the Equator belong to the Bantu Family. The Rev. Mr. Wakefield, of the United Methodist Mission at Mombasa, collected this Vocabulary from a Merchant, and forwarded it to the Hon. Secretary of this Society. As the tribe has been lately visited by Joseph Thomson and Bishop Hannington, it has been thought expedient to publish it.\n\nVocabularies of the Hadendoa and Beni Amir, S.P.C.K., 1887.\u2014Major Watson of the Royal Engineers (Watson Pasha), while at Suakim, collected a Vocabulary of the two above-mentioned Dialects, and entered them in the Model Vocabulary Forms, which the Honorary Secretary had sent out to him. They are now being published by the S.P.C.K. The Hadendoa is a Dialect of the Bishari language, of the Hamitic Group (see page 126 of Cust's Modern Languages of Africa, 1883). The Bani Amir are wrongly entered as a Dialect of the same language, but the Vocabulary shows that the language is Semitic, and akin to the Tigre of Abyssinia.\n\nArab Tales in the Tugulo Dialect of the Makua Language, Mozambik, East Africa, by Daniel Rankin, Acting British Consul, Mozambik, S.P.C.K., 1887.\u2014These are very interesting and original specimens of this previously totally unknown dialect of the Makua Language; they were collected by the very intelligent acting British Consul, and forwarded to the Hon. Secretary, with a letter explaining their nature. The tales have been published by the S.P.C.K., and some comparative Vocabularies.\n\nOceania.\u2014Melanesia.\u2014One of the languages spoken in the Isabel Island of the Solomon Group is the Bogitu. The English Melanesian Mission have prepared a translation of Mark in this language, and it is published by the S.P.C.K., and is interesting as a genuine specimen of this language.\n\nGrammar and Vocabulary of Language spoken by the Motu Tribe, New Guinea, by the Rev. W. G. Lawes, with Introduction, by Rev. George Pratt. Sydney, Government Printer, 1885. London, Tr\u00fcbner & Co.\u2014This is one of the first fruits of the noble attempt to evangelize the British portion of New Guinea by the London Missionary Society. The names of Murray and Macfarlane, of Lawes and Chalmers, are known to all. From the Fly River to the extreme point of the Island there are upwards of twenty-five\nlanguages, or dialects of languages, spoken by the numerous tribes, or sections of tribes, which have pressed down from the unknown interior to the coast; they are all savage Pagans, but not unfriendly. These languages belong to the Melanesian Group with certain Polynesian affinities: totally without literature or written character. Mr. Lawes had seven years' residence among the people, to teach him the language of this important tribe, which lives near to Port Moresby, and he has translated a portion of the New Testament, which was printed by the British and Foreign Bible Society. It is of such importance that the officials appointed to carry out the Protectorate should understand this leading language, which no doubt will become the lingua franca of the South Coast, that Mr. Lawes deserves the thanks of the Government. He promises, on his return to the scene of his benevolent labour, a Comparative Grammar, and Collective Vocabulary of all the forms of speech spoken in the districts influenced by his Mission Stations. Attached to this Grammar is an English-Motu and Motu-English Vocabulary, of considerable length. It is an excellent book, and reflects credit on the Australian publisher.\n\nAsia. \u2014 Indo-Chinese Peninsula. \u2014 Cambodia. \u2014 Dictionnaire Stieng; Recueil de 2500 Mots Fait \u00e0 Brolam en 1865 par H. Az\u00e9mar, Missionnaire, Saigon, 1887.\u2014In the valley of the great Mekong, in Cambodia, are a great many wild tribes, of whose language little is known. Among them are the Stieng, and a French Roman Catholic Mission has been established in their midst for more than a quarter of a century. Their existence is noticed in the travels of Garnier and Bastian. M. Az\u00e9mar was one of those Missionaries, who settled at Brolam in 1861, and left in 1866. He dwelt quite alone among the people, and picked up their language, and compiled this Vocabulary in the French language, which, accompanied by a full description of the tribe, has been published by the French Colonial Government of Cochin-China, and a copy has found its way to the Library of the Royal Geographical Society. It is a very creditable performance.\n\nLa Societ\u00e0 Asiatica Italiana.\u2014We welcome the appearance of the first volume of the Journal\u00b9 of the Italian Asiatic Society, published at Florence. Its President, Count Angelo di Gubernatis, had lately visited India, and on his return conceived the idea of an Italian Asiatic Society and an Indian Museum. The King of Italy accepted the office of Patron, and in His Majesty's presence both Institutions were opened, and the President delivered his first address. Some of the most distinguished scholars of Europe and America have accepted the office of Honorary Members. The Society held its first Annual Meeting in May of this year. The Journal consists of 153 pages, of which 88 are devoted to 9 original communications on a great variety of Asiatic subjects, and 68 to Notices of 13 works in different languages of Europe. The account\n\n\u00b9 See ante, p. 699.\nof the res gestae of the Society occupy 39 pages in addition to the above. The whole is in the Italian language, and there are no illustrations. The Universities of Italy are numerous, some might say, too numerous, and the Professors are numerous, and the chief support of the Society must come from that quarter, as Italy has as yet no intimate relations with or a single colony or dependency in Asia. The names of some Italian scholars have a wide repute, Amari, Ascoli, Gorresio, Teza, and Di Gubernatis, all of whom have published noteworthy works. It might have been wiser to have established the Society at Rome, as the rivalry of illustrious cities is one of the causes of weakness of Italy.\n\n**Progress of Work of Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Languages of Asia, Africa and Oceania.**\n\n*Japan.\u2014Ainu.*\u2014The Committee have published at Tokyo a tentative edition of 250 copies of nine chapters of the Gospel of St. Matthew. The remainder of the Gospel has now been translated, and a complete edition will be published for circulation. The translation was made by the Rev. J. Batchelor (C.M.S.), of Hakodate, Japan. He is the only foreigner who understands the language, and there is no native Ainu, who can speak English. The translation has been made from the Greek by the aid of the English Revised Version, and the few Ainu, who have been taught to read have gone over the translations made by Mr. Batchelor, and thus contributed to the idiomatic accuracy of the version.\n\n*Oceania.\u2014Api or Baki.*\u2014The Gospel of St. Mark, translated by the Rev. Rule Fraser, of the Presbyterian Church of Tasmania, and printed by the New South Wales Auxiliary, is now in the hands of the people. The Rev. Dr. Steel, of Sydney, Agent of the New Hebrides Mission, read the proofs and edited the version.\n\n*India.\u2014Badaga.*\u2014At the request of the Rev. J. Knobloch, of the Basel Mission, of the Madras Auxiliary to this Society, has agreed to publish an edition of the Gospel of St. Luke for the tribe of Badaga, who inhabit the Nilgiri Hills, and number about 24,000. The version will be prepared by the Rev. W. Lutz, who will take as the basis of his revision a translation prepared and lithographed in 1852.\n\n*Oceania.\u2014Duke of York Island.*\u2014The Committee have authorized the Sydney Auxiliary to publish an edition of the Gospel of St. Matthew and of the Acts of the Apostles, prepared under the auspices of the Australasian Wesleyan Missionary Society.\n\n*Oceania.\u2014Fat\u00e9.*\u2014The Gospel of St. John, translated by the Rev. J. Cosh, and revised by the Rev. J. W. Mackenzie, is now in the hands of the people, who have refunded to the Society the cost of its production. The Rev. Dr. Macdonald, of Havannah Harbour, hopes that the New Testament, completed by Mr. Mackenzie and himself, will be ready for the press during this year. The translators have agreed to render the New Testament into the most\nimportant dialect of Fat\u00e9, trusting that the version will be sufficient for the whole island, and the surrounding islets.\n\nAfrica.\u2014\u00c9w\u00e9.\u2014At the request of the North German Missionary Society, the Committee have agreed to publish an edition of 1500 copies of the Books of Isaiah and Jeremiah. The version was made by the Rev. T. Merz, formerly a Missionary on the Gold Coast. He has revised his translation by the help of an \u00c9w\u00e9 student now in Germany; and the Rev. Pastor Binder has also revised the version, assisted by two \u00c9w\u00e9 students, who are being educated by him in Germany.\n\nAfrica (Ashanti).\u2014Fanti.\u2014The printing of the Four Gospels progresses slowly, owing to the time lost in sending proofs to Cape Coast. Meanwhile a Bible Revision Committee has been formed at Cape Coast, consisting of ministers and laymen, who meet once a week. They are now engaged on the Book of Genesis, which they hope to complete in about a year.\n\nChina.\u2014Fuh-chow Vernacular (Roman Character).\u2014The reception given to his version of the Gospel of St. John has encouraged the Rev. R. W. Stewart, of the Church Missionary Society, to continue the translation of the New Testament, and the Committee have resolved to continue the publication of the version.\n\nAfrica.\u2014Gogo.\u2014The Committee have published an edition of 500 copies of the Rev. J. C. Price\u2019s version of the Gospel of St. Luke. The language is closely allied to the Kagiru, but sufficiently distinct to render Last\u2019s Kagiru version useless among the Wa-Gogo. Mr. Price\u2019s translation was made from the Greek, by the help of the English Revised Version, and Rebman\u2019s Swahili version. They number about 100,000. They inhabit the region between the U-Nyamwezi district on the West, and that of the U-Sag\u00e1ra on the East. They are bounded on the North by the Masai country. The rendering follows, with slight exceptions, Steere\u2019s system of orthography.\n\nGuyardti.\u2014The Committee have completed the final revision of the last 19 chapters of the Gospel of St. Luke, the Gospel of St. John, the Acts of the Apostles, and eight chapters of the Epistle to the Romans.\n\nIndia.\u2014Hindi.\u2014The Revision Committee have completed the four Gospels, and revised a part of the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nHindustani (Dakhani).\u2014The Rev. M. G. Goldsmith, of the Church Missionary Society, completed his revision of the Gospel of St. Matthew in 1885. When the portion was revised by the Delegates, it was sent to the lithographer to be photographed. The Gospels of St. Luke and St. John have also been revised, and that of St. Matthew is now being proceeded with. An edition of Genesis and Exodus was passed through the press in December, 1885. The brethren are aiming at a thoroughly idiomatic South Indian, which differs considerably from North Indian Urdu.\n\nJapan.\u2014Japanese.\u2014The version of the Old Testament is now approaching completion. The work has been carried out by the\nRev. P. K. Fyson, and Drs. Hepburn and Verbeck, the three translators appointed by the Permanent Committee. In February, 1886, Mr. Fyson reported that the Books of Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Daniel, translated by Dr. Hepburn, had been published. Dr. Hepburn had also translated Hosea, Joel, Amos, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zachariah. Dr. Verbeck continued his translations of the Psalms in addition to his revision work. Mr. Fyson translated 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and worked with Dr. Verbeck on the Revision Committee. During the past year Dr. Verbeck has continued at work on the Psalms, and assisted in the revision of other Books. Dr. Hepburn has translated Esther, Job, and the Song of Solomon, and taken part in revision, and Mr. Fyson, in addition to revision work, has completed his version of Isaiah. During the year the Books of Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and Zechariah have been published.\n\nIndian Archipelago.\u2014Javanese.\u2014The Rev. P. Jansz\u2019s version of the Gospel of St. Luke has been published and favourably received, and the Committee have authorized Mr. Jansz to complete the New Testament. As Mr. Jansz has already made extensive preparations, it is expected that the work will be finished in a year.\n\nAfrica.\u2014Xosa alias Kufir.\u2014The revision of the Bible has been completed, and the Committee have agreed to publish a new edition of 3000 copies, similar to the old 8vo. edition in type, page, and size, the verses to be numbered and the paragraphs to be marked by breaks. The poetical parts are to be printed in verse form.\n\nCentral Asia.\u2014Kalmuk.\u2014Professor Pozdnejeff has completed his version of the Four Gospels after six years of incessant labour. An edition of 4000 copies, with 1000 copies additional of each Gospel, has been published under the editorial care of the translator. The version was produced in the following manner. Professor Pozdnejeff first made draft translations of the Gospels. These he sent to Archimandrite Smirnoff, in Astrakhan, for revision. When Professor Pozdnejeff had collated M. Smirnoff\u2019s criticisms, he proceeded to the steppes to test the translation by reading it to the Kalmuks. In this way he was able to conform his version to the style understood by the people, and to acquire information for further translation. Professor Pozdnejeff made three journeys to the steppes for the purpose of testing his work. On his return home he carefully revised the translation once more, and prepared copy for the press. The Committee have arranged with Professor Pozdnejeff for the completion of the New Testament, and for this purpose he proposes to make two journeys to the Kalmuk steppes. On the death of Archimandrite Smirnoff, Professor Pozdnejeff employed as his assistant M. D. Kutusoff, a native Kalmuk, now Lector in the St. Petersburg University. M. Kutusoff, who has completed his studies in the Imperial Medico-Surgical Academy,\nspent four years in Mongolia, and is acquainted with the literary language of the Mongols, and Professor Pozdnejeff considers his services of special value.\n\n**Russia.\u2014Kaz\u00e1n-Turki.**\u2014The Gospel of St. Mark, translated and edited by M. Saleman, is now completed, and will be immediately circulated among the people for whom it is intended in Kaz\u00e1n and elsewhere. M. Saleman will proceed with the translation of the remaining two Gospels, St. Luke and St. John.\n\n**Central Asia.\u2014Kirghiz-Turki.**\u2014The printing of the third edition of the New Testament, revised by Dr. Gottwald, at the Kaz\u00e1n University Press, under the care of M. Saleman, proceeds slowly. The Rev. W. Nicolson reports that thirty sheets out of forty-two have been printed.\n\n**India.\u2014Konkani.**\u2014The Madras Auxiliary are taking steps for the formation of a Committee to revise the Gospels of St. Mark and St. Luke, already printed, and to prepare other portions of the New Testament for the press.\n\n**Caucasus.\u2014Kumuk (Turki).**\u2014The publication of the Gospel of St. Matthew has been delayed owing to the discovery of a few typographical mistakes. The version is being re-examined by Dr. Sauerwein and M. Amirkhaniantz, and will be issued immediately.\n\n**Oceania.\u2014Lifu.**\u2014The revision of the Bible has been brought to a close, and at the request of the Mission, the Committee have agreed to publish an edition of 4000 copies, the type and general style to be similar to that of the Samoan Bible.\n\n**U-Ganda.**\u2014The Rev. R. P. Ashe, on his return from U-Ganda, brought with him the first thirteen chapters of the Gospel of St. Matthew, translated by himself and the Rev. Mr. Mackay, and printed by their Mission press at U-Ganda. The version has been tested by the natives and re-revised, and the Committee agreed to print a tentative edition of 250 copies. Later news from U-Ganda reports that Mr. Mackay is completing the translation, and the Committee have resolved to await the arrival of the remaining chapters of the Gospel with a view to printing (500 copies) of the complete Gospel.\n\n**Madagascar.\u2014Malag\u00e1si.**\u2014The revision of the Bible begun thirteen and a half years ago is now completed, and the Revision Committee has been dissolved. The first meeting was held in the house of Mr. William Johnson, of the Friends' Mission, on July 21, 1873. The last meeting was held in the Committee-room of the London Missionary Society, Madagascar, on April 30, 1887. Owing to the absence on furlough of the chief reviser for two and a half years, the time actually spent in revision was a little over eleven years. On May 2, two days after the completion of the revision, a thanksgiving service was held in the Memorial Church, attended by Missionaries, Native Pastors, and a large number of Christians. The Prime Minister was present with a special message of thanks from Queen Ranavalona III., and this he delivered with his own\nNursery of the Church.\n\nIn conclusion, we may well reflect upon the thirty-eight years before us, during which we have labored for the advancement of the kingdom of God in India. We have been blessed by the grace of God.\n\nIndia.\u2014The Bible Society Committee met last September. They discussed the question of the translation of the New Testament. The committee agreed to continue the work of the Rev. Archdeacon K. Kishin as far as the funds would allow, and to extend the distribution among the believers in India. The committee also discussed the translation of the Gospel of St. John into Hindi. The committee has approved the translation, and arrangements have been made for the publication of the book.\n\nNew Zealand.\u2014The printing of the revised Bible has been completed and sent to the press. First proofs are now being read by Mr. Charles Macdonald in New Zealand, and Mr. Carleton of Upper Hutt, New Zealand, will be asked to see that the Archbishop's corrections are incorporated into the text.\n\nIndia.\u2014The revised Book of Genesis has been approved and accepted by the Marathi Translation Committee. It is now being printed. The committee has been instructed to proceed with the translation of the Revised Version of the Bible under the supervision of the Rev. Baha Palmezji and the Rev. J. E. Andrews.\n\nIndia.\u2014Madras Auxiliary.\u2014The Madras Auxiliary have resolved to revise and publish a new edition of the Gospel of St. Matthew.\n\nOman.\u2014Young.\u2014The Rev. P.

He has returned to England with his MS., and the Committee are taking steps to have the whole finally revised with a view to publication.\n\nAfrica.\u2014Popo Dahomey.\u2014In addition to the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark, which are now passing through the press, the Popo Translation Committee at Lagos have completed the translation of the Book of Psalms, the Gospels of St. Luke and\nSt. John, and the Acts, and these portions are now being revised and copied with a view to immediate publication.\n\nIndia.\u2014Rajmah\u00e1li, alias Pah\u00e1ri (Maler or Malto).\u2014The Rev. Ernest Droese has translated the Psalms, the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark, and the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nOceania.\u2014Rarotonga.\u2014The Rev. W. Wyatt Gill has returned to England with the MS. of the revised Bible, and is now editing for the Committee an 8vo. edition of 4000 copies. As the text is now considered to be settled, stereotype plates of the edition are being prepared.\n\nMorocco.\u2014Riff (dialect of Shilha).\u2014Mr. William Mackintosh, the Society\u2019s agent at Tangiers, has completed his version of the Gospel of St. Matthew, and the Committee have published an edition of 500 copies.\n\nOceania.\u2014Samoa.\u2014The Rev.

The edition will be made up of the portion of the New Testament completed by the Revision Committee and Mr. Cole\u2019s translation of the rest unrevised by the Committee. It is intended to meet the demand for the Book, until the version now being prepared by the Rev. F. T. Cole and the Santali Revision Committee is ready.\n\nSantal (Beng\u00e1li Character).\u2014The Calcutta Auxiliary published an edition of 1000 copies of the Gospel of St. Luke, prepared and edited by Mr. Cole.\n\nAfrica.\u2014Suto.\u2014A few corrections are being made by the Rev.

Wallis, of the Universities\u2019 Mission, has been completed.\n\nIndia.\u2014Telugu.\u2014The translation of the remaining books of the Old Testament has been retarded by the serious illness of Dr. Hay. During the year the Book of Isaiah has been translated, the Book of Psalms has been revised, and the Books of Judges, Joshua and Ruth have been printed. Dr. Hay is now translating the Book of Jeremiah. The work has sustained a loss in the sudden death of the Rev. M. Ratnam, one of the oldest members of the Revision Committee.\n\nCaucasus.\u2014Transcaucasian-Turki.\u2014The printing of the Bible has been begun at Leipzig. Proofs are being read by the Rev. A.

Hartmann is working on the four Gospels while on furlough. Catechist Obed has finished the Acts of the Apostles. Messrs. Ritter and Ott, assisted by competent native scholars, are engaged on the Epistles.\n\nUrdu (Arabic Character).\u2014The Committee have published an edition of the Bible under the superintendence of Dr. Weitbrecht, assisted by a native Urdu scholar. It was found undesirable to carry out the changes announced last year, and the new edition may be considered an interim reprint, with palpable mistakes and typographical errors corrected.\n\nUriya.\u2014Last year the Committee agreed to bring out an edition of 2500 copies of the Old Testament, revised and edited by the lamented Dr. Buckley, of the Baptist Mission at Cuttack. Dr. Buckley was carrying on the revision with his usual energy, and had completed the work up to the 83rd Psalm, when he was suddenly called to rest. Dr. Buckley had already edited one edition of the Old Testament.\n\nCentral Asia.\u2014Uzbek-Turki.\u2014The printing of the Four Gospels, translated by M. Ostroumoff, has been begun.

Ostroumoff, is expected to become the chief language of Central Asia.\n\nAfrica.\u2014Yao.\u2014The version of the Scriptures begun by Archdeacon Maples, of the Universities\u2019 Mission, is being continued by the Missionaries of the Established Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The Gospel of St. Matthew was translated and edited by Archdeacon Maples. The remaining Gospels and the Acts have been translated by the Scotch Missionaries of Blantyre and Livingstonia.\n\nYoruba.\u2014The first edition of the New Testament being almost exhausted, a Revision Committee, in which the Wesleyan Missionaries have joined the Church Missionary Society Missionaries, has been formed to revise the New Testament, with a view to the publication of an edition of 10,000 copies, same size and type as the present edition. The four Gospels have already been revised. Proofs of the new edition will be read at Lagos.\n\nVII. Special Committee, Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe statement and papers published under this head in the \u201cNotes\u201d of the April number of the Journal (pp. 342-349) are incomplete without the report of the Committee\u2014of which they were the mere Appendices; it has now been considered advisable to add this document also. That it was withheld at all must be attributed to the circumstance that the papers were referred back by the Council for further information on certain points\u2014a step which would\nentail modification. But such reference having been shown to involve amplification only, without retractation, there appears no further reason to withhold publication of the first approved draft:\n\nReport of Committee appointed under the Resolutions of Council, dated 1st March and 10th May, 1886.\u2014The Committee appointed to consider the best means for the promotion of Oriental Studies in England, and rendering the work of the Society more popular, beg to report as follows on the several heads of inquiry indicated to them:\n\nI. In reference to the first head\u2014\"Preparation of a list of appointments in England, in Government Establishments, Universities and Colleges, and other Institutions for which a scholarly acquaintance with Oriental Languages is a necessary or important qualification, with the emoluments of each and the mode of appointment\"\u2014the Committee have prepared from the best information at their command a list of such appointments, together with a statement of the emoluments attached and mode of appointment; and a column has been added giving, where known, the name and designation of the present holder; they have also given a list of similar appointments in India open to Europeans.\n\nIt will be seen from these lists that, excluding those for which a knowledge of Hebrew only is required, the number of permanent salaried appointments in the United Kingdom is about twenty-nine, the salaries ranging from \u00a350 to \u00a31000 per annum. In India there are ninety-eight Government appointments open to Europeans, with salaries ranging from 250 to 2450 rupees per mensem, for which a knowledge of Oriental languages and literature is either essential or a very important qualification. These appointments include 14 Professorships of Oriental Languages, 45 Headships of Colleges and Schools, 32 Educational Inspectorships, and 7 Directorships of Public Instruction, and all\u2014with the exception of 8 Professorships and 2 Inspectorships\u2014are at present held by Europeans.\n\nBesides the appointments referred to above, there are, in the United Kingdom, Professorships at King's and University College, London, minor College Tutorships at Oxford and Cambridge, Examinerships in connection with Indian Civil Service competitions,\n\n1 The Committee consisted of the following Members of the Council R.A.S.: Gen. R. MacIagan, R.E. (Chairman); Messrs. Bendall, Dickins, Kay, Thornton, the Hon. Secretary, and Secretary. Sir Monier Monier-Williams afterwards joined.\n\n2 See Appendix, page 348, J.R.A.S. for April, 1887.\nand temporary appointments in the British Museum, offering more or less remunerative employment to Orientalists. Again, in India, the Government offers to its Civil and Military servants handsome rewards for proficiency in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, and the languages of India, and success in the examinations for them not unfrequently leads to special advancement in the Service. Lastly, both in England and India, important work is being done, and much more remains to be done, in the editing and translation of Oriental texts, and in the preparation of dictionaries and grammars and other works relating to the history, antiquities, and languages of the East, while, judging from the periodical lists of Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and other Oriental publishers, the public interest in this class of literature is on the increase.\n\nThus the prospect of remunerative employment open to English Orientalists, at any rate in the case of Indian languages, appears less discouraging than is usually supposed. The field is vast, the labourers\u2014of British birth\u2014are few, and the demand is greater than the supply. Of the appointments contained in the lists twenty, including some of the most important, are at present held by foreign scholars, and to foreign scholars we are indebted for many English versions of Oriental texts, and some of the most important articles on Eastern subjects contained in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Of twenty-nine English Translations of the \"Sacred Books of the East,\" issued from the Clarendon Press, fourteen are by German scholars, and that of Al Ber\u00fani's great work on India is being made (partly at the expense of the Indian Government), not by an Englishman, but by Professor Sachau of Berlin.\n\nThe Committee believe that these facts\u2014that is, the opening for Orientalists and the extent to which England has to resort in Oriental subjects to foreign scholars\u2014are very little known, and that their publication may do something towards stimulating Oriental studies in this country. They recommend accordingly that the appended lists of appointments with names of present holders (after careful correction), be published in the Journal, together with these remarks (so far as they are approved of by the Council), and that all new appointments of like character created and all vacancies in appointments and changes of incumbency be notified from time to time in like manner.\n\nII. With regard to the second head\u2014\"The possibility of approaching the Government, the Universities, the City Companies, etc., for support in the promotion of Oriental studies\"\u2014\nthe Committee do not see their way to recommend an appeal to the Government either of the United Kingdom or of India for direct support in the shape of University or School Endowments, but they presume the Government of India will be ready in the future, as in the past, to aid and assist in the production of Oriental works of public interest and importance. To that Government we owe, *inter alia*, the publication of the text of the *Rig Veda*, the translation of the *Adi Granth*, and Jaeschke's Tibetan Dictionary; and it has liberally contributed to the cost of Professor Max M\u00fcller's series of \"Sacred Books of the East,\" of Dr. Badger's English-Arabic Dictionary, of Professor Geldner's *Zend-Avesta*, the text and translation of Al Ber\u00fani's \"India,\" the new Persian-English Dictionary by Professor Steingass, the English-Persian Dictionary by Wollaston, and the new edition of Professor Sir Monier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary.\n\nBut while they see no hopes of success in an appeal to Government for direct support, the Committee feel strongly that an attempt should be made to awaken a more active interest in the subject on the part of the governing bodies of Educational Institutions, and also on the part of the great London Companies, many of whom are already distinguished by the liberal aid they render to Science and Education. The Committee therefore recommend (i) that letters be addressed to the governing bodies of the principal Universities, Colleges, and Schools of the United Kingdom, inviting their assistance; suggesting, in the case of the University of Oxford, the carrying out of the measures proposed by the Hebdomadal Council in 1877 for advancing the study of Arabic, Syriac, Persian, and Ethiopic, and of the languages and antiquities of Assyria and Ancient Egypt; and, in the case of Colleges, the setting apart of one or more of their existing Fellowships for bestowal on Oriental scholars, and of Scholarships and Exhibitions for promising students of Eastern languages; and urging, in the case of Schools, the formation of classes for the elementary teaching of such languages and the offer of prizes for proficiency in them.\n\nThey recommend (ii.) that similar letters be addressed to certain of the City Companies asking their aid and support by the grant of funds for the establishment of new Fellowships, Scholarships and prizes in Colleges and Schools, or for the publication of Oriental texts and translations and other works of importance not likely to be immediately remunerative.\n\nThe grounds of the recommendations are more fully set forth in\na statement which accompanies,\\(^1\\) and it is suggested that a copy of the statement, if approved by the Council, might accompany the letters addressed to the various bodies indicated.\n\nIn the event of the response to the above communications being fairly favourable, an appeal might, the Committee think, be made to the chiefs, nobles and wealthier residents of India for the foundation of Scholarships at our Universities tenable to their fellow-countrymen.\n\nIII. As to the third head\u2014\u201cPossibility and expediency of amalgamating this Society with any other of kindred objects, and of reducing the scale of subscriptions now in force\u201d\u2014the Committee, after due inquiry, are not able to make any recommendation for the amalgamation of the Royal Asiatic Society with any other Society, with kindred objects. With regard to reduction of subscriptions, the case stands in this wise. There are at present 129 resident members paying three guineas per annum. A reduction in their rate of subscription from three guineas to two guineas\u2014which on many grounds is desirable\u2014will thus involve an immediate loss to the Society of 144 guineas, and it will require the addition of seventy-two new members to make good this loss. The majority of the Committee are not sanguine that this addition to the number of resident members will be soon obtained, but, meanwhile, the loss can be met, in part at least, from the annual surplus over expenses, which, the Secretary informs them, has latterly amounted to about \u00a3100. As the Committee are not unanimous as to the course to be pursued, they deem it best to leave the matter for the decision of the Council without making any specific recommendation. But, in the event of its being decided to retain the present rate of subscription, the Committee suggest that in special cases the subscription be remitted or reduced on the principles adopted at the meeting of Council on the 11th January, 1886.\n\nIV. With regard to head number four\u2014\u201cWhether the publication of Oriental works beyond the scope of the Journal should be undertaken\u201d\u2014the Committee do not doubt that the publication of Oriental texts or their translation might be legitimately taken up by the Royal Asiatic Society; but having regard to the fact that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are already engaged upon the work, and have in their professors of Oriental\n\n\\(^1\\) See pp. 344\u2013349, *J.R.A.S.* for April, 1887.\nlanguages a specially competent editorial staff, and that in London there is more than one enterprising firm of Oriental publishers, the Committee are not prepared to advise, for the present, at all events, the assumption of such work by the Society. Works likely to be soon remunerative may, in their opinion, well be left to the enterprise of existing agencies, while for the publication of important works less likely to be remunerative, we should, the Committee think, look, in the first instance, at any rate, to our Universities. Our Universities\u2014Oxford especially\u2014have already done good work in this respect, and aided, it may be, by the liberality of individuals and corporations, and, in special cases, from the revenues of India, may be willing to extend and systematize the Oriental department of their Presses. In doing so they would doubtless receive the hearty sympathy and co-operation of this Society, and would do much to realize the hope which underlies the recommendations under the second head\u2014that our Universities may become ere long centres of Oriental as well as of Western learning and research.\n\nV. In considering the last of the five subjects indicated to them\u2014that is to say, \"the best means of rendering the Society more popular,\"\u2014the Committee have had the advantage of a valuable paper of suggestions by Dr. R. N. Cust, the Hon. Secretary. After considering those suggestions, the Committee submit the following recommendations:\n\n(i) One important means of rendering the Society more popular is doubtless the improvement of the Journal. In this matter, the Committee are glad to state, action has already been taken, and most of Dr. Cust's suggestions have been carried out or anticipated by the Secretary of the Society, Sir Frederic Goldsmid. These improvements are all, more or less, embodied in a paper contained in the October number, and intended to form part of every succeeding issue, under the title of \"Notes of the Quarter,\" an introduction which, while it partakes of the character of Proceedings, will also aim at supplying such information gathered during the preceding three months as is likely to interest Oriental scholars and students. It should be remarked that arrangements are in contemplation, or in progress, by which the \"Notes\" may be rendered more complete and comprehensive than can be the case at present, owing to the deficiency of data and want of cooperation from without.\n\nThe Committee believe that the alterations and additions made\nwill add greatly to the interest and value of the Journal, and they recommend that they be approved by the Council.\n\n(ii) Another effectual means for attaining the object aimed at will be, they believe, the institution by the Society of occasional meetings or conversazioni at which Orientalists of eminence should be invited to deliver lectures describing in a popular style the position, progress or results of some branch of Oriental research.\n\n(iii) With the view of encouraging discussion at the ordinary meetings, and thus increasing their attractiveness, it is recommended that proofs of every paper about to be read be available at the time of the meeting, and for three days previously, at the rooms of the Society, and that the time allowed for reading the paper or extracts from it be ordinarily limited to half an hour.\n\n(iv) They recommend that members of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and of the branch Societies of Bombay, Madras, Ceylon, North China, Japan and Singapore, who may be temporarily in England, be not only admissible to meetings (as already provided by the rules), but have the use of the library and reading room.\n\n(v) Lastly, it is recommended that a Gold Medal be annually awarded by the Society in recognition of recent services in Oriental research or scholarship.\n\nPostscript.\n\nThe readers of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal will be glad to learn that Professor Sayce has forwarded a supplement to his valuable Memoir on the Vannie Inscriptions published some five years ago. This will appear in the January number.\nINDEX.\n\nAbe no Miushi, one of the suitors of the Lady Kaguya, and how he failed in the task imposed on him by her, 16-19.\n\nAbkhazian, vocabulary of, 146-156.\n\nAdi Granth, arrangement of the, 605.\n\nAddin, J.

WADE, K.C.B., VICE-PRESIDENT,\n\nIN THE CHAIR.\n\nOPENING ADDRESS, FROM THE PRESIDENT.\n\n(Read by the Honorary Secretary.)\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn unavoidable absence and under much bodily weakness, I write these few remarks as a meagre substitute for a Presidential Address, which I beg the Secretary to be kind enough to read to the Society.\n\nIt is a matter of deep regret to me that I am prevented by serious illness from doing for the last time my duties as President. That you should have placed me in this Chair two years ago may, as I am apt to think, not have been altogether judicious; but be that as it may, you then conferred on me the greatest honour that I have attained in life. And I shall, whilst I live, so regard the choice which placed me in the succession between Sir William Muir and Sir Thomas Wade, to say nothing of earlier illustrious predecessors; and glad I should have been to preside once more at this Annual\nMeeting, and at our Dinner, and to introduce to you formally my distinguished successor, Sir Thomas Wade.\n\nThere is much in the recent history of the Society that we can look upon with satisfaction. It has been to me a piece of good fortune that my Presidency has synchronized with the tenure of the Secretaryship by our esteemed friend, Sir Frederic Goldsmid; to his excellent service we are deeply indebted. Under his conduct both the Finances of the Society, by which we must in the present measure its prosperity, and the Journal of the Society, by which its value will be measured in future years, have made important advances.\n\nAs regards the financial position, our nett increase of Membership during the year now expiring amounts to 4 Resident and 19 Non-Resident; whilst our invested fund has once more reached the water-mark of \u00a31200, from which it began to sink 19 years ago.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe Journal again, in mass of matter, and in excellence of form, has continued to improve; whilst in regularity of issue it has made a great advance, though difficulties have still beset the attainment of perfection. If we cannot claim for its contents the high value which distinguished the Journal in its early years, yet there has been steady growth in that respect, and such papers as those by the officers of the Frontier Survey, illustrating the remains at B\u00e1mi\u00e1n, by Mr. Colborne Baber, on documents in a language of Formosa, and by Professor Terrien de Lacouperie in the prosecution of his learned researches on ancient and obscure developments of Oriental writing, will always be turned to as valuable.\n\nThat our matter on the whole does not come up to the standard of earlier days is due, I conceive, in a measure to the great multiplication of learned and scientific societies of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is but right, however, to state that if we compare our list with that of May, 1885\u2014two anniversaries ago\u2014while a present gain of 15 is shown in our Non-Residents, there is a decrease of 11 apparent in Resident Members. This is owing notably to the heavy death-roll of that year, and many retirements during the period succeeding the decease of the late Secretary, and prior to the instalment of his successor.\nMeeting, and at our Dinner, and to introduce to you formally my distinguished successor, Sir Thomas Wade.\n\nThere is much in the recent history of the Society that we can look upon with satisfaction.

It is due also no doubt to that decay or diminution in the pursuit of Oriental studies in this country, to which the Council of your Society has lately drawn prominent attention, and on which a special Committee which we appointed has reported. Not much as yet has resulted, even in the way of reply to the circular letters which we issued with the printed Report of that Committee; and I can only point to one such reply as encouraging, viz. that from the Hebdomadal Council at Oxford. Our action, if followed up by ourselves, may yet bear fruit. But I myself confess to a feeling that the decay which we lament has its origin in causes deeper than we can easily reach, and akin to changes which seem to be affecting English public character on sides more seriously touching the probabilities of our coming history than even the decay of zeal for Oriental learning in a nation which has been brought, in God's providence, to rule so wide an Oriental Empire.\n\nI turn from these vast considerations; but before I close these few paragraphs, I feel constrained to recur to the sad catalogue of losses which the Society has had to bear during the two years of my incumbency. In no equal space of time, I should think, since its foundation, have we had to count up such a list of the tallest flowers of our field cut down; a list embracing the names of Vaux, Phayre, Fergusson, Edward Thomas, Arthur Grote and Walter Elliot. It will be long I fear before such another list can be formed; but I trust our younger Members will do their best to promote its growth. With hearty gratitude to the Society, and especially to my colleagues in the Council, who have always given me such cordial support, and to my friend the Secretary, I now make over the Chair to Sir Thomas Wade.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 For further proceedings, in reference to the President's Address and subsequent Report, see Notes of the Quarter.\nREPORT.\n\nThe Council of the Royal Asiatic Society have to report that, since the last Anniversary Meeting held on Monday, May 17, 1886, there have been the following decrease in, and addition to, the numbers of the Society's Members.\n\nThey announce with regret the loss by death of seven Resident Members, viz.:\n\nSir William Andrew, C.I.E.\nJames Gibb, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E.\nArthur Grote, Esq.\nThe Venerable Archdeacon Harrison, M.A.\nThe Right Hon. the Earl of Iddesleigh, K.C.B.\nThe Rev.

DELMAR MORGAN.\nThe items that require notice are:\u20141st, Salaries, which this year are shown to amount to \u00a3232 15s. in excess of 1885. Explanation of the apparent discrepancy is to be found in the circumstance that in the second half of the latter year no Secretary's remuneration was debited in account. From Mr. Vaux's death in June, the Hon. Secretary, Mr. Cust, performed the duties gratuitously up to the 31st October, and the amount due for the two months (November and December) to the newly-appointed Secretary was only debited in 1886, in which year, moreover, a yearly allowance of \u00a360 to the Housekeeper also appears under this head. There is besides a sum of \u00a340 6s. 3d. in excess for printing the Journal, to be readily accounted for by the fact that, in 1886, we had four issues instead of three, as in 1885. No other point seems to need explanation: but it may be stated that the proceeds of the sale of the Journal for the current year promise to attain a higher figure than in 1885 or 1886.\n\nProceedings.\u2014The following papers have been read, or addresses delivered, at different Meetings of the Society since the last Anniversary (May 17):\n\n1.

Time will, however, be required to give full effect to the significance and intent of this division of the Journal.\n\nSpecial Sub-Committee.\u2014In the President's Address of May last, mention was made of a Special Committee appointed to investigate the causes of decline in the prosecution of Oriental studies which had become apparent in England. The Proceedings of this Committee have, after many sittings, been recently brought to a close, and the character of the record is such as to certify that something has been done, not only in the investigation of an actual state of things, but also towards the revival of a languishing department of knowledge. The Statement and Appendices published at the close of the Quarterly Notes in the last number of the Journal show much of the nature and extent of the enquiries carried out, but it may be interesting to readers of these papers to learn that the appeal made by the Council to particular individuals and\nbodies, in accordance with the Committee's recommendation, has resulted in 31 replies, which may thus be summarised:\n\n1 from the Chancellor of the University of Oxford.\n3 ,, the Colleges of Oxford.\n4 ,, the Colleges of Cambridge.\n3 ,, the Universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dublin.\n11 ,, Miscellaneous Colleges and Schools.\n4 ,, Miscellaneous Societies and Institutions.\n5 ,, City Companies.\n\nIn all 31\n\nNone of these demand a more special allusion than already contained in the President's Address, with the exception of one just received by Sir Henry Rawlinson from the Merchant Taylors' Company, transmitting a donation of ten guineas\u2014a sum which will at once be set aside as the first item of a fund to be devoted to the cause advocated, in such practical form as shall hereafter be decided.\n\nThe following list of Council and Officers for the ensuing year is submitted for approval:\n\nPresident.\u2014Sir Thomas F.
