Even in the state in which it is here presented the work can hardly fail to provoke interest. The history of the poem makes it worthy of perusal, for it has been in a unique manner the book of a nation for seven hundred years; down to our own days the young people learned it by heart; every woman was expected to know every word of it, and on her marriage to carry a copy of it to her new home. Such veneration shown for so long a period proves that the story of the Panther-clad Knight presents an image of the Georgian outlook on life, and justifies the presumption that merits tested by the experience of a quarter of a million days, most of them troublous, may be apparent to other races, that such a book may be of value to mankind, and chiefly to those peoples which, like the Georgian, came under the influence of Greek and Christian ideals. Here we are dealing with no alien psychology, but with a soul which, though readily responsive to the great cultural movements of nearer Asia,\\(^1\\) showed in a thousand years of struggle that its natural gravitation was towards Western Europe, whither with pathetic constancy it kept its gaze fixed.\\(^2\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Professor Marr (t. xii., p. liv), points out that, while Georgian religious poetry was influenced by Byzantium, the secular poetry was closely akin to Iranic Islam; in the T'hamaran age the currents were distinctly apart, but later the two streams united.\n\n\\(^2\\) M. Tamarati, *L'\u00c9glise G\u00e9orgienne*, Rome, 1910 (ch. xiv.-xvi.); and original documents (Latin, French, Italian) in his *Istoria Catholicobisa*, Tiflis, 1902 (pp. 563-836).\nthe East and Iberia of the West, the high-water marks of Arab conquest, were both fertilized by the Semitic flood, and, whether or not they have some ancient ethnic affinity, this has given them not a few common characteristics; Spain had Christendom at her back, Georgia carried on her glorious crusade in isolation till the struggle was hopeless, and a century ago she was forced into an alliance with the Russian Empire. From her situation, geographical and political, Georgia was the country most likely to show that approximation of Eastern and Western thought typical of the epoch of the Crusades, and in these latter days it is largely due to the infusion of Iberian blood that Turkey and Persia have still sufficient vitality to attempt reforms.\n\nIt might have been expected that a people whose life was a ceaseless fight to keep for Christendom the bridge between Asia and Europe would have put into its greatest artistic effort an uncompromising confession of faith; but freedom of thought rather than fanaticism is characteristic of Shot'ha, so at various times, down to the eighteenth century, the orthodox clergy destroyed manuscripts of the poem, and the editio princeps of 1712 could only appear because its royal editor appended to it a pious mystical commentary. We find one reference apiece to Mohammed (1010) and Mecca (1144), and three mentions of the Koran (339, 514, 1144); the official representatives of Islam are spoken of with scant sympathy (339). To Christianity as an ecclesiastical system we have, possibly, allusions (Easter Eve, 536; icon, 247; shrine, 1345; halo, aureole, 226, 229, 1110, 1410); there may be a few quotations from the Scriptures (\"gall of bitterness,\" 99; \"hart and waterbrooks,\" 835, 1564; \"tinkling cymbals,\" 772; \"charity faileth not,\" 1520; \"through a glass darkly,\" 110, 656, 707, 1431; \"hidden treasure,\" 882; \"be content,\" \"judge not,\" 18; \"rivers run into the sea,\" 49); the Biblical personages incidentally mentioned are\u2014Adam, Beelzebub, ? Ezra, Goliath, Levi, and Satan, and the geographical names Eden, Euphrates, Gihon, Pison, and Gibeon, are used in similes; there seems to be a reference to the doctrine of regeneration (184), and another perhaps to purgatory (785).\nWhen he wrote his poem, Rust'haveli had evidently no violent prejudice for one religion more than another, but was of a critical and eclectic turn of mind, and formed for himself a working philosophy of life, showing Persian and Arabian tendencies, but with so much of Christianity and Neo-Platonism as to bring it near to Occidental minds. \"The Georgians in the tenth and eleventh centuries interested themselves in the domain of philosophy in those same questions which occupied the leading minds of the Christian world of that period both in the East and the West, with this distinction from the others\u2014e.g., Europeans\u2014that in those days the Georgians responded earlier than others to the newest tendencies of philosophic thought, and worked in a panoply, exemplary for its time, of textual criticism directly on the Greek originals.\"\u00b9\n\nThere is throughout the poem manifest joy in life and action: God createth not evil (1468, 1485); ill is fleeting (1337); since there is gladness in the world, why should any be sad? (687); it is after all a good world, fair to look upon despite its horrid deserts, a world to sing in either because one is happy or because one wishes to be so (946); there are flowers to gaze on, good wine to drink, fair apparel and rich jewels to wear, beasts worth hunting, games worth playing, foes to be fought, and friends to be loved and helped. There are grievous troubles, but they are to be battled against; it is a law with men that they should struggle and suffer (776); for them is endeavour, and victory lies with God (883); however black the outlook, there must be no shirking, for the one deed especially Satan's is suicide (728, 768, 815, 854, 1169); the game must be played to the end manfully, and God is generous though the world be hard (911, 1338); He will make all right in the end (1365), and sorrow alone shows a man's mettle (945). The keynote is optimism quand m\u00eame. Life is a passing illusion (1572), brief and untrustworthy (1575), in itself nothing but a silly tale (697); we are gazers through a cloudy, distorting glass (110, 656, 707, 1431); our deeds are mere\n\n\u00b9 Marr, Ioann Petritzki, St. Petersburg, 1902, p. 61.\nchildish sports making for soul-fitness. The one way of escape from illusion is in the exercise of that essential part of ourselves which unites us with the choir of the heavenly hosts (771); love lifts us out of the mundane marsh (772); brother must act brotherly (914); we must loyally serve our chosen friends, those with whom we have formed a bond stronger than the ties of blood: for such we must die if need be (296). The poem is a glorification of friendship, and the story is of the mutual aid of three starlike heroes wont to serve one another (6); even the gratification of the tenderest love must be postponed to this high duty; the betrothed, the newly-wedded, must part for this (292, 685, 688, 1541); friend makes of himself a road and a bridge (685) by which his friend passes to joy. That women have their share in such friendships is shown by the fraternity between Asmat'h and Tariel, and it is a proof of the deep culture of the people that such bonds still exist; there is probably no country where men have so many pure ties with women, where they are bound by affection to so many with whom the idea of marriage is never permitted to present itself. It is to the influence of such customs that we may partly attribute the high civilization of the race; it is equally true that respect for women is a sign of ancient culture. Rust'haveli is the poet of the whole people, and refinement of manners is not limited to, or absent from, any rank of life; the passage (234, 235) in which Avt'handil forgets for a moment that he is a \"gentleman\" makes every Georgian blush, and even in these days of comparative degeneracy one never hears of any man behaving with discourtesy in the presence of a woman. Woman is man's equal; the lion's whelps are alike lions (39); the three heroines are queens in their own right, free to dispose of themselves in marriage, fitted to rule kingdoms; Dame P'hatman is Acting Collector of Customs and Master of the Merchant Guild in her husband's absence.\n\nFriendship is thus the main fact of life, the thing that makes it worth living; but its highest form is that noblest love (12) of which some of the introductory quatrains treat.\nThis is the divine frenzy (27, 29), breathed only into the gentle, the fair, the wise, the brave, and the generous (9), unseating the charioteer Reason, antecedent to a nuptial choice, transforming the lover into the divine likeness, and thus preparing him for the creative act by which mankind is renewed from age to age. It is a tender feeling (9), pure in its essence (10), hiding itself from the view of the world (12), needing not love in return, but enduring patiently the wrath of the beloved (10); it is changeless in its object (11), steadfast to the end; when it is reciprocated it sweetens death, for in eternity it finds full fruition (1280-1282). It is in this passion, relentless and beautiful like the panther whose coat he wears, that Tariel is wrapped.\n\nIf in his advocacy of reticence in affairs of the heart, and his insistence on \"playing the game,\" Rust'haveli makes a special appeal to British readers, there are at least two points wherein he might seem likely to lack their approval: his hyperbolic descriptions of grief at separation, and his hackneyed astronomic similes for human beauty. But such emotional excesses are by himself disapproved (855, 911), and they find parallels in our own literature as late as the eighteenth century, and with passages like those in 806 and 1423 we have numerous analogies in Western literature; it is to be remembered that every parting is looked upon as possibly, or even probably, the last, and is thus invested with the bitterness of death (994). The radiant loveliness of the heroes and heroines is described in terms of the brightest celestial lights, because the shining forth of the soul through a fair countenance is in sober fact more brilliant, even, than those heavenly bodies which were of old the objects of worship.\n\nThen, again, there are three unpleasant incidents in the story: Avt'handil's murder of the Chachnagir, and his intrigue with P'hatman, and Tariel's assassination of Khvarazmsha. We are not concerned to defend the morality of those transactions, and prefer to suppose that they were as repugnant to Rust'haveli as to ourselves; they are necessary to the working out of the plot, and they\nwere all for the sake of women and directly instigated by women. As for Tariel's ill-treatment of Rostevan's men and the Cathayans, we are to presume that his madness is his excuse; like Hamlet, grief at a father's death, loss of both sovereignty and mistress, combined to produce a mania sometimes murderous in its manifestations; but as soon as he is cured, his natural kindness of heart returns, and his boyish disposition exhibits itself in frolic (1351, 1352).\n\nEnough has been said to show the main idea of the poem, and in the Appendix will be found groups of references to particular points of interest, things abstract and concrete. It now becomes necessary to say something of the poet, though we have much less historical knowledge of him than of Shakespeare. His life seems to have lasted from 1172 to 1216. The personal name Shot'ha is said to be a form of Ashot'ha, an appellation of the idol of Armaz (Ormuzd), and is occasionally met with in the chronicles of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Rust'haveli means Rust'havian, man of Rust'havi; one place of that name was an episcopal see, but the other is evidently the poet's birthplace, for he describes himself as a Meskhian (1572); so it is from Rust'havi in the district of Akhaltzikhe (which means Newcastle) that he came; he was thus of the race of Meshech (Gen. x. 2; Ps. cxx. 5; Ezek. xxvii. 13, xxii. 26). Tradition says he was early left an orphan in the care of an uncle who was a monk, that he was educated at the church school of Rust'havi and the monasteries of Tbeti, Gremi, and Iqalt'ho, and was then, in accordance with the custom of the period, sent to Athens,\\(^1\\) Olympus, and Jerusalem. On his return he wrote Odes\\(^2\\) in honour of the sainted Queen T'hamara (A.D. 1184-1212), and as a reward was appointed treasurer at the brilliant court of that great and good sovereign, whose reign saw Georgia's political power and literary culture at their highest point of achievement. We are told that his native\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Athos.\n\n\\(^2\\) Professor Marr thinks the Odes of the Thamaran age, of which he recently published a scholarly edition (*vide* Bibliography), are by Rust'haveli.\nplace was given to him as an estate in lieu of salary. There is a document preserved in the Tiflis Synodal Archives, dated 1190 (?), signed by him as royal treasurer; he must have been singularly precocious if the date of his birth were really 1172. The popular story tells how, hopelessly in love with his queen, he retired to the monastery of Holy Rood at Jerusalem, where, on a pillar, over a portrait is the inscription: \"May God pardon Shot'ha, the painter of this. Amen. Rust'haveli.\" It seems strange that the word \"Rust'haveli\" should be added after \"Amen\"; in any case there is a portrait which readers can accept as not discordant with the character displayed in the epic. Many legends are attached to his name; they represent him as enamoured of T'hamara and married to an unworthy wife.\n\nThe oldest manuscript is said to be an undated parchment, which, according to Plato Ioseliani, was the property of a Colonel Gregory Tseret'heli; another copy, on paper, is alleged to be of the year 1443; and a third is dated 1678. These were used by King Vakhtang VI. for his edition of 1712; but they have apparently been lost, and, so far as we know, there is no existing manuscript earlier than the seventeenth century, and none dated before 1646. It is most desirable that attention should be devoted to the purification of the text.\n\nThe poem is written in quatrains of rhyming lines of sixteen syllables, with an accentuation dividing the lines into halves. It is meant to be sung to the \"Davidic\" harp (1574), which may have come to the Caucasus with the Jews of the Babylonish Captivity. In the remoter parts of the country, minstrels may perhaps even now be heard chanting the story of Tariel.\n\n---\n\n1 Journal of Biblical Literature, Boston, 1894, p. 179; translated from Professor Tsagareli's Syvedeniya. The portrait has been defaced.\n2 Professor Khakhanov, Ocherki, ii. 247, 248; E. T'haqaishvili, Opisanie rukopisei, t. ii. 57, 393, 395, 468, 554-592.\n3 A Sinai manuscript, apparently of the tenth century, contains a hymn for Christmas in honour of the B.V.M., written in rhymed lines of sixteen feet; it is not, however, divided into quatrains (Marr, t. xii., p. liv).\nThe following transliteration of a quatrain will give an idea of the verse, and may help to remove from the language the reproach cast upon it by some writers who had not even an elementary acquaintance with it:\n\n1281.\n\nMz\u00e9 ush\u00e9nod v\u00e9r ikmn\u00e9bis/ r\u00e1dgan sh\u00e9n khar m\u00eds\u00ed ts\u00edli\ng\u00e1ghan\u00f3mtza m\u00e1s i\u00e1khle/ m\u00eds\u00ed \u00e9tli \u00e1r t'hu tsb\u00edli\nm\u00fana gn\u00e1kho m\u00e1ndve gs\u00e1kho/ g\u00e1nmin\u00e1t'hlo g\u00fali chrd\u00edli\nt'h\u00fa sitz\u00f3tzkhle mts\u00e1re mk\u00f3nda/ s\u00edcvd\u00edl\u00edmmtza mk\u00f3ndes teb\u00edli.\n\nThe Europeans who have heard of Georgian think it a cacophonous assemblage of consonants with many gutturals and a sparing use of vowels. It is true, indeed, that groups of consonants repellent to a Western eye and ear are frequently found, and herein lies the vigour of the language. A modern Turkish poet addresses a Georgian lady thus: \"O thou whose speech is like a lion's roar!\" This, however, is but one phonetic aspect of a tongue which in its love lyrics and lullabies can be as soft and caressing as Italian, (\"sweet-sounding Georgian,\" 692) in its rhetorical and philosophic passages as sonorous and dignified as Castilian. Georgian has been a highly-developed literary language from the dawn of the Christian era; and students of cuneiform are engaged in the task of tracing it back to the earliest periods of history; it has a vocabulary so rich, a flexibility so great, that it renders metaphysical Greek works not only word for word, but sometimes syllable by syllable. In the monastery of Petritzos, now called Bachkovo, in the Rhodope, founded, or renovated, by Georgians in 1083, and still bearing traces of their occupation, was a philosophic seminary where many Neo-Platonist and other translations were made. One of the monks, John Petritzi, in the late eleventh or early twelfth century, wrote thus: \"In the translation of difficult speculative and philosophic works I consider myself obliged to apply all possible simplicity, and follow the peculiarities of the language (of the original) to the utmost.\" In commenting\non this passage, Professor Marr\\(^1\\) writes: \"John Petritzi translated not only ideas, but words, even words existing in the Georgian language: terms do not satisfy him unless they cover the original etymologically, or even in some cases by the number of their syllables. . . . To him we owe a ready-made philosophic terminology in the Georgian language, marvellously exact and concisely rendering by Georgian roots all those terms which in European languages are borrowed from Greek and Latin.\"\n\nIt was such a language that Rust'haveli used, with a perfection of art which makes a foreign student at first despair of perceiving even the outline of the story. A quatrain may have four quadrisyllabic endings apparently identical (e.g., asadages, 136), and no little knowledge and thought are needed to arrive at the sense in which each of them is to be taken. The beginner is occasionally tempted to believe that the poem is rather music than narrative, that it aims more at inspiring moods than speaking clearly to the intelligence; it is only after some labour that the logical unity of the fable is grasped.\n\nSome controversy has arisen as to the dramatic story which forms the groundwork of the epic, and not a few inkhorns have been emptied by commentators on the passages, \"This Persian tale now done into Georgian\" (16) and \"I, Rust'haveli, have composed this work by my art\" (15). It may here suffice to say that no trace of such a Persian story has yet been discovered; and even if it were found, our author's fame would thereby suffer no more than Shakespeare's does from Luigi da Porto's novel. Perhaps Rust'haveli used a pre-existing fable; this, at least, seems the simplest way of accounting for the episode of Avt'handil's intrigue with P'hatman, which is treated with distaste, though it serves to throw a brighter light on Tariel as the faultless lover compared with his sworn brother the tactful, heroic man of the world, and the poet would hardly have invented it, or even used it, unless it had\n\n\\(^1\\) Ioann Petritzki, p. 35.\nbeen indispensable in the working out of the plot. It is true that nearly all the characters have Persian names\u2014perhaps none but Tariel, T'hinat'hin, Davar, and Avt'handil are originally Georgian (and the last is doubtful)\u2014and a large number of Persian words are used; but this seems to be due partly to a desire of avoiding the appearance of hinting at current events, and partly to a fashion of the time, the natural result of literary sympathies between two neighbouring cultured peoples. There is something to be said in favour of Professor Khakhanov's theory, that the folk ballads about Tariel and Avt'handil, of which variants are still sung, especially by the mountaineers, were part of the popular literature before the T'hamaran age; while the historical fact of the great queen's elevation to the throne during her father's lifetime was used as a preface to the story.\n\nThere is a point to which attention might be given: In Arabic literature one of the earliest forms is that of the eulogy in brief epigrammatic verse. Now, in The Man in the Panther's Skin we find a remarkably frequent use of the word keba (praise); in a score of quatrains keba occurs; we also meet with the Arabic word khotba (3, 1009, 1025) in approximately the same sense, and there is one reference to a professional eulogist, makebi catzi (1527); finally, one passage (1574) says the poem is made up out of kebani (eulogies). It is for scholars to inquire into the matter, and see whether the numerous kebani may not be more ancient than the poem, and perhaps the determinant factor in the choice of the verse form (called shairi); whether, in fact, Rust'haveli did not take from oral tradition certain short verses uniform in their prosody, and weave his work round them after their pattern. In the Athos manuscript of the Georgian Bible, copied in A.D. 978\n\n---\n\n1 In the footnotes, words believed to be of Arabic and Persian origin are marked \"A\" and \"P.\"\n2 Ocherki, ii. 252-255; but Professor Marr thinks the ballads are based on the epic.\n3 5, 46, 68, 144, 438, 450, 595, 603, 711, 754, 881, 968, 983, 1027, 1073, 1410, 1430, 1435, 1512, 1524, 1574.\nfor the great warrior-monk Thornici from an earlier translation, the \"Song of Songs\" is Keba Kebat'ha; this seems to show that in ancient Georgia the keba, or eulogy, was the poem par excellence.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe English translation endeavours to present the author's ideas and expressions with such fidelity that it may be of use to those who wish to read the original. This version was begun in Kent in 1891, and the first draft was completed at Kertch on November 1, 1898; but in spite of frequent revision and correction, carried on till December, 1909, it is imperfect, and the translator estimated that ten more years of study at least would be required to bring it to its final shape. Nevertheless, as it stands it is a contribution to Georgian studies in Europe, a stepping-stone to help others in a difficult task. It is believed that several attempted literal translations into Russian (including one by the late M. Poltoratzky), and one into French (by M. Meunargia), exist, but the translator never saw them. Since her death an attempt has been made to publish a Russian version in a Tiflis newspaper, but the public received it so ill that the editor was, unfortunately, compelled to desist. Herr Arthur Leist's metrical paraphrase in German (Der Mann im Tigerfelle, Dresden and Leipzig, no date) gives an excellent summary of the poem, and is recommended to readers. Through the corruption of the text and the lack of critical editions and such aids, lexicographic, grammatical, philological, historical, as readers of other great literatures enjoy, there are many passages which seem incapable of satisfactory interpretation; these are rendered as literally as possible. It is a pleasing duty to set down here an acknowledgment of the generous assistance given in preparing this work for the press; so many have collaborated that it is impossible to mention them individually, but special thanks are due to M. Michel Tseret'heli for reading through the whole\n\n\\(^1\\) Professor Tsagareli has published the Athos text of the \"Song of Songs\" in his Svyedeniya o pamyatnikakh (St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences).\nmanuscript, and to Professor Nicholas Marr, of the University of St. Petersburg, who has supplied additional material, and has permitted the publication, in the Appendix, of an English version of his Russian rendering of the obscure introductory and concluding quatrains, and of other passages. Helpers will find sufficient recompense in the thought that they are co-workers with one who loved Rust'haveli and Georgia.\n\nLast of all, this book, designed to be the translator's chief work, should contain some notice of her life. She was born in London on November 26, 1869; died at Bucharest on December 7, 1909; and was buried at Sevenoaks. She began the study of Georgian, as her learned predecessor, M.-F. Brosset, had done, with an alphabet and a Gospel, and when she had made some progress it was his grammar and dictionary she first used; as a girl of twenty she chose this as the idea of her life. She was already equipped with a sound education, and during her varied, busy career she not only used French, German, Italian, Russian, and Roumanian in the daily concerns of the household and the amenities of social intercourse, but applied herself to those tongues and their literatures. From early womanhood she spent nearly all her time abroad\u2014in Italy, France, and North Africa, comparatively short periods; in Hayti over a year; in Roumania three years; in various parts of the Russian dominions about ten years. Her published works are\u2014*Georgian Folk-Tales*; London, 1894 (D. Nutt). *The Hermit*, a legend by Prince Ilia Chavchavadze (in verse); London, 1895 (B. Quaritch). *Life of St. Nino*; Oxford, 1900 (Clarendon Press). She left *The Man in the Panther's Skin* and other translations in manuscript.\n\nA letter to Ilia Chavchavadze, asking permission to translate *The Hermit*, was printed in his newspaper *Iveria* of September 8 (O.S.), 1894, as a model of style, and led to a revival of interest in their language and literature among the younger generation. On her arrival in Transcaucasia in December, 1894, she was received\nwith enthusiasm, and her travels during a second visit, in 1896, brought her into touch with every class of the people. She formed many lasting friendships, and kept up a large correspondence in the Georgian language. There is hardly a household in the Western Caucasus where her name is unknown. Others have studied the language, literature, and history, of Georgia; she in addition felt an affection for the nation,\\(^1\\) kept herself informed of all that concerned its welfare, and was sometimes able unobtrusively to do good work for it. To the less fortunate of her own countrywomen, with whom she had much opportunity of acquaintance abroad, she was a sincere friend and comforter; her loss was deplored even by many who knew her but slightly, for, though fragile and weak of body, she never spared herself in her efforts for others. Her intimates found in her a mastery of the arts that make an English home, subtle humour, strength of mind, and warmth of heart. Her reticence about her own achievements was such that few of those who prized her social charm and domestic virtues were aware that her leisure was devoted to study. She calmly, cheerfully, and helpfully faced pestilence, war, and other dangers; at three successive places of residence\u2014Port-au-Prince (1902), St. Petersburg (1905), Bucharest (1907)\u2014she heard cannon fired in civil strife, and she shared the perils, joys, and sorrows, of the peoples among whom she lived. In accordance with a wish she had frequently expressed, the nucleus of a fund for the encouragement of Georgian studies has been formed at Oxford, and her books and manuscripts are being transferred to the Bodleian Library.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

He who created the firmament,\\(^1\\) by that mighty power made beings inspired from on high with souls celestial; to us men He has given the world, infinite in variety we possess it; from Him is every monarch in His likeness.\n\n2. O one God! Thou didst create the face of every form!\\(^2\\) Shield me, give me mastery to trample on Satan, give me the longing of lovers lasting even unto death, lightening (of the burden) of sins I must bear thither with me.\\(^3\\)\n\n3. Of that lion whom the use of lance, shield and sword adorns, of the king,\\(^4\\) the sun T'hamara, the ruby-cheeked, the jet-haired, of her I know not how I shall dare to sing the manifold praise\\(^5\\); they who look upon her must offer her the sweets\\(^6\\) for which she hungers.\n\n4. By shedding tears of blood we praise King T'hamara, whose praises I, not ill-chosen, have told forth. For ink I have used a lake of jet, and for pen a pliant crystal.\\(^7\\) Whoever hears, a jagged spear will pierce his heart!\n\n5. She bade me indite sweet verses in her praise, laud\\(^8\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Samgaro*, 109.  \n\\(^2\\) M., \"form (kind) of every body.\"  \n\\(^3\\) M., \"bear with me into yonder world.\"  \n\\(^4\\) *I.e.*, queen regnant; but M. says the invocation is addressed to David, T'hamara's consort. Cf. *Odes* (introduction), Al.

An anvil of soft lead breaks even hard stone.\\(^1\\)\n\n6. Now want I tongue, heart and skill for utterance! Grant me strength! And if I have aid from thee I shall have understanding, so may we succour Tariel; tenderly indeed should we cherish his memory and that of the three starlike heroes wont to serve one another.\n\n7. Come, sit ye down, ye who have been born under the same fate; let us shed a never-drying tear for Tariel\u2019s sake. I sat me down, I, Rust\u2019haveli, indited a poem, my heart pierced with a lance. Hitherto the tale has been told as a tale; now is it a pearl (of) measured (poesy).\n\n8. To a lover, beauty, glorious beauty, wisdom, wealth, generosity, youth and leisure are fitting; he must be eloquent, intelligent, patient, an overcomer of mighty adversaries; who has not all these qualities lacks the character of a lover.\n\n9. Love is tender, a thing hard to be known.\\(^2\\) True love is something apart from lust, and cannot be likened thereto; it is one thing; lust is quite another thing, and between them lies a broad boundary; in no way do they mingle\u2014hear my saying!\n\n10. The lover must be constant, not lewd, impure and faithless; when he is far from his beloved he must heave sigh upon sigh; his heart must be fixed on one from whom he endures wrath or sorrow if need be. I hate heartless love\u2014embracing, kissing, noisy bussing.\\(^3\\)\n\n11. Lovers, call not this thing love: when any longs for one to-day and another to-morrow, (lightly) bearing parting\u2019s pain. Such base sport is like mere boyish trifling; the good lover is he who suffers a world\u2019s woe.\n\n12. There is a first (? noblest) love; it does not show, but hides its woes; (the lover) thinks of it when he is alone, and always seeks solitude; his fainting, dying,\n\n\\(^1\\) ? Marlowe: \u201cMy heart is as an anvil unto sorrow.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) \u201cLove is rare (delicate), (of) a kind (species) hard to know.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) Mtlasha-mlusha. May also be read: \u201cWhen the constant\u2014not lewd, impure and faithless\u2014lover is far . . .\u201d\nburning, flaming, all are from afar; he may face the wrath of kings, yet will he be fearful of her.\n\n13. He must betray his secret to none, he must not basely groan\\(^1\\) and put his beloved to shame; in nought should he manifest his love, nowhere must he reveal it; for her sake he looks upon sorrow as joy, for her sake he would willingly be burned (or willingly burns [with love]).\\(^2\\)\n\n14. How can the sane trust him who noises his love abroad, and what shall it profit to do this? He makes her suffer, and he himself suffers. How should he glorify her if he shame her with words? What a chance if one hurt not his beloved's heart!\\(^3\\)\n\n15. I, Rust'haveli, have composed this work by my art. For her whom a multitude of hosts obey, I lose my wits, I die! I am sick of love, and for me there is no cure from anywhere, unless she give me healing or the earth a grave.\n\n16. This Persian tale, now done into Georgian, has hitherto been like a pearl of great price\\(^4\\) cast in play from hand to hand; now I have found it and mounted it in a setting of verse; I have done a praiseworthy\\(^5\\) deed. The ravisher of my reason, proud and beautiful, willed me to do it.\n\n17. Eyes that have lost their light through her long to look on her anew; lo! my heart is mad with love, and it is my lot to run about the fields. Who will pray for me? The burning of the body sufficeth, let (her) give soul-comfort! In praise of threefold hue, the verse must needs fall short.\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Orlando Furioso, xvi. 2, 7, 8: \"Pianger non d\u00e8' sebben languisce e muore.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) M., \"in nothing should his love reveal itself; nowhere must he show it. To suffer for her sake should mean for him joy; for her he should go into fire.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) M., \"Can anyone but a madman trust him who proclaims his beloved? What profit shall he have? Only this: that he harms her, and himself too. How is he able to glorify her if in words he shame her? What need is there for men to cause pain to the heart of the beloved?\" Cf. 30, 363, 364, 709, 710.\n\n\\(^4\\) Margaliti oboli, lit., orphan pearl. This quatrain contradicts 7 and breaks the continuity of 15 and 17.\n\n\\(^5\\) Sadchodchmanebi. ? Equivocal.\n\n\\(^6\\) \"Threefold\" ? refers to the \"three star-like heroes\" (6) so worthy of praise (sakebel'tha), or to the three kinds of poetry (22-24). P'herit'ha, 1.\n18. With what Fate gives to a man, therewithal should he be content, and so (? contentedly) speak of it.\\(^1\\) The labourer should ever work, the warrior be brave. So, also, should the lover love Love, and recognize it. Who judges not will not be judged by others.\n\n19. Minstrelsy\\(^2\\) is, first of all, a branch of wisdom; divinely intelligible to the godlike, very wholesome to them that hearken; it is pleasant, too, if the listener be a worthy man; in few words he utters a long discourse:\\(^3\\) herein lies the excellence of poetry.\n\n20. Like a horse running a great race on a long course,\\(^4\\) like a ball-player\\(^5\\) in the lists striking the ball fairly and aiming adroitly at the mark, even so it is with the poet who composes and indites long poems, when utterance is hard for him and verse begins to fail.\n\n21. Then, indeed, behold the poet, and his poesy will be manifest. When he is at a loss for Georgian (words), and verse begins to fail, he will not weaken Georgian, nor will he let it grow poor in words. Let him strike the ball\\(^6\\) cunningly; he will show great virtue.\n\n22. He who utters, somewhere, one or two verses cannot be called a poet; let him not think himself equal to great singers. Even if they compose a few discrepant verses from time to time, yet if they say, \u201cMine are of the best!\u201d they are stiff-necked mules.\n\n23. Secondly, lyrics which are but a small part of poetry and cannot command heart-piercing words\u2014I may liken them to the bad bows of young hunters who cannot kill big game; they are able only to slay the small.\n\n24. Thirdly, lyrics are fit for the festive, the joyous, the amorous, the merry, for pleasantries of comrades; they\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) 1 Cor. vii. 17-20.\n\n\\(^2\\) Shairoba. Shairi is the form of verse used by Rust'haveli in this poem.\n\n\\(^3\\) This is the principle followed by Al. Saradjishvili in his critical work on the spurious passages (cf. Bibliographical Note in Appendix).\n\n\\(^4\\) Shara, P., 654.\n\n\\(^5\\) Bur'hi, 63, 804, 1100. The modern game is played with both hands and feet. The ball is of leather, about the size of a football.\n\n\\(^6\\) Chogan, game of polo; ? \u201cHe will make his goal.\u201d\nplease us when they are rightly sung. Those are not called poets who cannot compose a long work.\n\n25. The poet must not spend his toil in vain. One should seem to him worthy of love; he must be devoted to one, he must employ all his art for her, he must praise her, he must set forth the glory of his beloved; he must wish for nought else, for her alone must his tongue be tuneful.\\(^1\\)\n\n26. Now let all know that I praise her whom I (erstwhile) praised; in this I have great glory, I feel no shame. She is my life; merciless as a leopard\\(^2\\) is she. Her name I pronounce hereafter\\(^3\\) with triumph and praise.\\(^4\\)\n\n27. I speak of the highest love\u2014divine in its kind. It is difficult to discourse thereon, ill to tell forth with tongues. It is heavenly, upraising the soul on pinions.\\(^5\\) Whoever strives thereafter must indeed have endurance of many griefs.\n\n28. Sages cannot comprehend that one Love; the tongue will tire, the ears of the listeners will become wearied; I must tell of lower frenzies, which befall human beings; they imitate it when they wanton not, but faint from afar.\\(^6\\)\n\n29. In the Arabic tongue they call the lover \u201cmadman,\u201d\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Musicobdes.\n\n\\(^2\\) Djiki. The traditional meaning is that here given. Cf. M., who suggests a connection with \u201cAdighe\u201d\u2014Circassian. Cf. 893 note.\n\n\\(^3\\) Kvemore\u2014\u201cbelow, after this\u201d; ? quatr. 3, 4 should follow 26.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ch. s.v. shep\u2019hrkveva.\n\n\\(^5\\) M., \u201cgiving elevation to those who strive to endure and undergo many afflictions.\u201d\n\n\\(^6\\) M., \u201cThe wise cannot understand this unique, mad Love, (though) the tongue should speak of it till it was tired, and the hearer (attended) till his ears were wearied. Madness (of love) which is connected with the flesh I call base, and this it is they imitate, even when they do not the works of the flesh, but afar off lose consciousness\u201d; or the last line may be rendered: \u201cThey imitate this (unique, mad Love),\u201d etc.\n\n\\(^7\\) Professor Marr (T., xii., pp. i, li) shows how the hermit ideal grew up in Georgia side by side with feudalism, and by its insistence on the ecstatic love of God contributed to the growth of the idea of romantic love. This asceticism prevailed from the seventh or eighth century till the twelfth. Similarly, love of woman sent knights out into the wilderness. The mijnuris and majnunis were the saints of this secular cult among the Arabs, and, possessed by the djinn of love, became poets. The pagan Arabs looked upon mejnuns as prophets and poets, and on Mohammed\u2019s appearance thought him one of them.\nbecause by non-fruition he loses his wits. Some have nearness to God,\\(^1\\) but they weary in the flight; then again, to others it is natural to pursue beauty.\\(^2\\)\n\n30. I wonder why men show that they love the beloved. Why shame they her whom they love, her who slays herself for them, who is covered with wounds? If they love her not, why do they not manifest to her feelings of hatred? Why do they disgrace what they hate? But an evil man loves an evil word more than his soul or heart.\\(^3\\)\n\n31. If the lover weep for his beloved, tears are her (? his) due. Wandering and solitude befit him, and must be esteemed as roaming. He will have time for nothing but to think of her. If he be among men, it is better that he manifest not his love.\\(^4\\)\n\nI\n\nSTORY OF ROSTEVAN, KING OF THE ARABIANS\n\n32. There was in Arabia\\(^5\\) Rostevan, a king by the grace of God, happy, exalted, generous, modest,\\(^6\\) lord of many hosts and knights, just and gracious, powerful,\\(^7\\) far-seeing, himself a peerless warrior, moreover fluent in speech.\n\n33. No other child had the king save one only daughter, the shining light of the world, to be ranked with nought but the sunny group; whoever looked on her, she bereft\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ch. Dict., \"zeal for the divine.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) M., \"He goes mad from grief, not having attained (his object). Some feel nearness to God\" (lit., divine nearness); \"they exhaust themselves in effort at elevation; others have a base nature: they cringe before the fair\" (reading \\(p'\\)henit'ha for \\(p'\\)hrenitha).\n\n\\(^3\\) For this difficult quatrain Professor Marr's rendering has been adopted.\n\n\\(^4\\) M., \"Of nothing else should he think when separated from her, and when he is among men it is better that they should not perceive that he is madly in love.\"\n\n\\(^5\\) Arabia stands here for Georgia. Cf. \u00c6schylus, Prom. Vinct., 436-440. For the accession of T'hamara, cf. Kart'hlis Tzkhovreba (Histoire de la G\u00e9orgie), translated by M. Brosset.\n\n\\(^6\\) M., \"easy of access\" (\"abordable\").\n\n\\(^7\\) M. suggests \"gay, joyous,\" for mordchmuli, but Abuladze says \"majestic\" or \"blessed.\"\nhim of heart, mind and soul.\\footnote{882} It needs a wise man to praise her, and a very eloquent tongue.\\footnote{Abul. translates \"a million tongues\"\u2014i.e., a hundred times (as and uli) ten thousand (bevri).}\n\n34. Her name is T'hinat'hin\\footnote{For etymology, 51. The name was borne by at least eight royal ladies of Georgia. See Brosset's Hist. de la G\u00e9orgie (index). Cf. also Olga Lebedev's translation, La Conversion des G\u00e9orgiens, by the Patriarch Macar, of Antioch (p. 17), for a T'hinat'hin, daughter of Bagrat, King of Imeret'hi, who married a Daredjan.} ; let it be famous! When she had grown up to full womanhood, she contemned even the sun. The king called his viziers, seated himself, proud yet gentle, and, placing them by his side, began to talk graciously to them.\n\n35. He said: \"I will declare to you the matter on which we are to take counsel together. When the flower of the rose is dried and withered it falls, and another blooms in the lovely garden. The sun is set for us; we are gazing on a dark, moonless night.\n\n36. \"My day is done; old age, most grievous of all ills,\\footnote{492, 1522.} weighs on me; if not to-day, then to-morrow I die\u2014this is the way of the world. What light is that on which darkness attends? Let us instate as sovereign my daughter, of whom the sun is not worthy.\"\n\n37. The viziers\\footnote{Var. E. C., \"vizier.\"} said: \"O king, why do you speak of your age? Even when the rose fades we must needs give it its due; it still excels all in scent and fair colour. How can a star declare enmity even to the waning moon!\\footnote{Car., \"How can the star regard,\" etc.}\"\n\n38. \"Speak not then thus, O king. Your rose is not yet faded. Even bad counsel from you is better than good counsel from another. It was certainly fitting to speak out what your heart desires. It is better. Give the kingdom to her who prevails\\footnote{Shenap'hlobi, conquered, subjected.} against the sun.\n\n39. \"Though indeed she be a woman, still as sovereign she is begotten of God.\\footnote{Var. E. C., radgan kalia samep'ho, since a woman is to be sovereign.} She knows how to rule. We say not this to flatter you; we ourselves, in your absence,\noften say so. Her deeds, like her radiance, are revealed bright as sunshine. The lion's whelps are equal (alike lions), be they male or female.\"\n\n40. Avt'handil\\(^1\\) was general,\\(^2\\) son of the commander-in-chief.\\(^3\\) He was more graceful than the cypress; his presence was like sun and moon. Still beardless, he was to be likened to famous crystal and glass. The beauty of T'hinat'hin and of the host of her eyelashes was slaying him.\n\n41. He kept his love hidden in his heart. When he was absent and saw her not, his rose faded; when he saw her, the fires were renewed, his wound smarted more. Love is pitiable; it makes man heart-slain.\n\n42. When the king commanded that his daughter should be enthroned as king, gladness came upon Avt'handil; the extinction (concealment) of that jewel irks him.\\(^4\\) He said to himself: \"Often will it now fall to my lot to gaze upon her crystal face\\(^5\\); perchance I may thus find a cure for my pallor.\"\n\n43. The great sovereign of the Arabs published throughout Arabia an edict: \"I, her father, appoint my T'hinat'hin king; she shall illumine all, even as the shining sun. Come and see, all ye who praise and extol!\" (or, praise and extol her!).\n\n44. All the Arabians came; the crowd of courtiers\\(^6\\) increased. The sun-faced Avt'handil, chief of ten thousand times a thousand soldiers, the vizier Sograt, the nearest to the king of all his attendants. When they placed the throne the people said: \"Its worth is beyond words!\"\n\n45. T'hinat'hin, radiant in countenance, was led in by her sire. He seated her, and with his own hands set the crown on her head; he gave her the sceptre,\\(^7\\) and clad her\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P., Khaftan=cuirass of panther's skin (worn by Rustem in the Shah-Nameh), and dil=heart. It is interesting thus to find the panther associated with Avt'handil as well as Tariel. 57.\n\n\\(^2\\) Spaspeti (P.). 1240.\n\n\\(^3\\) Amir-spasalari (P.).\n\n\\(^4\\) Ch., misokalisa; Kart., mis okalisa; Car., mis sokalisa.

The king\\(^3\\) and his armies retired and did homage. They blessed her and established her as king, many from many places told forth her praises\\(^4\\); the trumpets were blown and the cymbals\\(^5\\) sounded sweetly. The maiden wept, she shed many tears; she drooped her raven eyelashes (the tail feathers of the raven).\n\n47. She deemed herself unworthy to sit on her father\u2019s throne; therefore she weeps, filling the rose-garden (of her cheeks)\\(^6\\) with tears. The king admonishes her: \u201cEvery father hath a peer in his child,\u201d quoth he. \u201cUntil now the raging fire in my bosom has not been extinguished.\u201d\n\n48. He said: \u201cWeep not, daughter, but hearken to my counsel: To-day thou art King of Arabia, appointed sovereign by me; henceforth this kingdom is entrusted to thee; mayest thou be discreet in thy doings, be modest and discerning.\n\n49. \u201cSince the sun shines alike on roses and middens, be not thou weary of mercy to great and small. The generous binds the free, and he who is already bound will willingly obey. Scatter liberally, as the seas pour forth again the floods they have received.\\(^7\\)\n\n50. \u201cMunificence\\(^8\\) in kings is like the aloe planted in Eden. All, even the traitor, are obedient to the generous. It is very wholesome to eat and drink, but what profits it to hoard?

The maiden hearkened discreetly to this her father's advice; she lent ear, she heard, she wearied not of instruction. The king drank and sported; he was exceeding joyful. T'hinat'hin contemned the sun, but the sun aped T'hinat'hin.\\(^1\\)\n\n52. She sent for her faithful, trusty tutor, and said: \"Bring hither all my treasure sealed by thee, all the wealth belonging to me as king's daughter.\" He brought it; she gave without measure, without count, untiringly.\n\n53. That day she gave away all she had gathered since her childhood; she enriched both small folk and great. Then she said: \"I do the deed my father taught me; let none keep back any of my hoarded treasure.\"\n\n54. She said: \"Go, open whatever treasure there is! Master of the Horse,\\(^2\\) lead in the droves of asses, mules, and horses.\"\\(^3\\) He brought them. She gave them away without measure; she wearied not of generosity. The soldiers gathered together stuff\\(^4\\) like pirates.\\(^5\\)\n\n55. They pillaged her treasury as 'twere booty from Turks\\(^6\\); they carried off her fine, sleek Arab steeds. Her munificence was like a snowstorm whirling down from the sky; none remained empty, neither youth nor maiden.\n\n56. One day passed; there was a banquet, food and drink\u2014a feast of fruit. A great gathering of warriors sat there to make merry. The king hung his head, and his brow was furrowed with sadness. They began to discuss this one with another: \"What weighs upon him, and why grieves he?\"\n\n57. At the head sat the sun-faced Avt'handil, desirable to them that look upon him, the agile\\(^7\\) leader of the hosts; like a panther and a lion is he.\\(^8\\) The old vizier Sograt\\(^9\\) sat by his side. They said one to the other: \"What ails the king, and why has he grown pale?\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) T'hinat'hineba, to reflect rays.\n\n\\(^2\\) Amilakhori (P.).\n\n\\(^3\\) Abuladze's reading, rema-djori da tzkhenia.\n\n\\(^4\\) Lari, silk goods (? stuff par excellence), goods, merchandise, treasure, 1042.\n\n\\(^5\\) Meccbre, 193, 195, 1012, 1016, 1019, 1031.\n\n\\(^6\\) Nat'hurkalsa.\n\n\\(^7\\) Chauki.\n\n\\(^8\\) Var.

They said: \"Some unpleasant thought has come into the king's mind, for nothing has happened here to make him sad.\" Quoth Avt'handil: \"Let us inquire, O Sograt, let him tell us why he is displeased with us; let us venture on some pleasantry; why hath he shamed us?\"\n\n59. Sograt and the graceful Avt'handil arose; each filled his winecup, and with meek mien drew nigh. Then with smiling faces they cast themselves on their knees before the king. The vizier sportively spoke thus, with eloquent words:\n\n60. \"You look sad, O king; there is no longer a smile on your face. Thou art right, for, lo! your daughter with lavish hand has given away all your rich and costly treasure. Make her not king at all; why bring grief on thyself?\"2\n\n61. When the king heard him he looked up with a smile. He marvelled how he had ventured thus, how he dared to speak such words! \"Well hast thou done!\" He thanked his vizier. He confirmed this by what he said: \"He who lays avarice to my charge is a lying chatterer.\"\n\n62. \"That afflicts me not, O vizier. This it is that troubles me: Old age draws nigh; I have spent the days of youth, and nowhere in our dominions is there a man who hath learned from me the knightly arts.5\n\n63. \"It is true I have a daughter tenderly nurtured, but God has given me no son; I suffer in this fleeting life. There is none to be compared with me in archery or at the game of ball.7 It is true that Avt'handil resembles me somewhat, thanks to my teaching.\"8\n\n---\n\n1 Var. E. C., aighes, raised.

Well did a smile befit him; his shining white teeth gleamed like sunshine on a mead. The king asked: \"Why smilest thou? or why wert thou shy of me?\"\n\n65. Yet again he said: \"Why dost thou smile at me? What is laughable in me?\" The youth replied: \"I shall tell you if you grant me leave\\(^1\\) to speak. With what I say be not offended; be not wroth, blame me not, call me not bold, ruin me not for this!\"\n\n66. He answered: \"How can I take aught thou sayst as displeasing?\" He took an oath by the sun (\\(i.e.\\), life) of T'hinat'hin, that contemner of the sun. Avt'handil said: \"Then will I speak boldly\\(^2\\); vaunt not yourself of your archery, it is better to speak modestly.\n\n67. \"I, Avt'handil, earth under your feet, am an archer before you; let us lay a wager\\(^3\\); let your armies\\(^4\\) attend as witnesses.

Avt'handil obeyed; they ceased their discourse. They laughed, they sported like children, lovingly and becomingly they behaved. They fixed the wager, and laid down this condition: Whoever shall be beaten, let him go bareheaded for three days.\n\n70. (The king) commanded, moreover: \"Let twelve slaves\\(^7\\) be chosen to attend us, twelve to give me\\(^8\\) arrows\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P'hirmani, P., 627, p'harmani.\n\n\\(^2\\) Var. E.

To the huntsmen he said: \u201cTravel over the plain,\u00b2 beat in many droves, go yourselves to do this, invite the soldiers to look on, (bid them) assemble and close round!\u201d The wassail and banquet broke up; there were we pleasantly merry.\n\n72. Early in the morning he (Avt\u2019handil) came forth like a well-grown lily; he was clad in crimson,\u00b3 his face was of crystal and ruby,\u2074 over his face was a golden veil, he was fair in huntsman\u2019s apparel.\u2075 He rode upon a white steed; he invited the king to come forth.\n\n73. The king was arrayed, he mounted, they set out for the chase. The people surrounded the field, they made a ring\u2076 round about it; there was much mirth and excitement\u2077; the armies kept the ground. For their wager were they shooting and striving together.\n\n74. The king commanded the twelve slaves: \u201cCome, accompany us, bring us the swift\u2078 bows, prepare the arrows, compare what is struck and keep count of the shots.\u201d Game began to come in from every corner of the plain.\n\n75.

They slew, their arrows sped, blood flowed through the field; as the shafts were shot away the slaves brought more of them.\\(^1\\) The beasts wounded by them could not take another step.\n\n77. They ran through that field; they drove the herd before them. They slew and exterminated, they made wroth the God of the heavens, the fields were dyed crimson with the blood they shed from the beasts. Those who watched Avt\u2019handil said: \u201cHe is like an aloe-tree\\(^2\\) planted in Eden.\u201d\n\n78. They coursed over the whole of that plain only they had travelled over. There on the farther edge of the plain flows a stream; on the bank of the stream are rocks. The game fled into the wood, where horse could not follow. (Rostevan and Avt\u2019handil) were both fatigued, (yet) how spirited they were! (? They were tired in spite of their strength.)\\(^3\\)\n\n79. Each laughingly said to the other: \u201c\u2019Tis I that have won!\u201d Merry were they; they sported, hither and thither they frolicked. Then came the slaves who had tarried, and (the king) said: \u201cTell the truth; we seek not flattery from you.\u201d\n\n80. The slaves said: \u201cWe shall speak the truth; think not we shall deceive you, O king; we may by no means liken you to him. Slay us at once if you will, it matters not; this cannot help you in any way. We observed the beasts stricken by him\\(^4\\); they could not move forward a step.\n\n81. \u201cTogether ye have slain in all a hundred score, but Avt\u2019handil killed more by a score; he missed not even one at which he aimed his bow, but of yours we cleaned up many which left blots on the earth.\u201d\n\n82.

As they sported they gazed at the stream and the edge of the glens.\n\nII\n\nHOW THE KING OF THE ARABIANS SAW THE KNIGHT CLAD IN THE PANTHER'S SKIN\n\n84. They saw a certain stranger knight; he sat weeping on the bank of the stream, he held his black horse by the rein, he looked like a lion and a hero; his bridle, armour and saddle were thickly bedight with pearls; the rose (of his cheek) was frozen in tears that welled up from his woe-stricken heart.\n\n85. His form was clad in a long coat over which was thrown a panther's skin, his head, too, was covered with a cap of panther's skin; in his hand he held a whip thicker\n\n---\n\n1 Var. E. C. for midjnuroba reads siqvaruli.\n2 As a general rule Professor Marr's translation of gma, knight, and mona, slave, has been adopted throughout; but there are some cases where it seems doubtful if these are the proper equivalents: 998, 1112. In the West we have an analogy in \"knight\" and \"knecht\" (M., xlii., xxxiv.).\n3 Var. E. C. for khev't'hasa reads tqe't'hasa, \"of the woods,\" which rhymes better.\n4 Mogme.\n5 Cf. this passage with Orlando Furioso, i. 39, 40, where Sacripante, King of Circassia, \"par cangiato in insensibil pietra\"; Tariel's likeness to Peredur (Lady Charlotte Guest's Mabinogion, ed. 1877, p. 97) is still more striking.\n6 Caba.\n7 ? a coat (made) of panther's skin, with the hair outside. 201.\n8 vep'hkhvi, vep'hkhhi\u2014Felis pardus. Panther is preferred to leopard as the English rendering. Cf. Jer. xiii. 23 in the Georgian Bible. Bacchus was a man in the panther's skin; so, too, was Jason who appeared in Iolchos clad like Tariel; also Paris (Iliad, iii. 67). Cf. the leopard in English heraldry and in medieval poetry\u2014Li Panth\u00e8re d'Amours; also cf. note to 40. \"The Man in the Panther's Skin\" is the story of man enveloped in the passion spoken of in the introductory quatrains.\nthan a man's arm. They looked and liked to look at that wondrous sight.\\(^1\\)\n\n86. A slave went forth to speak to the knight of the woestricken\\(^2\\) heart, who, weeping with downcast head, seems not a spectacle for jesting\\(^3\\); from a channel of jet (his eyelashes) rains a crystal shower. When (the slave) approached, he could by no means bring himself to speak a word (to Tariel).\n\n87. The slave was much perturbed; he dared not address him. A long time he gazed in wonder till his heart was strengthened; then he said: \"(The king) commands thee (to attend him).\" He (the slave) came near, (and) greeted him gently; he (Tariel) wept on and heard not, he knew not that (the slave) was there.\\(^4\\)\n\n88. He heard not a word of the slave, nor what he said; he was wholly unconscious of the shouting of the soldiers, he was sobbing strangely, his heart burnt up with fires; tears were mingled with blood, and flowed forth as from floodgates.\\(^5\\)\n\n89. Elsewhither his mind was wafted, by the weight of his head!\\(^6\\) Once again the slave uttered the king's message, but (Tariel) ceased not from weeping and heard him not, nor was the rose-bouquet (of speech) plucked from his lips.\n\n90. Since he answered not, the slave went back and said to Rosten:\\(^7\\) \"I have told him what you said, but he will not listen. Mine eyes were dazzled as by the sun; my heart was sorely troubled. I could not make him hear a word though I have tarried there so long.\"\n\n91. The king wondered, he was wroth, he was vexed in heart against him. He sent the twelve slaves standing before him; he commanded: \"Take weapons of war in your hands; go and bring hither him who sits yonder.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) After this quatrain var. E. C. inserts one in which Rostevan orders a slave to go and summon Tariel. There is evidently something missing from the printed texts.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mdughare, boiling. 84.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ar dchreilith molizgharisad; lizghi. 1059.\n\n\\(^4\\) Car. \"The slave was surprised therat.\"\n\n\\(^5\\) Nagubari, dam, pool. 397.\n\n\\(^6\\) Car. interprets misman t'havisa tsonaman as an oath.\n\n\\(^7\\) i.e., Rostevan.\n92. The slaves went forth, they drew nigh to him, their armour clanked. Then indeed the knight started up, he wept still more woefully; he raised his eyes and looked round, he saw the band of warriors. But once he said, \"Woe is me!\" and spoke no word more.\n\n93. He passed his hands over his eyes, he wiped away the hot tears, he made fast his sabre\\(^1\\) and quiver,\\(^2\\) and braced his strong arms. He mounted his horse\u2014why should he heed the words of slaves?\\(^3\\) He wended his way elsewhither, and healed not their troubles.\n\n94. The slaves stretched forth their hands to seize that knight; he fell upon them\u2014alas! even their enemies would have pitied them; he beat one against another, he slew them without raising (on high) his hand, some with his whip he smote, cleaving them down to the breast.\n\n95. Wrathful was the king, and annoyed; he shouted to the slaves. The youth looked not back nor heeded his pursuers till they were upon him; as many as overtook him he made to look like dead men, he threw down man on man; Rosten lamented thereat.\n\n96. The king and Avt\u2019handil mounted to follow the youth. Proud and haughty, his form swayed to and fro,\\(^4\\) his steed was like Merani,\\(^5\\) the sun shone brightly on the field; he perceived that the king pursued him.\n\n97. When he saw that the king was come, he struck his horse with his whip; in that very moment he was lost, our eyes see him not; he seemed to have sunk into an abyss or flown to heaven; they sought, but could find no trace of his course.\n\n98. His footprints they sought, and marvelled to find no trace. Thus, leaving no vestige, the man passed away like a Devi.\\(^6\\) The soldiers mourned for their dead; they hastened to bind up the wounded. The king said: \u201cI have seen cause for loss of joy.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Khmali.\n\n\\(^2\\) Capardchi, 259, 355.\n\n\\(^3\\) Mona.\n\n\\(^4\\) M., \u201cStately and severe he rides, swaying his form\u201d\n\n\\(^5\\) The Pegasus of Georgian legend.\n\n\\(^6\\) Devi, 637, 672, 977, 1340, 1344.\n99. He said: \"God is weary of the happiness I have had hitherto, therefore He turns my pleasure into the gall of bitterness; He has wounded me unto death, none can cure me. Such, by His grace,\\(^1\\) is His will and desire.\"\n\n100. Thus he spoke, and returned; he went frowning away. They summoned not to the lists; groan was mingled with groan. Each ceased from the chase wherever he was following it. Some said: \"He is right!\" others said: \"O God!\" (?)\n\n101. The king went into his bedchamber sad and frowning. Avt'handil watched like a son that none save himself should follow; all went away, the household\\(^2\\) dispersed; merriment ceased, the castanet\\(^3\\) and the sweet harp.\\(^4\\)\n\n102. T'hinat'hin heard of her father's great sadness. She rose and came to the door; she with whom the sun strove asked the chamberlain: \"Sleeps he or wakes he?\" He answered: \"He sits brooding; his colour has suffered a change.\n\n103. \"Avt'handil alone is present; he sits in a chair before him. They have seen a certain stranger knight; this is the cause of his melancholy.\" T'hinat'hin said: \"I will now depart; it is not time for me to go in. When he asks for me, say: 'She was here but now.'\"\n\n104. Time passed; he inquired: \"What doth the maiden, my solace and jewel, my water of life?\" The chamberlain replied: \"She came, pale-faced, but now; she learned of your sadness and went away, but she is ready to come to your presence.\"\n\n105. He said: \"Go, call her; how can I bear absence from her! Say unto her: 'Why didst thou turn back, O life of thy father? Come, drive away my grief,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Car. reads mas vemadli; other editions, masve madli.\n\n\\(^2\\) Djalabi, P., 714.\n\n\\(^3\\) Chaghana, P., 704, 1444.

I will tell thee wherefore my joy is fled.'\"\n\n106. T'hinat'hin rose and came; she did as her father wished. The light of her face is like the splendour of the moon.\\(^1\\) Her father set her by his side, and, kissing her tenderly, gently,\\(^2\\) said: \"Why camest thou not to me? wert thou waiting till I sent for thee?\"\n\n107. The maiden said: \"O king, who, however venturesome, would dare to approach you aware that you were frowning? This sadness of yours upsets even the lights of heaven. Let a man seek to solve the difficulty; this, I think, would be better than grieving.\"\n\n108. He answered: \"O my child, however much this sad affair grieves me, thy sight and life cause me joy. My grief is dissipated as if I had taken an electuary.\\(^3\\) I believe that when thou knowest thou too wilt justify my sighing and groaning.\n\n109. \"I met a certain beautiful, wondrous youth; his ray enlightened the firmament\\(^4\\) and the bounds of the earth. I could not find out why he was afflicted, nor for whom he wept. He came not to see me; I was irritated and quarrelled with him.\n\n110. \"When he saw me, he mounted his horse and wiped the tears from his eyes. I cried out that he must be seized; he utterly destroyed my men; like an evil spirit,\\(^5\\) he was lost to me, he saluted\\(^6\\) me not like a man. Even now I know not whether he was real or a vision.\n\n111. \"His (God's) tender mercies at length have become thus bitter to me; I have forgotten the past days of my joy. Every one will make me sad and comfort me no more. However long my days may be, I can no more rejoice.\"\n\n112. The maid replied: \"Deign to hearken to my uttered\\(^7\\) words.

If not, it is a devil\\(^3\\) who has appeared to you to disturb your joys. Refrain from sadness. Why art thou become cheerless?\n\n114. \u201cThis is my advice: Thou art king, ruler over kings\\(^4\\); wide is your boundary, boundless is your power\\(^5\\); send everywhere men with news of this story; soon shall you know whether this youth be a mortal or not.\u201d\\(^6\\)\n\n115. He commanded men and sent them forth even to the four corners of the heavens, saying: \u201cGo, spare yourselves no pains; search, hunt for that youth, let nothing hinder you; send a letter whither ye cannot go nor attain.\u201d\n\n116. The men went, they wandered about for a year; they looked, they sought that youth, they inquired again and again. They could find none of God\u2019s creatures who had seen him. Wearied in vain, they returned, dissatisfied with themselves.\\(^7\\)\n\n117. The slaves said: \u201cO king, we have wandered over the lands, yet could we not find that youth, so we could not rejoice; we could meet no living man who had seen him; we have not been able to serve you, now devise some other plan.\u201d\n\n118. The king replied: \u201cMy daughter, my child, spoke truth. I have seen a hideous, unclean spirit; he has been sent as my foe, flying down from heaven. Grief is fled from me; I care nothing for all that.\u201d\\(^8\\)\n\n119.

What other did God create with generosity like unto his!\n\n120. Avt'handil sat alone in his chamber, clad only in an under-garment; he was singing and making merry, before him stood a harp. To him came T'hinat'hin's black slave, and said: \"She of the aloe form, the moon-faced one, sends for thee.\"\n\n121. Avt'handil was glad to hear this joyful news. He rose and donned his best and brightest coat. He rejoiced to meet the rose; they had never yet met alone. Pleasant is it to gaze on beauty, and be near one beloved.\n\n122. Proudly and boldly Avt'handil came to her; he was ashamed of none. He will see her for whom the tear of woe full oft had flowed. The peerless one sat mournful, she shone like lightning, her rays eclipsed the moon.\n\n123. Her fair form was clad in unlined ermine, she wore negligently veils whose price it were hard to tell; but her black, heart-piercing eyelashes and the thick, long tresses which embraced her white throat were her real adornments.\n\n124. Pensive she sat in her red veil; she quietly greeted Avt'handil, and gently bade him be seated. The slave placed a seat; he sat down modestly and respectfully. Face to face he gazed on her, full of great joy.\n\n125. The knight said: \"How indeed can I speak to one so dread! If the moon meet the sun it is consumed, it fades away. I am no longer at leisure to think; I fear for myself. Tell me, then, why you are sad and what will relieve you.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Perangi, P., shirt; 1331.\n2 Changi, P., 101, 472, 704.\n3 Mangi in Persian is \"moon\"; in Georgian, \"pearl.\"\n4 Caba, caftan; dchreli, variegated; 1465, 161.\n5 Gadzrtzili, stripped, naked.\n6 Qarqumi usapironi (Turkish qaqum, ermine), ermine on both sides.\n7 Gasagmironi, 23, 1269.\n8 Ar ukhshironi, not sparse, not infrequent.\n9 Coral-coloured\u2014dzotseli, 72, 524, 1439.\n10 Selni, plural of seli, Lat. sella.\n11 In Georgian mythology the sun is a female deity, and the moon male.\n126. The maiden replied with elegant words, not ill-chosen, saying: \"Although thou hast hitherto remained far from me, yet I wonder thou shouldst be timid even for a moment. But first I must tell thee of the malady which afflicts me, as a plague.\n\n127. \"Dost thou remember, when thou and Rostan\\(^1\\) killed game in the plain, how ye saw a certain stranger youth who wiped his tears away? Since then I have been a prey to thoughts of him. I beg thee to search for him, to seek him even to the bounds of the earth (within the bounds of the sky).\n\n128. \"Although I have been unable to hold converse with thee hitherto, yet from afar have I perceived thy love for me; I know that without pause the hail has fallen from thine eyes upon thy cheek.

Go, seek that brother-in-arms,\\(^4\\) be he near or far.\n\n130. \"Thereby shalt thou strengthen my love for thee; by delivering me from my sadness, thou shalt cripple\\(^5\\) the foul demon; plant the violet of hope in my heart, strew roses; then come, O lion, I shall meet thee like a sun; meet thou me.\\(^6\\)\n\n131. \"Seek three years him whom thou hast to seek; if thou find him, come gaily telling thy victory. If thou find him not, I shall believe he was a vision. Thou shalt meet the rosebud unwithered, unfaded.\n\n132. \"I swear if I wed any husband but thee, even should the sun become man, incarnate for my sake, may I be cut off for ever from Paradise, may I be swallowed up in Hell; love for thee would slay me, piercing my heart with a knife!\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. 95. \\(^2\\) Qma. \\(^3\\) Dasturi, which has a different meaning in P.; 315, 448, 975, 1267. \\(^4\\) Moqne. \\(^5\\) Sapqari, cripple, prisoner; 600, 1529. \\(^6\\) M, \"then return, O lion, to thy sun; I shall meet thee, thou shalt meet me.\"\n133. The knight replied: \"O sun, who causest the jet to blink,\\(^1\\) what have I said to thee, and what have I done to make thee suspect me? I awaited death; thou hast renewed my will to live.\\(^2\\) I shall certainly obey thee like a slave in service.\"\n\n134. Again he spoke: \"O sun, since God has created thee a sun, so that the heavenly planets obey thee wherever they may be, I have heard from you\\(^3\\) that which has overwhelmed me with grace; my rose shall not wither, thy ray shines generously upon it.\"\n\n135. Once more they made an oath together, they promised each other, they confirmed it and discoursed much, with many a word; what grief they had borne until now became easy. Their white teeth flashed white lightning as if transparent.\n\n136. They sat together, they made merry, they talked simply of a hundred things, they spoke with their crystal and ruby (faces) and jet (eyes). The knight said: \"Those who gaze upon thee become mad; my heart is burned to ashes by the fire that comes from thee.\"\\(^4\\)\n\n137. The youth went away, but he could not bear parting from her; he looked back, his eyes were dazed, crystal hails down and freezes the rose, his graceful form was trembling;\\(^5\\) he had heart for heart, he had lent (his) to love.\n\n138. He said to himself: \"O sun, separation from thee is thus early manifested on the rose; my crystal and ruby have faded, I am become yellower than amber.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Jet means \"eyes\" or \"eyelashes.\" The passage may also read, \"O sun with jet eyelashes.\" For this difficult quatrain, cf. Car., p. 269.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or, \"for thou hadst made life a torment to me.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) Such changes from the second person singular to the second person plural, or vice versa, are not uncommon. Cf. Visramiani, passim. Their object is, apparently, to show respect by the occasional use of a plural, majestatis.\n\n\\(^4\\) In this quatrain all the lines end with asadages in four different senses, of which the last (\"burned to ashes\") is the most usual. Such instances of a play upon words are common in the ode-writers of the period. Cf. Professor N. Marr's Odopistsi\u00e4. Var. E. C., l. 4, tzetzkhlmamandet'h modebulman guli chemidatzadages.\n\n\\(^5\\) M., \"strewing with a hail (of tears) the crystal (of his face), and freezing the roses (his cheeks), he swayed his fair form.\"\nshall I do, then, when I cannot see thee for a long time?

He lay down on his bed, he weeps, it is difficult for him to wipe away the tears,\\footnote{Var. E. C., tzkheli tzremli ekhotzebis, he wipes away the hot tear.} he shivered and swayed, like an aspen\\footnote{Verkhvi.} in the wind; when he fell into a slumber\\footnote{Miludnis. Cf. ruli, 877, 1184, 1193.} he dreamed his beloved was near, he starts, he cries out loud, his suffering increases twentyfold.\n\n140. Separation from his beloved made him jealous.\\footnote{Ghazo, A., P., ? faint, unconscious.} Tears like pearls were shed\\footnote{Var. E. C., tsvisms, rains.} upon the rose, making it tender. When day dawned he apparelled himself, fair to look upon; he mounted his horse, set out, and came to court for an audience.\n\n141. He sent a chamberlain\\footnote{Edjibi A.} into the hall of audience with a message from him to the king, saying: \u201cO king, I venture to tell you what I have thought: all the face of the earth is subjected to you by your sword; now, if it be better, I shall make known these tidings to all the vicinage.\n\n142. \u201cI will go, I shall travel, I shall wage war, I shall go the rounds of the marches,\\footnote{148, 162, 303, 388, 761. Cf. Dr. Bury\u2019s Romances of Chivalry, p. 17.} I shall, by piercing the heart of your enemies, announce T\u2019hinat\u2019hin\u2019s accession; I shall cause the obedient to rejoice, the disobedient will I make to weep, I shall send\\footnote{Var. E. C., gcadre.} you gifts incessantly, I shall not be sparing of greeting.\u201d\n\n143. The king expressed his great gratitude; he said: \u201cO lion, stretching thine arm in battle irks thee not.\\footnote{M., \u201che deigned to say: \u2018O lion, it is not characteristic of thee to avoid war.\u2019\u201d Var.

The knight came in; he did homage, and spoke some words of thanks: \"O monarch, I wonder that you should deign to praise me. Now God will perchance lighten for me the darkness of separation, and let me see again in joy your joyful face.\"\n\n145. The king hung upon his neck and kissed him like a son; like unto them have none been, neither upbringer nor upbrought. The knight rose and went away, to him their day seemed separated; Rostan, wise and soft-hearted, wept for him.\n\n146. Avt'handil set out, a brave knight marching boldly; twenty days he journeyed, many a day he made one with the night. She is the joy of the world, she is treasure and due; he puts not away the thought of T'hinat'hin, of her for whom the flame burns.\n\n147. Whenever he came there was rejoicing in the kingdom, nobles met him, they gave generous gifts; the sun-faced had not wasted time in his rapid journey. A dawning joy met them that came into his presence.\n\n148. He had a strong city to strike terror in the marches; outside was a rock, I tell thee, with an unmortared wall. The knight spent there three days in the pleasant chase; he appointed his pupil, Shermadin, as vizier.\n\n149. This is the slave Shermadin mentioned above, brought up with (Avt'handil), faithful and self-sacrificing to him. He knew not hitherto of the fire which burned the knight; now he (Avt'handil) revealed the hopeful words of the sun (T'hinat'hin).\n\n150. He said: \"Lo, Shermadin, for this I am ashamed before thee; thou knowest all my affairs and hast given heed to them; but hitherto thou hast not known what tears I have shed; in her from whom I had suffering I now find joy.\n\n---\n\n1 Var.

She gave me the balm of my heart, until that moment bound captive.\"\n\n153. \"First, I am a knight; I wish to go forth to serve my lady. Faithfulness to kings is fitting, vassal must act as vassal; then, she has extinguished the fire, my heart is no longer consumed to soot; a man must not bend before misfortune, but meet it like a man.\n\n154. \"Of all lords and vassals thou and I are most friendly; therefore I entreat thee to hear this from mine own mouth; in my stead I appoint thee lord and chief over mine armies, I could not entrust this matter to others.\n\n155. \"Lead forth the soldiers to battle, rule the nobles, send messengers to court telling the state of affairs, write letters in my stead, present priceless gifts; why should it be known that I am not here? (thou must not let my absence be perceived).\n\n156. \"Represent me in military duties and in the hunting-field, wait here for me three years, keep my secret; perchance indeed I shall return, my aloe-tree shall not fade; but if I come not back, mourn me, weep for me, utter sighs.\n\n157. \"Tell the king forthwith\u2014it is not a desirable\n\n---\n\n1 Var.

Remember my childhood; let thy heart be motherly\\(^3\\) towards me.\"\n\n159. When the slave\\(^4\\) heard this he wondered, he was alarmed, from his eyes the hot tears poured like pearls. He said: \"How can the heart deprived of thee rejoice? I know thou wilt not stay; so I cannot hinder thee in this matter.\n\n160. \"Why didst thou say thou wouldst appoint me in thy stead? How can I undertake the lordship, how can I imitate thee or resemble thee? It were better that the earth cradled me too than that I should have to think that thou art alone; rather let us both steal forth, I will accompany thee, take me with thee.\"\n\n161. The knight replied: \"Hearken unto me, I tell thee truth without beating about the bush:\\(^5\\) when a lover would roam the fields, alone he must wander; a pearl falls to the lot of none without buying and bargaining. An evil and treacherous man should be pierced with a lance.\n\n162. \"To whom could I tell my secret? save thee, none is worthy. To whom can I entrust the lordship save thee, who else can do it well?

He wrote as follows: \"My vassals, my instructors and some my pupils, faithful, trusty and tried, attentive to my behests like shadows, hearken to my letter all assembled!\n\n165. \"Give ear! I, Avt'handil, earth beneath your feet, write this unto you; with mine own hand have I written this epistle. For a little while I have preferred roaming to drink and song;\\(^4\\) for bread\\(^5\\) and meat I shall trust to my bow and thumb.\n\n166. \"I have in hand a certain matter which makes me journey to a far country; I depart alone, and this year shall I travel. I ask you only this: I beseech you let me find the realm unshaken\\(^6\\) by the foe.\n\n167. \"I have appointed Shermadin to be lord in my stead; until he learn of my life or death he will shine upon you all like the sun; he will make the rose to be frosted and not fade, he will cause all misdoers to melt away like wax.\\(^7\\)\n\n168. \"You know, too, how he has grown up with me like a brother and like a son; you must obey him as if he were Avt'handil; let him make to sound the trumpet,\\(^8\\) do everything as I have hitherto done; if I come not at the time appointed, mourning and not laughter will be seemly to you.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Car. has p'hasi. ? misprint for p'hlas\u0131.\n\n\\(^2\\) Khas\u0131, 44.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or knights, qma.\n\n\\(^4\\) Var.

The eloquent and nice-worded one ended this letter, he tied gold round his waist, habited himself to travel alone;\u00b9 he said: \u201cI shall mount in the plain.\u201d The soldiers formed in line, then they came forth; he tarried no time indoors.\n\n170. He said: \u201cLet all go hence; herein I need none as a partisan.\u201d He sent the slaves away also, he remained by himself, alone he withdrew himself, he hastened through the rushes. His slayer, T\u2019hinat\u2019hin, is always in his thoughts.\n\n171. He galloped over that plain; he was lost to the soldiers\u2019 sight. Whatever human being might have seen him and pursued him, his sword could not harm him; his arm was hampered.\u00b2 He was heavy laden with a burden of grief for her sake.\n\n172. When the soldiers hunted and sought their lord, and could no longer find the sun-faced, their countenances paled, their great joy turned into heaviness, they ran everywhere to seek him, whoever had a swift horse.\n\n173. O lion, whom can God put in thy place! They ran and brought out other messengers from elsewhere; they could learn nothing of him; he passed from that place. His disheartened hosts shed hot tears.\n\n174. Shermadin assembled together the courtiers and nobles; he showed them the letter in which he (Avt\u2019handil) had told them his tidings. When they heard it, all remained heart-pierced, they beat themselves, there was not a tearless heart, not an unbruised breast.\n\n175. All said: \u201cThough our state without him is irksome to us, to whom save thee could he give his seat and throne? Of a truth we shall obey thee, whatever thou commandest any of us.\u201d They made that vassal lord; all did him homage.\n\n\u00b9 Sagharibod; gharibi, A., 166, 209, 242, 356, 394, 486, 783, 1195, 1562.\n\u00b2 M. Tseret\u2019heli suggests: \u201cWho could see him, who could pursue him? Only One who is invulnerable by the sword (i.e., God); His mighty hand followed him.\u201d\nIV\n\nAVT'HANDIL SETS FORTH IN QUEST OF TARIEL\n\n176. Dionosi\u00b9 the wise, Ezros\u00b2 bear me witness in this:\nIt is pitiable when the rose wherewith the ruby of Bada-\nkhshan\u00b3 is not to be compared and whereto a reedstem\nserves as form,\u2074 becomes covered with rime and frost-bitten;\nwherever he wanders abroad he is wearied of abodes.\n\n177. Avt'handil travelled over that plain at a flying\npace,\u2075 he left the bounds of the Arabs, he journeyed in\nforeign lands; but separation from his sun had taken\naway part of his life; he said: \"If I were near her now\nI should not shed hot tears.\"\n\n178. Fresh snow had fallen, and, freezing on the rose,\nblasted it. He wished to strike his heart; sometimes he\nuplifted his knife. He said: \"Fate (the world) has in-\ncreased my grief ninety, an hundred fold. I have gone\naway from all rejoicing,\u2076 from harp, lyre\u2077 and pipe.\"\u2078\n\n179. The rose separated from its sun faded more and\nmore. He said to his heart: \"Be patient!\" Thus he\nfainted not wholly. He journeyed through passing strange\nplaces on his quest, he asked tidings of wayfarers, he was\nfriendly with them.\n\n180. There seeks he the shedder of tears which flowed\nto increase the sea. The land seems to him a couch, his\n\n\u00b9 ? the Areopagite. Cf. 1468. ? a spurious quatrain.\n\u00b2 Ezra; but, according to Abul, ezros probably means \"agrees,\"\n\"thinks,\" and is from azri, opinion.\n\u00b3 Var. E.

He says to himself: \"O beloved, I am far from thee, my heart stays with thee\\(^1\\); I lament, for thy sake death would be joy to me.\"\n\n181. He journeyed over all the face of the earth, he went thoroughly over it, so that beneath heaven was no place left where he had not been; but he met none who had heard tidings of him he sought; meanwhile three years save three months had passed.\n\n182. He arrived in a certain dreadful country, exceeding rough; for a month he saw no man, no son of Adam. Neither Vis nor Ramin\\(^2\\) saw such woe like unto his. By day and by night he thought of her, his beloved.\n\n183. He reached as a resting-place\\(^3\\) the slope\\(^4\\) of a great high mountain; thence appeared a plain which it would take seven days to cross. At the foot of the mountain flowed a river that could not be bridged;\\(^5\\) both sides were covered down to the water's edge with forests.\n\n184. He goes up,\\(^6\\) turns round (?) and counts the time, the remaining days\u2014he has two months left. He sighs at this, he rejoices not.\\(^7\\) \"Alas! if the thing were revealed!\" Again he is timid in heart by reason of this. No man\\(^8\\) can turn evil to good; none can be born again of himself.\n\n185. He became thoughtful; he stood to consider the matter. He said to himself: \"If I return thus, why have I spent so much time in the field? What can I dare say to my star, how I have spent the days? I have learned not even gossip\\(^9\\) regarding him I seek.\n\n186. \"If I return not, I must spend yet more time in the quest, if I can learn no tidings of him I seek; when\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Var.

Then would there be mourning, weeping; bitter would the matter be for them. Thereafter should I return after travelling everywhere.\" On this he thinks, weeping, distressed in mind.\n\n188. He said: \"O God, why make Thy judgments crooked because of me? why, alas! should I have made such a journey in vain? Thou hast rooted up joys from my heart; Thou hast given griefs a nest there. All my days my tears will never cease.\"\n\n189. Then he said, \"Patience is better,\" and communed thus with himself: \"Let me not die a day too soon, cast not down my heart; without God I can do nothing, my tears flow in vain. No one can change that which is decreed; that which is not to be will not be.\"\\(^3\\)\n\n189a. He said to himself: \"Die, for thee it is better than shameful life.\\(^4\\) Thou wilt go back; T'hinat'hin, who brightens the sunny day, will meet thee; she will ask thee for tidings of that sun; what does groaning avail?\" Thus thinking, he forthwith sets out for the reedy, watery edge of the wood.\n\n190. \"All beings under the heavens have surely passed me by in turn, but regarding that man nought can I learn anywhere. Doubtless they who called him a Kadj\\(^5\\) spoke truth. Now tears avail me not; why should I weep in vain?\"\n\n190a.

He resolved to return, he sighed and groaned; he turned towards the plain; he traced out the road with his eyes; for a month he has seen no human being anywhere; there were terrible wild beasts, but he hunted them not.\u00b2\n\n192. Though Avt'handil was become wild with heart-groaning and sighing, yet he wished to eat, after the wont of Adam's race; he killed game with his arrow, with arm longer than Rostom's\u00b3; he alighted on the edge of the reedy ground and kindled a fire with a steel.\n\n193. He let his horse pasture while he roasted the meat. He saw six\u2074 horsemen coming towards him. He said: \"They look like brigands\u2075; else what good is to be found? No other human being has ever been here.\"\n\n194. He took his bow and arrow in his hand, and went gaily towards them. Two bearded men were leading their beardless brother,\u2076 his head was wounded, his heart had swooned from loss of blood; they wept and grieved, his poor spirit was almost fled.\n\n195. He called out: \"Brothers, who are ye? I took you for brigands.\" They replied: \"Be calm, help us and put out the fire\u2077; if thou canst not help us, add grief to our grief, and make it complete; weep with us who need pity, scratch thy cheeks too.\"\n\n196. Avt'handil approached; he spoke to the men with the grieved hearts. They told him their story, speaking with tears: \"We are three brothers, for this we shed bitter tears; we have a large fortified town in the region of Khataet'hi.\u2078\n\n197. \"We heard of good hunting ground, we went forth\n\n\u00b9 Ch.

We remained alone, we were private, we killed in our own sight, we shot not before onlookers.\n\n200. \"We had three armour-bearers (squires) with us; we ordered the soldiers to go away, mistrusting nought; we hunted over plain, through wood and den,\\footnote{Ghre.} we slaughtered the wild beast, and not even a bird flew up.\n\n201. \"Suddenly there appeared a knight,\\footnote{Moqme.} morose and gloomy of visage, seated on a black horse, black as Pegasus\\footnote{Merani. Cf. 96.} ; his head and form were clad in a panther's skin with the fur outside,\\footnote{85.} and beauty such as his has ne'er been seen by man before.\n\n202. \"We gazed upon his rays, we scarce could support the brightness, we said: 'He is a sun on the earth; we cannot say (there is a sun) in heaven.' We wished to seize him, we were venturesome and tried; this is the cause of our sighs, moans, weeping.\n\n203. \"I, the eldest, earnestly begged the man from the younger, my next brother asked for his horse as a keepsake, this one only asked leave to conquer\\footnote{Morevna; 589, momereodes; 1124, morevs.} him. We granted him this as his due. As we went towards him he came forward unchanged, calmly and in beauty.\"\n204. \"Ruby mingled with crystal beautified\\(^1\\) the pale roses (of his cheeks). He withered up tender thoughts towards us, he explained nothing, neither did he let us go,\\(^2\\) he showed not any consideration for us at all, with his whip he ripened us who had spoken tartly to him.\n\n205. \"We gave him over to our youngest brother, we elders kept back, he seized upon him (and said): 'Stand!' Thus he spake to him with his tongue. He (Tariel) held no sword in his hand, so we moved away; he struck him on the head with his whip, we saw the blood flow indeed.\n\n206. \"With a stroke of his whip he cleft his head thus, like a corpse he became lifeless, like earth he was brought to earth; thus he humbled, levelled with the ground, him who had been audacious to him. Before our eyes he went away, bold, severe and haughty.\n\n207. \"He turned not back again; he went away quietly and without haste. Lo! there he rides\u2014look! like the sun and moon.\" The weeping ones joylessly showed him far off to Avt'handil; there only appeared his black steed carrying along that sun.\n\n208. Behold, it befell Avt'handil that his cheeks need no longer be covered with snow from tears, since he had not passed so much time abroad in vain; when a man attains the thing wished for, when he must find what he sought, then need he no longer remember past woes.\n\n209. He said: \"Brothers, I am a wanderer without a place. To seek that knight I have gone far from the home of my upbringing. Now from you I have learned what it was by no means easy to discover. May God never again give you cause to grieve.\n\n210. \"As I meet my wish, my heart's desire, so even may God not let your brother suffer.\" He showed them his resting-place. \"Go at your ease,\"\\(^3\\) said he, \"give him repose in the shade, rest your weary selves.\"\n\n211. Thus he spoke and went his way, he spurred\\(^4\\) on his horse, he flew like a hawk\\(^5\\) not hindered by the string,\n\n\\(^1\\) Natiphi, P., 1104, 1312.\n\\(^2\\) Akhsna, dakhsha (?).\n\\(^3\\) Neba nebaso, 106, or slowly.\n\\(^4\\) Dezi, rowel.\n\\(^5\\) Gavazi (P.).\nor like the moon meeting the sun, the sun of heavenly light, for this cause he has extinguished his burning fires.\n\n212. He drew nearer, he bethought himself how he might contrive the meeting: \"Senseless converse yet more enrages a madman. If a wise man would compass a difficult deed, he must not lose his presence of mind and tranquillity.\"\n\n213. \"Since yon man is so unreasoning and dazed that he suffers not any to speak with him or look on him, if I go up we shall meet only to slaughter each other, either he will kill me or I shall kill him; he will be still more hidden.\"\n\n214. Avt'handil said: \"Why should I suffer so many woes in vain? Whatever he is, it cannot be that he has no nests; let him go whithersoever he will, whatever walls encompass him there shall I seek him if my powers fail not.\"\n\n215. Two days and nights they fared, one behind, one before, wearied by day and by night, eating no food: nowhere they paused, not one moment of time, from their eyes tears flowed, moistening the plains.\n\n216. One day they travelled, and at eventide high rocks appeared. In the rocks were caves, in front a stream flowed down, it was not possible to say how many rushes were at the water's edge, tall trees whose tops eye could not reach rose high against the rock.\n\n217. The knight made for the cave; he passed the streams and rocks. Avt'handil alighted from his horse, he betook himself to the great trees, he climbed up to look, at the foot he tethered his horse, thence he watched; that knight went shedding tears.\n\n218. When the knight, the panther-skin-clad, passed the\n\n---\n\n1 For zesit'ha some read zezit'ha, and the phrase would then mean \"the sun, the most brilliant of lights, apparelled in cloth of gold.\" Cf. Abul., p. 172 (?).\n\n2 Or, \"inspire hatred and disturb peace of mind by reproaches.\"\n\n3 Or, \"seek some other means which would succeed.\" The reading is dasamrudeni, but if we accept Car., dasamdureni, the passage runs, \"means which will not anger him.\"\nwoods, a maiden dressed in a black mantle came forth to the door of the cave, she wept aloud, her tears uniting with the sea; the knight dismounted, with his arms he embraced her neck.\n\n218a. The knight said: \"Sister Asmat'h, our bridges are fallen into the sea (i.e., we are lost); we shall never, timely, come upon the track of her for whom fires burn us.\" Thus he spoke and beat his hands upon his breast; the tears rained down. The maiden swooned, he embraced her; they wiped each other's tears of blood.\n\n219. The forest became thicker from the tearing of their hair; each embraced the other, the youth the maid, and the maid the youth; they wailed, they lamented, the rocks re-echoed their voices; Avt'handil gazed in wonder on their behaviour.\n\n220. That maid composed her soul, she endured the wound of her heart, she led the steed into the cave, she took off its trappings, she unbuckled the knight, she ungirded his armour. They went in. That day passed to its close.\n\n221. Avt'handil was surprised. \"How am I to know this story?\" said he. Day dawned. The maiden came forth clad in the same colour; she put the bridle on the black (horse), she furbished it (the bridle) with the end of her veil; she saddled it, she carries the armour quietly, with no clattering.\n\n222. It was the custom, it seems, with that knight never to tarry longer. The maiden wept and beat her breast, she tore her thick hair; they embraced each other, he kissed her and mounted his horse. Asmat'h, already gloomy, became still more gloomy.\n\n223. Avt'handil once more saw near him the face of that man, his moustaches had hardly grown, he was without\n\n---\n\n1 Djuba, A., 465.\n2 Cf. 259, 340, a great river.\n3 P., chastity, honour.\n4 Ch. 221, omitted in later editions.\n5 Tevri.\n6 Moqme.\n7 Tevri, thick forest; 219.\n8 Daghreja, to have a pained expression; 848.\n9 Ch., \"with upturned moustaches\"; ashla, to rouse.\na beard. \"Is it not the sun of heaven?\" said he. He smelt the smell of the aloe wafted on the wind. For him the killing of a lion was just as easy as for a lion to kill a goat.\n\n224. He rode out the same road he had come in by the day before, he passed the rushes, he went beyond, far into the plain. Avt'handil gazed in wonder; secretly he was hidden in the tree. He said: \"God has managed this matter exceeding well for me.\n\n225. \"How could God have done better for me than this? I will seize the maid, I will make her tell me the story of that knight; I shall also tell her all mine, I shall make her know the truth. I shall not smite the knight with the sword, nor shall I have to be pierced by him.\"\n\n226. He came down and loosed his horse, which he had tied to the tree, he mounted and rode up; the door of the cave was open, the heart-shaken tear-flooded maiden ran out thence; she thought the rose-faced, crystal-haloed one was come back.\n\n227. She knew not the face, it was not like the face of that knight; swiftly she turned, with a cry she made for rock and tree; the knight leaped from his horse, seized her like a partridge in a net; the rocks resounded with the maid's monotonous cry.\n\n228. She yielded not to that knight; even the sight of him was hateful. Like a partridge under an eagle she fluttered hither and thither; she called on a certain Tariel for help, but he succoured her not. Avt'handil threw himself on his knees; he entreated her with his fingers.\n\n229. He said: \"Hush! what (ill) can I do thee? I am a man of Adam's race. I have seen those roses and violets grown pale. Tell me something of him. Who is the cypress-formed, the halo-faced? I shall do nought else to thee, be comforted, cry not thus loudly.\"\n\n1 Alva. 2 Vatzi, he-goat; 1182.\n3 Mdughare, boiling.\n4 Baemuli, bacmiani. Cf. Arm. bak, nimbus, aureole; 229, 1410.\n230. The weeping girl, like a suppliant for justice,\\(^1\\) said:\n\"If thou be not mad, let me go; if thou art mad, return to reason. Now thou lightly askest me to tell thee a very hard matter; try not in vain, look not to me to tell his story.\"\n\n231. Again she said: \"O knight, what wilt thou, or what dost thou request of me? This thing cannot be even written with the pen. Once thou shalt say 'Tell me!' a hundred times I shall tell thee 'No!' As smiling is better than weeping, so I prefer mourning to song.\"\n\n232. \"Maiden, thou knowest not whence I come, what woes I have endured! For as long as I have sought tidings, from none have I heard them. I have found thee; however much my words may annoy thee, I cannot let thee go till thou tell me. Be not bashful with me.\"\n\n233. The maiden said: \"Why have I fallen in with thee? Who am I? or who art thou? The sun is not near me, this thou knewest, O hoarfrost, therefore thou thus annoyest me; long discourse is tedious, so I shall speak shortly to thee; on no account shall I tell thee aught, do whatsoever thou wilt.\"\n\n234. Yet again he adjured her, he threw himself on his knees before her, but nought could he win from her; he wearied of entreaty, his indignation mounted to his face, blood flowed to his eyes, he arose, he drew her by the hair, he put a knife to her throat.\n\n235. Thus he spoke: \"How can I forgive thee so much ill-will? If I weep, shall the tear be in vain? It is better for thee to tell me, I shall trouble thee no more; if not, may God slay mine enemy as I slay thee!\"\n\n236. The maid replied: \"Thou hast done exceeding ill to think of using force. If thou kill me not I shall not die; I am hale and alive. Why shall I tell thee anything until the time when I shall no longer see woes, and if thou kill me I shall have no head to converse with thee.\"\n\n237. Again she said: \"Oh, why didst thou find me! who\n\n\\(^1\\) M. Tseret'heli translates: \"Her speech was more like discussion than complaint.\"\nart thou that speakest with me? Who? I cannot be made to tell this story with living tongue. I will make thee kill me at mine own wish; like a despised letter, easily shalt thou tear me.\n\n238. \"Think not that death would be suffering to me, for it would free me from weeping; it is the drier-up of the ford\\(^1\\) of tears; the whole world seems to me as straw, even so do I weigh it;\\(^2\\) I know not who thou art, that I should tell thee trusty words?\"\n\n239. The knight said (to himself): \"Thus shall I not make her speak, I must think of some other way; it is better to ponder the matter.\" He let her go, and sat down apart; he wept, he began to shed tears. He said to the maiden: \"I have angered thee; now I know not, alas! how I shall survive.\"\\(^3\\)\n\n240. The maiden sat morose, she is sulky, she is not yet sweetened. Avt'handil sits below weeping; no longer does he speak. In the rose-garden the pool of tears is dammed up. The maiden, too, weeps over yonder, her heart softening towards him.\n\n241. She pitied the weeping knight, therefore her hot tears flowed, but she sat, strange to the stranger, she spake not. The knight perceived that her hasty thoughts towards him were calmed; with flowing tears he entreated her; he arose and bent his knee before her.\n\n242. He said: \"I know that now I am by no means worthy to hope from thee\\(^4\\); I have angered thee; I remain a stranger to thee and thus lonely; yet even now I have hope for myself from thee, for it is said that sin shall be forgiven unto seven times.\n\n243. \"Though my beginning in service has pleased thee ill, it is fitting to pity the lover; understand thou this: from any other, whomsoever, I can have no aid, none is\n\n\\(^1\\) P'honi, pool, ford; but Abul. says \"fountain, spring, gurgling streamlet.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. 1006.\n\n\\(^3\\) Davrche va.\n\n\\(^4\\) Var. E. C. for vargkhar shen ats chemad reads vargvar chemad shengan.\nmy strength. I yield thee my life for my heart's sake. What more can I do?\"\n\n244. When the maid heard from the knight of his love, with heart sobs she began to shed tears a hundredfold more; again she raised her voice in wailing, she smiled not. God gave Avt'handil his wish, his heart's comfort.\n\n245. He said (to himself): \"These words have changed her colour; doubtless her tears flow faster (for that) she is mad for someone.\" He spoke once more: \"O sister, a lover is pitied even by his foes; thou, too, knowest that he himself seeks death, he shuns it not.\n\n246. \"I am a lover, a madman to whom life is unbearable. My sun sent me to seek that knight. Even a cloud could not reach me where I have been on that quest. I have found thy heart; his to thee, thine to him.\n\n247. \"His face I have imprinted on my heart like a (holy) picture.\\(^1\\) For him mad, cut off, have I given up all\\(^2\\) my joy. One of two things do thou to me: make me a prisoner or set me free,\\(^3\\) give me life or slay me, adding grief to grief.\"\n\n248. The maiden spoke to the knight a word more pleasant than her first: \"What thou hast now thought of is much better; just now thou didst sow enmity in my heart, now thou hast found in me a friend more sisterly than a sister.\n\n248a. \"Then, since thou hast thought of love as thine aid, henceforth it will not be that I shall not be thy servant; if I devote not myself to thee, I shall make thee mad, I shall make thee sad; I shall die for thy sake if I find not some means to help thee.\\(^4\\)\n\n249. \"Now, whatever I tell thee, if thou wilt be obedient to me therein thou shalt meet whatever thou seekest, thou shalt certainly not fail; if thou hearkenest not to me thou shalt not find, let thy tears flow\\(^5\\) as they will; discontent with the world shall come upon thee, thou shalt die, thou shalt be put to shame.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Khati, A., P.; 1349, 1441.\n\\(^2\\) Alkati, 1441.\n\\(^3\\) Azati, P.\n\\(^4\\) Not in some editions; Ch., No. 252.\n\\(^5\\) Mili, 284, 1435.\n250. The knight replied: \"This only resembles one thing (This is like a certain story): Two men were journeying somewhere along some road; the one who was behind saw the one in front fall into a well. He came up, called down, weeps and cries 'Woe!'\n\n251. \"Thus he spoke: 'Comrade, stay there, wait for me, I go to bring ropes, I want to pull thee out.' The man who was beneath laughed, he marvelled greatly, he shouted up: 'Unless I wait, whither can I flee from thee, whither can I go?'\n\n252. \"Now, sister, thou holdest the rope about my neck; without thee I can undertake nothing; whatever thou doest to me rests with thee, thou art balm to the mad. Otherwise who would bind his sound head with hay-ropes? (? like a madman).\"\n\n253. The maid replied: \"Thy discourse, O knight, pleases me. Doubtless thou art some good knight,\\(^1\\) worthy of the praise of the wise. Since thou hast heretofore suffered such griefs, hearken to what I tell thee, and thou shalt find what thou seekest.\n\n253a. \"Nowhere can news of that knight\\(^1\\) be found. If he himself tell thee not it will not be told; none other shouldst thou believe. If thou canst wait so long, wait until he come. Be calm; freeze not the rose, let it not be snowed up in tears.\\(^2\\)\n\n254. \"I will tell thee our names if thou wishest to know them: Tariel is the name of that distracted knight\\(^1\\); I am called Asmat'h, whom the hot fire burns, sigh upon sigh, not once alone, but many times.\n\n255. \"More words about him than these I cannot tell thee. The elegant, slender-formed roams the plain. I eat, alas! alone of the meat brought by him from the chase. He may come anon, I know not, or he may tarry a long time.\n\n256. \"I entreat thee to wait; go not elsewhere. When he comes I shall plead with him; it may be I shall be able to do something. I shall make you known to each other;\n\n\\(^1\\) Moqme. \\(^2\\) Ch., 258; quatrain omitted in Car.\nI shall make him love thee. He himself will tell thee his story; thou shalt make thy beloved to rejoice.\"\n\n257. The knight listened to the maid, he was obedient, he submitted. Thereupon they looked round, they heard a splash from the glen, they saw the moon (i.e., Tariel) come forth from the water, its rays beaming. They hastened back; they made no long tarrying there.\n\n258. The maid said: \"O knight, God give thee soon what thou desirest; but make thyself unseen, hide thyself inside. No human being is disobedient to that knight; perchance I may so contrive that the sight of thee anger him not.\"\n\n259. The maiden hastily hid Avt'handil secretly in the cave. That knight alighted from his horse; his quiver\\(^1\\) and sword adorn him. They wept aloud, their tears flowing even to the sea.\\(^2\\) Avt'handil gazed from the window,\\(^3\\) himself hidden from view.\n\n260. The bath of tears turned the crystal to the colour of jasper.\\(^4\\) A long time the knight and that black-robed maiden wept. She unbuckled his armour and took it in; she also led in the horse. They were silent; the black knife of jet (of their eyelashes) cut off the (flow of) tears.\n\n261. Avt'handil watched from the window, a prisoner but now freed from his dungeon.\\(^5\\) The maid laid down the panther's skin,\\(^6\\) the knight sat upon it, he sighs with added grief; the jetty eyelashes\\(^7\\) are plaited by tears of blood.\n\n262. That maiden betook herself to the lighting of a gentle fire with a steel; she thought he would eat meat roasted, (a bird cooked) whole; she gave it to him, he bit off a piece, it was difficult for him to eat, he had no appetite; he began to spit it out unchewed.\\(^8\\)\n\n263. He lay down a little, he fell asleep, but only for a short time; he was afraid, he screamed aloud, he leaped up as if dazed, he cried and incessantly beat his breast\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Capardchi, 93, 355.  \n\\(^{2}\\) 218.  \n\\(^{3}\\) Sarcmeli, 261, 1106, 1113.  \n\\(^{4}\\) Amarti, ? amber.  \n\\(^{5}\\) Sacani.  \n\\(^{6}\\) Natebi, nata; 601, gavanatenith.  \n\\(^{7}\\) Gishrisa satebi, jet shelters or tents.  \n\\(^{8}\\) 903.\nwith a stone\\(^1\\) and his head with a stick;\\(^2\\) the maiden sits apart looking at him, and scratches her face.\n\n264. \"Why hast thou returned?\" she asked. \"Tell me what has happened to thee.\" He answered: \"I came upon a certain king hunting; he had countless soldiers, heavy weighed their baggage, he hunted in that plain where beaters were scattered.\n\n265. \"It was melancholy for me to see men, the fire flamed up still more; I came not near to meet him; I pitied myself. I returned pale from them. I hid in the wood. I thought: 'If he pursues me no more, I shall go away at daybreak to-morrow.'\"\n\n266. The maiden's tears sprang forth an hundredfold, ten thousandfold more. She said: \"Thou roamest alone with wild beasts in the deep forest, thou approachest no man for converse and entertainment; thou canst not help her thus; why dost thou waste thy days in vain?\n\n267. \"Thou hast fared over the whole face of the earth; how couldst thou not find one man in whom to take pleasure, and who could be with thee without making thee mad, though it would not lessen thy grief? If thou diest and she perishes, what doth this profit thee?\"\n\n268. He said: \"O sister, this is like thy heart, but for this wound there is no balm upon earth. Who can find such a man as hath not yet come into the world? My joy is death, the severance of flesh and soul.\n\n269. \"Where, why should God cause a man to be born under the same planet as I, even if I desired his companionship and converse! Who could bear my woes, or even attempt it? Save thee, sister, I have no human being anywhere.\"\n\n270. The maid said: \"Be not angry with me, I fear and entreat thee; since God has appointed me thy vizier, I cannot conceal the best that I know in the matter: to go to extremes is of no use; thou hast overstepped the bounds.\"\n\n271. The knight replied: \"I know not what thou askest\n\n\\(^1\\) Lodi, ? tombstone. \\(^2\\) Ceti, 1020, 1021, club.\nof me; tell me clearly. How can I create a man for my service without God? God needs me to be unhappy; what can I do? Of a truth I am become as a wild beast, to this pass have I brought myself.\"\n\n272. The maid again spoke: \"I have harassed thee with overmuch advice, but if I could find a man who would come to thee of his own freewill, who would stay near thee, who would rejoice thee by his acquaintance, wilt thou swear not to kill him nor do him any hurt?\"\n\n273. He answered: \"If thou wilt show him to me, greatly shall I rejoice at sight of him. (I swear) by the love of her for whose sake I wander mad in the fields, I shall do nought unpleasing, I shall never cause any bitterness to him; I shall be pleasant and love him, and do all I can to be amiable.\"\n\n274. The maid rose and went to bring that knight. \"He is not angry,\" quoth she, to encourage him. She took him by the hand and led him forth, like the full moon. When Tariel saw him he thought him like the sun.\n\n275. Tariel met him. They were both fit to be ranked as suns, or as the moon in heaven, cloudless, spreading her rays on the plain beneath. Compared with them the aloe-tree was of no worth; they were like the seven planets;\u00b9 to what else shall I liken them?\n\n276. They kissed each other, they were not bashful at being strangers; they opened the rose, from their lips their white teeth shone transparent. They embraced each other's neck, together they wept; their jacinth, which was worth rubies, they turned into amber.\n\n277. The knight turned, he grasped Avt'handil's hand in his hand; they sat down together, and wept long with hot tears. Asmat'h calmed them with wonderful words: \"Slay not yourselves; darken not the sun with your eclipse.\"\n\n278. Tariel's rose was only covered with a light frost, not frozen. He said to (Avt'handil): \"Haste, tell me thy secret. Who art thou? Whence art thou come? Where is thy\n\n\u00b9 944, 1385, 1515.\nhome? As for me, death has forgotten me; even by it am I abandoned.\"\n\n279. Avt'handil gave answer; beautiful are his words\u00b9:\n\"O lion and hero Tariel, thou who behavest gently, I am an Arabian, from the court of Arabia; I am consumed by love, unquenchable fire burns me.\n\n280. \"I love the daughter of my lord; her lusty-armed servants now view her as their king. Though thou knowest me not, I have seen thee, if thou wilt call it to mind. Dost thou remember when thou slewest the strong-armed slaves?\n\n281. \"We saw thee roaming in the plain, and we came upon thee. My lord was angry with thee, and we quarrelled fiercely with thee. We called thee, thou camest not, we pursued thee with soldiers; thou didst dye the fields crimson with the blood thou madest to flow.\n\n282. \"Thou didst cut the heads of all with a whip, without a sword. The king mounted, thou wert lost to us, we could not cut off thy track; like a Kadj\u00b2 thou wert hidden, the slaves were terrified.\u00b3 This enraged us still more; we were completely stunned.\n\n283. \"The king became gloomy; you know that a monarch also has humours. They looked for thee, they sought thee everywhere, they wrote a letter of command.\u2074 They could find none who had seen thee, neither young\u2075 nor old. Now she has sent me, she to whom neither sun nor ether is to be compared.\n\n284. \"She said to me: 'Learn for me news of that vanished sun; then will I do that which thou desirest.' She told me that for three years the stream\u2076 of tears was to flow without her; dost thou not marvel that I could bear the lack of the sight of her smile?\n\n285. \"Until now I have seen no man who saw thee.

Tariel recalled their bygone fight. He said: \"I remember the affair, though it happened long ago. I saw thee and thy master together at the chase. I was weeping because I was thinking, alas! of my destroyer.\n\n287. \"What did you want with me? What did you desire? What had we in common? You, mighty, were sporting; we bathed our cheeks in tears. When you set the slaves upon me you dared to take me; now, methinks, instead of capturing me you bare away corpses.\n\n288. \"I looked round when I saw thy lord approach me, I had pity on his kingship; therefore I laid not my hands upon him, I fled before your eyes, I said nothing. My horse looks invisible: in what other way shall I describe him?\n\n289. \"Before a man can blink or wink the eye, I can flee that which I know to be unpleasant.

He said to Asmat'h: \"Since thou hast been near me all the time, how dost thou not know that this bruised bruise is incurable? Anew this weeping knight burns me; I am his debtor for tears.\"\n\n296.

He sent a message: 'I, ruler of the lands, give thanks to God, because thou, a king like me enthroned in India, hast done this; now come, I shall honour thee like a brother and parent.'\n\n306. \"He bestowed on him one kingdom well worthy of a good knight (or vassal\\(^1\\)), also the dignity of Amirbar (Grand Marshal)\u2014the Amirbar in India is also Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief); when he sat as king, he was not absolute: he only lacked the overlordship,\\(^2\\) in all else he was sovereign lord.\\(^3\\)\n\n307. \"The king considered my father equal with himself; he said: 'I wager that no man has an Amirbar like mine.' They waged war and they hunted; they forced their enemies to make peace. I am not like him, as no other man is like me.\n\n308. \"The king and the sunlike queen had no child, for this they were sad; a time came when the armies were seized with alarm thereat. Woe befall that cursed day when I was given (born) to the Amirbar! The king said: 'I shall rear him as my son; he is even of mine own race.'\n\n309. \"The king and queen took me as their child, they brought me up as lord of all the soldiers and countries, they gave me wise men to instruct me in the behaviour and deportment of kings.

Those who saw me said: 'He is like a nursling of Eden.' My person now is but a shadow of what it was then.\n\n312. \"I was five years old when the queen became with child.\" When he had said this the youth sighed, and weeping said: \"She bare a daughter.\" He was like to faint; Asmat'h sprinkled water on his breast. He said: \"She for whom these flames now burn me was like the sun even then.\\footnote{I.e., new-born.

P'harsadan sat down to announce the good news with jubilation and pomp. From everywhere came kings bringing many kinds of gifts. They gave away treasure; they filled the soldiers with presents.\n\n314. \"The guests at the birth festivities separated. They began to rear me and the maiden; even then she was like the sun's rays augmented threefold; the king and queen loved us and looked on us alike. Now shall I utter the name of her for whom my heart is consumed by flame.\"\n\n315. The knight swooned when he sought to mention her name.

When he had wept for some time he again began to tell his tale: \"One day the king and I had come home from the chase, and he said: 'Let us see my daughter!'\n\n\\(^1\\) It diminished his prestige.\n\\(^2\\) Sacargavi (cf. sacarg, 306), titles, possessions, superintendence.\n\\(^3\\) Zeimi, 305.\n\\(^4\\) Ch. here inserts a quatrain (336) omitted by later editors.\nHe took me by the hand. . . . Does it not surprise thee that I live when I remember that time?\n\n329. \"I saw the garden fairer indeed than all places of delight: the voice of birds was heard, sweeter than a siren's,\\(^1\\) there were many fountains of rose-water for baths,\\(^2\\) over the door were hung curtains of cloth of gold.\\(^3\\)\n\n330. \"The king ordered me to take some wood-partridges\\(^4\\) and carry them to the maiden. I took them and went to burn myself at a flame. Then I began to pay the debt of Fate. It needs a lance of adamant to pierce a heart of rock.\\(^5\\)\n\n331. \"I knew he wished none to see his sunlike one; I stood outside, and the king went in through the curtain of the door; I could see nothing, I only heard the sound of talk; he commanded Asmat'h to take the partridges from the Amirbar.\n\n332. \"Asmat'h drew aside the curtain; I stood outside the curtain. I saw the maiden (Nestan); a lance pierced my mind and heart. (Asmat'h) came, I gave her the partridges, she took them from me who was burned with fire. Ah me! since then in eternal furnace I burn!\"\n\n333. Now failed that light which despised even the sun; he could tell no more, he fainted, groaning bitterly. The knight (Avt'handil) and Asmat'h wept; the vicinage re-echoed their voices. They said gloomily: \"The arms that brought to nought heroes\\(^6\\) are become useless, alas!\"\n\n334. Asmat'h sprinkled water (upon him), Taria came back to consciousness; for a long time he could not speak, melancholy bound and overcame his heart; he sat down and moaned bitterly, his tears were mingled with the earth; he said: \"Woe is me! what a great agitation is her memory to me!\n\n335. \"Trusters in Fortune have their pick of her gifts, they are lucky, but at last are not spared her treachery; I praise the prudence of those sages who oppose her.

I fell, I fainted, force was fled from mine arms and shoulder. When I came back to life I heard the voice of weeping and woe; the household\\(^1\\) surrounded me like one who is embarking on a ship.\n\n337. \"I lay in a fair bed in a great chamber; the king and queen wept over me with undrying tears, they scratched their faces with their hands, tearing their cheeks; mullahs\\(^2\\) sat round, they called my sickness bewitchment of Beelzebub.\\(^3\\)\n\n338. \"When the king saw mine eyes open he embraced my neck; he said to me with tears: 'My son, my son, dost thou indeed live? Speak one word!' I could give no answer; like a madman I was greatly affrighted. Again I fell into a faint; blood rushed into my heart.\n\n339. \"All the mugris and mullahs\\(^4\\) watched round me, in their hands they held the Koran,\\(^5\\) all of them read; they thought I was struck by the Adversary of mankind,\\(^6\\) I know not of what they raved. For three days I was lifeless; inextinguishable fires burned me.\n\n340. \"The doctors\\(^7\\) also marvelled, saying: 'What manner of sickness is this? Nothing medicable afflicts him; some melancholy has laid hold of him.' Sometimes I leaped up like a madman, I uttered idle words. The queen poured forth tears enough to make a sea.\n\n341. \"For three days was I in the palace neither alive nor dead; then understanding came back to me, I remembered what had befallen me; I said: 'Alas! in what a plight am I, despairing\\(^8\\) of life!' I prayed the Creator for patience; I ventured to make a discourse of entreaty.\n\n342. \"I said: 'O God! abandon me not, hearken to my supplication, give me strength to endure that I may rise a little; to stay here will reveal my secret; let me reach home!'

Many men were come from the king, they carried back the good news: 'He sits up!' The queen ran in, the king came running bareheaded, he knew not what he did, he glorified God (while) all others were silent.\n\n344. \"They sat down on either side of me; I sipped some soup. I said: 'My lord, now my heart is stronger. I long to mount a horse, to see river and field.' They brought me a horse, I mounted, the king went with me.\n\n345. \"We went forth; we passed by the moedan (public square) and the river-bank. I went home, I sent back the king, who accompanied me to the threshold of the house. I went in; I felt worse, woe was added to woe; I said to myself: 'I would die! what more can Fate do to me!' (or, what more than this can my ill luck merit!)\n\n346. \"The bath of tears changed the crystal (of my face) to saffron colour; ten thousand knives cut my heart still more. The doorkeeper of the bedchamber entered, he called out the steward; I said to myself: 'What news does he know, either this one or that one?'\"\n\n347. \"'It is Asmat'h's slave.' 'What knows she (? he)?' I called, 'Ask!' (? invite him in). He came in. He gave me a love-letter.2 I read it. I was surprised how I had made another's heart burn with heat; I had no suspicion of her, my heart burned with melancholy for this.3\n\n348. \"I was surprised wherefore I was loved, or how she (Asmat'h) dared to declare it to me. (But, thought I) disobedience avails not, she will denounce me for silence, she will lose hope of me, then will she reproach me. I wrote what answer was fitting to enamourment.\n\n349. \"Days passed, and heart burned me still more with flame. I no longer watched the soldiers going to the plain to sport. I could not go to court.4 Many physicians began to come. Then I began to pay the joys and debts of the world.\n\n1 \"I would wish to know whence this is known to him or to that one.\"\n2 Saashico.

No one else discovered the burning of the hot fire (of love). They blamed my blood. The king ordered them to bleed my arm; I let it be done, so as to hide my sufferings, to let none suspect.\n\n351. \"After my arm was bled I lay melancholy alone in my bed. My slave came in; I glanced at him to ask what he wanted. 'It is Asmat'h's slave,' said he. I told him to bring him in. I thought in my heart: 'What has she found in me, or who is she?'\"\n\n352. \"The slave gave me a letter; I read it slowly. I learned from the letter that she wished to come quickly to me. I wrote in reply: 'It is time. Thou art right to be surprised. Thou shalt come if thou wantest me; suspect me not of tardiness in coming.'\"\n\n353. \"I said to my heart: 'Why do such lances make thee thus melancholy? I am Amirbar, king; all the Indians are subject to me.

They saw him, they knew him, they rejoiced in such manner as was fitting. They told the good tidings to Shermadin too; men quickly ran to him: \u201cHe is come for whose sake hitherto joy has been embittered to us.\u201d\n\n656. He went to meet him, he embraced him, he put his mouth on his (Avt\u2019handil\u2019s) hand,\\footnote{Kissed his hand.} pouring forth tears he joyfully kissed the destroyer in the field.\\footnote{\u201cThe overcomer of foes in fight.\u201d} Thus he spoke: \u201cO God, do I see really or darkly?\\footnote{Awake or in a vision.} How am I worthy of this, that mine eyes should gaze upon thee (safe and) sound!\u201d\n\n657. The knight saluted him low, he put face upon face;\\footnote{Kissed him.} he said: \u201cI thank God that no grief afflicts thee!\u201d The magnates did homage, whoever was worthy kissed him; there was great jubilation,\\footnote{Zari, 73, 957, 1053; cf. zami, 372; zeimi, 73, 303\u2014noise of merriment.} great and small alike rejoiced.\n\n658. They came where a dwelling-house had been built; all the city was assembled to see him; forthwith he sat down to feast, gay, proud, merry; an assemblage of tongues could not fully describe the joy of that day.\n\n659. He told Shermadin, he narrated to him all he had seen\u2014how he had found that knight whom he likened to the sun. Avt\u2019handil was hampered by tears; he said with half-closed eyes: \u201cWithout him it seems to me alike to dwell in palace or hut.\u201d\\footnote{Khuli, 1447.}\n\n660. (Shermadin) told him all the home news: \u201cNone knows of thy departure; whatever thou toldst me so have I done.\u201d He went not thence that day, he feasted and rested; at dawn he mounted, he set out when the sun enlightened the day.\n\n661. He sat no more at feasting, nor stayed he again private; Shermadin, the bearer of good tidings, went to\nannounce (Avt'handil's) arrival; swiftly he fared, in three days he made a ten days' journey. That lion (Avt'handil) rejoiced that he was to see the sun's rival.\\footnote{Mocamat'he\u2014i.e., T'hinat'hin.}\n\n662. He sent a message: \"O king, proud art thou in might and majesty! I venture to tell thee this thing with fear, respect and precaution: I esteemed myself worthless in that I had learned nought of that knight; now I know and will tell thee all; I come in joy and safety.\"\n\n663. Rostevan is a king, proud, puissant, imperious, (so) Shermadin delivered all his message in person: \"Avt'handil comes to the royal presence having found that\\footnote{\"A certain\"\u2014as if Shermadin affected ignorance of Tariel.} knight.\" The king said: \"(Now) I know that which I entreated and prayed for from God.\"\n\n664. Shermadin made report to T'hinat'hin, that nightless light: \"Avt'handil comes to thy presence; he brings thee pleasing news.\" Thereat, light flashed forth from her, even braver than the sun's. She gave him a gift, and robes to all his people.\n\n665. The king mounted and went to meet the knight who was coming thither, for this (honour) the sun-faced one incurred a great debt (of gratitude); joyous and warm-hearted they met, and some of the multitude of magnates seemed as if drunken.\n\n666. When he approached, the knight alighted and did homage to the king. Rosten, possessed by excess of joy, kissed him. Glad-hearted and merry they entered the royal hall; all there assembled rejoice at the arrival of the knight.\n\n667. Avt'handil, the lion of lions, did homage to her, the sun of suns; there the crystal, rose and jet were beautified by tenderness; her face was brighter than heaven's light; a dwelling-house was no fit abode for them, the sky itself was their (proper) palace.\n\n668. That day they made a feast; drinking and eating they made abundant. The king gazes on the knight, as a tender father on a son. They were both beautified by a\nsnowfall on fresh snow, a dew on the rose\\(^1\\); generously they gave gifts, pearls like small coin.\\(^2\\)\n\n669. The drinking was done, the drinkers separated each to his own home; they suffered not the magnates to go, they set the knight near before them.\\(^3\\) The king inquires, and he relates what trials he had undergone, and then what he had seen and heard concerning the stranger.\\(^4\\)\n\n670. \u201cWhen I speak of him, be not astonished if I ceaselessly lament, saying: \u2018Ah me!\u2019 To the sun alone can I liken him, or the face of him, the extinguisher of the mind of all who see him; a wilted rose among thorns, alas! he is far away!\\(^5\\)\n\n671. \u201cWhen unendurable Fate makes a man suffer grief, the reed becomes like a thorn, the crystal turns to saffron colour.\u201d While Avt\u2019handil was telling this his cheeks were bedewed with tears. He told in detail the story he had heard from (Tariel).\n\n672. \u201cHaving captured the caves in battle, he has for his house the abode of the Devis. He has the damsel of his beloved as his attendant. He is clad in panther\u2019s skin; he despises brocade and cloth of gold.\\(^6\\) No more sees he the world; an ever-new fire consumes him.\u201d\n\n673. When he had finished the story\u2014the matter of his grief\u2014the sight of the light of that sun,\\(^7\\) not ugly to look upon, gladdened him. They praised his rose-like hand which had been firmly held. \u201cThis prowess is sufficient for thee since thou art the undoer of grief.\u201d\\(^8\\)\n\n674. T\u2019hinat\u2019hin rejoiced at the hearing of this news. That day she was merry at the drinking, and eating was\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tears of joy on their cheeks.\n\n\\(^2\\) Drama, Gr., a small weight, also a small coin; 371, 528, 573.\n\n\\(^3\\) Pl. maj.\n\n\\(^4\\) Utznobo, inconsiderate, foolish, mad; utznobi, unknown; 730.\n\n\\(^5\\) Car., akh is a for akhisa.\n\n\\(^6\\) Slavra nakhl\u00e9bi; ? nakhl\u00e9bi, rare silken stuff.\n\n\\(^7\\) Thinat\u2019hin; but cf.

That sun met in his bedchamber a slave with a courteous\\(^1\\) word. She ordered him to come to her. Tongue cannot tell how pleased he was.\n\n675. The knight went joyful, tender, not ill content, the lion who had roamed the fields with the lions of the field and had lost his colour, a knight of the world, in quality a gem and a faultless ruby,\\(^2\\) but for heart's sake he had exchanged heart for heart.\n\n676. Bold sits the sun upon her throne, majestic, unconstrained,\\(^3\\) a fair aloe planted in Eden, generously watered by Euphrates' stream; the jetty hair and the eyebrow thickets adorned the crystal and ruby (of her countenance). Who am I that I should praise her? It needs the myriad tongues of Athenian sages to praise her fitly.\n\n677. She set the joyful knight before her with his chair,\\(^4\\) they both sat full of gladness to converse as befitted them; they spoke with dignity and fluency, not with unpolished\\(^5\\) words. She said: \"Thou hast found him in whose quest thou hast seen misfortunes?\"\n\n678. He answered: \"When the world gives a man his heart's desire,\\(^6\\) it befits not to recall grief (which is) as a day that is past. I found the tree, an aloe in form, watered by the stream of the world; there (I found) the face (which was) like the rose, but now is wan.\n\n679. \"There saw I the cypress, the rose-like, whose power was spent;\" he (Tariel) says: 'I have lost the crystal, and that where the crystal unites with glass (?).' I burn (for him) because, like me, unendurable fire consumes him.\" Then again he told the story he had heard from (Tariel).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Brdzeni*, wise\u2014possibly a corrupt reading.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or, \"a knight who was a gem\"\u2014in character and sociability.

He recounted all his misfortunes and sorrows by the road during the quest. Then he told her how God had thought him worthy to find what he desired. \"World, life,\\(^1\\) man, (all) seems to him as to a beast; alone he roams mad with the brutes, he weeps in the field.\n\n681. \"Ask me not, what praise can I speak, how couldst thou understand from me! nothing can please one who has seen him; the eyes of the beholders are weakened as by the brilliance of the sun; the rose is not become saffron, now the violet is gathered in nosegays.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n682. He told her in detail what he knew, what he had seen, heard: \"Like a panther he has a trail,\\(^3\\) and for house and abode a cave; a damsel is there ready to cherish him, to maintain his life and bear his sorrows. Alas! Fate\\(^4\\) makes all dwellers in the world to shed tears!\"\n\n683. When the maiden heard this story she had attained the fulfilment\\(^5\\) of her will; her moon-like face shone as 'twere with radiance at the full. She said: \"What answer can I make to give comfort to him, and pleasure,\\(^6\\) and what is the balm for the healing of his wound?\"\n\n684. The knight replied: \"Who has confidence in a rash\\(^7\\) man? He for my sake sacrifices himself to be burned, he who must not be burned. I have appointed the time of my return; I have promised him to sacrifice myself for him. I swear it by my sun whom I contemplate as a sun!\n\n685. \"A friend should spare himself no trouble for his friend's sake, he should give heart for heart, love as a road and a bridge.\\(^8\\) Then, again, the grief of his beloved should be a great grief to a lover. Lo! without him joy is nought to me, and myself I hold of none account.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Soy'hels qop'ha, being in the world.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ch. says this means, \"the pallor of T.'s cheeks is concealed by tears of blood.\" Another interpretation is, \"the rose was not saffron; now it is a nosegay of violets\" (?).\n\n\\(^3\\) Tzavarna, footpath; but Car. suggests Lat. taberna (?).\n\n\\(^4\\) \"World\" and \"Fate\" are often synonyms.\n\n\\(^5\\) Teadili, 678.\n\n\\(^6\\) Thineba, to please, give pleasure, 877, 1450, 1455.\n\n\\(^7\\) Momt:kap' havi, one who speaks before he thinks, one who lacks foresight.\n\n\\(^8\\) Means to aid his friend in the attainment of his ends.\n686. The sun-like one said: \"All my heart's desire is fulfilled: first thou art come in safety having found that which was lost, then the love implanted by me in thee has grown, I have found balm for my heart hitherto burned.\n\n687. \"Fate treats every man like the weather, sometimes there is sunshine and sometimes the sky thunders forth in wrath; hitherto grief has been upon me, now this gladness is my lot; since the world has joy in it why should any be sad!\n\n688. \"Thou dost well not to break the oath thou didst swear; it is necessary to fulfil strong love for a friend, to seek for his cure, to know the unknown.\\(^1\\) (But) tell me, what shall I, luckless, do if the sun of my heaven be hidden!\"\n\n689. The knight replied: \"By nearness (to thee) I have united to seven woes eight.\\(^2\\) Vain is it for one who is frozen to blow on water to warm himself therewith; vain is the love, the kiss from beneath, of the sun at its setting.\\(^3\\) If I be near thee, once is it woe, and if I go far from thee a thousandfold woe.\n\n690. \"Woe is me if I wander where, alas! the simoom\\(^4\\) burns the roamer; my heart is the target of an arrow, a dart is shot to pierce it\\(^5\\); the term of my life seems by this day to be shortened to one-third\\(^6\\); I long for a refuge,\\(^7\\) but the time is past for seeking shelter against troubles.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Uititzisa*.

My heart is the butt of an arrow which Satan shoots at me. The time of my life till to-day is a third...\" In the Svan folk-tales, Satan is called Samal (Samuel), and this seems to give some ground for Mr. Giorgidze's reading of line 2.\n\n\\(^7\\) Or, \"I would (willingly) hide (dissimulate) it.\"\n691. \"I have heard your discourse, I have understood what you command; the rose reveals the thorn,\\(^1\\) why should\\(^2\\) I prick myself therewith? but, O sun, become altogether a sun for me, and let me carry with me some hopeful token of life.\"\n\n692. The knight, sweetly and in sweet-sounding Georgian, giving good for good,\\(^3\\) spoke on this theme like a pleasant instructor to a pupil.\\(^4\\) The maiden gave him a pearl, she fulfilled his desire, and God grant that their present joy be perfected.\n\n693. What is better than for a man to approach the jet to the crystal and ruby,\\(^5\\) or to plant in the garden the aloe near the cypress, to water it and make a tree of it, to cause joy to the gazer and sorrow to him who cannot look thereon? Woe to the parted lover! He will be groaning, moaning, groaning.\\(^6\\)\n\n694. They found all their joy in gazing at each other. The knight went away, sundered from her he went dazed in heart; the sun wept tears of blood more abundant than the sea, and said: \"Fate is insatiable, alas! in the drinking of my blood!\"\n\n695. The knight went melancholy away, he beats his breast and so bruises it, for love makes a man weep and melts his heart. When a cloud hides the sun the earth is shadowed, so parting from his beloved makes twilight again, not morning.\n\n696. Blood and tears mingled made channel upon channel on his cheeks. He said \"My sun (T'hinat'hin) is by no means satisfied with me because I sacrifice myself to comfort the peerless (Tariel).\\(^7\\) I marvel how the black eyelash brands the heart of adamant. Until I see her, O world, I wish for no joy from thee.\n\n697. \"Him\\(^8\\) who yesterday was an aloe planted, watered\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ch., \"the thorn reveals the rose\"; katzvi is the spike on the rose-stem, ecali is the thorn as a separate plant.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or, \"did.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) Ch.'s reading.\n\n\\(^4\\) Reading gazrdilsa for gamzrdelsa.\n\n\\(^5\\) Ch., \"the jet moustache to the crystal-ruby cheek.\"\n\n\\(^6\\) Obscure, and probably spurious.\n\n\\(^7\\) Ch.; but (?).\n\n\\(^8\\) I.e., \"myself\" (Avt'handil).\nand fully grown in Eden, him to-day Fate thrusts through with her lance, pierces with her knife. To-day my heart is caught in a net of unquenchable fire. Now know I the way of the world; it is a tale and nonsense.\"\n\n698. Thus speaking, the tears gush forth, he trembles and shudders; with heart-sigh, with deep groan, his form bends and sways (as he goes). Converse with the beloved is embittered by parting. Alas! O Fate! The end enshrouds and swathes the beginning.\n\n699. The knight went and sat in his chamber; sometimes he weeps, sometimes he swoons, but in spirit he is near his beloved, he is not cut off from her. Like verdure in hoarfrost the hue of his face fades; see how soon lack of sun is apparent on the rose!\n\n700. Accursed is the heart of man, greedy, insatiable; sometimes the heart desiring joys endures all griefs; blind is the heart, perverse in seeing, not at all able to measure itself; no king, nor even death itself, can master it.\n\n701. While he spoke to his heart hearty words, he took the pearls, the love-token of his sun (T'hinat'hin), which had engirt the arm of his sun, and were comparable to her teeth; he put them to his mouth, he kissed them, his tears flowed like Pison.\n\n702. When day dawned there came an inquirer calling him to the court; the knight went forth, proud, gentle, not having slept, unrefreshed by sleep. A host of spectators who had hastened stood crowding one upon another. The king was arrayed for the field; drum and clarion were prepared.\n\n703. The king mounted. How can the pomp of those times be told now? By reason of the beating of the copper drums no word was heard by the ears. The hawks\n\n---\n\n1 Asudarebs (Lat. sudarium), 783.\n2 Cruli also means \"bound, fettered\"; 731, 814.\n3 Ch., \"It is neither lord of death nor king of aught.\"\n4 Gulisoni also means \"irritating.\"\n5 Bisoni (Gen. ii. 11). Cf. Gihon, 731; Eden, 77, 311; Euphrates, 676.\n6 Dabdah-nobi.\n7 Kosi, P., 1436; dabdabi, 1390.\ndarkened the sun; hither and thither coursed the hounds; that day the fields were dyed purple with the blood shed by them.\n\n704. They hunted, they returned joyful, having traversed the meadow; they took in with them magnates, princes and all the hosts. He (the king) sat down; he found the couches and all the pavilions adorned; harp harmonized with lute,\\(^1\\) there was a full choir.\n\n705. The knight sat near the king, one questioned, the other replied; the crystal and ruby of their lips shone transparent, the lightning of their teeth flashed; those who were worthy sat near, they listened; afar off the hosts were grouped; none dared speak without mention of Tariel.\n\n706. The knight departed sad at heart, his tears flowed on the fields; nought save his love passed before his eyes; sometimes he rises, sometimes he lies down. How can one sleep who is mad! Whose heart e'er hearkened to a prayer for patience!\n\n707. He lies down; he says: \"What can I imagine as any consolation for my heart? I am sundered from thee, thou tree, in form as a reed, reared in Eden, thou joy of thy beholders, cause of woe to them that cannot gaze on thee. Since I am unworthy to see thee manifestly, would that I might behold thee in a dream.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n708. Thus spake he, weeping, with flowing tears. Once more he addressed his heart: \"Patience is like the fountain-head of wisdom. If we endure not what can we do? How can we adapt ourselves to anguish? If we desire happiness from God we must accept griefs also.\"\n\n709. Again he says: \"O heart, however much thou hast the desire for death it is better to bear life, sacrificing self for her; but hide it, let not the flame of thy fire be seen again. It ill befits a lover to expose his love.\"\\(^3\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Changi chaghana, 101, 1444.\\(^2\\) 656.\\(^3\\) Cf. 12, 13, 14, 710.\nAVT'HANDIL'S REQUEST TO KING ROSTEVAN,\nAND THE VIZIER'S DISCOURSE\nAND ENTREATY\n\n710. When day dawned the knight arrayed himself and went forth early. He says: \"I would that my love be not revealed, that I may conceal it!\" For patience he prays: \"Contrive something for my heart!\" The moon-like one mounted his horse; he went to the house of the vizier.\n\n711. The vizier heard of it, went to meet him: \"The sun is risen upon my house; this day, meseems, a presentiment of joy announced to me this good news.\" He met (Avt'handil), saluted him, respectfully addressed to the perfect one perfect praise. A welcome guest should have a cheerful host.\n\n712. This host, not listless, ill-disposed or idle, helped the knight to dismount; they stretched on the floor under his feet a Cathayan (rug). The knight illumined the house as the sun's beam the universe. They said: \"To-day the western gale has wafted us the fragrant odour of roses.\"\n\n713. He sat; they that looked on him truly maddened their hearts. They who gazed on him accounted it an honour to swoon for his sake; many sighs were uttered, not once but a thousand times; they were ordered to depart, they went away, the household was thinned out.\n\n714. When the household was gone, the knight addressed the vizier; quoth he: \"In the council chamber nought will ever be hidden from thee; in every matter of state the king does what thou desirest, and agrees with thee. (Now) hearken to my woes; cure me with what will heal me.\n\n1 Keba. 2 Ghap'hali, A., 635, 1530. 3 Khatauri, 456.\n4 Kvena, lower, western, 28, 791; buki, snowstorm, 55, 965.\n5 Suni; Ch. reads suli, soul, which is perhaps better. In Svan and Mingrelian, soul and smell are the same.\n6 Djalabi, A., 101, 990. 7 ? \"this business (of mine).\"\n715. \"The fire of yon knight burns me, the flame that consumes him afflicts me; I am slain by longing and by not seeing the object of my desire; he would not grudge his life\\(^1\\) for me; what is due must be paid; one must love a generous ungrudging friend.\n\n716. \"The sight of him caught my heart as in a net, therein it stays; my patience, too, remains with him; in that he burns those near him, God created him indeed a sun. Moreover, Asmat'h is become a sister to me, more than a born sister.\n\n717. \"When I departed I swore with a fearful oath: 'I shall come again, I shall see thee not with a face despised of foes; thou art of darkened heart, I shall seek light for thee.' It is time for me to go, therefore am I burned with hot\\(^2\\) fire.\n\n718. \"All this I tell thee truly, not with braggart speech; he awaits me, and I cannot set forth. This it is that adds (fuel) to the hot fire; I cannot break my vow, I mad cannot abandon him mad. When and where did ever a breaker of oaths prevail?\n\n719. \"Go to the palace, report on my behalf to King Rosten what I have told thee. By his head I swear to thee, Vizier Ustasra,\\(^3\\) if he keep me not captive I shall not stay; if he keep me captive what can he make of me? Help me; let not the fire hurt and destroy my heart!\n\n720. \"Say from me: 'Let every mouth which is not speechless praise thee! Let God, the means\\(^4\\) of light, make known to thee how I fear thee. But that knight, an aloe-tree in form, burned me with fire; forthwith he took away my heart, in no wise could I keep it.\n\n721. \"'Now, O king, for me existence lacking him is utterly impossible; he, the dauntless, has my heart. Of what avail am I here?\\(^5\\) If I can be of any service to him, to you first will the glory belong; if I fail to accomplish\n\n\\(^1\\) Sulni, souls. \\(^2\\) Tzkheli; one edition reads neli, gentle, slow. \\(^3\\) Turk.

Let that befall my head (self) whate'er God wills. May He grant you the victory, and send me your (servant) back to you; but if I return not may you still reign, may your foes be affrighted.'\"\n\n723. Yet again the sun-faced one says to the vizier: \"I have shortened my speech. Now speak thus to the king till (others) come in (to inform him), pleasantly entreat for me my congee,\\(^1\\) summon up thy courage, and a hundred thousand red\\(^2\\) (pieces) shall be bestowed on thee as a bribe.\"\n\n724. The vizier said with a smile: \"Keep thy bribe for thyself; for me it is sufficient favour from thee that thou hast found the road hither. How can I dare tell the king what I have now heard from you!\\(^3\\) I know of a truth he will fill me (with favours), and gain is not disagreeable!\\(^4\\)\n\n725. \"'By his head! he will slay me straightway; I doubt whether he will delay even a moment.

The thing cannot be said and I cannot say it, however much anyone should reproach me.\\(^6\\)\n\n726. \"'A road cannot go over (beyond) itself.\\(^7\\) How can I, luckless, lay down my life for thee? He will despoil me or kill me. He will say: 'How dost thou speak these words? Why didst thou not inform me there and then? Why art thou such a madman?' Life is better than loot; this I even now learn.\n\n727. \"'Even if the king permit thee to depart, why should\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or perhaps, \"that I may get leave peacefully.\"\n\\(^2\\) Tsitheli, ?golden ducats.\n\\(^3\\) Note the characteristic mixture of singular and plural.

Why should they let thee go, why should they be hoodwinked, or why should they be removed far from their sun? If thou depart, our foes will become bold, will even themselves with us; but this must not be, as sparrows cannot change to hawks.\"\n\n728. The knight wept; with tears he spoke: \"Must I strike a knife into my heart! O vizier, it is apparent in thee thou knowst not what love is, nor hast thou in others seen friendship or oath. Or if thou hast seen such, how canst thou prove that without him my joy is possible?\n\n729. \"The sun has turned. I knew not what would make the sun turn. Now let us help him; it is better for us, in return he will warm our day. No one knows mine affairs like myself; what embitters me, what sweetens me. The discourse of idle men greatly grieves a man.\n\n730. \"Of what profit can I be to the king or his hosts since I am mad now, (and) my tears flow unceasingly! It is better that I go away; I will not break my word; oaths prove a man. The griefs a man has not seen cannot be comprehended by him at all (?).\n\n731. \"Now, O vizier, how can thy cursed heart be calm in this juncture! Iron in my place would become wax and not hard rock; I cannot repay his tears, even if Gihon flowed from mine eyes. Help me if thou wouldst desire help from me.\n\n732. \"If he give me not leave I shall steal away, unknown shall I depart from him; as it entreats me so shall I deliver my heart to be consumed by fire. I know he will do nothing to thee because of me, if he be not disposed to exile thee. Promise me\u2014whatever may happen to thee\u2014\"I shall sacrifice myself to be tortured!\"\n\n733. The vizier said: \"Thy fire consumes me also with fire.\n\n1 Perhaps in the sense of paying off old scores, but probably, \"will be a match for us.\"\n2 ? at the solstice; an obscure passage, but the sun is evidently Tariel, who had passed the crisis of his grief.\n3 Tzudi, bad, idle, vain.\n4 Cruil, bound, accursed; 700.\n5 Tini, 404.\n6 Jeoni.

I shall speak; if I die it matters not,\\(^1\\) my life\\(^2\\) will be sacrificed for thee.\"\n\n734. When the vizier had said this he arose and went to the palace. He saw the king arrayed; the sun-like\\(^3\\) face looked straight upon him. He was afraid, he dared not tell him unpleasing news; perplexed\\(^4\\) he stood, he thought not on warlike matters.\n\n735. The king saw the vizier struck dumb by sadness. He said: \"What grieves thee? What knowest thou? Why art thou come sad?\" He answered: \"I know nothing at all, but I am indeed wretched.\\(^5\\) You will be justified in slaying me when you hear the astounding news.\n\n736. \"My mourning neither adds to my grief nor surpasses\\(^6\\) it; I am afraid, though an envoy has no care for fear. Now Avt'handil bids thee farewell, he entreats, he wrangles not; (he says that) for him the world and life are nought without yon knight.\"\n\n737. With timorous tongue he told him all he knew. He added, thereafter: \"How canst thou know by such words in what a plight I saw him and how his tears flowed? Though you should let your wrath fall forthwith on me, you are just.\"\n\n738. When the king had heard this he was wroth, he lost his senses, his colour waned and he became terrible, he would have terrified onlookers. He cried: \"What has made a madman of thee? Who else would have related this? It is the choice of a bad man to learn early\\(^7\\) what is evil.\n\n739. \"Traitor-like,\\(^8\\) thou hast told me of this as if it were a merry matter; what more could anyone do to me save slay me faithlessly, treacherously?\\(^9\\) Madman, how couldst thou employ thy tongue to dare to speak thus to\n\n\\(^{1}\\) 118. \\(^{2}\\) Mze, sun. \\(^{3}\\) Ch.; ? he looked like the sun. \\(^{4}\\) Daqrit'h, Ch., thoughtful, modest, respectful; 1007. \\(^{5}\\) Thavisa vebuli, 392. \\(^{6}\\) Didobs, ? multiplies. \\(^{7}\\) ? before anybody else. \\(^{8}\\) Ghalari, ?

Such a madman as thou art is unworthy to be vizier or aught else.\n\n740. \"Should not a man spare his lord what is irksome, when\\(^1\\) he stupidly chatters stupid speech? Why were mine ears not deafened before hearing such a thing! If I kill thee, my neck\\(^2\\) must bear the responsibility for thy blood!\"\n\n741. Again he spake: \"If thou hadst not now been sent hither by him, by my head! I had cut off thy head, let there be no doubt of this! Go, withdraw! Look at the mad, stupid, desperate, improper (fellow)! Brave\\(^3\\) word, brave man, brave the deed done by him!\"\n\n742. He bent down, he threw chairs, he hit the wall and shattered them; he missed his aim, but for his (the vizier's) sake he made them (the chairs) like adamant, not willow-like. \"How couldst thou tell me of the going of him who plaited the aloe-tree branches!\" (?). Hot tears hollowed out channels in the vizier's white cheeks (?).\n\n743. The wretched vizier hurried away; he dared say no more. He crept off crestfallen like a fox;\\(^4\\) his wounded heart pains him. He comes in a courtier,\\(^5\\) he goes out gloomy,\\(^6\\) so (much) does the tongue dishonour him. A foe cannot hurt a foe as a man harms himself.\n\n744. He said: \"What more will God show me like unto my woes?\\(^7\\) Why was I deceived? Why was I darkened? Would that someone might enlighten me! Whoever announces anything so boldly to a sovereign, my (evil) days stand upon him too; how can he ever enjoy peace!\"\n\n745. The disgraced vizier went away in black luck. Gloomily, sad-faced, he said to Avt'handil: \"What thanks can I give thee! Thanks to thee, what a courtier am I become! Alas! I have lost my peerless self by mine own fault!\"\n\n746. He begs the bribe and behaves sportively, albeit his\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Instead of which.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kedi, 197, 424, 605, 1347.\n\n\\(^3\\) Shabash, P., 879; cf. shaba-shaba, 355; shabash, bravo!

I marvel why he spends his time in making jokes, why he is not grieved in heart! (Quoth he): \"He who gives not what he promised quarrels with the Mourav.\" It is said: 'A bribe settles matters even in hell.'\n\n747. \"How he took the matter, what he said to me, it is not to be told by me. What evil, what stupidity, what idiocy, what madness (he attributed to me)! I myself am no longer worthy of the name of man; no longer have I sense. At this I marvel\u2014why he slew me not; God must have given him patience.\n\n748. \"I knew too what I did; it happened not to me by mistake. I had pondered, I knew he would be wroth with me, therefore is my grief increased. None can avoid vengeance for a deed done with forethought. Still, for thy sake death seems joy to me; my woes are not in vain.\"\n\n749. The knight replied: \"It is wholly impossible for me not to depart. When the rose withers the nightingale then dies; he must seek a dewdrop of water, for the sake of this he must rove everywhere, and if he cannot find it what will he do or wherewith shall he soothe his heart?\n\n750. \"Without him I cannot bear to sit or lie. I will choose to roam like the beasts, with them to run. Why does he (Rostevan) desire me who am in such a state to fight his adversaries! It is better to have no man at all than to have a dissatisfied one.\n\n751. \"I will tell him once again; now, however angry the king may be, surely he can judge how my heart burns and flames. If he grant me not leave, I shall steal away when hope is gone. If I die, my portion and village will be uprooted.\"\n\n752. When they had conversed, the vizier made a banquet befitting them: he played the host, gave fair gifts to the\n\n---\n\n1 Headman, governor, chief of police, ? arbitrator.\n2 ? the sop to Cerberus.\n3 ? vengeance aimed by Providence.\n4 Gasuli, 1125.\n5 \"let the world be uprooted with me!\" (apr\u00e8s moi le d\u00e9luge!). Sop'heli means both village and world; cf. Russian mir.\nfair (guest), he enriched his attendants, both youths\\(^1\\) and greybeards. They parted; the knight went home as the sun was setting.\\(^2\\)\n\n753. He (Avt'handil) sent a message (to the king\\(^3\\)) saying: \"How can I give or bestow on thee that which befits thee? What return can I think of for the debts I owe thee? If I survive I shall die for thee; I shall make myself thy slave. I shall repay love with love, with a like weight.\"\n\n754. How can I tell his peerlessness, valour,\\(^4\\) and praise\\(^5\\) him! He was a man fitting and worthy even of such a deed. Thus should service be, as much as lies in one's power (?). When a man is in trouble then needs he brother and kinsman.\\(^6\\)\n\nXX\n\nAVT'HANDIL'S DISCOURSE WITH SHERMADIN WHEN HE STOLE AWAY\n\n755. The sun-faced, dispenser of light, speaks to Shermadin and says: \"This day is hope, the comforter of my heart, that thou wilt show what thou canst do for me.\" It needs a reader and a listener for the praise of this story of them.\n\n756. He says: \"Rosten did not grant me leave, he hearkened not even to a word from me; he knows not wherein one's being lies and how one's life is in another.\\(^7\\) Without him (Tariel) in truth I live not, neither abroad nor at home. What unrighteous deed has God ever forgiven to anyone?\n\n757. \"Though I resolved not to forsake him, and my decision is final\u2014every liar and traitor insults God and thus lies\u2014the heart seeing not him weeps and sighs, moans\n\n\\(^1\\) Moqmeni, ? knights.\n\\(^2\\) Tsveri, 183, 1012.

Now to steal away is the healing of this bruised heart. Hearken to what I shall entreat so long as thou hast time in my company, and fortify thyself in observance of what I have already taught thee.\n\n760. \"Now prepare as first leader to serve the sovereigns, manifest thy valour and integrity in all things. Take care of my household, command my troops, repeat anew the service, the attention thou hast hitherto shown.\n\n761. \"Keep my foes out of the marches,\u00b2 let not thy might fail in aught, grudge no good to the loyal,\u00b3 may they that are false-hearted\u2074 towards thee be slain; if I return, well shall thy due be repaid to thee by me; service to a master is never lost.\"\u2075\n\n762. When he heard this, the hot tear flowed from Shermadin's eyes. Quoth he: \"Wherefore should I be affrighted by sorrow in loneliness! But what shall I do without thee\u2014twilight will fall on my heart! Take me with thee to serve thee; I will help thee however thou wishest.\n\n763. \"Who has heard of so great wandering by one alone! Who has heard of a knight holding back from his lord in trouble!\u2076 Thinking thee lost, what shall I, useless, do here?\" The knight answered: \"I cannot take thee, however many tears thou sheddest.\n\n764. \"How can I disbelieve thy love for me! But the thing cannot be; thus Fate has taken up arms against me. To whom can I entrust my house; save thee, who is fit?\u2077\n\n\u00b9 Vashobs, ushobs, cries vashi! and ushi!\n\u00b2 142, 148, 162, 303, 388, 1537.\n\u00b3 Ert'hguli, one-hearted.\n\u2074 Orguli, two-hearted.\n\u2075 Cf.

A wise man cannot abandon his beloved friend. I venture to remind thee of the teaching of a certain discourse made by Plato:\\footnote{The reference has not been traced.} 'Falsehood and two-facedness injure the body and then the soul.'\n\n771. \"Since lying is the source of all misfortunes, why should I abandon my friend, a brother by a stronger tie than born brotherhood? I will not do it! What avails me the knowledge of the philosophizing of the philosophers! Therefore are we taught that we may be united with the choir of the heavenly hosts.\n\n772. \"Thou hast read\\footnote{?\" I will quote to you.\"} how the apostles write of love, how they speak of it, how they praise it; know thou it and harmonize thy knowledge: 'love exalteth us,' this is as it were the tinkling burden of their song;\\footnote{\\textit{Ezhvanni}, rattles; cf.

If I survive, I shall serve Thee, I shall offer sacrifice to Thee.\"\n\n793. When he had prayed, he mounted his horse (and) privily passed through the gates; he sent back Shermadin, albeit he made great lamentations. The vassal weeps and\n\n---\n\n1 Mep'heni, pl.; cf. 777.\n2 Hcadres, 808.\n3 Migzit'ha, A., is not in Ch.'s dictionary. The form mizgit'hi occurs in the Odes (M., iv., r.g.; Odes, VIa., 12, 2). There is no reason to think that the chapter headings are contemporary with the poem. The use of the word here does not seem justified by the text of the succeeding quatrains. It is possible that Migzit'ha is a corruption of some word with the root gza, and that the heading should run \"Prayer for the Road.\" Cf. 792.\n4 ? preparest bounties.\n5 Master my desires.\n6 Passions.\n7 \"Arte regendus amor\"; \"lois d'amour.\"\n8 Sop'helman, the world.\nbeats his breast; the wretched man sheds floods of tears. What can rejoice the vassal deprived of the sight of his lord!\n\n794. Now will I begin another tale; I will attend\\(^1\\) the parting knight. There was no audience that day for the wrathful Rosten. When day dawned he rose sullen; he was as if he poured flame from his face; he commanded the vizier to be called; thither they led him pale with fear.\n\nXXIII\n\nKING ROSTEVAN HEARS OF AVT'HANDIL'S SECRET FLIGHT\\(^2\\)\n\n795. When he saw the vizier arrived with reverence in the hall of audience, Rosten said: \"I recall not what thou saidst yesterday; thou didst annoy and enrage me, for a long time I could not compose my soul, therefore did I scold thee, vizier, heart of heart.\\(^3\\)\n\n796. \"I remember not what he (Avt'handil) wanted, (nor) why I treated thee so ill! Truly say the sages: 'Spite is a net of woes!' Never act in such a way! Consider the matter carefully.\\(^4\\) Now, tell me what thou saidst! Speak and repeat thy discourse!\"\n\n797. Again the vizier submitted his speech of yesterday. When he (Rosten) heard it, he made no lengthy answer: \"If I think thee not mad may I be the Jew Levi!\\(^5\\) Let me hear no more of this, else I wholly give thee up!\"\\(^6\\)\n\n798. When the vizier went forth to seek, he could not find the crystal\\(^7\\) one (Avt'handil); only the slaves\\(^8\\) with\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) ? inconsistent with the immediate sequel.\n\\(^2\\) Gulis guli, faithful.\n\\(^3\\) Khole, ? usually, closely, henceforth.\n\\(^4\\) ? reference to Gen. xlix. 5-7 (i.e., \"cursed for mine anger\"), or to some Hebrew contemporary of Rust'haveli.

He (the vizier) said: \"I cannot go to court; I should remember former days.\" Whoever is daring let him dare; I repent what I have already said.\"\n\n799. When the vizier came not, the king again sent a man; the man learned the news and stood outside, none dared report the departure. Rosten began to suspect, therefore grief increased tenfold. He said: \"Doubtless he who alone overpowers hundreds has stolen away!\"\n\n800. With bent head he meditated; in his heart was great gloom. He sighed and looked up; he commanded a slave: \"Go, let that villain come hither and tell me now; let him enter.\" When the vizier came back his colour paled and he was careful.\n\n801. Again the vizier entered the audience chamber, gloomily, not gaily. The king inquired: \"Is the sun gone away, become inconstant like the moon?\" (The vizier) told him all, how he (Avt'handil) had gone away secretly: \"The sun no longer shines on us; the weather is not bright!\"\n\n802. When the king heard this, he cried out with an exceeding great cry, he lamented, he said: \"Alas, my foster-son, my dazed eyes shall see thee no more!\" He made the onlookers to marvel by scratching his face and tearing his beard. \"Whither art thou gone, and where hast thou lost those pillars of light?\n\n803. \"If thou hast thyself, none will think thee an orphan; but as for me, what can I do, O foster-son? Now plagues befit me as an abode; thou hast left me orphaned, me whose wretched heart longs for thee. Till I am reunited to thee, tongues cannot tell my sufferings!\n\n804. \"When shall I see thee joyous returning from the chase? I shall no longer see thee after the game of ball, graceful in form, a faultless gem! No more shall I hear\n\n---\n\n1 \"The way in which I was treated by the king.\"\n2 Gaat'havnis (?).\n3 Avnis, from vneba, excel, cause to suffer (in fight).\n4 M., xii. 16.\n5 Dari ar darobs darulad.\n6 Gharibad.\n7 Bur'thi, 20.\nthine alluring voice.\\footnote{Ch., \\textit{me makhulsa}, to my sharpened hearing (with ears pricked up); another reading: \\textit{memakhulsa}, bird-catcher; Car., \\textit{memakhuli}, charming, captivating.} Now without thee, alas! what shall I do with the throne and whole palace?\n\n805. \"I know that hunger will not kill thee, however far thou roamest; thy bow will provide thee, and thine arrowheads. Perchance God in His mercy will again lighten our woes; but if I die, O foster-son, by whom shall I be mourned!\"\n\n806. A noise was heard, a great host of men had assembled; there is a crowd of courtiers at the palace, seizing their beards with their hands; all rend and strike themselves, the sound of their slapping is heard. They said: \"Darkness is upon us, accursed, since our sun is gone from the sky!\"\\footnote{M., xii. 16: \"We with a cursed day (\\textit{i.e.}, unhappy) deserve darkness, since the sun of heaven is gone from us.\"}\n\n807. When the king saw his magnates, he complained to them with tears and groaning. He said: \"You see our sun has made his rays quite rare to us!\\footnote{M., xii. 16: \"Do you see how our sun has wholly deprived us of rays?\"} In what have we annoyed him, wherein have we sinned, why has he parted from us, why forsaken us! How can any take for us the leadership of the hosts he maintained!\"\n\n808. All wept, lamented; then at length they grew calm. The king commanded: \"Ask! is he alone, or with a squire?\"\\footnote{Qmianad, accompanied by a \\textit{qma}.} The vassal\\footnote{Mona.} Shermadin came fearfully, shame-facedly; he gave (the king) the testament, he wept, life seemed to him but loss.\n\n809. He said: \"I found this written by him in his chamber; weeping slaves stood there, they tore hair and beard; he is stolen away alone, neither youth nor grey-beard is near him; if you slay me it will be just, an unseemly life irks me.\"\n\n810. When they read the will, again they wept a long time. Then (the king) commanded: \"Let not my troops\ndon gay colours. Let us make the downtrodden, the orphans and widows,\\(^1\\) to pray; let us help them that God may give him paths of peace!\"\n\nXXIV\n\nAVT'HANDIL'S SECOND DEPARTURE AND MEETING WITH TARIEL\n\n811. When the moon is far from the sun, distance makes her\\(^2\\) bright; when she is near, his ray consumes her\u2014she is repelled, she cannot approach. But sunlessness dries up the rose and lessens its colour. Not seeing\\(^3\\) the beloved renews in us our old grief.\n\n812. Now will I begin the story of that knight's departure. He goes away and weeps with boiling heart; it cannot be said that his tears diminished. Every moment he turned back; he prayed that he might find his sun-like one in sun-like beauty.\\(^4\\) He gazed, he could not detach his eyes; if he tore them away he lost consciousness.\n\n813. When he was near fainting, he had no power to move his tongue, but tears run from his eyes, pouring forth as from a spring. Sometimes he turns; he looks for means (aid) to bear his pains. When he goes forward he knows not whither his horse has borne him.\n\n814. He said: \"O mine own! let him who is far from thee and yet silent be accursed;\\(^5\\) since my mind remains with thee, let my heart also return to thee; the weeping eyes, too, wish and long to see thee. It is better that the lover should be subjected\\(^6\\) as much as may be to love!\n\n815. \"What shall I do till I am united to thee, or in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Skhvani*, others, agreeing with *kvrivni*, widows, is omitted in the translation, as its sense is not clear; probably, \"other lonely ones.\" Cf. 784, 785, 1571.\n\n\\(^2\\) In Georgian folklore the moon is male, and the sun female; in the English translation the genders are changed.\n\n\\(^3\\) *I.e.*, \"realizing the absence of.\"\n\n\\(^4\\) Ch. Dict. s.v. *mze*; or, \"that the sun would be a sun for him\" (?).\n\n\\(^5\\) *Cruli*, ? for *shecruli*, bound (Ch.); 700.\n\n\\(^6\\) *Dzabuni*, P., 586.\nwhat thinkest thou I shall find joy! I would slay myself but that I doubt it would displease thee, but it would grieve thee to hear I was no longer living.\\(^1\\) Come (then) and let us living give our eyes to the shedding of tears.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n816. He said: \"O sun, who art said to be the image of the sunny night of Him who is One in unity of being and Everlasting, whom the heavenly bodies obey to the jot\\(^3\\) of a second, turn not away my good fortune; hear my prayer till our meeting, mine and hers!\n\n817. \"Thou whom former philosophers addressed as the image of God,\\(^4\\) aid me, for I am become a captive, iron chains bind me! I, seeker of crystal and ruby, have lost coral\\(^5\\) and glass; formerly I could not endure nearness, now I regret absence.\"\n\n818. Thus he lamented and cried out; like a candle he melted. The fear of being too late made him hasten; he wandered on. When night fell, he found delight in the rising of the stars; he compared them to her, he rejoiced, he gazed on them, he held converse with them.\n\n819. He says to the moon: \"I adjure thee in the name of thy God, thou art the giver of the plague of love to lovers; thou hast the balm of patience to make them bear it; hear my prayer to unite me with the face fair, through thee, like thine own.\"\\(^6\\)\n\n820. Night rejoiced him, day tortured him, he awaited the sunset. When he saw a stream he dismounted; he gazed on the rippling of the water, with it he united the rivulet of blood from the lake of tears; again he set out, he hasted onward on his road.\n\n821. Alone he lamented; he who was like the aloe-tree in form wept. He killed a goat in the plain\\(^7\\) where he came to a rocky place, roasted and ate of it and went on, sun-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Suicide, 728, 854, 1169.\n\\(^2\\) Ch. here inserts a quatrain (No. 829).\n\\(^3\\) Iota.\n\\(^4\\) Ch. says the reference is to Phil. ii. 6 (?); invocation to sun, 935, 937.\n\\(^5\\) Sat'hi.

Cf. 940.} He said: \"I forsook roses, and behold me here woeful!\"\n\n822. I cannot now tell the words then spoken by that knight, or what he discoursed and lamented with such elegance. Sometimes his eyes reddened (with their tears) the rose (of his cheeks) scratched by his nail. When he saw the caves he was glad; he went up to the door of the cave.\n\n823. When Asmat'h perceived him, she went to meet him, her tears fell fast; she rejoiced so greatly that she will never have such joy again. The knight dismounted, embraced her, kissed her, and conversed with her. When a man has waited for a man, the coming pleases him wondrously.\n\n824. The knight said to the damsel: \"Where and how is thy lord?\" The damsel wept with tears which might have fed the sea.\\footnote{Cf. 259, 1423.} She said: \"When thou wert gone, he roamed about, for it irked him to be in the cave; now I know nought of him, either by sight or tidings.\"\n\n825. The knight was pained as if some lance had struck him in the midst of his heart. He said to Asmat'h: \"O sister, not thus should a man be! How could he break his oath! I deceived him not; how could he be false to me! If he could not keep it, why did he promise? If he promised me, why did he lie?\n\n826. \"Since save for him I counted not this world as grief, why did he forget me when I departed? Why could he not endure, what troubled him? How dared he break the oath he had sworn? But why should I marvel at evil from my fate!\"\n\n827. Again the maiden spoke: \"Thou art justified in such sorrow; but when thou shalt judge aright\u2014suspect me not of complaisance\\footnote{Cf. 860, 877.}\u2014is not heart needed to fulfil oath and promise? He, bereft of heart, awaits only the curtailment of his days.\n\n828. \"Heart, mind and thought\\footnote{33, 299, 882.} depend one upon\nanother. When heart goes the others also go and follow it. A man deprived of heart cannot play the man; he is chased forth from men. Thou sawest not, thou knowest not, what fires consumed him.\n\n829. \"Thou art right in murmuring that thou art separated from thy sworn brother, but how can it be told into what plight he fell, how can I tell thee the fact? Tongue will fail, will be exhausted, the aching heart will ache (still more). Thus think I, for I saw, I luckless born.\n\n830. \"Hitherto none has heard in story of sufferings like unto his; such torture would affright\\(^1\\) not only men, (but) even stones; sufficient for a fountain are the tears that have flowed from his eyes. Whatever you say, you are right; one is wise in another's battle.\\(^2\\)\n\n831. \"When he went forth, burned, consumed with fires, I asked him: 'Tell me, his adopted sister, what will Avt'handil do when he comes?' He replied: 'Let him come to seek me, me useless for his sake. I shall not leave this vicinage; I will not break my promise to him.\n\n832. \"'My vow I will not break, that oath will I not belie; I shall wait till the time appointed, however much the channels (of tears) may flow. If he find me dead, let him bury me, let him say Alas! and mourn. If I meet him living, let him marvel, (for my) life is doubtful.'\n\n833. \"Henceforth\\(^3\\) the sundering of the sun and the mountain-top hath befallen me, only I must shed tears moistening the plains; maddened,\\(^4\\) I am tortured by the exceeding multiplication of groans; death has forgotten me, behold the deed of Fate!\n\n834. \"This true saying is written on a stone in China\\(^5\\): 'Who seeks not a friend is his own foe!' Now that to which nor rose nor violet could be likened is become saffron. If thou seekest, then, seek him; do what befits thee.\"\n\n835. The knight said: \"Thou art right in not justifying me in murmuring against him. But bethink thee what\n\n\\(^1\\) Dzrtsena.\n\\(^2\\) 644, 860, 863.\n\\(^3\\) Here Asmat'h begins again.\n\\(^4\\) Khelkmnilsa; Ch., sulkmnilsa.\n\\(^5\\) Chins kvasa, ? on a Chinese stone.\nservice I have done as one prisoner (of love) to another: I fled from my home, like a stag seeking water I seek him and think of him, I wander from field to field.\n\n836. \"The crystal pearl-shells guard the ruby-hued pearl and apparel it; from her I have gone away, I could not stay near her, I could not make her happy, nor could I be happy; by my privy flight I have angered the equals of God, in return for their favours I have troubled their hearts.\n\n837. \"My lord and upbringer, by the grace of God living in might, paternal, sweet, merciful, a sky snowing graciousness, to him have I been faithless; I went away, verily I forgot all, and, guilty toward him, I no longer await any good thing from God.\n\n838. \"All this afflicts me thus, O sister, for his sake. I have not deceived him, but am come a wayfarer by night and day. Now he is gone somewhere, he for whom I am consumed with fire, wearied in vain and weeping I sit with a sad face.\n\n839. \"Sister, the hour and time give me no more leisure for converse. I repent not the past, early will I fulfil the word of the wise: I go, I will seek, either shall I find him or bring death early upon me; otherwise, since I am thus doomed by Fate, what can I embolden myself to say to God.\"\n\n840. No more than this he said; he wept and went his way. He passed the rocks, crossed the water, went through the reeds and came to the plain. The wind blowing over the fields froze the rose to a ruby hue. \"Why givest thou me this plague?\" He reproached Fate for this.\n\n841. He said: \"O God, wherein have I sinned against thee, the Lord, the All-seeing? Why hast Thou separated me from my friends? why didst Thou lure me on to such a\n\n---\n\n1 1564.\n2 Ch. explains margaliti as \"white teeth,\" and says no more.\n3 Storni, 769.\n4 Cf.

One thinking of two,\\(^1\\) I am in a parlous plight; if I die I shall not pity myself, my blood be on my head!\\(^2\\)\n\n842. \"My friend cast a bunch of roses on my heart, and so wounded it; that oath fulfilled by me he kept not. If, O Fate, thou partest me from him, my joy is past, to mine eyes another friend were reviled and shamed.\"\n\n843. Then he said: \"I marvel\\(^3\\) of a man of sense; when he is sad, of what avail is a rivulet from the terrace\\(^4\\) of tears? It is better to choose, to ponder over the fitting deed. Now for me, too, it is better to seek that sun(-like one), reed-like in form.\"\n\n844. The knight, weeping, besprinkled\\(^5\\) with tears, set himself to search; he seeks, he calls, he cries aloud, watching by night as by day; for three days he traversed many a glen, reedy thicket, forest and field; he could not find him; sad he went, unable to learn any tidings.\n\n845. He said: \"O God, wherein have I sinned against Thee? how have I displeased Thee so greatly? why bring this fate upon me? What torture hast Thou sent upon me! Judge me, O Judge, hearken to my prayer; shorten my days, thus turn my woes to joy!\"\n\n846. Weeping and pale,\\(^6\\) the knight went his way and spoke; he mounted a certain hill, the plain appeared in sunshine and shadow. He saw a black (horse) standing with the reins on his neck on the edge of the rushes. He said: \"Undoubtedly it is he; of that there can be no doubt.\"\n\n847. When he saw, the heart of the knight leaped up and was lightened; here to him, distressed, joy became not tenfold, but a thousandfold; the rose (of his cheeks) brightened its colour, the crystal (of his face) became crystal (indeed), the jet (of his eyes) grew jetty; like a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Avt'handil thinking of T'hinat'hin and Tariel.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kedi, neck.\n\n\\(^3\\) Naghveli, bile, gall; fig., care, anxiety.\n\n\\(^4\\) Bani, roof, terrace, pipe of a stove; or ? from banva, to wash, flow; ? \"a rivulet of cleansing tears.\"\n\n\\(^5\\) P'hrkveva, to spout, sprinkle.\n\n\\(^6\\) P'her shetzvlili.\nwhirlwind\\(^1\\) he galloped down, he rested not from gazing at him.\\(^2\\)\n\n848. When he saw Tariel he was indeed grieved; (Tariel) sat with drawn face in a state near unto death, his collar was rent, his head was all torn, he could no longer feel, he had stepped forth from the world.\n\n849. On one side lay a slain lion and a blood-smeared sword, on the other a panther stricken down a lifeless corpse. From his eyes, as from a fountain, tears flowed fiercely forth; thus there a flaming fire burned his heart.\n\n850. He could not even open his eyes, he had wholly lost consciousness, he was come nigh to death, he was far removed from joy.\\(^3\\) The knight calls him by name, he tries to rouse him by speech; he cannot make him hear; he leaped about; the brother shows his brotherliness.\n\n851. He wipes away (Tariel's) tears with his hand, he cleansed his eyes with his sleeve; he sits down near by and only calls him by name; he says: \"Know'st thou not me, Avt'handil, for thy sake wandering and mad?\" But he heard little, staring with fixed\\(^4\\) eyes.\n\n852. This is all thus, even as related by me. He wiped away the tears from his eyes, he somewhat recalled him to consciousness; then only he knew (Avt'handil), kissed him, embraced him, treated him as a brother. I declare by the living God\\(^5\\) none like him was ever born.\n\n853. He said: \"Brother, I was not false to thee, I have done what I swore to thee; unparted from my soul I have seen thee, thus have I kept my vow; now leave me; till death I shall weep and beat my head, but I entreat thee for burial, that I be not yielded to the beasts for food.\"\n\n854. The knight replied: \"What ails thee? Why doest thou an evil deed? Who hath not been a lover, whom doth the furnace not consume?

I marvel why thou art thorny, why finding thee is pain!\u2019 It said: \u2018Thou findest the sweet with the bitter; whatever costs dear is better; when the lovely is cheapened it is no longer worth even dried fruit.\u2019\n\n859. \u201cSince the soulless, inanimate\u2076 rose speaks thus, who then can harvest joy who hath not first travailed with woe?

Who is wise, what is wise, how can a madman act wisely? Had I my wits such discourse would be fitting. The rose cannot be without the sun; if it be so, it begins to fade. Thou weariest me, leave me, I have no time, I can endure no more.\"\n\n867. Avt'handil spoke again with words of many kinds. He said: \"By my head! by these empty words I shall do thee some good! Do it not! It is not the better deed. Be not thine own foe!\" But he cannot lead him away: he can do nothing at all by speech.\u00b9\n\n868. Then he said: \"Well, since thou wilt by no means hearken to me, I will not weary thee; my tongue has hitherto spoken in vain. If death be better for thee, die!

He entreated him, \"Mount!\" He begged and prayed him, and said not Alas! He knew that riding would chase away his sadness, that he would bend the reedy stem\u2076 (of his form), and make a tent of the jet (eyelashes). He (Avt'handil) made him (Tariel) obedient; it pleased (Avt'handil); (Tariel) sighed not nor moaned.\n\n\u00b9 Lines 2 and 3 are not clear.\n\u00b2 Datzamdchenara.\n\u00b3 M., xii. 30; sari, a support for vines (Ch.), 871, 1206.\n\u2074 Mkhdeli.\n\u2075 The tactful Avt'handil here remembers an incident in Tariel's story (344).\n\u2076 Sarsa; Ch., srasa, palace; sari, 869, 1206.\n872. He said plainly: \"I will mount; bring forward my horse.\" (Avt'handil) brought (the horse) and gently helped him to mount; he did not make him pant with haste; he took him towards the plain, he made his graceful form to sway. Some time they rode; going made him seem better.\n\n873. He (Avt'handil) entertains him, and speaks fair words to him; for (Tariel's) sake he moved his coral-coloured lips in speech. To hear him would make young the aged ears of a listener. He put away melancholy; he took unto himself patience.\n\n874. When the elixir\\(^1\\) of grief (Avt'handil) perceived the improvement, joy not to be depicted lightened his rose-like face\u2014(joy which is) the physician of the reasonable, the sigh and moan of the foolish. He who had formerly spoken senselessly now spoke reasonably.\n\n875. They began to converse; he spoke a frank word: \"One thing will I say to thee: Open to me what is secret. This armlet\\(^2\\) of her by whom thou art wounded\u2014how much dost thou love it? How dost thou prize it? Tell me, then let me die!\"\n\n876. He said: \"How can I tell thee the likeness of that incomparable picture! It is my life, the giver of my groans, better to me than all the world\u2014water, earth and tree. To hearken to that to which one should not listen is more bitter than vinegar!\"\\(^3\\)\n\n877. Avt'handil said: \"I truly expected thee to say this. Now, since thou hast said it, I will answer thee, and think not I shall flatter thee;\\(^4\\) to lose Asmat'h were worse than the loss of that armlet.

Bravo! a just judgment (indeed)!\"\n\n880. He said: \"What thou sayest is only too true. Pitiable is Asmat'h, who thinks of (Nestan) and sees me. I thought not to live; thou are come in time to quench the fires. Since I still survive, come, let us see, albeit I am still dazed.\"\n\n881. He obeyed. Avt'handil and the Amirbar set out. I cannot achieve the praise of their worth: teeth like pearls, lips cleft roses. The sweetly discoursing tongue lures forth the serpent from its lair.\n\n882. Thereupon (Avt'handil) says: \"For thy sake will I sacrifice mind, soul, heart; but be not thus, open not thy wounds afresh. Learning avails thee not if thou do not what the wise have said; of what advantage to thee is a hidden treasure if thou wilt not use it?\"\n\n883. \"Grieving is of no use to thee; if thou art sorrowful what good will it do thee? Know'st thou not that no man dies undesignedly? Awaiting the sunbeams the rose fades not in three days. Luck, endeavour and victory, if God will, shall be thy lot.\"\n\n884. The knight (Tariel) replied: \"This teaching is worth all the world to me. The intelligent loves the instructor; he pierces the heart of the senseless. But what shall I do, how can I endure when I am in excessive trouble?

Whatever thing afflicts someone himself, in that will he be bold for the sake of others too.\" Why know'st thou not once for all in what way my heart melts?\n\n886. \"With my tongue will I relate to thee in detail all that hath befallen me; then indeed with wise heart judge the truth. I expected thee, awaiting thee was irksome to me, I could no longer endure the cave, I wished to ride in the plain.\n\n887. \"I came up that hill, I had traversed these reeds; a lion and a panther met, they came together; they seemed to me to be enamoured, it rejoiced me to see them; but what they did to each other surprised me, horrified me.\n\n888. \"I came up the hill, the lion and panther came walking together; they were to me like a picture of lovers, my burning fires were quenched. They came together and began to fight, embittered they struggled; the lion pursues, the panther flees. They were not commended by me.\n\n889. \"First they sported gaily, then they quarrelled fiercely; each struck the other with its paw, they had no fear of death; the panther lost heart, even as women do; the lion fiercely pursued, none could have calmed him.\n\n890. \"The behaviour of the lion displeased me. I said: 'Thou art out of thy wits. Why annoy'st thou thy beloved? Fie on such bravery!' I rushed on him with my bared sword, I gave him to be pierced by the spear, I struck his head, I killed him, I freed him from this world's woe.\n\n891. \"I threw away my sword, I leaped down, I caught the panther with my hands, I wished to kiss it for the sake of her for whom hot fires burn me. It roared at me,\n\n1. ? because Avt'handil is also a lover.\n2. 167, 731.\n3. Ecadrebis; ? \"this he communicates to others.\"\nand worried me with its blood-shedding paws. I could bear no more; with enraged heart I killed it too.\n\n892. \"However much I soothed it, the panther became not calm. I grew angry, I brandished it, dashed it on the ground, shattered it. I remembered how I had striven with my beloved.\\(^1\\) (Yet) my soul tore not itself altogether out of me. Why, then, art thou astonished that I shed tears!\n\n893. \"Behold, brother! I have told the woes that grieved me. Life itself befits me not. Why didst thou wonder that I am thus fordone? I am sundered from life, death is become shy of me.\" So the knight ended his story, sighed, and wept aloud.\\(^2\\)\n\nXXV\n\nHERE IS THE GOING OF TARIEL AND AVT'HANDIL TO THE CAVE, AND THEIR SEEING OF ASMAT'H\n\n894. Avt'handil also wept with him and shed tears. He said: \"Be patient, die not, rend not altogether thy heart. God will be merciful in this, though sorrow hath not shunned thee; if He had willed to part you, He would not first have united you.\n\n895. \"Mischance pursues the lover, embitters life for him; but to him who at first bears woe it yields joy at last. Love is grievous, for it brings thee nigh unto death; it maddens the instructed, it teaches the untaught.\"\n\n896. They wept and went on; they wended their way to the cave. When Asmat'h saw them she rejoiced indeed; she met them, she wept, her tears wore channels in the rocks. They kissed and wept aloud; each pressed the other to tell his news again.\n\n897. Asmat'h said: \"O God, Thou who canst not be\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See 506-512.\n\n\\(^2\\) Rust'haveli's contemporary, Wolfram von Eschenbach, in *Parzival*, vi. 80, has an episode different in character, but vaguely suggestive of the psychological aspect of this passage. Cf. Gulak, p. 53. Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Shirley is repeatedly described by her lover as \"pantheress,\" \"leopardess\" (chap. xxxvi.). Cf. Rust'haveli, 26, 85.\nexpressed by man's tongue! Thou art the fulness of all; Thou fillest us with Thy sun-like radiance.\\(^1\\) If I praise Thee, how can I praise Thee? What can I say in praise of Thee, who art not to be praised by the intellect? Glory to Thee! Thou hast not slain me by the shedding of tears for them.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n898. Tariel said: \"Ah, sister! for this have my tears flowed here. For that she erstwhile made us smile, Fate makes us weep in turn; 'tis an old law of the world, not one newly to be heard of! Alas! were it not for pity of thee, death would be my joy.\n\n899. \"If he be athirst, what sane, reasonable man would pour away water! I marvel why I am soaked\\(^3\\) in tears from mine eyes! Lack of water\\(^4\\) slays, water flows never dried. Alas! the opened\\(^5\\) rose, the beauteous\\(^6\\) pearl, is lost!\"\n\n900. Avt'handil, too, was reminded of his sun and beloved. He said: \"O mine own, how can I remain living without thee! Apart from thee my life is for me pitiable. Who can tell thee how I suffer, or how sore a fire burns me!\n\n901. \"How can the rose think, 'If the sun go away I shall not wither'? Or what, alas! will be our lot when the sun sets behind the hill? Heart, it is better for thee to harden thyself, petrify thyself wholly. Perchance it may happen to thee to see her; let not thy spirit be utterly spent!\"\n\n902. They calmed their souls, they were silent, fire burned both. Asmat'h followed, went in; like them, a furnace consumed her. She stretched out the panther's skin he formerly used. They both sat down; they spoke of whatever pleased them.\n\n903. They roasted meat and\\(^7\\) made a meal fitting the occasion; there the meal was breadless,\\(^8\\) and there was no multitude of guests.\\(^9\\) They begged (Tariel) to eat; he had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P'hena.  \n\\(^2\\) Tariel and Avt'handil.  \n\\(^3\\) Llobili, drenched.  \n\\(^4\\) Adopting Ch's. suggested emendation utsqloba for utsqaloba.  \n\\(^5\\) Pobili, cleft.  \n\\(^6\\) Tsqobili, harmonious; of a gem, choice, rare.  \n\\(^7\\) Mtswadi, roast meat.  \n\\(^8\\) Upuroba puroba.  \n\\(^9\\) Thus Ch.\nnot power to eat; he chewed a morsel, spat it out,\\(^1\\) he hardly swallowed the weight of a drachm.\\(^2\\)\n\n904. Pleasant it is when man converses agreeably with man; he will listen to what is said, not let it pass in vain; thus the fire which burns so greatly is somewhat quenched; great comfort it is to speak of troubles when a man has the opportunity.\\(^3\\)\n\n905. That night those lions, those heroes, were together, they conversed, and each revealed to the other his woes; when day dawned they began again many-worded conversations; they heard (again) from each other the oath formerly sworn.\n\n906. Tariel said: \u201cWhy speak many words? For that which thou hast done for me, God is surety\\(^4\\) for the debt. Oath for oath is enough; remembrance,\\(^5\\) friendship for a departing friend, are not the deed of a drunken man.\n\n907. \u201cNow be merciful to me, make me not burn again in hottest fires; the flame which consumes me is not kindled by a steel; thou canst not extinguish it for me, thou thyself shalt be burned by the law of the creation of the world. Go, return, go back thither, to the place where thy sun is.\n\n908. \u201cTo cure me seems hard even to Him who created me\u2014understand, ye who hear!\u2014therefore I roam mad in the fields. Once I too was a doer of what befits the reasonable; now the turn\\(^6\\) of madness has fallen to my lot, and so I am mad.\u201d\n\n909. Avt\u2019handil said: \u201cWhat can I say in answer to this thou hast said? Thou thyself hast spoken as a man sagely instructed. How is it not possible for God again to cure the wound! He is the upbringer of everything planted or sown.\n\n910. \u201cWhy should God do this, create such as you and not unite you, part you, madden thee with weeping?\n\n\\(^1\\) 262.  \n\\(^2\\) Drama, 371, 528, 573, 668, 1214.  \n\\(^3\\) ? meets a man.  \n\\(^4\\) Mzghveli, payer, Ch.

Fear not, God is generous though the world be hard! Learn then what I teach thee; I make bold to tell thee that he who will not learn is an ass.\n\n912. \"Heed what thou hearest; let this suffice for teaching. I asked leave of my sun to come away to you; I said to her: 'Since he made cinders of my heart I am no longer of use to thee, I will not stay; what else need I tell thee in many (words)?'\n\n913. \"She said: 'I am content, thou art doing well and bravely, the attention thou showest to him I accept as a service to me.' At her request I came away. I am not drunk nor intoxicated! If I now return what shall I say? 'Why art thou come back like a coward?' (will be her greeting).\n\n914. \"Better than such discourse is this: hearken to what I say: The man who is to do a difficult deed must be reasonable, the rose withered for lack of sun cannot make provision for itself; (if) thou art no longer of any use to thyself, be of use to me; brother must act brotherly to brother.\n\n915. \"Wherever thou wilt, stay there after thy rule: if thou wilt with wise heart, if thou wilt with maddened mind. With that loveliness of mien, that grace of form, do but strengthen thyself, die not, be not consumed by the flame!\"\n\n916. \"I beg no more than leave for a year and a week.\"\n\n---\n\n1 895.\n2 Me sulni amomkhadenit'h, an expansion of momcal; 601.\n3 Ch., \"Is it worth while to speak of this?\"\n4 Dzviri, evil, dear, miserly, difficult.\n5 Ch. reads ar for ra: \"If thou understandest not, pay heed.\"\n6 Dagi, 650.\n7 Mzyep'hsi, msgep'hsi, a week; e.g., msgep'hsi Kristes vnebisa.

It will be a sufficient token of this if thou shed tears for me. Then rejoice if thou wilt, or if thou wilt increase thy grief.\n\n918. \"Now perchance wilt thou sorrow for the sake of what I have told thee? I go far from thee, and I know not whether horse or ship may fail me. No! lack of speech avails not.\\(^1\\) I am not quick-scented like a beast; I know not what God will do to me, nor the ever-revolving sky.\"\n\n919. He (Tariel) said: \"I will weary thee no more, nor say too much; thou wilt not listen to me however much I lengthen my discourse. If a friend will not follow thee, follow thou him; do whatever he wills.\\(^2\\) In the end every hidden thing shall come to light.\n\n920. \"When\\(^3\\) thou art convinced, then thou shalt know the difficulty of mine affairs; for me it is all one, roaming or not roaming; what thou hast told me that will I do, however much madness torture me. (But) if shortness of days (\\(i.e.\\), death) befall me in thine absence, what shall I do?\"\n\n921. They ended their discourse: they gave that promise to each other. They mounted, rode out, each killed game in the plain. They returned, their tearful hearts wept again; the thought of the parting on the morrow added grief to grief.\n\n922.

Absence and parting from a friend are\nthe slayers of a man. Who, indeed, knows not, under-\nstands not, how hard is that day!\n\n923. Morning dawned; they mounted and said farewell\nto the maiden. From the eyes of Tariel, Asmat'h and\nAvt'handil tears flowed. The cheeks of all three hung out\nflags of crimson. Those lions ever made wild (by grief)\nwent out to the beasts.\n\n924. They descended (from) the caves and went away cry-\ning aloud with flowing tears. Asmat'h weeps and laments:\n\"O lions! whose tongues can chant lamentations for you!\nThe sun has burned and consumed you heavenly stars.\nAlas for my woes so great! Alas the sufferings of life!\"\n\n925. Those knights, departed thence, travelled that day\ntogether. They came to the seashore, there they tarried,\nthey travelled not through dry land (?) That night they\nparted not; again they shared their fire. They wept for\nthe absence from each other; they bewailed it.\n\n926. Avt'handil said to Tariel: \"The channel of the\nflow of tears is dried! Why didst thou separate from\nP'hridon, the giver of this steed? Thence are tidings and\nmeans to be learnt regarding that beautiful sun. Now I go\nthither; teach me the way to thy sworn brother.\"\n\n927. Tariel teaches him by word the direction of the road\nto P'hridon's. He made him understand as well as he\ncould by his power of speech: \"Go towards the east; fare\neven unto the seashore. If thou seest him tell him of me;\nhe will ask news of his brother.\"\n\n928. They killed a goat and dragged it after them, they\nmade a fire on the seashore, they sat down and ate such a\nmeal as was fitting to their grief.

Where and whence uprooatest thou? But God abandons not the man forsaken by thee.\n\n932. Avt'handil, parted from (Tariel), weeps; his voice reaches to the heavens. Quoth he: \"The stream of blood which flowed anew flows once again. Now is parting as hard as union will be till (we meet) in heaven. Men are not all equal; there is a great (difference) between man and man.\"\n\n933. Then the beasts of the field drank their fill of the tears he shed there; he could not quench the furnace, he burned with frequent fire. Again the thought of T'hinat'hin\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tsqaros tsqalni; a variant is tsqaros t'hvalni, eyes (sources) of springs.\n\n\\(^2\\) Shedjedilni, riveted.\n\n\\(^3\\) M., xii. 20, edji, station, stopping-place, halt. Car. (p. 311) and Abul. (p. 125) give as synonym bilici, footpath, bridle-path. Ch., in the 1860 edition of Rust'haveli, says edji is 6,000 paces; but in his dictionary he interprets the word in this passage as \"path,\" and contradicts himself by giving also the equivalent mili (?), a \"Latin\" mile, 462.\n\n\\(^4\\) ? \"What nature hast thou?\"\nfills him all the more with grief; the coral-rooted crystal shines on the rose of the lips.\n\n934. The rose is faded, it drips, the branch of the aloe-tree quivers, the cut crystal and ruby are changed into lapis-lazuli.\\(^1\\) He strengthened himself against death; against him it vaunted not itself.\\(^2\\) He said: \"Why should I wonder at darkness since thou, O sun, hast abandoned me!\"\n\n935. He said to the sun: \"O sun, I compare thee to the cheeks of T'hinat'hin, thou art like her and she is like thee, ye light mountain and valley. The sight of thee rejoices me a madman, therefore unweariedly I gaze on thee; but why have you (both) left my heart cold, unwarmed?\"\\(^3\\)\n\n936. The absence of one sun for a month in winter freezes us; I, alas! have parted from two; how, then, should heart not be harmed? Only a rock perceives not, is never hurt!\\(^4\\) A knife cannot cure a wound; it cuts or causes a swelling.\"\\(^5\\)\n\n937. Wending his way he laments to the sky, he speaks; to the sun he says: \"O sun, to thee I pray, thou mighty of the mightiest mights,\\(^6\\) who exaltest the humble, givest sovereignty, happiness (?); part me not from my beloved, turn not my day to night!\"\\(^7\\)\n\n938. \"Come, O Zual,\\(^8\\) add tear to tear, woe to woe; dye my heart black, give me to thick gloom, heap upon me a heavy load of grief as on an ass; (but) say to her: 'Forsake him not! Thine he is, and for thee he weeps.'\n\n939. \"O Musht'har,\\(^9\\) I entreat thee, thou just, perfect judge, come and do justice, heart takes counsel\\(^10\\) with heart; twist not justice, destroy not thus thy soul. I am righteous, judge me, why wouldst thou wound afresh me wounded for her!\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lazhvardi, P., 1255.\n\n\\(^2\\) Amist'hvis ar imkhneoda. The passage would be clearer but for the ar; it might then read, \"on that account he emboldened himself\"\u2014khneva.

The sun whirls me, lets me not go, unites with me and gives me over to burning. Sit down to write my woes! For ink I give thee a lake of tears, for pen I cut for thee a trim form, slim as a reed.\"\\(^5\\)\n\n943. \"Come, O Moon, take pity on me; I shrink and am wasted like thee; the sun fills me, the sun, too, empties me; sometimes I am full-bodied, sometimes I am spare. Tell her my tortures, what afflicts me, how I faint. Go, say: 'Forsake him not!' I am hers, and for her sake I die.\n\n944. \"Behold, the stars bear witness, even the seven\\(^6\\) confirm my words: the sun, Otarid, Musht'har and Zual faint\\(^7\\) for my sake; moon, Aspiroz, Marikh, come and bear me witness; make her hear what fires consume me without thee (her).\"\n\n945. Now he says to his heart: \"As the tear still flows, and is not dried, what avails it to slay thyself! It is clear thou hast fraternized with the devil as a brother. I myself know that she who maddened me has for hair the tail of a raven; but if thou bearest not grief what is the enduring of joy?\"\\(^8\\)\n\n946. \"If I remain, this is better for me\"\u2014he speaks of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mars, planet of vengeance.\n\\(^2\\) Hesperus, Venus, planet of healing.\n\\(^3\\) Marge ra.\n\\(^4\\) Mercury, planet of learning.\n\\(^5\\) Marr, xii. 26, 28.

When the knight's song was heard, the beasts came\nto listen; by reason of the sweetness of his voice even the\nstones came forth from the water, they hearkened, they\nmarvelled, when he wept they wept; he sings sad songs,\ntears flow like a fount.\n\n947a. All living creatures on earth came to applaud:\ngame from the forest, fishes in the water, crocodiles in\nthe sea, birds from the sky, from India, Arabia, Greece,\nOrientals and Occidentals, Russians, Persians, Franks and\nEgyptians from Misret'hi.\n\nXXVII\n\nOF AVT'HANDIL'S GOING TO P'HRIDON'S WHEN\nHE PARTED FROM TARIEL\n\n948. Weeping the knight went seventy days along the\nroad to the seashore. Afar off he saw in the sea sailors\napproaching; he waited and asked: \"Who are you, I beg\nyou to tell me this: Whose realm is this or whose voice\ndoth it obey?\"\n\n949. They dutifully answered: \"O fair of face and form,\nstrange and pleasing to us thou seemest, therefore with\npraise we address thee; hereunto is the boundary of the\nTurks, marching with the border of P'hridon, whose (men)\nwe are; of him shall we tell thee, if we faint not from\ngazing on thee.\n\n1 This quatrain is not in the editions of Karthv. and Car.; it is\nevidently spurious.\n2 Niangi; ? sea for Nile.\n3 Mashriqni da maghribelni, A.\n4 Egypt.\n5 A prose translation of this chapter into Russian, by Abashidze, is\nprinted by Professor Khakhanov (Ocherki, ii. 270-274), from Kavkaz,\nNo. 22 of 1849.\n6 Thurkt'ha.\n950. \"Nuradin P'hridon is king of this our land, a knight\\(^1\\) brave, generous, mighty, on horseback a swift racer; none has power to harm so fair a sun; he is our lord, he like the beams spread forth from heaven.\"\n\n951. The knight said: \"My brethren, in you have I happed upon good men. I seek your king, teach me whither I should go. How shall I go, when shall I come thither, how long is the road?\" The sailors guided him; they left not the shore.\n\n952. They reported to him: \"This is the road going to Mulghazanzar,\\(^2\\) there our king will meet thee, he of the swift arrow, the keen sword. Thou shalt arrive there ten days hence, O thou of the cypress form, ruby in hue. Alas! why dost thou, a stranger, burn us strangers, why consumest thou us like a flame of fire!\"\n\n953. The knight said: \"I marvel, brethren, why you are heart-slain for me, or how the faded winter roses can please you thus! If you had seen us then when we sat proud, uncrippled,\\(^3\\) we charmed them that gazed on us, with us they sat joyful.\"\n\n954. They\\(^4\\) departed, the knight turned to pursue his road, he whose form is like the cypress, whose heart is like iron. He puts his horse to a canter, he discourses, he speaks aloud to comfort himself; the narcissi (his eyes) thunder, it rains tears, they lave the crystal and glass (of his face).\n\n955. Whatever strangers he met on the road served him, were subservient to him; they came to gaze on him, they courted him, it was hard for them to let him go, scarce could they bear parting, they gave him a guide\\(^5\\) for the road, whatever he asked they told him.\n\n956. He neared Mulghazanzar; soon he ended the long road. In the plain he saw an army of soldiers, and they were seen to be destroying game; on all sides a chain\\(^6\\) was formed, they encircled the outside of the field; they\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Moqme.\n\\(^2\\) 583, 956, 1436.\n\\(^3\\) Sapqari, 130, 600, 1529.\n\\(^4\\) Igi (for igini), 967, 1028.\n\\(^5\\) Qulauz, P., Turk.\n\\(^6\\) Alqa, 73.\nshot and shouted, they mowed down beasts like standing corn.\\footnote{Mdcheli, Ch., standing corn; Car., sheaf.}\n\n957. He met a man, he asked him tidings of that host; he said: \"Whose is this sound of trampling and stir?\" He answered: \"P'hridon the monarch, King of Mulghazanzar, hunts, he holds the edge of the sedgy plain engirt.\"\n\n958. Matchless in mien he went towards the troops, he became merry, how can I ever tell the beauty of that knight! Those who are parted from him he makes to freeze, like the sun he burns them that are met with him; he renews,\\footnote{Aakhlebs for ganaakhlebs, Ch.; but Car. reads akhelebs, drives mad.} if they look on him, those who gaze, his form sways\\footnote{Lertsamobs, sways like a reed.} like a tree.\n\n959. In the very midst\\footnote{Qolli, A., centre of an army; Car. gives tsre as synonym; cf. alqa; 73, 956.} of the hosts an eagle soared from somewhere. The knight urged on his horse, he emboldened himself, he feared not; he drew his bow and let the arrow fly; (the eagle) fell and blood flowed (from it); he dismounted and clipped its wings; calmly he remounted, he panted not.\n\n960. When they saw him, the archers ceased to shoot; they broke the circle, they came, they pressed upon him, they fainted, from all sides they surrounded him, some followed behind. They dared not ask him: \"Who art thou?\" nor could they say aught to him.\n\n961. In the meadow was a hill, on it stood P'hridon; forty men worthy to shoot with him attended him; thither Avt'handil made his way, after him followed the centre of the host. P'hridon marvelled. \"What are they doing?\" said he; he was angry with his armies.\n\n962. P'hridon sent out a slave, saying: \"Go, see the armies, what they are doing, why they have broken the circle, whither blind\\footnote{Brmani; Karthv. edition, qrmani.} like they go.\" The slave swiftly reached them, he saw the cypress, the sapling form: he\nstood, his eyes became dazed, he forgot the words he had to say.\n\n963. Avt'handil perceived that this (man) was come to learn news of him. He said: \"I beg thee to convey this message to thy lord from me: 'I am a stranger, lonely, far removed from my home,\\(^1\\) sworn brother to Tariel, sent to you.'\"\n\n964. The slave went to P'hridon to tell him his message. He said: \"I have seen a sun arrived, he seems like the lightener of day. I think even sages would be maddened if they saw him anywhere. Quoth he: 'I am Tariel's brother (thus come) rudely\\(^2\\) to join P'hridon.'\"\n\n965. When he heard (the name of) Tariel, P'hridon's woes were lightened, from his eyes tears sprang forth, his heart grew more agitated,\\(^3\\) a blast froze the rose, from his eyelids whirled snowstorms (of tears). They met each other, each was praised by the other, not dispraised.\n\n966. Hastily P'hridon came down from the ridge; he descended to meet (Avt'handil). When he looked on him he said: \"If this be not the sun, who is it?\" (Avt'handil) outdid the praise (P'hridon) had heard from the slave. They both dismounted: joy made tears gush up.\n\n967. They embraced; they were not shy for being strangers. The knight seems peerless to P'hridon, and P'hridon pleases the knight. Any onlookers who saw them (would) despise the sun. Slay me! if another like them will ever be bargained for or sold in the bazaar.\n\n968. What knights\\(^4\\) are there like P'hridon! But near him is one whom praises still more befit; the sun makes the planets invisible when they come near; a candle gives no light by day, but its rays shine by night.\n\n969. They mounted their horses and set out for P'hridon's palace. The chase was broken up; they made an end of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Samgopt'ha*, haunts, abodes.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Mkisisad*, qualifying *shegrad*; *mkise*, 182, 370, 677, 1049. M. Beridze, who has made some valuable suggestions, interprets the phrase: \"I am . . . (come) to join the disconsolate P'hridon.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) *Auchukda*; Ch. gives *audughda*, boiled, as synonym.\n\n\\(^4\\) *Moqmeni*, companions in arms.\nthe slaying of beasts. From all sides the troops thronged to gaze on Avt'handil; they said: \"What creature can compare with him?\"\n\n970. The knight said to P'hridon: \"Thou art eager, I know, to hear my tidings. I will tell thee who I am, whence I come, inasmuch as thou wishest to know, also whence I know Tariel and why I spoke of our brotherhood. He calls me brother; 'Thou art my brother,' quoth he, though I am scarce worthy to be his slave.\"\n\n971. \"I am King Rosten's vassal, a knight nurtured in Arabia, Grand Commander-in-Chief; by name they call me Avt'handil, I am a noble of great family, reared as son of the king, one to be respected, bold, none dares meddle with me.\n\n972. \"One day the king mounted, went forth to hunt; in the plain we saw Tariel, he poured forth tears watering the fields; we were astonished, he surprised us, we called and he came not, he made us angry; we knew not how fire consumed him.\n\n973. \"The king shouted to the troops to seize him, and he was irritated; without trouble he slew, battle was not grievous to him; of some he broke the arms and legs, some he slew outright; there they learned that the course (chariot) of the moon is not to be turned back.\n\n974. \"The king, greatly indignant, perceived that the troops could not capture him; himself he mounted and went against him, the haughtily unfearing. When Tariel knew it was the king, then he avoided his sword, he gave the reins to his horse, he was lost to our eyes.\n\n975. \"We sought and could find no trace; we believed it devilry. The king was sad, forbad drinking, feast and banquet. I could not endure lack of certainty about his\n\n1 Qmobasa, of slavery. 2 Qma. 3 Moqme.\n4 Spaspeti, P., 40, 1240.\n5 Etli, planet, constellation, chariot, 269, 1072.\n6 \"'Twas only then we understood that a planet is not to be diverted from its course\" (Abashidze).\n7 Reverence for royalty, 97, 836; Abashidze: \"Tariel sheathed his sword.\"\n8 Ar dasturoba, dasturi, P., 129, 1267.\nstory. I stole away in quest of him, fire burned me, and smouldering.\\footnote{Muroba, smoke of a lamp, soot, etc.}\n\n976. \"Three years I sought him; I enjoyed not even sleep. I saw Khatavians\\footnote{Cathayans, 196, 386, etc.} he had mauled; they showed him to me. I found the yellowish rose, faint-rayed, pale-tinted; he welcomed me and loved me like a brother, like a son.\n\n977. \"He took the caves from the Devis after great bloodshed. There Asmat'h attends the solitary, none else is with him; ever the old fire burns him, it is not newly roused. Groaning befits one parted from him, a black mourning kerchief bound round the head.\n\n978. \"Alone in the cave the tearful, tear-stained damsel weeps. The knight hunts game for her as a lion for its whelp; he brings it, and thus he feeds her. He cannot rest in one place. Save her (Asmat'h) he desires not the sight of any of man's race.\n\n979. \"To me, a stranger, he pleasantly narrated his wondrous and pleasing (story); he told me his tale, and his beloved's. What woe he has suffered this tongue of a madman cannot now tell; longing slays him, and lack of the sight of his grave-digger.\n\n980. \"Like the moon he unceasingly roams, he rests not; he sits on that horse thou gavest him, he never alights; he sees no speaking being, like a wild beast he shuns men. Woe is me, remembering him; alas for him dying for her sake!\n\n981. \"The fire of that knight burns me, I am consumed with hot fire; I pitied him, and I became mad, my heart grew furious; I wished to seek remedies for him by sea and land. I returned and saw the sovereigns, whose hearts were gloomy.\n\n982. \"I entreated leave of absence; the king was enraged at me, and fell into sadness. I deserted my soldiers, therefore they there cried, 'Woe!' I stole away, I freed myself from the flood of tears of blood.\\footnote{? \"I ceased to shed tears of blood.\"} Now I seek balm for him; I turn about hither and thither.\n983. \"He told me tidings of thee, how he had made brotherhood with thee. Now have I found thee, peerless, worthy to be praised by the tongue; counsel me where it is better to seek that heavenly sun, the joy of those who gaze on her, the disturber of those that cannot see her.\"\n\n984. Now P'hridon speaks, utters the words spoken by that knight (Tariel); both in unison lamented in a threnody worthy of praise; sobbing, they wept with impatient hearts, there the roses were sprinkled by the water of tears dammed up in the jungle.\n\n985. Among the soldiers there arose the sound of great weeping, the scratching of the face by some, from others comes a torrent (of tears). P'hridon weeps, laments aloud the seven years' separation. Alas! the inconstancy and falsity of this vain world!\n\n986. P'hridon laments: \"How can we tell forth thy (i.e., Tariel's) praise, thou who canst not be praised, thou inexpressible one! O sun of the earth, who transferrest the sun of the firmament from its course, joy, life, quickener of them that are near thee; light of the planets of heaven, consumer and swallower up!\"\n\n987. \"Since I was removed from thee life has been hateful to me. Though thou hast no leisure for me I long for thee; to thee lack of me seems joy, it oppresses me greatly. Life without thee is empty; the world is become hateful to me.\"\n\n988. P'hridon uttered these words in a beautiful lament. They grew calm, they were silent; they rode with no sign\n\n---\n\n1 Tevri, fig., eyelashes, 222.\n2 Sreva midisa; Ch., sreva, shooting of arrows\u2014fig., torrential rain; Car., throwing away of the veil.\n3 ? by being a sun on earth; or, ? \"who surpassest the planets of the sun.\"\n4 Damam'thkmelo, Car. reading and rendering; Ch. reading damnt'hhmelo does not seem to be in his dictionary.\n5 Okheri, empty house; okhrad, 1191.\n6 Mot'hkma (219), recitative; such passages and the various kebani, 5, 46, 68, 144, 438, 450, 595, 603, 711, 754, 881, 983, 1027, 1073, 1430, 1435, 1512, 1524, and khotbani, 3, 1009, 1025, are interesting, in conjunction with the popular ballads on the subject of the poem, as data for the solution of the question of the possible formation of the epic from pre-existing native material.\nof song. Avt'handil is fair to beholders in his ethereal loveliness; he covers the inky lakes (of his eyes) with the jet ceiling (of his lashes).\n\n989. They entered the city, there they found the palace adorned in perfection, with all the officers of state mustered, the slaves delicately apparelled were in faultless order; they were enraptured and ravished in heart with Avt'handil.\n\n990. They entered and held a great court, not a privy council; on this side and on that side ten times ten magnates were ranged; apart sat the two together; who can tell forth their praise? Here glass, there jet, adorned the crystal and ruby (of their faces).\n\n991. They sat, they banqueted, they multiplied the best liquor; they entertained Avt'handil as kinsman (treats) kinsman; they brought beautiful vessels, all quite new. But the heart of those who looked on that youth, alas! was given to flame.\n\n992. That day they drank, they ate, there was a banquet for the tribe of drinkers. Day dawned; they bathed Avt'handil; there lies abundance of satin; they clad him in raiment worth many thousands of dracanis; they girded him with a girdle of inestimable worth.\n\n993. The knight tarried some days, though he could not brook delay; he went out hunting with P'hridon and sported, he slew alike from far and near whatever offered itself to his hand; his archery put every Bowman to shame.\n\n994. The knight said to P'hridon: \"Hear what I have now to tell thee.

P'hridon answered: \"Nothing shall be said by me to hinder thee. I know thou hast no more time; another lance pierces thee. Go! God will guide thee, may thy foes be destroyed! But tell me, how shall I bear the lack of thee?\"\\(^3\\)\n\n997. \"This I venture to tell thee: It is not fitting that thou go away alone, I will give thee knights\\(^4\\) with thee to serve and attend thee, armour and beasts,\\(^5\\) a mule, a horse. If thou take not these thou wilt have trouble, tears will flow on the rose cheeks.\"\n\n998. He brought out four slaves,\\(^6\\) trustworthy in heart,\\(^7\\) complete armour for each man, with armpieces\\(^8\\) and greaves,\\(^9\\) sixty pounds\\(^10\\) of the red (gold), full weight, not with any shortage, a peerless stallion with complete harness.\\(^11\\)\n\n999. On a strong-legged mule he packed bedding. He set out, and P'hridon mounted and went forth with him also. Now fire burned and consumed him who awaited the parting. He laments: \"If the sun were near us, winter could not freeze us!\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Dghe-crusa*; Ch.

The rumour of the knight's departure spread, they gave themselves up to grief; the burgesses flocked together, those who sold silk goods like those who sold fruit; the voice of their lamentation was like thunder in the air; they said: \"We are removed from the sun; come, let us close our eyes.\"  \n\n1001. They passed through the city, they went on, they came to the seashore where P'hridon had formerly seen the sun (Nestan) seated (? landed); there they shed a rivulet of blood from the lake of tears. P'hridon tells the story of that shining captive.\n\n1002. \"Hither the two slaves brought by ship the sun, white-teethed, ruby-lipped\u2014a black sight! I spurred my horse, I determined to steal her by sword and arm; they saw me from afar, they soon fled from me, the boat seemed like a bird.\"\n\n1003. They embraced each other, they multiplied the springs of tears; they kissed, and both their fires were renewed; the inseparable sworn brothers parted like brothers. P'hridon remained, the knight went away, the form the slayer of gazers.\n\nXXVIII\n\nAVT'HANDIL'S DEPARTURE FROM P'HRIDON TO SEEK NESTAN-DAREDJAN\n\n1004. The knight speaks as he goes on his way (majestically) like the full moon; there is the thought of T'hinat'hin to gladden his heart. He says: \"I am far from thee; alas! the falseness of cursed Fate! Thou hast the healing balsam for my wound.\n\n1 Lari, 1042.\n2 Tsukhili, ? grief: \"let us yield our eyes to grief.\"\n3 Mnat'hobisa tqvisasa, ? captive luminary (planet).\n4 \"The two black-faced slaves landed from a ship . . .\" (Abashidze). Sakhedvit'ha shavit'ha, \"with a black sight,\" may refer to the slaves, or their clothes, or their black looks, or all these combined.\n1005. \"Why doth the ardour of grief for the heroes continually burn me? why is my heart of rock and cliff become a hard rock? even three lances cannot show a bruise on me. Thou art the cause that this world is thus envenomed for me.\"\n\n1006. Avt'handil fares on alone to the seashore with the four slaves, with all his might he seeks balm for Tariel; weeping by day and night he pours forth pools of tears; all the world seems to him as straw, even as straw in weight.\n\n1007. Wherever he sees travellers walking by the shore he addresses them, he asks tidings of that sun (Nestan). He roamed a hundred days. He went up a hill; camels loaded with stuff appeared; merchants distressed stood in perplexity on the shore.\n\n1008. A countless caravan was there on the seashore, they were distressed, they were gloomy, they could neither stand nor go forward. The knight greeted them; they hailed him with praise. He asked: \"Merchants, who are ye?\" They began to converse.\n\n1009. Usam was the chief of the caravan, a wise man. He uttered respectfully a perfect eulogy, he invoked blessings on (Avt'handil) and praised his manners; he said: \"O sun, thou art come as our life and comforter. Dismount; we will tell thee our story and business!\"\n\n1010. He dismounted. They said: \"We are Bagdad merchants, holders of the faith of Mahmad; we never drink new wines; we haste to trade in the city of the Sea-King: we are rich in wholesale goods, we have no cut pieces of stuff.\n\n---\n\n1 Samsalebisa, with different meanings, is the ending of all the four lines of this taepi (quatrain), of which the sense is somewhat doubtful. For sali, cf. 330, 567, 1224, 1316.\n2 Samsala.\n3 Tariel and P'hridon, or? \"of heroes.\"\n4 Separation from Thinat'hin, Tariel, and P'hridon.\n5 Leba.\n6 Gasamsaleba, envenom.\n7 Cf. 238.\n8 Mokaravneni, they of the caravan.\n9 Daqrit'h, 734.\n10 A., leader of caravan, here used as proper name.\n11 Khotba, P.\n12 Madjari.\n13 Sakonel srulni.\n14 Lari, silk stuff, goods in general, merchandise, treasure; nadjari, cut off, torn, second-hand.\n1011. \"Here on the seashore we found a man lying senseless; we succoured him till he could speak clearly with his tongue. We asked him: 'Who art thou, stranger? What business dost thou follow after?' He said to us: 'If ye go in they will slay you. It is well that I still live!'\n\n1012. \"He said: 'From Egypt we set out with a caravan and a guard, we embarked upon the sea laden with many kinds of stuff, there pirates (in ships) with sharp (iron) pointed wooden rams slew us. All was lost; I know not how I came hither.'\n\n1013. \"O lion and sun, this is the reason of our standing here. If we return, our loss will be a hundredfold; if we embark, alas! they may slay us, we have no strength for battle. We cannot stay, we cannot go, the power to maintain ourselves is gone from us.\"\n\n1014. The knight said: \"Whoever grieves is nought, and strives in vain; whatever comes from above, we cannot avoid its coming. I am surety for your blood, I take upon myself what you shall shed; whoever fights with you, my sword will wear itself out on your foes.\"\n\n1015. They of the caravan were filled with great joy; they said: \"He is some knight, some hero, not timid like us, he has self-confidence, let us be calm in heart.\" They embarked, they went on board ship, they set out from the coast.\n\n1016. With pleasant weather they journeyed without hardship; their convoyer, Avt'handil, leads them with brave heart. A pirate ship appeared with an exceedingly long\n\n---\n\n1 Eri, people, nation; also, host, army, troops; 1053. Cf. Djavakhov: Gosud-stroi drevnei Gruzii, p. 62.\n2 Mecobre, 54, 193, 1201.\n3 Saklinsi, Ch. Dict., plough; 1016, 1021.\n4 Rchoma, ? here \"to bestir ourselves.\"\n5 Predestination, 189, 776, 1018, 1072.\n6 Qma.\n7 Dchabuci, P., 580, 1036, 1221. The word is used in Persian in the sense of \"swift, clever, elegant\"; in Bokhara it seems to mean \"aristocrat.\" In the Georgian Bible (Gen. xxv. 27) we find it signifies \"boy, youth\" (M., xii., xxxiii).\n8 Badraga, P.\nflag; that ship had an (iron-shod) plough\\(^1\\) with (beam of) wood for shattering\\(^2\\) ships.\n\n1017. (The pirates) yelled and came on, they shouted and trumpeted; the caravan was afraid of the multitude of those warriors. The knight spoke: \u201cFear not their hardihood\\(^3\\); either I slay them all or this is the day of my death.\n\n1018. \u201cNought undecreed can they do to me, even if all the hosts on earth engage me; if it be decreed, I shall not survive, the spears are ready for me, neither strongholds nor friends, not even brothers, can save me; he who knows this is stout-hearted like me.\n\n1019. \u201cYou merchants are cowards, unskilled in war. Lest they slay you with the arrow from afar, shut the doors behind you. Behold me alone how I fight, how I use my lion-like arms; see how I make the blood of the corsair\u2019s\\(^4\\) crew flow.\u201d\n\n1020. With gesture\\(^5\\) like a swift\\(^6\\) panther he clad his form in armour; in one hand he held an iron mace. He stood forth with dauntless heart in the front of the ship, and as he slew onlookers with his gaze, so he slew foes with his sword.\n\n1021. Those warriors yelled; their voices were uninterrupted. They thrust the beam upon which was the plough. The knight stood\\(^7\\) fearless at the head of the ship, he trembled not; he struck with the mace, he broke the beam, the lion\u2019s arm swerved not.\n\n1021(a). The beam was destroyed, and Avt\u2019handil remained with ship unshattered. Those warriors feared, they sought a way to shelter, they could not contrive it in time; he leaped on his foes, threshing them down round about him; there was not left there living man unhacked by him.\\(^8\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sakhnisi, 1012, 1021.  \n\\(^2\\) Letsa, thresh, shatter, 166.  \n\\(^3\\) Sialp\u2019he. Cf. ali, flame; according to Ch., sialp\u2019here, ruby-colouredness, but there seems to be no certainty that such a word exists; 487, 1264, 1492.  \n\\(^4\\) Mecobre, 54.  \n\\(^5\\) Ktzeva.  \n\\(^6\\) Merchkhali; Ch., \u201csharp-clawed.\u201d  \n\\(^7\\) Kve, 1091, 1217, 1219.  \n\\(^8\\) This quatrain is in Ch.; Car., and Karthv., omit.\n1022. With intrepid heart he slew those warriors like goats; some he threw down on the ship, some he cast into the sea; he threw one upon another, eight upon nine and nine upon eight\\(^1\\); those who were left were hidden among the corpses, they stifled their cries.\n\n1023. As much as his heart desired was he victorious in the fight with them. Some humbly adjured him: \"Slay us not, by thy faith!\" Those he slew not, he enslaved them, whoever survived his wounds. Truly saith the Apostle: \"Fear makes love.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n1024. O man! boast not of thy strength, brag not drunken like! Might is of none avail if the power of the Lord aid thee not. A tiny spark overcomes, and burns up great trees. If God protect thee, it cuts alike well whether thou strike with a log or a sword.\\(^3\\)\n\n1025. There Avt'handil saw their great treasures. He grappled twin-like ship to ship. He called the caravan. Usam was merry when he saw, he rejoiced, he lamented not, he spoke a eulogy\\(^4\\) in his praise, he gave form to great imaginings.\\(^5\\)\n\n1026. Praisers of Avt'handil need even a thousand tongues; even they could not tell how fair he appeared after the fight. The caravan shouted, saying: \"Lord, thanks to Thee! The sun has shed down on us his beams; the dark night has broken into day for us.\"\n\n1027. They came up to him, they kissed his head, face, feet, hand; they spoke praise\\(^6\\) unstinted to the fair, the praiseworthy; the sight of him maddens the wise man as well as the fool!\\(^7\\) \"We all are saved by thee in so hard a mischance.\"\n\n1028. The knight said: \"Thanks to God, the Creator, Maker\\(^8\\) of all, by whom the heavenly powers decree what\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. \"seven or eight,\" 622, 633, 689, 1563; \"nine,\" 1167.\n\n\\(^2\\) ? 1 John iv. 18 in a garbled form.\n\n\\(^3\\) Marr.\n\n\\(^4\\) Khotba, A., 3, 1009.\n\n\\(^5\\) ? \"(who) had accomplished a great feat.\"\n\n\\(^6\\) Keba, 5, 603, 1073, etc.\n\n\\(^7\\) ? \"makes the wise as mad as the fool.\"\n\n\\(^8\\) Mkhadi arst'ha, Maker of beings; but ? mkhedi, 112, 1119.\nis to be done here; 'tis they\\(^1\\) that do all deeds hidden and some\\(^2\\) revealed. It is necessary to everyone to believe; a wise man has faith in the future.\\(^3\\)\n\n1029. \"God hath deigned to spare your blood, so many souls! I, alas! vain earth, what am I? Of myself, what have I done? Now I have slain your foes, I have fulfilled what I spoke; I have brought you the ship complete with its wealth as a gift.\"\n\n1030. Pleasant it is when a good knight\\(^4\\) has won the battle, when he has surpassed his comrades who were with him. They congratulated him, they praised him, in this state they were ashamed.\\(^5\\) The wound becomes him well, but little was he hurt.\n\n1031. That day they looked at that ship of the corsairs, they put not off till the morrow. How could they count the quantity of treasure lying there! They conveyed it to their ship, they completely emptied the (pirate) ship; they smashed it up and burned some of it;\\(^6\\) the wood they bartered not for sixpence.\\(^7\\)\n\n1032. Usam conveyed to Avt'handil a message from the merchants: \"We are strengthened by thee; we know our baseness. Whatever we have is thine, of this there can be no doubt; whatever thou givest us, let it be ours, we have made an assembly\\(^8\\) here.\"\n\n1033. The knight announced: \"O brothers, but now ye heard it: the stream which flowed from your eyes has been perceived by God, He hath saved you alive. What am I? What joy, alas! have I given you? What could I do with whatever you gave me? I have myself and my horse!\n\n1034. \"As much treasure as I desired to amass I had of mine own, countless priceless coverlets of silk.

What do I want? I am but your companion. Moreover, I have some other dangerous business.\n\n1035. \"Now, of this countless treasure I have found here, take what you each wish; I shall be a claimant against none. One thing I entreat: grant my request, one not to be mistrusted; I have a certain matter to be kept hidden within you.\n\n1036. \"Till the time comes, speak not of me as if I were not your master. Say, 'He is our chief,' call me not knight. I will clothe myself as a merchant, I will begin chaffering; keep the secret, by the brotherhood between us.\"\n\n1037. This thing very greatly rejoiced the caravan; they came and saluted him, saying: \"It is our hope\u2014the very request we should have made to you, you yourself have made to us\u2014that we may serve him whose face we acknowledge as the face of the sun.\"\n\n1038. Thence they departed and travelled on, they wasted no time; they met fair weather, they sailed ever pleasantly; they delighted in Avt'handil, they sang his praises; they presented him with a pearl of the tint of the knight's teeth.\n\nXXIX\n\nTHE STORY OF AVT'HANDIL'S ARRIVAL IN GULANSHARO\n\n1039. Avt'handil crossed the sea; with stately form went he. They saw a city engirt by a thicket of garden, with wondrous kinds of flowers of many and many a hue. In\n\n1 Minda; Ch., ginda. ra minda for ara minda, or rad minda, I do not want it.\n2 Thavisa tsasagebeli (?).\n3 Mlalavi, quarrelsome, 1209.\n4 Thavadi.\n5 Dchabuci, hero, 580, 1015.\n6 Chubachoba.\n7 Namusi, P., A., 369, 1229; also honour, reputation. do not let it be known that I am of high degree.\"\n8 Mdchevri, 137, 418, 676, 804, 1312.\n9 Bevri, myriad.\nwhat way canst thou understand the loveliness of that land!\n\n1040. With three ropes they moored the ship to the shore of those gardens. Avt'handil clad his form in a cloak\\(^1\\) and sat on a bench. They brought out men that were porters,\\(^2\\) provided with drachmas.\\(^3\\) That knight bargains, acts as chief (of the caravan), and thereby conceals himself.\n\n1041. Thither came the gardener of him at whose garden they had landed; with ecstasy he gazes at the knight's face flashing like lightning. Avt'handil hailed him, he spoke to the man with faultless words: \"Whose men are ye, who are ye? how call they the king reigning here?\"\n\n1042. \"Tell me all in detail,\" quoth the knight to that man; \"what stuff\\(^4\\) is dearer, or what is bought up cheap?\" He said: \"I see, thy face seems to me like the face of the sun. Whatever I know I will tell thee truly; I will by no means inform thee crookedly.\n\n1043. \"The Sea Realm is this, ten months' (travel) in extent, this is the city of Gulansharo,\\(^5\\) full of much loveliness. Hither everything fair cometh by ships sailing from sea to sea. Melik Su\u00eekhavi\\(^6\\) rules, perfect in good fortune and wealth.\\(^7\\)\n\n1044. \"Even if he be old, a man is rejuvenated by coming hither; drinking, rejoicing, tilting and songs are unceasing; summer and winter alike we have many-hued flowers; whoever knoweth us envieth us, even they who are our foes.\n\n1045. \"Great merchants can find nought more profitable than this: They buy, they sell, they gain, they lose; a poor man will be enriched in a month; from all quarters they gather merchandise; the penniless by the end of the year have money laid by.\n\n1046. \"I am gardener to Usen,\\(^8\\) chief of the merchants. I shall tell thee somewhat of the manner of his ordinance:\n\n\\(^1\\) Djuba, P., A., 218, 465. \\(^2\\) Mzidavi, ? hawkers from the city.\n\\(^3\\) Dramit'ha, drama, 371, 528, 573, 668, 1031.\n\\(^4\\) Lari, 54, 601, 1000, 1010, 1034, 1213.\n\\(^5\\) Gulan Shahr, P., the city of flowers; pl. in an (Abul, 180).\n\\(^6\\) A. \\(^7\\) Davla (dovlat'hi), P., A., 777, 1416. \\(^8\\) A., Husein.\nThis is his garden, your resting-place for the day; first it is necessary to show him all the fairest of your goods.\n\n1047. \"When great merchants arrive they see him and give him gifts, they show him what they have, elsewhere they cannot unpack their goods\\(^1\\); for the king they set aside the best, they straightway count out the price; thereupon he frees them to sell as they please.\n\n1048. \"His duty it is to receive such honourable folk as you, he orders the caterers how to entertain them fitly; he is not now here, what avails it me to speak of him? To meet you and carry you away with him, pressing you politely, is the way he should treat you.\n\n1049. \"P'hatman Khat'hun,\\(^2\\) the lady, his wife, is at home, a hospitable hostess, amiable, not rough.\\(^3\\) I shall inform her of your arrival, she will take you in as one of her own folk, she will send a man to meet you, you shall enter the city by daylight.\"\n\n1050. Avt'handil said: \"Go, do whatever thou desirest.\" The gardener runs, he rejoices, sweat pours down to his breast. He tells his tidings to the lady\\(^4\\): \"I boast of this: a youth\\(^5\\) comes, to them that look on him his rays seem like the sun.\n\n1051. \"He is some merchant, chief of a great caravan, well-grown like a cypress, a moon of seven days, his coat\\(^6\\) and the fold of his coral-hued turban\\(^7\\) become him; he called me, asked me tidings and the tariff for the purchase of goods.\"\\(^8\\)\n\n1052. Dame P'hatman rejoiced; she sent ten slaves to meet him; they prepared the caravanserais, she stored their wares. The rose-cheeked, crystal and ruby, glass, jet,\\(^9\\) entered; they who looked on him compared his feet to the panther's, his palms to the lion's (paws).\n\n1053. There was a hubbub, the hosts\\(^10\\) of the town all\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lari, 1042.  \n\\(^2\\) A., P'hatman, Fatima; A., khat'hun, lady.  \n\\(^3\\) Mkisi, ? boorish; 182, 677, 838, 964, 1325.  \n\\(^4\\) Khat'hun.  \n\\(^5\\) Qma here can hardly be \"knight.\"  \n\\(^6\\) Djuba, P., A., 1040.  \n\\(^7\\) Ride, veil; 123.  \n\\(^8\\) Lari, 1042.  \n\\(^9\\) Sat'hi, ?

P'hatman, Usen's wife, met him in front of the door, joyful she saluted him, she showed her pleasure; they greeted each other, they went in and seated themselves. As I have observed, his coming annoyed not Dame P'hatman.\n\n1055. Dame P'hatman was attractive to the eye, not young but brisk, of a good figure, dark in complexion, plump-faced, not wizened, a lover of (female) minstrels and singers, a wine-drinker; she had abundance of elegant gowns and head-dresses.\n\n1056. That night Dame P'hatman entertained him right well. The knight presented beautiful gifts; they that received them said: \"They are worthy!\" P'hatman's entertainment of him was worth while; by God! she lost not. When they had drunken and eaten, the knight went out to sleep.\n\n1057. In the morning he showed all his wares, he had them all unpacked; the fairest were laid aside for the king, he had the price counted out; he said to the merchants: \"Take them away!\" He loaded them, (and) had them carried away. He said: \"Sell as ye will; reveal not who I am!\"\n\n1 M., rulad, in the sense of dzilad; 1184.\n2 Sul-tasuli also means \"impatient\"; ? spurious quatrain.\n3 Ushalama.\n4 T'hvalad mardjve, \"rather good-looking.\"\n5 Mzmeli.\n6 Shav-gvremani.\n7 Mutribni, A., 356, 470, 704, 1440, 1528.\n8 To the caravanserai.\n9 Lari.\n10 Sep'he.\n11 Aheida.\n1058. The knight was clad as a merchant; he was by no means dressed in his proper raiment. Sometimes P'hatman calls on him, sometimes he visits P'hatman. They sat together; they conversed with refined discourse. Absence from him was death\\(^1\\) to P'hatman, as Ramin's was to Vis.\\(^2\\)\n\nXXXI\n\nP'HATMAN BECOMES ENAMOURED OF AVT'HANDIL; WRITES HIM A LETTER AND SENDS IT\n\n1059. Better, for him who can bear it, is aloofness from woman; she plays with thee\\(^3\\) and pleases thee, she wins thee over and trusts thee; but in a trice she betrays thee, she cuts whatever pierces\\(^4\\); so a secret should never be told to a woman.\n\n1060. Desire of Avt'handil went into the heart of Dame P'hatman, love grew from more to more, it burned her like fire, she essayed to conceal it, but could not hide her woes, she said: \"What am I to do, what will avail me?\" She rained, she poured forth tears.\n\n1061. \"If I tell him this, alas! he will be wroth, even the sight of him will become rare to me\\(^5\\); if I tell him not, I cannot endure it, the fire will become more intense. I will speak, let me die or live, let one (or other) be my lot! How can the physician cure him who tells not what hurts him?\"\n\n1062. She wrote a piteous letter to be presented to that youth concerning her love, revealing her sufferings, moving\n\n\\(^1\\) Hcvlida, killed.\n\\(^2\\) For the Story of the Loves of Vis and Ramin, cf. J.R.A.S., July, 1902. There are two other references in Rust'haveli, 182, 1519.\n\\(^3\\) Vilizghels, 86.\n\\(^4\\) Or, \"cuts wherever she penetrates\"; or, \"cuts in order to pierce\"\u2014an obscure phrase.\n\\(^5\\) Or, \"I shall be deprived of the sight of him.\"\nand shaking the listeners' heart, a letter\\(^1\\) to be kept,\\(^2\\) not to be idly torn up.\\(^3\\)\n\nXXXII\n\nTHE LETTER OF LOVE WRITTEN BY P'HATMAN TO AVT'HANDIL\n\n1063. \"O sun, since it pleased God to create thee a sun, thus a joy and not a desirer of woes to them removed from thee, a burner of those near united, a consumer of them with fire, thy glance seems sweet to the planets, a thing to be boasted of.\n\n1064. \"They that gaze on thee become enamoured of thee; for thy sake piteously they faint. Thou art the rose; I marvel why nightingales quiver not on thee. Thy beauty withers the flowers, and mine too are fading. If the sunbeams reach me not timely I am quite scorched.\n\n1065. \"God is my witness that I fear to tell you this, but, luckless, what can I do for myself? I am quite parted from patience; the heart cannot constantly endure the piercing of the black lashes! If by any means thou canst help me, then help, lest I lose my wits.\n\n1066. \"Till an answer to this letter reaches me, till I know if thou wilt slay me or reassure me\\(^4\\)\u2014till then shall I endure life, however much my heart pains me. Oh for the time when life or death will be decided for me!\"\n\n1067. Dame P'hatman wrote and sent the letter to the knight. The knight read it as if it were from a sister or kinswoman; he said: \"She knows not my heart. Who is she who courts\\(^5\\) the lover of her whose I am?\\(^6\\) The beloved I have\u2014how can I compare her (beauty) to this one's?\"\n\n1068. Said he: \"What hath the raven to do with the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ustari.\n\\(^2\\) Shesanakhavi, Ch. Dict.; but sanakhavi is \"spectacle,\" so the meaning may be \"a model letter,\" or \"a letter worth showing.\"\n\\(^3\\) Ar dasakheveli.\n\\(^4\\) Gagividodes means daidcherebe, Ch.\n\\(^5\\) Mashicobs, A.\n\\(^6\\) lit. \"Who courts whose whom.\"\nrose, or what have they in common? But upon it the nightingale has not yet sweetly sung. Every unfitting deed is brief, and then it is fruitless.\\(^1\\) What says she? What nonsense she talks! What a letter she has written!\\(^2\\)\n\n1069. This kind of thought he thought\\(^3\\) in his heart. Then said he to himself: \"Save thee I have no helper. For the sake of that for which I am a wanderer, since I wish to seek her (Nestan) I will do everything by which I can find her; what else should my heart heed!\"\\(^4\\)\n\n1070. \"This woman sits here seeing many men, a keeper of open house\\(^5\\) and a friend to travellers coming hither from all parts. I will consent, she will tell me all; however much the fire burns me with its flames, perchance she will be of some use to me; I shall know how to pay my debt to her.\"\n\n1071. He said: \"When a woman loves anyone, becomes intimate with him and gives him her heart, shame and dishonour she weighs not, being wholly accursed; whatever she knows she declares, she tells every secret.\\(^6\\) It is better for me, I will consent; perchance I shall somewhere find out the hidden thing.\"\n\n1072. Again he said: \"None can do aught if his planet\\(^7\\) favour him not;\\(^8\\) so what I want I have not, what I have I want not. The world is a kind of twilight, so here all is dusky.\\(^9\\) Whatever is in the pitcher,\\(^10\\) the same flows forth.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Okheri.\n\n\\(^2\\) ? \"blamed.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) The end justifies the means.\n\n\\(^4\\) Mosadgure, entertainer, innkeeper.\n\n\\(^5\\) 1059; cruli, ? fettered, cf. 700, 731, and 994 note.\n\n\\(^6\\) Elli, planet, constellation, fate; 269, 973, 1188.\n\n\\(^7\\) Most'hmindebis, ? \"if he endure not his fate\"; Ch., \"if his fate direct him not.\"\n\n\\(^8\\) If M.

Thou hast anticipated me, but\\(^2\\) the burning of the fire (of love) afflicts me more than thee. Thou wishest, I too want thy company uninterrupted. Our union is agreed\\(^3\\) since it is the desire of both.\"\n\n1074. I cannot tell thee how P'hatman's pleasure increased. She wrote: \"The tears I, absent from thee, have shed suffice. Now I shall be unaccompanied, here shalt thou find me alone; hasten my union with thee, to-night when evening falls. Come!\"\n\n1075. That very night when the letter of invitation was presented to the knight, when twilight was falling and he was going, another slave met him on the way (with the message): \"Come not to-night; thou shalt find me unready for thee.\" This vexed him, he turned not back, he said: \"What sort of thing is this?\"\\(^4\\)\n\n1076. The invited guest went not back again on the withdrawal of his invitation. P'hatman sits troubled. Avt'handil the tree-like went in alone. He perceived the woman's uneasiness, he saw it forthwith on his going in\\(^5\\); she could not reveal it from fear, and also out of complaisance for him.\\(^6\\)\n\n1077. They sat down together and began to kiss, to sport pleasantly, when a certain elegant youth\\(^7\\) of graceful mien appeared standing in the doorway. He entered; close behind followed a slave with sword and shield. When he saw Avt'handil he was afraid. \"It looks,\" quoth he (to himself), \"as if the road were rocky.\"\\(^8\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Keba, 1025, 1430.\n\n\\(^2\\) T'hvare, if not, otherwise.\n\n\\(^3\\) Piriani, also \"honest, right\" (?).\n\n\\(^4\\) Hgavso ege rasa, he said: \"To what is this like?\"\n\n\\(^5\\) Shesvlit'ha shevit'ha; ? shevit'ha for shevit'hvida\u2014thus rodesatz shevida, when he went in.\n\n\\(^6\\) T'hneva, to please, flatter.\n\n\\(^7\\) Qma.\n\n\\(^8\\) Oldiani, ? \"as if there were a rock on the road.\"\n1078. When P'hatman saw, she was afraid, she shook and fell a-trembling. (The stranger) gazed with wonder at them lying caressing; he said: \"I will not hinder, O woman\u00b9... but when day breaks I shall cause thee to repent that thou hast had this youth.\n\n1079. \"Thou hast shamed\u00b2 me, O wicked woman, and made me to be despised, but to-morrow thou shalt know the answer to be paid for this deed; I shall make thee to devour thy children with thy teeth; if I fail to do this, spit upon my beard,\u00b3 let me run mad in the fields!\"\n\n1080. Thus he spake, and the man touched his beard\u00b3 and went out of the door. P'hatman began to beat her head, her cheeks were scratched, the gurgling\u2074 of her tears flowing\u2075 like a fountain was heard. She said: \"Come, stone me with stone, let the throwers\u2076 approach!\"\n\n1081. She laments: \"I have, alas! slain my husband, I have killed off my little children, I have given away as loot our possessions, the peerless cut gems! I am separated from my dear ones! Alas! the upbringer! Alas! the upbrought! I have made an end of myself; shameful are my words!\"\n\n1082. Avt'handil hearkened to all this in perplexity.\u2077 He said: \"What troubles thee, what say'st thou, why dost thou thus lament, why did that youth\u2078 threaten thee, what fault found he in thee? Be calm; tell me who he was and on what errand he roved!\"\n\n1083. The woman replied: \"O lion! I am mad with the flow of tears; ask me no more tidings, nought can I tell thee with my tongue. I have slain my children with mine own hand, therefore can I no more be gay; impatient for thy love I have slain myself.\n\n1084. \"This kind of thing certainly should happen to\n\n\u00b9 P'her'tha midamo crt'homasa.\n\u00b2 Cf. gavicitzkhe, 612, 630.\n\u00b3 Tsvert'ha p'hu miqav; p'hu, faugh!

I doubt my sins will fill thee too with woe. If that knight go to court he will make me eat my children with my mouth.\"\n\n1087. When Avt'handil, the proud, gifted with bold resolve, heard this, he arose and took a mace\u2014how fair, how bold is he! \"To ignore this matter would be remissness on my part!\" said he. Think not any living is his like; there is none other like unto him!\n\n1088. To P'hatman he said: \"Give me a man as instructor, as guide, let him show me the road truly, else I want no helper; I cannot look on that man as a warrior and mine equal. What I do I shall tell thee; wait for me, be calm!\"\n\n1089. The woman gave him a slave as guide and leader. Again she cried out: \"Inasmuch as the hot fire is to be cooled, if thou slay that knight to assuage the irritation of my heart, he has my ring, I entreat thee to bring it hither.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Vaglakh shetseva, to lament the death of a neighbour as a sign of sympathy.\n2 Ch., movit'h mit'hkhar; Car., me vit'ha var.\n3 ? flee together.\n4 ? here \"punishment.\"\n5 Buneba ziari, Ch.

Thither is the sun-faced Avt'handil led by his guide, who says to him in a low voice: \u201cThis is the palace of him thou seekest.\u201d He shows it to him, and says: \u201cSeest thou him standing on yonder terrace?\u201d There he lies to sleep; know this, or thou shalt find him sitting.\u201d\n\n1092. Before the door of that luckless youth lay two guards.\\(^3\\) The knight (Avt'handil) passed, he stole in without making a sound; he put a hand on each of their throats, forthwith he slew them, he struck head upon head, brain and hair were mingled.\n\nXXXIV\n\nHERE IS THE SLAYING OF THE CHACHNAGIR\\(^4\\) AND HIS TWO GUARDS BY AVT'HANDIL\n\n1093. That youth lay alone in his chamber with angry heart.

He is a sun to them that gaze on him, a wild beast and a terror\\(^7\\) to those that oppose him. He cut off the finger with the ring, he hurled him down to the ground; he threw him from the window towards the sea, he was mingled with the sands of the sea; for him nowhere is there a tomb, nor spade to dig his grave.\n\n1095.

After a time we went forth merry, at our will; again we sat down to rejoice, we were not of their company.\"\n\n1103. \"At eventide I went into the garden to sport; I took the ladies with me, it behoved me to entertain them; I brought with me minstrels, they discoursed sweet song; I played and gambolled like a child, I changed veil and hair.\n\n1104. \"There in the garden were fair mansions beautifully built, lofty, with a prospect on every side, overhanging the sea. Thither I led the ladies, them that were with me; anew we made a banquet, we sat pleasantly, joyously.\n\n1105. \"Merry, I entertained the merchants' wives, pleasantly, in a sisterly way. While drinking, without any cause a distaste came upon me. When they perceived me thus, they separated, all that sat at meat. I was left alone; some sadness fell on my heart like soot.\n\n1106. \"I opened the window and turned my face to the sea, I looked out, I shook off the sadness growing within me. Far away I saw something small, it floated in the sea, methought a bird or beast; to what else could I liken it?\n\n1107. \"From afar I could not recognize it; when it came near it was a boat; two men clad in black, and black also of visage, on either side stood close; only a (? woman's) head appeared; they came ashore, that strange sight astonished me.\n\n1 Nebit'ha chvenit'ha, ? released from attendance.\n2 Muneburni, from mun \"there\" = ikaurni.

They looked thither, they looked hither, (to see) if any anywhere observed them, they saw no creature, nothing alarmed them. Secretly I watched them; I was quiet indoors.\n\n1109. \"What they landed from the boat in a chest\u2014 they took off the lid\u2014was a maiden of wondrous form, who stepped forth; on her head was a black veil, beneath she was clad in green. It would suffice the sun to be like her in beauty.\n\n1110. \"When the maiden turned towards me, rays rose upon the rock; the lightning of her cheeks flashed over land and sky; I blinked mine eyes, I could no more gaze on her than on the sun; I closed the curtain of the door on my side; they could not perceive that they were watched.\n\n1111. \"I called four slaves who waited upon me; I pointed: 'See what beauty the Indians hold captive! Steal down, go forth, quietly, not racing hastily. If they will sell her to you, give them the price, whatever they may be wanting.\n\n1112. \"'If they will not give her to you, let them not take her away, capture her from them, slay them, bring hither that moon, do the errand well, use your best endeavour!' My slaves stole down from above as if they flew: they chaffered, they sold not. I saw the blacks looked right ill pleased.\n\n1113. \"I stood at the window; when I saw they would not sell her, I cried: 'Slay them!' They seized them and cut off their heads, they threw them out into the sea; they turned back, they guarded the maiden. I went down to meet her, I took her, she had not tarried long on the seashore.\n\n1114. \"How can I tell thee her praise! what loveliness! what delicacy!

I am ready, no preparation is needed for this.\"\n\n1115. When she had ended these words, P'hatman rent her face with her hands; Av'thandil, too, wept, he shed hot tears; they forgot each other, for her (Nestan's) sake they became as mad; the spring (of tears) flowing down from above melted the slight new-fallen snow (of the cheek).\n\n1116. They wept. The knight said: \"Break not off! Conclude!\" P'hatman said: \"I received her; I made my heart faithful to her. I kissed her every part, and thereby I wearied her. I seated her on my couch, I caressed her, I loved her.\n\n1117. \"I said to her: 'Tell me, O sun, who thou art or of what race a child! Whither were those Ethiops\\(^2\\) taking thee, lady of the Pleiads\\(^3\\) of heaven?' To all these\\(^4\\) words she made me no answer. I saw a hundred springs of tears dropping from her eyes.\n\n1118. \"When I pressed her with questions, with much discourse, she wept with gentle voice, sobbing from the heart; a stream flowed through the jetty trough (of her lashes) from the narcissus (eyes), upon the crystal and ruby (of her cheeks). Gazing at her I burned, I became dead-hearted.\n\n1119. \"She said to me: 'To me thou art a mother, better than a mother. Of what profit can my story be to thee? It is but the tale of a chatterer. A lone wanderer am I, overtaken by an unhappy fate. If thou ask me aught, may the might of the All-seeing\\(^5\\) curse thee!'

With a thousand entreaties I could scarce persuade her to eat a little.\n\n1127. \u201cBy-the-by, I will tell thee of the wonder of the veil and cloak: I have seen all kinds of rare and costly things, but I know not of what sort of stuff hers were made, for it had the softness of woven material and the firmness of forged (metal).\n\n1128. \u201cThus that lovely one tarried long in my house. I could not trust my husband; I feared he would inform. I said to myself: \u2018If I tell him, I know the rascal\\footnote{P\u2019hliidi, 662, 685, 736, 763, 800, 985, 1032.} will betray my secret at court.\u2019 Thus I thought at my frequent goings in and comings out.\n\n1129. \u201cI said to myself: \u2018If I tell him not, what am I to do, what can I do for her?

Come, I will trust him, I will not wrong Usen; I will make him swear not to betray me; if he give me full assurance, he cannot doom his soul, he will not be an oath-breaker!\u2019\n\n1131. \u201cAlone I went to my husband; I frolicked and fondled him. Then I said to him: \u2018I will tell thee something, but first swear to me thou wilt tell no human being, give me a binding oath.\u2019 He swore a fearful oath: \u2018May I beat my head on the rocks!\n\n1132. \u201c\u2018What thou tellest me I will reveal to no soul, even unto death, neither to old nor young, friend nor foe!\u2019 Then I told all to that kind-hearted\\footnote{Lmobieri.} man, Usen: \u2018Come,\nI will lead thee to a certain place here; come, I will show thee the sun's peer.'\n\n1133. \"He rose to accompany me, we departed, we entered the palace\\(^1\\) gates.

For the knowledge of this story he magnified God with tears. P\u2019hatman thought of herself; therefore she was again burned up. The knight kept his secret, he lent himself to love; P\u2019hatman embraced his neck, she kissed his sun-like face.\n\n1230. That night P\u2019hatman enjoyed lying with Avt\u2019handil; the knight unwillingly embraces her neck with his crystal neck; remembrance of T\u2019hinat\u2019hin slays him, he quakes with secret fear, his maddened heart raced away to the wild beasts and ran with them.\n\n1231. Avt\u2019handil secretly rains tears, they flow to mingle with the sea; in an inky eddy floats a jetty ship.

The tears which flowed there from him would have melted a stone, the thicket of jet dammed them up, there is a pool on the rose-field. P'hatman rejoiced in him as if she were a nightingale; if a crow find a rose it thinks itself a nightingale.\n\n1233. Day dawned; the sun (Avt'handil) whose rays were soiled by the world went forth to bathe. The woman gave him many coats, cloaks, turbans, many kinds of perfumes, fair clean shirts. \"Whatsoever thou desirest,\" said she, \"put on; be not shy of me!\"\n\n1234. Avt'handil said: \"This day will I declare mine affair.\" The wearing of merchant garb had hitherto been his resolve. That day wholly in knightly raiment he apparelled his brave form; he increased his beauty, the lion resembled the sun.\n\n1235. P'hatman prepared a meal, to which she invited Avt'handil. The knight came in adorned, gaily, not with louring looks. P'hatman looked, she was astonished that he was not in merchant garb; she smiled at him: \"Thus is it better for the pleasure of them that are mad for thee.\"\n\n1236. P'hatman exceedingly admired his beauty. He made no answer, he smiled to himself: \"It seems she does not recognize me!\" How foolishly he behaved, how he invited (her)! Though he took some liberty he did not go farther.\n\n1237. When they had eaten they separated, the knight went home; having drunk wine, he lay down merry, pleasantly he fell asleep. At eventide he awoke; he shed his rays across the fields. He invited P'hatman: \"Come, see me, I am alone, quite alone!\"\n\n---\n\n1 Iadoni, Gr.

For \"he\" read \"she\" in these two lines.\n1238. P'hatman went, Avt'handil heard her voice making moan; she said: \"Undoubtedly I am slain by him whose form is like an aloe-tree.\" He set her at his side; he gave her a pillow from his carpet. The shade from the eaves of the eyelashes overshadows the rose-garden (of the cheeks):\n\n1239. Avt'handil said: \"O P'hatman, I know thee; thou wilt tremble at these tidings like one bitten by a serpent; but hitherto thou hast not heard the truth concerning me: my slayers are black lashes, trees of jet.\n\n1240. \"Thou thinkest me some merchant, master of a caravan; I am the Commander-in-Chief of the exalted king Rostevan, chief of the great host befitting him; I have the mastery over many treasuries and arsenals.\u2014\"\n\n1241. \"I know thee to be a good friend, faithful, trusty.\u2014He has one daughter, a sun the enlightener of lands; she it is who consumes me and melts me; she sent me, I forsook my master, her father.\n\n1242. \"That damsel thou hadst\u2014to seek that same damsel, that substitute for the sun, I have gone over the whole world; I have seen him who roves for her sake, where he, pale lion, lies wasting himself, his heart and strength.\"\n\n1243. Avt'handil told all his own tale to P'hatman, the story of the donning of the panther hide by Tariel. He said: \"Thou art the balm of him thou hast not yet seen, the resource of (him of) frequent eyelash, ruffled like a raven's wing.\n\n---\n\n1 Ch. says mokhisa is from mokhi, moss.

P'hatman said: \"Glory to God, what things have befallen me!\\(^2\\) This day I have heard tidings equal to immortality!\" She brought the sorcerer slave, black as a raven, and said: \"I send thee to Kadjet'hi; go, thou hast a long journey.\n\n1247. \"Now will appear advantage for me from thy witchcraft, speedily quench the furnace of the burning\\(^3\\) of my fires, tell that sun the means for her cure.\" He said: \"To-morrow I shall give you full news of what you wish.\"\n\nXXXVII\n\nLETTER WRITTEN BY P'HATMAN TO NESTAN-DAREDJAN\n\n1248. P'hatman writes: \"O star, heavenly sun of the world, consumer and griever of all them that are afar from thee, elegant and eloquent in words, lovely, fair-tongued, crystal and ruby both welded in one!\n\n1249. \"Though thou gavest me not to hear thy story, I have learnt the truth, thereby hath my heart been comforted.

We wish to know in detail the number of warriors there. Who are thy guards, and who is their chief?\n\n1252. \"Whatever thou knowest concerning that place, write to us, make it known. Then send some token for thy lover. All the sorrow thou hast had hitherto, change (it) into joy!

P'hatman gave the letter to that cunning sorcerer: \"Give this letter to the sunlike maiden!\" The wizard donned a certain green mantle\\(^4\\) over his form; in that very moment he was lost to view, he flew over the roofs.\n\n1254. He went like an arrow shot by a swift-bowed archer. When he reached Kadjet'hi it was just dusk twilight. Invisible he passed the multitude of knights\\(^5\\) guarding the gates.

The sun-faced marvelled at P\u2019hatman\u2019s wonderful news; she split her almonds (opened her eyes), the jets\\(^5\\) (? black pupils) quivered with the rod of jet (her lashes). The slave gave her the letter with his own hand. She sighs, she reads the letter, she wets it with her hot tears.\n\n1258. She asked the slave: \u201cTell me, who is my seeker, or who knows me to be alive, treading the earth?\u201d He said: \u201cI will venture to tell you only what I know.

When this matter so dear to him had been accomplished, Avt'handil with hands upraised thanks God, with full understanding, not as one bemused.\n\n1288. He said to P'hatman: \"The thing desired is timely finished for me; thy great zeal for my sake is (still) unrecompensed. I go, I have no leisure to tarry longer, last year's time is come. Swiftly shall I lead into Kadjet'hi him who will annihilate and destroy them.\"\n\n1289. The lady said: \"O lion, the fire now becomes hotter; (my) heart will be sundered from (thee) its light, thereby will it be darkened; hasten, grieve not for me, the madman will thus become furious. Should the Kadjis arrive before you, going thither will be made difficult for you.\"\n\n1290. The knight called P'hridon's slaves who attended him. He said: \"Corpses hitherto, now indeed are we enlivened; we are renewed by the hearing of what we\n\n---\n\n1 Qorant'ha dasagivari, what ravens fly down upon with a cry, Ch.

I shall show you our enemies wounded and thereby woe-stricken.\n\n1291. \"Go and tell P'hridon this unvarnished story. I cannot see him, I am hurried, my road is one of haste. Let him strengthen his great voice to make it still more bold. I will give you all the treasure taken by me as booty.\n\n1292. \"Great is the debt laid upon me by you; I will show my gratitude in another way when I join P'hridon again. For the nonce, take away all that was reft from the pirates; I can give you no more than this, I know that so I shall seem to you niggardly.\n\n1293. \"I have no home near; I have no power to dispense gifts.\" He gave them a ship full, beautiful things, a host in number. He said: \"Go, take them away, travel the road to that same region. Give this letter from me, his sworn brother, to P'hridon.\"\n\nXL\n\nAVT'HANDIL'S LETTER TO P'HRIDON\n\n1294. He wrote: \"Exalted P'hridon, supremely blest, king of kings, lion-like in stout-heartedness, O sun, recklessly shedding rays, mighty,\\(^1\\) joyous,\\(^2\\) spiller of the blood of foes\u2014thy youngest brother from far, far away barks\\(^3\\) thee a greeting.\n\n1295. \"I have seen troubles, and I have, too, received recompense for what pains I have suffered. Well hath fallen out the matter planned by me: I have truly learned the story of that face likened to a sun, the sustainer of that lion who was buried under the earth.\n\n1296. \"The sovereign of the Kadjis has that sun; she is captive in Kadjet'hi.

From the narcissi a rain of crystal falls; the rose is wet with rain. The Kadjis are not yet with the maid, but countless is their host.\n\n1297. \"Glad in heart I rejoice, for this my tear will not flow in channels.\\(^1\\) Wherever thou and thy brother (Tariel) are the difficult will be made easy; whatever you may desire you will certainly do it, you shall not fail; not only no man can stand against you, I trow that even a rock will soften before you.\\(^2\\)\n\n1298. \"Now pardon me, I cannot see thee, so I have passed\\(^3\\) afar off; I have no leisure to linger on the road, for that moon is captive. Soon shall we come merry; rejoice at the sight of us! What more than this can I say to thee: help thy brother in brotherly fashion?\n\n1299. \"The attachment\\(^4\\) of these slaves is beyond reward; pleasantly have they served me, and your heart, too, will be pleased at this. Why should he be praised who hath sojourned long with you? Every like gives birth to like; this is a saying of the sages.\"\n\n1300. He wrote this letter,\\(^5\\) he tied it up and rolled it\\(^6\\); the rose, the violet-haired, gave it to P'hridon's slaves; he communicated through them by word of mouth all that was needful, how he should do\\(^7\\); the open door of coral showed its pearls to them.\\(^8\\)\n\n1301. Avt'handil searched; he found a ship of that region (where Tariel was). That sun with the face of a full moon prepared to set out; but to leave the woeful-hearted P'hatman was a heaviness to him; those who parted from him shed a rivulet of blood.\n\n1302. P'hatman, Usen and the slaves weep with hot tears. They said: \"O sun, what hast thou done to us?

(i.e., by thy departure).\u201d\n\nXLI\n\nAVT'HANDIL\u2019S DEPARTURE FROM GULANSHARO, AND HIS MEETING WITH TARIEL\n\n1303. Avt'handil has crossed the seas in a certain ship for travellers. He rides glad-hearted all alone. To meet Tariel with such tidings rejoices him. With hands uplifted, with his heart he hopes in God.\n\n1304. Summer was come, from the earth came forth verdure, the token of the rose bursting into bloom, the time of their tryst, the change of course by the sun, the setting out of the cypress-formed. He sighed when he saw the flower long time unseen by him.\n\n1305. The sky thundered and the cloud rained crystal dew; he kissed the rose with his rose-like lips; he said: \u201cI gaze on you with tenderly-observant eye; I rejoice to have converse with you in her (T'hinat'hin\u2019s) stead.\u201d\n\n1306. When he thought on his friend, the bitter tears flowed; he travelled those weary ways towards Tariel, deserted and pathless, unknown regions; lion and panther of the reedy thickets he slew wherever he saw them.\n\n1307. The caves came in sight, he was glad, he recognized them. He said: \u201cThese be the rocks where my friend is, he for whom my tears have flowed. I am indeed worthy to see him face to face, to relate to him what I have heard. If he be not come, what shall I do? Vain will have been my travail.\n\n1308. \u201cIf he be come, doubtless he would not tarry within; he would go somewhere into the plain, like a wild\n\n---\n\n1 Dammarkhveli, guardian, one who buries the dead, 979; or, ? \u201cthy hand which is our guard.\u201d\n2 Mgavrit'ha, of travellers, with a guide, travelling.\n3 Etli, 269, 1175, 1311, 1513.\n4 King Vakhtang says, \u201cit mounts to the Crab.\u201d ? etli, vehicle; Avt'handil had changed his mode of conveyance from ship to horseback.\n5 For descriptions of Nature, 820, 846, 847, 965, 1323, 1386.\nbeast he would roam in the fields; it is better for me to go round by the rushes.\" He bethought himself, he looked about; thus he spoke and turned, he went towards the plains.\n\n1309. He canters along and sings with merry heart; he shouts to him by name with cheerful voice. He went a little farther, there appeared the sun in full splendour, at the edge of the rushes stands Tariel with sharp\\(^1\\) sword.\n\n1310. Tariel had slain a lion; its blood anointed his sword. He stood dismounted at the edge of the rushes; his horse was not with him. He heard Avt'handil's shout, he was astonished; he looked at him, recognized him, started, ran towards him, bounded.\n\n1311. Tariel flung aside his sword and went towards his adopted brother.\\(^2\\) The knight alighted from his horse; it seemed to him that he had attained his goal\\(^3\\) (2). They kissed each other; their necks were as if riveted together.\\(^4\\) There was the sugary\\(^5\\) sound of the rose frequently opening.\n\n1312. Tariel, weeping, uttered polished,\\(^6\\) exquisite\\(^7\\) words\u2014the tear of blood dyed the jety thickets crimson, the fountain of tears, many streams,\\(^8\\) waters\\(^9\\) the aloe\\(^10\\): \"Since I have seen thee, what matters it to me if eight\\(^11\\) pains oppress me?\"\n\n1313. Tariel weeps and Avt'handil was speaking to him laughing, he smiles, he opens his coral (lips), the flash from his teeth quivers; he said: \"I have learned tidings\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Momakhva, to sharpen.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dzmobili, 1349, 1359, 1366.\n\n\\(^3\\) Etti, planet, fate, happiness, wheel, carriage; strob'a, to overtake; stori, equal.

Tariel said: \"O brother, that which rejoices me today is enough, in seeing thee I have seen all my comfort, whatever other balm God gives; hast thou not heard: How can man find in the world that which is not of Heaven's doing!\" (?)\n\n1315. When Tariel was not convinced, Avt'handil was ill at ease, he could no longer delay to tell the tale; he hastened, he drew forth the veil of her on whose lips the rose blooms; when Tariel saw, he recognized it, seized upon it, started.\n\n1316. He recognized the letter and the fringe of the veil and unfolded them, he pressed them to his face; he fell, a rose pale in hue, his spirits fled, the watchman of jet bowed his head. Neither Caen nor even Salaman could bear sorrows like his.\n\n1317. Avt'handil gazes at Tariel lying lifeless; he flew to him, he set about helping him, the sweetly-speaking; he could not be of avail to the consumed one, completely burned up with fire; her tokens had laid hold of his life.\n\n1318. Avt'handil sat down to weep; he mourns with melodious voice, full oft he tears his raven locks, he rouses them by seizing them with his crystal (hand), he brake the ruby polished with a hammer of adamant, thence issue streams which I likened to coral in hue.\n\n1319. He scratches his face; blood flows from his cheeks while gazing at (Tariel). \"What I have done neither madman nor fool hath done. Why did I in my haste pour water on a fire difficult to quench! The heart struck hastily by exceeding joy cannot bear it.\n\n1 Shemovarda (? became like a rose).\n2 Tala, A., guard, watchman; here \"eyelashes.\"\n3 M., xii, xli, xlii; iv., 68, n. l. Abul. (182) reads: \"Not only a man, even if he were Cain, but even a rock (sala, sala), could not endure such suffering as his\"; 1297. As Marr points out, Caen is Caisi\u2014i.e., Majnun, the lover of Leila (cf. Nizami's poem)\u2014and Salaman is the hero of the story of Salman and Absal, subsequently versified by Jami, 1552. Nizami was a native of Transcaucasia and contemporary of Rusthaveli.\n4 M. 5 ? he strikes his face with his fist. 6 ? spurious quatrain.\n1320. \"I have slain my friend! What befits me disgraced? I blame myself for a deed not thought out with heed. A stupid man cannot do well in a difficult matter. It is said: 'Chidden slowness is better than praised haste.'\"\n\n1321. Tariel lay unconscious, as if scorched. Avt'handil rose, he passed through the rushes in search of water; he found the lion's blood, he carries it to quench the flame, he sprinkled it on (Tariel's) breast; the lapis-lazuli became ruby-hued.\n\n1322. Avt'handil sprinkled the breast of that lion (Tariel) with the lion's blood. Tariel started up, the ranks of the race of India moved, he opened his eyes, he received power to sit up; blue seems the ray of the moon diminished in ray by the sun.\n\n1323. Winter makes the roses fade, their leaves fall; the ardour of the summer sun burns them, they bemoan the drought, but upon them nightingales complain with lovely voice; heat consumes, frost freezes; the wounds hurt them in either case.\n\n1324. Even so is it hard to deal with the heart of man; it is mad alike both in grief and in joy; it is always wounded, its fate is never whole. He only can trust this world who is his own foe.\n\n1325. Tariel gazed again on the writing of his slayer; he reads, though the reading of her letter maddens him; his tears blind him to the light, dark seems the beam of day. Avt'handil rose, he began to speak with rough words.\n\n1326. He said: \"Such behaviour is unworthy of an instructed man! Why should we weep now? It behoves us to set about the making of smiles. Arise, let us go in\n\n---\n\n1 Tzru, false.\n2 \"His black eyelashes quivered.\" M., xii. 30, \"the regiment of Indian origin moved.\"\n3 Shuk-nacrt'homi, reflected back; 1135, shuk-nacrt'hali, waning.\n4 ? this and next quatrain spurious.\n5 Mosagvareblad, to contrive, adapt, satisfy, Car.\n6 I.e., there is always something lacking.\n7 Mkisi, 182, 677, 838, 964, 1049.\n8 Nakmari, 446, 833.\nquest of that lost sun.

Then let us mount and set out, let us wend towards Kadjet\u2019hi. Be our swords our guides, let us sheath them in\\footnote{2}{their (the Kadjis\u2019) backs;} untroubled shall we return, we shall reduce them to carrion.\u201d\\footnote{3}{Madzori.}\n\n1328. Then Tariel asks for tidings; he no longer fainted. He looked up, he raised his eyes, the black and white lightning glittered, as a ruby by the sun so was his colour increased.\\footnote{4}{Ch., ezorveboda, from zorva, to sacrifice; Car., ezardeboda; and Abul. (s.v. zard) says this means \u201cwas beautified, adorned.\u201d} Who is worthy that towards him the sky turn ever in mercy?\n\n1329. To Avt\u2019handil he gave thanks; he conversed with him: \u201cHow shall I speak thy praise, worthy to be praised by the wise! Like a spring up\\footnote{5}{Ze; Car., mze, sun (?).} on a mountain thou hast watered the flower of the plain;\\footnote{6}{Bari, A., 275, 397; bari, spade, 1094.} thou hast cut off for me the flow of tears of the pool\\footnote{7}{Nagubari, dammed-up pool.} of the narcissi (the eyes).\n\n1330. \u201cI can never make thee a return; may the God of heaven repay thee! May He in my stead reward thee from His height!\u201d They mounted and went home; they made great rejoicing. Now the world (Fate) will indeed sate Asmat\u2019h so long hungering.\n\n1331. At the door of the cave Asmat\u2019h sits alone, not fully dressed;\\footnote{8}{Bargosani, from bargi, P., baggage, load, goods.} when she had looked she recognized Tariel, and with him a knight on a white horse;\\footnote{9}{Dcharmagi, ? P., cf. d\u2019hel\u2019hr-taidchosani, 72; Abul., \u201cdressed in white.\u201d} both were sweetly singing like songster nightingales. Immediately she recognized them she rose hastily, bare but for her smock.\n\n1332. Hitherto she had ever seen him come to the cave weeping, now she wondered to behold him singing, laughing; seized with fear she arose, her understanding was...\nlike a drunkard's; she heard not yet the news she so longed for.\n\n1333. When they saw her they shouted to her, laughing and showing their teeth: \"Ho! Asmat'h! God's mercy is come down on us from on high; we have found the lost moon; what we desired that have we done; now we shall have our fires quenched by Fate, our sorrows turned to joy.\"\n\n1334. Avt'handil alighted from his horse to embrace Asmat'h; she laid hold of the aloe,\\(^1\\) pliant to the touch was its branch (his arm); she kisses his neck and face; she sheds tears. \"Tell me what thou hast discovered, what thou hast done. Beseeching thee, I weep on the field.\"\n\n1335. Avt'handil gave to Asmat'h the letter of her charge,\\(^2\\) the aloe\\(^1\\) with faded branch, the pale moon. He said: \"See the writing of her who hath passed through troubles; the sun approaches us, it hath given us the putting away of shadow.\"\n\n1336. When Asmat'h saw the letter she knew (Nestan's) hand; she marvelled, fear seized her, she quakes like one possessed, from head to foot overwhelming wonder laid hold on her; she says: \"What have I seen, what do I hear, is it indeed true?\"\\(^3\\)\n\n1337. Avt'handil said: \"Fear not, this story is true, joy is given to us, all sore grief is put away from us, the sun is come nigh us, darkness\\(^4\\) is no longer dark\\(^5\\) for us. Good hath overcome ill; the essence of (good) is lasting.\"\\(^6\\)\n\n1338. The King of the Indians merrily spoke somewhat with Asmat'h; they embraced each other, joy made them weep; the raven's tail (eyelashes) dropped light dew upon the rose (cheeks). God forsaketh not man if man comprehend\\(^7\\) this.\n\n\\(^1\\) Alva, 1312.  \n\\(^2\\) Zrdili.  \n\\(^3\\) Ch. and Car. give simart'hle and sinamdvile, justice and truth, as synonyms for mrtkeloba; in the next quatrain, line 1, mrt'heli is accepted as equivalent to mart'hali.  \n\\(^4\\) Ucuni, Car., the darkness; Ch., eternal darkness, eternity, dark mourning room, darkness.  \n\\(^5\\) Ch., dzneli, hard, for bneli.  \n\\(^6\\) 184, 1411.  \n\\(^7\\) Sheigebda, 1365.\n1339. They gave God great thanks. They said: \"Thou hast done to us what was best; now we recognize that your mouth would not have adjudged to us the worst.\" The King of the Indians, with uplifted hand, joyously shouted this. Merry they went into the caves; Asmat'h made ready somewhat for their refreshment.\n\n1340. Tariel said to Avt'handil: \"Hearken to these words: I will tell thee something, think me not a tedious narrator. Since the time when I captured the caves (and) slew droves of Devis, their precious treasury lies here.\n\n1341. \"Never have I seen it, for I have not wished to do so. Come and let us open it; let us see how much treasure there is.\" It pleased him; both arose, nor did Asmat'h stay seated. They broke down forty doors; it was no great struggle for them.\n\n1342. They found unequalled treasure, hitherto unseen by their eyes. There stood a heap of jewels of fair workmanship. There were seen pearls each as big as a ball for play. Who could make account of the gold not to be numbered by any!\n\n1343. Inside those forty rooms were full. They found an armoury newly made for armour; there all kinds of armour were placed like preserves (in a store cupboard); therein was a coffer, sealed, unopened.\n\n1344. Upon it was written: \"Here lieth wondrous armour: chain helmet, habergeon, steel-cutting sword. If the Kadjis attack the Devis it will be a hard day. Whoever openeth at any other time is a slayer of kings!\"*\n\n1345. They opened the coffer; they found in it three suits of armour fit for three warrior knights to don; coats of mail, swords, helmets, greaves of like sort; they were in emerald nests, as it were shrines.\n\n---\n\n1 Asebi, hundreds; ? some hundred words (!).\n2 Mat'h-gan ar zedan omia.\n3 Riqe, 1394.\n4 Khel-tsmindad ganat'hlisa.\n5 Bur'thi saburt'halisa, 20, 63, 804, 1100.\n6 Zaradkhana; 1240, zardakhana.\n7 Mtsnilii, salted vegetables, jam.\n8 1346.

Each clothed himself with each, they tested them on themselves; chain helmet and habergeon nought could dint; they struck the swords on iron, they cut it like cotton-thread. I tell you they prize them more than all the world; they would not barter them for it.\n\n1347. They said: \"As a sign this is enough for us; we are in good luck. God has gazed on us with His eye, looking down from above.\" They took up that armour, each put it on his neck; they bound up one (set) with leather thongs to present to P'hridon.\n\n1348. They took with them some gold, some rare pearls; they went forth, they sealed up the forty treasuries. Avt'handil said: \"Henceforth will I fasten my palm to the sword; nowhere shall I go to-night, when day dawns I shall not tarry.\"\n\n1349. Now, painter, limn the sworn brothers more steadfast than brothers, these lovers of stars, excelled by none, both heroic knights renowned in bravery. When they go to Kadjet'hi you shall see a battle of piercing lances.\n\nXLII\n\nTARIEL AND AVT'HANDIL GO TO P'HRIDON\n\n1350. When day dawned they set out; they took Asmat'h with them. Till they came to Nuradin's land they mounted her behind them; there a merchant gave them a horse for a price in gold, he made not a gift of it. As guide Avt'handil sufficed; whom else need he take!\n\n1351. They wended their way and met with Nuradin's herdsmen, they saw the herd (of horses); it pleased them, who had come for P'hridon. There said the Hindoo to\n\n---\n\n1 Kedi.  \n2 ? \"harden my palm with . . .;\" nebi, 679, 1380.  \n3 Dzmobilni, 1311.  \n4 Mnat'hobt'ha, of celestial beauties.  \n5 ? spurious quatrain. ? \"you shall see battle, (men) pierced with lances.\"  \n6 Qolaozi, P., 955.  \n7 Djogi.  \n8 Eaget'ha, traditional interpretation of Ch. and T'heimuraz; Car. finds the word unintelligible; Abul. says, eage=tsamosuli, mosuli gardmokhvetsili.  \n9 Indo.\nAvt'handil: \"I will have thee do a good piece of fooling: Come, let us play a joke on P'hridon, let us chase his herd.\n\n1352. \"We will carry off the herd, he will come and hear that the herd is reived; he will prepare to do battle, to dye the plain with gore. Suddenly he will recognize us, he will be surprised, he will calm his heart. Pleasant is good joking; it makes even the proud merry.\"\n\n1353. They began to seize the steeds,\u00b9 P'hridon's finest. There the herdsmen made a torch,\u00b2 they struck steel.\u00b3 They shouted: \"Who are ye, knights, who do such high (-handed) deeds? This herd is his who strikes the foe with his sword without making him to sigh.\"\u2074\n\n1354. They seized their bows, they pursued the herdsmen; the herdsmen shrieked aloud, they raised their voices: \"Help, help! brigands are massacring us!\" They made an outcry, they united, they appealed to P'hridon, they were not bashful.\u2075\n\n1355. P'hridon arrayed himself, he mounted, he rode forth in full array. They made an outcry, they united, the regiment covered the fields. Those suns whom winter could not freeze came forward; they were covered up, helmets hid their faces.\n\n1356. When Tariel knew P'hridon, \"Now have I seen him I want,\" said he; he raised his helm,\u2076 he smiled, he laughed; he said to P'hridon: \"What dost thou wish? Why doth our coming annoy thee? Bad host! Thou meetest us to fight.\"\n\n1357. P'hridon swiftly dismounted; he fell down and saluted. They also alighted, they embraced\u2014ay, kissed him. P'hridon with upraised hand gave God measureless thanks. The magnates also kissed them, whoever knew them.\n\n1358. P'hridon said: \"Why tarried ye? I expected ye sooner. I am ready; I shall not lag\"\u2077 in any service of\n\n\u00b9 Taidchi, 55, 96, 201. \u00b2 Phanos\u00ec, Gr., ? beacon fire.\n\u00b3 Cves\u00ec, 192, 262, 907. \u2074 I.e., he kills outright.\n\u2075 I.e., they went straight to P'hridon. \u2076 Muzaradi, 430. \u2077 Davizare.\nyours!\" It seemed as if two suns and a moon were united there; they beautified one another. They set out, they departed.\n\n1359. At P'hridon's fairly-builted house they both alighted; he sits down beside his sworn brother Avt'handil; Tariel sat on a throne\\(^1\\) covered in cloth of gold.\\(^2\\) To P'hridon, renowned as a hero,\\(^3\\) they presented that armour.\n\n1360. They said: \"At this time we have no other gifts\\(^4\\) for thee, but we have many other fair things lying in a place (we wot of).\" He laid his face to the ground, he wasted not time: \"Such a gift to me is worthy of you.\"\n\n1361. That night they rested as P'hridon's guests; baths he gave them, he gave them gifts of garments in plenty, he clad their beauty in beauty,\\(^5\\) each (garment) fairer than the other; he gave them rare jewels and pearls in a golden basin.\\(^6\\)\n\n1362. He said: \"This (that I am about to say) is the speech of a bad host; 'tis as if hospitality to you wise (ones) wearied me as if you were mad (ones); but tarrying now avails not, it is better to travel the long road; if the Kadjis outstrip us there is a risk\\(^7\\) of trouble.\n\n1363. \"Why should we use great hosts? We want good and few\\(^8\\) three hundred men suffice us, let us go (swift) like runaways\\(^9\\) in Kadjet'hi for fighting the Kadjis we shall put basket-hilts\\(^10\\) on our swords; soon shall we find her whose pleasant aloe form will slay us.\n\n1364. \"Once aforetime I was in Kadjet'hi; you shall see it, and you, too, shall find it strong; on all sides round about is rock, a foe may not come up to it; if we may not go in privily, it is impossible to engage openly; so we need no army, the squadron\\(^11\\) cannot follow us secretly.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Sadjdomi. \\(^2\\) Oksino, 320. \\(^3\\) Dchabuci, 1221.\n\\(^4\\) Armaghani, P., 1211.\n\\(^5\\) Turp'ha turp'hit'ha, ? merely reduplicated adjective, characteristic of Georgian; if so, \"with beautiful (garments).\"\n\\(^6\\) Gobi. \\(^7\\) Saedchvi, doubt.\n\\(^8\\) Cf. 583, \"little, but . . . excellent\"; 594, \"fair, though small.\"\n\\(^9\\) Mar'th mcotani, like routed men running away (i.e., rapidly).\n\\(^10\\) Cota, 594.\n\\(^11\\) Razmi, detachment; 301. For military organization of Georgia, cf. I. Djavakhov, Gosud. stroi., t. i., Pbg. 1905.\n1365. With what he said, they too agreed. They left there the maiden Asmat'h; P'hridon bestows a gift upon her. They took with them three hundred horsemen equal to heroes.\\(^1\\) At the last God will give the victory to all who have been distressed.\\(^2\\)\n\n1366. All three sworn brothers crossed the sea. P'hridon knows the way; going day and night they travel. P'hridon said: \"Now are we coming nigh the regions of Kadjet'hi; henceforth we must travel by night so that we be not discovered.\"\n\n1367. The three behaved according to this advice of P'hridon's; when it was daylight they stopped, and by night they went swiftly on. They arrived; the city appeared; they could not count the guards; outside was a rock, the noise of the sentinels in crowds increased.\n\n1368. At the gate of the passage ten thousand braves\\(^3\\) kept guard. Those lions saw the city; the shining moon\\(^4\\) stood upon it. They said: \"Let us advise what is best, now is choice difficult; a hundred can overcome a thousand if they choose the best way.\"\n\nXLIII\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF P'HRIDON, AVT'HANDIL AND TARIEL AS TO THE ASSAULT ON THE CASTLE OF KADJET'HI\n\n1369. P'hridon said: \"I will speak a word, I think I am not at fault: We are few, the city is only expugnable by many; we have not strength for a direct attack\u2014this is no time for boasting\u2014in a thousand years we could not anywhere win in if they shut the gate against us.\n\n1370. \"In my childhood my tutors instructed me in gymnastics,\\(^5\\) they taught me their tricks, they made me\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gmiri, hero, giant; 333, 1263, 1378, 1426.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. 1337, 1338.\n\n\\(^3\\) Dchabuci, 1221, 1359.\n\n\\(^4\\) Evidently in a literal sense, and not with Nestan as the moon. Cf. the dawn, 1388.\n\n\\(^5\\) Samushait'hi; mushaithi, A., acrobat, 119.\nleap, they trained me, I used to go along a rope so that eyes could not follow me; whatever little boys looked at me they also desired to do it.\\footnote{Inatridian, ? they envied.}\n\n1371. \"Now, whichever of you knows best how to cast a noose,\\footnote{Sagdebeli, lasso.} let us throw the end of a long rope\\footnote{Sabeli.} to that tower;\\footnote{Burdji, ? the four masonry supports or pillars of a building.} it seems as easy for me to cross as a field; I shall make it a trouble to you to find a sound man inside.\\footnote{This is Ch.'s interpretation of line 4.}\n\n1372. \"To me it seems nought to cross in armour, no trouble to bear a shield; nimbly shall I leap down inside, strike like a wind, slay the soldiers; I shall open, you will see the opening of the gate, you too come thither where you hear the uproar of alarm.\"\\footnote{Zriali zarisa, perhaps the ringing of a bell or some other signal of alarm. Zari, P., also means \"bell\" or \"rattle.\"}\n\n1373. Avt'handil said: \"Ha, P'hridon! friends cannot complain of thee; thou hast hope in thy lion-like arms, wounds hurt not thee; thou counsellest hard counsel to make foes lament; but hearest thou not how very near the garrison shouts!\n\n1374. \"When thou goest over, the garrison will hear the clatter\\footnote{221.} of thine armour, they will perceive thee, they will cut the cord,\\footnote{T'hoci, 251.} of this thou must be assured. Everything will turn out ill for thee; only the vain attempt\\footnote{P'hereba, to plume oneself, etc., 13, 30, 160, 765, 1229, 1236; p'heroba, caress, blush, colour, 37. Here perhaps \"the empty appearance, vain show\" (?).} will remain to thee. That counsel is of no value; let us help ourselves in some other way.\n\n1375. \"This is better: you stay hidden in ambush. These men will not lay hands on a traveller coming into the town. I will dress myself as a merchant, I will do a treacherous\\footnote{Mukht'halii, 739.} deed; I will load a mule with helmet, hauberk and sword.\n\n1376. \"It is of no use for the three of us to go in, there is risk that they would perceive it; I shall go alone as a merchant, and well shall I win in unnoticed; secretly shall\nI don mine armour, I shall appear, I shall deceive them. God grant that I may make channels\\(^1\\) of blood to flow generously in there!\n\n1377. \"Without any difficulty I shall remove the guards inside; you strike outside the gate, all like heroes; I shall shatter the locks,\\(^2\\) I shall open, you will see the opening of the gate. If aught else would be better, say so; I am for a plan of this sort.\"\n\n1378. Tariel said: \"I recognize your heroism\\(^3\\) exceeding that of heroes; your counsel and advice is like your own stout-heartedness; I know you desire fierce fight, not a vain brandishing\\(^4\\) of swords, when the battle becomes perilous then are ye men.\\(^5\\)\"\n\n1379. \"But let me too have some choice in the matter. The sound will be heard by her who maddens me; like the sun she will be standing aloft; you will have fierce fight, she will see me as a non-combatant! This will be a slur on me. Nay, speak no flattering words!\"\n\n1380. \"Better than that counsel is this\u2014let us do as I\\(^6\\) say: Let us divide the men by hundreds; when night turns to dawn let the three of us start out from three places, swiftly let us urge on our horses; they will send out to encounter us, we shall seem insignificant to them, we shall lend a powerful palm\\(^7\\) to the sword.\n\n1381. \"Swiftly shall we engage them, we shall get round them; they will not be able to shut the gates against us; one of the three will go in, the others from outside will strike with battering-rams (?);\\(^8\\) that one who is inside will fall on those within, making their blood flow; again let us lay hold of the arms mightily used by us!\"\n\n1382. P'hridon said: \"I understand, I perceive, I know what (it is). None could forestall at the gates that horse that once was mine; when I gave it I knew not that we\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ru, P.\n\n\\(^2\\) Clite, Gr. kleis, 1556.\n\n\\(^3\\) Gmiroba; gmiri, 1365.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ghiroba for ghereba.\n\n\\(^5\\) ? \"then indeed should a man be with ye.\"\n\n\\(^6\\) Ch., chveni; Car., chemi.\n\n\\(^7\\) Nebi, palm of the hand, 1848.\n\n\\(^8\\) Garebsa, from gari, external, is Ch.'s reading: \"strike those who are outside,\" Car. reads barebsa, with a battering-ram.\nshould want to mount guard over\\(^1\\) the Kadjis in Kadjet'hi; if so, I tell thee I would by no means have given it to thee, such is mine avarice!\"\n\n1383. P'hridon the gay\\(^2\\) jests with such discourse as this; thereupon they, the eloquent, wise-worded ones, laugh, they joke one with another, with merriment beseeming them. They dismounted and arrayed themselves; they mounted their excellent steeds.\n\n1384. Again they interchanged words, not tart\\(^3\\) to the mouth. They resolved on that plan proposed by Taria. They divided among them by hundreds the men, all equal to heroes. They mounted their horses; their helmets\\(^4\\) they raised.\n\n1385. I saw those heroes\\(^5\\) shining with rays excelling the sun; those three are covered by the seven planets\\(^6\\) with a column of light. Tariel with slender\\(^7\\) form sits on the black (horse); they consumed their foes in fight as their admirers by gazing.\\(^8\\)\n\n1386. Now, this is what I shall say is their image and likeness: When clouds rain down, and the stream pours from the mountains, it comes and glides through the glens, turmoil and uproar is heard; but when it unites with the sea then is it even so calm.\n\n1387. Though P'hridon and Avt'handil are unrivalled in valour,\\(^9\\) yet to engage with Taria is to be desired of none; the sun hides even the planets, nor do the Pleiads\\(^10\\) shine. Now give heed, O listener; thou shalt hear of fierce fights.\n\n1388. The three split up into three, one for each gate; with them they had three hundred men all equal to heroes. That night they hastily made a reconnaissance,\\(^11\\) not illusory.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mzera.\n\n\\(^2\\) Laghi, ? proud; but cf. line 3.\n\n\\(^3\\) Mcvakhe, unripe, 204.\n\n\\(^4\\) Chabalakhi, 597.\n\n\\(^5\\) Dchabuci, ? knight; 1221, 1368.\n\n\\(^6\\) Mnat'hobni, seven including sun and moon; 944, 1515.\n\n\\(^7\\) Tsertseti.\n\n\\(^8\\) There are four internal rhymes; ? this and the next two quatrains spurious.\n\n\\(^9\\) Sicet'he.\n\n\\(^10\\) Khomlni; khomi, kholmli, lustre, chandelier; 1117.\n\n\\(^11\\) Sadarno.\nDay dawned, they appeared, they set forth, they each had his shield.\\footnote{P'harebi; p'hara, flock (of sheep, etc.); p'hari, shield.}\n\n1389. First they went quietly in the guise of some travellers; those inside could not perceive, they could not meet them alertly, they had no fear in their hearts, quietly they stood at ease. They approached\\footnote{Midges (?)}; for the time being they covered over their helmets.\n\n1390. Suddenly they spurred their horses, their whips swished. When they saw, they opened the gates, a tumult came forth from the city. The three set out in three different directions, thus risking their lives (?).\\footnote{Riali, mischance; an obscure phrase.} They played\\footnote{Icres, struck.} on fifes\\footnote{Noba, A., cry of joy; 405, 850, 1170.} and drums;\\footnote{Dabdabi, 703, 1436.} they made the trumpets\\footnote{Buci, 46, 405.} sound shrill.\\footnote{Tertziali, crackling (of fire), crash.}\n\n1391. Then the measureless wrath of God struck Kadjet\u2019hi. Cronos,\\footnote{Chronos, Saturn.} looking down in anger, removed the sweetness of the sun; to them (the Kadjis) also in wrath turned round the wheel\\footnote{Borbali, wheel, whirlwind, a kind of arrow; 1285.} and circle\\footnote{Simrgole, simrgule.} of heaven. The fields could not contain the corpses; the army of the dead was increasing.\n\n1392. The sound of Tariel\u2019s mighty\\footnote{Khap\u2019hi, powerful, terrible, wrathful; 281, 426, 637, 1291.} voice made men unwounded faint, he rent the armour, the strength of the chain-mail\\footnote{Djavshan-kap\u2019hi; djavshan, P., shirt of mail, 426; kap\u2019hi, P., shoulder-piece, 998.} was brought to nought; they attacked the gates on three sides, they found no difficulty in cutting them down\\footnote{Cap\u2019ha, cutting down.}; when they entered the city they began swiftly to destroy the castle.\n\n1393. Avt\u2019handil and the lion P\u2019hridon met inside, they had wholly destroyed the enemy, whose blood flowed in streams; they shouted and saw each other, they rejoiced\ngreatly; they said: \"How goeth it with Tariel?\" Their eyes roved round seeking him.\n\n1394. None of them knew; they could hear nought of Tariel. They wended to the castle gate, no care had they for the foe; there they saw a bank\\(^1\\) of armour, shattered chips of sword-blades, the ten thousand guards\\(^2\\) lifeless, like dust.\n\n1395. All the castle guard lay like sick men, every one wounded from head to foot, their armour rent in pieces, the castle gates open, the fragments of the gates flung aside.\\(^3\\) They recognized Tariel's handiwork, they said: \"This is his doing.\"\\(^4\\)\n\n1396. They found the roads prepared, they entered and crept up the passage\\(^5\\); they saw: the moon was freed from the serpent to meet the sun\\(^6\\); he raised his helmet, his reedy\\(^7\\) hair thrown back\\(^8\\) became him (well), breast was glued to breast, neck was riveted to neck.\n\n1397. They (Nestan and Tariel) embraced each other, they kissed and shed tears; they were like when Musht'har and Zual are united.\\(^9\\) When the sun surrounds\\(^10\\) the rose they become fair and reflect the rays. They that have hitherto seen griefs will henceforth rejoice.\n\n1398. They kissed each other, they stood neck-welded; again full oft they glued the roses of the opened lips. Now those also (Avt'handil and P'hridon) came forth, the three sworn brothers were gathered together; they gave greeting to that sun, they presented themselves as they were called on.\n\n1399. The sun (Nestan) met them with lovely, laughing face, the proud one kissed her helpers with gentle mien, she humbly gave them thanks with dainty words; both together talked with fair discourse.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Riqe, 1342.\n\n\\(^2\\) Nobat'hi, P., 908, 1277.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sreuli, ? flung down, aside; 322.\n\n\\(^4\\) Miseuli, 325.\n\n\\(^5\\) Khvreli, den, cave, cleft, hole, boring, place hollowed out; 1220.\n\n\\(^6\\) I.e., Nestan was at liberty and united to Tariel\u2014allusion to eclipse of the moon; 1208.\n\n\\(^7\\) Leli, reeds, sedge, tender straight hair.\n\n\\(^8\\) Acvra, to do up the hair.\n\n\\(^9\\) Jupiter and Saturn, 938, 939.\n\n\\(^10\\) Shemodgoma, to surround, invest.\n1400. They greeted Tariel too, that tree like an aloe sapling, they wished him joy of the victory, they asked news of one another; it irked them not, they regretted not, for their armour had not failed them\\(^1\\); they themselves had quit themselves as lions, those that fought against them had been as hinds and goats.\n\n1401. Out of the three hundred men, a hundred and sixty came in\\(^2\\) with them; it grieves P\u2019hridon for his troops, but on the other hand he rejoiced; they sought out and suffered not to live whatever adversaries were left.\\(^3\\) What treasures they found, now how can their number be told!\n\n1402. They collected mules, camels, whatever they could find that was swift,\\(^4\\) they loaded three thousand with pearls and gems, every gem cut, jacinths and rubies; they placed that sun in a palanquin,\\(^5\\) precautions are taken by them.\n\n1403. They appointed sixty men to guard the castle of Kadjet\u2019hi. They led away that sun\u2014hard would it be to ravish her from them\u2014they set out for the City of the Seas, though long is the way thither. They said: \u201cWe must see P\u2019hatman; we owe her a due recompense.\u201d\\(^6\\)\n\nXLIV\n\nTHE GOING OF TARIEL TO THE KING OF THE SEAS AND TO P\u2019HRIDON\u2019S\n\n1404. To the presence of the King of the Seas he sent a messenger (of good tidings); he bade him announce: \u201cI, Tariel, come, vanquisher of foes, their destroyer and slayer;\\(^7\\) from Kadjet\u2019hi I bring my sun, piercer of me with arrows; I desire to see thee with honour, as father and parent.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gait\u2019hhhes, ?\n\\(^2\\) Shehqoloda, ? came home, survived.\n\\(^3\\) Cf. 1028; quarter was given to the pirates and they were enslaved.\n\\(^4\\) Mali also means (A.) levy in money, poll-tax; shovel; front of a building.\n\\(^5\\) Cubo, either a litter carried by hand or a tented seat (howdah) on a camel; 365, 1426.\n\\(^6\\) Mukap\u2019ha, A., 1167.\n\\(^7\\) Mosrva and m(o)spoba both have the sense of extermination.\n1405. \"Now I have the land of the Kadjis and their hoards.\\(^1\\) O king, all that is good hath happened to me from you: my sun was freed by P'hatman, she was a mother and a sister to her. What can I give thee in return for this? I hate vain promises.\n\n1406. \"Come, see us before we have passed thy land. I present to thee outright the kingdom of the Kadjis, accept it from me; let thy men be posted there, hold the castle strongly. I am in haste, I cannot come to see thee, come thou forth, wend towards me.\n\n1407. \"On my behalf tell Usen, P'hatman's husband, to send her, the sight of her will please her she freed; whom else can she desire to see more than her who is brighter than the sun, even as crystal is brighter than pitch?\"\\(^2\\)\n\n1408. When Tariel's man was received by the ruler of the seas\u2014it is the custom that the heart is agitated by startling tidings\u2014he gave thanks and glory to God the Just Judge. Straightway he mounted; he needed no other messenger (or invitation).\n\n1409. He loaded baggage, he appointed the making of their wedding, he takes a number of pretty things, not a great quantity of jet.\\(^3\\) He has P'hatman with him, they made a journey of ten days; the sight of the lion and the sun, the light of the lands, rejoices him.\n\n1410. Afar off the three met the great King of the Seas, they dismounted, he humbly kissed them, they were encompassed by a host of troops; they rendered praise to Tariel, he gave a thousand thanks, when they saw the damsel he (the King of the Seas) was fascinated by her crystal-halo rays.\\(^4\\)\n\n1411. Slow fire consumed Dame P'hatman at the sight of her, she embraced her, she covered with kisses her hand, foot, face, neck; she said: \"O God, I will serve Thee, since\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Danadebi, Car., wealth, riches; ? revenues; 1414.\n\n\\(^2\\) Phisa, Gr., 609.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ar, ? for ars, there is; jet would probably be a product of the sea realm, and of small value compared with the \"pretty things.\"\n\n\\(^4\\) M., \"(and how Tariel admired the rays, etc.)\" Bacmi, 226. The Sea-King had already seen Nestan (1157).\nmy darkness is lightened for me; I recognize the shortness of evil, Thy goodness is everlasting.\"\u00b9\n\n1412. The maiden embraced P'hatman; sweetly she speaks, not angry: \"God hath enlightened my rent, faded heart; now am I as full as formerly I was waning; the sun hath shed his beams upon me, therefore I appear a rose unfrozen.\"\n\n1413. The King of the Seas celebrated there an exceeding great wedding;\u00b2 he thanked (Tariel) too for Kadjet'hi; he would not let them go for seven days; generously he dispensed gifts, the treasure he had loaded; they wore out (by treading) upon (it) the scattered gold coin\u00b3 as if it were a bridge.\n\n1414. There stood a heap of silk, brocade and satin. He gave to Tariel a crown, a price could not be set\u2074 on it, of a whole jacinth, yellow, exceeding pure,\u2075 likewise a throne of gold, red, refined.\u2076\n\n1415. He presented to Nestan-Daredjan a mantle\u2077 adorned\u2078 with gems, red jacinths, rubies of Badakhshan and rubies;\u2079 they both sat, the maid and the youth,\u00b9\u2070 with faces flashing lightning; they that looked on them burned with new fire.\n\n1416. He presented to Avt'handil and P'hridon measureless great gifts, a valuable saddle, an excellent horse,\u00b9\u00b9 to each a jewelled coat\u00b9\u00b2 shedding\u00b9\u00b3 rare-hued rays; they said:\n\n\u00b9 Grdzeli for grdzeloba; cf. 1337.\n\u00b2 A first wedding, followed by another at P'hridon's (Chap. XLV.).\n\u00b3 Perpera. All the authorities say this is P., and means gold coin; gold brocade spread (on the ground).\n\u2074 Danadebi, 1405.\n\u2075 Khasi, A.; Ch., pure, etc.; in this passage, ? \"fit for a king.\" Cf. 44, 163, 174, 326, 456, 1183, \"of the court.\"\n\u2076 Khalasi, A.; Abul., pure, unalloyed, or pure red; for \"red\" as synonym of gold, 723.\n\u2077 Qabacha, P., short cloak; 445, 489.\n\u2078 Shemcuti, ? for shemcobili.\n\u2079 Badakhshitha da lalit'ha, 3, 5, 137, 138, 204, 318, 1528.\n\u00b9\u2070 Kal-qmani. In Georgian the woman is usually mentioned first\u2014e.g., tsol-kmari, wife and husband; da-dzma, sister and brother; dedmama, mother and father.\n\u00b9\u00b9 Thvi'th=indef. art., \"a, an.\"\n\u00b9\u00b2 Caba.\n\u00b9\u00b3 Mp'heni. Cf. M., iv., Ode 100, 4, 1, shuk'tha mp'henebo.\n\u201cWhat thanks can we utter! Prosperous be your state!\u201d\u00b9\n\n1417. Tariel rendered thanks with his tongue in fair words: \u201cGreatly have I been pleased, O king; first at seeing you, then you have filled us with many fair kinds of gifts; I wot we did well not to pass by\u00b2 afar off from you.\u201d\n\n1418. The King of the Seas says: \u201cO king, lion, valorous,\u00b3 life of those near you,\u2074 slayer from afar of those that cannot look on you, what can I give you like unto yourself, O fair to look upon! When I am away from you what shall avail me, O desirable to be gazed on!\u201d\n\n1419. Tariel said to P\u2019hatman: \u201cI adopt thee as my sister. O sister, great is mine unpayable debt to thy heart! Now whatever treasure of the Kadjis I have brought\u2075 with me from Kadjet\u2019hi I give it to thee, take it, I sell it not.\u201d\n\n1420. Dame P\u2019hatman made obeisance, she proffered exceeding great thanks: \u201cO king, parting\u2076 from thee burns me with unquenchable fire. When I shall be away from thee what shall I do! Thou wilt leave me like one bereft of sense. Ah, blessed are those near thee; woe to him that cannot gaze on you.\u201d\n\n1421. The two radiant ones spoke to the King of the Seas; their teeth were crystals, their lips as pearl-shells.\u2077 \u201cWhen we are deprived of you we desire not merrymakings,\u2078 harps and kettledrums.\u2079 But give us leave, it is time, let us depart, we are in haste.\n\n1422. \u201cBe our father, parent and hope! But this indeed we beseech of thee: grant us a ship!\u201d The king said: \u201cI grudge not to give myself as earth for you (to\n\n\u00b9 Davla (dovlat\u2019hi), A., P., happiness, wealth; davla also \u201cto go about.\u201d Cf. 777, 1043; also cf.

Go! Thine arm be thy guide!\"\u00b9\n\n1423. The king fitted out a ship on the shore. Tariel set out; those who were parted shed tears, they beat their heads, they tore their hair and beards (and) cast them away.\u00b2 P'hatman's tears in their flow even augmented the sea.\u00b3\n\n1424. The three sworn brothers crossed the seas together;\u2074 again they confirmed by their word what they formerly affirmed; singing and laughter were beseeming to them, who were not ignorant thereof; the ray from their lips shone upon the planks of crystal (their teeth).\u2075\n\n1425. Thence they sent a man to Asmat'h as a messenger of good tidings; also to the households of\u2076 P'hridon's chiefs who had been in the fight, to announce to them: \"He\u2077 comes hither, as the sun he\u2077 rises high, reinforcing\u2078 (?) the planets; we erstwhile frozen shall be frozen now no more.\"\n\n1426. They seated that sun (Nestan) in a palanquin; they wended their way along the coast. They sported like children; the passing away of woe gladdened them. They came where was the land of the hero\u2079 Nuradin, they were met, they heard the sound of frequent song.\n\n1427. There all P'hridon's magnates met them. Asmat'h, full of joy, whose wounds no longer appeared, was riveted to Nestan-Daredjan so that axes could not unloose them. Now she had ended all her faithful services.\n\n1428. Nestan-Daredjan embraces her, kisses her face with her mouth. She said: \"Mine own, woe is me, I have filled thee too with grief. Now God hath granted us grace,\n\n\u00b9 Ch. rhymes in a, Car. in o.\n\u00b2 Cf. 594, 806; cf.

Asmat\u2019h said: \u201cThanks be to God, I have seen the roses unfrozen. At length understanding hath thus revealed things hidden. Death itself seems to me life when I see you happy. Better than all friends are suzerain and vassals that love one another!\u201d\\(^3\\)\n\n1430. The magnates did homage, they rendered great praise:\\(^4\\) \u201cSince God hath caused us to rejoice, blessed is His divinity;\\(^5\\) He hath shown us your face, no longer doth the burning of fires consume us; even He that gave the wound,\\(^6\\) He hath the power to heal it.\u201d\n\n1431. They came and put their mouths on their hands; thus they kissed them.\\(^7\\) The king (Tariel) said: \u201cFor our sake have your brethren sacrificed themselves. They have found joy in eternity a reality and no dream.\\(^8\\) They have attained\\(^9\\) communion\\(^10\\) with the One; their glories are increased an hundred and twenty fold.\\(^11\\)\n\n1432. \u201cThough their death is sore to me and grievous, yet the great immortal gift hath there fallen to their lot.\u201d\\(^12\\) This he spake, gently he wept, and the rain (of tears) was mingled with the snow (of his cheeks).

Death for your sake is far better than walking upon the earth!\" Then P'hridon said to the king: \"Make not bitterness to thyself from aught. May God in return render to thee a thousand joys!\"\n\n1435. Avt'handil also sympathized; he speaks with great sorrow. They rendered praise, and said: \"Let us now yield ourselves to smiling; since the lost lion has found the vanished sun, no more will we weep what is deplorable, no longer will we set canals in our eyes.\"\n\n1436. Thither they went where is the great city Mulghazanzar. They played trumpet and kettledrum, there was trampling and uproar; the sound of drum and copper drum blended fairly; the burgesses crowded round, they left the bazaar.\n\n1437. The merchants came from their rows, on all sides there is a host of onlookers; the officers kept a wide space round them, they had arms in their hands; families came crowding in, causing trouble to the officers; their entreaty is to be allowed there to look upon them.\n\n1438. At P'hridon's they alighted, they saw a pleasing palace, many slaves with golden girdles met them, they have nought but gold brocade as a carpet for their feet; they threw up gold above their heads, the crowd marching there picked it up in heaps.\n\n1 to the dead or to their kinsfolk; keba, 1430.\n2 Satireli, 195.\n3 Mili, 284, 1528.\n4 583.\n5 Buci, 46, 1017.\n6 Tablaci, 435, 1156, 1484.\n7 Zat'khi, 957, 1157.\n8 Dabdabi, 703.\n9 Kosi, P., 703.\n10 Shuca, A., street in a bazaar, souk, 463.\n11 Sarangi, P., guardian of order, police; 1157.\n12 Shors uarebdes; uareba, to refuse, deny, repel; aor. of reba.\n13 Djalabi, P., household (women, children and servants); 101, 714\n14 Damsadjari, 596.\n15 Mosatsonebi in pl., sra sing., but may have plural signification; if not, \"the praiseworthy (or pleasing) ones saw a palace.\"\n16 Oksino, 320, 1359.\n17 Djari in Rust'haveli means \"multitude, host,\" not necessarily \"army, troops,\" unless qualified\u2014e.g., by spa.\nXLV\n\nTHE WEDDING OF TARIEL AND NESTAN BY P'HRIDON\n\n1439. He placed for the maid and the youth a throne white and coral-hued, prettily sprinkled with red and yellow gems; for Avt'handil one of mingled yellow and black; they came, they sat down. The spectators, I ween, were impatient\\(^1\\) for them.\n\n1440. The minstrels came forth; the sound of sweet singing was heard. They made the wedding; the presentation of soft silk stuffs was multiplied by P'hridon, the good entertainer, not an abashed host. A smile, a tooth-glimpse, beautifies Nestan-Daredjan.\n\n1441. They brought out incomparable gifts from the wealthy\\(^2\\) P'hridon: nine\\(^3\\) pearls in size like a goose's egg; also one gem like to the sun with augmented ray; before it at night a painter could have painted a picture.\\(^4\\)\n\n1442. Likewise he presented to each a necklace\\(^5\\) to throw over the neck, of gems cut into spheres, of whole jacinths. He also brought a tray\\(^6\\) scarcely to be held in the hand, a gift for the lion Avt'handil from the generous P'hridon.\n\n1443. That tray is full of plump pearls; he gave all to Avt'handil, with not unseemly words. The house was filled with brocade and soft cloth of gold; Tariel the proud gave thanks with sweet words.\n\n1444. For eight days P'hridon made measureless wedding festivities, every day they offer priceless presents prepared; day and night lute\\(^7\\) and harp ceased not to sound. Behold a youth\\(^8\\) and a maiden worthy each of other have attained each other.\n\n1445. Tariel one day spake to P'hridon words of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sul-daleuli, impatient, exhausted in soul, amazed, intimidated.\n\n\\(^2\\) Alkati, poor, worthless, insignificant; 247.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. 1022, 1167.\n\n\\(^4\\) Khati, A., P., icon, picture; cf. 1349; \\(^2\\) interpolated quatrains.\n\n\\(^5\\) P'harghuli.\n\n\\(^6\\) Tabaci, A., P.\n\n\\(^7\\) Chaghana, 101, 704.\n\n\\(^8\\) Qma, 63, 492.\nheart: \"Your heart is more mine than that of a complete (i.e., born) brother\\(^1\\); my life would not be a fitting return, nor the gift of my soul; dying I found from you the balm for my wound.\n\n1446. \"Thou knowest of Avt'handil's self-sacrifice for my sake; now I would serve him in return; go, ask, he will reveal what he wants; as he hath quenched my furnace, even so hath his burned enough.\n\n1447. \"Say to him: 'O brother, what will repay thee for the grief thou hast seen for my sake? God will grant thee His grace imaged forth\\(^2\\) from on high. If I cannot do something desirable for thee, contrived for thy sake, I will not see my house, nor hall, nor hut.\\(^3\\)\n\n1448. \"'Now tell me what thou wishest of me, or in what I can help thee. I choose that we go to Arabia; be thou my guide.\\(^4\\) Let us bring to reason the sweet with words, the warlike with swords. If thou be not united to thy wife I will be no husband to mine.'\"\n\n1449. When P'hridon told Avt'handil Taria's message, he laughed, he smiled, mirth beautified him. He said: \"Why want I a helper? I am not hurt by a wound from any. The Kadjis possess not my sun, nor doth lack of joy afflict her.\n\n1450. \"My sun sits upon a throne, powerful by the will of God, respected and honoured, proud, harmed by none, she is by no means oppressed by Kadjis, nor by the sorcery of wizards. Why should I want help with regard to her? Expect me not to speak flattering words.\\(^5\\)\n\n1451. \"When Providence shall come for me, heavenly beings from above, (if) God wills, shall visit my heart, consolations for the furnace; then indeed the radiances of the flashing of the sun will be my lot (when I am) dying; till that time be come, vain are my runnings to and fro.\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) M.\n\\(^2\\) Shesakhuli, from shesakhva.\n\\(^3\\) Khuli, 659; ? synonym of kokhi (1238), penthouse, hut with eaves.\n\\(^4\\) Marebi, guide or travelling companion.\n\\(^5\\) 683, 1455.\n\\(^6\\) Cf. M. This quatrain is not clear. For the sun in Rust'haveli's ideas of the other world, cf. 1281.\n1452. \"Go and report to Tariel the answer spoken by me: 'What thanks are needed, O king, however great is thy compassion; even from my mother's womb am I born to be your servant,\\(^1\\) and, by God, let me be but earth till thou be recognized as king.'\n\n1453. \"Thou hast said: 'I desire thy union to thy beloved!' This is like your compassionate heart. There my sword cuts not,\\(^2\\) nor breadth of tongue. It is better for me to await the deed of yon celestial Providence.\n\n1454. \"This is my wish and my desire, that I may see thee powerful in India, enthroned upon the thrones, the heavenly light (Nestan), too, sitting by thy side, the face flashing lightning; that your foes be exterminated, that no adversary appear there.\n\n1455. \"When these the desires of my heart have been fulfilled to me, then indeed shall I go to Arabia, it will befall me to be near that sun; when she wills she shall quench the burnings of this fire for me. Nought else do I wish from you; I hate all kinds of flattery.\"\\(^3\\)\n\n1456. When P'hridon reported to Tariel these words of the knight, he said: \"That will I not do; for that it needs no wizard.\\(^4\\) As he found the cause of the existence of my life (Nestan), even so he too shall see the valour of a brother (used) in his favour.\n\n1457. \"Go, speak on my behalf words not of adulation: 'I will not remain without seeing thy foster-father. I suspect I slew many servants beloved by him. I will only beg forgiveness, and so I shall return.'\n\n1458. \"Speak thus: 'Send me no more messages. Tomorrow I shall not fail to set out; I shall have no more of the word \"if\"; the King of the Arabs will not make my words to be of no avail; pleasantly shall I beg his daughter, I shall entreat of him, I shall persuade him.\"\n\n1459. P'hridon told Avt'handil Taria's message: \"He\n\n\\(^1\\) 1146.\n\\(^2\\) I.e., \"I cannot take arms against my lawful sovereign\"; answer to line 3 of 1448.\n\\(^3\\) 1450, 1457, 1542.\n\\(^4\\) Misani, prophet, fortune-teller; \"you may be sure I shall not do this.\"\nwill not stay,\u201d quoth he; \u201dvain is it for thee to speak of waiting!\u201d It oppressed him; again the smoke and glow burned his heart. Thus respect is due to kings, devotion from knights.\\(^1\\)\n\n1460. Avt\u2019handil went to beseech Taria on bended knee; he embraces his feet, he kisses them, he no longer looks up to his waist. He says: \u201cWhat I have sinned against Rosten this year is enough; make me not again to be a breaker, a shatterer of loyalty.\\(^2\\)\n\n1461. \u201cWhat thou desirest God\u2019s justice will not give thee. How can I dare do a treacherous deed to my foster-father, how can I undertake aught against him who for my sake is become pale, how can the servant use his sword upon his master!\\(^3\\)\n\n1462. \u201cSuch a deed will make discord between me and my beloved. Woe is me if she become angry, displeased, if wrath\\(^4\\) compel her heart! (Then) will she even stint me of tidings, and make me languish for a sight of her. No man of flesh can exact forgiveness for me.\u201d\n\n1463. Tariel, that radiant sun, spake laughing. He took Avt\u2019handil\u2019s hand, raised him, set him on his feet: \u201cThy help hath done me every good, but it is better that thou also shouldst rejoice my joy with thine.\\(^5\\)\n\n1464. \u201cI greatly hate too much fear, respect and ceremony in a friend, I hate unbroken\\(^6\\) sternness, gloominess, majesty; if one be a hearty friend let him tend towards me;\\(^7\\) if not, I for myself, he for himself, separation is much better.\n\n1465. \u201cI know the heart of thy beloved with regard to thee; the visit of me who have met thee will not displease her. Now I can venture to speak somewhat plausibly\\(^8\\) to the king: I only desire to see the desirable sight of them.\n\n---\n\n1 293, 836, 837, 974, 1150, 1452, 1461; also Holldack, op. cit.\n2 Er\u2019t\u2019hguloba, lit., \u201cone-heartedness.\u201d\n3 1459.\n4 Cush\u2019ti, 10, 206; cf. kush\u2019ti, 10, 794, 1506.\n5 I.e., \u201caugment my joy by the sight of thine.\u201d\n6 Gaut\u2019svetlad, uninterruptedly.\n7 \u201cLet him make monazidoba towards me\u201d; Car., monazidoba, attraction; Ch., nazidi, brought; zidva, to draw.\n8 Dchreli, variegated, 121, 161; Car. gives as equivalent tquili.\n1466. \"This only will I say to him entreatingly and respectfully: that he should give thee his daughter of his free will.\\(^1\\) Since the end is union, how can you endure separation? Beautify each other; fade not apart.\"\n\n1467. When Avt'handil knew from Taria that he would not be hindered from going, he ventured not to dispute, he added thereto assent.\\(^2\\) P'hridon counted over select men as a convoy; he set out with them, of course he travelled the road with them.\n\nXLVI\n\nTARIEL GOES AGAIN TO THE CAVE AND SEES THE TREASURE\n\n1468. This hidden thing Divnos\\(^3\\) the sage reveals: \"God sends good, He creates no evil, He shortens the bad to a moment, He renews (? repeats) the good continuously (? for a long time), His perfect self He makes more perfect, He degrades not Himself.\"\\(^4\\)\n\n1469. Those lions, those suns, set out from P'hridon's (country). They lead with them the sun-faced, the maiden, the amazing\\(^5\\) to beholders; the raven's tail (of her hair), ordered, hangs coiled by the crystal (of her brow or cheek); beauty,\\(^6\\) tenderness, there adorned the (fine) ruby.\\(^7\\)\n\n1470. That sun sat in a palanquin, and thus they made her fare. They followed the chase; there caused they blood to flow. Wherever they came upon a land they were\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mogonebit'ha.\n\n\\(^2\\) Saubarisa zedan.\n\n\\(^3\\) Dionysius the Areopagite (cf. also 176) is referred to in M., iv., Odes 1, 2; 3, 17. From this point to the end there are evidently many corruptions and interpolations.\n\n\\(^4\\) Thavsa missa ucet'hessa uzado hqop'hs might mean: \"He makes the pure better for Himself,\" or \"unto Himself\"; uzado has the sense of Lat. integer. The passage is obscure. For zadi, cf. 116. For shortness of evil, 1337, 1411, 1485; cf.

It was as if the sun sat in the firmament\\(^1\\) amid moons. Many days they journeyed, merry,\\(^2\\) sagely discoursing, within those great plains on all sides unattained\\(^3\\) of men. They reached the neighbourhood of that rock where Tariel had been.\n\n1472. Tariel said: \u201cIt is seemly that I should be your host this day. Thither will I go where I was while madness afflicted me. There will Asmat\u2019h entertain us; she hath (store of) smoked meat.\\(^4\\) When I give you fair gifts you shall praise the variety of the treasure.\u201d\\(^5\\)\n\n1473. They went in; they dismounted in that cave of the great rocks. Asmat\u2019h had venison; she carves it for the guests. They were merry, they joked at the passing of those deeds;\\(^6\\) they thanked God that He had turned their days of woe to joy.\n\n1474. They explored the hollow hill,\\(^7\\) merry they played; they found those treasures sealed up by Taria, uncounted by any, apprehended by none; they say not with dissatisfied hearts: \u201cWe lack!\u201d\n\n1475. He gave many fair gifts, to each what was fitting; then he enriched P\u2019hridon\u2019s people, army and generals alike; every man was enriched, (all) those who came with them,\\(^8\\) but there lay so much treasure it seemed still untouched by man.\n\n1476. He said to P\u2019hridon: \u201cHard will it be for me to pay the debt I owe thee; but it is said: \u2018A man who is a doer of good loseth not in the end.\u2019\\(^9\\) Now the treasure, as much as lieth here or is to be found, let it all be thine, take it a\u2019way, as it belongs to thee.\u201d\\(^10\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Samgaro, 1.  \n\\(^2\\) Laghi, proud.  \n\\(^3\\) Miumtsvdari.  \n\\(^4\\) Khmeloba, dryness.

P'hridon humbly did homage, he expressed exceeding gratitude: \"O king, why thinkest thou me stupid and thus mazed? Every enemy seems to thee as straw, however much he may be like a thick cudgel.\\(^1\\) My joy lasts but so long as I shall be a gazer on thee.\"\n\n1478. P'hridon made men go back to bring camels to take away all this treasure to his home. Now they set out thence on the road leading to Arabia. Avt'handil is a minished\\(^2\\) moon (by longing) to be united with the sun (T'hinat'hin).\n\n1479. When many days\\(^3\\) were passed they reached the boundaries of Arabia; they saw villages, castles, frequent, uninterrupted; those dwelling therein had clothed their forms in blue and green,\\(^4\\) all are bathed in tears for Avt'handil.\n\n1480. Tariel sent a man to the presence of King Rosten to say: \"I venture, O king, to approach thee full of desire; I, King of the Indians, come to your royal court; I will show thee the rosebud, unfaded, unplucked.\n\n1481. \"Formerly my sight of thy ground made you angry; thou didst ill in attempting to capture me, to urge thy horse against me; I showed thine armies some sign of anger, I massacred many slaves, servants of your palace.\n\n1482. \"Now therefore I come before you, I have gone out of my way; you will pardon me that in which I sinned against thee, let thy wrath be sufficient. We have no offerings, as P'hridon and his knights can testify; the only gift I have brought you is your Avt'handil.\"\n\n1483. Tongue cannot shortly tell how they rejoiced when the messenger of these good tidings came to the king; the brilliancy of three rays\\(^5\\) was added to T'hinat'hin's cheeks, the shadow of eyebrows and lashes makes fairer the crystal and ruby.\n\n1484. They beat the kettledrums and peals of joyous\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \"However sturdy, he is to thee as nothing\"; ceti, club, mace (1020).\n\\(^2\\) Galeuli, exhausted, reduced to the lowest degree of brightness.\n\\(^3\\) Khanebi, times; or, \"when they had gone a long time.\"\n\\(^4\\) ? mourning colours; 1181.\n\\(^5\\) ? A threefold brilliancy.\nlaughter were heard, the soldiers ran hither and thither, they desired to run to meet them, they began to lead out the horses and to bring out saddles, a multitude of knights, swift-armed, stout-hearted, mounted.\n\n1485. The king mounted, the princes and the armies entire go to meet them; whoever hears, others from divers parts come to his presence; all give thanks to God, they raise their voices, they say: \"Evil hath no existence; good things (or, the good) are ever ready for thee!\"\n\n1486. When they met and the meeters perceived each other, Avt'handil said with tender words to Tariel: \"Behold, seest thou the dust-dyed plains? Therefore a furnace consumes me, my heart is fevered and sad.\n\n1487. \"There is my foster-father; he is come to meet you. I cannot go thither, I am ashamed, a furnace consumes my heart; living man hath never been shamed as I am. What you intend to do for me you know, also P'hridon who is beside you.\"\n\n1488. Tariel said: \"Thou dost well to show respect to thy lord. Now stay, come not thither, stay alone without me. I will go; I will tell the king of thy hiding. With God's help I think I shall soon unite thee to that sun with the figure of an aloe.\"\n\n1489. The lion Avt'handil tarried there; a little tent was put up. Nestan-Daredjan also stayed there, the amazer of beholders; the zephyr of her eyelashes is wafted like a north-east wind. The King of the Indians departed, straight, not secretly.\n\n1490. P'hridon went with him; of a truth they were a long time crossing the field. The king knew (of their coming). Tariel went forward alone, his figure swayed; he dismounted and did homage to the bold one strong as a lion; he does honour to the King of the Indians as a father.\n\n1 Chemad aracad, after my pattern; araci, a fable.\n2 Khalva, A., 12, 303, 1122.\n3 Aravi, Ch. Dict.; ar avi, not ill, Car. and Ch. edition of 1860.\n4 Misruli miuparavi.\n1491. Tariel also did homage; he goes to kiss, to greet. The king kissed his neck to give pleasure to his lips; in wonder he speaks, in order to embolden him:\\(^1\\) \u201cThou art the sun; separation from thee turns day into night.\u201d\n\n1492. The king marvelled at his beauty and good looks, he gazes with wonder on his face, he praises the hardihood\\(^2\\) of his arms. Then P\u2019hridon also greeted him; he did homage to the king, to the king eager for the sight of Avt\u2019handil.\n\n1493. The king shrinks from praising Taria, and is discouraged. Tariel says: \u201cO king, hereby is my heart subjected to thee; I marvel how you can think thus of my worth; since Avt\u2019handil is thine, how can any other please thee!\u201d\n\n1494. \u201cDost thou not wonder at not seeing him, and at his tarrying! Come and let us sit down, O king, pleasant is this meadow\\(^3\\) of verdure; I will venture to tell you the reason why I could not bring him before you; I have a favour to ask of you, now I must beg leave\\(^4\\) of you.\u201d\n\n1495. The kings sat down; the multitude of the host stood round. A smile brighter than a lamp\\(^5\\) flits\\(^6\\) over Tariel\u2019s face; the sight maddens the beholders of his bearing and gestures.\\(^7\\) He began to relate to the king a speech wisely chosen:\\(^8\\)\n\n1496. \u201cO king, I hold myself unworthy to mention this,\\(^9\\) but I am come before you to entreat, to beg; he himself beseeches who seems a sun-like shedder of rays, he who is my light and enlightener.\n\n1497. \u201cNow we both venture to approach thee with prayer and entreaty.

I will not weary thee; a long story is beyond our powers.\\(^1\\)\n\n1498. \"Your (children) love each other, the maid loves him and he the maid; therefore I think on him pitiful, tearful and wan, on bended knee I entreat thee, let them no longer be consumed by flame, but give your daughter to the strong-armed, stout\\(^2\\)-hearted one.\n\n1499. \"No more than this will I ask of thee, neither short nor long.\" He drew forth his handkerchief,\\(^3\\) tied it round his neck, rose up, bent his knee, besought him like a (pupil) before a teacher.\\(^4\\) It astonished all men who heard this story.\n\n1500. When he saw Tariel on his bended knees, the king was dismayed; he went back a long way, he did homage, he fell down to the earth. He said: \"O monarch, all my joy is blown away from me; this abasement of you thus has saddened for me the sight of you.\n\n1501. \"How could it be that man should not grant thee whatever thou desirest, or that I should grudge my daughter if thou didst wish (to devote her) to death or slavery\\(^5\\) even! If you had even ordered it from your home,\\(^6\\) not even then would my tears flow; none other can she find like him if she fly up even to heaven!\n\n1502. \"I could not find a better son-in-law than Avt'handil. Myself I have given the realm to my daughter, she has it and it befits her; the rose blooms anew, my flower is blown. What objection can I make? Only let him be satisfied!\n\n1503. \"If thou wert to marry her to some slave, even then I would not grudge her to thee. Who could refuse thee, how could any save a madman quarrel with thee! If I loved not Avt'handil, why did I thus yearn for him? Verily, O God, I am in Thy presence, this is confirmed by me.\"\n\n1504. When Tariel heard this speech from the king, he\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) ? \"We have not time for a long story.\"\n\\(^2\\) P'likali (42), slab of marble, etc.\n\\(^3\\) Khel-mandili.\n\\(^4\\) Mzrdeli, upbringer.\n\\(^5\\) Sacvdavad da tqvedtza; sacvdavi, mortal; tqve, slave, prisoner.\n\\(^6\\) Sense doubtful.\nbowed himself, humbly did homage, fell on his face. Then the king did homage to him, he came forward, he stood before him. They thanked each other, nor were they at all annoyed.\n\n1505. P'hridon mounted, he galloped as herald of good tidings to Avt'handil\u2014indeed, he also rejoiced at this great joy\u2014he went and took him, led him and accompanied him; but he is abashed before the king, darkly he shed (his) beam.\\(^1\\)\n\n1506. The king arose, met him; the knight dismounted when (the king) came; in his hands he had a handkerchief, therewith he hid his face. The sun was concealed by a cloud, it grew gloomy, the rose was chilled; but how could anything hide his beauty!\n\n1507. The king would have kissed him, tears no longer flow, Avt'handil embraced his feet, the ray streams down; (the king) said: \u201cArise, be not ashamed, thou has revealed thy prowess; since thou art loyal to me, be not ashamed; why shouldst thou be ashamed before me?\u201d\n\n1508. He embraced him, he kissed him all over his face; he said: \u201cThou hast quenched my hot fire, though tardily hast thou appeared to me as water;\\(^2\\) to her who has herded in the jet and the vicinity (?realm) of the eyelashes\\(^3\\) to-morrow I shall unite thee, O lion, with the sun, come quickly to her.\u201d\\(^4\\)\n\n1509. The king embraced the neck of that lion and hero-like one,\\(^5\\) he seats him close, he speaks to him, kisses him, gazes on his face. That sun so met royalty, as he was worthy of it. Then is joy pleasant, when a man hath passed through grief.\n\n1510. The knight says to the king: \u201cI marvel that thou speakest of something else, why thou desirest not to see the sun, or why thou delayest! Meet her gaily, conduct her\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Movaneba, full moon, to be at the full; 106, 1510.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ch., are mare: the fires of grief are quenched, but the tear of joy flows; Car., ar emare (for emale); the latter reading is adopted.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf.

The four identical terminations render the quatrain obscure.\n\n\\(^5\\) Gmiri, 1426.\nto your house; be clothed in her rays, set them around\\(^1\\) as a light.\"\n\n1511. He told Tariel also; they mounted and went to meet the lady. The cheeks of those three Goliaths were dyed to sun colour (\\(i.e.\\), shone like the sun); they met what they desired, they found what they sought; they had handled their swords, not girded them idly on their loins.\n\n1512. Dismounting afar off, the king greeted the lady, the lightning flashing from her cheeks blinded his eyes; she met him, sitting in the palanquin she kissed him. The king began a eulogy; he was wholly bereft of his wits.\n\n1513. He said: \"O sun, how shall I praise thee, O light, and maker of good weather! For thy sake understandings are mad, and not for nought. O sun-like and moon-like, to what planet do they liken thee!\\(^2\\) No longer do I wish to look on you, O ye roses and violets!\"\n\n1514. All they that saw her marvelled at the shedding of her rays. Like a sun she blinded the eyes of the onlookers by the sight of her light; burned by her they found the comfort of their hearts in gazing; wheresoever she appeared crowds came running towards her.\n\n1515. They mounted, they all went homewards,\\(^3\\) they have the seven planets\\(^4\\) to compare with\\(^5\\) that sun; her beauty is incomprehensible, it is beyond their understanding. Soon they came to the place\\(^6\\) of the king's dwelling-house.\n\n1516. They came in, they saw T'hinat'hin, the bestower of woe on them that look on her; the wearing of the purple\\(^7\\) beautified the sceptre\\(^8\\) and crown\\(^9\\) bearer; the radiance of\n\n---\n\n1 Movaneba, 1505.\n2 ?

Lat. corona, 1533.\nher face rested on the faces of the new-comers. The King of the Indians entered, that hero-like sun.\n\n1517. Tariel and his wife humbly saluted the maid, they met, kissed and held pleasant converse, they illumined that house (hall), they made not the light to fade; they turned crystal and ruby into cheeks, jet into eyelashes.\n\n1518. T'hinat'hin invited them up to the lofty royal throne. Tariel said: \"Sit thou; it is desired by the Supreme Judge\\(^1\\); this day more than all days thy throne befits thee, I seat the lion of lions beside thee the sun of suns.\"\n\n1519. Both (? Tariel and Rostevan) took him by the hand and set him on her throne; they placed Avt'handil by the side of her for desire of whom he was slain; she is better than the seen and the unseen, (better) than all sights. Think not any were like them in love, not even Ramin and Vis.\\(^2\\)\n\n1520. The maiden was bashful and astonished to have Avt'handil seated by her side; her colour paled and her heart shot forth a tremor from within.\\(^3\\) The king said: \"Child, why art thou so bashful before me? the sages say that love in its end will not fail.\\(^4\\)\n\n1521. \"Now, children, God grant you a thousand years' length of life, happiness, prosperity, glory, and, moreover, freedom\\(^5\\) from ills; may heaven not make you fickle,\\(^6\\) may it fall to your lot to be steadfast like it, may my fate be to have the earth heaped over me by your hands.\"\n\n1522. Then the king commanded the armies to do homage to Avt'handil: \"This is your king,\" quoth he, \"such was God's will. This day he hath my throne, I\n\n---\n\n1 \\(Bdche bdchet'ha\\), judge of judges.\n2 The Story of the Loves of Vis and Ramin, of which the scene is laid in Merv, is the oldest novel in the world. For an account of the Georgian version, cf. J.R.A.S., July, 1902; cf. this poem, 182, 1058.\n3 Shedagamo. M. Tsere't'heli suggests she da gamo (cf. midamo), coming in and going out\u2014i.e., frequent.\n4 Tsakh'doma, pass away, perish: 1 Cor. xiii. 8, \"Charity never faileth\"\u2014lit., \"Love, its final non-failure (i.e., triumph) is told by the sages.\"\n5 Gardukh'deloba, not to experience, not to pay; 1555.\n6 Change you, shegtzvlit'h.\nhave old age like an infection.\\(^1\\) Serve him as well as you have served me,\\(^2\\) keep my command.\"\n\n1523. The soldiers and the magnates bent, humbly they did homage; they said: \"Let us be as the earth to them that dispose of our lives\\(^3\\); them who magnify those of us who are obedient, who liken the disobedient unto corpses, who make the arms of foes to fail (and) encourage our hearts!\"\n\n1524. Tariel too spoke with a eulogy\\(^4\\) the glorification of hope; he said to the maiden: \"You are united, no longer the heat of fires burns thee, thy husband is my brother, I desire too that you be my sister, I will bring to nought those who are false and opposed to thee.\"\n\nXLVII\n\nHERE IS THE MARRIAGE OF AVT'HANDIL AND T'HNAT'HIN BY THE KING OF THE ARABS\n\n1525. That day Avt'handil sits as lord and is high king; tenderesses\\(^5\\) beautify Tariel who sits with him. Nestan-Djar,\\(^6\\) the amazer of onlookers, is with T'hnat'hin; it is as if heaven had bent down to earth, (and) two suns are united.\n\n1526. They began to bring bread\\(^7\\) to plenish the armies; beeves and sheep are slain more abundant than moss. There was made an offering of presents, fitting to them (i.e., to each after his rank). The ray of the faces of them all lightens like the sun.\n\n1527. The bowls\\(^8\\) were of jacinth, the cups were of ruby; moreover, wondrously coloured vessels bear passing\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) 36, 492.\n\\(^2\\) Chemad stsorad, equally with me.\n\\(^3\\) Holldack, op. cit.\n\\(^4\\) Keba, 1027, 1430, 1535, 1512.\n\\(^5\\) Sinaze.\n\\(^6\\) Cf.

The panegyrist of that wedding would be praised by the sages. O onlooker, thou wouldst have said unto thy heart: \"Be not loosed, be bound there!\"  \n\n1528. The (female) minstrels approached from all sides, there was heard the sound of the cymbal; heaped lies a hillock of gold and cut rubies; for drinkers flows a fountain of wine from a hundred (runlets), like a canal; from twilight to dawn there was noise, the time of morning passed.\n\n1529. None remained without a gift, neither lame nor crippled; pearls rolled to and fro, scattered, thrown about; satin and solid gold were of none account, to be carried away. For three days the King of the Indies was as a groomsman to Avt'handil.\n\n1530. On the morrow the King of the Arabs again entertains; he is not listless. He said to Tariel: \"Pleasant it is to gaze on thy sun (Nestan)! Thou art king of all kings, and she queen. It behoves us your footprints (dust of your feet), to pierce our ears for earrings (as slaves)?\"\n\n1531. \"Now, O king, it is not fitting that we should sit on a level with you!\" The royal throne he (Rostevan) placed for (Tariel), and another couch apart; he placed Avt'handil and his wife lower down, according to their rank. First of all they present gifts for Taria; they lie in a heap.\n\n1532. The King of the Arabs plays the host, he does nothing but entertain; sometimes he approaches these, sometimes those, he stands not upon his royal dignity; he gives, and all praise his ungrudging generosity. P'hridon sits near Avt'handil, as one accustomed to kingship.\n\n1533. The king (Rostevan) did honour to the daughter of\n\n---\n\n1 Sika, an obscure phrase.\n2 Makebi-catzi, eulogist, ? poet.\n3 1270.\n4 Mutribi, A.\n5 Tsintsila, 46, 1100; Marr, iv., r e g, for Syriac form of the word.\n6 Mili, 284, 1435.\n7 Khma; some read sma, drinking.\n8 Codchli, ?

Still he gave to both gifts fitting their fate; a thousand gems born of a Roman hen\\(^1\\); then a thousand pearls like a dove\u2019s egg\\(^2\\); a thousand steeds,\\(^3\\) in size each like a hill.\\(^4\\)\n\n1535. To P\u2019hridon he gave nine\\(^5\\) trays full to the brim\\(^6\\) with pearls, nine steeds richly saddled. The King of the Indians does homage with dignity,\\(^7\\) wise, not drunkenly;\\(^8\\) he gave thanks soberly though he had drunk of the wine.\\(^9\\)\n\n1536. Why should I lengthen (speech)? The days of one month passed. They sported, they ceased not at all from drinking. To Tariel they presented wondrous jewels of ruby stone. Their radiance like the sun\u2019s covers them all.\n\n1537. Tariel was like a rose, and was snowing a light snow shower; he sent Avt\u2019handil to Rosten to ask for leave; he gave him this message: \u201cTo be near thee is enough for me as full joy, (but) enemies hold my kingdom, I know they are eating up the land.\\(^10\\)\n\n1538. \u201cThe knowledge and art of the learned destroy\\(^11\\) the unlearned. I think any hurt to me would bring somewhat of sadness into you too.\\(^12\\) I go that tarrying here may not bring evil upon me, soon again may I see you happy, may God\u2019s will grant it!\u201d\n\n1539. Rostevan said: \u201cO king, why art thou so bashful? Whatever is best for you do it, look into it, examine it.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Dedlisa; var. dedisa, of a mother.

Avt'handil said to Tariel those (same) two words (that Rostevan had said). He (Tariel) said: \"Speak not thus; guard the crystal mounds.\" How canst thou, O sun, depart from the newly united moon!\" Avt'handil said: \"I shall not be seduced by thee with this:\n\n1541. \"Of a truth thou wishest not to forsake me while thou goest away slandering me, saying: 'He loveth his wife, forsooth; he hath forsaken me, 'twas like him!' Am I to remain sundered from thee and an object of pity to myself! For a man to forsake his friend! . . . Ugh! Ugh! he will do ill!\"'\n\n1542. Tariel's smile is like the sprinkling of crystal with roses. He said: \"Absent from thee I bewail myself more than thou. Since thou wishest it, come away with me, accuse me not of flattery.\" Avt'handil commands troops to be summoned to him from all sides.\n\n1543. He assembled the armies of Arabia, no time is wasted; eighty thousand men were all arrayed, man and horse clad in armour of Khvarazmia. The King of the Arabs eats the gall of bitterness at their separation.\n\n1544. Parting each from other, both maidens, the adopted sisters, sworn with the oath of sisterhood, trusting in each other's word, with breast welded to breast, with neck riveted to neck, wept. The onlookers, too, had their hearts consumed.\n\n1545. When the moon is on a level with the star of dawn, both shine equally; should (one) go away, (the other also)\n\n---\n\n1 Or \"walls\"; gore, 1267; Ch., T'hinat'hin's breasts; Car. suggests \"hide thy crystal mounds\"\u2014i.e., \"shut thy teeth! say no more!\"\n\n2 Or, \"this thou wilt imagine!\"\n\n3 Akh!\n\n4 ? or, \"ill will befall him,\" \"it will fall out ill.\"\n\n5 389, 495.\n\n6 Dad-p'hitzni.

He who created them such, He Himself shall sunder them, though of their own will they desire not parting. They glue together and cleave the rose,\\(^2\\) they weep and tears flow; all those who parted from them thought their lives of no account.\n\n1547. Nestan-Daredjan said: \u201cWould that I had never come to know thee! Separated from the sun I should not now be thus melted by parting. Thou shalt know tidings of me; let me have news of thee, speak to me in letters. As I am burned up for thy sake, thou shalt melt for mine.\u201d\n\n1548. T\u2019hinat\u2019hin said: \u201cO sun, delight of them that gaze on thee! How can I give thee up, or how can I endure parting! Instead of praying for days from God, I shall desire death. Mayst thou have as many days as I shall shed tears!\u201d\n\n1549. Again they kissed each other, those ladies parted; she who was left there could not take her eyes away from her who was gone; she too looks back, therefore flames consumed her. I cannot write down a tenth part of that I could wish!\n\n1550. Rostan at their departure was made more mad than madmen; a thousand times he says, \u201cWoe is me!\u201d not merely once doth he sigh; hot flows the spring of tears, as if a cauldron were being heated. Tariel\u2019s face is drawn, the soft snow\\(^3\\) falls gently, it wastes away.\n\n1551. The king crushed\\(^4\\) Tariel\u2019s rose with embracing and kissing. Quoth he: \u201cYour presence hitherto seems like a dream to me; when thou art gone afar from me I shall remain with my sufferings twentyfold increased. Life was given to us by thee; by thee also shall we be slain.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) Kedgoreba, Ch., raise the head to see better.

Tariel mounted and parting from the king gave him a farewell greeting; all the soldiers shed tears moistening the meadows, they said: \"The sun hastes to greet thee, haste thou too to meet him.\" He said: \"Weeping for your sake, why should I hasten?\"  \n\n1553. They set out and departed with many troops and much baggage \u2014 Tariel, P'hridon, Avt'handil, (all) well provided; he had eighty thousand men with worthy steeds; the three went on, helpful one to another.\n\n1554. The three went their way\u2014God can never create their like again! They were met; none dared withstand them. In the plain they tarried for dinner when morning was past. As was fitting they feasted; they drank wine, not buttermilk.\n\n1555. What Tariel and his wife had desired fell to their lot, seven royal thrones, (seats) of joy, unassailable; this present solace makes them forget their sufferings. A man unacquainted with sorrow cannot find pleasure in joy.\n\n1556. See the two sitting together; even the sun could not be better! They blow the trumpet and proclaim him king, copper drums make the voices sound sweet; they give him the key of the treasuries, they gave themselves into his hands as subjects. \"This is our king!\" they cried, and they acclaimed him.\n\n1557. They caused two thrones to be prepared for Avt'handil and P'hridon, they sat royally thereon, they extolled their majesty, what other human beings did God create like them! They related their sorrows; they revealed them to all.\n\n1558. They drank, ate, made merry, they increased the\n\n---\n\n1 Mas alame, Ch.; Car., masa hlame.\n2 M.

They gathered together treasure to give to the poor.\n\n1559. All the Indians considered Avt\u2019handil and P\u2019hridon to be helpers (allies). \u201cFrom you every good happens to us,\u201d said they ceaselessly; they looked upon them as lords (suzerains\\(^2\\)), whatever they willed that they did, they came before them continually to pay court to them.\n\n1560. The King of the Indians said to Asmat\u2019h, the sharer of his sorrows\\(^3\\): \u201cWhat thou hast done, neither upbringer nor upbrought hath done (for each other).\\(^4\\) Now I enthrone thee over one seventh part of the kingdom of India, thine let it be, serve us, sweet to the sweet!\\(^5\\)\n\n1561. \u201cWhomsoever thou desirest as husband wed him, rule the kingdom, henceforth serve us, be subject to us.\u201d Asmat\u2019h covered his feet with kisses. \u201cFrom thee is\\(^6\\) my power,\u201d quoth she; \u201cwhat can I find, what better service can I have than thine!\u201d\n\n1562. The three sworn brothers tarried together a few days. They sported, they received more incomparable gifts; what rare\\(^7\\) pearls, what excellent horses! But longing (for T\u2019hinat\u2019hin) made Avt\u2019handil to show lines on his face.\\(^8\\)\n\n1563. Tariel perceived that longing of the knight for his wife. He said: \u201cOf a truth thy heart is angered against me.

I shall desire thee as the deer the fountain.\"\u00b9\n\n1565. As presents for Rostevan, he (Tariel) made him (Avt'handil) take with him beautiful little mantles,\u00b2 also a vessel (full) of cut gems, not spoons(ful), not ladles(ful).\u00b3 \"Take them from me, go,\" quoth he, \"disobey me not!\" Avt'handil said: \"I know not how I shall survive without thee!\"\n\n1566. The lady (Nestan) sent to the lady (T'hinat'hin) a little cloak\u2074 and a veil\u2075; who save her\u2076 was worthy of such garments! A jewel\u2014he who carried it off could not say: \"I have carried it in vain!\"\u2014at night it gives light like the sun;\u2077 it is visible wherever thou lookest.\n\n1567. Avt'handil mounted, he departed, he said farewell to Taria, the flame of the fire of separation burned them both; all the Indians wept, the tear moistened the mead. Avt'handil said: \"The poison\u2078 of this world slays me!\"\n\n1568. P'hridon and Avt'handil journeyed together for a few days; the road separated them, each went his way weeping; the things they had planned had turned out well for them; Avt'handil came to Arabia, he had not seen troubles in vain.\u2079\n\n1569. The Arabs came forth to meet him, he beautified the realm; he saw his sun, the affliction of his desires fled; he sat with her on the throne, he rejoiced at the joy of the onlookers. The Most High from above endued his crown with sovereignty.\n\n1570. Those three sovereigns loved\u00b9\u2070 one another, they visited one another, their desires were fulfilled, they that disputed their rule\u00b9\u00b9 were put to the sword,\u00b9\u00b2 they enlarged\n\n\u00b9 835. \u00b2 Djubacha, 499, dim. of djuba, 218, 465.\n\u00b3 Chamcha, Turk. \u2074 Qabacha, P., 489.\n\u2075 Ride, 123, 124, 480. \u2076 Mat'h, them, pl. maj.; or ?

This is such a world as is not to be trusted by any; it is a moment to the eyes of men, and only long enough for the blinking of the eyelashes. What seek you, what do you? Fate is an insulter.

PROFESSOR MARR'S RENDERING OF THE INTRODUCTORY QUATRAINS - - - 261\n\nII. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE - - - 265\n\nIII. GROUPS OF REFERENCES - - - 269\nAPPENDIX I\n\nAN ENGLISH RENDERING OF THE RUSSIAN TRANSLATION BY PROFESSOR MARR OF THE INTRODUCTORY QUATRAINS OF \"THE MAN IN THE PANTHER'S SKIN\" (\"Teksty,\" T. XII., pp. 7-9).\n\n[The numbers given in round brackets are those of the strophes in the preceding translation.]\n\nGod and the King [1 (1)].\u2014He who by His mighty power created the firmament breathed a celestial spirit from heaven and made what is; to us men He gave the earth: we own its infinite variety. And every king is ordained by Him in the image issuing from Him.\n\nThe Georgian King David Soslan, Consort of Queen T'hamara [2 (3)].\u2014Behold the lion! (lit., To the lion to whom is fitting . . .). It befitted him to use spear, sword, and shield; (he is the lion of [lit., to the lion of]) Queen T'hamara, the sun, whose cheeks are like rubies, whose hair is like jet: dare I sing of him and extol him in verse? (lit., the singing of the sermon [for doxology] of verses). Of a truth, they that gaze on him cannot but taste sugar and milk. (For khshiri, which breaks the rhythm, read sherisa; Pers. shir = milk.)\n\nThe Subject of the Poet's Songs [3 (25)].\u2014The poet ought not to lavish his labour in frivolity. One (woman) should be the subject of his madness, he must love but one; let him for her alone show his art, laud her alone, embellish her alone (in song). Save her let him need nought: let the music of his discourse sound for her alone. (Cf. Prof. Marr's Odopistsi for another version.)\n\n[4 (26)].\u2014Now you shall know concerning me: I laud her for whom Heaven has already set apart a place in Itself (more literally, whom Heaven has made Its own, or made Its denizen, or adopted for Its own; ikia, second aorist of verb derived from adverb iki = there, is equivalent to \"has made\nits own,\" etc.). (A song to her) is great praise to me; it is no shame to me. She is my life; she is pitiless as a Circassian (dchiki; cf. Adighe, Zqkxoi). Hereafter I name her name, I bestrew her (with pearls of song), I laud her (lit., her name, bestrewing, I pronounce hereafter, I praise).\n\n**The Odes to Queen T'hamara [5 (4)].**\u2014Let us sing the Queen T'hamara while shedding tears of blood; in her honour have I indited songs (lit., whose songs I spoke\u2014vst'hkveni, aorist first person singular, with indication of relation to plural [kebani]), not ill-chosen are they: for ink I used a lake of jet (cf. Odes, V. 50, xii. 8), for pen a wavering reed (nai [Pers.]; the terminal i in Rust'haveli is only a mark of the nominative case, and not the Persian semivowel i, corresponding to Georgian \u0259, which, according to M. E. T'haqaishevili, had not yet come into the mkhedruli [military or civil] alphabet from the khutsuri [ecclesiastical]. For use of na as musical instrument, cf. 178.) A spear, through-piercing, shall rend the heart of him who hears those songs (lit., He who hears, into his heart will pierce a lance, lacerating).\n\n[6 (5)].\u2014She bade me compose in her honour sweet (-sounding) verses, (praise her) eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair, her lips and her teeth, carved (turned) out of crystal and ruby, and firmly set. On an anvil of soft lead even a hard stone can be broken.\n\n**New Beginning [7 (17)].**\u2014(My) eyes not enlightened by her rays (or lightless\u2014i.e., blind\u2014on account of her rays) again long to show themselves to her. My heart has gone mad, there remains for it but one thing (lit., Behold, the heart has gone mad, to it has fallen the lot): to flee to the wilderness. In her power it lies to set the flesh on fire and give joy to the soul; entreat her for me (lit., For me, m[i]-, beg her, iadjet'h, or, For me, m-, intercede, iadjet'h, before her\u2014cf. 816, 819, 1035\u2014who is sufficient to give burning to the flesh, comfort [lkhena, cf. 300] to the soul); I fear verses will fail (me), I am about to laud three forms (or colours\u2014i.e., three types of heroes\u2014Tariel, Avt'handil, and P'hridon).\n\n[8 (16)].\u2014This (is a) Persian tale transferred into the Georgian language: like a rare pearl worthy of fondling (by rolling it) from hand to hand; it came to my hands, and I shall put it into verse (vpove and gardavt'hkvi both in the aorist, despite the future sense), I shall perform a feat, there will be reason for pride. I await the approval of the stately beauty who has robbed me of reason (lit., She has deprived me of reason, the stately and beautiful, let her give me approval! Cf. Odes, xii. 15).\nREQUEST TO THE BELOVED [9 (6)].\u2014Thus I need for the making of my song tongue, heart and art. Let her give me strength and uphold me. I shall put into (the song all) my mind, which is in her power, and then we shall help Tariel (lit., Now are needful for composition tongue, heart and art. Let her give me power and help. From her I have mind [wit] to put into, etc.; but in the printed texts T\u2019hamara is addressed in the second person singular in this strophe, which perhaps the copyists thought addressed to God. The poet asks T\u2019hamara for mind [wit] because she had robbed him thereof). It is necessary to tell in chosen language of the three stars, giant-heroes, obedient one to another like slaves (lit., It is inherent in them to be slaves one of another).\n\nINVOCATION TO FELLOW-SUFFERERS [10 (7)].\u2014Come, ye to whom from birth the fate of Tariel is appointed (lit., who is born with a birth exactly like his; cf. 852, 4), and whose tears flow undrying for him! (cf. Odes, p. 68). Let us sit down! I, the man of Rust\u2019havi, pierced through the heart by a lance (of sympathy; cf. 5, 4) for him, will sit and expound (both \u201csit\u201d and \u201cexpound\u201d in the past tense in the accepted text; but this is evidently a copyist\u2019s error) in verse. That which till now was a tale will henceforth be a threaded pearl.\n\nVARIETY OF VOCATION [11 (18)].\u2014Let everyone be content with that which Fate gives him, and let everyone speak of his own lot. Let the ploughman ceaseless plough, the warrior show his prowess, but let him that is in love cherish mad love, and be compassionate to (lit., acknowledge) the love (of others). Neither have others the right to censure love in him, nor has he that right over others.\n\nLOVE [12 (9)].\u2014Love-madness is a wondrous fair thought, hard to be apprehended; it cannot be compared with carnal passion, it is something different; love is one thing, lust is another; their bounds are separated by a vast space. Confuse them not. Do ye hear my words? (reading gesmist\u2019h for gesmast\u2019h).\n\n[13 (12)].\u2014The highest love is to bury sufferings in oneself: he hides them; when alone, he is always with her in thought (lit., let him always remember at home [alone]), and he loves solitude (lit., he ought to be in solitude). Away (from her) he loses consciousness and dies; absent he burns and flames (lit., Afar to lose consciousness, afar to die, afar to burn, afar to flame). He is ready rather to endure calmly royal wrath, but towards her he feels fear and reverence.\n\n[14 (8)].\u2014The lover must have an exquisitely fair exterior and shine like the sun; he must be sage, rich, open-handed,\nhe must be a knight (lit., have the qualities or attributes of a knight), he must have leisure; he must be a master of speech, a possessor of intelligence and patience, a conqueror of all-powerful adversaries. He who is not endowed with all these things has not the qualities of a lover.\n\n[15 (10)].\u2014He who is possessed by love-madness is constant; he is not an adulterer, no base libertine. Separated from his beloved, his sighs and groans become stronger. His heart is satisfied with one, though she be stern and wrathful. Hateful to me are caresses in which the soul is not felt: huggings, kisses and the smacking of lips.\n\n[16 (11)].\u2014Lovers, you must not call it love if one easily bears the torture (lit., disease or pain, reading lmobasa) of separation, if to-day he want one (woman) and to-morrow another. This reminds me of the frivolous games of youth; (it is) childishness. The true lover is he who checks earthly impulses.\n\nPoesy [17 (19)].\u2014Poesy is first of all a branch of wisdom: the divine in it must be hearkened to with reverence; it is very instructive to the hearer. He who is prepared finds satisfaction in this domain. A vast thought may be put into a short phrase: herein is the beauty of poesey.\n\n[18 (20)].\u2014In like manner as the best trial of a horse is a long course and an easy win, as a ball-player is judged in the field by his unerring aim and clever stroke, so with the poet skill to indite lengthy songs and curb (?) (the steed of poesey) if he has exhausted the subject of his discourse and rhyme begins to dry up.\n\n[19 (21)].\u2014Contemplate the poet and his songs when his tongue fails him (lit., when he cannot attain [the perfection] of the Georgian [speech]; or, when he cannot hit upon [the exact expressions] of Georgian), and his rhymes begin to grow thin! Shortens he not his discourse? Weakens not his speech? (lit., Will he not abridge [diminish] the Georgian language?). Has he heroic hardihood enough to strike cunningly with the chogan (polo-stick)? (lit., Will he strike with the polo-stick with skilful hand? Will he show the high quality of a hero?).\n\n[20 (22)].\u2014He who chances to say two words in verse cannot be called a poet (lit., He is not called a poet if somewhere he says one, two [verses]); in vain he puts himself on a level with singers of renown. He makes one verse, another (lit., of course, to make one [verse], another): they are not like anything; they are incoherent. Yet he asseverates, \"Mine is better!\" as stubbornly as a mule.\n[21 (23)].\u2014Another (form) is fugitive verse; this is the domain of poets powerless to pour out (? mould) heart-piercing thoughts in perfect (forms) (lit., Another versification is small [verse], the domain . . . He is not able in perfection to create words capable of piercing the heart). I liken this to the wretched bow of young hunters: big beasts they cannot bring down; they can kill only small game.\n\n[22 (24)].\u2014A third (kind of) songs is fitting for banquets and merrymakings, for courtship, for amusement and frivolous adventures with friends, and to these songs we gladly have recourse (lit., we like [the making of] them) if the thought in them be clearly expressed. But he who is incapable of creating something great is no poet.\n\nProfessor Marr rejects the nine remaining quatrains as spurious. It will be seen that he has rearranged the quatrains, and adopted readings which are not in the printed editions.\n\nAPPENDIX II\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\nThe following is a list of some books and pamphlets collected by the translator, and now the property of the Bodleian Library, Oxford.\n\nTEXT.\n\nKing Vakhtang's edition in quarto, with a commentary.
