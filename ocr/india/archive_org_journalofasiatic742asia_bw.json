Gamble, C.I.E., F.R.S., late of the Indian Forest Department.\n\nNo. 16.\n\nThe present contribution commences with an account of the genus *Psychotria*, which concludes the Natural Order *Rubiaceae*. In addition, it contains accounts of the Natural Orders *Valerianaceae* and *Compositae* (prepared by Sir G. King); *Stylidieae*, *Goodenoviae*, and *Campanulaceae* (prepared by Mr. Gamble); *Vacciniaceae* and *Ericaceae* (Sir G. King); *Epacrideae* and *Plumbagineae* (Mr. Gamble). For the new genera and species proposed in these Orders the authors are jointly responsible. The account of the Order *Monotropae* has been supplied by Lieut.-Col. Prain, F.R.S., Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta; and that of the Order *Gentianae* has been added, having been drawn up by Mr. C. B. Clarke, F.R.S., late President of the Linnean Society of London. It is somewhat out of its proper sequence, but has been included, as the descriptions were ready for publication.\n\nIn addition, therefore, to the account of the Rubiaceous genus *Psychotria*, with 29 Malayan Peninsular species, of which 11 are new to science, this fasciculus contains accounts of the Malayan members of 11 Natural Orders, including 48 genera and 81 species, of which 2 genera and 17 species are new to science.\n\nNat.

Beng. LXXIII. 2, 205.\nPerak, in heavy jungle at about 3,500 feet elevation: Scortechini; Kunstler 2715.\n\nAccording to the field notes recorded by these two careful collectors the specimens gathered by Kunstler differ from those obtained by Scortechini; in the latter the scales were lurid purple and the flowers were white, in the former the scales were waxy white and the flowers bright yellow. The petals in Kunstler's plant are sparingly hirsute within and the anthers are nearly twice as long. In other respects, however, the two plants are identical, and the doubt that one feels in connection with the two is not so much as to whether they are conspecific, as it is as to whether this Malayan Cheilothea be really specifically separable from the species from the Khasia Hills upon which Hooker originally based the very distinct genus Cheilothea. The only very tangible differences are that in the Khasia plant only 3 to 4 scales can be with propriety considered sepals, whereas in the Malayan one the number of sepals, as apart from the upper scales or bracts, is 5; and that in the Khasia plant the anthers are long, like linear lips on each side of the connective, whereas in the Malayan plant the anthers are much shorter and distinctly hippocrepiform. The fruit appears to be quite indehiscent, and thus deviates from the fruit in other genera of Monotrope\u00e6, which, so far as is known, is always loculicidally dehiscent.\n\nOrder LXVIII.

Mez describes them as either 4- or 5-merous. This is a well-marked species on account of its large terminal inflorescence, whose pubescent branches easily distinguish it from those occasional forms of *M. ramentacea* which have part of the inflorescence pseudo-terminal.\n\n2. *M\u00e6sa ramentacea*, Wall, in Roxb.

The large mass of material available shows clearly that in shape of leaf and in inflorescence the variation is regular, and that the form with cordate long-acuminate leaves passes gradually into that with ovate broad short-acuminate leaves, and that similarly the inflorescence changes.

Trimen (\"Flora of Ceylon\") and Cooke (\"Flora of Bombay\") that the word Illipe was not intended by K\u00f6nig to be employed as the name of a genus, but was merely mentioned as being the vernacular name employed by the natives of Malabar for one of the species.\n\nFlower-buds large, nearly \u00b775 in. long, conical; intramarginal nerve of leaves prominent; pedicels thick, 1\u00b75 to 2 in. long .. 1.

It gives the \"Taban\" Gutta or \"Taban Merah.\" It has become very scarce in a wild state, but is now being much planted, so perhaps it may soon again become common (see also H. C. Hill, Reports on Forest Conservancy in the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States, and Burn-Murdoch in \"Indian Forester,\" XXXI. 309, \"Some Facts about Gutta Percha.\") Ridley, in Trans. Linn. Soc. III. (1893), 317, says the tree was seen by him in several places in the Tahan woods, and that a considerable amount of guttapercha is collected there.\n\nVar. oblongifolia. A large tree; stem reaching 80 feet in height and up to 2 feet in diam. Leaves larger than in the typical form, obovate-oblong or lanceolate-oblong; longer, abruptly acuminate, reaching 7 in. in length and 3 in. in breadth, rather more conspicuously golden-pubescent.

Sumatra, Borneo. Gives guttapercha like the type.\n\nWe are unable to find sufficient characters for separating this, as a species, from P. Gutta, as is done by Burck. The specimens available seem to point to a regular series of intermediates, so that it can scarcely be even maintained as a variety. It is possible that P. malaccense and P. formosum, Pierre in Bull. Soc. Linn. Par. I. 498, are both forms of P. Gutta, but we have seen no specimens. Beccari in \"Nelle\nForesti di Borneo,\" p. 558, suggests the identity of the latter species with *P. oblongifolium*.\n\n5. **Palaquium Oxleyanum**, Pierre in Bull. Soc. Linn. Par.

Andaman, common.\n\nThis is in all probability specifically distinct from Merremia crispatula (Ipomoea petaloidea, Choisy), but it seems preferable to treat it for the moment as a variety of that species and not as a new species, because of its remarkable resemblance to Merremia Riedeliana, Hallier f. (Ipomoea Riedeliana, Oliv.), and Merremia mammosa, Hallier f. (Ipomoea mammosa, Choisy). From the former, as described and figured by Oliver, this differs in having a 4-celled ovary with 1 ovule in each cell, whereas M. Riedeliana has a 2-celled ovary with 4, sometimes 5, ovules in each cell. From M. mammosa, as figured by Rumphius, this differs in having obtuse calyx-lobes and a shaggy corolla; Rumphius' figure shows the sepals acute and the corolla glabrous. This plant appears to be the same thing as Convolvulus platypeltis, Span., from Timor, and if it proves to be distinct alike from M. Riedeliana and M. mammosa, which last is cited by Dr. Hallier as an Andaman plant, though we have no authentic example of M. mammosa from the Andamans at Calcutta, the name it should bear will be Merremia platypeltis.\n\n12.

Assam, Tenasserim, Chittagong, Java, Borneo, Philippines.\n\nThe three gatherings from Perak agree with each other in every respect. They differ from the plant as it occurs in Tenasserim, in having a more widely urceolate corolla and even longer and more lanceolate sepals; at the same time they differ from the plant as it occurs in the Malay Archipelago, in having the sepals narrowly lanceolate and acuminate, instead of ovate and sub-acute. As regards corolla, however, they are exactly like the species as it occurs elsewhere in Malaya. Since the Perak plant combines the characters of the two previously recognised species\u2014L. Wallichii with long acuminate sepals and L. flavescens with wide-urceolate corolla\u2014it appears to afford conclusive proof of the suggestion already made by Clarke, l.c., that the Assamese and the Malayan plants are no more than forms of one somewhat variable species. An Indian form occurs in Travancore; this has been characterised by Stapf as a distinct species, L. leiocalyx, probably quite justly, since the Travancore plant has quite glabrous and obtuse sepals: the same form occurs in Chittagong; otherwise, however, the Indian plant agrees with the forms reported from Indo-China and Malaya.\n\nIpomoea, Linn.\n\nHerbs, rarely shrubs, twining or prostrate, less often sub-erect or erect.

Flowers in open 3-8-flowered corymbose cymes 1 to 1.5 in. across; peduncles minutely sparingly rusty-pubescent, 2 to 5 in. long; bracts caducous. Sepals orbicular, minutely adpressed-grey-tomentose externally, in flower 0.25 in., in fruit 0.3 in. across, the inner larger than the outer. Corolla 1.5 in. long, infundibuliform-campanulate, pink, densely adpressed-fulvous-tomentose on tube and bands of limb externally. Berry sub-spherical to ellipsoid, 0.5 in. wide, 0.5 to 0.75 in. long, the base closely embraced by the sepals.\n\nPerak: Canfield's Hill, 4,000 feet, Scortechini 381! Birch's Hill, Ridley 10681! Maxwell's Hill, Ridley 5559!\n\nAs in the case of L. rubicunda, one or two bracts remain on the specimens; they are small, orbicular, 0.2 in. across, but it does not follow that the fallen bracts were so small. The corollas on Scortechini's specimens, on which the original description was based, are about 0.6 in. long, but subsequent material communicated by Mr. Ridley (Ridley 5559) shows that the flowers originally described were not fully expanded. Another of Mr. Ridley's specimens (10681) proves that the berry is not always sub-spherical. The species is obviously closely allied to L. rubicunda, but besides the very different degree of tomentum, L. Scortechini differs from L. rubicunda in having the inner sepals distinctly larger, instead of smaller, than the outer.\n\n9. Lettsomia rubicunda, Clarke in Hook. f. Flor. Brit. Ind. IV. 195. An extensive climber; stems fulvous-tomentose. Leaves elliptic, shortly abruptly acuminate or acute, base rounded, sub-coriaceous, densely tawny-tomentose beneath, glabrous above; length 5 to 7 in., width 2 to 4 in.; petiole tawny-tomentose, 1 to 2 in. long. Flowers in open many-flowered corymbose cymes, 2 to 4 in. across; peduncles tawny-tomentose, 3.5 to 7 in. long; bracts caducous.

One or two bracts remain; they are small, '2 in. across, and orbicular, but it does not follow that the fallen bracts were so small. There is no perfect corolla on the specimens at Calcutta; the length of the tube given above is derived from Mr. C. B. Clarke's description.\n\n10. **Lettsomia Kunstleri**, Prain Journ. As. Soc.

S. aculeatissimum var.? denudatum, Dun in DC. Prod. XIII. 244.\n\nSingapore: G. Thomson.\n\nThis is not in Herb. Calcutta. The above meagre description is taken from the accounts of Dunal in the Prodromus, and of Clarke in the Flora of British India. The specimen to which Clarke refers is one of the \"varieties\" of Dunal, not the true S. aculeatissimum of Jacquin, and Dunal himself was not satisfied that it is to Jacquin's species of this name that the variety should be referred. As it has not again been reported, it is possible we may have here to deal with an unusual state of some casually introduced and perhaps well-known American species.\n\n2.

Species 2 or more, natives of America.\n\nThe number of species is doubtful, and depends on the point of view of the reviewer with regard to the many more or less distinct forms assumed by the plants under cultivation; some writers recognise as many as 80, others claim only about 20; more recent authors insist only on 2 species\u2014a perennial (C. frutescens), and an annual (C. annum), both very variable. Possibly, however, there is but a single very variable species, for in the tropics the forms of C. annum are often not truly annual, and in temperate regions the perennial tropical forms rarely persist for more than a season.\n\nPedicels solitary, variously erect or reflexed; fruits erect or spreading or pendent, at least as long as, usually longer than, the pedicels; plants annual or biennial:\u2014\n\nFlowers white; berries at first green, afterwards becoming red, orange or yellow:\u2014\n\nFruit not globular:\u2014\nBerries tapering, much longer than broad:\u2014\n\nFruit stout, flesh thick, usually mildly pungent; calyx not enclosing base of berry ... ... ... 1.

Flowers pale yellow. I sent a similar one from Durian S. Batang, but I don't think the same.\" His field-note on genuine U. flexuosa is as follows: \"Growing in muddy pools of water; colour a dark reddish-brown, tinged with green; flower bright yellow.\"\n\nIn his interesting paper on the Utricularias of the Malay Peninsula (Journ. Bot. for 1895, pp. 10, 11) Mr. Ridley gives as localities for U. flexuosa Pahang and Kedah, Langkawi, but does not differentiate the two forms. The leaves, he remarks, are used in medicine by the Malays, who call it Lumut Ekor Kuching (Cat's Tail Moss) or Lumut Ekor Kuning (Yellow Tail Moss).\n\n3. UTRICULARIA PUNCTATA, Wall. Cat. 2121. A floating waterweed, with submerged divided capillary leaves, the segments interspersed with bladders, often with narrow, oblong, floating vesicles 1 to 3 in. long, beset with capillary leaves, near the base of the scapes. Scapes 4 to 12 in., usually many-flowered; pedicels slender, ascending or sub-erect in fruit, ultimately 5 to 6 in. long; bracts ovate, more or less acute, slightly produced beyond base; bracteoles 0.

Journ. Linn. Soc. III. 179. A slender erect weed of wet places. *Leaves* radical, linear or linear-spathulate, obtuse, very often persisting during flowering, '5 to '7 in. long; roots fibrous, sometimes with a few bladders. *Scapes* 5 to 12 in. long, usually many-flowered; beset with a few basified ovate-acute scales or empty bracts; pedicels short, '1 in. long in flower, in fruit '15 in. long and slightly winged by the decurrent calyx, erect or ascending, never recurved and rarely patent, with ovate-acute basal bracts. *Calyx* 2-lobed; lobes sub-equal, ovate or sub-orbicular, acute or sub-cuspidate, '25 in. long. *Corolla* blue with whitish lines, '25 in. wide; spur slightly longer than the lower calyx-\nlobe and the lower lip of the corolla. *Capsule* ovate, \u00b72 in. long, hidden by the calyx. *Seeds* obovoid, reticulate, cells of the testa sub-hexagonal. *U.

Mr. Ridley, in all probability rightly, considers that this is entitled to specific rank apart from *U. affinis*.\n\n6. **UTRICULARIA MINUTISSIMA**, Vahl Enum. I. 204. A very small erect weed of wet places; leaves 0 at time of flowering and not seen; roots fibrous, bladders not seen. *Scapes* capillary, rigid, branched, 2 to 3 in. long, quite glabrous, or with a few rigid scattered black hairs; racemes 2\u20135-flowered, beset with a few basifixed ovate-acute empty bracts or scales; pedicels very short, in fruit only \u00b705 in. long, occasionally like the upper calyx-lobe with a few straight black hairs, sub-patent, with small lanceolate basifixed bracts and bracteoles, less than half as long as their pedicels. *Calyx* 2-lobed, lobes sub-equal wide-oblong, obtuse, in fruit \u00b71 in. long. *Corolla* mauve, \u00b715 in. wide; spur wide-conic-cylindric, thrice as long as lower calyx-lobe and twice as long as lower lip of corolla. *Capsule* oblong, \u00b707 in. long, covered by the calyx. *Seeds* minute, ovoid, obscurely scrobiculate.

XXXIII. 11.\n\n**Perak**: Larut, Scortechini 1501! **Pahang**: Kwala Pahang, Ridley 1474c in part! **Malacca**: Koenig; on Mount Ophir, Ridley.\n\nThis small plant, collected by Scortechini with no note of colour, and stated by Ridley to have mauve flowers, is here identified with *U. minutissima*, Vahl, from description only. The branched capillary stems render it very like and very liable to be mistaken for small specimens of *U. verticillata*, which has, however, longer pedicels and bracts produced below their point of insertion. The presence of hairs on the stems, pedicels, and sometimes the calyx, at once suggests a reference to *U. hirta*, which is undoubtedly its nearest affinity. The scape, however, appears never to branch in *U. hirta*; the flowers in that species are larger and fewer; the pubescence, too, when present in *U. minutissima*, which is not always the case, is very different, consisting of rigid patent black bristly hairs, whereas in *U. hirta* the hairs are soft and grey or tawny. The seeds of the two species are very similar, but those of *U. minutissima* are smaller and yet have fewer- and larger-meshed sub-hexagonal reticulations.\n\n7. **UTRICULARIA WALlichiana**, Wight Ic. t. 1572, fig. 1.

The fruit is edible, and the stems give a kind of gutta-percha or rubber (*Curtis*). *Curtis*'s specimens bear the Malay names \"Gutta Garoo,\" \"Gutta Garok,\" \"Getab Ujol,\" \"Getah greep betina.\" The Fl. Br. Ind. gives \"Gutta Singgarip,\" after Murton. As Stapf remarks in Hook. Ic. t. 2344, the Kew material shows that, in Borneo especially, there are varieties locally known by different names, and differing chiefly in the fruit, which ought to be studied on the spot.\n\n*King's Collector* 7729 from Gunong Budo, Perak, at 500 to 800 ft., seems to be a large-leaved variety of this species. The leaves reach 7 in. in length and 3\u00b75 in. in breadth; when dry they are greenish on the upper and shining brown on the lower surface. The flowers are in sessile cymes, and the corolla has oblong blunt lobes.\n\n6. *Willughbeia martabanica*, Wall. Cat. 1619 (1827), and Pl. As. Rar. III. 45, t. 272 (1832).

A large climbing shrub; branches with black bark; branchlets greyish-brown, lenticellate, striate when dry; innovations puberulous. *Leaves* thinly coriaceous, membranous when young; elliptic, elliptic-oblong or oblanceolate, sharply and somewhat abruptly acuminate at apex, cuneate at base; both surfaces glabrous and somewhat shining when dry, the upper dark olivaceous-brown, the lower bright reddish-brown; margins cartilaginous, recurved, almost revolute; 4 to 6 in. long, 1.25 to 2 in. broad; midrib slender, prominent, red; main nerves 20 to 30 pairs, very slender, the middle ones at from 70\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 with the midrib, the upper at a less angle, the lower nearly or quite at right angles, straight to near the margin where they branch and curve slightly, prominent beneath, less so above; secondary nerves occasional, between and similar to the main-nerves; reticulations invisible except in very young leaves; petiole 5 to 6 in. long, channelled above. *Cymes* axillary, about twice as long as the petioles, densely crowded with many short few-flowered branches, rusty-puberulous like the calyx, pedicels and bracteoles; bracteoles ovate, acute, deciduous; pedicels 0.5 to 1 in. long; buds oblong-clavate, elongate, reaching nearly 1 inch; flowers white. *Calyx* campanulate; lobes ovate, obtuse, ciliate, 1 in. long. *Corolla*-tube narrowly cylindric with a nearly globular dilatation close above the base and opposite the stamens,\n\u00b74 in. long, villous within above the stamens; lobes \u00b74 to \u00b77 in. long, oblong-falcate, obtuse.

Sumatra (van Romburgh 469).\n\nCurtis says that the caoutchouc of this species is of no use. Wray No. 3773 is a specimen in young fruit; the fruits terminal! but otherwise like other specimens. The apparently terminal fruits probably arose from the cymes of the uppermost axils, the much enlarged pedicels having absorbed the rest of the small inflorescence or caused it to fall. The Sumatra specimen has a less puberulous inflorescence, but otherwise does not seem to differ.\n\n8. Willughbeia flavescens, Dyer in Herb. Kew.; Hook. f. Fl. Br. Ind. III. 625 (1882).

Ovary conoidal, glabrous, style slender, obconic above; stigma conical. Berry not known.\nPerak: on Government Hill and West Hill, Curtis 1040, 1121, 3086.\n\nThe same number, \"Curtis 1040,\" is quoted by D. Oliver in Hook. Icon. t. 1758 (1888) as the type of Melodinus coriaceus, Oliver, but all our specimens have more or less the imbricated bracteoles of Chilocarpus, and are destitute of scales in the throat of the corolla, or of laciniae to its lobes. A comparison of the specimens of Melodinus coriaceus in the Kew Herbarium shows clearly that two species have been given the same number, but that the resemblance is superficial only. The real M. coriaceus has the leaves pale brown, and not black, when dry.\n\n7. Chilocarpus minutiflorus, King & Gamble, n. sp.

There is in the Kew Herbarium a species (unnamed) which approaches very near to this. It has been sent from the Khasia Hills (*Hook. f. and Th.*); from Manipur (*Watt* 7272); and from Yunan (*Henry* 12136). When it comes to be described with full material, it is by no means unlikely that the two will be found to require a new genus.\n\n### 30. *Epigynum*, Wight.\n\nClimbing shrubs. *Leaves* opposite, penninerved, the nerves arching. *Flowers* canescent-tomentose, in dense subcapitate corymbose or panicle leafy cymes at the ends of the branches. *Calyx* small, 5-fid; the lobes narrow, eglandular or with few glands. *Corolla* hypocrateriform; the tube elongate, dilated opposite the stamens; the throat villous, without scales; lobes 5, twisted to the left or nearly erect, overlapping to the right. *Stamens* inserted below the middle of the tube, included; filaments short; anthers linear-sagittate, acuminate, connivent around the stigma and hardly adhering to it; cells spurred at the base. *Disk* fleshy, 5-lobed, lining the calyx-tube. *Ovary* of 2 distinct carpels, dorsally adnate to the disk and surmounted by it; style filiform; stigma cylindric, with annular base and conical tip; ovules many in each carpel. *Fruit* of two linear terete distinct follicular mericarps sometimes torulose. *Seeds* elongate, compressed, broad at the tip and crowned with a thick coma of silky hairs; *testa* very thin; *albumen* moderate or scanty; *cotyledons* oblong, narrow, foliaceous; *radicle* short, superior.\u2014**Distrib.** Malay Peninsula and Archipelago; about 4 to 5 species.\n\nLeaves elliptic; main nerves 6 to 7 pairs, straight at first:\u2014\n\nLeaves glabrous beneath except for tufts in the nerve-axils; corolla-tube grey-tomentose without .. .. .. 1. *E. perakensis*.\n\nLeaves tomentose beneath, not tufted in the nerve-axils; corolla-tube tawny-tomentose without .. .. 2. *E.

Stamens 5, inserted at or near the base of the corolla and alternate with its lobes, rarely higher up; filaments some-\ntimes free, more usually connate in a tube around the ovary, forming with the anthers and their terminal appendages a staminal column, with the apex often united to the dilated part of the style, usually with more or less fleshy processes on the back forming a staminal corona; anthers free or united to the dilated part of the style, 2-celled; the cells dehiscing by apical longitudinal or transverse slits; the margins of the anthers or their basal prolongations below the cells more or less horny and wing-like (the anther-wings), usually projecting outwards; the adjacent wings of each pair of anthers nearly meeting and forming between them very narrow fissures leading to the stigmatic cavities; connectives of the anthers often produced into membranous rarely fleshy or inflated terminal appendages which are sometimes connate; pollen-contents of each anther-cell granular or united into one or two waxy masses (pollen-masses) formed of an indefinite number of pollen-grains and attached in pairs or in fours, sometimes directly but more usually by means of arm-like caudicles to each of the 5 small, usually horny, turgid or bilobed pollen-carriers, which rest one on each of the 5 angles of the dilated part of the style, the whole forming the pollinia, the masses attached to each pollen-carrier always being derived from the cells of two different but adjacent anthers; when granular, each granule is formed of about 4 pollen-grains united together, and, on the dehiscence of the anthers, the whole is loosely contained in the horny spoon-, trumpet-, or trowel-like or bifid appendicle tapering downwards into a short or long caudicle attached to a soft (adhesive?) pollen-carrier gland.\n\nOvary superior, of 2 one-celled, many-ovuled, carpels, free below; the styles united above and dilated into a pentagonal disk (style-apex) which is flat or depressed in the centre, with or without a conical or otherwise shaped tip, and bears on its angles the pollen-carriers and immediately beneath them, behind the fissures between the anther-wings, the 5 stigmatic cavities; ovules usually numerous, rarely few or solitary, anatropous, pendulous, imbricate in several series on the projecting placenta. Fruit of 2 (or 1 by suppression) divaricate or parallel follicular mericarps, dehiscing by the ventral suture and usually liberating the placenta; pericarp usually smooth, sometimes echinate or winged. Seeds usually flat, sometimes ovoid or cylindric, usually with a broad or narrow margin, generally crowned with a coma of long silky hairs, sometimes fringed, sometimes without any tuft; testa thin or thick; albumen usually thin, sometimes rather thick, sometimes none; embryo large, nearly or quite filling the seed; cotyledons flat; radicle usually cylindric, superior.\u2014DISTRIB. A large Family of more than 1800 species, widely distributed over tropical and subtropical, with a few in temperate, regions.\nAs in the Family Apocynaceae, in which we were much assisted by Dr. O. Stapf's account of it in the 'Flora of Tropical Africa,' Vol. IV. Sect. 1, so in Asclepiadaceae we have been indebted to that by Mr. N. E. Brown in the same work, which has helped us properly to understand the morphology of a very difficult but most interesting Family of plants.

The peduncles and branches of the cyme and the pedicels are stouter and longer and the corolla more fleshy. The anthers are similar, but the pollen-carrier appendicles are more obliquely funnel-shaped (see t. xxii. in Bl. Mus. Bot. Lugd.-Bat. I.). The only specimen in the Kew Herbarium is \"Coll. T. Lobb, India 1868,\" and may be possibly from the Peninsula. In the Calcutta Herbarium are specimens from Sumatra (*H. O.

It differs in the markedly pentagonal style-apex, the bearded anther appendages, and the spathulate not funnel-shaped appendicles of the pollen-carriers. *P. khasiana*, Kurz, Fl. Br. Ind.

Brown in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle,' appear to differ somewhat from the Malay Peninsula specimens in having larger leaves cordate at the base and rather larger flowers. But we fail to find any difference in the structure of the flowers. Another Java specimen (Curtis No. 61) which was sent to Messrs. Veitch & Co., agrees well with the Peninsular plants.\n\n3.

Br. Ind. says of the corolla, giving the corona-processes as \"white with pink at the junctures.\" Maingay (MS. Notes IV. p. 41) says, \"petals white, faintly greenish towards the tips, corona white.\" These remarks, for what seems clearly to be the same plant, explain the difference between Lindley's and Paxton's drawings alluded to in the Fl. Br. Ind. As remarked in Fl. Br. Ind., *H. cinnamonifolia*, Hook. Bot. Mag. 4347, from Java, \"has very similar flowers and leaves.\" But for the corolla being green and the corona purple in that fig., we should be inclined to place it under *H. parasitica*.\n\n15. *Hoya coriacea*, Blume Bijdr. 1063 (1826), and Rumph.

Herb. Amb. V. 473, t. 175, fig. 3. Beccari, in Malesia, II. 258, maintains Blume's genus *Conchophyllum*, characterized by the absence of a staminal corona.

CCCCIX. A small creeping epiphyte, trailing over and rooting on the stems and branches of trees; stems slender, smooth or papillose or with rounded warts; rootlets very numerous and spreading. Leaves fleshy, coriaceous when dry, sessile; orbicular, convex above, the margins broadly recurved, wrinkled above and with prominent large bullate protuberances, pitted below by the protuberances and minutely papillose, white when young, red when old; '5 to 1 in. in diam.; mid-rib and 1 to 2 pairs of branching nerves prominent beneath.

Perak: at 4000 to 4500 feet near Lar\u00fat, King's Collector 3840, 6905; at Gunong Ijuk, Scortechini 1185.\nThe chief peculiarity of this species is in its pollen-masses being elongate and having very small caudicles, and being therefore quite different from those of any other species we have examined. The Perak specimens have no flowers, and can therefore only be referred here tentatively, but we believe them to be correctly identified.\n\n5. **Dischidia Rafflesiana**, Wall. Pl. As. Rar.

Sykes Gamble, C.I.E., F.R.S., late of the Indian Forest Department.\n\nNo. 20.\n\nThe present Part contains the descriptions of three Families, No. 89 Acanthaceae, which was only finished by the late Mr. C. B. Clarke, F.R.S., just before his lamented death in August, 1906, and Nos. 91 Labiatae and 92 Plantaginaceae, which have been done by Lt.-Col. Prain, C.I.E., F.R.S., Director of the Royal Gardens, Kew.\n\nThe 3 Families comprise 54 genera and 166 species. In the Acanthaceae there are 35 genera and 134 species, of which 5 genera and 68 species are new. In the Labiatae the genera are 18 and the species 31, one genus being newly described. But it is worthy of note that of the 31 species only 16 are really native in the Malay Peninsula, the rest being introduced plants. One species only is endemic, Plectranthus Kunstleri, Prain. In Plantaginaceae there is merely one genus containing one species, an introduced weed.\n\nIt may here be usefully recorded that, in addition to his work on the Malay Peninsula Acanthaceae herein given, the late Mr. Clarke also prepared an account of the species of the Malay Archipelago, which will shortly be published in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society.'\n\nPart No. 21, which will contain two Families, No. 86 Gesneraceae and No. 90 Verbenaceae, and thus complete the Gamopetalae, may be expected to issue about the New Year.\nFamily LXXXIX.\u2014ACANTHACE\u00c6.\n\n[By C. B. Clarke.]\n\nHerbs or shrubs, or twining plants (Thunbergia). Leaves opposite, often unequal, in Polytrema sometimes pseudalate; stipules 0. Inflorescence various; spikes strobilate or heads or cymose or flowers solitary; bracts and prophylla large, small or 0. Flowers 2-sexual, irregular. Calyx inferior; segments 5 or 4, nearly free or more or less united. Corolla gamopetalous; tube campanulate or linear; limb 2-lipped or 5-lobed, more or less 1-sided. Stamens on the corolla 4 didynamous, or 2 (with or without rudiments); anther-cells 2 or 1; pollen ellipsoid (then usually ribbed or banded longitudinally) or globose (then often honeycombed or echinulate). Ovary superior, 2-celled; ovules 2 to 1, or several, superimposed in vertical rows (or 2 collateral in Thunbergia); style long, simple, minutely 2-fid. Capsule loculicidal, often elastically dehiscent; seeds usually nearly as many as the ovules, held up on rigid curved retinacula (outgrowths of the funicle); albumen 0.\u2014Distrib. Species 2000, throughout the warmer parts of the world.\n\nThis Family is specially characterized by the retinacula and the seeds placed in a vertical line; this character fails in the first two Subfamilies. The plants of Subfamily II. Nelsonioide\u00e6 are frequently mistaken for those of Scrophulariace\u00e6, from which they differ by the seeds being superimposed vertically.\n\nConspectus of the Subfamilies, Tribes, and Genera.\n\nSubfamily I. Thunbergioide\u00e6. Seeds 4 to 2 in the capsule without retinacula. Twiners\n\nSubfamily II. Nelsonioide\u00e6. Seeds 8 to 16, vertically superimposed in 2 rows in the capsule on small soft papill\u00e6 (not on hard curved retinacula). Herbs small or of very moderate size:\n\nStamens 2\n\nStamens 4:\n\nFlowers in spikes, racemes, or panicles\n\nFlowers axillary\n\nSubfamily III. Ruellioide\u00e6. Retinacula present.

IX. 452, in note (1867)), a weak Philippine species. *E. elongata*, Miquel (Fl. Ind. Bat. II. 775), was (so Miquel says) = *E. Griffithiana*, T. Anders.; and, from Miquel's description, it must have been largely (or wholly) that species. As to *E. subpaniculata*, Hassk. (Retzia I. 77 (1855)), there are now here examples both of the Salak wild plant and of that cultivated at Buitenzorg; they may be varieties of *E. elongata*, Nees, but do not match it. The above description of *E. elongata*, Nees, is wholly from the Java type plant; no example from Penang has been seen.\n\n10. **Staurogyne lasiobotrys**, O.

Clarke, n. sp. Stem, leaves and inflorescence with brown hairs. Leaves 1\u00b75 by \u00b74 in., oblong, obscurely obovate; tip triangular; base narrowed; nerves beneath conspicuous; petiole, even in the lower leaves, 0 or hardly any; otherwise as H. salicifolia.\n\nMalacca: Harvey.\n\nThis resembles some forms of H. undulata, Blume, in which, however, the brown hairs are not present, and the lower leaves are petioled.\n\n8. Hygrophila spinosa, T. Anders. in Thwaites Enum. Pl. Zeyl. 225 (1864). Stems stout, 2 to 5 ft. high. Leaves 3 to 6 in. long, lan-\nceolate to linear, hispid, sessile.

Brasil, IX. 22 (1847)), is a totally different plant; for this cause T. Anderson, when he transferred Asteracantha longifolia to Hygrophila, gave it the new name H. spinosa. Nevertheless, some botanists call the Asiatic Asteracantha by the name H. longifolia, thereby causing great confusion.\n\n6. NOMAPHILA, Blume.\n\nInflorescence in numerous 1-sided, open, axillary racemes shorter than the leaves. Bract (and prophylla) inconspicuous, linear, or wanting. Calyx even in the bud deeply divided (two-thirds or three-fourths of the way down) into 5 lobes. Otherwise as Hygrophila.\u2014Species 14, viz. 8 in South-east Asia, very closely allied, and 6 in Tropical Africa.\n\nThis genus is in essentials Hygrophila, and is sunk in Hygrophila by both Lindau and Burkill, but is easily distinguished from it, whether estimated a genus or a subgenus.\n\n1. NOMAPHILA STRICTA, Nees in DC. Prodr. XI. 84 (1847). Nearly glabrous, drying a black-green. Stems 3 ft. Leaves: blade 3 to 4\u00b75 in. long, narrowly elliptic, attenuate at either end; midrib beneath with fine patent hairs; petioles up to 2 to 3 in. long. Corymbs in many axils, 2 to 4 in. in diam., recurved in fruit; peduncles less than 1 in. long; pedicels nearly glabrous; bract and prophylla linear, inconspicuous or 0. Calyx \u00b725 to \u00b735 in. long, divided nearly to the base; segments 5, linear, glabrous or minutely scabrous or hispid (not viscid or glandular-hairy). Corolla \u00b75 in. long or more, bright blue. Filaments glabrous; pollen 20 \u03bc in diam., globose, with 12 to 16 longitudinal ribs. Ovary and style pubescent. Capsule \u00b735 to \u00b76 in. long;\nseeds small, ovoid, flattened, brown, shaggy on the margin, with hygroscopic hairs. C. B. Clarke in Hook. f. Fl. Br. Ind.

Prodr. XI. 722, united this species to *N. corymbosa*, Blume Bijdr. 804 (1825); the latter is (when dried) a smoky grey-green; the pedicels and calyx have viscous (and often glandular) hairs. The two are very close together.\n\n2. **Nomaphila minor**, C. B. Clarke, n. sp. Smaller in all its parts than *N. stricta*. *Leaves*: lamina scarcely 2 in. long. *Corymb*-branches slender, glabrate. *Corolla* \u00b725 to \u00b735 in. long. *Anthers* and pollen smaller. *Capsule* \u00b725 to \u00b735 in. long. *N. stricta (partim)*, C. B. Clarke in Hook. f. Fl. Br. Ind. IV. 409. *Ruellia? paniculata*, Herb. Rottler.\n\n**Perak**: Scortechini 1374.\u2014The example in Herb. Rottler is without locality.\n\n7. **Ruellia**, Linn.\n\nHerbs or undershrubs. *Leaves* opposite, subequal, entire; upper surface with rhaphides. *Flowers* axillary (or paniced in American species); bract 0; prophylla spathulate or subfoliaceous, exceeding the calyx. *Calyx* deeply 5-fid; segments subequal, linear. *Corolla* tubular-ventricose, blue to white; lobes rounded, twisted to the left in the bud. *Stamens* 4, didynamous; filaments glabrous; anthers of 2 oblong, subequal, parallel, muticous, glabrous cells; pollen globose, large (30 to 50 \u03bc in diam.), honeycombed. *Ovary* glabrous; ovules 3 to 10 in each cell; style hairy, with one linear branch, the other obsolete. *Capsule* clavate; base solid, sterile; top ellipsoid or subglobose, with 6 or more close-packed seeds; retinacula large, hooked. *Seeds* ovoid, flattened, hygroscopically shaggy on margin.\u2014Species 150 (Bentham) or 200 (Lindau), in the warmer parts of the world, more abundant in America.\n\nBut a considerable number of the species reckoned in *Ruellia* by Lindau have not \"wabenpollen\" (honeycombed pollen), but \"stachelpollen\" (prickly pollen); so that the species left in *Ruellia* may not be more than 120 to 150, and possibly may be much fewer, if (as in the above diagnosis) the genus is restricted to those plants which have a stalked clavate capsule [*Dipteracanthus* (genus), Nees].\n\n1. **Ruellia repens**, Linn. Mant. 89 (1767) (*not of Burm.*). Sparingly hairy or glabrate. *Stem* 6 to 20 in., weak, often much branched.\nLeaves 1 by '35 to '5 in., lanceolate, nearly always narrowed at the base, entire; upper surface sprinkled with raphides; petiole '125 to '2 in. Flowers axillary, mostly solitary; bract 0; prophylla spathulate or foliaceous, exceeding the calyx. Calyx '2 in. long, divided nearly to the base into 5 subequal linear segments. Corolla '75 in. long. Capsule '5 in. long, contracted, sterile at the base; the seeds (usually 5 to 8) imbricated near the top. Blume Bijdr. 794; T. Anders. in Journ. Linn. Soc. IX. 460 (1867); C. B.

A common Malay plant, extending to Tenasserim on one side, to China and the Philippines on the other.\n\nThe plate of Burmann (Fl. Ind. t. 41, fig. 1) is good, and represents a plant not of the genus Ruellia. In the Addit. to Mant. 515 (1771), Linn\u00e6us says his Ruellia repens was Burmann, t. 41, fig. 1; it may be more correct to call this species R. repens, Blume. Nees, in DC. Prodr. XI. 370, says his Rostellularia sarmentosa had the capsule \"4-seeded from the base,\" so that there is probably some error in the Rostellularia sarmentosa issued from Buitenzorg.\n\nVar. \u03b2 linearis, C. B. Clarke. Leaves 2\u00b725 by '2 to '25 in.\n\nPahang: Ridley 2182. Ipoh: Deschamps.\n\nRuellia prostrata, Lam. Encycl. VI. 349 (cf. Hook. f. Fl. Br. Ind. IV. 411), differs a little from R. repens, Linn., by having larger flowers and capsules, and the leaves usually rather larger. In the Kedah example, Ridley, n. 5750, the flowers are more than 1 in. long, and the capsules more than '75 in. long; and Ridley has issued it as \"R. prostrata\"; the habit and small leaves are typical R. repens.\n\n[R. angustiflora, Benth. & Hook. f. Gen. Pl. II. 1079 (R. angustifolia, Lindau in Engl. & Prantl Pflanzenfam.

Clarke, n. gen.\n\nInflorescence a terminal, peduncled, compound, many-flowered, nearly glabrous, subebracteate-linear panicle (8 to 12 by \u00b775 in.); otherwise as *Hemigraphis*.\n\nThis genus agrees in character very closely with the Tropical African genera *Mellera* and *Paulo-Wilhelmia*, but the habit and hairs are very different.\n1. **Stenothyrsus Ridleyi**, C. B. Clarke, n. sp. *Upper leaf*: blade up to 8 by 2 in., obovate-lanceolate, acuminate at either end, acute, nearly glabrous, entire, reticulate, full of rhaphides; main nerves 12 pair, oblique; petiole 1-5 in. long. *Peduncle* 1 to 4 in.; thyrsus interrupted at base, of 20 to 50 flowers, clustered in very small opposite cymes; bracts inconspicuous, setaceous. *Calyx* 1.75 in. long; sepals 5, linear, full of rhaphides. *Corolla* 1 to 1.5 in. long, blue; tube cylindric, narrow-campanulate in the upper half, minutely hairy. *Stamens* 4, subsimilar; filaments glabrous, connected in pairs; anthers long, of 2 linear-oblong cells at equal height, pubescent, minutely 1- to 2-mucronate at the base, connective mucronate at tip; pollen globose, 40 \u03bc in diam., longitudinally 20-ribbed. *Style* thinly hairy, with one oblong-linear and one suppressed branch. *Capsule* (not ripe) narrowly ellipsoid, glabrate, seed-bearing from the base, with eight ovate flattened seeds.\n\n**Perak**: Tambun Loh, Ridley 9770; Ipoh, limestone rocks, Curtis 3149.\n\nRidley placed this plant close to *Strobilanthes*; the numerous capsules are all 8-seeded. There are, on one sheet, three thyrsi 8 to 12 by 1 in., and one thyrsus reduced (apparently accidentally) to a dense head.\n\n---\n\n10. **Hemigraphis**, Nees.\n\nHerbs or undershrubs. *Leaves* opposite, subequal, often crenate, sometimes lobed; upper surface with rhaphides, which are sometimes altogether obscure. *Flowers* in terminal spikes, or rarely in 1- to 3-flowered small heads on axillary peduncles; bract usually exceeding the calyx, lanceolate or ovate; prophylla linear, short or 0. *Calyx* deeply 5-fid; segments lanceolate-linear or linear, subequal. *Corolla* tubular-campanulate, blue to white; lobes rounded, twisted in the bud. *Stamens* 4, didynamous; anthers of 2 oblong, subequal, parallel, mutious, glabrous cells; filaments glabrous, or the 2 longer with many long hairs; pollen rather large, from short-ellipsoid to oblong-ellipsoid; the 12 to 16 longitudinal ribs reaching to the poles; stipples 2. *Ovary* oblong, with 6 to 12 ovules, usually hairy at tip; style shortly hairy at base; stigma of one elongate and one suppressed lobe. *Capsule* oblong or linear-obvoid, slightly flattened, hardly stalked; seeds 6 to 12, ovoid, flattened, with much hygroscopic hair on the margin.\u2014Species 30 perhaps, in South-east Asia and Polynesia.\n\nTo this genus belong *Ruellia repanda*, Linn.; *R.

Siam.\n\nThis species, abundant in its area, is characterized by the uniform inflorescence, and is always collected in flower. *E. palatiferum*, Bot. Mag. t. 5957, of which (in Fl. Br. Ind. IV. 498) I referred one piece to *E. malaccense*, is undoubtedly all true *E. palatiferum*, of which it has the characteristic inflorescence; the colour of the flowers varies from pale pink to bluish purple in both species. The name *E. erectum*, T. Anders., is older than *E. malaccense*, but was published without one word of description.\n\n8. **Eranthemum kingii**, C. B. Clarke, n. sp. Branches elongate, with long internodes. Leaves elliptic, shortly acuminate at the tip, hardly acuminate at the base, paler beneath when dry. Spikes solitary, 2 to 4 in. long, dense; the lower axils with 1 to 3 flowers in each axil. Corolla white; tube 1\u00b7125 in. long. Otherwise as *E. malaccense*, C. B. Clarke.\n\nJohore: Jaffaria, King. Singapore: Hullett 810.\nThe leaves of this species resemble those of *E. album*, Nees, while the spikes resemble those of *E. malaccense*, but are slightly more pubescent, and the corolla is white.\n\n9. **Eranthemum acuminatissimum**, Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. II. 835 (1856). Erect, nearly glabrous. *Leaves*: blade 8\u00b75 by 2 in., acuminate-attenuate at either end; nerves 8 pair, oblique; rhaphides on the upper surface numerous, very short; petioles 1 in. *Spikes* 1 to 3, 7 to 10 in. long, many-flowered, the lower clusters half-whorled, 5 to 1 in. apart, with 5 to 10 flowers to the whorl; the upper whorls fewer-flowered, coalescent; bracts 2 in. long, lanceolate-linear. *Sepals* 2 in. long, nearly linear, ultimately nearly glabrous. *Corolla* white, with one segment purple-spotted; tube 1\u00b725 in. long. *Stamens* of the genus. *Capsule* 1\u00b725 in. long, with 4 seeds in the upper part, slightly constricted between the seeds. *E.

Ridley, l. c., thinks the Singapore collection was probably a garden escape.\n\nThe \"type\" of *E. acuminatissimum*, Miquel, from Utrecht, proves identical with the *E. Andersoni*, Masters. It was, perhaps, *E. viscidum* \u03b2 *acuminatissimum*, Hassk. Hort. Bogor. p. 151, but not *E. viscidum* \u03b2 Blume. The *E. Blumei*, Miq. (Fl. Ind. Bat. II. 836) is before me, and very closely allied to *E. acuminatissimum*, but has (as Miquel says) smaller leaves, smaller bracts, and smaller calyx.\n\n10. **Eranthemum Teijsmanni**, T. Anders. in Journ. Agri.-Hort. Soc. Ind. new ser. I. 285 (1868). \"A shrubby creeper, 8 to 12 ft. long\" (King's Collector). *Branches* 25 in. in diam., with numerous secondary branches springing at a right angle. *Leaves*: blade 6 by 2 in., broad-oblong, acuminate; nerves 6 pair; base often rounded or truncate, but on the same branch sometimes cuneate-oblique; petioles 25 to 1\u00b725 in. long. *Inflorescence* a narrow, many-flowered panicle rarely so much as 6 in. long; the lower branches hardly 1\u00b775 in. long, carrying small cymes (almost clusters) of flowers. *Calyx* and *corolla* (white tinged blue) as of *E. acuminatissimum*, Miq. *E.

Anderson's whole diagnosis of his E. Teijsmanni is \"a fine species with a straggling habit\"; and I have no authentic specimen; the name is disposable. Whether this was the imperfectly known E. graciliflorum, Nees (Wall. Pl. As. Rar. V. 3, 107); from Penang I cannot say; it is not the E. graciliflorum of Madura (Java) distributed from the Buitenzorg Garden. This species resembles much E. hirtipistillum (collected at the same locality), but the corolla-tube is here 1\u00b73 to 1\u00b75 in. long.\n\n25. Clinacanthus, Nees.\n\nA rambling shrub. Flowers conspicuous, in small drooping cymes at the ends of the branches; bracts and prophylla small, linear. Sepals 5, equal, linear. Corolla-tube narrow, funnel-shaped; limb 2-lipped. Stamens 2; anthers of 1 cell, oblong, muticous; pollen ellipsoid, with 2 longitudinal bands. Style very shortly 2-fid. Capsule stalked, 4-seeded. Only 1 species.\n\n1. Clinacanthus Burmanni, N\u00e9es in DC. Prodr. X. 511 (1847). Stems round.

Leaves opposite, subequal or sometimes pseud-alternate, entire or undulate. Inflorescence various in the different sections, from strobilate spikes to panicles with the flowers all pedicelled; bracts and prophylla small, linear, sometimes lanceolate, or in the strobilate spikes round, large, imbricate (these large round bracts in many cases cover more than one flower, and are then floral leaves). Calyx small, deeply 5-fid (4-fid in Sect. Rostellaria). Corolla-tube\nshorter (or scarcely longer) than the 2-lipped limb; segments imbricated (not twisted) in the bud. *Stamens* 2; anther-cells 2, one below the other, tailed; pollen ellipsoid, small, longitudinally ribbed beside the stipples. *Ovary* 4-celled; style shortly bifid. *Capsule* regularly dehiscent; 4-seeded (the placentae not springing elastically from the base of the capsule), stalked with the seeds in the top, or seed-bearing nearly from the base. *Seeds* ovoid, flattened, verrucose, subtubercular, glabrous (except in Sect. *Rhaphidospora*). \u2014 *DistriB.* Species 150, widely spread throughout the hot regions of the world.\n\nThis genus is only artificially separated from several others (as from *Leda Adhatoda*, *Ptyssiglottis*) by the white tail to the lower anther-cell. If this character be not regarded as of generic importance, the number of species may be 300, as in the arrangement by Lindau in Engl. & Prantl Pflanzenfam.\n\nSect. 1. *Bracteate*.

Leaves 6\u00b75 by 2\u00b725 in., elliptic-lanceolate, acuminate at tip, cuneate at base (but see the Varieties below), often undulate or obscurely crenate on the margin, with very small rhaphides on both surfaces; primary nerves 7 to 9 pairs, oblique; petioles \u00b75 to 1\u00b75 in. long; opposite pairs of leaves equal or rarely somewhat unequal. Peduncles terminal, penultimate, or axillary, 1 to 2 in. long, frequently 2 from one axil; spike 1 in. long, or lengthening to 1 to 4 in. long; bracts round, ovate, green, \u00b73 to \u00b735 in. long, shortly stalked, very caducous, nearly glabrous, but often with white bristles on the margin; with 1 (rarely 1 to 2) flower under each bract.

Peduncles '75 in. long; spikes 4 by 1\u00b725 in., slightly pubescent; bracts ovate or obovate, up to '6 in. long, subsessile, glabrate, imbricate, purple (Ridley), with 2 or 3 flowers under each. Calyx small, glabrate. Corolla white (Ridley). Capsule hardly '35 in. long, glabrate.\n\nSelangor: Ridley 7587.\n\nI have seen no flowers. This may be near the group of J. burmanica and J.

Neesiana* should be esteemed only a var. of *J. quadrifaria*.\n\n9. **Justicia henicophylla**, C. B. Clarke, n. sp. A herb, 1\u00b75 to 4 ft. high, nearly glabrous. Leaves apparently alternate, attaining 9 by 3\u00b75 in., often only half these dimensions, elliptic or ovate, acuminate, acute; base cuneate, not rarely unequal, with one side rounded or almost cordate; primary nerves 7 pairs; petioles 0 to 2\u00b75 in. long. Inflorescence of axillary peduncled cymes, sometimes small few-flowered, sometimes compound 40-flowered (but less than half the length of the leaf); bracts and prophylla minute. Sepals 5, linear, 1\u00b775 in. long, pubescent. Corolla a greenish cream-colour, the palate marked with rose-purple, 3\u00b75 in. in length, pubescent without; altogether as of a Justicia. Stamens 2; filaments glabrous; cells of anthers 2, ellipsoid, one (half its length) below the other with a white tail; pollen ellipsoid, 30 \u03bc long, with 2 stopples, and a longitudinal row of patches on either side of each stopple. Style hairy, shortly 2-fid at top. Capsule 7 in. long, glabrate; base cylindric, with 4 seeds in the upper (widened) part; seeds glabrous, granular-scabrid.\n\nThe numerous examples here collected may include more species than one; some (King\u2019s Collector 2189, Curtis 1342) have dried green; others (Wray and Scortechini) have dried red tinged black.

B. Clarke, n. sp. A much-branched shrub, 2 to 4 ft. high, nearly glabrous. Leaves opposite, rarely subequal, one of each pair often wanting or less than 1\u00b725 in. long; nearly sessile, 1-sided, curved, shining, 4 by 1\u00b725 in. long, acuminate, acute, minutely scabrous on the midrib beneath. Inflorescence of peduncled, axillary, short cymes. Sepals 1\u00b725 in. long, lanceolate, pube-\nscent. Stamens 2; one anther-cell below the other, white-tailed.

Shrub, 2 to 3 ft. high, with hairy stem. Leaves all alternate (*i.e.* one of each pair '1 in. long, early deciduous); lamina ovate, oblique, acute, 7 by 3\u00b75 in., very unequal at the base; primary nerves 8 to 9 pairs, hairy on the under side of the leaf; petioles '1 to '25 in. long. Inflorescence of small, short-peduncled, pubescent, axillary, few-flowered cymes; bracts and prophylla inconspicuous. Capsule '7 in. long, hairy, cylindric at base, with 4 seeds at the top.\n\n**Perak:** alt. 500 to 700 ft., *King's Collector* 10680.\n\nThe corolla has not been seen. This can hardly be a species of *Hallieracantha*, as the cyme is too open and the calyx too small for that genus.\n\n12. **Justicia otophora**, C. B. Clarke, n. sp. Nearly glabrous. Branches slender, round, zigzag. Leaves sessile, one of each pair reduced to an ovate persistent ear '25 to '35 in. long; the other 4\u00b75 by 1\u00b735 in., elliptic; base unequal, rounded on one side; tip caudate-ligulate. Peduncles '5 to 1 in. long, axillary, carrying small few-flowered cymes. Sepals '175 in. long, linear-lanceolate, nearly glabrous. Capsule '7 in. long, glabrate, cylindric at the base, with 4 seeds in the top.\n\n**Perak:** Scortechini.\n\nThe anther-tails have not been seen; it is inferred from the small calyx and the peduncled cymes that the genus is *Justicia* (alternate-leaved section), and not *Hallieracantha*.\n\n13. **Justicia Gendarussa**, Linn. f. Suppl. 85 (1781). Erect, 2 to 4 ft. high. Leaves 4 by '75 in., lanceolate, glabrous, entire or undulate; petioles '25 in. long.

No complete specimens have been sent from Perak, but Wray records the species, under the name \"Ruku,\" as an adulterant of Patchouli. \"Ruku\" is, however, the Malay name for Hyptis graveolens, which is one of the usual adulterants of Patchouli leaves, though the writer finds that samples of \"Ruku\" do contain, mixed with the leaves and calyces of Hyptis graveolens, calyces of O. Basilicum. The particular variety met with in these samples being var. pilosum, there is just a possibility that in Perak this may sometimes occur as an escape from cultivation.\n\n3. Ocimum gratissimum, Linn. Sp. Pl. 1197 (1753). A shrubby, much-branched perennial, 4 to 6 ft. high, woody at the base. Stems glabrous; young branches pubescent.

America, from Brazil to Mexico; Tropical Africa and the Malay Archipelago, introduced.\n\nHyptis capitata, Jacq., a species in habit resembling H. brevipes, is frequently met with in gardens in S.E. Asia. It sometimes occurs spontaneously in waste places in India, and appears to have become established in the Philippines and in Formosa. The\npossibility of its occurrence in our area should therefore be kept in mind. It is readily distinguished from *H. brevipes* by its much larger capitula, which reach .75 in. across, and by its calyx-teeth being shorter than the tube. There is nothing in the description of the mysterious *Leucas globulifera* (Hassk. Cat. Hort. Bogor. alt. 133), which finds a place in various works of reference and which is obviously not a *Leucas*, to prevent it from having been *Hyptis capitata* in cultivation, as Hasskarl says, at Buitenzorg. Hasskarl's small 2-fid upper lip may stand for the two upper corolla-lobes, the lateral lobes of the lower lip being the two lateral corolla-lobes; the concave mid-lobe, largest of the three in what Hasskarl terms the lower lip, explains itself. Every other character agrees with *Hyptis capitata*, and the combination of characters will fit no other Labiate known to the writer as likely to be in cultivation in Java when Hasskarl wrote.\n\n2. **Hyptis suaveolens**, Poit.

Cultivated only, in our area.\u2014**Distrib.** Philippines; where, according to Loher, it occurs only in gardens.\n\nThis plant seems to flower not infrequently in the Philippines; there are specimens from thence at Kew collected both by Vidal and by Loher. So far as is known, it has flowered only three times in Europe: once in France, recorded by Pelletier (1844); once in Italy, recorded by Tenore (1847); once in England, recorded by Sir W. J. Hooker (1849): Hooker's plant was obtained from Tenore. No flowering specimen has ever been communicated from our area where, according to Wray and Curtis, it is extensively cultivated by Chinese settlers. In the Royal Botanic Garden at Calcutta the plant has been in continuous cultivation since 1834, when Wallich first obtained it from Penang; at Saharanpur, whence it was distributed from the Calcutta Garden, it has also been long in cultivation. At Calcutta and at Saharanpur all attempts to induce the plant to flower have consistently failed.\n\nThis, which may be termed the Malayan, as opposed to the original or Indian Patchouli, is not known to be cultivated anywhere in India except in botanical gardens.\n\nThere are indications that a third kind of Patchouli plant, the Chinese Patchouli (*Microtoena cymosa*, Prain), had at one time been introduced, not impossibly by Chinese settlers, to Java. But its cultivation has not persisted in the Malayan Archipelago, and there is no indication that it was ever introduced to the Peninsula. The Chinese Patchouli seems at one time to have been cultivated to a considerable extent in North-eastern India, and to have competed in the Calcutta market with the Indian Patchouli (*Pogostemon Heyneanus*). Now, however, the Malayan Patchouli, the product of *Pogostemon Cablin*, appears to have so completely supplanted both the others that neither are offered for sale, and the cultivation of *Pogostemon Heyneanus* is restricted to native gardens in the Indian Peninsula, while that of *Microtoena cymosa* only lingers in a few native gardens in the Khasia Hills.\n\nIn commercial samples of the leaves of *Pogostemon Cablin*, various extraneous leaves are to be met with. The chief of these are leaves of *Hyptis suaveolens*, Poit., in our area known as \"Ruku,\" also leaves of *Urena lobata*, Linn., known in our area as \"Perpulut.\" With *Hyptis suaveolens*, and under the same name \"Ruku,\" are associated the leaves of *Ocimum Basilicum*, Linn., var. pilosum. These, however, are in much smaller quantity than those of the *Hyptis*.\n7. Dysophylla, Bl.\n\nHerbs. Leaves opposite or whorled.

G. parviflorum, though stated by Bentham, Miquel, and Hooker to occur in Penang, has never been met with in our area. The specimens on which the statement is based were collected by Wallich, who in 1828 issued them as the types (Lith. Cat. n. 2159-1) of his own species G. crinitum, to which they most undoubtedly belong. A year later Wallich referred these same specimens (as n. 2158-c) to his own G. parviflorum; this quite erroneous afterthought has been accepted by the three authors referred to.\n\n2.

Indo-China.\n\nThis species is very closely related to G. Scortechinii, from which it differs mainly in its rather smaller white flowers and its less hirsute or quite glabrous style. It has not yet been collected in any of the Malayan provinces, but having regard to the fact that G. Scortechinii extends northwards to Tenasserim, where G. oblongum is common, and thus invades the area in which G. oblongum occurs, it is not impossible that this species may yet be met with in the northern part of the Malayan Peninsula; it seems therefore advisable to give it a place in these Materials.\n\n5. Gomphostemma Curtisi, Prain Journ. As. Soc. Beng. LIX. ii. 315 (1890). A coarse perennial herb, 3 to 4 ft. high. Stems rather weak, flexuous, ascending, scabrid.

Sykes Gamble, C.I.E., F.R.S., late of the Indian Forest Department.\n\nNo. 21.\n\nThis Part contains two Families, No. 86 Gesneraceae and No. 90 Verbenaceae, and completes the account of the Gamopetalae. The account of the Gesneraceae was prepared by Mr. H. N. Ridley, F.R.S., Director of the Botanic Garden at Singapore, and was published in the 'Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1905.' The material used by him was that of the Herbaria of Singapore and Penang, together with that belonging to the Royal Botanic Garden of Calcutta, and chiefly got together by collectors employed by Sir George King, lent to Mr. Ridley for the purpose. The account in the 'Straits Journal' not being quite in the form used in the 'Materials,' published under the auspices of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, has been edited by Mr. Gamble, with the kind help of Lt.-Col. Prain, of Kew, but he has been careful to make no more formal alterations than could be helped; so that the work is one for which Mr. Ridley alone is responsible. Only numbers personally verified or quoted by Mr. Ridley have been entered under the different species. Mr. Ridley, who has sanctioned what has been done, has himself furnished a few notes and additions, among them being descriptions of 3 new species, one of them the representative of a new genus. The number of species of Gesneraceae herein described is 131, belonging to 20 genera, 1 genus and 2 species being new, besides 1 Sumatran species newly described.\nThe Verbenaceae have been done by Mr. Gamble. It comprises 15 genera and 72 species, of which 16 species are new to science. Two Malay Islands species are also described.\n\nIn accordance with the Rules adopted at the Vienna Conference, Latin diagnoses are appended to the new genus and the 3 new species of Gesneraceae, those for Verbenaceae have been published in the Kew Bulletin.\n\nFamily LXXXVI.\u2014GESNERACEAE.\n\nHerbs or shrubs, usually pubescent.

Unfortunately, there are no specimens in the herbaria at Kew or Calcutta, so we hesitate to alter the name. If the identification proves correct, it is Ridley's name that must take precedence. This is one of the species whose fistular stems contain ants' nests. *C. macrophyllum*, Hook. M8. in Herb.
