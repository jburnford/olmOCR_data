Joseph Edkins, D.D., Peking, Honorary Member of Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson has drawn attention to the mention of the ships of Ur in early inscriptions, and the connection of these very ancient vessels with those of Ethiopia. The Babylonian traders at a very remote period voyaged to India and Africa for gold and other articles to use in the arts and to supply the demand of markets.\u00b9 The Euphrates' banks were the ancient quays at which the primitive navigators loaded and unloaded their vessels. They proceeded by the Persian Gulf into the ocean, and there they were guided by landmarks and by the heavenly bodies. These voyages may have continued from the time when Ur was a great city, B.C. 2300, down to the period of the Persian empire, when Babylon began to decline. During all this period, as afterwards, the navigators of the Indian Ocean, whether Babylonian, Arabian, Ph\u0153nician, or Egyptian, were trading, aided by the monsoons, along the African and Asiatic coasts, and conveying knowledge from one country to another.\n\nThe Ph\u0153nicians and Greeks planted mercantile settlements in spots where they traded in the Mediterranean, and the Arabs have done the same in a thousand ports of India, Africa, and the islands and countries east of Ceylon. What we know to have taken place from the\n\n\u00b9 Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. i. pp. 101, 102. He cites Sir Henry Rawlinson in Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XXVII. p. 185.\ntime of the Caliphs downwards on the south coast of Asia in connection with Arabian trade would, for the same reasons, take place in the times of the more ancient traders before the Christian era. The mercantile colonists would take wives in the cities where they settled. The new generation that grew up would speak the language of the new country as well as that which was the mother-tongue of the trading colonists, and the way would in consequence be open for free communication of ideas. New facts and notions could, for example, be conveyed from Phoenicia, Arabia, Mesopotamia and Egypt, to India, Ceylon, and the islands and regions east of India. To give an example of this, it is found recorded in an old Chinese book on botany, written by a prefect of Canton in the fourth century, that several plants, such as Jessamine and Henna, were then growing at Canton, having been brought there by traders coming from Arabia and the Roman empire. The well-known \"Moli hwa,\" a species of jessamine, now used for scenting tea and snuff, is among these exotic plants. In the same book sugar is spoken of as a product of Cochin China known at Canton. It has now become a staple product of the provinces of Canton and Fukien. The Henna flower is now commonly used in North China for dyeing the finger-nails red. This custom is a favourite one among women. The plant was conveyed on merchant vessels fourteen hundred years ago by foreigners called Hu, here meaning Arabs, as is most probable. It is said to have been taken to Canton from the Roman empire Ta Tsin. Egypt, where it is indigenous, then belonged to that empire. The Chinese were able to obtain not only an African plant at that time, but to learn also the empire to which the country where the plant grew belonged, and this knowledge they could acquire because there was resident then in Canton a trading colony of Arabs. This was in the pagan times, before the age of Mahommed. The members of this colony, always spoken of by the Chinese simply as Hu or foreigners, would maintain Sabean worship, and they would be able to teach something of what the Arabs then\nknew of astronomy, but with it would be included the old Arab image worship.\n\nBefore proceeding farther, let me mention here that the Arab merchants of Canton included among them at the end of the sixth century the uncle of Mahommed. Hearing of his nephew's greatness as a prophet, he returned to Arabia. The prophet was dead. He asked what message his nephew had left for him. The reply was \"None.\" \"Then,\" said he, \"I shall return to China. If the prophet had wished me not to do so, he would have intimated his desire.\" He went back to China and died in Canton. He was buried in a mausoleum constructed during his lifetime, and still in existence. Later on in the Tang dynasty the Arabs in Canton became very numerous and dangerous. They are referred to in the narratives in Arabic compiled by two Mahommedan travellers and translated by Renaudot, in which they describe China and other countries visited by them in the ninth century.\n\nIt was by such mercantile settlements in seaport towns spread along the winding coast-line of Southern Asia, from Suez to Canton, that knowledge of various kinds could be very easily communicated from one country to another. This might happen at any time, from the beginning of ocean navigation in the third millennium before Christ, at the mouth of the Euphrates, down to modern days. This is the simplest way to account for the diffusion of the common arts and institutions and the common beliefs of the oriental nations. We speak of oriental magnificence, oriental imagery, oriental hospitality, oriental imagination, oriental costume. The reason why the word Oriental serves for China, India, Persia, and Arabia alike, is partly because the intercourse always maintained between these countries by sea has occasioned a considerable identity in customs, in thinking, and in religion.\n\nThe introduction of the art of writing into India needs for its explanation the agency of just such mercantile settlements along the coast of India as would necessarily exist there from the time of Solomon. The discussion of the\norigin of the Indian alphabet occupied two sittings of the Congress of Orientalists at Leyden in 1883, and was conducted throughout with great vigour and unflagging interest. The hypothesis which met with most acceptance was the Phoenician hypothesis. The Phoenician alphabet, as developed in South Arabia and preserved in the Himyaritic inscriptions, gave origin in the east to the Indian alphabet and in the west to the Ethiopic. The two most distant dependencies of the Persian empire came to have each an alphabet thus derived. This view seems to be more or less supported by Professor Weber, Dr. B\u00fchler, the Rev. Isaac Taylor, and the late Professor Lenormant, as well as by Mr. Cust, who so ably introduced the subject to the Congress. On the mode of introduction of the Semitic alphabet Mr. Cust said, \"Unquestionably the continuous existence of a commerce between Yemen and South India can be asserted from a very remote period, quite sufficient to meet all requirements.\" The Vattelutu alphabet, which has influenced the Tamil, was certainly, the same writer adds, like the Semitic alphabet in several points. The Phoenician hypothesis, as now maintained, singles out the sixth century before Christ as the period when the Indian writing was first used extensively.\n\nBut if the alphabetic writing then commonly used in Western Asia was introduced through the agency of mercantile colonies at places on the Indian coast as early as 600 years before Christ, may we not expect that other arts then existing and acquisitions in knowledge of various kinds would enter India in the same manner? The changes which took place in Hindu philosophy and those ideas of an extended kind on the outer world, on cosmogony, and on the future life, which began to appear in India after the Vedic period, may have been caused by the same maritime intercourse with Western Asia and Egypt. In China, from about the sixth century before Christ, somewhat similar changes occurred in cosmogony, in philosophy, and in cosmography, and the hypothesis of mercantile settlements in Cochin China would be very convenient as an aid to show\nwhat accessions of foreign knowledge were likely to have been made by China as the result of the ocean traffic which then existed in the Indian seas. Surely, while Chinese history was passing slowly through its successive revolutions in politics and national life, it was not unaffected by outer influences.\n\nIn Professor Max M\u00fcller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, the fact of an abrupt change in Hindu literature between the time of the Vedas and that of the Brahmanas is very distinctly pointed out. He says, \"There is throughout the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as such a complete misunderstanding of the original intention of the Vedic hymns, that we can hardly understand how such an estrangement could have taken place unless there had been at some time or other a sudden and violent break in the chain of tradition.\" In the days of intellectual weakness which then overtook the Hindu mind the same author shows how, for example, the pronoun kah in the Vedas became at a later period a god, and was worshipped. New gods were invented in profusion, and some of these new mythological personages overshadowed and supplanted the deities of the Vedic age. Monstrous cosmogonies were invented, and in the Buddhist books, as in the Puranas, an entirely new mode of describing the world is adopted, in which the ocean plays a very conspicuous part. In the Vishnu Purana it is said that \"the Supreme Being placed the earth on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters.\"\u00b9 \"The Puranas represent Mount Meru as in the centre of the earth, around which lies Jambudwipa, and the earth is itself supported by some animal.\"\u00b2 This animal is Makara, a marine monster. Otherwise a tortoise is represented as supporting the earth. A circular wall of rock or iron bounds the world. Within it are seven other concentric circles of rocks. Between each circle is a sea. Immense monsters swim in these seas. Into this new\n\n\u00b9 Quoted from Wilson's Vishnu Purana in Hardy's Manual of Buddhism.\n\u00b2 See in Hardy, p. 22.\nsystem of the world the sun, moon, and stars, together with the zodiac and the twenty-seven lunar mansions, made an entrance, and later the Ptolemaic system. All these ideas are very much of a foreign character, and while they may have reached India by land, it would seem that they were more likely to arrive by sea, because the mercantile colonies in the seaport towns of the Indian coast would furnish facilities for the ready transference of thought from foreign languages into the current speech of India.\n\nThe time when Babylonian astronomy, and cosmogony with the idea of vast seas, a central mountain, and a rocky limit to the earth, could be introduced to India by sea was possibly not earlier than B.C. 800, for that is the time when Professor Max M\u00fcller supposes the Rig Veda to have been completed. But the date when this new accession of knowledge of cosmogony from Babylon and of the metempsychosis from Egypt would not be later than the time of Buddha, for this great teacher found all India believing in the metempsychosis, which is not a Vedic doctrine: the focus of this foreign influence upon India was therefore in the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries. Late in the seventh century Babylon was powerful under Nabopolassar\u2014and Necho, whose ships circumnavigated Africa, was reigning in Egypt. The maritime prosperity of Babylon would be at its height at that time, and the Persian conquest by Cyrus of that city B.C. 538 would not diminish mercantile activity. In the sixth and seventh centuries Indian trade could not be other than highly flourishing. Babylonians, Arabs, and Phoenicians would be found residing on the Indian coast, when some political revolution brought the Sanskrit or Pali-speaking population of the north into that part of India. The same sort of agency which introduced the art of writing would also introduce the metempsychosis of Egypt, with the astronomy, the zodiac, and the cosmogony of Babylon. Probably it was not from one country only that India received these accessions of knowledge, for the Arabs believe in a vast rocky circle bounding the world, and forming\nthe outer rim of the ocean, as the Buddhists do, and they were always fond of the sea. The Hindus may have received this notion from them.\n\nThe result of these foreign influences was a complete remodelling of Hindu thought. The new leaven worked powerfully through the mass of Hindu society. The natural religion of the Vedas was exchanged for an extravagant mythology and a vastly extended universe. Native thinkers worked from new bases in constructing their systems. Philosophy became more refined, and the universe better understood, while the Babylonian division of time into weeks, and their mode of observing the heavenly bodies, came into general use in India. The reason why just about this time the various Hindu systems of philosophy sprang into life was that a new stimulus to the native intellect was imparted by the foreign ideas introduced just then along the coast from the sea, and in a less degree by the passes of the north-west. The reason why India became specially receptive of new ideas at the time when they were introduced would naturally be that then the Aryan population conquered the whole seacoast. I now proceed to speak of China.\n\nIt is perfectly possible that the art of writing may have been communicated to China from Mesopotamia about B.C. 2500 by the same ocean route which afterwards gave to India the Devanagari alphabet. But when ocean navigation first reached China, alphabets were unknown, and therefore Chinese writing is ideographic and phonetic only.\n\nThe changes that took place in China long afterwards, in the Chow dynasty, in literature and philosophy are also better explained by this hypothesis than by any other. Trading went on in the Indian Ocean, we must suppose, through the whole period of the early dynasties, from the time of the Emperor Hwang ti and of Yan and Shun, who were contemporary, or nearly so, with the King Uruk of the Cuneiform inscriptions. In their time the dominion of the Chinese extended towards the south far enough to admit of intercourse with Cochin China and Burma, and by this southern route the astronomical knowledge then acquired by the\nChinese would most easily arrive. In the twelfth century B.C. there was, as tradition shows, a large accession of new knowledge by this route. This was when Chow Kung was Prime Minister, and its effects are found in his writings and the institutions with which his name is associated. In the sixth century a distinct and remarkable change took place in Chinese literature.\n\nTo show the nature of this change in Chinese literature, I shall take some examples from Tso, the historian, and Lie tsze, the Tauist philosopher, the one illustrating the subject of astrology, and the other that of cosmography. Tso c'hieu ming, in his history, when he comes to the year B.C. 549, mentions that Jupiter, the \"year star,\" as he is called, ought to have been in Sagittarius, and Capricornus R.A. 280\u00b0 to 300\u00b0, or, as it is called, Sing ki, but had irregularly advanced to Aquarius or Hiuen Hiau. This is the first sign of the zodiac of twelve, and belongs to the month December. It is a bad omen that Jupiter should during this year enter the sign in which he should be next year. At the time there was no ice, the dark principle yin not being able to overcome the bright principle yang (warmth). It is the snake mounting the dragon. The dragon is the star group of the kingdoms Sung and Cheng. These two States, therefore, will suffer from famine. In explanation, it is said that the snake rules winter, and that Jupiter represents wood, which is symbolized by the blue dragon. When Jupiter wanders from his place into the winter region, the spring dragon is subject to the control of the winter snake. Further, the central star of winter is called H\u00fc, \"empty.\" Hiau also means \"waste.\" The countries affected, therefore, must suffer from emptiness and waste. There will certainly be famine.\n\nThere is a passage occurring under the year 564 which speaks of the people of the Sung country learning by the stars to foresee what heavenly retribution for crimes would happen (Legge's Ch'un T'sien, p. 489). The official director of fire, as folklore tells us, being meritorious, was sacrificed to, along with a star. Antares was the star chosen.\nIt is in the eastern quarter of the zodiac. But he was also worshipped with the willow, \u03b4 Hydrae. In the third month of spring Antares culminates at evening, and is then seen in the south. The people were ordered to begin to kindle fires when they saw it. In the third month of autumn (S\u00fc) Antares, or the \"star of great fire,\" disappears in the sun's rays. The people are then ordered to cease to kindle fires. The beak of the red bird is the group called the \"willow,\" and the heart is Antares. The name of the officer worshipped was Ot pak in the reign of Yau. He lived in Shang c'chieu (Shom k'u), and was the son of the Emperor Kau sin. He was sent to the place mentioned in order that he might there rule the constellation of which Antares is the largest star. By his ruling this star and sacrificing to it, the people were induced to keep strictly to the appointed times for lighting fires. It was in this way that Antares became the star of the Sung region in the east part of the province of Honan. The same care was taken to perform these sacrifices in the time of Ot pak's successors, and this worship of Antares came to be the regular duty of the city called Shang c'chieu, and was one of the large group of facts and observances which preserved the memory of the Shang dynasty. What the result was is seen in the historian's further remark that the Shang people learned to look upon fire as the probable cause of any misfortune into which they fell. From this circumstance it came to be said that they knew that the calamity of fire came from heaven, or must be regarded as divinely retributive. When we come to the year 540, we learn from Tso c'chieu ming further particulars respecting Ot pak. (They are found in Legge, p. 580.) The marquis who ruled Tsin (the modern Shansi) was ill, and consulted the diviners, who, probably by the use of the tortoise in divination, learned that the illness was caused by two spirits named Sh\u012b c'hen and T'ai t'ai, who were supposed to have entered the sick nobleman's body or remained near him. But the diviners did not know who they were. Tsze c'han said that the Emperor Kau sin had two sons, Ot pak and Sh\u012b chen. The brothers not agreeing together, the Emperor Yau sent Ot pak to live\nin Shang c'chieu, there to preside over the worship of the star Ch'en (Ta hwo) or Antares. Thus this star became the patron star of the Shang people. At the same time Shi chen was removed to Ta hia to preside over the star Shen, the \"belt of Orion.\" This place was Tsin yang, now embraced in Tai yuen fu, capital of the province of Shansi: eventually in the Cheu dynasty this star Shen became the recognized patron of Tsin.\n\nDr. Gustave Schlegel, in his Uranographie Chinoise, rightly regarded these stories as fables. They are introduced into the history through the love of the author for folklore. This folklore is for research very valuable, as helping us to trace out the history of astrology. The worship of stars by particular cities was in full use at least five centuries and a half before Christ. At that time the legends were so well established in popular faith that they may well have been some centuries old. These instances show what stories of an astrological nature prevailed at that time in regard to some cities in Honan and Shansi. Similar legends would exist in other cities. The following particulars refer to T'ai t'ai, the other spirit supposed to have caused an illness to the nobleman above mentioned.\n\nT'ai t'ai and Yun ke were the sons of Hiuen ming shi, director of water, who was descended from Shau hau, an ancient emperor. T'ai t'ai cleared the channel of the Fen river, which flows through Shansi into the Yellow River and also deepened the Tau river. In consequence he was made by the Emperor Chwen h\u00fc superintending baron to the Fen chwen region. Sacrifices were offered to him by the four states, Chen, Sz, Ju, Hwang, all ruled by his descendants till they were absorbed by Tsin. T'ai t'ai continued to be god of the Fen river in the Tsin state.\n\nThe origin of the legends must be sought in the notion of local star-worship. This would come in possibly in the eleventh century, or earlier. It might also with more probability have been later. The worship was to be performed by some member of the baronial family, usually the baron. There was a selection made of some ancestor to be worshipped\nwith the star: any one would serve the purpose who had had a career which suggested suitability for this honour. But this appointment was legendary, and not historical; there is no allusion in the Book of Odes, the Book of History, or the Yi king to such legends. This circumstance favours their being the production of the sixth and seventh centuries before Christ, and they would then be a century or two centuries old in the time of Tso c'hiu ming.\n\nIn reference to the origin of the zodiacal sign Shii'chen, corresponding to our Cancer and Leo, it is perhaps derived with the other signs from a foreign source, either by transference of sound or by translation. The words mean \"real sinking.\" The legend has been invented to provide the words and the worship with a fitting personality.\n\nThe constellation assigned to the imperial state Cheu was that belonging to the middle of summer. It was called Chun hwo, \"heat of the red bird,\" and it embraces the space from 9\u00b0 of Lieu, the willow, to 16\u00b0 of Chang, both of these being in the zodiac of twenty-eight. The reason that this space was decided on to represent the Cheu state is said in the Kwo y\u00fc to have been that when Wu Wang set out on his expedition to conquer the Shang dynasty, Jupiter was in Chun hwo. The time was in the calendar of Shang the 28th of the eleventh month, that day being the 25th, Wu ts\u00ef, of the 60 day cycle. In the calendar of Hia this was in the tenth month. At that time Jupiter was in the 13th degree of Chang. At the same time the moon was in Tien si, or Fang. More exactly, the moon was on the day Wu tsie in 5\u00b0 of Fang. The sun was in the sign Si Mu (Sagittarius), the ninth from Kiang leu (Aries), and just fording the milky way. Si mu extends from 10\u00b0 of Wei to 11\u00b0 of Nan teu. On the day Wu tsze the sun should be in 7\u00b0 of Ki. The conjunction of the sun and moon took place at a point one degree in advance of the handle of the Bushel, that is, the tail of the Great Bear. Mercury was in Aquarius (Hiuen hiau). The book Kwo y\u00fc, from which these data are taken, was written by Tso kien ming. The comment upon it by Wei chau was compiled in the time\nof the Three Kingdoms, about A.D. 270. Text and comment have both been used in the statement now given of the place of the sun, moon, Mercury, and Jupiter on the day when Wu Wang (B.C. 1120) started on his expedition to conquer the Shang dynasty. Professor Russell, of Peking, kindly undertook to calculate with these data, and found that no such relative position of these four bodies was possible at the time stated.\n\nThis account of the astrological position of the Cheu kingdom in the constellation Hydra below Cancer and Leo is evidently post-dated, and must be referred to the eighth, seventh, or sixth century before Christ. The reasons for this opinion are various. The division of the empire among the 28 constellations is duodecimal and remarkably regular. It is as follows, as arranged by late writers and inserted in the work Tien Yuen li li:\n\n| No. | Constellation       | Region                  |\n|-----|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1   | Kio Kang            | Cheng                   | Central Honan.         |\n| 2   | Ti, Fang, Sin       | Sung                    | Eastern Honan.         |\n| 3   | Wei, Ki             | Yeu, Yen                | (Fu kien, kiang si) Chili. |\n| 4   | Teu, Nieu           | Wu                      | Kiang su, Che kiang.   |\n| 5   | N\u00fc, H\u00fc, Wei         | Tsi                     | North Shantung.        |\n| 6   | Shi Pi              | Wei                     | South Chili.           |\n| 7   | Kwei Low            | Lu                      | South Shantung.        |\n| 8   | Wei, Mau, Pi        | Chau                    | Western Chili.         |\n| 9   | Tsui, Shen          | Tsin                    | Shansi.                |\n| 10  | Tsing, Kwei         | Ts'in                   | Shensi, Kansu.         |\n| 11  | Lieu, Sing, Chang   | Cheu                    | Western Honan, Hupei, South Shensi. |\n| 12  | Yi Chen             | Ch'u                    | Hunan, Si chwen, Kwangsi. |\n\nThe states Cheng (1) and Ts'in (10) are included. The first barons of these two states only received full investiture in the years B.C. 806 and B.C. 769 respectively. They are not separable from the others, for without them four of the twenty-eight constellations would be left without a special kingdom to shine upon and to be worshipped by. In the work Si ku tsien shu of last century, when the genuineness\nof the Cheu li as a work of B.C. 1100 is discussed, the occurrence of the names of these two states is mentioned as proof that part of that work at least was written long after that date. The same argument goes to show in regard to the doctrine of the local astrology of the feudal states that it probably commenced after the dates B.C. 805 and B.C. 769.\n\nAs the older classics were all anonymous, so also was, it may be said, the Cheu li, for it does not state who was its author, or at what time it was written. The words which mention the allocation of the twenty-eight constellations to the various feudal states are few. \"The officer known as Pau chang shi rules the stars in heaven, and takes note of their changes with those of the sun, moon, and planets, in order that it may be seen what changes will take place on earth, and whether they will be fortunate or unlucky. Viewing the lands as corresponding with certain stars, the empire of nine provinces is so subdivided that each feudal territory has one or more constellations which control it, and in them can be seen its good and ill fortune. By means of the year star Jupiter moving through the twelve years of its period, the good and ill fortune of the empire may be seen.\" This is all. The remaining duties of the astrologer are found to be connected with observing the winds and other meteorological phenomena in order to foreknow good and ill luck. Such being the form assumed by Chinese astrology in the Cheu li, a fair judgment of the period when it was introduced may be easily reached. The first feudal baron of the Cheng state was Yeu, brother of Cheu siuen wang. He received, B.C. 806, a part of the Cheu patrimony included in the modern Honan. Since the first two constellations in the zodiac of twenty-eight were assigned to his state, it may be supposed that it was in his time that the geographical distribution of the twenty-eight constellations was made.\u00b9 This is not essential, it may be said, for Cheng and Sung are on the east of Cheu, and it may be on this account that these constellations were assigned to\n\n\u00b9 Quoted in English Cyclop\u00e6dia under the word Clepsydra.\nthose states. But if this principle of regarding Cheu as the starting-point for orientation suits in some instances, it fails in most cases, and it is probably better to seek another cause, such as the actual place of Jupiter when the allocation was made in each case. There is no reason to doubt, then, that the Cheu li being a manual of official duty, if the duties were at any time increased, there would be an addition made to the book. In Cheu Kung's time there may have been an elementary astrology. I plead only for the developed astrology of the eighth, seventh, and sixth centuries, that there was an addition made to the text of the portion which defines the duty of the official astrologer in regard to the local distribution of stars.\n\nThe native critics of modern times have shown great want of confidence in the genuineness of the Cheu li. In the Sung dynasty this book was ascribed to Lieu hin of the first century B.C. and A.D. Mau si ho attacked this view, and ascribed the book to the Contending States period, or the fourth century B.C. Supposing this date to be correct, there is still more reason for not placing the astrology of the feudal states before the time which, as above shown, the facts seem to require. The clepsydra is not mentioned in any of the classics except this. But we know from Greek sources that the clepsydra was a Babylonian instrument, and was originated by the Babylonians. At least Sextus Empiricus ascribes it to them,\u00b9 and states that they used an instrument of this kind in astrological calculations, and by means of it during the diurnal revolution of a star divided the zodiac into twelve equal parts. The officer who had this instrument in charge is called the carrier of the clepsydra. From this it would seem that the instrument was not like those at present in use at the Peking Observatory, which are bronze vessels of great weight, arranged in successive steps as on a staircase. It was of a size and weight suitable for being lifted by an officer. It is mentioned in the Shwo wen as being made of bronze. Curiously enough it is alluded to\n\n\u00b9 Since this was written Professor Russell has found that in B.C. 806, Jupiter was in the required constellations Kio and K'ang.\nin the oldest preface to the Odes supposed to have been written by Tsze Hia in the fifth century before Christ. But many critics think this preface reads like a Han dynasty production. Whatever be the age of the Cheu li, or of the Preface to the Odes, the astrological passages in the Tso Chwen and in the Kwo y\u00fc help us to place the wide extension of judicial astrology in China not later than the sixth century before Christ. With this should also be placed the introduction of the clepsydra, because such an instrument would be extremely useful when every feudal capital throughout China had its astrological department, and the motions and appearance of stars and planets had to be carefully observed.\n\nThe early appearance of the clepsydra in China seems to show that the Babylonians had communicated this instrument to China before the Greeks had it. It is mentioned in Aristophanes and Aristotle among Greek writers, but scarcely before their time. We may do well to remember the words of Sze ma c'hi'en in connection with the official astrologers. He says, \"When the empire ceased to be well-governed, the correct succession of new moons was not transmitted to the feudal barons. After the emperors Yeu and Li (who died b.c. 770 and 827 respectively), the influence of the Cheu dynasty fell away, the officers ceased to take account of the times, nor did the emperor announce the new moon. The sons and pupils of the official astronomers and mathematicians became scattered, either in different parts of China or among barbarian races. The ceremonies performed for the sake of good and ill luck were in consequence much neglected, and not offered in complete form.\" This is said in the historian's chapter on the calendar. Some of the scattered students of astronomy would settle in each feudal state of importance, and be active in introducing new ideas or facts, or new instruments brought to China from foreign countries by sea or by land, and this would be in the eighth century before Christ, and subsequently. The historian does not say that there was an entire cessation of astronomical duty at the court of Cheu. He simply mourns\nover the decline of activity and efficiency as shown by mistakes in the calendar, and by the dispersion of official schools of instruction. South China would attract some of these wanderers, and some would reach places on the sea. We can judge of what the condition of South China then was by the poetry of Ch'\u00fc yuen.\\(^1\\) The country was inhabited by a people inclined to mystic Tauism and polytheistic legend, into which the personages of Chinese primitive history were boldly introduced, mixed with many foreign-looking novelties of marine myth and semi-divine hero. This vast region was known as the Ch'u country. It thrived by trade in its own produce and the commercial transmission of foreign articles. Astrology, the dial and the clepsydra, would come by the trade routes which lay through South China from Cochin Chinese ports, where, at that time, by the regular development of ocean trade, there would be merchants of western origin residing, who would speak local languages as well as some one of the languages of Western Asia. In this way the system of judicial astrology with the Babylonian cosmography might quite readily be introduced to the knowledge of the Chinese about B.C. 806 and later.\n\nMy argument requires me now to proceed to the question of the extended knowledge of the Chinese of the earth generally in the Chow dynasty, and to point out how it becomes a necessity to account for it by supposing an early enlarged commerce in the Indian Ocean reaching all the way to Cochin China before as well as after the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus. First there are some very interesting relics of a trigonometrical kind in an old Chinese book of the Chow dynasty. This book speaks of the earth's surface being round, and makes use of the sun-dial to measure the earth by taking as values the height of a gnomon, the length of its shadow, and the sun's altitude. They understood the properties of the right-angled triangle, and attempted by the use of the gnomon to measure the earth in a rough way. Mr. Wylie\n\n\\(^1\\) A part of it has been translated by the Marquis d'Herv\u00e9 de St.-Denys.\nsays on this point (Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 86), \"The Chow pi swan king is the only ancient work we have on the Kai tien system of astronomy.\" By this name is meant that system of the universe which represents the heavens as an umbrella and the earth as a bowl turned over and lying at rest beneath it. There were two forms of the umbrella theory. The one viewed the earth as a flat and square plain, the other regarded the earth as having an immense convex but still square surface. This last is the view of the Chow pi swan king, the old book in question, and it is also described in the Tsin dynasty astronomy\\(^1\\) as given in the Tsin history. The reasoning of the umbrella astronomy is invalidated by unsupported assumptions. \"A gnomon\\(^2\\) of eight feet at the solstice gives a shadow of one foot six inches. Go south 1000 li, the shadow is one foot five inches. Go north 1000 li, the shadow is one foot seven inches. The shadow lengthens as the sun goes south. Wait till the shadow is six feet and take then a hollow bamboo with the bore an inch in diameter and eight feet long. Seize the image and carefully look at it. The hollow just covering the sun, there is seen the sun's reflection through the opening. Hence, with eight feet gnomon and one inch aperture you have from the gnomon to a point below the sun a distance of 60,000 li, and there will be no shadow. From this point upward to the sun there are 80,000 li.\" In this reasoning the points of interest are that it was known that the length of the shadow varies with the latitude, and that by going far enough south the shadow diminishes to nothing. Also, the foundation of trigonometry is found in the use of the gnomon. This circumstance has led the Chinese to believe that European trigonometry originated in China, and was taken to the west by the dispersed pupils of the ancient mathematical schools, of whom history speaks as having been scattered to various localities in the eighth century. The names used are \\(ku\\) (kok) standard, upright staff, gnomon, thigh bone, \\(pi\\) (pik),\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This history was written, or rather compiled, about A.D. 630.\n\n\\(^2\\) Capital city of Chow, Lo yang, lat. 34\u00b0 43', long. 112\u00b0 28'.\nthigh bone, and keu (kuk), that part of a mason's rule which projects at a right-angle from the stem. But here keu means the shadow of the gnomon. These names have continued in use from the Chow dynasty downwards, and we may rely on them as ancient. The Chinese critics say of the book Chow pi swan king that while the first catalogue which mentions it is that of the Sui History, A.D. 600, yet it must on various grounds be regarded as a genuine relic of the Chow dynasty. Judging by the materials, style of thought, and statements of the book, they are probably right. But if so, we have a distinct relic of old Babylonian science worked up by Chinese mathematicians of the Chow dynasty. The Babylonian elements are the following:\n\n1. The dial was used for distinguishing latitudes by the length of the shadow.\n2. The clepsydra was used for marking time.\n3. The length of the shadow, the gnomon and a point taken on the earth known with more or less certainty, were supposed to give as a fourth proportional the height of the sun or of heaven.\n4. The squares of the shadow and gnomon were known to be equal to the square on the hypothenuse, or the line joining their extremities.\n\nThese being fairly deserving of the epithet Babylonian, it is a point of interest that we are able to assign them with much probability to a date a little before B.C. 806 as the period of their introduction into China. We know from the Old Testament that the sun dial of Ahaz was taken to Jerusalem about B.C. 740. The Jews learned it with foreign religious observances forbidden to them by their law. The Chinese learned it with astrology and star-worship. Much depended on the place of Jupiter when stars were to be selected for a feudal barony. Whatever constellation happened to be the place of Jupiter in any year when the investiture of a baron took place might become the patron constellation of his barony. Now it appears that Kio and Kang, the first of the zodiac of twenty-eight, were assigned to Cheng, in Honan, and the investiture of the first baron\ntook place in the year B.C. 806. I asked Professor Russell of the Peking College to inform me where Jupiter was B.C. 806. He calculated, and found that he was in Kio and Kang in that year. Since, therefore, the first two constellations could not have been assigned to Cheng before that date, it becomes likely that it was at the same time that the whole scheme of the territorial distribution of the constellations was conceived and carried out to something like completeness. But some years must have passed away before the year 806, during which astrology, a foreign belief, could take root in the country. Hence it may be concluded that astrology gradually grew into prevalence in the ninth century before Christ.\n\nEdouard Biot, in his translation of the Chow li, published in 1851, has limited himself in his criticism on its genuineness to the views of Han and Sung dynasty authors. He accepts Ma twan lin's view, who decides for the Chow li being the production of Chow Kung, its immense multiplication of officers and duties being caused by the inheritance in full of the old traditional system of the Hia and Shang dynasties. Ma twan lin was in tone and principle a Sung man, and was the last great example of that school. Biot, himself a brilliant critic and by tendency and inclination an archaeologist, has in this case stopped short with Ma twan lin, and omitted to consider the views of later Chinese critics. Biot, in his picture of the Chinese ancient world, has been eminently successful in placing it in full detail before his readers. But he has not done all that was necessary for the Chow li. Mau si ho's views respecting it are worth mentioning. He condemns those Sung writers who ascribe it to Lieu hin at the end of the first Han period, and rightly so, for however that author might wish to flatter Wang mang in the compilation of the Chow li, he would not have made such a book as this to carry out that end. It is too wide of the mark. Mau si ho thinks it was a book of the Chan kwo period, that is, of the third or fourth century\n\n1 Chow li wen, i. pp. 3, 10.\nbefore Christ, or perhaps somewhat earlier. There is much to be said for this view, seeing that Confucius, Mencius, and other authors do not quote this book, as they would have done if it were a classic in their times. But for my own part I feel more confidence in the criticism of the eighteenth century,\\(^1\\) which makes the Chow li neither a Han book nor a book of the Chan kwo times, but a book of the early Chow period, partly written by Chow kung, but added to subsequently. The reason why neither Confucius, Mencius, nor, immediately after them, Tso kieu ming, quote passages from it, may be that it was an official book not published. It belonged to a government office in Lo yang, while these three authors lived in the Loo kingdom, three hundred miles to the east. All the Chinese classics are the work of officers, excepting such of the poems as were collected by a commission, and such portions as came from the hand of Confucius. This book belongs to the Western Chow, but was preserved in the eastern capital of that time, viz. Lo yang. We know it was this city, because Chinese old writers,\\(^2\\) in commenting on the use of the gnomon mentioned in chapter 42nd of the Chow li, say that in Lo yang, at the summer solstice, the shadow was one foot five inches in length, which is the length of the gnomon given in the text. To this Chen kang cheng adds that in winter the shadow was thirteen feet in length. The foot of the Chow dynasty was about eight English inches in length.\\(^3\\) We translate Chih by foot, but, in fact, it is a span, and it was probably so in Babylonia also. On the hypothesis that the dial went from Babylon to China about the ninth century before Christ, we have in the Chinese ancient foot measure a possible value for the Babylonian foot and for the height of the gnomon they commonly used. Beside this we have also a possible origin of trigonometry. This science is said to have begun with the building of altars, but it may have begun in the use of\n\n\\(^1\\) Si ku tsijen shu, xix. pp. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 31, 36.\n\n\\(^2\\) Found in Kia kung yen's comment, and in that of Cheng.\n\n\\(^3\\) In the Kin shi so, \"Chain of metal and stone inscriptions,\" the Chow foot is eight English inches, the Han foot is 9\u00b78 inches, the Tain 9\u00b7125, the Sung 10\u00b7625. Foot of A.D. 76 is 9\u00b7125 inches.\nthe dial, which was thus early employed as a measurer in connection with the shadow. The phrase used of the dial in the Chow li, \"to measure the earth,\" is very suggestive. It seems to teach by implication that the Greek sciences of geometry and trigonometry both began with the dial and shadow. The genius of the Babylonians was practical. A higher gift of genius aided the Greeks when they put aside the practical elements and framed out of Babylonian and Egyptian data pure sciences. What the Chinese received in the early Chow period was the Babylonian nucleus from which the Greeks evolved much, one point after another, of their mathematical science. The Chinese do not know that the umbrella astronomy is Babylonian, nor that the dial and clepsydra, with astrology and metrology, are also Babylonian, and, in consequence, they ascribe the origin of these things to their own ancient sages. But for us the knowledge of these things, together with the systematic interpretation of dreams, etc., by the Chinese before the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus, is a part of the proof that distant navigation in the Indian Ocean was prosecuted extensively in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, and, before that, during the long subjection of Babylon to Assyria, for it is only by this supposition that we can easily account for the facts.\n\nThe distorted geographical ideas of the Chinese and their wild primitive cosmography begin, properly speaking, with Lie taze, B.C. 400. There was before his time a system of the world, and the Chinese had ideas, of course, about the universe and the earth of a general kind, as shown in the phrase, \"within the Four Seas.\" But it is for the first time in Lie taze that cosmography finds a voice. We cannot place the ideas respecting the outer world which occur in the Er ya before Lie taze, for the modern critical school find that most of this book is not older than the Han dynasty. It took its present form in the age of Cheng kang cheng, i.e. A.D. 150, and not earlier.\n\nLie taze's view of the universe blooms into its full extravagance in his fifth chapter. It takes the form of a legend, evidently of foreign origin. The world is supported by the\nfour feet of an immense monster, called Ngok.\\footnote{Some Chinese words are here mentioned, with the pronunciation given to them by the ancient Chinese.} A legendary emperor or empress, named Nuko, cut off the feet of the monster to put them to this use. This was after he or she had already prepared stones of five colours to fill up defects in heaven and earth. In a subsequent struggle between two emperors the pillars of heaven were broken and the four cardinal points of the earth sundered. This caused the heavens to fall on the north-west, and consequently the sun, moon, and stars move to that point. The earth also became defective on the south-east, and that is the reason why the rivers all flow to that part of the world.\\footnote{An allusion to the prevailing direction of all Chinese rivers.} East of the Gulf of Pechili is an immense abyss (Pacific Ocean). This bottomless sea is the home to which all waters flow. In this ocean are five islands, known by names such as Bom lai, all inhabited by immortal beings. These islands moved with the tide. This was a matter of grief to the immortals. They petitioned God (Ti) to relieve them, and he in anger caused the islands to float in the first place to the extreme west. Then under the guidance of Gugom, god of the north, a great Ngok lifted them by fifteen movements of the head upon his back. The five islands were afterwards borne by monsters of the same kind to the Lompak country. Two of them were liberated from these animals, floated to the north pole, and sank in the great sea there. Lie tsze speaks of giants many hundred feet high. East of China, at a distance of 400,000 miles, there is a nation of dwarfs called Tsok nok. They are a foot high. In the north are people about seven feet high. On the south of China is a country called Mim lim, and here five hundred years makes a spring and five hundred years an autumn. In the north is a sea called Mim hai. It is heaven\u2019s lake. The bird Bom found there has wings which look as wide as the clouds, and a fish called Kon is also found there which is several thousand miles long.\n\nIn the idea of an ocean round the world, and monstrous creatures inhabiting it belonging to either the fish or the\nbird creation, the Chinese writers of the third and fourth centuries before Christ enter on a region entirely new to the literature of their country. This is also true of the way in which they represent ancient personages of Chinese antiquity as half fish and half man. A favourite mode of describing the ancient emperors Fu hi and Shen nung was a snake body joined to a human face, a cow's head, and a tiger's nose. The new ideas which entered the country at that time were joined to old tradition, so as to make new combinations. The Chinese did not get their new information in a definite and accurate shape. It reached them in the form of pictures, legends, and half-explained doctrines. Hence they attached them to persons with whose names they were familiar, and every fragment of primitive Chinese tradition became embellished with new circumstances. Before this time Chinese literature was realistic, and legend was rare. But Tso kieu ming and Lie tsze set the example of writing romance with pleasure. Chinese style became modified by the infusion of creative imagination. What was old was dressed up in new habiliments, and the world was pictured with the help of fancy. Scraps of knowledge and crude narratives brought from other lands far away became the basis on which was built up a fairy structure, which pleased the new spirit of the age, and has produced on the literature of the country ever since a permanent impression.\n\nThe outer world as thus looked on became a cosmos, made up of monstrosities at a distance and sober facts nearer home. The work known as Shan hai king, Book of the Hills and Seas, is an embodied sketch of this universe, half real and half fabulous. It was intended as a classic of geography. It has become so, if by that name be meant a manual of local legend and mythology, as well as of topography, both for China and the great outer world, as known in the third century before Christ. In the description of the Kwun lun mountain, which corresponds to the Chaldean mountain of the East, it is said that this celebrated mountain is God's (Ti) lower residence. The local deity\nwho rules it is Lokgno (also called in Chwang tsii Kingo), who has a tiger body with nine tails, a human face, and tiger claws. He presides over the nine districts of the nine cities of heaven, and over the times of the gardens of God. There is a beast who is like a ram having four horns. His name is Dulu, and he eats human flesh. The Yellow river flows from this mountain, first north-east and then south. The Red river flows from it to the south-east, and enters the Bamten river.\u00b9 The Yang river flows from it to the south-west, and enters the Tudu river. The Black river flows from it to the west, and enters Tay\u00fc. Beyond it on the west, at a distance of about a thousand li, is the Jade-stone mountain, where the Queen of the West resides. She is called Si wang mu. She has a human appearance, but a panther's tail, and a tiger's teeth. Her hair is spread to the wind, and she wears jade ornaments.\n\nThe 6th, 7th, and 8th chapters of this book describe countries beyond the sea. In speaking, at the commencement, of southern regions, the book says they are ruled by the Tai sui, \"great year god.\" By this is meant the god of each year in the cycle of sixty. The god that rules each year varies in turn till each of the sixty has presided in his place. I place in a note the ten names of these gods for the decimal cycle, kia, yi, ping, ting, wu, ki, keng, sin, jen, kwei.\u00b2 At the end of the account of ocean kingdoms in the south, it is said that the god of fire ruling the south is named Tokyom. He has the body of a quadruped, with the face of a man, and he rides two dragons. In the same way, at the end of the account of western countries, it is added, the god of the west, Nok shu, has in his left ear a snake.\n\n\u00b9 Bamten looks like \"Brahma heaven.\" Ten is tien 'heaven.' Perhaps this is the Brahmaputra. The commentator Kwo pu, of the fourth century after Christ, says, however, that Bamten is the name of a mountain.\n\n\u00b2 In the Er ya we find the ten names (as anciently pronounced) are the following, Otbon, Tannom, Nudo, Gomgu, Tuyom, Duvi, Domtom, Dumkom, Genik, Toyom. The twelve names of the duodecimal cycle, Tsii, c'heu yin, etc., in the Er ya, are Shap de kak (which is stated in the Shi ki to be Jupiter), Tanot, Tipzu, Dai kam lak, Duntsom, Kapgap, Tuntan, Teakgak, Ommu, Daionkin, Kuntun, Tak punnak. The place of Jupiter is in the third hour of the horizon, or 60 degrees from the north towards the east. Tanot is 90 degrees, and the rest in order.\nHe rides two dragons. The commentator of A.D. 300 adds that this was the god of metal, and that he had a human face, a tiger's claws, white hair, and a javelin in his hand.\n\nIn describing the North Sea divinities, this book speaks of an animal like a horse, and named Dodu. Another is like a white horse, with teeth like a saw. This beast feeds on tigers and panthers. The god of the north properly so called is named Gugom, and has a man's face, a bird's head, a black snake in each ear, and a black snake also under each foot. This divinity is also the god of water.\n\nIn the east is Kumom, a divinity who rules the element of wood, having a bird's body, and a human face. He is represented as riding on two dragons.\n\nTo show how ancient Chinese personages are introduced in this book, I will mention what is said near the end of the Emperor Fu hi. In the south-west is the Pa country (in Western China). Fu hi had a son Hien niau, a grandson named Cheng li. Cheng li's son was Heu chau. Heu chau was the forefather of the Pa people. Here we see plainly how a local legend was invented to gratify the people of the Pa region, and to provide them with an object of worship. It must not be supposed that the stories of a local kind with which the Shan hai king is crowded are invented by the author. They have been collected by him from various sources. At the beginning of the 16th chapter, for instance, is a passage which Hwai nan tsze in the second century before Christ quotes from Lie tsze in the fourth. In the fifteenth chapter a kingdom of dwarfs is mentioned in the south. It is named Tsiau nau. The dwarfs are, says Kwo pu, three feet high, the height given in the Shi ki B.C. 100. Lie tsze says the same people are one foot and a half high, and he states that their country is 400,000 Chinese miles distant from China.\n\nThe mode in which Chinese of the Chow dynasty manipulated the materials in their hands, to make new connected legends, may be understood by estimating passages such as the following in the Shen hai king. There is a nation called the Hu people having, explains Kwo p'u, fish bodies and\nhuman faces. The grandson of the fiery emperor (Shen nung), named Ling k'i, was the father of the Hu people, who are able to ascend to heaven and descend from heaven to earth.\n\nThe idea of the soul ascending to heaven after death is old Chinese, applicable to the case of wise kings. The wise king, Wen wang, is said to have ascended to heaven after death. But this notion of the body ascending is a Taoist one, which appears to me to have been imported from abroad. Then when the idea was received and thought about, the Chinese of those times connected it with primitive Chinese traditions and emperors. Such stories obtain currency by passing from one person and locality to another. Reflecting persons have nothing to do with the process. It is the work of the unreflecting, and of those who gladly aid in the circulation of legends.\n\nThe commentary of Kwo p'u on the Shan hai king proves that this author had before him pictures illustrating the book. The expressions he uses when describing divinities and monsters of various kinds shows that this was the case. He speaks of what was on the right and left of the personage he is describing, in just such a way as he would do if he were looking at a picture. From this circumstance the modern critical school of China has decided that this author, writing about A.D. 300, used an illustrated edition of the Shan hai king when writing his comment. Fortunately it has ever since been the fashion, both in the days of manuscript and in printed editions, from the tenth century onward, to publish illustrations with the books, so that in modern editions we probably have pictures not very unlike those on which Kwo p'u looked while writing.\n\nThe process of legend making in the Chow dynasty thus appears to have included four elements. Foreign pictures and images; foreign names, incidents, beliefs, and statements; Chinese primitive traditions and personages; Chow dynasty inventions and combinations. These four elements seem to be woven together inseparably in the legends of the Chow dynasty. Thus when the Yellow Emperor is said to have\ngone up to heaven, we have a Chow dynasty combination of a primitive Chinese emperor with a newly-introduced idea brought from foreign countries. So in the Bamboo Annals, a book of the Contending States, it is said that in the 59th year of the reign of the Yellow Emperor, ambassadors came to China from the \"perforated chest\" nation, and from the \"long-legged nation.\" This is a Chow addition to the old account of the Yellow Emperor, which had no such details. We learn from the Kin shi so that in certain sepulchral chapels in Shantung, dating from the Han dynasty, ambassadors of these nations were sculptured on the walls as ornaments. Two bearers are seen carrying an ambassador of the Perforated Chest nation, and the carrying pole is inserted through the hole in his chest. They are also mentioned in the Shan hai king (Legge, Prolegomena, vol. iii. p. 109). It is necessary in our criticism of the ancient books of the Chinese to distinguish carefully between a book like the Shu king, which has a historical appearance, and a work such as the Bamboo books, which is crowded with myths in the early part, and which does not come down to us with the marks and proofs of historical authenticity.\n\nThe argument for Babylonian influence on China in the Chow dynasty must rest mainly on the evidence from the history of astrology, astronomical instruments, metrology, and astronomy. The legends of monsters and impossible nations might come from India quite as well. But astrology and the foundations of scientific astronomy could come from Babylon alone.\nART. II.\u2014La Calle and the Country of the Khomair, with a Note on North African Marbles; being the Report of a recent Tour, addressed to H.M. Secretary of State. By Consul-General R. L. PLAYFAIR.\n\nCommunicated by R. N. Cust, Esq., Hon. Secretary, with consent of the Author.\n\nAlgiers, April 28th, 1884.\n\nMy tour really commenced at La Calle. I proceeded thither by the ordinary land route, and arrived at B\u00f4ne just in time to catch the Tunis steamer, which left on the 6th April. It was perfectly calm when the vessel left, but after we had been an hour at sea the sirocco, which had been blowing, was suddenly succeeded by a strong north-west gale, and when we arrived off the port, two hours later, we had the greatest difficulty in landing.\n\nThis district is of great historical interest, as it was here that the French first established themselves in North Africa. In 1520 certain merchants of Havre settled at Cape Negro for the purpose of trading with the Arabs and fishing for coral. These were followed, a few years later, by others from Marseilles, who, in 1524, founded the establishment known as the Bastion de France. Owing, however, to its exposed situation, and to the extreme insalubrity of the climate, caused by the emanations from the lake in its immediate vicinity, the Compagnie d\u2019Afrique transferred its establishment to La Calle in 1677.\n\nOn the occasion of my visit an English steamer, \u201cThe Black Sea,\u201d arrived there to load with mineral, and the master very obligingly offered to take me in her to visit the site of the old French factory. It is about thirteen kilom. to the west, on a small rocky promontory, forming a creek, entirely exposed to the north-west winds. This is not the\nplace to enter into a detailed account of its history and of the grievous sufferings the French had to undergo, from persecution on the part of the Arabs and of the Turks at Algiers, from intestine feuds and the ravages of pestilence. The ruins are still in a good state of preservation, and I was much struck with the accuracy of the description of the place given by P\u00e8re Dan in 1634. All the buildings mentioned by him can be identified. It then contained 400 men, who were daily fed at the cost of the Company, and he adds:\u2014\"On y fait ordinairement un trafic avantageux et riche, qui est quantit\u00e9 de corail, de bl\u00e9, de cire, de cuirs, et de chevaux Barb\u00e9s, que les Maures et les Arabes voisins y viennent vendre \u00e0 tr\u00e8s bon prix, et que l'on transporte peu apr\u00e8s en Provence.\"\n\nLa Calle was frequently attacked and destroyed by the Arabs: in 1807 it was granted by the Dey to England, but we never turned it to any good account, and on the termination of the war with France it again reverted to the latter. In 1827 it was finally destroyed by the Algerines, and remained a ruin till 1836, when it was re-occupied by General Yousouf and Captain Berthier de Savigny, who found it exactly in the condition in which it had been last abandoned. There were still about forty houses capable of restoration, especially that of the Governor, now occupied by the Commandant-Sup\u00e9rieur.\n\nThe harbour is a little oblong basin, open to the west-north-west, not more than 120 yards wide at the entrance, and about 300 yards long. On the north side is the rocky peninsula on which the old town of La Calle stands; on the south is a sandy beach on which the modern city has sprung up. The harbour is only accessible for vessels of the smallest size, and when the sea is high it is impossible even for these to enter.\n\nMany projects have been suggested for the creation of a port at La Calle; that of Admiral Mouchez was decided on a few years ago; it contemplated the creation of a great harbour of refuge at Bou-Lif, to the west of the town, having an area of 80 hectares; but after nearly 500,000 fr.\nhad been expended without any appreciable results, it was abandoned. It is now intended to close up the present entrance to the small port, and excavate another to the east, which will not be exposed to the prevailing bad weather. This will be convenient for the coral boats, but it will not permit a steamer to enter.\n\nOn the occasion of my visit six years ago I found the place in a high state of prosperity. Very extensive establishments had been created for salting sardines, and the coral fishery was in full activity. It still has a most prosperous appearance, and, what is rare in Algeria, an over-teeming population; but the sardines seem to have deserted the coast, the salting-houses are closed, the coral banks near the shore have been exhausted, and boats have to go much further off and to much deeper water. Their number also has greatly decreased; there used to be as many as 230 boats engaged in the coral fishery, and nearly as many catching sardines; now the total number does not exceed sixty.\n\nThis falling-off is no doubt due in a great measure to natural causes which no one can control, such as the discovery of rich coral banks on the coast of Sicily; but partly also to the inexplicable policy now in favour in Algeria, which discourages anything like foreign enterprise, and would almost seem framed with the object of getting rid of foreigners altogether from the Colony. Italian boats pay, in virtue of a special Convention, only 400 fr. a year as licence duty; all other nationalities pay 800 fr.; French boats are entirely exempted. The consequence is that all foreign boats are driven out of the trade. This one can understand, but it is hardly conceivable why almost every foreigner by nationality, though born in the Colony, on conviction of the most trivial offence, in addition to the punishment due for it, is sentenced to expulsion. Such cases are constantly brought to the notice of every foreign Consul.\n\nThere are three lakes of considerable size in the neighbourhood of La Calle. That furthest to the west is the Guerah-el-Melah, or, as it used to be called, l\u2019Etang du Bastion. It has an area of 867 hectares and a depth of from\nfour to five metres. There is still a narrow communication between it and the sea, but in former times this was sufficiently wide to enable coral boats to enter and use it as a harbour of refuge during bad weather. The neighbourhood is extremely unhealthy.\n\nThe second lake is the Guerah Obeira, containing a superficies of 2500 hectares; the water is sweet, but dirty, and as the southern side is marshy, with a good deal of aquatic vegetation, miasma is produced, which renders even the neighbourhood of La Calle feverish.\n\nThe third is the Guerah-el-Hout, or Lake Tonga, which will be noticed hereafter.\n\nI started from La Calle for Tabarca on the 8th April, by the newly-constructed carriage-road, parallel to the coastline; it is admirably engineered, but the surface has not yet been completed; in some places it has been covered with newly-laid metal; in others the earth has been worn into deep ruts, or has been washed away by torrents; still I managed to pass without much difficulty in about nine hours.\n\nAfter leaving La Calle the coast runs east-north-east through fine cork forests, and then skirts the lake of Tonga or Guerah-el-Hout (Lake of Fish). This is an immense freshwater marsh in summer, though a lake in winter; it is always pestilential, and its influence is felt as far as La Calle. The drainage of this marsh would cost too much money, and no serious project has ever been formed to carry it out. The communication between it and the sea is called the Oued Messida; it forms a small creek much frequented by coral boats, and where the English steamers take in their cargoes of ore. Beyond it is a hill called Kef Chetob by the Arabs, and Monte Rotondo by the Europeans; from its isolation and conical form it is a very remarkable feature in the landscape.\n\nA little further on are the mines of Kef Om-et-Teboul, which produce argentiferous and auriferous lead and zinc ore, all of which is shipped to Swansea. The number of vessels that have been laden with it during the past three\nyears is as follows:\u2014In 1881, twelve vessels of 12,096 tons; in 1882, sixteen vessels of 15,436 tons; in 1883, twenty vessels of 26,367 tons.\n\nThe quantity of mineral actually extracted at the present time is not more than 12,000 tons per annum, but there are large reserves, and an immense mass of ore which was formerly thrown aside as useless, but which, owing to the advancement in metallurgy, can now be utilized. The firm which has contracted for this mineral is Messrs. Charles H. Thompson and Co., of London and Swansea. Their steamers are sent to the mouth of the Messida to take in cargo there.\n\nThe road up to the mines is good, and beyond it, passing by El Aioun, and crossing the frontier at the Col de Babouch, is an excellent carriage-road leading to Ain Draham. I kept along the lower route, through a wild and mountainous region intersected by deep ravines, and covered with dense brushwood of lentisk, tree heath, cistus, etc., with here and there patches of forest containing oak of various species and maritime pine.\n\nThe road crosses the frontier at some distance from the sea, passing over the high range of hills which terminates in Cape Roux. The cape itself is composed of steeply scarped rocks of a red colour; in former times it was crowned by another establishment belonging to the Compagnie d'Afrique, and we can still see a cutting from the summit to the sea, a sort of slide, down which the corn purchased from the Arabs used to be sent to the ships which were ready to load with it beneath.\n\nShortly after this the road approaches the sea; the coastline is beautifully indented, and there are charming views of land and water at every turn, till at last the Island of Tabarca and the military position on the mainland, high above the town, come in view.\n\nI have given the history of this interesting place elsewhere; I may, however, be allowed to give a very brief recapitulation of it. It was at one time a Roman Colony. After the expedition of Charles V. to Tunis in 1535, the right of fishing for coral here was conceded to the Spaniards,\nand it was subsequently made over to the Lomellini family of Genoa, in exchange for the celebrated corsair Dragut, who had been captured by Andrea Doria. In 1741 it was captured by the Tunisians; part of the inhabitants effected their escape to the Island of San Pietro in Sardinia, others peopled what is still called the Island of Tabarca, near Alicante, on the coast of Spain, and the remainder were carried off and enslaved in Tunis.\n\nWhen I visited this place six years ago it was almost uninhabited, and a traveller could not venture far from the fort without taking considerable precautions. Now it is as secure as any part of Algeria; a village has sprung up, containing an h\u00f4tel and some stone houses; most of the buildings, however, are wooden sheds.\n\nThey are nearly all shops, taverns, and restaurants, built for the supply of the garrison, which till within the last few weeks consisted of 400 men. It has now been reduced to twenty-five Zouaves, commanded by a sub-lieutenant, and these will soon be withdrawn. It is ludicrous to see a village with as many shops as customers; there would have been a general exodus but for the strong hope of Tabarca soon becoming a place of considerable importance, when the new harbour works are commenced.\n\nThe whole place is covered with Roman and medi\u00e6val ruins. The fort which crowns the western side of the island, built by Charles V., is most picturesque, resembling one of the finest castles on the Rhine. It is built on precipitous rocks rising directly from the sea, and from a little distance looks as if it might almost be habitable. On the upper terrace lie about twenty old rusty guns, part of its ancient armament; it contained numerous brass and bronze cannon, but these have long since passed into the melting-pot.\n\nOn the mainland are many Roman buildings; one appears to have been a palace or public bath; it is called \"Keskes\" by the Arabs, and still contains several large vaulted halls, in good preservation. There is a ruined chapel and fortified position behind the h\u00f4tel, with a necropolis attached, prob-\nably Genoese, as the graves are piled in tiers, one above the other, separated only by flat stones or terra-cotta slabs, somewhat in the manner adopted in Italy and Spain at the present day.\n\nOn the hill above is the Bordj Djidid, or \"New Fort,\" built by the Tunisians a great many years ago. Around it have been erected temporary barracks and other subsidiary buildings, sufficient for a large garrison. This fort it is which was bombarded when the place was taken by the French, but it never was in a position to offer even a show of resistance.\n\nClose to the island may still be seen the hull of the \"Auvergne,\" a large four-masted steamer belonging to the Talabot Company, which was driven ashore in 1878. The wreck was pillaged by the Khomair, and though none of the crew were actually killed, some of them were grossly ill-treated; and this, it may be recollected, was one of the indictments against them, which ended in the occupation of their country and of the whole Regency by the French.\n\nAbout 10 kilom. to the east, at a place called Ras-er-Rajel (Man's Head), in the territory of the Oulad Yehia, and again nearly east of Cape Negro, 35 kilom. distant, there exist large and valuable deposits of iron and copper ore, which were pointed out to me during my former visit. These have been granted by the Government of Tunis to the powerful Company which already owns the mines of Mokta-el-Hadid, near B\u00f4ne, and those of Beni Saf, near Oran. They are about to commence work very shortly; they will lay down a line of railway to the mines, and will make a harbour by blocking up the shallow channel between the southern end of the island and the shore, thus forming a port which will be open only to the north-east, and which will be sheltered from the prevailing north-west winds by the island itself. It will be necessary to dig a new channel for the river which flows into the site of the new harbour, at least during the winter months, for in summer it does not reach the sea at all, thus creating a marsh which is a perfect hot-bed of malarious fever.\nThe whole of the property in the neighbourhood, now belonging to the Beylick, has been granted to the Company, including the island itself, a great part of which will be blasted down to supply materials for the harbour works. The terms of the Concession are very advantageous to the Company, and include a payment to the State of 5 per cent. on their net profit. In addition to the land conceded, they have purchased a considerable amount from the Arabs at a very cheap rate, including half the present village; so there is a chance of their becoming nearly as complete autocrats here as they are at Beni Saf. Even the fort on the mainland will be given up to them, and the garrison will be entirely withdrawn. They talk of restoring the old castle and using it as a residence. I fear there is little chance of this precious historical monument being properly preserved when it gets into the hands of a private and irresponsible Company.\n\nIn the old maps of Tunis the country of the Khomair was simply a blank space, and little or nothing was known of its inhabitants. Their manners were reported to be almost brutal. As their territory was inaccessible to any force the Bey could send against them, no one dared to approach their mountains, or, if an expedition did enter, the soldiers were either massacred or the Khomair themselves dispersed into the interior, where pursuit was impossible. Their numbers were considerable, though much exaggerated; and, having but little to lose, they preferred independence and poverty to a more quiet and settled life under Turkish government. When they were too much pressed by want, they had only to replenish their resources by incursions on either side, and they plundered indiscriminately both the subjects of the Bey and the Arabs under French rule in Algeria.\n\nThus for years, shut in between the two countries, they managed to preserve their independence, a thorn, no doubt, in the side of both, but one which was willingly endured by the Algerian authorities till the moment should come when their depredations should give the necessary excuse for an invasion of the Tunisian territories. How the \"invention\"\nof the Khomair actually did lead to the French Protectorate of Tunis is a matter of public notoriety.\n\nHaving procured horses at Tabarca, I started for Ain Draham, the military post in the heart of their country, on the 9th April. There is a good road in process of construction, but it is not yet nearly finished, and it must be a long time ere it will be practicable for wheeled conveyances; but it is an excellent bridle-path, even in the worst places, and for picturesque beauty, the country which it traverses can hardly be surpassed. It ascends the broad valley of the Oued-el-Kebir, opposite the Island of Tabarca, running nearly due south. The ground, wherever possible, is richly cultivated, and will no doubt one day be opened out to European colonization. At present, like all plains in North Africa, when undrained and insufficiently cultivated, that is, cultivated only in the rudimentary manner known to the Arabs, it is very unhealthy, but in due time that will be remedied; no places could have been worse, or are now better, than many parts of the Metidja, near Algiers.\n\nAll over the country there are the ruins of Roman farms or fortified posts; for the most part they are mere heaps of stone, but of large blocks finely cut. One of these, about 5 kilom. from Tabarca, is, however, of a more important character; part of the walls and one arched gateway are still standing; it is close to the river, and is called by the Arabs Kasr Zeitoun (\"Palace of the Olive Tree\"), from a group of gigantic olive trees which grow around it and in its deserted chambers.\n\nAt 17 kilom. from Tabarca is the Oued Kerma, a beautiful clear stream, so called from a large fig tree growing near it; a road bifurcating to the north-east leads to the \"Camp du G\u00e9nie,\" now unoccupied. Beyond, the scenery becomes wilder and more beautiful, consisting of great stretches of oak forest, interspersed with glades of cleared and cultivated land. Not an armed Khomiri was to be seen; the men were all engaged in ploughing the land for next autumn's crop, while the women were clearing the weeds from among the growing corn. All seemed to have a kindly word or a\nsalutation for us as we passed, and I saw none of the black looks and scowls that I had noticed on my former journey. The appearance of the people, however, was lean and miserable: they were covered with disgusting rags, and their huts were of the most squalid description, hardly comparable to any save those in use among such barbarians as the Andaman Islanders.\n\nAt 26 kilom. is the Col de Babouch, the junction of this road with that leading up from Kef Om-et-Teboul. Here is a custom-house, and an agent of the Tunisian Financial Commission, and there was a camp of soldiers engaged in repairing the latter road. Beyond this we passed for a few kilometres through a forest of the most splendid cork trees I have ever seen; I noticed the same beautiful effect of vegetation which had so much struck me before; the upper surfaces of the branches were covered with a thick layer of moss, in which grew polypodium and other varieties of fern; this passed, Ain Draham came suddenly in sight, perched high above on a bleak hill-side, its regular houses and huts of wood with red tiled roofs forming by no means a pleasing contrast with the beauty of the landscape through which we had passed. The view from it, however, is very fine down the whole length of the valley through which we had passed, and seaward the Galita Islands, not visible from Tabarca, appear as if they were only a few miles distant.\n\nAin Draham is situated at a distance of 31 kilom. due south of Tabarca, and at 41 kilom. from La Calle, by the carriage-road passing Om-et-Teboul, El Aioun, and the Col de Babouch. It is 800 metres above the sea, and is well supplied with water from the \"Spring of Money,\" whence it takes its name, and other fountains. Until very lately it had a garrison of 3000 men, commanded by a General of Brigade, now it is only a Colonel's command; there are still about 1200 men, but a further reduction is contemplated, to the despair of the numerous auberge and store keepers who have settled here, and who can have no possible occupation but that of supplying the troops and feeding the officers.\nThere is a fairly good h\u00f4tel, with an ornamental iron balcony, the rails of which form the words \"H\u00f4tel des Pacificateurs\"; the landlady evidently thinks that the French army is maintained expressly for her advantage, and is indignant at the place being left with an insufficient garrison.\n\nThere is no attempt at defence here; no redoubt, entrenchment, or even the simplest walled inclosure. The barracks of the troops and the huts of the settlers cover a considerable area of ground, and although the Khomair have been disarmed, no one really supposes them to be destitute of weapons. Insurrections have occurred in Algeria under more unlikely circumstances, and it is not impossible that some day a rising of this warlike tribe may temporarily endanger the French supremacy, or at least lead to the massacre of many women and children, who would find a safe refuge within a fortified position, if even one of the most rudimentary description.\n\nIt is impossible not to be struck by the extraordinary results which have followed the French Protectorate in this once inaccessible region. Admirable roads have been made, or are in process of construction, northwards to the sea at Tabarca, north-west to Algeria at La Calle, southward to the railway which traverses the valley of the Medjerda, and another has been traced to run eastward to Beja. With all these \"pacificateurs\" no serious fears need ever be entertained for the permanent security of the country.\n\nOn the 10th April I left Ain Draham in a carriage which I had sent up from La Calle: the first part of the road lies through splendid oak forests, but as it descends, these gradually become replaced by brushwood, and finally by open, undulating ground, more or less cultivated.\n\nAt Fedj-el-Meridj, 5 kilom. from Ain Draham, is a little grassy meadow, nestled amongst wooded hills. This evidently was a Roman post, as in the centre of it is a mound of stones, the best of which have been taken away for the construction of the road. One miliary column has, however, been spared; it bears the names of Constantine and Licinius, thus fixing the date prior to the defeat of the latter in A.D. 323.\nIt also bears the number XVIII, probably eighteen miles from Bulla Regia.\n\nThe half-way station to Souk-el-Arba is at Fernana (20 kilom.). This place derives its name from an immense cork oak, the only tree within several miles. It is on the boundary of the Khomair country, and used to be the extreme limit to which the Bey's camp was permitted to come in its annual circuit for the collection of taxes. Here the chiefs used to meet it, and hand over such sums as they felt disposed to pay. If the Tunisian soldiery advanced a step further, the taxes were paid with powder and lead, and these brave warriors never dared to follow their assailants within the limits of their mountains and forests.\n\nAfter the occupation of Ain Draham, a strong column encamped here for many months, and it has left a memorial of its stay, and a testimony to the unhealthy nature of the place, in a large and crowded cemetery.\n\nAbout 7 kilom. before reaching Souk-el-Arba, a cross-country path, but one quite practicable for carriages, branches off to the left and leads to the important Roman ruins of Bulla Regia. It was raining heavily during the time of my visit, and I was unable to make as careful an inspection of them as I could have desired. I regretted this the more as they are rarely visited, and no description of them has ever yet been published.\n\nBulla Regia, no doubt, derived its name from having been the residence of some of the Numidian kings, and it subsequently became a liberum oppidum under the Romans. It is mentioned in the Itinerary of Antoninus as one of the stations on the route from Hippo to Carthage, and again in the Tables of Peutinger. Its position was no doubt determined by the presence of a copious spring of sweet water, which, in this region of brackish rivers, was a priceless treasure. This issues from the foot of Djebel-el-Arabia, one of the hills which bound the north side of the valley of the Medjerda.\n\nThe ruins cover an area of many acres; they consist of several large buildings and numberless smaller vaulted\nedifices now buried in the soil, generally above the spring of the arches. In the centre, to the north, is the spring, which rose in a large semicircular nymph\u00e6um of cut stone, from which leaden pipes issued for the distribution of the water in various directions. Immediately in front of it was an archway built of large blocks of very compact and finely-cut limestone. This was destroyed in the most barbarous manner to supply building material for the railway; the d\u00e9bris even now remaining on the spot gives it the appearance of a disused quarry.\n\nThe spring has now been inclosed within a ch\u00e2teau d'eau, and is conducted in iron pipes for the supply of Souk-el-Arba, which, until the last few days, has been supplied with water from Tunis by train. The surplus suffices to fill the nymph\u00e6um, and to form a marsh further down, full of eels and barbel of great size. Only a small spot on the border of this reservoir has been cleared to its original level; here a fine mosaic pavement has been discovered, and, to judge by the remains lying round about, this must have been a beautiful spot, decorated probably by temples and colonnades, somewhat like the well-known example at Zaghouan.\n\nLower down the valley, almost due south of the spring, are the ruins of the therm\u00e6. Like all the other buildings here, this has been overthrown by an earthquake. Huge masses of masonry lie around, disjointed and overthrown, in a manner that could not have been effected by any other agency. One high arch still remains entire, which helped to sustain the roof of the central hall. The subsidiary buildings are buried in d\u00e9bris nearly to the crown of their vaults. I have no doubt that these chambers will be found almost entire, and probably containing valuable works of art. It would be a great boon to archaeology if this building could be cleared out; in the meantime the earth and ruins which encumber it insure its preservation from the fate which has befallen the triumphal arch before mentioned. It is satisfactory to add that since a military camp has been formed at Souk-el-Arba, stringent orders have been given to respect all the ruins.\nBetween the spring and the baths, but a little to the east, is the theatre, also much buried in earth. One can descend in some places into the corridors, and form a good idea of the nature of the building. The masonry is all of the finest cut stone; the auditorium is entirely filled up, but one square pillar, showing the spring of an arch, exists on the left side of the scena.\n\nAt a considerable distance further east is the amphitheatre, even more destroyed, and apparently of an earlier epoch. The masonry is of less regular rubble, with only cut stone facings and angles. It commanded, like all similar buildings, a splendid view of the country round.\n\nThere are many other edifices, more or less entire, some of great size; one has all its chambers and vaulted roofs in perfect preservation, and was used as a residence by the workmen engaged on the waterworks. There is also a series of eight contiguous cisterns of great size, too high to have been filled by the spring; probably they were intended for the collection of rain-water, which the Romans in North Africa were more accustomed to use for drinking purposes.\n\nFrom this place to the Medjerda is a distance of 7 kilom. The railway station is Souk-el-Arba (Market of Wednesday), 155 kilom. from Tunis and 34 kilom. from Ghardimaou, where the line at present terminates. An entrenched camp has been made here, in subordination to the Commandant Sup\u00e9rieur at Ain Draham. It is the nearest point of departure for Kef (58 kilom.), to which place a mail-carriage runs every day. There is a tolerably good inn close to the railway station.\n\nI commenced my journey homewards on the 11th, but went no further that day than Chemtou, as I was anxious to visit the marble quarries and Roman remains at that place. They are near the railway station of Oued Meliz (Mehliz), 23 kilom. west from Souk-el-Arba.\n\nThe ancient Semitu Colonia is mentioned in the itineraries, like Bulla Regia, as one of the stations on the road from Hippo Regia (B\u00f4ne) to Carthage, but beyond this little is\nknown of its history, and no modern description of the ruins has been published; until the railway opened out the basin of the Medjerda, this part of the country was difficult of access and remote from the usual routes of travellers.\n\nClose to a spot where one of the numerous streams called Oued-el-Melah, or Salt River, flows into the Medjerda, are situated a line of small hills, covering an area of about 90 hectares, the highest point of which is 260 metres above the sea-level. They are composed almost entirely of marble of various kinds, but principally of giallo antico, rose-coloured marble, and a fine brownish breccia. There can be no doubt that these quarries were extensively worked by the Romans; large excavations made by them exist in various places, and numerous inscriptions have been found on blocks of marble which had been extracted but not carried away. I subjoin one out of many, without even attempting to make a guess at its meaning:\n\nIMP. ANTONINI. AVG. PII : D\nN . . . . . . . OHAGRIPR\nCAILICANOFIVEIPPECOS\n\nI was extremely glad to have had the opportunity of visiting this quarry, as it was the only one in North Africa that I had not yet seen. In the hope that a few remarks on the subject of Numidian marbles may prove of use to those interested in the marble trade, I attach a separate Memorandum on the subject.\n\nThe plain on both sides of the hills is covered with extensive Roman remains. The city must have been a very considerable one, larger and more important than its neighbour, Bulla Regia; the latter was probably a Royal residence, and inhabited by people unconnected with commerce; this one was a centre of trade, owing its existence probably to its rich marble quarries. There can be no doubt as to its name. Semitu and Semitus are found in several inscriptions both on tombstones and miliary columns; one of the former bears the truncated effigy of a man standing between two columns, and underneath is the following inscription:\nTHE COUNTRY OF THE KHOMAIR.\n\nL.

Two other mile-stones which I observed are interesting; one gives the orthography of Tabarca almost as used at the present day, instead of Tabraca, as in the Itinerary of Antonine:\n\nTABERCA\nII\n\nThe other gives the name of a road which must have passed here, but which I cannot trace in any of the itineraries:\n\nVIA\nVSOTHA\nIII\n\nThe most prominent ruin in the landscape is that of a long aqueduct, which commenced about 7 kilom. distant among the hills to the west, crossed the Oued-el-Achar by a bridge still entire, and entered a series of seven vaulted cisterns about 2\u00bd kilom. from the works. Thence it passed, partly underground and partly on a long line of arches, crossing the Oued Melah by a bridge, now fallen, till it terminated at the therm\u00e6 in the middle of the city.\n\nThe masonry of this aqueduct is not of a particularly good quality; the plinths of the pillars are of large blocks of cut stone, but the masonry above them is of a common rubble, and the voussoirs of the arches are of small hammer-dressed stones. Here and there a section of the aqueduct may be seen entirely of cut stone; these mark a reconstruction at a period subsequent to the original work. In one pillar I\nobserved four tombstones, some of them turned upside down; another pier had one such tombstone, and probably there were many more used, the inscriptions on which were turned inward. The necropolis was in the hills about 1\u00bd kilom. from the marble works, and, as there are very few stones now existing there, it is probable that the greater part of them were used for public works. It is worthy of remark that, while in the necropolis there are stones both of Pagan and Christian times, those which I have seen utilized as before described are entirely of the former period.\n\nI subjoin two inscriptions taken at random; the first has on the upper part the figures of two persons holding each other by the hand, and apparently making offerings on altars with the other hands; below it is the following:\n\nM.

CAELEST\nMESVIFVMPSVA\nEIEXVVIAS SEC\nAFRICA F PVCANTUR\n\nClose to the end of the aqueduct are the remains of the therm\u00e6, a large building, but of poor construction; the\nmosaic floor, where visible, is exceedingly rude, the tesserae being of brick and nearly 2 inches long by 1 broad. Further south is the theatre; the scena has entirely disappeared, but the cavea is nearly perfect. The diameter is 36 metres; it is divided into five cunei by four vaulted passages, beneath which are chambers opening outwards; under each cuneus is another vaulted apartment opening inwards. The whole appears to have been surrounded by a colonnade. The building is situated close to the Medjerda, with a fine view in every direction. There is also an amphitheatre at some distance to the east, but it is in a very dilapidated condition, and could never have been a fine building. There are many other structures, more or less ruined, one of which appears to have been a basilica.\n\nBut the great feature of the place is undoubtedly the colossal bridge over the Medjerda; it is a work of great magnitude, the southern side is nearly complete, but the rest lies in huge masses, encumbering the bed of the river, as if broken up and tossed about by some great convulsion of nature to such an extent that it is almost impossible to make out its original plan.\n\nIt seems, however, to have crossed the river at an obtuse angle, and down stream on the northern side, there are a number of parallel sluices, with grooves for gates, as if it had also served as a barrage for the irrigation of the plains. The bed of the river has been worn away far below its original level, so that the foundations of the piers are high in the air and entirely exposed. The bridge bears evident proof of having been rebuilt, which, indeed, we know, from an inscription, to have been the case in the reign of Trajan. The great mass of the masonry is of rubble, almost entirely of waste marble from the quarries, faced with immense blocks of cut stone, some of which are tombstones. Indeed, throughout the whole of the city there is no appearance of the marble so near at hand having been used in blocks for any purpose; probably it was too valuable, and was all exported to Rome. One of the tombstones used in the reconstruction of the bridge is 1 m. 60 c. long, 50 c. high,\nand 35 c. thick; it has two figures in round-headed niches in the middle, and the following inscription:\n\nQ. VOLCHAN . . .\nPATRIS . VXOR\nPIA . VIXIT . ANN. CII\nH. S. E.\n\nD. M. S.\nGARGILIA . BVR\nTINA . Q. VOLCHAN\nVARI . FIL . VXOR .\nPIA . VIX . ANN. XXXIII\n\nAnother stone is turned upwards, and has one side of the inscription broken off:\n\nM\u00b7AELIO . AV . .\nRELIO . VERO .\nCAESARICOS II\nIMP. CAESARIS\nT . . . N . HADRIA\nNI . ANTONI . . . .\nAVC . . . . FIL\nD.D. P.P.\n\nThe record of the reconstruction of the bridge is contained on another stone, now lying in a field on the right bank of the river; an attempt was made to carry it off, but owing to its great size and weight this happily failed. It seems to have been broken down the middle; the height is 1 m. 57 c., the length of the lower side 1 m. 65 c., and of the upper one 1 m. 4 c. The letters are of unequal size, varying from 6 to 30 centim. in height. The whole inscription was contained within a raised moulding:\n\n. . [IMP. . C.]AESAR . DIVI\n. . [NERV]AE . F. . NERVA\n. . .

FECIT.\nAt Chemtou I met an officer of the Bureau Arabe, who informed me that, in consequence of the late rains, the road from Ghardimaou to Souk Ahras would probably be impracticable; the diligence on the previous day had broken down, and the passengers had to remain twenty-four hours on the road. As the weather had cleared up, he anticipated that in two days the river would be fordable; but he advised me not to attempt to pass till twenty-four hours had elapsed. I determined to act on his advice, and I returned on the line of railway as far as Beja (more correctly El Badja).\n\nI had visited this place on a former occasion, and I was glad to have an opportunity of seeing the effect of the French Protectorate on it. The town is one of the oldest in the Regency, and I think it was one of the dirtiest. The streets were streams of liquid manure, and the condition of the prison was such that I could not stay long enough in it to copy two interesting Latin inscriptions which it contained. I met here the only European whom I had seen during my travels in the country, an employ\u00e9 in the Telegraph, who looked upon my arrival as quite an event in his life. Now a service of carriages brings visitors from the station to the town, a distance of 12 kilom. Italian and Maltese shops and taverns are common; a Captain of the Bureau Arabe inhabits the Dar-el-Bey, where I was entertained by Si Yoonus, the Tunisian Governor. The old Byzantine citadel has been almost entirely pulled down and replaced by comfortable, if not picturesque, French barracks. Only the central keep remains, formerly the prison, now a depot for military stores. The troops are still in the camp outside the city, but they will soon be removed to the Casbah, in every way a more pleasant and a healthier situation. Things have a general appearance of cleanliness, and the spring in the Casbah, which formerly struck me as so foul, now flows in its original purity.\n\nCaptain Vincent, the Chief of the Bureau Arabe, is an enthusiastic archaeologist, and has collected many interesting inscriptions, Roman, Greek, and Numidian; and he has made a curious discovery, which shows how much the level\nof the town has been raised by the ruins of successive ages.\n\nAt the Bab-es-Souk, or market gate, something like the spring of an arch was observed quite on the ground level. He excavated round the gate outside, and he has discovered the old Roman entrance. It was a double gate; one half is still perfectly entire. The present entrance is built on the ruins of the other half, the ground level being now as high as the spring of the old arch.\n\nI slept at Ghardimaou, the extremity of the railway at present, the same night, and on the following day I proceeded to Souk Ahras; the road, if I may be allowed the expression, follows the line of railway, crossing the Medjerda twenty-three times. It is hardly practicable in fine weather, and quite impossible to travel over after rains; but the line of rail will be entirely finished and open by October next.\n\nThence I returned to Algiers by land.\n\nNote on the Marbles of Algeria and Tunis.\n\nFour years ago I made a Report\\(^1\\) on the quarries of Numidian marbles recently discovered near Kleber, in the Province of Oran, in which I stated that nowhere had I seen marbles of greater beauty or variety, and that the quantity was practically inexhaustible.\n\nImmediately after my visit I conceived the idea, which I have since successfully carried out, of decorating the English church here with this precious material. Every one who has seen the work will admit that I have not exaggerated its beauty, and regrets have constantly been expressed that the quarries should remain unworked. The proprietor, Signor Delmonte, did not care to undertake the work himself; he preferred to sell the whole mountain to a Company; but as he has failed in this, he and his sons have determined to open out the quarries on their own account, and to offer the marble for sale, ready for shipment at Oran, for 400 fr. per cubic metre. The commonest white marble is worth\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Consular Report, 1881, part i. p. 65.\n300 fr., and this would be considered cheap in London or Paris at three times the sum he demands for it. Steamers frequently leave Oran for the United Kingdom laden with Alfa fibre, and masters would gladly take this marble, as ballast, for about 10s. a ton.\n\nI feel sure that all connected with the marble trade will be glad to obtain this information. Specimens may be seen in the Mineralogical Department of the British Museum at South Kensington. The visitor will at once be struck by the superior beauty of these marbles, when he sees them side by side with others from various parts of the world.\n\nMarbles of Chemtou.\n\nNext in value to the quarries of Kleber are those of Chemtou, belonging to a Belgian Company from Li\u00e8ge. They are situated about 3 kilom. from the station of Oued Meliz, on the line of railway from Tunis to Algeria.\n\nPreliminary works of considerable importance have been lately completed, and the operation of extracting and exporting the marble is now being actively carried on. These also were worked by the Romans, and an important city, Semitu Colonia, sprung up in the vicinity, the ruins of which are most interesting.\n\nThe principal varieties of marble found here are:\n\n1. Giallo antico, of a very fine quality.\n2. Rose-coloured marble, of a duller colour than that of Kleber.\n3. A breccia, composed of small pebbles of white, yellow, and pale-brown colour, in a chocolate-coloured cement, quite different to any seen in the Kleber quarries.\n\nA branch railway, 7 kilom. in length, has been laid down, joining the works with the main line, and by this means the stone can be exported from Tunis, and delivered in France and Belgium for about 1000 fr. per cubic metre. When the junction between the Tunisian and Algerian Railways is effected, in October next, it is probable that this marble will be more conveniently shipped at B\u00f4ne or some other port in Algeria.\nMarbles of Filfila.\n\nAbout 25 kilom. from the harbour of Philippeville is Djebel Filfila, where are the marble quarries belonging to M. Lesueur. They contain marble of various qualities, the most common being pure white, some of it adapted for statuary purposes. There is also a good deep black, a fine description of pale blue or dove colour, a small quantity of coralline rose, and a bluish crystalline stone, more nearly resembling granite than marble. True granite actually does exist, but it would not repay the cost of working it.\n\nThe coping of the quays in the new harbour of Philippeville is of large blocks of white marble from these quarries. Specimens of all the other kinds may be seen in M. Lesueur's works, behind the railway terminus at Philippeville.\n\nQuarries of Chennouah.\n\nIn addition to these, there exist in the Province of Algiers, between Tipasa and Cherchell, the quarries of Chennouah, yielding a breccia, but so inferior to that of M. Delmonte or of the Belgian Company, as to be practically worthless. Specimens may be seen in the pillars which decorate the fa\u00e7ade of the Banque de l'Alg\u00e9rie at Algiers.\n\nAlgerian Onyx.\n\nAnd, lastly, there is the so-called Algerian onyx, an alabaster found near Tlemcen. It is very beautiful, and is found over a considerable extent of country, in thin layers, deposited by the action of water, and not in masses large enough to make it suitable for architectural purposes.\n\nThe proprietors only allow a small quantity to be extracted annually, so as to maintain a fictitious value for it.\n\n[The Dj for j, and other continental modes of transcribing Arabic letters, have been retained as in the manuscript, and in accordance with the local nomenclature.]\nART.

For some time Africa has attracted so much attention that the Society in thus acting has been true to its scientific mission, and its Transactions contain already several most important papers on this interesting quarter of the globe.\n\nBefore entering on the subject I wish to treat, I feel that I must say a few words explaining how I came to study the remotest population on the African continent. The close connection of the Semitic tongues with many of the languages of Africa renders the study of the latter a necessity to the Semitist who wishes not to limit himself to the narrow circle out of which there is no issue. However, the study of the African languages and populations is unfortunately one\n\n\u00b9 Journal of the R.A.S. Vol. XV. p. 175.\nof those in which it is hardly possible to confine one's self to a small group; if the student wish to grasp more than one language, he soon finds that he must examine the languages of the whole continent. Two years ago, when I first turned my attention to these languages, I found myself little by little obliged to enlarge the field of my study, till I arrived at the fascinating subject of the Bushmen and their language. In this paper, however, I propose to examine the Bushmen only, and no other of all the populations of Africa.\n\nThe difficulties met with in such a study are numerous indeed, and the greatest is certainly the scanty material extant on the subject, and also the difficulty to assign such and such data to the real Bushmen. For a long time the Bushmen have been assimilated to or confounded with the Hottentots; it is only lately that more scientific travellers have carefully noticed every particularity and separated the Bushmen from the Hottentots. The difference, however, is so great between these two populations, as will be seen further on, that to place them in the same group is the same as stating that all men are of the same genus, and therefore destroying all classifications. What has also much contributed to obscure all about the Bushmen is their strange language, the acquirement of which is so difficult that it was for a long time thought impossible. The travellers coming in contact with the real Bushman could only obtain particulars at second hand, and often from those Bushmen who had, by intercourse with the Dutch, acquired a small knowledge of this European language, and had partly lost their peculiarities.\n\nThe Bushmen now hardly form a race, much less a nation; they are divided into a multitude of small tribes, scattered and isolated all over Southern Africa, having, to avoid persecution, slavery or extermination, taken refuge in the deserts, or in the rugged mountains. In every locality, though they keep remarkably to themselves, they are inevitably brought more or less in contact with other populations, and owing to occasional, not frequent intermarriages\u2014perhaps also to the admission into their community of some few runaway slaves\u2014\nbut mainly through general intercourse, have partly modified their own peculiarities and partly acquired those of their neighbours. In perusing the relations of the travellers about the Bushmen, one cannot help noticing how different are their accounts, because they saw different tribes, and each of these having acquired in their isolation and through intercourse with strange races new characteristics, two facts, which illustrate to a remarkable degree this isolation, are that tribes, often hardly numbering fifty, have acquired such dialectical peculiarities that they cannot understand each other, though distant only a few miles, and that they have no common or national name; they are known to us by the nick-names given to them by their neighbours, or by names of localities. The Boers gave them the name of Bojesman, Englishized into Bushman: the Hottentots call them Saan;\u00b9 the Bechuana, Ba-roa;\u00b2 the Kafirs, Abatwa, etc. The only name which might be doubtfully considered as national is Khuai,\u00b3 which is applied to one special tribe.\n\nIs there a Khuai (if we adopt the name) or Bushman race? it might be asked.\n\nIn spite of all the variations above mentioned, the answer is decidedly in the affirmative. Leaving aside for the present the language, the Bushman represents anthropologically a distinct branch among the African races. He is distinct from the Negro, and from the Bantu, and also from the Hottentot, though having with the latter several characteristics in common. The distinction is so evident that it is felt by all the travellers; even those travellers who have confounded them, or rather given to them the same name, make a certain distinction between the Hottentot and the Bushman. Though he varies according to the localities, he retains everywhere certain permanent characteristics; these characteristics, which struck the traveller, are those of the race.\n\n\u00b9 The sing. is sa, the plur. common saan or s\u00e4n.\n\u00b2 Ba-roa means the people of roa. There is a Bantu population of the same name.\n\u00b3 It seems to mean 'small man'; other etymologies have however been given, and it has been stated that this word designates the 'tablier egyptien,' adopted as the racial name because it exhibits the most marked characteristic.\nThe Bushman is of short stature, his size increases only where his appearance shows a mixture of Bantu blood.\n\nHis skin is light brown, coppery or even light yellow, and unless through strong and evident mixture with Bantu, never black. Besides, a new-born Bushman baby is not black as a new-born Bantu baby, but red, which, however, is also the case for the new-born Negro baby.\n\nThe hair is one of the most persistent racial characteristics, and in the case of the Bushman it is well marked; it is developed in tufts, as that of the Tasmanian, and has an oval transversal cut. The hair is nearly absent on the face and body.\n\nThe skull is well defined, it is round and small, the temples are wide, the eyes far from one another and slightly oblique, the cheek-bones prominent, the nose varies much, but is generally large and flat.\n\nThe body in general is well proportioned, the shoulders are broad, the arms and legs well developed, with remarkably small feet and hands.\n\nThere is a peculiarity which requires special notice. It is the enormous development of the buttocks, which gives the Hottentot his ridiculous appearance. This peculiarity, which is also given to the Bushman, does not, however, appear to be racial, as it is noticed with certainty only on those inhabiting in the vicinity of the Hottentots. The silence of travellers on the point when describing the Bushmen of other localities appears to be most significant; if all the Bushmen had everywhere this remarkable peculiarity, it would have certainly struck the observers. It is therefore probable that it appears only where the Bushmen are crossed with Hottentots.\n\n1 For the anthropological questions I follow principally Dr. Fritsch, who has published a valuable paper on the Bushman in the Transactions of the German Ethnographical Society, 1879, p. 320. See also H. H. Johnston in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. xiii. p. 452; Sir Bartle Frere, same publication, vol. xi. p. 327; E. Holub, in the same publication, vol. x. p. 5, and in his work, 'Seven Years in South Africa.' Waitz, in his Introduction to Anthropology, has gathered an enormous quantity of facts reported by travellers, but unfortunately the Hottentot and the Bushman are often confounded, so that it is difficult to draw conclusions from them.\nAnother peculiarity found among the Bushwomen and, also, sometimes, among the female Hottentots, appears to be racial. It is what is called in French le tablier \u00e9gyptien. This peculiar formation seems to be essentially Bushman, and is in the Hottentot specimens only due to intermixture.\n\nThe teeth of the Bushman, as noticed by Fritsch, place them in a special class; they are not like badly-cut ivory, as in the Bantu, but regular, and of a mother-of-pearl appearance.\n\nAll considered, the Bushman appears to be, when unmixed with Bantu or Hottentot, of small stature and brachycephalic, but well proportioned.\n\nTo demonstrate more clearly the ethnographic difference of the Bushman with the neighbouring races, we must bear in mind the characteristics of the latter. The Bantu is tall, elegantly slender, of a sooty-black colour, and dolicocephalic. The Hottentot, on the other side, is also tall, but of a colour fairer than the Bushman, and the skull is never so round, being, besides, pointed behind and narrow in front. His limbs are thin and slender, his face is stunted, with very high cheek-bones. As for the prognathism, it is never very marked, neither in the Bushman, the Hottentot, nor the Bantu. The prognathism is essentially the characteristic of the true Negro.\n\nThere are still the moral characteristics, which are now taken into account by anthropologists. The Bushman is much better than he was made out by the earliest travellers, and by the neighbouring tribes which despise and oppress him. His greatest love is for freedom, he acknowledges no master, and possesses no slaves. It is this love of independence which made him prefer the wandering life of a hunter to that of a peaceful agriculturist or shepherd, as the Hottentot. As Diogenes, he has reduced his wants to their minimum; he rarely builds a hut, but prefers for abode the natural caves he finds in the rocks; in other localities he\n\n1 In French gr\u00eale.\n2 Another distinguishing characteristic, according to some, is that the Hottentot emits an intolerable odour, while the Bushman is free from it. (Waitz, Introduction to Anthropology, English edition, 1863, p. 103.)\nforms a kind of nest in the bush\u2014hence his name of Bushman\u2014or digs with his nails subterranean caves, from which he has received the name of Earthman. His garment consists only of a small skin. His weapons are still the spear, arrow, and bow, in their most rudimentary form. The spear is a mere branch of tree, to which is tied a piece of bone or flint; the arrow is only a reed treated in the same way. Sometimes, as often happens among savages on the border of civilized lands, an old piece of glass or iron, or a nail, is utilized as point of arrow. The arrow and spear-heads are always poisoned, to render mortal the slight wounds they inflict. He gathers no flocks, which would impede his movements, and only accepts the help of dogs as wild as himself. The Bushmen have, however, one implement\u2014a rounded stone, perforated in the middle, in which is inserted a piece of wood; with this instrument, which carries us back to the first age of man, they dig up a few edible roots growing wild in the desert. To produce fire, he still retains the primitive system of rubbing two pieces of wood\u2014another prehistoric revival.\n\nThough the Bushman has many superstitions, he has no religion, and really no idea of a divinity, unless he has acquired it from missionaries or from neighbouring tribes, and even in those cases it is evident that the Bushman repeats what he has been told without understanding it himself. But in spite of this lack of religion, he is, morally, far superior to the Bantu and the Hottentot, never being uselessly cruel, and being kind and helpful to his fellow-tribesmen. Cattle-stealing is in their eyes only a form of hunting. The Bushman is grateful and devoted to those who treat him kindly. The travellers narrate several cases of Bushmen who have shown the utmost devotion to their masters when these knew how to treat them. The Bushman has a great talent of imitation. It is related of a Bushman employed by a Boer as servant, that he used to imitate in a striking manner every one in the farm and those who visited it, though he always refused to caricature his master, who was kind to him. This talent of imitation is well illustrated by the\npainting and carving left by the Bushmen on the walls of their caves and on the rocks; these drawings are done with different-coloured clays, and the carving only with a flint chisel. Though these representations show many degrees of attainment in art, a striking and realistic likeness is observable in all, nor can there be any doubt of the intention of the artists. Many pictures come closely to caricatures. The Boer, the Hottentot with his large feet and grotesque body, and the dark Bantu, are unmistakeably delineated. It is indeed a strange spectacle to see these naked savages painting with a reed or carving with a piece of flint on the rocks.\u00b9 The Hottentot, and even the Bantu, could certainly never produce the worst of these drawings, though they have attained a higher degree of civilization. The Bushman possesses also a musical instrument, no doubt rudimentary, but which still illustrates again this strange mixture of savage-life with artistic taste.\n\nLanguage.\u2014I have not till now said anything about the language of the Bushmen, having purposely reserved this difficult and important part of my subject, to which these few remarks serve as introduction.\n\nA survey of this language offers the greatest difficulties, the principal one being the scarcity of documents to be found regarding it in Europe. When reading in Bleek's report that he has collected eighty-four volumes of 7200 manuscript half-pages\u2014and his unfinished manuscript Dictionary contains 11,000 entries\u2014the reader must be pained to know that such treasure is out of reach, buried in Sir G. Grey's library in Cape Town. No doubt the great philologist was waiting to publish all the materials that he had gathered, but before he had attained his object death took him away. If he had known that his end was so close, he would have probably published part of these materials, for one page of a Bushman text with English translation would have done\n\n\u00b9 I have seen myself the facsimiles of the paintings, and was struck by their execution. See Mark Hutchinson, \"Notes on a collection of fac-simile of Bushman drawings,\" Journ. of the Anthr. Inst., vol. xii. p. 464; and E. Holub, 'Seven Years in South Africa,' vol. ii. p. 438.\nmore for science than his learned report. But as all these texts are beyond our reach, we must make the best of the scanty materials at our disposal, hoping that one day a scholar will find his way to the treasure accumulated by Bleek, and expose it to the learned world.\n\nOur data are therefore now only the vocabulary and a few sentences given by Arbousset and Daumas in their travels,\u00b9 the vocabulary and a few sentences given by Lichtenstein in his travels,\u00b2 the few observations published by Bleek,\u00b3 a very small vocabulary published by Dr. Hahn,\u2074 and republished by Dr. F. M\u00fcller,\u2075 with another vocabulary obtained from Bleek.\u2076 The only connected text besides the above-mentioned sentences is a so-called prayer given by Arbousset and Daumas.\n\nWhat has prevented more information from being obtained about the language of the Bushmen is no doubt the difficulty for Europeans to acquire it; the abundance of gutturals, the nasalized and uncertain vowels, and above all the strange sounds called clicks, are so foreign to our ears that the first travellers and missionaries did not even attempt to master it, and summarily dismissed all inquiries, saying that the Bushmen must be taught another language to be civilized and Christianized.\u2077 One, indeed, is struck when reading their relations, how they abstained from giving a single word of Bushman, though when speaking of other populations they mix in their narrative as many African words as they can. This difficulty of non-Bushmen to acquire the language of the\n\n\u00b9 T. Arbousset et F. Daumas, Relation d'un voyage d'exploration au Nord-Est de la Colonie du Cap, Paris, 1842.\n\u00b2 Lichtenstein, Travel in Southern Africa, English translation, London, 1812, vol. ii. app. ii. The same author says that he has published his \"Abhandlung \u00fcber Sprachen der S\u00fcd\u00e4frikanischen wilden V\u00f6lkerst\u00e4mme in Bertuchs und Vaters ethnographisch-linguistischen Archiv.\" But I was not able to obtain this publication anywhere.\n\u00b3 In the collective work The Cape and its People.\n\u2074 Jahresbericht des Vereins f\u00fcr Erkunde zu Dresden, Dresden, 1870.\n\u2075 Grundriss der Sprache, Wissenschaft, vol. i. part ii. pp. 25-27.\n\u2076 In his Catalogue of Sir G. Grey's Library Bleek gives only bibliographic notes, but he distinguishes the Bushman's language from the Hottentot, and notes the existence of two dialects at least.\n\u2077 The same was said of the Hottentots and of the inhabitants of Terra-del-Fuego, but since then the Bible has been translated and these people converted without losing their language.\nBushmen has had the most disastrous effect on the tongue itself, for in their intercourse the Bushmen had to use the foreign languages, and little by little adopted foreign words and expressions, more or less disfigured, and some tribes have entirely lost their native idiom; on the Boer frontier they speak a kind of pigeon-Dutch, on the Kafir frontier a kind of pigeon-Kafir, etc. Even in the most isolated tribes it is doubtful if the language is pure. The Hottentots being the people in whose contact the Bushmen were mostly and for the longest time, the words introduced from this quarter are numerous, and induced several philologists to consider the languages of the two populations as from the same primitive stock. Bleek, before he had collected the Bushman literature above mentioned, stated that the relation between the Bushman, or San as he calls it, and Hottentot is the same as between Latin and English, and Dr. T. Hahn, the successor of Bleek, assured us in 1881 \"that there is not the slightest difficulty in proving that the language of the S\u00e1n (Bushman) occupies to that of the Khoikhoi (Hottentot) the same position that English does to the Sanskrit.\"\u00b9 We doubt, however, of the possibility of such a demonstration, as it would be impossible to prove the position of English towards Sanskrit if we had no knowledge of the connecting links Anglo-Saxon, Gothic, Latin, Lithuanian, etc. We rather prefer to take these statements of Bleek and Dr. Hahn as a popular expression to carry to the mind of the reader their opinions on the subject, opinions the scientific demonstration of which appears impossible. The small sketch which follows will, it is hoped, dissipate what is threatening to become a scientific prejudice, propagated by the misinterpretation of a great philologist's utterance.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that in consequence of their wandering life and their tendency to isolate themselves, the Bushmen have been broken into innumerable small tribes, some hardly numbering fifty souls developing innumerable dialects ever changing. The words of the same meaning\n\n\u00b9 R. N. Cust, *The Modern Languages of Africa*, p. 443.\nin the different dialects have often no more connection with one another. For instance, for the word 'mother' we have ngo (\u207fo) in Se-roa, \u03c7oa in the Khusai or Bushman of Lichtenstein, and tau in the Khuai of Bleek given by Dr. F. M\u00fcller. The Se-roa language of the Ba-roa is the one given by Arbousset and Daumas, and called by Bleek cis-gariepian dialect or Bumantsu; the Khuai is the language of the Bushmen living in the neighbourhood of the Koranna-Hottentots, and given by Lichtenstein. The vocabulary collected by Bleek, and published by Dr. F. M\u00fcller, belongs also to the Khuai dialect, as also the few words given by Dr. Hahn.\n\nI will now proceed to give a grammatical sketch so far as the materials at my disposal permit, and will in the transcription follow the Lepsius system as closely as possible.\n\n**Vowels.**\n\n- a nasalised \u0101, \u0113, etc.\n- e o\n- i \u016b u diphthongs au, ai, ao, etc.\n\n**Consonants.**\n\n|                | Explosives. | Fricatives. | Anticipated. |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n|                | Strong.

Palatal i\n- Dental ! Lateral or faucal ||\n- Guttural \u0294 Labial \u0298\n- Spiro-dental \u0294 Linguo-palatal \u0298\n- Undefined \u00d7\nThe vowels have all a more or less obscure sound, and there seems to be a general tendency to nasalization. Though nothing is said of the other vowels, it is probable that some of those given in the text as pure are really \u014d, \u016b, \u0113, etc., as seems to result from the transcription of certain words in Arbousset and Daumas, and in Lichtenstein; in Bleek's report we actually also found \u0113, e, etc.\n\nAs for the consonants, the striking feature is the scarcity of fricatives and the nearly exclusive use of explosives, and specially of the gutturals, the strong one, k, being the only consonantal element in nine-tenths of the words.\n\nThe labial b and m occurs only in a few words; the use of p is doubtful, being found only in one word of the Se-roa dialect, pko 'wood for fire,' and may have been intended for the click as we have in the Khuai dialect [] hoki 'wood;' Bleek gives also as the word for 'son' p\u03c7\u00fcn, where p also perhaps stands for a click. Dr. F. M\u00fcller gives beside the ordinary r a second one represented by r surmounted with a smaller r, as it is not found in Lepsius's Alphabet, it may be intended for \u0159, or for what Bleek, in his report, represents by r surmounted by a small l, which no doubt indicates the middle sound between r and l, as the r of the Akka language. The letter l is found only in Arbousset's vocabulary, and may be this uncertain r.\u00b9\n\nBleek gives the aspirated labial ph (=p' of Lepsius) in [phkoiyne 'to sleep,' and Arbousset the aspirated lingual tl (=l of Lepsius) standing really for \u03c7l or l\u03c7 in tlauke 'blood,' but the aspirated consonants seem to be the natural product of the meeting of the unaspirated with the weak aspirated fricative h, no doubt through the dropping of a vowel: so we have the aspirate k' of Lepsius in kh\u016b 'face,' in ||kh\u0101iti 'to shoot,' where primitively the guttural and the aspirate were probably separated by a vowel, as in |kha for |kiha 'kill him.'\n\nThe nasalization so frequent with the vowels is rare with\n\n\u00b9 There may be still other consonants in the numerous words unknown to us.\nthe consonants, but in several cases \\(nt\\) and \\(nd\\) seem to be a nasalization of primitive \\(t\\) and \\(d\\).\n\nThe palatization of consonants is not rare, but, except in a few cases, it seems to be the natural product of the coming in contact of the consonant with the semi-vowel \\(y\\): \\(ludya\\) \u2018white.\u2019 It is possible, however, that the palatized \\(n\\) found in Hottentot exists also in Bushman. In the fables, the Ichneumon, when speaking, changes the clicks into palatized sibilants and dentals, as the Tortoise changes them into labials.\n\nAs we should expect it from the small number of consonants, the clicks play an important part in the Bushman language, where they have been, indeed, developed to the number of nine. The great importance of these curious sounds, very insufficiently described in Lepsius\u2019s Alphabet, makes it advisable to give here a description of them.\n\nThe special and essential character of the clicks is that they are formed, not by expiration, but by drawing in the breath; they form, really, a pure vibration, necessarily followed by a stop before the speaker can pronounce the letter uttered in the usual way with the breath. The clicks are, besides, always placed before the initial letter; when a word contains a click in the middle, it must be a compound, so \\(tan t^3 jih\\) \u2018warm\u2019 written for \\(t\u00e4j\u00e4\\) by Lichtenstein and given by Dr. F. M\u00fcller under the forms of \\(ta|i\\) or \\(|a|i\\), is certainly a compound of the word for \u2018fire\u2019 \\(t^3 jih\\) for \\(j\u00e4\\) in Lichtenstein and \\(|i\\) in M\u00fcller, and also the word for \u2018child\u2019 given by Lichtenstein \\(ka|koan\\) compound of \\(koan\\) \u2018a youth,\u2019 in the Se-roa \\(kon\\), is \u2018man.\u2019\n\nThe cerebral click \\(!\\) (confounded by Lichtenstein with the palatal \\(j\\)) is sounded by curling the tip of the tongue and pressing it against the middle of the roof of the palate and withdrawing it suddenly and forcibly by suction.\n\nThe palatal click \\(j\\) (\\(t^3\\) in Lichtenstein and \\(f\\) of Bleek) is formed like the last, but pressing the tongue against the termination of the palate at the gums.\n\nThe dental click \\(|\\) (\\(t^1\\) of Lichtenstein) is formed by pressing the tip of the tongue against the front teeth and withdrawing as for the others.\nThe lateral, or, rather, faucal click || (t\u00b2 of Lichtenstein) is formed by pressing the tongue against the faucal point of the palate, and for so doing the tongue practically covers the whole of the palate, as noticed by Tindal in his Nama Grammar, and the tongue is withdrawn as usual by suction. The Kafirs imitate this click by pressing the tongue against the side teeth, hence its name lateral, but among the Bushman it is not lateral, but faucal.\u00b9\n\nThe guttural click \u03b7 (confounded by Lichtenstein with the faucal) is formed like the preceding, but by placing the tongue at the guttural point of the palate.\n\nThe labial \u0398 (confounded with the dental by Lichtenstein, \u03b8 of Wuras according to Bleek, and \u0398 of Bleek\u2019s report) is articulated \u201cby moving the tongue quickly, like that of a performer on a flute.\u201d\n\nThe spiro-dental \u03b7, noticed by Wuras and known only by the mention of Bleek, is sounded by drawing in the breath between the teeth slightly apart. No doubt it has been confounded with the simple aspirate h or the guttural fricative \u03c7 in the transcription, or has been neglected altogether; when p initial precedes a consonant, as in the two words mentioned above, it may perhaps represent this click.\n\nThe linguo-palatal \u03a9 is only used in fables by the Jackal according to Bleek, who says that it \u201cbears to the ordinary labial click a relation in sound similar to that which the palatal bears to the cerebral.\u201d Though we have no other mention of this, it seems so improbable that the Bushmen should have invented a click specially for the Jackal, that it is more rational to think that it actually exists in the language; but it has been confounded in the transcription with the lingual or the palatal.\n\nThe undefined click \u00d7 is, according to Bleek, \u201ca most unpronounceable click,\u201d which in the fables takes the place of all the other clicks when the Moon, the Hare, or the Ant-eater are speaking; and he makes no attempt to describe it.\n\n\u00b9 For this reason it would be advisable to have two different signs, in order to distinguish them accurately.\nIf it existed in the language, as is probable, it has been confounded in the transcription with the others.\n\nAs can be seen from the above description, the clicks have all a certain relation to one another, and in a measure to the consonants. Following the order adopted by Lepsius, we have: faucal, guttural, cerebral, palatal, dental, labial; the spiro-dental corresponds to the aspirate \\( h \\), and the linguo-palatal is a kind of \\( r \\)-click or \\( l \\)-click.\n\nAs for the philological position of the clicks, it is most probable that Edwin Norris was right when he suggested that they play the same part as the tones in Chinese. It has been objected that Hottentot, which has clicks, has tones also; but the clicks are probably of Bushman origin, and have been no doubt adopted by the Hottentots in their contact with the Bushmen, as these curious sounds are strangely contagious; the Shuana, the Kafirs, the Zulus, and many other people, even the Boers, have adopted some. The existence of the clicks is not besides incompatible with that of the tones in the same language, as the former seems to indicate a modification of the beginning, and the latter of the end of the words. However, the existence of tones in the language of the Bushman is even doubtful, as Bleek and others do not mention them. As illustration of clicks taking the place of dropped letters, or compensating for their loss, may be quoted: Se-roa \\( ka \\) 'hand,' Khuai \\( |a \\) or \\( |o \\).\n\nAs for the question whether the clicks are anterior to the consonants, or the consonants to the clicks, it cannot be answered for the present on account of the few specimens at our disposal.\n\nThere is one more observation to be made before leaving the alphabet. As already noticed, the vowels are more or less obscure, but in many cases the vowel must have been so weak that it has been neglected altogether in the transcription; though vowels must be inserted to make the pronunciation possible, as in the name for 'tortoise' \\( \\kappa\\chi\\tau\\omega\\iota \\), and with the prefixes \\( n \\)- and \\( mm \\)- before a click, or a consonant, unless we admit vocalized consonants, as in some languages of Asia.\nBefore going further, the reader might be reminded that the documents at our disposal are only three vocabularies and a few sentences in two dialects. In Arbousset's dialect, the Se-rao, the clicks are not represented at all; in this author, as well as in Lichtenstein's dialect, the Khuai, the orthography adopted is very defective, and often we cannot detect what sound is meant. As far as possible, in this paper the orthography is restored according to the Lepsius system.\n\nIn the Bushman's language there are no gender, two numbers only, and three pronouns.\n\nPronouns.\u2014The personal and possessive pronouns are expressed by means of prefixes or suffixes.\n\nSing. 1st pers. mm. \u1e45, en, i\u1e45, \u0113, \u1e0d Plur. 1st pers. i, si si.\n2nd ,, \u1e0da, a 2nd ,, u-u, u.\n3rd ,, hah\u0101, ha 3rd ,, (wanting)\n\nIn Se-roa, for the first pers. we have also sing. i, plur. se and si.\n\nThe emphatic personal pronouns are formed with the strongest prefixes and the word for 'man' |koan.\n\nmm |koan 'I myself.'\naa |koan 'thou thyself.'\n\nIn the Se-roa dialect the prefix is i\u1e45 for the 1st pers.\n\ni\u1e45|kon 'I myself.'\n\nThe possessive pronouns are expressed by the shorter prefixes:\n\n\u1e45-|k\u0101 'my brother.'\na-|k\u0101 'thy brother.'\nha-|k\u0101 'his or her brother.'\n\nThe possessive adjectives are:\n\ni\u1e45\u1e45 'mine' (written inng by Lichtenstein).\naa-kal|soin 'thine,' i.e. 'the thing of thee.'\nha-kal|soin 'his.'\nsi-si-kal|soin 'ours.'\nThe pronouns in the accusative governed by verbs are expressed by the shortest forms suffixed to the verb:\n\n\u0101k\u0113 (for \u0101ke-\u0113) \u2018give me.\u2019\n\nha|lantana-e (Se-roa) \u2018thou like me not.\u2019\n\nDr. F. M\u00fcller gives also for the 1st person object, :\n\n|kiten \u2018kill me,\u2019 from |ki \u2018to kill,\u2019\n\nwhere the presence of the t between the verb and the suffix is not explained.\n\n|kiaa \u2018kill thee.\u2019\n\n|kha (for |ki-ha) \u2018kill him.\u2019\n\nThe demonstrative is hua in Khuai and ke in Se-roa, but there are other forms, as will be seen:\n\nhua|koan \u2018this man.\u2019\n\nki ke \u2018this fire.\u2019\n\nVerbs.\u2014The verbal forms are necessarily very few in the sentences which compose all our texts, and those found are unexplainable, often on account of no other passage containing the same words.\n\nThe imperative contains the root:\n\n|na \u2018see!\u2019 |loa \u2018drink!\u2019\n\nThe most usual form is composed by prefixing the pronoun to the root:\n\nin-|ainti \u2018I come.\u2019\n\na-tai \u2018thou callest.\u2019\n\nThe other persons are not found in our Khuai sentences.\n\nIn the Se-roa dialect we find:\n\ni-tana \u2018I like.\u2019 { si-tana \u2018we like.\u2019\n\ni-kega \u2018I say.\u2019 { se-tan \u201c \u201c\n\nThe form n-tagagisa in the Se-roa sentence,\n\nk\u016be n-tagagisa \u2018I have walked a long time,\u2019\n\nis difficult to explain.\n\nWhen the subject is expressed emphatically, the verb is used without the prefixes:\n\nmm |koan |keuna \u2018I myself am thirsty.\u2019\nIn the Khuai dialect this form with the pronominal suffixes seems to be used for the past and future as well as for the present, the context or an adverb indicates the tense to be translated:\n\n*aa kossi ||kaansi*, lit. 'thou again comest,' *i.e.* 'thou willst come again.'\n\nThe Se-roa dialect, perhaps through Kafir influence, seems to have developed a kind of future by means of the verb *ta\u00f1a* 'to like' or 'to wish for,' used as auxiliary:\n\n*i-ta\u00f1\u00e4 i-\u014bkoya ||ko\u00efnta*, lit. 'I wish I go asleep,' *i.e.* 'I will go to sleep.'\n\n*i-ta\u00f1\u00e4 i-kekega* 'I will speak.'\n\n*se-ta\u00f1\u00e4 se-\u014bkoa \u014bk\u014d* 'we will sing a song.'\n\nThis mode of speaking does not, however, necessarily imply the future. But when the wish is distinctly meant, the second verb is preceded by the particle *ga*:\n\n*si-ta\u00f1\u00e4 ga tagagisa* 'we wish to walk.'\n\nThe negative *|an* is always placed before the verb and after the pronominal prefix, when the latter is expressed:\n\n*mm |koan ||keikei* 'Myself have not.'\n\n*ha ||an tanga-e* 'Thou liktest me not.'\n\nThe following sentence in Se-roa:\n\n*n-tloke h\u0101* 'I have nothing to eat,'\n\nsuggests the existence of a negative voice in this dialect. Certain final forms, as that in *-isa*, show that the same dialect under the Kafir influence has perhaps developed derivative verbs.\n\nThe interrogation seems in the Khuai dialect to be expressed by one word varying in form placed at the beginning of the sentence, and a particle *ti*, *di* or *de* placed at the end, the pronoun is generally omitted:\n\n1. *a\u03c7a kaun jainti-di* 'Where doest thou go?'\n   what there go?\n\n2. *a\u03c7asim |na ||kai-ti* 'Hast thou seen game?'\n   what see game?\n3. \\(a\\chi\\text{an} \\ jainti-di\\) 'Whence comest thou?'\n   what come?\n\n4. \\(a\\chi\\text{an} \\ aa \\ tai-de\\) 'How doest thou call thyself?'\n   what thou call?\n\n5. \\(a\\chi\\text{a} \\ ke\\text{una}\\) 'Art thou thirsty?'\n   what thirst\n\n6. \\(a\\chi\\text{a} \\ i\\text{ni}\\) 'Doest thou know him?'\n   what know\n\n7. \\(tire \\ xasi\\text{n} \\ na\\) 'Where hast thou seen it?'\n   place (?) what see.\n\nIt would be imprudent to draw conclusions and set up rules from these seven examples. However, we can see from the last three that the final particle was not always necessary. The \\(n\\) in \\(a\\chi\\text{an}\\) in Nos. 3 and 4 may express a kind of instrumental, in No. 3 it would be 'by what' (place), and in No. 4 'by what' (name). The final \\(-si\\text{n}\\) in No. 2 may express remoteness. In No. 4 the pronoun expressed \\(aa\\) is no doubt the accusative regimen of the verb, and in No. 6, \\(a\\chi\\text{a}\\) is perhaps for \\(a\\chi\\text{a} \\ ha\\) 'what him;' if so, in interrogative sentences a pronoun regimen would precede the verb. The word \\(tire\\), which in No. 7 seems to take the place of the initial vowel \\(a\\) of the interrogative, is not found otherwise, so its real strength cannot be detected.\n\n**Numerals.**\u2014Bushmen not possessing anything do not want any numerals. When they wish to express a number, they merely raise as many fingers. In the Khuai dialect we have only \\(loai\\) 'one,' \\(lu\\) 'two,' for 'three' \\(joaya\\) 'many' is used. The Se-roa dialect appears to be better off, and the numerals go up to 'four,' and, as in the Polynesian languages, the numeral is always preceded by a word:\n\n- **one** \\(te \\ a \\ noa\\).\n- **two** \\(te \\ nu\\).\n- **three** \\(te \\ nuene\\).\n- **four** \\(te \\ nkeo\\).\n- **many** \\(te \\ a \\ gabe\\).\n\nThe word \\(te\\) is not found in any other sentence or expres-\nsion, so we do not know its meaning, but it may perhaps mean 'finger,' which in Khuai is |a; if the supposition is right, te a noa would be 'finger is one,' a being the Se-roa form of the verb 'to be.' 'Many' te a gabe might be 'the fingers are many,' but this is a mere supposition, as gabe also is not found in other expressions.\n\nNouns and Adjectives.\u2014The adjectives do not form a special class, and are really nouns placed in apposition, we therefore take them together.\n\nAs already stated, there is no gender in the words: beings of different sex are often expressed by different words:\n\n|ka 'brother.'\n|kaxu 'sister.'\n\nIn the words which apply to both sexes the distinction is made by adding 'male' or 'female':\n\nigo-aih 'bull.'\nigo-aiti 'cow.'\n\nThe word aih is no doubt the same as |ki 'people,' and aiti the same as |ati or |aiti 'a female.' The click is dropped, perhaps, because the two words form a compound so homogeneous that they are considered to form only one word, and the clicks not being admitted in the middle must be dropped.\n\nArbousset and Daumas's vocabulary is so defectively written that it is hard to make out the real words meant in Se-roa; we have:\n\nkoen ka oga 'a lion.'\nkoen ka nte 'a lioness.'\n\nwhich seems to mean 'lion's male' and 'lion's female.' 'Lion' in Khusi is ||k\u0101 according to Bleek, and |k\u0101n according to Lichtenstein, of which koen seems to be the Se-roa form, the click being omitted by the transcribers. ka is the mark of the genitive, oga is therefore 'male' and nte 'female,' re-\n\n1 Bleek gives 'man' (vir) !kui goui, 'woman' !kui !ayi, which seem to be formed with the word !kwi 'a human being,' and an adjective.\nlated to \u1e6dei and |aii, as ai\u0331h and ai\u0331ti of the Khuai expressions. In the Se-roa vocabulary we find also:\n\nkuane ka oga \u2018bull.\n\nka oga \u2018cow\u2019\u2014\n\nwhich must be incorrect: kuane may be however the Se-roa word for \u2018cattle\u2019 or \u2018ox\u2019 in general, without reference to the gender, as we have in Khuai jkau for \u2018buffalo\u2019: kuane ka oga would be then \u2018buffalo\u2019s male\u2019\u2014the second expression ka oga for \u2018cow\u2019 must be a mistranscription. The two following expressions in Se-roa\n\nk\u00fce-ea \u2018springbok,\u2019\n\nkoli-nte \u2018blessbok,\u2019\n\ngive us the form without the particle: ea\u2014the Khuai ai\u0331h \u2018male\u2019 and nte\u2014ai\u0331ti \u2018female.\u2019\n\nIt must be mentioned that Bleek said in his report that the Bushman\u2019s language distinguished perhaps at one time the genders, as the Hottentot: this is suggested to him by the fact that in the fables certain animals are made to marry others, and he supposes that, as in French, certain genders are specially applied to certain animals and used as common, as in the words girafe, hy\u00e8ne, li\u00e8vre, etc., which are always the same one gender, even when spoken of male or female. In French, as in Bushman, one must, to express the sex, say, le male de la girafe, le male de la hy\u00e8ne, etc. This supposition of Bleek has been adopted by Dr. Hahn and Dr. F. M\u00fcller, who suppose Khuai to be a decayed Hottentot dialect. We must remember, however, that in Hottentot the genders are not what they are in the classic tongues. The masculine, feminine, and common gender are always carefully distinguished, and do not answer to our masculine, feminine, and neuter; we do not find masculine applied to female, as in the French virago, or neuter to female as in the German Weib, or feminine to neuter as in the English ship. In the Bushman\u2019s language it seems to me that there never was any gender, but that, as in Turk and Akkadian, when it was\n\n1 Second report, \u201cA Short Account of Bushman Folklore, Cape Town, 1875.\u201d\nindispensable to express it, this was done by means of the words male and female; if there is a tendency at all to distinguish genders, it is no doubt due to a long intercourse with, and influence of, the sex-denoting Hottentot, but as far as we know from the documents we possess, this supposed tendency is very doubtful.\n\nThe formation of the plural is, by its irregularity, one of the most striking features of the Khuai dialect. The reduplication is generally used, and with monosyllabics ending in a vowel it is simple.\n\ntu 'nose.' plur. tutu.\n|n\u00f5a 'foot.' ,, |n\u00f5a|n\u00f5a.\n|k\u0113 'tooth.' ,, |k\u0113|k\u0113.\n|ka 'arm.' ,, |ka|ka.\n\nIn this last example the vowel has become shortened.\n\nWhen the word ends in a consonant, or is of more than one syllable, the initial sound alone is repeated:\n\n|n\u012bn 'house.' plur. |n\u012b|n\u012bn.\n|n\u016bntu 'ear.' ,, |n\u016b||n\u016bntu.\n|num 'bear.' ,, |n\u016b|num.\n\nSome words form their plural with the suffix en, dropping their final vowel:\n\n|janki 'body.' plur. |janken.\n|ika\u03c7u 'sister.' ,, |ika\u03c7en.\n\nSometimes this suffix is added after the reduplication:\n\n|tsa\u03c7u 'eye.' plur. |tsa|tsa\u03c7en (by the side of |tsa\u03c7en).\n\nIn some words the suffix is preceded by other letters:\u00b9\n\n|kobo 'a black boy.' plur. |kokoboken.\n|koa 'leg.' ,, |ko|koaken.\n|ku 'hair.' ,, |ku|kugyen.\n|koa 'bone.' ,, |ko|koa-ken.\n\n\u00b9 The consonant which is introduced before the suffix may be a remnant of the suffix of the genitive, and the suffix en may be a decayed form meaning 'many.' If this supposition is right, the plural |kokobo-k-en would be literally 'boy boy's many,' i.e. 'several boys.'\nIn some words there seems to be a change of vocalization with a partial reduplication:\n\n||kuka 'shoe.' plur. ||ku||ku.\n||kun 'wing.' ,, ||kokun.\n|ko\u00efn 'dog.' ,, |k\u00fcnk\u00fcn.\n\nFinally some words are quite altered:\n\n\u00a1\u00fciya 'great,' or 'big.' plur. \u00a1uita.\n|eri 'little,' or 'small.' ,, |\u00ean.\n\nAs far as we can judge from the Se-roa vocabulary, similar formations were in force in this dialect; we find:\n\nkoatu 'bottom.' plur. kokoatu.\n\nOf the following reduplicated plurals the singular is not given:\n\n\u03c7'\u03c7ubi 'white ants.'\nko\u00e4nko\u00e4n 'stars.'\n\nIn some cases the Se-roa seems to form the plural by a prefix, no doubt through Kafir influence:\n\ntsago 'eye.' plur. n-tsago.\n\u00f1\u00fctu 'ear.' ,, e-\u00f1\u00fctu.\nkui 'feather,' or 'bird.' ,, i-kui.\n\nThe plural prefix seems also to have been used with the reduplication:\n\nnomaten 'knee.' plur. i-n\u00f6nomaten.\n\nThe genitive is generally expressed by simple apposition, the possessor standing first:\n\n||k\u00e4 \u00a1kui 'the lion's tail.'\ntoi \u00a1kui 'the ostrich's tail.'\n!koa tsaxu 'the water's eye,' i.e. 'the spring.'\n\nThe particles ka, ga, ya or a placed after the possessor mark the emphatic genitive:\n\n||k\u00e4 ga \u00e3n 'the flesh of the lion.'\nsa ga \u00e3n 'the flesh of the eland.'\naa ka ||so\u00efn 'the thing of thee.'\n|kam ka |kui 'the man of the Kam,' i.e. 'the Hottentot.'\nThe word *kam* is not found by itself.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn the Se-roa dialect the order is reversed, the possessor standing after the regent:\n\n- *teago kolo* 'the eye of millet,' i.e. 'grain of millet.'\n- *gen nana* 'the place of the feet,' i.e. 'the door.'\n\nThe same order is preserved with the particle, but not always; we have:\n\n- *koen ka oga* 'the lion's male.'\n- *gen ga koaga* 'the place of the cow.'\n\nThe adjectives being really nouns placed in apposition, follow the word they qualify:\n\n- *ka koan* 'boy young,' i.e. 'child.'\n- *igo-aih* 'ox male,' i.e. 'bull.'\n\nIn Se-roa the same order is observed:\n\n- *kan ta* 'master good.'\n- *komao kho* 'stone big,' i.e. 'rock.'\n- *kaba nieneke* 'river small.'\n\nAs the verb 'to be' is often understood:\n\n- *hua koan teinei*\n\ncan be translated by 'this man is good,' or 'this good man,'\n\n- *mm koan ||uh* 'myself [I am] a whiteman.'\n\nIn Khuai the verb 'to be' is expressed by *gan* for 'is,' and *gan ||u* for 'are,' the adjective agreeing in number with the subject:\n\n**Sing.**\n- *jnu gan juiya* 'the sea-cow is big.'\n- *n-jkaxu loai gan eri* 'my sister one is small.'\n\n**Plur.**\n- *jnu e joaya gan ||ujuita* 'the sea-cows are big.'\n- *n-jkaxen ||u gan ||u en* 'my two sisters are small.'\n\nIn the last sentence but one *jnu e joaya* is 'sea-cow the many,' *e* is a short form of the verb 'to be,' which seems to be used in that case as a kind of article.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) But I am inclined to believe that it means 'land,' or 'soil': the Hottentot being generally agriculturist, the Bushmen looked on him as the man of the soil.\nIn Se-roa the verb 'to be' is \\(a\\), and is invariable.\n\n\\(tloatloa a koan\\) 'the arrow is touching.'\n\n\\(k\u016b a ta\\) 'the locusts are good.'\n\nThe weaker form used as a kind of article is also \\(e\\).\n\n\\(\u03c7uai e nieneko\\) 'a thing the small,' i.e. 'a small thing.'\n\nAs just seen, the verb 'to be,' under the form of \\(a\\), was in Se-roa used as a kind of auxiliary, and there seems a tendency in this dialect to treat all verbal roots as adjectives or participial forms, and to use them with this auxiliary:\n\n\\(k\u016b a s\u0113\\) 'the locusts are come or coming.'\n\n\\(\u03c7orosi k\u016be a s\u0113\\) 'rain already is come.'\n\nThe word \\(k\u016be\\) is an adverb which indicates the past, as it is translated in the vocabulary by 'formerly' and 'since a long time.'\n\nOrder of Sentence.\u2014The order of the word in the sentence is very capricious; however, the imperative is generally placed at the beginning:\n\n\\(\u0101ke twakka\\) 'give me tobacco.'\n\nIn the other cases the verb or the adjective used as predicate is placed at the end, and the subject at the beginning, when emphatically expressed:\n\n\\(aa kossi ||kansi\\) 'thou wilt come again.'\n\n\\(hua ||koan ||an teteini\\) 'this man (is) not good.'\n\n||uhnkoissi a-||gaui 'to-morrow thou comest.'\n\n||kan in-ainti 'there I come.'\n\nIn the Se-roa dialect the same order is generally observed, but there are some sentences where the verb is at the beginning, and it seems to be the rule for the auxiliary \\(tana\\):\n\n\\(sua ki k\u0113\\) 'blow the fire.'\n\n\\(kon ka\\) 'to kill a man.'\n\n||koba ki kuita 'filled fire all,' i.e. 'the fire is all filled (with smoke).'\n\n\\(i-tana i-||kogu ||koba hu\\) 'we like our stomach filled [with] food.'\n\n\\(i-kega keoa\\) 'I speak the truth.'\nFormation of Nouns.\u2014It has been wrongly asserted that the language of the Bushman had no formatives; with the limited vocabularies at our disposal it is difficult often to detect the formation, but even in these few words the existence of formatives is evident. We have already quoted ta|i \u2018warm,\u2019 from |i \u2018fire,\u2019 where ta seems a formative prefix, perhaps it is the same formative written te in teteini \u2018good,\u2019 in other adjectives we have no doubt a formative suffix, as in !ud-ya \u2018white,\u2019 !ki-ya \u2018red,\u2019 jaya \u2018many,\u2019 jui-ya \u2018big\u2019; in the plural of this last word the suffix ya is changed to ta; another suffix ke or ki forms adjectives or appellatives: a-ke \u2018good,\u2019 !kauru-ke \u2018iron,\u2019 ||kana-ki \u2018bad.\u2019 Besides ta we have another prefix u, placed after the initial click: |u-ka \u2018dead,\u2019 from |ki \u2018to kill.\u2019 The same formatives are found in Se-roa: ya appears under the form ia, and exclusively after a nasal, keria \u2018needle,\u2019 ku\u00ean-ia (cf. the Khuai |ko\u00f1) \u2018dog,\u2019 keu\u00f1-ia \u2018a strap,\u2019 kibi-ke \u2018ostrich\u2019s egg,\u2019 sebe-ke \u2018iron.\u2019 This same dialect seems to have another formative suffix se:1 kebe-se \u2018fine,\u2019 nuala-se \u2018spear,\u2019 which sometimes is used as a formative prefix, se-koku \u2018shield\u2019; the double use of a formative as prefix and suffix is evident, for ta, as seen above, in ta|i and the plural !ui-ta. Going through the vocabularies we find words evidently formed by other suffixes and prefixes, but they cannot be analyzed with safety and certainty in the present state of our knowledge of the language.\n\nImportance of the Bushman\u2019s Language.\u2014These few notes will be sufficient, I trust, to show the great importance of the Bushman\u2019s language from a philological point of view, and would largely repay the man who could devote himself to it. Bleek understood it, and gave to this study, entirely and with enthusiasm, the last years of his laborious life.\n\nThe Bushmen\u2019s dialects are so innumerable that the language has become individual in its peculiarities. Bleek, in his report, remarks that dialectal differences are noticed in each individual from whom he gathered the tales now in\n\n1 In Se-roa the suffix ai seems to form diminutives: gnu \u2018a gnu,\u2019 ngai \u2018the little one of a gnu.\u2019\nCape Town; and, as we have already noticed, the few words we possess differ between themselves, even when collected in the same localities from two different persons. This very fact makes this language precious for the philologist, as he could notice in a small area wonderful changes, and, taking into account all the surrounding influences, detect the real and genuine national words; we can already, with the little we possess, notice curious changes. The clicks, for instance, are not immutable, but vary as much as the other elements of the language. The palatal \\(i\\) and the cerebral \\(l\\) are easily interchanged, and might be considered as developments of the same original, or one as the offshoot of the other: the same may be said of the faucal (lateral) and the guttural. We notice, also, changes between clicks and consonants, as the already-quoted \\(la\\) for \\(ta\\). Bleek, in his report, notices that in the tales collected by him the tortoise changes clicks in labials, the ichneumon uses instead palatals, the jackal replaces the labial click \\(l\\) by the linguo-palatal \\(o\\), and the moon, the hare, and the anteater, use \"a most unpronounceable click.\" Even in the two vocabularies we possess, changes of clicks are noticeable, \\(ts\u00fcn\\) 'thing,' given by Dr. Hahn, is \\(lsoin\\) in Lichtenstein, and \\(tsaxe\\) 'eye,' becomes \\(sagu\\); for 'wood' Bleek gives \\(l\\)hoki, Dr. Hahn \\(ihoggen\\), and Lichtenstein \\(hauki\\), etc.\\(^1\\) The consonantal changes are not less numerous and interesting. Bleek says that in the fables the blue crane adds 'tt' to the end of the first syllable of almost every word.' For 'nose' Bleek gives \\(tu\\), Dr. Hahn and Lichtenstein \\(nudu\\), and Arbousset \\(nuen\\); for 'lion' Bleek gives \\(lk\u0101\\), Lichtenstein \\(lk\u0101i\\), and Arbousset \\(koen\\). Sometimes words entirely different have been adopted: for 'arrow' Bleek gives \\(kara\\), Lichtenstein \\(noa\\), and Arbousset \\(loatloa\\). As for the peculiar changes which Bleek notices in the Bushman's fables collected by him, they may be compared to the peculiar accent attributed to countrymen and foreigners, or the representation in writing of lisping and\n\n\\(^1\\) From the words for 'one' and 'two' \\(l\u014dai\\) and \\(lw\\) in Khuai and \\(noa\\) and \\(lw\\) in Se-roa, it would seem that the click \\(l\\) changes regularly in gutturo-nasal \\(s\\) from one dialect to the other.\nstammering; evidently, in the idea of the Bushmen, the animals, when they spoke, had each a peculiar accent. The study of these animals' languages or dialects would be very interesting to the philologist.\n\nBushman's Literature.\u2014As before stated, the connected texts we now possess are unfortunately very few, and consist only in the sentences collected by Lichtenstein in the Khuai dialect, and those in the Se-roa dialect published by Arbousset and Daumas, with a so-called prayer of four sentences, and one sentence in his text. This is nothing compared to the immense materials collected by Bleek of fables, tales, histories, personal relations, mythological stories, genealogies, etc., all carefully transcribed and translated. This collection forms eighty-four volumes of 3600 pages, in two columns. These volumes are not exclusively filled with Bushman literature, for they contain, also, the translation of the native pieces in English, and sometimes, also, in Dutch, and, in the case of animals' speech, the transcription is also given in ordinary Bushman; some pieces are, besides, entered in several dialects.\n\nA short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the catalogue given by Bleek will give a better idea of this collection. He divides the literature into two classes:\n\nA. Mythology, fables, legends, and poetry. I. The tales relating to the mantis, which hold the first place in this class (No. 1\u201314) and contain many episodes; II. The stories relating to the moon and sun (No. 15\u201321); III. Stories relative to stars (No. 22\u201326); IV. Animals' fables, the most interesting part of the literature (No. 27\u201335); V. Legends speaking principally of the people anterior to the Bushman in the land (No. 36\u201341); VI. Poetry, consisting of songs, incantations, and prayers (No. 42\u201362).\n\nB. History (natural and personal). VII. Animals and their habits\u2014adventures with them and hunting (No. 63\u201386); VIII. Personal history, containing adventures and accidents which befell the narrators (No. 87\u201396); IX. Customs and superstitions, most interesting as illustrating the mode of life of the Bushmen (No. 67\u2013112); X. Genealogies,\nwords, sentences (No. 113\u2013125). The last section contains lists of names of animals and insects, extensive vocabularies, and sentences in several dialects.\n\nFrom this short summary we readily understand the importance of the collection, and must regret that nothing of it has been yet published. Just before his death, Bleek intended to appeal to the European learned world for support to enable him to pursue his researches and publish their result. The appeal was made in the name of his widow by his sister-in-law, Miss Lucy Lloyd, under the date of 18th of September, 1875, but does not appear to have met with any response.\n\nIt must be mentioned that doubts have been raised as to the genuineness of the tales recited by the Bushmen to Bleek. Even were these warranted, the circumstance would not take away the philological importance of the texts: but they really seem to have little foundation, as we can hardly believe that the Bushmen would have invented the stories with the curious animals\u2019 clicks, and, the other populations not being able to pronounce them, it is not likely that the tales were theirs.\n\nRelationship of the Bushman.\u2014It may be asked, what is the Bushman, what is his position in regard to the other tribes and among the human family, and whether he is a last and isolated specimen of an extinct race? It has been asserted by some that the Bushmen were the result of a mixture of all the runaway slaves, and by others that they were the broken remnants of a degraded and decayed population. Against these two assumptions Dr. Fritsch protests rightly, remarking that the Bushmen have none of the characters which would warrant such suppositions. He observes, with great acuteness, that the Bushmen love their savage life, and prefer it to the comfort of civilization; it is where they have accepted in a certain measure this civilization that they can be said to be decayed. At a period, very early it may be, the Bushmen have found a modus vivendi, and, being satisfied with it, neither tried nor\n\n1 In his excellent paper quoted above.\nwished to change or improve it. It is not the only example of a population which, arrived at a certain degree of civilization, become stationary, being quite satisfied with that stage and considering it as the best attainment. Unfortunately for himself, the stage at which the Bushman chose to remain was not the best to enable him to resist the pressure of the new-comers. The area he covered formerly was much larger, and extended over regions now exclusively occupied by Hottentots and by Bantu; how far it extended in the interior we have no means of knowing, but we have some reason to suppose that the Bushman race occupied at one time the central part of the African continent.\n\nAnthropologically, strange to say, the Bushman offers all the characteristics of the Nigritos, especially of those of the Andaman Islands; the cranial similarity has already been noticed by Prof. Flower, though he explains it by supposing that the two populations have been arrested in their development at an early stage, and preserve an infantile character. The similarity is not confined to the skull, but extends to the principal characteristics we have enumerated\u2014colour of skin, formation and tint of the hair, absence of hair on the body, proportion of the limbs, smallness of the extremities, and reduced size of the stature.\\(^1\\)\n\nIs there in Africa any population with which the Bushmen may be connected? The central part of Africa is not yet enough known to enable us to answer this question with certainty.\\(^2\\) There was, however, a race, now nearly extinct or obliterated, which shows many of the same characteristics\u2014that is, the Egyptian race of the first dynasties. Of course it would be absurd to say that the Bushmen are the descendants of the Egyptians, or that the Egyptians were Bushmen, but it may be safely said that both populations\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Prof. W. H. Flower, *On the osteology and affinities of the natives of the Andaman Islands* in Journ. of the Anthropol. Inst., vol. ix. p. 108; Presidential Address, vol. xiv. p. 383; E. A. Mann, same publication, vol. xii. p. 74 et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) Some early Spanish maps of Africa, however, give the name of Bushmen to populations in the central part of the Continent. Are they the same as our Bushmen? We cannot say. Some utterances of Dr. Livingstone might, however, make us believe that it was so.\ncame from the same primitive stock and have been modified by crossing with other races, and many other causes. The Bushmen, like the Egyptians, have an exclusive natural graphic power, and, as a special physical characteristic, the tablier \u00e9gyptien. I, however, say that the Bushmen do not descend from the Egyptians, but only from the same race\u2014a kind of Nigritoide population. The Bushmen certainly never knew anything of Egyptian civilization, though some might be tempted to say they did; it is probable that they separated when still in a savage state, or rather that at that early period a group, separated and mixed with another race, formed the Egyptian race. It is now admitted by many that the mixed races are those which show the greatest aptitudes. What makes the supposition of such relationship less improbable is that the primitive home of the Egyptians appears to have been at the south of the equator, whence they gradually pushed northwards. The other tribes of this Nigritoide race remained probably in a state of barbarism, or adopted the lowest degree of community: they were pushed and pressed everywhere by all the populations of higher social organization, the ancestors of the Bushmen were thrown on the Hottentot population, whether or not this was indigenous or extraneous\u2014in their tales the Bushmen always speak of a previous population inhabiting the country\u2014and it is no doubt the inevitable infusion of Hottentot blood which has given them the few characteristics they have in common.\n\nIt may be said that in my statements there are many assumptions difficult to prove. I would, however, remark that they are rather inferences than conclusions, and that I have reached them through a long and slow process. Having no decided opinion, at first I examined carefully the opinions of every scholar, philologist, or traveller, and in many cases I stopped for awhile, accepting one of them, which I was nevertheless obliged to reject on further examination. Such may be\n\n1 This is the simplest explanation of the Egyptian tradition preserved in the classics, that, formerly, the sun used to rise at the right and set at the left; there are, besides, other evidences of the Austral origin of the Egyptians.\nthe fate which awaits my own conclusions, but if this paper has no other effect than to arouse the interest of scholars in the study of Bushman literature, and to induce one philologist to unbury from the Cape library and give to the world some of the texts so carefully collected by Bleek, I shall be satisfied with the result. I only wish that circumstances permitted me to visit Cape Town, examine the treasure there accumulated, and continue the interesting study of the Bushmen and their language.\n\nP.S.\u2014With reference to note 5, page 59 ante. Since the above was put in type, the following note from our Hon. Sec., Mr. R. N. Cust, has been communicated to me: \"Dr. F. M\u00fcller has informed me that he has in the press a grammar of two dialects of the Bushman.\" I regret not to have had knowledge of this before, as the above-named gentleman possesses, doubtless, new data to work on, and a grammar by so great a scholar could not fail to add much to our knowledge, and contain many valuable observations.\nART. IV.\u2014Inscriptions at Cairo and the Burju-z Zafar. By Henry C. Kay, M.R.A.S.\n\nA former number of this Journal (Vol. XIX. Part 2) contained a short account of the three monumental gates of Cairo, the chief, indeed almost the only, remaining memorials of the celebrated Fatimite Khalifate of Egypt. It included a copy of the Cufic inscription sculptured on the frieze of the gate, known by the name of Bab en Na\u1e63r, as far as I had then succeeded in reading it.\n\nOn a subsequent visit to Egypt, I applied to the local authorities for permission to put up a light scaffolding, admitting of a closer examination of the inscription. This was courteously granted, and enabled me to decipher the missing portions with which, until then, all my attempts had been completely baffled. Near inspection revealed the reason of the difficulty. The lettering was perfectly visible, but it was choked and disfigured by several layers of whitewash, applied at successive but unknown periods. There were traces to show that one of these layers had been a light sky-blue in colour, but the outer one had assumed a dark grey, so precisely the colour of the stone of which the gate is built, that seen from the ground below, its existence could hardly be suspected.\nThe following is a complete, and I think I may venture to say a correct copy of the inscription:\n\n\u0628\u0639\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u064a\u062d\u0627\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u0634\u0623 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u064a\u0637 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0633\u0629 \u062d\u0645\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u062a\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0633\u064a\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0635\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0647\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0644\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0634 \u0633\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0641\u0644 \u0642\u0636\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0647\u0627\u062f\u064a \u062f\u0639\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0645 \u0628\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0649 \u0639\u0636\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0646 \u0628\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062d\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u062a\u062f\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0645 (\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0648 \u0627\u064a\u0627\u0645) \u0648\u0634\u0645\u0644 \u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u064a\u063a\u0627\u062b \u062b\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0641\u0648\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0641\u0636\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0635\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0643\u0631\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0630\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u062d\u0645\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0630\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629\n\nIslam is encompassed about with the glory of God, the most Great, the Mighty. Raised for the defence of the walls, this gate of honour, and the walls (themselves) that encircle Al K\u0101hirah the Muizzite, the guarded, (may God protect it), were erected by the champion of our Lord and Master the Imam Al Mustansir-billah, Prince of the Faithful (Divine glory be upon him, on his fathers the pure Imams, and on his noble offspring), (by) the illustrious Lord, Commander of the Armies, Sword of Islam, Defender of the Faith, Protector of the Judges of the Muslims, and Guide of the Leaders of the Faithful, Abu-l Nijmi Badru-l Mustansiry. May God aid through him the Faith, and by prolonging his days, grant comfort to the Prince of the Faithful. May He perpetuate his power and raise his word on high\u2014he with whose righteous rule God hath fenced round the Empire and the age, whose justice encompasseth both high and low\u2014seeking the reward from God and His\napproval, imploring His grace and bounty, and protection to the throne of the Khalifate, and turning with prayer unto God to surround him with His divine favour. He was authorized to erect this gate in Mu\u1e25arram of the year 480.\n\nThe inscription is interspersed, though very sparingly, with ornaments. The characters are beautifully formed, and its undoubted date adds to its caligraphic and artistic interest. Through the care of Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole, a plaster cast of a portion is now in the South Kensington Museum.\n\nOn a visit, shortly afterwards, to the mosque and tomb of Sayyidah Nafisah, on the south of Cairo, I observed what seemed to be portions of a marble slab, with the remains of a Cufic inscription, which attracted my attention owing to their close resemblance to the inscription over Bab en Na\u1e63r. The slab had been cut up into slips, which are imbedded in mortar in the walls of the vestibule, in various positions, and some upside down. A reference to Al Makrizi\u2019s account of the mausoleum (vol. ii. p. 441) shows that in his days (A.D. 1359-1442) a marble slab existed over the gate with an inscription, of which he gives a full copy, and which is almost identically the same as that over Bab en Na\u1e63r. Apart from some slight verbal variations, for which the copyists of Makrizi\u2019s MS. are, it may be, chiefly responsible, the difference between the two is confined to the following points.\n\nThe inscription over the mausoleum, Makrizi tells us, commenced with the Bismillah, and proceeded as follows:\n\n\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0644\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0630 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u062a\u064a\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0635\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\n\nAssistance (and victory) from God, and speedy conquest unto the favoured servant of God, Ma\u2018add Abu Tam\u012bm, the Im\u0101m al Mustans\u012br-billah, Prince of the Faithful.

(The restoration was ordered) in the month of Rabi\u2019u-l \u1e0dakhir of the year 482.\n\nBadr al Jam\u0101li died in A.H. 487, aged about 80 years. He had appointed his son Shahin Shah, surnamed Al Af\u1e0dal, to succeed to his power and dignities, regal in all but the name. Al Af\u1e0dal was assassinated in A.H. 515. The gate of the mausoleum, Ma\u1e33rizi tells us, was plated with iron. The dome over the tomb was renovated, and the mihr\u0101b decorated with marble, by the Khalifah Al \u1e24afiz li din Illah in 532 (A.D. 1138).\n\nA short account of the life of Sayyidah Nafisah is given by Ibn Khallikan (De Slane\u2019s translation, vol. iii. p. 574). She died in A.H. 208 (A.D. 824), and she was buried in her house, in a grave constructed by herself. She was in the habit of retiring into it, occupying herself in repeated recitations of the whole of the Kur-\u0101n. She was thus engaged when she died, and she is said to have breathed her last\n\n---\n\n1 See also for the honorific titles of Al Af\u1e0dal and his successors, Al Ma\u1e33rizi, vol. i. pp. 442, 463, and vol. ii. p. 48.\nimmediately after uttering the following verse: \"Say, unto whom belongeth that which is in Heaven and upon Earth? Say, unto God. He hath prescribed unto himself the exercise of mercy\" (S. vi. 12). The first mausoleum over her grave was built by 'Obayd Allah ibn es Sari, governor of Egypt from A.H. 206 to 211.\n\nBefore concluding, I will allow myself to offer some brief remarks on that arch\u00e6ological puzzle, the Burju-\u017c \u017bafar. The name is popularly applied to a line of ruined walls and bastions, on the eastern side of Cairo, at but a short distance from Bab en Na\u1e63r, but it belongs more properly to the curiously-constructed tower at the north-east angle. The remains inclose a piece of ground which may at one time have formed part of the city, but which is now covered with heaps of rubbish, and presents a most desolate aspect.\n\nThe fortifications are well built, and the north-eastern tower in particular, with its domed octagonal hall, simple, but not altogether devoid of ornament, may at once be recognized as the work of an able and skilful architect. In style and appearance, but especially in its passages, it resembles Bab en Na\u1e63r and its vaulted staircases. But the theory that both constructions owe their existence to the same builder, or at least to the same period, seems excluded by the distinct and sufficiently authenticated statement of Al Ma\u1e33rizi and other historians, to the effect that the walls with which Badr al Jam\u0101li encircled the city were of crude brick, whilst the abandoned line of works consist of solid stone masonry. On the other hand, they greatly differ in appearance from the stone walls known to have been built by Saladin. No inscriptions are to be found, excepting the single word \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647', in a style of characters which affords no clue to a date. Nor do any local traditions throw any light upon the subject. But Al Ma\u1e33rizi has the following passage (vol. i. p. 380), which must doubtless refer to these remains:\nThe walls of Cairo were surrounded by a ditch. It was commenced from Bab al Fut\u00fbh, in the direction of Al Ma\u1e33s, in Mu\u1e25arram, 588. It existed likewise on the eastern side, extending from the exterior of Bab en Na\u1e63r to Bab al Barkliyah, and beyond it. I have seen some remaining traces of the ditch. Behind them is a wall of great thickness and towers, built of stone. But the ditch is filled up, and the walls that were behind it are demolished.\n\nThis wall is that mentioned by the K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b al F\u0101\u1e0dil in the writing he addressed to Sult\u00e2n \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ed d\u00een Y\u016bsuf ibn Ay\u016bb, in which he wrote as follows: And may God grant long life to our Lord and Defender, that the two cities may be inclosed in the encircling belt of his power, and that he may extend over them the canopy of his protection. For the wrists of no secluded beauty are allowed to be unbegirt with bracelets, nor her waist to be unadorned with a golden zone. Now are the minds of the people at rest, confiding in him for security against the hand of the plunderer and of the miscreant, whom no scruples restrain.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 By the two cities, Cairo and Mi\u1e63r are meant. The K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b, it must be observed, has chosen many words suggestive of a double meaning. Ni\u1e0d\u0101\u1e33 signifies a belt,\nThe latter passage must of course refer to the entire walls of the city. But Makrizi's remarks seem to indicate that he regarded the deserted portion as part of Saladin's work. The reason for their having been abandoned may perhaps be found in the fact that they are completely commanded by the high ground in front, which in one part advances so close to the line of works that it may almost be said to overhang them. But this, it is true, still leaves us to seek an explanation of how they ever came to be built in such a situation. A description of the Burju-z Zafar, with carefully executed plans, have been published by Professor Hayter Lewis, in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association, 1882.\n\nThe name, as popularly pronounced, Burju-z Zafar, \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0641\u0632\u0627\u0641, is correctly translated Tower of Filth, an extraordinary denomination, which it is hardly necessary to say cannot be the original one. Nor, it must be added, is there anything particularly appropriate in it. The place is remote from all habitation, and, in point of cleanliness, loses nothing by comparison with any other spot in or near Cairo. I think it exceedingly probable that we have to deal with a corruption of the word \u0632\u0627\u0641\u0631 Zafar, triumph or victory, and that the correct rendering is \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0641\u0631 the Tower of Victory. This is likewise the name of the Castle of the Pharos at Alexandria, built by Sultan Kait Bey (A.D. 1468-96), and Makrizi tells us (vol. i. p. 384) that one of the halls or pavilions of the Great Eastern Palace of Cairo, which stood at no great distance from the walls, bore the name of \u062a\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0641\u0631, the Palace of Victory.\n\nand also power or might. 'Akilah is applied to a woman kept in a state of seclusion, or to a jewel of great value; but the radical form 'Akil signifies a fortress or place of safety. Mi'jam signifies the wrist, and the verb 'aqama means to protect or defend or to seek refuge, whilst 'Asimah, from the same root, is used to signify a city. Sitcar, a bracelet, is, according to the author of the Taj al 'Arus, borrowed from the Persian dastawdr, but as an Arabic word it is classed as belonging to the same root as sur, plur. aswdr, the walls of a city.\nART. V.\u2014Gleanings from the Arabic. The Lament of Maisun, the Bedouin wife of Mu\u00e2wiya. By H. W. Freeland, M.A., M.R.A.S., late M.P., Commander of the Order of the Crown of Siam.\n\nMu\u00e2wiya, the sixth Khalif in succession after Muhammad, was the first of the fourteen Khalifs of the family which presided during a period of nearly a century over the destinies of the Saracenic Empire. His father, Abu-Sufian, was of the tribe of the Kuraish, a tribe to which Muhammad also belonged. Mu\u00e2wiya and his wife became followers of the Prophet on the same day as that on which the father of the former, who had previously commanded the forces of the enemy, announced his adherence to the new religion. By this conversion Muhammad received a great accession of strength, and was induced, in consideration of its importance, to grant two out of the three requests by which it was accompanied. The first was that Abu-Sufian might take the command of the army of the Faithful against the Infidels. The second, that his son, who afterwards became Khalif, might be appointed Secretary to the Prophet. The third, that Muhammad would vouchsafe to marry the second daughter of Abu-Sufian. The Prophet, however, who complied with the two former of these requests, refused to comply with the latter. Maisun, the Bedouin wife of Mu\u00e2wiya, was the daughter of Jandal, of the tribe of Kalb. She was a poetess of no mean power, as the poem of which the following is a paraphrase goes far to prove. The original lines are given with some inaccuracy in Carlyle's specimens of Arabian poetry and in Adler's edition of the\nAnnals of Abulfeda, the great Arabian historian. There appear to be different readings of these celebrated verses, and I was indebted to Faris Shidiak, the translator of the Bible and Prayer Book into Arabic, for two verses which, he assured me, belong to the poem, though not found in either of the texts referred to. I have not hesitated to incorporate them in the text and in my paraphrase, for they are so completely in the spirit of the others, that I cannot but think they originally formed part of, and ought never to have been separated from, the rest of the poem. They are verses 5 and 6 in the Arabic text.\n\nOne day the Khalif chanced to hear his wife singing the verses, which were certainly by no means flattering to him, so he said to her: \"Thou wast not content, O daughter of Jandal, until thou hadst called me a fat donkey. Get thee to thy family! Elhaki biahtiki (literally, join thy family).\" This was one of the forms of Mussulman divorce, and Maisun was divorced accordingly. So she went back to her desert and rejoined the Bani Kalb, and her son Yazid, who afterwards became Khalif, went with her.\n\n\u0642\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u062a \u062c\u0646\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0629\n\u0644\u0644\u0633 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u062f\u062a\u064a \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0643\u062a\u064a\n\u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0636\n\u0648\u0628\u064a\u062a \u062a\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0647\n\u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0636\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u064a\n\u0648\u0628\u0643\u0631 \u064a\u0628\u062a\u063a\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u063a\u0628\n\u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u063a\u0644 \u0632\u0639\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\n\u0648\u0643\u0628 \u064a\u0628\u062a\u063a\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0641 \u062f\u0648\u0632\u064a\n\u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0631 \u0623\u0644\u0648\u0646\u0628\n\u0648\u0623\u0646\u0632\u0644 \u0643\u0633\u0631\u062a\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0633\u0631\u062a\u064a\n\u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0641\u064a\u0642\n\u0648\u0623\u0646\u0632\u0644\u062a \u0623\u0632\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0642\u0645\u0631\n\u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0641\u0648\u0646\u0628\n\u0648\u062e\u0631\u062c\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0642\u064a \u0646\u062d\u064a\u062a\n\u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u062c\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0626\u064a\u0641\n\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062b \u064a\u0627 \u0622\u0628\u062a\u064a \u062c\u0646\u062f\u0644 \u062e\u062a\u064a \u062c\u0639\u0644\u062a\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u064b\n\u0625\u062d\u0643\u064a \u064a\u0627 \u0623\u0647\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u0645\u0633\u0643\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u0626\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0643\u0644\u0628 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0649 \u0645\u063a\u0647\u0627\nParaphrase.\n\nThe Lament of Maisun, the Bedouin wife of Mudwiya.\n\nI give thee all the treacherous brightness\nOf glittering robes which grace the fair,\nThen give me back my young heart's lightness\nAnd simple vest of Camel's hair.\nThe tent on which free winds are beating\nIs dearer to the Desert's child\nThan Palaces and kingly greeting\u2014\nO bear me to my desert wild!\nMore dear than swift mule softly treading,\nWhile gentlest hands his speed control,\nAre camels rough their lone way threading\nWhere caravans through deserts roll.\nOn couch of silken ease reclining\nI watch the kitten's sportive play,\nBut feel the while my young heart pining\nFor desert guests and watch-dog's bay.\nThe frugal desert's banquet slender,\nThe simple crust which tents afford,\nAre dearer than the courtly splendour\nAnd sweets which grace a monarch's board.\nAnd dearer far the voices pealing\nFrom winds which sweep the desert round\nThan Pomp and Power their pride revealing\nIn noisy timbrel's measur'd sound.\nThen bear me far from kingly dwelling,\nFrom Luxury's cold and pamper'd child,\nTo seek a heart with freedom swelling,\nA kindred heart in deserts wild.\n\nNote.\u2014Mr. Sabunjie informs me that in the Kamus, published at Beyrouth under the auspices of competent Muhammadan and Christian scholars, and approved by the 'Ulam\u00e1 of the Azhar at Cairo, the name of the father of Maisun is given as Jandal and not Bahdal, which latter is the name given by some of the earlier authorities. Jandal is also the name given in Lane's Arabic Dictionary.\nART. VI.\u2014Discovery of Caves on the Murghab. By Captains de Laesso\u00eb and the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E. With Notes by William Simpson, R.I., F.R.G.S., Hon. Assoc. R.I.B.A.\n\n(Forwarded through the late Mr. W. S. W. Vaux, Secretary R.A.S.)\n\nIn February last, Captain F. de Laesso\u00eb, who is attached as one of the Political Officers with the Afghan Boundary Commission, discovered an important group of caves at Penjdeh, and sent me a plan of them, which is here given; and with it the following letter, which contains an account of the discovery.\n\nPenjdeh, 27th February, 1885.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Simpson,\u2014There are a large number of caves at Penjdeh, but as a rule these caves consist of only one or two rooms, and it took a long time to discover and clear out the large group, of which I send you a rough plan.\u00b9 I have no drawing materials here, and I must ask you to excuse the manner in which it is done.\n\nOn a high hill in the range on the right bank of the Murghab the sandstone comes to the surface, and the cave is cut out in this rock, which at the time of excavation must have presented on the outside an almost vertical scarp; at present the outer layer has crumbled away, and the cliff has become a steep sandy slope. The group consists of a central vaulted passage 150 feet long by 9 feet wide, and about\n\n\u00b9 This plan, although bearing a resemblance to the one which appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, is not a copy, but is reproduced from a drawing by Captain de Laesso\u00eb, made when he first discovered the caves in February last, as the date of the letter to Mr. Simpson shows.\nPLAN OF YAKI DESHIK CAVES, PENJDEH ON THE MURGHAB.\n\nDrawn by Capt.

Other store rooms have only one entrance.\n\nhalf 4 feet high and 4 feet broad taking the whole width of the room. Cells 8-10 feet deep, about 2 feet in diameter.\n9 feet to the top of the pointed vault (see Pl. I. Fig. 1). Vaulted passages about 4 feet long, 2\u00bd feet wide, and 4 to 5 feet high, lead to rooms on both sides. These rooms are vaulted like the main passage, and are uniformly about 9 feet high. Walls and roofs are everywhere finely cut with a pickaxe, but not polished, and with no trace of plaster. Ornamentation is attempted in some of the rooms, the roof and walls being divided into 4\u20136 squares, of which every second is cut about an inch deeper than the neighbouring square. The rooms have been provided with small folding doors; the holes for wooden pegs at the bottom, and for a cross stick at the top are clearly cut, and a rectangular hole at the left side of each door would allow the owner to put in his arm for the purpose of opening it; the door evidently shut from within with a bolt, and probably opening with a wooden key. This arrangement still exists in certain parts of Persia. Every room, or double room (except Nos. XIV. and XVI., which probably are unfinished) (see Pl. I. Fig. 1), is provided with a well, about 2 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet deep. These wells are quite empty, with the exception of a layer of fine black dust (quite different from the rock) about a foot thick, such as would have been left if the wells had been for a long time filled with water brought up from the river. One well was entirely filled with black hard stamped earth, evidently brought up on purpose; it was dug out, but without resulting in any find. The different staircases shown in the plan lead to upper rooms, small, and roughly cut. In these rooms is a thick layer of fine brown dust, evidently decayed vegetable matter, all seems to indicate that they were store rooms. Only room No. VIIIb. has cells separated from the room by a semi-circular border of rock, 1 foot high in the centre and 4 feet at the ends, something like Fig. 2 (See Pl. I. Fig. 1).\n\nAs already mentioned, the vaults are all pointed (see section, Pl. I. Fig. 2) (except in a well-room, and an upper-room, which will be described afterwards). The beginning\nand the top of all vaults are marked by straight lines 2 inches deep and the same in breadth.\n\nThe staircase g leads to a suite of those large upper rooms, which are all carefully excavated. The central room is in the form of a cross, the central room being flat and round, while the four aisles have pointed vaults (see Pl. I. Fig. 3). a is a round excavation, marking the keystone of the vault. The two rooms adjoining this central cruciform chamber (see general plan of caves) are on a lower level; the one on the north being 5 feet below. The communications to these rooms are by roughly cut round apertures, large enough only for a man to pass through, and they have evidently been much used, as the surface is quite smooth and polished.\n\nI found a bag with one gold and about 100 silver coins, all from the eighth and ninth centuries; but this bag was found in the deposit very near the entrance, and before the floor of the vault had been come to. It seems to me clearly proved that the bag had been hidden there at a time when the caves had long been disused and the entrance already partly filled up. I suppose this money to have belonged to some inhabitant of a large ruined town situated below the hill with the caves. This town is about five miles long and one to two miles broad; it was brick built, and evidently abandoned in a hurry, as I find a quantity of copper utensils of all kinds, as well as a considerable number of copper coins, and at times gold and silver ones, wherever I dig. I hope a collection of these things will throw some light on the history of the town.\n\nI shall be glad to answer questions, or to have any suggestions regarding future work. Yours sincerely,\n\nF. de Laesso\u00eb.\nBefore making any remarks on this very remarkable group of caves discovered by Captain de Laesso\u00eb, I shall give some further account of caves in the same region. I accompanied Sir Peter Lumsden last winter to the Afghan Frontier, and was on the look-out for ancient remains, particularly of any that might date back to the Buddhist period, but as mud or sun-dried bricks seem to have been at all times the principal building material in that part of the world, nothing is left but mounds to mark the site of old towns. Excavations into these mounds may yet be productive of results. Coins and other objects\u2014perhaps the foundations of buildings\u2014may be found, but that is all that may be expected. Owing to the soft nature of the sandstone rock, which is peculiar to those parts of the Heri Rud and the Murghab, we travelled over, caves which have been excavated in it have, at least in the more external portions of them, suffered much from decay.\n\nThe first group of caves which came under my notice was on the right bank of the Heri Rud, opposite Dowlutabad, which may be about ten miles to the south of Sarakhs. They are in a sandstone scarp, about a quarter or half a mile from where the undulating ground sinks finally down into the great level plain of Central Asia. There may be about five or six caves at this spot; they are all on the same level, and may be thirty feet above the bank of the river. Being visible from Dowlutabad, I rode over, but found it impossible to ascend to them. There is a mass of rock in front which may at one time have been a stair, and there might have been a means of communication to them from above, but all has now crumbled away, so that I was unable to make an inspection. There was a small opening in the rock, which, from its size and position, I took to be a window, giving light to a cave, the entrance to which would be from one of the caves alongside.\n\nIt was not till we reached Bala Murghab that any other caves were noticed; we passed through Penjdeh in the beginning of December, but had no chance at that time of hearing of caves or of examining the locality. It was not till February following that Captain de Laesso\u00eb was there for\nsome time, and, as he has a knowledge of the Turkoman language, he was able to talk to the people, and thus got on the trail of the important discovery he has made. At Bala Murghab, Captain the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E., who is on the Survey Department of the Afghan Boundary Commission, discovered a small group of two caves. These are in the low hills on the left bank of the river, and not above a mile from where our winter camp stood; the ascent in this case was so difficult that I deemed it wisest not to make the attempt. Captain Talbot managed to get up, and made a plan with measurements, and gave me a copy of it, which is here given (see Pl. II. Fig. 1). The two caves were on the same level, but the front had through the action of time crumbled away. Below them there had been another very small cave, a few feet only of it was remaining, which presented a pointed arch, similar to that given in the section of those above (see Pl. II. Fig. 2).\n\nJust before leaving Bala Murghab we heard of another group of caves a few miles lower down on the left bank of the river, but we failed to visit them. I understand that they were in a very decayed state. Captain de Lass\u00e8 was told of some caves near Meruchak; and at Penjdeh the caves are numerous, he mentions a group called Besh Deshik (Delik?), which means 'Five Holes,' Yaki Deshik, the place he explored, meaning 'Two Holes.' He also heard of caves at a place called Gharebil, in the Chol or desert, about fifty miles to the east of Penjdeh. These statements will show that excavated caves are plentiful in the region. Our time was short, and the extent of our movements were very limited; had it been otherwise, I have little doubt, based on our slight experience, that a great many more would have been found. I have a strong presumption that many rock-cut caves exist, and if we had been able to extend our investigations among the higher slopes of the Koh-i-Baba range, there need be little doubt but many more would have been discovered. Our knowledge is all but limited to the magnificent city of caverns at Bamian, and although there is not likely to be another group like it, we may be certain that it is not the\nCAVES AT BALA MURGHAB.\n\nSmall holes occur in top of arch at intervals, three or four of them in the larger cave.\n\nThe natives call them \"Dev Kan,\" or Dug by the Spirits or Devs.\n\nSurveyed by Capt. The Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E.\nonly place where caves will be found when the country comes to be explored. Ferrier mentions some caves he visited at a place called Singlak, high up in the Koh-i-Baba, and above the sources of the Murghab. The following, from Ibn Batuta, seems to confirm this; he says: \"After this I travelled from Balkh for seven days, on the mountains of Kuhistan, which consist of villages closely built. In these are many cells of religious, and others who have retired from the world. I next came to the city of Herat, which is the largest inhabited city in Khorasan.\"\u2014Ibn Batuta, Dr. Lees' Translation, p. 94. This journey from Balkh to Herat was along the very district here referred to; but the words may just possibly refer to the 'cells' of Muhammadan fakirs; but the greater probability is that he means caves, as they would not be in such a decayed condition as they are now. Mr. Finn told me he has heard of some wonderful caves, with pillars and inscriptions, near Khaff\u2014that is, within the Persian frontier\u2014which he hopes to visit, and he has promised to send me an account of them. These statements contain all that I have chanced to learn regarding the rock-cut caves in the northern part of Afghanistan.\n\nRegarding the origin of these caves, I think there can be little doubt but that they are Buddhist. Hiouen-Thsang gives us information about the places he passed through in Central Asia, coming to India, and on his return, from which we know that Buddhism had extended beyond the Hindu Kush and the Paropamissus. At Balkh, which is not much over 200 miles to the east of the Murghab, he found about a hundred viharas and 3000 monks. Among the relics of Buddha they had stupas containing a tooth, a portion of hair, cuttings from the finger-nails, the robe, the staff, the broom, and a dish. The two men who, according to the legend, received these objects from Buddha, when he was in the Deer Forest at Benares, were at the same time instructed regarding the form of the stupas, and on their return to Balkh these monuments were erected, and Hiouen-Thsang states that these were the first which were raised in honour of the Law\nof Buddha. As we know that stupas were erected before the time of Buddha, those at Balkh could not have been the primitive models; but we may conclude from the legend the high probability that these monuments at Balkh were constructed in imitation of those in India. If the stupas were built in imitation of Indian ones, we have greater reason to believe that caves would be excavated under similar motives. As Balkh was thus evidently a great stronghold of the religion of Buddha, it gives us every reason to believe that Buddhism would not be confined to that town, but extended, at least, along the whole of what is now known as Afghan Turkestan. The Chinese pilgrim unfortunately did not pass along this country, so we are without information about it; he only states that there was a stupa 70 li to the west of Balkh. On his return journey he passed through Badakshan, and found convents in that direction. With such information before us, we may assume as all but certain that Buddhism existed westward along the northern slopes of the Koh-i-Baba range. This pilgrim states that there were convents and monks in Persia at the time of his journey\u2014early part of the seventh century; but as the frontier of that country was not likely to be near the Heri Rud, this information does not help us much.\n\nThe Bamian caves are to my mind a very strong evidence that those on the Murghab belonged to the same faith. Large cities imply the existence of towns and villages; and the extensive group at Bamian, which we know were Buddhist, were not likely to be the only ones in that region.\n\nI have here dwelt somewhat particularly on what may be called the circumstantial evidence regarding the character of the newly-discovered caves, because as yet our knowledge of them is too small to speak with certainty from the character of the caves themselves. No sculptures, nor paintings, have been found to help us as data; in the Bala Murghab caves there are a couple of representations scratched on the wall (see Pl. II. Figs. 3 and 4), but they seem to represent houses or buildings of some kind; the form and arrangement of the caves are somewhat different from\nthose we already know to be Buddhist. A few years ago I gave a paper to the Royal Asiatic Society on the Buddhist Caves of Afghanistan; by means of the drawings given in that paper it will be seen that the caves of the Jellalabad Valley were most probably copied from the early form of caves found at Buddha Gaya. Among them was one exception, and it was an evident imitation of one of the Vihara caves of Western India. We are all familiar with the first efforts of a child to copy a good drawing, and such was this Vihara cave as a replica. It must have been excavated from the description given by some one who had seen those in India, and very roughly done. The caves of the Murghab valley may have been cut out under similar inspiration, as we know from Hiouen-Thsang was the case with the stupas at Balkh. This supposition of copying and recopying will easily explain the differences between the newly-discovered caves and those of the Jellalabad valley, these last again, in their turn, having been copied from those in India. The Jellalabad caves thus become an important connecting link, helping so far to explain the caves at Penjdeh and Bala Murghab.\n\nThe Jellalabad caves vary in arrangement and in size, and may be described as simple arched recesses, averaging about 20 feet in length, by 10 feet wide, and 12 feet in height. In some cases a couple of these caves are connected by a passage behind. Captain de Laesso\u00eb describes the principal chambers of the Yaki Deshik group as 'vaulted,' most of them being about 15 long and 9 feet wide; some are 18 feet, and one, No. V., Pl. I. Fig. 1, is 19 feet. These chambers I take to be only repetitions of the Jellalabad caves, the original type of which will be found in the Barabar caves near Buddha Gaya. At Jellalabad the caves were cut into a perpendicular scarp, and being open in front received the light; the two caves at Bala Murghab seem to have been excavated according to this idea. The Yaki Deshik group appears to me to be an imitation of one very exceptional arrangement of caves I\n\n---\n\n1 See Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Vol. XIV. Part 3.\nfound in the Jellalabad valley. This was opposite the junction of the Surkhab with the Kabul river, which may be called the Pheel Khana caves; in Vol. XIV. Pl. 4 of the Journal of this Society a plan of them will be found. This particular group of caves, which form part of a larger group, are known at the present day as the 'Bazaar,' from a long connecting tunnel by which they are approached. The caves in this case had their fronts opening out through a high scarp overlooking the Kabul river, and the tunnel was cut through the rock behind, each cave having a doorway from it; but the tunnel here had another object to serve, which was the real motive of its construction. At the extremity of the caves is a large niche in the scarp overlooking the river, in which there was no doubt a gigantic Dhyana Buddha, it may have been about 30 feet high. The tunnel leads towards this niche, where by means of a terrace cut in the rock, of which slight vestiges only remain, worshippers could pass round to the statue and perform their devotions in front of it. As the Pheel Khana caves must have been a remarkable group, with a celebrity in the regions round; for I believe that in addition to the caves there were built viharas on the hills above them, as well as a number of large stupas\u2014the ruined remains of a very fine one still exist\u2014the fame of such a spot must have spread, and I take it that the Yaki Deshik group had, as a motive for its construction, to have an equally attractive spot on the Murghab. There is a niche at the end of the long gallery at Yaki Deshik, which would no doubt contain a figure of Buddha at one time. It must be understood that no assumption of certainty is entertained in what is here said, for until we receive details of other caves in the region, and more particularly of the Bamian caves, to give us a broader basis of knowledge, all speculation must be tentative.\n\nIt will be noticed that, although there would be a small amount of light towards the outward end of the long gallery of the Yaki Deshik group, the chambers leading from it would all be in complete darkness. This must have necessitated the constant use of lamps. Many of the cells of the\nVihara caves on the western side of India are very dark, still in all there was some glimmer of light which could enter. I do not remember any evidence that the caves of India had doors to them. In the Tibetan monasteries, which are built, the monk's cells have doors. The well in each chamber is another feature which is new. At Ajunta the caves are in a narrow valley with a stream of water; and I have a faint recollection of noticing a channel which brought the water from some point higher up, so that it ran past close to the front of some of the caves. At Penjdeh the caves were some distance from the river, and hence the necessity for a means of keeping a supply of water, which would have to be carried up to them. The pointed form of the arch is, so far as I can remember, not found in the Jellalabad caves, for the Buddhist arch, as we know from numerous examples in India, was a circular one. It may have come from the west, but wherefrom is the difficulty. Characteristic features of this kind in the past were seldom accidental; however rudely done, such forms were generally copied from something that was known, and it is difficult to believe that the pointed arch came eastward before the Arab conquest, which wiped Buddhism out of existence when it came. In the section given by Captain de Laesso\u00eb (see Pl. I. Fig. 2), there is one small bit of detail which, if correctly represented, goes far to prove the copying process which has been suggested; that is the slight 'drip' at the spring of the arch. This is a marked feature of the Jellalabad Caves, and it is found in some of the oldest rock-cut caves of India. Captain de Laesso\u00eb says the caves were without plaster, those at Bala Murghab were also without any indication of it. The Jellalabad caves were thickly coated, and the surface painted with figures and ornament.\n\nIn the two caves at Bala Murghab are some rudely cut recesses, which bear a strong likeness in size as well as in their position to what will be found in the Jellalabad examples. There is also a very curious connected passage between the two caves, which were described to me by Captain Talbot as being so narrow that it was very difficult\nto pass through. Captain de Lasso\u00eb describes the apertures of some upper chambers at Penjdeh as being similarly narrow and difficult of access. Security from attack in times of danger may have been the motive, otherwise it is difficult to explain for what object these passages were thus made.\n\nThe interest attaching to these caves results from their giving us the first knowledge we have received of monuments of Buddhism from a new region; and it is to be hoped that it will not be the last. Before leaving the Afghan frontier I talked to the officers of the Survey Department to keep a look out for caves and other remains, and I believe they will do their best to send accounts of anything they may chance to discover. When at Bala Murghab, being comparatively near to Bamian, I was anxious to visit that place. My plan was to go east to Balkh, and then pass on to India by Bamian. Sir Peter Lumsden, who knew my wishes in this matter, was desirous to assist, and most kindly consulted the Afghan authorities to give me permission, but unfortunately they were not favourable to the proposal, and reluctantly I had to abandon the idea. Whether they thought of danger to myself in such a journey, or had political motives in view, I cannot say; but I deeply regret their opposition to my plans. However, I trust that the time is not far distant when some one will be able to send us drawings of that wonderful spot, and its colossal figures and caves, which, we ought to expect, will throw considerable light on Buddhism as it existed in that part of the world.\nART. VII.\u2014The Alchemist. A Persian Play. Translated by Guy le Strange, M.R.A.S.\n\nPrefatory Note.\n\nThe Alchemist is one of a series of plays lithographed at Tehran, in 1874, by Mirza Ja'afar, a native of Karajeh-Dagh. They are his translation from an Azerbaijani-Turkish original, written by Mirza Fath-'Ali, of Derbend, and first published at Tiflis in 1861. In conjunction with Mr. Haggard, some few years ago, I had occasion to edit, with a translation, the first in order of these plays. Recently, an excellent edition in Persian of three more of Mirza Ja'afar's comedies, and among them \"The Alchemist,\" has appeared under the auspices of two well-known French scholars. They have, however, deemed it advisable not to append a translation, writing that \"il nous a paru plus sage d'habituer l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 se passer d'un secours dont il est toujours tent\u00e9 d'abuser:\" but it has occurred to me that those not conversant with Persian may be pleased to have yet another of these plays set before them in English dress.\n\nThe Plays, as noticed in the introduction to the \"Vazir of Lankur\u00e2n,\" where an abstract of the verbose Persian preface was given, appeared originally in the dialect of Turkish known as Azeri, which is spoken in Russian Armenia and the North-Western provinces of\n\n---\n\n1 The Vazir of Lankur\u00e2n. Edited, with a translation, notes, and a vocabulary, by W. H. D. Haggard and G. le Strange. London, 1882.\n2 Trois Com\u00e9dies Persanes. Publi\u00e9es avec un glossaire et des notes par C. Barbier de Meynard et S. Guyard. Paris, 1886.\nPersia. The French Consul at Tabriz has recently been able to obtain some short biographical notes concerning both the original author and his Persian translator. These notes Monsieur Barbier de Meynard has inserted in his preface, and we take the liberty of transcribing them in this place.\n\nMirza Fath-'Ali, the author, appears by his name of \"Akhund-z\u00e2deh,\" to have been the son of a village Mull\u00e2 or Domine, of the Caspian province of Darbend. He enlisted in the Russian army of the Caucasus, and ultimately worked his way up to the rank of Captain; then settled at Tiflis, the capital of Russian Trans-Caucasia, where he gave himself up to the study of the sciences and arts of the West, recently introduced under the auspices of the Governor-General Waransoff. His imagination appears to have been especially struck by the theatrical representations inaugurated here in a Government building about the year 1850; and, in the hope of seeing his plays performed on these boards\u2014a hope destined never to have been fulfilled\u2014he wrote in succession six dramas, and a sort of historical dialogue: these, all in Azeri-Turkish.\n\nAt Tiflis he seems to have made the acquaintance of Mirza Ja'afar, a Persian, who had come thither a pilgrim on his way to Mekka. Mirza Ja'afar, however, had in Tiflis come across certain philosophic free-thinking Persians, who so indoctrinated him with their lax views as to make him give up all idea of continuing his pilgrimage to the Holy City. He joined their mystical society, and, settling in the Caucasus, ultimately obtained some post in the Russian Administration. Here he translated his friend's plays into Persian, and died in 1883, leaving behind him a fortune of ten thousand tom\u00e2ns (about \u00a34000), which his relatives in Persia, hearing of, did not fail to journey to the Caucasus in order to claim. Of Mirza Fath-'Ali's death no notice is taken, and perchance the worthy Turkish dramatist is still living, and writing of his favourite maxim that Castigat ridendo mores. In any case it is to be regretted that his plays were never acted, for they are extremely humorous and not want-\ning in originality. The three which have recently appeared under the editorship of Messieurs Barbier de Meynard and Guyard are called respectively *The Thief-Taker*, *The Attorneys*, and *The Alchemist*.\n\nIn *The Thief-Taker* (Duzd-afkan) the scene is laid in the Caucasus provinces, where the Tartar peasantry (let the Russian Government do what it will) appear not yet to have been weaned from their old habits of brigandage. The mishaps which befall a German who is travelling with performing bears amongst these people, who try to rob him and are themselves in turn set upon by the bears, gives rise to some comical situations. Matters are ultimately set straight on the appearance of the Russian official\u2014the *Deus ex machina*\u2014who makes them all a touching speech on the benefits effected by Muscovite civilization.\n\n*The Attorneys* gives a humorous representation of what takes place in a Moslem law-court, and in truth is but little exaggerated. The roguery of the lawyers, the ignorance of the judge, and the venality of his apparitors, are all cleverly depicted, and in fact the scenes are taken from the very life.\n\nOf *The Alchemist* little need be said, as it follows here, and it is only necessary to remark that alchemists and astrologers are gentry still common in Persia, for in that pleasant country adepts may be met with, at the present day, who continue the search after the Philosopher's Stone, and those who herein have lost the largest sums are the least likely it may be observed to have lost their faith in the certain transmutation of the baser metals into gold.\nTHE ALCHEMIST: A PERSIAN PLAY.\n\nThe History of Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, the Alchemist.\nA Play founded on Facts,\nSet forth and concluded in Four Acts.\n\nDramatis Person\u00e6.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, of Kaldak,\u00b9 the Alchemist.\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, of S\u00e2m\u00fbk, his Assistant.\nDarv\u00eesh \u2018Abb\u00e2s, the Persian, his Servant.\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem, of Nakh\u00fb, the Goldsmith.\nAgh\u00e2 Zam\u00e2n, of Nakh\u00fb, the Doctor.\nMull\u00e2 Salm\u00e2n, the Son of Mull\u00e2 Jal\u00eel, a learned man of Nakh\u00fb, of portly and imposing presence.\nMashad\u00ee Jabb\u00e2r, of Nakh\u00fb, the Merchant.\nSafar Beg, of Nakh\u00fb, a Landed Proprietor.\nShaikh S\u00e2lih, of Kh\u00e2chmaz.\u00b2\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee, of Nakh\u00fb, a Poet.\n\nAct I.\u2014The Scene of the First Act is laid at the house of H\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem, the Goldsmith, in the town of Nakh\u00fb, during the spring time of the year 1248.\u00b3 H\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem, the Goldsmith, has invited friends to his house to meet Shaikh S\u00e2lih, of Kh\u00e2chmaz, who has lately arrived in the town of Nakh\u00fb, and who has come at the Goldsmith\u2019s invitation. H\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee, the Poet, who has not been invited, by accident comes in also. The company are discovered seated, dressed in their every-day clothes. Shaikh S\u00e2lih wears a turban, and holds in his hand a long chaplet of beads, which he twirls between his fingers. H\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem is facing the company, and exposing the matter in hand.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem, the Goldsmith. Do your worships know why I have invited you here?\n\nMashad\u00ee Jabb\u00e2r, the Merchant. No, not at all.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem, the Goldsmith. I have some fresh news to\n\n\u00b9 All these places are in the Caucasus Province. Kaldak is an Armenian village in the Karabagh Hills, near Erivan; S\u00e2m\u00fbk is a town on the K\u00fbr (Cyrus) River, not far from Ganja, or Elizabethpol; and Nakh\u00fb (or Nakh\u00ee) is the chief town of the district lying to the south-east of Tiflis.\n\u00b2 Kh\u00e2chmaz is a village lying to the south-east of Nakh\u00fb. The title of Shaikh here implies that this personage was Chief of a Darvish College.\n\u00b3 A.D. 1832.\ngive you. They say that Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem, of Kaldak, who went to Tiflis to obtain his authorization, has returned and set up his tent in the Kh\u00e2chmaz Hills, where he practises Alchemy. For instance, he has prepared a substance which they call the Elixir, and when he puts a drachm of this into a stone-weight of brass, it turns to pure silver.\n\nAgh\u00e2 Zam\u00e2n, the Doctor. I too have heard of this.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kart\u00een, the Goldsmith. Shaikh S\u00e2lih, with his own eyes, saw how the Armenians of Ikli\u0161 brought in twenty-five thousand stone-weight of copper coin, and received there for from Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel fifty poods of silver and carried it away. Is not this so, O Shaikh?\n\nShaikh S\u00e2lih. Yee truly, by the Kur\u00e2n which I study! I saw it with my own eyes. And every one who brought Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel his coin, received and carried off, double the weight in ingots of pure silver.\n\nSafar Beg, the Landowner. Why should not we too then go and get some?\n\nMull\u00e2 Salman. Although I keep no actual cash, yet as I am a friend of H\u00e2j\u00ee Rah\u00eem, the Money Lender\u2014if you are satisfied with a loan for a year at 12 per cent. interest and will give proper security\u2014I can get from him both for you and for myself as much money as we like.\n\nMashadi Jabb\u00e2r, the Merchant. I myself, Mull\u00e2, have money; but it is all out in business, and it is very difficult to get it back in hand so quickly. So, if it be possible, get me too a thousand stone-weight of copper,\u2014I have got two shops that I will leave in pledge for it.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kart\u00een. Get another thousand stone, as well, for me. I will give a mortgage on my house.\n\nAgh\u00e2 Zam\u00e2n, the Doctor. And another thousand for me; and my wife\u2019s garden shall be the pledge.\n\nSafar Beg, the Landowner. And let him give me, too, a thousand; and let my village stand in pledge to him for it.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbrt, the Poet [suddenly pulling a paper out of his pocket]. Your worships, it\u2019s a fine subject, that of the Lezg\u00ee\n\n---\n\n1 A village near Eriv\u00e2n.\n2 The Russian \u201cpood\u201d weighs about two stone.\nAv\u00e2rs, under the leadership of Kh\u00e2n B\u00fbt\u00e2i, who came some sixty years back and raided Nakh\u00fb. I have set it to verse. Now listen while I read it; and you will note how eloquently and rhetorically I have turned it.\n\nAgh\u00e2 Zam\u00e2n, the Doctor. Fie! H\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee! Is this a fit time for declaiming poetry? We assemble to talk and take counsel, and then here comes a man who begins, \u2018I have put into verse the events of sixty years ago\u2014how the Lezgis came and how they went!\u2019 What interest has all this for us?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee, the Poet [ vexed ]. How \u2018What interest has it for us?\u2019 You will see what misfortunes the Lezgis at that time brought down on your ancestors\u2019 heads, and what inhumanities they perpetrated. And is the knowledge of past events of no interest to you?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kart\u00eem, the Goldsmith [ soothingly ]. Now, H\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee, this is not exactly the time for reading poetry; another day, at your leisure, you can read it to us. At present, look here and tell us whether or no you think it advisable this going to Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel and this buying of silver. Does not your good sense approve of this business?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee, the Poet [ sullenly ]. Not at all.\n\nMull\u00e2 Salm\u00e2n. And for what reason?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee, the Poet. For this reason, that each one\u2019s profession must be for him his own Elixir, and his means of livelihood: so what need is there to go running after Alchemists? I have not seen Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, but I know by experience that he is just setting up a shop for befooling people. Even though he has been to Tiflis, as \u2019tis said, who is it that has given him permission to practise Alchemy? Who has seen his Alchemy? There can be no Elixir in this material world. But this Shaikh S\u00e2lih, who comes from Kh\u00e2chmaz, has bereft you of your wits to such a point that you believe his words, and so will not give credence to anything that I may say.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kart\u00eem, the Goldsmith. But there is proof that a great deal of Elixir exists in this material world, and so there is no need of discussing that matter. But just you prove in\nwhat way each one's profession is to be his Elixir! Why here I am a goldsmith, and I am unable to make sufficient for my daily expenses!\n\nH\u0101j\u012b N\u016br\u012b, the Poet. Because you have lost credit with people, and so no one will confide his business to you. In times back, whatever gold or silver they brought to you to work up into ornaments, you stole more than half of it, and supplied the place with brass or copper, and so returned it to the owner. At last, your tricks were exposed to the light of day, and now nobody brings his business to you. Had you acted honestly, you would assuredly have been a rich man by to-day.\n\nAgh\u0101 Zam\u0101n, the Doctor. Well, and why am I without means?\n\nH\u0101j\u012b N\u016br\u012b, the Poet. Because you have abandoned your proper profession, and gone into a business that you know nothing about. Medicine was not your profession. Your father, Ust\u0101d\u00b9 Rahm\u0101n, the Barber, by means of his hone and his razor, accumulated a reasonable fortune, which you have spent. The worthy man had, with immense pains, taught you to be a good barber. But you were not content with this. You wanted, after the fashion of the Tiflis barbers, to have a reputation as a doctor. But after killing a whole graveyard-full of men, people have got to understand your method, and now keep away from you. At present you are neither barber nor doctor. How often have I not advised you to go to the Russian doctors, and learn from them the medicines for fever, and leave off giving melon-water as the sole remedy?\u2014but you never will listen.\n\nAgh\u0101 Zam\u0101n [apologetically]. They told me that the Russian doctors use Khleb and sol\u00b2 as the remedy for fever. I have inquired of those who know the Russian language as to what sol is. They say, \"salt.\" But can salt be the specific against fever?\n\nMull\u0101 Salm\u0101n [stopping Agh\u0101 Zam\u0101n's mouth]. For\n\n\u00b9 Ust\u0101d, literally Master.\n\u00b2 Khleb sol is Russian for \"Bread and salt,\" presented by the host to the incoming guest.\nHeaven's sake, don't talk, and make an exhibition of your folly. That salt is quite different from this salt. [Turning to H\u00e1j\u00ed N\u00fbrt] According to what you have been saying, H\u00e1j\u00ed N\u00fbr\u00ee, I at any rate ought to have become a K\u00e2r\u00fbn.\u00b9 Now why is it that I only possess a mat and a water-jar?\n\nH\u00e1j\u00ed N\u00fbrt, the Poet. That, too, has its reason. Just because your build would fit you so well to be a muleteer, it has, forsooth, got into your head that your father having been a Mull\u00e2, therefore you must be a Mull\u00e2 too. Your father had studied, and, having ability, had risen to be a Mull\u00e2, but you, who are not capable of writing your own name even, how can you become a teacher and preacher? Ability is not like the father's fur coat, which comes down by inheritance to the children. And therefore it is that you are not esteemed among the people. And how should you become rich? Why, if with your strength and your stature you had only taken to being a muleteer, you would barely have been content with gaining your hundred and fifty roubles a year by this time!\n\nSafar Beg, the Landowner. And why am I not rich?\n\nH\u00e1j\u00ed N\u00fbrt, the Poet. You own land, and you should get your wealth by attending to the sowing and the reaping. But you, to your loss, have given yourself up to idle talk, throwing yourself first into this matter and then into that; speaking evil of people behind their backs, and worrying the Government officials with silly petitions about evil-doers and oppressed innocents. At last, having let your pen run riot, you were for three years in the clutches of the law, and then three years more spending great sums of money to get free. So your life has been passed. And now you expect to get rich all of a sudden through this lying Alchemist! Just like Mashad\u00ee Jabb\u00e2r there, who, in his excess of cupidity, lent out his petty scrapings to people at an exorbitant interest so as to become a capitalist, all in a minute; but now he would be well content if he could only once more lay his hands on the principal.\n\n\u00b9 The K\u00e2r\u00fbn of the Kur\u00e2\u00ee is identical with the Biblical Korah, who headed the rebellion against Moses in the Wilderness. In Moslem legend he is proverbial for his wealth, as we say of Croesus.\nH\u00e1ji Kar\u00edm, the Goldsmith. Well, master Poet, even granting that all of us have made mistakes, and have not made full profit each by his trade: still you yourself do not seem to get any very agreeable income from your own profession! If you get your dinner, you go without your breakfast! If you get your breakfast, you go without your dinner! According to what you have said, your talent\u2014which is to make verses\u2014ought to become the Great Elixir in your case too?\n\nH\u00e1ji N\u00far\u012b, the Poet. Yes; my talent in truth should be the Elixir. But just as you say that, for the Elixir you were talking of, it is necessary to have base metal on which it may exert its potency,\u2014even so, in the matter of my talent, it is likewise necessary to find men of taste and culture and understanding, in order that the grandeur of my verses may be appreciated. But seeing that through my evil fortune I find myself in the midst of such fellow-townsmen as you are, without intelligence or culture, and with neither taste nor appreciation, what gain could there be expected from a talent such as mine? and what can my poetry avail me?\n\nH\u00e1ji Kar\u00edm, the Goldsmith. How he does blunder about! What rubbish he talks! Who invited you to come and give advice to all of us here? And look now, where have you got all this philosophy of yours from? Be off outside; for we don\u2019t want your advice.\n\nThe other Guests [altogether]. Get up and go! We don\u2019t need your advice!\n\nH\u00e1ji N\u00far\u012b, the Poet [picking up his paper of verses in a hurry and putting it under his arm]. I\u2019m off\u2014words of truth are bitter! [Exit.]\n\nH\u00e1ji Kar\u00edm, the Goldsmith. Well, your worships, we are all agreed. The money must be ready by the beginning of next week, and then we will set off by road to the Kh\u00e2chmaz Hills, and present ourselves before Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khalil.\n\nThe Guests [altogether]. Yes, we are all agreed.\n\nThe Curtain Falls.\nAct II.\u2014The Scene of the Second Act is laid in the Khachmaz Hills. In a level meadow among the foot-hills, where the herbage is beautified with sweet-smelling flowers of every hue, two tents are pitched, at a distance of fifty paces each from the other. On a lower level than the tents stands a four-walled hut of wood, in the interior of which is seen a large forge. Conveniently placed, near the forge, are the bellows, and all around are lying fractured ingots of brass, in great lumps, as though the metal had been poured hastily into moulds and had been about to become silver. In front of one of the tents is a second\u2014smaller\u2014hut. Above, the meadow runs up into the mountains, which are snow-capped. On the further side is seen a valley, and a small river flows through it, on either side of which are clumps of oak and hazel trees of a hundred years growth, the leaves rustle in the blowing of the breeze, while birds of all sorts flit about from branch to branch and fill the valley with the melody of their harmonious song. On the other side to the meadow a spring gushes from a stoney basin, and with a gentle melancholy murmur flows down towards the valley, its waters sparkling here and there as they wend their way. To the eastward of the meadow spreads a boundless plain, running down to the Caspian Sea.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel occupies one of the tents, and in the other is Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, his assistant. In the smaller hut is his servant, Darv\u00eesh \u2018Abb\u00e2s, seated amongst the tools and utensils. It is two hours after sunrise, and the sun\u2019s rays are gradually dispersing the mist which lies in the valley. Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, the Alchemist, coming out of his tent, calls towards that of Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, leaving his own tent, goes to him and stands respectfully before him. Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel is the first to speak.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, according to what Shaikh S\u00e2lih wrote, ought not those people from Nakh\u00fb to arrive here, in the afternoon to-day?\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Yes, master, or even earlier.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. When these people come, Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, pay them every respect. Make them take seat in the tent, and inquire after their health. Ask them why\nthey have come, and if they say that they have brought copper coin and want to buy silver, then answer them, 'My master gave all the silver of the last melting to the Armenians of Iklis, and the silver of this next melting too, which we have now in hand, he has already disposed of to them. Further it requires a month to complete the preparation of the Elixir for this second melting. You have therefore given yourselves the trouble to come quite uselessly, for my master will neither receive the copper money from you, nor give you silver in return.' And then if they want to see me, say further to them, 'My master is in retirement during three days for meditation, and is now occupied with his prayers; therefore, for three days it is impossible for him to receive people or answer inquiries.'\n\nMull\u00e1 Hamtd. Why do you tell me to do this, master? If I talk to them in this manner, it is very probable that they will take their money and go away with it.\n\nMull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1l\u00ed. You are a wondrous idiot! Are you going to teach me the ways of the people of Nakh\u00fa? Why if you killed them, they would not leave this place without having seen me and given me the money; so go and do exactly as I have told you. [He returns to his own tent.]\n\nMull\u00e1 Hamtd [after him]. On my eyes be it, master!\n\n[Time passes, and it is now but two hours to sunset. The people of Nakh\u00fa appear, and Mull\u00e1 Hamtd, coming out of his tent, advances to meet them.]\n\nThe Nakh\u00fa people. Peace be on you!\n\nMull\u00e1 Ham\u00edd [to them]. The peace be upon you. You are welcome! What delight you give me! Be pleased to take your repose in the tent.\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fa people [to Mull\u00e1 Hamtd]. We were very desirous of seeing you. Is your health good? Is your nose fat?\u00b9\n\nMull\u00e1 Hamtd. Praise be to Allah! In such a pleasant, cool spot as this, how could my nose be otherwise than fat?\n\n\u00b9 The literal translation of the Persian expression. It means \"Are you well?\"\nParticularly, too, in the service of such a great man as Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel!\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people. Ah well, one often finds places as pleasant as this; but so great a man as Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel one does not come across everywhere! Can we to-day have the honour of visiting his worship?\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Our master has gone into retirement for three days, and is taken up with his devotions. It is impossible for him during these three days to give an interview to any one, or to talk, or to come out. But you can see him at the end of three days. And now be pleased to tell me the purpose of all the trouble you have given yourselves. Is it merely to make a visit to his worship, or have you some other matter too?\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people. In the first place, our sole aim is to visit his worship! But secondly, each of us has brought a trifling donation to offer to him, and if he will accept it, perchance he will not be stinting to us of his favour!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Well I understand. No doubt you have brought copper money, and you want to buy silver. Now the truth of the matter is that our master, Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, will not take the money from you. The silver that came from the last melting, and also all that which is now under our hands, is already disposed of to the Armenians of Ikl\u00ees, and for the double weight of silver that is to be given, a single weight of copper coin has already been received by us. And still another month must pass before the completion of the Elixir for this second melting. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for our master either to receive your money or to give you silver. Especially since the applicants for silver have become so numerous that the silver of each month's melting is sold a month in advance.\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people. Our feelings of devotion to our master, Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, have nothing to do with the fact of others being his humble servants too! If we could only see him, his very self, all would be quite right!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. In that case you must have patience for three days, until the time of our master's retirement has\ndrawn to an end. You shall be my honoured guests for three days!\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people. Very well! Certainly!\n\nAt this moment, Darv\u00eesh 'Abb\u00e2s appears out of his hut. He is a man of about thirty, his long hair falls over his shoulders, his complexion is yellow, his beard is spare, and his moustaches are cut off. He is tall, wears the conical cap\\(^1\\) on his head, and a leopard-skin over his shoulders; in one hand is a horn for blowing,\\(^2\\) and under his arm he holds a red-feathered fowl.\\(^3\\) Intoning in a terrific voice the words,\n\nY\u00e2 H\u00fb, Y\u00e2 Hakk!\\(^4\\)\n\nhe marches up behind the tents, and at a convenient spot drives a tent-peg into the ground. Thrice he blows his horn, and the echoes come back from rock and hill. Then he fastens the cock to the tent-peg, and declaims in a loud voice these three couplets from the poems of Shaikh Sa'adi:\\(^5\\)\n\n'Tis a fair day of springtide, Arise! and enjoy what the day bringeth forth,\nRely not on days yet to dawn, or that springtide will come back again.\nBut arise now! and count as thy gain the breath of this soft vernal breeze,\nThe bright tuneful song of the bird, the perfume so sweet of the flower,\nIn the sight of the man that is wise, who regardeth the leaf of the tree,\nEach leaflet is truly a page proclaiming aloud the Creator.\n\nHe blows again three blasts on the horn, then spreads the leopard-skin on the grass at a distance of about ten paces\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Such as Darvishes usually wear\n\\(^2\\) Darvishes generally carry a cow-horn, or conch, for sounding before they call for alms.\n\\(^3\\) Monsieur Barbier de Meynard takes occasion to point out in a note that the presence of the cock, in this incantation scene, is probably due to some confused recollection in the popular mind of the respect accorded to this bird in Zoroastrian legends. In Persia of Sassanian times, the cock was a sacred fowl, being the favourite of Vohuman\u00f4, the best of Ormazd's creatures, in whom was incarnate Wisdom and Science. It was the cock who at dawn of day crowed and called the faithful to their prayers, thereby chasing away the Div of sleep. Also, according to the Bundehesh, the cock and the dog were the emblems of vigilance and the adversaries of the evil genii and Yat\u00fbs.\n\\(^4\\) This is the Darvish cry all over the Moellem east. It is Arabic, and means literally, \"O He! (Allah the Only One) O the Truth! (that is, Allah.)\"\n\\(^5\\) These verses occur in that portion of Sa'adi's Div\u00e2n, which is entitled \"Tay-yib\u00e2t,\" or \"Perfumed Words.\" In the Bombay edition of 1861 they are given, but in a different order, in vol. ii. p. 41.\nfrom the cock, and once more chanting in a loud and terrific voice,\n\nY\u00e2 Hakk! Y\u00e2 H\u00fb!\n\ntakes his seat on the skin, squatting with his knees up under his armpits.\\(^1\\) On hearing the cry of the Darvish and the sound of the horn, the Nakht\u00fb people in the first moment of astonishment have rushed out of the tent, and thunderstruck stand witnessing the strange scene. When the echoes have died away from rock and hill, and all has become silent again, they turn to Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, and in the excess of their wonderment, begin to ply him with questions.\n\nOne of the Nakht\u00fb people. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, who is the Darvish? and what is this cock?\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed [laughing heartily]. Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha! Yes, yes! You have every right to ask the question, for you simple people are ignorant of the secrets of science, and unlearned in its methods. That grass there is a major ingredient in the Elixir, and it is only to be found in these hills. No one besides Mull\u00e2 Agh\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel is capable of recognizing it. But according to the assertion of the Greek sages, it must grow while the cock is crowing. So it is the duty of Darv\u00eesh \u2018Abb\u00e2s each night to take the cock, and, after performing the ceremonies which you have just now witnessed, to tie the bird up in a new place, and then he must watch from sundown to dawn to keep off the jackals and foxes. Thus while by night the cock crows, the grass for the Elixir at the same time grows. In the book of The Wonders of Wondrous Matters it is plainly indicated that for the service of guarding the cock, only a Darv\u00eesh, and men of no other condition, may lawfully be employed.\n\nThe Nakht\u00fb people [in a state of wonderment]. Allah is great! All praise be to Him!\n\nThe Curtain Falls.\n\n\\(^1\\) This is a favourite position with Darvishes.\nAct III.\u2014The Scene of the Third Act is laid in the same place as the last, but inside the tent of Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. It is dawn. Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel is discovered kneeling on his prayer-carpet, facing the Kibla,\u00b9 his turban is on his head, and in his hand a chaplet of a thousand beads. He mutters his prayers. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, his assistant, stands facing him, with his arms crossed over the chest.\u00b2\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Master, be pleased to give your commands. Shall I introduce the guests to your presence?\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. Well, yes; go and call them.\n\n[Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed makes an inclination, leaves the tent, and returns accompanied by the people of Nakh\u00fb, introducing them into Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel's presence.]\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people [all together, to Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. Peace be on you!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel [blandly smiling, and not disturbing himself in the least, slowly rocks his body from side to side while he is turning the beads of the chaplet.] And on you be the peace! You are welcome. You have brought joy in putting yourselves to the trouble of coming. [He moves to make room for the people of Nakh\u00fb to sit down, and then motions them to be seated.]\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people [after taking his seat]. For us to pay a visit to one so great as your worship is not trouble, but rather cause of ease and felicity to us!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel [smirking, and with affected humility]. My assistant, Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, has already assured me of your excellent dispositions. I also was extremely desirous of seeing you. But as to the matter in hand, by Heaven! I hardly know what to do, and assuredly I shall be put to shame before you! From Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed's report I conclude that you have brought copper coin, wishing to purchase therewith silver.\n\n\u00b9 Towards Mekka.\n\u00b2 The attitude of respect and attention.\nThe Nakh\u00fb people [in a cajoling manner]. Yes, master, so please you that your favour may be ours!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khalil [gratified]. By Allah! and that I should be put to shame before guests so dear to me as you are! But the buyers of silver are so numerous! And every month, giving money for the following month, they buy in advance the silver of the next melting. Why, the silver of the last melting, and this too that is now under our hands, has already been bought by the Armenians of Ikl\u00ees. And the silver that will be produced by the Elixir in the melting to be completed at the end of the month, that too the Jews of V\u00e2rt\u00e2sh\u00b9 have got by their begging and bothering, and they are gone off, near by, to bring the copper coin. I had not yet told Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed of it, for he is not very fond of the Jews. But I must show them some kindness, for their village is near here, and they do me many services.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed [interrupting the conversation]. Master, these\u2014\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. Be silent!\u2014In short, those who desire silver have reached such a number that they give me no leisure in which to find time for the preparation of the Elixir. For in order to prepare the ingredients of the Elixir these must be set, for the space of twenty days, in a pot made of luting-clay, to soak in Spirit of Sulphur, and each day a certain fixed quantity of fresh Spirit of Sulphur must be introduced. Then, after this, the ingredients must remain, for ten consecutive days in an alembic and retort, covered with Roseatic Acid, and every other day the Roseatic Acid must be changed and fresh added. After the termination of this portion of the preparation, the ingredients of the Elixir must be brought to the full term of its concoction by incident of igneous heat, in a crucible made of luting-clay. After a space of three sidereal hours, following on the admixture of certain other secret ingredients of a foreign nature, it then first presents an appearance of melting, subsequently coagulates, and finally becomes stable in the form of a\n\n\u00b9 Vartash or Vartashin, a village lying south of Nakh\u00fb.\nsoft-substanced body. Elixir has the name Elixir because of its action on the baser ores. Thus, for instance, when brass that has been melted has a certain measured portion of Elixir mixed in with it, it turns into pure silver. This is my art, but foolish men, as I am assured, have been spreading abroad on all hands that I work miracles and have received a Revelation. I am no such person. I am but a simple man, who seeks for the companionship of the pious, and strives for the doing of good deeds, firstly through the Grace of the Almighty Creator, and secondly by means of researches and profound investigations which I have made in the science of Alchemy. Through the experiments which now for some time I have been conducting in the philosophical sciences, and while searching out the secrets of the natural world, I have become acquainted with the full particulars of the preparation of the Elixir, and how with prudence it may be concocted. At every degree of its preparation there are a number of essential external conditions to be fulfilled. These are all exigencies necessarily attributive to the Elixir, though at first sight they may appear to common men as strange and peculiar. Also . . .\n\nMull\u00e1 Hamtd. Master! As I have already begged you to understand, these before you are all Moslems, and, if it please you, you should give them some advantage over the accursed Jews\u2014\n\nMull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Khal\u00edl [rising slightly]. No! Not so! I have given my word! and for two million pieces I would not recall what I have spoken. But see! An idea comes to my mind. Only first tell me that I may rightly calculate. The Elixir for this month's melting, when it is completed, how many poods\\(^1\\) of brass will it suffice to convert into silver?\n\nMull\u00e1 Hamtd. [Throwing up his head, and, fixing his eyes on the ceiling of the tent, presses the forefinger of his right hand on his chin, and thinks for a moment. Then answers] Elixir will be prepared sufficing for thirty-two poods of silver.\n\n\\(^1\\) See note 2 to p. 107.\nThus, after its completion in thirty days, it will be projected over thirty-two poods of brass and turn these into pure silver, such as will pass the touchstone. Now, allowing that your worship deducts two poods of this by reason of the impurity of the brass, still at the beginning of next month thirty poods of silver will be produced, as I deduce from my inspection of the amount of the crude brass and of the Elixir.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Kh\u00e2l\u00eel. And these worshipful gentlemen, how much copper money have they brought?\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people. Five thousand stone-weight, Master.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Kh\u00e2l\u00eel. Very well! See, Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, what I have in my mind. The copper money of these worshipful people is but little in amount, and we will allow them ten poods of silver. Then there will remain twenty poods, and that can be given to the Jews, that my promise to them may not be broken. What think you of it? Have I not made an excellent partition? On the one hand, your mediation regarding the rights of our co-religionists has not been for naught, and on the other hand my promise given has not been forfeited.\n\nThe people of Nakh\u00fb [bowing and vastly contented]. May Heaven increase your prosperity! So please you, we will deposit the money here in your presence.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Kh\u00e2l\u00eel [raising his eyebrows, contemptuously indifferent, and speaking slowly]. It is not necessary to deposit the money with me, and how should I find time enough and have leisure to attend to such trifles! Count it and give it over to Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, and then in thirty days come back here and get your ten poods of virgin silver. God be with you! The hour of midday prayer is come!\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people [bowing and greatly delighted]. May Heaven increase your life and your prosperity! [Exeunt from the tent.]\n\nThe Curtain Falls.\nAct IV.\u2014The Scene is once more the same. The thirty days have elapsed. At early dawn from a distance the people of Nakh\u00fb are seen approaching to keep their appointment. Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel hastily ties a white cloth round his waist and turns up his sleeves. He is dressed in his every-day working clothes, and is without his turban, his head covered with the cotton night cap. He comes outside the tent and calls to his assistant Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, and when Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed has come up, he proceeds to give him his orders.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, be quick, and go and get in the tent the goldsmith-forg\u00e9, with the crucible and the small bellows, and bring them out here. Set them up here in this place, and see to arrange the nozzle of the bellows in its proper position. Then light the forge and set in the crucible. Bring, too, the sack of coals from behind the tent, and turn them out in front of the forge.\n\nNow go to the tent, in the casket there are three small coloured phials, and, twisted up, three coloured papers; get them and bring them here.\n\nNow untwist the yellow paper,\u2014open it, and empty the contents of it into the crucible.\n\nNow pour the liquid out of the green phial over it, and now sit down and blow the bellows.\n\n[After these orders have been carried out, Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel takes up a pair of iron tongs and fixes the crucible firmly in the coals. At this moment, all of a sudden, appear the heads of the Nakh\u00fb people from behind the corner of the tent, they having already dismounted from their horses. Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel is occupied with his work, his head is averted, and he is looking into the crucible. Apparently he does not perceive them. They however are delighted at discovering Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel thus occupied, and call to him in a loud voice, and eagerly.]\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people. Peace be on you!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel [looking up]. Peace be on you! Oh but why have you come to-day? How is this? and what have\nyou done! What a disaster it is you bring down on my head! I was busy working for your good; but you are come to render abortive all the pains that I have taken for your sakes! Oh! Alas! Alas! Alas!\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people [in astonishment]. But, master, what has happened? What disaster has come on our heads? What is it that we have done?\n\nMulla Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Kh\u00e2lt\u00eel [in perfect despair]. Why, what would you have worse than this? You set foot here in this place to-day at the very hour of the projection of the Elixir! At the very moment when the ingredients are melting in the crucible! Why, it is the especial property of the Elixir that for a whole farsakh\\(^1\\) round the tent where it is liquidescing, no stranger man must set foot, or else the Elixir loses its peculiar power and becomes a mere gas. On this subject the Magician of the Sprites, Sakk\u00e2ki,\\(^2\\) has most carefully insisted. Do you imagine that otherwise I should, of my own accord, have come and taken up my abode here in a corner by myself, thus far away from all habitations?\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people [astonished]. But, master, we have come in accordance with your own commands. To-day the thirty days are completed.\n\nMulla Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Kh\u00e2lt\u00eel. What I said to you was, 'at the end of thirty days,' meaning, of course, for you to let thirty days elapse, and to come on the thirty-first. The Elixir would then have been prepared, and the silver already run out. But you come on the thirtieth day, at the very moment when the Elixir is at fluxion in the crucible! Oh! Alas! Alas!\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people. Well, but as it is all happened, we don't know what to do. Can't we help it?\n\nMulla Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Kh\u00e2lt\u00eel. Why, there is no help for it. The Elixir will not now do its office, and the silver will not be\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Farsakh = Parasang, a little over three miles.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is probably Abu Ya'k\u00fbb Sak\u00e2ki, the Necromancer, who composed the work entitled *Mi\u1e63\u1e6dah al-'Ulam*, \"The Key of the Sciences.\" He died in A.D. 1229.\ntransmuted. Unless, indeed, you . . . . For the counter-spell is possible only with this.\n\nThe Nakh\u00fa people. Unless we do what? What is it makes the counter-spell possible?\n\nMull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1lt\u00ed. Well, now that you have once come, the alchemistic rule forbids that you should leave the place in which the Elixir in the crucible is at fluxion. That is, if you would have any regard for your own welfare, and wish not to render abortive all the pains that I have undergone on your behalf. But from now until the time when the Elixir is complete and pours out of the crucible\u2014and I have already been occupied over it for the last hour, and it still requires two hours more to come to term\u2014for this time you must not allow the idea of a Monkey to cross your mind, nor must you let the semblance of its image come into your thoughts. The counter-spell depends on this! And otherwise this Elixir, which for the whole of the last month I have been working to prepare, in the twinkling of an eye becomes nought, and goes off into thin air. This is its peculiar property, even as Hak\u00edm Juli\u00b9 has very carefully described, times over, and plainly laid down in his treatise.\n\nThe Nakh\u00fa people [re-assured by the apparently easy condition of the counter-spell,\u2014together]. All right, master! This is a simple matter. Please Heaven to make the perfecting of the Elixir dependent on this alone!\n\nMull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1lt\u00ed. Yes, it depends simply on this. May Allah be satisfied with what you do, and I shall be so likewise. Mull\u00e1 Ham\u00edd, blow with the bellows.\n\n[Mull\u00e1 Ham\u00edd blows the bellows, while Mull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm turns the crucible round with the iron tongs. He throws one of the ingredient powders into it, and pours in, drop by drop, the contents of one of the phials. Then he takes his seat, and pulling his watch out of his breast pocket, looks at it. All of a sudden\u2014]\n\nAgh\u00e1 Zam\u00e1n, the Doctor [turning towards him]. Master, is there not some other counter-spell than this?\n\n\u00b9 Who this learned doctor was I have been unable to discover.\nMull\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101ll\u012b. No other but what?\nAgh\u0101 Zam\u0101n, the Doctor. No other but with the Monkey.\nMull\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101ll\u012b. You fellow! What\u2014what are you saying? What words are you pronouncing? Ah, woe to you!\nAgh\u0101 Zam\u0101n. Well, but what can I do? I can't drive the Monkey out of my thoughts.\nMull\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101ll\u012b [in despair and very angrily]. Hold your tongue, you fellow! Whatever comes into your mind, keep it out!\nAgh\u0101 Zam\u0101n. On my eyes be it, master.\nMull\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101ll\u012b [angrily to his assistant Mull\u0101 Salm\u0101n]. Blow hard with the bellows! You are going to sleep! [Poking down his head, he peers into the crucible. Then undoing the blue paper he pours in the powder out of it. At this moment]\nMull\u0101 Salm\u0101n [throwing off his cap]. Ouf! how hot it is! Ouf! Heaven give you all its curse! They will not keep back! There is no help for it!\nMull\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101ll\u012b. And whom should Heaven curse? Who will not keep back? What is there no help for? What are you talking about?\nMull\u0101 Salm\u0101n. There is no help for it! The counter-spell is impossible!\nThe rest of the Nakh\u016b people. That is true. There is no help for it. It will never be possible!\nMull\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101ll\u012b [getting in a rage]. What do you mean by there being no help for it? What is impossible? What are you talking about? What has come to you?\nMull\u0101 Salm\u0101n [prompted by the state of mind in which he and his companions are, and urged on by their looks of approval, ventures to reply]. Master, all the animals of the hills have changed themselves into the figures of Monkeys and the likenesses of huge Apes, and are uncurling their long tails before my eyes, and now are assaulting my head. Ouf! I don't know what to do, or whither to take refuge! Ouf! Heaven give you its malediction, you Apes and Monkeys!\nThe rest of the Nakh\u00fa people [throwing up their heads]. Malediction on you, you Monkeys! What a pass is this we have got into!\n\n[While the people of Nakh\u00fa have their heads in the air and are not looking, Mull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Khal\u00edl hurriedly throws something into the crucible. Flames and what appears to be a shower of bullets burst out of it and fly about on all sides. Then the crucible cracks, and the pretended Elixir blows up into the air like gunpowder. The fire is upset, and the coals rolling about, the various articles begin to blaze.\u2014Mull\u00e1 Ham\u00edd springs back behind the bellows and the forge in terror. Mull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Khal\u00edl plucks at the hair of his beard with both hands, and then, striking his knees\u00b9 with his hands, moans aloud.]\n\nMull\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Khal\u00edl [screaming at the Nakh\u00fa people]. Heaven ruin your homes! What is this that you have done! Heaven ruin your homes, and close the doors of your houses on you!

VIII.\u2014On Buddhism in its Relation to Br\u0101hmanism.\n\nBy Professor Sir Monier Monier-Williams, C.I.E., D.C.L., M.R.A.S.\n\nThe recent annexation of Upper Burmah will probably give an impulse to the study of Buddhism. At any rate, the fact that the sacred books of the Southern Buddhists are being made accessible through Professor Oldenberg's edition of the Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka,\u2014through the works of Professor Rhys Davids and other scholars,\u2014and more especially through the valuable publications of the P\u0101li Text Society, is likely, I hope, to cause a considerable accession to the ranks of P\u0101li scholars.\n\nRightly or wrongly, and in my opinion wrongly, Buddhism has always excited more attention and interest in this country than Br\u0101hmanism, and the relationship of the one to the other is not yet generally understood.\n\nI may therefore perhaps be held excused if I venture to come before this Society to-day, not with any new theory or discovery, either in the science of language or religion, but with a contribution towards setting forth more clearly the debt that Buddhism owes to Br\u0101hmanism, and Br\u0101hmanism to Buddhism, and the inter-relationship between two systems which together influence the creed, conduct and social condition of more than one-third of the population of the world.\n\nI need scarcely say that I am here using the term Buddhism in a restricted sense. I am applying it to that moral and philosophical system first taught in India about 2350 years ago, of which the Sacred Books of the Southern\nBuddhists are the best exponent, not to those highly developed forms of so-called Buddhism which prevail as popular religions in other parts of Asia in the present day.\n\nAnd at the outset I may remark that philosophical Buddhism bears much the same relation to its various later outgrowths that pure Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism bears to Hind\u016bism.\n\nIn speaking on former occasions before this Society, I have striven to point out what I conceive to be the difference between pure Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism and Hind\u016bism.\n\nPure philosophical Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism may fairly be identified with the Ved\u0101nta system, which again is closely connected with the S\u0101\u1e45khya.\n\nIt is a creed built up on the doctrine of an impersonal, universally present, unconscious spirit called Brahman\u2014a kind of spiritual element or vital principle pervading all space, and underlying equally every material object, whether organic, or inorganic, whether stones, animals, men or gods.\n\nIt postulates the eternal existence of that impersonal elementary spirit as its starting-point\u2014denies the real existence, not only of all material objects, but of the separate human soul, as distinct from the universal soul; and ends where it began in a pure impersonal entity, which it is difficult to distinguish in its unconscious state from pure nonentity. If this be Pantheism, as commonly alleged, it is a kind of spiritual Pantheism very different from the ordinary Pantheism of European philosophy.\n\nHind\u016bism, on the other hand, is a system built up on the doctrine of devotion to the personal gods \u015aiva and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. It postulates the eternal existence of those personal gods as its starting-point, and ends in simple polytheism and idolatry.\n\nIf we compare in the same way philosophical with popular Buddhism, the difference seems to lie in this:\n\nPhilosophical Buddhism\u2014or at least the truest form of it\u2014is a system built up on the doctrine of the utter unreality and undesirableness of life in any form or state, and the non-existence of any spiritual essence, as distinct from material organisms. It postulates the eternal existence of\nNothing\\(^1\\) as its starting-point, and ends in simple Nihilism. Impermanence is written on the whole visible universe, including man. Even the most perfect human being must lapse into non-existence.\n\nPopular Buddhism, on the other hand, is a system built up on the worship of certain perfected human beings converted into personal gods. It affirms the eternal permanence of such beings in some state or other, just as Vaishnavas affirm the eternal existence of Vishnu. It gives them divine attributes, and ends like Hind\u016bism in polytheism and idolatry.\n\nWith this popular doctrine we have at present nothing to do. Our only concern is with that form of philosophical Buddhism which is set forth in the sacred books of the Southern Canon, and was once current in India.\n\nAnd at first it might seem that for a Br\u0101hman, who is a Brahma-v\u0101d\u012b, that is to say, who asserts that Brahman\u2014the one Spirit\u2014really exists and nothing else, and for a Buddhist, who is a \u015a\u016bnya-v\u0101d\u012b\u2014that is, who affirms that a blank or void must be substituted for Brahman\u2014there can be no common meeting-ground.\n\nBut a careful examination of the two systems proves that they were not only closely related in their origin, but that the separation and antagonism which afterwards took place between them were never so great as to exclude the prospect of their ultimately drawing towards each other again by mutual sympathy and attraction, and even actually blending; the result of this final union being, in my opinion, the production of the later forms of Vaishnavism and \u015aaivism. Indeed, the worshippers of the god Vishnu, in their ideas of liberty, fraternity and equality, in their abstinence from injury, and benevolence towards all creatures, in their hero-worship, deification of humanity and fondness for images, have always seemed to me to be more than half Buddhists.\n\nPerhaps, then, the very first point made clear by the study of the original documents is that the Buddha never seriously thought of founding a religious system in direct\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Except it be Karma 'act,' but Buddhism does not undertake to explain how the first act originated.\nopposition to Br\u0101hmanism. He himself was a Hind\u016b of the Hind\u016bs, and he remained a Hind\u016b to the end.\n\nAnd it is remarkable that just as the Founder of Christianity, being Himself a Jew, never required his followers to give up their Jewish creed or usages, so the founder of Buddhism, being himself a Hind\u016b, never required his adherents to make any formal renunciation of their ancestral religion, as if they had been converted to an entirely new faith.\n\nNor had the Buddha any idea of ostentatiously courting popularity as a champion of universal social equality and denouncer of all distinctions of rank\u2014a kind of Tribune of the people, whose mission was to protect them from the tyranny of caste.\n\nWhat he rather aimed at was to form a caste of his own, that is to say, an order of monks which had in its constitution much of the character of a caste, though not a priestly one\u2014a vast association of persons who were all to be equals in rank\u2014a brotherhood in which all were equally under the triple vow of celibacy, poverty and mendicancy\u2014a society in which all were equally dominated by one idea\u2014an idea very prevalent before Gautama\u2019s time\u2014that life was not worth living under any circumstances, whether on earth or in heaven, whether in present or future bodies.\n\nThe founding of such a monastic Order was, without doubt, the Buddha\u2019s principal aim; and when founded, it contained within itself potentialities for expansion of which its founder probably never dreamed.\n\nIts growth soon surpassed all anticipations, and its ramifications rapidly extended in all directions, spreading in the end to distant countries, where, like the Indian Fig-tree, they sent down roots to form vigorous plants even after the decay of the parent stem.\n\nIn point of fact, an organized monastic system, which opened its arms to all comers of whatever rank, and enforced on its members the duty of extending its boundaries by itinerancy,\n\n1 This, I admit, is not consistent with what I said in Indian Wisdom (p. 55), but when I wrote that work the Tripitaka was not so well known as it is now.\nand by the constant rolling onward of the wheel of the Buddhist law, constituted from the earliest times the chief strength, the very backbone, of Buddhism, without which it could never have been propagated, nor even have held its own in the place of its origin for so many centuries.\n\nBut in this, his main design, Gautama was really no innovator; no introducer of new ideas foreign either to the spirit or practice of Br\u0101hmanism.\n\nMonasticism had always been an adjunct, or accompaniment of the Br\u0101hmanical system. Thus, we find it laid down in Manu's Law-book (vi. 1) that every twice-born man was bound to be first a student living with a preceptor, next a married householder, and then, at a certain period of a long life, he was to abandon wife, family, and caste, and become in due course a hermit or anchorite, living in the woods, or a mendicant wandering from door to door.\n\nIn fact, it was through these very stages and states of life that Gautama Buddha himself must in all probability have passed.\n\nAnd be it observed that ordinary Hind\u016b monks were not necessarily Br\u0101hmans. There were in India many monastic communities which included in them men of various castes and sects, and there were also numerous solitary monks and devotees. These took vows of different kinds, whether of self-torture, of silence, of fasting, of poverty, of nakedness, of mendicancy, of celibacy, of abandoning caste, rank, wife, and family.\n\nHence they called themselves by various names, such as Sanny\u0101si, 'one who has abandoned the world'; Vair\u0101gi, 'one who is free from all worldly desires'; Yog\u012b, 'one who seeks union with the Deity by abstract meditation'; Yati, 'one who restrains his passions'; Jitendriya, 'one who has conquered his organs of sense'; \u0160ramana, 'one who fatigues himself by austerities'; Bhikshu, 'one who lives by begging.'\n\nThe peculiarity of Gautama's monachism was that he made it a necessary qualification for all who wished to enter the path leading to final beatitude, and that he set his face against all solitary asceticism. His aim was to form a vast\nwell-organized fraternity of celibate monks, co-extensive with humanity itself; and although these were to be collected in local centres, they were nevertheless bound to move about from one place to another both to obtain their daily food and for the propagation of the Buddha's doctrine. It should always, indeed, be borne in mind that celibacy, poverty, and mendicancy were three essentials of true Buddhism, and not a mere accidental accompaniment of it.\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that Gautama did not think it necessary to distinguish the members of his Order by any new title, but preferred making use of some of the current Br\u0101hmanical names.\n\nHis usual mode of designating them was by the term Bhikshu (P\u0101li Bhikkhu) 'beggars,' to indicate their poverty; though they were also called \u015ar\u0101vaka 'hearers,' to denote their attitude of attention as hearers of the Law; and \u015arama\u1e47a (P\u0101li Sama\u1e47a, Sanskrit root \u015aram), to indicate the labour and fatigue they had to undergo after their admission to the Order.\n\nFor although Buddhism has the credit of being the easiest and least burdensome religious system in the world, and its monks among the idlest of men\u2014as having properly no rites and ceremonies to perform, and nothing to do in the way of working for a livelihood\u2014yet in real truth the carrying out the objects contemplated by the Founder was no sinecure if earnestly undertaken.\n\nIt was not possible for men to be really idle who felt that their only mode of avoiding starvation was by begging their daily bread from place to place, and that as members of the Order they were bound to be constantly engaged in turning the wheel of the law, in bringing all their bodily desires into subjection, and in practising profound meditation for the attainment of true knowledge.\n\nThis last duty\u2014the duty of meditation\u2014the Buddha himself\u2014as is well known\u2014had set the example of performing for many years as a means of attaining true enlightenment. And it may be here pointed out that in doing so, he had merely conformed to the practice of Yoga, which, though\nnot formulated into a regular system of philosophy, was at that time common enough among the Br\u0101hmans.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Dh\u0101ran\u0101, Dhy\u0101na, and Sam\u0101dhi, three forms of abstract contemplation and mental concentration, were frequently resorted to by Br\u0101hmans in Gautama\u2019s time with much the same object he had in view\u2014perfect spiritual insight and true enlightenment of mind. Indeed this may be proved by a reference to Manu vi. 72.\n\nThe very G\u0101yatr\u012b or ancient Vedic prayer\u2014still used by millions of our Indian fellow-subjects at their daily devotions\u2014was originally an act of meditation performed with the very same object:\u2014\u201cLet us meditate on the excellent glory of the divine vivifying Sun, may he enlighten our understandings\u201d (\u1e5aig-veda iii. 62. 10).\n\nEven the choice of the A\u015bvattha or sacred Pipal tree as the place under which the first stirrings of the divine afflatus\u2014symbolized by the mysterious rustling of its tremulous leaves\u2014were likely to make themselves felt, was quite in harmony with Br\u0101hmanical ideas; for we know that in the Ka\u1e6dha Upanishad (vi. 1)\u00b9 the root of this tree is identified with the Supreme Being Brahman, and that a passage in the M\u1e47\u1e0daka Upanishad (iii. 1, 1), and a Mantra of the \u1e5aig-veda (I. 164, 20), point to the same conception. It is true that Gautama subsequently repudiated all idea of any divine inspiration coming from any external source, yet it is highly probable that when he first seated himself under the sacred Fig-tree, which is even now regarded as a form of Brahm\u0101\u2014he expected to be visited by some kind of supernatural communications.\n\nEnough, then, has been said to show that, according to Gautama\u2019s original plan, every true Buddhist was bound to be a celibate monk. Let us not forget, however, that in practice Buddhism recognized laymen and married householders quite as much as Br\u0101hmanism did.\n\nOf course the Buddha knew very well that it was not possible to enforce celibacy on all his followers, however\n\n\u00b9 I do not mean by this to affirm as a certainty that the Ka\u1e6dha Upanishad, though ancient, was pre-Buddhistic. Its exact date is immaterial; it must be taken in conjunction with the Mantra in the \u1e5aig-Veda and other passages, as proving the great antiquity of the idea of this tree\u2019s sacredness.\ndesirable such an eventuality might have been. He was well aware that if every man and woman had been led through his example and teaching to remain unmarried, and go about from one place to another, either as a mendicant or preacher, there would have been no work done, no food produced, no children born, and in time no humanity\u2014nay no Buddhism\u2014left.\n\nHe had to take the Indian world as he found it, and the generality of people were in Gautama's day very much what they are in India now-a-days\u2014bent on early marriage and resolute in devoting themselves to the task of earning a livelihood by honest work\u2014aye and downright hard work too.\n\nWithout doubt celibacy in instances of extraordinary sanctity has always commanded respect in India; but in no country of the world has married life been so universally honoured, and the duty of toiling daily for self-support so universally admitted. It is not very likely, then, that the following sentiment from the Sutta-Nip\u0101ta could have met with very general approval among the Buddha's hearers:\n\n\"A wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning pit of live coals\" (Dhammika-Sutta 21, Kum\u0101ra Sv\u0101mi).\n\nAnd indeed it seems to me that the very circumstance that the foundations of Buddhism were not laid, as those of Br\u0101hmanism were\u2014and as those of Christianity notably are\u2014on the sacred rock of family-life, and that Gautama made abstinence from marriage essential to actual enrolment in his society, and to perseverance on the way of salvation, is sufficient of itself to account for the fact that Buddhism never gained any real stability or permanence in India.\n\nAt any rate it is clear that the Buddha, foreseeing the impossibility of converting the mass of the people to his anti-matrimonial views, very soon gathered round him an exterior circle of married laymen. These lay brethren were bound to Buddhism by very slender ties. They were required to conform to the simplest possible code of morality.\n\nProbably the only test a layman had to undergo was his willingness to appear before an assembly of monks and repeat\nthe formula, \"I take refuge with the Buddha, his Law and his Order.\" And indeed it seems to me probable that it was for this reason that lay adherents were not called disciples, but simply Up\u0101sakas, that is, 'Servers,' or 'Honourers,' and in the case of women Up\u0101sik\u0101s.\n\nAt all events they had to perform serving, and this chiefly consisted in the offering of food and gifts to the monks. If any lay brother failed in this act of reverence, the only punishment inflicted on him was that he was deprived of this privilege of presenting gifts, and so acquiring a store of merit necessary to his advancement in future states of being. In brief, lay brethren were not true Buddhists except so far as by supporting and serving the monks,\u00b9 they qualified themselves for enrolment within the pale of the Monastic Order at some future time or in subsequent forms of corporeal existence. Nor were they, as I have already hinted, bound to be believers in the Buddha's doctrine, except as one part of their general creed.\n\nWhat I mean is, that when a man presented himself before a body of monks and claimed to be admitted as a lay brother on the ground of his readiness to do homage to the Buddha, his Law and his Order, he was not thereby precluded from retaining a half or even whole belief in the old-established creeds and customs of his family. In short, he was not required to break with Hind\u016bism, and as a matter of fact never did so, any more than the lay Buddhists of China broke with Confucianism and Tauism.\u00b2\n\nThis was only in keeping with A\u015boka's declaration in his twelfth edict: \"The beloved of the gods honours all forms of religious faith\u2014there ought to be reverence for one's own faith and no reviling of that of others.\"\u00b3\n\nDoubtless, such toleration of the doctrines and ideas of\n\n\u00b9 Comparing Western with Eastern Monachism, I may remark that the chief duty of the lay brethren attached to the monastery at Fountain's Abbey in Yorkshire was to wait upon the monks, procure food and cook it for them; and we learn from an interesting article on the Charterhouse in the Times of December 24th, 1885, that the same duty devolved on the Carthusian lay brothers.\n\n\u00b2 In China at the present day the Emperor practises simultaneously Confucianism, Buddhism and Tauism.\n\n\u00b3 See Wilson's and Burnouf's translations.\nother systems had its advantages, especially in the early stages of the Buddhistic movement. It certainly had a prophylactic effect in warding off violent opposition, and helped to secure the permanence of Buddhism for many centuries in India. On the other hand, it had its *per contra* disadvantages, and the absence of any sharp lines of separation between Buddhism and co-existing creeds and superstitions makes it easy to understand how in the end it happened that on the destruction of Buddhist monasteries in India by hostile religionists, Buddhism seemed to melt away or become merged in Hind\u016bism, while all its temples, symbols, idols, and sacred places became subservient to Vaish\u1e47avism and \u015aaivism.\n\nYet, as a matter of fact, Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism and Buddhism co-existed for about a thousand years after A\u015boka\u2019s Council (about 245 B.C.). If conflicts took place, they were not general, but confined to particular localities, and I think it may be safely affirmed that if Buddhism was ever anywhere persecuted, it never anywhere persecuted in return. I myself was much struck in one of my visits to India by the evidence Ellora (in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s territory) affords of friendly tolerance between Br\u0101hma\u1e47s, Buddhists, and Jains. Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical, Buddhist, and Jain caves may be there seen side by side, and their inmates no doubt lived on terms of just as much harmony as the members of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Wesleyan communions do in Europe at the present day. It was only in the South of India that any violent crusade against Buddhism\u2014like that instituted by Kum\u0101rila and \u015aa\u1e45kara in the seventh and eighth centuries of our era\u2014seems to have been carried on. In other parts of India, Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism crept up somewhat insidiously to its rival, and drew the heat out of its body by close contact. In brief, I hold that if it be true to say that Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism was the birth-place of Buddhism, it is quite as true to assert that in India at least Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism became its grave, and that the passing away of the Buddhistic system was, on the whole, peaceful and unattended with any violent pangs.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 No doubt there are places in the South of India where there is evidence\nWith regard to the Order of Nuns (Bhikshu\u1e47\u012b, in P\u0101li Bhikkhun\u012b), it is generally believed that at the outset of his career Gautama refrained from imparting, or allowing others to impart his ideas to women, simply because he feared the danger of encouraging communication with the female sex. Tradition asserts that women were indebted to the intercession of Gautama's favourite cousin \u0100nanda for permission to form a Sisterhood of their own.\n\nCertain it is, that no long period elapsed before the Buddha conceded to women the privilege of entering on the same path of deliverance as that opened to men.\n\nIt is well known that at the time when Gautama lived, women were not kept in actual seclusion. Yet we learn from Manu's law-book that they enjoyed little independence of action, and were regarded as inferior beings, incapable of the same form of religion as men.\n\nIt was not surprising, therefore, that Gautama, while admitting the justice of the plea for women's rights under a system of universal brotherhood and equality, and while actually instituting a sisterhood of nuns, should have placed them under the direction of monks, and made them subject to the male Order in all matters of discipline.\n\nWhatever may be said about the theory of social equality between men and women in Buddhist countries, there can be little doubt that in India Buddhism effected little alteration in Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical ideas about women.\n\nIt is at any rate clear that men were regarded as possessing an advantage over women in respect of the more rapid attainment of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, and that every nun cherished as an object of legitimate ambition the hope of being born as a man in some future birth.\n\nof some violent persecution. I may instance among the places I visited the Temples of Tanjore and Madura. When I concluded the reading of this paper at the meeting of the Society on February 15, 1886, our President, Colonel Yule, very justly remarked that the members of two religious communions who hold very similar doctrines often on that account hate and oppose each other all the more; but my point is that the intense tolerance and eclecticism that characterized both Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism and Buddhism must have prevented mutual persecution, except under special circumstances. Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism was much more likely to have adopted Buddhism as part of its system than to have persecuted and expelled it. In point of fact, the Br\u0101hmans, as is well known, turned the Buddha into one of Vish\u1e47u's incarnations, very much as they are ready to turn the Founder of Christianity also.\nSuch then was the monachism which lay at the root of true Buddhism. It was in no one particular openly antagonistic to Hind\u016b caste. It was supported, as we have seen, by a large body of lay associates, and those lay brethren who refrained from enrolling themselves as members of the Order retained their caste-distinctions without any denunciations from Gautama. Nor did Gautama ever rail at the Br\u0101hmans, or dispute their right to be regarded as men of higher social rank. On the contrary, he treated them with respect, and taught others to do so, just as he admitted the superiority of the gods over men, and allowed men to worship them; merely denying that either gods or Br\u0101hmans could alter a man's condition in a future life.\n\nWhat he really opposed was priestcraft and priestly domination, not caste; for, be it observed, Buddhism recognizes no priests, and has properly no priests of its own, unless monks can be so called.\n\nOther reformers and leaders of Hind\u016b sects had done much the same before him, so that even in this respect it cannot be said that Gautama struck out any wholly original line.\n\nBut it was not merely in the establishment and organization of a universal monastic Order, by means of which he might propagate what he believed to be true knowledge, that the Buddha took care to avoid any direct or offensive opposition to the spirit of Br\u0101hmanism: he was equally careful in regard to the form in which the knowledge so propagated was presented. It seems indeed as if the great Teacher to whom the majority of Asiatic races have for centuries looked as a kind of god-like example, if not as an actual god, was naturally so tolerant of the opinions of others, and so humble-minded in regard to his own, that he could not bring himself to pose in the attitude of an original thinker.\n\n1 He even asserted that birth in a Br\u0101hman family would be a reward for merit. According to Burnouf \"very little difference appears between the Buddhists and Br\u0101hmans in the early Buddhist writings, and Buddha is often described as followed by a crowd of Br\u0101hmans as well as of Bhikkhus.\" See Journal R.A.S. o.s. Vol. XII. p. 242.\nAlmost all the doctrines of Buddhism will be found on examination to be more or less amplifications or modifications of previously current Br\u0101hmanical ideas, which again were afterwards modified by an interchange with Buddhistic ideas. At any rate, it may be doubted whether Gautama himself during his whole life-time ever expressed opinions calculated to cause any serious offence to the most orthodox Brahmans. He could not of course wholly dispense with dogmatic teaching of his own; but all his dogmas were more or less the result of a compromise with old-established doctrines.\n\nAnd it is certain that the Buddha's method of clothing old truths in a new dress, or, to adopt another metaphor, of mixing new wine with old, had in it a fascination very attractive to most men. For Br\u0101hmanism was in truth equally tolerant of other creeds, and equally eclectic. Even if a man were one of its most orthodox adherents, he was allowed to choose one of three ways or methods of securing his own salvation.\n\nThe first was the way of sacrifices, ceremonies and rites, as enjoined in the Mantra and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a portion of the Veda.\n\nThe second was the way of devotion to one or other of certain commonly worshipped personal deities, leading in later times to \u015aaivism and Vaishnavism (as ultimately unfolded in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as).\n\nThe third was the way of knowledge as set forth in the Upanishads.\u00b9\n\nAny one of these three ways, or all three together, might be chosen without fear of being charged with heresy, so long as the authority of the Veda was not impugned; but the third, or way of knowledge, which was incomparably the highest way, was not open to all.\n\nIt was the way reserved for the more intellectual and\n\n\u00b9 The three ways are usually expressed in Sanskrit by Karman, Bhakti, and J\u00f1\u0101na respectively; but the doctrine of Bhakti was not fully developed till after the time of Buddha, though the Upanishads prove that the practice of devotion (as expressed by Up\u0101sana) must have existed.\nphilosophically-minded Br\u0101hmans. The generality of men had to content themselves with the first and second ways. All that the Buddha then did was, in the first place, to institute an Order to which all classes were admissible; and in the second place to throw open the third or highest way\u2014the way of true knowledge\u2014to all who wished to enter upon it, of whatever rank or caste or mental calibre they might be. No human being, he declared, not even the lowest, was to be shut out from free access to the path of true enlightenment.\n\nAnd here, of course, it will occur to most persons to inquire what was the nature of that knowledge which the Buddha thus made accessible to all?\n\nWas it some deep spiritual truth? Some abstruse doctrine of philosophy, or physical, or metaphysical science? Was the Buddha's open way very different from the old, well-fenced-off and carefully-guarded Br\u0101hmanical way? Was his knowledge opposed to Br\u0101hmanical knowledge?\n\nUnhappily we are here met by a difficulty. The Buddha promulgated a creed, but he never, like Muhammad, wrote a book or even a single line. He was, in some respects, the Socrates of India, and we are obliged to trust to his followers for a record of his sayings and doings. Still we have no reason to doubt the genuineness of what has been handed down in regard to the main doctrines he taught, and we are at once struck with the fact that Gautama called his own knowledge Bodhi and not Veda. Most probably he did so because he wished to imply that his own knowledge, as attainable by all through their own efforts and intuitions, was to be distinguished from Veda or knowledge obtainable through the Br\u0101hmans alone, and by them through supernatural revelation only.\n\nBut it should be noted\u2014as pointed out long ago by Professor A. Weber of Berlin, and recently by Professor Oldenberg\u2014that even in the choice of a name derived from the Sanskrit root Budh 'to know,' the self-enlightened Buddha was only following the authors of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. For example, the \u015aata-patha-br\u0101hma\u1e47a called a\nman prati-buddha who had attained to perfect knowledge of the \u0100tman. It may be pointed out, too, that in Manu (iv. 204) the wise man is called Budha.\n\nMoreover, the doctrines which grew out of his self-acquired knowledge Gautama still called Dharma 'law,' using the very same term employed by the Br\u0101hmans\u2014a term expressive of law in its most comprehensive sense, as comprising under it the physical laws of the Universe, as well as moral, political and social duties. And, further, the very first truth taught in the Buddha's Dharma was after all no new truth. It was in perfect harmony with Br\u0101hmanical ideas. His way of knowledge, though\u2014like that of the Br\u0101hmans\u2014it ultimately developed into many paths, had only one point of departure. It started from the old truth, taught long before, that all life\u2014not merely some life\u2014was pain and misery, and it indicated two cures for that misery.\n\nThe first cure was the suppression of desire, especially the desire for continuity of existence. The second cure was the remoral of ignorance. When, however, we come to put the question\u2014ignorance of what? we find ourselves brought round by the well-known twelve-linked chain of causality to the old truth, and the answer we receive is:\u2014ignorance that all life is pain and misery and all craving for continuity of individual existence a mistake.\n\nIt would be easy to prove that this kind of pessimism\u2014the pessimism of Schopenhauer, von Hartmann and other modern European philosophers\u2014was taught by the Br\u0101hmans in Buddha's time and has continued to be a thoroughly Br\u0101hmanical idea even to the present day. Witness the following sentiment from the Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47i or Maitri Upanishad:\n\n\"In this weak body, ever liable\nTo wrath, ambition, avarice, illusion,\nTo fear, grief, envy, hatred, separation\nFrom those we hold most dear, association\nWith those we hate; continually exposed\nTo hunger, thirst, disease, decrepitude,\nEmaciation, growth, decline and death,\nWhat relish can there be for true enjoyment?\"\n\n1 S'ata-patha-br\u0101hma\u1e47a xiv. 7, 2, 17.\nAlso the following, from Manu (vi. 77):\n\n\"This body like a house composed of the (five) elements, with bones for its rafters, tendons for its connecting links, flesh and blood for its mortar, skin for its covering; this house filled with impurities, infested by sorrow and old age, the seat of disease, full of pain and passion, and not lasting\u2014a man ought certainly to abandon.\"\n\nLater writers chime in, thus (Vair\u0101gya-\u015bataka of Bhartrihari, iii. 32):\n\n\"Enjoyments are alloyed by fear of sickness,\nHigh rank may have a fall, abundant wealth\nIs subject to exactions, dignity\nEncounters risk of insult, strength is ever\nIn danger of enfeeblement by foes,\nA handsome form is jeopardized by women,\nScripture is open to assaults of critics,\nMerit incurs the spite of wicked men,\nThe body lives in constant dread of death,\nOne course alone is proof against alarm,\nRenounce the world, and safety may be won.\"\n\nAnd again (iii. 50):\n\n\"One hundred years\\(^1\\) is the appointed span\nOf human life, one half of this goes by\nIn sleep and night; one half the other half\nIn childhood and old age; the rest is passed\nIn sickness, separation, pain and service\u2014\nHow can a human being find delight\nIn such a life, vain as a watery bubble?\"\n\nThen we know that the removal of the pain caused by desire, ignorance, and bodily existence, was the chief aim of the Br\u0101hmanical systems of philosophy, quite as much as of the Buddhistic.\n\nThe very first aphorism of the S\u0101\u1e45khya system defines the chief aim of man to be complete deliverance from the misery and pain incident to corporeal existence. The Ny\u0101ya,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Centenarians (S'at\u0101yus, S'ata-varsha) seem to have been rather common in India in ancient times, if we may judge by the allusions to them in Manu and other works. See Manu, iii. 186; ii. 135, 137.\ntoo, in its second aphorism, declares that beatitude consists in complete deliverance from the pain resulting from birth, actions and false knowledge; while the Ved\u0101nta considers that ignorance alone fetters the soul of man to the body, and is therefore, of course, the cause of all pain and suffering. Then, again, as to the Buddha's so-called agnostic and atheistic ideas, it is said that he wholly repudiated the existence of a Supreme Being. And it is true that his highest being was the perfectly enlightened man, free from all ignorance, desire and suffering.\n\nYet, as already pointed out, he had great sympathy with Yoga ideas, and the Yoga philosophy not only asserted the existence of God, but defined His nature thus (ii. 24):\n\n\"God is a particular Spirit (purusha, which also means man), unaffected by pain, acts, the result of acts, and desires.\"\n\nSurely this might equally serve as a definition for the Buddha's perfect man, and it is difficult to suppose that one was not suggested by the other. It seems, also, difficult to reconcile the Buddha's predilection for Yoga with his disbelief in the existence of Spirit as distinct from bodily organism. But a little consideration will perhaps indicate how he was brought round to this disbelief.\n\nProbably before his so-called enlightenment and attainment of true knowledge, he was as firm a believer in the real existence of one Supreme Spirit as the most orthodox Br\u0101hman. He had become imbued with Br\u0101hmanical philosophy while sitting at the feet of his two teachers Udraka and Al\u0101ra. At that time there were no definite or finally formulated systems of philosophy, separated from each other by sharp lines. But the S\u0101\u1e45khya and Ved\u0101nta systems were assuming shape, and the doctrines they embodied had been roughly enunciated in the Upanishads, and were orally current.\n\nFor instance, it was then believed, as had been repeatedly stated in the Upanishads, that nothing really existed but one universally present impersonal Spirit, and that the whole visible world was really to be identified with that Spirit.\n\n1 By this I do not mean to imply that the Yoga definition was necessarily the first in point of time.\nThen it followed as an article of faith that man's spirit, deluded into a temporary false idea of separate personal existence by the illusion of ignorance, and maintained in that false idea through repeated births by the force of its own acts, was also identical with that One Spirit, and ultimately to be re-absorbed into it.\n\nNow it is obvious that to believe in the ultimate merging of man's personal spirit in One impersonal unconscious spirit, is virtually to deny the ultimate existence of any human spirit at all. Nay more\u2014it is virtually to deny the existence of a supreme universal Spirit also.\n\nFor how can a merely abstract universal Spirit, which is unconscious of personality, be regarded as possessing any real existence worth being called true life?\n\nTo assert that such a Spirit is pure abstract Entity or (according to Ved\u0101nta phraseology) pure Existence (without anything to exist for), pure Thought or even Consciousness (without anything to think about, or be conscious about), pure Joy (without anything to rejoice about), is practically to reduce it to pure non-entity.\n\nAll that Gautama did, therefore, was to bring common sense to bear in purging Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism of a dogma which appeared to him to be a mere figment and a sham.\n\nHe simply eliminated as meaningless and incapable of proof the doctrine of an impersonal incorporeal unconscious spirit, whether human or divine.\n\nAnd this leads us to the important question how far the great central Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical doctrine of soul-transmigration formed the basis of the Buddha's theory on the same subject. It might seem at first that the teaching of the Buddha would differ materially from that of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47s in regard to this central dogma. The real fact was that the divergence of the Buddhist doctrine from the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical theory of metempsychosis was not greater than was to be expected from the difference between the two systems in regard to the doctrine of soul and spirit. Of course Gautama was brought up to accept unreservedly the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical theory as minutely described in Manu's Law-book (chapter\nxii. 41, 50, and elsewhere). The great Br\u0101hmanical law-giver there set forth a triple order of transmigration through lower, middle, and higher planes of existence, resulting from good, middling, and bad acts, words and thoughts. Thus\u2014to instance only the lower\u2014the soul of a man who spoke ill of his teacher was destined to pass into an ass or a dog (ii. 201), the soul of a thief might occupy a mouse (xii. 62), the soul of one who neglected his caste-duties might pass into a demon (xii. 71, 72); and greater crimes might lead to the soul's being condemned to occupy plants, stones, and minerals. Then there was an intermediate condition of the soul, as a departed spirit or ghost, which would be miserable but for the \u015ar\u0101ddha ceremonies\u2014a source of constant profit to the Br\u0101hmans who performed them.\n\nThis passage of the soul through repeated bodies was the terrible incubus which it was the great object of Indian philosophers to remove. It was impossible, however, for Gautama to accept such ideas, denying as he did the existence of any soul or spirit at all, as distinct from material organization. He therefore put forth a view of his own, which was no doubt afterwards amplified by his followers into something more Buddhistic than Buddhism, just as Darwin's followers of the present day develope his teaching into something more Darwinian than Darwinism.\n\nAnd perhaps I may be pardoned for recapitulating here what so many P\u0101li scholars have already made clear, that every human being according to the Buddhist is composed of five constituents called Skandhas.\u00b9 And that these are:\n\n1. Form (r\u016bpa).\n2. Sensations (vedan\u0101).\n3. The faculty of perception (sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101).\n4. The faculty of conformation (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra), that is of forming ideas, dispositions (leading to actions, etc.).\n5. The faculty of thought or consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na).\n\nThis fifth is the most important of the five, and is the only kind of soul recognized by Buddhists. Theoretically it perishes with the other Skandhas at death, but practically it is continued, its exact counterpart being reproduced in a new body.\n\n\u00b9 Sometimes a human being is said to be made up of the five elements\u2014ether, air, fire, water, earth\u2014with a sixth called vij\u00f1\u0101na, consciousness.\nFor although it is true that when a man dies, all the Skandhas are dissolved, yet by the force of the merit and demerit (ku\u015bala and aku\u015bala) resulting from his actions (karma), a new set, of which consciousness (vij\u00f1ana) is still the dominant faculty, instantly starts into being. The process of the new creation is so instantaneous that it is equivalent to the continuance of the same personality, pervaded by the same consciousness, though it is only really connected with the previous personality by the force of acts done and character formed in that personality. In short (as Prof. Rhys Davids has well shown), to speak of transmigration of souls as a doctrine of Buddhism is misleading.\n\nA true Buddhist does not believe in the passing of a soul from one body to another, but in the passing on of what may be called act-force or character-force: that is to say, in the constant perpetuation and transmission of the aggregate of merit and demerit resulting from a man's acts so as to cause a continuous and connected series or succession of separate forms and personalities. It is this act-force alone, commonly called Karma, which is the connecting link between each man's past, present, and future bodies.\n\nIn its subtle and irresistible operation this accumulated Act-force may be compared to stored-up chemical or electric energy. It is a force which continually creates and re-creates the whole man, and perpetuates his personal identity (even in the absence of recollection) through separate forms, whether it compels him to ascend or descend in the scale of being. Be it observed, however, that the scale of descent appears to be limited in true Buddhism to animal organisms. It is not extended, as in the Br\u0101hmanical system, to plants and minerals, stocks and stones.\n\nEnough then has been stated to make it clear that the only creator recognized by Buddhists is, so to speak, Act-force. It is Act-force that creates worlds. It is Act-force that creates all beings in any of the six classes into which Buddhists divide all beings,\u2014namely, gods, men, demons, animals, ghosts and the dwellers in hell. We know that it is an axiom with modern European men of science that no\nforce can ever be lost, but must of necessity be transmitted onwards in some form or other. Now the Buddhist philosopher affirmed this very thing many centuries ago in regard to the force generated by a man's character and acts; and Br\u0101hmanical philosophy affirmed much the same.\n\nAnd what does the modern Positivist philosopher assert? He maintains that both body and mind are resolved into their elements at death. The only immortal part of us is what good deeds we have done, what good words or thoughts we leave behind us, to be made use of by our descendants and improved on for the elevation of humanity. And the aggregate of these, according to the Buddhist, constitute a force strong enough to re-create us.\n\nIt was thus that the force of Gautama's own acts had constantly re-created him through a long chain of successive personalities terminating in the perfect Buddha. And it was a peculiar characteristic of the perfect Buddha that he was gifted with the faculty of recollecting these personalities and describing them. The stories of at least five hundred and fifty of his births (J\u0101takas) are even now daily repeated to thousands of eager listeners in every Buddhist country over the greater part of Asia, and are believed to convey important moral lessons, much in the same manner, if I may be allowed to say so with all reverence, that the stories of the Old Testament patriarchs, prophets, and heroes, who are held by Christians to be types of Christ, are repeated as lessons in our own religious services.\n\nThe close inter-relationship between Br\u0101hmanism and Buddhism, and the interchange of ideas which took place between each, are again exemplified by the Buddhist birth-stories, many of which are obviously mere modifications or adaptations of old fables and folk-lore long current in India, while others have evidently been imported from Buddhism into the fables of Sanskrit literature.\n\nIn reading them one is constantly reminded of similar stories in the Pa\u00f1ca-tantra, Hitopade\u015ba, R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata. The noteworthy point about the repeated births of the Buddha is that there appears to have been no\nDarwinian rise from lower to higher forms; no working of the way gradually and progressively upwards; but, on the contrary, a mere jumble of metamorphoses. Thus we find him born twenty times as the god Indra, eighty-three times as an ascetic, fifty-eight times as a king, twenty-four times as a Br\u0101hman, once as a gamester, eighteen times as a monkey, six times as an elephant, eleven times as a deer, once as a dog, four times as a serpent, six times as a snipe, once as a frog, twice as a fish, forty-three times as a tree-god, twice as a pig, ten times as a lion, four times as a cock, twice as a thief, once as a devil-dancer, and so on in an endless irregular series, without any apparent conformity to any rule or law of development.\n\nAnother wise man of the East, who lived long before Gautama, spoke of \"the path of the just shining more and more unto the perfect day.\" Of this kind of progressive advance towards higher planes of perfection, the Indian sage knew nothing. Nor to the Buddha, of course, would such a doctrine as that of \"imputed Righteousness\" have conveyed any meaning whatever. With Gautama, righteousness and unrighteousness, holiness and sin, were merely forces causing in the one case a man's rebirth either in one of the heavens or in higher earthly corporeal forms, and in the other his rebirth in one of the hells or in lower corporeal forms. \"Not in the heavens,\" says the Dhamma-pada, \"not in the midst of the sea, not if thou hidest thyself away in the clefts of the mountains, wilt thou find a place where thou canst escape the force resulting from thy evil actions.\" And this Buddhist theory of every man's destiny being dependent on his own acts is quite in keeping with Br\u0101hmanical ideas expressed here and there in Sanskrit literature. Take for example the following: \u2014 P\u016brva-janma-kritam karma tad daivam iti kathyate, \"the act committed in a former birth that is called one's destiny\"; and again, \"As from a lump of clay a workman makes what he pleases, even so a man obtains\n\n1 Proverbs iv. 18.\n2 Dhammapada, 127, 219 (Dr. Oldenberg's Buddha, p. 243), with a slight variation of phraseology.\nwhatever destiny he has wrought out for himself\u201d (H\u00edtopade\u015ba, Introduction).\n\nWe are reminded too of a sentiment by a poet of our own\u2014\n\n\u201cOur deeds still travel with us from afar,\nAnd what we have been makes us what we are.\u201d\u00b9\n\nAnd of Don Quixote\u2019s saying, \u201cEvery man is the son of his own works;\u201d and of Wordsworth\u2019s, often quoted, \u201cThe child is father of the man;\u201d and of Longfellow\u2019s, \u201cLives of great men all remind us, we can make ourselves sublime.\u201d\n\nNor can ceremonies and rites performed by priests avail aught, nor can any devotion to personal gods avail aught, nor can anything whatever, except a man\u2019s own works and deservings, possess the slightest efficacy.\n\nNot that the gods and demons of the Hind\u016b Pantheon were held by the Buddhists to be mere myths. They existed in more subtle corporeal forms than those of men, and were, moreover, powerful beings, capable of working good or evil, benefit or harm; among them the Vedic god Indra being particularly revered.\n\nYet they were not omnipotent, and were wholly powerless to help or hinder any one on the road to his own salvation. If we turn next to that division of the Buddhist system which seeks to explain the operation of physical laws in the creation and dissolution of worlds, we are again reminded of Br\u0101hmanical ideas.\n\nWe have already noted that, notwithstanding the great difference between Buddhism and Br\u0101hmanism in regard to the doctrine of Spirit, the disagreement in the end appears to be more apparent than real. The same may be said with regard to Buddhist ideas on the subject of matter as opposed to spirit. Here, again, the gulf between the two systems appears at first to be impassable. It might indeed have been supposed that since Gautama denied the eternal existence of Spirit, he would at least give eternal existence to matter.\n\n\u00b9 These lines constitute the text of the 70th chapter of George Eliot\u2019s \u201cMiddlemarch.\u201d\nBut no; here, again, Buddhism allowed no permanence. Here, again, the only eternal thing is the Causality of Act-force.\n\nThe world around us, with all its visible phenomena, must be recognized as an existing entity, for we see before our eyes evidence of its actual existence. But it is an entity produced out of nonentity, and destined to lapse again into nonentity when its time is fulfilled.\n\nFor out of nothingness it came, and into nothingness must it return, to re-appear again, it is true, but as a wholly new creation brought into being by the accumulated force of its own acts, not evolved out of any eternally existing germ.\n\nIt is thus that the Universe is like an endless succession of countless bubbles which are for ever forming, expanding, drifting onwards, bursting and re-forming, each bubble owing its re-formation to the force generated by its vanished predecessor;\n\n\"Worlds on worlds are rolling ever\nFrom creation to decay:\nLike the bubbles on a river,\nSparkling, bursting, borne away.\"\u00b9\n\nOr like an interminable succession of wheels for ever coming into view, for ever rolling onwards, disappearing and reappearing; for ever passing from being to non-being, and again from non-being to being.\n\nAs to the question what force created the first world, the Buddha hazarded no opinion. He held this to be an inexplicable mystery.\n\nMany of these speculations also may be traced back to a Br\u0101hmanical source. We know that a fundamental doctrine of Br\u0101hmanism is *Ex nihilo nihil fit*. The true Ved\u0101nta philosophy makes the Universe proceed out of an eternal illusion, and students of Manu are familiar with the doctrine of Kalpas, or immense intervals of time (lasting for 4,320,000,000 earthly years), during which every creation attains perfection, and then again deteriorates and decays till it is utterly dissolved, not indeed into nothingness,\n\n\u00b9 Shelley's Hellas.\nbut into Brahman or simple unconscious Spirit, to be again evolved with the inauguration of a fresh Kalpa.\n\nCan it be affirmed, however, that pure unconscious spirit is virtually very different from pure nothingness?\n\nWhat says the author of a well-known hymn of the Rig-veda (x. 120)?\u2014\n\n\"In the beginning there was neither naught nor aught,\nThen there was neither sky nor atmosphere above.\nThen first came darkness hid in darkness, gloom in gloom;\nNext all was water, all a chaos indiscreet,\nIn which the One lay void, shrouded in nothingness.\"\n\nThen as to the Kalpas or ages of the world, we know that the Br\u0101hmanical notion of vast intervals of time exceeds the wildest dreams of modern geologists; yet the Buddhist conception is a mere exaggeration of the same notion.\n\nLet it be supposed, say Buddhist writers, that a solid rock forming a vast cube 16 miles high, and the same in length and breadth, were lightly rubbed once in a hundred years with a piece of the finest cloth, and by this slight friction reduced in countless ages to the size of a mango-seed; that would still give you no idea of the immense duration of a Buddhist Kalpa.\n\nThen again the Buddhist theory of numerous heavens and hells is nothing but an equally exaggerated expansion of the Br\u0101hmanical.\n\nOne of the earliest doctrines of Br\u0101hmanism was that earth, atmosphere, and heaven formed three worlds (Manu xi. 236), and we find Buddhist writers expanding these into three sets or groups of worlds, the first comprising the seven worlds of sensuous desire (K\u0101ma), viz. the earth and six heavens of the gods, all the inhabitants of which are capable of those sensual feelings and desires which lead to re-birth and death, and are therefore presided over by M\u0101ra, the deadly spirit of evil, whose sphere is the atmosphere, and who, as Prof. Oldenberg has well shown, is the counterpart of Mrityu, 'god of death,' in the Kathopanishad. The second group are called 'worlds of form' (R\u016bpa), divided according to four\nplaces of pure thought or meditation, and said to contain sixteen (or according to the Northern school seventeen or even eighteen) heavens. The third group are called 'formless worlds,' and contain four heavens, inhabited by beings who appear to exist in a highly sublimated transcendental state, untroubled by desires, feelings, or thoughts.\n\nSimilar hyperbole is used in describing the numerous Buddhist hells. Manu (iv. 88\u201390) reckons 21 hells or places of torment of various degrees, but these are expanded by Buddhists into 136, the eight principal of which are minutely described as terrible places of torture. The worst, called Avicii, is for unbelievers in and revilers of Buddha and his law.\n\nAnd now, before I conclude, I feel rather like a foolhardy person rushing recklessly over thorny ground when I venture to speak of the culminating Buddhist doctrine of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a? I think, however, I may assert two things about this much controverted expression without fear of being contradicted.\n\nThe first is that the word Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is an expression common both to Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism and Buddhism. It was probably current in Gautama's time, and certainly occurs in the Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata, parts of which may extend back to the time when Buddhism first arose in India. Of course, like some of the crucial theological terms of Christianity, it is capable of being interpreted differently, according to the views of the interpreter and the point he wishes to establish.\n\nThe second is that it would be about as unreasonable to restrict the expression Nirv\u0101\u1e47a to one meaning as it would be to restrict both Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism and Buddhism\u2014two most elastic, comprehensive and Protean systems\u2014which have constantly changed their front to suit changing circumstances and varying national peculiarities at different epochs and in different countries, to one hard and fast outline.\n\nNirv\u0101\u1e47a, no doubt, properly means 'a state of extinction' like that of a blown-out flame, but such extinction may have at least three meanings. It may indicate first a complete extinction of the fires\\(^1\\) of the passions and a total cessation\n\n\\(^1\\) The three chief fires are lust, infatuation and hatred.\nof all desires,\\(^1\\) especially the desire for individual existence\u2014a state achieved by all Arhats while still living in the world, and notably by the Buddha himself, at the moment when he attained Buddhahood, forty-four years before his complete Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. Then, secondly, there is a form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a insisted on by many, in which the leading idea seems to be a state of absolute release from all pain, accompanied by a sense of profound peace and rest, all fear of further bodily existences having terminated. This condition, implying as it does an actual consciousness of blissful repose, precludes the idea of utter annihilation. Then, thirdly, Nirv\u0101\u1e47a may stand for a state of entire cessation of re-births, with utter extinction of all conscious personal existence as attained by the Buddha, according to the orthodox view, at the moment of his death.\n\nNow with regard to the first form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014the extinction of the fires of the passions\u2014it must be borne in mind that a feeling of profound respect for such a condition was ingrained in the mind of every true Hind\u016b, and that there was really nothing new in this idea.\n\nEven to this day no one can have come in contact with the natives of India in their own country, without observing that for a genuine aristocratic Br\u0101hma\u1e47a to allow others to see him give way to any passion, to exhibit any emotion or enthusiasm, is regarded as a proof of weakness.\n\nWe can easily understand, therefore, that when the Buddha exhorted his followers to strive after a wholly impassive condition, he addressed a sympathetic audience.\n\nLong before his exhortations were heard in India, his fellow-countrymen held persons in the highest respect who claimed to have entirely suppressed their passions. The only peculiarity in Gautama's teaching was that he made this object incumbent on all true Buddhists alike, without exception. And this state of absolute impassiveness is well indicated to the eye by the usual attitude of the images which, after Gautama's death, were carved to represent him\n\n\\(^1\\) Prof. Rhys Davids holds that the Buddha did not advocate the suppression of good desires.\n\u2014an attitude of complete tranquillity, passionless composure, and dignified calm.\n\nThen, with regard to the second phase of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, in which the main idea is cessation of all pain, this seems to correspond very much to the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical Apavarga, described in the Ny\u0101ya, and defined by a commentator, V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, to be Sarva-du\u1e25kha-\u015bhed\u0101. I trust I shall not shock my Indian friends if I illustrate this condition by an example from the animal creation. In crossing the Indian Ocean, when unruffled by the slightest breeze, I have sometimes observed a jelly-fish floating on the surface of the transparent water, apparently lifeless, but really drinking in the warm fluid in a state of lazy blissful repose.\n\nNo Buddhist at least could look at such a sight without being reminded of the second idea of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014the idea of, so to speak, floating in perfect peace and cessation from all pain on a kind of ocean of conscious beatitude.\n\nWith regard to the highest form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014sometimes called Parinirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014absolute extinction of conscious personal existence and individuality, I have already shown that if this is to be distinguished from the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical idea of absorption into an impersonal unconscious spirit\u2014whereby the Ego of personal identity was utterly destroyed\u2014it is a distinction without much difference.\n\nWe may be quite sure that although the highest form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is the ultimate goal, and great object of all the loftiest aspirations of a true Buddhist, it has no place in the aims, efforts, and even in the thoughts of the ordinary adherents of Buddhism.\n\nThe apex of all the desires, the culminating point of all the ambition of the most religiously-minded Buddhists of the present day, point to a life in one of the heavens, while the great mass of the people aim only at escaping one of the hells, and elevating themselves to a higher condition of bodily existence in their next birth on this earth, and perhaps on that very part of this earth which is the scene of their present toils, joys and sorrows.\n\nAnd now, in conclusion, let me say a few words in regard\nto the Buddhist Code of Morality. It may be well asked, \"How can any scheme of morality find a place in a system which makes all life and action proceed from ignorance and error, and even virtuous conduct the product of a mistake as leading to continuity of life in higher states of being?\"\n\nThe inconsistency seems difficult of explanation, but it must be borne in mind that notwithstanding the constant insisting on the misery resulting from every form of existence, Gautama taught that the life of a virtuous man and life in heaven were better than a wicked life and a life in hell.\n\nHence accumulation of merit (kusala or punya or dharma) by good actions, by the practice of morality, self-renunciation, meditation and almsgiving, according to the example set by the Buddha himself, was made an absolutely indispensable factor in securing a man's re-birth in higher corporeal forms, with a view to the attainment of perfect knowledge, perfect self-renunciation, and perfect deliverance from individual being at some future period.\n\nIndeed, both Buddhism and Br\u0101hmanism might be well summed up in a few words as schemes for the intense accumulation of self-righteousness, with a view to getting rid of self; but let it be clearly understood that the self to be got rid of is not the self spoken of in Christianity, but the self of individuality and continued personal conscious existence.\n\nAnd of the two systems Buddhism is certainly entitled to the palm as the most perfect art of merit-making. For every Buddhist is like a trader who keeps a ledger, with a regular debtor and creditor account, and a daily entry of profit and loss.\n\nHe is forbidden to store up a money-balance in a worldly bank, but he is urged to be constantly accumulating a merit-balance in the bank of Karma.\n\nTo be righteous in a Christian sense, a man must be God-like, and to be righteous in a Buddhistic sense, a man must be Buddha-like; but the righteousness of the Buddhist is not the perfection of holiness, nor even the perfection of\nself-enlightenment by the dissipation of ignorance. It is the perfection of merit-making, whereby the complete extinction of individual existence is achieved.\n\nI do not, of course, mean to imply that the Buddhist system of morality is not of a very high order.\n\nOften, indeed, it rises to the highest plane of Christian teaching, but the same can be said of the moral code existing among Br\u0101hmans and Hind\u016bs before the Buddha's time, and in nothing is the close connection between Buddhism and Br\u0101hmanism better shown than in the moral precepts of these two systems which are sometimes nearly identical.\n\nThere is scarcely a sentiment in the Dhammapada and Sutta-nip\u0101ta which may not be matched by something similar in either Manu, the Epic poems, or the N\u012bti-\u015b\u0101stras of Sanskrit literature.\n\nMost certainly the highest morality of both Buddhists and Br\u0101hmans has this in common, that both had an ultimate reference to their own interests, and that both inculcated doing good to others, with a view to laying up such a store of merit for themselves as might secure their own advancement in future states of corporeal existence.\nART. IX.\u2014The Stories of J\u012bm\u016btav\u0101hana, and of Har\u012b\u015barman.\n\nTranslated by the Rev. B. Hale Wortham, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe Buddhist legend of J\u012bm\u016btav\u0101hana is related twice in the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, in the 22nd Tar\u0101nga, from which the following translation is made, as well as in the 90th Tar\u0101nga. The two versions of the legend differ somewhat in their treatment of the story, the latter version giving a fuller account of J\u012bm\u016btav\u0101hana\u2019s courtship and home-life, at the same time omitting all account of his actions in a former birth, and their results. The legend has also been dramatised in the N\u0101g\u0101nanda, or Joy of the Snake World, a highly sensational drama, remarkable as being the only known existing drama commencing with an invocation to Buddha. The drama follows the lines of the legend as laid down in Tar\u0101nga 90.\n\nThe Story of J\u012bm\u016btav\u0101hana (Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, Tar\u0101nga 22, \u015aloka 16).\n\nA mountain called the Snowclad on this earth\nUprears its mighty form, the chief of hills,\nFather of Parvati,\u2014of Gauri\u2019s spouse\nThe spiritual head. In that great mount,\nThe home of the Vidy\u0101dharas, once dwelt\nTheir lord, J\u012bm\u016btaketu. To his house\nBelonged a \u201cwishing tree,\u201d the legacy\nOf his forefathers, from its nature called\n\u201cThe giver of desires.\u201d Then the king\nOne day approached that heaven-sent tree and said,\nIn supplicating tones: \u201cO deity!\nWho ever grantest all we ask or seek,\nGive me, I pray thee, now, a virtuous son,\nFor I am childless.\" \"King,\" replied the tree,\n\"Thy prayer is granted, thou shalt have a son;\nWithin his mind shall dwell the memory\nOf former births; he shall be liberal,\nThe lover of all creatures.\" Then the king,\nFilled with delight, in adoration bowed\nBefore the tree, and straightway to his Queen\nBore the glad tidings. Soon a son was born,\nAnd to the boy the father gave the name\nJimutavahana. As time went on\nThe youth increased in stature, while the love\nWhich filled his inmost nature, step by step,\nGrew with his outward form. At last, the prince,\nProclaimed Successor to his father's crown,\nFilled with compassion for all living things\nThat move upon this earth, in secret spoke,\nAnd thus addressed his father, who with joy\nHeard his son's words. \"Surely I know full well\nThat all things perish: nothing on the earth\nHas an abiding place; one thing alone,\u2014\nThe glory of the virtuous, replete\nWith purity,\u2014though countless ages pass,\nShall never fail. If men of noble mind\nHave gained renown by showering kindnesses\nOn others, more than life, far more than wealth,\nThey value that fair glory. As for us\u2014\nIf our good fortune\u2014our prosperity\u2014\nBe for ourselves alone, nor overflow\nOn the less fortunate, then like a flash\nOf lightning shall our fortune pass away,\nAnd vanish into air. This 'Wishing tree'\nGrants all that we desire; if, then, we pray\nThe tree to pour its blessings o'er the world,\nNor keep them selfishly,\u2014then shall its fruit\nBe ours indeed. So let me supplicate\nThe wishing tree that by its boundless wealth\nThe multitudes of men, who pass their lives\nIn poverty, may be relieved.\u201d Thus spoke\nJim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana: gladly his sire\nAssented, and the youth invoked the tree.\n\u201cO Bounteous tree! The giver of all good\nTo us; fulfil this day our earnest prayer;\nBanish from earth all want and poverty.\nHail to thee! friendly one! Thou hast been sent\nTo bless the world with wealth, therefore I pray\nBestow on men the wealth that they desire.\u201d\nIn answer to Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana\nThe self-denying one, the tree sent down\nGold in abundant showers on the earth,\nWhile all mankind rejoiced. Who could have bent\nThe wishing tree to carry out his will\nAnd rain down plenty, even though he were\nIncarnate Wisdom, but the glorious\nJim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana? Therefore to him\nWere all the regions of the earth fast bound\nBy ties of gratitude, and o'er the heav'n\nHis spotless fame extended far and wide.\nThen the relations of the King uprose,\u2014\nEven of King Jim\u00fbtaketu,\u2014full\nOf hatred, since the throne was firmly fixed\nBy his son's glory; and their minds they set\nTo overcome that place wherein the tree,\nThe giver of all blessings, grew,\u2014a place\nUnfortified, easy to be o'ercome.\nTherefore they met together, fully bent\nOn war. Then said Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana,\nCalm and composed, \u201cFather! this life of ours\nIs even as a bubble on the stream.\nWhy should we then desire prosperity?\nFor even as a lamp, whose tongue of flame\nFlickers before the wind, so among men\nIs fortune. Who could ever hope to gain\n(If he were wise at least) prosperity\nFrom other's harm or death? I will not fight\nWith kinsmen; I will rather leave my realm\nAnd dwell within the forest. Let them be!\nWe will not slay these miserable men,\nOur brothers and our kin.\u201d His father said,\nFirmly resolved in mind: \u201cI, too, my son!\nWill go with you, for I am old and grey,\nAnd how should love for power abide in me\nSince thou, all young and vigorous, hast cast\nThy realm aside, as though it were but straw,\nThrough love and pity?\u201d Thus the King approved\nJim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana\u2019s advice, and left\nHis realm, departing with his wife and son\nTo Mount Malaya. There the youth abode\nWithin a grove, the Siddha\u2019s dwelling-place,\nWhere trees of sandal shadowed o\u2019er the brooks,\nMaking his father\u2019s life his chiefest care.\nAnd while he sojourned there, the Siddha prince,\nOne Mitr\u00e2vasu, took him as a friend,\nWhose maiden sister in a former birth\nHad loved Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana. He saw,\nAnd filled with perfect wisdom knew again\nThe damsel he had loved. Their mutual glance,\nLike the frail meshes of the net which holds\nThe captive deer, ensnared each other\u2019s souls.\n\nOne day the Siddha prince, his countenance\nBeaming with joy, in sudden thought addressed\nJim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana, whom the three worlds\nAdored: \u201cA younger sister dwells with me,\nCalled Malayavat\u00ee: to thee I give\nThe maiden; O! do not refuse my gift!\u201d\nThen spoke Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana, and said:\n\u201cPrince! in a former birth she was my wife,\nThou too my friend, even as dear to me\nAs my own heart; to me is given the power\nOf calling back to mind births past and gone.\u201d\nThen Mitr\u00e2vasu said: \u201cTell me, I pray,\nThe story of thy former births, I long\nTo hear it.\u201d And Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana,\nLoving towards all creatures, answered:\n\"Hear then my tale: Once in a former birth\nAs a Vidy\u00e2dhara, flying through space,\nI passed Him\u00e2laya, whose lofty peaks\nShone forth beneath me, and I was beheld\nBy \u0160iva, sporting with his spouse. The god\nEnraged, because my towering flight\nBore me above him, with a curse pronounced\nThis sentence on me: 'In the world of men\nIn mortal guise thou shalt be born: a wife\nFrom the Vidy\u00e2dharas thou shalt obtain.\nThou shalt appoint thy son to occupy\nThy room, and then once more remembering\nThy former birth, thou shalt again be born\nAs a Vidy\u00e2dhara.' Thus \u0160iva spoke,\nYet while he cursed, foretelling too the end\nOf his Anathema, and disappeared.\nSoon after, in a merchant's family\nI entered human form, and lived the son\nOf a rich trader in a city named\nVallabh\u00ee: Vasudatta was the name\nBestowed on me. Time passed; to manhood grown,\nMy father sent me forth, a retinue\nOf servants following, to some far land\nTo traffic. On my journey, I was seized\nBy robbers in a forest; stripped of all\nMy merchandise, they loaded me with chains\nAnd dragged me to their village, to the shrine\nOf Durg\u00e2, where a silken banner waved,\nCrimson and long, like as it were the tongue\nOf Death, all eagerness to lick the blood\nOf living things. Then to Pulindaka,\nTheir chief, they brought me, who was worshipping\nBefore the goddess, that within her shrine\nI might be offered as a sacrifice.\nHe saw me, and although a Savara,\nAt once he felt his heart within him melt\nIn pity for my fate; a causeless love\nWhich seems to spring unbidden in the heart\nTells us of friendship in a former birth.\nThus was I saved from slaughter by the King,\nWho, still intent upon the sacrifice,\nPrepared to make the offering of himself,\nAnd so complete the rite. But while he thought\nThereon, a voice from heaven said: 'O king!\nHurt not thyself! Ask of me what thou wilt,\nIt shall be granted thee, for thou hast been\nApproved of me.' Then filled with joy the king\nReplied: 'Since thou, O goddess, hast approved\nMy deeds, what should I further need? but yet\u2014\nOne thing I ask of thee: in births to come,\nMay love between me and the merchant's son\nEver remain unchanged.' 'It shall be so,'\n\nAnswered the goddess. Then the Savara\nRestored me to my home loaded with wealth.\nMy father, seeing that I had returned\nFrom a far-distant land, the jaws of death\nBarely escaped, held a great festival\nTo do me honour. Then I saw again\nAfter some time had passed the Savara chief\nLed in a prisoner before the king\nFor sentence and for punishment: his crime\nThe plunder of a caravan. Straightway\nI told my father, and I prayed the king\nTo spare the Savara. My prayer was heard\nAnd with a mighty sum of gold I saved\nThe Savara chief from death. Thus I repaid\nHis benefits, and to my own abode\nI brought him home, and long I tended him\nWith loving care. After a time he turned\nDeparting to his village, while his heart\nTender with love was fixed upon me still.\nAnd then he roamed the earth, seeking a gift\nWorthy the kindnesses which I had showed\nTowards him. As he wandered here and there,\nHe saw a lake before him, on its banks\nA woman riding on a lion, young\nAnd beautiful. The Savara, amazed,\nThought thus within himself. 'Who may this be?\nIs she a mortal? How then does she ride\nUpon a lion? Can she be divine?\nBut if a goddess, how should such as I\nBehold her? Surely clad in human form\nI see her as the merit which I gained\nIn former births. Oh! could I only win\nHer for my friend in marriage,\u2014then indeed\nI should bestow on him a just reward\nFor all his benefits.' The Savara,\nThus thinking in himself, respectfully\nAdvanced to greet the maiden, who returned\nHis salutation. 'Who art thou?' she said\n'Why hast thou come to this far-distant land?'\n'I am a Savara prince,' he made reply,\n'Lo! I am seeking treasure in this wood,\nAnd at the sight of thee I called to mind\nThe friend who saved my life, the merchant's son.\nMatchless is he in youth and comeliness,\nA very fount of nectar to the world,\nEven as thou art. Fortunate the lot\nOf that fair maid who shall bestow her hand\nOn one so full of generosity,\nSo full of love, of patience, of compassion.\nIf this surpassing lovely form of thine\nShould fail of such a destiny, Alas!\nThen K\u00e2ma bears indeed his bow in vain.'\nThe maiden's mind by these enticing words\nWas borne away, as though the spells of love\nBewildered her. 'Where is this friend of thine?'\nShe said, under love's prompting. 'Bring him here!\nThat I may see him.' 'Even so,' replied\nThe Savara, and full of joy returned\nTo seek his friend, thinking his object gained.\nThen bringing with him treasures\u2014pearls and musk,\nHe came to our abode, and entering in,\nWhile all our house saluted him, he gave\nMy sire the present, worth a mighty sum\nOf gold. After the day and following night\nHad passed in feasting, then the Savara\nTook me aside, and told me privately\nThe story of the maiden; and to me,\nFull of excitement at the tale, he said,\n'Come there with me, my friend!' When nightfall came,\nThe Savara departed, bearing me\nAlong with him. And when the morning light\nShone forth, my father knew that I had gone\nTogether with the Savara prince; but yet,\nConfiding in the prince's love for me,\nHe felt no grief. And I, as time went on,\nJourneyed towards Himalaya; the prince\nTending me on the way with loving care.\nAt length, one evening, we beheld the lake\nBefore our eyes, and in the forest bounds\nWe tarried all that night, eating the fruits\nWhich grew within the wood,\u2014that lovely wood\nWherein the ground was strewed with creeper flowers,\nWhile all the air resounded with the hum\nOf bees: sweet gentle breezes blew,\u2014the herbs\nSent forth a gleaming light even like lamps.\nAnd then all night we rested in that wood\u2014\nThe chamber of delight. Next day the maid,\nRiding upon the lion, like the moon\nResting upon an autumn cloud, drew near.\nAs she approached, my mind at every step\nFlew as it were to meet her, and the prince,\nAdvancing tow'rs her, said in courteous tones:\u2014\n'Goddess! I offer thee my dearest friend,\nAccept him as thy bridegroom.' 'Bring thy friend\nHither,' she answered, and with eyes of love\nShe glanced at me approaching her, and said,\n'This friend of thine must surely be a god!\nNo mortal has so beautiful a form.'\n'Fair one! I am a mortal,' I replied.\n'A merchant's son, who dwells in Vallabhi.\nMy father by the favour of the god\nWho wears upon his head the crescent moon\nReceived me as his son.' Then said the maid,\nHer eyes cast down through modesty, 'The god\nHath now fulfilled his promise; for he deigned\nTo tell me in a dream, \"To-morrow's sun\nShall show thy spouse to thee.\" Lo! here I find\nIn thee my husband.' Thus she charmed my mind\nWith speech of nectar sweetness. Then the wood\nWe quitted, journeying homewards that the rites\nOf marriage might be duly solemnized;\nAnd mounted on the lion, in my arms\nHolding the maiden, we reached Vallabhi.\nThen lo! with wonder filled the people ran\nTo tell my father; marvelling, he came\nTo greet me. When he saw the gracefulness\nAnd beauty of the maiden, and perceived\nHow fitly I had chosen her, his heart\nRejoiced, and to our marriage feast he called\nHer friends and relatives. Thus she became\nMy spouse, and all my life was filled with peace\nAnd happiness, blessed with a virtuous wife.\nAt length, as time went by, old age crept on,\nAnd I, feeling disgust for earthly things\nAnd weariness of life, I made my son\nThe ruler of my kingdom. Then I turned,\nCasting aside my royal state, and went\nInto the forest. There intense desire\nTo leave this mortal frame possessed my mind.\nTherefore I meditated on the deity\nAnd from the mountain side I threw myself\nDown headlong. So I quitted life. Now born\nAgain into the world, thou seest me\nJim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana. To me belongs\nThe recollection of my former births.\nThou Mitr\u00e2vasu art the Savara prince,\nAnd this thy sister, Malayavat\u00ee,\nIs that same damsel born again, whom I,\nThe merchant's son, chose in my former birth\nTo be my bride. Therefore 'tis right and good\nThat I should marry her. First do thou go\nAnd tell my parents: truly shalt thou gain\nThy whole desire.\" When Mitr\u0101vasu heard\nThe story of Jim\u016btav\u0101hana,\nHe told his parents, who were filled with joy,\nAnd gave their daughter Malayavat\u012b\nIn marriage to Jim\u016btav\u0101hana,\nAnd the pair dwelt in great prosperity\nAnd happiness upon Malaya's mount.\nOnce on a time Jim\u016btav\u0101hana\nWas wandering amid the woods that gird\nThe shore; and in that place he saw a man\nFearful and trembling; and with loud lament\nHis mother followed, while the man would turn\nAnd bid his mother leave him, but with tears\nShe never ceased to follow him. Behind\nThe pair there followed one in soldier's garb,\nWho led the man up to a lofty rock\nAnd left him. Then Jim\u016btav\u0101hana\nSpoke to the man and said, \"Tell me, I pray,\nWho art thou? Why does this thy mother weep\nFor thee.\" Then said the man, \"In bygone times\nKadr\u016b and Vinat\u0101, K\u0101syapa's wives,\nHeld a dispute. The horses of the sun\nWere black,\" so one declared,\u2014the other said\nThat they were white. The one who erred should serve\nThe other as a slave. Thus each agreed.\nThe subtle-minded Kadr\u016b, fully bent\nOn victory, induced her sons the snakes\nTo send forth showers of venom o'er the steeds;\nAnd then she showed them all defiled and black\nTo Vinat\u0101. So by an artifice\nWas Vinat\u0101 o'ercome and made a slave.\nHow terrible is woman's spite which wreaks\nVengeance upon its kind. Then came the son\nOf Vinat\u0101, Garu\u1e0da, and he begged\nHis mother. Then the sons of Kadru said,\n'Garu\u1e0da! lo! the gods have now begun\nTo churn the sea of milk. If thou wilt bring\nThe nectar from that sea, O mighty chief,\nAnd give it us, thou shalt indeed redeem\nThy mother from her bonds of slavery.'\nThen to the sea of milk Garu\u1e0da went,\nAnd showed his mighty power, if by that means\nHe might obtain the nectar. Vish\u1e47u, pleased\nWith that display of might, exclaimed, 'Indeed\nThou hast delighted me! Ask what thou wilt,\nAnd I will give it thee.' Garu\u1e0da, wroth,\nBecause his mother had been made a slave,\nReplied, 'I pray thee may the snakes become\nMy food.' The god assented. So he gained\nThe nectar by his valour, and a boon\nFrom Vish\u1e47u. As Garu\u1e0da turned to go,\nThere met him Indra. 'King of birds!' he said,\n'I know thine errand; may thy power and might\nRestrain these foolish snakes lest they consume\nThe nectar; and enable me to take\nIt from them.' When Garu\u1e0da heard these words,\nHe willingly complied, and to the snakes\nBearing the nectar in his hand he went,\nRejoicing in the thought of Vish\u1e47u's boon;\nThen standing at a distance, he addressed\nThe snakes, filled with alarm at Vish\u1e47u's gift:\u2014\n'Here is the nectar, lo! I bring it you,\nTake it,\u2014release my mother; if you fear\nMy power, I will place it on a bed\nOf Darbha grass; and when you have restored\nMy mother I will go, and you can take\nThe nectar thence.' All willingly the snakes\nAssented, and upon a sacred bed\nOf Ku\u015ba grass, Garu\u1e0da placed the bowl\nOf nectar, and departed, having freed\nHis mother. Then the snakes approached to taste\nThe nectar, but with sudden swoop from heaven\nThe mighty Indra fell, and bore away\nThe nectar from its bed of Darbha grass.\nThen in despair the serpents licked the grass,\nOne single drop of nectar may remain\n(They thought) upon the grass; and thus their tongues\nWere split, and they became all double-tongued,\nNor gain\u00e9d aught. What can the greedy hope\nTo gain but ridicule? And so the snakes\nFailed to obtain the nectar, while their foe,\nGaru\u1e0da, fell upon them, and began,\nStrong in the gift of Vish\u1e47u, to devour\nThem up. And all the snakes in P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la\nWere dead with fear, the females cast their young,\nOver the serpent race destruction seemed\nTo hang. Then V\u0101suki, the serpent King,\nSeeing his enemy come day by day,\nForesaw the ruin of the serpent world,\nAnd as a suppliant to Garu\u1e0da said:\n\u2018O mighty one! whose power and majesty\nAre past resisting, as each day goes by\nOne serpent will I send thee, king of birds,\nAnd on that sandy hill, hard by the sea,\nMy offering shalt thou find: nor enter thou\nP\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la day by day, destroying all\nThe serpent race; for then thy life\nWill lose its object.\u2019 Thus spoke V\u0101suki.\nGaru\u1e0da to his words assented. In this place\nEach day he eats the snake V\u0101suki sends.\nSo have innumerable serpents met\nTheir death. I am a serpent too. My name\nIs \u015aankach\u016b\u1e0da, and my time is come\nTo furnish forth a meal. The serpent King\nHas therefore sent me to this rock of death,\nWhither my mother follows me with tears\nAnd lamentations sore.\u201d Then grief possessed\nJim\u016btav\u0101hana, and thus he spoke:\n\u201cAh! but a coward is that king of thine!\nHe offers to his enemy as food\nThe people of his realm! Why did he not\nFirst offer up himself? Oh, base thy King!\nSince he the overthrow of all his race\nUnmoved can witness. Ah! how great a sin!\nGaru\u1e0da too commits. Lo! mighty sins\nDo even mighty men commit, impelled\nBy selfish greediness. Cheer up, my friend!\nI will deliver thee, surrendering\nMy body to Garu\u1e0da.\u201d \u201cMighty one!\u201d\nResponded \u015aankach\u016bda; \u201cThis be far\nFrom thee! Thou wouldest not destroy a gem\nTo save a bit of glass. Never will I\nEndure that foul disgrace through me should fall\nUpon my race.\u201d Thus tried he to dissuade\nJim\u016b\u1e6dav\u0101hana, and to the shrine\nOf \u015aiva went, thinking his time was come,\nTo offer adoration to the god.\nAnd then indeed Jim\u016b\u1e6dav\u0101hana,\nOf pity and compassion, as it were,\nThe very treasure house\u2014thought that the chance\nHad come, by offering of himself, to save\nThe serpent\u2019s life. Therefore he quickly sent\nMitr\u0101vasu away, on some pretence.\nThen came Garu\u1e0da, and immediately\nThe earth began to tremble at the wind\nOf his advancing wings, as though it shook\nIn wonder at the steadfast bravery\nOf the great-minded one. Then rose in haste\nJim\u016b\u1e6dav\u0101hana, and filled with love\nFor living things, mounted upon the rock\nOf death, knowing the quaking earth foretold\nThe advent of Garu\u1e0da. Then swooped down\nThe serpent\u2019s enemy\u2014the heavens grew dark\nAt his dread shadow, and he bore away\nJim\u016b\u1e6dav\u0101hana, while drops of blood\nFlowed from the hero, and his jewelled crest\nFell to the ground, torn by Garu\u1e0da\u2019s beak.\nAnd flying to the topmost mountain peak,\nThe king of birds began to eat his prey.\nThen instantly there fell from heaven a rain\nOf flowers, while Garu\u1e0da at the sight\nWas filled with wonder. Soon this snake returned\nFresh from Gokar\u1e47a's shrine, and when he saw\nThe rock of death wet with the drops of blood,\n\"Surely the mighty-minded one, (he thought)\nHas offered up his life to ransom mine.\nOh, whither has Garu\u1e0da borne him hence?\nLo! I will search for him, it may so chance\nThat I may find him.\" Following the track\nLeft by the drops of blood, the serpent went.\nMeanwhile Garu\u1e0da with amazement saw\nThat gladness filled Jim\u016btav\u0101hana.\nHe ceased to eat him, and within himself\nHe thought:\u2014\"Who can this be? This must be one\nTo whom I have no right; for misery\nHas no abode within his constant mind.\nLo! he rejoices in his fate!\" Then said\nJim\u016btav\u0101hana, upon his aim\nIntent:\u2014\"O King of birds! there still remains\nWithin my body flesh and blood: I pray\nWhy hast thou ceased to feed upon my form,\nSeeing thy hunger is not satisfied?\"\nFilled with astonishment, the King of birds\nCeased from his meal, and said, \"O! mighty one!\nSurely thou art no snake; I pray thee, say,\nWho art thou?\" Then Jim\u016btav\u0101hana\n(His answer just begun, \"I am a snake!\nEat me, I pray, for men of constant mind\nWith perseverance carry through the task\nThey have in hand,\") heard from afar the voice\nOf \u015aankach\u016b\u1e0da, \"King of birds! desist!\nI am the snake prepared for thee! Alas!\nHow camest thou in recklessness and haste\nTo err so grievously?\" Confusion seized\nGaru\u1e0da, and Jim\u016btav\u0101hana\nWas overcome with grief, for his desire\nHad fled, all unfulfilled. At last the truth\nWas clear before Garu\u1e0da, and he knew\nHis prey was not a serpent, but the king\nOf the Vidy\u0101dhara\u015b. Then deepest pain\nPossessed his mind. \"Alas! my cruelty!\"\nHe said; \"What sin has that brought forth in me!\nHow easily does sin lay hold on those\nWho follow after sin! This noble one\nWho for another's good has sacrificed\nHimself, despising this illusive world,\nNor fears my power\u2014all honour be to him,\nAnd praise unceasing!\" Then the king of birds,\nTo purify himself, into the flames\nWas rushing headlong. \"King of birds,\" exclaimed\nJim\u016btav\u0101hana, \"Do not despair!\nIf thou wouldst truly turn from guilt\u2014repent!\nSlay no more serpents for thy food\u2014repent\nOf those which thou didst eat in times gone by;\nSo shalt thou find a remedy for guilt,\nNone other may avail.\" The king of birds\nHeard and rejoiced, determined to repent,\nObedient to Jim\u016btav\u0101hana\nAs to a ghostly father. Then to heaven\nHe went to bring down nectar, to revive\nThe wounded prince, and to restore to life\nThe serpents who had perished, and whose bones\nAlone were left. Then Gaur\u012b came from heaven\nIn human form, and on the mighty one\nShe poured forth showers of nectar: and his limbs,\nRenewed in greater beauty than before,\nWere given back to him, while through the sky\nThe heavenly music rang, and all the gods\nRejoiced. Garu\u1e0da, too, returned from heaven,\nBearing the nectar; and along the shore\nHe sprinkled the life-giving drops. And lo!\nThe serpents that had perished, once again\nRose up, clothed with the forms that they had worn\nIn life, and filled that forest by the shore\u2014\nCrowds upon crowds of serpents pressing on;\u2014\nIt seemed even as though the serpent world,\nForgetting their dread enemy, had come\nTo see and honour their deliverer.\nAnd round Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana his friends,\nHis wife, his parents, clustered, and they praised\nHim for his glory, and undying fame.\nCould aught but triumph reign in word or thought\nSince joy had banished pain. Then to his home,\nTogether with his wife, and friend, and son,\nJim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana, compassionate\nTowards all living things, departing, reigned\nThe sovereign lord of the Vidy\u00e2dhara.\n\nThe Story of Har\u00eesarman (Kath\u00e2 Sarit S\u00e2gara, Tar\u00e2nga 30, \u0160loka 92).\n\nOnce on a time within a certain town\nThere lived a Br\u00e2hman; he was very poor,\nAnd foolish too. Moreover, he had naught\nWherewith to earn a livelihood; his case\nWas altogether very bad. Besides he had\nNo end of children; thus the deity\nWould punish him for all the wicked deeds\nCommitted in some former life. So then\nThe Br\u00e2hman (Har\u00eesarman was his name)\nWandered about, with all his family,\nTo beg for alms: and in his wanderings\nHe chanced upon a village. There he stayed,\nAnd in a rich householder\u2019s family\nHe entered into service. While his sons\nTended the cows, and kept their master\u2019s goods,\nHis wife served him, and in a dwelling near\nHe lived himself, performing day by day\nThe tasks appointed in his master\u2019s house.\nOne day the daughter of the householder\nWas married, and a mighty feast was made,\nAnd friends from far and near invited came.\nThen was the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 pleased, because he thought\nThat he would cram himself up to the throat\nWith dainties; but no one remembered him\nNor asked him to the feast. When night had come,\nFilled with distress because his hopes had failed,\nHe called his wife to him:\u2014\"Stupid,\" he said,\n\"And poor am I: men therefore with disdain\nPut me aside: now by an artifice\nWill I deceive them, and I shall appear\nWise and discerning. This must be your part\nTo tell my master, when you have the chance,\nThat I am learned in magic art. Respect\nShall then be paid me.\" So a plan he formed\nAnd secretly by night he stole the horse\nOn which the bridegroom rode. When morning came,\nThe bridegroom's men searched far and near, but found\nHim not, for Har\u012b\u015barman had concealed\nThe horse in some far-distant place. Then came\nThe Br\u0101hma\u1e47's wife and said, \"Why not consult\nMy husband? for he knows astrology\nAnd all the sciences. Lo! he will find\nThe horse for you.\" Therefore the householder\nSent messengers to ask the Br\u0101hma\u1e47's help.\nThen Har\u012b\u015barman said, \"To-day the horse\nIs stolen, and you call me to your house,\n'Twas only yesterday, I was ignored.\"\n\"I pray thee pardon,\" said the householder,\n\"Indeed we did forget:\"\u2014with such like words\nHe turned aside the Br\u0101hma\u1e47's wrath, and said,\n\"Tell me, where is the horse?\" The Br\u0101hma\u1e47 drew\nElaborate diagrams, and feigned to make\nDeep calculations. \"You will find the horse\n(At last he said) in such and such a place,\nBe quick and fetch him home, before the thieves\nConvey him further.\" Then they went and found\nThe horse and brought him back, praising the skill\nOf Hari\u015barman. All men honoured him\nAnd took him for a sage. It came to pass\nAfter some time the palace of the king\nWas entered by a thief, who carried off\nJewels and gold. Now Hari\u015barman's fame\nHad reached the royal ears, therefore the king\nSent for the Br\u0101hman. He, when, summoned came,\nBut gave no answer, trying to evade\nThe question. \"When to-morrow comes,\" he said,\n\"An answer I will give you.\" Then the king\nLocked Hari\u015barman up within a room\nAnd placed a watch. Filled with despondency,\nThe Br\u0101hman thought but little would avail\nAll his pretended wisdom. In that place\nThere was a maid called Jihv\u0101; it so chanced\nThat she, helped by her brother, was the thief.\nThis maid, o'ercome with terror at the skill\nOf Hari\u015barman, listened at the door\nBy night, intent on finding out, if possible,\nWhat he might be about. Just at that time\nThe Br\u0101hman, who was in the room alone,\nTaking to task his tongue, which had assumed\nTo know that which it knew not, said:\u2014\"Alas!\nO Jihv\u0101!\u00b9 What is this that thou hast done\nThrough lust of pleasure? Evil one! Endure\nThy punishment.\" The servant, terrified,\nThought that her crime was known, and entering in,\nFell at the Br\u0101hman's feet, whom she supposed\nTo have all knowledge, and she said:\u2014\"O Sir!\n'Tis true! I am the thief! I Jihv\u0101 stole\nThe gold and jewels, and I buried them\nUnder the roots of a pomegranate tree\nBehind the palace. Take the gold I pray\nWhich I have left, and spare me, I confess\nMy crime.\" When Hari\u015barman heard these words,\n\n\u00b9 Jihv\u0101 means 'tongue,' as well as being a proper name.\nHe said with haughtiness: \"I know all this! Depart! The future, past, and present lie Within my ken; but I will not denounce You as the thief, because you are a wretch Who have implored my mercy. Bring to me Whatever gold you have.\" Without delay The maid departed. Then the Br\u00e2hman thought In wonder: \"That which seemed impossible Fate has accomplished, as it were in sport,\u2014 Fate well disposed to me. Calamity Seemed close at hand, but yet I have attained Success beyond my hopes. I blamed my tongue, The cause of all my ills, when suddenly Before my very feet Jihv\u00e2 the thief Falls prostrate. Secret crimes are brought to light (This I perceive) by fear.\" With thoughts like these He passed the night rejoicing. Morning dawned, And then, he led the king, with much pretence Of wisdom, to the garden where the gold Had been concealed. Showing him what remained, He said the thief had carried part away. Then was the king delighted, and he gave To Hari\u015barman honours and rewards. But Devajn\u00e2nin, the chief minister, Said to the king in private, whispering Into his ear: \"How should a man possess Knowledge like this, which ordinary men May not attain, seeing his ignorance. He knows naught of the \u015aastras,\u2014of the books Treating of science. So you may be sure He has a secret partnership with thieves, And makes his living by dishonest means. Try him again by some new artifice\u2014 And test his wisdom.\" To this scheme the king Gladly assented, and he placed a frog Within a covered pitcher, newly bought, And said to Hari\u015barman, \"Tell me now, What is within this pitcher? If you guess\nArigh, then will I honour you indeed.\"\nThe Br\u00e2hman heard these words, and thought his end\nHad come at length: then rose within his mind\nThe name of \"frog,\" by which in sportiveness\nHis father used to call him; suddenly,\nImpelled by some divinity, he spoke,\nLamenting his untimely fate, and said,\nAddressing thus himself, \"Poor little frog!\nSurely this pitcher is the overthrow\nOf all your hopes, for on you in this place\nDestruction swiftly falls.\" Then all who heard\nThe Br\u00e2hman's words, with loud applause exclaimed,\n\"Indeed, a mighty sage! he even saw\nWithin the pitcher.\" Then, indeed, the king,\nThinking that Har\u00eesarman's skill was due\nTo magic art, gave to him villages\nAnd wealth, and outward marks of royal state.\nThe humble Br\u00e2hman thus became a prince.\nART. X.\u2014The Geographical Distribution of the Modern T\u00fcrki Languages. By M. A. Morrison, Esq., Agent to the British and Foreign Bible Society in South Russia.\n\nCommunicated by R. N. Cust, Esq., Hon. Secretary B.A.S., with a Note, Table of Authorities, and a Language-Map.\n\nThe task to which I address myself in this paper is the geographical distribution of the T\u00fcrki languages. But before doing so it might be well to glance at the whole Ugro-Altaic family, in order to determine the position of the T\u00fcrki Branch in this great division of the languages of the human race.\n\nBroadly speaking, but with sufficient accuracy, the Ugro-Altaic languages are spoken over a region extending through more than 100 degrees of longitude, from the shores of the Adriatic to the Great Wall of China and the plateau of Tibet, and through 35 degrees of latitude, from the frozen steppes of Samoy\u00e9d and Yak\u00fat to the plains of Northern Persia and the head-waters of the Indus.\n\nThese languages, spoken over this vast portion of the earth's surface, are, for philological purposes, divided into five distinct Branches. They are:\n\n1. Finn.\n2. Samoy\u00e9d.\n3. M\u00e1nohu.\n4. Mong\u00f3l.\n5. T\u00fcrki.\n\nWith the details of the various languages which compose the first four Branches I have nothing to do at present. A few broad outlines, however, descriptive of their geographical position, may be found useful.\n\nI. Finn. This group is almost altogether confined to\nEurope. Its four sub-branches are the Ugric, Finn proper, Volga-Finn, and Perm-Finn. With the single exception of the Magyar, one of the languages of the Ugric sub-branch, all these sub-branches are confined to the north of Russia, viz. to Lapland, Finland, Livonia, Esthonia, part of K\u00farland, the northern banks of the Volga and the region between this well-watered district and the territory of the Samoy\u00e9d.\n\nII. Samoy\u00e9d represents the semi-barbarous tribes inhabiting the inhospitable shores of the Arctic Ocean from the Gulf of Kandalak to the river Obi.\n\nIII. M\u00e1nchu is divided into three sub-branches: M\u00e1nchu proper, occupying the country known as Manch\u00faria, north of Kor\u00e9a; T\u00fang\u00fas, spoken in a compact district around Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk; and Lamut, spoken by tribes leading a hard life in the district watered by the Upper Lena.\n\nThe Mongol Branch is spoken by a population altogether nomad. Its home is Mongolia; but immense bodies of Mongols are found in almost all parts of Central Asia and Southern Russia, from the Sea of Azov to Manch\u00faria. The Mongol who inhabit the south-eastern steppes of Russia are known generally as Kalm\u00fck.\n\nI now come to the fifth Branch, of which it is the object of this paper to give some more detailed account.\n\nThis Branch, for philological purposes, may be divided into five sub-branches, as follows:\n\n1. T\u00farki proper.\n2. Nogai.\n3. Uig\u00far.\n4. Kirgh\u00edz.\n5. Yak\u00fat.\n\nEach of the sub-Branches is distinct from the other, and contains its own Languages. A few general remarks on the linguistic aspect of these sub-Branches may be a useful preface to my remarks on their geographical distribution.\n\n1. Phonetics. (A) There is an endless variety in the pronunciation of the vowels and consonants. There is hardly a single letter of the alphabet that has the same value in any\ntwo of the fourteen languages. We have here in this section of T\u00farki linguistics an immense field for research.\n\n(B) The words are very few which are pronounced alike in all the languages. To illustrate what I say take the word 'still' or 'yet.' We have dakhee, daakhee, d'ha, taghee, tagee, taagee, tagen, tagenda, dagee, daagee, dagen, thagee, and da, in all thirteen varieties. There are more than ten forms for 'till' and seven for 'is.' A comparative dictionary of these T\u00farki Languages would be a useful work.\n\n2. Word-Store. Some verbs are common to several Languages, but derivatives of these verbs may not be common to the same Language. The same applies to words built on substantives and adjectives.\n\n3. Structure. I cannot say that in the matter of structure there is any radical difference in the T\u00farki Languages. The same general rules run through them all. Every sentence, for instance, in every one of the Languages must end with its predicate. There are doubtless certain differences in the formation of the dative and accusative terminations in several Languages, in the comparison of the adjective, in nomina actionis, in participles, in pronouns, and in the formation of gerundial forms from the verbs, but there is nothing radical separating any one of the Languages from the rest of its cognates.\n\nGeographical Distribution.\n\nIt will be more convenient if, instead of taking each of the five sub-branches and treating it in its entirety, I were to consider each Language in Geographical order, beginning in the west and moving eastwards, and indicating to which of the sub-branches the Language belongs.\n\ni. Nogai.\n\nThe Nogai proper belongs to the Nogai sub-Branch. The tribes speaking it number about 190,000. The most westerly point that they have reached is the Russian province of Bessarabia, where they occupy about twenty villages. They\nare found all over the Crimea, settled in good villages and following agricultural pursuits with great success. Villages of Nogai are traced thence along the banks of the K\u00faban and K\u00fama, and on the steppes lying to the north of the great Caucasus chain. The Bezian, inhabiting the pasture district north of Mount Elburz, are included in the Nogai. A few nomad Nogai are still found north of the Volga at Astrakhan, their ancient territory, tending their flocks on the great Kirgh\u00edz steppe. Nogai is the name of one of the great Uzbek clans; and without doubt the Nogai are an offshoot of this dominant family. Any western T\u00farki travelling in Central Asia is called a Nogai. This Language has been most erroneously styled the Karass. Karass is an insignificant German colony in the Stavropol government of Cis-Caucasia, in which a Scotch Missionary translated a portion of the Scriptures into Nogai. Hence the appellation Karass.\n\nii. Osm\u00e1nli.\n\nThe Geographical position of this, the most cultivated and best known of the T\u00farki Languages, is so familiar to every one that I need only say it is spoken by the ruling classes in the Ottoman Empire, and the population of Asia Minor. It belongs to the T\u00farki sub-branch.\n\niii. Kum\u00fck, or Kumik, or Kumian.\n\nThis is the Language spoken by the Kum\u00fck tribes inhabiting the north-west shore of the Caspian near Petrovsk, and the north-east districts of Daghestan, watered by the Aksai and Sunja rivers. It is also found spoken on the river Terek, a little higher than Kizliar. The Kum\u00fck number about 70,000, and are now a peaceable race, learning to till the soil, and availing themselves of the schools which the Russian Government has placed among them. Their Language is closely related to that of the Nogai, and is placed in the Nogai sub-Branch.\niv. Kas\u00e1n.\n\nThe Language of Kas\u00e1n is another member of the Nogai sub-Branch. As its name implies, it is chiefly spoken in the province of Kas\u00e1n on the Volga. There are also a number of scattered communities speaking this language in the province of Simbirsk, south of Kas\u00e1n. It is corrupt, not only possessing, like almost all its congeners, a good many Arabic and Persian words and constructions, but also borrowing words from the Finn Languages. The population speaking this Language numbers about 200,000.\n\nv. Chuw\u00e1sh.\n\nBelongs to the T\u00farki sub-Branch. The district now inhabited by the Chuw\u00e1sh was formerly a part of the Kiptchak territory. It stretches along both sides of the Volga, but chiefly on the left bank, and forms part of the modern government of Nijnii Novgorod, Kas\u00e1n, Simbirsk, Viatka, and Orenburg. The Chuw\u00e1sh are most thickly settled in the south-west of the government of Kas\u00e1n; in the other governments they are more scattered. They number about 450,000. Although this Language is wedged in between two distinctly Finn Languages, the Mordv\u00edn and the Ch\u00e9remiss, it is clearly T\u00farki. It is indeed true that it contains many Ugric and Samoy\u00e9d forms, but the Alta\u00efc element is decidedly in the ascendant. This is put beyond dispute by Schott in his 'La Langue des Tschouwaches.'\n\nvi. Azerbij\u00e1ni or Trans-Caucasian.\n\nI now cross the main ridge of the Caucasus, and come in contact with another T\u00farki Language, the Azerbij\u00e1ni or Trans-Caucasian. It is the language of an important settled population in Trans-Caucasia and North-West Persia, numbering over 3,000,000. Here we find the descendants of the old Kizil-Bashi. In large districts of Georgia, in Shirw\u00e1n, and Karadagh, on the Western Caspian coast from Resht to Derbent, in the Sirdarlic of Eriv\u00e1n, in the Persian provinces\nof Azerbij\u00e1n, Ghilan, and Maz\u00e1ndaran, this is the vernacular. It is a peculiar and corrupt form. For philologists it has none of the value of the more archaic languages, e.g. the Uig\u00far. German missionaries, stationed in Shusha, about the year 1830, were the first to reduce to paper its grammatical principles. In this they were assisted by a most able Armenian linguist, Mirza Fer\u00fakh.\n\nvii. Bashk\u00edr.\n\nAgain going north to Astrakhan on the Volga delta, we enter the country of the Bashk\u00edr. If we draw a line from Astrakhan north-east to Orenburg, and thence due north to Ufa and Perm, we bisect the country of the Bashk\u00edr into two not very unequal parts. The Bashk\u00edr are most compact in the neighbourhood of Ufa, which is really a Bashk\u00edr town. They number some 400,000, and are mostly settled. Their language belongs to the Nogai sub-Branch. Ethnologists are divided in opinion about the origin of the race, but the best authorities are agreed that, although the race may be of Mongol origin, the language is T\u00farki.\n\nviii. Trans-Caspian.\n\nThis is a very widely dispersed language. It is spoken by about 2,300,000 people. Going from west to east we see it spoken by the Tekke in the rich pasture plains lying between the northern slopes of the Kopet hills and the desert, and in that long strip of the Arkatch valley north of the Kuren Dagh. But in addition it is also the language of the ruling natives in Samarkand, Tashkent, Bukh\u00e1ra, Charj\u00fai, Kokan, Ferghana, Balkh, and the populous Zarafshan valley. In other words it is the language of the great Uzbek nation. The 92 clans of the Uzbek are scattered over all that part of Central Asia in which the towns just named are situated. It is also the language of the Salor and Sarik tribes of north-west Afghanistan; also of the Kiptchak dwelling north of the Naryn river, and in the district\nround the important town of Andijan. It belongs to the Uig\u00fbr sub-Branch. Although it is somewhat corrupted by the T\u00e2j\u00eek dialect of Persian, it retains the ancient forms of T\u00fbrki more faithfully than either the Bashk\u00eer or Azerbij\u00e2ni. When any one in these districts wishes to speak in a more refined manner, or to write a letter or document, he uses either the dialect of the T\u00e2j\u00eek or else pure Persian. As applied to this language, the name Jagatai is little known in Central Asia. The Uzbek say that they speak \u2018T\u00fbrki.\u2019 The term Jagatai is derived from Jagat, that son of Jengh\u00eez Khan to whom the portion of Turkestan now inhabited by the Tekke was given by his father.\n\nix. Khivan.\n\nThis Language also belongs to the Uig\u00fbr sub-Branch. It is spoken by about 1\u00bd million in the Khanate of Khiva and in the Great Desert between the Amu Daria and the Caspian. In this estimate are included 150,000 nomad Yomut inhabiting the desert, and the Kara-Kalpak, numbering perhaps 200,000, who live round the southern shores of the Sea of Aral. The Turkoman, who form the bulk of the population speaking this language, must have broken off at a very early period from the original home of the race among the Altai. Their language has marked affinities with the most archaic form of the T\u00fbrki language.\n\nx. Kirghts.\n\nPerhaps none of the five sub-Branches is so free from dialectic variations as the Kirgh\u00eez. The language spoken on the steppes of the lower Volga and that spoken in the valleys of the Thien Shan mountains are one and the same, and it is perhaps nearer to the Western T\u00fbrki than the language of the tribes of the Caucasus and Western Caspian shores, and certainly nearer than the language of Yarkand. The Kirgh\u00eez nation consists of two great divisions, the Kara- or Burut-Kirgh\u00eez, who are highlanders confined to\nthe Altai, Pamir, and Thien Shan mountains, and to that part of Eastern Turkestan belonging to the Chinese Empire; and the Kaz\u00e1k-Kirgh\u00edz, dwellers on the plains, who roam with their sheep and camels over half a million of square miles from the Caspian to Lake Tenghiz. The Kaz\u00e1k or western division are far more numerous and powerful than the Kara-Kirgh\u00edz, and are subdivided into the well-known Lesser, Middle, and Greater Horde. The Greater Horde, which borders on the territory of the Kara, inhabits the Alatau district. The Middle Horde is scattered over the whole of south-west Siberia in the territory north and west of Lake Balkhash between the Upper Syr Daria and the Irtish, and is bounded on the west by the Sarisoa. The Lesser Horde is as far west as the Caspian and Ural Mountains, and meets the Middle Horde on the Syr Daria and Yemba. There is yet another Horde confined to Russia called the Inner or Bukeieff Horde. They dwell on the steppe between the Volga and Ural. There is moreover a considerable Kirgh\u00edz population in the government of Orenburg. Ethnologists are not yet able to decide whether they belong to the Mongol or to the T\u00farki race. They number altogether a little over 2,000,000. The Kaz\u00e1k or Western Kirgh\u00edz has been called 'Orenburg Tartar,' for the same reason that the Nogai has been called 'Karass': a Scotch Missionary resident in Orenburg translated portions of the Scriptures into Kaz\u00e1k-Kirgh\u00edz. I may add that the translation gives an excellent idea of the written form of this dialect.\n\nxi. Yak\u00fat.\n\nFor the purposes of the philologist this is perhaps the most important of any of the languages, inasmuch as it has preserved its ancient forms untouched by the influence of foreign idioms. It is the language on which B\u00f6htlingk wrote his celebrated monograph. The tribes speaking Yak\u00fat inhabit the far north-east corner of Siberia, and number about 200,000. It is pretty certain that at some unknown time they have migrated to that secluded region from the\nshores of Lake Baikal. All their traditions agree with this theory. The Russian Orthodox Church has had a mission for some time among the Yak\u00fat, but more than the half of them still retain their heathen usages.\n\nxii. Yarkandi.\n\nThe language of Yarkand in Chinese Tartary and the region south of the Thien Shan mountains. We have here a pure and archaic form of T\u00farki. Vamb\u00e9ry considers that this language has incontestably the most primitive words and formations amongst all T\u00farki forms of speech. It has attained, moreover, alone, with the single exception of Osm\u00e1li, a high degree of literary culture. Early in the fifth century it was reduced to writing by the Chinese, and in the eighth century Christian missionaries from Syria formed an alphabet. The population speaking this Language numbers nearly 1,000,000.\n\nxiii. Taranchi.\n\nAccording to Baron Kaulbars the Taranchi number some 40,000. They are settled in Kulja and in small agricultural communities around. They are probably emigrants from Eastern Turkestan, settled in their present territory by the Chinese Government. Radloff says of the Taranchi that which may be said of any of the Central Asian Turkish idioms, \u201cit is more specially Turkish than any Turkish book printed in Constantinople.\u201d It belongs to the Uig\u00fbr sub-Branch. The name is derived from the Turkish word Taran \u2018millet.\u2019 The Taranchi are skilful agriculturists; hence, perhaps, their appellation.\n\nxiv. Altaic.\n\nAccording to Vamb\u00e9ry, Radloff, Castren, and Pavet de Courteille, the Koibal and Karagas are distinct forms of speech, spoken on the northern slopes of that range, and Radloff mentions many others, calling them dialects.\n### Summary\n\n| Division | Sub-Div. | Population | Geographical Extent |\n|----------|----------|------------|---------------------|\n| 1.

I had hoped to prevail on my friend Arminius Vamb\u00e9ry to write a paper for this Journal on the subject, and no one is more competent to deal with it, but the Council declined to offer any remuneration, and so the negotiation dropped, which I had commenced at Buda Pest in 1883. Pavet de Courteille of Paris, at my request wrote a paper on the subject in the Transactions of the Philological Society, 1877; but, as it appeared to me to be rather a Geographical than a Philological subject, I went down in the autumn of 1883 to Tiflis, to talk over the matter with Mr.\nMichael Morrison, the Agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society, and his learned colleague, the Rev. Amir-khanians, whom I found engaged in the translation of the Scriptures in the T\u00fcrki spoken in Trans-Caucasus and Azerbij\u00e1n, the North-West Province of Persia. This was not so much a task for a profound scholar in his study in Europe, as for a person engaged in Asia in distributing the Scriptures to each horde in the Language intelligible to them. When Mr. Morrison visited London last year, we talked over the whole subject, and fixed approximately the number of languages; but I consider this sketch to be only tentative, and a step in advance towards the final settlement of this important subject.\n\nWe learn from Vamb\u00e9ry that though he calls the Language of the three Khanates of the Oxus the Jagatai, there are distinctly marked Dialects at Kokan, Bokh\u00e1ra, and Khiva, caused in each case by the peculiarities of each State. This paper assigns to Khiva the place of a separate language, including the two other Khanates under the same language with the Tekke. This may or may not be accurate. It is at least intelligible, and therefore easily susceptible of correction. I can however quote no authority.\n\nMichael Terantief published, at St. Petersburg, 1875, Grammars of the Turkish (Osm\u00e1n\u00ed), Persian, Kirgh\u00edz and Uzbek languages, as spoken in Central Asia, followed by a Chrestomathy: by Uzbek he means the two Languages described in this paper as Trans-Caspian and Khivan, and proposes to call it Turkest\u00e1n\u00ed; but this would be going too far, as it would be assuming a name for one portion of the field which belongs to the whole field. He admits that the Dialect spoken in Khiva is differentiated from the Dialect of Bukhara and Tashkend, owing to the contact of the former with the Azerbij\u00e1ni. At the time that he wrote he knew nothing of the language of Yarkand and Kashgar, as Shaw had not published his Grammar, and he knew nothing also of the language of the Tekke of Merw, that country being at that time unvisited and unconquered. Every Russian hates Vamb\u00e9ry the Hungarian, and Terantief, as was to be\nexpected, attacks the \"Jagataische Sprach Studien,\" but Scholars will probably agree with Vambery. Radloff is of opinion that a single version of the Scriptures will be understood by the populations of Turkestan (Tashkent), Bokhara, Khiva and Kokan, amounting to two or three millions. A competent scholar, Ostramof, is engaged in the translation of the Gospels: his work has been submitted to Radloff, who is entirely satisfied with it. It will be carried out at the expense of the English Bible Society, and a large issue published and distributed; and the question as to the Language spoken in these Regions will be settled by the test of experience. Schuyler, who is a trustworthy authority, in his Travels entirely supports the same view as Terantief.\n\nI have had a Language Map prepared, and add a table of Authorities or Texts, as the best proof of the existence of the Language and Family, and the best means of differentiating them.\n\nRegarding their written Character, it may be noted that some of these are perfectly illiterate. The Osmanli, the Azerbijani, Kumuk, Kirghiz, Nogai, Yarkandi, Khivan, and Trans-Caspian use the Arabic Character partially or entirely. Vambery tells us that among the Kirghiz the Mongolian Character is in use, and that the Mulla, who visit these Nomads for the purpose of propagating the Mahometan Faith, do not hesitate to use for that purpose the Character, which on other occasions they call the Kafir Character, and the use of which they try to suppress elsewhere. We find also that there are certain people who speak the Turki, but read only the Armenian Character, and an Edition of the Bible has been published to suit their convenience. The Chuvash tribes have been educated to read their Bible in the Russian Character, and are supplied with an Edition. The Osmanli Turki Language has been made the instrument of Religious Instruction to some of the Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire, who have forgotten their glorious language, but from mere racial and theological hate will only use the Greek Character, and the entire Bible has been supplied to them in the Alpha Beta of Hellas. The Yakut,\nwho are Christian subjects of Russia, apparently use the Russian alphabet, to judge from the texts given by B\u00f6htlingk.\n\nThere is no doubt no finality as yet arrived at. In dealing with Nomads we must expect the Dialects to fluctuate. M. Lessar had in his Survey from Kizil Arb\u00e1t to Askabad two interpreters, one a Kurd from the frontier colony in Persia, who had been a prisoner among the Tekke, and spoke the Trans-Caspian Language, and the other a native of Kas\u00e1n in Russia on the Volga, whose form of speech is stated, though no examples are given, to have resembled that spoken by the Tekke. We must take this statement for what it is worth. Vamb\u00e9ry mentions that, though he tried to make use of the Khivan language instead of the Osm\u00e1nli, the Khan of Khiva was obliged to have much translated to him. This admission from Vamb\u00e9ry, an accomplished Osm\u00e1nli scholar, and who knew something of Khivan, and a good deal of Trans-Caspian, implies a great divergence. Bellew mentions that a T\u00farki Dialect was heard among the Nomads betwixt Herat and Farah, implying an intrusion into the Pashtu Language-field.\n\nIt will be at once remarked that two venerable names are omitted from this detail of languages, and they are intentionally omitted. The object of this paper is Geographical: the name given to each language indicates the region or the tribe to which it pertains. But a place must be assigned to the Uig\u00fbr and Jagatai. Pavet de Courteille agrees with Vamb\u00e9ry in dividing the T\u00farki languages into two great subdivisions. The North comprehends the languages spoken from the rivers Lena to the Jenissei, or rather the Northern slopes of the Sayan Mountains; these languages are the Yak\u00fat, Koibal, Karagas, and many Dialects. The South comprehends all the T\u00farki languages spoken from the frontier of China to the Danube. This is a far better classification than the vague expedient of dividing the Family with reference to the population being nomad or sedentary. The Uig\u00fbr is the most ancient form in which the T\u00farki speech appears as a cultivated language, while the languages of the Northern subdivision, which may be called the Altaic, and\nwhich are totally illiterate, present the most primitive form of words and forms. There exists a manuscript, known as the Kudatku Bilik, the date of which is fixed at the latter half of the eleventh century of the Christian era: this is stated by some to be the oldest record, and is in Uig\u00fbr. Vamb\u00e9ry makes it the basis of his investigations. Though late in date compared with the literary monuments of the Aryan and Semitic Families, it is of great importance, as it is the most pure specimen of real T\u00fbrki, free from the influences of the Persian and Arabic languages, and worthy to be considered the typical language.\n\nWe have now to inquire what Jagatai is. One of the most remarkable writers on the subject of the Turki tribes is Abul Gh\u00e2zi of Khiva, who wrote a book called \"The Genealogical History of the Tatars.\" He lived at Khiva in the seventeenth century of our era, and he remarks that he wrote his book in T\u00fbrki, in order that all might understand him, and that he employed words which a child of the age of five years would comprehend, and that he rejected all loan-words from Jagatai, Persian, and Arabic. This shows that the language, which he used, was not called Jagatai, in his time, but that he used what he deemed pure Turki. Pavet de Courteille comes to the following conclusion: that the Jagatai was the language, in which the Kudatk\u00fb-Bilik was written, and was, in fact, the language in its most ancient form, and in the region nearest to its birthplace. Abul Gh\u00e2zi would not allow himself to use antique words, which were intelligible in the eleventh century, but which had fallen into desuetude in the seventeenth, and were only known to the learned. The literature of every country supplies an analogy of this process. The words Jagatai and Uig\u00fbr only indicate differences of age, and stages of dialectic variation, through which the T\u00fbrki language passed. Shaw confirms this view, and writes that though some European linguists have called the T\u00fbrki of Kashgar and Yarkand Uig\u00fbr, the name is totally unknown to the people, and would be a misnomer for a modern language. Terantief confirms this view. The term should be abandoned. Vamb\u00e9ry,\nin his Jagataische Sprache, goes so far as to state that it is probable that the word \"Jagatai Turki\" means nothing more than \"pure Turki,\" just as the word Jagatai coupled with the word \"man\" means a \"brave, trustworthy man.\"\n\nI have tried to catch up all the names which are scattered through the books of reference, which are sometimes tribal, sometimes local, sometimes synonyms, sometimes artificial. They will find their place under one or other of the Geographical terms now supplied. Karachai and Kabarda in the Caucasus region, Kapchak on the Lower Volga, and Uzbeg in Transoxania, are tribal names. Chantu is identical with T\u00farki. Tatar, converted by the wit of a Pope into Tartar, is identical with T\u00farki (J.R.A.S. n.s. Vol. XIV. p. 125). Alatyan is identical with Altaic.\n\nVocabularies in Meshtsheriak, Tobolsk, Chasowo, Chjulim, Jenisee, Kusnek, Baraba, Kangayen, Teleut, Chiwa, are supplied by Klaproth in the T\u00farki chapter of his Language Atlas of Asia Polyglotta, published at Paris, 1822. If they have any surviving value, it must be appraised after identification of their locality, and testing their accuracy. In these days learned compilations in an imposing form are of no value, unless the Geographer can mark the spot with precision on the Language-Map, and the compiler can give other authority and security for the genuineness of the Vocabulary than the notes in his own Diary. We have got beyond the uncritical stage, and like to know the latitude and longitude, and the capacity of the compiler, as well as his method of transliteration.\n\nIt is worthy of remark that the whole of the T\u00farki-speaking population of the world is slowly, but surely, gravitating towards Russian domination. A few corners still lie outside the absorbing influence, but they seem tottering on the brink of the chasm. The Taranchi of Kulja, and the Yarkandi of Kashgaria are still in the Chinese dominions; and the T\u00farki, who inhabit the regions behind the Oxus and the Hindu Kush, are still in Afghanistan: the Province of Azerbij\u00e1n still forms part of the Persian kingdom, and Asia Minor is in the Ottoman Empire: but this state of affairs\nis only for a time. Every fragment of the Indic branch of the Aryan Family of Languages, with the exception of the rude form of speech of the Siah Posh of Kafiristan and the Dards, has been absorbed into the Indian Empire; the same fate of being gathered under one sceptre awaits the whole of the widely-scattered T\u00farki tribes, and it is a notable fact for the future, since unity of language is put forward as the basis of political union.\n\nHow far the Russians possess the necessary sympathy for such a task, and the capacity for educating such a population, nomad, as well as sedentary, is a question. The Russian language, with its ponderous word-store, and illogical Aryan structure, has but slight attraction to the agglutinative and severely logical T\u00farki, which stands at the head of all languages in its wonderful symmetry and power of form, evolution or accommodation. Perhaps the B\u00e1ntu family of South Africa alone can rival it. Of the kind of words, which will come into existence from the contact of such uncongenial elements as Russ and T\u00farki we have a specimen in the name of a son of a Kirgh\u00edz chief in the Russian service, Vali Khan, who has assumed the name of Valikhanooff. In India we should hardly call the son of Gulab Singh, Gulabsinghson, but such words may hereafter be formed.\n\nHow the subtle poison of the Arabized Persian language has found its way into the veins of the linguistic body of the Osm\u00e1nli T\u00farki is well known, but it is surprising to find in the distant and secluded language of Yarkandi in Chinese Tartary the same infiltration of foreign elements, though to a less degree. The celebrated Uig\u00fbr Manuscript is quite free from this contagion. The presence of a T\u00e1jik servile population would supply the Persian element, and the conquering Religion of Mahomet would force into use Arabic words and forms. But we have the authority of Vamb\u00e9ry for asserting that it was quite unnecessary for the Osm\u00e1nli language to make such prodigious loans from Arabic and Persian, as it had in its own T\u00farki root-store and expanding mechanism, a capability of expressing every human idea, and could at pleasure replace every foreign word by drawing\nupon its own stores; and, in fact, the East-Turki languages have done so to a very great extent. We find the same linguistic phenomena in the marvellously beautiful and versatile lingua franca of India, the Urd\u00fa, or Hindust\u00e1ni, in spite of the wealth of word-store and grammatical forms of the great Sanskritic Vernaculars, and the high degree of culture, to which the pure Indian literature had reached long before the Mahometan Conquest, which rendered loan-words quite unnecessary. The very word \"Urd\u00fa\" marks the T\u00farki conquest of India by the Mughals. The Baber-namah of the great founder of that dynasty is in Jagatai. A certain proportion of words, though not many, have survived in the great Indian vernacular. The word Turk survives in the Hindust\u00e1ni Dictionary in connection with horses and horsemen. I close with the proverb:\n\nArabic is the root: Persian is the sugar:\nHindi is the salt: Turki is the art.\n\nThe desideratum is a Scientific Comparative Grammar of the whole family, worthy to be placed on the same shelf with the Comparative Grammars of other families of speech which we already possess, and it is stated on good authority that Radloff is preparing such a work.\nA.

XI.\u2014A Modern Contributor to Persian Literature.\n\nRiz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n and his Works. By Sidney Churchill, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nBut a few Persians have devoted so much time, energy, and real enthusiasm to their own literature during the present century as the subject of this notice: the Am\u00edru-sh-Shu\u2019ar\u00e1 Riz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n B Muhammad H\u00e1d\u00ed Khan B Ism\u2019a\u00edl Kam\u00e1l, poetically surnamed \u201cHid\u00e1iyat,\u201d and popularly known as the \u201cLalah B\u00e1sh\u00ed.\u201d Descended in a direct line from the well-known poet, Kam\u00e1l Khojand\u00ed\u2014a cotemporary of H\u00e1f\u00edz, who died at Tabr\u00edz in A.H. 792 (A.D. 1389)\u2014the Am\u00edru-sh-Shu\u2019ar\u00e1 was born in Tehr\u00e1n on the 15th Muharram, A.H. 1215 (8th June, 1800). His family, in honour of their ancestor, appended the surname Kam\u00e1l to their individual appellations. Hid\u00e1iyat\u2019s grandfather, Ism\u2019a\u00edl Kam\u00e1l, suffered death at the hands of Zak\u00ed Kh\u00e1n Zand for refusing to take up the cause of the Zand dynasty in preference to that of the Pretender Agh\u00e1 Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Kaj\u00e1r.\n\nRiz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n lost both father and mother at an early age, being left an orphan at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, where he entered the service of the Farm\u00e1n Farm\u00e1\u00ed Husain \u2019Ali M\u00edrz\u00e1. His takhallus was first \u201cCh\u00e1kar\u201d; but after some of his odes had reached Mazandar\u00e1n, his native home, he changed it to \u201cHid\u00e1iyat.\u201d\n\nFath \u2019Ali Sh\u00e1h Kaj\u00e1r, when in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, appointed him Am\u00edru-sh-Shu\u2019ar\u00e1, or \u201cChief of the Poets,\u201d but notwithstanding this and other evidences of the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s goodwill, he sojourned in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z until A.H. 1254 (A.D. 1838), when he travelled towards Tehr\u00e1n, and being presented to Muham-\nmad Sh\u00e1h, who had succeeded his grandfather, was appointed by him as Lalah B\u00e1sh\u00ed, or guardian to his favourite son, \u2019Abb\u00e1s M\u00edrz\u00e1 N\u00e1\u2019ib us-Sultanah, who is now known by the title of Mulk \u00c1r\u00e1, \u201cornament or adorner of the kingdom.\u201d\n\nIn A.H. 1264 (A.D. 1848), Muhammad Sh\u00e1h died and was succeeded by the Val\u00ed\u2019ahd N\u00e1siru-d-D\u00edn M\u00edrz\u00e1. Owing to the intrigues against H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 Agh\u00e1s\u00ed during the last few months of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h\u2019s life, some of the princes were banished to Karbal\u00e1. Amongst these were \u2019Abb\u00e1s M\u00edrz\u00e1 and his mother, who had been the late Sh\u00e1h\u2019s favourite wife. For these reasons Riz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n was obliged to keep quiet for a time. Through the patronage of the Am\u00edr N\u00edz\u00e1m\u2014M\u00edrz\u00e1 Tak\u00ed Kh\u00e1n\u2014however, he was, in A.H. 1267 (A.D. 1851), sent on a mission to Khiva. On his return from Central Asia, he was appointed Deputy Director of the Royal Academy, which had lately been formed at Tehr\u00e1n, a post he held for some years. When the Val\u00ed\u2019ahd, Muzaffaru-d-D\u00edn M\u00edrz\u00e1, was appointed to the government of Azarbajj\u00e1n, Riz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n received the royal orders to follow him in the same capacity as that he had held with \u2019Abb\u00e1s M\u00edrz\u00e1. A few years later, whilst in Tehr\u00e1n, to seek a little rest, he died, from an illness from which he had been suffering, in A.H. 1288 (A.D. 1871).\n\nThe Lalah B\u00e1sh\u00ed was a very good scholar, and one of the most learned men of his day. His learning being recognized, he had many opportunities of taking advantage of his friends\u2019 libraries. His value as a poet is highly estimated by his countrymen; though his *diw\u00e1n* has not yet been published.\n\nThe following is a list of his works:\n\n(1) An edition of the *Rauzatu-s-Saf\u00e1*, a general history of Persia and the adjacent countries, from the creation to A.H. 873, in six volumes, composed by Muhammad B. Kh\u00e1vand Sh\u00e1h B. Mahm\u00fad, better known as M\u00edr Khw\u00e1nd.\n\n---\n\n1 M. Schefer, in his introduction to the \u201cRelation de l\u2019Ambassade au Kharizm,\u201d says that this collection consists of more than 50,000 *b\u00e1it* or distichs, besides miscellaneous writings, of which mention is made in Mr. Churchill\u2019s list, numbers 8, 12, 6, 14 and 13.\u2014Ed.\nTo this work is added the rarer seventh volume, in the introductory lines prefixed to which the name of Gh\u00ed\u00e1su-d-D\u00edn Khw\u00e1nd M\u00edr occurs as its author\u2014its subject being a history of Ab\u00fa-l-Gh\u00e1zi Sult\u00e1n Hussain M\u00edrz\u00e1 and his sons, to A.H. 929. In continuation of these, Riz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, by Royal command, compiled, in the course of two years, three volumes, which consist\u2014in his own words\u2014of the history of three hundred and seventy years, from the origin of the Safav\u00eds to A.H. 1274 (A.D. 1858); thus including the first decade of N\u00e1s\u00edru-d-D\u00edn Sh\u00e1h\u2019s reign. These three important supplements, comprising about seventy thousand lines, were lithographed together with the preceding seven volumes, the whole ten being formed into two big folios, at Tehr\u00e1n, A.H. 1271\u201374 (A.D. 1853\u201356), and a thousand copies struck off.\n\n(2) The \u201cNaj\u00e1d N\u00e1mah P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h\u00e1n Ir\u00e1n\u00ed Naj\u00e1d.\u201d This work is rare, and still in MS.

This work is divided into four Rukus as follows: Ruku I. Kings and Princes who have written poetry; II. Poets from A.H. 173 to A.H. 800; III. Poets of the Middle period; IV. Contemporary poets. After praises of the Am\u00edru'l-M\u00famin\u00edn \u2019Al\u00ed B Ab\u00ed T\u00e1l\u00edb, the author discourses on the origin of poetry, and concludes with a list of his authorities, scarcely any of whom, however, does he supersede. Indeed, one would have expected more accuracy from so painstaking a scholar. As some of the works he mentions are extremely rare, it is worth while enumerating them, as by this means it will be seen that such works are still to be met with by diligent search for them. The Tazkarah Lubu'l-Lubab of Muhammad \u2019A\u00fafi (otherwise the very rare Lub\u00e1bu'l-Alb\u00e1b, described by N. Bland in this Journal, Vol. IX. p. 112; and Fr.

This production, although foreshadowed in the preface to the same author's \"T\u0101rikh Guzidah,\" has hitherto remained unknown in substance to European scholars; and it is to Mr. Sidney Churchill of Tehran (who now describes the literary labours of Ri\u1e93\u0101 \u1e32uli) that the credit of securing it for the British Museum belongs. Under the somewhat hackneyed title of \"Zafr N\u0101mah,\" it is explained to be a \"rhymed chronicle of the Muslim world\" in 75,000 verses, and \"so rare that its existence might have been doubted.\" Its bulk is partly accounted for by the fact that it contains the whole of Firdausi's \"Shah-n\u0101mah\" written in the margins\u2014a circumstance which enhances its value by supplying Orientalists with a new and carefully-collated text of that celebrated Epic. Referring to it, however, as a closely-written quarto, richly ornamented with frontispiece and gilt headings, and dated Shiraz 807, or 1405 of our era,\" the writer in the Athen\u00e6um thus apportions the numerous verses:\n\n\"The first 25,000 are devoted to the Arabs, i.e. to Muhammad and his successors down to the fall of the Khalifat of Baghdad; the next 20,000 to the Persians, or to the dynasties of Ir\u00e1n from the Saff\u00e1ris to the Karakhitais of Karm\u00e1n; and the last 30,000 to the Mughals. This last section, the largest and most valuable, beginning with the House of Jenghiz Kh\u00e1n, treats very fully of the foundation of the Mughal Empire, of Hulaku, and of his successors in Persia down to Abu Sa'id Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the last of the dynasty under whom the author lived. The history is brought down to the time of composition, Ann. Hij. 735, or Ann. Dom. 1334, just one year before Abu Sa'id's death.\"\n\nIn a future Number of the Journal it is proposed to give further information on this most valuable discovery. Meanwhile it may be noted that Mr. Rieu's printed Catalogues\nshow two other of Hamd-Ullah's works among the Persian Manuscripts of the British Museum: one, the above-mentioned \"Tarikh Guzidah,\" a general history from the earliest times to the period of writing\u2014a sort of prose scaffolding to the versified history then in progress, and now displayed to the ken of Western scholars: the other, the \"Nuzhatu-l-Kulub,\" described as \"a cosmographical work, treating more especially of the geography of Persia and some adjacent counties.\" The last-named book, though mainly a compilation, has attained considerable repute: there are no less than nine copies noted in the Museum Catalogues.\nART. XII.\u2014Some Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri Folk-Songs. Edited and translated by G. A. Grierson, M.R.A.S., Bengal Civil Service.\n\nEncouraged by the reception of my former paper on Bih\u0101r\u012b Folk-Songs,\u00b9 I now lay before the Society a further set of similar ones, in the same dialect of the Bih\u0101r\u012b language,\u2014the Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri.\n\nSince the last paper was printed, the acquirement of this dialect of Bih\u0101r\u012b has been facilitated by the publication of a Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri grammar,\u00b2 and it is hoped that when the set of dialect grammars of which that forms a part is all printed, and when the Comparative Dictionary of the Bih\u0101r\u012b Language,\u00b3 now being published, is completed, the requirements of the student will in some measure be fulfilled.\n\nThe great want of Bih\u0101r\u012b is a printed literature. At present, owing to the Government preference for the exotic Hindi, all works of any importance published in Bih\u0101r are written in that language, though a few popular books are sometimes issued in Bih\u0101r\u012b.\u2074 These latter are, however, few in number, and, though much admired, they hardly pay; for, practically, the only books that pay in Bih\u0101r are those patronized by the Government Education Department, which steadily refuses to have anything to do with works written in the national language. This is a great pity, for Hindi is only understood by the educated classes, and, even amongst them, is a\n\n\u00b9 Some Bih\u0101r\u012b Folk-Songs, J.R.A.S.-Vol. XVI. p. 196.\n\u00b2 Seven Grammars of the Dialects and Sub-Dialects of the Bih\u0101r\u012b Language, by G.

Five parts in all have been published up to date, and two others are in the press.\n\u00b3 London, Tr\u00fcbner.\n\u2074 e.g., the Sudh\u0101bund, by Kum\u0101ra L\u0101l\u0101 Khadga Bah\u0101dur Mall, published by Sahib Prasad Singh in B\u0101k\u012bpur (Bankipore).\nforeign tongue which they have to learn in addition to their native language.\n\nBefore the English rulers undertook to foster the vernaculars, practically the only two of them in North-Eastern India which had acquired any considerable literary cultivation were the Bais'w\u0101r\u012b of Audh and the Bang\u0101l\u012b. The latter does not concern us now, and it will suffice here to refer to the line of famous poets in that language, commencing with Cha\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b D\u0101sa, who lived in the fifteenth century A.D.\n\nBais'w\u0101r\u012b, the border dialect between Braj Bh\u0101sh\u0101 (the parent of modern Hindi) on the west, and Bih\u0101r\u012b on the east, and partaking of the peculiarities of both these languages, was admirably adapted to serve the purposes of a poet, who could be read, understood, and loved over the whole of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, and such a poet arose in the famous Tul's\u012b D\u0101s, who wrote almost entirely in that dialect.\u00b9 He was followed by a host of imitators, down to the present day, and hence it follows that Bais'w\u0101r\u012b has a literature which, if collected together, would fill a good-sized library.\n\nAt the same time, Braj Bh\u0101sh\u0101, the language to the west of Bais'w\u0101r\u012b, and not falling within North-East Hind\u016bst\u0101n, developed a literature of its own, founded, while the language was almost yet a Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, by Chand Bard\u0101i, who was followed, longo intervallo, by S\u016br D\u0101s and his imitators.\n\nHindi, i.e. the book Hindi of the present day, did not exist till the English conquest. Early in the present century it was manufactured by order of Government, out of \u016ard\u016b, by the substitution of Sanskrit for Arabic and Persian words.\n\n\u00b9 The only poem of Tul's\u012b D\u0101s, with which I am acquainted, and which is not written in Bais'w\u0101r\u012b, is the Kri\u015bna-b\u0101l\u012b, which he wrote, as the subject and fashion required, in Braj Bh\u0101sh\u0101. S\u016br D\u0101s, who wrote only about Kri\u015bna, wrote in Braj Bh\u0101sh\u0101, and Tul's\u012b D\u0101s, the bard of R\u0101m, in Bais'w\u0101r\u012b, and it seems to have been a recognized rule, even as far back as the time of the latter poet, that poems concerning the former hero must therefore be written in Braj, and those concerning the latter hero in Bais'w\u0101r\u012b. So prevalent and fixed has this idea become, that Bidy\u0101pati, the Maithili poet, who wrote only about Kri\u015bna, in the Maithili dialect, is declared by Bang\u0101l\u012b historians to have written in Braj, a language as different from Maithili as German is from English!! The argument seems to have been something like this. Any poems about Kri\u015bna must be in Braj; Bidy\u0101pati\u2019s poems are about Kri\u015bna; therefore (although they admittedly do not possess a single Braj inflection) they are in Braj.\nA number of books were concocted in this language, and it has ever since remained the officially-recognized literary language of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. Nowhere is it a vernacular, and it is radically different from the language of Bih\u0101r. At the same time, it is closely connected, through its parent \u016ard\u016b, with Braj Bh\u0101sh\u0101, and hence is well suited to be the literary language, as it has really become, of North-Western India.\n\nBih\u0101r\u012b, the language to the east of Bais\u2019w\u0101r\u012b,\u00b9 was not so fortunate as Braj Bh\u0101sh\u0101. It is true it had one great poet, Bidy\u0101pat\u012b, who flourished at the end of the fourteenth century, but he wrote in Maithil\u012b, the extreme eastern dialect of Bih\u0101r\u012b, and had not many followers in his own country. Curiously enough, his principal imitators were Bang\u0101lis who, under the influence of Ch\u0101it\u0101nya, a great admirer of the old master-singer, wrote a number of works in the spurious Maithil\u012b found in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-pada-kalpa-taru, a Bang\u0101li compilation of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava litanies.\u00b2\n\nHence Bih\u0101r\u012b literature, though old, is small in extent, for neither of the other dialects (Magahi and Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri) developed a great poet strong enough to found a school of literature. If a people, however, has not poems by great masters, it must have songs, and so we find abundant stores of songs of all kinds, some original, and some translated from other languages, in these last two dialects. The peculiarity of all these songs is that the fetters of metre lie upon them very loosely indeed. Bidy\u0101pat\u012b and Tul\u2019s\u012b D\u0101s wrote according to the strictest rules of Pingala, measuring the quantity of every syllable, but in these other songs the melody to which they are sung is the only guide, and so long as the accent or musical ictus is provided for, the author cared little whether his syllables were long or short. Their measure was founded on some well-known metre, as was necessary, for all North Indian melodies are written to suit such; but in reading the songs given here, it will often be necessary to\n\n\u00b9 Bais\u2019w\u0101r\u012b may be considered as a dialect of Bih\u0101r\u012b, but it is really, as already stated, rather a border dialect, though nearer related to Bih\u0101r\u012b than to Braj.\n\u00b2 The edition of this work which is usually quoted is published by B\u0113n\u012b M\u0101dh\u0101b D\u0113 & Co., A.D. 1866.\nread long syllables as short, and sometimes even the contrary, in order to read them as the poet would have them read.\n\nMany of these songs are of considerable length. For instance, the cycle of ballads concerning the heroes \u0100lh\u0101 and R\u016bdal extends over many thousand lines, and again the Song of Bij\u0101\u012b Mall, or of N\u0101ik\u0101 Banijar\u2019w\u0101, though shorter, still takes some hours to sing through. These longer songs, however, are the property of professional singers. It is a business to sing one, and a treat, equivalent in Europe to going to the opera, to hear one. The professional singer or n\u0101t sits in the dusk of an Indian cold weather, by the straw fire, and is well plied with spirits as he sings his song to the circle of hearers sitting silently round him smoking their hubble-bubbles.\n\nIf these longer songs can be compared to the opera, the shorter ones can be equally well likened to the drawing-room piece. Every stout young fellow with good lungs has a repertoire of them, out of which he sings whenever he has nothing better to do, whether alone or in company. He has probably only one tune, to which he fits all his words; and as the tune wanders about through all keys, and generally has a cadenza of twenty or thirty notes every second or third syllable, it is difficult for the European, uneducated to native tastes, to catch what he sings. This paucity of melodies has often struck me. In the country districts\u00b9 I never heard of a new tune being invented. There seems to be a certain stock of tunes ready made, to which the words of every new song must be fitted. Thus, every mill-song must be sung to the melody called \u2018j\u0101t\u2019s\u0101r,\u2019 and such songs are classed as j\u0101t\u2019s\u0101rs. So certain songs sung in the month of Ch\u0101it are classed as gh\u0101\u1e6d\u014ds, because they are sung to the tune called gh\u0101\u1e6d\u014d, and the class of songs sung in the rainy season is called k\u0101j\u2019ri, which is the name of the air to which they are sung. Some castes have melodies peculiar to them. For instance, only cowherds (ah\u012brs or go\u0101rs) sing the songs\n\n\u00b9 I do not know what is being done in Calcutta, where B\u0101b\u016b Sur\u0113ndra M\u014dhan Tagore has started a revival of Hindu music.\nclassed as ch\u0101charas and bir\u2019h\u0101s, which are sung to the tunes called ch\u0101char and bir\u2019h\u0101 respectively.\n\nOf this last class I have collected forty-two in the Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri dialect alone, all sung to the same melody. They form a portion of the present collection. I cannot say that they possess much literary excellence; on the contrary, some of them are the merest doggerel; but they are valuable as being one of the few trustworthy exponents which we have of the inner thoughts and desires of the people. The Bir\u2019h\u0101 is essentially a wild flower. To use the language of one of them, \u201cit is not cultivated in the field, nor is it borne upon the branches of the fruit-tree. It dwells in the heart, and when a man\u2019s heart overflows, he sings it.\u201d Contrary to what might have been expected, it deals much oftener with the warrior god R\u0101ma, than with the cowherd god K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Six of the following relate to the former, and only one to the latter. This is the consequence of the singers\u2019 surroundings. Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, the district in which they dwell, might almost be called a second R\u0101j\u2019put\u0101n\u0101 in its heroic legends and songs. It is the land made holy by the blood of Bhag\u2019bat\u012b the R\u0101j\u2019p\u016btin, who drowned herself to save her brother from the hands of the Musalm\u0101ns, and it is the birth-land of \u0100lh\u0101 and R\u016bdal, the heroes of Mah\u014db\u0101. In later times, too, tough-hearted old K\u016bar Singh led the Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d R\u0101j\u2019p\u016bts against the English in the mutiny. It is a country of fighting-men, and as such R\u0101ma of Ay\u014ddhy\u0101 and not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of Mathur\u0101 is the god of the land. The Bir\u2019h\u0101s also deal with other deities, e.g. with the special incarnation of Durg\u0101, which is the tutelary deity of the singer\u2019s village. At one time he invokes her presence, offering her the best thing that a cowherd can offer her\u2014a river of milk; at another he complains of the rapacity of his goddess, who demands milk when his cows are far away; shall he, he asks sarcastically, milk the Banyan tree, or would she prefer him to milk the wild fig? Again, the singer dwells on the iniquities of the kali- or iron-age. He complains how men of the very lowest castes are allowed to become pious (quite a subversion of orthodox Hind\u016b con-\nservatism), and how even spirit-sellers may be seen counting their beads on a rosary. Many are the Bir'h\u0101s which describe the charms which adorn and the temptations which beset the pretty young village maidens whose forms are developing from childhood into womanhood. As in India girls are married in their infancy, these girls are all wives, though their husbands have not yet taken them home. Hence we find girls complaining of the non-arrival of their husband, and a number of not very delicate jokes which the village elders (men and women) launch at a girl when she first becomes apta viro. Sometimes, too, we find the girl, half-pleased, half-angry, relating the attentions paid to her by some village swain who met her as she walked through the forest. Again, we have songs referring to a woman's married life. She is now living in her husband's house, and she hyperbolically describes the slimness of her form, as reminding him of the string by which he lowers his drinking vessel into the well. Or, perhaps, as often happens, the husband is away on service and sends his earnings home, which are not always put to legitimate uses.\n\nEven when away from home on service, the cowherd longs for his congenial occupations, and looks back to the happy days when he wandered free over the rich pastures on the Kaim\u016br Hills.\\(^1\\) Or he looks contemptuously at the elaborate preparations of wrestlers and gymnasts, and tells how the young Ahir would only need to tuck up his waist cloth, and could do just as much. There are many other kinds of Bir'h\u0101s in the present collection than those now described, but the above will serve to show their infinite variety, and how each one is a miniature picture of some phase of village life.\n\nRegarding external form, a Bir'h\u0101 consists of two pairs of two lines each, each pair being founded on the following scheme\n\n\\[\n6+4+4+2, \\quad 4+4+3 \\text{ instants,}\n\\]\n\nor else\n\n\\[\n6+4+4+2, \\quad 4+4+4 \\text{ instants.}\n\\]\n\n\\(^1\\) The principal pasture land of Sh\u0101hab\u0101d. They are to the south of the district, and are a branch of the Vindhya range.\nIn reading them, however, they will rarely be found to agree with this, unless we remember, as already noted, that many long syllables (i.e. two instants) must be read as short (i.e. one instant). Sometimes, too, there are superfluous words which do not form part of the metre.\\(^1\\) In regular poetry such superfluous words are technically known as *j\u00f6r*.\\(^2\\)\n\nAs regards the dialect of the following songs, it is tolerably pure Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri, such as is exhibited in the Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri grammar already referred to. There are, however, a few old survivals, or vulgarisms (whichever one may choose to call them), which may here be noted.\n\nThe first and most important is the constant use of the genitives of pronouns in their original construction as possessive adjectives. The originals of these genitives were certainly possessive adjectives in Apabhr\u0101m\u00e7a Pr\u0101krit, e.g. *toh\u0101r* \u2018of you,\u2019 which is the same as the Ap. Pr. *tuh\u0101r*, is translated by H\u0113machandra as *tradiy\u0101h*, and not as *tava*.\\(^3\\) That is to say, they were possessive adjectives, and liable to inflection for gender, and were not substantival genitives. These words, in modern Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri, as spoken by the educated classes, have now become substantival genitives, and are not liable to inflection for gender.\\(^4\\) Amongst the lower orders however, the old adjectival construction has survived, and hence we find many feminine genitive forms.\\(^5\\)\n\nAnother survival is the old Pr\u0101krit Present Indicative. This tense has indeed survived over almost all Hind\u016bst\u0101n, but has in the modern tongues generally become (as in Bih\u0101r\u012b) the Present Subjunctive. This was specially the case in Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri, which possesses another special Present Indicative formed with the suffix *la*.\\(^6\\) In these songs, however, this old tense is frequently used in its original\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *e.g.* \u0924\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 in line 2, and \u0924\u0941\u0939\u093e\u0930 in line 3 of No. 4.\n\n\\(^2\\) For an example, see J.A.S.B. Part i. No. 1, 1885, p. 36.\n\n\\(^3\\) See H\u0113m. iv. 434.\n\n\\(^4\\) They still, however, retain an adjectival oblique form. See Bh. Gr. \u00a7 34.\n\n\\(^5\\) The instances are *m\u014dri*, 9, 4; 21, 4; 43, 18, 19. *hamari*, 44, 5; 45, 10. *hamariy\u0101* (lg. f.), 9, 1. *\u014dpani*, 4, 3. *j\u0113kari*, 6, 3.\n\n\\(^6\\) See Bh. Grammar, \u00a761a. *d\u0113kh\u0113l\u014d* \u2018I see,\u2019 *d\u0113khil\u0101* \u2018we see,\u2019 *d\u0113khel\u0113* \u2018thou seest,\u2019 *d\u0113kh\u0113l\u0113* \u2018you see,\u2019 *d\u0113kh\u0113la* \u2018he sees,\u2019 *d\u0113khelan* \u2018they see.\u2019\nsense of a Present Indicative, and every occurrence of this use will be found noted in the Index.\n\nAs in other Bih\u0101r\u012b dialects, the rules of number and gender are very laxly observed. The singular is frequently used for the plural and vice versa. As a rule the singular is used in a non-honorific or disrespectful sense, and the plural in an honorific or respectful sense. It should also be noted that the masculine is continually used for the feminine.\n\nThe rules for the shortening of the antepenultimate vowel are given at length in \u00a736 of the General Introduction to the seven grammars of the Bih\u0101r dialects, and in the introduction to the comparative dictionary of the Bih\u0101r\u012b language, and need not be repeated here. It may nevertheless be noted, that while in Bhoj\u2019p\u016br\u012b a long \u0906 \u0101 is usually shortened to \u0905 a, in these songs it is sometimes shortened to an older form \u0906 \u0101.1 Examples are \u0906\u092e\u093e\u0935\u093e \u0101m\u0101v\u0101, from \u0101m (18, 1), instead of \u0906\u092e\u093e\u0935\u093e \u0101m\u0101v\u0101,2 and \u0906\u0916\u093f\u0930\u094b \u0101khir\u014d instead of \u0906\u0916\u093f\u0930 \u0101khir (12, 4).\n\nSome masculine nouns, it may also be noted, are given feminine long forms in a diminutive sense. The instances of occurrence are given in the index. An example is \u0926\u0947\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e dehiy\u0101 instead of \u0926\u0947\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e dehiy\u0101 (22, 2; 26, 1).\n\nIn conclusion, I desire to record my obligations again to Babu Siv Nandan L\u0101l R\u0101y, Deputy Magistrate of Pat\u2019n\u0101, to whom I am indebted for much help in the collecting and translating of these songs.\n\n---\n\nI. \u0938\u0941\u092e\u093f\u0930\u0940 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0935\u094b\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u092e, \u0938\u0941\u092e\u093f\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0948\u092f\u093e \u0916\u093c\u0941\u0938\u092e\u0928\n   \u0938\u0941\u092e\u093f\u0930\u0940 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0935\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0915\u0932 \u092c\u0939\u093e\u0928\n   \u0938\u0941\u092e\u093f\u0930\u0940 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0935\u094b\u0902 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u090f \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947\n   \u091c\u093f\u0928 \u0916\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u0948\u092c\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947\u092e\u093e\u0928.\n\n1 Regarding the two pairs of vowels \u0906 \u0101 and \u0905 a, and \u0906 \u0101 and \u0905 a, see Introduction (Chap.

I would draw attention to it, as contradicting a theory put forward with some confidence in the Calcutta Review by B\u0101b\u016b Shy\u0101ma Charana G\u0101nguli, to the effect that the songs of this poet are not known in the Bhoj'p\u016br\u012b area. This song was written for me by a lady whose home is in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, in the heart of Bhoj'p\u016br. I am indebted to the kindness of her husband (a gentleman of position in Government service) for the copy. It describes how a cowherdess of Brind\u0101ban (Vrind\u0101vana) addresses \u016adh\u014d (Uddhava), who has come to her with a message from Krish'n (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), who had left her and gone to Mathur\u0101 at the invitation of Kans (Kam\u010da). The metre is very irregular, probably owing to the fact that the song was originally written in Maithili, and transformed in the course of centuries into Bhoj'p\u016br\u012b, without regard to the quantities of the resultant syllables. The metre seems to have originally been $6+4+2$ instants, four times repeated; but in order to get this metre now a great many long syllables must be read as short ones. In one case, in order to scan, a whole word (\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e in verse 9) must be left out, and this can be done without spoiling the sense, as the word is a mere expletive. Some words bear their Maithili origin on their face, e.g. \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0903 in verse 20, and \u0905\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0903 in verse 21. So also \u0938\u0941\u0917\u0943 in verse 20, which is Bhoj'p\u016br\u012b 2 imper. fem., must, as the metre shows, originally have been \u0938\u0941\u0917\u0943, which is the regular Maithili imperat. for both genders.\n\u092c\u0938\u0939\u0930 \u092c\u0930\u0935\u093e \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0927\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0928-\u0932\u093f\u0932\u093f \u092c\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u0965 \u0967 \u0965\n\u092a\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0941\u0924\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0948\u0902\u091a\u0930\u093e \u091c\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0965 \u0968 \u0965\n\u091c\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u092e \u092c\u0928\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092a\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u093f\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u091a\u094b\u091f\u0940 \u0965 \u0969 \u0965\n\u0930\u0947\u0936\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u091c\u094b\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0918\u094b\u0902\u0918\u093f \u092c\u094c\u0902\u0927 \u092c\u094c\u0902\u0927\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u0965 \u096a \u0965\n\u0930\u0947\u0936\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u091c\u094b\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u091f\u0942\u091f\u093f \u092b\u093e\u091f\u093f \u092c\u093f\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0965 \u096b \u0965\n\u092c\u091a\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0923\u0939\u0932 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0935\u093e\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0938\u0947 \u0939\u094b \u0915\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u092a\u093f\u0928\u0947\u0902 \u0965 \u096c \u0965\n\u091c\u0940\u0928 \u0916\u0921\u093c\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092a\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0947\u0938 \u091a\u094b\u091f\u0940 \u0965 \u096d \u0965\n\u0924\u0940\u0928\u093f \u0916\u0921\u093c\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0917\u093e\u0901\u091a\u094b\u0902 \u0965 \u096e \u0965\n\u092c\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u094b \u091a\u094b\u0924\u093f \u0930\u0947 \u091a\u094b\u0924\u093f\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0928\u0930\u0939\u0930 \u091c\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0965 \u096f \u0965\n\u092c\u0948\u0902\u091a\u0928\u093e \u0938\u0938\u0941\u0930 \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0941\u091a\u0930\u093e \u092d\u0938\u0941\u0930\u093e \u0965 \u0967\u0966 \u0965\n\u092c\u0938\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0939\u0930 \u0930\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0916\u0942\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u093e\u091c\u0947\u092c\u093e \u0928\u0947\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0965 \u0967\u0967 \u0965\n\u0917\u094b\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u0947\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0935\u093e \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092b\u094b\u0902\u0921\u093c\u093f \u092c\u094c\u0902\u0927\u093f \u092c\u0947\u0939\u0903 \u0965 \u0967\u0968 \u0965\n\u092c\u091a\u0928\u093e \u092c\u094b\u092c\u0928\u0935\u093e \u0965 \u0915\u091b\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0938\u0917\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0965 \u0967\u0969 \u0965\nTranslation.\n\n1. \u2018The house, O \u016adh\u014d, was of bamboos, and the lamp was flickering.\\(^1\\) I spread\\(^2\\) the border of my garment for a bed and slept\\(^3\\) with my husband.\n\n3. \u2018If I had known, O \u016adh\u014d, that my husband would desert me secretly, I would have tightly bound him to me with a silken cord.\n\n5. \u2018A silken cord will break and snap, O \u016adh\u014d, but where shall I find a beloved bound to me with (kind) words?\n\n7. \u2018Along the path by which\\(^4\\) my husband deserted me secretly, would I plant an orchard.\n\n9. \u2018On each side of the orchard would I plant plantain and cocoa-nut trees.\\(^5\\)\n\n10. \u2018In the courtyard\\(^6\\) is my father-in-law, O \u016adh\u014d, and\nat the gate my husband's elder brother.

It appears to mean that the speaker is considering the best way to induce K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's return. Will it be by adorning her person, and thereby enticing the man, or by meditating on his excellence, and thereby propitiating the deity? The first idea she abandons, for the wood-worm (of separation) has devoured the vermilion box (of her charms). It is hardly necessary to point out that a vermilion box is a portion of every married woman's toilet apparatus, and that she only puts it aside (and then for ever) when she becomes a widow. Here, either her beauty is compared to a vermilion box, or else she hints that she has become as good as a widow through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's prolonged absence.\nXLIV.\n\nThe following song is interesting as showing the occupations of a married woman in her husband's house. It narrates how a brother visits his married sister, and returns with news of her to his mother.\n\nThe metre in this also is obscure. It is founded on $6+4+4+2+4$ instants in each half line, but in order to get this, many long syllables must be read as short ones. Sometimes, e.g. in verses 7, 8, 9 and 10, there is even then an instant too many in the half line.

The song of the death of Bas\u2019t\u012b is a great favourite, and is widely known in Bih\u0101r.\nI have heard it sung in many places, and under many versions, but the present version is, I believe, both the original and the most spirited one. Unlike the song of Bhag'bat\u012b, it only hints at the main facts of a story, the particulars of which are supposed to be well known to its hearers. The legend tells how Bas't\u012b Singh's wife refused to listen to the criminal advances of her husband's elder brother; how the latter took out her husband under pretence of hunting and murdered him in the forest; how, in order to find his dead body and give it due funeral rites, she pretended to agree to the murderer's proposals; and how, finally, when the latter showed her the body, the fire of her chastity and love was so great that it set fire to her husband's funeral pile, and burnt her as a sat\u012b together with the corpse upon it.\n\nAs in the former songs, the metre is irregular. It is founded on $6+4+4+2$, $4+4+4+6$, but in many of the lines there are superfluous words (e.g., one \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u093f is superfluous in the very first), and many long vowels will

Hence its name. See Bih\u0101r Peasant Life, \u00a7 966.\n4 M\u016bg is phaseolus mungo, a kind of vetch. Out of it, and other similar pulses, is a kind of brose made. \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u093e is long form of \u0926\u093e\u0932.\n5 \u092e\u0941\u0902\u0917\u0940 \u091a\u093e is contracted from \u092e\u0941\u0902\u0917\u092e\u0935\u093e, which is redundant form of \u092e\u0941\u0902\u0917.\n6 \u092c\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e is fem. of \u092c\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e. See l. 5.\n7 It is a universal custom in Northern India, that while a wife may joke with her husband\u2019s younger brothers, she must always veil herself before, and may not speak even a word to, his elder brothers. The heroine of the song is proving her chastity and showing that she is not inviting the latter\u2019s criminal attentions. Hence she asks her natural protector, her husband\u2019s mother, to save her from the necessity of even appearing before him. The mother-in-law, however, does not understand, and insists on the girl serving the meal.\n\nLit. \u2018Having twisted your eight limbs, cover them,\u2019 etc. The eight limbs (\u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e) are well known to students of Sanskrit and need not be detailed here.\n8 i.e. do not let your hand appear through the veil, as you serve the dishes. \u0938\u0930\u093f\u0916\u093f is long form of \u0938\u0930\u0940\u0916\u093e 'like.' Secondarily it means, 'with' or 'by.' \u091a\u0941\u0932\u0939\u093e is the hand from the tips of the fingers to the wrist.\n\n9 Lit. from below upwards.\n\n10 \u0935\u093f\u092d\u094b\u0930\u093f 'in forgetfulness.'\n\n11 \u0917\u0941\u0923\u0935\u093e is long form of \u0917\u0942\u0923 'salt.'\n\n12 i.e. her husband. This verse is a good example of the very loose way in which the number of the Bhoj'p\u016br\u012b verb is used. Here the plural subject has a singular verb after it, because it is non-honorific, while the singular subject has a plural verb because it is honorific. In this verse I have translated \u091c\u093c\u0930 \u0930\u0947 \u092c\u0940 by 'alas, alas.'\n\n13 It is an evil omen when a woman's tikuli, or forehead spangle, falls off. If she is married, it is supposed to prognosticate the death of her husband. Note the peculiar use of \u0939\u0938\u0930\u0940, genitive of \u0939\u0938, with a feminine termination. The word has in fact reverted to its original sense as a pure possessive adjectival pronoun = Ap. Pr. \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0930 (\u092e\u0926\u0940\u092f; see Hem. iv. 434). Cf. introductory remarks, p. 213.\n\n14 \u091a\u0940\u0930\u0924 is only a rhyming repetition of \u0926\u0940\u0930\u0924. So also \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0924 is the same of \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0924.\n\n15 This is one of the stock lines which appears continually in poems like these.\n\n16 \u091a\u0942\u0921\u093c means 'to be killed in a fight.' The idea is that the brother-in-law, after having killed her husband, tries to gain admittance to her chamber, under pretence that he is the murdered man.

Cf. No. 25, Note 2.\n3 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f is a bundle made up of anything contained in one's loin-cloth, carried the way things are carried in an apron. It is specially used for the knot in the loin-cloth for holding money, etc.\n\nINDEX.\n\nThe following index contains all the words occurring in the foregoing songs. The words are shown as they are pronounced in prose, and not as in poetry. Hence the imperfect vowel\u00b9 in the middle of a word is indicated by an apostrophe. I have not thought it necessary to show specially when i and u at the end of a word are imperfect, as every final short i and u occurring in this index is imperfect, and to use special signs would have been unnecessary.\n\nSingular and plural forms of verbs are not distinguished. In ordinary Bih\u0101r\u012b, the plural is often used for the singular, and vice versa; the difference being rather one of honour than of number. Gender is distinguished, when a feminine form occurs, but as a rule the masculine forms, whether of adjectives or verbs, are used for the feminine as well; see Bhoj'p\u016br\u012b Grammar, \u00a7 35.\n\nDerivative forms are given under the original ones, with, when necessary, cross-references. Thus, long and redundant forms of substantives and adjectives are given under the short forms, and causal and potential passive forms of verbs under the simple root.\n\nThe system of transliteration adopted is that followed in the Comparative Dictionary of the Bih\u0101r\u012b Language. Anunasika is shown by the sign ~ over a vowel; thus \u0905\u0903=\u00e3, \u0906\u0903=\u0101, and so on.\n\nThe vowel \u0909\u00b2 has two sounds, a short (flatter than o in 'hot'), and a long (flatter than ough in 'ought'). These are\n\n\u00b9 See Comparative Dictionary of the Bih\u0101r\u012b Language, Introduction.\n\u00b2 See Introduction to Bih\u0101r\u012b Dictionary.\nrepresented in N\u0101gar\u012b by \u0905 and \u0906, and in transliteration by \na and \u0101 respectively.\n\nSo also the vowel \u0905 has two sounds, a short (like a in \nItalian 'ballo'), and a long (like a in Italian 'baco').

This bir'ha refers to the legend of Tripura, the triple aerial city which was burnt in a war with the gods. It was inhabited by Daityas, who had obtained a boon to the effect that they could not be destroyed until the Hind\u016b Triad had assumed the shape of animals. They had a reservoir containing amrita, and when any of them was killed in battle with the gods, his body was dipped in it, and he revived. Thereupon \u00c7iva assumed the form of a calf, and drank the reservoir dry, while Vi\u1e63\u1e47u became a horse, and Brahm\u0101 the bridle and whip. The sun and moon became the wheels of the chariot to which the horse was harnessed, and in which \u00c7iva rode, and destroyed the demons. According to this legend, \u00c7iva was the clever and wise man mentioned in the song.\n\nNo. 44, l. 14.

XIII.\u2014Observations on the various Texts and Translations of the so-called \"Song of Meys\u00fcn\"; an Inquiry into Meys\u00fcn's claim to its Authorship; and an Appendix on Arabic Transliteration and Pronunciation.\u00b9 By J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., Litt.D., C.M.G., etc., etc.\n\nDr. Carlyle's book, \"Specimens of Arabic Poetry,\" may be somewhat scarce, and Captain, now Sir R., Burton's \"Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah\" gives only an English version, without the Arabic text, of the little piece of poetry attributed to Meys\u00fcn, the mother of the second Damascus Caliph of the house of 'Umeyya, Yezid son of Mu'tawiya son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n \u0160akhr son of Harb, etc.\n\nMr. Freeland has, therefore, rendered a real service to the many lovers of old Arabian literature by printing in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, New Series, Vol. XVIII. p. 90, a complete and fully-vowelled text of the ditty, as this allows them to compare it with the very free rhymed and metrical versions made by himself, by Sir R. Burton, and by Dr. Carlyle. Their talented, but somewhat florid productions disguise altogether the real form and the simplicity of the little poem. I have imagined, therefore, that a closer verbal prose translation of its distichs would not be a disservice to the cause of Arabic studies in England.\n\nA valued and talented friend, one of the Members of our Society, Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, has kindly put my prose trans-\n\n\u00b9 As this paper may be considered illustrative of its author's method of Arabic transliteration, the native names are left precisely as spelt in the MS.; not modified to be in accordance with the orthography usually adopted in the Journal. The author, however, prefers a straight stroke under the letters \u1e25 \u1e63 s, instead of the dot (\u1e25 \u1e63 s) as used throughout this article; see his reasons on p. 308.\u2014Ed.\nlation into a metrical form, with the same kind of monotone rhyme that is used in the Arabic original,\u2014a system of versification for which he expresses a great attachment, and in which he has had much experience.\n\nTo enable the readers of our Journal to compare these five versions with one another, I here copy those of Dr. Carlyle and Sir R. Burton, while Mr. Freeland's rendering, with his recension of the Arabic text, can be studied at p. 90-91 of the present volume.\n\nDr. Carlyle says (according to Mr. Clouston's \"Arabic Poetry for English Readers\"):\n\n\"The Song of Maisuna.\n\n\"The russet suit of camel's hair,\nWith spirits light and eye serene,\nIs dearer to my bosom far,\nThan all the trappings of a queen.\n\n\"The humble tent, and murmuring breeze,\nThat whistles through its fluttering walls,\nMy unaspiring fancy please,\nBetter than towers and splendid halls.\n\n\"Th' attendant colts, that bounding fly,\nAnd frolic by the litter's side,\nAre dearer in Maisuna's eye,\nThan gorgeous mules in all their pride.\n\n\"The watch-dog's voice, that bays whene'er\nA stranger seeks his master's cot,\nSounds sweeter in Maisuna's ear,\nThan yonder trumpet's long-drawn note.\n\n\"The rustic youth, unspoiled by art,\nSon of my kindred, poor but free,\nWill ever to Maisuna's heart,\nBe dearer, pampered fool, than thee.\"\n\nSir R. Burton's \"Pilgrimage,\" vol. iii. p. 262, has:\n\n\"O take these purple robes away,\nGive back my cloak of camel's hair,\nAnd bear me from this tow'ring pile\nTo where the Black Tents flap i' the air.\"\nThe camel's colt with falt'ring tread,\nThe dog that bays at all but me,\nDelight me more than ambling mules\u2014\nThan every art of minstrelsy.\nAnd any cousin, poor but free,\nMight take me, fatted ass! from thee.\"\n\nFrom a comparison of these two versions, it is evident that Dr. Carlyle and Sir R. Burton have used the same Arabic recension, in five distichs, for their renderings, however widely these two differ in form and in words. Sir R. Burton's is less diffuse than that of Dr. Carlyle. The latter uses the expression 'pampered fool' where Sir R. Burton has 'fatted ass.' I had imagined, with only Mr. Freeland's Arabic text to judge from, that these two offensive variants were perhaps either poetic licences, or that the text or texts they had used had the word \u0639\u062c\u0644 'a calf,' in the last hemistich, where Mr. Freeland gives the anagram \u0639\u0644. In that case, \u0639\u0644 \u0639\u0644 \u0639\u0644 would have meant, correctly rendered, 'foddered calf,' easily turned by poetic licence into both 'pampered fool' and 'fatted ass.'\n\nMy friend Mr. Gibb has, however, latterly favoured me with a copy of Dr. Carlyle's Arabic original, from the second edition of his \"Specimens,\" London, 1810; and this has the same word, \u0639\u0644, given by Mr. Freeland. Neither of their translations has, unfortunately, a trace of either of the two real meanings of the term \u0639\u0644, viz. 1st, 'an ass, wild or domestic, strong and fat;' 2nd, 'a man, foreign and non-Muslim' (i.e. an outlandish barbarian). But, as its accompanying adjective, \u0639\u0644, means, 'home-fed, foddered, not pastured or pasturing,' the two words combined can only indicate 'a fodder-fed domestic ass,' the alternative signification, 'an outlandish barbarian,' being, consequently, out of the question. Neither Dr. Carlyle nor Sir F. Burton is quite right, therefore, in this respect, as Dr. Carlyle's 'pampered fool' and Sir R. Burton's 'fatted ass' are somewhat wide of the original expression, 'a fodder-fed ass.'\nI subjoin here Dr. Carlyle's Arabic text for comparison. It gives no vowel-points, and it contains some variants from Mr. Freeland's recension. Omitting the fifth and sixth distichs of the latter for the present, the two texts follow the same order of the verses.\n\n\u0642\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u062a \u0628\u062d\u0644\u0644\n\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0633 \u0639\u0628\u0627 \u0648 \u062a\u0642\u0631 \u0639\u064a\u0646\u064a * \u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0628\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0648\u0641 (1)\n\u0648 \u0628\u064a\u062a \u062a\u062e\u062a\u0646\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d \u0641\u064a\u0647 * \u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u064a\u0641 (2)\n\u0648 \u0628\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0628\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0638\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u0639\u0628 * \u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u063a\u0644 \u0631\u0641\u0648\u0641 (3)\n\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0628 \u064a\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0646\u064a * \u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0641 (4)\n(5, 6)\n\n\u0648 \u062e\u0631\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u0649 \u0639\u0645\u064a \u0646\u063a\u064a\u0631 * \u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u062c \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0641 (7)\n\nIn 1873, Mr. Gibb has again informed me, Messrs. Henry S. King and Co. published some part of an Arabic work, printed in Egypt, but translated and annotated by a lady, Mrs. Godfrey Clerk, in which the song of Meys\u00fbn is given in seven distichs, like that of Mr. Freeland; evidently the same in words, but arranged in a different order. Her translation runs thus:\n\n1 (2). A hut that the winds make tremble\nIs dearer to me than a noble palace;\n\n2 (5). And a dish of crumbs on the floor of my home\nIs dearer to me than a varied feast;\n\n3 (6). And the soughing of the breeze through every crevice\nIs dearer to me than the beating of drums;\n\n4 (1). And a camel's wool ab\u00e2h which gladdens my eye\nIs dearer to me than filmy robes;\n\n5 (4). And a dog barking around my path\nIs dearer to me than a coaxing cat;\n\n6 (3). And a restive young camel, following the litter,\nIs dearer to me than a pacing mule;\n\n7 (7). And a feeble boor from midst my cousinhood,\nIs dearer to me than a rampant ass.\nThe numbers in parentheses show Mr. Freeland's order of the distichs, for the sake of comparison. The words of each distich are mainly, essentially, the same in the two versions. Mrs. Clerk's translation is much closer to the Arabic text than either Dr. Carlyle's, or Sir R. Burton's, as a whole; though several words are incorrectly rendered, and many of the ideas incorporated in the lady's imagery are taken from Western life, not redolent of the Desert.\n\nMrs. Clerk's notice of Meys\u00fcn is to the following effect: \"M\u00eds\u00fcn, the daughter of Bahdal, was married to Mu\u00e2wiyah, and he brought her from amongst the wandering Arabs into Damascus. But she sorrowed exceedingly for her people at the remembrance of her home; and one day, whilst he was listening to her, he heard her reciting and saying\" the verses given above. \"Upon hearing these lines, Mu\u00e2wiyah exclaimed, 'The daughter of Bahdal was not satisfied until she had likened me to a rampant ass!' And he ordered her to be packed off again to her family in the desert.\"\n\nIn a note, Mrs. Clerk says further: \"She had an excellent genius for poetry; and at Mu\u00e2wiyah's command, took her son Yezid (Mu\u00e2wiyah's successor) with her into the desert among her own relations, in order to inspire him with poetic sentiments.\"\n\nA foot-note in Sir R. Burton's \"Pilgrimage\" informs us as follows: \"The British reader will be shocked to hear that by the term 'fatted ass,' the intellectual lady alluded to her husband. The story is, that Muawiyah, overhearing the song, sent back the singer to her cousins and beloved wilds. Maysunah departed, with her son Yezid, and did not return to Damascus till the 'fatted ass' had joined his forefathers.\"\n\nDr. Carlyle (in Mr. Clouston's book) gives the same story, but in more reserved terms, ending thus: \"As a punishment for her fault, he ordered her to retire from court. Maisuna immediately obeyed, and, taking her infant son Yezid with her, returned to Yemen; nor did she revisit Damascus till after the death of Mowiah, when Yezid ascended the throne.\"\nMrs. Clerk writes \"M\u012bs\u016bn\" instead of Meys\u016bn. But, with Dr. Carlyle's \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646, though he transliterates 'Maisuna,' we can see that Mr. Freeland's \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646, transliterated by him 'Maisun,' is the true name, as is confirmed in the Q\u0101m\u016bs lexicon under the root \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0646, where it is said: \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064d \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064d \"and Meys\u016bn is the name of the daughter of Bahdel, the mother of Yezid son of Mu\u2018awiya.\" Sir R. Burton's 'Maysunah' is, therefore, quadruply erroneous, the first vowel being, correctly, the soft e, not the hard a; while the second vowel is long, \u016b; and the final 'ah' a double interpolation.\n\nReferring now to Mr. Freeland's text, p. 90, any one may observe, even if entirely uninstructed in Arabic, that it presents on the right-hand side of the left-hand column of hemistichs, as he looks at the page, a perpendicular row of the words \u062d\u0628\u0651\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646 seven times repeated, once in each distich. These words simply mean: (were) lovelier to me than . . . . This one reiterated expression, then, heads the second clause, the second hemistich, of each verse or distich, without the alteration of a single letter or vowel-point, and indelibly stamps the type of the whole poem in a most determinate, remarkable manner.\n\nBut let the reader next examine the versions of Dr. Carlyle, Sir R. Burton, and Mr. Freeland, comparing them with Mrs. Clerk's rendering. He will perceive that they have all three systematically shunned this sevenfold, characteristic series of words; they have striven to give a variety to what requires uniformity,\u2014they have attempted \"to gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\" and they have merely overlaid na\u00efve Eastern simplicity with a series of Western embellishments.\n\nThe somewhat metrical prose translation offered below for further elucidation gives as close an approximation to the sense of the original as I have been able to compass, in about the same number of syllables; and my friend Mr. Gibb's versification which follows it, without losing sight of the Arabic text, will be found, I trust, by our readers, to exhale,\nlike the sweet wood-violet, an aroma as delicately poetic as\nthe very simple ideas, clothed in the artless words of the\npoem, can well be made to furnish.\n\n**Meysun's Ditty.**\n\nTo dress in camlet smock, with tearless, cheerful eye,\nWere lovelier to me than gauzy webs to wear.\nA tent through which the winds should waft their fluttering breeze,\nWere lovelier to me than sumptuous princely bower.\nA wayward camel-colt, behind the litter-train,\nWere lovelier to me than nimbly-pacing mule.\nA dog that bayed the coming guests not yet at hand,\nWere lovelier to me than fondly-coaxing cat.\nTo eat a crumblet in a tent's retiring nook\nWere lovelier to me than eating breadcake bun.\nThe hoarse, loud roarings of the winds in every glen,\nWere lovelier to me than timbrels' clattering pulse.\nA generous, slender youth, one of my uncle's sons,\nWere lovelier to me than any foddered ass.\n\nMr. Gibb's versified rendering is as follows:\n\n**Meysun's Ditty.**\n\nTo dress in camlet smock with cool and placid eyne,\nWere liefer far to me than robes of gauze to wear;\nA tent, wherethrough the winds in gentle wafts should breathe,\nWere liefer far to me than palace haught and fair;\nA wayward camel-colt behind the litter-train,\nWere liefer far to me than hinny debonair;\nA dog that bayed the guests ere yet they came me nigh,\nWere liefer far to me than cat with fondling air;\nTo eat a scantling meal aside within the tent,\nWere liefer far to me than feast on dainties rare;\nThe soughing moan of winds that blow through every glen,\nWere liefer far to me than sounding tabors' blare;\nA slim but generous youth from 'mong my uncle's sons,\nWere liefer far to me than foddered ass, I swear.\nThe reader is now in a position to choose for himself which of the English versions given of this little Arabian song, ballad, or ditty he may think best adapted to convey its real meaning. The variants in Dr. Carlyle's text, as compared with that of Mr. Freeland, of \u0639\u0628\u0627 for \u0639\u0628\u0627\u060c of \u062a\u062e\u062a for \u062a\u062e\u062a\u060c of \u0631\u0641\u0648\u0641 for \u0631\u0641\u0648\u0641\u060c are not of much consequence, the last, \u0631\u0641\u0648\u0641\u060c being probably a printer's error. His \u0647\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0641\u0648\u0641\u060c however, indicates that the sixth line of Mr. Freeland's version was not altogether unknown to some copyist through whom Dr. Carlyle's text was derived, as that distich ends with \u062a\u0642\u0631 \u0623\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0641\u0628\u060c of which the \u062a\u0642\u0631\u060c is a synonym with Dr. Carlyle's \u0647\u0632\u061b and this last, again, is apparently a clerical substitute for Mr. Freeland's \u062a\u0642\u0631\u060c two distichs having been thus erroneously fused into one. The substitution of \u062a\u0642\u0631 for \u062a\u0642\u0631\u060c accounts for Dr. Carlyle's expression of 'poor,' where Mr. Freeland's text requires a rendering of 'slim,' 'thin,' 'slender,' or the like, though Mr. Freeland's free-and-easy rendering suggests nothing of the kind.\n\nTaking the distichs of Mrs. Clerk's version in the order of Mr. Freeland's text, it may be remarked that she has misunderstood the expression in No. 1 about the eye. It is not the 'ab\u00e2h' that is to gladden the eye; but it is 'a camlet smock' together with a cool, i.e. an unreddened, uninflamed, 'tearless, cheerful eye,' or, in other words, \"a camlet with happiness of mind were lovelier, dearer to me . . . .\" In No. 2, again, it should not be that 'the winds make tremble' the tent; but that the winds flutter as they pass through the tent. In No. 3, 'litter' should be litters, i.e. a train of several or many litters. In No. 4, \"around my path\" is a thoroughly Western misconception of what really means in front of me, i.e. between them and me, \"short of me.\" In No. 5, \"varied feast\" is too far from the sense as to both words; the comparison is between a dry, broken little morsel, \"a crumblet,\" and a fresh-baked, soft\ncake of bread, usually eaten in Syria, etc., with other food at meals. In No. 6, \"crevice\" is not right; and in No. 7, the \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0642\u0652 of the text is the very reverse of \"a boor,\" and really means a fine, noble fellow; while \"rampant\" is wrong altogether, unless we are to read, as is given further on, in Ziy\u0101 Pasha's recension, \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064c for \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064d after \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064d.\n\nThe text given by Ziy\u0101 Pasha (then Ziy\u0101 Bey) in a three-volume collection of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish poems, to which he gave the name of \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0642\u0652\u060c is found in vol. ii. p. 442, of the collection. It does not agree in the sequence of the distichs with either of those of Mr. Freeland or Mrs. Clerk, except as to the last, and only important one. This occupies the same place in all three, as also in the versions of Dr. Carlyle and Sir R. Burton. Several variant words occur, too, in the distichs. No vowels are given.

\u0631\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0641 appears to be a misprint; and in 7, \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0641\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 a coarse barbarian, a tiresome lout, is a much more apposite converse of \u062c\u064e\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064f a slender, generous youth, than is \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0641\u0650 a foddered ass. Were the poem to be edited anew, this word \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0641\u0650 should be adopted as the better and probably true reading. The distich could then be rendered:\n\n\"A slender, generous youth, one of my uncle's sons,\nWere lovelier to me than any tiresome lout.\"\n\nBy further considering that, as none of the distichs except this last is composed of two rhyming hemistichs, it would be perhaps better if this distich also were deprived of its rhyme; a critic might feel inclined to prefer Dr. Carlyle's \u0642\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0650 at the end of the first hemistich, and the distich might stand thus in translation:\n\n\"A generous youth, though poor, one of my uncle's sons,\nWere lovelier to me than rude, offensive lout.\"\n\nBut \"poor\" and \"generous,\" again, are not very usual poetic concomitants; and a word such as \u0643\u064e\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0650 tender-hearted, \u062e\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064c considerate, \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064c noble, etc., if met with in any variant recension, would make a better antithesis to \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0641\u0650, and would be a still more preferable alternative to \u062c\u064e\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064f or \u0641\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0650 in the hemistich here treated of.\n\nOf the whole, very artless poem, it may be said that the repetition of \u0628\u064e\u0634\u0650 in distich No. 1, and of \u0627\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0644\u0650 in distich No. 5, are doubtless blemishes. The repetition of \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u0650\u064a in distichs 2 and 5, and the virtual repetition of \u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650 and \u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650 in\ndistichs 2 and 6, are still open to objection, though less so than the former. The variation of the rhyming long vowels, by the use of four letters, \u06cc', and three letters, \u0633', is at best a permissible licence in Arabic verse, is not tolerated in Persian or Turkish, and cannot be taken as adding beauty to the poem. The sevenfold repetition may be taken, perhaps, as a very effectual mark of individuality in the composition, which thus stands unparalleled, very likely, and can therefore be held to constitute a kind of beauty not advisable to imitate.\n\nWe may, therefore, look upon \"Meys\u00fcn's Poem\" as a somewhat faulty, though striking, artless ballad, well adapted to captivate the rude, uncultivated children of the desert and villagers, so as to elicit their applause on being recited. We shall then have said as much in its praise as its subject admits of; and this preference for desert-life shown in its words may, it seems, have given to our own poet, Moore, the germ of the idea from which he evolved his charming little gem of \"Fly to the desert, fly with me!\" which is as untrue, in reality, as it is specious and captivating to young, ardent minds, unacquainted with the hard lot of incessant toil, frequent starvation, and ceaseless blood-feuds, of which the life of the desert is chiefly made up.\n\nBut a much more serious question arises with reference to the supposed authorship of this little Arabic ditty; more especially since it is known that Ziya Pasha, himself a poet of high standing and research, avows himself ignorant of its composer. In a marginal note he has laconically marked the poem as being \"by an author unknown.\" One would imagine that he must certainly have known that common rumour has for ages attributed it to Meys\u00fcn; and he may, therefore, in his judgment, have deliberately and definitively rejected this parentage. Before I had heard of his marginal note, I had myself felt inclined to doubt, urged by considerations of the status and known or probable precedents, respectively, of the dramatis personae of the little burletta. Did, then, Meys\u00fcn\nprobably compose or even sing these verses? Did Mu'awiya, on hearing her sing them on a chance occasion, dismiss her summarily from his home\u2014from his mansion of governor, for he was not a sovereign until many years later? His son and successor, Yezid, from his recorded age of 34 at his accession, must have been born not many years after Mu'awiya became governor of Damascus for the second caliph 'Umer; and thus, to answer the two foregoing questions with any degree of probability, we must trace the history, not of Mu'awiya only, but of the rise and early progress of Isl\u0101m, as follows:\n\nMu'awiya's father, 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n \u0160akhr son of Harb son of 'Umeyya (whence the name of the 'Umeyyid dynasty), was born B.H. 57 (A.D. 565), being Mu\u1e25ammed's senior by about five years. He was a rich, travelling merchant, became head and captain of the Qureysh tribe (from a branch of which, the \u1e24ashimids, Mu\u1e25ammed also sprang), and a kind of Doge or Mayor, Sheykh of Mekka. He bravely, sternly opposed Mu\u1e25ammed in the field for some years, but failed, ultimately, of success. When Mu\u1e25ammed, in the eighth year of the emigration (Hijra) from Mekka to Med\u012bna, and sixtieth year of his age, advanced at length with a resistless force, and received the submission of his native place, he was met at some distance from the holy city, first by his own paternal uncle, 'Abb\u0101s, slightly his superior in age (who had always been friendly to him, and whose descendants eventually became the 'Abb\u0101sid caliphs), and then by his hitherto determined enemy, 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, aged sixty-five (and whom 'Umer would have killed, had not Mu\u1e25ammed restrained him). These both at that time made their profession of 'Isl\u0101m, were accepted by Mu\u1e25ammed, and followed him into Mekka. There and then did the wife of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, with her two sons, Yezid (aged thirty-one) and Mu'awiya (aged thirty), also avow their adhesion to 'Isl\u0101m. Mu'awiya even professed to have secretly embraced the faith two years earlier, when Mu\u1e25ammed made the truce of \u1e24udeybiyya with the Mekkans. 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n's\ndaughter, Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya\u2019s sister, \u2019Ummu-\u1e24ab\u012bba Remla, had already been married in that sixth year of the \u1e24ijra (A.D. 628), as a widow, to Mu\u1e25ammed, having, with her first husband, early adopted \u2019Isl\u0101m, and with him joined the former emigration to Abyssinia. There he died, and there she was betrothed by proxy to Mu\u1e25ammed, joining him later at Med\u012bna. Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya was therefore Mu\u1e25ammed\u2019s brother-in-law.\n\n\u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, with his two sons, Yez\u012bd and Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya, as well as \u2019Abb\u0101s, fought for \u2019Isl\u0101m under Mu\u1e25ammed in the battle of Huneyn after the conquest of Mekka, in the same year, A.H. 8 (A.D. 630). They each received from Mu\u1e25ammed, as a share of the spoil captured through the victory, one hundred camels and forty ounces of silver. \u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n was present, later in the same year, at the siege and capture of Ta\u02beif, where he lost an eye by a wound.\n\nMu\u02bf\u0101wiya, the younger of the two sons of \u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, was henceforward employed by Mu\u1e25ammed as one of his secretaries, scribes, or amanuenses; being one of twenty-three whose names are recorded as having served in that capacity, some more, some less. Zeyd son of Th\u0101bit was the most usual scribe, and Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya stands next; having served so more than any of the remaining one-and-twenty, although the whole of the first four caliphs, \u2019Eb\u016b-Bekr, \u2019Umer, \u2019Uthm\u0101n, and \u2019Aliyy, are included among them by history.\n\nMu\u1e25ammed died in A.H. 11 (A.D. 632) at Med\u012bna, and was succeeded by \u2019Eb\u016b-Bekr, \u201cthe Most Faithful,\u201d as guide and ruler of young and orphaned \u2019Isl\u0101m; spontaneously elected by his peers, the acknowledged leaders of the infant community. He took the title of Khalifa (substitute; whence our \u201ccaliph\u201d). He had first to recall to their faith and allegiance many of the tribes of Arabia. Then, in A.H. 12 (A.D. 633), he sent an army to oppose the Romans in southern trans-Jordanic Syria. He gave the chief command to Yez\u012bd, Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya\u2019s elder brother, son of \u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n. Yez\u012bd re-\npeatedly broke the Roman levies opposed to him, and sent rich spoils to Medina, the \"City of the Prophet,\" where Muhammed was buried; his grave, with those of his three immediate successors, being piously visited to this day. Mu'sawiya accompanied his brother Yezid in this expedition, and never quitted him as long as they both lived. They never returned to Arabia from Syria.\n\nYezid's successes paved the way to the further despatch of warriors from Medina; and these were put under the command of 'Amr, son of 'Asi (written also 'As). In his younger days 'Amr had persecuted Muhammed with insulting jeers and stinging lampoons. He now showed himself a zealous Muslim, a good general, and, later on, a no less skilful diplomatist.\n\nWhen yet more numerous levies were gradually forwarded from Medina, coming from all Arabia, 'Amr was directed to draw towards Palestine, while Yezid advanced on the road towards Damascus, and other captains were sent to different quarters. The chief command was entrusted to 'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda, son of Jerr\u0101h. Though eminently prudent, he lacked all military dash, celerity, and ability. Success now seemed to favour the Romans, conquest came to a standstill. 'Eb\u016b-Bekr therefore recalled from Babylonia, where he had begun to make himself felt, the redoubtable Kh\u0101lid, son of Wel\u012bd, Muhammed's \"Sword of God,\" to infuse new vigour into the Syrian campaign. In a short time Busr\u0101 (Bostra) fell to his arms; and next, Damascus was besieged.\n\nThe Roman emperor Heraclius, then holding his court at Antioch, thrice sent a large force to relieve Damascus. Thrice was the siege suspended to go and meet these reliefs. Thrice were the Roman succours defeated in the field, twice near Baalbek, the third time at 'Ejn\u0101deyn (Aiznadin), near Anti-Lebanon. After this, Damascus did not long hold out against the Muslim hosts. But on the very day of its capture, the caliph 'Eb\u016b-Bekr breathed his last at Medina,\nwhen sixty-three years of age, in A.H. 13 (A.D. 634). He was succeeded by 'Umer, son of Khatt\u0101b, now fifty-three years old. This caliph reappointed 'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda to the chief command, and Baalbek was taken in A.H. 15 (A.D. 636). Emessa (\u1e24im\u1e63) was next occupied, after Resten and Sheyzer had surrendered.\n\n'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda now went southwards to meet a fourth Roman army under the emperor's son Constantine, who was at C\u00e6sarea (C\u00e6sarea Philippi, Bany\u0101s?) with fifty thousand men. They were met, however, by a still larger force of eighty thousand, under a general named Manuel, who had been further reinforced by sixty thousand Christian Arabians from the trans-Jordan regions, under Jebela, son of 'Eyhem, the last king of the line of Gass\u0101n, who later embraced Isl\u0101m, but again apostatized. The two opposing forces met on the banks of the Yerm\u016bk river, the Hieromax of classical authors. A battle ensued and lasted several days, the Romans being at length utterly defeated, and Manuel killed in A.H. 15 (Nov. A.D. 636). The victors returned to Damascus.\n\nThe caliph 'Umer now ordered the siege of Jerusalem. Yezid son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n led the van from Damascus, and 'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda followed with the main force. After four months' siege, Jerusalem offered to capitulate on condition that the caliph should come from Med\u012bna to take possession. He did so, and the surrender took place in A.H. 17 (A.D. 638).\n\nAleppo and Antioch next fell to the Muslim arms that same year, and from this latter city the Roman emperor Heraclius fled to Constantinople.\n\nOn the other hand, the caliph 'Umer, after the capture of Jerusalem, ordered 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i to proceed to the conquest of Egypt. He first laid siege to C\u00e6sarea, and sent Yezid son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n to attack Tyre, which was given up to him by treachery, as Tripoli of Syria had been delivered to the Muslims before. Constantine now left his\ncamp, and retreated to C\u00e6sarea Pal\u00e6stinae on the sea-coast; but he ultimately fled thence by sea, and this town was surrendered to 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i. Other places fell in succession, and the conquest of Syria was completed in the fifth year of the caliph, and latter part of A.H. 17 (A.D. 639). A pestilence now broke out at Emmaus, and spread all over Syria, from which both 'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda and Yez\u012bd son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n died in A.H. 18 (A.D. 640), the latter leaving no issue, and appointing his younger brother Mu\u02bfawiya to succeed him in his command over Damascus and Syria. He had earned the popular name of Yez\u012bd the Good.\n\nIn the year A.H. 20 (A.D. 641) the caliph 'Umer made Mu\u02bfawiya son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n governor of Syria, as he had been locum tenens until then of his deceased brother. He was then about forty-two years of age, and continued governor for nineteen years during the caliphates of 'Umer, 'Uthm\u0101n, and 'Aliyy. He and 'Aliyy at first, and next he and 'Aliyy's eldest son \u1e24asan, were rival caliphs during the last five or six years of that period; but 'Aliyy being murdered at K\u016bfa in Babylonia in A.H. 35 (A.D. 655), and \u1e24asan resigning soon after, Mu\u02bfawiya was at length universally acknowledged as the sole caliph of 'Isl\u0101m in A.H. 41 (A.D. 661), being then sixty-three years old.\n\nAs Mu\u02bfawiya son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n died in A.H. 60 (A.D. 679), when his son and successor Yez\u012bd was thirty-four years of age, the latter was, consequently, born in A.H. 26 (A.D. 646); and, as there is no mention made of his having had any brother or sister, his father most probably took Yez\u012bd's mother Meys\u016bn to wife in A.H. 25 (A.D. 645), the year after he was confirmed in his government by the third caliph 'Uthm\u0101n. She was, most likely, at that time from twelve to fourteen years of age, and Mu\u02bfawiya was forty-seven.\n\nMu\u02bfawiya had asked permission of the caliph 'Umer to fit out ships on the coast; but 'Umer was averse from the project. When he was murdered in A.H. 24 (A.D. 644), and 'Uthm\u0101n\nsucceeded him, 'Uthm\u0101n gave the required sanction. In A.H. 26 (A.D. 646), then, the very year of his son Yez\u012bd's birth, he sent his first ships to sea, and the firstfruits of the expedition was the capture of Aradus and Cyprus. The defeat of a Roman fleet was the next exploit. Then Crete and Malta were visited, and Rhodes captured. Old Phenician days had returned. Another Roman fleet was beaten on the coast of Asia Minor; every port in those parts was thrown into a state of alarm, and the harbour of Constantinople itself was the scene of naval hostilities. Such was Mu'awiya at and about the time of Yez\u012bd's birth.\n\nThe caliph 'Uthm\u0101n now dismissed the conqueror and governor of Egypt, the talented 'Amr, son of '\u0100\u1e63i. He appointed in 'Amr's stead his own foster-brother, 'Abdu'llah son of Sa'd. Troubles broke out in Medina itself, ending in the assassination of the caliph in A.H. 35 (A.D. 655), and the proclamation of 'Aliyy, son of 'Ebu-Tal\u012bb, Mu\u1e25ammed's cousin-german and son-in-law. He had married the youngest of the prophet's daughters, Fa\u1e6d\u012bma, and by her was the father of \u1e24asan and \u1e24useyn, who were about seven and six years of age, respectively, when Mu\u1e25ammed and also their mother died in one year. From these five, Mu\u1e25ammed, Fa\u1e6d\u012bma, 'Aliyy, \u1e24asan, and \u1e24useyn, are descended, through fathers or mothers, all the Seyyids and Sherifs of 'Isl\u0101m. The five are known as \"the holy mantle family, 'ehlu'l kissa'.\"\n\nBut Mu'awiya accused 'Aliyy of being privy to, if not of covertly instigating, the murder of 'Uthm\u0101n. He proclaimed himself the avenger of the slaughtered ruler, and his party saluted him as caliph. He called to his councils the talented 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i, promising to reinstate him in Egypt. Armies were levied on each side, and in A.H. 37 (A.D. 657) the two conflicting Muslim hosts, 'Aliyy's from Babylonia, and Mu'awiya's from Syria, came in sight at \u1e62if\u012bn, on the bank of the Euphrates, and fought several severe battles with balanced success. Negotiations were set on foot; and it was\narranged that, for the peace of 'Isl\u0101m and avoidance of further bloodshed, the rivals should defer the question of the caliphate to umpires, and should meanwhile retire, each to his own capital. Mu\u02bfawiya named as his umpire the astute and talented \u2018Amr son of \u2018\u0100\u1e63i, and \u2018Aliyy another. These met, after some delay, at D\u016bmetu-l-Jendel (the biblical Dumah, the modern J\u0113w\u012bf, Palgrave\u2019s \u2018Djowf\u2019), on the south border of the Syrian desert. By a stratagem, \u2018Aliyy was deposed by his own umpire, and \u2018Amr son of \u2018\u0100\u1e63i proclaimed Mu\u02bfawiya to be the sole and rightful caliph.\n\nEach of the rivals, notwithstanding, kept possession of what he held, until, in A.H. 40 (A.D. 660), \u2018Aliyy was murdered in his own capital. His eldest son \u1e24asan, then 36 years old, was set up in his place by his party. Difficulties arising, however, \u1e24asan made terms with Mu\u02bfawiya, abdicated, and retired to Medina with his younger brother \u1e24useyn.\n\nMu\u02bfawiya thus became at length, in A.H. 41 (A.D. 661), the undisputed caliph of \u2019Isl\u0101m. His father \u2019Ebu-Sufy\u0101n had died ten years earlier, in A.H. 31, at the age of eighty-six. His son Yezid was now fifteen years old. His dynasty, the house of \u2019Umeyya, the \u2019Umeyyids, vulgarly denominated by Europeans the Ommiads, ruled for ninety-one years, until A.H. 132 (A.D. 749), when they were exterminated by the descendants of \u2019Abb\u0101s, the \u2019Abb\u0101sid\u012bs. They conquered all north Africa, invaded Spain, and pushed on, in the east, to India and China.\n\nMu\u02bfawiya surrounded himself with men of talent; and under his auspices Roman or Greek science began to be cultivated by the Arabian Muslims, in addition to their own native poetry and the various nascent branches of Muslim theology, philosophy, tradition, law, etc. This is not to be wondered at, when we reflect what numbers of Roman citizens and subjects embraced \u2019Isl\u0101m, many of them persons of rank, culture, and learning. Faithful to his promise, Mu\u02bfawiya reinstated immediately the able \u2018Amr son of \u2018\u0100\u1e63i in his\ngovernment of Egypt, where he died and was buried in A.H. 43 (A.D. 663).\n\nMu'awiya now, A.H. 44 (A.D. 664), made an effort to obtain possession of the capital of the eastern empire of Rome, the city of Constantine the Great. His general was the veteran Sufyan son of 'Abdu'l-lah, who had under his command Mu'awiya's only son Yezid, aged 18, the younger son of the murdered caliph 'Aliyy, Huseyn, aged 46, and the venerable 'Ebu-'Eyyub Khalid son of Zeyd, who, forty-four years before, at Medina, had been the host of Muhammed for a month, on his first arrival as a fugitive from Mekka; besides other warriors of renown or promise. Six years were unavailingly consumed in this distant enterprise. 'Ebu-'Eyyub was one of its victims. His death occurred about the year A.H. 50 (A.D. 670); and a mausoleum was built over his grave in later days, having by its side the cathedral mosque where the Ottoman Sultan-Caliphs now assume the sabre at their ceremonial accession.\n\nMu'awiya's only son Yezid, born, as before mentioned, in A.H. 26 (A.D. 646), had married, when only sixteen years of age, in A.H. 42 (A.D. 662), and had become a father the year following, A.H. 43 (A.D. 663), before he went to seek renown at the siege of Constantinople. After his return from thence, when Hasan, the eldest son of the former caliph 'Aliyy, was poisoned at Medina, as was said, in A.H. 49 (A.D. 680), Yezid, then twenty-three years old, was accused or suspected, perhaps by sectarian or family enemies of his line, of having instigated Hasan's murder by one of the wives of the victim, so as to clear the way to his own succession. But the murdered man left a brother; and they both had several sons. Moreover, Yezid did not succeed his father until eleven years later, A.H. 60 (A.D. 679), as Mu'awiya lived to be eighty years old, or more. Yezid was then thirty-four, reigned but five years, died in A.H. 65 (A.D. 684), and had for his successor his only son, Mu'awiya II., aged twenty-two. He abdicated after a\nreign of only six months, and died soon afterwards, the direct line of the great Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya thus becoming extinct, and the sovereignty passing to collaterals.\n\nFrom this cursory survey we see that history is silent respecting Yez\u012bd son of Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya and his mother Meys\u016bn from the time of his birth until his father sent him to the siege of Constantinople when he was eighteen years old, and when Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya was an undisputed and mighty monarch. It cannot, therefore, be directly disproved that Meys\u016bn was sent away for singing her song, or that she took her son away with her. It may be remarked that the words said to have been addressed to her on the occasion by Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya, \u201cRejoin thou thy people,\u201d do not constitute a full divorce *a vinculo matrimonii* in \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101m, but are recallable.\n\nIf we suppose that she was dismissed to her own kin when Yez\u012bd was about a year old, he may have been recalled by Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya as soon as was deemed necessary for his education. This was, apparently, completed when he was allowed to marry at the age of sixteen, and was sent to the siege of Constantinople when eighteen. If he remained with his mother till he was eight or ten, he may have imbibed poetic notions from her kindred, sufficient to be improved by culture under teachers provided by his father, a man of mark in all the learning of the period. His training by such teachers from that time till he was sixteen, and even eighteen, was ample. He must by then have acquired enough of the vernacular purity of diction and poetic eloquence to warrant the reputation he has left of being an accomplished orator and a talented extemporiser of verse. The Arabian tribesmen, before Mu\u1e25ammed\u2019s advent, as they are still, were, many of them, good scribes and first-rate oral poets, whose verses flew far and wide over the whole peninsula, to be repeated at social gatherings even to our day. Almost all the early generals of \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101m were famed as poets also.\n\nSuch being the possibilities, what, on the other hand, are\nthe probabilities that common sense may educe out of the meagre details that must serve as the premisses to any conclusion as to Meys\u00fcn and the poem attributed to her?\n\nWe learn, in short, from the historical fragments given above, that 'Ebn-Sufy\u0101n, and also his two sons, Yez\u012bd the Good and Mu\u02bfawiya, were men of talent and learning. Verses by the father have come down to us; Yez\u012bd was a successful leader; and Mu\u02bfawiya excelled in all the qualities that go to make up a great ruler. They all three went to Syria after Mu\u1e25ammed\u2019s death, aided in the conquest of that country, and died there. Mu\u02bfawiya, more especially, after he became governor of that province, made himself so beloved or feared that he ultimately became the greatest potentate of his time, as he was also a most generous patron of talent and learning.\n\nWas he, then, the man, the prince, in the early years of his delegated governorship, when he must have been most prudent and circumspect, most careful of all his words and actions, when Meys\u00fcn was newly united to him, and his only son Yez\u012bd was an infant, when all his powers of body and mind were at their prime, or in their early maturity; was he a man likely to take to himself, in the first place, as his wife, a raw, untutored child of the desert, and was the young lady he selected as his partner likely to have preserved in her mind so lively a preference for the desert life as to long for it in the midst of the splendour with which he doubtlessly surrounded her? Even had she been so, she was a mother as well as a wife and a great princess. Would she, then, be likely to look upon the grand, wise, brave, learned, generous, and generally beloved father of her infant son as a \u201cfoddered ass,\u201d or, taking Ziya Pasha\u2019s version, as a \u201ccoarse barbarian,\u201d \u201coutlandish miscreant,\u201d or \u201ctiresome lout\u201d? Spoiled, haughty, even enervated, he may have possibly grown in far later years; but at the time of his life in question he must have been in the constant habitual practice\nof all the noblest and most considerate punctilios natural to a rising prosperous statesman, trusted by his distant sovereign, loved by and relied on by those around and under him, respected or feared by his neighbours. \"Ass,\" \"barbarian,\" \"boor,\" \"clown,\" \"lout\" he certainly could not have been, save in the eyes of a sectarian or personal jealous enemy, and reckless vituperation.\n\nIs there not then, even on these considerations alone, a certain weight, a preponderating importance, to be attached to Ziya Pasha's marginal remark that the author of the verses attributed to Meysun is unknown? He most likely was well aware that they commonly pass as the production of the fretting petulancy of Yezid's talented but untamed mother, Mu'awiya's Bedewiyy wife. But, weighing the crucial expression of the poem, \"foddered ass\" or \"coarse barbarian,\" as has been done here, Ziya Pasha may well have concluded in his own mind that the case was \"not proven,\" as far as Meysun and Mu'awiya are concerned; and thereupon curtly recorded his conviction that the verses, though worth insertion in a miscellany, are the production of some unknown author. The words of the poem would far better suit the case of some recently captured and enslaved desert girl, held as his mistress by some \"coarse,\" unfeeling, well-to-do citizen or petty governor.\n\nA far more improbable detail in the story about the dismissal of Meysun by Mu'awiya when he chanced to overhear her singing her ditty, beyond the likelihood, even, that he should apply the offensive expression to himself, is that, on going away from him to join her own kin, she should be allowed by him to take his infant son Yezid, the sole hope of his line, with her, according to Sir R. Burton, \"to her cousins and beloved wilds,\" as Mrs. Clerk says, \"into the desert,\" but, as Dr. Carlyle more definitely puts it, \"to Yemen.\"\n\nNow Yezid appears, as has already been stated, to have\nbeen Mu\u02bfawiya's first and only child. He may possibly have had other offspring before his union with Meys\u016bn, and he may have begotten other children from other wives or concubines after her departure, if he really did dismiss her. But history makes no mention whatever of any such; and the first authentic notice of Yez\u012bd in active life, after his birth, that I know of, is the account of his being sent with the fleet and army that fruitlessly besieged Constantinople, after Mu\u02bfawiya had become sole caliph, and when Yez\u012bd was already eighteen years old; for his marriage at the age of sixteen is a mere computation backwards from the age of his son and successor, Mu\u02bfawiya II., at the date of his accession.\n\nLet us now contemplate the complexion of the times at and after Yez\u012bd's birth, in A.H. 26, until his father had become sole caliph, in A.H. 41, and his own marriage the year following, A.H. 42, at the age of sixteen, when he must have been at Damascus with his father.\n\nAt the very time of Yez\u012bd's birth, Mu\u02bfawiya was fitting out his first ships and personally conducting his maritime expeditions against Cyprus, the islands of Aradus, Rhodes, Malta, etc.; and it was nine years before the murder of \u02bfUthm\u0101n, in A.H. 35, called Mu\u02bfawiya to declare against \u02bfAliyy, and to become his competitor for the caliphate. If Yez\u012bd ever was allowed to leave Damascus with his mother, it must have been during a portion or the whole of the last seven or eight of those nine years.\n\nBut all the reported facts of Mu\u02bfawiya's life, including his maritime expeditions, besides the character that history has recorded of him for moderation, generosity, perseverance, and astuteness, seem to make it in the highest degree improbable that he should have sent away for so frivolous a cause the mother of his only son; much less that he should have allowed her to take that only son of his into the desert, and least of all to distant Yemen, fifteen hundred miles from Damascus.\nThe Arabian tribesmen are by no means all of them nomads. The great majority of them, on the contrary, are denizens of villages, towns and cities; agriculturists, manufacturers, tradesmen, merchants, soldiers, sailors, lawyers, professors of science, princes; and most of the members of all these classes are habitual warriors and natural poets. It is hardly possible, therefore, that Mu\u2018awiya, a chieftain among the Qureysh of Mekka, for five or six years an inhabitant of Medina, a confidant of Mu\u1e25ammed and of \u2019Eb\u016b-Bekr, successor designate to his own elder brother, Yezid the Good, and confirmed in the office of Governor-General of Syria by two caliphs, \u2018Umer and \u2018Uthm\u0101n, the patron of poets and of all kinds of learning, the organizer of armies and planner of fleets to be, should, after all these glories were his own, find no other partner in his greatness, no other mother for his anticipated line, than a nomad girl, still so little tamed, still so wildly wedded to desert life and its accompaniments, as to prefer its fancied freedom to the splendours and refinements of a great provincial court, and to the love and society of so eminent a man, so great a prince.\n\nMeys\u016bn, the daughter of Bahdel the Kelbite, may have been, in reality, every way worthy of her distinguished husband. She may have been, for aught we know, the daughter of a wild nomad chieftain, or even of a Bedewiyy commoner, free or slave, in Damascus. The caliph \u2018Aliyy, after the death of F\u0101\u1e6dima, had married the captive \u1e24anefiyya girl; and her son by \u2018Aliyy, Mu\u1e25ammed son of the \u1e24anefiyya, became as celebrated a man of learning and piety as either of his elder half-brothers. So may Meyas\u016bn have been, as nothing to the contrary is known, that I am aware of. But Mu\u2018awiya\u2019s character makes it far more likely that she was the beautiful child of a man of mark and cultivation, even if he were from Yemen.\n\nYemen was then, as it had been for many centuries, and as it continued for centuries afterwards, until ruined by\nEuropean enterprise passing to India and China, Persia, etc., round the Cape of Good Hope, the commercial centre of Arabia, the emporium where the rich products of the East, together with its own native drugs and manufactures, were bartered for such articles as the Roman world, Syria, Egypt, and Africa could bring to its marts. When 'Isl\u0101m roused the whole of the Arabian tribes, urban and rustic, to the conquest of half the known world, warriors from Yemen, Yem\u0101ma, and 'Um\u0101n, flocked to the standards, as well as the men of the Hijaz, as well as the desert nomads. They were accompanied by their wives, sisters, and daughters, in large numbers, as well as by their sons. History frequently testifies to this; and, as town after town, city after city, was captured from the Romans, garrisons and governors of Arabian blood were placed in them. These last would be the picked men of the nation, more generally townsfolk, men of learning and refinement, as well as brave warriors and subtle negociators. The rank and file would be peasantry; the nomads would generally be skirmishers, and avoid town life.\n\nColonies and families of the Kelbite race are met with in all parts, as conquest extended. Bahdel, Meys\u00fcn's reported father, may have been an officer, a subordinate governor, a merchant, a man of letters, a functionary of the new worship, a professor in a college, etc., as these were quickly founded. He may have been established in Damascus, in any of these capacities, before Mu'awiya returned there as governor-general. Meys\u00fcn may have been born in Damascus, or brought there an infant by her father and mother; for she married Mu'awiya twelve years after Damascus was taken. Her mother may have been a Roman or Syrian captive. Girls are married young in those parts, and mothers of twelve and thirteen are not uncommon. Admitting, then, for argument's sake, that Meys\u00fcn composed, or only sang, the ditty; admitting that Mu'awiya overheard her, applied the one offensive word to himself, grew angry in consequence, and\ninstantly dismissed her to her own people; admitting that she went, then and there, to her own family, her father's kith and kin, taking her infant son with her under Mu'awiya's sanction, and retaining him until he was of an age to do without her maternal care; it by no means follows that she went herself and took her child to the desert, still less to Yemen. She would most likely go to her father's house in Damascus; and Mu'awiya could consent to this, as he was now frequently absent in his naval expeditions. The child would still be under the supervision of any one he might appoint. His father could assure himself that Yezid was duly taken care of, properly tended in sickness (for he was attacked by smallpox at some unknown period of his life), properly schooled when of the requisite age, and recallable to his own guidance when he saw fit, or when danger loomed in the distance, as it did so soon as the tortuous policy of the caliph 'Uthm\u0101n raised troubles in Egypt first, and then at Medina, ending in his assassination in A.H. 35 (A.D. 655), when Yezid was nine years old. Now, if not before, Mu'awiya would assume the personal supervision of his son's training.\n\nIt is true that Mu\u1e25ammed himself, when a poor orphan-suckling after the death of his father, was given to a foster-mother of a stranger tribe, with whom he remained two years, until he was weaned; as most of the children of Mekka were so put out to nurse with rustic women of the neighbourhood, trusted by their parents. But the story of Meys\u016bn's being allowed by Mu'awiya to take Yezid into the desert or to Yemen from Damascus, so recently captured and occupied, is utterly incredible, as it would always be difficult or impossible to recall him when old enough, and equally impossible to watch over him if allowed to remain longer with his mother. It may, therefore, almost with certainty, be concluded that Ziy\u0101 Pasha gave a true and correct judgment when he recorded his marginal note to this little poem: \"By an unknown author.\" According as tastes vary, this\nsimple ditty may be pronounced sublime or commonplace, but that it was not indited or sung by Meys\u00fcn the mother of Yezid son of Mu'awiya, is a moral certainty, though sectarian or dynastic rancour has succeeded in commonly coupling her name with it.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nA study of the variously transliterated names connected with the so-called \"Poem of Meys\u00fcn,\" coupled with long-continued former tentatives on my part to elaborate a satisfactory system for the rational rendering of Arabic names, words, and sentences in English letters, as far as possible, has revived in me a desire to lay before the Council and Members of the Royal Asiatic Society a tolerably complete view of my present matured system, adapted to an approximatively correct scientific method of writing Arabic in our characters, so to say, as it is pronounced by professed reciters of the Qur'\u0101n, on the basis of the special science called 'Ilmu-'t-Tejw\u012bd \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0648\u064a\u062f, which may be translated Kalophonesis 'good enunciation.'\n\nThis definition of the system naturally excludes any consideration of the ever-varying local, provincial modes of pronouncing vernacular Arabic, as practised by nations inhabiting different parts of the extensive regions, from Arabia to Morocco, where that language is the mother-tongue; and still more so, forbids any reference to the variously modified methods of pronouncing Arabic words and names by East Indians, Malays, Persians, Turks, etc. Of Ottoman pronunciation I have fully treated in my Ottoman Grammar recently published by Tr\u00fcbner and Co.\n\nEach one of such provincial dialects of Arabic, and each one of such national adaptations of Arabian words and letters, would require a special treatise for its elucidation in a\nscientific manner, of which each would be perfectly capable in\nthe hands of a competent master. But when to these we add\nthe chaotic jumble resulting from attempts to transliterate the\nwhole of these modes of pronunciation by one unvarying\nsystem, or by hap-hazard, one is apt to sink down in despair.\nAs well might one essay to write all the languages of Europe\nwith our unmethodical English mode of spelling.\n\nBut confusion worse confounded is created by writers who,\nnot able to read the language, and casually visiting one or\nseveral of the Arabic-spoken countries, try their skill at\nportraying in English letters or books, and guided by their\nuntutored ear alone, not only what they fancy the provincial\nnatives utter, but also the vile composts that pass from\nmouth to mouth among ignorant laquais-de-place, self-styled\ninterpreters or dragomans, of many a nationality; and when\nto this ear-guidance of their own, they add a medley of\ncorrect or erroneous Arabic words or names copied from other\nwriters of some other nationality, the ne plus ultra is reached\nof puzzling empiricism. Our newspapers and periodicals,\neven our official correspondence, and our East-Indian com-\npositions, afford ample proof of this, which need not here be\nfurther dwelt upon.\n\nIt was a singular aberration of a highly-gifted mind, when\na rough and ready, though erroneous, rule had been enun-\nciated for such transliterations, viz. \"all consonants as in\nEnglish, and all vowels as in Italian,\" that a great scholar\nshould arise to teach English university men, and others, to\nforsake the horizontal straight stroke used over the long\nvowels of their school and college prosodial exercitations, and\nbid them adopt the right-to-left-downward sloping \"dash\" of\nthe French \u00e9 (e aigu), for the purpose of marking a long\nArabic (or other eastern) vowel; informing them at the\nsame time, forsooth, that this is the Italian method. The\nItalians have no such usage. They never mark their long\nvowels in any way whatever. What they really do is to\nmark with that accent, in dictionaries only, the vowel of that syllable of a word on which the stress falls; and never do they use it in ordinary books or in writing. But, when such vowel is final, with the stress on it, they mark it in print and in writing with a dash sloping down from left to right, the French accent grave; as in facolt\u00e0, appi\u00e8, cio \u00e8, oggid\u00ec, verr\u00f2, virt\u00f9, etc.\n\nIt amounts almost to a national sin, to a crime of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, when English scholars, men of truly profound learning, condescend, in English publications, to adopt the French method of transliteration;\u2014with its diphthongs, which do not exist in Arabic; with its accent circonflexe, ^, unknown in English, to mark the Arabic long vowels; with their erroneous o instead of the Italian u; and with their erroneous e in place of the Italian i. There is no vowel o in the whole Arabic language; though the consonant-ended combination j, aw or ew (as the word or syllable is hard or soft) is vernacularly uttered by provincials in such a way that unaccustomed foreign ears take it for a vowel o. Still, this is a different thing to the systematic misrepresentation of the Arabic vowel u, which, short or long, is always pure, as in Italian. It must have been originally given to Jewish teachers of Arabic from Spain, whose pronunciation always has been abominable in every respect, to mislead Italian students in the middle ages, and make them sound the dzamma vowel as an o; and it is full time that so pernicious a practice were discontinued, both here and on the continent. The e instead of Italian i, above spoken of, has no basis whatever, except perversely erroneous and general French usage. The \"accent circonflexe\" of French orthography has a special history of its own, quite different from that of a true long vowel; but, as their writers have chosen to make this accent the sign of an Arabic long vowel, we need not complain, for we are under no compulsion to adopt their unscientific makeshift. To mark an Arabic long vowel in a\nthoroughly English and scholarlike manner, we have our well-known legitimate, prosodial symbol, \u00af, straight and horizontal; though, unfortunately, I know of no technical name for it. How much more English and scholarly, how much better and more correct, to transliterate K\u0101tib, than to pervert this into K\u0101teb, or into K\u0101tib.\n\nAs was remarked above, there are no diphthongs whatever in the Arabic language (nor, indeed, truly, in any language). What are erroneously styled Arabic diphthongs, namely, a fet-ha vowel, \u00b4, followed by a consonantal w\u0101w, or y\u0101\u02be, final to the syllable, are no more diphthongs than are ab, eb, ad, ed, etc. The French, denying that final y is ever a consonant, and having no w\u0101w in their alphabet, attempt to figure the words \u0642\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064c qawl, \u0642\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064c qayn, \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c yowm, \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064c beyn, by the monstrosities kaoul, kain, iaoum, bein, etc.\n\nAnother Arabic combination of an altogether different nature, but also, quite erroneously, denominated a diphthong by many, is where two vowels, belonging to two successive syllables in a word, are brought by transliteration into forced juxtaposition, through the incorrect elision, owing to our alphabetical deficiency, and lack of equivalents for the two Arabic consonants, hemza \u00b4, and \u2018ayn \u02bf. These two letters, \u00b4 and \u02bf, are as truly and as efficiently consonants, as are all the letters of the Arabic alphabet in their primary values. They both represent, to European ears, a kind of hiatus or gulp where they occur, the hemza being soft, something in the nature of our diacresis or trema, while the \u02bf is very harsh and gulpy, totally unknown to us. They are, therefore, true, efficient consonants, though we may be unable to articulate them. They are, both of them, capable of reduplication in the pronunciation and grammar of a derived word, exactly like all other consonants; as in \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e tef\u0101\u02beala, \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e tef\u0101\u02bfala; and they may be conveniently transliterated by two distinct modifications of our ordinary apostrophe reversed, one turned\nto the left, the other to the right. The apostrophe is wanted in transliterating Arabic compound names and clauses, to represent a different incident that befalls some letters initial to words. Three signs of elision are therefore used in the present or proposed system, the ordinary apostrophe, ', indicating the omission of an initial letter in pronunciation; the inverted apostrophe turned to the left, ', showing the place of a consonant which we do not possess in our alphabet, the hemza; and the inverted apostrophe turned to the right, ', to represent the harsh consonant 'ayn, which also our alphabet does not contain. All three are perfectly distinct; each represents a distinct Arabic letter; and retransliteration back into Arabic characters is kept free from all doubt. For, any system of transliteration, to be considered perfect, must represent unmistakably to the eye of the scholar the original letters, while it enables a reader who is unacquainted with the written characters of the original text, to read the words with a fair approximation to correctness, with a little practice. It is a lamentable error, propagated in our Hebrew grammars to the effect that the Hebrew equivalents to the Arabic \u064e and \u0650, namely \u064e and \u0650, have no value, and go for nothing, etc. In ordinary books and newspapers, the apostrophe might be used for all three purposes; though the two inverted forms of it would always be preferable, in their respective places.\n\nAs is well known, the three Arabic short vowels are usually omitted in ordinary print and handwriting, having to be supplied in reading and speaking by the person who reads or speaks. He must know what vowels are omitted, or he cannot read; and of course he cannot converse unless he knows the vowels of his words. But in books used by learners, and in copies of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, etc., the vowels are marked, in whole or in part. They are called collectively kareka \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0629 \u2018movement, motion\u2019; by us, \u201cvowel-points.\u201d The three are, respectively, named fet-ha \u0641\u064e\u062a\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0629, keera \u0643\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u0629, and dzamma \u062f\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629, which names mean, in their order, an\n\"opening,\" a \"breaking,\" a \"folding\"; and their marks are the following: \u064e, \u0650, \u064f. Their values are, respectively, a or e, i, u, as is more fully explained further on; thus: \u0645\u064e\u062a\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0643\u064c mutaharrik, \u0645\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0642\u064c mutasanwif, \u0645\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0643\u064c muteberrik, \u0645\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064c mutesellim. The vowels that, in theoretic grammar, follow the final consonant of a word, whether they be the mark of a case in nouns, or of a result of conjugation in a verb, are generally omitted in the vernacular; and when the word stands alone, or is final in a sentence, they are omitted even in reading the Qur\u02be\u0101n, subject to rules that are beside our present subject.\n\nThe three Arabic \"long\" vowels that correspond with the three \"short\" ones mentioned above are the three letters (consonants in all other circumstances): \u0627, \u064a, \u0648, then called \"letters of prolongation,\" hur\u016bfu 'l-medd \u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u0651 (sing., harfu 'l-medd \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u0651). They are also said to be \"prolonged,\" memdud \u0645\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064c; thus, long \u0627 is called 'elif memduda \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064d; long \u064a is ya memduda\u060c \u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064c; and long \u0648 is n\u0101n memduda\u060c \u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064c. To become a long vowel, however, each of these three letters, otherwise consonants, must immediately follow the homogeneous short vowel-points; \u0627 must follow fet-ha, \u064a must follow kesra, and \u0648 must follow dzamma; as in \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064f b\u0101b, \u0628\u0650\u0636\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f bid\u02bfat h\u016br.\n\nWhenever letter \u0627 is a consonant, it is usually marked in writing by a hemza sign being placed over it, \u0623. It is then named hemza-'elif, hemz-'elif, or simply, for brevity, hemza. Consonantal 'elif is really one and the same thing with hemza, and in certain cases is written as hemza alone, without a letter \u0627 as its support, as in \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e ja\u02bea, \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e sh\u0101\u02bea, etc.\n\nBut this consonantal \u0627, this hemza, is capable, like every other consonant, of taking every one of the three vowels, short and long, after it in pronunciation; as it is also capable, like them, of being quiescent (as it is called); i.e. of being vowelless, and of thus ending a syllable. The subject of the\nvarious conditions of hemza, or consonantal 'elif, is somewhat intricate, as is shown in the following paragraphs.\n\n1. When hemza is initial to an ordinary word (i.e. when it is not a hemza of junction, which see further on), and is followed by any one of the three short vowels, it always keeps the one, unchanging written form, like every other consonant. Thus, \u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u064f 'ardz, \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f 'elem, \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 'in, \u0623\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0646\u064f 'ins\u0101n, \u0623\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064f u\u1e63ul. With kesra vowel, the hemza sign is more generally placed, with the vowel-point, below the l; as \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c, etc.\n\n2. When hemza is initial to an ordinary word, but is followed by a long vowel, it still follows the foregoing rule of no change in its written form, so long as the vowel is heterogeneous to the hemza; i.e. when the vowel is either kesra or dzamma, as in \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f 'ir\u0101d, \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0649 'ula. But, with the homogeneous long vowel, the two letters, consonantal initial l, and long-vowel l, coalesce into one sole letter l; and this one l is then marked in writing with a special symbol, ~, called medd \u0645\u064e\u062f\u0651, or medda \u0645\u062f\u0651 (\"prolongation\"); generally without, but sometimes, optionally, with the hemza sign; thus, \u0644\u064e\u0622 or \u0644\u064e\u0622 stands for \u0644\u064e\u0622\u0646\u0652, and is transliterated '\u0101l.\n\n3. When l is not initial to a word, other rules have to be observed. It may then be either movent or quiescent, i.e. followed or not, accompanied or not, by its own vowel in pronunciation; and this is tantamount to saying, in other words, that non-initial l may either begin or end a non-initial syllable in a word (exactly like every other consonant). Its rules in these cases vary greatly.\n\n4. When l, non-initial to a word, is initial to a syllable, whether its own vowel be short or long, we have to take notice of the vowel that accompanies the consonant preceding the l in the word, as well as its own vowel.\n\n5. If that preceding vowel, as well as its own, be the homogeneous short fet-ha \ufd3f, then l suffers no change in\nits written form. Thus, the'era, je'esha, re'esa, etc. But if its own homogeneous vowel be long \u0101, after a preceding short fet-ha, then \u0101 is written instead of \u0101; thus, sa'a'fa, ma'al, etc.\n\n6. If non-initial hemza be preceded in the word by a heterogeneous short vowel, kesra or dzamma, its own vowel still continuing homogeneous and short, the \u0101 undergoes a corresponding change in its written form, and becomes \u0101 after kesra, and \u0101 after dzamma; as, ri'a, ti'a, m'ia, thu'eba', ju'er, ru'es\u0101', etc.\n\n7. If, in such case, its own vowel be long, it then takes itself one or other of the two forms given in the preceding paragraph, but is followed by that one of the three long-vowel letters, \u0101, \u0101, which is homogeneous with its own long vowel; thus ri'asa, ri'iyy, ri's, ri'un, ju'ar, dhu'aba, ru'a', thu'ura, etc.; and \u0101 is sometimes written \u0101; as, 'irti'as ('ri'tas).\n\n8. And if the hemza's vowel in such case be short, and the preceding vowel be short fet-ha, it still changes its written form as above; thus, be'isa, be'usa, dhe'iba, dhe'uba, re'ifa, re'ufa, etc.\n\n9. If the preceding vowel be short fet-ha, while its own vowel be long and heterogeneous, the change in written form occurs as above, but the long-vowel letter is added; as, te'im, re'is, de'ub, re'uf, etc. The second, is often, perhaps mistakenly, omitted in writing and printing such words as these last two, even in copies of the Qur'an, from reverence for ancient use.\n\n10. If the preceding vowel be long fet-ha \u0101, and the hemza's vowel be short, it takes the written form of \u0101, \u0101 or \u0101, according to which vowel belongs to it; and the \u0101 of the preceding long vowel is marked with the medd sign \u0101; thus, teb'a'esa, tef'a'ela, mu'a'em,\nmuteb\u0101'is, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0639\u064c mutefa'il, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0651\u0639\u064c muta'im, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0622\u0645\u064c mur\u0101'il\nmudh\u0101'ir, \u0645\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u0631\u064c th\u0101'ir, \u062b\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c r\u0101'if, \u0631\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0641\u064c z\u0101'ir, \u0632\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c q\u0101'il, \u0642\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064c\nteba'us, \u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0633\u064c tefa'ul, etc. In this last case, \u0627\u0644\u0652, the vowel is sometimes long, as in \u0632\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c z\u0101'ul. In some of such words the hemza is radical, as in \u0631\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0641\u064c r\u0101'if, etc.; in others it is servile and formative, as in \u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0645\u064c bah\u0101'im, etc.; and in others again it is a commutative substitute for a radical consonant \u064a or \u0648, as in \u0632\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c z\u0101'ir, \u0633\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c sa'ir q\u0101'il, etc. This is a very difficult part of Arabic grammar.\n\n11. There are some, comparatively few, words in which \u0623 is the second radical, and has short kesra, \u0643\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064d, for its vowel, while it is preceded by a short dzamma vowel \u0630\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064d. It does not then conform in writing to that preceding vowel, but is written \u0623; thus, \u062f\u064f\u0639\u064e\u0649 du'il, \u0630\u064f\u0639\u064e\u0649 dhu'iba, \u0633\u064f\u0639\u064e\u0649 su'il'a, etc.\n\n12. Non-initial hemza in a word, when initial to a syllable, may be immediately preceded by a quiescent consonant, marked in writing, when necessary, with the jezm \u062c\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0645\u064c sign over it \u062c\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0645\u064c, which is also called sukun \u0633\u064f\u0643\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064c; the quiescent consonant then ends the preceding syllable of the word. The hemza, in such case, figures, in writing, as \u0623, \u064a, or \u0621, according to its own vowel, if short; thus, \u062c\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0621\u064e\u064a\u0652 jey'ela, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064c mut'im, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064c mur'il'a; \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064c 'eb'ur, \u0625\u0650\u062c\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0645\u064c ej um, \u0625\u0650\u062f\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064c ed'ur, etc.; or as \u0623, \u064a, \u0648, if its own vowel be long; thus, \u0645\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0622\u0645\u064c mit'am, \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0633\u064c ter'as, \u0645\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0622\u0628\u064c meth'\u0101b, etc. But \u0645\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064c and \u0645\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064c are sometimes found written for \u0645\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064c mes'ul.\n\n13. When medial (non-initial) hemza, being the second radical in a derivative word, is reduplicated, exactly in the same way with any other consonant of the alphabet, it ends one syllable, and also begins the next. It then still follows, in writing, the rules given above, whether its vowel in the second of those two syllables be short or long. Thus, \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064c tefe'ela, \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064c tefe'ul, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0651\u0639\u064c mutefe'il, \u0645\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u0631\u064c mudhe'ib, \u062c\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0628\u064c ja'ab, \u062c\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c ja'ar, etc.\n14. When medial hemza, not being reduplicated, ends a syllable, its written form depends entirely on the vowel of the syllable it ends, being written \u0650 after fet-ha, \u0650 after kesra, and \u064f after dzamma. Thus, \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0633\u064e be's, \u062f\u064e\u0628\u064e de'b, \u062b\u064e\u0631\u064e the'r, \u062c\u064e\u0634\u064e je'sh, \u062b\u064e\u0631\u064e the'ra, \u0631\u064e\u0641\u064e re'fa; \u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e bi'r, \u0628\u064e\u0633\u064e bi'sa, \u062f\u064e\u0628\u064e dhi'b, \u0646\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e dhi'b\u0101n, \u0644\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e ri'lan, \u0632\u064e\u0628\u064e zi'baq; \u0628\u064f\u0633\u064e bu's, \u062b\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e thu'lal, \u0631\u064e\u064a\u064e ru'ya, \u0644\u064f\u0648\u064f lu'lu', \u0646\u064f\u0648\u064f dhu'nun, etc.\n\n15. When hemza is final in a word, it must form a syllable by itself with its own short vowel (or case-ending nunnation, \u0650, \u0650, or \u0650). It may then follow, either a quiescent consonant, or a consonant accompanied by its following short or long vowel. Thus, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e bed', \u062f\u064e\u0641\u064e dif', \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e juz', \u062f\u064e\u0641\u064e def', \u062f\u064e\u0641\u064e def'u'a, \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e jez'a, \u062f\u064e\u0641\u064e def'i, \u0645\u064e\u062c\u064e mez'u', etc. The transliterations here given, exclusive of the case-endings, show how the words are pronounced when they stand alone, or come before a full stop in a phrase or sentence. The oblique cases, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e bed'in, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e bed'i, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e bed'an, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e bed'a, need but to be mentioned without detail, as there is nothing else to separate them from the other final consonants.\n\n16. At the beginning of certain well-defined words only, initial hemza, when any one of those words follows any other word in a phrase or sentence, becomes elided in pronunciation alone, being still written. It is then called the 'elif of junction, \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0644\u0650 'elifu 'l-wa\u1e63l; and is marked with a special sign, \u0650, called wa\u1e63la \u0648\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064b, placed over it thus, \u0650. The words in question are of four classes; viz. 1, the definite article \u0644\u064e alone; 2, the ten following nouns: \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, and \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e; 3, the imperatives regular of verbs of the first or primitive form; and 4, every word of the seventh and following derivative forms of verbs that begin with hemza, with the exception of the first person singular of the aorist tenses.\nIn transliterations of all these words, our apostrophe is the fitting sign of such elision.\n\n17. But, with regard to the definite article and this elision of its hemza when not initial in a sentence or solitary word, the further observation is needed that, in this respect, the Arabic alphabet of twenty-eight letters is divided equally into two classes of fourteen letters each, denominated respectively the \"lunar\" and the \"solar\" letters; because the words \u0642\u0645\u0631 qamer (the moon), and \u0634\u0645\u0633 shems (the sun) have their initial letters in the two classes respectively. The lunar letters, \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f 'el hur\u016bfu 'l-qameriyya, are, \ufe83, \u0628, \u062c, \u062d, \u062e, \u062f, \u0630, \u0631, \u0632, \u0633, \u0634, \u0635, \u0636, \u0638, \u063a, \u0641, \u0642, \u0643, \u0644, \u0645, \u0646, \u0647, \u0648, \u064a; while the solar letters, \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f 'el hur\u016bfu 'sh-shemsiyya, are, \u062a, \u062b, \u062c, \u062d, \u062e, \u062f, \u0630, \u0631, \u0632, \u0633, \u0634, \u0635, \u0636, \u0638, \u063a, \u0641, \u0642, \u0643, \u0644, \u0645, \u0646, \u0647, \u0648, \u064a. The difference seen above in the two class-names is that when a noun, the initial of which is a lunar letter, \u062e\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064f \u0642\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 harfun qameriy, is shown to be definite by the article that precedes it, no further change occurs in the group beyond the simple elision of the initial \u062a of that article in its pronunciation; thus, \u0642\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c q\u0101la 'l-b\u0101b, \u062f\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c daqqa 'l-b\u0101b, \u062e\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0641\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c khasfa 'l-qamer, etc.; but, when the initial letter of the noun is a solar letter, \u062e\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064f \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 harfun shemsiyy, then, not only does the elision of the initial \u062a of the article take place as before, but the \u0644 also of that article is transformed, in pronunciation, though not in writing, into the initial solar letter of the noun, which is then marked by the sign of reduplication \ufeed, the jezm sign \ufea9 of the \u0644 disappears in writing, and the wasla sign \ufea9 is extended (in handwritings only, not in print) so as to cover the whole article \u0644; thus, \u0642\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c q\u0101la 'r-restal, \u0634\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c shagga 'th-thewb, \u062e\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0641\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c kesefa 'sh-shems, etc.\n\n18. A penultimate long vowel in any Arabic word must\nbe followed by a consonant with its short vowel, or its nunnation; and this consonant may be hemza, radical or servile, as well as any other of the letters of the alphabet, all of which are consonants originally. Thus, \u0628\u0627\u0628 b\u0101b, \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e q\u0101la, \u062a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e q\u012bla, \u0633\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064c s\u016br, \u062f\u064e\u0622\u0621\u064e d\u0101\u02be, \u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e hamr\u0101\u02be, \u062c\u064e\u0622\u0621\u064e j\u0101\u02bea, \u062c\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064e j\u012bt, \u0645\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0639\u064e mebd\u016b\u02bf, etc.\n\n19. Final short-vowel radical or commutative l occurs in many words; as \u0644\u064e la, \u0645\u064e\u0627 ma, \u063a\u064e\u0632\u0627 gaza, etc. It should never be marked with a grave accent in transliteration. But there is a final short-vowel servile \u0101 in Arabic, originally written with \u064a preceded by fet-ha, and then termed \"shortened\" \u0644\u0650, \u2019elif maq\u1e63\u016bra \u0644\u0650, which should be so marked with the grave accent in transliteration, because it bears the stress or accent of the word; as \u0628\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649 bushr\u0101, \u0628\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0649 hubl\u0101, \u0647\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629 husn\u0101, \u0637\u064f\u0648\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0629 \u1e6dub\u0101, etc. This is the real, true Italian method of marking the final short vowel of a word, when the stress falls on such final short vowel. But, when this short vowel \u064a, pronounced \u0101, ceases to be final to the eye in writing, and to the ear in pronunciation, by reason of a pronominal suffix or a \u0629 of unity or femininity being added after it in the word, then the vowel is written in Arabic with \u0644, and no longer with \u064a. It cannot, then, by mere inspection or audition, be distinguished from the final radical l above mentioned; and this is probably the reason why it is called \u2019elif maq\u1e63\u016bra; thus, \u0628\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e bushr\u0101-hu, \u0628\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e bushr\u0101-h\u0101, \u0628\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e bushr\u0101-ya, \u0628\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e bushr\u0101-ka, etc.; \u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0621\u064e ham\u0101\u02be, \u062d\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e has\u0101\u02be; etc.\n\nShort final vowel \u064a after kesra is elided in ordinary writing or print, when the word is an indefinite noun; but is written when the noun becomes definite; as \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0636\u0650\u064a q\u0101\u1e0dzi, \u2019el-q\u0101\u1e0dzi, \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a \u02bf\u0101li, and \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a \u02bfal\u0101\u02bei, etc. It is omitted at the end of a few well-known definite words, exceptionally; as \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650 for \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650, \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a for \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a, \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a for \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a, etc.\nShort-vowel final , is perhaps not met with; for \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064f\u0651 dhu, probably, and the apocopated regular plural nominatives, certainly, as, \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0648\u064f\u0651, etc., end in long-vowel \u0648\u064f'.\n\nThe third person plural masculine of preterite verbs regular, and some persons plural masculine of subjunctive and conditional aorist verbs, as well as the imperative plural, also end in long-vowel \u0648\u064f'; but, when such verbs are not followed by a pronominal suffix, the \u0648\u064f' has a silent l added after it in writing; thus, \u0643\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e ketebu, \u0643\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e hu ketebu-hu, etc.\n\nThe foregoing remarks may be regarded as fairly sufficient, if not exhaustive, for the subject of the Arabic short and long vowels, as also of the hemza consonant. This appendix is not an Arabic grammar. It may, however, be usefully added as a fundamental axiom of the Arabic written and spoken language, that no Arabic word or syllable can really begin with a vowel, whatever European ears and minds may think; for, the initial hemza of a word or syllable is always a consonant, and represents the gentle but perceptible opening of the vocal passage. The \u063a, the hard or harsh analogue of the soft, gentle hemza, represents the strong, guttural hiatus or gulp of such opening or closing; and initial \u0633 or \u0648, in word or syllable, is always a consonant, y or w.\n\nBefore leaving the question of the Arabic vowels, it is essential to press home the conviction of the utter erroneousness, the mischievous misleadingness of the system adopted by our transliterators, that of using the combinations ah or eh to represent the Arabic feminine termination of nouns, which is, in fact, a consonant letter t \u0629, and not a letter h \u0621, at all. What has led to this serious European mistake, servilely adopted by so many unreflecting English scholars of incontestable merit, is that when a full stop follows such feminine noun,\u2014and every isolated word is naturally followed by such full-stop,\u2014its final \u0629, called \u0629\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0651\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0627 ta'a 't-te'nit'h, t of femininity, as well as its case-vowel, disappears\nfrom the pronunciation. Thus, kelbetun, kelbetin, kelbetan, kelbetu, kelbeti, kelbeta, are then all equally pronounced kelba. But this pronunciation might quite as well be written ; only, this , with the vowel-points marked, is not differentiated in any respect from the objective definite of the masculine ; and for this reason alone, as in the parallel case of the termination in plural verbs, a difference of terminal form, spoken and written, was devised, to show the feminine noun without its distinctive final , when the word was followed by a full stop. That spoken form was, as said above, to drop the feminine and its case-vowel, saying, for instance, kelba. The written form was, to drop the dots, the diacritical points, of the final feminine , which thus became, in form, a ; mimicking the soft aspirate when written, but never pronounced as one. A final soft aspirate s is always a radical letter, whereas a final feminine , and its undotted representative, unaspirated s, is always a servile formative letter. A knowledge of grammar enables one to distinguish between such feminine nouns and words really ending with radical, aspirated s. This last is, and always should be, as scrupulously and as audibly aspirated at the end of a word, in Arabic, as at the beginning or in the middle; exactly as is the case with its hard or harsh analogue h. Thus, hubub, hubur; reht, ruhm; tenbih, taqbih, etc. But the undotted s, standing really for servile at the end of a feminine noun, is never aspirated; and, as it is always preceded by a fet-ha vowel accompanying a preceding consonant in the same, final syllable of the word, it has come in course of time, if not from all antiquity, to be the outward and visible sign of a final unmarked fet-ha vowel in a feminine noun. It is, virtually, a fourth Arabic vowel letter, used in Arabic at the end of feminine nouns only; as, bereka, birka,\nturba, fur\u1e63a, Med\u012bna, Mekka, Jidda, \u1e24udayda, Fa\u1e6d\u012bma, Khad\u012bja, etc. This peculiar use of final (virtually) vowel \\( \\varepsilon \\) may be compared to the French usage of not pronouncing the final consonant or consonants of most words, when not followed by an initial vowel in the next word of the phrase or sentence, as in \"c'est lui,\" compared with \"c'est \u00e0 lui,\" etc. Europeans are misled by the similarly erroneous transliteration of feminine Hebrew Biblical names, such as Rebekah, and the like; but the true origin and value of the (virtually-vowel) final feminine \\( \\varepsilon \\) for \\( \\iota \\), and its not being an aspirate, is correctly set forth in the present paragraph; and thus comes to a close the discussion of the Arabic vowels.\n\nThe consonants, that is, all the letters, of the Arabic alphabet, twenty-eight in number, have their isolated written forms, and their values, as nearly as our letters and combinations of letters (never more than two letters in one combination) can represent them, as follows:\n\n\\( \\begin{array}{ll}\n\u0623 & \\varepsilon \\\\\n\u0628 & \u0628 \\\\\n\u062a & \u062a \\\\\n\u062b & \u062b \\\\\n\u062c & \u062c \\\\\n\u062d & \u062d \\\\\n\u062e & \u062e \\\\\n\u062f & \u062f \\\\\n\u0630 & \u0630 \\\\\n\u0631 & \u0631 \\\\\n\u0632 & \u0632 \\\\\n\u0633 & \u0633 \\\\\n\u0634 & \u0634 \\\\\n\u0635 & \u0635 \\\\\n\u0636 & \u0636 \\\\\n\u0637 & \u0637 \\\\\n\u0638 & \u0638 \\\\\n\u0639 & \u0639 \\\\\n\u063a & \u063a \\\\\n\u0641 & \u0641 \\\\\n\u0642 & \u0642 \\\\\n\u0643 & \u0643 \\\\\n\u0644 & \u0644 \\\\\n\u0645 & \u0645 \\\\\n\u0646 & \u0646 \\\\\n\u0648 & \u0648 \\\\\n\u0647 & \u0647 \\\\\n\u064a & \u064a \\\\\n\\end{array} \\)\n\nAs may be readily seen above, seventeen out of the twenty-eight Arabic consonants have letters in our English alphabet that exactly correspond with them in value, viz. \\( \\begin{array}{ll}\n\u0628 & b \\\\\n\u062a & t \\\\\n\u062b & th \\\\\n\u062c & j \\\\\n\u062d & h \\\\\n\u062e & kh \\\\\n\u062f & d \\\\\n\u0630 & dh \\\\\n\u0631 & r \\\\\n\u0632 & z \\\\\n\u0633 & s \\\\\n\u0634 & sh \\\\\n\u0635 & sc \\\\\n\u0636 & dz \\\\\n\u0637 & t \\\\\n\u0638 & ts \\\\\n\u0639 & u \\\\\n\u063a & g \\\\\n\u0641 & f \\\\\n\u0642 & q \\\\\n\u0643 & k \\\\\n\u0644 & l \\\\\n\u0645 & m \\\\\n\u0646 & n \\\\\n\u0648 & w \\\\\n\u0647 & h \\\\\n\u064a & y \\\\\n\\end{array} \\)\n\nNone of these require any mark to distinguish them from others; but it may be here noticed that \\( \\begin{array}{ll}\n\u062c & j \\\\\n\\end{array} \\) is pronounced like hard \\( g \\) in Egypt; that \\( \\begin{array}{ll}\n\u063a & g \\\\\n\\end{array} \\) varies in pronunciation, softer or harder, and in a peculiar manner, in different places, and is frequently, but needlessly, represented by \\( gh \\); and that \\( \\begin{array}{ll}\n\u0642 & q \\\\\n\\end{array} \\) also varies in special ways. Those special peculiarities can only be learnt by ear, like our own\nprovincialisms. The \u0642 q, again, is by some still, and was, formerly, by all, written with a k in transliterations, and later on, was distinguished from the \u0643, also shown by a k, by having a dot placed under it, k. But the very Arabic letter \u0642, as well as both our capital and small letters Q, q, are but modified forms of one original Phenician, old Hebrew, or old Arabic letter, whence old Greek \u03a9 and Latin Q, q. It never was pronounced by Semitics with the same organ as the k, also directly derived from the Phenician; but the Greeks were the first to confuse q and k, as they confused almost every letter of the primitive alphabet; much more so than did the Etruscans and Latins. Some writers use our c to represent \u0642; but our c is the descendant, as is the Arabic \u062c, and the Greek \u0393, of the Phenician. It is therefore erroneous so to use a c, and as we now know the filiation of our letters, as well as that of the Semitic characters, our scholars are gradually becoming unanimous in the use of q to represent \u0642, without putting the needless u after it. Thus we write \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644 q\u0101bil, \u0642\u0628\u0648\u0644 qabul, \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 qir\u0101t, \u0642\u0631\u0628 qireb, \u0645\u0642\u0648\u0644 maq\u016bl, \u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 qur\u02be\u0101n, etc.\n\nOf the eleven remaining Arabic consonants, three, \u062d h, \u0635 s, \u0637 t, are distinguished, in transliteration, from three of the foregoing seventeen, by a short stroke placed under them. Hitherto a dot has been used for this purpose; but as it is frequently very indistinct, a bold short stroke is preferable, both for print and for handwriting; especially as a long stroke is used for the letters of the class here following, as also to mark the long vowels, as explained above, when put over them.\n\nOf the eight Arabic letters now left for explanation, our alphabet offers no equivalent single character. But our th and sh give a combination, each, that exactly represents the value of one Arabic letter, viz. \u062b th, \u0634 sh. There is a difficulty about our th. It has in our language two values,\nsoft in *thee*, sharp in *three*. The latter alone is the value of the Arabic \u062b; as in \u062b\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0628 thenb, \u0645\u0650\u062b\u0652\u0644 mithl, \u0628\u064e\u062b\u0652 bethth. We are therefore driven, in order to avoid doubt and ambiguity in transliterating, to adopt the modification *dh* to represent our value of *th* in *thee*, etc., which is the power of the Arabic \u0630 (a modified \u062f d); thus, \u0630\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627 dh\u0101ka, \u0630\u0650\u0628\u0652 dhi'b, \u0630\u064f\u0628\u0652 dhu'aba. Fitting examples of the power and transliteration of \u0634 are found in \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0634 shems, \u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a\u062f teshdid, \u062d\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0634 hashish. It may be useful here to point out that \u062b is, in some parts, provincially sounded like s, and in other parts like t; while \u0630 is here sounded like d, there like z, just as French tyros sound our *th*.\n\nThree Arabic letters, again, \u062e kh, \u0636 dz, \u0638 ts, have no English equivalents in single or double letters, though we can manage to represent them in transliterations. The value of \u062e kh can be learnt from a Scotchman when he says *loch*, or from a German when he says *ach*. The reason for not taking ch to represent \u062e is, that ch is, in French, equivalent to our sh and German sch; also, that our ch, the equivalent of French and English tch, as of German tsch, is a useful representative of Sanskrit, Persian, and Turkish letters which do not exist in Arabic. But, the student must never pronounce \u062e kh as k, though this is natural in ordinary English and French readers. Until the correct sound is learnt, it would be far better to pronounce h, and not k, in such words as \u062e\u064f\u0631\u064f\u062c khuruj, \u062e\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0652\u062e kharij, \u0641\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631 fakhr, \u0641\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631 f\u0101khir, \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062e selkh, etc. (pron. huruj, harij, fahr, f\u0101hir, selh).\n\nThe \u0636 dz is sounded as a d in some parts, and as a z in others. But it is the most characteristic letter in the Arabic language. A good professional or amateur reciter of the Qur\u02be\u0101n is as proud of his perfect pronunciation of this letter \u0636, as is a Parisian of his r grasseye or as an Englishman of his accuracy in sounding such a medley as \u201cthough thou think the thing thine, this threefold thong thrown through\nthe throng shall thoroughly thwart thee.\" Hence, qadz\u0101', q\u0101dzi, qabdz, fadzl, dzabt, dzabit, madzbut.\n\nThe \u0638, frequently sounded provincially as a very hard z, is, perhaps, the most disputable letter, as to its correct sound, of the whole Arabic alphabet. It is a sibilant modification of \u0637, and ts is the only possible value. Thus, tsulm, ts\u0101lim, matz\u016bm, natsar, n\u0101tsir, mants\u016br, hatsts, mahts\u016bts.\n\nAll these six double consonant combinations for one Arabic letter each must carefully be marked with a long line under them, because, in Arabic words, the single letters composing them frequently occur separately in succession, and must be pronounced independently.\n\nThere now remain the hemza \u0621\u060c \u0623\u060c \u0624\u060c \u0621\u060c already sufficiently enlarged on, and the \u2018ayn \u0639\u060c also mentioned above, for which no English letter or combination of letters, is available. As was said before, they both represent the hiatus that introduces a vowel, or separates two vowels, in a word, by opening or modifying the aperture of the vocal passage, and thus beginning a syllable without the aid of an ordinary consonant or aspiration; and also the hiatus that closes a syllable after a vowel without such aid of an ordinary consonant or aspiration; the hemza being soft and gentle, the \u2018ayn being harsh and deeply guttural. To represent such hiatus without a letter in transliterations, the reversed apostrophes, ' for hemza, ' for \u2018ayn, appear the most appropriate symbols, as they efficiently separate two following vowels in two following syllables of a word, by beginning the second syllable, as they open or close any syllable, and also admit of reduplication when required. Thus, \u2018emr, \u2018emir, \u2018\u0101mir, me\u2019m\u016br, re\u2019\u0101s; \u2018umr, \u2018\u0101mir, ma\u2019m\u016br, fa\u2018\u0101l.\nTwo passing remarks, even three to an Englishman, may be useful. 1. In Arabic writing, two separate letters never combine to form such combinations as our ch, tch, sh, ph, rh, th, or as French dj, or as German ch, sch, dsch, tsch, etc. But, on the other hand, juxtapositions occur commonly that are unknown in our tongue; such as \u0636\u062d sub-h, \u0641\u062a\u062d fet-h, \u0642\u0633\u062d fes-h, \u0642\u064a\u062f gid-h, \u0643\u0646 kun-h, \u0646\u064a\u0628 nebih, \u062a\u0646\u0628\u064a\u0647 tenbih, \u0645\u062a\u0646\u0628\u064a\u0647 mutenebbih, \u0623\u0628\u0644\u0647 'ebleh, etc. 2. In Arabic, an aspirate must always be aspirated, wherever placed in a word, whether as an initial, as a medial, or as a final. The preceding words are instances of final aspirates, and they may be reduplicated when medial or final, like any other consonant; thus, \u0645\u0634\u062d mu\u1e63ahhih, \u0645\u0634\u062d\u0629 mu\u1e63ahha\u1e25, \u0635\u062d\u0627\u0641 sa\u1e25\u1e25af, \u0645\u0643\u062d\u0644 mukhal\u1e25el, \u0643\u062d\u0644 ke\u1e25hal. Initial and simple medial aspirates abound; as, \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0628 haq\u012bb, \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 hik\u0101ya, \u0647\u062f\u0645 hedm, \u0647\u0627\u062f\u0632\u0645 h\u0101dzim, \u0633\u0627\u062d sa\u1e25b, \u0633\u0647\u0645 sehlm, \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 s\u0101\u1e25ib, \u0634\u064a\u0644 sehil, \u0645\u0635\u0648\u0628 mas-hub, etc. Whenever an aspirate occurs in a transliteration so as to be preceded in the word by a consonant that, in English, would make a combination having the value of a single Arabic letter, the aspirate should, by way of precaution, be separated from the other consonant by a hyphen, to mark that they belong grammatically to two syllables. Several examples are seen above. 3. An Englishman should never allow letter r at the end of a syllable in an Arabic word to modify and debase the vowel that precedes it in the syllable, as is so general in English words. All Arabic vowels must always be kept pure in pronunciation, as vowels are always kept pure in Italian, and most other languages; no modification of their one sound each is in any case permissible.\n\nThe twenty-eight Arabic consonants are further divisible as to pronunciation, into two very distinct, but numerically unequal classes, \"soft\" and \"hard\" (or \"harsh\"). Nineteen are soft, \u062a, \u0628, \u062a, \u062b, \u062c, \u062e, \u062f, \u0630, \u0631, \u0632, \u0633, \u0634, \u0635, \u0636, \u0637, \u0638, \u063a, \u0641, \u0642, \u0643.\nwhile only nine are hard, \u0636, \u0635, \u062e, \u062d, \u0642, \u063a, \u0639, \u0638, \u0637.\n\nThe chief result of this division of the consonants is that the short *fet-ha* vowel', when following one of the former in the same syllable, generally takes the value of our short *e* in bet, men, pen, ten, etc.; whereas, in accompanying a consonant of the hard class, it invariably takes the sound of our short surd vowel *a*, as heard in the first syllable of the word above, and in the indefinite article of the phrase a man. The vowel *kesra* - is also affected in an analogous manner to be explained further on; but the vowel *dzamma* ' is not so affected, always having the Italian *u* value, short or long.\n\nThe difficulty experienced by an English student of Arabic, in respect of transliterating the vowels, does not arise from the Arabic vowels themselves, but from the uncertain, indefinable, ever-changing sound of our vowel-letters. Every one of our vowels takes, at times, the short surd value of *a* in above; thus, her, fir, actor, but. Our East-India service once adopted the use of this *u* of but, us, etc., to represent the Arabic short *fet-ha* vowel in all cases invariably; and some still do so. Thus we meet with Mohummud, Syud, etc.\n\nEvery one of our English vowels, moreover, has several values, as in fat, fate, father, fall, above; me, met, her; reliance, pit, fir; go, got, shove; purity, pudding, gut. By reason of this uncertainty, the deceptive, incorrect rule was adopted: \"the vowels as in Italian,\" the *a* to be always read as in father, *e* as in pet, *i* as in pin, *o* as in go, *u* as in pull. If this rule is incorrect, how are the three Arabic vowels to be correctly represented in our characters? and what is the incorrect part of the rule?\n\n1. The Italian *a*-sound does not exist in Arabic as a short vowel at all. Our English short surd sound of *a*, unknown in Italian, is the only true equivalent of Arabic short *fet-ha* following one of the nine hard consonants; as, \ufea1\u064e\ufee4\u0652\u062f\u064c hamd,\n2. With any one of the nineteen soft consonants, short fet-ha is generally equivalent to Italian e, as in our men, met, etc. Thus, \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0644\u064f emed, \u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651 berr, \u062a\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651 tell, \u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0628\u064f thenb, \u062c\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064f jelb, \u062f\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0646\u064c defn, \u0630\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0628\u064f dheneb, \u0631\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064f resm, \u0632\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0631\u064f zejr, \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062a\u064f semt, \u0634\u0650\u062c\u064e\u0631\u064f shejer, \u0641\u064e\u0645\u064f fem, \u0643\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064f kelb, \u0644\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0645\u064f lezm, \u0645\u064e\u0631\u064f mer', \u0646\u064e\u0633\u0650\u062c\u064f nesj, \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651 meter, \u0647\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0644\u064f hezl, \u064a\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f yemen. But, the occurrence of any one or more of the nine hard consonants in a word, wherever placed in it, has a tendency to cause the short surd a value to be assumed by the fet-ha of the nearest soft consonant, or even of any soft consonant in the word. This detail can be learnt only by hearing correct readers and speakers pronounce the words.\n\n3. Long fet-ha \u06e1 has two different values, also, with the two classes of consonants. With the soft class, it has the Italian sound of a, lengthened as in our word father (like French a in p\u00e2tre); but with the hard class, it no longer has the Italian or French sound, but becomes very similar to our broadest long a in wall, fall, call. We have no method to distinguish these two values in writing, and continental scholars are usually ignorant of their difference; neither can they mark it in any way. The class of the Arabic consonant marks the difference effectually, indubitably; and English scholars should emphasize this difference in their pronunciation of Arabic. Thus, \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0632\u064f b\u0101riz, \u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0639\u064f t\u0101si', \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064f j\u0101ri', etc., as father; but \u062d\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0644\u064f h\u0101mil, \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0631\u064f kh\u0101\u1e6dir, \u0635\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064f s\u0101dir, \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f dz\u0101ll, \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0631\u064f t\u0101hir, \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0631\u064f ts\u0101fir, \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0631\u064f '\u0101tir, \u063a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0646\u064f g\u0101bin, \u0642\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064f q\u0101dir, etc., almost like our broad a in hawk, vault, etc. There are a few well-known words in which the Arabic long-vowel fet-ha \u06e1 is dispensed with in writing, though still fully pronounced; such as \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f for \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c; and \u0645\u064f\u0639\u064e\u0648\u0650\u0651\u062f\u064f is sometimes met with\nfor \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629. The forms \u062d\u0643\u064a\u0631\u0648 and \u0635\u0644\u0648\u0627 are much used, from reverence for an archaic usage found in the Qur\u2019an.\n\n4. With the nineteen soft consonants, the short-vowel kesra - is again exactly represented by the Italian sound of i, as in our fin, pit, etc. Thus: \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 idh, \u0628\u0646\u062a bint, \u062c\u0633\u0645 jism, \u062f\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0629 diraya, \u0631\u062f\u064a\u0647 ridya, \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 lis\u0101n, etc. With the long vowel kesra \u064a- the sound is the same, but prolonged as in our words ravine, fascine. Thus: \u0633\u064a\u0631\u0627 sira, \u0646\u064a\u0644 fil, \u062f\u064a\u0646 din, etc.\n\n5. With the nine hard consonants, the short and the long-vowel kesra requires a sound of which we have no conception in English, and which does not exist in French, Italian, or German, but is well known in Russian, where it is represented by the special vowel letter \u044b. Until its true sound can be learnt by ear, a student must of necessity pronounce it as the Italian i when short, and as the French i when long. Thus: \u062d\u0630\u0641\u0627\u0646 hidth\u0101n, \u062e\u062f\u0645\u0629 khidma, \u0633\u0628\u0639\u0629 sibga, \u062a\u0628\u0639 tiq, \u0639\u0644\u0629 illa, \u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 qir\u0101n; \u0635\u064a\u063a\u0629 s\u012bga, \u0636\u064a\u0641\u0627\u0646 dzif\u0101n, \u0639\u064a\u0634\u064a 'is\u0101, \u0642\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0637 qir\u0101t, etc.\n\n6. With short or long-vowel dzamma \u2019 or \u064f\u2019, the two classes of consonants make no difference of sound in Arabic, except in the quantity, Italian u being always the model of the sound; as, \u0628\u064a\u0631 burr, \u062d\u0648\u0631 hur, etc.\n\nThe following remarks may usefully be added:\n\n1. In transliterating and pronouncing Arabic, never reduplicate a consonant unless to represent a teshdid *, in the original; and always reduplicate such letter in writing and in pronouncing; as in \u0631\u0628 rabb, \u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646\u0649 rabb\u0101niyy, \u0633\u0643\u064a\u0646 sikkin, \u0642\u0627\u0647\u0631 qahhar, \u0645\u0639\u062a\u0633\u0641 mutessef, etc. This rule is strictly Italian as well as Arabic. Englishmen, slaves to French example, write double letters in words, and then pronounce but one; as in command, sunny, turret, etc. And yet we say mad dog, if fair, in nature, etc., correctly, sounding the\ntwo successive consonants; and it is just as easy to do so in the middle or at the end of one word.\n\n2. It will not have escaped the reader, that, in transliterating Arabic words that end with a short-vowel \\textit{fet-ha} after a soft consonant, the letter \\textit{a} has constantly been used in the present paper. This is merely a compliance with the necessities of English orthography, since we do not possess the French \\textit{\u00e9} or the German final value of \\textit{e}; and final \\textit{e} in an English word is always dropped in pronunciation, producing an effect on the preceding vowel instead. A final \\textit{a} has not this effect, though it does not truly represent the sound of Arabic \\textit{fet-ha} after a soft consonant. It is a vowel, one of the equivalents to \\textit{fet-ha}, and is more correct, by far more preferable, than the erroneous and objectionable \\textit{ah} or \\textit{eh} used by so many. It is an unfortunate necessity, and may sometimes be evaded in compound expressions, such as \\textit{q\u0101le-'r-res\u016bl}, etc.\n\n3. A very erroneous method of transliterating Arabic compound terms and sentences, prevalent all over the continent, as well as among English scholars, is, to sink the final vowel of a word, leaving its consonant bare; and then to treat the next word, commencing with an \\textit{'elif of union} \\textit{T}, as though it were the initial word of a sentence, or an isolated word. Thus they write, for instance: \\textit{Jem\u0101l-ed-d\u012bn}, etc., instead of \\textit{Jem\u0101lu-'d-D\u012bn} (\\textit{Jem\u0101li-'d-D\u012bn}, \\textit{Jem\u0101la-'d-D\u012bn}), etc. It is a most reprehensible practice, and a careful student should break himself of it as speedily as possible. De Sacy (Gram. Ar. vol. i. pp. 79-81, seconde \u00e9dition) transliterates correctly in this respect; and Wright (Gram. of Arab. Lang. vol. i. pp. 19-22) gives the correct rules on this point.\n\n4. When a word commencing with an \\textit{'elif of union} stands alone, begins a discourse, or comes after a full stop or pause, or after a word ending with a quiescent consonant, a vowel must be borrowed for that initial \\textit{T}, as is said, from our own\npocket, or mind. It is always *set-ha* with the initial definite article, which then becomes pronounced as \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652 'el; and so it is with \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652, which becomes \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 'eymen. But with the other nine nouns, if initial, \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e, \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064e, etc., *kesra* is borrowed, and they become \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e 'ibn, \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064e 'ibna, etc. For the \u062a of the verbs, too many rules exist to be given here. But, when these various classes follow a word ending with a quiescent consonant, it is this consonant that borrows the vowel required, and then becomes movent. The special rules must be studied in a grammar.\n\nThe following words and names are offered as examples of the system advocated, with instances (in parentheses), gathered from various sources of great authority, of different kinds of erroneous transliteration:\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064f 'eb (ab).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064f 'Ebreha (Abrahah).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u063a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u0650 'Ibnu 'l-Mugawir (Ibn el-Moghawir).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u062c\u064f\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0650 'Ibnu Jubeyr (Ibn Jubair).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 'eb\u016b (ab\u016b).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0652 'Ebwa' (Abwa).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0633\u064f\u0641\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0646\u0652 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n (Ab\u016b-Sofy\u0101n, Abu Sufy\u0101n).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0628\u0652 'Eb\u016b-Leheb (Abu Laheb).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0647\u064f\u0631\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064e 'Eb\u016b-Hureyra (Abu Horeira).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0652 Ikhm\u012bm (Akmim).\n\n\u0623\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0652 Usw\u0101n (Assouan).\n\n\u0623\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0652 Ushm\u016bneyn (Ashmuneim).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0633\u0652 'el-Quds (Al-Kods).\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0652 ewt\u0101s (Autas).\n'ewq\u0101f (aukaf, efkaif, evcaf).\nBa\u1e63ra (Bassorah, Basrah).\nBu\u1e63r\u0101 (Bostra).\nBekru 'bnu Wa'il.\nBekru Wa'il.\n(Bakr-W\u00e2il).\nBeyda' (Baid\u00e2').\nEt-Tellu 'l-Keb\u00eer (Tel el-Kebir).\nTeyma' (Teymah).\njebeleyn (obl. of jebel\u00e2n, dual of a mountain) two mountains (gebel\u00ean).\nJidda, Judda (Jeddah).\nJudeyda (Jedaydah).\nJizza (Egypt.

XIV.\u2014The Rock-Cut Caves and Statues of Bamian.\u00b9\nBy Capt. the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E. With Notes hereon, and on Sketches of Capt. P. J. Maitland, Intelligence Branch, Q.-M.-Gen. Department, by W. Simpson, Esq., Hon. Assoc. R.I.B.A., etc.; and an additional Note of Capt. Maitland's own.\n\n(Communicated through the President of the Royal Asiatic Society.)\n\nIntroductory Remarks by the President.\n\nThe letter which is about to be read,\u00b9 not having been prepared for submission to the Society, may require a few introductory explanations.\n\nB\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n, a site of considerable fame in the travels and expeditions of the last sixty or seventy years, stands at a height of some 8500 feet, in a valley of the region occupied by Haz\u00e1ra tribes, on the chief road between Kabul and Turkestan, and almost close to the northern base of that part of the Indian Caucasus which is known, from one of its prominent peaks, as Koh-i-b\u00e1b\u00e1.\n\nThe passes on the Kabul side of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n reach to 11,000 and 12,000 feet, and those north of it, towards Turkestan, to not much less.\n\nThe stream draining the valley of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n is one of the chief sources of the river known as the Surkh\u00e1b or \u00c1ksarai River, a considerable tributary of the Oxus, into which it flows some thirty-two miles N.W. of Kunduz.\n\nThe prominences of the cliffs which line the valley of\n\n\u00b9 At a Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 15th March, 1886.\nB\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n are crowned by the remains of numerous massive towers, whilst their precipitous faces are for six or seven miles pierced by an infinity of anciently excavated caves, some of which are still occupied as dwellings. The actual site of the old city is marked by mounds and remains of walls, and on an isolated rock in the middle of the valley are the considerable ruins of what appear to have been the acropolis, now known as Gh\u00falgh\u00fala.\n\nBut the most famous antiquities of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n are certain standing figures of enormous size, carved in the conglomerate rock on the sides of the gorge. These images, which have been much injured by cannon-shot, are cut in niches; both images and niches have been coated with plaster, whilst the plastered surface of the niches has been painted with figures. As seen from the rock of Gh\u00falgh\u00fala, B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n, with its numerous grottoes, and with the singular red colour of its soil, presents an impressive aspect of desolation and mystery.\n\nThe history of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n is very obscure. There is nothing on which to found an identification of the place with any name handed down in the classical geographers or historians of Alexander. The earliest mention of the kingdom and city of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n is in the travels of (the Chinese) Hwen T'sang, A.D. 630; but his account does not determine the race either of the inhabitants or of the reigning prince. We know also that at a much later date B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n was, for half a century, the seat of a branch of the Ghor\u00ed or Shansab\u00e1nya dynasty, which came to an end in 1214. Major Raverty, in his translation of the \u1e6caba\u1e33at-i-N\u00e1siri (p. 427), quotes Persian historical writers to the effect that the proper name of the city was R\u00e1sif, or the like. But it is no uncommon circumstance in Asiatic geography for the name of a kingdom or territory to usurp and practically to extinguish the name of the capital. In 1222 the place was taken and utterly destroyed by Chingh\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, and I am not aware of any later records of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n's history. The character, however, of the ruins of Gh\u00falgh\u00fala, and concurring local tradition, indicate that the city must have been rebuilt since the time of Chingh\u00edz, and again destroyed.\nThe great idols, as has already been said, have constituted the matter attracting chiefly attention to B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n. They are not, I believe, alluded to by any of the early Arab geographers, at least in any works that have been printed. Burnes alleges that they are mentioned by Sharafu-d d\u00edn \u2019Al\u00ed of Yezd in his History of Timur; if so, this (1424) would be the earliest Persian mention: but I have not been able to find such a passage in the translation by Petis de la Croix. Hyde, in his History of the Religion of the Ancient Persians (ed. 1760, pp. 229\u2013230), quotes mention of them from two Persian writers, viz. the Mas\u00e1l\u00edk wa Mam\u00e1l\u00edk\u00b9 and the Farhang Jah\u00e1ngiri. There is also mention of them in the A'in-i-Akbari (Blochmann's Text, vol. i. p. 590, and Gladwin's Trans. vol. ii. p. 168). Hyde, whose book was first published in 1700, was apparently the first European writer to speak of the images.\u00b2 After him we have Wilford, in vol. vi. of the Asiatic Researches. Wilford's exertions in collecting knowledge were most praiseworthy, but, unfortunately for his reputation, he never would publish the knowledge, which he acquired with great labour and cost, without mixing it up with a large amount of his own fantastical and baseless speculations, to say nothing of the forgeries which were imposed upon him. Moorcroft (Travels, vol. ii. pp. 387 seqq.) was the first of our English or European travellers actually to see these remains, though his account was not published till after that of Alexander Burnes, who passed B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n on his way to Bokhara in 1832, and gave an account of it in the second volume of the Journal of the Asiat. Soc. of Bengal, as well as (somewhat later) in his Travels. Masson (Various Journeys, etc., ii. 382 seqq.), Mohun Lal, Sir Vincent Eyre, and others have since seen and given their impres-\n\n\u00b9 Ritter quotes this from Hyde as if it were the work of Ibn Haukal bearing the same name; but this is a mistake.\n\n\u00b2 I have sometimes thought that Friar Odoric had seen the great idol of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n, from expressions he uses about the Terrible Valley: \"In hac etiam valle ab uno latere ejus in ipso saxo unam faciem hominis maximam et terribilem ego vidi, quae in tantum terribilis erat quod praesimio timore spiritum me perdere penitus credebam.\" But other particulars indicate that he may rather have passed by the Panjhir Valley. See Cathay, etc., pp. 157\u2013158.\nsions, the last account preceding the letter now before us being contained in the Russian Narrative of Dr. J. L. Yavorsky (St. Petersburgh, 1882). Mr. Delmar Morgan, ever ready with help, has kindly furnished me with a translation of the passages relating to B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n in this last work, but I find nothing in them of sufficient value or novelty to transcribe.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe best of the modern accounts of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n till the present time is, I incline to think, Moorcroft\u2019s. His estimate of the height of the images is much nearer the truth than that of Burnes, whilst he distinctly recognizes the Buddhistic character of the remains. Elphinstone, writing in 1814, however, already says: \u201cThe learned in Indian antiquities are of opinion that these idols are connected with the worship of Boodh, and their situation strongly reminds one of the colossal statues at the entrance of the great temples, supposed to belong to the religion of Boodh, in the midst of the city of caves, which is to be seen at Canara (Kanheri) in Salsette.\u201d \u2014Caubool (orig. 4to. edition), p. 487. I do not know to what expression of opinion by the learned, Elphinstone can here refer, except to the words of Wilford (Asiat. Res. vol. vi. p. 463), who says the place was considered at an early period to be the metropolis of the sect of Buddha, whence Buddha-B\u00e1miy\u00e1n, which he alleges the Mussulmans corrupted into But- (or Idol) B\u00e1miy\u00e1n. But any idol would be but, Buddha or not.\n\nWilford got his information on the subject, at least in part, from a Sayad called Miy\u00e1n Asad Sh\u00e1h, who had visited B\u00e1miy\u00e1n ten or twelve times.\n\nWith regard to Elphinstone\u2019s allusion to Salsette, Masson also says: \u201cI have recently visited the Buddhist temples in the island of Salsette, and certainly there can be no doubt of the resemblance between the colossal figures of Buddha in them and those of the B\u00e1miy\u00e1n niches\u201d (Various Journeys, vol. ii. p. 384).\n\nThe publication in French, by Julien, of the Life of Hwen\n\n\\(^1\\) See also in Panjab Notes and Queries for February, 1886, p. 84.\nTsang (Paris, 1853), showed how just Moorcroft's surmise had been. The Chinese traveller found at Bami\u00e1n ten convents and about 1000 monks belonging to the \"Little Vehicle.\" He goes on: \"To the N.E. of the royal city there is a mountain, on the declivity of which is placed a stone figure of Buddha, erect, in height 140 or 150 feet. Its golden hues sparkle on every side, and its precious ornaments dazzle the eyes by their brightness. To the east of this spot there is a convent, which was built by a former king of the country. To the east of the convent there is a standing figure of S\u0101kya Buddha, made of metallic stone\" (in Julien laiton, i.e. brass), \"in height 100 feet. It has been cast in different parts and joined together, and then placed in a completed form as it stands. To the east of the city twelve or thirteen li there is a convent, in which there is a figure of Buddha lying in a sleeping position, as when he attained Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The figure is in length about 1000 feet or so.\" (Beal's Transl. of the Si-yu-ki, i. 50\u201351.)\n\nFrom this passage we appear to learn that the second of the images was originally covered with sheets of brass; also, I think, that the larger one was gilt, as is indeed antecedently probable.\n\nRegarding the sleeping Buddha a little more is to be said. These figures are to be found in all Buddhist countries; I have described one near Pag\u00e1n in the narrative of Sir Arthur Phayre's Mission to Ava, p. 52. One in Ceylon is mentioned in Major Forbes's book (vol. i. p. 370). And gigantic figures of the same kind, indeed, at Kanchau in N.W. China, are mentioned by Marco Polo (bk. i. ch. 44), by Shah Rukh's envoys to Peking, and by Ramusio's Persian friend Hajji Mahommed (see Cathay and the Way Thither, p. cciii, and p. ccxviii).\n\nNow it is remarkable that Masson and Mohun Lal both mention a stone object in the neighbourhood of Bami\u00e1n, which is known in the legends of the natives as an Azhdah\u00e1 or dragon, regarded as a monster destroyed by 'Ali. The most distinct account of this object is contained in a paper by Lieut.-General E. Kaye, of the Royal Artillery (Bengal),\nwhich was printed for the first time in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society for 1879, though the observations date from 1840. He says:\u2014\u201cOn the opposite side of the valley (i.e. from the images), about a mile to the west, a stony gully leads into the hills; a short way up this there is a nearly isolated rock, on the flat summit of which there is in relief a recumbent figure bearing a rude resemblance to a huge lizard, and near the neck of the reptile there is a red splash, as of blood. This is called the Azdahar, or dragon, said to have been slain by Ali or some Mahomedan saint of bygone days, and an indentation in the rock close by is held to be the gigantic footprint of the slayer\u201d (p. 249).\u00b9\n\nIn the same volume (p. 338) I made a suggestion to which I now recall attention, that this Dragon (which, however, General Kaye terms \u201ca recumbent figure in relief\u201d) is really the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a Buddha of Hwen T\u2019sang. There is a difficulty, no doubt, in the direction, which the modern travellers give as west or north-west of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n, whilst Hwen T\u2019sang places it to the eastward. Another difficulty has been suggested from the account of Mohun L\u00e1l, who calls the dragon \u201cfifty feet in length.\u201d But in this there is probably some mistake. For Masson says this Azhdah\u00e1 of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n is \u201canalogous in character to that of Bis\u00fat, but of much larger size\u201d (vol. ii. p. 395). Now, turning to his account of the Azhdaha of Bis\u00fat (the province immediately south of Koh-i-Baba), we find it thus described: \u201cThe Azdha of Bis\u00fat is, indeed a natural curiosity, which the creative imagination of the Haz\u00e1ras supposes to be the petrified remains of a dragon, slain by their champion Hazrat Ali.... It is, geologically speaking, of volcanic formation, and a long projected mass of rock, about one hundred and seventy yards in length,\u201d etc. \u201cI afterwards found that an analogous mass of rocks, but of much more imposing size, occurs in the vicinity of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n, and is alike supposed to represent a petrified dragon\u201d (ib. pp. 357\u2013359).\n\n\u00b9 Both this dragon and another in the neighbourhood are mentioned, as Sir F. Goldsmid kindly points out, in D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n\u2019s Visit to Afghanistan, etc., 1872, printed by the Panj\u00e1b Government.\nI will conclude by remarking that some one has suggested (I cannot remember who, it may have been General Cunningham, or it may have been *moi qui vous parle*), that those enormously long graves, which in Afghanistan and India are so often shown as the tombs of holy giants (*ch\u00e2l\u00ees gast*, and what not), really mark the sites of Buddha-in-Nirv\u00e2na images.\\(^1\\) Such graves are mentioned, in Bis\u00fat, by Masson (p. 340), and in Laghm\u00e1n, the graves of Lot and Lamech, by the same (vol. iii. pp. 195\u2013197). The same traveller also mentions that these long graves are especially numerous in the valleys of Ningrah\u00e1r, which we can hardly doubt to represent the *Nagarah\u00e1ra* of Hwen T'sang, a region which abounded to profusion in Buddhist shrines and relics of every kind. There is a famous grave of the same kind, if I remember rightly, at Ayodhya, a site which was also rich in Buddhist shrines and memorials.\n\n**LETTER.**\n\n_Camp, Haibak, Nov. 13th, 1885._\n\nMy Dear Simpson,\n\nMaitland and I have made the long-talked-of trip through the Hazara country to Bamian, and we are now on our way to Turkistan, having crossed the Kara Kotal to-day. We have had a very fair time of it, but the weather has been bad. We got our first snowstorm on our second march from Daulatyar on the 10th of October, and did not get free from it till we descended into Yak Urang,\\(^2\\) at the head of the Balkhao. After that we had mostly good weather till we got to Bamian. There have been one or two falls since. This has, of course, made it unpleasant and hindered my surveying very much. However I have got my work triangulation and plane tabling all right so far. We saw nothing of any interest in the Hari Rud basin, except a really ancient rock-cut inscription in the Tangi Azao near Shahrak; copies of this I have sent to Cunningham and Rawlinson, but have\n\n\\(^1\\) As this is going to press, I find that the originator of the suggestion was my friend Mr. W. Simpson. He is now less confident in the theory; but to me it seems a highly probable one.\u2014H.Y.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Yaka Awang.* See Erskine\u2019s Baber, p. 211.\nhad no answers yet. In the Balkhao valley there are two or three old sites. First and lowest down, Chahilburj. This I did not see, but I send Maitland's description: \"Chahilburj is 28 miles from Z\u00e1ri, on the road to Balkh by the Balkhao, standing on a semi-isolated hill at the point at which a large ravine, down which the road comes, joins the main stream. It is at the East end of the Sokhtagi Valley. The road at present forks just below the fort, so that it commands the junction. The remains are those of a fortress of considerable size, and consist of three lines of walls with towers at very close intervals. The walls are in parts fairly perfect, but from a casual inspection I should say that the lower wall was never carried all round the hill. It certainly existed on the south side and on the east side, though now carried away by a landslip. The original height of the walls I should estimate at 50 or 60 feet: the towers are of the same height and large diameter. The walls and towers are all built of very large sun-dried bricks, except the lower courses, which are of stone and mud.\n\nThe shape of the loopholes is peculiar (see Pl. I. Fig. 1). I noticed three tiers of such loopholes in a tower still standing on the higher portion of the hill.\n\nThe three lines of walls are all about the same height, but being built on a steep slope each commands the one outside it. Inside the walls, remains of some buildings were visible. The plateau west of and below the fort is inclosed by a wall originally 10 or 12 feet high and several feet thick, built of rough stone imbedded in mud. The space inclosed may have been the site of a small town. There is a tradition that a portion of it was originally the site of a bazaar.\n\nOn the south side of the fort, and under a low scarp facing the base of the hill on which the fort is built, are several chambers, some of which are slightly sunk into the face of the scarp and appear to have been divided by mud-brick walls: some are sunk almost entirely into the hill and below the surface of the ground. They have round arches and round arched recesses.\"\n\nAnother place is the Shahri Barbar, some 35 miles higher\nup the Balkhao than Chahilburj. It is situated in the fork at the junction of the water from the Band i Amir with that of the Sarikol and Firozbahar. It consists only of a wall built round the north and only accessible side of a plateau about 1200 feet above the valley, and must only have been used as a place of refuge. The wall is built of uncut but selected stone, all of much the same size and shape, roughly a cube of nine inch side, arranged in straight courses sometimes breaking joint, sometimes not. The wall is eight to twelve feet high and about eight feet thick. In a low portion of the plateau there are four holes eight to twenty feet deep, apparently to collect rain or snow-water. There are two small mud buildings. At one point, built in the thickness of the wall, are some small domed chambers: the domes are built in the usual manner.\n\nIn two nalaas, called respectively Darali and Sarikol, at the head of the Balkhao, are a good many caves\u201450 or 60, I dare say. Those in the Darali were all inhabited, and mud walls had been built in front of them, hiding the shape of their doorways.\n\nIn the Sarikol valley I visited several. They were mostly situated a little way up the cliff and awkward to get at. Several had ledges at the inner end three or four feet wide and one foot high, as if for sitting or sleeping on. The most perfect one was a passage twenty-five to thirty feet long, nine feet high, and nine to ten feet wide. The door was narrower, as shown in the sketch (Pl. I. Fig. 2).\n\nAt the lower end of the Sarikol Nala, and about six miles above Shahri Barbar, is an old fort called G\u00e1wargin. I was told that its original name was Gabarger. It consists of walls and towers of sun-dried bricks, built on both sides of a ravine, on nearly inaccessible rocks. The only curious thing about it is a staircase cut inside the rock, descending from the highest point down no one knows where. The chief of the place told me he had been down seventy steps. He expects to find great treasures at the bottom.\n\nAfter seeing Shahri Ghulghulah and Zohak, Maitland and I came to the conclusion that these three places, Chahil-\nburj, Barbar, and Gawargin, might well be of the same date. Just below the fort of Gawargin is a mound which looks like a tope. Near the top a piece of flat wall is exposed, which must, I should say, have been part of the relic chamber, as it appears to have been in the centre of the tope.\n\nI spent four days at Bamian, but could give only a very small portion of that time in visiting the antiquities.\n\nTo begin with the figures: there are five.\n\n1. First the big idol, male. The passage up to the top of this is broken away, so I measured it with my theodolite and found it to be 173 feet high. It is sunk in a niche, so as to be protected from the weather. The shape of the niche is something like Pl. I. Fig. 3.\n\n2. A female figure 120 feet high, measured by Maitland with a tape. The passage up to the top is still accessible.\n\nThere are paintings on the roofs of the niches of both these figures. In the case of the latter some have been copied. Both figures are hewn out of the conglomerate rock, but the finishing, drapery, etc., was all added by putting on stucco. The niche of the female figure is irregular, and looks as if it had been left unfinished.\n\n3. A smaller figure, 50 or 60 feet high, estimated. This figure has almost entirely disappeared.\n\n4. A seated figure about 25 to 30 feet high, in a niche. This figure looks as if it had been cut out and prepared for stucco, but the stucco had never been applied. Shape of niche shown in Pl. I. Fig. 4.\n\n5. A standing figure about one mile from the others. Unfortunately, owing to a misunderstanding, we never visited this.\n\nNo. 4 also has paintings, some of which have been copied. The caves are innumerable, they extend for miles. The best ones are close to the female figure. The doorways are mostly sunk well 10 or 15 feet into the rock, with a porch excavated outside. I show drawings of the most remarkable (see Pl. I. from Figs. 5 to 14).\n\nMost of the caves in good order are now inhabited, so I could not visit them; of those I did visit most had domed\nroofs, the floor being square. The conversion of the square into a circle, preparatory to the springing of the dome, is effected or rather indicated in the manner used in the present day with kacha bricks, that is, by a succession of arches at the corners. Looking at the corner from the centre of the cave it appears thus (see Pl. I. Fig. 15).\n\nFig. 16 seems to be connected with a very curious cave, somewhat hard to draw. Its plan is an oblong 16 by 20 feet. The roof is highest in the centre, a square being cut out containing a geometrical pattern enclosing a hemispherical dome about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in diameter (see Pl. I. Figs. 17, 18, 19).\n\nI won't swear to the accuracy of these drawings, as they are done from very hurried sketches, but they are something like. Maitland made a freehand sketch of the roof of this cave, of which I will send a sketch if I have time to make one.\n\nThe caves near the idols are all connected by rambling passages and staircases cut in the rock.\n\nMany of the caves have paintings, but we could not see them as the caves were full of grass, etc., stored for winter.\n\nIn Shahri Ghulghulah we saw nothing remarkable.\n\nZohak is a wonderful fort as regards situation and multiplication of lines of defence. It is fairly well preserved in parts, so much so that the natives say it was not captured but abandoned. Some domed chambers in it are the exact facsimiles of the domed caves above mentioned.\n\nI saw no Vihara caves. I inquired about them, and was told that there were some with rooms round a central passage or hall; but as they were occupied, I did not see them.\n\nThey were described as being in one or two cases a square or rectangular room, with a small room opening off from it on three sides, the side of the entrance being the exception. I was also told that there was one cave which had six rooms opening off from it, that is, two from each of the three sides. I think there are very few of these Vihara caves. The different shaped caves I have shown are all mixed up together. It would be impossible to pick out any one lot from their style as having been executed at one particular time; at\nleast, so it seemed to me from a very casual inspection. Many caves have fallen partly, at least their porches and original doorways have gone. Many others have had their doorways and porches partly bricked up, so that their shape is lost.\n\nI could see no sign of the sleeping Buddha. I have seen caves more or less all the way to here, Haibak, but nothing new or remarkable; also medi\u00e6val ruins.\n\nNo time for more. Excuse a very rambling letter, but I cannot afford time to put it into shape. Hoping it may interest you,\n\nBelieve me, Yours sincerely,\nM. G. Talbot.\n\nNotes to Capt. Talbot's Letter, by William Simpson.\n\nA number of travellers have passed Bamian at various times, and have given notices of the colossal figures and the caves, but they have brought away only vague details of them. Captain Talbot's letter supplies us with the first instalment of accurate information regarding this wonderful place; and the details are so valuable, that I scarcely like to utter the wish that he had sent us more of them, as such an expression might seem to indicate a want of thankfulness for what we have received. We must remember that Captain Talbot is very devoted to his duties in the Survey Department, and that he was only four days at Bamian.\n\nAs far as I can make out from Captain Talbot's letter, he and Captain Maitland, one of the political department with the Afghan Boundary Commission, came from the north-west, where the camp of the Commission was during the summer months, and dropped into the valley of the Hari Rud, probably on the east of Obeh. They followed up the valley as far as Daulatyar, which is near the junction of the Tingab and the Jangal Rivers; from this they moved east to the sources of the Balkh River,\u2014called in the letter Balkh-h\u00e1o(\u00e1b). Capt. Maitland here visited Chahilburj, on this stream, from whom Captain Talbot quotes an account of that\nThe Large Male Figure at Bamian.\nFrom a sketch made in 1842, by Lieut-General Sir Vincent Eyre, K.C.S.I.\nplace: the route after that was still east to Bamian, from which they went north on the regular road towards Khulum; and the letter is written at Haibak, about forty miles to the south of Khulum. The ground gone over is, the most of it, new to us. Ferrier passed from somewhere about Balkh or Khulum to Herat, but his route was to the westward of Talbot's; he struck the Hari Rud Valley, passing by Singlak, about twenty or thirty miles on the west of Daulatyar. Ferrier mentions caves at Singlak, but Captain Talbot found nothing of interest, except an inscription, in the Hari Rud Valley. It is not till he gets east to the Balkh River that he mentions groups of caves, but that is so near to Bamian, that they all might have been off-shoots from that place, which may have enjoyed the character of a religious centre.\n\nCaptain Talbot gives us what we may now accept as the true height of the two principal figures. Various estimates have been given by travellers. Sir Vincent Eyre\u2014who visited Bamian while a prisoner in the first Afghan war\u2014made statements regarding them, and came very near the truth. The female figure he gives as 120 feet, which turns out to agree exactly with Captain Maitland's measurement. The male figure he puts at 160 feet, which was only thirteen feet from the truth. Sir Vincent Eyre describes the holes in the figures for pieces of wood to be inserted, the object of which was to make the plaster or stucco hold. Captain Talbot gives us an outline of the form of the niches (Pl. I. Fig. 3) in which these figures stand. This agrees perfectly with a sketch I have, made by Sir Vincent Eyre,\u00b9 and the trefoil arch is a feature we are familiar with in the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d remains, as well as those in the Yusufzai country, and in the Cashmere architecture. There is a niche very like this, only smaller, in a cliff above the Fil Kh\u00e1na Tope at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, and it was from the authority of Sir Vincent Eyre's sketch that\n\n\u00b9 I give in Pl. II. a rough copy of Sir Vincent Eyre's sketch. I do not think it was ever published, but if it ever appeared, the drawing is not well known to archeologists. Burns gives a highly-finished lithograph in his work of this figure, but I do not think it is so accurate; this can be judged of so far by comparing the shape of the top of the niche with the outline given by Captain Talbot. It will be seen that Eyre's sketch is much nearer to the truth.\nI described it as having had a statue of Buddha in it. This peculiar arch is also given in Pl. I. Figs. 4, 6, and 7.\n\nFig. 5 in Pl. I. is a form I cannot pretend to explain. The small semicircular form on the top seems to be a not uncommon characteristic, for it appears again in Figs. 13, 18, and 19; and in Figs. 12 and 14 we may perhaps have the same structural idea in another form. The origin of the trefoil arch is, I think, not yet quite clear; and in this peculiar feature, in which we see what may be possibly varieties of it, there is just a chance of new light coming to us on this point. On my late visit to the Afghan frontier, I saw a great amount of what I call \"Mud Architecture,\" that is, mud and sun-dried bricks. Wherever wood for rafters was scarce, the sun-dried bricks were thrown over the roof in the form of a vault or dome, and the process I believe goes back to a very early period; this particular construction might account for the form under consideration,\u2014but I only hazard this as a guess,\u2014and leave the matter in that position till further light turns up.\n\nThe pointed arch in the caves lately discovered in the Murghab Valley produced in my mind what seemed about the only reason which might stand against their having been Buddhist. Fig. 10 thus becomes important, for it gives us the exact outline of the section of the Murghab Caves, and shows that the form did exist in that part of the world at the Buddhist period. Fig. 11 is very nearly the same form. When the paper on the Murghab Caves was read, Mr. Thornton called attention to the fact that the pointed arch was found in the Buddhist remains of the Yusufzai country. Since then I have looked over my own sketches, photographs, books, etc., and I have to confess that I had not then given the point that attention which it deserves, and I am glad Mr. Thornton mentioned the matter. The Buddhist arch was round originally, but as the style travelled from its source, the forms were often rudely followed, and across the Indus this arch will be found round, oval, at times faintly\n\n1 In the Lomas Rishi Cave a pointed arch will be found.\nDetails of Buddhist Architecture to illustrate the Forms found at Bamian.\npointed, and often it becomes a pointed arch; so often, in fact, that I now consider it quite sufficient to account for the pointed arch at Bamian and in the Murghab Valley. In Pl. III. Fig 2 is given the form of this arch as it appears at Ajunta and Ellora; in Fig. I. of that plate is the same arch from the Fil-Kh\u00e1na tope at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, but it will be seen that the arch has been elongated into an oval.\n\nIn Pl. I. Fig. 14 and others we have a form which is unknown to Indian architecture, unless it be some survivals of it in the sloping walls of the older Buddhist caves, of which the one at Bhaja is a good example, and in the slight slope given to door-jambs, as in that of the Lomas Rishi Cave. In the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d valley I only found it as a decorative feature. As blind windows with Greek pediments are a common manner of covering blank walls in Europe, so this descendant of an old constructive system is repeated on the sides of stupas, and often alternating with the trefoil arch, as panels or niches, for sitting Buddhist figures. It is also found in the sculptures, and is a very common form. I came upon one instance of it at Ali Masjid, formed of plaster, and with mouldings of a classic origin, but the cross-beam, or lintel below the cornice, was represented with tenons projecting through the sloping jambe, in the same way as the lintels of the Sanchi gates project beyond the pillars, thus repeating a technical detail dating from the period when it belonged to a practical form of construction, and telling us at the same time of its wooden origin (see Pl. III. Fig. 3). I take it that this was the form of all doors and windows, or buildings, in which the walls had a considerable batter, and which walls were most probably originally wooden. Remains of this style, although no longer wooden, are still to be found in Tibet, and when K\u00e1f\u00edristan has been explored, I should expect it may be still found there as the mode of construction in its original materials. As the round arch (Pl. III. Fig. 2) was the prominent constructive feature of the Buddhist period on the plains of\n\n---\n\n1 The subjects in this plate are reductions from illustrations I gave in a paper on the Buddhist Architecture of the Jalalabad Valley, read before the Royal Institute of British Architects.\nIndia, this was its counterpart to the North of the Indus. It is one of the primitive forms of architecture in that part of the world, and it is most interesting to see it appearing as prominently at Bamian.\n\nCaptain Talbot describes these sketches as representing porches in front of the caves. This is a peculiarity of which I cannot recollect anything of the same kind in the caves of the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d valley. It may have existed, but many of them were so ruinous, particularly in the front, that it was difficult to say what they had been originally.\n\nMost of the caves at Bamian are domed; in the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d valley this is not the case; there are at Hada only a few square caves with domes in the roof. In one of these there was the base of what had been either a sitting Buddha or a small Stupa, under the dome. I am interested in Captain Talbot's identification of these domes with the modern manner of building with \"kacha,\" which means sun-dried, \"bricks.\" In Persia I made a similar sketch to that in Pl. I. Fig. 15; it, and some others I made of \"mud architecture,\" were done on account of ideas they suggested in relation to Buddhist architecture. I may yet write about them, but at present they are to me far from certainties; naturally, I feel encouraged by Captain Talbot's suggestions on the domes, but it may be recalled that in my paper on the Buddhist caves of Afghanistan,\u00b9 I have put it that the caves of the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d valley were copied from the early caves at Barabar, near Buddha Gaya: now, in three of these, the Lomas Rishi, Viswa Mitra, and the Sudama Caves, there are domed chambers. Here I think we have an explanation which is sufficient to account for the domes; but it must be confessed that it is only theoretical, and we may have yet to accept the \"Kacha brick\" explanation in its stead, which would give a Central Asian, rather than an Indian, origin to this particular form in Afghanistan.\n\nCaptain Talbot says he saw no Vihara caves, but some were described to him. They are square rooms; in one case\n\n\u00b9 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XIV. Part 3.\nthere were three rooms opening off from the central room\u2014that is, one on each side, but none on the side of the entrance. Another had two cells opening off from each side. At Darunta, in the Jal\u00e1labad valley, I found only one cave of this kind, and it had three cells on two of its sides, and four cells on the back wall, forming seven in all. A plan of this is given in my paper on the Buddhist Caves of Afghanistan,\u00b9 where it will be seen that it is exactly the same, excepting only the number of cells, with the description given by Captain Talbot.\n\nFigs. 17, 18, and 19 I cannot quite understand. Captain Talbot says it is \u201ca very curious cave, somewhat hard to draw.\u201d It must wait till he comes home to explain it.\n\nWhen I left the Afghan Boundary Commission, as Captain Talbot had hopes of extending the Survey to the eastward, I asked him if he managed to visit Bamian, to look out for the remains of the Great Sleeping Buddha, which Hiouen Thsang describes as being 1000 feet long. A long mound is all that could be expected to be found now, but nothing of the kind is to be seen. Mohan Lal describes a petrified snake, regarding which he gives a legend: it still lies a large mass on the ground, about fifty feet long. It is about four miles to the west of Bamian. The 1000 feet is so evidently an exaggeration, that I suspect Mohan Lal\u2019s legendary snake to be most probably the remains of the Sleeping Buddha.\n\nLady Sale, in her book, mentions that she or her daughter, Mrs. Sturt, copied some of the paintings at Bamian. The probability is that these copies escaped the dangers of the campaign, and that they still exist. Perhaps some of the members of the Royal Asiatic Society may know something of them, and as they might be of importance in supplying details regarding Bamian, it would be most interesting if they were produced before the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n\u00b9 Ibid, Plate 3.\nNOTES TO CAPTAIN MAITLAND'S SKETCHES OF BAMIAN.\n\nA few days after Captain Talbot's communication had been read at the Royal Asiatic Society, I received some sketches made at Bamian by Capt. Maitland. On submitting them to Colonel Yule, it was arranged that they should be added to this, and I have been asked to supply a few notes to them.\n\nCaptain Maitland's name has already been mentioned; he accompanied Captain Talbot as Political Officer, and the drawings sent home were copies of his sketches, made by Bhayron Bakhsh, a Brahmin attached to the camp of the Afghan Boundary Commission, and a pupil of the School of Art at J\u00e1ip\u00far.\n\nUnfortunately no descriptions came home with the drawings; so some slight explanation of them has to be given. Plate IV. represents that portion of the cliff at Bamian where the second statue stands, which is seen with the caves on the right and left of it. On the extreme left is, what Captain Talbot numbers as the fourth statue, a sitting figure. The largest statue does not appear in this plate, but it stands still further to the left, and according to Sir Vincent Eyre, is about 400 yards from the second one.\n\nThe arrangement of the verandahs in front of the caves, described by Captain Talbot, can be seen in this plate; and the peculiar forms drawn and described by him, although only roughly sketched in this case, can be easily identified. On the top of the cliff are a number of elevations, which I take to be mounds, most probably the remains of ruined stupas; in the Jalalabad Valley in almost every instance where there were caves in a scarp, there were similar mounds of stupas above them; and the great probability is that it is the same here. The largest mound, it will be noticed, is exactly over the statue. Burnes says that the rock at Bamian is \"indurated clay and pebbles.\" Sir Vincent Eyre describes it as \"that species of conglomerate known by the name of pudding-stone, consisting of very\nBamian. The First, or largest Statue.\nhard clay, thickly studded with various kinds of rounded pebbles.\u201d On the level ground underneath the statue there is an Afghan village.\n\nPlate V. represents the first and the largest of the great statues at Bamian; and as it is evidently carefully drawn, and gives minute details, it is particularly valuable, as it sets at rest all doubts as to the character of the sculpture. Hiuen Tsiang distinctly states that it was a figure of Buddha, and Masson identified it with the Buddhist figures he had seen at Salsette. Now we have the safer authority of this drawing of Capt. Maitland\u2019s to guide us, and it leaves no doubt on this point. The knob on the head; the regular lines of the folds of drapery,\u2014leaving the form of the body to be indicated,\u2014is all in the well-known style peculiar to Buddhism. It might naturally have been expected that the Greek influence, which is so well marked in the Buddhist sculptures of the Peshawer and Jalalabad districts, would perhaps be found here more strongly manifested, as the region is so much nearer to Bactria; but strange to say this influence can scarcely be traced in either of the two statues. The rigid mannerism of the drapery is the same as we find on the Indian side of the Indus. The suggestion which offers itself to account for this is, that the sculptor, or sculptors, were brought from India, and that the design was not produced by the local artists. Sir Vincent Eyre noticed in his visit the small holes which are represented in the drawing of this figure, and he makes the following remarks regarding them:\u2014\u201cOne circumstance struck me as remarkable, which was, that in all those parts where the limbs are deficient, there are regular rows of small holes, in which pieces of wood have been struck, for the evident purpose of making plaster adhere. From this it would appear either that an attempt had been made to restore the mutilated parts by these means, or that the figure was originally only partially sculptured in the rock, and the deficiencies made up with plaster in the manner I have mentioned.\u201d The soldiers of Timur-lang may have shot arrows, and the artillerymen of Nadir Shah may have fired cannon at the\ncelebrated idols, this being what the people of the locality believe, but no one would have taken the trouble since the Mohammedan period to make any repairs; we can only suppose that these efforts date back to the time when there were Buddhist monks at Bamian. If the small holes had been all over the figure, it might have been supposed that it had been covered with metal; but we can perceive in the drawing, as Sir Vincent Eyre says, that they are only on the mutilated parts. It will be seen from the drawing that both Burnes and Sir Vincent Eyre correctly described this statue as having the upper part of the face destroyed, the mouth being the only feature which had been preserved. Captain Talbot measured this figure with the theodolite, and gives the height as 173 feet; it must be the highest statue known, and a good notion of its size may be formed by comparing it with the London Monument, which is only about 27 feet greater in height; or the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square, it being 170 feet, or 3 feet less than the statues.\n\nPlate VI. represents the smaller statue, which stands, as already stated, about 400 yards to the right of the larger one, and is 120 feet high; this has been generally known as the \"female idol,\" but it is now evident that Hiuen Tsiang had correctly described it as \"a figure of Sakya Buddha.\" He also describes it as being formed of metal, \"it has been cast in different parts and joined together;\" the folds of the drapery are yet so carefully given in the figure, that we must suppose it had only been covered with a thin plating of metal, and not with plates which had been cast; this is confirmed by the absence of holes or any indications by which heavy pieces of metal could have been fastened and supported. The larger figure was in all probability gilt, for the pilgrim says that \"its golden hues sparkle on every side,\" and whatever metal was used in the smaller figure, must have been so thin, that it was made to keep its place by means of some adhesive substance. Captain Talbot says that in both figures \"the finishing, drapery, etc., was all added by putting on stucco.\" This is all but decisive against\nBamian. The Second Statue.\nBamian. The Fourth Statue; and Caves.\ncast metal plates being fixed on it; as there would have been, in such a case, no need to finish the details with stucco. There are stairs cut in the rock, by means of which visitors can ascend, and look out at the head of the statue, and the opening above the crown is represented in the drawing. Captain Talbot states that the passage to the top is still accessible, and from the context of his brief statement we are led to suppose that it was by this means Captain Maitland was able to measure the statue with a tape.\n\nPlate VII. gives us what, in comparison to the colossal figures beside it, we must call a small statue. Still it is described by Captain Talbot as being between 25 and 30 feet high; he thinks that it had been prepared for stucco, which had never been put on; but the greater probability, judging from the size of the holes to be seen all over the figures, and the strength of the wooden pegs they would have held, that this figure might have been covered with metal. The holes show that it never had details either of face or drapery, and such being the case, these would be all given on the outer covering of metal. If this has been the case, it reduces the Chinese Pilgrim's blunder to smaller dimensions; he would thus be only wrong as to which figure, but right that at least one of them, was metallic. The relative position of this figure is on the left of the smaller statue; it is included in the general view of the caves.\n\nThe remains of painting found in the Jalalabad Valley were very few and fragmentary, but judging from what there was, as well as by the forms in the sketches of Captain Maitland from Bamian, we see that what is known as the Greek influence was confined to the architecture and sculpture, and that the style of painting had never been affected by it. The paintings in the Tibetan monasteries of the present day bear a strong resemblance to these fragments from Bamian, and the art on them is no doubt a continuation of the older school. In one of the fragments, Fig. 3, Plate VIII., there is a form already referred to by me when dealing with Captain Talbot's drawings. It is the form given in Plate I. Figs. 7, 9, and 14. In the painting it is\nshown as supported on two pillars. I have a piece of sculpture from Hada, in which this same arrangement is represented, but with the difference that the columns have well-defined Corinthian capitals.\n\nWILLIAM SIMPSON.\n\n[N.B.\u2014A second letter from Capt. Talbot has come to hand since receipt of the others. As it gives probably the first account of the \"Takht-i-Rustam\" in this locality, it is now published with the drawings which accompanied it. Haibak, I may mention, is on the road from Bamian to the Oxus, and as there are many groups of caves along the whole route, the paper in question appears an appropriate addendum to those preceding it.\u2014W.S.]\n\nLETTER.\n\nCamp, Kilif, March 2nd.\n\nMy Dear Simpson,\n\nI hope my letter from Bamian way reached you safely and proved interesting. I have not much more to add. At Haibak, about two miles west of the fort, is a very curious place called Takht-i-Rustam. Possibly it has been fully described before; but in case it has not, I send you a plan and description. [See figures on opposite page, Pl. IX.]\n\nIt is entirely cut out of the rock; there has been no building up whatever. Simply the top of a rocky hillock has been cut into the shape I describe. It is not situated on quite the highest point of the hillock, and could never have been intended for a fortification of any sort.\n\nIt consists of an annular ditch cut out of the rock to a varying depth on the west side, at perhaps its deepest point. I found it to be $38\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. from the top of the counterscarp, to use a military term. The conical mass of rock left standing in the centre has been levelled to form a circular platform about 70 ft. in diameter, the top of the scarp being neatly bevelled off. In the centre of the platform stands a rectangular house, also cut out of the solid rock. A doorway and passage from the south side leads into a circular domed\nTakhti Rustam near Haibak.\n\nM. G. Talbot, Capt., R.E.\nchamber 6 ft. in diameter and 6 ft. 6 ins. high. You will see that in my drawings there is a discrepancy as to the situation of the passage. I am pretty sure that the enlarged elevation shows the position of the doorway correctly, and also that the plan is correct as to the way the passage leads into the chamber. I must therefore have got my dimensions wrong, or the chamber cannot be situated exactly in the centre.\n\nI presume that this is a sort of tope, and that the chamber contained an image of Buddha, but you know my opinion is not worth much, and as I send you all I know about it, you can draw your own conclusions.\n\nThis central platform and house is quite perfect, and made with great care and neatness. Access is had to it from the north side by means of holes cut in the escarp, similar to those in a gymnasium for escalading exercise, which enable anybody to climb up from the ditch, which is here less than 20 ft. deep, I should guess. The bottom of the ditch is irregular in width and slope. The ditch is deepest on the west side, and slopes up to the east from both sides. The scarp is perfect in all but one place, where a small portion of rock has fallen away. On the east side are the remains of caves cut in the counterscarp, looking inwards, and on about the level of the platform. Most of them have fallen in.\n\nAccess is had to the ditch by two passages cut in the rock on the west side. The northern of these issues is some 6 ft. above the level of the ditch, for what object I cannot conceive; the other issues are at the level of the bottom of the ditch.\n\nThese passages issue from the ditch on to a platform cut out of the rock. The rock is of a grey colour, and does not look very hard, but has weathered well. I am not geologist enough to say what it is.\n\nAt the foot of a neighbouring hill, some 300 yards off, are some half dozen more caves facing towards the Takht. I should be glad to hear if you know of any similar place.\n\nNear the road from Haibak to T\u00e1shkurgh\u00e1n is a place called Haz\u00e1rsam, or 1000 caves. It consists of a large\nnumber of caves excavated in low cliffs, 10 to 20 ft. high, surrounding a depression in undulating ground. It is 18 to 20 miles from Takht-i-Rustam. Many of the caves have fallen in. Those that remain seem to be nearly all of one plan\u2014a large outer room leading by an archway into a smaller room approaching a square in plan. In some cases the outer room has small rooms leading off from it; and in several cases contiguous outer rooms are connected with one another by side passages in an irregular sort of way. Altogether they seemed to be nearer the pattern of Vihara caves than anything else I have seen.\n\n[The larger of these figures represents the plan of the cave.\n\nThe smaller approximately illustrates a niche which the writer noticed at the inner end of the inner chamber.]\n\nThe outer doorways have most fallen in, and in none could I trace any definite shape; but the doorways into the inner rooms are mostly perfect and vary in shape: as a rule they have a niche on each side of them. I show two patterns of doorways and the position of the side niches. The niches also vary in shape: some are as I have tried to draw.\n\nYou must understand that when I draw an arch, I mean it to be symmetrical, though I fear I am not often successful.\nThe walls of both outer and inner rooms were originally covered with plaster, of which a good deal remains, showing ornamental designs and remains of colour. In one case I noticed something very like a fleur-de-lis. My usual complaint of want of time holds good here: I only had half an hour to visit these caves. It would have taken a whole day to do them properly. There are a great number of them.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nM. G. Talbot.\n\nAdditional Note on Bamian by Capt. P. J. Maitland.\n\nThe Bamian valley is about half a mile broad and well cultivated, but there is no town or even central agglomeration of houses, only small villages scattered up and down the valley. To the north is a fairly continuous wall of cliffs averaging about 300 feet in height; to the south is a central plateau separated by the glens called Dahaneh-i-T\u00e1jik and Dahaneh-i-Saidabad from the cliffs limiting the western and eastern part of the valley. On the edge of the central plateau is a small, conical, clayey hill, covered with the ruins of Ghulgulah. This is probably the ancient Bamian.\n\nThe cliffs are everywhere pierced with numerous caves, but the greatest number is found on the north side of the valley, and here are also the famous idols, the B\u00fat-i-Bamian. The cliffs round these are literally honeycombed with caves, which are found even in the d\u00e9bris slope at the bottom. They are almost all inhabited by Tajiks, or used as store-rooms, and the entrance is frequently protected by a low mud wall.\n\nFacing the cliff the larger of the two big idols is to the left, the other to the right. They are about a quarter of a mile apart and supposed to be male and female, and their heights are respectively 180 and 120 feet. Their names are, as reported by former travellers, Sal S\u00e1l for the male and Sh\u00e1h Mameh for the female figure. The idols are standing figures, sculptured in very bold relief in deep niches. Between the two large idols are, or rather were, two smaller ones, also in niches. These are equidistant from the large idols and\nfrom each other, that is to say, there is about 150 yards between each of the niches, large and small. One of the smaller niches is about 60 to 70 feet high, and is now empty, though a close inspection shows fragments of the idol that once filled it. The second small niche is still occupied by a sitting figure, which is about 40 feet high and known as the Bacheh, or child. The general shape of the niches is the same in all cases, but that of the large female figure is evidently unfinished, and the shoulders are not marked, nor the edges smoothed off.\n\nThe depth of the niches of the two large idols is about twice the thickness of the figures standing in them: the latter are therefore fairly well protected from the weather, and this accounts for their excellent preservation, nearly all the damage done to them being due to the hand of man. The whole interior of the niches, and particularly the arches over the heads of the idols, have been painted with what appears to be allegorical designs. Although much damaged, in fact, obliterated, where they could be easily got at, enough remains to show the general style of the work, which is exceedingly well executed, and forcibly reminds one of what is generally understood to be Byzantine art.\n\nThe idols themselves are rather clumsy figures, roughly hewn in the tough conglomerate rock, and afterwards thickly overlaid with stucco, in which all the details are executed. The whole arrangement clearly shows that this was not done at a later period, but is part of the original design of the figures. The stucco appears to have been painted, or at least paint was used in some places. The features of the figures have been purposely destroyed, and the legs of the larger one have been partly knocked away, it is said by cannon-shot fired at it by Nadir Shah. Both idols are draped in garments reaching to below the knee. The limbs and contour of the body show through, and the general effect of muslin is excellently imitated in the stucco. The arms of both are bent at the elbow, the forearms and the hands projecting, but the latter are now broken off. The feet have also been battered out of shape.\nNarrow stairways hewn in the interior of the rock lead up from cave to cave to the heads of the idols, and even to the summit of the hill.\n\nThe caves, though so numerous, are not large. By far the greater portion of them are chambers 12 to 14 feet square, with domed roofs. I think as a rule several chambers open into each other, and have a wide portico in front by which light is admitted to the doorways. These have generally round arches. There are certainly no pointed arches anywhere, but some of the openings may be square-headed. The domes are set on the four-sided chambers in a remarkable manner, the square being reduced to an octagon by cornices springing by tiers from the angles in unmistakeable imitation of brick-work. (See Plate X., also Plate I. Figs. 17, 18 and 19.) It is a very curious fact that at Kandahar domes are to this day commonly built on brick-built square chambers in exactly the same fashion. One of the roofs seen was of a different kind, flat and divided into four by deep wide cuts, crossing each other in the centre. Small cupolas were hewn in the centre of each of the spaces and at the intersection of the cuts. The largest cave of all is said to be between the feet of the great idol, but like several others it is used for government stores, and was filled with lucerne, etc. We saw no Vihara caves, but some are said to exist. As above mentioned, the majority of the caves are inhabited. A few years ago it is said they all were. The interiors are plain, without sculptural ornamentation, and now completely smoke-blackened. The whole, however, were plastered with stucco and painted. In one of the upper caves, near the head of the female idol, some designs are still visible.\n\nA short distance east of the female idol, near the foot of the cliff, is a mound, which seems to be the remains of a Buddhist tope.\n\nA design on the arch over the female idol can, to a certain extent, be made out with a field-glass. Within a circle is a figure in a long robe with a spear, apparently slaying something. The two upper corners without the circle are filled\nwith figures of angels or cherubs, waving scarves at each other. They might well date from the last century. On either side is a border with male and female busts or half-figures in circles, and all adorned with halos. Outside the central design on the left-hand side is a very curious figure of a human-headed bird.\n\nOn the east side of the Saidabad glen is an idol, which does not appear to have been noticed by former travellers. It is somewhere up the cliff, which is pierced with numerous caves. The niche is 40 to 60 feet high, and the figure in it has its head covered with a sort of cap or tiara. The two big idols may possibly have been adorned in like manner; the top of their heads is now unnaturally flat, suggesting the idea that something has been cut off.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the caves are very dark, only a small doorway admits light, and without candles, or rather good lanterns, nothing can be seen. The stairways are always very narrow and steep. There is almost invariably a shallow recess opposite the doorway. No traces of doors were seen.\n\nNote.\u2014These letters have been following one another at intervals during the last two or three months, and this latest communication from Captain Maitland it was necessary to give at the last moment, as it becomes the text to his own sketches; more particularly as it adds to our scant knowledge of Bamian. With the letters Captain Maitland has sent drawings of the peculiar roof partially described by Captain Talbot (see p. 326), and these make the form of the roof now perfectly clear; but it is a form quite new to us, and as yet I would not venture on an opinion as to its origin. When Captain Maitland speaks of the \"male\" and the \"female\" in relation to the two large statues, it should be understood that he is only using these terms as they have long been applied to them by the natives of the locality. We have the authority of Hiuen Tsiang that the smaller figure, the so-called \"female idol,\" was Buddha, and Captain Maitland's drawing of it perfectly confirms this. The statement that the stairs lead up to the summit of the cliff becomes a slight confirmation of my guess that the mounds on the summit are the remains of Stupas.\u2014W.S.\nART. XV.\u2014The Sumerian Language and its Affinities. By Prof. Dr. Fritz Hommel, of Munich. Communicated by Dr. Rost, Hon. Member R.A.S.\n\nOf all the known languages of the world, Sumerian may undoubtedly be regarded as the oldest. We possess now inscriptions (e.g. of the ancient Chaldean King Ur-ganna of Sirgulla) which are of an even earlier date than the time of the half-mythical Egyptian King Menes. Our sources for the knowledge of this language\u2014the language of the founders of the Babylonian civilization\u2014are twofold, namely: a long series of bilingual incantations, hymns, psalms, etc., preserved in late copies, giving the original text, line for line, with its Semitic (Babylonian or Assyrian) translation; and a great many inscriptions, in Sumerian only, of the early kings, most of them very short, but some of considerable length. The latter are, as a rule, full of still puzzling and obscure passages, as well as difficult grammatical forms. Nevertheless, they sometimes confirm many points of grammar found in the bilingual texts, which themselves necessarily form the starting-point of our grammatical and philological explorations of this language, and which are so numerous, that we can easily gain from them alone a clear and nearly complete idea of the very interesting idiom in which they are written. Of great help also in our investigations are the lexicographical and grammatical tablets of the Assyrian libraries,\u2014which, however, being simply compilations made long after the language had ceased to exist, must be sometimes used with caution.\n\nSo different are the roots, forms, and syntax of the Sumerian from the Semitic tongues, that, at the very outset, such eminent scholars as Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Dr. Hincks, and\nothers thought it to be more or less connected with the so-called Turanian languages. The term Turanian comprising, as it does, two great groups of cognate\u2014though only loosely cognate\u2014languages, namely, the Ugro-Finnic (Uralic) and the Mongolian-Turco-Tartaric (Altaic) families, was, however, too vague. It was with the first-named group that the late F. Lenormant declared the Sumerian to have the closest connection. Since the rejection of this theory of Lenormant in 1881 by Dr. Donner, the eminent Ugro-Finnish scholar, the question seemed to be set at rest, at least with regard to the Ugro-Finnish group of languages; but it really opened afresh the question of the true position of Sumerian among the languages of the world.\n\nIn the following pages I shall try to show that this important question can be fully settled. That branch of the Turanian family, which geographically was the nearest neighbour of the Old Sumerians, the Turko-Tatars, with the Mongols, was also linguistically nearest akin. This fact will be fully proved by phonology, grammar, syntax and dictionary.\n\nWith regard to phonology and dictionary, we must start from the development found in the texts themselves. Beside the Old Sumerian (the contemporaneous inscriptions of kings, and the bilingual incantations), we possess, also, later texts, which seemed at the first glance to be intermixed with dialectical forms (Sayce, Lenormant, Pinches, Haupt); these are, however, as I have in my latest works pointed out, in reality, Neo-Sumerian. Professor Haupt, who found out, after Sayce, Lenormant and Pinches, but as I am now convinced, quite independently, this difference in the lexicographical lists and then in the texts, was the first to treat of them, and gave the principal facts in a little paper published in the G\u00f6ttinger Gel. Anzeigen. He was, however, wrong in thinking the Old Sumerian forms (Dr. Haupt's Accadian) to be the later ones, and the Neo-Sumerian (by him called dialectic, or Sumerian absolutely) the earliest stage of the language; the great step forward which he made in our knowledge of Sumerian on the one\nside was, at the same time, a deplorable retrogression on the other.\n\nI do not intend to give, in the following, a complete grammar of the Sumerian in its historical development, but it will be necessary to give here at great length at least the introduction to such a grammar, viz. the principal facts of phonology. That I have been able to add to it greatly since the works of Sayce and Haupt, everybody will clearly see, on comparing the new principles, used in it, with the former treatment of this subject.\n\nThe Sumerian vowels are \\(a\\), \\(i\\), and \\(u\\). It is probable that, in the later language, \\(a\\) became \\(e\\) in many cases, but we never find it indicated by writing. The same is the case with the change from \\(u\\) to \\(o\\). The change from \\(u\\) to \\(\u00fc\\), however, is more certain, because we very often find \\(i\\) for \\(u\\), even in the Older\\(^1\\) Sumerian, the middle-form being, of course, \\(\u00fc\\). This change (\\(u\\) to \\(i\\)) seems to have become, in Neo-Sumerian, a general law of sound, and so, also, we find it very often in the Turkish languages, e.g. yol-duz beside yildis \u2018star\u2019 (comp. Sum. gul \u2018star,\u2019 the supposed oldest form of Neo-Sum. vul), oghul, oghlu \u2018son,\u2019 Chuvassian \u016by\u016bl (comp. Neo-Sum. ibilla, the supposed Old Sum. form being ugulla), il \u2018land\u2019 (Sum. ur \u2018place, town\u2019), er \u2018man\u2019 (Sum. ur), g\u00fcn \u2018day\u2019 (Sum. kun \u2018to become clear\u2019), etc. Originally, all these vowels were short, long ones having only come into existence by contraction, e.g. dingirra or dingirri \u2018God,\u2019 with the plural-suffix -ini: dingirrtni, or by accent, e.g. adda \u2018father,\u2019 add\u0101mu \u2018my father.\u2019 The same is the case in the Turkish languages, where also the long vowels have only grown out of contraction, e.g. t\u014dz \u2018dust\u2019 out of toghoz (comp. Mong. toghosu-n, Neo-Sum. saghar, originally daghash). As for the so-called vowel harmony, which we find, to a great extent, also in Sumerian, especially in the later language, it will be sufficient here only to quote forms like ki-ti for ki-ta\n\n\\(^1\\) I call thus the language of the epoch of Gudla and of the incantations as they have come down to us. The oldest forms I call Old Sumerian, and the later (the so-called dialectic or imisal), Neo-Sumerian.\n'down,' nim-gir instead of nam-gir 'lightning,' ush-bu 'his persecutor' (for ush-bi), mun-du-tutuddi 'he enters' (for mun-da-tutuddi), etc. etc. In most cases, however, the historical old form is written, though in speaking the vowels were assimilated, as this must be concluded by the mere existence of the above-quoted forms.\n\nThe original consonants are k, g, \u1e63 or gh, t, d, b, m, n, z, s, \u1e63, r, l; but k and t are only found at the beginning of the word or syllable, at least in Old Sumerian, and here very rarely, as most of the independent roots with these initial consonants begin with the so-called tenuis. There must have existed, even in older Sumerian, besides these, a consonantal y (indicated only by a following i instead of a) for an original r, n, l or g, e.g. gal-i, i.e. gayi, for galla 'great,' in-i, i.e. igi, for inna or inni 'lord,' etc.; then ng (only after a vowel), e.g. dingir 'God' (comp. tengri), kingi-n, kingi 'land' (from the words din 'spirit' and kin), and v (between two vowels) for original b, e.g. in the proper name Ur-Ba'u 'man of the goddess Ba'u or Bohu,' followed by the genitive-postposition -gi, Ur-Ba-bi-gi, of course spoken Ur-Bavi-gi.\n\nIn Neo-Sumerian, this pronunciation of b as v seems to have become quite general, as also that of m as v, and is at the same time the reason why m and b are so often confounded in the writing of the hymns and psalms. The same must have been the case, at a certain period, in the Turkish languages, for it is only by this law that such forms as gib, beside gim (also kep) 'like' (orig. 'to form, to model'), moi (so in Yakute) beside buyu-n\n\n1 Also in the Turkish family of languages we find this tendency to change l in y, e.g. yuy-mak 'to wash' (comp. Sum. lug), yay-mak 'to spread out, to foot' (comp. Sum. tal 'to hang up, to spread out, to put down'). As for r and n to y, these two sounds became, of course, at first l before they became y, for which change (r to l, and n to l) we have numerous analogies already in Older Sumerian, still more in Neo-Sumerian and in Turkish; comp. Sum. gir 'foot,' Mong. gil; Sum. ur 'foundation,' Turk. ul; Sum. shur 'to cry,' Turk. soy-la-mek 'to speak'; Sum. dur, dir 'full,' Turk. dolu; Sum. bar 'side, heart,' Turk. bel 'loins, midst'; Sum. nigin 'circle, to collect, assemble,' Turk. yigil, iyil 'to assemble, to go round about'; Sum. gun 'neck,' Turk. buy-un; ansuh 'ass,' Mong. els-i-gen (Turk. eshe-k); nin 'four,' Chagat. nil-au 'the fourth'; Mong. nogai, nochoi 'dog,' Neo-Sum. lug, lig, etc. etc.\n'neck,' *mis* beside *bis* 'we,' and other examples,\u00b9 are to be explained.\n\nThe above-quoted form *kep*, beside *gib* and *gin* (in the Turkish languages, especially those of Southern Siberia), which is a hardening of the two tenues *g* and *b*, leads us to an important observation for the phonology of Sumerian\u2014I mean the hardening of *g*, *b*, *d* and *z* into *k*, *p*, *t* and *s*, not expressed by the writing (for here the historical old forms with the tenues were kept), but shown by a great many words, borrowed from Sumerian, in the Semitic Babylonian language. Thus, *guz* 'throne, seat,' became with the Semites *kussu*, *Gud\u00faa Kut\u00fa* (the biblical Kutha), *Agadi Akkadu* (the bibl. Akkad); *Zimbir sippar*, *zabar* 'brass' *siparru*; *azag* 'fever' *asakku*; *madda* 'land' *matu*, etc. For the Turkish languages may also be compared the following instances: Sum. *gash* 'two' *iki(s)*, *gug* 'sheep' *koyun*, *gaz* (Neo-Sum. *uz*) 'goat' *kechi* (also *kech-ki* and *ech-ki* occur), *dingir* 'God' *Tengri*, *adda* 'father' *ata*, *gi\u0161* 'man' *ki\u0161i*, *bar* 'to be bright' *par-la-mak*, *tig* 'to touch' *tek-mek*, *gin* 'straight, right' *k\u00fcni*, *gush* (Old Sum. *gu*, Neo-Sum. *vush-in*) 'bird' *kush*, *bad* 'to go away, to withdraw' *batar* 'west, sunset,' *dugun* (Neo-Sum. *dubin*) 'nail of the finger, claw, hoof,' *toyn-ak*, etc.\n\nThis hardening seems to have taken place in all cases where no other alterations of the above-named four consonants occurred, namely:\n\n- *g* to *gv* and *v* (written *b* or *m*), *y*, and, lastly, to *sh* and to *d* (the latter rather a alternation of two different sound classes, not a natural change)\u2014instead of *g* to *k*;\n- *d* to *\u1e0d* (the weak Engl. *th*), *z* and further *s*\u2014instead of *d* into *t*;\n- *z* (also *\u015b*, *s*) to *r* (so-called rhotacism)\u2014instead of *z* to *s*;\n- and, finally, *b* to *v*, or else to a mere spiritus lenis.\n\nOf these changes, that of *g* to *v*, of *g* (also *k*) to *sh*, and *d* to *s*, are only met with in Neo-Sumerian, the rest existed\n\n\u00b9 It must not be confounded with this, if even in the Oldest Sumerian we find the verbal subject-prefix *mun* beside *ban* (from the pronominal stem of the 3rd person sing. *ba*); we have here the same law of sound as in the Turkish *mun-da* for *bun-da* (or *ban-da*), comp.

The transition \\( r \\) to \\( i \\) to \\( d \\) is very common already in Older Sumerian.\ng) For b to v or spiritus lenis: bad 'to name' (Neo-Sum. pad), Turk. at 'name'; ubur 'bosom, breast,' Turk. obur 'nurse' (i.e. breast-giving), Tung. uwur 'bosom,' Mong. \u00f6b\u00fcr, \u00f6ber, and Magyar \u00f6b\u00f6l the same, comp. also ga in the optative, for which we find sometimes a-, the supposed middle form being va-, etc.\n\nOne remarkable sound-law, of which traces are also found in the Turkish languages,\u2014namely, the change of n between two vowels to ng, and lastly (in Neo-Sumerian) to m, has still to be noticed, e.g. din 'spirit,' ding-ir 'God' (Turk.-Mong. tengri), Neo-Sum. dimir; inna-gar 'he makes,' inga-gar, imma-gar; kin 'land,' kingi-n 'land,' Neo-Sum. shingir and \u0161umir; for these comp. the Turk. domuz 'pig,' beside the older durguz. Other Turkish words seem to show the same formation as in kungur 'yellow-brown,' shingir 'fortress,' etc. In closest connexion with this change is another, namely, that n after a vowel, especially at the end of the word or root, becomes m, even in Older Sumerian, but more commonly in Neo-Sumerian, e.g. alan 'statue,' Neo-Sum. alam; sun 'to give,' already in Older Sumer. sum; anna 'mother' (Turk. ana), Neo-Sum. amma, am (comp. the Ural. em\u00e4); kan 'gate,' later kam, kav (comp. Turk. kapu-k, kapu); kan, kam (in nu-kamma) 'priest, sorcerer,' Turk. kam 'priest' (our-Germ. 'Schamane'); \u0161isin 'seven,' still preserved in Ural. sisem; comp. also the Turkish nominal-suffix -m (e.g. tarim 'cultivated' from tari-mak) besides the more common -n, etc., etc.\n\nBefore we go on to the various forms of the Sumerian grammar and their coincidences with those of the Turkish languages, we must remark, that the numerous instances given above in the treatment of the phonology would of themselves be sufficient to prove a close relationship between the two idioms Sumerian and Turko-Mongolian. Let us now see how far the rules we have laid down in treating of the phonology and dictionary are confirmed by the grammar of the two languages.\n\nWe are quite right if we say, that in Sumerian 'head' was called sag, 'good' dug, 'great' gal, 'to make' gar, at least\ntheoretically. But if these words\u2014as mostly happens\u2014be used independently, they are always written and spoken with a following \\(a\\), the so-called state of prolongation, e.g. sagga, dugga, galla, garra; but in composition, and if the verbs have subject- and object-prefixes before them, the original root-form comes to light, e.g. sag-gigga \u2018head-ache,\u2019 ur-dugga \u2018a good man\u2019 (from urru \u2018man\u2019), in-gar \u2018he made\u2019 (but, if alone, then always garra \u2018he made\u2019; in-garra, opposite to in-gar, is \u2018he makes (now)\u2019). In the Turkish languages we find still traces of this peculiar fuller form of words, not only in some of the oldest and most common nouns, e.g. giche \u2018night\u2019 (Sum. gig), ata \u2018father\u2019 (Sum. adda), ana \u2018mother\u2019 (Sum. anna), ki\u0161i \u2018man\u2019 (Sum. gi\u0161), kuni \u2018straight, upright, right\u2019 (Sum. ginna or ginni), etc., but also in the vocative (comp. Vambery, Uigurische Sprachmonumente, p. 37), and especially in the so-called gerundive of the Eastern and Siberian Turkish idioms, preserved in Western Turkish even now before the endings of conjugation.\n\nConcerning the formation of nouns and adjectives by external elements, we have a prefixed vowel in one case only. It is a repetition of the root-vowel, but was originally, as it seems, an \\(a\\), e.g. bur \u2018vessel,\u2019 ubur \u2018breast, bosom\u2019 (Turk. obur the same); nim \u2018to be high,\u2019 inim \u2018high,\u2019 and many other instances. That we have (beside the above-quoted ubur) still traces of this formation in the Turanian languages, esp. before \\(r\\), e.g. irak beside rak \u2018wide\u2019 (comp. Sum. rag the same), but also in other cases, the late Fran\u00e7. Lenormant has already shown. Further research will, I am convinced, find out many more instances in the Altaic idioms, though those already quoted are sufficient to show the striking coincidence. Beside this prefixed vowel, we have still some substantives and pronouns, forming, with a noun or adjective, abstracts (so ki \u2018place,\u2019 nan or nam \u2018destiny, thing\u2019) or agent nouns (nomina agentis, so nin \u2018what,\u2019 Neo-Sum. yim, im, and nu, Neo-Sum. lu \u2018somebody,\u2019 orig. \u2018man\u2019), e.g. ki-agga\n\n1 Words having \\(u\\) or \\(i\\) as root-vowel often take, in the state of prolongation, the same vowel instead of the usual \\(a\\) (vowel harmony); for such forms as gar-i (gayi) for garra, sag-i (sayi) for sagga, see above, p. 364.\n'love' from ag 'to love,' nam-tilla 'life' from til, ti 'to live,' nin-gulla 'hostile' from gul 'to be hostile,' lu-kamma 'sorcerer' from kam 'to bespeak,' etc. That these are not real prefixes (which would be contradictory to the tendency of the agglutinative character of the Sumerian and the whole Turanian family) will easily be seen from their original meaning (e.g. 'place of loving,' 'destiny of living,' 'whatever is hostile,' 'whoever is bespeaking'). The only strange thing is the position of the genitive and adjective after the noun, so common in Sumerian, even in the oldest period; but when the Sumerian says urra-anna 'servant of heaven,' this is an abbreviation of urra-ann\u00e2-gi (with the postposition, in Turkish -ing), and when he says dingir-gal-gallini-ta (not dingirra-gallini-ta!) = god + doubled adjective + plural ending + postposition, i.e. 'from the great gods,' it is quite another way of putting the adjective, as e.g. in the Semitic ina il\u00e2ni rab\u00fbti; comp. also ur-gall\u00e2-ba-ku 'to its great foundation place' with Semitic ana i\u0161di-\u0161u rabi.\n\nReal suffixes however are -gal (Neo-Sum. -val, -ul, orig. 'being') and -tug, -tu (Neo-Sum. -ti), orig. 'possessing,' e.g. gul-gal 'hostile,' a-tug (from a 'might, power') 'mighty,' etc.; comp. the endings -ul (e.g. kara-ul 'watchman') and -ti (e.g. kabor-ti 'sedition, trouble') in Eastern Turki (from kara-mak 'to look' and kabor-mak 'to make a noise').\n\nOther suffixes are the inseparable endings -g (Neo-Sum. -k), -n (sometimes -m), -r (sometimes -l) and -\u0161, with which so many roots are compounded, e.g. dini-g 'mighty,' utug (beside ud) 'sun,' bala-g 'hatchet,' \u0161ili-g 'leader,' annag 'tin,' biri-g (Semitic gunnu\u015fu), Illa-g and Karra-g, names of towns, etc.; sagi-n 'bright' (from sag), timi-n 'foundation' (from tim, ti), sumu-n 'old,' giri-n 'fruit,' nig\u00ee-n 'circle,' etc.; ama-r 'young bull' (from am 'ox'), sa\u011far 'bright' (Neo-Sum. zabar, from zag), aga-r 'field' (from ag 'to make'), dingi-r 'God' (from din 'spirit'), gubu-r 'low land,' sumu-r (Semitic kimmatu), etc.; am\u00e2\u0161 'hurdle for cattle' (from am 'ox'), gurus 'high' (from gur 'to elevate'), sigi-\u0161 'offering,' 'libation' (from sig, si 'to pour out,' perhaps a secondary Neo-Sumerian formation from diri-g 'full,' which perhaps\nbecame siyeg, sig, as girin could become giyin, gin), gara-\u0161 \u2018straw\u2019 (from gar \u2018to build\u2019), igi-\u0161 \u2018eye\u2019 (Turk. g\u00f6s), sunu\u0161, giri\u0161, za\u011fa\u0161 and some others. Now, the same elements are found to form the nouns in the Turk languages, e.g. bili-k \u2018knowledge\u2019 (from bil-mek \u2018to know\u2019), doda-k \u2018lip\u2019 (comp. Neo-Sum. su), ulu-k \u2018great\u2019 (from ul \u2018great,\u2019 comp. Sum. gal, Neo-Sum. vul), e\u0161e-k \u2018ass\u2019 (from e\u0161\u0161e, e\u0161\u0161e, en\u0161e, comp. Sum. an\u0161i and Mong. eldsi-gen), jaru-k \u2018bright\u2019 (comp. Sum. gar \u2018to be bright\u2019), etc.; tuka-n \u2018thorn\u2019 (from t\u00fck-mak \u2018to sew, to fix\u2019), qula-n \u2018wild ass\u2019 (from qula \u2018reddish dun\u2019), koyu-n \u2018sheep\u2019 (Mong. khoni-n,1 comp. Sum. gug, Neo-Sum. udub, idib), etc.;2 yasha-r \u2018aged\u2019 (from ya\u0161 \u2018age\u2019),3 timu-r \u2018iron,\u2019 baki-r \u2018copper,\u2019 chuqu-r \u2018a pit, a depression,\u2019 gotu-r \u2018itch,\u2019 Mong. edo-r \u2018day\u2019 (Sum. ud \u2018day,\u2019 Uig. \u00fct, \u011bt \u2018time\u2019), as also some nouns and adj. in -il (out of -ir), e.g. yeshi-l \u2018green,\u2019 kisil \u2018red,\u2019 etc.; yaua-\u0161 \u2018slow,\u2019 tini-\u0161 \u2018a sigh\u2019 (from tin-mak \u2018to sigh\u2019), tapu-\u0161 \u2018earnings, gain\u2019 (from tap-mak \u2018to find\u2019), as also some words ending in -s, -s, e.g. khoros-s \u2018cock,\u2019 saky-s \u2018resin,\u2019 etc.\n\nThe pronouns of the 1st and 2nd person were in Sumerian originally man and san, as is seen from the writing mal-i and zal-i (pronounced mayi, sayi), comp. Turkish men and sen; the pronouns for the 3rd person are ini \u2018he\u2019 (plural ini-nini) and nan, both used absolutely, and ni \u2018this,\u2019 in connection with substantives. ji \u2018he, it,\u2019 the Turkish -ki in mening-ki \u2018the mine\u2019 (lit. I-of-that, i.e. that of mine) is very seldom used in Sumerian. The possessive suffixes are -mu \u2018my,\u2019 -zu \u2018thy,\u2019 -ni \u2018his,\u2019 -bi \u2018its,\u2019 \u0161in, \u0161i \u2018he, it\u2019 (only as subject prefix before verbs). Now we have in the Turkish exactly the same distribution of pronominal stems:\n\nm for the 1st,4 z for the 2nd, n, b, and \u0161 (or s) for the 3rd\n\n---\n\n1 Originally khongi-n, comp. the Mong. genitive ending -in, -un with the Turk. -ing (Sum. -gi).\n2 The Turkish participle in -an belongs also here; also some words ending in -m (e.g. yat\u0131-m \u2018position,\u2019 soku-m \u2018a fat ox,\u2019 tari-m \u2018cultivated,\u2019 in which the concluding -m (as in Neo-Sumerian) has originated from -n.\n3 Compare also the Turkish participle in -r, forming with the pronominal endings the present of the verb.\n4 I take this occasion to make some remarks on the so-called subject- and object-prefixes of the verb. The Sumerian can say, besides the simple garra \u2018he made\u2019 (lit. making scil. was he), also, fuller, \u2018him (or it) he made,\u2019 in the order,\nperson; compare ol, gen. an-ung 'he' absolutely, bu 'this' (as adjective, comp. in Sum. -ni 'his,' but -bi 'its'), \u0161u 'this,' and -si 'his' as suffix after vowel stems beside -ni after consonant stems. Very remarkable, also, is the fact, that in Sumerian, as in Turki, every pronoun-stem can be strengthened by n, e.g. ma-n 'I,' za-n 'thou,' na-n 'he,' \u0161in (later \u0161ib) 'he,' nin (later nib) 'he,' ba-n (later mu-n) 'it' (accusative only and in most cases neuter), ra-n (later ra-b) out of za-n (za-b) 'thee,' as is also the case with the verbal stem elements ta, da, ra, which occur usually in the fuller forms tan-, dan-, -ran (later tab, dab, rab), e.g. ba-ra-uddu '(he) it brings out' and ba-ran-uddu, ib-tan-gar (as only ib-ta-gar), etc. etc.\n\nThe interrogative pronouns are aba 'who' (probably from aga) and mi'a, ana 'what,' the indefinite nami 'some one,' nin 'somewhat, anything'; comp. Turki na (Osm. ne) 'what?' kim 'who' (from ki-me, comp. nime beside ne), nime 'what?' neme-r-se 'what it may be' (neme+er-se, the latter 'it may be').\n\nThe Numerals have already been referred to when discussing the phonology, and they would alone be sufficient to prove the closest relationship of Sumerian with Turki. They are, shortly repeated, gi\u0161 (bir) one, as also a\u0161 (comp. a\u0161 in Uig. a\u0161-ni 'at first'); ga\u0161 (ikir) two, as also min; bi\u0161 (out of gu\u0161), i\u0161 (Turk. vis, \u00fcch) three; nin (Chagatai nil-au), Neo-Sum. \u0161in, \u0161ib four; ia as also va\u0161 (be\u0161) five; ia\u0161, a\u0161 (al-ta) six; \u0161isin (Ugr. sisem) as also imin seven; ussa (out of ia+vis) eight; \u0161immu (out of ia+Neo-Sum. \u0161im) nine; gun, Neo-Sum. tun, un (Turki von, on) ten; min, mi (Uig. m\u00fcm) hundred.\n\nas it seems: object+subject+verb, e.g. in-nan-gar, in-nab-gar (also without the subject-prefix: in-gar '(he) it made'). We find also imman-gar (out of innan-gar), immigar (out of inni-gar), an-gar and al-gar, ba-gar, ban-gar, ba-nin-gar, ba-nib-gar and other variants. As for the strange mun-gar '(he) it made,' we have here the same law of sound as in Turkish (comp. above, p. 355, note l, for it is for ban-gar (as in Turkish munu-ki 'this here,' mun-da 'here,' mun-ge 'to this,' for bun-, and this for older ban). It is only with the pronoun of the second person before the verb that we have the order: subj.+obj.+verb, e.g. mu-ran-sum 'he gives to thee,' forms, which are apparently of later origin, as is seen from mu (out of mu-n, and this for ba-n), otherwise and originally only for 'it' (accusative), but here for 'he' (nominative); the same order seems to be in mun-ni\u0161in-aggi\u0161 'he them sent out.'\nThe same is the case with the verb (oldest forms: garra \u2018he made,\u2019 garr\u0101-mu \u2018I made,\u2019 garr\u0101-su \u2018thou madest,\u2019 garrini \u2018they make,\u2019 garrissh \u2018they made\u2019), comp. especially p. 360, note 4, and other places above (in treating the pronouns). We have here only to add, that the precative or optative prefix \u0123i- is just the same as the optative suffix in Turki, comp. \u0123i-gal (Neo-Sum. -tal) \u2018he may be\u2019 with Turki bol-\u011fai (Osm. ol\u00e2), that the prefixed stem-forming elements ta, da, ra, prefixed to the verb in Sumerian, occur in Turki alone (e.g. kol-da-mak from kol \u2018arm,\u2019 k\u00f6te-r-mek from the root k\u00f4t, ari-t-mak \u2018to let make clean\u2019 from ari-mak \u2018to make clean\u2019) as also combined in tir, tur, e.g. kil-t\u00fcr-mek \u2018to bring\u2019 from kil-mek \u2018to come,\u2019 that also the Turki reflexive stem with n (e.g. taula-n-mak \u2018to become fat\u2019 from taula-mak \u2018to make fat\u2019) has its analogy in Sumerian (comp. garinn\u0101-su \u2018thou hast been,\u2019 Sem. tab\u0161t, from gar \u2018to make\u2019), that forms like aggi\u015f (not plural!) \u2018he sent out\u2019 (from a verb ag) are the prototype for the Turki reciprocal stem with s, e.g. sor-u\u0161-mak \u2018to ask one together\u2019 from sor-mak \u2018to ask.\u2019\n\nWhere we and the Semites have prepositions, the Sumerian has, like the Turkish idioms, postpositions, of which the most common are: -ku (Neo-Sum. \u0161u) \u2018to,\u2019 -gi (Neo-Sum. also -di) \u2018of,\u2019 ka \u2018of\u2019 (but originally for the dative, as is shown by M. Amiaud\u2019s ingenious remarks on the difference of -ka and -gi), -ra and -ru \u2018to,\u2019 -ta \u2018in, out of,\u2019 -da \u2018with, for,\u2019 -gim (also gimmi, Neo-Sum. -dim) \u2018like.\u2019 Compare the Turki genitive -ing (for -igi, -ingi), the old dative -ra and -ru (Vambery, Cag. Sprachstudien, p. 20), the common dative in -ka, -ga, the Turki ta, da, \u2018in\u2019 and tan, dan, \u2018out of\u2019 and lastly gib\u00ee, kimi \u2018like.\u2019\n\nIn addition I should like to remark that of negative particles in Sumerian there existed two, the most common nu \u2018not\u2019 (before verbs also na, e.g. nan-gar \u2018he did not make\u2019), the other ba, this latter only before verbs, and here, as it seems, in a prohibitive sense, e.g. baran-gar as also ban-gar \u2018he may not do.\u2019\u00b9 Now we have in Turki the\n\n\u00b9 The discovery of ban-gar in this sense belongs to Dr. Zimmern.\nparticle n\u00e8-n\u00e8 'neither\u2014nor,' and besides it, but only in composition with verbs, ma, e.g. sev-mek 'to love,' sev-me-mek 'not to love.' The Sumerian ana 'what' bears the same relationship to the negation nu or na (comp. also Turki n\u00e8 'what' and n\u00e8 negative particle) as the Arabic m\u00e2 'what' to the secondary m\u00e2 'not.'\n\nIn conclusion, to meet any objections that may be made as to the difference of order in the verbal particles, which are prefixed in Sumerian, but suffixed in the Turki languages, it must be remembered that there are no less than three thousand years' interval between the latest Sumerian text and the oldest Turki document (the Uigurian Kudatku Bilik, circa 1050 A.D.), and if, between the earliest and the latest Sumerian texts, such changes in the syntax could take place as e.g. garra-bi 'he made,' instead of Old Sum. garra or in-gar, an-gar, nin-gar, etc., or idi bar-mun-sib for igi mun-sib-bar, lit. 'eye giving to him' (from igi, Neo-Sum. idi 'eye' and bar 'to give'), it must be admitted that the placing of the verbal particles at the end instead of the beginning is a change not only possible but even to be expected.\n\nIn the foregoing pages I have confined myself principally to giving all the newest results of my researches as to the position of Sumerian amongst the languages of the world.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Those who interest themselves in this subject will find much additional information with regard to Sumerian grammar and its affinities with that of the Turki languages in the author's paper \"Die sumero-akkadische Sprache und ihre Verwandtschaftsverh\u00e4ltnisse,\" in the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung,\" vol. i. (1884), pp. 161\u2013178, 195\u2013221, and 323\u2013342.\u2014Ed.\nART. XVI.\u2014Early Buddhist Symbolism. By Robert Sewell,\nMadras Civil Service, F.R.G.S., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn his \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" our late honoured\nVice-President, James Fergusson, called attention to the\nsimilarity observable between certain symbols found on the\nBuddhist Topes of S\u0101\u00f1chi and Amar\u0101vati, and others found\non sculptured buildings and coins of Western Asia and\nEastern Europe; and in doing so he expressed a hope that\nthis subject would be taken up and developed by other\nwriters. Discussing the origin of the object known as the\ntr\u012b\u015bula\\(^1\\) he said, \"It is curiously like the sign of the planet\nMercury, or the caduceus of the god of that name; and, if\nit were not rank heresy even to hint at such a thing, I\nwould venture to suggest that, after all, there may be some\nconnexion between at least the symbolism of the East and\nWest.\" And later on in the same work the author records\nthe following opinion, in a note on an old Buddhist legend\nwhich mentions a Prince of \"R\u014dm,\"\\(^2\\) \"It would be absurd\nto found any serious theory on the mention of the name of\nRome if it stood alone and unsupported. The circumstance\nmentioned in the narrative of the strangers being white men\nand coming by sea is a small confirmation that the people\nhere mentioned were really Europeans. My impression,\nhowever, is that few who are familiar with the arts of Rome\nin Constantine's time, and who will take the trouble to master\nthese Amar\u0101vati sculptures, can fail to perceive many points\nof affinity between them . . . . The conviction the study\nof these sculptures has forced on my mind is that there was\nmuch more intercommunication between the east and west\nduring the whole period from Alexander to Justinian than\n\n\\(^1\\) Op. cit. pp. 115, 116, and note.\n\\(^2\\) Id. p. 177, note 3.\nis frequently supposed, and that the intercourse was especially frequent and influential in the middle period, between Augustus and Constantine.\"\n\nMy attention has for some time been given to this subject, but residence in India, inability to consult proper works of reference, and press of official work have hitherto prevented my preparing any paper regarding it. Continued study has, however, not shaken my belief in Fergusson's accuracy, and I hope to be able now to show some reasonable foundation for the theory that most of the early Buddhist symbols, whose origin is not directly traceable to indigenous Indian sources, may have been derived from earlier pre-existent Western Asian forms, introduced into India during the centuries that elapsed between the Aryan immigrations thither and the first construction in stone of places of Buddhist worship.\n\nThe first point to which attention must be called is the political connexion between India and the countries of Western Asia during the period in question.\n\nVery little has yet been learned from Indian sources of the early history of India before the time of Chandragupta (B.C. 319). But it seems certain that the country, formerly populated by Turanian hordes, was overswept by Aryan immigrations which brought into India the religion of the Vedas, and, partly by force of arms, partly by the tyranny of priestcraft, ousted the Turanians from civil and religious government. The Aryans, however, powerful though they may have been, never succeeded in crushing out the old Turanian religious beliefs and superstitions. Down to the time of \u015a\u0101kya Muni, though the Vedas may represent the faith of the more elevated and civilized few, fetichism, demonolatry\u2014or rather the fear of demons, leading to demon propitiation\u2014a rooted belief in the existence of snake-deities, fairies, and goblins, and in the power of mystic incantations and charms, had, as it has to this day, firm hold of the ignorant and lethargic masses. Had pure Vedism been the faith of the people, there would have been little need for a Buddha.\nThe era of Chandragupta may be regarded as identical with the era of Alexander for present purposes. Professor Rawlinson has shortly summed up in the following words the condition in pre-Alexandrian times of Western Asia, of the country, that is, bordering on India:\u00b9\u2014\"For nearly a thousand years, from the formation of the great Assyrian Empire to the death of Darius Codomannus (330 B.C.), Western Asia, from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan, or even to India, had been united under one head, and acknowledged one sovereign. Assyria, Media, Persia, had successively held the position of dominant power.\" Alexander broke up this unity, and the effect of his schemes was \"to introduce in the place of a single consolidated empire, a multitude of separate and contending kingdoms.\" The kingdom of Chandragupta in India was one of these. Previous to his date, during the period when Western Asia was united under the successive empires, the whole of what we now call Hindustan was divided amongst a number of petty chieftains, mostly at enmity with one another, and probably looking on the vast empire on their immediate west as all-powerful. Is it not possible, or rather, is it not probable, that during this period the inhabitants of India had been drinking in the ideas and superstitions of their great neighbours? It is certain that Northern India had, before the time of Alexander, been subject to more than one invasion from the West; and if there were any commercial activity at all, it is quite possible that the Hindus of that date had in their midst colonies of foreign traders\u2014traders glorying in the fancied possession of superior civilization, and proud of the political ascendency of their nation and sovereign. If there were no commercial activity, how is that the Vaishyas, or merchant-class, came to hold such an important position as they undoubtedly did in the body politic of a Hindu State?\n\nSetting aside the mythical invasions of India by the Assyrian Semiramis, and Diodorus's problematical account\n\n\u00b9 Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy, p. 29.\nof the expedition of Sesostris\u2014both of which accounts, however, point to the existence of a belief amongst the Greeks that India was a country that had lain open to, and had suffered from, invasions long anterior to that of Darius Hystaspis, and serve to show that the Greeks, at least, did not consider such a state of things at all improbable, whatever may be the opinion of writers of the present day,\u2014we have evidence that in very early days there was an interchange of commercial relations between Western Asia and India. Dr. Burnell holds it as not to be doubted that India even traded with Egypt in very early times.\\(^1\\) But there is no necessity for present purposes to go further than Asia.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson has pointed out that the early Chaldaean inscriptions make frequent mention of the \"ships of Ur,\" and imply that they navigated to considerable distances. It is not improbable that these ships carried gold from India. Gold could be obtained from both Africa and India, and it was lavishly used in decoration.\\(^2\\) The Ph\u0153nicians also traded with India by sea. Professor Rawlinson\\(^3\\) points out that for ten centuries prior to the reign of Seleukos Nikator, from a date, that is, as early as the beginning of Assyrian ascendency, the precious metals and the most valuable kinds of merchandize had been flowing from every quarter into the region governed by that monarch. Gold, tin, silks, pearls, spices, and other articles of commerce, had been passing into it from India since the foundation of the first Assyrian empire in the fourteenth century B.C. Whatever may have been the exact date of the Homeric poems, it has been repeatedly noticed that the early Greek bards were acquainted with tin and other articles of Indian merchandize, and called them by their Sanskrit names, and that the Hebrew chroniclers of King Solomon and of the reign of Hiram of Tyre used Indian names for Indian products.\n\n\\(^1\\) Burnell's South-Indian Palaeography, p. 3.\n\\(^2\\) Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. i. p. 101\u20132.\n\\(^3\\) Sixth Oriental Monarchy, p. 33.\nThat gold was largely exported from India in very early days has been inferred from a number of corroborative facts. MM. Perrot and Chipiez\\(^1\\) write: \"From objects found in the excavations, from inscriptions in which the Assyrians boast of their wealth and prodigality, from Egyptian texts in which the details of tribute paid by the Roten-nou, that is, by the people of Syria and Mesopotamia, are given, it is clear that in the great days of Nineveh and Babylon, those capitals possessed a vast quantity of gold, and employed it in a host of different ways. . . . . . These accumulations were continually added to, in the case of Babylon, by the active commerce she carried on with the mineral-producing countries, such as the Caucasus, Bactriana, India, and Egypt.\"\n\nThe period of Solomon, or say 1000 B.C., is generally considered to have been one of great commercial activity, but it seems unreasonable to assume that that monarch largely increased the trade of the world. We are induced to lay more stress than is perhaps warranted on the commerce of Solomon's date, on account of the high position he holds in the Jewish Scriptures. It is probable that the trade which glorified his age had been carried on with similar briskness by his neighbours for some centuries past. The period of Solomon is one that witnessed the decadence of the great Assyrian Empire, and a corresponding rise to a state of prosperity of the hitherto obscure Jewish nation. This ascendancy was, however, very short-lived. Solomon, so it would seem, carried on by the aid of the Phoenicians and with considerable success the old-established eastern commerce. There is little reason to think that he originated or greatly increased, during his very short spell of domination, a commerce which had been non-existent or scanty in previous years.\n\nFrom the days of Solomon we must pass to those of the second Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria, of Shalmanezer IV., and of Sargon, the same that carried captive the Ten Israelitish tribes, removed them to the cities of \"Halah and Habor on\n\n\\(^1\\) History of Art in Chaldaea and Assyria, Armstrong's translation, vol. i. p. 125.\nthe river of Gozan and into the cities of the Medes,\" and placed Assyrians and Chaldaeans in the cities of Samaria.\\(^1\\) The empire of these sovereigns would seem to have extended as far east as the Indus. The period is B.C. 745-705. The Biblical account of the religious changes introduced by these conquests into Samaria, and the effect of Jewish influence in the further east, is pertinent to the present inquiry. It shows the estimation in which the Assyrians held the gods of their neighbours, and vice versa. It points to religious toleration, and to a state of religious thought and belief such as would directly tend to the acceptance by one people of the superstitions and symbols of their neighbours.\n\nThe Chaldaeans and Assyrians who were sent westwards to inhabit the desolated cities of Samaria informed their Assyrian sovereign after their arrival that things were not well with them, that they were suffering, so they believed, from the displeasure of the \"God of the land\" because they did not worship him aright, they \"knew not his manner;\" \"therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.\" The monarch, desirous of assisting his subjects, and in the firm belief that the \"God of the land\" was vindictively injuring them, found it necessary in his judgment to propitiate the offended Deity by sending back to Samaria one of the expatriated Jewish priests. \"Carry thither,\" he commanded, \"one of the priests whom ye brought from thence . . . and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.\"\\(^2\\)\n\nSimilarly, nearly three centuries later, we find that the Persian king, though firmly believing in Ahura-Mazda as the most powerful of the gods, yet credited the gods of the nations on his borders with not inconsiderable authority and influence. In the time of Artaxerxes Longimanus, for instance (B.C. 465-425), we find the sovereign decreeing a number of important concessions to the Jews, and giving the following reason for doing so: \"Whatsoever is commanded\n\n\\(^1\\) 2 Kings xvii. 6, 24.\n\\(^2\\) 2 Kings xvii. 26, 27.\nby the God of Heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of Heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?\" He feared the displeasure of Jehovah the God of the Jews.\n\nThese two instances, separated by an interval of 280 years, afford an insight, as I have stated, into the religious feelings of the day. They show the feelings of the Assyrians in the eighth, and the Persians in the fifth century B.C. towards the God of the Jews. When the Assyrians and Chaldaeans settled in Samaria in the eighth century B.C., they carried thither their own worship: \"The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\" It would be mere waste of time to enlarge on the feelings of the Jews towards the gods of their neighbours. Their belief in the power of those divinities was so great that, as the Scriptures tell us, the Jews perpetually excited the wrath of Jehovah by their idolatries. One after another they fell away to the adoration of Egyptian, Chaldaean, and Assyrian deities, in sun-worship even going the length of stabling the horses of the sun in the court of the temple at Jerusalem. It can scarcely be doubted that the use of sun-symbols followed sun-worship.\n\nIt does not appear unreasonable to assume that there may have been a reciprocity of superstitious ideas between the Assyrian subjects of the empire and their eastern neighbours the Hindus, similar to that which existed between the same Assyrians and their western neighbours the Jews.\n\nA century after the reign of Sargon, the Assyrian empire was finally destroyed, and Cyaxares the Median established on its ruins the foundation of the great empire that passed in the year 558 B.C. from the Medes to Cyrus the Persian. Cyrus, amongst other conquests, reduced the whole country\n\n1 Ezra vii. 23 (Revised version).\n2 Sun-god and goddess.\n3 2 Kings xvii. 30, 31.\nup to the Indus, including Afghanistan and Beluchistan, but he does not appear to have crossed the Indus bent on territorial aggrandizement. It is during the reign of Cyrus that we first find mention made of India by any Greek writer. This is Hekataius of Miletus (B.C. 549\u2013486), who, by mentioning several places and cities in Northern India, proves that that country was known to Europeans.\n\nIn B.C. 521 succeeded to the throne of Persia Darius Hystaspis, who, fired doubtless by the knowledge acquired by his predecessors of the internal wealth and at the same time of the weakness of Trans-Indus countries, crossed the great river about the year 515 B.C., and conquered and annexed to the Persian empire the rich country of the Panjab, and the Indus valley. Henceforward that portion of India lay under Persian domination till the breaking up of the Empire at the Macedonian invasion two centuries later. \"The results of this conquest,\" writes Professor Rawlinson,\u00b9 \"were the acquisition of a brave race capable of making excellent soldiers, an enormous increase of revenue, a sudden and vast influx of gold into Persia, which led probably to the introduction of gold coinage, and the establishment of commercial relations with the natives, which issued in a regular trade carried on by coasting vessels between the mouths of the Indus and the Persian Gulf.\" I can hardly concur in the opinion that commercial relations were then \"established,\" if that word be taken to mean first established. It would seem more likely that commerce was consolidated and greatly facilitated by the conquests of Darius, while a new and important line of communication was opened up by water-way down the Indus to the Persian Gulf. An additional effect of the conquest and of Persian domination for two centuries would naturally be greatly to increase the spread of Persian ideas amongst the Hindus of that part of India, and still further to undermine the then declining religion of the Vedas.\n\nThe conquered portion of India formed the 20th satrapy\n\n\u00b9 Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 431.\nmentioned by Herodotus, and paid the enormous tribute of 360 talents of gold-dust to the imperial exchequer.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt was about this time that the Buddha arose and founded his system of philosophy. The much-vexed question of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a chronology will not here be entered into; but if Buddha's death occurred after the year 515 B.C., he must have been perfectly aware of the great conquests of Darius Hystaspis, and the representatives of the reigning family of Magadha must have trembled for the safety of their kingdom.\\(^2\\)\n\nXerxes, who succeeded Darius in 486 B.C., retained all his father's provinces, including those in India, and a body of troops raised in the Panj\u0101b served under his standard in his fruitless expedition against Greece. Herodotus describes the dress of these soldiers, the first representatives of Imperialism as understood by the Persians.\\(^3\\) Their leader appears to have been a Persian or a Parthian\u2014Pharnazathres, the son of Artabates.\\(^4\\) They fought under Mardonius at Plat\u00e6a.\\(^5\\) \"India\" is mentioned in the Jewish Chronicles as forming part of the 127 provinces of Xerxes (Ahasuerus) and his successors.\\(^6\\)\n\nHerodotus, who flourished in the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (465-425 B.C.), the successor of Xerxes, repeatedly mentions India, though his own knowledge seems to have stopped short at the Indus. Ktesias, physician to Artaxerxes Mn\u0113mon (B.C. 405-359), wrote an elaborate though untrustworthy account of India. A few years later, B.C. 330, the Persian empire was completely destroyed by Alexander the Macedonian, and four years afterwards this monarch crossed the Indus, and largely extended the boundaries of the empire. His age synchronizes with that of Chandragupta, the Mauryan, and marks an epoch in the early history of India.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Herod. iii. 94, 95.\n\\(^2\\) Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 131.\n\\(^3\\) We read of no Indian troops being utilized for European warfare from the days of Xerxes to those of Lord Beaconsfield.\n\\(^4\\) Herod. vii. 66.\n\\(^5\\) id. viii. 113; ix. 31.\n\\(^6\\) Esther i. 1, viii. 9. 1 Esdras iii. 2, etc.\nTo summarize the political condition of India up to this period, we see that its frontier marched, for nearly eight centuries, with that of the powerful Assyrio-Chaldean empire, and that for the two succeeding centuries a considerable portion of India lay actually under direct Persian domination, forming a Persian satrapy, under Persian governors, and paying a heavy tribute to the Persian exchequer. When it is remembered that the original faith of the Turanian inhabitants of both countries was one and the same, and that this was the faith cherished by the masses of the people, it would be natural to assume that this state of things resulted in religious changes and mutual assimilations.\n\nIt was owing to the expedition of Alexander that India was first really made known to European nations, for the conqueror took with him a number of learned and scientific men\\(^1\\) specially selected for the purpose of collecting and recording all available information relative to the reduced tracts and their inhabitants; and their works, condensed by Strabo, Arrian, and Pliny, prove how earnestly they strove honourably to fulfil their task.\n\nAlexander found in the Panj\u0101b and Indus valley a number of petty princes, jealous of one another and practically powerless to defend themselves, but recognizing the King of Persia as their suzerain and paying tribute to him. One only, Porus or Puru, attempted to check the invasion, but he was defeated without difficulty. The Greek armies then pressed on to Amritsur, their leader being determined to conquer the whole of the north of India as far as the valley of the Ganges; but wearied by the heat, and exhausted by the troubles and difficulties of their protracted campaign, they were compelled to abandon this project, and to journey southwards along the banks of the Jhelum. Near the confluence of the five great rivers, Alexander made a long halt, built a city, which he called Alexandria, received there the submission of the neighbouring states, and constituted it the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These were B\u00e6to, Diognetos, Nearchos, Onesikritos, Aristoboulos, Kallisthenes, and others.\ncapital of the satrapy. Journeying finally down the Indus, the Greek forces retired, partly by sea, partly by land through Beluchist\u0101n, and reached Susa B.C. 325.\n\nCorroborative proof of the existence in those days of considerable land trade in India is found in the mention by Herodotus of long lines of highways, marked with what we should call mile-stones, which were deemed so important by Alexander that he had them surveyed.\n\nNorthern India was now, after eight centuries of proximity to the Assyrio-Chald\u00e6an empire, and after two centuries of partial Persian domination, subjected to the influences of the Greeks, which, though not felt during a long period of time, yet produced a serious impression on the arts of the country. It is now for the first time, so far as can be gathered, that the Hindus began to carve and construct buildings in stone. During the Greek period detachments of Greek soldiers must have guarded all important Greek points in the north, while in the Alexandrian cities of Bucephalia, near Jabalpur on the Jhelum, Nicaea, on the east side of the same river, Alexandria, the modern Uchch in the southern Punjab, and P\u0101tala or Haidar\u0101b\u0101d in Sinde,\u2014there probably resided communities of Greek settlers.\u00b9\n\nMeanwhile Chandragupta, an adventurer, was acquiring power in Magadha. Everything was in his favour. The Hindu princes were impoverished and enfeebled by internal disputes and Persian requisitions, while on the death of Alexander in B.C. 323, discord ensued in the ranks of the invaders. The Indian provinces fell to the share of Alexander's General Seleukos Nikator, but his weakness was Chandragupta's strength, and when, after several troublous years, the former found time to pay serious attention to the condition of his Indian feudatories, he found himself face to face with an empire. Chandragupta had acquired such power that the Greek was paralyzed, and was forced to come to terms. An alliance ensued. Seleukos abandoned his Indian possessions, and received in return a present of 500 elephants\n\n\u00b9 Article \"India,\" Encyclop. Brit.\nfrom Chandragupta, a present which he commemorated on his coins;\u00b9 he gave his daughter in marriage to Chandragupta; and sent an ambassador, Megasthenes, to the court of P\u0101\u1e6dalaputra.\u00b2 This alliance altered the relative positions of the Greeks in India and the natives in the country. Previous to it, there seems to have been a succession of massacres of the new comers by the Hindus. After the alliance, friendly relations were established which must have largely contributed to the spread of western influences, both Greek and Persian. This friendship lasted into the time of A\u015boka, the grandson of Chandragupta, who formed an alliance with Antiochus Theos, the grandson of Seleukos, in B.C. 256,\u2014Antiochus Soter, who murdered and then succeeded Seleukos, having in the meantime sent an embassy under Daimachos to Chandragupta\u2019s son and successor Bimbis\u0101ra.\n\nDuring the preceding two centuries Buddhism had been steadily gaining ground amongst the people, and A\u015boka made it the state religion. Proof that more intimate relations existed at this period between the Hindus and the kingdoms of the west is found in the mention by A\u015boka, in his 11th edict, of five Greek princes, Antiochus of Syria, Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt, Antigonus of Macedon, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander of Epirus, while the king boasts that Buddhist ideas were spreading amongst western nations.\n\nFifty years after the time of A\u015boka, Euthydemus, the Graeco-Baktrian, and his son Demetrius carried their arms into India (B.C. 191\u2013181), and a city called Euthydemeia was founded on the Jhelum.\u00b3 Eukratides, who succeeded Demetrius, conquered the country as far as Alexander\u2019s royal city of Pat\u0101la, and appears to have sent expeditions into Cutch and Gujar\u0101t (B.C. 181\u2013151). General Cunningham\u2074 has expressed the opinion that the Indian provinces remained subject to the Baktrian kings during the reigns of Lysias,\n\n\u00b9 Poole\u2019s Catalogue of the Coins of the Selucid Kings, plate i.

Chron. n.s. vol. ix. p. 150.\nAntialkidas, Amyntas, and Herm\u00e6us. Menander's influence, indeed, extended still further to the east. Professor Weber thinks that the Gr\u00e6co-Baktrians advanced as far as Oudh.\n\nWe have corroborative evidence in the Bible of Indian trade with the west in those days, for it is stated there that in the time of the Maccabees, Antiochus Eupator of Syria had in his army 32 war-elephants carrying Indian mahouts.\\(^1\\) This was in B.C. 163. The Persian army too, at that time, or only a few years previous, possessed 120 elephants.\\(^2\\)\n\nTo return to Northern India,\u2014the next great political event succeeding the Baktrian era was the invasion of the country by the Yueh-chi, as they are called by Chinese authors, Tartar tribes from the north-west. This took place in the first century B.C. The invaders are variously termed Scyths, Turanians, \u0160akas, Indo-Scythians. As to their invasion and its effect, I quote from Professor Max M\u00fcller's \"India, what can it teach us?\"\\(^3\\) They swept over the country, overthrew the Mauryan kingdom, and \"took possession of India, or at least the government of India, from about the first century B.C. to the third century A.D.\" The invaders belonged, in a sense, to the religion of the people, the religion that was merged into Buddhism, in opposition to the Vedic religion. \"The rise of Buddhism and its formal adoption by King A\u015boka had already considerably shaken the power and influence of the old Brahmanic hierarchy. The northern conquerors . . . . were certainly not believers in the Veda. They seem to have made a sort of compromise with Buddhism, and it is probably due to that compromise, or to an amalgamation of \u0160aka legends with Buddhist doctrines, that we owe the so-called Mah\u0101y\u0101na form of Buddhism\u2014and more particularly the Amit\u0101bha worship\u2014which was finally settled at the Council under Kanishka, one of the Turanian rulers in India in the first century A.D.\" The four centuries of Turanian domination\n\n\\(^1\\) 1 Macc. vi. 30\u201337.\n\\(^2\\) id. viii. 6.\n\\(^3\\) p. 85 ff. and 274\u2013277.\ncaused a complete cessation of literary activity in India, though at the same time this period witnessed the construction in stone of some of the most elaborate and beautiful architectural monuments in the country.\n\nAbout the year 20 B.C. we find an embassy sent from India to Augustus at Rome, the credentials of which were written on skins, showing how far western usage and Turanian freedom had overcome Brahmanical and Buddhist prejudices. Intercourse with Rome is still further proved by the quantity of Roman coins found in all parts of India.\\(^1\\) It is possible, even, that a colony of Romans occupied Madura, for it seems that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dyan king sent an embassy to Rome about this period, while a large number of Roman copper coins have been found in the river-bed at that city in various scattered localities.\\(^2\\) I lay stress on the coins being copper because, while a find of gold or silver coins would not prove much, the discovery of copper coins in scattered localities seems to point to an occupation of the place by persons who used them in daily life. The Peutingerian Tables, if they may be held as an authority, locate a temple of Augustus on the coast near \"Muziris,\"\\(^3\\) and certainly nothing would seem more natural than that Roman traders engaged in the gold trade in the Wynnaad should have erected a place of worship for themselves.\n\nThe testimony of Arrian (A.D. 150) must not be overlooked. His knowledge of India, north and south, was far too extensive and accurate to have been gained in any way but through informants thoroughly conversant with the country, and possibly resident therein.\n\nMention must also be made of the Syrian colonies on the western coast, whose advent would seem to have occurred in the early years of our era.\n\nThe indigenous chronicles of Cuttack on the north-eastern coast of the Peninsula, though their testimony must be\n\n\\(^1\\) For Southern India see the author's *List of Antiquities*, Madras, vol. i. pp. 144, 190, 214, 218, 220, 222, 226\u2013240, 244, 285, 286, 291.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mr. Scott, a pleader in the District Court of Madura, has a quantity of these.\n\n\\(^3\\) Desjardins, *Segment xi. Livraison ii.*\nviewed with suspicion, contain several allusions to \"Yavana\" invasions of that tract, and even go so far as to assert that \"Yavanas\" held possession of that country as conquerors and rulers for 151 years.\\(^1\\) It is, however, quite possible that this foreign conquest, if true, was a conquest by the Yueh-chi, with whose era it fairly synchronizes according to the compilation of Stirling and Hunter.\n\nFor present purposes it is not necessary to carry this cursory view of Hindu foreign political relations lower than the Roman period, since this is the age of the latest and most elaborate Buddhist stone structures. Enough has been said to show that the Hindus of the north lay open to constant foreign influence. I shall now attempt to show that these influences did actually take effect, as it is natural to suppose that they would have done, so that there can be nothing far-fetched in the idea that the symbolism of Buddhist days might have been, in part, of foreign and not indigenous origin.\n\nTo this end it is necessary to consider for a moment the state of religious belief in Chald\u00e6a, Persia, and India, in order to ascertain whether it is reasonable to hold that the inhabitants of either of these countries might have adopted the religious ideas of their neighbours.\n\nWhen the Aryans migrated to India they found in that country a race of non-Aryans\u2014a people of a lower type than their own, long resident in their land. The Vedic hymns characterize these last as \"non-sacrificers,\"\\(^2\\) \"without gods,\" \"without rites,\" but sufficiently civilized to possess \"castles and forts.\" They seem to have been worshippers of trees and serpents\u2014their principal deity was an earth-god. They practised all kinds of fetish-worship.\\(^3\\) The Aryans brought with them their Vedas, and their worship of the manifesta-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sewell's Lists of Antiquities, Madras, vol. ii. p. 205, and the same author's Sketch of the Dynasties of Southern India, p. 65.

The Turanians appear to have immolated human victims in propitiation of the bloody and vindictive demons they feared.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cave-Temples of India (Fergusson and Burgess), p. 13.\ntions of a soul or spirit in nature\u2014Indra, Varuna, Agni, Ushas, V\u0101yu and the Maruts, Savitri, S\u016brya, Vish\u1e47u and others. Once in India the Aryan religion became gradually corrupted. Ignorant superstition had its natural effect. Fear of evil and dread of the unknown supernatural, acquired by constant contact with people who feared and dreaded, gradually overcame enfeebled confidence and trust in benevolent powers. It is, I think, probable that contact with the races that formed the powerful second Assyrian empire, in the two centuries preceding the age of Buddha, helped to bring about this state of things. This idea seems to have been held by Fergusson, who thought that the idea of Vish\u1e47u was imported from the West, and that the garu\u1e0da is nothing more than the hawk-headed divinity of the Assyrians.\u00b9\n\nFergusson thus sums up the religious question as it stood in the sixth century B.C. \u201cThe blood of the Aryans had become so mixed and so impure that the Veda was no longer possible as a rule of faith, and when \u015a\u0101kya-Muni availed himself of the opportunity so afforded . . . . his call was responded to in a manner which led to the most important consequences.\u201d He asserts, though with some hesitation, that as many as nine or ten of the Nandas, the immediate predecessors of Chandragupta, were serpent-worshippers.\u00b2\n\nThe faith of the Chaldeans may be best summarized in the words of Professor Rawlinson:\u2014\u201cThe worship was grossly polytheistic. Various deities . . . divided the allegiance of the people, and even of the kings, who regarded with equal respect . . . some fifteen or sixteen personages. Next to these principal gods were a far more numerous assemblage of inferior or secondary divinities . . . recognized generally throughout the country. Finally the Pantheon contained a host of mere local gods or genii, every town, and almost every village in Babylonia being under the protection of its own particular divinity.\u201d\u00b3 But this description might actually have been written for Turanian India, if we may\n\n\u00b9 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 76.\n\u00b2 Tree and Serpent Worship, pp. 67\u201369.\n\u00b3 Rawlinson\u2019s Ancient Monarchies, vol. i. p. 110.\njudge of what Turanian beliefs were by considering what they are to this day, notably in the most Turanian tracts in Southern India. It is important for present purposes that this should not be lost sight of. The beliefs of the Chald\u00e6ans were almost identical with those of the masses in India. In Chald\u00e6a, however, \"the religion was to a certain extent astral. The heaven itself, the sun, moon, and the five planets have each their representative in the Chald\u00e6an Pantheon among the chief objects of worship. At the same time it is to be observed that the astral element is not universal, but partial.\"\u00b9\n\nThe religion of the Assyrians closely resembled that of the Chald\u00e6ans.\u00b2\n\nThe early Persians, like the early Indians, were serpent-worshippers, and followed Turanian beliefs. As in India, so in Persia, a higher form of religion spread itself over the land. This last was, indeed, one and the same. I may be pardoned for again quoting Fergusson in this respect:\u2014\"At the time when the Greeks became acquainted with Persia, the whole country, under the influence of the Ach\u00e6menian kings, had been brought to acknowledge Zoroastrianism with its elemental fire-worship as their principal form of faith. This religion in its purity . . . . was the faith which the Iranians brought with them from their original seats when they separated from the Indian Aryans, and was practically their common faith both in India and in Persia. In the latter country, however, it was strangely mixed up with Magism, a religion of much more Semitic, or even, it may be suspected, Turanian form, and the two were at that time so blended in the Grecian accounts at least that it is now impossible to separate the one from the other.\"\u00b3\n\nThus, in Persia and in India there was a close similarity of religious belief,\u2014Turanianism overlaid with the purer worship of divine manifestations of Power in Nature. The hostility of the priesthood practically proves the connection, for the great Persian Divinity Ahura-Mazda was an Asura,\n\n\u00b9 id. p. 111.\n\u00b2 Ancient Monarchies, vol. ii. p. i.\n\u00b3 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 42.\nor malignant spirit to the Hindu, while the Hindu D\u0113va became a demon or devil to the Persian.\\(^1\\) The difference consisted in the development rather than in the germ. The Persians purified their religion into something akin to monotheism, the Hindus sank lower and lower into the depths of Turanian poly-d\u00e6monism. But in their origin their religious beliefs were identical, and there is no reason for rejecting as absurd and fanciful a theory that their early symbolism may have been the same. Sun-symbols especially might have survived to a late date in both countries.\n\nThe above summary, however, only goes to prove possibilities. It is necessary, now, to come to more certain and clear proofs that the Hindus of Northern India did actually succumb, and that in no small degree, to foreign influences, in pre-Buddhist days.\n\nProfessor Max M\u00fcller has noted an abrupt change in Hindu literature between the time of the Vedas and that of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (i.e. previous to 600 B.C.). This occurred during the period of the powerful later Assyrian empire, when the frontiers of India and of that empire touched one another along the whole of the north-west and west, from K\u0101bul to Karr\u0101chi, and when Assyrian and Chaldaean influences were likely to make themselves most felt. The change is stated by the learned Professor in his History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, to have been so important that it led to \u201ca complete misunderstanding of the original intentions of the Vedic hymns.\u201d The old Aryan religion was revolutionized. The result is thus epitomized by a recent writer in this Journal,\\(^2\\) \u201cNew gods were invented in profusion, and some of these new mythological personages overshadowed and supplanted the deities of the Vedic age. Monstrous cosmogonies were invented and . . . . an entirely new mode of describing the world is adopted . . . . Into this new system of the world, the sun, moon, and stars, together with the zodiac and the twenty-seven lunar mansions, made\n\n\\(^1\\) \"Ancient Monarchies,\" vol. ii. p. 324.

Part I. p. 6 (Jan. 1886).\nan entrance, and later the Ptolemaic system.\" It has also been pointed out that about a century or more after the probable era of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, \u015a\u0101kyamuni found the Hindus believing in the doctrine of metempsychosis, which is by origin an Egyptian, not a Vedic doctrine. Now if all this is not an exaggeration, and there is little reason to suppose that that is the case, it seems to afford direct evidence that India was at that time subjected to some extent to Chaldaean influences.\n\nMM. Perrot and Chipiez, in their admirable work on the History of Art in Chald\u00e6a and Assyria, have given a clear account of the Chaldaean system of astrology and numerical calculation, with a description of its origin, which, though it stands unproved, at least seems most reasonable and admissible when viewed theoretically. In early days, say they, in Chald\u00e6a, as in the early days of many families of the human race, fetichism, belief in demons, and spirits both malevolent and beneficent, reigned supreme, and worship or propitiation was associated with incantations and magic. As time passed on the priests added astrology to magic in their search after charms sufficiently powerful to compel to obedience those brilliant genii who inhabited the bright heavens and showed themselves to man at night. But though simple minds might believe in the power of these charms, the priests, with more keen intellectual observation, noticed that neither sun, moon, nor stars ever changed their position in obedience to the command of man. Planetary motion, however, made itself visible, and the regularity of the motion of the sun and moon was also noted; and as all was favourable for study, the air clear, the nights balmy, men set themselves to work out the meaning of the motion of the heavenly bodies. Observatories, raised high above the mists, were built, and lofty platforms erected for the purpose. Students of Astronomy began to believe that the lives of individuals were affected from the time they were born by\n\n1 Op. cit. vol. i. p. 65\u201373 (Armstrong's translation).\n2 \"Carmina vel oxo possunt deducere lunam.\" So Virgil many centuries later (Bucol. viii. 69).\nthe condition of the planets at the moment of birth. Hence arose the whole system of astrology, which has had such an effect on the minds of men that it lasted in full force, even in Europe, down to the sixteenth century of our era, and to the present day claims here some few votaries, while in India it still reigns supreme.\u00b9 Astrology paved the way for Astronomy. In order to profit by the indications of the stars, in order, that is, to foretell success or disaster, it became necessary to foresee the positions the planets would occupy in the sky on a given day or hour\u2014necessary to arrive by repeated observation at an exact knowledge of the route followed by the planets across the sky, and to distinguish them one from another by name. The result was a close, accurate, and patient study, which has been of incalculable benefit to mankind.\n\n\u00b9 The Chaldean system of Astrology spread far and wide. The \"Magi\" in Persia seem to have been second only to the irresponsible monarch in power. One, indeed, Pseudo-Smerdis, or \"Gomates, the Magian,\" a priest, seized the monarchy and held it firmly for a short time. Originally a Median religious caste, they appear to have adopted and carried on the sciences of the Chaldean star-gazers, after the fall of Babylon and establishment of the Empire of the Medes; for when the Greeks and Romans come in contact with them, they seem to have been called indifferently \"Magi\" or \"Chaldeans.\" A good idea of Chaldean magic, as intimately known to the Jews, who were largely affected by it, is gained from the prophecy of Isaiah (xlvii. 12.), who, apostrophizing the city of Babylon under the title \"daughter of the Chaldeans,\" says,\u2014\"Stand now with thy enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries .... Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.\" Though all forms of magic were forbidden by the Avesta, and Zoroastrianism was opposed to Magianism, the Magi contrived to pose before the Greeks as the representatives of the religion of Persia. \u00c6schylus mentions them as a tribe. Sophocles writes of them with contempt. Plato held them in honour, and so did Xenophon. All over the civilized world the arts of astrology and divination, as taught by the Magi, came to be practised. The priests thus acquired a recognized position in society, their services being required on all occasions, alike by the king and the peasant. Under the Roman Empire flourished swarms of impostors, professors in the Art of Magic, who were known as \"Magi,\" \"Chaldei,\" \"Mathematici.\" When Roman chiefs built their villa-residences in the newly-conquered island of Britain, they brought with them the symbols and superstitions of their own country. The old svastika emblem was introduced by them into the decorated mosaic flooring of their principal rooms. Specimens are found in the Roman villa at Whitestauton in Somersetshire, as well as in that at Brading in the Isle of Wight; and in curious connection with it in the latter mosaic is the figure of an astrologer with a divining-rod in his hand, who has, in the field of the design, as if in the air, close by his head\u2014in the place where, under the Assyrians and Persians, an anthropomorphic winged-globe would have been depicted,\u2014an Oriental sun-emblem, the circle or wheel on a pillar, exactly as seen at Amaravati and Sanchi. It seems most probable that this design stamps the astrologer as a representative of eastern magic.\nThe Chaldaeans, for purposes of calculation, established an intricate system of numeration. They began by counting on their fingers by units of five. Then they adopted a notation by sixes and twelves as an improvement on the former, since the figure ten could be divided neither into three nor four equal parts.\\(^1\\) Numeration by sixes led to their division of time into the sos of 60 years, the ner of 600 years, and the sar of 3600 years. Lenormant points out that 60 may be divided by any divisor of ten or twelve. \"Of all numbers that could be chosen as an invariable denominator for fractions it has most divisors.\"\\(^2\\) Founded on a sexagesimal numeration, the metrical system of Babylon and Nineveh was the most scientific of all those practised by the ancients.\n\nThe Chaldaeans began by registering the phenomena. They noted seven planets, including the sun and moon, and observed the apparent march of the sun through the constellations that are still called the \"Signs of the Zodiac,\" and it seems that they even went so far as to recognize the annual displacement of the equinoctial point upon the ecliptic, but their instruments were too defective to enable them to go very far. They used for astronomical calculations the solar year of \\(365\\frac{1}{4}\\) days, with which they made themselves acquainted, though for convenience they used the lunar year in civil life. The Greek astronomer, Epigenes, declares that the Chaldaeans had preserved their calculations for an incredible number of years, and it is certain that many tablets containing stellar and planetary observations have been discovered. They believed in seven celestial deities, those of the Sun, Moon, and five great planets\u2014Adar (Saturn), Merodach (Jupiter), Nergal (Mars), Istar (Venus), and Nebo (Mercury).\n\nThe modern European system of time-calculation is derived, almost certainly, from Chaldaea. Hence our sexagesimal divisions. We have sixty minutes to an hour, sixty seconds\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Aur\u00e8s, Essai sur le Syst\u00e8me m\u00e9trique Assyrien, p. 10 (in the Recueil de Travaux relatifs \u00e0 la Philologie et \u00e0 l'Arch\u00e9ologie \u00c9gyptiennes et Assyriennes, vol. iii.).\n\n\\(^2\\) F. Lenormant, Manual d'Histoire Ancienne, vol. ii. p. 177 (3rd edition).\nto a minute, sixty divisions to a degree of space. Similarly the Hindus, deriving their method equally from Chald\u00e6a, divide time into cycles of sixty years, and their days into sixty ghats of twenty-four minutes each. A similar sexagesimal division of years is in use both in China and Japan, probably carried thither on the introduction of Buddhism from India, for there are separate and distinct indigenous systems in use in both countries.\n\nWith regard to the days of the week, the Indians, equally with European nations, divide the days into groups of seven, named in the same order in all countries, after the sun, moon, and five great planets of the Chald\u00e6ans. General Cunningham contributed to the Indian Antiquary last year an interesting paper on this subject. He writes: There is \"good evidence to show that the week days, as named after the seven planets, were in use, both in Persia and in India, at the same time as in the West, and perhaps even earlier. We have the testimony of Celsus, who lived during the reign of Augustus and Tiberius, that the Persian temples had seven gates, named after the sun and planets in regular order, from Saturn to the Sun.\" Proof that this system was early in vogue in India is afforded by a passage in the life of Apollonius by Philostratus. He says: \"The Indian sage Iarchas gave Apollonius seven rings, each bearing the name of one of the seven stars, and he wore them alternately, according to the particular name of the day.\" As Philostratus derived his information from the Assyrian Damis, who actually accompanied Apollonius, this notice is contemporary with the date of his travels, between A.D. 20 and 50. The use of the week days named after the seven stars was, therefore, already established in India at least as early as the beginning of the Christian era.\" General Cunningham shows by diagrams how the calculation by Indian ghats of twenty-four minutes each results in the same order of the days of the week as the European division. He concludes by saying that though there is no direct evidence to show\n\n1 Indian Antiquary, xiv. 1 (Jan. 1885).\n2 Philost. Vit Apollonii, iii. 41. Prisux's Apollonius of Tyana, p. 53 (see \"Postscript\" below, p. 406).\nthe age of the scheme, it appears to have been in use in Media and Babylonia for several centuries before the Christian era. And with this conclusion probably few will be found to disagree.\n\nIn treating of the origin of the trisula, which he connects with the Chaldean cuneiform form sign for Taurus \u03b5\u03b9\u03be, the late Edward Thomas saw nothing fanciful in the supposition that the early Hindus possibly borrowed the trisula symbol from their western neighbours. He wrote: \"The dawning science of Astronomy, in its concurrent deceptive phase of Astrology, must readily have identified itself with kindred magic in the interchange of signs and symbols, as in other mutual aids.\"\u00b9\n\nWe find therefore that the Chaldeans succeeded in introducing into India their astronomical and hence their astrological system, their divisions of time and their nomenclature of the days of the week, all of which are in daily use at the present day. The system of astrology has fast hold of the people of India at the present day, as is well known. From highest to lowest, no man who can afford to pay for it ever dreams of entering on any new or important undertaking without obtaining the opinion of the astrologer of the village or family as to when a lucky moment will occur. Most of the villages of Southern India have, to this day, a paid astrologer for domestic use.\n\nOther and very important evidence of foreign influence in India in early days is afforded by the alphabet in use in the days of \u00c1soka (250 B.C.). No other alphabet has been introduced since that day. All the alphabets at present in use are modifications of that original. Dr. Burnell believed\u00b2 that the alphabet of \u00c1soka had been derived originally from Western Asia before the time of Alexander, and whether this view is correct or not, it was at least the view of a shrewd and critical scholar. He writes: \"I have already mentioned the numerous indications that point to a Semitic origin of the Indian alphabets, and which are generally received\n\n\u00b9 J.R.A.S. (New Series), Vol. I. p. 484.\n\u00b2 South Indian Palaeography, pp. 1-9.\nas sufficient; the immediate original is, however, yet uncertain. Three probable sources may be suggested. The first is that the Indian alphabet came directly from Ph\u0153nicia, and was introduced by the early Ph\u0153nician traders. The second is that the original of these alphabets is to be sought in the modified Ph\u0153nician alphabets used by the Himyarites of Arabia, and this has lately been put forward as an ascertained fact.\\(^1\\) As a third possibility I would suggest that the Indian alphabets may be derived from an Aramaic character used in Persia or rather Babylonia.\u201d He concludes his discussion of the subject by admitting that the information at present available is too scanty to justify a more precise inference, but that he inclines to look on the Aramaic character as the original.\n\nProfessor Max M\u00fcller also believes that the \u00c1soka alphabet was derived from the West. The Hindus themselves admitted that it was of foreign origin. P\u0101\u1e47ini, whose date is variously assigned to the fourth, third, and second century B.C., calls it the \u201cYavan\u0101ni lipi,\u201d though the term \u201cYavana\u201d may apply to any nation of so-called barbarians outside India.\n\nIt must not be forgotten that the alphabet was probably introduced long before \u00c1soka\u2019s day; for though there is no known inscription extant earlier than 250 B.C., it is clear that the character must at that time have undergone serious modifications in India since its introduction, for no alphabet exactly corresponding to it has yet been discovered in Asia, though many exist of a date considerably earlier than the great Buddhist monarch.\n\nTo turn now for a few moments to the architecture and sculpture of India in the earliest period known to us\u2014a subject which is perhaps more important than all for my present purpose. It will be remembered that no known building or rock-cut cave exists in India of a date older than the third century B.C. Is the architecture of indigenous growth? or does it show signs of Western influence? The\n\n\\(^1\\) By Lenormant, Essai sur la Propagation de l\u2019Alphabet Ph\u00e9nicien, i. part i. table vi.\nanswer seems easy to give. The general shape of the structures would appear to be of Indian origin, derived from previously existing buildings, probably made in wood, and adapted to Hindu requirements; but in the ornamentation of these structures, in the decoration of the surface, and in the shape of such pillars as were erected by the Buddhists, they seem to have had recourse to Persian models. The style has been termed Indo-Persian, its *fons et origo* being at Persepolis.\n\nThis is so well known in the present day that it may seem superfluous, in a Society like this, to enlarge on the subject. It might be taken as an accepted fact. But it is, perhaps, well to note shortly the opinion of such a judge as Fergusson. He states that all the *l\u00e4ts* or detached pillars of the time of A\u015boka \"are similar to one another. Circular stone shafts, . . . . surmounted by a capital with the falling-leaf, or bell-shaped form found at Persepolis. This form of the capital, together with the Grecian or rather Assyrian honeysuckle ornament with which it is generally associated, are two of the most valuable ethnographical indications which the architecture of this day affords.\"\u00b9\n\nThe presence of winged lions and other animals on the base and abacus of the pillar is another point of resemblance, the Hindu mythology containing no allusion to four-footed beasts with wings\u2014and their position on the pillar being almost conclusive as to their origin. An excellent paper on the subject appeared in the periodical called the *Friend of India*, on the 13th November, 1875. The writer described in detail the close connection observable between early Indian and Western sculpture both Persian and Greek. And it is remarkable that for several centuries, down to the most flourishing period of Buddhist Art, the period of the Amar\u0101vati Tope, the last and most exquisite of its class whose construction may in part belong to a period five centuries later than that of A\u015boka, during the whole of which it would seem that the Arts had flourished amongst\n\n\u00b9 *Tree and Serpent Worship*, p. 94.\nthe Buddhists, the same type of pillar-capital, base and shaft is found, and the same general form of construction. During all those years no indigenous art had arisen to oust the old foreign designs. The pillars and pilasters of the Amar\u0101vati Tope are in form substantially the pillars and pilasters of Bharhut and S\u0101\u00f1ch\u012b.\n\nIt is now time to turn to the special subject of the present paper, the symbols in use amongst the early Buddhists as exhibited in the sculptures of the existent Topes. It has been shown that the Hindus lay open to Western influences for many centuries, and I have endeavoured to show that they succumbed in large measure to those influences\u2014their astronomical and astrological systems, their divisions of time, and nomenclature of days of the week, their alphabet, and their architectural style, being all more or less derived from the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks,\u2014while it is significant that the old religion of the country was revolutionized exactly at the period of the greatest supremacy of the later Assyrian Empire. The principal Buddhist symbols then,\u2014are they of indigenous origin? or were they derived from Western Asiatic sources?\n\nPure Buddhism was opposed to the use of images or symbols. There was little in the doctrine of Buddha that appealed to the senses, and nothing remained for Buddhist artists when they began to carve in stone but to fall back for art purposes on the old mythology, and the popular superstitions, the fairy and snake-stories of the people,\u00b9 and the old-world symbols long in use. It is another point of resemblance between the Hindus and their neighbours the Persians, that the former appear to have acted, with regard to the use of symbols, exactly as did the latter. The spirit of the Avesta was wholly opposed to idolatry, yet the Persians \"did not deny themselves a certain use of symbolic representation of their deities, nor did they scruple to adopt from idolatrous nations the forms of their religious symbolism.\"\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Prof. Max M\u00fcller, Introduction to the Parables of Buddhaghosha, by Capt. Rogers, p. xxvi.\n\u00b2 Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 351.\nThus the Assyrian winged globe, which in its turn had been borrowed from Egypt as a symbol of Semitic Asshur, was adopted by the Persians as a symbol of Aryan Ahura-Mazda; and thus, I believe, the svastika, the dharmachakra (so-called), and the tri\u015bula were borrowed by Hindu Buddhists from pre-existent forms, possibly in use in India in pre-Buddhist days, but ultimately derived from Assyria, Chald\u00e6a, and Persia. And when it is remembered that all three of these symbols were probably sun-symbols, the theory is rendered still less improbable, for of all emblems which would be most likely to survive amidst the fall of old creeds and the upheaval of atheistic philosophies, that relating to the ancient worship of the sun would naturally be the most prominent, offending, as it did, against no prejudices, superstitions, or beliefs. The Jews, for instance, at one period, as I have stated above, saw no wrong in introducing all the paraphernalia of the old sun-worship into the very courts of the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem\u2014and there is no reason to suppose that they had then revolted against their sacred creeds. They merely added adoration of the sun \"and all the host of heaven\"\u00b9 to the worship of their own Divinity.\n\nSimilarly, at a time when Buddhists began to use symbols, old-world sun-symbols were those which lent themselves most readily and with least perversion of ideas to the requirements of the new faith,\u2014as it was then accepted by the masses of the Turanian-blooded people, being of necessity mixed-up with a great deal of the superstitions of former days.\n\nThe emblems most frequently met with on Buddhist Topes may be divided into two classes\u2014symbols of which the origin is distinctly Buddhist, and symbols of which the shape cannot be traced to a Buddhist origin. In the first\n\n\u00b9 Under some of the kings of Judah the horses and chariots of the sun (2 Kings xxiii. 11) were stalled in the precincts of the Temple of Jerusalem. This dedication of horses to the sun was perhaps borrowed from the Persians (Herod. i. 189; Curt. iii. 3. \u00a7 11; Xen. Cyrop. viii. 3. \u00a7 24). The Armenians and the Massagetae sacrificed horses to the sun (Herod. i. 216; Xen. Anab. iv. 5. \u00a7 35). It is noticeable that the horse is frequently introduced into the Amar\u0101vati sculptures in a way not yet satisfactorily explained. Sun-images are frequently alluded to in the chronicles of Israel and Judah (Levit. xxvi. 30, etc.).\nclass must be placed (1) the d\u0101goba; (2) the empty throne of Buddha, probably signifying a spot where \u015a\u0101kya-muni had resided or taught; (3) the feet-impressions, evidently pointing to some locality considered sacred because the feet of the sage had trodden its dust. In the latter class come first, (4) the tree, and (5) the serpent, emblems founded on the popular traditions of the people, and probably Turanian in origin, though the tree may have been adopted by the Buddhists as a symbol of the sa\u1e45gha, the church, and very aptly so; and, secondly, three emblems, all as I believe of sun-origin; (6) the svastika, an Asiatic not merely Indian symbol; (7) the chakra, a wheel or fiery circle, generally represented as raised on a pillar; (8) the tri\u015bula, sometimes placed on a pillar like the chakra, and sometimes used, as at Amar\u0101vat\u012b, merely as an ornament,\u2014for instance, when oft-repeated, it forms the crowning cornice of the inner rail.\n\nI am mainly concerned with the svastika, chakra, and tri\u015bula.\n\nThe svastika and saurastika are so well known that I need not dwell long on them. They appear to have been symbols of Western-Asian origin, whether Semitic or Aryan matters little, and to have been adopted as emblematic of sun-motion. The point has been much disputed, but the sun-theory seems to be the one now most generally accepted. The symbol is found profusely amongst the ruins of the third, or burnt, city at Hissarlik, but not amongst those of the two earlier cities. Its use spread, possibly with Aryan emigrations, possibly with Magian astrology, westwards as far even as Britain; and, travelling eastwards, it was, if not introduced by the Aryans, at any rate adopted at an early date by the Hindus, and\n\n---\n\n1 Other figures carved on the Tope sculptures have been noticed as bearing a close resemblance to figures carved on monuments further West. Thus Fergusson called attention (Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 187, and note 3) to an ornament or design used on the roll-frieze of the outer rail at Amar\u0101vat\u012b\u2014\"an ornament new . . . . in so far as India is concerned,\"\u2014but which is found on the mystic representations of the Ephesian Artemis. It resembles the upper half of a little demon with upraised arms. A representation will be found in Falkener's Ephesus, p. 286. Amongst other points of resemblance between Hindu and Western-Asian symbolism may be noted the fact that in both countries sculptured deities are often represented as holding in one hand a slain deer.\n\n2 See above, note 1, p. 383.\nwas made use of in their sculptures and inscriptions. Its general acceptation seems to have been as a token of good-luck and prosperity, while romantic Buddhist teachers feigned that the feet of the Buddha himself were marked with these stigmata, proving that they accepted the sign as one of an older date than the birth of Buddha.\\(^1\\) P\u0101nini mentions the svastika as a sign branded for luck on the ears of cows.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe symbol called the chakra seems to be certainly an emblem of the sun. Its similarity, when raised on a pillar, to Assyrian types, has been repeatedly noticed, and it is useless for me to waste time by further discussion on the matter. As a symbol of the all-vivifying sun it was a most appropriate emblem of the Buddhist Dharma.\\(^3\\)\n\nThere remains the doubtful Trisula. What was its origin? Was it indigenous or exotic?\n\nThe figures given below are taken from Fergusson's *Tree and Serpent Worship*, and from Fergusson and Burgess's\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Tree and Serpent Worship*, plate lxxxvii. p. 229.\n\n\\(^2\\) Prof. Max M\u00fcller, in Schliemann's *Ilion* (pp. 346-7); Goldst\u00fccker, *P\u0101nini, his place in Sanskrit Literature*, p. 59.\n\n\\(^3\\) The chakra occupies the most prominent place on the summit of the north gateway of the S\u016bnch\u012b Tope, flanked by two trisulas.\nCave Temples.

My belief is\u2014I say it with diffidence, because I am fully aware that the idea will sound at first preposterous to many minds, and I admit myself fully open to conviction should a better origin be eventually suggested\u2014my belief is that this much-discussed trisula is nothing more nor less than a conventionalized scarab\u2014a sun-emblem derived from the Assyrians and Persians, and thence remotely from Egypt.\n\nIt may not be inappropriate to show how other symbols have spread from nation to nation, and been adopted by creed after creed, in order to afford some basis for the supposition that this theory need not be scouted as wildly improbable, more especially since I have already pointed out the apparently strong influence exercised by the Assyrians and Chaldaeans on the early inhabitants of India. I will take, for example, first the old Egyptian tau, or the crux ansata. Whatever this emblem originally signified, its rise began in Egypt. It was thence adopted by the Assyrians, and is found on sculptures at Khors\u0101b\u0101d, on ivories from Nimrud, and on Ninevite cylinders. It is observed on numerous coins of the Mediterranean coasts at a late period, especially on coins of Cyprus. Ezekiel the prophet was so impressed by the idea that the symbol was one of good luck, that, in his vision, he conceived the tau as marked on the foreheads of all those persons who were destined to be saved.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Tree and Serpent Worship*, p. 115.\n\n\\(^2\\) *id.* plates lxx, lxxi, lxxii.\n\n\\(^3\\) *Ezekiel* ix. 4, 6, 6.\nThe use of the *tau* somehow spread into ancient America, for it is found on sculptures at Palenque and Copan. A peculiar anthropomorphic form of the *tau*, found at the demolition of the serapeum at Memphis, appears to have given rise to the earlier semi-anthropomorphic form of the Ephesian Artemis, whence it spread into Greece. As a sign of security the *tau* was adopted by the Christian order of St. Anthony of Ethiopia, one of the earliest religious orders ever founded by Christians, dating about 370 A.D. It is found on Hebrew and Gnostic charms, and Joseph von Hammer points to it as the all-potent sign of the Knights Templars.\n\nSimilarly the winged globe of Egypt seems to have been accepted as a symbol of divine power and influence by the Chaldeans and Assyrians, as well as by other neighbouring races. Just as it was sculptured over the doorways of Egyptian pylons, so it finds similar place amongst the sculptured remains of those born imitators, the Phoenicians. In an anthropoid form it is universal in Assyria and Chaldea where it represents the sun-god Asshur, and afterwards in Persia where it stood for Ahura-Mazda, overshadowing and protecting the sovereigns in all their successful undertakings, whether in war or the chase. It is found as a guardian of doorways even in Mexico and Central America, though how it got there is at present a mystery.\n\n---\n\n1 See notes in the *Antiquary* of March and August, 1881.\n2 See Catherwood's *Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan* (1854), p. 385, for an example at Oc\u00f3singo in Chiapas.

Perrot and\nwinged globe had any intimate relation in origin with the scarabaeus I will not stop to consider, but certainly the emblem called the mihir, as seen in some Phoenician examples, may equally be looked at as a form of the pennate globe, or as a scarab in act of flight, and on the coins of some of the satraps the mihir stands in the same relation to the monarch whose figure is depicted on the obverse as the anthropoid winged globe does to the conquering kings of Assyria and Chald\u00e6a. It protects and guards him. In one coin the symbol appears to be a flying scarab (figure 3), with its wings extended; in another (figure 4) of the same satrap it is shaped like the pennate globe; while the emblem depicted in Di Cesnola's Cyprus, plate xxxv. 20, is clearly a large-winged scarab. The mihir is found, in some instances, on coins of Cyprus associated with Egyptian emblems; and I desire to call especial attention to the emblems in the field of the coins depicted in De Luynes's Numismatique et Inscriptions Cypriotes, plate ii. figures 14, 15, and plate vi. figures 7, 8, etc., since these emblems (figure 5), both over the lions on the obverse and over the male figures on the reverse occupy the same position as does the mihir in other coins, protecting and guarding the principal figure. The emblem in question is often called the taurus symbol.\n\nChipiez, i. 87 (Armstrong's translation). De Luynes, Numismatique et Inscriptions Cypriotes, pl. iii.

The fact that in both countries the symbol is used in a mutilated form, apparently for the sake of simplicity, may be used as a strong argument in favour of a common origin, for it is surely not usual thus to cut a symbol in half. In India the form is most undoubtedly a half-tri\u015bula, and in the Cyprian examples, though its origin is not so clear, its position on the coin suffices to identify it.\n\nThis mutilated form is constantly observed on Phoenician inscriptions,\\(^3\\) where it is elevated on a pedestal or standard\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Above, Figure 2, p. 392.\n\n\\(^2\\) The coin is from Fergusson's *Tree and Serpent Worship* (p. 162, No. 1), a coin of Krananda.

Plate ii. fig. 5 gives an excellent illustration of the wheel of the sun as used by the Phoenicians.\n(figure 8), and sometimes has attached to it under the circle a pair of flying strings, just as the Egyptian winged globe often has the serpents' tails, and as the Assyrian anthropoid form of the same emblem frequently has the flying ends of the god's waist-sash (figure 9).\n\nFigure 9.\n\nTo show how curiously symbols may be varied by ignorant sculptors, I may point to an instance of the winged globe found near the Limon Mine in New Segovia in America (figure 10), and figured in Pim and Seemann's Dottings on the Road-side in Panama, Nicaragua, and Mosquito (1869), p. 128. All the elements of the pennate globe are here in its Assyrianized form\u2014the central circular body, in this instance somewhat heart-shaped, the sidewings, the lower fan-shaped tail, and the two dangling ends under the wings. But whereas in Assyria the central body is converted into a wheel (the disk of the sun\u2014whence probably the origin of the idea of the Buddhist chakra), and the body of an anthropoid deity, the fan-like tails being the skirts of his robes and the dangling ends being the ends of his sash, here in America the sculptor has ignorantly dealt with the symbol just in the way that a child would. He has converted the central body into a face with roughly-cut nose, mouth, and eyes, and feeling himself bound in some way to account for the two ends that so often formed part of the original emblem, he has made them into two long moustaches depending from the upper lip of the rude face carved on the slab.\n\nFigure 10.\n\nThe above remarks will serve to show how the sacred emblems of Egypt have spread into other countries and\nbecome altered and conventionalized in the process. Now, without going necessarily so far away as Egypt, it is clear that the scarab was an emblem and a very important emblem to the Assyrians and peoples with whom the Hindus came in contact, and it is often found in a highly conventionalized form.\n\nThe original Egyptian type, as used in the hieroglyphs, is given in figure 11, taken from a sarcophagus in the British Museum, and some of its more highly conventional forms in figures 12, 13, both from the work of MM. Perrot and Chipiez. Figure 12 is taken from a scarab depicted on a patera, and Figure 13 from a cup as given by Layard. In both instances it is represented as elevated on a column or standard.\n\nThe scarab was also largely used by the Chald\u00e6ans, and they adopted its form for their gems and seals, just as did the Egyptians. Numbers of engraved scarabs are found in Babylonia. That the emblem was in general use amongst the nations of Western Asia is shown by the numbers of scarab\u00e6i that have been found, not only in Assyria and Chald\u00e6a, but in early Greek tombs all round the Mediterranean, in Cyprus, and in a hundred different places. One source whence they were derived has lately come to light,\n\n1 History of Art in Phanicia and Cyprus (Armstrong's translation), ii. 330, 331.\n2 id. i. 77.\nMr. Petrie having found at Naukratis several scarab-factories intended for export to the Mediterranean, the isles of Greece, the Phoenician colonies, and Etruria. The scarab was adopted by the Phoenicians at the same time as the cylinder (Assyria), and the cone (Asia Minor) as a pattern for their engraved gems, but the cylinder and cone gave way before the superior charms of the scarab and scaraboid, and the latter forms largely predominated in later years. A large number of scarabs have been found in Sardinia at Tharros. They bear engravings of degenerate Egyptian type, and mostly belong to the period between the end of the sixth and the end of the third century B.C., when Carthage was supreme in the Western Mediterranean, and the Punic cities in Sardinia enjoyed their greatest prosperity.\n\nA very important link between the Egyptian or Assyrian scarab and the Indian trisula will be found figured in Lajard's Culte de Mithra, plate x. figure 3. It is a scarab in a highly-conventionalized form (figure 14), engraved on a gem, having in the field the sun and moon, and at the side a Pahlavi legend, showing it to be probably of Sassanian origin. That the figure is intended to represent a scarab is clear from the fortunate representation on it of the ball of dung rolled up by the natural scarabaeus, which ball of dung is often found on other figures of the scarab much more closely resembling nature. If to the central member of this figure a pair of wings be added, there will be found at once the entire and unmistakeable Buddhist trisula (figure 1), complete in all its parts.\n\nComparison of the two designs can hardly fail to persuade any one that, if not intentional, the resemblance is certainly extraordinary. The details of course vary, but the form is identical.\n\nThe trisula is found repeated over and over again at Amar\u0101vati, at Buddha Gaya, at S\u0101\u00f1ch\u012b, and indeed on all\n\n---\n\n1 Edinburgh Review, Jan. 1886, p. 209.\n2 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 116, where it is figured.\nBuddhist Topes. That it was in use before the S\u0101\u00f1c\u012b Tope was erected is shown by the coin, given on figure 7 above, of K\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e0da, brother of Amogha, whom Thomas believed to be one of the nine Nandas, the predecessors of Chandragupta. Fergusson differs from this, asserting that the coin is more modern, but he declares it to be certainly older than the first of the S\u0101\u00f1c\u012b gateways, and his view is probably correct. The coin is figured in Tree and Serpent Worship (p. 162, note 1). It contains several of the common Buddhist emblems, including the tr\u012b\u015bula in its truncated shape, as in figure 2.\n\nFergusson, as I have already remarked, noticed the similarity between the tr\u012b\u015bula symbol, the caduceus of the god Mercury, and the sign of the planet Mercury. General Cunningham has made the same observation. Describing a coin of Pharaspes or Pharnaspes of the Alexandrian period, he mentions that it bears on it \u201ca caduceus without a handle, which is the zodiacal sign for Taurus.\u201d The symbol is, I contend, similar to the Buddhist truncated tr\u012b\u015bula (fig. 2), and similar to the Cypriot emblem alluded to above (fig. 6). That it is a coin of Persian origin is proved not only by the fact of its bearing a legend in Pahlav\u012b characters, but because the Assyrian man-headed winged bull on the obverse wears on his head a Persian tiara. My impression is that the tr\u012b\u015bula and the caduceus spring from precisely the same original\u2014the scarab.\n\nThe form of the Buddhist tr\u012b\u015bula as represented (figure 1) at Amar\u0101vati, for instance, is explainable thus. The body of the scarab is roughly drawn as a circle and often, as such, decorated with the circular lotus-disks of the outer rail with the conventional water-leaf ornament; the upraised fore-legs and the head become conventionalized into rounded raised arms with a prominent central member; the wings are depicted as leaf-like projections on each side of the body; the hind-legs are rendered in form similar to the\n\n---\n\n1 id. p. 116, note.\n2 J.A.S. Bengal, L., part i. p. 171 (1881).\nfore-legs, but, as is essential to the general idea, not so much decorated. The hind-legs, as I cannot avoid calling them, of the *tri\u015bula*, are specially noticeable, as the Amar\u0101vati examples give them a strangely animal look, especially about what would be the knee-joint. Moreover, it must be noted that the scarab proper (*figure* 11) is always depicted with certain necessary claw-like projections on the fore-legs, and none, or very slight ones, on the hinder legs. An exactly similar difference is observable in the Indian *tri\u015bula*, the extremities of the upper members being ornamented, often in trefoil-shape, while the lower extremities are left less marked. It was, perhaps, this absence of ornamentation about the lower members that led to their being discarded in the intermediate form given in Figure 15\u2014where the upper and middle members are strongly accentuated while the lower limbs have dwindled into mere extraneous adjuncts. This form is taken from the summit of the north gateway at S\u0101nchi.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe form of the *caduceus* may be explained thus. The body of the scarab is drawn as before in a circle, the fore- and hind-legs are placed in the usual position, the extremities of the fore-legs having a certain development wanting in the hind-legs, in accordance with requirements. The wings are omitted, as, viewing the original form (*figure* 12), they well might be. The whole being elevated on a staff, and the original form being lost sight of, the shape is conceived to represent two snakes twisted round one another, the developments at the extremities of the upper members taking, in this instance, the form of heads, the lower dwind-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Tree and Serpent Worship*, Plate x. a, p. 113.\nling to a point for the tail. Figures 16, 17 show the transition.\n\nFigure 16. Figure 17.\n\nIf the lower member be omitted, the caduceus assumes the form in which it was sometimes used by priests. There is a bronze specimen (figure 18) in the British Museum, of date 440-430 B.C. Here, it will be observed, the figures can hardly be looked on as twisted snakes, for they have no tails. This has the appearance of a transitional variety\u2014where the snakes' heads are merely introduced as an ornament at the ends of the two curved upper arms of the old taurus symbol (compare fig. 6b). In the Phoenician examples alluded to above (figure 8b), the same symbol is found. In a coin of Herod I. (B.C. 37-4) the same symbol is depicted, but with two little projections below (figure 19). These projections are certainly not snakes' tails. They are more like small wings, yet the whole symbol has been accepted as representing a caduceus. These instances seem to point to the origin of the caduceus being, not serpents twisted round a staff, but the old taurus symbol developed.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the celebrated idol of Jagann\u0101tha (Vish\u1e47u as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) at Puri in Cuttack was originally one of these tr\u012b\u015bulas. Figure 20, taken from General Cunningham's Bhilsa Topes, represents this well-\n\n---\n\n1 It bears the inscription \u039b\u039f\u039d\u0393\u0395\u039d\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u0395\u039c\u0399 \u0394\u0395\u039c\u039f\u03a3\u0399 . . . \"I am the public (herald \u1f11) of the people of Longan\u0113,\" a town in Sicily.\n2 Madden's Coins of the Jews, No. 4, p. 169.\n3 Thomas (J.R.A.S. n.s. Vol. I. p. 488) expressed his belief in the identity of this figure with the \"Taurus symbol.\"\nknown image. It shows an anthropomorphic tendency similar to the instances given above of the Assyrian and Persian symbols of Asshur and Ahura-Mazda, and of the Ephesian Artemis, the former being derived from the winged circle, the latter from the Egyptian tau.\n\nI have in my possession a remarkable Indian copper coin, of which a woodcut is given in figure 21. I know of no existing means of identifying this coin, but the form of the figure is archaic. It was given to me by Sir Walter Elliot, who was unable to assign it to any hitherto known series. The figure of Vishnu here appears with upraised arms in an attitude singularly recalling the trishul emblem, and the Jagannatha idol above alluded to. That it is clearly intended to represent Vishnu, and no other deity, is shown by the Vaishnavite emblem, the tortoise, at the side (the Kurma-avatara). The figures on this coin and at Puri further give rise to the question whether, after all, the mark which Vaishnavas at the present day place on their foreheads (figure 22), and which is generally looked on as some sort of trident, is not another modification of the trishula, the central circle being omitted (compare figure 7). I know of no other reasonable explanation of its form.\n\nWhile recognizing the danger and uselessness of carrying baseless identifications too far\u2014of allowing mere similarities\nof form to influence the mind\u2014I cannot refrain from pointing out with diffidence, and I admit without any sanction of proof, a similarity which struck me six years ago, and which I have since seen no reason absolutely to reject as absurd.\n\nOn the angles of the base of a bronze statuette found in a tomb in the Polledrara cemetery at Vulci in Etruria, and figured in Dennis's Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria (vol. i. p. 423), and Micali's Monumenti Inediti (1844), plate vi. fig. 2, is found the annexed figure (fig. 23).\u00b9 This is in all respects similar to the forms represented above. It has all the members of the scaraboid form so often alluded to\u2014the body, wings, fore-legs, and hind-legs\u2014the only difference being that in this instance the curve of the lower members is altered so as to bring the upper and lower limbs into conventional regularity. It must also be noticed that numbers of scarabs have been found in Northern Italy. With reference to its date, the author writes: \"The antiquity of this bust is proved, not only by the style, but by the workmanship,\u2014not being cast, but being formed of thin plates of bronze hammered into shape, and finished with the chisel\u2014the earliest mode of Etruscan toreutics.\" That the ornament was intended to be looked at in the position in which I have depicted it is clear from its place on the bronze plinth. Now, if any one will take the trouble to look at this woodcut from the side of the page, instead of holding the page in the usual way, he will observe that the figure is precisely that of a conventional fleur-de-lys. This may be a pure flight of fancy, but still it is noticeable that Northern Italy was, if not the home of the fleur-de-lys, at least one of the sites of its firm adoption. I lay no great stress on this identification, however, contenting myself with simply calling attention to the curious resemblance. The fleur-de-lys has been derived\n\n\u00b9 Most unfortunately the portion of bronze plinth on which the ornament is cut appears never to have found its way to the British Museum, where the rest of the bust is. But Micali is a very accurate and trustworthy copyist, and that the plinth did actually exist is proved by his alluding to it in his text.\nfrom a hundred different originals. This is merely a hundred and first.\n\nPostscript.\n\nThe Life of Apollonius of Ty\u0101na written by Philostratus has been alluded to above (p. 385). This work is generally supposed to be historically valueless. It is possible that Apollonius travelled to India about the year 40 A.D., but it is almost certain that this \"Life,\" which never made its appearance till it was presented to the Empress Julia Domna, the wife of Severus (A.D. 222-235), was a concocted fabrication, based on the information recorded by previous writers. As such, however, it has an importance of its own, which must not be lost sight of. The author of such a work is more careful than even a bona-fide traveller to write nothing that will not be believed. He may exaggerate accepted fallacies, but only because they have been accepted. From this point of view certain passages of this apocryphal \"Life of Apollonius,\" written possibly as late as the third century A.D., become very valuable for our present purpose. I quote from Priaulx's work.\n\nApollonius is represented as having his first interview with Phraotes, king of Takila;\u2014\"The king ordered the Babylonian guide to be treated with the hospitality wont to be shown to travellers from Babylon, and the satrap guide to be sent back home with the usual travelling allowance,\" while he converses with Apollonius in Greek and treats him with most marked courtesy. This shows at least that the Alexandrians of the third century A.D. believed that the overland journey from Babylon to India was a journey constantly made by travellers, that Babylonians were in the regular habit of making this journey, though Greeks seldom; that the Indian kings showed much courtesy to the travellers, and that such visits were so frequent that the travelling allowances paid to guides formed a recognized and well-known item of the expenditure of frontier sovereigns. We further learn from the story that the author considered\nit probable that Greek influence in Northern India had been very extensive.\n\nWe learn from the narrative that the Greek and Indian Philosophers were mutually acquainted with each other's systems, and held one another in honour\u2014a state of things that confirms the boast of A\u015boka alluded to above (p. 375). The same king, Phraotes, tells Apollonius that he had been \"brought up by his father in the Greek fashion till the age of twelve; that he was then sent to the Brahmins, and treated by them as a son, for 'they especially love,' he observed, 'those who know and speak Greek, as akin to them in mind and disposition.'\" Passages from Nicolaus Damascenus, Diodorus, Plutarch, Dio Chrysostom, and \u00c6lian, corroborate this account of the spread of Greek ideas, and the Greek language, amongst the Hindus.\n\nLater on we are introduced to a dull-witted and unenlightened monarch, who insults Apollonius. Being afterwards convinced of his error, we are told, \"the king burst into tears . . . . and attributed his prejudices against the Greeks to the tales and falsehoods of Egyptian travellers, who, while they boasted of their nation as wise and holy and author of those laws relating to sacrifices and mysteries which obtain in Greece, described the Greeks as men of unsound judgment, the scum of men . . . . etc. . . . .\" Third-century authors, then, believed that India was frequently visited by Egyptian travellers, as well as by Babylonians.\n\nIt is clear, then, that the author of this \"Life of Apollonius\" conceived that he would best impose on the credulity of his age by accepting a very close and frequent intercommunication between India, Babylon and Egypt, before and up to the date of Apollonius (40 A.D.), as in the regular nature of things. Had there been no such regular intercommunication, he would not have written the passages quoted above.\nNOTE BY SIR GEORGE BIRDWOOD ON THE ABOVE PAPER.\n\nEvery article of Hindu manufacture, excepting the non-descript curiosities made for Europeans, had a religious significance, and their ornamentation was all symbolical. For himself, he had no doubt that nearly every symbol in use in India came originally from Mesopotamia. This could not yet be demonstrated in every case; but he hoped the book he was preparing for the press would prove it in a great many cases: and it might be inferred, without direct proof, from the commercial history of India. He could not attribute much to the direct influence of Egypt, for it was operative millenniums before the appearance of the Aryas on the scene of history, yet indirectly it must have had a great initial influence on the development of Aryan arts. Egyptian caravan commerce became continuous with that of Mesopotamia about B.C. 2000, and thus helped to propagate a common Egypto-Mesopotamian type of industrial and decorative art from Inner Africa to Central Asia; and when the Aryas began to move into Persia, and India, and Anterior Asia, and Europe, they moved directly across this line of propagation of Egypto-Mesopotamian handicraft art, and this, probably, largely accounts for the obvious resemblances between the household arts of all the civilized and semi-civilized countries of the Old World. But the abiding influence of Mesopotamia on India, as still manifested, particularly in the arts of Southern India, where the effects of the Macedonian conquest were not directly felt, was not developed until the 7th and 6th centuries B.C., when Psammetichus I. in Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar III. in Babylonia, first organized the navigation and commerce of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, as it was carried on down to the conquests of the Saracens. Buddhism itself was the direct result in his (Sir George Birdwood's)\n\n1 This note is the substance of Sir G. Birdwood's reply to the President's question whether he had observed any indications of symbolism in Indian textile fabrics, when Mr. Sewell's paper had been read at the Society's Meeting on the 21st June, 1886.\nopinion, as he had some years ago stated in the *Athen\u00e6um*, of this enlarged commercial intercourse; for Buddhism was simply commercialized, internationalized Hinduism, which reverted at once to the national, strongly anti-commercial type, formulated in \"The Code of Manu,\" as soon as the old overland trade between the East and the West began to be broken up by the Mahomedans. Obviously as Buddhism itself, so its ritualistic symbolism also, must have owed much to the intercourse of the ancient Hindus with Mesopotamia. As to the *swastika* and the *trisula* being sun-symbols, they were phallic symbols before that. He (Sir George Birdwood) took no interest in phallic symbols until they assumed the poetic form of the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life; but there was no doubt in his mind that the *swastika* was the first symbol of the Garden of Eden, or before that of woman, and the *trisula* of the Tree of Life, or before that of man. It was a most interesting circumstance that the latest broch\u00e9 silk manufactured for the present London season was all over diapered with the *swastika* symbol, of the same askew type as is stamped on the leaden image of the Asian Venus found by Schliemann in the ruins of \"the 3rd,\" or \"burnt city\" (\"the Homeric Ilios\") at Hissarlik.\n\n18th Aug.\u2014Since writing out the above I have purchased at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition a very primitive-looking wooden ladle from Jun\u00e1gahr, where it is used to pour the libations of *ghi* in the sacrifices to Agni, \"the god of fire,\" \"the south,\" etc. The bowl is fashioned as the *yoni-lingam* symbol, and immediately over it is carved the symbol *Ananda-varta*, \"the Country of Bliss,\" in which the *swastika* is represented within a square or four-sided enclosure, while at the back of it is carved a tortoise, the universal emblem in the East of fecundity.\u2014G.B.\nART.

That is how, studying Babylonian astronomy, a subject so difficult that few scholars have ventured to take it, I arrived, after many doubts and hesitations, at the conclusion that, when the Akkadians appeared in Mesopotamia, the country was already occupied by a Semitic population possessing a certain degree of civilization and the art of writing.\n\nIt required many strong evidences to bring me round to this opinion, for I, like most Assyriologists, accepting the statement of the Babylonians themselves, and also through an excusable and natural enthusiastic desire to attribute all the highest achievements to the Akkadians, looked at them as the inventors of the Cuneiform writing, and the first civilizers of Western Asia.\nThough the Assyriologists were unanimous on the matter, they held very different opinions as to the way in which this Akkadian civilization was developed and imparted to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians attributing indeed everything to the Akkadians make no clear statement as to the origin of their civilization. Two opinions prevailed. Some thought that the Akkadians were in possession of the country, and had made the first steps in civilization, and invented writing, when the Semites invaded it either violently by force of arms or peacefully by slow colonization, substituting themselves little by little for the previous inhabitants. Others thought that the Akkadians invaded Babylonia, bringing \"with them along with their religion, their legends and traditions, their laws, their art, their building knowledge, agricultural skill, and that great civilizer of nations\u2014the art of writing.\" These were, however, mere suppositions, for, as far back as we can go, we see Semites and Akkadians living side by side on friendly terms, all remembrance even of the period of struggle of the two races seeming to have been lost in the Babylonian literature.\n\nIt is the study of the names of the stars in astrological texts of the Cuneiform inscriptions which revealed to me first the priority of the Semitic civilization. As already noticed by the late F. Lenormant,\u00b9 several names of stars are evidently Semitic, and these Semitic names are found in the Akkadian column of the bilingual list as:\n\n\\[ \\text{D.P. da-pi-nu},^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{D.P. bi-il-bu},^3 \\text{ etc.} \\]\n\nMore often, however, the names of stars are written ideographically, but their Semitic reading is made certain by the presence in the compound of prepositions, of the relative \\( \\ddot{s}a \\), and of the phonetic complements. For instance,\n\n\\[ \\text{is explained by mus-ta-bar-ru mu-ta-nu},^4 \\]\n\n\u00b9 Who however admits inability to detect the cause of this anomaly.\n\u00b2 W.A.I. vol. ii. pl. 48, l. 50.\n\u00b3 ibid. l. 63. These words are also found in the Semitic column in other lists.\n\u2074 W.A.I. vol. v. pl. 46, l. 42. In the following pages, in the quotations of this work, the first number will indicate the volume, the second the plate, and the third the line.\ntherefore this name must be Semitic, as *anu* is the formative of the plural in Semitic Babylonian, and not in Akkadian; and are ideograms to be read in the Semitic language.\n\nThere is still less doubt in this name:\n\nwhich must be read *kakkab ma\u0161 tabba \u0161a ina \u0161i-id kakkab si\u0161-si-na issusu* \u2018the double twin star which is fixed by the side of the star sibzina.\u2019 In this sentence we have the relative *\u0161a* and the preposition *ina*, *\u0161i-id* written phonetically, and the ideogram with the phonetic complement *zu*.\n\nIn many cases the Babylonians, themselves attributing all their knowledge to an Akkadian origin, have tried to explain these Semitic names of stars by the Akkadian, and often failed to give an explanation in agreement with the meaning preserved traditionally. We have a striking example in W.A.I. vol. ii. pl. 47, l. 15 to l. 23. The tablet reproduced there contains part of a commentary explaining some astrological works. The scribe therefore tries to give an explanation of this name of star:\n\nThe scribe gives as translation for *maladdu*, and compares it to translated by *mar-rim*; for he gives three different readings with three translations; but he seems to know the traditional meaning, and adds:\n\n*SAR-DA=a-gi-e saruti, ana a\u0161u ilu bel ki gab\u00fb*, \u2018SARDA=crown of royalty, for the rising of God, the lord, as they say.\u2019\n\n---\n\n1 W.A.I. iii. 37, 58.\n2 W.A.I. ii. 47, 16; and v. 46, 12, in this last list is added after *\u0161ame*, *\u0161ame* to be read *rabu* \u2018great,\u2019 qualificative of *\u0161ame*, with the determinative prefix of divinity, *divinely great*, so to say.\n3 W.A.I. ii. 47, 17-23.\n4 This tablet is written in a peculiar style; *ti* is always written instead of .\nThe name of the star is, however, clear enough: the scribe would not have had to dismiss it in this off-handed way, if he had not obstinately looked at it with the preconceived idea that it was Akkadian, and is to be read:\n\n\\[ \\text{nabu sarda D.P. anim rubu \u0161a \u0161ame} \\]\n\n\u2018it proclaims the royalty of Anu, prince of heaven.\u2019\n\nbu is the phonetic complement of the ideogram \u2018a word,\u2019 and here for \u2018speak, proclaim, announce,\u2019 u that of \u2018prince,\u2019 and that of \u2018heaven\u2019 (this last is often found so written), sarda is the accusative in the construct state regimen of the verb and written phonetically, anim genitive with mimmation is also written phonetically, \u0161a is the relative used as in Assyrian to express the emphatic genitive.\n\nThe scribes had even, in some cases, lost the tradition of the meaning. We have, for instance, the name , ideogram explained by ha-ba-\u0161i-ra-nu,\u00b9 and translated \u2018tail\u2019 by Prof. Sayce, who is probably right; the phonetic reading was no doubt used in the astrological texts, as is the case for other names.\u00b2 The scribe who wrote the tablet published in W.A.I. vol. v. pl. 46, seems, however, to have forgotten that, and tries to explain the word by treating it as Akkadian phonetically written.\n\nha-ba is rendered by ahbut, the Assyrianized feminine form of the supposed Akkadian word haba, and \u0161i-ra-nu is explained by sir Anu \u2018the field of Anu.\u2019\u00b3\n\nMany other examples could be added.\n\nAs already noticed by the late F. Lenormant,\u2074 Akkadian contains many Semitic words; it is what we should expect.\n\n\u00b9 W.A.I. ii. 49, 47.\n\u00b2 We find and , the first group being a compound ideogram, and the second the phonetic rendering, both used in connected texts.\n\u00b3 This explanation is the more curious because Akkadian is never written phonetically in this way, and in this supposed compound the god Anu would be written in a very abnormal way, and the scribe had to neglect the name of another god Nin-gir-su, one of the oldest, whose name is found on the earliest inscriptions, and the great god of Gudea. The group of stars designated by the compound ideogram represented, no doubt, the tail of this god.\n\u2074 In his \u00c9tudes Akkadiennes.\nHe, however, explains it by a long intercourse, but in this case the oldest texts would be purer and freer from borrowed words, which is not the case; in the oldest inscriptions we find already these Semitic words more or less Akkadianized, as in the later times. These words besides, as we shall see further on, indicate a more advanced state of civilization. If we accept the priority of the Semitic civilization, and their occupation of Mesopotamia previous to the Akkadian invasion, everything is easily explained, and we see how the syntactical order of the languages of the two populations, which has been a puzzle to the philologist, is the result of mutual influences, both having as formula V 2458.\n\nWhen the Akkadians invaded Babylonia, the formula\\(^1\\) of their grammar was I 1358, this is shown by the order of the incorporated pronouns.\\(^2\\) The grammar of the Semitic population in possession of the land had the formula IV 2467. This is shown by the position of the pronouns when united to the verb at the permansive, which is the verbal noun in the construct state. For instance, in saknat-ka 'she places thee,' we have sakna the verb, at the suffix of the 3rd pers. feminine subject, and ka the suffix of the 2nd pers. in regimen.\\(^3\\) This ideological order is the one preserved in Hebrew and Arabic which has escaped to the Turanian influence.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I adopt the ingenious formul\u00e6 designed by Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie for his syntactical comparative study in his course of lectures at University College. The indices are:\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n| I | a.+s.+v. |\n| II | a.+v.+s. |\n| III | v.+a.+s. |\n| IV | v.+s.+a. |\n| V | s.+a.+v. |\n| VI | s.+v.+a. |\n\n\\(^2\\) The primitive position of the Akkadian genitive and adjective, which is given in this formula, is preserved in the compound expressions, as usually happens, so we have \\(\\text{\u0161u} \\text{\u0161u} \\text{\u0161u} \\text{\u0161u} \\text{\u0161u}\\) ana-saga-su 'in the midst of the sky,' word for word 'sky-midst-in.'\n\n\\(^3\\) Often languages preserve in the verbal forms traces of the different stages through which they have passed. For instance, in French Le chat tue la souris gives s.+v.+a. of formula VI, which is the one of modern French; but, when the nouns are represented by pronouns il la tue, it gives s.+a.+v., which is the Latin formula; if now we consider that in the verb tu-e the subject is expressed by the suffix e, we have le tu-e a.+v.+s. formula II, which is that of the early Aryan languages.\n\n\\(^4\\) I say Turanian influence, because I accept the Turanian affinity of Akkadian.\nWhen the two populations came in contact, they must have found in the different, nay opposed, ideological order of their languages a great impediment in their intercourse. The Akkadian conquerors imposed their language; but, to be understood, they had to modify their syntax, and little by little these changes passed into the pure Akkadian. The Akkadians adopted partly the syntactical order of their Semitic subjects. The order of the nominative and genitive, of the noun and adjective, were reversed; the verb was left at the end of the sentence, but with the position of the subject and object reversed. The primitive ideological order was preserved in the verbal incorporation, no doubt, because the Semites having no such incorporation, it escaped their influence. The Akkadian texts give few, though very few, examples of the primitive syntactical order.\n\nThe language of the primitive Babylonian Semites, which caused such a perturbation in the Akkadian grammar, was also deeply affected, as we see by the Assyrian of the literary period. It kept, when it was only a popular vernacular dialect, for a longer period its primitive syntactical order. The proper names of the Semites preserved in the earliest commercial documents give us indeed specimens of the intermediary stages through which it had to pass. In these proper names we have many examples of verbs followed by their subjects, as *nidin-Nana* 'N. gave,' *bani-Sin* 'S. created,' *erib-Sin* 'S. came,' *iribam-Sin* 'S. increased.'\n\n1 These examples, already noticed by F. Lenormant, were considered by him as abnormal constructions.\n2 At Nineveh, which was far from the Akkadian centre of civilization, and where the Akkadians had remained, perhaps, in smaller number, the writers followed less closely the Babylonian syntactical order. Even in the official records of the Ninevite kings there is a great liberty in the arrangement of the words, the regimen of the verb is often rejected after it, etc. We have also in the Babylonian Semitic texts examples of similar inversions; but, of course, in literary works we must take into account the desire of the author for giving variety to his periods and the licence in which he indulges.\n3 B. 66, l. 34, and B. 83, l. 8. The private tablets of this early period (Rim-Sin, Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna) have been copied by Dr. Strassmaier and published in the Transactions of the Orientalists' Congress held at Berlin.\n4 B. 57, l. 14.\n5 B. 42, l. 35.\n6 B. 65, l. 14; 71, l. 31; 91, l. 22, etc.\nibni-Sin\u00b9 \u2018S. created,\u2019 igmil-Sin\u00b2 \u2018S. favoured,\u2019 ibus-Ea\u00b3 \u2018E. made,\u2019 iskur-Ea\u2074 \u2018Ea recorded,\u2019 etc. The proper names giving a complete sentence with an object are naturally rare; the examples we have show, however, that the object, being less intimately connected to the verb, was first rejected before; this is the intermediary stage, the formula of this construction being II:\n\narda-lu\u0161tamar-\u0160ama\u0161\u2075 \u2018may Shamas enlighten the slave.\u2019\n\n\u0160ama\u0161-ia-banit-Beltu-Gula\u2076 \u2018the lady Gula has created my light.\n\nTo understand well the transformation of the early Babylonian grammar, we must not forget how the tenses of the Semitic verb were developed.\u2077 The Assyrian permansive, which took such a great importance in the cognate languages, was primitively the verbal theme, or a kind of verbal noun in the construct state followed by the pronominal suffixes forming a genitive of position: nasa-ku, 1st pers. permansive of nasu, is \u2018the bringing of me\u2019 or \u2018my bringing,\u2019 i.e. \u2018I bring or brought.\u2019 The name Bani-Sin gives an example of a noun being attached to the verb as the pronoun; the meaning is \u2018Sin created,\u2019 but really \u2018the creating of Sin.\u2019 This way of expression not being found clear enough, the Semites, by the use of auxiliaries, developed another tense, the aorist;\u2078 but, as the auxiliary became in time agglutinated\n\n\u00b9 B. 32, l. 7; 62, l. 34; 78, l. 27, etc.\n\u00b2 B. 65, l. 22; 73, 30.\n\u00b3 B. 57, l. 43; 84, l. 21; 89, l. 18, etc.\n\u2074 B. 89, l. 18.\n\u2075 B. 52, l. 16; 73, l. 9. See also Pinches, S.B.A. Proceedings, 1st December, 1885, p. 9.\n\u2076 S.B.A. Proceedings, 1885\u20136, p. 48, l. 33. In this name \u0160ama\u0161 means not the Sun-god, but the \u2018guiding light,\u2019 as we say \u2018his guiding star,\u2019 and the French astre or \u00e9toile.\n\u2077 See Berth, Suggestions on the Formation of the Semitic Tenses, Journal of the R.A.S. Vol. XIV. pp. 105\u2013118.\n\u2078 This tense is called present or future by those who wrote Arabic grammars, but this name cannot suit, as in Assyrian it designated generally the past, and became the historical tense. I have proposed, in the paper quoted above, the name of aorist-past for the permansive or preterit of the Hebrew, and aorist-present for the other tense, in imitation of the terms adopted by de Roug\u00e9 in his Egyptian Grammar. The permansive, as we know it in the late inscriptions, was not the one used in the early period, the first person in ku, and the third (this being the verbal theme in the masculine or feminine) may be the primitive forms, but the second person appears to be a later form introduced by Aramean in-\nto the verbal noun, and was considered as forming only one word with it, the subject was placed after by the Pre-Akkadian Semites, as in Arabic and Hebrew; we have, therefore, such names as Igmil-Sin, Izkur-Ea, Ibni-Sin, etc. The nearly complete loss of the permansive in Babylonian and Assyrian is due, no doubt, to Akkadian influence. The preformatives of the aorist were, by false analogy, compared to the incorporated pronouns of the Akkadian verb, and this tense, being more easily understood by the Akkadian conquerors, was the one mostly used by the conquered Semites.\n\nThe force and origin of the suffixes of the permansive and of the prefixes of the aorist were lost at an early date, and that is not due to Akkadian influence, as the same thing happened in the cognate Arabic and Hebrew. We found, therefore, the pronominal suffixes of the accusative attached to the verb and followed by the noun subject:\n\n*etel-ka-Sin.*\n\nThe most important conclusion to which the study of these early proper names brings us is that the Babylonian Semites, before the arrival of the Akkadians, possessed already the fully-developed Semitic grammar: construct state and cases in the nouns as in Arabic, abstracts formed by the feminine suffixes, permansive, aorist and voices formed by affixes, etc., as in Hebrew and other cognate tongues. The difference with later Babylonian is indeed most trifling, as the use of the mimmation with the verb as in *iribam-Sin*, which is still noticed in the inscriptions of Hammurabi, and the use of *d* (perhaps *t*) by the side of *t* in the formation of abstracts, as in *sarda*, construct of *sarutu*.\n\nThere is, however, a peculiarity which would be of very great importance, if it could be established beyond doubt,\n\nfluence; the primitive forms of the permansive, which are composed by suffixing the personal possessive pronouns, must have been very similar to the aorist of Ethiopian.\n\n1 B. 42, l. 12; 53, l. 13, etc.\n2 The form *lu\u0161amar*, which we have seen above, is the precative of the secondary Shaphel voice or Istaphel.\nthat is, what appears to be the use of the feminine for the masculine in the third person of the permansive, we have:\n\n*nabat kakkabu*\\(^1\\) 'the star proclaims,'\n\nwhere the masculine noun in the nominative *kakkabu* seems to be the subject of *nabat*, third person fem. of the permansive of *nabu*.\n\n*nidnat Sin*\\(^2\\) 'Sin gave,'\n\nwhere the verb is also in the feminine. There are other examples, but, as stated before, we have also the 3rd pers. masc.; the use of the feminine would not, therefore, be exclusive, and these examples would only indicate a tendency.\\(^3\\)\n\nWas there, we may ask, in Mesopotamia, when the Semites arrived in it, an older population having a different grammatical conception, and under the influence of which this tendency would have been developed? or are we to see in it the result of an Akkadian influence, the Akkadian not being a sex-denoting language? or has it, after all, come simply from a natural decay, as in Egyptian?\n\nThere may be still another explanation. As we have seen, the permansive was not properly a tense, but the verbal theme followed by the suffixes of the pronouns, these being in the genitive by position. *Bani-Sin* 'the creating of Sin,' came to mean 'Sin created' only by development, as it happened also in Egyptian. The 3rd person of the permansive, for the same reason, has no suffix, for the noun subject was, so to say, suffixed to the verb, and ought to be followed by a feminine noun as well as by a masculine one. We find among the proper names, indeed, *gamil-Gula*,\\(^4\\) which may be considered as the 3rd pers. of a permansive, followed by the name of the goddess, and 'the favour of Gula' is 'Gula favours,' as in the case of *Bani-Sin*. The use of this tense, formed by means of suffixes with the noun as subject,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) W.A.I. v. 46, l. 40. There exists in Syriac a feminine form for the word 'star,' but here the termination shows that we have a masculine word.\n\n\\(^2\\) B. 30, l. 24; 38, l. 24; 42, l. 29.\n\n\\(^3\\) On the other side, we have feminine noun with verb in the masculine, as *Nidin-Nana* and *Gamil-Gula*.\n\n\\(^4\\) Strassmaier, No. 24, l. 23.\nmust have arisen in the Semitic tongues only when the notion of its formation had been lost, or perhaps also from the emphatic repetition of the subject.\\(^1\\) In early Babylonian, as in the other Semitic tongues, the abstract nouns were formed by the suffix \\textit{at}, which is also the suffix of the 3rd pers. fem. of the permansive. In the cases mentioned before we may have abstracts in the construct state, \\textit{nabat kakakabu}\\(^2\\) would be \u2018the proclamation or proclaiming of the star,\u2019 \\textit{nidnat-Sin} \u2018the gift or giving of Sin,\u2019 which carry to the mind exactly the same sense as the permansive.\n\nWhat, however, seems to contradict this explanation is the fact that in the proper names of the earliest commercial documents we often find names composed with the same elements, but reversed, as \\textit{Sin-turam}\\(^3\\) and \\textit{turam-ilia}\\(^4\\), \\textit{Gamil-Sin}\\(^5\\) and \\textit{Sin-Gamil}\\(^6\\), and also the same root as the aorist form \\textit{igmil-Sin}\\(^7\\); if \\textit{turam} and \\textit{gamil} are verbal forms, so are no doubt the forms in \\textit{at}.\n\nIf we now turn to the syllabary, we find a great many proofs of the priority of the Semitic civilization.\n\nIt has been said that the Cuneiform syllabary is very badly adapted to Assyrian, but the same may be said with still more reason as regards Akkadian; the vowels, for instance, which play an important part in this language, are often doubtful. When the Akkadian conquerors tried to apply to their language the system of writing, partly ideographic and partly phonetic, of their Semitic subjects, they had to modify and reform it in a certain measure. The ideograms were taken bodily, but read in accordance with the Akkadian vocabulary; these new pronunciations were taken as new phonetic values, though in many cases the Semitic value was retained; hence the polyphonism. In practice, however,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the Latin tongues, and especially in French, the subject is expressed in the same way, though the person is implied by the flexion.\n\n\\(^2\\) We should expect the genitive \\textit{kakkabi} in this case, though the Babylonians often neglected it; we find \\textit{Belit biri} and \\textit{Belit biru} \u2018the lady of Wisdom,\u2019 one of the names of Tasmetum.\n\n\\(^3\\) B. 24, l. 25.\n\n\\(^4\\) B. 55, l. 24.\n\n\\(^5\\) B. 52, l. 60; 95, l. 22.\n\n\\(^6\\) B. 97, l. 2.\n\n\\(^7\\) See above.\nall the values were not accepted by the two populations, some remained exclusively Akkadian, and some exclusively Semitic.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt may even be that at first there were two distinct syllabaries, and that the phonetic values passed from one syllabary into the other slowly, as words passed from one vocabulary into the other.\n\nThe Akkadian scribes seem to have felt the want of precising more accurately the pronunciation of the words expressed by the ideograms. In a great many cases they wrote the pronunciation inside or by the side of them, as:\n\n\\[ \\text{and} \\quad \\text{a-lim}.^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{u-ru}.^3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{za for asa}.^4 \\]\n\nand a great many others.\n\nThis system of explaining the pronunciation of an ideogram by another group has been also resorted to by the Egyptian scribes: it is what is called phonetic determinatives.\n\nWhen the Akkadians had to borrow a Semitic word, expressed by an ideogram, they felt more than ever the want of determining its pronunciation. For example, the word for 'price' simu in Assyrian passed into Akkadian, its Akkadianized form is therefore written inside \\( \\text{se-am}.^5 \\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) F. Lenormant has already pointed out this, and lays a great deal of stress on it. Many values used in the Babylonian Semitic texts must have come through Sumerian, as they indicate the phonetic changes of the two dialects. This arises, perhaps, because the Semitic renaissance took place when the Sumerian had acquired the supremacy, and some of the phonetic peculiarities of Sumerian may be due to the Semitic influence.\n\n\\(^2\\) T. G. Pinches, *Archaic Forms of B. Characters*, in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung, vol. ii. p. 168. As the author here notices, the Sumerian texts give \\( \\text{s-lum} \\), written phonetically without the ideogram, that is one of the peculiarities of Sumerian, which being a dialect has developed the phonetism more than Akkadian. In Sumerian texts, when the words are expressed by ideograms, they are to be read in their dialectical forms, and it is when the Semitic Babylonians adopted these ideograms that they introduced Sumerian values in their syllabary.\n\n\\(^3\\) W.A.I. i. 1, 99. The name of the character is \\( \\text{ugudili} \\) (W.A.I. iii. 70, 33); but as Prof. Sayce has noticed (S.B.A. vol. vi. p. 469), when the characters of the syllabary were classified and named, the Babylonians had lost all idea of their primitive form and origin.\n\n\\(^4\\) W.A.I. iii. 70, 82. No doubt such is also the origin of the ideogram for 'tongue' \\( \\text{eme} \\), that is \\( \\text{me} \\) inside, indicating the pronunciation.\n\n\\(^5\\) W.A.I. ii. 2, 335. This ideogram is of very common use in the commercial documents down to the latest period. I have been very careful not to speak of the Semites as the inventors of writing, for I wish not to treat of this question.\nAll the pronunciations written in this way are Akkadian, which shows that the reform was done by the Akkadians; the Semites, however, adopted these signs so modified as mere ideograms, retaining the Akkadian explanations added to the primitive groups, no doubt to maintain terms understood by both populations.\n\nThere is a very interesting group, full of revelation; the ideogram for 'mother' umu in Assyrian; the primitive Semite term was no doubt ama, preserved in the Hebrew \u05d0\u05de\u05d4 'handmaid,' triliteralized form of ma, which has been preserved in Egyptian. The Semites before the Akkadian invasion had the group \u05d0\u05de\u05d4 for 'mother.' When the Akkadians adopted the writing, they wrote in the group the pronunciation of an or ana, which was their term for 'mother,' thus: \u05d0\u05de\u05d4 and \u05d0\u05de\u05d4. The Semites adopted this reformed group as an ideogram; but the Semitic word was in course of time adopted by the Akkadians, so that the group remained with the phonetic determinative of a word, abandoned only as a witness of the reform of the syllabary. It might be objected that the Akkadians would not borrow such a word as 'mother,' but it is easily explained for the Akkadians, as all the successful invaders must have taken wives from the conquered population; the Semitic mother of the young Akkadians taught their children to call them ama and not ana, so the word passed into Akkadian.\n\nThe priority of the Semitic knowledge of writing explains the Akkadian reversed reading of certain compound groups. The Semites, to give the ideographic idea of 'king,' formed\n\nnow, though there is evidence to show that they borrowed this art. When the Semites used it, they never reformed it, and till the latest period they employed the same cumbrous and ill-fitted syllabary.\n\n1 We have no example of the use of this group with the meaning of 'mother,' but we have no document of the early period in which it would have been in use.\n\n2 W.A.I. iv. 14, 24.\n\n3 Sayce's Syll. No. 147. In the early texts the phonetic complement is written outside, thus: \u05d0\u05de\u05d4.\n\n4 In our modern languages we see foreign words for other reasons taking the place of such fundamental native ones, as in English papa for dada, the infantine appellation for 'father,' in French bab\u00e9, is now mostly used; this came through fashion. In Akkadian ama was substituted for ana, because the mother's language is that of home, as the language of the priest is that of church; all the Mahomedan countries have for this reason adopted the word Allah for 'God.'\nthe group \u1d48\u1e25\u2083, analysed \u1d48\u1e25\u2083, the sign for the great one, the prince rubu, and \u1d48\u1e25\u2083 the sign for 'men,' ni\u0161u. When the Akkadians adopted the Babylonian syllabary, they translated the two compounds according to their ideological order, not yet modified by Semitic influence, lu-gal 'men's chief'; but treating the compound group as a single ideogram, they did not change the order of its two elements; on account of this there always was from the earliest period a tendency to fuse the two characters into one, so that it became in time \u1d48\u1e25\u2083 at Nineveh, and \u1d48\u1e25\u2083 at Babylon.\n\nSo is to be also explained \u1d48\u1e25\u2083, composed of \u1d48\u1e25\u2083 gal 'chief,' and \u1d48\u1e25\u2083 'assembly,' in Assyrian pu\u1e2bru. The Akkadian following this primitive ideological order said 'assembly's chief' \u1d48\u1e25\u2083-gal, which became \u1d48\u1e25\u2083, explained in Assyrian by mu\u1e2biru 'leader.' In the same way is no doubt to be also explained the other compound ideograms with reversed reading.\n\nThe words or ideographical compound groups in which parts of their elements, generally the second and third, are reversed, have, however, another origin, and proceed from the primitive system of arranging the groups together.\n\nThe earliest documents appear to have been written on narrow strips of papyrus, bark, or leaves, divided in small columns containing two or three, rarely four, characters in their width, the groups forming one expression, as 'son of so and so,' 'my god so and so,' 'strong king,' 'I built it,'\n\n1 I give here the archaic form, which has preserved clearly the compounding elements.\n2 Ni\u0161u means 'men' as a collective, for this reason it also translates \u1d48\u1e25\u2083 \u1d48\u1e25\u2083 kalamma 'country.'\n3 W.A.I. ii. 2, 398.\n4 ibid. ii. 1, 126.\n5 There are few compounds in which the position of the elements indicates that they must have been created by the Akkadian before they had changed their grammar; these compounds represent ideas which did not exist among the Semites previous to the Akkadian invasion.\n6 Sayce, Use of Papyrus, etc., S.B.A. Trans. vol. i. p. 343 et seq. The use of papyrus or other similar materials was kept at all periods (see Pinches, S.B.A. Trans. vol. vi. p. 210). I take the opportunity to notice that the form of the characters depends very much on the material used. The lineary characters are traced on soft stones, as sand-stone, for instance, and are no proof of the higher antiquity of the document. We find inscriptions of the same king written some in lineary and some in cuneiform characters.\netc., were separated by a line. This primitive arrangement was retained when other materials were used for writing, stone, clay, etc., though the new materials afforded the means of a better arrangement; so we see the cylinder of Gudea divided in these narrow columns, many words having to be divided when larger columns would have enabled the scribe to write easily the whole of the words in one line. The columns followed one another from top to bottom, and the divisions of each column from right to left, but the groups of characters in each division of the column were arranged rather irregularly, though always beginning in the right-hand top corner, the second character was placed either on the left of the first or under it. This margin left to the scribe has thrown a certain confusion in the grouping of characters. The following diagram will give an idea of these variations:\n\n| 2 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 3 |   | 4 | 2 | 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 4 |   | 5 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 |   |   |\n\n| 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 4 |   | 3 | 6 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 |   |   |\n\nSo we find in the early inscriptions, for instance:\n\n\\[ \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EV}^2 \\text{ and } \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EI}^3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{EI} \\rightarrow \\text{EV} \\rightarrow \\text{EI} \\]\n\n---\n\n1 The irregular arrangement of the characters in each division reminds us of the Maya system of writing, sometimes called calculiform writing. There was the same or still greater hesitation and incertitude as to the sequence of the various elements in each division. There was, however, it seems, a greater tendency to arrange the characters in columns in Cuneiform as in Egyptian, especially if their forms fitted to this arrangement; as for the name of Lagas (see above). It must be borne in mind that at a later time the Babylonian scribes altered their way of writing, so that the characters were placed on the side; therefore, the columns ran from left to right, and the groups followed one another also from left to right. It is thus that we print it in our quotations.\n\n2 Unpublished inscription, but this order is rare for this name.\n\n3 De Sarsec, *D\u00e9couvertes en Chald\u00e9e*, pl. 4, A; pl. 6, No. 4. It is the grouping mostly used no doubt because the characters fitted better in this order.\nalso written in one line \\( \\text{Lagas} \\), which is the ideographical expression of the town of Lagas. The scribes of the later period copied either \\( \\text{sir-gul-la-ki} \\) or \\( \\text{sir-la-gul-ki} \\). The whole group being taken as a compound ideogram to be read Lagas, the position of its elements was immaterial.\n\nA careful study of the syllabary and of the phonetic reading of the characters used in the texts shows that many values of the pre-Akkadian Semitic period must have been lost. These forgotten or disused values are still found in certain expressions and names handed down from the early period. We found many instances of these expressions in the names of stars and in the names of gods. For instance:\n\n\\( \\text{dil-mut} \\), which gives for \\( \\text{mut} \\), also found in the name of another star \\( \\text{mustabarru mut-a-nu} \\).\n\n\\( \\text{rimanu} \\), (word formed like \\( \\text{lisanu} \\)), from the value \\( \\text{rim} \\) 'Wind.'\n\n\\( \\text{Bel} \\) 'the lord'; if read in Akkadian, it would be the god \\( \\text{En} \\).\n\n1 Ibid. pl. 8; pl. 16, etc.\n2 I transcribe so, because it is the reading adopted by many Assyriologists; but it is a compound ideogram, that is, a group the elements of which do not correspond to the reading, but in which the various ideograms gave the idea rendered by the pronounced word. In the case of this group of four characters it is certain that it never was pronounced with the phonetic value of these characters.\n3 Pinches, Guide to the Kouyunjik Gallery, London, 1883, p. 7, note.\n4 The reading of \\( \\text{mut} \\) for \\( \\text{dil-mut} \\) is proved by a variant in an unpublished tablet, which gives \\( \\text{dil-mu} \\), the masculine form perhaps, 2\u00b0 by the fact that this group \\( \\text{dil-mut} \\) is used to write the name of the town identified with the modern delam \\( \\text{dilmut} \\) would be the old feminine form.\nThis name is besides a thorough Semitic word (see Freytag, Dict. vol. ii. p. 51).\n5 See above.\n6 This value \\( \\text{rim} \\) is also the one used in a star-name (W.A.I. ii. 47, 24).\n\\( \\text{explained by i-sa-ri-im i-lak} \\), which leaves us no doubt as to the reading of \\( \\text{in the star-name. It is to be noticed that in the explanation the grammatical order is reversed: in the old name the verb was first. The word rim 'wind' may be compared with the Hebrew \\( \\text{rim} \\). The Babylonian syllabary confuses the \\( m \\) and the \\( w \\); rim is for \\( riw \\). Babylonian weakens the aspirate, \\( n \\) became no doubt \\( n \\), and then lost.\nIt must also be granted that, if the Semites had adopted a syllabary already invented by the Akkadians, they would have either borrowed bodily the ideogram corresponding to the Akkadian gods, or would have written the name of theirs phonetically. This is not the case; the Semites, though they seem to have identified their gods with those of the Akkadians, have a different set of ideograms to represent them. The ideograms of the Akkadian gods can besides often be explained by the Akkadian phonetic reading of their components, and the names of the Semitic gods are rarely explained by reading the characters phonetically; but when it is so, the Semitic, not the Akkadian, value of the signs must be taken. In other cases the names are compound ideogrammatic groups.\n\nAs already noticed, many words passed from Akkadian into the Semitic Babylonian, and from the latter into the former. Many Akkadian words were borrowed at the earliest period, when they had not yet lost their ending in \\(ka\\), and before it had been weakened into \\(ga\\). On the other side, certain words which had no ideogram, because they expressed ideas unknown to the Semites, had to be written phonetically in Akkadian, as \\(pa-te-si\\).\n\nThe words borrowed by the Akkadians from their Semitic subjects indicate a more advanced state of civilization, like \\(stm\\) \u2018price,\u2019 \\(ma-na\\) \u2018a mine\u2019 or \u2018measure,\u2019 always written phonetically even in the earliest Akkadian texts, \\(amel\\) \u2018slave,\u2019 etc.\n\nBefore leaving the syllabary, another group of evidence\n\n---\n\n1 See S.B.A. Proceedings, vol. v. p. 20.\n2 The word is always written phonetically even in the inscriptions of Ur-Ba\u0161, and in the lineary inscriptions. It is a thorough Turanian word, representing an idea unknown to the Semites, and for which there was no ideogram in the Semitic hieroglyphic writing. From this word very likely came the eastern Padisha (De Sar\u00e9e, D\u00e9s. en Chald\u00e9e, pl. 8; also pl. 6, No. 4, etc.).\n3 De Sar\u00e9e, pl. 8, inscription of the Ur-Bau, also in the lineary inscriptions in the B.M. 82\u20137\u201314.\n4 I have no doubt of the Semitic origin of this word, which meant a man as a worker. The word in Hebrew and Arabic has, as first vowel, the guttural \\(y\\), which is often represented in Babylonian by a simple vowel. I do not give any more examples, which would require too much space in order to prove by comparison that the words are really Semitic. Akkadists are too prone to admit that words have been borrowed from Akkadian.\nof the priority of the Semites in the knowledge of writing must be pointed out, that is, the very formation of the ideograms. The Akkadians brought with them the 'horse.' If they had invented the writing, they would have had an ideogram for such an important animal. This is not so. They use the Babylonian sign for 'ass,' which denotes a great many large quadrupeds, followed by the sign for 'country.' The horse was therefore in their eyes the animal of the country par excellence. It is written in Babylonian:\n\nThe sign for 'behind' represents the two heels, and designates also the West, that is, the country which the Semites left 'behind' when they arrived first in Mesopotamia.\n\nThis raises the interesting question of the orientation of the temples and other buildings. The orientation plays an important part in all religions. If the Semites had a conception different from that of the Akkadians, they must have had a different orientation, and traces ought to be found in the monuments. In a note published several years ago I pointed out the difference of orientation of the oldest monument of Babylon, that is, the temple of Bel, described by the classics, called by the Babylonians E-sagil, and the ruins of which are still designated by the Arabs under the name of Babil. The monuments in Babylonia are all built so that the corners are all turned to the points of the compass. The only exception is this temple of Bel, the faces of which are opposed to the points of the compass; this is also the orienta-\n\n1 It may be that we have here another example of phonetic determinative, as the group kur-ra gives the Akkadian pronunciation of the word, which was used till a very late date, sometimes without the prefix (S.B.A. Proc. vol. iv. p. 13, l. 8, 11, 16, 19, 20 and 23, and p. 14, etc.).\n\n2 S.B.A. Proceed. vol. v. p. 75. I will repeat here what I said then, for I was, I am afraid, misunderstood. The ancients had primitively no idea of the cardinal points as we understand them. The north, for instance, was not a point to which they could direct from several places their eyes, but a region. In fact two people might have walked towards the north (mor-t-meh in Egyptian) though walking obliquely from one another. The more accurate notion of the Egyptians as to the cardinal regions is due to the position of the valley in which they dwelt spreading from south to north, and the less accurate Babylonian notion on account of the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates spreading from north-west to south-east.\ntion of the Egyptian monuments. Though we must admit a different influence to explain the different orientation, we can hardly admit that of Egypt in a later time, for the temple of E-sagil is always designated by the Babylonians as the oldest temple; round it seems to be gathered the most ancient legends; it is in fact the starting-point from which the growing city developed, as Rome did from the Capitol. It is therefore likely, not to say certain, that this temple was built and orientated according to the Semitic notions before the arrival of the Akkadians. These barbarians, who knew no building but the huts in which they used to dwell, were struck by the height of the temple of Babel, and called it e-sag-il 'house of the high head.' During their long rule the name was adopted by the Semites; but from the traditions reported by the classics, it seems that an older name, 'Temple of Bell,' clung to it in the popular mind.\n\nThe Akkadian and Sumerian supremacy lasted such a long time that we cannot be surprised if the Babylonians had lost even the remembrance of the Semitic period of independence.\n\n1 The name of the citadel of Rome has a similar etymology to the Babylonian temple, e-sag-il. As for the name of Babylon itself, there are many explanations. Some follow the Jews, and take it from Babel 'confusion,' on account of the many languages spoken there; but this fact would prove that it is not primitive, as, if there were people of many languages in the town when it was named Babel, this name is not primitive. Others say that this name is a play on the name Bab-ili 'gate of God,' which is itself a translation of the Akkadian Ka-dingir-ra-ki. At the time of the second Ninevite empire and second Babylonian Semitic empire, we find Ba-bi-ilu, which might be read Bab-ilani 'gate of gods,' and the name phonetically spelt is Ba-bi-ilu, Ba-bi-i-li or Ba-bi-i-lam. Sometimes the double i is not expressed, Ba-bi-ilu, etc. Perhaps on account of the different spellings some argue that the Akkadian name is the translation of a Semitic expression, but only of the sounds, not of the meaning (as we have seen for habesirans); but this does not explain the etymology of Babel. I will venture in adding two more explanations to the several already given. 1. Ba is the primitive Semitic word for 'house' (see Bertin, Origin of the Phoenician Alphabet, p. 12; it has been preserved in \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 'cavity, aperture, gate,' and in the preposition \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2, see Gesenius's Dict.), and the god par excellence of the Semites was Bel 'the lord'; we have therefore Ba-bel 'the house of Bel,' as we have \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 'the house of Istar,' towns often taking for name that of the temple round which they grew (the etymology of ba-d-bet 'the door of Bel,' has been proposed long ago, see Gesenius Dict., sub voce). 2. It may be taken from the verb babalu 'to dispense,' with the idea of 'to benefit'; if applied to the temple, it would be the participle babalu 'the benefactor, the dispensing one.' We have Babilat nukhi as one of the names of the Tigris, on account of his bringing fecundity to the land (W.A.I. ii. 1, 25).\nbefore the Turanian invasion. At the time of the Semitic renaissance the scribes attributed everything to the Akkadians, and regarded them as their masters in every branch of sciences and arts. They borrowed Akkadian words wholesale. All the traditions were carried back and attributed to the Akkadians, the names of the gods, the names of the stars, and even many other thorough Semitic words, were explained by Akkadian. In other cases the Semitic words and names were translated into Akkadian badly Semiticized, and these hybrid forms used in preference to the real Semitic expressions.\u00b9 Akkadian became the language of the learned, as Latin in the Middle Ages. Even at the highest period of the Semitic supremacy Nebuchadnezzar, in his inscriptions, affects to use Akkadian words in their oldest form, and Akkadian expressions found in the texts of the earliest rulers, and as late as the reign of Seleucus we see the scribes using an imitation of the most ancient style of writing.\n\nSomething similar happened in England after the Norman Conquest. The Normans, being in a minority, could only for a time impose their language, and little by little the Anglo-Saxon element came up again to the surface. The Norman rule was, however, long enough to influence deeply the language. At the renaissance of letters the savants of the time, imbued with the classical literature, especially as French had remained the court language, looked for everything to Latin sources, even to explain the etymology of words: 'heir' was written with an h to assimilate it to the Latin heres.\n\nWhat contributed, no doubt, to propagate the false notion of the Akkadian origin of the Babylonian civilization is the transformation through which the Akkadians themselves passed. When they appeared in Babylonia, they were mere barbarians; but, like the Goths in Italy and Spain, and the Franks in Gallia, they adopted the civilization of the con-\n\n\u00b9 The same thing happened in Egypt; but there it was a Semitic invasion of words which threatened the language of the Pharaohs. It became the fashion to Semitize everything; if the word did not exist in the Semitic language, an Egyptian word was disfigured to give it a Semitic appearance (Maspero, Histoire Ancienne, p. 337).\nquered population, with the changes necessary to suit their genius. Their kings encouraged science and literature; their and the Semitic legends and folklore were an inexhaustible mine exploited by the poets and artists; the traditions and religions of the two populations were assimilated or incorporated. It is difficult, if not impossible, for us to separate the two elements, as is the case with the Greek and Latin mythologies, so much mixed by the Roman poets that, with more documents than in the case of the Semitico-Akkadian legends, it requires all the criticism of modern science to extricate one from the other.\n\nThough we do not find bilingual inscriptions before Hammurabi, the Semitic language was not despised and excluded. We see the early poets writing works in the Semitic as well as in the Akkadian language, just as happened in England under the Norman kings when the same authors used to write in French as well as in English.\n\nThe Greek authors, who wrote about Assyria and Babylonia, never consulted the learned Babylonian scribes, but seem to have gathered their information from ignorant dragomans; these always gave the popular accounts and traditions, and we may find in these faint echoes of the first period. The Semites came into Mesopotamia, not through the Syrian Desert, but probably through the ordinary way of Northern Syria, the road of commerce at later times. They peopled, naturally, Assyria first, and after extended southward in the fertile regions of Babylonia; so it was related that Ninus founded Nineveh before the existence of Babylon. When the Semites had arrived at a certain degree of civilization, the barbarians, attracted by the wealth of this country, invaded it, and overran all Western Asia, from the Mediterranean Sea to the 'Mountains of the East.'\n\n1 An unpublished fragment of a tablet in the British Museum gives a portion of a list of classic authors, with the names of their works; these show that the same authors have written poems or relations in Akkadian and also in Semitic Babylonian. Prof. Sayce has, in the preface of the second edition of G. Smith's Chaldean Genesis, given a translation of the greatest part of this fragment.\n\n2 This name is the one given by the Babylonians to that mountain chain extending from Armenia to the east side of the Persian Gulf. It seems to mark the limit which the Semitic element never passed to settle in a permanent way.\nThese barbarians were called by the classics under the convenient name of Scythians, but they called themselves Uri 'the strong ones,' translated by the Semites by Akkad.\\(^1\\) Coming from the north, as their object was at first plunder, they crowded the Southern Mesopotamia. In the popular account Ninus was placed after the Scythian rule, because it represented the Semitic element. Justin says that Ninus was the first who shook off the yoke of the Scythians, these having ruled for fifteen centuries.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the Cuneiform inscriptions we find a legend which might be brought back to the same source. This is the one of Sargon. As very acutely shown by Mr. Pinches, there appears to have been a legend in Babylonia about an ancient king named Sargon, who would reappear and raise again the power of the country, as the legend of Arthur in England.\\(^3\\) Now, though we have Akkadianized forms of the name of Sargon, it has all the appearance of a Semitic name. The historic King Sargon of Agane\\(^4\\) or Agade was a Semite, so was Sargon of Nineveh. Most probably the first or legendary Sargon was a Semitic king of the Pre-Akkadian period, or of the forgotten period of the Semitic resistance to the Akkadian invasion, who was deified, and whose return was expected as the signal of a Semitic restoration. The second Sargon who reigned at Agade was perhaps considered\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A syllabary (W.A.I. ii. 70) gives for the ideogram of Akkad, \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97}\\), that is, \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\) gur thrice repeated, of the Akkadian reading uri the Assyrian is lost, but an unpublished fragment in the B.M. gives the Assyrian Akkad; gur is the oldest form of ur 'strong'; so 'gur-gur' twice repeated represents the plural. Gesenius, it is to be noticed, had hit on the right explanation of the word Akkad, which is Semitic. Smith seems to have been of this opinion, for he transcribed the group by ur in the Akkadian line and Akkad in the Semitic (S.B.A. Trans. vol. lii. p. 336). The national name of these people is therefore Urians, but I preserve the usual name of Akkadians in respect for Sir H. Rawlinson, who was the first to detect (in 1852) the existence of the non-Semitic language of the syllabaries, and therefore of the non-Semitic population, and gave to this language the name of Akkadian (see Hicks's paper in the Royal Irish Ac. Transactions).\n\n\\(^2\\) Justin i. 1.\n\n\\(^3\\) S.B.A. Proc. vol. vii. p. 71. This idea of a kind of Messianic political prince is met with in a great many countries.

Sargon never calls himself king of \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97}\\) Akkad, but always of \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\) \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\) \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\) \\(\\text{\ud808\udc97}\\). It is not proved that these two names designate the same town; the presumption is the reverse.\nas the promised champion of the Semitic population; all his inscriptions are written in Semitic Babylonian, and in later times he was called the king *par excellence*. His reign is the turning-point in the dual civilization of Babylonia, and marks the beginning of the period in which the Semitic element regains power.\\(^1\\) For these reasons we may consider the inscriptions of Sargon of Agade as giving a fair idea of the system of writing of the Pre-Akkadian Semites: use of numerous ideograms with phonetic complements.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe Babylonian royal canon gives us also evidences of the priority of the Semites, if we analyze the meaning of the names. Though we do not possess this canon, but only one fragment published by G. Smith,\\(^3\\) it can be partly restored by means of the indications of Berosus, and the two lists published by Mr. Pinches.\\(^4\\)\n\nThis royal canon, the fragment of which was published by G. Smith, gave, it appears, the dates of the kings from the earliest period. We cannot unfortunately restore these dates, but we can at least reconstruct the great lines of the Babylonian history as written down by the Babylonians themselves. It can be divided provisionally into four long periods. The first or pre-diluvian period is known to us principally by the fragments of Berosus; the names of the ten kings which compose the dynasty have been shamefully mutilated, but a few of them have been preserved in the Cuneiform documents: these leave no doubt as to their Semitic origin.\n\nThe hero of the Flood is called by Berosus, according to his Greek copyists, Sisithros or Xisythros. This name is, as pointed out by G. Smith,\\(^5\\) found in the Flood-story of the Cuneiform inscriptions under the form of \\(\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\\).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The king Sargon seems to have extended his rule over the whole of Western Asia, from Elam to Syria, and all the neighbouring countries were paying tribute to him; he built at or near Babylon a town or citadel called *Dur-Sargani*.\n\n\\(^2\\) The texts of Sargon are principally known by Ninevite copies; in these the syntactic order is the same as in later times, being affected already by the Akkadian influence. The greatest part that has come down to us is astrological, for astrology was an especially Semitic science.\n\n\\(^3\\) S.B.A. Trans. vol. iii. p. 357.\n\n\\(^4\\) S.B.A. Proc. vol. iii. p. 37, and vol. vi. p. 193.\n\n\\(^5\\) S.B.A. Trans. vol. v. p. 532.\nat-ra-ha-sis 'come back wise one,' but the two elements of the name have been transposed either by Berosus himself to conform the name to the Assyrian grammar, which put the verb at the end, or by the Greek copyists for reasons unknown. But Berosus, or his Greek copyists, have made another mistake. Atra-hasis is not the Babylonian Noah, but a god who acts as messenger of Ea to him; at any rate his name is undoubtedly Semitic. The name of the hero of the flood is written in the Babylonian document two ideograms with phonetic complement; that is what we should expect for a pre-Akkadian Semitic name; it is read by Dr. Delitzsch Pir-napistim, 'the offspring of life,' and more correctly by Mr. Pinches Um-napistim 'day of life.' With either reading we have again a thorough Semitic name. Berosus gives Ardatis for father to the Babylonian Noah, who is the of the Deluge tablet; this name is composed of the ideogram for 'servant' ardu in Assyrian, and the name of the god Tutu. The repetition of the three dentals has been avoided by Berosus or his copyists, as pointed out also by Smith. The real name was Ardu-Tutu.\n\n1 Atra is the imperative of ataru 'to come back,' a well-known Assyrian word. The form atra-hasis is the primitive form, no doubt with the verb at the beginning; hasis-atra would be the form adopted after the Semites had, under the Akkadian influence, changed the order of their syntax (see next note).\n\n2 In the Babylonian Flood-story the tale runs in the first person. Um-napistim relating to Gisdubar how he was preserved from the general destruction, in Column IV. Atra-hasis is introduced (l. 22) as messenger of Ea, and pronounces the blessing of Ea (l. 27-29). Then Um-napistim speaks again in the first person, having merely repeated the words of Atra-hasis. If Smith has assimilated this god to Um-napistim, it is an oversight, or through the desire to find in the Babylonian document an equivalent of Berosus' hero; but there is no evidence for the assimilation of the two names. Mr. Pinches points out to me that in an unpublished bilingual text the ideogram is given as that of the name at-ra-ha-sis, is hasis and atra; so that in the ideogram of the name we have the form adopted by Berosus. This important passage shows also that this name cannot be the same as , as the same name could hardly have two ideogrammatic ways of being written.\n\n3 Philological Society, Presidential Address, for 1882, p. 80, note.\n\n4 S.B.A. Trans. vol. v. p. 532. The ideogram is read umbara in Akkadian, and it has been suggested that the Akkadian reading of the name Umbara-Tutu was the name transcribed by ortaprn (a variant of Ardatis in Berosus' fragments); but we have then to suppose a mistake of transcription or restitute ortaprn; but even with this correction it is difficult to explain the loss of the m of umbara; ortaprn is more probably mistranscription for apbarrn.\nIt would be dangerous to try to explain the names known to us only by the Greek copyists of Berosus when we know how names are often mutilated by them. However, Daonos, the sixth antediluvian king, is no doubt *dainu* 'the judge' in Assyrian.\n\nOf the second period we know only a few names given in the oldest list of the British Museum, and from the remark of the scribe its chronology seems to have been uncertain. The names preserved are some Semitic, some Akkadian; it is probably the period of establishment of the Akkadian invaders; the old Sargon is in this period.\n\nThe third period is subdivided into three epochs: the first contains almost exclusively Kassite names; the second epoch contains three series of names, Sumerian, then Akkadian and Sumerian again; the third epoch gives a new line of Kassite kings. This is the period of the Akkadian and Sumerian supremacy, interrupted twice by a Kassite conquest.\n\nThe succession of the names explains clearly the course of events. The first Kassite dynasty was overthrown by an Akkadian population of Southern Babylonia, called by the Assyrians Sumer, and speaking a dialect less pure than\n\n---\n\n1 The Greek transcriptions of the names known to us show what we may expect: *aparanadios* for *asur-nadin*, *sasoduchinos* for *Samas-sumu-ukin*, etc. Smith's assimilation (S.B.A. Trans. vol. v. p. 353) of *E* which he read *amil-uru-gal* with the fifth king *amegalarios*, comes from an error, this group being an ideogram of the name of a priest or religious officer, not a proper name. The name of the fifth antediluvian king is besides read also *megalaros et metaiaros*. Some names suggest no doubt Assyrian ones, but it is difficult to reconstruct them. In *Euadorchos* or *Euedorachos* we may detect for instance the name of Merodak, as in *Ilovardam* for *Emil-Merodak*; but the whole name escapes us. Sargon of Nineveh gives the name of the first Babylonian king as *a-di-i-D.P.* or 'my covenant (is) of Ur' (the god Ur is the Moon-god), which is also a Semitic name, and in this King *Adi-Ur* we have perhaps the original name of the first king of Berosus *Aopos* for *Aopos*. This name, 'my covenant is of the Moon God,' is very appropriate for the first king, who, according to the legend, was chosen by God to instruct and conduct the Babylonians. The names of Annedotos or Oannes and his successors, *Euuedokos* (Merodak?), *Euenubulos*, etc., seem also to be Semitic.\n\n2 The series of names are, in the tablet, interrupted by several gaps, the ends and beginnings of the columns being lost. In one of them must be placed Sargon of Agade. To this period must also belong the hero Gisdubar (this reading is still uncertain), who slew the foreign tyrant Humbaba. It is probable that the Kassite conquest contributed largely to weaken the Akkadian and Sumerian element, and hastened the return of the Semitic supremacy.\n\n3 This name, as that of Akkad, is Semitic, and means 'guardian' (there are a great many places called so in the Bible); it answers to the old word 'march' in\nAkkadian proper. After this first Sumerian dynasty came an Akkadian restoration,\u00b9 that is, return of the northern supremacy, of that population which had preserved the purer language; then the Sumerians, or the Southern population came to power again till the second Kassite conquest. We might find in this succession of rules the explanation of another classical legend. The Akkadians were in time assimilated to the inhabitants of Northern Babylonia, no doubt because the purer dialect was maintained there longer; for this reason, the informers of the Greeks represented allegorically the people of Akkad (confusing the Akkadian and English, and designated the borderland, and especially that on the south. The name of \u0634\u0645\u0631 (shomer) is still applied to the north-western portion of Arabia bordering on what was Babylonia. The compound ideogram which represents this word is \u0634\u0645\u0631 - \u0634\u0645\u0631 - \u0634\u0645\u0631 - \u0634\u0645\u0631; but we have no syllabary giving its pronunciation. This group may be, after all, a compound ideogram to express the idea of the population of the marshy country at the mouth of the Euphrates and Tigris. \u0634\u0645\u0631 is 'place,' \u0634\u0645\u0631 'lord,' sometimes replaced by \u0634\u0645\u0631, same ideographic meaning, and \u0634\u0645\u0631 'reed.' Sumer would therefore be the 'place' or 'land of the lord of the reed.' It would be, in fact, the 'lowland,' in opposition to Akkad, 'the highland,' though the primitive meaning of the latter is 'strong.' The pronunciation of the group ki-en-gi may, however, be very different from that of the characters, as sir-gul-la is pronounced laga\u0161.\n\n\u00b9 This proves the co-existence of the two populations and dialects. The vocabulary gives us also many proofs. The Akkadian texts have til, the dialectic form, instead of tin (change of n into l), which must have been borrowed from the southern population (Pinches, Academy, 1882, July 22). The name of the Tigris gives us another striking example. It is written by means of two compound ideograms, \u0634\u0645\u0631 and \u0634\u0645\u0631; the first is read idi 'river,' and is well known; together they are read idigna (W.A.I. iii. 70, 46) or idignu (ibid. v. 22, 30) in Akkadian, and i-di-ik-lat (ibid. iv. 12, 7) in Assyrian, reading proved by the Hebrew Hidekel, Aram. diglat, Syr. deglat; it shows the reading of the second compound to be in Akkadian gana, and if we found gala as the form from which the Semitic name is borrowed, it is that the Sumerian or dialectic influence has changed n into l, but not yet g into d. The full dialectic form is given as dalla (ibid. iii. 70, 47), and translated \u0161upu (also in a text iv. 5, 61\u201362), the Shaphel of apu (cf. \u0161up) 'to shine,' 'to be light,' and consequently 'to make shine,' or 'to cause to be light,' that is, 'to pour forth light.' The Tigris is therefore 'the river shining or bright.' This explanation has escaped Dr. Delitzsch, because he has not taken into account the meaning of the second compound ideogram as such (Wo lag das Paradise, p. 170\u2013172); but he is right when he says that the explanation given by the classics (Pliny vi. 127, Quintus Curtius iv. 9, 16, and Strabo x. 14, 8) is a folk-etymology of the Persian period. The l of diglat, being under the Aryan influence changed into r, we have the old Persian tigr\u0101 (Zend teg\u0113r, Pely. tegera), a name used for the river at the time when the classics came in contact with the people of Mesopotamia. The form di-ik-lat, given in the inscription of Darius (W.A.I. iii. 39, 35), is the Aramaean form from which the Persians derived the name tigr\u0101. The final t mark of the feminine, which was added to the Akkadian primitive name, is of course neglected.\nSemitic invasions in one) as Ninus, the supposed builder of Nineveh; going further, they represented the people of Sumer by his wife and successor, the supposed builder of Babylon. When they were asked for the name of this queen, they wrote in Aramaean sumer and pronounced sumer. The Greeks from this seemingly double word composed the name Semiramis, being the word pronounced with its inverted spelling at the end, a single r serving for both.\u00b9\n\nThe fourth period of the Royal canon may be called historical; it extends from B.C. 2232 to the Persian conquest, and contains nine dynasties. This is the Semitic period.\u00b2 The way had been prepared by many wars, foreign and civil. We know that the Elamite Nanhunti towards the end of the last period (B.C. 2280 circa) took and plundered Babylon. During the long struggle against the Kassite sway, the Akkadians and Sumerians had been considered as the champions of Babylonian independence, with this difference: the Akkadians were the instructors and teachers of all, and their dialect was taken as the classic tongue; the Sumerians, who had twice broken the Kassite power, were considered as politically superior, and for this reason the early kings put Sumer first.\u00b3 Under Hammurabi, the sixth king of the first dynasty, Akkadian is the official language; but the translation in Semitic Babylonian is given by the side of it, and many of the private contracts are entirely written in the Semitic dialect.\n\nI cannot here refrain from noticing the folly of a certain school of Semitic scholars, who, through a rather too exclusive enthusiasm, will not admit the possibility of the Babylonian Semites having received their civilization from\n\n\u00b9 It may be argued that the explanation is too ingenious to be true; but all the other explanations brought forward till now have failed to satisfy all the points. Some have assimilated the legendary queen to Istar, without much ground; others to Hammurabi with only a faint similarity of sound; others to Sammuramat, the wife of Rimam-Nirari, King of Nineveh; but this queen never ruled at Babylon, much less built it. This name, besides, does not correspond to that of the classics; it would have become in Greek either Samoramitis, the Greek adding always the termination to the foreign name, as in Belitis from Beltu, or Amormitis, the Greek dropping the initial s, as Arkesanos for Sargon.\n\n\u00b2 A strong Kassite party maintained itself still for a long time in Babylonia, and they gave a long dynasty. The Kassite power seems to have been entirely broken down only by the Ninevites.\n\n\u00b3 They call themselves 'King of Sumer and Akkad.'\na Turanian population, and had therefore to suppose Akkadian, Sumerian, Kassite, etc., to be as many secret systems of writing.\\(^1\\) If they had only waited without preconceived ideas the progress of science, they would have found that the Babylonian Semites were in possession, before the Akkadian invasion, of the art of writing and the first elements of civilization.\n\n**Conclusion.**\n\nAt a very remote date, impossible now to determine even approximately, a numerous tribe of Semites, having left their first home in passing through Northern Syria, took what became in later times the route of commerce, and invaded Assyria, and from there advanced into the fertile region of Mesopotamia and Southern Babylonia, where they met, according to some, a negroid population, which was absorbed or exterminated. These Semites had already the fully developed grammar peculiar to their race; they brought with them into their new country the first elements of civilization, and most probably the art of writing, in its Pre-Cuneiform hieroglyphic stage,\\(^2\\) their religion, their legends and traditions, and a faint remembrance of their first home. Once in Babylonia, they developed from these materials, according to the new conditions imposed by the country, a peculiar civilization. The most important science was augury from the atmospheric phenomena, principally the appearance of the stars. The art of building took a special character; through the absence of wood and stone, the architects having to use exclusively bricks. Agriculture flourished, the husbandman making use of irrigating canals, and commerce took a great extension.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The ludicrous notion of kings having their own praises and mementos written on their monuments in a secret writing, which their own subjects could not read, ought to have stamped out this theory at the outset. It must be said, to the credit of British common sense, that it never had one partizan in England.\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps we have, in the carved stones found at Hamath and other places of Syria, the remnants of this hieroglyphic stage. In this case the Cuneiform signs would have their prototypes in this hieroglyphic writing, and might give us the key to it.\nAs for their political institutions, they were probably what we see them in Syria till the time of David. The population was divided into small tribes, having each its king or chief. A Turanian tribe, the Uri or Akkadians, inhabiting the North-Eastern frontier, attracted by the wealth of Babylonia, made a sudden irruption, and easily overran the whole of the country, ill-organized for resistance; but they soon adopted the civilization of the conquered race, and, after a reform, adapted the system of writing to their own language. The Akkadian kings encouraged the literary spirit of their subjects; the two races were little by little intimately united their religions, their traditions, and their legends were assimilated or fused in one another. During this period of fusion the languages of the two races exercised a strong influence on one another, to the extent of bringing two opposed syntactical orders to one common one. A Kassite invasion, and a long period of foreign kings, contributed to cement the union of the two races. The Akkadians were, even by the Semites themselves, considered as the natural masters of the country, as the civilizers, legislators, and teachers of every science and art. A branch of the Akkadian nation, the Sumerians, overthrew the Kassite yoke; but the struggle with the Kassites continued during an Akkadian and a second Sumerian dynasty, and the Kassites succeeded in the end. In this long struggle the Akkado-Sumerian population seem to have been worn out, and the Semitic element reappeared, took the lead, and remained prevalent till the destruction of the Babylonian Empire.\nART. XVIII.\u2014The Arrangement of the Hymns of the Adi Granth. By Frederic Pincott, M.R.A.S.\n\nExactly two years ago it was my good fortune to lay before this Society my discovery of the system on which the hymns of the Rig-Veda were arranged,\u2014a discovery of the highest interest to the student of the Vedas, not only by throwing unexpected light on ancient philosophical theology; but by giving back to the world the Liturgy of the ancient Brahmans,\u2014all knowledge of the true character of which had been lost, even in India itself, for about 3000 years. Again I appear before you in the character of Veda-Vy\u0101sa, in order to lay before you the system on which the hymns of the Adi Granth are arranged.\n\nSpecial difficulties have presented themselves in the present task from the fact that the Adi Granth contains 3384 hymns, or considerably more than three times the bulk of the Rig-Veda; and also from the circumstance that the metrical system followed by the writers of the Granth appears to have been forgotten by the Sikhs themselves. Dr. Trumpp made earnest inquiries into this subject, and he says, \"The Sikhs themselves seem now to have lost all knowledge of the metrical laws of the Granth, for I never met a person who could give me the least clue to them.\"\u00b9 Not only are the metrical laws apparently lost, but the entire system on which the Adi Granth was arranged is also unknown. I need only cite the following words of the learned Dr. Trumpp, whose statement must be accepted as conclusive. After giving a list of the R\u0101gs into which the book is divided, he says, \"The verses of the different Gurus have\n\n\u00b9 Translation of the Adi Granth, Introduction, p. cxxviii.\nbeen distributed into these fore-mentioned R\u00e2gs, apparently without any leading principle, as hardly any verse is internally connected with another. The name of the R\u00e2g is, therefore, a mere superscription, without any reference to its contents. . . . No system or order is, therefore, to be looked for in any of the R\u00e2gs. In the first four R\u00e2gs the most important matter was collected, and they are, therefore, also comparatively of the largest compass; the following minor R\u00e2gs seem to be a second gathering or gleaning, as materials offered themselves, no attention being paid to the contents, but only to the bulky size of the Granth. By thus jumbling together whatever came to hand, without any judicious selection, the Granth has become an exceedingly incoherent and wearisome book.\"\u00b9 This is sufficient to show that Dr. Trumpp had no inkling of the system on which the book was arranged; and if the able translator of the text, who spent many years in its study, considered the Adi Granth to be a mere promiscuous heap of verses, it is safe to conclude that the principles on which the book is arranged are quite unknown.\n\nI shall now proceed to show that the book is arranged on a definite plan from end to end, that it does not consist of two or more \"gatherings or gleanings,\" that each hymn is placed where we find it in accordance with fixed principles; and hence it follows that the latter portion of the book, which Dr. Trumpp did not translate, is just as important as the earlier portion which he did translate. It is not generally known that the Translation we possess gives little more than one-third of the entire book. The Adi-Granth contains 15,575 stanzas, of which Dr. Trumpp has translated 5,719; and of these all but 472 stanzas occur at the beginning of the book, where they were placed, not from any specially interesting characteristics of their own, or because they were a first gleaning, or considered older, or more genuine; but simply because they properly fell into that position according to the principle on which the book was arranged.\n\n\u00b9 Translation of the Adi Granth, Introduction, p. cxx.\nThe *Adi Granth* is divisible into three parts, the first of which is liturgical, the second contains the general body of the hymns, and the third part is supplementary, consisting of heterogeneous matter which could not well be included in the former portions. The Sikhs are fully aware of this distribution of the contents of the *Adi Granth*. They know that the first part contains the *Jap-jt*, or general confession of faith, together with selections from the body of the book to be used at evening-prayer, etc.; the second part is known to consist of different clusters of hymns sung to a variety of R\u00e2gs or tunes; and the last part is named the *Bhog*, probably because it comprises certain panegyrics on the various Gurus. This arrangement it will be seen accords with that of the Rig-Veda; the first Mandala of which is liturgical, followed by various sets of hymns, and ending with the long and short hymns, or miscellaneous collection.\n\nThe liturgical portion of the *Adi Granth* requires no explanation. It begins with the confession of faith, or credo, and ends with the prayers offered before retiring to rest at night. The R\u00e2gs which follow are more complicated in their arrangement. Their order depends on the musical system of India, of which, unfortunately, I have very little knowledge; but I can state sufficient to show that the arrangement is methodical.\n\nThe characteristic peculiarity of Indian music is that it is based on the theory that each musical sound corresponds to some emotion of the human heart. When any particular sound predominates in a tune, that tune is supposed to give rise to a peculiar R\u00e2g, or emotion; hence it follows that there can be as many R\u00e2gs as there are musical notes. The number of R\u00e2gs in Sanskrit treatises, is, however, uncertain; there being generally reckoned six primary R\u00e2gs, each of which has five (sometimes said to be six) assistant R\u00e2gin\u00ees, and eight subordinate R\u00e2gs. This would give a total of 84 or 90 R\u00e2gs and R\u00e2gin\u00ees; but the *Sangita-P\u00e2rij\u00e2ta* illustrates no less than 122 species. In modern Indian music (which was, probably, the only kind of music known to the compilers of the *Granth*) there are about 32 R\u00e2gs, and each is con-\nsidered specially applicable to some season of the year, or some time of the day. With the minuteness of detail which characterizes Indian science, the day is divided into numerous portions, providing accommodation for R\u00e2gs applicable to midnight, early morning, sunrise, etc., etc., down to evening and night again.\n\nNow, the Indians divide the full day into 8 pahars, each of which contains 8 gh\u00e2rts, giving a total of 64 gh\u00e2rts for the entire day. If we allow 2 gh\u00e2rts for every R\u00e2g, we get 32 R\u00e2gs, just the number which modern Indians consider necessary. It happens, however, that the Adi Granth contains 30 or 31 R\u00e2gs; the doubt as to the number arising from the fact that, after the book had been arranged by the Fifth Guru, Arjun, the Ninth Guru, Tegh Bah\u00e2dur, composed four hymns in a peculiar strain, which have been classed as a separate R\u00e2g and inserted, sometimes in the middle of the book, and sometimes at the end. This R\u00e2g is named Jaij\u00e2vanti, and the authorities accessible are evenly divided as to its position, there being four\\(^1\\) which insert it as the 12th R\u00e2g, and four\\(^2\\) which place it at the end. This, taken in connection with the fact that this R\u00e2g was composed long after the Adi Granth was originally arranged, is sufficient to show that it is in the nature of an excrescence. Still it deserves remark that if the day be divided into 32 portions of 2 gh\u00e2rts each, there will be 31 points of division; and the 31 R\u00e2gs which the Adi Granth contains would provide a separate R\u00e2g for each such period of the 24 hours.\n\nIf we consider the 30 R\u00e2gs, which must have been the entire number dealt with by Guru Arjun, we find that they exactly correspond with the 30 semitones of the Indian stabaka, or musical staff, reckoning the minor intervals as single tones. There are nine major tones on the stabaka each divisible into semitones, or 18 half-notes; there are also six natural semitones, and six natural minors; making\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) India Office MSS. 2477, 2483, 2484, and British Museum MS. Or. 2158.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dr. Trumpp; India Office MS. 2868; and British Museum MS. Or. 1125; Addit. 25,680.\na total of 30 tones, each of which might form the basis of a special R\u0101g.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt would seem from the foregoing that, as originally arranged by Guru Arjun, the *Adi Granth* had a collection of poems for every musical semitone of the *stabaka*. There can be no doubt that the basis of arrangement was musical, for directions as to the tunes and the keys in which the poems are to be sung occur throughout. There is scarcely a hymn in the book unaccompanied by musical directions, as will be shown further on when setting forth the arrangement of the individual hymns. Furthermore we know from the biographies of the Gurus that their poems were always sung to an accompaniment of the *rabb\u0101b*.\n\nThe character of each R\u0101g depends upon the use made of some particular note, technically called the *an\u015ba* (\u0905\u0902\u0936), from which two other notes are deduced, called the *gr\u0101ha* (\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939) or inceptive, and the *ny\u0101sa* (\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938) or closing notes. These three notes forcibly remind us of the dominant, subdominant, and tonic, of Europe. The *an\u015ba* exercised a predominating influence over any melody played in the R\u0101g which it governed; for it must be remembered that a R\u0101g is not a tune, but a tune dominated by a particular note. Every tune governed by the same note is in the same R\u0101g; and this explains the fact that poems of various metres are found classed under the same R\u0101g in the *Adi Granth*.\n\nThe order in which the R\u0101gs occur in the *Granth* in all probability depends on musical laws at present unknown; but there are verses in the book itself which prove that the arrangement is methodical. In the very first V\u0101r, at the end of the First Book, Guru Amar-D\u0101s says, \u0928\u093e\u0917\u0947 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093f \u092e\u093f\u0920\u094b \u0924\u093e\u092e \u0930\u093e\u0917\u0903 \u0930\u093e\u0917\u0903 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0930\u093f \u0930\u093e\u0917\u0903 \u0939\u0948, \u201cAmong R\u0101gs, the Sir\u012b R\u0101g is chief.\u201d This was written before the book was compiled, and it satisfactorily accounts for the leading position accorded to the Sir\u012b R\u0101g. The last poem in the book also repeats the assertion that the Sir\u012b R\u0101g is the first\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In this calculation I omit the *\u015brutis*, or quarter-notes, and thirds of notes, as being too minute to serve as bases for separate R\u0101gs. They would yield a total of 68 intervals.\nof the R\u00e2gs. It is followed by the R\u00e2g called M\u00e2jh, or Middle; and then comes the Gau\u1e5b\u00ee, or R\u00e2g peculiar to the evening. The first three R\u00e2gs may then represent morning, mid-day, and evening. Towards the end of the Granth a similar indication of method is observable; for the R\u00e2gs Bhairau, Basantu, S\u00e2rang, and Mal\u00e2r, follow each other in succession; and these R\u00e2gs are held to be respectively appropriate to Autumn, Spring, Summer, and the Rains.\n\nThe reason for the order in which the R\u00e2gs are found is not so apparent as that which regulates the order of the hymns themselves. Here, happily, we are on solid ground; and whatever may be thought of the foregoing speculations on the R\u00e2gs, there can be no doubt about the principles on which the poems themselves are classified. The hymns which are to be sung in a particular R\u00e2g were first placed together; and were then arranged under the following heads:\n\n1. Chaupad\u00e2s, containing an average of four verses each.\n2. Astpad\u00e2s, containing an average of eight verses each.\n3. Special long poems.\n4. Chhants, consisting of 6-line verses.\n5. Special short poems.\n6. V\u00e2rs, consisting of two or more Sloks, and a Paur\u00ee, or concluding stanza.\n7. Poems of the Bhagats, or Saints.\n\nThere is absolutely no deviation from this clearly-defined principle, as will be seen by the following analysis of the R\u00e2gs. All the R\u00e2gs do not contain the whole of these kinds of versification; but, whether short or long, whatever they do contain, is invariably arranged on this system.\n\nUnder the foregoing seven heads the poems are yet further classified according to their authorship; the poems of the Gurus being placed first in chronological sequence, followed by those of the Bhagats, according to a tolerably well-defined order of precedence, in which all the Hind\u00fb writers come before the Muhammadan faq\u00eer Shekh Farid; who is only followed by the solitary female composer Mir\u00ee B\u00e2\u00ee.\nARRANGEMENT OF THE ADI GRANTH.\n\nThe following is a list of the authors comprised in the R\u00e2gs, in their order of precedence:\u2014\n\n1. The First Guru.\n2. The Second Guru.\n3. The Third Guru.\n4. The Fourth Guru.\n5. The Fifth Guru.\n6. The Ninth Guru.\n7. The Tenth Guru.\n\nThe Bhagats\u2014\n8. Kabir.\n9. N\u00e2mdev.\n10.

Surd\u00e2s.\n20. Pip\u00e2.\n21. Shekh Far\u00eed.\n22. Mir\u00ee B\u00e2t.\n\nThe general Table of the contents of the R\u00e2gs which follows shows that, however many or few of these authors are represented in a R\u00e2g, they invariably occur in the foregoing order.\n\nThe hymns having been collected under their appropriate R\u00e2gs, and separated into chaupad\u00e2s, astpad\u00e2s, etc., and under these heads arranged in the order of their respective writers, were yet further classified according to the gharu, or musical clef, in which each hymn was to be sung. According to the Indian method of singing, the accent falls, and the voice rises and falls, in different positions, according to the gharu in which the verses are sung. It is needless to describe this matter further; for my object is simply to show that the hymns are arranged on a definite system; and the foregoing remarks will enable any one to understand the following list of the contents of the entire Adi Granth, which gives the hymns in the order in which they occur in the book itself. This list gives the R\u00e2g, the nature of the hymn, the author, the gharu, the number of the hymns, and the number of verses contained in each cluster. A simple inspection of the list (now that its principle is explained) will show that every part of the Adi Granth is arranged methodically; and the list will also indicate where the compositions of any author can be found in the book. It is of considerable importance\nfor a correct appreciation of the development of any faith to read the statements of its founders in the chronological order of the writers; and this list will enable the student readily to pick out the passages ascribed to any particular author from any part of the *Adi Granth*.\n\n**Table of Contents of the Adi Granth.**\n\n*Liturgical.*\n\n1. *Japu*, by the

the Bhog, or last division of the Adi Granth, contains what are called Sanskrit Slokas, G\u0101th\u0101s or semi-secular songs, Sloks of the Bhagats, Sloks in excess of V\u0101rs, that is to say, Sloks which have not been worked up into V\u0101rs by the addition of Pau\u1e63\u012bs; also S\u0101veya\u012bs or Panegyrics on the various Gurus; ending with a R\u0101g\u0101 M\u0101l\u0101, and a few unclassified fragments. It must be mentioned that the last cluster of 19 Sloks, the Ratan M\u0101l\u0101, and the story of Rai Muk\u0101m, are held to be of doubtful canonical authority, and are not included in all copies of the Adi Granth.\n\nThe following list collects the totals in the foregoing tabular statement; and it shows at a glance the amount which each writer contributed to the book. The Fifth Guru Arjun was the collector and arranger of the Adi Granth; and we see from this list that he actually himself wrote nearly half the book he was engaged on arranging.\n### ARRANGEMENT OF THE ADI GRANTH.\n\n| Author               | No. of Stanzas |\n|----------------------|---------------|\n| Fifth Guru           | 6204          |\n| First Guru           | 2949 (including the Jap-j\u012b) |\n| Third Guru           | 2522          |\n| Fourth Guru          | 1730          |\n| Kab\u012br                | 1146          |\n| N\u0101mdev               | 239           |\n| Ninth Guru           | 196           |\n| Shekh Farid          | 149           |\n| Ravid\u0101s              | 134           |\n| Second Guru          | 57            |\n| Trilochan            | 20            |\n| Beni                 | 19            |\n| Dhann\u0101               | 13            |\n| Rai Balvandi         | 8             |\n| Jaidev               | 7             |\n| Bhikhan              | 5             |\n| Sainu                | 4             |\n| Sadhn\u0101               | 4             |\n| Sird\u0101s               | 4             |\n| Mard\u0101n\u0101              | 3             |\n| Param\u0101nand           | 3             |\n| Mir\u012b B\u0101\u012b             | 3             |\n| Pip\u0101                 | 2             |\n| Tenth Guru           | 1             |\n| Various Bha\u1e6d\u1e6ds       | 122           |\n| Unnamed Bhagat at end of R\u0101g Jaitsarl | 6             |\n| R\u0101g M\u0101l\u0101, etc.       | 25            |\n\nTotal stanzas 15,575\n\nThe orderly statement of the contents of the *Adi Granth* given in this paper conclusively proves that the book is arranged on a clearly traceable system, depending, firstly, on the tunes to which the poems were sung; secondly, on the nature or metre of the poems themselves; thirdly, on their authorship; and, fourthly, on the clef or key deemed appropriate to them. It follows, as a corollary, that the positions of the hymns have no reference to their antiquity or dogmatic importance; and, also, that the *Adi Granth* is a single systematic collection, into which the later additions (as those of the Ninth and Tenth Gurus) were inserted in their appropriate places.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nIt is proposed to commence, from the 1st October, a paper under this head, at the conclusion of each number of the Journal. Its object will be:\n\n1. To report the Society's meetings, papers read, and any discussions which may ensue. Such papers as are published in the Journal in extenso will be very briefly summarized.\n\n2. To supply an abstract of the Proceedings of Foreign and Branch Societies on matters within the legitimate province of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n3. To publish letters or notes from correspondents conveying information, making inquiries, or correcting errors.\n\n4. To supply a list of books in all languages on subjects coming within the scope of the Society, reviewing such as appear to merit special notice.\n\n5. To give currency to miscellaneous information which would naturally interest our Members, whether in the form of extracts, notices, or otherwise.\n\nAdvantage is taken of the space provided in the present number by this announcement to enter three communications received during the past quarter. One is from our late President; the second from Mr. Sidney Churchill, at Tehran: the third from our Member and contributor, Dr. Theodore Duka.\n1.

Muir.\n\nThe Secretary, Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n2. The Alchemist.\n\nNote.\u2014Mr. Sidney Churchill has favoured the Society with a note on Mr. Guy Le Strange's translation of the above play, which appeared in the Journal, Vol. XVIII. Part I. for January, 1886. After conveying his assurance that M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja'far Kar\u00e1jedagh\u00ed is living, and has verbally expressed his regret that he is not the inheritor of the fortune attributed to him,\u00b9 he gives the M\u00edrz\u00e1's own account of his relations with the Akh\u00fandz\u00e1deh, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Fath '\u00c1li. He (the M\u00edrz\u00e1) was not fortunate enough to make his (the Akhundz\u00e1deh's) personal acquaintance, but, by correspondence with him, discovered that he was not only a native of Kar\u00e1jed\u00e1gh, but a relation of his own. Mr. Churchill adds:\n\n\"M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja'far is\u2014according to his own statement, and by appearance\u2014about fifty-four years of age. Some years ago he was in the employ of Jel\u00e1l-ud-D\u00edn M\u00edrz\u00e1, author of the Persian history called 'N\u00e1meh Khusrauv\u00e1n.' When the\n\n\u00b9 M. Barbier de Meynard, in his Preface to the \"Trois Com\u00e9dies,\" published in Paris this year, mentions the authority on which he also accepts the account given to Mr. Guy Le Strange.\nhistory was completed and lithographed, copies were presented to different friends of its author. One of these\u2014perhaps only by reputation\u2014was the Akh\u00fandz\u00e1deh. A copy was sent to him, and in return he presented the prince with a copy of his plays, expressing the hope\u2014on the lining paper inside the copy\u2014that it would be found interesting enough to be translated into Persian. For a long time this little book lay unnoticed in a niche, until one day, by some chance, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja\u2019far got hold of it. Charmed with the perusal of it, he determined to put into execution the author\u2019s wish that a Persian version of it should be made. \u2018The Alchemist\u2019 was the first piece he attempted. On its completion, he showed it to the prince, who was so pleased with it that he urged on him the translation of the remaining plays. Eventually the translation was finished, and the whole was lithographed at odd times, as will be noticed by the dates borne by the several pieces. The translator was considerably out of pocket by the whole affair. His patron died, and for some years he wandered about from one post to another, never getting a permanent berth anywhere. For a little over two years he has been entirely without employ, living retired, unknown and unheeded, fretting away the remainder of his life in sorrow at the thought that what he considered a great educational, and, to his countrymen, a universally beneficial work, has been too often rejected and doomed to oblivion by them.\n\n\u201cThe Akh\u00fandz\u00e1deh, in his correspondence with M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja\u2019far thoroughly approved of the translation, and entirely shared the translator\u2019s ideas regarding their purpose of exposing pernicious customs and elevating the vulgar intellect to a higher standard.\n\n\u201cM\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja\u2019far has two hobbies: the one of which is the r\u00f4le that the drama bears as an agent in civilization; the other is to do away with the present system of elementary education, whereby, after a child has been taught his letters, he is made to read the Kor\u00e1n for some years, thereby losing all opportunity of getting at a sound knowledge of his own language. He is convinced that the child should first learn his alphabet, and then read some of the very elementary reading books\nlately published at Tehran, after which he would make it read some of the plays or some other entirely Persian work. This second pet notion of his he has wedded to his only friend and companion, a little girl, left alone in the world with her father, to cheer his waning years.\n\n\"As to the English translation, I would make one remark: it is that the word \u0645\u0646\u0627\u062a man\u00e1t is the Persian name for a rouble.\n\n\"SIDNEY J. A. CHURCHILL.\n\n\"Tehran, March, 1886.\"\n\n3. Note on the Turko-Tatar and Finn-Ugric Controversy.\n\nIn connection with, and as a supplement to his great work on \"The Ethnology and Ethnography of the Turkish Race,\" published by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1855, Professor Arminius Vambery gave a discourse on May 4th, this year, at the annual meeting of that scientific body, which excited great interest. The occasion afforded an opportunity to the opponents of his teaching, of which they readily availed themselves, to protest against his conclusions. It may interest the readers of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal to obtain a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the proceedings at Budapest.\n\nProfessor Vambery maintains that \"all the ancient theories regarding the origin of the Magyar\" nation are based on mistaken assumptions, because the propounders of them seek to connect it with tribes which either never existed at all, or at best played a very subordinate part in the eventful migration of those nations located between the Altai Mountains and the Karpathians. He asserts, moreover, that, instead of obtaining from such studies the light that might have been expected to clear up the dark ages of history, the subject has become more than ever clouded in confusion and uncertainty. To quote his own words, \"It is only at the present moment that the veil has been lifted, thanks to the assistance we have obtained from the study of ethnography, history, geography, and philology. The fatal mistake consists in this, that during\nthe search after the origin of the Hungarian nation it was assumed that the language of the present day was the only true criterion to guide us. Yet we ought to know that the spoken language of a nation passes through greater changes than does its physical character. We cannot indeed sufficiently deplore that, in setting up such an a priori philological argument, the eyes of a certain class of investigators should be closed to all other arguments. Having thus set aside the lessons of anthropology, psychology and ethnology, they have preserved to us the Hungarian ancestors and their deeds, migrations, and fundamental national characteristics, under an entirely false aspect.\"\n\nProfessor Vamb\u00e9ry further declares that his mode of inquiry into this important subject differs in toto from those hitherto pursued. He starts with the proposition that the study of the question should be commenced at a period when the Hungarians first moved from their original home, which was on the slopes of the Altai Mountains. Commencing with those prehistoric times, the mighty wave of the Turco-Tartar migration subdued the Finnish-Ugric elements, which at that time had also their home there, and drove them to the north-east and the north-west. From the period of this important ethnographic revolution, which effected manifold admixtures between Turkish and Ugric elements, Professor Vamb\u00e9ry dates the origin of the \"Magyar\" nation, and, owing to the moral and physical advantages thus acquired, and always observed in cross-breeds, he considers that the Magyar element assumed a more favoured position than that of the sister nations which remained purely Turkish.\n\nSpace will not admit of a full analysis of the Professor's argument. He admits the hypothetical nature of the starting-point or primary origin of the mixed race, but proceeds to the discussion of its development. The Magyar stem, he contends, remained Turkish, while the branches, by the process of engrafting, assumed an Ugric character. This peculiarity should, however, be noticed\u2014that whereas, in other instances, the conquerors identified themselves with the conquered en masse, often losing their own nationality, here the original\nlanguage only (Turkish) was changed under Ugric influence; but the Magyar nation was for centuries preserved in its pure type and characteristic originality.\n\nAt the next meeting of the Academy, on May 24th, M. Hunfalvy severely criticized M. Vamb\u00e9ry's theory. A brief summary of the purport of his criticism will be more appropriate in these pages than a repetition of language which called forth a special protest.\n\nNot a single authority, it is urged, is quoted for deducing the origin of the Hungarian from non-existing tribes, nor is the course of reasoning explained by which such conclusion is reached. As to the assertion that the seed from which the Magyar nation sprung was Turkish, but that it became Ugric through contact with the Ugers, the proposition is stated to be at variance with all philological experience. The Magyar tongue, like the properly so-called Ugric dialect, differs from the Finnish and Turkish by peculiar verbal affixes. Moreover, the verb is the bone and marrow of every language, which cannot be exchanged, altered, or transplanted from one into another. If therefore, it is argued, the seed of the development of Magyar national growth were Turkish also, this last could, under no circumstances, undergo a change\u2014that is to say, the Turkish verb could never have received the peculiar verbal inflection mentioned, being the characteristic of the Magyar tongue. Lastly, M. Hunfalvy points out the relationship which existed between the Magyars and a tribe of the Kazars in the eighth and ninth centuries, warranting the hypothesis that the Turkish words found in Magyar were derived from that source: words, for instance, with a terminal z change the z into r, as \u00f6k\u00fcz T. = \u00f6k\u00f6r Hung.; Tengiz = Tenger; and so on.\nJOURNAL\n\nOF\n\nTHE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nART. XIX.\u2014Ancient Sculptures in China. By R. K. Douglas, M.R.A.S., Professor of Chinese at King's College, London.\n\nHITHERTO China has yielded few sculptured figures which can be regarded as of importance by students of comparative archaeology. More than usual interest therefore attaches to a set of engravings collected in a Chinese work entitled Shih Soh (1806),\u00b9 in which are represented a series of sculptures which stand on the walls of the sacrificial temple of the Wu family in the neighbourhood of the district city of Kia-seang in the province of Shan-tung. These works of art were executed in A.D. 147, at the cost of the two sons of Wu Liang, whose sacrificial temple they were intended permanently to adorn. By a change in the course of the Yellow River, however, the temple was reduced to ruins, and it was not until the reign of K'ien-lung (1736\u20131795) that the sculptured stones were dug up and recovered. Their discoverer, Hwang Yi by name, carefully numbered the stones as they were found, and built the present temple for their reception. The subjects of which they treat differ from all other Chinese sculptured designs that we know of, in that many of the scenes they depict bear a curious similarity to some of those to be met with in the mythologies of Egypt, Babylonia and Greece. Rubbings have, I believe, been taken of them, but not having had an opportunity of comparing a copy with the engravings in the\n\n\u00b9 A copy of this work was, I believe, presented by Dr. Bushell of Peking to the Oriental Congress of Berlin, 1881. The British Museum also possesses a copy.\nShih Soh, I am unable personally to answer for the exact accuracy of the Chinese artist. I have, however, the authority of the Marquis Ts\u00eang, who had visited the Wu temple, for saying that the engravings are truthful reproductions of the originals. In the following notice I propose to refer to some few out of the many scenes depicted, which obviously suggest comparisons with mythological ideas anciently current in countries further westward. The art, it will be at once seen from the accompanying plates, is purely Chinese; but there is much in the attitudes of the figures and of the architectural surroundings to remind us of the sculptured remains of other lands. The sculptures in question are arranged in double tiers round the hall, and though in some instances the scenes immediately above and below each other appear to have some connexion, this is not so in all cases. The series begins with a sculpture (see Plate I.) of three figures, two of which represent a man and a woman with human bodies and heads and with serpents' tails which are intertwined. The male figure holds in his hand a carpenter's square, which he appears to be handing to the female figure, while between these two, hanging in the air by their sleeves, is a boy with two shapeless legs. The Editor's note at the side has reference to the male figure only and reads, \"Fu-hi Ts'ang-tsing was the first to practise royal duties. He drew the (eight) diagrams, and knotted cords in order to govern the people within the seas.\" The female figure is recognized as that of N\u00fc-kwa, who by some historians is said to have been Fuh-hi's sister, and is here represented as his wife, and by others to have been separated from him by many generations. Of the boy the Editor can make nothing.\n\nNow we know that according to Chinese legends both Fuh-hi and N\u00fc-kwa had human bodies and dragons' or serpents' tails; that they instructed men in the rudiments of civilization, the use of letters and the arts of common life; that they taught the people to clothe themselves, to cook food, and established marriage.\n\nThe benefits they thus conferred upon mankind forcibly remind us of those attributed to the Fish God of Babylonia,\nwho rose from the sea every morning and who instructed the people bordering on the Persian Gulf in the arts and sciences. But we are further told in the Chinese legendary history that N\u00fc-kwa had the head of a cow, and this peculiarity leads us beyond Babylonia to the banks of the Nile, where we read of the Goddess Isis, who wore an ox-headed helmet, and who, curiously enough, in combination with the God Osiris and their son Horus, form a triad, many of the features of which could not be more accurately represented than by this sculpture in Shantung. In this well-known triad Osiris and Isis are commonly represented as husband and wife, and sometimes as brother and sister, and Horus, as a boy. Osiris holds in his hand a crook and a whip and he stands on the cubit of truth. Isis, we know, as a punishment for having befriended Typhon in his battle with Horus had her diadem torn off and a helmet made in the shape of an ox\u2019s head substituted for it.\\(^1\\) It will also be observed that in the Chinese sculpture the boy hanging from the sleeves of the two larger figures has two shapeless legs. This detail acquires interest when we find in Plutarch\u2019s account of Egyptian mythology that Horus, also, suffered the consequences of an irregular birth in a weakness in his lower limbs.\n\nPlate No. II. represents an artificially-trained tree, banked up at the base of the stem. On the branches are a number of birds, at which an archer is shooting. Two boys or monkeys are in the act of climbing the tree, while a wicker basket hangs from the lowest branch. In this connection it is curious to find that in the Egyptian orchards\\(^2\\) the trees were trained into particular shapes, that they were surrounded at the base of the stem with a circular ridge of earth; that in the case of vines \u201cgreat care was taken to preserve the clusters from the intrusion of birds; and boys were constantly employed, about the season of the vintage, to frighten them with a sling and the sound of the voice. When the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Wilkinson, new edition, vol. iii. p. 77.\n\n\\(^2\\) Wilkinson, \u201cThe Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians.\u201d New edition, vol. i. p. 275.\ngrapes were gathered, the bunches were carefully put into deep wicker baskets. . . . Monkeys appear to have been trained to assist in gathering the fruit, and the Egyptians represent them in the sculptures handing down figs from the sycamore trees to the gardeners below.\"\u00b9 It is difficult to identify the kind of tree represented in the Chinese sculpture, but in the accompanying illustration (Plate III.) from Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, vol. ii. p. 107, which, together with the succeeding plates from the same source, I am, by the kindness of Mr. Murray, allowed here to reproduce, a number of birds are depicted as resting on lotus flowers, identical in shape with those on the Chinese tree, while at the side a man is hurling a 'throw-stick' at them.\n\nIn Plate IV. is shown an object which strikingly resembles an Egyptian obelisk. It will be remembered that obelisks were built to keep off the evil influence of the air, and were, it is believed, dedicated to the sun.\u00b2 In the Chinese sculpture we have, as will be seen, a being with shapeless legs, similar to that shown in Plate I., in opposition to a figure which may possibly be intended to represent a spirit of evil. The Editor of the Shih Soh describes the subject of this Plate as being in appearance a man cutting a tree. But this, in common with all the other notes supplied by the Editor, is merely a guess, hazarded without any special knowledge, and in complete ignorance of every thing beyond the frontiers of China.\n\nThe 5th Plate to which I would draw attention shows the arch of heaven formed by a double-headed dragon. The same idea we find frequently represented in Egyptian mythology. In the accompanying plate (Plate VI.) from Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, vol. iii. p. 206, the goddess Pe, whose emblem was the firmament, is depicted bending forward with outspread arms overshadowing the earth and encompassing it in imitation of the vault of heaven, reaching from one side of the horizon to the other. Again, in the 17th chapter of\n\n\u00b9 Wilkinson, new edition, vol. i. pp. 380, 381.\n\u00b2 Hatshepsu erected two obelisks of smu metal and dedicated them to Amen-R\u0101. See Records of the Past, vol. xii. p. 135, line 135.\nNaville's Book of the Dead, the vault is formed by a serpent whose head a cat, which is seated within the semicircle, is cutting off with a knife.\n\nPlate VII. represents a triad consisting of a female figure with the head of an animal producing a boy from her mouth, while opposite to her is a figure with a somewhat similar head which, in this case, is surmounted by a serpent. In its right hand this figure holds a weapon, and in its left a sceptre. On the ground by the first figure is a large bird.\n\nIt is impossible not to be reminded by these figures of the goddesses Mut and Bast of Egypt. Mut, as we know, was the mother of all things, and had the peculiarity, according to some authorities, of producing men from her mouth and things from her eyes. In the Egyptian sculptures she is represented as wearing on her head a double crown, placed upon a cap ornamented with the head, body, and wings of a vulture, with which bird she is usually associated in the hieroglyphics.\\(^1\\) In other instances she is given the head of either a lion or a cat, though which it is intended to be is, as Sir G. Wilkinson remarks, frequently difficult to ascertain. Connected with Mut is the goddess Bast, who is graced with a head bearing these same features; on her head she carries a disk and a royal asp. In her hand she holds the usual sceptre of the Egyptian goddesses. In some of the sculptures the disk on the head is omitted, and the asp alone is represented.\n\nIn Plate VIII.\\(^2\\) is shown the goddess Nut pouring water from a tree into a bowl held by a bird with a human head. A somewhat analogous scene is depicted in the Chinese sculptures, in which a man is receiving in a bowl the \"sweet dew,\" which is pouring from the branches of a tree.\n\nPlate IX. forms a companion picture to a sculpture representing a deity being drawn through the clouds in a chariot by three doves, five horses, and three dragons, formed after the pattern of dragons found in the Assyrian sculptures. The chariot is covered by a canopy which is surmounted by\n\n\\(^1\\) Wilkinson, vol. iii. pp. 31, 34.\n\\(^2\\) Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 62.\na dove's head, and the cort\u00e9ge, which is accompanied by winged figures and doves, is met and welcomed by a male figure. In this Plate another chariot, drawn by seven dragons, bears a man in an opposite direction through the clouds into the presence of a winged standard-bearer, who is standing on a dove-headed cloud. It was suggested to me by my friend Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie that these sculptures might possibly bear some relation to the legendary visit of Muh wang (B.C. 1001\u2013946) to Si wang mu, the Royal Mother of the West, and of hers to him. On further investigation I am convinced that this is so, and that while the sculpture referred to represents Si wang mu's cort\u00e9ge, that shown in Plate IX. depicts that of Muh wang. Si wang mu, the Royal Mother of the West, was, according to Chinese legend, \"a fabulous being of the female sex dwelling upon Mount Kw\u00ean lun,\" where, by the border of the Lake of Gems grows \"the peach tree of the genii whose fruit confers the gift of immortality... and from whence she despatches the azure-winged birds or doves who serve (like the doves of Venus) as her attendants and messengers.\" Sometimes she is described as having a human head and a bird's body. The description of this goddess bears a curious resemblance to that of Athor, who was known also as \"Het Heru, or Horus's (the Sun's) mundane habitation,\" and as Mut or Mother, and especially as Mother of young Horus. This goddess, to whom the cow was sacred, was thought to live behind the Western Mountain, of Thebes, and it was into her \"arms that the setting sun as it retired behind the mountain was said to be received.\" The persea tree which, as Sir G. Wilkinson says, \"was often confounded by ancient authors\" with the peach, was sacred to her. Like Si wang mu, also, she is said to have been occasionally \"represented as a bird with a human head.\" We find then that these two goddesses both dwelt on or behind the Western Mountains, the home of the sun;\n\n---\n\n1 Mayer's Chinese Reader's Manual, p. 178.\n2 Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 110.\n3 Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 116.\n4 Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 121.\nthat the same superhuman form is by some authorities ascribed to both of them; that the peach tree was sacred to both; that the attribute of mother is given to both; and that they both employed doves as their attendants and messengers. But to complete the analogy between the myths of Athor and Si wang mu, we should find some reference to the sun sinking into the arms of the Chinese goddess. And this we do in legendary records which have collected round the career of Muh wang (B.C. 1001\u2013946).\n\nIn the history of this prince, which is said to have been found in a tomb of one of the Wei Princes in 281 B.C., we have an account of a journey made by him to Si wang mu, in which so many of the characteristics of the Sun God are introduced that it is impossible not to recognize in him a counterpart of the Greek Ph\u0153bus. We are told that he started on his journey amid rain and snow, that passing over the gold-plated hill he reached the Mountains of the Spring, and eventually arrived at the abode of the Royal Mother of the West. In Plate IX. he is represented as being drawn through the clouds by seven dragon steeds which bear a resemblance both in number and significance of name to the celebrated horses of Ph\u0153bus, as the following list shows:\n\n| Ph\u0153bus's Horses. | Muh wang's steeds. |\n|------------------|--------------------|\n| \u0392\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7 = Thunder. | Yu lun = A wheel passing overhead. |\n| \u1f19\u03c9\u03c2 = Daybreak. | K'\u00fc hwang = Widespreading yellow. |\n| \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03bf\u03c1 = Flashing. | Tao li = Fleet racer. |\n| \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd = Fiery. | Ch'i h ki = Red steed. |\n| \u1f18\u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 = Red producer. | Hwa liu = Effulgent red steed. |\n| \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 = Earth-loving. | Shan taze = Son of the Mountain. |\n| \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 = Fiery. | Luh urh = Green-eared. |\n\nIt is curious also to observe that a winged bull or cow figures among the animals forming part of the cort\u00e9ge.\n\nIn the text of the work above mentioned an eighth steed is added to the seven, which is called Poh i, which may be translated \"Manifested righteousness.\" The legend also\nstates that Muh wang had four jewels which appear to correspond to the four planets anciently known to the Chinese, viz. Mars, Venus, Mercury and Saturn; of these Mars was said to be red in colour, Venus golden, Mercury silver, and Saturn yellow. The colours of the first three are fittingly symbolized by the Suen chu, a Redstone, Hwang Kin kaou 'The richness of yellow gold,' and Chuh yin, 'Bright silver.' But the fourth of Muh wang's jewels is Yuh kwo, 'the perfection of gems,' a name which curiously resembles the title of \"beautiful,\" given to Saturn both by the Egyptians and the Greeks.\n\nMuh wang, we are further told, was, like Apollo, armed with a bow which shot forth darts at men, and was followed by dogs which, as though he were the protector of flocks and herds like the Greek God, were the enemies of beasts of prey.\n\nOn the last day of the Sexagenary cycle Muh wang reached the abode of Si wang mu, who entertained him on the shores of the lake of gems with such delights that he forgot to return homewards until reminded of his duties by the goddess, who sang him the following song:\n\nWhite clouds float across the sky,\nThe mountain peaks appear on high;\nLong and distant is your way,\nWhere the streams through mountains stray:\nImmortal may you ever be,\nAnd oft return to visit me!\n\nAccepting the hint, Muh wang sang in response:\n\nAgain to Eastern land I wend my way,\nTo bend the summer to my general sway;\nWhen men have peaceful and contented grown,\nAgain I'll turn me to your royal throne:\nWhen thrice the year has run its race amain,\nAcross the wilds I'll hither come again.\n\nHe then ascended his chariot and departed.\nART. XX.\u2014The Mosque of Sultan Nasir Mohammed ebn Kalaoun, in the Citadel of Cairo. By Major C. M. Watson, R.E.\n\n(Communicated by H. C. Kay, Esq., M.R.A.S.)\n\nThe mosque of Sultan Nasir ebn Kalaoun, which stands at the centre of Cairo citadel, although one of the most interesting in the city, seems to have received less attention than it deserves. This is probably due to the fact that, for many years past, it has ceased to be used as a mosque, and has been thrown into the background by the great Mosque of Mohamed Ali Pasha, which is visited by at least a thousand persons for every one who takes the trouble to enter the old royal mosque of the citadel.\n\nIt was used for a considerable time as a prison, and during recent years has been a military store-house, where heaps of all kinds of articles were piled up in confusion. High walls of rough rubble masonry had been built in between the pillars, in order to divide the space into compartments suitable for prison or store purposes.\n\nIn consequence of the position I recently held in the Egyptian War Office, I was able to have the whole of the stores, with which the mosque was encumbered, removed to other places, and to take down a number of the partition walls which closed the intervals between the pillars. Capt. William Freeman, of the Royal Sussex Regiment, gave most material assistance by allowing the military prisoners, of whom he was in charge, to work upon the removal of the walls. Sufficient of these have now been pulled down to show the beautiful interior of the mosque to full advantage. Certain of the walls I was afraid to remove, because, before this could be done with safety, it would be necessary to take measures for the security of the pillars and arches, some\nof which are in a dangerous condition. I applied to the Egyptian Committee for the Preservation of Arab Monuments for a grant of funds for this purpose; but they, while fully acknowledging the importance of the work, were obliged to refuse, in consequence of the small amount available for the restoration of ancient buildings.\n\nIt will be seen from the plan of the mosque attached to this paper, that the east and south arcades are now almost completely cleared. In the north and west arcades the partition walls still remain.\n\nI have annexed a set of photographs of this most interesting monument, which give a better idea of its present condition than any written description can do. These photographs, with the exception of two, which were taken by M. Facchinelli, were taken by M. Sebah, of Cairo, at the request of the Committee alluded to above.\n\nThe Mosque was built in the year 1318 A.D. by Sultan Nasir Mohammed, the son of Sultan el Mansoor Kalaoun. Sultan Nasir had an eventful reign, having come to the throne at a very early age, and having been twice dethroned and twice restored. It was during the period after his second restoration that he built the citadel mosque.\n\nFor some reason that is not quite clear, it is sometimes erroneously called the Mosque of Salah ed Din, and almost every Dragoman who professes to exhibit the sights of Cairo to travellers, calls it by this name. Perhaps Salah ed Din may have built a mosque on the same site which was afterwards replaced by that of Nasir.\n\nMakrizi's notes upon the mosque run as follows:\n\n\"This mosque, situated in the citadel of the mountain, was erected by the order of King Nasir Mohamed ibn Kalaoun in the year 718 of the Hegira. He caused a magnificent dome to be placed upon the summit of it. An iron maksourah\\(^1\\) was also constructed; and, at the entrance of the mosque, was a maksourah of iron, in which the Sultan performed the duties of prayer. The mosque was endowed with funds which largely exceeded the\n\n\\(^1\\) A kind of screen.\nexpenses, and it became one of the richest and most magnificent mosques in Egypt.\"\n\nThe mosque stands in the central court of the citadel, and in plan is approximately square, measuring 206 feet from north to south and 186 feet from east to west. In speaking of the direction of the sides of the mosque, it is convenient to consider that the east wall runs north and south, although, of course, as in all Cairo mosques, it really runs more nearly north-west and south-west.\n\nThe principal entrance to the mosque was in the centre of the west wall, but this doorway is now built up. Beside the door is a minaret of a description by no means common, the stones being carved in a very bold zigzag pattern. The summit is covered with green enamelled tiles, beneath which an Arabic inscription encircles the minaret.\n\nThe door is in a deep recess, and over it is a tablet upon which is the following inscription:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u064a\u062f \u0642\u0637\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639 \u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u064a\u0629\n\n\"In the name of God the Merciful, the Gracious. He who ordered the building of this mosque, the Blessed, the Happy, for the sake of God, whose name be exalted, is our Lord and Master, the Sultan and King, the conqueror of the world and faith, Nasir Mohamed, son of our Lord the Sultan Kalaoun Es Saleh, in the months and year of the Hegira of the Prophet seven hundred and eighteen.\"\n\nThis corresponds with the year 1318 A.D.\n\nIn an upper part of the west wall is a row of clerestory windows which goes all round the mosque. These windows were formerly filled with beautiful tracery and stained glass, but only a few fragments now remain.\nThe door which is now used is in the north side of the mosque. Over it is an Arabic inscription, of which the lower half is broken away, but the two lines which remain intact are identical with the two upper lines of the inscription over the west door. At the north-east angle is the second minaret of the mosque. It is of a different pattern to the west minaret, but, like it, the summit is capped with green enamelled tiles.\n\nThe exterior of the east wall of the mosque is much concealed by rubbish, and by some mean buildings which have been erected against it, and the south side is in a similar condition. In the latter wall is a doorway into the mosque, which was probably the Sultan's private entrance. This door is now blocked up with masonry. Close to it are some ancient masonry vaults of great strength, which are well worth investigation. They may have formed part of the outer wall of the original fortress, but it is not at present easy to follow their plan.\n\nAs I have already stated, the only entrance to the mosque now available is that in the north wall. From this a passage leads into the centre court.\n\nThe plan of the mosque is a simple one. An arcade runs round the whole of the interior, having four rows of columns on the east and two upon each of the other sides. The width of the eastern arcade is 64 feet, that of the northern and southern 37 feet, and that of the western 29 feet 6 inches. In the centre of the eastern arcade and over the kibleh, the pillars are replaced by ten monolithic granite columns of very large size. These columns supported the magnificent dome described by Makrizi, which unfortunately has fallen in. The Kibleh, also, which, according to tradition, was specially magnificent, has been removed, and the space which it occupied has been filled in with rubble masonry. The columns of the dome have no bases, and the capitals are very plain. There is no doubt that they, as well as the other pillars of the mosque, were carried off from Memphis, or some other ancient city. Photograph No. 6 gives a good representation of some of the great columns.\nThe dome columns are surmounted by arches made of alternate red and white stones, and above these is an inscription upon a broad wooden band, which runs round the base of the dome. This inscription commences from the south side, and runs as follows:\n\n**South Wall.**\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u0643\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0633\u062c\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0627\n\u0631\u0628\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0641\u0639\u0644\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0639\u0644\u0643\u0645 \u062a\u0641\u0644\u062d\u0648\u0646\n\n**East Wall.**\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645\n\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062e\u0634\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\n**North Wall.**\n\n\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646\u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646 ... \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627\n\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0648\n\n**West Wall.**\n\n\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0642\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0646\n\u062a\u063a\u0645\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0633\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0628\u0639\u0647 ...........\n\n\"In the name of the Most Merciful God.

The square pillars of rubble masonry which have taken their place are modern work.\n\nThe central court of the mosque measures 117 feet 6 inches from north to south, and 76 feet 6 inches from east to west. The ancient hanafieh in the centre has been replaced by a modern one.\n\nAbove the arches which surround the central court are a row of windows similar to those in the exterior walls of the mosque.\n\nOn the interior of the south wall are remains of marble mosaic work, which, when perfect, must have been very beautiful. There are traces of similar work upon the north wall, but the greater part of the mosaic has completely disappeared. Upon the west wall there is no trace of decorative work, although there can be no doubt that large sums were spent upon its embellishment.\n\nThe ceiling of the mosque is specially worthy of notice. Photograph No. 4 gives a good idea of the general design. It was painted in bright colours, with much gilding, and ostrich eggs are fixed in the spaces between the corners of the hexagonal panels. The ceiling is in a bad state of repair, and I fear that, before long, it will have fallen altogether.\n\nIt is to be regretted that no complete history has been written of this mosque, which, during the time of the Memlook Sultans, was one of the most important in Cairo. If local tradition is correct, it began to be neglected soon after the Turkish conquest of Egypt, and successive Governors have gradually absorbed the whole of the revenues of which Makrizi spoke, until, at present, there is not a piastre left which could be used in keeping the mosque in repair.\n\nKnowing the absolute indifference with which Egyptian officials for the most part regard ancient monuments, I hope that the attention of archaeologists may be directed to this\nmosque before it is again applied, as is quite possible, to some secular purpose.\n\nDescription of Photographs of the Mosque of the Sultan Nasir ed Din Mohamed ebn Kalaoun, in the Citadel of Cairo.\n\nNo. 1.

By Professor Georg von der Gabelentz, of the University of Leipzig.\n\nPrepared at the request of, and communicated by, Dr. R. N. Cust, Honorary Secretary, with a Note.\n\n[The writer of this communication is the son of H. C. Von der Gabelentz; and is, like his distinguished father was before him, one of the most remarkable Linguistic Scholars of his time. He treats of a subject which is of the greatest importance, and which has this year been brought prominently to the notice of scholars by the Comparative Grammar of the Melanesian Languages compiled by the Rev. R. H. Codrington of the Melanesian Mission, and published by the Clarendon Press. The Archipelago of Islands, known by the name of Melanesia, from the dark colour of their Negrito inhabitants, as distinguished from the fair Polynesians further to the East, extends in a chain of Islands from the Southern Point of New Guinea to Fiji, and includes in addition to those Islands the Groups known as Solomon, Santa Cruz, Banks, Torres Islands, New Hebrides, Loyalty and New Caledonia. They have been the scene of outrages on the part of the white traders, and vengeful murders on the part of the natives: they are a bone of contention betwixt England and France: their population is wasting away by kidnapping to supply the wants of Planters in Queensland and the Fiji Islands, and by infectious diseases, and spirituous liquors introduced by Europeans. The Bible has been translated into several of the languages (and each of the larger Islands has its own language or even several distinct languages), but it is calculated that in a few years the population will, like that of Tasmania, have totally disappeared, and the languages remain as literary survivals.]\nIn this valuable book\\(^1\\) the work begun and enlarged by my dear father,\\(^2\\) and continued by Dr. A. B. Meyer and myself,\\(^3\\) is taken up on a new plan and on a somewhat broader base. My father's work comprised twenty-three languages in all, while in the book before us the number of languages treated in separate grammars and grammatical sketches amounts to thirty-five, eleven of which are identical with those contained in my father's book. Besides, short grammatical notes are inserted on four other languages of the family. Leaving these aside, forty-seven Melanesian languages may henceforth be counted as more or less known in regard to their grammatical structure. Lifu, twice analyzed in my father's two volumes, has since been made the object of Notes grammaticales sur le langue de Lifu, par A. C., Paris, 1882, 8vo. On Aneityum we have A Dictionary of the Aneityumese Language, etc., also Outlines of Aneityumese Grammar, by J. Inglis, London, 1882, 12mo. On Mota, the author's own Grammatical Sketch, London, 1877, 8vo. While Professor H. Kern of Leiden has recently made Fijian the subject of copious and fertile comparative researches (De Fidjitaal vergeleken met hare Verwanten in Indonesi\u00eb en Polynesi\u00eb, Amsterdam, 1886, 4to.). These works and a Dictionary by the Rev. George Brown, Wesleyan Missionary, of the Duke of York's Island Language, New Britain Group, also a Grammar of the same, printed in thirty copies by hectography, Sydney, 1882, 4to., are the principal exponents of Melanesian linguistic literature that have come to my notice. This is little, indeed, considering the width and weight of the subject, and sincere thanks are due to the learned author for the extensive and painful researches the results of which are now at his fellow-labourers' disposal. The following abstract will furnish an idea of the plan followed.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Melanesian Languages. By R. H. Codrington. 8vo. pp. viii. 572 (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1885).\n\n\\(^2\\) H.

Then the author points out the kinship of the Melanesian languages as well between themselves as with the Malayo-Polynesian family, finally leading up to a new theory on the origin and prospects of these languages, to which I shall refer towards the end of this paper.\n\nThe second section is devoted to comparative lexicology. The nine words in fifty-nine languages collected by Mr. Wallace, and seventy words in forty languages synoptically arranged by the author, are discussed and compared between themselves and with corresponding words in Malay, Malag\u00e1si, Maori, and, here and there, other languages akin, such as Batta, Samos, etc. On p. 60, No. 10, it might be observed that in Maf\u00far K\u00f6r (not Kur) \u2018bone,\u2019 corresponds to Malay tulang.\n\nA short comparative grammar of Melanesian languages in connection with Malay, Malag\u00e1si and Maori, follows, pp. 101\u2013192. Here the principal common facts and forms of the Melanesian branch are set forth and discussed. Without entering into details, I shall content myself with stating that, in the majority of the cases where my views differ from the author\u2019s, this is owing to his general hypothesis already alluded to.\n\nPhonology, pp. 193\u2013219, and numeration, pp. 220\u2013251, are treated in separate sections. In the former, little attempt has been made either to group the languages in respect to phonetic laws, or to gain something like the laws, which form the pride of Indo-Germanic science: laws, I mean to say, which declare peremptorily that this sound in one language must correspond, under the same circumstances, to that in a certain other language. Observations of this nature, indeed, are to be met with interspersed in the grammatical monographs. But even if this were not the case, the defect would be of less importance than might seem. Apparently in those insular languages articulation has been of old, and is partly now, less distinct,\nless firm and fixed, than it is in our Arian family. Otherwise speaking, had the ancestors of those islanders formed an alphabet of their own, containing, as is the case with Devan\u0101gar\u012b, just as many symbols as there were sounds really distinguished in the language, this alphabet would have been far poorer in symbols, and its symbols partly less strict in phonetic value, their pronunciation allowing more variety, than would Devan\u0101gar\u012b. So, indeed, the Bis\u0101ya acknowledged only three vowels and thirteen consonants. This fact of lax articulation explains the irregularities, apparently capricious, occurring to any one who undertakes a lexical comparison of the Malay languages, nor has it been eliminated even by such careful and judicious researches as are contained in Brandes' Bijdragen tot de vergelijkende Klankleer, etc.\n\nThe last part of the book, pp. 253\u2013572, contains grammars and grammatical sketches of thirty-five Melanesian languages, geographically arranged. Of these, Mota alone occupies pages 253 to 310, so that the average space left to each of the other thirty-four does not exceed seven pages and a half. Scanty as this may seem, the grammatical materials brought to the reader's notice are somewhat fuller than would have been possible had the author followed a different plan. The arrangement of the monographs, on the whole, is worthy of approval and agreeing with the nature of the languages in question. Syntax has nowhere been made the object of separate chapters. Examples consisting of complete sentences are to be found in sufficient number only in a part of the sketches, and so are short texts. Reasons independent of his intentions may have prevented the learned author from being so munificent in this point as we should have desired. As it is, let us hope that he will find enough encouragement in his praiseworthy endeavours to publish some day a second volume containing more copious glossaries and as many analyzed or translated texts as possible.\n\nIt would go far even to enumerate the languages more or less made known by the work before us. The Banks' and Torres Islands, not yet accessible to my father's researches,\nare now represented, the former by twelve, the latter by two: so is the Santa Cruz Group, while other groups have been filled up by new members. Of the languages treated by my father, Fiji, Aneityum, Erromanga, Tanna, Mallikolo, Lifu, Uea, Gera of Guadalcanar, Eddystone, Bauro, Mara, Ma-siki, and the three New Caledonian, have been left aside, while for the eleven others the author had such materials at hand as made him wish to see them produced anew.\n\nLet us now, in the author's own words, explain the theory developed in his introductory chapter. \"Suppose,\" he says, \"in the islands adjacent to the Asiatic continent a population of dark-coloured and curly-haired physical character with their own language. Suppose the islands to be settled with this population, originally of one stock, and the gradual settlements of the islands further away to the south-east to be going on by the people of the one stock, their language diverging as time and distance increase. Suppose Asiatic people, lighter in complexion and straight-haired, to have intercourse with the island people nearest to the continent, going over to trade with them, residing on the island coasts, giving rise to a certain number of half-castes. These half-castes, then, in regard to language, would be island-people. They would not follow their foreign fathers' speech, but their mothers' and their fellow-villagers'; but in regard to physical appearance they would be mixed, lighter than their mothers in complexion, with flatter features (if their mothers were Papuans and their fathers like Chinese), and their hair would be straighter. This mixed breed would begin on the coast and increase; it would mix in its turn both with the inland people and with the foreign visitors\u2014relatives on the fathers' side. The result, after a time, would be that in the interior of the island the aboriginal inhabitants would remain physically and in speech what they were, but on the coast and towards the coast there would be a great mixture of various degrees of crossings, some very like the Asiatic visitors, some very little unlike the inland people, but all speaking the island-language,\" etc.\n\nLinguistic reasons, I think, would rather recommend a\ncontrary supposition. Let us break before all with the hypothetic dualism of ascending and descending development, and with the superstition that the former was the general state of agglutinative languages. As to the Malayan family, traces more or less rudimentary of that wonderfully rich and symmetrical grammatical system by which the Philippine languages and their nearer relatives excel, are to be found throughout, and more recently such traces have been pointed out in Fiji and the Polynesian Family by Prof. Kern. The like are met with, more or less fragmentary, throughout the Melanesian Group. Had we not better, under such circumstances, speak of decay on the latter side, and attribute higher primitiveness to those languages which have fully-developed forms where others show lumps and stumps? As to the speciality insisted upon by the author on pp. 27-29, the fact that a part of the substantives requires or allows possessive affixes, while the other part does not, is by no ways confined to the Malay-Polynesian family, but based on logical reasons, and therefore common to very different languages. Relations, familiar or social, members of the body or other parts of things, require logically something or somebody they belong to\u2014a genitive case. A father, an eye, an upper part, are somebody's father, somebody's eye, something's upper part. From this it seems to follow that the distinction made by the Melanesians may hardly be considered as a striking proof of greater originality. While in the Polynesian Languages such possessive affixes are entirely wanting, they are in full vigour in the higher members of the Malayan, and there applicable not only to every substantive noun without exception, but also, as genitivi auctoris, to the (in reality nominal) passive forms of the verbs. Here again the superiority in point of consequent development and the presumption of better conservation is, I think, on the Malayan side.\n\nThere is one fact, however, which impartiality forbids me to pass by in silence. The Negrito languages of the Philippines appear, judging from the scanty specimens in my possession, to enjoy grammatical systems very similar\nin fullness, richness, and in the phonetic means employed, to those of their light-coloured neighbours. Should, then, these be the keepers of the family treasure, the heirs of our author's ancient island-language? I doubt whether any one, though prepossessed in favour of Mr. Codrington's theory, would insist upon such a possibility any longer than the time needed for a superficial examination and comparison of the materials. Everybody would gain the conviction that, in this instance at least, the light-coloured men were the givers and the black men the receivers, for while Tag\u00e1la and its sisters form integrating members in the close and solid chain of their Malayan kinship, the idioms of the Zambales, Mariveles, etc., stand in evident opposition to those of the other black islanders, with which, of course, they are related, but only loosely and by Malayan intermediation. Moreover, which is more probable \\textit{a priori}, that the more highly endowed Malays should have adopted the languages of inferior aborigines, or the contrary? Which, I ask, is more analogous to experience? It is much to be desired that Professor Kern, or a scholar equally well versed in comparative Malay-Polynesian studies, would submit the Melanesian materials, grammatical and lexicological, to investigations similar to those exhibited in the former's \"Fidjitaal.\" Then we might expect to see the observations made above confirmed in more than one point, and many of the words till now looked upon as originally Melanesian, derived from Malayan sources.\n\nBut strong and eager as may seem my criticism of the author's theory, stronger yet is my feeling of gratitude and indebtedness for the eminent merits of his laborious work.\nART. XXII.\u2014Notes on the History of the Banu 'Okayl. By Henry C. Kay, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe following particulars on the origin and early history of the Banu 'Okayl are from Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. p. 312, vol. vi. p. 11, etc. (Bulak Edition).\n\nI may perhaps allow myself to begin by reminding the reader that Eastern writers invariably represent the Ismailian Arabs as the posterity of 'Adnan, descendant of Ismail, and the people of each tribe as the actual children of one or other of the Arab Patriarch's posterity, after each of whom the tribe is usually named. But it is obviously unnecessary, to say the least of it, to regard the genealogies attributed to the tribes as anything more than the real or reputed pedigrees of their chiefs. Indeed it is difficult to suppose that Arab historians themselves can seriously contend for much more. All the Ismailian Arabs, they tell us, are the descendants of 'Adnan, and indeed of his son Ma\u2018add. The latter, when twelve years of age, and when the invasion of Arabia by Bukht Na\u1e63\u1e63ar (Nebuchadnezzar) was about to take place, was conveyed to Harr\u0101n in Mesopotamia. 'Adn\u0101n died shortly after. Ma\u2018add on his return to Arabia, after the death of Bukht Na\u1e63\u1e63ar, found that his father's people had joined the Yamanites. He collected them together and brought them back to the territory of Mecca, and although they are styled his brethren and kindred, we cannot suppose\nit to be seriously urged that they were his brothers, the sons of his father.\\footnote{Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. pp. 241, 298.}\n\nThe tribe of \u2018O\u1e33ayl, descended from Mo\u1e0dar, through Kays \u2018Aylan and Haw\u0101zin, was one of five subdivisions of the Banu Ka\u2018b. They were the Banu \u2018O\u1e33ayl, Har\u012bsh, \u1e32ushayr, Ja\u2018dah, and \u2018Ijl\u0101n ibn \u2018Abdall\u0101h ibn Ka\u2018b. The second, third and fourth of these are said to have become extinct in the early days of Isl\u0101m. The Banu Ka\u2018b are themselves described as sons of Rabi\u2018ah, son of \u2018\u0100mir, son of Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah, and the Banu Rabi\u2018ah were one of four sister-tribes, of which the other three were the Banu Numayr, Suwat and Hilal.\n\nThe homes of the Banu \u2018\u0100mir ibn Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah were at an early date the deserts of Nejd adjoining to Tih\u0101mah, extending thence to the confines of Syria and on the south to the neighbourhood of Ta-if. At a later period they spread into the Syrian deserts, thence to \u2018Ir\u0101k, and the greater portion of the tribe became ere long scattered throughout the countries of Isl\u0101m. Ibn Khald\u016bn states on the authority of Ibn Hazm that the great sept of the Banu \u2018\u0100mir ibn Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah alone equalled in numbers all the other Modarite tribes.\\footnote{In translating that passage, in his Histoire des Berb\u00e8res, de Slane applies it to the \u2018O\u1e33aylis alone. And that no doubt is the natural construction to be placed upon the words as they stand in the original. But I think the meaning intended by the author is as I have stated it in the text, a reading, I may add, which makes the statement somewhat less startling and incredible.\n\nIbn Hazm was the author of a book, Kit\u0101b Jamharat al-Ans\u0101b, mentioned in the Kashf ez Zun\u016bn, and frequently quoted in Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work on the Arab tribes. He was a native of Cordova, and died in A.H. 456. His life is given by Ibn Khallikan (de Slane\u2019s translation, vol. ii. p. 267), and a short notice of him and of his chief writings in Al Makkari\u2019s work on the Arabs of Spain, vol. ii. p. 963 (Bul. ed.), but neither of these writers makes mention of the Kit\u0101b al Jamharah.\n\nThe life of Al Jurj\u0101ni, who died in A.H. 366, is given by Ibn Khallikan, vol. ii. p. 221. I read the word Khulu\u1e6d as the plural of Khal\u012b\u1e6d. See Lane\u2019s Dictionary.}\n\nThe Banu \u2018O\u1e33ayl were divided into many subtribes. Of these were the Banu Muntafik, son of \u2018\u0100mir, son of \u2018O\u1e33ayl, from whom, according to Ibn \u2018Abd al Az\u012bz al Jurj\u0101ni, as quoted by Ibn Khald\u016bn, were derived those Arabs, known in North Africa under the name of Khulu\u1e6d, who in the days of the historian inhabited the country between Marocco and Fez.\\footnote{The life of Al Jurj\u0101ni, who died in A.H. 366, is given by Ibn Khallikan, vol. ii. p. 221. I read the word Khulu\u1e6d as the plural of Khal\u012b\u1e6d. See Lane\u2019s Dictionary.} They lived, together with certain subtribes of\nthe Banu Hilal, in close alliance with the Banu Jusham, a tribe descended, like the Banu \u2018Okayl, from the Banu Haw\u0101zin, and the designation of Jushamites was commonly bestowed upon all.\n\nThe Khulu\u1e6d entered Africa along with the Banu Hil\u0101l, a tribe which was, as already stated, a branch of the Banu \u2018\u0100mir ibn \u0160a\u2018\u1e63a\u2018ah. A portion of the Banu Hil\u0101l had settled in North Africa in the days of the Fatimite Khal\u012bfah al H\u0101kim; but the bulk of the tribe, which, together with the Banu Sulaym, had allied itself with the Carmathians of Bahreyn, was, after the final defeat of the latter by Al \u2018Az\u012bz, settled on the eastern banks of the Nile. There they remained until the days of Al Mustans\u012br, who, by the advice of his Waz\u012br al Yaz\u016br\u012b, and with the object of crushing the rebellion of al Mu\u2018izz ibn Bad\u012bs, poured into North Africa in A.H. 442 (A.D. 1050\u20131) a horde of Arabs, whose progress is likened by the historian to that of a flight of locusts, devouring the substance of every district through which they passed, and spreading ruin and desolation wherever they penetrated.\n\nThey consisted chiefly of the Banu Hil\u0101l, accompanied by their numerous subtribes, and of the Banu Sulaym, already mentioned, a great and powerful tribe, sister to the Banu Haw\u0101zin, from whom both Banu Hil\u0101l and \u2018Okayl traced their descent.\n\nIt was nearly fifty years previous to these events that the insurrection occurred of the Sha\u2018\u012bf al Wal\u012bd ibn Hish\u0101m, better known under his nickname of Abu Rakwa, who claimed descent from the Ommayads, and whose principal adherents were the Banu \u1e32urrah, a subtribe of the Banu Hil\u0101l. Abu Rakwa was captured and put to death at Cairo by al H\u0101kim in A.H. 396.\n\nIn touching upon these events, Ibn Khald\u016bn remarks that the relations of the Shar\u012bf Ibn Hish\u0101m with the Hil\u0101lis, their emigration into Africa, the marriage of the Shar\u012bf with Al J\u0101ziyah, the sister of the Amir Hasan ibn Sarh\u0101n, chief of the Banu Athbaj (one of the subtribes of the Banu Hil\u0101l), were made the foundation of many romantic tales, still widely known in the writer\u2019s time.\nSheikh Hasan al \u2018Attar, a Cairo \u2018\u0100lim of considerable reputation for learning and scholarship, who died about half a century ago, has added to one of the MSS. of Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work a marginal note, which is preserved in the printed edition (vol. vi. p. 18), and in which he identifies these tales with those that form the leading subject of the collection of legends known as the Story of Abu Zeyd, to this day one of the most popular of the romances with which the public story-tellers are in the habit of entertaining their hearers in the streets of Cairo.\n\nThe justice of Sheikh al \u2018Attar\u2019s observation is obvious to any person at all acquainted with these tales. Most of them have of late years been printed at Cairo, and that relating to the emigration of the Banu Hil\u0101l from Nejd into Africa, under the guidance of Abu Zeyd, corresponds in almost every detail with the summary furnished by Ibn Khald\u016bn.\u00b9\n\nThe late Mr. Lane, in his Modern Egyptians, supplies a summary of the story of the birth of Abu Zeyd, and a specimen of the verses with which the romances are abundantly interspersed. In their disregard of metrical regularity, the neglect of terminal inflections, as well as in other characteristics, the verses are in complete accord with Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s critical observations upon them. To his remark that the tales had, in the course of a long period of time, been subjected to numerous alterations and interpolations, it may be added that there has no doubt been a further accession of alterations of a similar kind during the five centuries that have elapsed since he wrote, but it may be regarded as no less certain that the tales, with their curious idealized pictures of Bedouin life, are still at the present day in every essential particular, identical with those handed down from a remote period to the days of Ibn Khald\u016bn, and the latter remarks that any expression of doubt upon their authenticity was apt to be warmly resented by the Banu Hil\u0101l.\n\nThe Banu Muntaf\u012bk, sons of \u2018Okayl, originally occupied the district of Arabia situated between Teyma and Nejd.\n\n\u00b9 Vol. vi. p. 18. See De Slane\u2019s translation in his Histoire des Berb\u00e8res, vol. i. p. 41.\nThence they removed to the marshy country in the neighbourhood of Basrah, known as Al Ba\u1e6d\u0101\u02be-ih, where they were governed by a family of the name of Ma\u02bfr\u016bf. Their neighbours were here the Banu \u2018\u0100mir ibn \u2018Auf, a sister subtribe of the Muntafik, descended like itself from the Banu \u2018\u0100mir sons of \u2018O\u1e33ayl.\n\nA third subtribe, also derived from these Banu \u2018\u0100mir, were the Banu Khaf\u0101jah, who took up their abode in the deserts of \u2018Ir\u0101k. Ibn Khald\u016bn remarks of them that they were noted for their incorrigible turbulence and violence, a statement fully borne out by what we know of their history. In A.H. 452, Toghru\u0142 Beg, with the object probably of obtaining security for their more orderly conduct, appointed their chief to the government of the city of Kufah, an experiment which had been unsuccessfully tried by the Buweyhi princes. As had happened before, the authority of the Khaf\u0101jis over a civilized community could not endure. We find them, in A.H. 485, attacking and looting the caravan of pilgrims near Kufah, after which, making their way into the city, they plundered and massacred the inhabitants. A few years later a sanguinary war took place between them and their kindred tribe the \u2018Ob\u0101dahs, the consequence of a quarrel, which it must be said was carefully promoted by Seyf ed Daulah Sadakah, the wealthy and powerful Asadi chief and prince of \u1e24illah, who openly encouraged one side and secretly aided the other. In a severe fight with troops sent against them from Baghdad in A.H. 556, before which they had retreated into the Syrian desert, their women distinguished themselves by appearing on the field of battle with water for the relief of their countrymen, but also armed with knives, with which they mercilessly slaughtered their wounded enemies. On more than one occasion the Khaf\u0101jis were nearly exterminated. But the tribe was almost as remarkable for its vitality as for its turbulence, and they long continued to inhabit the district bordering upon the Euphrates below Kufah. The Moorish traveller Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah passed through their country in A.H. 727 (A.D. 1327), and speaks of them as brave and powerful, but also as incorrigible\nrobbers, infesting the roads leading to Kufah, and causing ruin both to the city and to its neighbourhood.\n\nI shall have occasion more than once in the course of this paper to speak of the Banu Asad, and of their chiefs of the family of Mazyad, the founders, towards the end of the fourth century of the Hijrah, of a powerful principality on the banks of the Euphrates. The Banu Asad were a Modarite tribe, descended from Khuzaymeh, son of Modrikah, son of Ilyas, the latter brother of \u1e32ays \u2018Ayl\u0101n, ancestor of the \u2018O\u1e33aylis and of the numerous other \u201cKaisy\u201d tribes.\n\nThe Mazyadis, Princes of \u1e24illah, were members of a sub-tribe of the Asadis, known as the Banu N\u0101shirah. The power of the Asadis in Irak was utterly destroyed by the Khalifah Al Mustanjid Billah in A.H. 558, in revenge for the support they had given to the Seljuk Sultan Muhammad, son of Mahm\u016bd. They were attacked with the assistance of Ibn Ma\u2019r\u016bf, chief of the Banu Muntafik, and 4000 of their warriors were slaughtered. A proclamation of outlawry was issued against them. The tribe utterly disappeared from \u2018Ir\u0101\u1e33, and the territories they held in the neighbourhood of the Banu Muntafik were seized by the latter.\n\nThe most celebrated of the Mazyadi princes was Seyf ed Daulah \u1e62adakah, who succeeded to the principality in A.H. 479, and was killed in A.H. 501, in a memorable battle, in which the Asadis and their allies suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sultan Muhammad, son of Malik Shah. \u1e62adakah was the founder of the city of \u1e24illah\u2014\u1e24illat-es-Seyfiyah, or \u1e24illat-al-Masyadiyah, which became the capital of the Mazyadis, and replaced the older town of al Jami\u2018\u0101ni (the two Mosques), on the site of the ancient Babylon.\n\nI have alluded to the treacherous conduct of \u1e62adakah towards the Banu \u2018Ob\u0101dah, a circumstance which nevertheless in no way interfered with his being regarded as one of the most celebrated heroes in Arab story, a theme for the praise both of historians and of poets, and among others of Al \u1e24ar\u012br\u012b in his Ma\u1e33am\u0101t. It must I think in truth be confessed that the claim for magnanimity of character, so freely urged by Arabs on their own behalf, and so generally accorded to them by other races, cannot\nbe said to be confirmed by the study of their history. The Khafajis, on at least one occasion, brought upon themselves severe punishment by an act of treachery committed in open defiance of every rule of honest dealing, if not of hospitality itself. At the battle of Dhu K\u0101r, almost at the dawn of authentic Arab history, the Banu Iyad, one of the Arab allies of the Persians, sent the enemy on the evening of the first Persian defeat, a promise to desert their allies and an inquiry whether they should do so that evening or during the course of the battle which was to be renewed on the following day.\u00b9 When the Carmathians invaded Egypt, their Arab allies, as soon as the fortune of war turned against them, set about attacking and plundering the Carmathian camp; and on the occasion of the second invasion, Hasan ibn al Jarr\u0101\u1e25 the T\u0101-yite, \u201cAmir of the Arabs of Syria,\u201d accepted a bribe 100,000 dinars from the enemy, and deserted his friends on the field of battle. His was the tribe to which the famous H\u0101tim the T\u0101-yite, the paragon and example of Arab generosity, belonged. The record of Ibn al Jarr\u0101\u1e25 and of his grandson Al Mufarraj ibn Daghfal is probably more strictly historical. When Alftakin fled from the field upon which he suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Fatimis, he sought refuge, perishing from thirst, with \u201chis friend\u201d Ibn Daghfal. The latter received him in his tent, and forthwith hurried off to the Fatimite Al \u2018Az\u012bz, to whom he sold his guest for a large sum in gold. These and other similar stories, it may be remarked, are given as dry matters of fact, and as a general rule without a word of comment.\n\nReturning now to the Banu \u2018Okayl, another of their sub-tribes remains to be noticed, namely, the Banu \u2018Ob\u0101dah, already hereinbefore alluded to. To that subtribe belonged Leyla al Akhyaliyah, so named after her ancestor Ka\u2018b son of Ar Rah\u0101l, son of Mu\u2018awiyah, son of \u2018Ob\u0101dah, sur- named Al Akhyal, the freckled. Leyla lived in the days of the Umayyah Khalifah \u2018Abd al Malik, and attained considerable celebrity as a poet. Having towards the end of her life fallen into a state of poverty, she sought and obtained a refuge\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Athir, vol. i. p. 358.\nin the house of Al Hajj\u0101j, one of whose wives on her arrival loaded her with jewels. \u1e32ays ibn Mall\u016bh, surnamed Al Majn\u016bn, the distracted, is said to have belonged to the same branch of the \u2018Okaylis. The loves of Majn\u016bn and Leyla\u2014who must not be confounded with the poetess just mentioned\u2014form a subject widely celebrated throughout Eastern literature. Leyla is said to have belonged to the sister-tribe of Al Harish, son of Ka\u2018b.\n\nIbn Khald\u016bn says that in his days the Banu \u2018Ob\u0101dah inhabited, along with the Banu Muntafik, the country between Kufah, Wasit and Ba\u1e63rah, and he states, on the authority of Ibn Sa\u2018id, that the \u2018Okayli Princes of Mausil and Mesopotamia, whose dynasty endured from about A.H. 380 to the latter end of the following century, belonged to that division of the tribe. According to that same writer a remnant of them still occupied, in the thirteenth century, the district between the river Kh\u0101zir and the Z\u0101b. They were few in numbers, only about one hundred horsemen, but he says they were much respected, and they were in receipt of allowances granted by the Governor of Mausil. They were known under the designation of \u201cArabs of Sharaf ed Daulah.\u201d The \u2018Okayli Prince Sharaf ed Daulah Muslim, son of Kureysh, was killed in action with Sultan Suleyman, son of Kutlumish, near Antioch, in A.H. 478. His dominions included the greater part of Mesopotamia and extended from As-Sindiyyah, in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, to Mausil, and thence to Aleppo in Syria. With his death the more brilliant period of the \u2018Okayli principality came to an end, and its decline, of which the commencement may indeed be traced under his reign, now made rapid progress. Sharaf ed Daulah had married the aunt of Malik Shah, Safiyah, and had by her a son named Ali. On the death of Malik Shah in 485, the Princess became the wife of Sharaf ed Daulah\u2019s brother Ibrahim, who was defeated and killed in the following year.\n\n1 Abu\u2019l Hasan \u2018Aly ibn Sa\u2018id, the traveller and historian, is much quoted by Ibn Khald\u016bn. He was born at Granada in A.H. 610, and died at Tunis about 685 (A.D. 1286). He was a voluminous writer, and his works were held in high estimation, but, excepting in the form of quotations and extracts, to be found chiefly in Al Makkari, Al Maqrizi, and Ibn Khald\u016bn, none of his writings are known to be extant, other than a geographical treatise and a collection of lyrics compiled from the writings of the principal Arab poets down to his time.\n\n2 Ibn al Athir, vol. x. p. 90.\nnear Mau\u1e63il by Tutush, the brother of Malik Shah. Tutush appointed Ali Governor of Mau\u1e63il, but was himself killed in A.H. 488. In A.H. 489 Mau\u1e63il was besieged and taken by Kaww\u0101m ed Daulah Karbu\u1e33a, a powerful Turkish adventurer, formerly one of the nobles of Malik Shah, and whose name will perhaps be remembered by readers of Gibbon. Ali, the last Prince of his race, succeeded in escaping from the city, and obtained protection at Al Hillah from Seyf ed Daulah Sadakah, the refuge, as he was called by his contemporaries, of the unfortunate and of all that were in distress.\n\nBut it is necessary to return to an earlier period in the history of the \u2018Okaylis. At the commencement of the second century of the Hijrah, they and other tribes of the line of \u2018\u0100mir ibn Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah, still occupied their original home in Central Arabia. We find them with the Banu K\u016bshayr and Banu Ja\u2018dah and in alliance with the Banu Numayr, taking part in a savage war with the Banu \u1e24an\u012bfah and a subtribe of the latter, the Banu D\u016bl, which broke out at the time of the Khalifah al Wal\u012bd\u2019s death in A.H. 126 (A.D. 743\u20134). The Banu \u1e24an\u012bfah, who indeed were the aggressors in the original quarrel, were eventually worsted. But the final triumph of their enemies was assured by the appointment of a Governor to Yam\u0101mah, of the tribe of Faz\u0101rah, who, as the historian significantly remarks, was therefore himself a Kaysi, and who crushed the remaining power of the Banu \u1e24an\u012bfah with relentless severity.\n\nThe spirit of boastful defiance with which the Banu \u1e24an\u012bfah resented the treatment to which they were subjected, shows itself in the following lines composed on the occasion by one of their poets:\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0636\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0637 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\n\u0636\u0631\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0647\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0645\n\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u0644\u0642\u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0633 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\n\u0642\u0637\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0631\u0624\u0648\u0633\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0643\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0645\n\nYe have scourged us with whips, but our blows have been Dealt with as slender but sharp cutting swords.\nTo humble us ye have shorn the hair from our heads,\nBut we have severed your heads from your bodies.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Athir, vol. v. p. 228. The tribe of \u1e24an\u012bfah was derived from that\nThe idea contained in the preceding lines bears a curiously close resemblance with the boast uttered many centuries later by the Turkish Grand Vizier to the Venetian ambassador, shortly after the destruction of the Turkish fleet at Lepanto, which had closely followed upon the capture of the island of Cyprus from the Christians: \"You have deprived us of our beards; but our beards will grow again, and we have struck off one of your limbs.\"\n\nAt about the same period as that of their feud with the Banu Hanifah, a branch of the 'Okaylis, was taking part in the civil war in Andalusia. On the appearance of the Pretender 'Abd ar Rahm\u0101n, they deserted, not indeed without provocation, the cause of the Amir Yusuf the Fihrite, and they took part in the re-establishment of the Umayyah Khalifate over the Arabs of Spain.\n\nThe tribes belonging to the great sept of 'Amir ibn \u1e62a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101\u1e25 emigrated from Arabia into Syria during the first years of the 'Abbasi dynasty, and it was in the plains of Bekr, son of Wa-il, and was descended from Rab\u012b\u2018ah, son of Nizar, whilst the 'Okaylis were, as already stated, one of the numerous tribes of the great sept of Kays 'Aylan, son of Modar, son of Nizar. Nizar was son of Ma\u2018add, son of 'Adn\u0101n, the descendant of Ismail.\n\nIly\u0101s and Kays 'Aylan were the two sons of Modar. They and Rab\u012b\u2018ah, brother of the latter, are the fathers of the three great stems into which the Arab posterity of Ismail are mainly divided. The tribe of Kuraysh, to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged, was descended from Ilyas. The main fact of the descent of 'Adn\u0101n from Ismail, the son of Abraham, is held to be beyond all dispute; but there is no authoritative teaching on the particulars of the line, nor even on the number of generations, between Ismail and 'Adn\u0101n. Genealogists are liars, is a traditional saying attributed to the Prophet, and he forbade all critical researches extending further back (see M. de Meynard's translation of Al Mas'udi, vol. iv. pp. 112 and 118).\n\nRespecting Ma\u2018add a tradition is preserved, and is mentioned by Ibn Khald\u016bn, to the effect that when the Prophets Jeremiah and Baruch, under the inspiration of God, commanded Bukht Na\u1e63\u1e63ar to take vengeance upon the Arabe for their iniquities, and for the murder of the Prophet Shu\u2018ayb, son of Mahdam, Ma\u2018add was borne to a place of safety in Mesopotamia by the miraculous being Bur\u0101k, the same that subsequently carried Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem. Ma\u2018add was thus favoured because from his loins was to spring a noble Prophet, the seal of the apostles, a decree which, continues the writer, received its fulfilment. (Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. pp. 30, 107, 237, 299-300.) See also Jeremiah xlix. 28; Isaiah xx. 13 to 17, lx. 7; Judith ii. 23. (Cassius de Perceval, vol. i. p. 180.) Kaydh\u0101r and N\u0101bit were sons of Ismail. They may doubtless be identified with the biblical Kedar and Nebayoth. It is not known with certainty which was the ancestor of 'Adn\u0101n. (Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. p. 298.)\n\nThe Shu\u2018ayb above mentioned, it must be remembered, is not the same as the prophet of the like name, who was sent to the Midianites.\n\n1 See Dozy's Histoire des Mussulmanes d'Espagne.\n2 Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. vi. p. 11.\n'\u012ar\u0101\u1e33 that the 'Okaylis attained a celebrity which entitles them to a not unimportant place in the history of the fifth century of the Hijrah.\n\nIn the civil wars that followed upon the death of the Khalifah Har\u016bn ar Rash\u012bd, Na\u1e63r ibn Sayy\u0101r ibn Shab\u0101th, the 'Okayli, upheld the cause of Al Amin, and continued his opposition to Al Mam\u016bn even after the former's death. From a strongly fortified castle, Kais\u016bm, which Na\u1e63r possessed on the north of Aleppo, he overran the surrounding country. Large numbers of Arab and other adventurers flocked to his standard, and with these reinforcements, he crossed over to the eastern banks of the Euphrates. T\u0101hir, the celebrated general of Al Mam\u016bn, was sent against him in A.H. 199. A sanguinary battle was fought near Kais\u016bm. The 'Okaylis suffered severely, but T\u0101hir was compelled to retreat to Ar Rakkah, on the Euphrates, and to content himself with defending the country in his immediate neighbourhood. Na\u1e63r meanwhile increased in power, and, aided by the contentions that prevailed throughout the empire, he continued for ten years to defy the power of the Khalifah. At length, in A.H. 209, Kais\u016bm was closely invested by an army under the command of 'Abd Allah, son of T\u0101hir. Na\u1e63r surrendered on a promise, confirmed by the Khalifah, of a free pardon for the past and of honourable treatment at Baghdad.\u00b9\n\nWhen struggling against his powerful enemies, Na\u1e63r was urged to strengthen himself by recognizing the authority of one of the pretenders to the Khalifate, either of the family of 'Ali or of Umayyah. He refused, protesting that his sole object was the protection of the Arabs. He resisted the Abass\u012bs, he said, solely because they sacrificed the influence and interests of their own countrymen to those of foreigners. He felt by no means disposed to recognize the supremacy of an Alyite, the pretender to reverence due only to the Creator and dispenser of divine bounty, and as little to submit to any member of a family the fortunes of which were irretrievably gone.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. vi. pp. 274\u20135.\n\u00b2 Vol. vi. p. 216.\nThe shadow of the coming supremacy of the northern races of Asia over the Muhammadan empire was in fact already visible. Both political and military power may thenceforward be said to have gradually departed from the hands of the Arabs, by whom it has never again been recovered. It may be said of the 'Abassi Khalifahs themselves that they soon retained little of Arab nationality but the name and the use of the Arabic language. Al Mam\u016bn was indeed himself the son of a Khorassani mother.\n\nOne of his subjects is said to have besought him, on one occasion, to extend the same favour to the Arabs of Syria as he displayed to the foreigners of Khorassan. \"My good friend,\" answered the Khalifah, \"you ask me more than is reasonable. The immediate result of my allowing the tribes of Kays to alight upon this country was that soon not a dirhem remained in the treasury.\" He here alluded, remarks the historian, to the insurrection of Na\u1e63r ibn Shabath. \"As to the tribes of Yaman,\" continued the Khalifah, \"I neither like them, nor have they any love for me. As for the people of \u1e32ud\u0101'ah, they are eagerly looking for the reappearance of As Sufi\u0101ni with the purpose of supporting him in his pretensions. And as to the tribes of Rabi'ah, they have been rebels to God ever since his Prophet was raised from the seed of Modar, and no two of them can enter into an undertaking but one of the two seeks a pretext of quarrel with the other. Begone, and evil fortune attend you!\"\u00b9\n\n\u1e32ud\u0101'ah is generally regarded as one of the Yamani tribes descended from Himyar. But the question has been much disputed, and, according to some authorities, they were Ismailian Arabs, descended from Ma'add, son of 'Adn\u0101n. The Yamani origin of the tribe is that most generally accepted, and it is said to be confirmed by the authority of the Prophet.\u00b2 It is stated that the mother of \u1e32ud\u0101'ah, the\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Athir, vol. vi. p 305.

The same author adds that the controversy is mentioned in Ibn al Ath\u012br\u2019s (abridgment of the) Kit\u0101b al Ans\u0101b.1 He relates also that a celebrated genealogist, being asked whether the tribes of Nizar (son of Ma\u2018add) or those of Yaman were most numerous, answered that it would depend upon whether the tribe of Kud\u0101\u2018ah were reckoned as belonging to the one or to the other.2\n\nThe Banu Kelb, one of the leading subtribes of the Kud\u0101\u2018ah, were the principal supporters of the pretender As Sufi\u0101ni. He claimed to be a descendant of the Banu Umayya through his father, and of Ali the son-in-law of the Prophet through his mother. He rebelled in A.H. 195, was captured in 198, but contrived to make his escape disguised as a woman. So late as one hundred years after that period a man was arrested in Syria, who claimed to be As Sufi\u0101ni.3\n\nIn the middle of the third century of the Hijrah, we find the city of K\u0131rkis\u012ba (on the Euphrates, at the mouth of the Khabur) in the possession of an \u2018O\u1e33ayli chief, Ibn \u1e62afw\u0101n, who it may be presumed was son of \u1e62afw\u0101n, a member of the same tribe, mentioned by Al Mas\u2018\u016bdi as Prince of Diar Mo\u1e0dar, and who, he states, died in A.H. 253, in the prison of Samarra.4 A dinar struck at K\u0131rkis\u012ba, bearing the name of Muhammad ibn \u1e62afw\u0101n, and the date A.H. 275, is comprised in the collection of the late Mr. Rogers, now the property of the Egyptian Government.\n\nAccording to Ibn al Ath\u012br, whose account is identical with that given by At \u1e6cabar\u012b,5 Ibn \u1e62afw\u0101n was dispossessed of\n\n---\n\n1 This work is mentioned in the Kashf ez Zun\u016bn under the heading \u2018Ilm al Ans\u0101b, and in Ibn Khallikan, vol. ii. p. 280.\n2 See also Al Mas\u2018\u016bdi, vol. iii. p. 215, vol. vi. p. 150.\n3 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. vii. p. 382.\n4 Vol. vi. p. 396.

Lulu, who was Governor of Aleppo, Hims, Kinnisserin and Diar Modar, rebelled against his master, and joined Al Muwaffik, brother and vicegerent of the reigning Khalifah. Lulu delivered Kirgisia to Ahmad son of Malik ibn Tauk, but the latter in Shaww\u0101l of the same year was attacked at Ar Rahabah by Muhammad Ibn Abu\u2019s-Saj, governor of Al Anbar, on the Euphrates, and adjacent districts, and was driven into Syria. In A.H. 273, the jealousy that existed between Ibn Abu\u2019s-Saj and Ishak ibn Kundaj (or Kundajik), Governor of Mau\u0161il, brought about a war between them, in which each successively deserted the cause of the Abassids and recognized the supremacy of Khamaraweyh the Tulunite, receiving in reward assistance against his rival. Ibn Abu\u2019s-Saj was eventually defeated and compelled to seek refuge at Baghdad in A.H. 276, abandoning his dominions, which passed into the hands of Ibn Kundaj. The date of the dinar may perhaps authorize us to infer that Ibn Safwan during the struggle between the two rivals was allowed to regain possession of the city.\n\nAbout the year 286 the \u2018Okaylis and other Arabs of the Kaisy stem recognized the spiritual and temporal authority of Abu Sa'id al Jannabi, the founder of the Carmathian dynasty in Arabia. With their assistance he besieged and conquered Hajar. He soon afterwards added Katif, then the whole of Bahrayn, and ere long he established a power on the shores of the Persian Gulf, which became the terror of the Muhammadan world.\n\nBut the Carmathian dominion, as is well known, was almost as remarkable for the rapidity of its decline as for that of its rise. The dissensions that followed after the death of Al Jannabi, in A.H. 332, increased in violence after the death, in A.H. 366, of his grandson, Abu Ali al Hasan\n\n1 Malik ibn Tauk, of the tribe of Taghlib, was a military commander under Harun ar Rashid, and a lineal descendant of \u2018Amru ibn Kulthum, a celebrated poet and warrior of the Ante-Islamic period and author of one of the seven Mu'allakat. Malik was founder of the city of Rahabah, named after him Rahabat Malik ibn Tauk. He died in A.H. 260.\nibn Ahmad al \u0100\u2019sam, under whose authority the Carmathians renounced their spiritual allegiance to the Ismaillian or Fatimite Khalifahs, and recognized the supremacy of the Abassis. They returned to their former obedience in A.H. 375, but their power had now completely broken down. In A.H. 378 they were attacked, at the instigation of the Abassis, by a Taghlabite chief Abu\u2019l \u1e24asan al Asfar. According to Ibn Khald\u016bn,\u00b9 he possessed himself of their capital Al A\u1e25sa, and the writer adds that Al A\u1e63far and his descendants thenceforward held the Carmathians in a state of complete subjection. That statement is not borne out by the evidence of other historians,\u00b2 nor by that of the traveller Na\u1e63ir Khusruw, who visited Al Ahsa in A.H. 443, and it seems more probable that the dominion of the Taghlabite chiefs did not extend beyond the exaction of tribute.\u00b3\n\nAmong the Arab tribes, or sections of tribes, that occupied the province of Bahrayn and its neighbourhood, the Banu Sulaym and Banu \u2018Okayl were for warlike strength only second to the Taghlibis. After the defeat of the Carmathians, Al A\u1e63far prevailed upon the \u2018Okaylis to combine with him, and with their aid he drove the Banu Sulaym out of the country. They joined the rest of their tribe in Egypt, and thence passed over into Africa as already stated. Al A\u1e63far, having got rid of one of his rivals, now turned against the other. The \u2018Okaylis were in their turn attacked and driven forth. They sought refuge in \u2018Ir\u0101\u1e33, whence they appear to have proceeded to Mesopotamia, and to have joined their brethren, who had ere this laid the foundations of the \u2018Okayli Principality of Ma\u1e63il.\n\nThe tribes of the stem of the Banu \u2018\u0100mir ibn Sa\u02bfsa\u02bfah, as already mentioned, emigrated from Arabia in the early years of the Abassi dynasty, and, as may be inferred from the words of Al Mam\u016bn (see supra, p. 502), it was probably under his reign that they alighted upon the plains of Syria\n\n\u00b9 Vol. iv. p. 91.\n\u00b2 See Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. p. 40.\n\u00b3 See de Goeje, Memoire sur les Carmathes.\nin large numbers. They had, however, been preceded by many other Arab settlers, and, among others, by the tribe of Taghlib. The latter and its sister-tribe the Banu Bekr (supra, p. 499, note) were the two subdivisions of the Banu W\u0101-il, and belonged therefore to the great stem of Rab\u012b\u2018ah, brother of Mo\u1e0dar and son of Niz\u0101r. They settled in that portion of Mesopotamia known as Di\u0101r Rab\u012b\u2018ah, the abode of Rab\u012b\u2018ah, before the advent of Isl\u0101m.\u00b9 They had adopted Christianity, entered into alliances with the Romans, and, along with the Ghass\u0101nis, they fought against the Muslims, when the latter invaded and conquered Syria. The Khalifah Omar imposed upon them the Jisyah, or capitation tax, exacted according to Muhammadan law from Jewish and Christian subjects; but at the entreaties of the Taghlibites, to spare them the humiliation which the term Jisyah inflicted upon them in the eyes of the Arabs, he consented to the tax being levied under the name of double tithes.\u00b2\n\nIn the third century of the Hijrah, an ambitious and powerful chief, \u1e24amd\u0101n ibn \u1e24amd\u016bn, raised himself to eminence among the Banu Taghlib, and laid the foundations of the \u1e24amdani Principality of Ma\u1e63il and Aleppo. During the greater part of the following century, the Hamdanis held a position of acknowledged supremacy over the Arab tribes that had spread themselves on the plains between Mesopotamia and Syria, and on the banks of the Euphrates. The Banu \u1e6cay as well as the \u2018O\u1e33aylis, the Banu Kil\u0101b, the Banu Numayr and the Khaf\u0101jahs, were, in the words of Ibn Khald\u016bn, the subjects of the Hamdanis, paying them tribute and supplying them with military aid.\u00b3 But the rule of the Hamdani Princes, brilliant as it was under the two brothers, N\u0101\u1e63ir ed Daulah al \u1e24usayn and Seyf ed Daulah Ali, the Princes of Ma\u1e63il and of Aleppo, did not long\n\n\u00b9 The district occupied by the Banu Bekr received the name of Di\u0101r Bekr.\n\u00b2 Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. iv. p. 227. It was between the Banu Taghlib and Banu Bekr that a feud arose, the incidents of which are renowned in Arab history, and which is said to have lasted forty years. And it was shortly after its termination, and not long before the appearance of Isl\u0101m, that the Taghlibites removed to Syria and thence to Mesopotamia. See Fresnel, Lettres sur l\u2019histoire des Arabes avant l\u2019Islamisme. Ibn al Athir, vol. i. p. 384 et seq. and p. 397, etc.\n\u00b3 Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. iv. p. 254.\nendure. Seyf ed Daulah died in A.H. 356, and his brother, deposed the same year by his son Abu Taghlib, died two years later. Mau\u015fil was taken in A.H. 367 by \u2018Adad ed Daulah the Buweyhi. Abu Taghlib fled from the city, accompanied by a strong party of his followers, and after various wanderings, arrived in 369 in Syria. Thence he was summoned by the Fatimite Khalifah Al \u2018Aziz to Cairo, an invitation which he hesitated to obey. A considerable body of the \u2018Okayli tribe were at the time encamped on the plains of Southern Syria. They had incurred the suspicions of Ibn Daghfal, chief of the Ta-yites, and applied to Abu Taghlib for his assistance. He encamped in their neighbourhood, whereupon Ibn Daghfal in alarm marched to attack them. The \u2018Okaylis, perceiving the large numbers of the foe, deserted their ally en masse and left him to face the common enemy with his followers alone, numbering in all about 700 men. They were completely defeated, and Abu Taghlib himself taken prisoner. Ibn Daghfal, fearing that Al \u2018Aziz would treat his prisoner with the same clemency he had shown to Alftakin (supra p. 497), put him to death, and his head was sent to Cairo. The sister of Abu Taghlib, Jamilah, and his wife, who was daughter of his uncle Seyf ed Daulah, fell into the hands of the \u2018Okaylis. They sent them to Sa\u2019d ed Daulah, who had succeeded his father in the Principality of Aleppo. He took charge of his own sister, the widow of his cousin, and sent Jamilah to the Buwayhi Governor of Mau\u015fil, by whom she was sent on to Baghdad. The treatment she received at the hands of \u2018Adad ed Daulah was such as would hardly be expected from a far more barbarous ruler. Having undergone about two years\u2019 imprisonment, she was drowned in the Tigris, after being carried through the streets of Baghdad, mounted on a camel, whilst criers proclaimed: \u201cThis is Princess Ugly (Kab\u012bhah), sister of the Discomfited (Abu Maghl\u016bb),\u201d\u2014a brutal play upon her own and her brother\u2019s names, Jamilah (Camilla), Beautiful, and Taghlib, Victor or more literally Vinces.\n\nThe power of the Hamd\u0101ni dynasty fell now into a state of complete decay, and the tribes hitherto under their authority\nrecovered their independence and the power to seek the fulfilment each of its own ambition. The Banu Ta-y established themselves in the district extending from Ramleh to Egypt. \u015e\u0101lih ibn Mird\u0101s, Chief of the Banu Kil\u0101b, took possession of the country between Aleppo and \u2018\u0100nah on the Euphrates. In A.H. 414 he succeeded in possessing himself of Aleppo, where he and his descendants ruled until the dynasty came to an end in A.H. 473, when Sharaf ed Daulah Muslim, son of Kuraysh, the \u2018Okayli, took the city and held it for a short time under the supremacy of Malik Shah.\n\nIn A.H. 379 the Amir of the \u2018Okaylis was Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d Muhammad, son of Al Musayyib, son of R\u0101f\u012b\u2019, son of Al Mu\u1e33allid, son of Ja\u2019fir, son of \u2018Omar, son of Muhanna. The sons of Na\u1e63ir ed Daulah the Hamd\u0101ni, Abu Abd Allah and Abu T\u0101hir, had that year recovered possession of Ma\u1e63il, but, threatened by the neighbouring Kurds, they applied to the \u2018Okayli chief for assistance, which he granted, receiving as his reward the towns of Nasibin, Jaz\u012brat ibn \u2018Omar and Balad.\n\nAided by Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d, the Hamd\u0101nis attacked the Kurdish army, which was defeated and put to flight. The Hamd\u0101nis endeavoured to follow up their success over their enemies, but the latter were in their turn victorious. Abu Abd Allah was taken prisoner. Abu T\u0101hir fled in the direction of Na\u1e63ibin. Here he was attacked by his late ally Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d, who took him prisoner and put him to death. Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d then marched upon Ma\u1e63il, and took possession of the city and of the surrounding country.\n\nHis first act was to recognize the supremacy of the Buwayhi Prince Baha ed Daulah, and at his request an official was sent from Baghdad as Governor of the Province.\n\n---\n\n1 Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. iv. p. 272; Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. p. 162.\n2 Ibn Khallikan in his life of Al Mukallid gives the remainder of the chief\u2019s pedigree as follows, namely, Al Muhanna Abd er Rahman, son of Burayd, son of Abd Allah, son of Zayd, son of Kays, son of J\u016btha, son of Tahfa, son of Hazn, son of \u2018Okayl. Reckoning three generations to a century, we arrive at A.D. 424, as the period of Amir ibn Sa\u02bfsa\u02bfah, the great-grandfather of \u2018Oqail, a fair approximation to M. Caussin de Perceval\u2019s calculations, according to which Amir ibn Sa\u02bfsa\u02bfah was born about A.D. 381. It will be observed that this pedigree does not confirm Ibn Sa\u02bfid\u2019s statement that the Princes of Ma\u1e63il belonged to the \u2018Okayli subtribe of \u2018Ob\u0101dah.\nThe representative of Baha ed Daulah was, however, allowed no more than nominal authority, and all real power was exercised by Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d. An army was consequently sent long despatched by the Buwayhi prince against the \u2018O\u1e33aylis, and it recaptured Mau\u1e63il towards the end of A.H. 381.\n\nAbu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d died in 386, and the \u2018O\u1e33aylis recognized his brother Ali as his successor to the chieftainship, refusing to admit a claim put forward by Al Mukallid, a younger brother. The latter induced his brother to join him in an attack upon Mau\u1e63il. He had contrived to detach a considerable portion of the garrison from their allegiance. The governor fled down the river, anxious only to save his private property, and the two brothers took possession of the city. It was agreed between them that the right of sovereignty should belong to them jointly, with precedence to Ali. The latter returned to his encampment, leaving his brother in possession.\n\nAl Mukallid defeated a force despatched against him from Baghdad, but sent excuses and professions of loyalty to Baha ed Daulah. The latter was sufficiently occupied in defending himself against his brother, \u015eam\u015fam ed Daulah, and found it expedient to grant terms of peace to the ambitious and energetic Arab chief. It was agreed that Al Mukallid should be appointed ruler over Mau\u1e63il, K\u016bfah, Al Kasr, and Jami\u2018\u0101n, that he should be invested with a regal dress of honour, that he should receive the title of Hus\u0101m ed Daulah (the Sword of the Empire), and that he should pay a tribute of 10,000 dinars. It was further stipulated that he should exact from the towns under his control no more than the customary dues lawfully belonging to him as their protector. This last obligation was, according to a remark of the historian, completely neglected.\u00b9\n\nFresh disputes had meanwhile broken out between Al Mukallid and Ali, the latter supported by their brother \u1e24asan. Al Mukallid now resolved to possess himself of the person of his rival. The two brothers were occupying con-\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. p. 89.\ntiguous houses at Mau\u1e63il. Al Mukallid broke through the partition wall, seized his brother Ali, who was indulging in a debauch, and was helpless from the effects of wine, and imprisoned him. He then forthwith sent word to his wife, who was at an encampment he possessed four parasangs from Tekr\u012bt, on the Euphrates, between Mau\u1e63il and Baghdad, desiring her immediately to escape with his two sons, Kirwash and Badr\u0101n, and to seek safety within the walls of the town from the attempts he foresaw would be made against them by their uncle \u1e24asan. The latter, in fact, on hearing of what had occurred at Mau\u1e63il, hastened to the encampment, but arrived too late.\n\nThe two brothers, each supported by a portion of the tribe, now prepared for open war. Their armies advanced to within one stage of one another, and halted near \u2019Alth, on the eastern side of the Tigris. Here Al Mukallid was joined by several of the leading men of the tribe, and among others by his kinsmen the two brothers Abu Dir\u2018a R\u0101fi\u2018 and Abu Sinan Ghar\u012bb, sons of Muhammad, son of Ma\u2019n. Opinions were divided as to the wisdom of having recourse to violence, whereby a civil war must inevitably be kindled in the tribe. Whilst they were disputing, a message was brought to Al Mukallid that his sister Rahilah had come and desired to see him. He immediately mounted and joined her, and through her influence peace was concluded. Friendship was sworn between the brothers. Ali was set at liberty, his property restored to him, and he returned to his tents.\n\nAl Mukallid now set out against Abu\u2019l Hasan Ali ibn Mazyad the Asadi, who during these troubles had espoused the cause of Ali, and had made incursions into Al Mukallid\u2019s territories. But the \u2018O\u1e33ayli chief soon received tidings that Ali, taking advantage of his absence, had marched upon Mau\u1e63il, and had succeeded in obtaining possession of the town. He immediately turned back and his two brothers in alarm made fresh offers of peace which were accepted. Ali died in A.H. 390, and Al Hasan took his place as nominal chief of the tribe, but was attacked and speedily put to flight by Al Mukallid, aided by the Banu Khaf\u0101jah. The\nlatter continued henceforward in undisputed possession of the Principality of Mau\u1e63il and of the chieftainship over the tribe of \u2018Okayl, until he perished in A.H. 391 (A.D. 1001) assassinated by his Turkish mamluks at Al Anb\u0101r. Al Mukallid\u2019s dominions included, at the time of his death, besides Mau\u1e63il, the cities of Ka\u1e63r, K\u016bfah, Al Jam\u012b\u2018\u0101n\u012b, Al Anb\u0101r, Al Mad\u0101-in and Dak\u016bka.\u00b9 He was succeeded by his son Mo\u2018tamad ed Daulah Abu Mani\u2018 Kirwash, whose reign prolonged itself until A.H. 442, when he was deposed by his brother Za\u2018\u012bm ed Daulah Abu K\u0101mil.\n\nA translation into German of Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s history of the \u2018Okayli Principality of Mau\u1e63il was published some years ago by M. Tiesenhausen, which, with the numerous notes added by the learned translator, makes it superfluous for me to attempt entering into a detailed account of the fortunes of the \u2018Okayli dynasty.\n\nBut a branch of the family acquired at the same period a position of influence and dignity, which almost justifies its being numbered among the ruling dynasties of the time.\n\nThe \u2018Okayli Princes of Mau\u1e63il are distinguished by Arab historians as \u0100l Musayyib, the family of Musayyib, grandson, as has been shown, of Al Mukallid. The other great family is known as Banu Ma\u2019n, and were the descendants of Ma\u2019n, son of Al Mukallid, who was consequently the common ancestor of both.\u00b2 The subjoined genealogical table will show more clearly the connection between the two families. It has been compiled from the Chronicles of Ibn al Ath\u012br, with the exception of the descent of Mu\u1e25arish and of the name of Abu\u2019l Murr\u0101kh Mu\u1e63a\u2018ab, son of Al Musayyib,\n\n\u00b9 Ka\u1e63r (castle) is a name borne by a large number of places. Ka\u1e63r \u2018\u012asa, which is probably that referred to in the text, is situated on the Tigris. Al Jam\u012b\u2018\u0101n\u012b, as has already been stated, stood on the banks of the Euphrates, on the site of the ancient Babylon. Al Anb\u0101r also on the Euphrates, ten parasangs west of Baghdad. Al Mad\u0101-in, on the Tigris, was the name given by the Arabs to the ancient cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon, a short distance below Baghdad. Dak\u016bka is situated east of the Tigris, on the road from Baghdad to Irbil.\n\n\u00b2 The name is printed in the Leyden Edition of Ibn al Ath\u012br as Ma\u2019n, and so also in Ibn Khallikan, but elsewhere I find it invariably written Ma\u2019n. There can be little doubt that the latter is the correct spelling, and indeed it occurs thus written in one at least of the MSS. used by Professor Tornberg (see vol. ix. p. 136).\nwhich I have obtained from M. de Slane's translation of the Ibn Khallikan (vol. i. p. 173, and vol. iii. pp. 418 and 423. See also Professor Tiesenhausen's note No. 17).\n\nAbu Abd Allah Muhammad, son of Ma'n, died in A.H. 401 (A.D. 1010), at the age, it is alleged, of 110 years. He is said to have been present with the Carmathians when they removed the Black Stone from the temple of Mecca, an event which occurred in A.H. 317. He is described as a man of extreme avarice.\n\nI have had occasion to mention his two sons, Abu Sinan Gharib and Abu Dir'a' R\u0101fi'. The former, who held, as will presently be seen, the double title of Kam\u012bl ed Daulah and Seyf ed din, appears to have been born about the year 355. He witnessed therefore, and probably took an active part in, the rise of the 'Okayli power under Abu'dh Dhaww\u0101d; but we first hear of him in A.H. 387, when, as before mentioned, he and his brother R\u0101fi' took part in the dissensions between Al Mukallid and \u1e24asan, the sons of Al Musayyib. On that occasion, we are told, R\u0101fi' was in favour of war, whilst Gharib recommended a settlement of the dispute by peaceful means.\n\nIn A.H. 411 we find Gharib in alliance with Nur ed Daulah Dubays the Asadi. Aided by troops from Baghdad, they attacked Gharib's kinsman Kirw\u0101sh, the Prince of Mau\u1e63il, and utterly defeated him. Kirw\u0101sh and R\u0101fi', son of Al Husayn and cousin of Gharib, were both taken prisoners, but through Gharib's influence they were soon released. The allies, however, followed up their victory by the capture of Takrit. Six years later Kirwash had again to defend himself against the Asadis, who on this occasion were aided by the Banu Khaf\u0101ji. This was followed in the same year by an alliance between R\u0101fi' ibn al Husayn, seconded by an 'Okayli chief, Najdat ed Daulah ibn Kur\u0101d, and Badr\u0101n the brother of Kirwash. The latter was, however, on the present occasion, supported by Abu Sin\u0101n Gharib, and by reinforcements supplied to him by the Merwanis, placing a total force of 13,000 men at his command. The two armies met near\nBalad (on the Tigris, seven parasangs from Mausil), and an indecisive action was fought, in which heavy losses were suffered on both sides. A pause ensued, and a dramatic scene followed, which brought the war to an end. Najdat ed Daulah stepped forward and embraced Gharib between the arrayed ranks. Abu'l Fadl Badran did the same to his brother Kirwash, and terms of peace were soon arranged.\n\nThe full name and title of the hero on that occasion, as they may be gathered from a comparison of the passages in which he is mentioned (Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. pp. 116, 249, 265 and 297), seems to have been Najdat ed Daulah Kamil Abu Mansur Tharwan, son of Kurad. It seems probable that he is the same person as is afterwards mentioned (pp. 402 and 410) as Kamil ibn Muhammad ibn al Musayyib, Prince of Al Hazirah. The latter must, however, almost unquestionably have been son of Abu Dhawwad, whilst Najdat ed Daulah is represented as son of Kurad, a name which nowhere else appears. The difficulty may perhaps be overcome when it is considered how easily in Arab manuscript the word \u0627\u062f\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652 may be misread for \u0627\u062f\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652. The hostility of Najdat ed Daulah to Kirwash may be explained by the ingratitude and scandalous treachery with which the latter requited the services he received from his kinsman, on the death of his father, Al Mukallid, in A.H. 391.\n\nIn the unsuccessful campaign of Kirwash against the Banu Khafajah, which followed immediately after the events above related, and which resulted in the loss of his possessions on the Euphrates, he was again supported by Gharib.\n\nIn 420 Nur ed Daulah Dubays the Asadi, who had involved himself in hostilities with Jalal ed Daulah the Buwayhi, fled for refuge to Najdat ed Daulah, by whom he was placed under the protection of Abu Sinan Gharib, and\n\n---\n\n1 Al Hazirah was a town two days' journey from Baghdad, on the road to Mausil. Ibn Kurad is spoken of in 391 and 420 as dwelling at Sindiyah, and Kamil in 410 as possessing an encampment at Bardan. Both these places are in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and at a short distance from one another.\n\n2 See Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. p. 116.\nthrough the latter's influence and assistance, Dubays was restored to his dominions.\n\nIn the following year strife again broke out between Gharib himself and his cousin Abu'l Musayyib R\u0101fi', son of Husayn. Gharib collected a strong force of Arabs and Kurds, and with further reinforcements of well-appointed troops supplied to him by Jal\u0101l ed Daulah, he laid siege to Takrit, a town on the Tigris above Baghdad, which was subject to R\u0101fi'. The latter had gone to Mau\u0161il, where he obtained the alliance of Kirw\u0101sh, with whom he marched against the enemy. On their approach, Gharib abandoned the siege and fell upon the army of the allies. Through the treachery of some of his own people, who seized the opportunity to attack and plunder his baggage and that of the Buwayhi troops, Gharib was defeated and put to flight. He was pursued by Kirwash and R\u0101fi' to his Bedouin encampment, which, however, they not only refrained from molesting, but actually protected from injury. Peace was soon concluded, and friendly relations between them resumed.\n\nIn 423, when Jal\u0101l ed Daulah Abu T\u0101hir the Buwayhi was driven out of Baghdad by the Turkish soldiers, he took refuge at 'Okbara, a town on the eastern bank of the Tigris, not far from Baghdad, which, as will presently be seen, appears to have been subject at that time to Gharib, whilst his waz\u012br, Abu Ish\u0101q es Sahali, fled to the Arab chief's tents. Jal\u0101l ed Daulah remained at 'Okbara forty-three days, at the end of which, the Khutbah having been restored in his name, he returned to Baghdad.\n\nAbu Sin\u0101n Gharib died in A.H. 425 at Samarra, aged seventy years, leaving in treasure alone a sum of 500,000 dinars. He is stated to have been succeeded by his son Abu 'r Ray\u0101n, of whom there appears to be no further record. Another son is however mentioned by Ibn al Athir, Abu'l Hindi Bilal, who in A.H. 441 was in possession of the towns of \u1e24arba, Nahr Bey\u1e6dar and Aw\u0101na,\u00b9 granted to him\n\n\u00b9 'Okbara and Aw\u0101na are situated on the opposite banks of the Tigris about ten parasangs above Baghdad. \u1e24arba and Nahr Bey\u1e6dar were two small towns at a short distance from the others.\nby Z\u0101'im ed Daulah Abu Kamil, the brother and successor of Kirwash.\n\nIbn al Athir states that Ghar\u012bb bore the lakab of Seyf ed Daulah. Elsewhere (p. 288 b) he calls him Kam\u0101l ed Daulah. He goes on to say that Ghar\u012bb struck dirhems, to which he gave the name of Seyfiyyah (sword pieces). I became possessed some years ago of a dirhem struck at \u2018Okbara in A.H. 422, which seems to be one of these identical coins, and which, as far as my knowledge goes, is the only specimen of the coinage of the Princes of the family of Ma'n known to be extant. It bears the impress of a sword, and the inscriptions go to prove that Ghar\u012bb bore the double title of Kam\u0101l ed Daulah and Seyf ed Din, \u201cPerfection of the State and Sword of the Faith.\u201d The diameter of the coin, which is in a good state of preservation, is 1\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) in., and it weighs 54 grains.

That of the Khalifah\u2019s son and successor, Abu Ja\u2018fir Abd Allah, Al \u1e32\u0101-im bi amr Illah, who in A.H. 421 was at a public assembly solemnly proclaimed heir to the Khalifate. That of \u2018Okbara, the place of mintage. And finally that of the Buwayhi Prince Abu T\u0101hir, surnamed Jal\u0101l ed Daulah, son of Baha. ed Daulah, who reigned over\nIr\u0101k from A.H. 418 to A.H. 435, and whom Abu Sinan Ghar\u012bb recognizes as his superior. Jal\u0101l ed Daulah was proclaimed successor to his brother Musharrif ed Daulah on the latter's death in Rabi'al Awwal, 416; but it was not until the month of Ramadan, 418, that he ventured or was able to enter Baghdad and to assume the direction of the Government. His reign was chiefly marked by gross insubordination on the part of his Turkish troops. They repeatedly rose against him, and he was more than once compelled to fly from the city, whilst the soldiery broke down the gates of his palace and plundered it. On one occasion they attacked his wazir 'Umayd ed Daulah. They beat him, drove him from his house barefooted, dragged his clothes off his back, tore up his turban and wrenched off his rings with such violence that his fingers bled. The wazir threw himself at the feet of his master, complaining of the treatment he had undergone. \"I am the son of Baha ed Daulah,\" answered the latter, \"and I have suffered even greater indignity.\" Jal\u0101l ed Daulah died in A.H. 435. \"Whoever,\" remarks the historian, \"considers the weakness of his character, the violence to which he was subjected, and the lengthened period over which his reign was nevertheless prolonged, must clearly perceive that God's power encompasseth all things, that He giveth sovereignty unto whom He willeth and that He taketh it from whom He willeth\" (Kuran iii. 25).\u00b9\n\nThe title Shahin Shah, which appears upon the coin, was commonly borne by the Buwayhis, and both it and its Arabic equivalent, Malik al Mul\u016bk, King of Kings, are to be found on the coinage of Baha ed Daulah. It seems somewhat singular to read that, when in A.H. 429 Jal\u0101l ed Daulah applied for a grant of the Arabic rendering of the title, as openly borne by his father, the Khal\u012bfah displayed the utmost unwillingness, and finally referred the question of its lawfulness to the decision of five jurists. A majority of four decided in the affirmative, and the title was consequently inserted in the Khutbah, but the question is said to have been obstinately disputed by the dissentient.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. pp. 288b, 352.\n\u00b2 Ibid., vol. ix. p. 312.\nGharib's brother Shah\u0101b ed Daulah Abu Dir\u2018a R\u0101fi\u2018 died in 406. Under the date A.H. 397 Ibn al Ath\u012br relates that the Kurdish chief Abu'l Fath, son of \u2018Annaz (who was succeeded in 401 by his son Abu\u2019sh Sh\u014dk), took refuge with Abu Dir\u2018a from Bedr, son of Husnaweyh, who had deprived him of the towns Hulwan and Kirmisin. Bedr sent to Shahab ed Daulah a message, in which, after appealing to the friendship that existed between him and R\u0101fi\u2018\u2019s father, he reproached him with harbouring an enemy, and desired him to expel Abu'l Fath. The Arab refused, and Bedr thereupon sent an army to his territories, situated on the eastern bank of the Tigris. The country was plundered, Shabab ed Daulah\u2019s tents at Al Mu\u1e6dirah were looted and burnt, and the castle of Bard\u0101n, which he possessed in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, underwent the same fate.\n\nMost of these \u2018Okayli princes enjoyed some reputation as poets.

He was Lord of Takrit, where he also, in A.H. 427, afforded a temporary refuge to Jal\u0101l ed Daulah. R\u0101fi' died that same year. He is described as remarkable for bravery and for determination of character. He had lost one of his hands, which was accidentally struck off by the slave of a kinsman at a drinking party, in the course of a quarrel over which the disputants had drawn their swords, and which R\u0101fi' was endeavouring to appease. An artificial hand was made for him, with which he was able to manage his horse, and the loss did not incapacitate him from taking his part in battle.\n\nThe following is given by Ibn al Ath\u012br as a specimen of his poetic talents:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0631\u064a\u0642\u064e\u0629 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0641\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0646\u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0648\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0631\n\u0648\u0635\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0632\u0627\u064a \u062c\u0641\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0627 \u0642\u0637 \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0641\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0641\u0631\u064a\n\u0646\u0642\u0644\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u062f\u062c \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0639\u062f\u0649 \u0644\u0641\u0642\u062f\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0639\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u0631\n\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0642 \u0631\u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0628\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0631\n\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0632 \u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0641\u0639 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u063a\u0636\u0631\u0649\n\n\"The dew upon her lips (I implore forgiveness of God!)\nIs sweeter and more enticing to the soul than wine.\nPiercing glances never cease to dart forth from beneath her eyelids:\nThose eyes, keen-edged swords, which wound without quitting their sheaths.\nI exclaimed as the morn's grey light came bearing forth a new day,\n'Be disdainful over my absence by virtue of the cruel indifference thou displayest!\nHenceforth my days of youth will be directed to the noble object\nOf seeking a high estate, of earning the brilliant rewards of ambition.\nIs it not a signal loss that my nights pass away in vain desires,\nAnd yet are counted against me in the reckoning of my life?'\"\nR\u0101fi\u02bf was succeeded by his nephew, Abu Man\u02bfah Kham\u012bs, son of Taghlib, who, it is said, found in his uncle's treasury at Takrit a sum of upwards of 500,000 dinars, besides gold and silver plate.\u00b9 Kham\u012bs was living in exile at the time of R\u0101fi\u02bf's death, and the first use he made of his inheritance was to conciliate his suzerain, Jal\u0101l ed Daulah, with an offering of 80,000 dinars.\n\nIt may here be observed that these Arab chiefs, though exercising rulership over principalities, towns, and cultivated districts, did not abandon their national habits, but continued to live with their families in tents and in the midst of their tribesmen. But that mode of life did not preclude indulgence of a taste for pomp and luxury, and for the display of wealth, represented by numerous slaves of both sexes, white as well as black, of valuable horses, of gold and silver utensils, and of costly weapons and fabrics. After the defeat of Kirw\u0101sh, in A.H. 392, by the Buwayhi troops, the latter marched upon the encampment of his ally on that occasion, Abu'l Hasan Ali ibn Mazyad the Asadi, which they looted, and in which, the historian tells us, they found an amount of valuables in the shape of coin, precious metals and stuffs, beyond all powers of estimation. It was only after he founded Al Hillah that Seyf ed Daulah \u015easakah, great-grandson of Abu'l Hasan, renounced tent life. There is also enough to show that these Arab princes were not altogether free from the laxity in matters of religion for which their Bedouin countrymen are noted. It is said of the 'Okayli prince Kirwash, that he married two sisters, and, on its being pointed out to him that he was infringing the religious law, he answered with the question: \"How much is there in our customs that is lawful according to the religious code?\" He piously congratulated himself on the fact that all he had on his conscience was the blood of five or six Bedouin Arabs. As for townspeople, he said, God will demand no account of them.\u00b2\n\nKham\u012bs had to defend himself against an attempt on the\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. p. 307; vol. x. p. 289.\n\u00b2 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. p. 403.\npart of Kirw\u0101sh to dispossess him of Takr\u012bt. He applied to his suzerain, Jalal ed Daulah, for assistance, which was granted, and thanks to which, but still more to the dissensions that broke out within the tribe, Kham\u012bs was eventually allowed to remain unmolested. He died in A.H. 435, and was succeeded by his son, Abu Ghashsham. The latter's brother \u1e24isa, in A.H. 444, rose against him, obtained possession of the citadel, and placed Abu Ghashsham in confinement.\n\nToghrul Beg entered Baghdad in Shawwal, 447, having destroyed the last vestige of the Buwayhi power, and imprisoned Malik er Rah\u012bm, the last prince of the dynasty. But the Seljuk Sultan had still to overcome the opposition of Al Basasiry, a powerful Buwayhi noble, one of whose most important allies was Nur ed Daulah Dubays, who had given him his daughter in marriage, and who was impelled both by his ambition, but in a still greater degree by his apprehensions, to support the cause of his kinsman. \u1e32uraysh, son of Badran, the \u2018O\u1e33ayli prince, had declared himself for the Seljuks, but he was attacked near Sinjar, was defeated and wounded, and surrendered himself to his antagonists. He was honourably treated, and they persuaded him to join their cause. They accompanied him to Mau\u1e63il, where the supremacy of the Egyptian Khalifah was formally proclaimed, the Khutbah recited from the pulpits in the name of Al Mustans\u012br, and where they were rewarded by the receipt from Cairo of dresses of honour.\n\nToghrul Beg had however determined to deal in person with the rebels. He set forth from Baghdad towards the end of A.H. 448, about thirteen months after his arrival in the city. He reached Takr\u012bt, now under the rule of Na\u1e63r, son of \u1e24isa, son of Kham\u012bs, and prepared to lay siege to the city. Na\u1e63r saved himself by displaying from his battlements the black ensign of the Abass\u012bs, and by another and more tangible token of his allegiance, the presentation to Toghrul Beg of a sum of money. It was accepted and the Turkish Sultan proceeded on his way.\n\nThese events were almost immediately succeeded by the\ndeath of Na\u1e63r. His mother Am\u012brah, who was daughter of Abu Sinan Gharib, rather than allow Abu Ghashsham to recover possession of Takr\u012bt, put him to death, and delivered the town to Abu'l Ghan\u0101'im, who subsequently became a faithful adherent of the Abassis, and by whom it was handed over to Toghrul Beg. Am\u012brah afterwards married Kuraysh, son of Badran, and is said to have been killed at Mau\u1e63il by the son of Abu Ghashsham, in revenge for the death of his father.\n\nI find mention of only two other members of the family of Ma'n, Az Zurayr and Ma\u1e6dar, who are described as sons of Ali, son of Ma'n. They allied themselves with So'da, son of Abu'sh Sh\u014dk, the Kurdish Chief, in his struggles with his uncle Muhalhal, and it was at their instigation and with their assistance that a battle was fought, in which Muhalhal was taken prisoner.\u00b9\n\nI may conclude this sketch of the history of the 'Okaylis in 'Ir\u0101\u1e33 with the mention of two other personages, descendants of Al Mukallid son of Ja'fir, but who belonged neither to the family of Musayyib nor to that of Ma'n. One of these was Muhammad, son of R\u0101fi', son of Rif\u0101', son of Dubayah, son of M\u0101lik, son of Al Mukallid. He was governor of the city of Hit, on the Euphrates, on behalf of Wahb, son of Wahaybah, an 'Okayli chief who had received a grant of the city from Sultan Barkiaruk. Seyf ed Daulah \u1e62adakah set his mind upon obtaining possession of the city, and in A.H. 496 he overcame the resistance of the 'Okaylis and accomplished his object.\u00b2\n\nThe other was Muhy ed din Abu'l H\u0101rith Muh\u0101rish, son of Al Mujalli, also a descendant of Al Mukallid, son of Ja'fir. Toghrul Beg had in A.H. 450 gone in pursuit of his brother Ibrahim Nay\u0101l to Hamadan. Al Bassasiri seized the opportunity to enter Baghdad. He made himself master of the city and proclaimed the supremacy of Al Mustansir. The white banner of the Fatimites was everywhere displayed, and the Khutbah recited in the mosques in the\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. p. 404.\n\u00b2 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. x. p. 247.\nname of the heretical Khal\u012bfah of Cairo, who won the brilliant though but short-lived triumph of being solemnly recognized, in the capital and centre of Muhammedanism, as the lawful head of Isl\u0101m.\n\nThe situation of the Abassi Khal\u012bfah had from the first moment of these events became one of imminent peril. In this extremity his waz\u012br, known as the Ra-is er Ru-as\u0101, turned for help to the \u2018Okayli Prince Kuraysh, son of Badran. Addressing him by his title, \u2018Alam ed din, Banner of the Faith, he declared to him that God was conferring upon him an honour which no Prince had ever yet received. \u201cThe Commander of the Faithful places himself, his family and friends under your protection, the protection of God, of his Prophet, and of an Arab.\u201d Such an appeal could not be rejected, and Kuraysh, removing his mitre-shaped cap (Kalans\u016bwah), sent it to the Khal\u012bfah, handing his staff of command to the Ra-is er Ru-as\u0101, as pledges of his protection. The Khal\u012bfah was mounted, wearing the black robes of the Abassis and the burdah, or sacred mantle of the Prophet, and with the black banner floating over him, he was conducted to the \u2018Okayli camp along with his wife Arslan Khatun, the niece of Toghrul Beg. Kuraysh, it must be added, in spite of his pledges, handed over the Ra-is er Ru-as\u0101 to Al Basasiri, by whom the unhappy waz\u012br was put to a cruel and ignominious death.\n\nA place of greater safety had to be found for the Khal\u012bfah. Kuraysh placed him under the care of Muh\u0101rish, by whom he was conveyed to Hadithat-\u2018\u0100nah, of which Muh\u0101rish was ruler.\u00b9 There he remained until his restoration at the end of a period of twelve months.\n\nMuh\u0101rish, who throughout his life was held in great respect, died in A.H. 499, at the age of about eighty years, and was succeeded by his son Suleyman. The latter died in A.H. 528. The family of the \u2018Okayli Princes of Mausil was now virtually extinct, and we find Suleyman spoken of not only as Prince of \u1e24adithah, but also as Amir of his tribe.\n\n\u00b9 Hadithah and \u2018\u0100nah are two towns on the Euphrates, about thirty-five miles from one another.\nHe was succeeded by his sons, who, at their installation, were carried in procession through the streets of Baghdad, in recognition of the services rendered by their grandfather to the Khalifate. Nevertheless, they continued in possession of \u1e24ad\u012bthah only until A.H. 536, when the \u0100tabek \u2018Imad ed din Zenki took possession of the town, and removed the descendants of Muh\u0101r\u012bsh to Mau\u1e63il.\n\nThe last of the \u2018O\u1e33aylis to hold anything like princely rank was a descendant of Badr\u0101n, son of Al Mukallid and brother of Kirwash. In A.H. 478 the castle of Aleppo was held by S\u0101lim, son of M\u0101lik, son of Badran. It had been placed under his charge by his chief and kinsman, Sharaf ed Daulah Muslim, and it continued in his hands after the death of Sharaf ed Daulah, who was killed towards the beginning of that year in a battle fought with the Turkish Prince of K\u014dniyah (Iconium). In the following year the city of Aleppo was taken by Malik Shah. The citadel, under the command of S\u0101lim, continued to hold out, but was eventually surrendered to the Sultan in exchange for the Castle of Ja\u2018bir, a fortress of great strength, built on a height overlooking the eastern bank of the Euphrates, a short distance above the town of Rak\u1e33ah. It had been taken by Malik Shah, from an Arab of the tribe of K\u016bshayr (sister-tribe of the Banu \u2018O\u1e33ayl) on his march to Aleppo. Its owner, a blind old man, was a notorious robber, who, together with his two sons and other followers, was put to death by Malik Shah.\n\nS\u0101lim took possession of the castle, and soon afterwards rendered himself master also of Rak\u1e33ah. According to the Arab chronicler, Baldwin, Count of Edessa (Bohemond?), was in A.H. 502 (?) placed under the custody of Shams ed Daulah S\u0101lim at the castle of Ja\u2018bir, until the surrender of his kinsman Joscelin, who was to remain as hostage for payment of his ransom.\u00b9\n\nShortly afterwards Rak\u1e33ah was attacked and captured by the Banu Numayr, and Ali, the son of S\u0101lim, who was in command of the town, was killed. Shams ed Daulah S\u0101lim\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. x. p. 322.\ndied in A.H. 519, and appears to have been succeeded by his grandson, Malik, son of Ali. In A.H. 541 the castle was besieged by the Atabek 'Im\u0101d ed din Zenki. Its strength defying all his efforts to capture it, he tried the effect of alternate promises and threats. Before any result could be arrived at, the Atabek was assassinated in his tent by a party of his own Mamluks, an event which brought the siege of the castle to an end.\n\n'Im\u0101d ed din's son, and successor to the sovereignty of Aleppo, Nur ed din Mahmud, was more successful. Malik had, in 563, left the protection of the castle, on a hunting expedition, when he was set upon by a party of Banu Kil\u0101b, who carried him off and delivered him into the hands of Nur ed din. The Atabek laid siege to the castle, but failed in his attempts to capture it. But he was more fortunate than his father in dealing with its owner, who was now in his power. The same policy of alternate promises and threats at length brought matters to a successful issue. Malik surrendered the fortress, and received in exchange the town of Sar\u016bj, a sum of 20,000 dinars in cash, and the revenues of the salt deposits in the neighbourhood of Buz\u0101'ah near Aleppo.\u00b9\n\nIbn Khald\u016bn tells us that when the 'Okayli power in Mesopotamia and 'Ir\u0101k was destroyed, and their dominions appropriated by the Seljuks, the tribe returned to its original home in Bahrayn. The Taghlibite sovereignty exercised by the descendants of Abu'l \u1e24asan al A\u1e63far had ere this fallen into a state of complete decay, and was easily overthrown. The country was subdued by the 'Okaylis, and, together with the district of Yam\u0101mah, which they conquered from the Banu Kil\u0101b, it was ruled for several generations by a family known as the Banu 'Asf\u016br, belonging to the sub-tribe of Banu '\u0100mir, son of 'Okayl. Ibn Khald\u016bn adds a quotation from Ibn Sa'id to the effect that, when at Medinah in 651, he was informed by natives of Bahrayn\n\n\u00b9 Sar\u016bj is a town near Harran, in the modern province of Orfah or Edessa. It is famed in Arabic literature as the reputed native place of Abu Zayd es Sar\u016bji, the hero of the Mak\u0101mat of Hariri.\nthat their country was at that time still under the rule of the family of \u2018A\u1e63f\u0101r, Princes of Al Ahsa.\n\nSo far as I am able to discover, little or nothing can be added from existing Arab histories to the meagre account given by Ibn Khald\u016bn of the expedition of the Taghlibite al A\u1e63far against the Carmathians. (Supra, p. 505.)\n\nI may here add that, in the absence in England of a complete MS. copy of Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work, I have been almost wholly dependent, in collecting these notes on the history of the \u2018Okayli tribe, upon the edition of Ibn Khald\u016bn printed at Bulak. It is a work for which all students of Eastern history may well feel grateful. But it is unfortunately disfigured by innumerable and palpable errors. Some may no doubt be traced to the MSS. from which the book has been printed, but in most instances they can only be rightly attributed to the deplorable manner in which it has been edited. The passage (vol. iv. p. 91) in which Al A\u1e63far is represented as conquering Mesopotamia and Mau\u0161il from the \u2018Okaylis in A.H. 438, sixty years after his expedition against the Carmathians, and as being eventually defeated and imprisoned by Na\u1e63ir ed Daulah ibn Marwan, is hardly likely to be an error of the author, and is more probably the interpolation of some careless reader. It is no doubt based upon a misconception of somewhat similar events recorded by Ibn al Athir, obviously quite unconnected with the history of Bahrayn, although the Taghlibite al A\u1e63far, here in question, may possibly have been a member of the family founded by the conqueror of the Carmathians.\u00b9\n\nM. Tiesenhausen, in the first note to his work, gives a passage from Al Jann\u0101bi (who died in A.H. 999), quoted by that writer from the Ma\u2018\u0101rif al Muta-akhirah of Ibn Abd al Malik al Hamad\u0101ni, reciting the expulsion of the Banu Sulaym and Banu \u2018Okayl from Bahrayn by the Taghlibites, the return of the \u2018Okaylis after their overthrow by the Seljuks, their conquest of Bahrayn and Yamamah, and the endurance of their dominion until after A.H. 651. The passage is somewhat briefer than the corresponding one in\n\n\u00b9 See Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. p. 369.\nIbn Khald\u016bn. It not only, however, adds absolutely nothing to the information contained in the latter, but the wording of Al Jann\u0101bi\u2019s extract, apart from its being somewhat condensed, is identically the same. Ibn Khald\u016bn may possibly have derived his information from Al Hamad\u0101ni, or both may have drawn from a common source; but Al Hamad\u0101ni died in A.H. 521, and Ibn Khald\u016bn repeatedly tells us that the reference to the date 651 was from the writings of Ibn Sa\u2018id. It seems more probable, therefore, that Al Jann\u0101bi\u2019s passage was copied, not from Al Hamad\u0101ni, but from Ibn Khald\u016bn.\nART.

Secretary R.A.S.)\n\nThe Hebrews came in contact principally with two great nations of antiquity, the Egyptians and the Persians; at least it is with them mainly, if not solely, that their literature has preserved any traces of connection: and these traces are chiefly to be found in the books of Moses and in the books of Daniel, Ezra and Esther. As the Persian rule of Babylon did not begin till 536 B.C., one would suppose that the records of the earlier reigns of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar would not supply us with any words of Aryan derivation or connection, and this is undoubtedly a difficulty, as it is for many of the words we meet with in these records that such derivation has been suggested, or any such connection supposed. There can be no doubt that a large number of Semitic roots were once in use, of which no trace survives in the Old Testament, and therefore it is quite possible that, if we had a knowledge of these roots, many difficult words would at once be explained and made clear to us. One would expect, moreover, that the words in the parts of Daniel belonging or at all events referring to the Assyrian period would have an Assyrian and therefore a Semitic character, as indeed such names as Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar show that they have; or, if they were affected at all by Accadian contact, it would be that contact of which we should expect to find traces rather than of any Persian influence. I am too profoundly ignorant and too uncertain on the subject of Accadian discovery to make any use of this myself or to feel any confidence in it when made. It seems to me that our best security is to be found in an\nattitude of watchful and patient waiting rather than in precipitate eagerness to clutch at results. The case is different with regard to words of Egyptian origin. The progress of Egyptian discovery has been much more prolonged and thorough. It is nearly a hundred years since the first steps were taken towards the decipherment of the hieroglyphics, and successive scholars have pushed their discoveries further and further, till a position of comparative certainty has been attained. Much of course still remains to be done, but it is at least an indication of superior advancement that the confidence of those who are not experts, but are not devoid of learning, nor incapable of forming an opinion, is given with more ungrudging alacrity to the Egyptologist than to the Assyriologist. The science of the one has survived its nonage, but that of the other may be said to be still in its infancy. At all events that is my feeling, and I am not alone in my conviction. It must be borne in mind, however, that this is an expression of opinion, and not advanced as a statement of fact.\n\nThe progress of Egyptian discovery has thrown a flood of light upon the records of the Bible. If the Pentateuch is in any degree an authentic work, it was almost certain to contain numerous references to Egyptian customs and traces of the language of Egypt. That it has been proved conclusively to do so is a very solid argument for its being the genuine work it pretends to be; indeed so clear and so numerous are the points of contact it presents with the actual Egypt of history and the monuments, that we have to be on our guard against being tempted to multiply these instances to an unwarrantable degree. The indications of connection are so many that we must beware of imagining them where they do not exist. Here also discretion is the better part of that valour which will ultimately lead to victory.\n\nThere is not seldom a danger of accidental similarity being mistaken for direct relationship. It is not all the members of the same family that are alike, and it is not every two persons that strongly resemble one another, who are members\nof the same family because they are alike. The science of comparative philology has made enormous strides, and the most substantial results have been secured; but it will probably be a long time yet before its greatest triumph will be achieved, the establishment, for example, upon a sure foundation\u2014a triumph, however, which is by no means improbable, and which I for one should be prepared to expect\u2014of the relation between the Semitic and the Aryan branches of language.\n\nThe first familiar foreign word which strikes us in the Bible is the title or appellation common to the Egyptian kings, viz. Pharaoh. It was formerly usual, after Josephus, to identify this word with the Coptic \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf 'king,' the article \u03a0\u03b9 or \u03a6 being prefixed. This etymology, however, did not seem to bring us very near to the Biblical \u05e4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05e2\u05b9\u05d4. And then it was thought that the true equivalent might be found in the Egyptian word \u05e4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05e2 'the sun,' also with the article \u03a0\u03b9 prefixed. It seemed fatal, however, to this suggestion, that the word \u05e4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05e2 was mostly found at the end of the king's name and without the article prefixed. The king, moreover, was called \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 \u05e4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05e2 'the son of Ra,' and this fact made it unlikely that he should also be called the Ra. The derivation therefore which I believe is received with more general favour now is that Pharaoh means \"the house\" or \"the great house,\" very much as we still speak of the Sublime Porte. It seems to be essential that we give due heed to the silent Shewa under the Resh in Pharaoh, and divide the word accordingly Phar-aoh, not Pha-raoh. For myself I am free to confess that though this proposed derivation may be better than either of the others, it fails to give me entire satisfaction, and though willing to accept it provisionally, I should nevertheless like to have some clearer and more obvious representative of the Hebrew Pharaoh than \"the house\" or \"the great house\" seems to suggest. One would have thought that a title so common as that of Pharaoh is in the Biblical records would have been equally common on the monuments, and that the identity of the two would be\na matter of certainty. The fact, however, that these various derivations have been proposed seems to show plainly that this is not the case. It of course follows that if Phar-ah means \"the great house,\" then another well-known name, that of Potiphar, will mean \"he who is devoted to the house,\" or \"the servant of the house,\" and so, like Pharaoh itself, be a title, and not an appellation. In close connection with this name comes another, which has often been confounded with it, viz. that of Potipherah, the priest of On or Heliopolis. Here it would appear that we may with more certainty detect the presence of the Egyptian \\( \\text{pa} \\), and then in that case Potipherah will mean \"he who is devoted to the sun,\" or \"the servant of the sun,\" an appellation obviously appropriate to the priest of the temple of the sun at On.\n\nThe word abrek, Gen. xli. 43, is rendered in the Authorised Version \"Bow the knee,\" with a margin \"or tender father,\" and in the Revised Version the same rendering is retained in the text, with a margin \"Probably an Egyptian word, similar in sound to the Hebrew word meaning to kneel.\" The version of the LXX. omits the word altogether, and has simply \"a herald proclaimed before him.\" The Syriac has \"Father and ruler.\" We see then that some translators have regarded this word as a significant Hebrew word, to be explained by the analogy of the language, while others have regarded it as a foreign word, and sought its meaning in the native languages of Egypt. There are only two ways in which it can be explained in Hebrew, which are severally represented in the text and margin of the A.V. The first of these is the explanation of Aben Ezra, who regards the \\( \\text{N} \\) as put for the \\( \\text{n} \\), just as in Jer. xxv. 3 we find \\( \\text{N} \\text{N} \\text{N} \\) instead of \\( \\text{N} \\text{N} \\text{N} \\); the other is that of Rashi, who quotes the Talmud, saying that Joseph was a father in wisdom, but tender in years. In the former case Abrech must be an imperative Hiphil wrongly spelt; we should moreover expect the plural rather than the singular in the proclamation of the herald to the people; in the other case the noun and adjective must either form a sort of compound, very unusual\nin Hebrew, or must be wrongly joined together. There can be little doubt that we have here the actual word of the country used in the proclamation, and consequently its meaning must be sought in the vernacular language of the country. In Coptic a compound word may be formed from \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad 'the head,' and \u03c0\u03b5\u03ba 'to bow,' which approximates in sound to the Hebrew, but I believe it is not found in actual use. In the Coptic version of St. John's Gospel viii. 8, we have \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03ba\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b7 'he bowed his head,' stooped down, but this does not give us the compound required, as the \u1f00\u03c0 is merely a pronominal particle used with verbs; and therefore after all it seems that this use of the word is conjectural, and that no example is forthcoming of any actual word in form like that which we suppose Abrech must have approximately represented. The \"new explanation\" mentioned by Mr. Cheyne, whom Delitzsch quotes\u00b9 in the prolegomena to his new W\u00f6rterbuch, declared by the former to be plausible, and apparently accepted by the latter, namely that Abrech comes direct from the Assyrian abarakku 'grand vizier,' can hardly be entertained with any degree of probability, and affords an instance of the need there is for speculative caution in these matters. The idea of Pharaoh travelling to Assyria to find a title which the herald was to proclaim before Joseph, and which it may be presumed the people would understand, comes barely within the confines of common sense. The word is unquestionably an Egyptian word; but what its real equivalent was in monumental or spoken Egyptian is more than we are as yet able to discover or determine, humiliating as the confession may be to our philological knowledge or ingenuity. The marginal note of the Revised Version is probably as accurate and as near as we can get to the truth, and the supposed Egyptian word not improbably meant \"to bow the head or kneel.\" For the rest we can only exclaim with Luther, \"was Abrech heisse lassen wir die Zancher suchen bisz an den j\u00fcngsten Tag.\"\n\nIn the same connection we have the name that Pharaoh\n\n\u00b9 p. 145, n. 2.\ngave Joseph, Zaphnath-Paaneah, which is undoubtedly Egyptian. Of this Aben Ezra says quaintly, \"If this word is Egyptian, we do not know what it means,\" and Rashi says, \"There is no word like Paaneah in Scripture.\" We have here then without doubt an attempt to represent a genuine Egyptian word in Hebrew letters. The question is what the word or words can be. \u03bf\u03bd\u03c4, \u03c9\u03c4\u03b5 are Coptic words, meaning 'redemption,' and \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0 is 'the age,' aiou. The two together then may mean, 'The redemption of the age' or, as applied to a person, 'the Saviour of his time or age,' that is, nearly equivalent to 'redeemer' or 'Saviour of the world.' The old notion that it meant revealer of secrets is a mere guess framed on the supposition that it was in some way of Hebrew origin, an idea which is highly improbable. There is another word \u03c9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7 'creation,' which, combined with \u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, 'to live,' may possibly mean \"creator or possessor of life.\" But to discover the particular Egyptian words which lie hid in the Hebrew disguise requires a far wider knowledge of Egyptian than I can lay claim to, as well as the special gifts of a veritable revealer of secrets.\n\nVarious derivations have been preferred for the name Moses such as \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c2 'son of the water,' \u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba 'natus,' \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9 'delivered from the water,' \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b9 'taken out of the water,' and the like. I confess, however, that I have never seen clearly why the word should be other than Hebrew, as the narrative certainly seems to suggest: \"And she called his name Moses and said for from the water I drew him, \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05dd\" In Psalm xviii., and the duplicate version of it in Samuel, the same word is found used in the Hiphil, with very probable reference to this narrative. We have no reason then to doubt that the word is a genuine Semitic root, and it does not seem unnatural that Pharaoh's daughter should give the Hebrew child a Hebrew name, and that the name should be one suggested by her own saving act, and so she called him not 'one drawn out or saved,' as we might expect, which would be \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05dd, but \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05dd 'a saviour or deliverer,' for she said \"I saved him from the water.\" In\nthis case it is needless to seek further for any Egyptian word as a derivation, and every suggestion must be more or less unsatisfactory and uncertain. It is evident that in many cases the names of the Old Testament heroes were unconsciously prophetic, and it might well be so with that of the great lawgiver and deliverer of the Hebrew nation.\n\nThe name of Joseph's wife, Asenath, is interpreted to mean 'a votary of Neith,' the prototype of Athene the goddess of wisdom, 'She who has been given to her.'\n\nThe word Pi-ahiroth is probably \u03c0\u03b9' \u1f08\u03c7\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8, the place where the \u1f08\u03c7\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8 grows; but Canon Cook makes it 'The house of wells, the watering-place in the desert.' In Gen. xl. 16 we have mention made of three \u1f00\u03c7\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8, rendered in the A.V. 'white baskets.' I understand that the Arabic hauri has survived to this day in Cairo, and means the leather covering of the bread basket. This word not improbably represents the old Egyptian word answering to \u1f00\u03c7\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8, but even here I do not feel by any means sure that the resemblance is not accidental, and the word itself Hebrew.\n\nThe word \u1f00\u03c7\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8 occurs fourteen times in the Pentateuch, but elsewhere only in Judges vi. 19, and is Semitic. The Hebrew \u1f00\u03c7\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8 is doubtless the Coptic \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba, 'juncus,' and is only found Ex. ii. 3, Job viii. 11, Is. xviii. 2, spoken of Ethiopia, and xxxv. 7, where it is rendered 'reeds and rushes.'\n\nonly found in Gen., where it is used twenty-six times of the ark of Noah and in Exodus twice of that of Moses, it appears to represent the Coptic \u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03af.\n\nonly occurs three times Gen. xi. 3 'slime had they for mortar;' xiv. 10 'The vale of Siddim was pits of slime;' and Ex. ii. 3 'daubed it with slime.' The Coptic equivalent is \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd, used of the ark of Noah, Gen. vi. 14 and xiv. 10, where the Heb. is \u1f00\u03c7\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8.\n\nmay at all events be compared with \u03c3\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 which is used in the same way and means the same thing.\n\n1 If M. Naville's identification of Pi ke heret holds good, neither can be accepted.\nIt is absurd, however, to suppose that one is borrowed from the other. The name of Moses' son Gershom has been connected with \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 'alienus,' but it seems more natural to find its origin in Heb. and regard it as a vocalised variation of \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df\u05be\u05d2\u05b5\u05e8, and so the Septuagint has \u0393\u03b7\u03c1\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc.\n\n\u1f21\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 'flax,' is one of those words which appear in the Pentateuch, Exodus ix. 31, and again in Isaiah xlii. 3, xliii. 17, but not elsewhere. It is interesting to note the occurrence of some of these words at those periods of the national history when there was special intercourse with Egypt. The equivalent for Goshen in Coptic is \u039a\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ad. According to Canon Cook, each of three nomes in the Delta bore a name of which the first syllable was \u03ba\u03b1. 'a bull,' and he says, moreover, on the authority of Brugsch, that the name of the twelfth nome in Lower Egypt was \u03ba\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5.\n\nPathom or Pithom is that which belongs to Thum. Pathros is probably \u03c0\u03b1-\u03b5\u03c4-\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 'that which is towards the south.'\n\nRameses is of course connected with \u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 'the sun,' and \u03c3\u03b5\u03be 'genitus, procreatus.' Succoth appears to have been identified by M. Naville with the name Thuku or Thuket found by him at Maskhutah. Pibeseth like Pithom is that which belongs to Beseth or Bubastis. A great many Hebrew words are given in the excursus of the Speaker's Commentary as being virtually Egyptian words. It seems to me that these must be received with great caution and a certain amount of reserve. It by no means follows, because there is an apparent similarity between two words in Egyptian and Hebrew, that they are the same word, or that the likeness is anything more than accidental; and even if we cannot discover the root of a Hebrew word in Hebrew, it does not follow that its root is to be found in Egyptian. It seems to me also that the principles of transliteration between Hebrew and Egyptian are too uncertain to be any sure guide to us, and that this is the case is proved by the variety of derivations and equivalents that have been proposed for the more common proper names, such as Pharaoh, Moses, and the like. To be quite sure that we have found\nthe true equivalent of a Hebrew word in Egyptian demands, moreover, a far greater knowledge of the latter language than I can pretend to possess, and not only a knowledge of its vocabulary, but a knowledge also of its laws of combination, composition, grammatical usage and the like. If we take the proper names that are certainly Egyptian, such as Pharaoh, Potiphar, Zaphnath-Paaneah, and the like, we find that scholars are by no means unanimous as to their meaning, and I for one am ready to confess that I think the list in the Speaker's Commentary is too long rather than too short. There are a few other words, such as \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05db\u05b4\u05d9, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05db\u05b4\u05d9, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05db\u05b4\u05d9, and the like, which we may feel pretty sure are Egyptian; but as for the rest of the list, I myself feel very doubtful indeed about them. For instance, it seems to me absurd to seek for an Egyptian origin for such a phrase as \u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b7\u05e8 \u05de\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd, the words used of Pharaoh's taskmasters Exodus i. 11. Each of the component elements is undoubtedly Hebrew: why not therefore the combination? 'He that was over the tribute' is a phrase with which we are familiar in 2 Sam. xx. 24, 1 Kings iv. 6, and elsewhere, and therefore hardly needs much explanation from foreign sources.\n\n\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05db\u05b4\u05d9 occurs only in Ex. ii. 3 and Is. xxxiv. 9 bis. Gesenius refers it to a root \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05db\u05b4\u05d9 = \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05db\u05b4\u05d9, 'to flow,' and compares the Arabic \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e, 'fluxit,' so that there seems no sufficient reason to search for it elsewhere.\n\nEx. vii. 11 'with their enchantments,' is simply the plural of the word used in Gen. iii. 24 of the flaming sword at Paradise.\n\n\u05d2\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 Gesenius regards as compounded of \u05d2\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'leaped, came forth,' and \u05e8\u05b5\u05d3\u05b5\u05e2 'a marsh,' as if leaping in or coming forth from the marsh. The Arabic retains the word only rejecting the \u05e8. With regard to the other words claimed as Egyptian, e.g., \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc, \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc, \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc, and some others\nnamed in the Speaker's Commentary, I see no reason to believe that they are other than genuinely Semitic words.\n\nI come now to the Persian and Aryan words in Daniel, Esther and Ezra, and the first is naturally Cyrus. In the Avesta Cyrus is Hu\u015brava. Rawlinson says the name is now generally connected with the Kuru family of Ancient India, Speaker's Commentary, 3, 422. The ancient authorities distinctly tell us that the name was equivalent to the sun, and that the Persians called the sun K\u016bpos or Ko\u016bpos. In modern Persian \u062e\u0648\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u062f is undeniably the sun, cf. Sansk. \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f 'a hero.' The Sanskrit writes the word for 'sun' with a dental \u0936. \u062e\u0648\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u062f=sunlight. Fuerst says the final \u062f is the nominative of the Persian, but the modern Persian has no nominative termination. Darius in like manner is doubtless connected with \u0627\u0631, meaning 'Lord, Master,' etc. with a like termination. The word also means 'house, palace,' etc. Cf. the word Pharaoh and its supposed meaning.\n\nArioch means a great lion, as Nisroch means a great eagle and the like. Abednego probably=Abed Nebo just as \u0392\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad\u03bb =\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd=\u03b3\u03bb\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, etc.\n\nMeshach is referred by Gesenius to \u0645\u06cc\u0632\u0631\u0627\u062e 'the guest or friend of the king.' According to Fuerst it is from \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930 the Sanskrit \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930 'a ram,' and hence the sun-god. Max M\u00fcller says, \"Meshach may have been mes 'friend,' and shah 'king,' but in Persian this compound could only mean 'king of the friend';\" but with all due deference, mes-i-shah in Modern Persian would unquestionably mean 'friend of the king.' But the similar termination in Shadrach leads us to seek some common element. Fuerst regards Shadrach as the same as Hadrach Zech. ix. 1, and thinks it means the circular path of the sun, thence the name of the sun-god.\u00b9\n\nAhasuerus probably exhibits a terminal formation similar to that in Cyrus, Darius, etc. It is the Greek Xerxes, the Sanskrit \u0916\u0947\u0924 being represented by \u03be in Greek and by\n\n\u00b9 This is rendered the more probable from the fact of the LXX. having \u03a7\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c7 in both places.\nin Hebrew, with a prosthetic and epenthetic letter, which the Hebrews were obliged to adopt to express the sound at the commencement of a syllable. In like manner \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd is the Hebrew equivalent for Artaxerxes, and the first syllable survives in \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd, but its actual derivation is not so easy to determine.

Esth. i. 3, etc., is probably connected with the Sanskrit \u2018first.\u2019\n\nperhaps connected with the Persian \u2018fear,\u2019 and \u2018to fear.\u2019 Gesenius compares \u2018Gestrenger Herr.\u2019 is interpreted by , but the modern Persian for \u2018part, portion, fragment\u2019 is , with which there is probably some connection.\n\nThe word is common both to the Egyptian and Chaldaean parts of the Bible, which is so far a reason for not seeking its origin in Coptic. Otherwise Gesenius compares from and and . I would rather believe with Fuerst that it is a derivative of stylus. In like manner we have \u2018an axe.\u2019 Some have compared .\n\nAccording to Gesenius and Fuerst, Belshazzar and Belteshazzar are only variations of the same name, and mean the Prince of Bel or the favourite of Bel, the sh or tsh being the\nZend genitive. Fuerst admits that the name has not yet been satisfactorily explained, and certainly the attempt to weld together a Chaldaean proper name and a Semitic termination by means of an Aryan genitive case-ending does not look promising. The names moreover must be distinct, and not improbably mean respectively 'Bel defends the prince' and 'Beltis defends the prince.'\n\nThe word \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d4 is thought to be connected with \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d4 and Pasha, but Pasha is supposed to be corrupted from Padishah, and if so can have nothing to do with \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d4 'wing,' etc. Fuerst compares \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d4 (\u2018dignity, rank, officer, employment,\u2019 Johnson) and translates it \u2018under-governor.\u2019 Max M\u00fcller asks by way of suggestion whether the \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d4 termination in the Chaldee can be meant for \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d4, Pusey, Daniel, p. 572. In that case the \u05e4 may represent the pad or \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d4, but the origin and derivation of this word is mysterious.\n\nDan. iii. 2, 3, \u2018the treasurers,\u2019 apparently the same as \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9 Ezra vii. 21, cf. \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9 i. 8. Of the last two words the first is taken as the plural of the second, and the word in Daniel as a variation of the same. In this case the etymology must be sought in the singular form of the word, and then treasure-bearer \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 \u2018treasurer\u2019 and \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 \u2018bearer or keeper,\u2019 may perhaps be the modern equivalents. But then their appearance in Daniel has to be accounted for. In like manner \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 \u2018counsellors,\u2019 Dan. iii. 2, 3 = law-bearers, or, at all events, that is the etymology proposed by so high an authority as Max M\u00fcller. It seems strange, however, that the long vowel in \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 and \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 should be represented by a sheva in Hebrew.\n\noccurs Daniel iii. 2, 3. The proposed reference to the Sanskrit \u092e\u0941\u092b\u094d\u0924\u093f is preposterous, as the modern word Mufti still survives from the same Semitic root = \u2018a wise man, learned in the law.\u2019\n\nThe word \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 Dan. i. 11, 16, evidently denotes an\nofficer; as to its derivation I feel very uncertain. The pro-\nposed \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 and \u03c7\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 is properly \u2018sweet,\u2019 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03c5, \u03c7\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 is\n\u2018head\u2019 in Persian) is highly unsatisfactory, and why should\nwe seek for Aryan etymologies at a time prior to the Persian\nrule?\n\nDan. ii. 6, v. 17, \u2018rewards,\u2019 may well be referred\nto the Semitic root \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3 in the sense of \u2018spoils, gains,\u2019 far\nmore naturally than to \u05d0\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0 or \u05d0\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0.\n\nonly in the plural seems to be referable to the Arabic\nroot \u0634\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0646, which in the second conjugation means \u2018ap-\npointed a deputy.\u2019 In the first conjugation it means \u2018filled.\u2019\nCf. the Hebrew phrase of filling the hand, that is, con-\nsecrating the priest. The Arabic usage may indeed be\nderived from this word, in which case we have carte blanche\nfor the derivation of its etymology.\n\nDan. iii. 21, 27. This has been identified by meta-\nthesis with the Persian \u0634\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631 or \u0634\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631 \u2018breeches or drawers.\u2019\nThe Arabic is \u0633\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644, plural \u0633\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644, and the etymology has\nbeen sought in \u03c7\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 and \u03c7\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, truly a curious etymology for\nbreeches \u2018a covering of the head.\u2019\n\nDan. vi. 3 \u2018presidents.\u2019 This is very possibly con-\nnected with Sargon and \u05e1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d2, and I would certainly rather\nrefer it to \u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e8 \u2018socius fuit\u2019 with Fuerst, than attempt to\nconnect it with \u03c7\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 v. Gesenius, which for many reasons I\nshould regard as impossible.\n\nDan. v. 7, 16, 29, evidently \u2018a chain.\u2019 This is\nreferred to the Sanskrit \u092e\u0923\u093f, but then what about the \u05e0\u05b6\u05d2?\nAll the commentators and the Dictionaries assume the con-\nnection with \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, monile, and the like, but it seems to\nme that the presence of the initial \u05e0 when it is not wanted\nis not so easily disposed of.\n\n\u2018cotton,\u2019 Esther i. 6, is undoubtedly the Sanskrit\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, the Greek \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 and Latin carbasus.\n\nis obviously connected with \u03c7\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u2018surrounded,\u2019 what-\never similarity or relation there may be with \u03ba\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 or \u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2.\n\n'\u092a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940 'a peacock' is probably the Sanskrit \u0936\u093f\u0915\u0930\u093f\u0923 'a crested one or peacock.' This word in Tamil becomes togei.\n\n'\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f 'apes' is supposed to be the Sanskrit \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f, which Bopp derives from \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d 'to move about.' If the m is really lost, this may account for the long vowel of the Hebrew.\n\n'\u0939\u093e\u0925\u093f\u0928\u0940' is in all probability 'tooth of the ibha, that is, elephant,' \u0939\u093e\u0925, a word which appears again in '\u0939\u093e\u0925\u093f\u0928\u0940' 'the elephant,' and in an Egyptian form quoted by Gesenius \u03b5\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd. The Semitic article is thus embodied in the word. Ebur is referred to the same word. This is one of the most interesting and the most certain instances of intercourse between the Semites and the Aryans.\n\n'\u0939\u093e\u0925\u093f\u0928\u0940' and '\u0939\u093e\u0925\u093f\u0928\u0940' is probably connected with one of two Sanskrit words that have been proposed, \u092e\u094b\u091a 'the silk cotton tree' and \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928 or \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928 'sandalwood.' The latter seems preferable.\n\n'\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03be' must be connected with \u03ba\u03af\u03c1\u03c5\u03be and similar words. In like manner \u03bf\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 must be connected with \u03ba\u03af\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1, \u03bf\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 with \u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7, and \u03bf\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 with \u03c8\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, and \u03bf\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 with \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1. It is manifestly one thing to trace a connection between words of this kind in languages not allied, and quite another to say that in the particular case one has been borrowed from the other.\n\n'\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c9' is a word found in Eccles. ii. 5, Song of Songs iv. 13, and Nehemiah ii. 8. It is obviously the Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, but the origin of the word is very uncertain. It is very frequently connected with the Sanskrit \u092a\u0930\u0926\u0947\u0936, but this properly means 'a foreign country,' though Fuerst gives it as 'a region of surpassing beauty.' Two other words are proposed, the Armenian pardes 'a garden surrounding a house,' and the Zend pairidaeza 'an inclosure.' The mutual relation of these several forms is doubtful, though they are probably connected.\nI do not pretend to have made a complete or exhaustive list of foreign words occurring in the Old Testament. I have contented myself rather with the more obvious and familiar ones. Every man who has a special taste for Egyptian or Assyrian investigation will easily imagine he detects Egyptian or Assyrian or Accadian words in Hebrew. The tendency is one which needs to be jealously and carefully watched, and does not want stimulating, as we are very apt to be misled by the fascination of our own imaginary discoveries, and there is nothing that is so absorbing as the fascination of a new discovery.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(June, July, August.)\n\nI. REPORTS OF MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY, SESSION 1885-86.\n\nSeventh Meeting, 21st June, 1886.\u2014E. L. Brandreth, Esq., in the Chair.\n\nElections: Surgeon-General W. R. Cornish, C.I.E.; General John Baillie; and Mr. Jehangir K. R. Kama, as Resident Members; Mr. William Davies as non-Resident Member.\n\nThe following paper was read by the author: Early Buddhist Symbolism, by Robert Sewell, Madras Civil Service, F.R.G.S., M.R.A.S. The object of the lecturer was to show that, in all probability, those symbols found carved on early Buddhist monuments, which cannot be directly traced to indigenous Indian sources, were derived from Western Asian symbols, pre-existent and connected with Sun-worship. Summarising the pre-Buddhist local history, he showed that for eight centuries Northern India lay open to Assyrian and Chaldaean influences, while for the succeeding two centuries a considerable portion of that country was subject to the Persian empire. Alluding to a probable trading intercourse of the inhabitants on either side the Indus, and giving proofs of Greek and Roman influence in India, he argued that the superstitions and beliefs of the masses of the people, whether there or in Assyria, Chaldaea or Persia, were very similar, and that consequently the present identification of early Buddhist symbols was nothing improbable. Mr. Sewell then entered into details, and illustrated his argument by reference to particular cases of analogy and resemblance.\n\n1 Of the five heads into which this section was divided in the last issue of the Journal, four and five will for the present quarter, and until completion of further arrangements, be merged in a general r\u00e9sum\u00e9, such as hitherto adopted for the Annual Report. A separate head is introduced for Obituary Notices.\nThe whole appears in the July number of the Journal.\n\nSir George Birdwood and M. Bertin spoke also on the subject. The remarks of the former, of which a written abstract was received, have been printed as an addendum to the paper.\n\nThis Meeting concluded the Session 1885\u201386. At its close the Society adjourned to November next. Monday, the 15th of that month, has been since fixed as the date for resuming the Proceedings.\n\nII. PROCEEDINGS OF ASIATIC OR ORIENTAL SOCIETIES.\u00b9\n\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, 6th January, 1886.\u2014D. Waldie, Esq., Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nNine presentations were announced, and four elections of Ordinary Members, with two withdrawals, notified.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read reports on four finds of ancient coins, i.e.:\u2014\n\n1. On fifteen old silver coins forwarded by the Deputy-Commissioner of the Jhelum District.\n2. On thirteen silver coins from the Collector of Bhagalp\u00far.\n3. On fifteen silver coins from the Secretary to the Government N.W. Provinces and Oudh.\n4. On twenty old coins and two rings from the Subdivisional Officer of Sasser\u00e1m.\n\nA circular was read from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Physique et d\u2019Histoire Naturelle de Gen\u00e8ve, offering for competition a prize of 500 francs, for the best monograph of a genus or family of plants, to be written either in Latin, French, German, English, or Italian.\n\nThe papers read were on Natural History and Botany.\n\n3rd February, 1886 (Annual Meeting).\u2014Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1l\u00e1 Mitra, C.I.E., President, in the chair.\n\nOn the call of the President, the Secretary read the Annual Report.\n\nThe Report having been read and adopted, the President delivered his Address, proposing, in conclusion, a vote of thanks to the Hon. Secretaries and Hon. Treasurer for their exertions on behalf of the Society.\n\nThe President then announced the result of Office-bearers and Members of Council as reported by the Scrutineers; Auditors were appointed to examine the past year\u2019s accounts, and the Meeting was resolved into the Ordinary Monthly General Meeting:\u2014\n\nE. F. T. Atkinson, Esq., B.A., C.S., the newly-appointed President, in the chair.\n\n\u00b9 Under this head are necessarily comprised the Reports received during the quarter, rather than the Proceedings of that particular quarter.\nSixteen presentations were announced; three candidates for election proposed, and a letter was read from Mr. Percival accepting the office of Hon. General Secretary. A Government notification, containing Revised Rules for the working of the Indian Treasure Trove Act, was read and recorded.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read a report on sixty old copper coins received from the Secretary to the Government N.W. Provinces and Oudh, of which thirteen were of Sultan Shir Shah, nineteen of Sultan Islam Shah, five of Sultan Muhammad Shah, sixteen of Akbar, and seven of the Sultans of Gujrat. A communication was also read from the Private Secretary to H.H. the Maharan\u00e1 of Udaipur forwarding two ancient coins with descriptive note.\n\nDr. Rajendralal Mitra read an extract from Babu Nirajan Mukarji's letter forwarding impressions of inscriptions in an unknown character, or hard to decipher, taken from Hindu stone-temples at Mandi.\n\nBesides contributions in the Natural History Department, two historical papers were read at the Meeting\u2014one on the decline of the Samanis, by Mr. Oliver, and one on the Birthday of Akbar, published in the Journal and hereafter noticed.\n\n3rd March, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President, in the chair.\n\nTwenty presentations were announced; the election of three Ordinary Members and one withdrawal notified; two candidates for election proposed; and the personnel of the several Committees for the year appointed.\n\nAmong the papers read were one \"On Place-Names in Mercara,\" by Mr. R. S. Whiteway, and one \"On South Indian Coins,\" by Capt. R. B. C. Tuffnell, Madras Staff Corps. Both are to appear in the Journal.\n\nThe President imparted to the meeting a suggestion that subjects for conversation be brought forward after the disposal of the regular business of the Society; the Meeting resolving itself into a Conversation for the discussion of questions to be fixed on beforehand; those comprised in Natural History on one evening, and those relating to Philology on another, alternately.\n\n7th April, 1886.\u2014E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President, in the chair.\n\nTwenty-one presentations were announced, two Ordinary Members elected, two candidates proposed for election, and three withdrawals notified.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited two ancient copper coins received from Rai Shyam Bahadur, Vakil, Chupra, and read the following Report:\n\n1. On seventeen coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Jhelum.\n2. On eight coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Gujrat.\n3. On 104 silver coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Nimar, Central Provinces.\n4. On a gold coin from the Collector of Nuddea. This is affirmed to be one of N\u00e1ra Gupta, an ancient ruler of Bih\u00e1r and Bengal, and cannot be placed earlier than A.D. 400, if the end of the second century be accepted as the initial epoch of the rise of the earlier Gupta line.\n\n5. On thirty-two silver coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Raipur.\n\n6. On forty-one coins (rupees) from the Collector of Hooghly.\n\n7. On four copper coins from the Divisional Magistrate of Mirzap\u00far.\n\n8. On sixteen gold and 457 silver coins from the Secretary of Government N.W. Provinces and Oudh. Among others are seven gold Gupta coins from Rae Bareilly; the remaining nine gold coins are Ramtinkis, very small, from the Part\u00e1bgarh District.\n\nThe Secretary to the Geographical Society of Lyons, in forwarding a book entitled \"De l'influence des Religions sur le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique des Peuples,\" had stated that his Society would be happy if any Member of the Asiatic Society in India would undertake an analogous labour with regard to the Religions of that country. With reference hereto, the President remarked that the best response would be to announce the matter in the Proceedings.\n\nTwo papers were read: 1. \"On some Snow Measurements at Kailung in Lahoul,\" by the Rev. A. W. Heyde; 2. \"On Three New Himalayan Primulas,\" by G. King, Esq., M.B., LL.D., F.L.S.\n\nThe President, entering into particulars of the work, paid a graceful tribute to the worth and ability of the late Mr. Edward Thomas, Treasurer of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was followed by Dr. Mitra, a personal friend of the deceased, who passed a high eulogium upon his services in the cause of numismatic research. Eulogising his private character and qualities, the learned doctor remarked that those \"who were best able to appreciate his merits held him in high esteem.\"\n\nThe subject for conversation in the Philological Society's Department was \"Manikhyala, and a gold ornament made of Roman coins recently found there.\"\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, Paris, 4th May, 1886.\u2014M. Barbier de Meynard, Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nAfter the election of three new members, and ordinary business, M. Clermont-Ganneau stated to the Council particulars regarding certain Palmyrene inscriptions which had not been published.\n\nM. Oppert read the translation of a Babylonian inscription containing a marriage contract confirmed by a tribunal.\n\nM. Rubens David offered the suggestion that the two Aramaean words ardikla and aryoubla (signifying architect and mason respectively) have in their composition the word ard 'servant,' coupled in the one case with ekal for haikal (temple or palace), and in the other with gaboul (artizan).\nThe Abb\u00e9 Quentin, who had returned from the study of Assyrian inscriptions regarding the Deluge at the British Museum, gave notice that he would shortly submit to the Council the result of his researches.\n\n*Society of Biblical Archaeology, London, 1st June, 1886.*\u2014Walter Morrison, Esq., President, in the chair.\n\nAfter the ordinary routine of proceedings, Mr. F. G. Hilton Price, F.S.A., read a paper describing a number of Egyptian Antiquities in his Collection. Those on which the greater stress was laid were from Ekhmim, the site of the ancient Chemmis, on the right bank of the Nile opposite to Suh\u00e1g, where some very interesting excavations and discoveries had been made in 1885. Two sepulchral boxes of sycamore wood, with remarkable drawings and decorations; the pedestal of a figure of Ptah-Socaris-Osiris; the lid or cover of a funereal box, in sycamore wood, bearing the inscription, \"Ta poer, the wife of Pet-tum\" (as read by M. Revillout), and some masks from mummy cases, were among the articles described.\n\nThe following communications to the Society are on the record:\n\nTwo from M. P. Le Page Renouf on the name of the blind Horus and the Egyptian God Apriat; one from Professor Sayce on inscriptions at Abydos and elsewhere; one from the Rev. J. C. Ball on the Metres of David; and a second from Professor Sayce on \"Coptic and Early Christian Inscriptions in Upper Egypt.\" Besides these, Deir Abu Hannes, \"the monastery of Father John,\" with its cemetery and surroundings, has supplied the material of a most interesting paper.\n\n*American Oriental Society, 12th May, 1886.*\u2014Professor W.D. Whitney, in the chair.\n\nAfter the usual routine of Proceedings, reports were given of letters from Mr. Rockhill, in Peking. He had sent some rubbings of stone pillar inscriptions from Pan Shan, east of the capital. They date from the Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1368-1644), and many of the characters are N\u0101gari Sanskrit. Sixteen Roman coins also had been found near Peking, some of which antedated from Nero.\n\nThe following is a list of the papers read, or accepted for reading:\n\n1. On Hebrew Military History in the Light of Modern Military Science; by General Henry Carrington, U.S. Army.\n2. On a Greek Hagiologic MS. in the Philadelphia Library; by Professor J. Hall, of New York City. Of this curious relic an interesting analysis is given.\n3. On the Identification of Avaris at S\u00e1n; by Rev. W. C. Winslow, of Boston.\n4. On the Warrior Caste in India; by Professor E. W. Hopkins, of Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Penn.\n5. The Correlation of v and m in Vedic and later Sanskrit; by Prof. M. Bloomfield, of Baltimore.\n6.

Lexicographical Notes from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata; by Prof. Hopkins.\n\n14. Introduction to the Study of the Old Indian Sibilants; by Prof. Bloomfield and Dr. Edward N. Spieker, of Baltimore.\n\nIn addition to the above, spoken addresses were given by the Rev. T. P. Hughes and the Rev. John Chandler; and the Rev. W. H. Ward exhibited photographs of Hittite Sculpture from 'Ain Tab.\n\nThe Society adjourned to meet at New Haven on 27th October.\n\nIII. CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nPre-Akkadian Writing.\n\n62, Chesilton Road, Fulham Road, S.W.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n22nd Sept., 1886.\n\nI am desirous of directing your attention to the fact, that I have advocated for several years the existence of the Chaldean or Babylonian writing anterior to the arrival of the Akkadians in the country. The successive transformations undergone by the writing, chiefly in its arrangement, and the fact that the Akkadian sounds were not the most important, had forced this conclusion upon my mind. I have published this in several places, notably in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, April, 1883, Vol. XV. p. 279, note 3.\n\nIn the last issue of the Journal (Vol. XVIII. Part III.) there is a paper on the Pre-Akkadian Semites, by Mr. G. Bertin, in which no allusion has been made to the priority of my discovery.\n\nI am, yours faithfully,\n\nThe Secretary Royal Asiatic Society. Terrien de Lacouperie.\nIV. OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nThree losses to the Society by death have taken place within the quarter: two, Resident Members, one of many and one of few years' standing, the other a distinguished scholar who had been on the list of Honorary Members for four years.\n\nJohn Hallett Batten, son of the Rev. Dr. Joseph Hallett Batten, Principal of the East India College at Haileybury, and Catherine his wife, was born at Haileybury, in the county of Hertford, on 5 May, 1811. He was educated at Charterhouse, and in July, 1827, received a nomination to the Bengal Civil Service from Mr. Edward Parry, a Director of the East India Company. Shortly afterwards he entered Haileybury College, and passed out in May, 1829, having obtained a prize for an Essay, and marked as Highly Distinguished. During his career at the College he was more proficient in Classics, Law, Political Economy, and Persian, than in the other subjects which formed the curriculum of his studies.\n\nJohn Hallett Batten arrived in Bengal on 22 November, 1829, but in the following year proceeded to Europe on furlough. On his return to India he was appointed Assistant to the Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit in the Gorakhpur division, and somewhat later Assistant to the Magistrate and Collector at Azimgarh. Transferred in 1834 to the Meerut division, under the Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit, in 1835 he became Assistant to the Magistrate and Collector at Saharanpur, exercising the powers of Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector at that station in 1836; but shortly after he was transferred as Assistant to the Commissioner of Kumaon. In 1837 he was Acting Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector at Garhwal; in 1839 Senior Assistant to Commissioner, and in charge of the Revised Revenue Settlement at Kumaon; and in 1850 he was appointed Commissioner of Kumaon. Again taking furlough to Europe, he returned to duty in 1858, and in 1859 was appointed Civil and Sessions Judge of Cawnpore. In 1863 he was Commissioner of the Agra division, but retired from service in 1865, when he became an Annuitant on the Fund. He contributed papers to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and other Indian Societies. He died on July 14th, 1886, at Heavitree, Exeter, after a very short illness, aged 75. An old and esteemed Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, in the records of which his name first appears in 1856, he had visited its rooms in Albemarle Street in seeming health and vigour only a few days prior to his decease.\n\nThe name of Mr. Andrew Cassels, a much-respected member of\nthe Royal Asiatic Society, is more especially connected with Eastern interests as that of a Member of the Indian Council. After many years spent on the Continent, chiefly in Italy, Mr. Cassels went out to Bombay as partner in the great Manchester firm, Messrs. John Peel & Co., and founded the house Peel, Cassels & Co., at the head of which he remained for a considerable period. On returning from India in 1851, he continued for some years in the business in Manchester, until his retirement, when he settled in London. He became one of the Directors of the Metropolitan Railway Company, and long acted as Chairman of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, a post which he only resigned on accepting the office of Member of the Council of India, offered to him in 1874 by Lord Salisbury. At the termination of the statutory term of tenure of this office in 1884, repeated efforts were made by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and other bodies to secure his reappointment, but this was not considered expedient, as being the first vacancy after the introduction of the ten years' limit, although the value of his services was fully recognized. Mr. Cassels was an active member of the Society of Arts, in which he took great interest; he was one of their Committee appointed to aid the organization of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and was elected to their Council in 1872, and Vice-President in 1875. He died on the 2nd of August in his seventy-fifth year, and was buried in the Brompton Cemetery.\n\nProfessor B. J\u00fclg, a high authority on the Mongol-Kalmuk languages, with which he had been familiar from youth, died on the 14th August, aged 61, at Innspruck, in the University of which city he was Professor of Classical Philology. From his special connection with Tartar Fable Literature\u2014a field which cannot be said to be thoroughly occupied\u2014his loss will be felt outside his own immediate sphere of work. Only four years ago he was enrolled among the Honorary Members of this Society, a distinction accorded to his widely-spread reputation. His paper \"On the Present State of Mongolian Researches\" was published in Vol. XIV. pp. 42-65 of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nV. Excerpta Orientalia.\n\nNos. 3 and 4, vol. liv. part 1, of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, consist of two papers only, Mr. Growse's \"Notes on the Fatehpur District, N.W.P.,\" and part 2 of the \"Geography of India in the reign of Akbar,\" by Mr. Beames. No. 1 of the\nForty-fifth volume, part 1, besides a Numismatic notice, has a learned and well-reasoned article on the \"Antiquity and Genuineness of the Epic called the Prithi R\u00e1j R\u00e1s\u00e1,\" commonly ascribed to \"Chand Bardai,\" from the pen of Kavi R\u00e1j Shy\u00e1mal D\u00e1s, M.R.A.S., Poet-Laureate, and Member of the State Council of Mewar; some \"Notes on the Chittagong Dialect,\" by Mr. F. E. Pargiter, B.A.; and a second article of Mr. Shy\u00e1mal D\u00e1s, on the \"Birthday of the Emperor Jal\u00e1luddin Muhammad Akbar,\" which quaintly, but not inconclusively, changes the generally received date of Akbar's birth from the 16th October to the 23rd November, 1542. While the \"Poet-Laureate\" is shown to be contributor of four-fifths of this whole number of the Journal, it is explained that his original papers were in Hindi, and that Munshi R\u00e1m Pars\u00e1d is responsible for the English translation.\n\nThe following new numbers of the Bibliotheca Indica have been received:\n\nSanskrit.\u2014Par\u00e1sara Smr\u00edti, by Pandit Chandrak\u00e1nta Tark\u00e1-lank\u00e1ra, fasciculus v.\n\nThe Nirukta with Commentaries, edited by Pandit Satyavrata S\u00e1m\u00e1sram\u00ed, vol. iii. fasc. iv.\n\nTattva Chint\u00e1mani, ed.

Maulawi Muhammad Ilahd\u00e1d, vol. i. fasc. iv.\n\nJournal Asi\u00e9tique, Huiti\u00e8me s\u00e9rie, tome vii. No. 2, Mars-Avril, 1866, contains the following articles: L'Histoire de Gal'ad et Schim\u00e1s, by M. H. Zotenberg; Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musalmanes, by M. H. Sauvaire; La Brhatakath\u00e1ma\u00f1jar\u00ed de Kshemendra, continuation and conclusion, by M. J. Sylvain-L\u00e9vi; and Tchao-sien-tch\u00e9, being a memoir on the Corea by a Corean (anonymous), translated for the first time from the Chinese, with commentary, by M. Scherzer. In the \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes\" are a review of Prince Muhammad Salih's Uzbek poem of the Shaibaniad, translated into German by Professor Vamb\u00e9ry; a notice of the Imitatio Christi, as rendered from Latin into Chald\u00e6an, and other papers. No. 3 of the same volume, Mai-Juin, 1886, contains an article on Shafi'a Asar, a Persian satirical poet who flourished at the close of the seventeenth century, by M. H. Fert\u00e9, dragoman of the French Embassy at Constantinople; a continuation of M. Sauvaire's materials for a history of Muhamadan Numismatics and Metrology; a translation by Professor M. C. de Harlez of the last book of the Aisin Gurun-i-Sudur\u00e9 Bithe, forming an appendix to the history of the Empire of Kiu, and written at the period of the Conquest of China by the Mandchus; and the second part of M. Senart's 4th chapter\non the Inscriptions of Piyad\u00e1si. The contents of the \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes\" have been reported in the notice of Proceedings.\n\n*German Oriental Society*, vol. xi. part 2, contains: M. Klamroth, on the Extracts from Greek writers in Al-Yak\u00fab\u00ed; M. Gr\u00fcnbaum, Observations on the Shem Hammaphorash as an Imitation of an Aramaic Expression, and on Linguistic Imitations in general; Spitta's Arabic Manuscripts; N. Karamianz, Twenty-one letters of a lost Alphabet; H. H. Dhruva, Sanskrit Grants and Inscriptions of Gujrat Kings, Nos. vi. to ix.; Hermann Jacobi, On the knowledge of Asia; E. Hultsch, Corrections and Additions to the Amravati Inscriptions; P. von Bradke, Contributions to the History of Religions and Languages of Ancient India; and Extracts from Dr. Snouck Hurgronje's letters in Leyden, to Dr. Goldziher in Budapest.\n\n**Archaeology.**\u2014An account of the American Archaeological Expedition to Mesopotamia forms the subject of an abstract of two lectures recently delivered by Dr. Hayes Ward of New York, quoted in the *Academy*, 12th June from the Johns Hopkins University Circulars. The Hittite Centres of Marash and Jarablus were the first points visited; afterwards Mosul, Baghdad, and other well-known modern towns in the vicinity of Biblical or historically-interesting sites. In the opinion of the lecturer there are still mounds, at or near Babylon, which ought to be carefully worked; and Warka, second only to Babylon in extent, promises exceptional fruitfulness in antiquities. We learn also from the *Academy* of the 3rd July, that Professor Tiele has republished from the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Holland, his paper on \"The principal Temples of Babylon and its Suburb Borsippa, according to the Inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar.\" In it he shows conclusively \"that the great temple of Bel Merodach called E-Sagila contained the Babylonian E-Zida or temple of Nebo, and was not separate from it... The original E-Zida was at Borsippa, and is now represented by the well-known ruins termed by the natives Birs-i-Nimrud, in whose vitrified bricks many scholars have seen the remains of the Tower of Babel.\"\n\nM. Dieulafoy's Excavations in Susiana are again noticed in the *Academy* of the 24th July. These had been lately directed to opening the foundations of a palace more ancient than that of Artaxerxes Mnemon, as also to fresh discoveries on the site of Apadana. Many objects of interest had been obtained and brought to the Louvre, the work having been stimulated by the Shah's abandonment of claims to half the collection, as stipulated under the terms of the original Farm\u00e1n.\n\nIn the *Indian Antiquary* for June we have \"Pride Abased,\" a Kashmiri Tale, which the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles had heard from a Br\u00e1hman named Mukund B\u00e2y\u00fb of Srinagar; the \"Last years of Shah Shuja'a, with an Appendix on the Affairs of Hirat,\" an interesting translation made by Mr. Rehatsek from the T\u00e1rikh Sult\u00e1n\u00ed of Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1r\u00e1zk\u00e1i: a short contribution to his Folk-Lore in Western India by Mr. Putlibai D. H. Wadia:\n\" Mudyanur Plates of Saka 261 of the Bana king Malladeva Nandivarman,\" by Lewis Rice, C.I.E.: a continuation of Mrs. Grierson's Gipsy Index: and \"Indragonim and other Grammarians,\" with the \"Chandra Vyakarana and Kasika-Vritta,\" two articles by Professor Kielhorn. An announcement by Mr. V. A. Smith that he is preparing a full analytical Index to Gen. Cunningham's Archaeological Reports, which will be published in a separate volume by the Government of India; and three contributions by Mr. Fleet, one, a note on the coins of the Hindu Kings of Kabul; one, the description of a new Grant of Dharasena II. of Valabhi, and one an extract from the Acharatika:\u2014these constitute the Miscellanea of the month. The July number is remarkable for Mr. Fleet's papers on the \"Epoch of the Gupta Era\" and \"Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions;\" succeeding which are Mr. Hultzsch's observations on a Gwalior Inscription of Vikrama Samvat 1161, and Professor Kielhorn's notes on the Mahabhashya. In the Miscellanea are reviews of Gen. Cunningham's Book of Indian Eras; Dr. Solf's \"Die Kashmir-Recension des Pancacika;\" the Taprobanian, a Dravidian Journal of local research published in Ceylon; Prof. Robertson Smith's \"Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia;\" and the History of Nepal, translated by Munshi Sheo Shankar Singh and Pandit Sri Gunanand, and edited by Daniel Wright, M.D.; Dr. Hughes' Dictionary of Islam; Mr. T. G. Scott's Burma; the English translation of the Mahabharata; and a reprint of Vol. I. Asiatic Researches. To the August number of the Indian Antiquary, Mr. Murray-Aynsley contributes No. VI. of his \"Discursive Contributions towards the comparative study of Asiatic Symbolism,\" treating of Sacred Trees; Mr. Patlibai Wadia adds a new story to his illustrations of Folk-Lore in Western India; Mr. Fleet brings out the extreme importance of his sixth-century Mandasor Inscription of Yasodharman and Vishnuvardhana, supplying the text in Roman characters and a facsimile of the original; Professor Kielhorn continues his notes on the Mahabhashya; Sir Walter Elliot communicates a further notice of the Ancient Buddhist Structure at Negapatam; and Mrs. Grierson's Gipsy-Index is carried on to the word \"Red.\" Of the two letters headed \"Miscellanea,\" Mr. Fleet's will be noticed later on under \"Epigraphy\"; the other signed G. M. C. objects to a passage in the preface of Dr. Petersen's edition of the Subhashitavali of Vallabhadeva, on which no more need be said than that one of the two able Editors of the Indian Antiquary then on the spot, concurs in the objection. As to the book itself, Dr. B\u00fchler writes that Dr. Petersen \"has now given us, in conjunction with Pandit Durgaprasada of Jaipur, an edition which certainly will be most useful, nay indispensable to every Sanskritist, both for the critical restoration of many classical texts, and for the study of the history of classical poetry.\"\n\nOn June 22nd, 1865, was held the first public meeting for establishing the Palestine Exploration Fund,\u2014and on the same date thi\nyear the meeting to celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of that institution\u2014His Grace the Archbishop of York being the Chairman on both occasions. The work done has been succinctly described in a neat, illustrated volume published by the Committee. There are three objects shown to press urgently for accomplishment at the present time, i.e. the Recovery of the Second Wall of Jerusalem; an Inquiry into the manners and customs of the people residing in and about the Holy Land; and the publication of Capt. Conder's Survey of Eastern Palestine, Le Compte's drawings made for M. Clermont-Ganneau's Archaeological Mission, Hart's Natural History Memoir, and Schumacher's Second Survey. It is to be hoped that Funds will not be wanting for so worthy a purpose. The Quarterly Statement for July contains brief but interesting papers by Professor Hayter Lewis, Capt. Conder, Mr. William Simpson, Mr. Weld, Professor Hull, the Rev. E. Flecker, the Rev. W. F. Birch, and M. Schick. Four of these are of a controversial character, but controversy is not only natural but desirable in questions of archaeological identification. Mr. Simpson, writing on \"Stone doors,\" refers to one at Lasgird (or Lasjird) in Persia, which \"wrought on pivots the same as the doors of Bashan,\" and is the only entrance to the village within the circular wall. Much might be written on this remarkable place, of which some rough idea has been given by Dr. Bellew in his sketch at p. 404, \"From the Indus to the Tigris.\" The derivation of its name from the circle \"traced on the ground by Las or Last, the son of Noah,\" is one of those many local interpretations more readily supplied than logically supported throughout the length and breadth of the Shah's dominions. There is a review of Professor Hull's Survey of Western Palestine in the Athen\u00e6um of June 12.\n\nIn the Academy of August 7, Mr. James Burgess gives an account of his recent visit to Sri Sailam, or Sri Parvata, an old Hindu shrine dedicated to Mallikarjuna (a form of Siva) on the Nallamalla, or black mountains, about 80 miles lower down the Krishna river than Karnul. This is supposed to be built on the site of the Pigeon or Black Peak Monastery mentioned by Fa-Hian and Hiouen-Thsang in Southern India, \"founded for the Buddhists, and where N\u00e2g\u00e2rjuna died, but which was afterwards seized on by the Brahmins.\"\n\nSemitic Literature: Hebrew and Chaldee.\u2014We learn from the Academy of the 12th June that \"Outlines of Jewish History from the Babylonian Captivity to the Present Time,\" is the title of a work by Mrs. Philip Magnus, then nearly ready for publication.\n\nDuring the forthcoming season, at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Haupt, Professor of Semitic, proposes to lecture on the Critical Interpretation of Selected Psalms, on Hebrew Exercises, and reading unpointed texts at sight, and on Biblical Aramaean Grammar and the Chaldee Poetry of Daniel.\n\nSyriac.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of the 5th July adverts to Dr. Isaac H. Hall's reproductions of the Syrian Antilegomena Epistles from a MS. of 1471, brought to America from Mardin by the late Rev. William F. Williams, then a missionary at that place. The text, of\nwhich facsimiles are given, is accurate and carefully written, and will be of use for a new edition of the Antilegomena. The same paper reports the success of M. Isidore Loeb in introducing, by means of his Tables du Calendrier Juif depuis l'\u00e8re Chr\u00e9tienne jusqu'au xxxx Si\u00e8cle, a less complicated method for commuting Christian into Jewish dates, and vice versa. It notices also Dr. W\u00fcnsche's translation of the Agadic passages in the Babylonian Talmud, regretting that, however useful the work is in some respects, the translator does not quite steer clear of error.\n\nIn the Literatur-Blatt, vol. iii. part 1, Herr A. M\u00fcller lengthily criticizes the Praktische Methode zur Erlernung der Hebraischen Sprache, a grammar with exercises, anthology, and vocabulary for schools and students in theology, by H. Kihn and D. Schilling.\n\nThe Academy of August 14th contains a review, by Professor Cheyne, of Mr. Philip Wicksteed's translation of Kuennen's \"Historico-Critical Inquiry into the origin and composition of the Hexateuch,\" i.e. the Pentateuch and Book of Joshua. Among the many interesting details of the volume, the reviewer calls attention to the \"treatment of passages of Genesis with Assyrio-Babylonian affinities.\"\n\nEthiopic.\u2014Herr F. Pr\u00e4torius notices in the Literatur-Blatt the Mashafa temqat. Liturgie zum Tauf-Fest der Aethiopischen Kirche. Inaugural-Dissertation . . . . von Carl von Ainhard (Munich).\n\nAmong new publications may be mentioned:\n\nNeubauer (A.), Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in the Bodleian Library and College Libraries of Oxford (described by Dr. M. Friedlander in the Academy of Aug. 28, as possessing \"all the qualities to make the work as perfect as possible\"). Hoffmann (G.), Syrisch-Arabische Glossen, vol. i. Levy (J.), Neuhebraisches in Chalda\u00efsches W\u00f6rterbuch \u00fcber die Talmud im u Midraschim. Hoffmann (G.), Opuscula Nestoriana, Syriac ed. Wright (C. H. H.), Biblical Essays; or Exegetical Studies on the Books of Job, Jonah, Ezekiel's Prophecy to Gog and Magog, St. Peter's \"Spirits in Prison,\" and the Key to the Apocalypse. Vos (Gerhardus), The Mosaic Origin of the Pentateuchal Codes. Lloyd (Rev. J.), The Book of Joshua; a critical and expository commentary.\n\nAssyriology.\u2014Among lectures to be delivered this coming season at the Johns Hopkins University, by Dr. Haupt, Professor of Semitic Languages, and not above specified, are two on Assyrian, one for beginners and the other for advanced students.\n\nNo. iv. of the Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale contains a long and elaborate paper by M. Oppert, on the Assyrian Measures of Capacity and Superficies; and a second contribution by the same writer on the Non-identity of Phul and Teglatphalasar (sic). The last relates to the evidence borne to Assyrian history by the texts which Mr. Pinches found in the British Museum; but M. Oppert cannot unreservedly accept all that gentleman's conclusions upon this discovery.\n\nAccording to the Athen\u00e6um of the 4th Sept., the Religious Tract\nSociety are about to issue a second edition of Mr. Walter Budge's Babylonian Life and History; and Mr. S. A. Smith, an American Assyriologist, has made arrangements with a continental publisher for a new work on the texts of Assurbanipal, the annals of that king by the late Mr. George Smith being out of print.\n\nArabic.\u2014Attention is drawn in the Athen\u00e6um of the 21st, and Academy of the 28th August, to the publication of an English-Arabic Vocabulary, compiled by Major G. S. Plunkett, R.E., and already found of great practical utility in manuscript. It is said to contain 3600 words of the common Cairo-spoken dialect. A grammar of Colloquial Arabic has, moreover, been lately published in Germany. It is advertised as Sabb\u00e2g\u2019s (M\u012bh\u0101\u2019il) Grammatik der Arabischen Umgangssprache hrg. v. H. Thorbecke. The Athen\u00e6um of August 28th also states that nine out of ten volumes of Burton\u2019s translation of the Thousand and One Nights have been issued to the Kama Shastra Society. Five further volumes are now offered for subscription, the first and second having the \u2018terminal\u2019 stories of the Breslau edition. Vol. iii. will comprise the selection of tales in vol. vi. of Dr. Jonathan Scott\u2019s Arabian Nights, and vols. iv. and v. will contain Galland\u2019s ten most popular tales not yet traced to an Arabic source. These, for the sake of uniformity, will be turned first into Arabic, then retranslated into English. A book which has made its mark, and may here be appropriately mentioned, is Professor Robertson Smith\u2019s \u201cKinship and Marriage in Early Arabia.\u201d Among other reviews of it there is one in the Athen\u00e6um of the 17th July, and another in the last-received number of the Literatur-Blatt f\u00fcr Orientalische Philologie. The Athen\u00e6um of the 24th July writes of Mr. Arthur Wollaston\u2019s Half Hours with Muhammad that \u201cit contains a great deal of solid reading in a small but substantial volume.\u201d\n\nVon Kremer\u2019s few pages, entitled Lexikographische Notizen nach Neuere Arabischen Quellen, will interest Arabic scholars, many of whom may have words to add to the collection.\n\nDr. G. P. Badger\u2014than whom few Arabic scholars are better qualified for the somewhat ungracious office of literary criticism\u2014has reviewed, in the Academy of August 21, vols. ii. and iii. of the Rev. G. M. Wherry\u2019s Comprehensive Commentary on the Qur\u00e1n. His assurance that \u201ca translation of the al-Kur\u00e1n which shall preserve the ideas and brilliant imagery, the verve and musical cadence of the original, is still among the desiderata of English Orientalists,\u201d should arouse the ambition of some of our rising Arabicists. Did two combine\u2014the one a thorough scholar, the other an experienced litt\u00e9rateur and Orientalist\u2014the goal might be attained. In the meanwhile, the reading public must be thankful for Sale, and those to whom Dr. Badger refers as having improved upon certain of his renderings.\n\nAryan Languages.\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014The \u201cDharmasamgraha,\u201d adverted to in July as ready for publication, has been reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 21st August, and is pronounced a more solid contribution to the study of Buddhism than those contained in the\nthree previous numbers of the Aryan Series of the \"Anecdota Oxoniensia.\" A passing tribute is paid to the memory of the original editor, the late Kenjiu Kasawara, whose \"quiet zeal\" and \"patient industry\" are qualities not always recognized by the outer world. We are informed in the same issue that M. P. Regnaud, Professor of Sanskrit in the Facult\u00e9 des Lettres at Lyons, author of works on Sanskrit rhetoric, has just brought out with E. Leroux a volume of Essais de Linguistique Evolutionniste.\n\nAccording to the Academy of June 12, Messrs. Warne and Co. are preparing 250 copies of a new edition, on large paper, of the Fables of Pilpay, recently issued in the Chandos Classics; and Professor Oldenberg has contributed a learned essay on the study of Sanskrit to the June number of the Deutsche Rundschau. The same paper states that at a late meeting of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, M. Bergaigne read a paper upon \"The order of the Hymns in the Rig-Veda.\" The subject has already been treated by Mr. Frederic Pincott, in an article which appeared in the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal so far back as July, 1884.\n\nThe fifth volume of Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Royal Library at Berlin has been received for the Society's Library; it contains the second volume of Weber's Catalogue of Sanskrit-Pr\u0101krit MSS., and is admirably printed and arranged.\n\nIn the Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, of which an abstract has been above recorded, it is worthy of note that no less than six important papers bear more or less directly on Sanskrit studies. One by Professor Bloomfield on Three Hymns of the First Book of the Atharva-Veda, quotes translations by Weber, Zimmer and Ludwig. The new edition of this work \"von Sankar P. Pandit\" is noticed by B\u00fchler in the Oesterreichische Monatsschrift for July.\n\nProfessor B\u00fchler's new translation of the \"Laws of Manu,\" and Professor Oldenberg's Grihya-Sutras (describing the domestic ceremonies of the Brahmans), are stated by the Athen\u00e6um to be forthcoming in the current year's Sacred Books of the East.\n\nP\u0101li.\u2014The continuation of the translation, by Professors Rhys Davids and Hermann Oldenberg, of the Vinaya Texts, contained in vol. xx. \"Sacred Books of the East,\" \"will confer,\" according to the reviewer in the Athen\u00e6um of August 21, \"a valuable boon on those who are desirous of realizing from an English version something of the inner life of the earlier Buddhism.\" The first of the chapters now given treats of the settlement of disputes in the fraternity of monks; elsewhere is treated the matter of dress and daily routine, and there is a chapter dealing with the duties of the bhikkhun\u012bs or nuns.\n\nPr\u0101krit.\u2014There is a thoughtful review in the Athen\u00e6um of the 10th July of Vol. xxii. of the Sacred Books of the East, the publication of which was notified in our last issue. Professor Jacobi's learned introduction to the Ak\u0101r\u0101nga Sutra\u2014or 'Ayaramga,' as the reviewer holds it to be, in that form of Pr\u0101krit constituting the distinctly sacred language of the sect to which it relates\u2014is\ncommended to the reader's careful consideration; and of the contents of the two works translated he says \"the literature is at least fresh to the Western world.\" The Kalpa Sutra had indeed appeared in English nearly forty years ago, but the version then made is referred to as inaccurate, nor is it easily procured.\n\nAmong recently published works in Sanskrit (or therewith connected), which have not been yet enumerated, may be mentioned:\n\nC. Wilkins, Fables and Proverbs from Hitopadesa (Routledge). Hemacandra's Ling\u0101nu\u00e7\u0101sana \u00fcb. und hrg. v. O. Franke. Capeller (C.), Sanskrit W\u00f6rterbuch part 1. Jacobi (H.), Erz\u00e4hlungen in Mah\u0101r\u0101shtri. Rev. B. Hale Wortham, The Satakas of Bhartrihari, one of many graceful renderings into English by the same author from the original Sanskrit. Haag (F.), Beitr\u00e4ge zum Verst\u00e4ndniss v. Vic\u0101dhatta's Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63a. L\u00e9vi (S.), La Brihatkathamanjari de Kshemendra (Paris, Leroux\u2014noticed in the Journal Asiatique for November last).\n\nPahlavi.\u2014Among recent Leipzig (Harrasowitz) publications in this tongue we note, in the Athenaeum of June 12, the lengthy Ganjeshaya-gan, Andarze Atrep\u0101t M\u0101r\u0101spand\u0101n, M\u0101d\u012bg\u0101ne Chat-rang, and Andarze Khusroe Kavat\u0101n, by P. D. B. Sanjana.\n\nPersian.\u2014In the Academy of 5th June, mention is made of a portrait, skilfully etched by Mr. Costello, of Mr. Edward Fitzgerald, translator of Umar Khayy\u0101m. The term \"translator\" must not be accepted in its conventional sense as regards this gentleman's treatment of his favourite Persian poet, whose ideas he grasped and rendered into English verse with marvellous skill and appreciation\u2014playing variations, as it were, on his theme, at each call for a new edition. A later Academy of the 14th August has a new and pleasant version of one of Umar's \"Rub\u0101'iy\u0101t,\" by Mr. C. J. Pickering; and in the number of the 21st idem, we learn that M. Vedder's illustrations to the complete set of the poet's quatrains will be issued during the current year.\n\nThe third volume of the Collections Scientifiques de l'Institut des Langues Orientales du Minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00c9trang\u00e8res has just been issued at St. Petersburg. It is a Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts, with lengthy and instructive extracts from the more rare or important. Russia has done wisely in thus encouraging by direct Government aid the study of Oriental tongues; and it is pleasant to see a title-page proclaiming that her Foreign Office, under the orders and at the cost of its Asiatic Department, performs functions which, in England, are assigned to the Trustees of the British Museum. The Baron Rosen divides his work very much in the same way as Dr. Rieu, to the merits of whose \"ouvrage classique\" and to the direct bearing of which upon his own labours he pays a graceful tribute at the outset. To cover the whole ground of classification, he takes the twenty heads of Th\u00e9ologie des Babys, Histoire, Cosmographie et G\u00e9ographie, Insh\u00e0, Biographie des Po\u00e8tes, Po\u00e9sie et Belles Lettres, M\u00e9trique et Prosodie, Prose Orn\u00e9e, Fables et Contes, \u00c9thique et Politique, Coufisme, C\u00e9r\u00e9monies Religieuses, M\u0153urs et Coutumes, Lexicographie et Grammaire, Astronomie,\nM\u00e9decine, Hippologie, Art de tirer de l\u2019Arc, Trait\u00e9 sur la Physionomie, and Calligraphie et Peinture. Practically, however, the 1st, 2nd and 6th of these comprise the bulk of the collection, for they occupy 255 pages out of 324, History and Poetry alone requiring more than 200. The Preface calls attention to two B\u00e1bi MSS., which, from the extracts given, must be greatly interesting: they are unique of their kind, and form, indeed, the whole collection comprehended under the first of the heads above recapitulated. Other manuscripts specially noted are the following:\n\n1. The Majmal-i-Fasihi, by Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Yahya Fa\u1e63ih al Khu\u0101fi; of which specimens are said to be very rare.\n\n2. Tarikh-i-Mir Saiyid Sharif Rakim: a collection of chronograms on the History of Central Asia, with explanations.\n\n3. One without a title, being a collection of documents, diplomas, letters and fragments of letters, of which the chief writer appears to have been a certain Muntajabu\u2019d-din Bad\u2018i, employed in the chancellories of the Saljuki Sult\u00e1n Sanjar bin Malik Shah (513-552). Some are of more recent date, but the Baron has no hesitation in attributing the manuscript to the eighth century (Hijra). His analysis and extracts are interesting and provocative of further research.\n\n4. Ikhtiy\u0101r\u0101t-i-Muzaffar\u012b by Mahm\u016bd bin Mas\u2018aud-ush-Shir\u0101zi, known as Kutbu\u2019d-din Shir\u0101zi, and mentioned at page 434, vol. ii. of Dr. Rieu\u2019s catalogue, in a notice of his \u201cDurratu\u2019t-T\u0101j.\u201d While the latter work, however, is described as an \u201cencyclopaedia of philosophical sciences,\u201d the one under consideration is said to have been composed in compliance with a request of the Wazir Muzaffar\u016b\u2019d-din for a short manual of astronomy in the Persian language.\n\nSome are cited for their calligraphy, and some for antiquity. One is rightly judged to have a very high value. It is the \u201cKulliy\u0101t\u201d or complete poetical works of J\u0101mi, supposed to be in his own handwriting. The careful analysis of this manuscript may be commended to the Persian student. As an example of the testimony to genuineness, the words at the close of the second book of the \u201cSilsilatu\u2019z-Zahb\u201d or Golden Chain, are here repeated:\n\n\u0631\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u0646\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0630\u0629\u064b \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0642\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u0639\u064e\u0641\u0652\u064a\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\n\nThese are written in one line at the end, and exactly filling up the space of the two centre columns of the page, while outside the ornamental lines are in red ink,\n\n\u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u064a \u0639\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0630\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650 \u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064f 89\n\nthat is to say, \u201cthe writer of this book is its composer, and he is the poor man, \u2018Abdu\u2019r Rahman J\u0101mi: may he be pardoned! 11th Zil Hajj, year 89.\u201d The date may reasonably be inferred to be 889, or about the end of A.D. 1484, some nine years before the poet\u2019s death.\n\nIn reviewing the above catalogue in the Oesterreichische Monatschrift for August, M. Houtsma remarks that although the collection cannot compare numerically with that of the Oriental MSS. in\nthe Imperial Public Library and Asiatic Museum, it fairly holds its own when the intrinsic value of its Persian MSS. is considered. He does not see that it has gained much from Russia's connection with Central Asia, with the exception, perhaps, of the B\u00e1b\u00ed contributions and Seljuki records. It has helped to make us acquainted with certain masterpieces of Persian calligraphists; and he considers that thanks are due to the Russian Government, and especially to Herr Gamazoff, for enabling the compiler of the catalogue to supply many interesting details on questions worthy of research.\n\n\"Oriental Penmanship: specimens of Persian Handwriting,\" by the late Professor Palmer, and edited by Mr. Frederic Pinocott, is favourably noticed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 31st July. According to the reviewer, \"the book will prove an undoubted boon to the student, and cannot fail to be appreciated by the many who need its practical teaching.\" It is illustrated with facsimiles from original specimens in the South Kensington Museum.\n\nWhile on the subject of Persian literature, a word must be said in favour of the new edition of Atkinson's translation of the Sh\u00e1h-n\u00e1meh printed by the Oriental Fund in 1832, and now brought out in the Chandos Classics by the Rev. J. A. Atkinson, M.A., son of the translator. So cheap and excellent a reprint of so notable a work should command an exceptionally large circulation.\n\nBarb (H. A.), Transcriptions, Grammatik der Persischen Sprache, is in the Athen\u00e6um's List of New Books.\n\nIndia.\u2014Under this head there is little relating to any special language or dialect to be reported. Among general items, the following may be noticed:\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of the 19th June reviews the \"Local Muhammadan Dynasties\u2014Gujar\u00e1t,\" by the late Sir E. C. Bayley, a work partially based on a translation by the late Professor Dowson. On the 26th id. it passes a favourable judgment on the Memorials of the Life and Letters of Sir Herbert Edwardes, a biography of unquestionable interest; and notices Mr. MacRitchie's Accounts of the Gypsies of India, a book which, it is alleged, is more successful in its treatment of the European than Asiatic members of the tribe. In the same number is a justly-accorded meed of approval for Capt. R. C. Temple's second volume of Legends of the Panj\u00e1b, and \"the industry and conscientious care\" with which its contents have been prepared. The Athen\u00e6um of the 3rd July says of Col. Yule's Glossary of Anglo-Indian words, that the author has \"added another important work to those classical productions of his, 'Ser Marco Polo,' and 'Cathay and the Way Thither';\" and of Mr. Edwin Arnold's India Revisited, that \"it contains a series of glowing word-pictures, suited alike to the subject and to the writer himself.\" In the issue of the 21st August, it notifies the proposed change of title for Capt. Temple's Panj\u00e1b Notes and Queries, which are to be known from the current month (October) under the more comprehensive name of Indian Notes and Queries. On the 28th idem it reviews Mr. Talboys Wheeler's India under British Rule, saying of the author that, \"In his estimates of men\nand events, he is always shrewd and seldom glaringly one-sided;\" and it informs its readers that a collection of Indian Folk-Tales, by the Rev. Charles Swynnerton, about to be published by Mr. Elliot Stock, is said to contain many stories derived from oral recitation by natives, and illustrations by native artists. The Academy of the 26th June notices the revised edition of Thornton's Gazetteer, edited by Sir Roper Lethbridge and Mr. Arthur Wollaston. On the 24th July it reviews Selections from the Letters, Despatches and other State Papers preserved in the Bombay Secretariat, remarking of the Marathi Series, vol. i. that there is \"hardly a misprint noticeable in the whole volume.\"\n\nDravidian Languages.\u2014Tamil, Telugu.\u2014Captain Temple has given in the Book Notices of the Indian Antiquary for August an instructive account of the Sacred Kurral of Tiruvalluvah Narayanah, which Dr. Pope is about to publish in the form of \"a carefully revised text, accompanied with a metrical version in English, a grammatical excursus, and a complete lexicon and concordance.\"\n\nCalcutta Review.\u2014The July number of this publication has eleven original articles, independently of the usual monthly notices and summaries. These are: 1. The Russians in Oriental Literature, by Colonel F. H. Tyrrell, a suggestive paper, dealing with a subject which has never, perhaps, been exhaustively treated, but which merits attention. Col. Wilberforce Clarke's careful translation of Niz\u00e1mi's great poem has not cleared up the mystery of the 'Kintal' and the 'Purt\u00e1s,' apparently the sovereign and allies of Russia. 2. An Indian Reformer, by H. G. Keene, C.S., describes the career and services of Saiyid Ahmad, shown to be a trained Muslim lawyer, an orthodox follower of the Kur\u00e1n, a student of the Bible, and withal an experienced administrator of Anglo-Indian law. 3. Buddha as a Moralist, by Ram Chandra Bose, bears the mark of ability, but is somewhat disfigured by 'tall' couplings of words. Of Nos. 4, 5, 6, and 7, the first is historical, the second administrative, and the last two are decidedly light reading. 8. Dr. Cust's Races Religions, and Languages of India, as disclosed by the Census of 1881, is not only remarkable as an instructive paper, but as the fortieth annual contribution to the Calcutta Journal from the same practised and industrious hand. 9, 10, and 11 come hardly within the ordinary province of the Royal Asiatic Society, although the versification of the last has been exercised on an Oriental theme.\n\nAmong English books reviewed are \"Our Administration of India,\" by Mr. H. A. D. Phillips, B.C.S., heartily recommended \"to old and young Quai Hais and the English reading public;\" Mr. J. G. Scott's \"Burma; as it was, as it is, and as it will be;\" Mr. James Gray's \"Ancient Proverbs and Maxims from Burmese Sources, or the Niti Literature of Burma\"\u2014a volume of Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series, in which the author appears to the reviewer \"to have performed his work of translation and annotation with great care and judgment\"; vol. xxvi. of the Sacred Books of the East, noticed in our last Journal, containing Mr. Julius Eggeling's version of the third and fourth books, Satapatha Brahmana, \"an important\nwork,\" which \"will have a deep interest for Oriental scholars;\" and the Rev. Hale Wortham's \"Satakas of Bhartrihari,\" said to be \"well worth translation,\" and to have been \"admirably translated.\"\n\nUnder Vernacular Literature are four books: 1. Ary\u0101nari G\u0101th\u0101, by Megnath Bhattacharya, B.A. (People's Press, Calcutta). Stories of great Indian women, Rajput, Mahratta and Bangali, illustrative of rare female virtues, \"related in simple and artless verse,\" described, moreover, as \"the highest and most precious of all kinds of poetry,\u2014the poetry of life and the poetry of action.\" 2. Usha-charit, by Dinanath Dhar (Girish Press, Dacca). Ostensibly the memoir of a child who died in his fifteenth year, but in reality a picture of the father who wrote the memoir. \"The book has some interest for the general public... in connection with the sad story of the child, and the sadder story of its unfortunate parents.\" 3. Debatattwa, by Kishorilal Raya (Gupta Press, Calcutta). This is explained to be an attempt at a \"rationalistic exposition\" of Hindu Mythology. 4. Kanakanjali, by Akshaya Kumar Baral (Bijnaur Press, Calcutta). The critic, after dispensing censure and praise, thus concludes his notice: \"Babu Akshaya Kumar possesses the true poetic vein, and his work contains much true poetry. If we have spoken more of the faults than of the merits of his poetry, it is because we feel proud of him as a young Bengali poet, and therefore desire to see his poetry become more perfect. His merits are already too well known and appreciated to require laudation from us.\"\n\nBurmese.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of September 4 informs its readers that in the first batch of 1200 palm-leaf books, forming the Royal Library of Mandalay, now on its way to England, are five volumes of a Burmese work entitled \"Po-tay-kay Ya-za-win,\" or a history of the Portuguese in Burma. It gives an amusing picture of the struggle for ascendancy between that nation and the Spaniards, Dutch, French, and English respectively.\n\nPanjab Notes and Queries for July has an interesting account of a singular local belief among the Burmese that the day of birth affects the name and life of the individual. It contains also a long paragraph under the head of Burmese Wise-men and Doctors; one on the Burmese calendar of luck; one on Burmese metal work; and one on Paper-making in Burma.\n\nChinese.\u2014Dr. Legge's Texts of Confucianism (before mentioned among the Sacred Books of the East) are favourably reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 24th July. With the appearance of this work, the learned Professor, it is stated, has brought the translation of all the Confucian texts to a close: the reviewer adds:\u2014\"We congratulate him on the completion of his task, and it is not too much to say that no one but himself would have been capable of accomplishing so herculean a labour.\" Another volume by the same skilful hand has also been published during the current year at the Oxford Clarendon Press. It is especially well got up, and has a sketch-map and nine characteristic and well-executed illustrations.\nThe outside title is The Travels of F\u00e2-hien. Inside, it is shown to be \"The Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms, being an Account by the Chinese Monk F\u00e2-Hien of his Travels in India and Ceylon (A.D. 399-414) in search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline.\" The book consists of a Preface and Introduction, 40 short chapters, together with copious Notes\u2014frequently occupying more than half the page\u2014and the Chinese text reproduced from a copy sent to Dr. Legge from Japan by Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio. There have been previous translations of F\u00e2-Hien by M. Abel Remusat, the Rev. Samuel Beal, and Mr. Herbert Giles. The division into chapters is not apparent in the original Chinese: it was done by Klapproth for Remusat's version, and the arrangement has been approved and adopted in the present rendering.\n\nThe \"Remains of Lao Tzu,\" by Herbert A. Giles, is the title of a pamphlet in large octavo, published this year at Hong Kong, and containing 50 pages, or 100 columns of small close print. Whatever be the opinion of Chinese scholars, especially those who are mentioned by name in this analysis of the Tao Te Ching, the writer must be admitted to have put forward his case in a manner at once straightforward and ingenious. He is never dull; and, saving a passage or an expression here and there, it may be fairly said that his criticism is not only readable but withal very pleasant reading.\n\nIn the Academy of the 7th August M. Terrien de Lacouperie continues to discuss his theory of the derivation of early Chinese civilization from that of Babylonia by the medium of Susiana. The subject is of great interest, and has already engaged the attention of scholars such as Professors Legge and Douglas, and Dr. Edkins. The Athen\u00e6um of the 14th August notices Mr. B. C. Henry's \"Lingnam; or Interior Views of Southern China,\" a book which takes the reader to the less beaten tracks of the Delta of the Canton river and to Hainan. It is said to abound \"with facts which are both curious and new.\" Professor Douglas, in reviewing the same work in the Academy of the 28th August, explains that Ling-nam was the name given by the Chinese settlers to all the regions south of the range of mountains which for a long time formed the southern boundary of the Chinese possessions.\n\nAnnamite.\u2014Cochin-China.\u2014The March-April number (1886) of Excursions et Reconnaissances commences with a \"Rapport sur la Situation \u00c9conomique du Cambodge,\" a country which has a population estimated at 900,000, of which more than a ninth part is Chinese and 20,000 are Annamites. The \"Notes sur les Chau Lao du Tonkin\" illustrate the argument that the Annamites are mere conquerors, who have only taken root on the littoral, in the plains and along the river-courses; while the aborigines have been driven back into the unwholesome regions of the interior. The Chau of the province of H\u00e1ng H\u00f4a are considered by far the most interesting of the semi-independent groups whom the French had abandoned to their natural oppressors, and a specimen of whose language and writing is given. \"Les Iles et les C\u00f4tes Fran\u00e7aises du Golfe de Siam\" is a short descriptive paper, followed by a continuation of\nM. Aymonier's Notes on Annam, this time treating of the littoral, Cam Linh and Nha tsung, Ninh Hoa and the Deo Ca, and the products of the soil. Both these papers are of geographical interest. After some few data on the growth of Liberian coffee and cocoa in the Dutch Indian possessions, the Annamite Tales and Legends of M. Landes are resumed and brought to a conclusion\u2014at least for the time. They already form a tolerably large collection of stories and fables and folk-lore.\n\nJapanese.\u2014The Academy of June 5th repeats from the native local papers that Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain has been requested to lecture on the Japanese language and literature to Japanese students at the University of Tokio. It was in this same University that Professor Bunyiu Nanjio, who learnt Sanskrit at Oxford and received an honorary English degree, instructed Buddhist priests in the elements of Sanskrit and ancient literature of Buddhism. The number of the 26th June, noticing a History of Japan by Percy Thorpe, comes to the conclusion that, while it will not be of much service to the student, it will be useful to those who merely wish to \"know something\" about that country. The same paper on the 28th August begins the last paragraph of a review of Mr. Audsley's Ornamental Arts of Japan, by stating that \"in this splendid work... we have the most perfect view of Japanese Art which has yet been published.\" We learn from the Athen\u00e6um of the 24th July that Mr. Francis Galton, the President of the Anthropological Institute, in closing the series of conferences at South Kensington, announced the establishment of an Anthropological Institute in Japan, of which the secretary is a Japanese gentleman who recently took honours at Cambridge.\n\nWe have received vol. ix. parts 1 and 2 of the Transactions of the Seismological Society of Japan. Part i. has papers on Earthquake Frequency, Earth Currents, and the Automatic Current Recorder; part ii. gives an instructive and comprehensive account of the more important volcanoes. Vol. iii. of the Transactions has just been published in the Japanese language. Of quite recent publications the following should be also noted: Easy Conversations in English, German, and Japanese, first series, second edition, by F. Warrington Eastlake (Tokio, Z. P. Maruya & Co., 1886); Nippon Shokubutsuumei, or Nomenclature of Japanese Plants in Latin, Japanese, and Chinese, by J. Matsumura, supervised by R. Yatabe (Tokio, Maruya, 1884); The Meiji Kwaiwa-Hen, a Treasury of Conversational Phrases in English and Japanese, parts i. and ii. (Tokio, Maruya, 1886).\n\nTurkish.\u2014According to the Athen\u00e6um of the 26th June, a number of Magyar literati were about to visit Constantinople in company with Professor Vamb\u00e9ry. Dr. Ignatz Kunost, a philologist of the same nationality, had been engaged for some time in Asia, studying the common or spoken Turkish, as well as the Folk-lore of the Turkish provinces, with a view to the publication by the Hungarian Academy of the result of his inquiries.\n\nThe Reverend H. P. Tozer, reviewing Mrs. Walker's \"Eastern\nLife and Scenery, with Excursions in Asia Minor,\" in the Academy of the 12th June, remarks \"the author always writes pleasantly, and sometimes with a vein of originality.\"\n\nEgypt and Egyptology.\u2014Under this head one of the most important items of intelligence is the resignation by Professor Maspero of his Superintendence of excavations and collection of antiquities in Egypt, an office to which he succeeded on the death of Mariette Pasha, and which he has administered with remarkable zeal and ability for a period of five years. His courteous, unassuming manner, and readiness to impart information to the many travellers visiting the Bulak Museum, were as conspicuous as the depth and soundness of his knowledge. One of his latest official acts\u2014unfolding the mummies of Rameses II. and III.\u2014has been celebrated in a proc\u00e8s verbal, of which a reprint appears in the Academy of 3rd July. The latter paper, in confirming the report of his resignation, announces that Professor Maspero's successor in the service of the Khedive will be his pupil, M. Eug\u00e8ne Gr\u00e9baut, an Egyptologist of proved distinction.\n\nIn the Academy of the 26th June is an interesting letter from Mr. Flinders Petrie, giving some results of his exploration of \"the hitherto unexamined site of Defenneh (pronounced Defneh), the Tahpanhes, Taphne (LXX.), and Daphne of antiquity. His argument that this was that earliest Greek town of Egypt, as well as that the site was one of the XXVI. Dynasty, wholly free from later remains, give an exceptional importance to the subject. Above all, we have now in him a new and valuable authority that here is \"Pharaoh's house in Tahpanes\" (Jerem. xliii. 9), and that the \"brickwork\" or \"pavement\" which was \"at the entry,\" is exactly explained by a large paved area outside of the palace opposite to the entry. It should be observed that the words in the Old Version, where the prophet is commanded to hide stones in \"the clay in the brick-kiln,\" are changed in the Revised Version to hide them in \"mortar in the brickwork\"; moreover, that a marginal note infers that they may mean \"lay them with mortar in the pavement (or square).\"\n\nThe same paper of July 3 contains a review by Mr. A. J. Butler of Mr. Stanley Lane Poole's \"Art of the Saracens in Egypt,\" a work illustrated with more than one hundred engravings. As an essay on the whole subject of Egyptian medi\u00e6val art, the reviewer would have wished it to convey a clearer definition than it does of the term \"Saracenic,\" with reference to \"Coptic.\" As a hand-book, he recognizes in it \"a valuable addition to the art hand-books of the South Kensington Museum;\" and holds it \"difficult to over-colour the praise it deserves.\"\n\nAt a special meeting of the Egypt Exploration Fund, held in the theatre of the Royal Institution, Albemarle Street, on Tuesday, the 6th July, for the purpose of hearing Mr. Ernest Gardner's lecture on recent excavations, Mr. Petrie's Memoir on Naukratis, then just ready for issue to subscribers, was placed on the table.\n\nThe following items are gathered from the Academy: On the\n23rd June, Miss Amelia B. Edwards received from Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, the degree of LL.D., \"in recognition of her services to Egyptological research;\" and on the following day the same degree was conferred upon Mr. Reginald Stuart Poole (already an hon. LL.D. of Cambridge and Corresponding Member of the Institute of France), by Dartmouth College, New Jersey. The recipients are both honorary secretaries of the Egypt Exploration Fund. On the 17th July, the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy was also conferred on Miss Edwards by the College of the Sisters of Bethany in Kansas, \"in recognition of her work in the field of Scriptural archeology.\"\n\nThe question of evidence against antiquity borne by \"kiln-burnt bricks\" may now be considered to have been fairly solved. Mr. Flinders Petrie, in a letter of the 10th July, states that last winter he found \"three instances of baked bricks in Egypt dating from 1200 B.C.;\" and certainly none later than 700 B.C.;\" while Professor Sayce, writing on the 21st inst., points out that the bricks \"composing the old fortress of Gebelin, south of Thebes, are stamped with the cartouches of Ra-men-kheper and Isis-m-khel of the (illegitimate) XXI. Dynasty,\" besides other examples. As the first of the kings of the XXII. Dynasty is said to have been the Shishak of Scripture, the period alluded to may reasonably be inferred about 1000 B.C.\n\nIn the issue of the 7th August, Miss Edwards describes Professor Maspero's discovery, in February, of a piece of inscribed limestone containing a complete version of the contents of the Berlin papyrus No. 1, best known by his own translation, entitled \"Les Aventures de Sinoubit,\" and by the English version styled \"the Story of Saneha,\" from the pen of the late C. W. Goodwin. The period at which this tale was written is involved in doubt, but it is affirmed to be \"older by many centuries than the time of Moses\"; and the find has been of great general value in archaeological research. The same number of the Academy notifies that M. Edouard Naville, the discoverer of Pithom, has been decorated by the Emperor of Germany with the order of the Red Eagle, in honour of the completion of his great work, the comparative edition of \"the Ritual,\" or Book of the Dead.\n\nIn addition to Professor Maspero's proc\u00e8s verbal, to which we have already referred, a second paper of a similar nature signed by him, describing the unwrapping of the Mummies of Sekenen-ra and Seti I., in presence of General Stephenson and many officers and ladies residing at Cairo, on the 9th June, appears in the number of the 31st July. To this is added, in that of the 14th August, his Report to the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, in which he mentions the singular fact that among the mummies was found the body of a young man, between 25 and 30 years of age, bearing neither name nor inscription, showing signs of death in extreme agony. The Athen\u00e6um of September 4 states that Professor the Abb\u00e9 Hyvernat is preparing a pal\u00e6ographic atlas in Coptic.\n\nAmong late works on Egypt are noted: Lef\u00e8bure (G.), Les\nHypog\u00e9es Royaux de Th\u00e8bes. 1\u00e8re division. Le tombeau de S\u00e9ti I. Paris, Leroux. Egypt Exploration Fund, vol. iii., Naukratis, part i. (with 44 plates), by Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie, also chapters by Messrs. Cecil Smith, Ernest Gardner, and Barclay V. Head.\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014Among the more interesting epigraphical discussions of the quarter is that raised by Mr. Fleet in his contributions to the Indian Antiquary for July, under the respective heads of \"The Epoch of the Gupta Era,\" and \"Mandasor Inscription of Kumaragupta and Bandhuvarmar\"\u2014the last being No. 162 of his papers on \"Sanskrit and Old-Kanarese Inscriptions.\" This is no question of the accuracy of particular readings of an inscription, but one of the bearing of the inscription itself on Indian history and chronology. His main contention from the new data is that evidence has been obtained to prove the correctness of Al Biruni's statement that the Gupta Era began \"within a year or two on either side of A.D. 319-20\": that the same authority was wrong in making this the epoch of the extermination, instead of the rise to power of the Guptas; and that, under another name, the Vikrama Era did exist anterior to A.D. 544. Should any hesitation be felt in accepting these results, Mr. Fleet would invite attention to the G\u00f4lm\u00e2dh\u00eetol Inscription of the Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja Sivadeva I. of Managriha in Nepal (discovered and published some months ago by Mr. Cecil Bendall), in which he finds the most valuable corroboration of his conclusions. This inscription is dated in the year 318, without specification of era. Sivadeva I. is shown in it to be contemporary with the Mahasamanta Am\u00e2suvarman, whose approximate date, viz. about A.D. 637, was, Mr. Fleet writes, \"very well known from Hiouen Tsiang's mention of him.\" Now, according to Dr. Bhagwanlal Indraji, the years 34, 35, and 44 or 45, on certain inscriptions of Am\u00e2suvarman, belong to the era established by Harshavardhana of Kanauj, commencing in A.D. 606 or 607. It therefore follows that the date of 318 for Sivadeva I. must refer to an era commencing about 300 years prior to that of Harshavardhana. The first-mentioned Gupta Era, beginning \"within a year or two on either side of A.D. 319-20,\" is the one which, it is argued, \"exactly meets the requirements of the case,\" for $319 + 318 = A.D. 637$. Mr. Fleet then proceeds to consider how far this particular era came to be introduced into Nepal, a circumstance which he attributes to the conquest of the country by either the early Guptas or the rulers of Vallabhi, whose first permanent sovereign is Dharasena IV. To those interested in a solution of the question, Dr. B\u00fchler's paper in the Sitzungsberichte der Phil. hist. Classe der Kais. Akademie der Wissenschaften may be commended for perusal. It is entitled \"Eine Inschrift des K\u00f6nigs Dharasena IV. von Valabhi\"; and its reprint as a separate pamphlet has quite recently appeared.\n\nThe Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for August has a note on Professor Sayce's two Van Inscriptions. The first is said to be identical with one published by D. M\u00fcller in the Records of the Imperial Academy of Science. The second, of eleven lines engraved on red sandstone, is supposed to have been\nan enumeration of sacrifices; but it is broken away on both sides, and the beginning and end are wanting.\n\nWe gather from the Academy of 14 August that, at a late meeting of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, Mr. Schlumberger exhibited rubbings of a mysterious inscription found at Ak Hisar (Thyatira) in Lydia. It is engraved on three sides of a stone which now forms the base of a wood pillar in a caravansara. On the fourth side may be distinguished the legs of a human being. The characters of the inscription bear no resemblance to those classed as Hittite; some have rather the appearance of bad copies of Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of July 31 reviews Mr. Eugene Leggett\u2019s \u201cMint Towns and Coins of the Muhammadans from the Earliest Period to the Present Time,\u201d but thinks it unfortunate that the designer of so excellent a programme should have set about his work with inadequate preparation. Pointing out certain inaccuracies and defects of arrangement and execution, it admits that the compilation contains a great deal of information which it must have cost pains to gather, and that the labour expended on it is obviously of love. The same paper notes the cataloguing by Mr. Stanley Lane Poole of the little-known cabinet of coins in the Library of Christ Church, Oxford, and notifies the completion of Mr. Poole\u2019s Catalogue of Muhammadan coins in the Bodleian Library. On the 14th August the Athen\u00e6um begins a long review of volumes ii. and iii. of the International Numismata Orientalia, with the statement that the whole work \u201cowed its existence to a scholar of singularly wide attainments and a publisher whose zeal for learning outstripped even his remarkable business capacity.\u201d It need hardly be added that allusion is made to Mr. Edward Thomas and Mr. Nicholas Tr\u00fcbner. Vol. i. was completed in 1878; vol. ii. in 1881; vol. iii. part 1 in 1882; and part 2 at a very recent date. It is to the last that attention is now mainly directed, Sir Walter Elliot\u2019s essay on the Coins of Southern India, regarding which a pregnant sentence of the review merits quotation: \u201cIt is a matter of general felicitation that the only living scholar who has acquired a mastery over this perplexing subject should have been able practically to achieve his work before failing sight rendered the personal examination of the coins impossible.\u201d\n\nIn the first number of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for the current year, Mr. Oliver discourses on some copper coins of Akbar, of which a bag of several hundred had been brought to him by a Baniyd. He mentions, as a curious fact, that in this one find are included specimens of the whole twelve Persian months from Fanvardin to Isfandarmuz, in many cases of several mints.\n\nVienna Congress.\u2014The representatives of the Royal Asiatic Society at the Seventh International Congress, held at Vienna while these pages are in the press, are Dr. R. N. Cust, Honorary Secretary, Professors Cecil Bendall, M.A., Terrien de Lacouperie, and Mr. George Grierson, Members of the Council, and Dr. Theodore Duka, Member. It is hoped to publish the Hon. Secretary\u2019s Summary of Proceedings in the January number of the Journal.\nCORRIGENDA TO PART II. VOL. XVIII.\n\nP. 383, 2nd par., 9th line.

HENRY YULE, R.E., C.B., PRESIDENT,\n\nIN THE CHAIR.\n\nOPENING ADDRESS.\n\nI shall not occupy much of your time, but it seems only right and desirable on this our Anniversary that the person who, somewhat unaccountably to himself, finds himself in the Chair of this Society, should say something on the position and current history of the Society.\n\nWhat first strikes us is the melancholy retrospect of the past winter. It is like the survey of a battle-field. Death has been busy in all circles, but it seems as if he had wielded his weapon nowhere more actively than in that small corner occupied by our Society,\u2014striking down there several of our most eminent and valuable members\u2014Mr. Vaux, Dr. Birch, Sir Walter Medhurst, Sir Arthur Phayre, James Fergusson, Edward Thomas, and Sir William Robinson. Full records of all these will appear in our Annual Report, but I could not let this occasion pass without speaking particularly of some of them, with whose counten-\nances we are most familiar, and whose loss seems to change the aspect of our body, as the removal of the most familiar spires and towers of Westminster would change the aspect of that quarter of our capital.\n\nWith Mr. Vaux I can hardly say that I enjoyed intimacy, though our relations were always cordial and kindly. Phayre, Ferguson, and Thomas I had long been permitted to count as familiar friends. All that I will say of Mr. Vaux is that this Society owes him a heavy debt of gratitude. The Society had reached rather a low ebb when he joined us, but the result of his exertions, heavily weighted as they were by his deteriorated sight, was to raise both our list of membership and the quality of the Journal to a far higher level; whilst his kindly helpful spirit was ever ready to assist inquirers. . . . . . .\n\nThe next whom we had to lament was James Fergusson, intimately associated with the Society ever since any of us here present have known it. He, like Phayre, was a man who, in the main, educated himself. Sent to India at an early age, he was brought up as a planter and a merchant in Bengal, i.e. in the Delta of the Ganges, which hardly affords the trace of an ancient building. His inborn taste led him to give himself to the study of architecture, and to devote the earliest opportunities afforded by leisure and means to travelling over India, in days when such travelling was a laborious business, examining, comparing, and drawing its ancient remains. His membership of this Society dates from 1844. His active mind and indefatigable industry found wide and various fields, the connexion of all of which is to be found in paths binding them either to taste or to construction. Of his Oriental work we would naturally speak most prominently here. That embraced his \"Illustrations of Ancient Indian Architecture,\" \"The Rock Temples of\n\n1 Here follow three or four paragraphs which will be found in the President's Obituary Notice of Sir Arthur Phayre at page x.\nIndia\" (the subject of one of his latest, as it was of one of his earliest works), that treasure-house the volume (one of his great series on the \"History of Architecture\") which treats of Indian and Oriental styles, the two editions of the remarkable book so rich in varied interest which he called \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" and numerous papers in the Transactions of this and other societies on subjects of Indian Architecture and Archaeology. Another branch of study which he pursued with the keenest ardour and acumen was the topography of Jerusalem, the dates of its remains, and the identity of the most noted sites: these gave birth to a whole series of dissertations, including his articles in the \"Dictionary of the Bible,\" enough of themselves to have made a man famous. A third subject embraced his ideas on fortification, and their application to the defence of our ports. Though his particular theories were not accepted, his publication on this subject in 1849 led to his subsequent appointment to the Committee of National Defence, and had no small bearing on the defences actually carried out. Through his Jerusalem studies, and the interest and controversy they created, he was, in effect, the father of the Survey of the Holy City and of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and of all that it has accomplished and may yet accomplish. The lighting of Greek temples was another subject on which he held original views, and strong ones, as he did on most subjects, and which he applied in the latter years of his life to that Kew gallery which he designed for Miss North, when that accomplished and munificent lady presented it, along with her beautiful drawings of tropical vegetation, to the Nation. The decoration of St. Paul's was another matter in which he took a prominent part, but it is a burning subject, and an Asiatic Society has no call to meddle with its controversies. Mr. Fergusson's was a character which illustrates in various ways the perfervidum ingenium proverbially assigned to his countrymen. His convictions on all subjects\nwere intense. When he put forward a proposition, it was very far from his intention that it should be moulded or whittled by hostile hands: the character *qualis ab incepto* generally applied to any opinion of his, and in controversy he hit very hard, and too often needlessly hard. Even those who gave and took hard knocks in strife with him ache, we trust, no longer. We, again, and there are many of us, whose happier fortune it was to have no such passages of arms with him, look back only to his ripe sagacity, his kindly appreciation of our work, his constant readiness to open the matchless stores of his knowledge, and the rich abundance of his collections in books and photographs, to those who sought help in their researches.\n\nNext on our casualty-roll is Edward Thomas, and time allows me but to say a word of that honest, friendly soul, whose name was recognized over Europe as a prince in Oriental numismatics, and was honoured by assumption into the Foreign Lists of the Institute of France and of the Academy of St. Petersburg. The aggregate of his work is immense, though much of it lies in articles scattered over various periodicals. His name will be preserved by these, by his Chronicles, derived from coinage, of the so-called Patan kings of Delhi, and by his intimate association with the publication of James Prinsep's Essays, with the historical collections of Sir Henry Elliot, and with the new edition of Marsden's Numismata Orientalia.\n\nOn one other subject I will touch before sitting down. Mr. Kay, a respected member of our Council, has recently addressed a letter to our Secretary on a matter of which we are all too conscious, i.e. the deplorably low ebb at which the study of Eastern languages and literature stands in this country, and on which he suggested the formation of a special committee to consider the causes and the possible remedies for this state of things. I feel strongly the truth of Mr. Kay's observations, and I may say in passing, and in all sincerity, that if things were in a better state, this chair would not\nbe filled as it is to-day. But what I wish to mention is that we are attempting to carry out Mr. Kay's suggestions, and along with them to devise means for extending the membership of this Society and the interest in its pursuits. A special committee has accordingly been named, consisting of Mr. Bendall, Mr. Dickens, Mr. Kay, Gen. Maclagan and Mr. Thornton, with Mr. Cust and our Secretary as ex-officio members; and the following heads of inquiry have been indicated to them, without excluding others of a kindred kind that may suggest themselves:\n\n1. The preparation of a list of appointments in England\u2014in Government establishments, universities and colleges, and other institutions of sorts\u2014for which a scholarly acquaintance with Oriental languages is a necessary or important qualification; with the emoluments of each and the mode of appointment.\n\n2. Regarding the possibility of approaching the Government, the Universities, the City Companies, etc., for support in the promotion of Oriental studies.\n\n3. Regarding the possibility and expediency of amalgamating this Society with any other of kindred objects, and of reducing the scale of subscription now in force.\n\n4. Whether the publication of Oriental works beyond the scope of the Journal should be undertaken.\n\n5. The consideration of any means by which the Society could be rendered more popular, consistent with its objects and character.\n\nReport.\n\nMembers.\u2014The Council of the Royal Asiatic Society have to report that, since the last Anniversary Meeting held on Monday, May 18, 1885, there has been the following decrease in, and addition to the numbers of the Society's Members.\n\nThey announce with regret the loss, by Death, of ten Resident Members, viz.\u2014\nJames Fergusson, Esq., C.I.E., D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., Vice-President.\n\nEdward Thomas, Esq., C.I.E., F.R.S., Treasurer.\n\nLieut.-Gen.

Vaux, Prebendary of Winchester, was born at Oxford on the 28th February, 1818. His second name, Sandys, was given to him after a distinguished ancestor on the maternal side, who was Archbishop of York in 1576. He was educated\nat Westminster, a school for which he always retained a boyish enthusiasm; and he graduated B.A. of Balliol College, Oxford, in 1840. The following year he was employed in the Department of Antiquities in the British Museum, and in January, 1861, he was appointed Keeper of Coins and Medals there, a post which he resigned in 1870. From about that date until 1876 he was engaged on a catalogue of the coins in the Bodleian Library for the University of Oxford. In January, 1876, he became Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, and continued in that office until the 21st June, 1885, the day of his death, carrying on his daily routine of work up to the 19th idem.\n\nHe was also Honorary Secretary of the Royal Society of Literature from 1852 to 1858, and Secretary from 1858 to 1885, on the 28th January of which latter year he tendered his resignation\u2014finally retiring at the Anniversary in April. Of the Numismatic Society he was President for exactly twenty years, or from November, 1855, to November, 1875.\n\nHe published in 1851 \"Nineveh and Persepolis,\" a volume which reached four editions, and was translated into German; also in the same year a \"Handbook to the Antiquities of the British Museum.\" In 1856 he edited for the Hakluyt Society Sir Francis Drake's \"World Encompassed,\" for which he wrote a very able preface. He made many contributions to Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography in 1854-57.\n\nIn 1863 he deciphered and edited for the Trustees of the British Museum a Collection of ninety Phoenician Inscriptions found at Carthage. In 1868 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1876 he published a Catalogue of the Castellani collection of Antiquities in the University Galleries, Oxford, and the next year \"Greek Cities and Islands of Asia Minor\" for the series of \"Ancient History from the Monuments.\" He added to the same series a history of \"Persia from the Earliest Period to the Arab Conquest.\"\nHis publications in the Numismatic Chronicle are as follows:\n\nIn 1854. On Coins of Alexander the Great. On Some Rare Bactrian Coins. On Coins of Ceylon; with some Remarks on the so-called Ring, and Fish-hook Money.\n\n1856. On Some Greek Coins. Vol. xviii. p. 137.\n\n1857. On Coins discovered by W. K. Loftus at Susa. Vol. xx. p. 25.\n\n1858. On Coins of Characene. Ibid. p. 32. Coins of Seistan. Ibid. p. 49.\n\n1859.

Vol. xv. p. 1.\n\n1876. Indenture preserved in the Bodleian Library relating to certain Farthings of James I. Vol. xvi. p. 235.\n\nMuch might be said of the amiable character and varied accomplishments of the late Mr. Vaux. His work for nearly ten years on behalf of the Asiatic Society has been already referred to in the Journal, and more especially in the Honorary Secretary's remarks attached to the last year's Report, and the special care he took to advance the Society's interests, as well as the marked success which attended his efforts, were\nsuch as could not fail to be appreciated by its Council and Officers. Those who knew him out of this particular sphere of usefulness have borne, and will still bear, ready testimony to the universality of his knowledge, his industry and devotion, his kindly and genial disposition, conciliatoriness, and readiness to help and oblige.\n\nThe late Secretary's remains were consigned to their resting-place, at the Brompton Cemetery, on Friday, June 26, in the presence of a large gathering.\n\nAmong those of our members whose loss during the last season we have to record, one of the most eminent and most deeply lamented is Sir Arthur Phayre.\u00b9\n\nHe had not settled among us in London, like others whom we commemorate to-day. Though born in England, he always reckoned himself an Irishman, and in Ireland, after his retirement from active employment, he set up his headquarters. But he regularly visited London in the summer, and was gladly welcomed at the Council-table of our Society, and at the Athen\u00e6um Club. He is sorely missed at both, and, we may add, in the councils of his country\u2014for his death occurred just as the conquest of Upper Burma had taken place, and when his advice would have been of the highest value. His last public utterance was a letter which appeared in The Times of 13th October last, in which he gave his unhesitating approval to the military intervention for the deposition of King Theebaw. There could have been no more valuable sanction to the righteousness of that measure. Phayre was not only eminently just, but had ever been the true friend of the King of Burma, and the most moderate of men in his dealings with his government.\n\nArthur Purves Phayre was born at Shrewsbury, 7th May,\n\n\u00b9 The foundation of this notice is one of greater length compiled by me for the February number of the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society. But since then I have been favoured with memoranda by Lieut.-General Sir Richard Meade and by Major-General Barnet Ford, of which advantage has been taken.\u2014H. Yule.\n1812, the son of Richard Phayre, Esq., a resident there, and grandson of Colonel Phayre, of Killoughran Forest, in the county Wexford. He went to India as a Cadet in 1829, and served for some years with the 7th Bengal N. I. Going early into the service, he had not received much instruction; but from the beginning of his career he was engaged in educating himself. Early friends who survive describe Phayre when a young subaltern as hardy and temperate in his habits, reading, thinking, and making notes, delighting in argument, sometimes in paradox, and a most agreeable companion in camp. In 1834 he was selected for service with one of those local corps which often formed a door to employment of a higher kind; but nothing important came of this till 1837, when he was appointed assistant to the Commissioner of Arakan, then Captain Bogle (afterwards Sir Archibald).\n\nArakan, though geographically so near Calcutta, was then practically one of the most secluded provinces of the empire; its population scanty, and its only communication with the outer world maintained by a sailing vessel which came from the Hoogly about once in six weeks. Sir Richard Meade, who, as a very young officer, stayed with Phayre at Akyab, records the impression which the latter then made on him, that \"he was an officer of thought and judgment far beyond his years and standing. In his conversation, his earnest regard for the welfare and interests of the people of his district, his love of justice, and an entire absence of self-assertion, or indeed of self in any shape, were very striking. One felt that he was a man of real work and worth. . . . I well remember one evening, when I was sitting outside with him, a number of people brought in the body of a hill-tiger, which had been killed by a Mugh with a single blow of his dhao. The man had been in his house, when he heard a cry from the garden, and running out he saw his brother struck down by the beast. Seizing his dhao, he rushed on the tiger, and with one lucky blow in the neck disabled, and then killed\nit. The brother was not seriously injured. Phayre commended the act in terms which evidently delighted the man and his friends; then going into the house, he brought out a handful of rupees as a reward for his brave deed.\"\n\nIn solitude at Sandoway, where he spent two years of his Arakan service, Phayre had ample scope not only for that study of the Burmese language and character, in which he stood so high, but for the pursuit of that self-cultivation which led all who knew him in later life to regard him as a man of exceptionally good education. The purity of his life, in a province where laxity was the rule rather than the exception, earned the exceptional respect of the people of the country.\n\nAt an early period of Phayre's service in Arakan, we find him associated with Lieut. (now Lieut.-General) Albert Fytche, who long afterwards succeeded him as Chief Commissioner of British Burma, in an expedition for the punishment of a hill-tribe, the Walien, in the upper basin of the Arakan River, whose unexplored fastnesses were supposed to be inaccessible to our arms. The chief stronghold of these caterans, 4000 feet above the valley, was scaled and destroyed, and both Phayre and Fytche received high commendation.\n\nIn 1846 Phayre was transferred to Moulmein as principal assistant to Mr. J. R. Colvin, then Commissioner of the Tenasserim Provinces, and three years later his merits, by this time well known to Government, were rewarded with the Commissionership of Arakan. He held this position when the second Burmese war broke out in 1852, and as soon as the Province of Pegu was annexed to the British dominions, Phayre, not the oldest, but certainly the ablest of the officers associated with Burmese administration, was nominated by Lord Dalhousie to the charge of the new territory.\n\nHe governed the Delta province for ten years as Commissioner. His name, when he entered it, was not strange to the people. His justice and firmness, his great liberality, his mastery of the language, and intimate knowledge of\nthose whom he had ruled in the adjoining provinces, were known and appreciated; whilst his commanding figure, his dignity, courtesy, and high personal character, his considerate and patient bearing, all combined to win him the favour and confidence of those whom he was called to govern.\n\nThe first two years of his rule in Pegu were full of anxieties to Phayre. He was especially exercised by the troubles of dacoity in the Tharawadi and other districts. The suppression of this was a service of most harassing character, and very unpopular with the army, whilst more than one officer of good previous reputation broke down under the trial. But in those two years (1853-1854) the country greatly quieted down, and from 1855 dates the extraordinary progress made by the new province.\n\nHis authority was in 1862 extended over the whole of our Burmese provinces, which, under the denomination of British Burma, embraced a continuous sea-board of 900 miles. By his wise and considerate administration, which, among other measures, carried through the abolition of forced labour, the introduction of a stable currency, the development of trade, especially in the export of rice, and the effective repression of crime, he laid the foundation of that prosperity which had reached a high pitch before his own rule terminated. From the beginning, too, he was determined that the province should pay its way; and whilst he enforced a rigid economy, he maintained also a considerable taxation. But prosperity went on, and immigration flowed in steadily. The population of all the British provinces, Arakan, Tenasserim, and Pegu, at the date of the conquest of the last, was probably not more than 1\u00bd million. In 1884 it had grown to 4\u00bd millions.\n\nOne of the subjects to which he gave much attention in the latter years of his rule was that of vernacular education. Monastic schools, taught by the p'hungyis, or Buddhist monks, are a peculiar characteristic of the country. Through their agency the proportion of the population who can read\nand write is very large. Phayre's idea was to bring these monastic schools under the influence of the educational department, by putting in the hands of their indigenous teachers elementary books of sound instruction, and by inducing them to enter the sphere of Government inspection. The plan was carried out, but has not always been viewed with favour by the department concerned; nor have I been able to learn anything very precise as to its success.\\(^1\\)\n\nPhayre three times went as envoy on the part of the Governor-General to the Court of Burma. The first time was in 1855, with the object (in part) of obtaining the King's assent by treaty to the cession of the delta province. The Envoy's conciliatory manners and thorough acquaintance with Burmese ideas attracted the King's goodwill, but he would assent to no treaty. On this mission I had the honour of being appointed, by Lord Dalhousie, as Secretary to the Envoy, and from that time I date a friendship and correspondence with my admirable chief, which death alone has interrupted, and in which I never ceased to take pride and pleasure.\n\nPhayre's other missions occurred in 1862 and 1866, in connexion with trade matters, and were not very successful. The more than considerate treatment which the King had always met with at Phayre's hands had hardly been appreciated by his Majesty.\n\nPhayre quitted Burma finally in 1867, declining further high employment in India; and greatly did he enjoy his leisure at home, his first visit to Europe since he had gone out nearly forty years before.\n\n\\(^1\\) I see that in the year 1884-85 the number of indigenous schools in the list as inspected was: \u2014 Monastic schools, 3837; Lay schools, 879. The schools helped by \"grants-in-aid,\" were: \u2014 Monastic, 825; Lay, 449. Of Monastic schools inspected 21\u00b75 per cent., with 3414 pupils, are stated to have earned grants for results, and 587 pupils, or 17\u00b72 per cent. of those who earned grants, passed fully by one of the standards. Of Lay schools, again, 51 per cent., with 4622 pupils, or 14\u00b76 per cent. of the total number, earned result-grants, and 1201 pupils, or 26 per cent. of the number who had earned grants, passed the primary school examinations.\nIn 1869 he returned to India as a traveller, visiting, among other parts, Kashmir and Peshawar, and their Buddhist remains, with great interest; and then continuing his journey round the globe by Saigon, China, Japan, San Francisco, and the United States.\n\nOn his return, he took up his abode at Bray, near Dublin, and there he continued to have his head-quarters for the rest of his unemployed life. But his public service was not yet ended. In the latter part of 1874 he was nominated by Lord Carnarvon to the government of Mauritius, an office which he held with satisfaction to the colonists and to the Queen's Government for more than four years. He returned home, after a visit to South Africa, in 1879. His death occurred suddenly in his lodgings at Bray, on the night of 14th-15th December, 1885. Its announcement was a shock and a surprise to a circle of friends very strongly attached to him. It is true that he was over three-score and thirteen; but who ever realized the fact who saw him, youthful and alert in action, and in his great stature slim and lithe as a palm tree?\n\nIn concluding this abstract of the career of a good and illustrious man, let me note a few of his personal characteristics. Early recollections of Phayre speak of a certain gaunt angularity in his aspect and bearing; but assuredly that process of self-education that so long went on in him, the continual moulding from within, and the long exercise of authority and conscious influence, had replaced this, as far back as my own remembrance of him goes, by a notable refinement and dignity, whilst there was an unfailing courtesy of manner. These qualities always tended to win him special favour among foreigners, and with his sympathy and fairness did him no small service in his government of Mauritius. He was naturally, as those who knew him most intimately were aware, of a warm temper, but no man had his temper under stricter or more habitual control.\n\nAn occupation of some of his later years, resumed from time\nto time, was the preparation of his History of Burma, finally published by Tr\u00fcbner in 1883. It is difficult to attract readers to such a subject, except under the passing stimulus of events directly adding to the matter of Burmese history. But Phayre's work is careful, lucid, and excellent. I have recently been told that he left behind him a carefully revised edition of this History in type. He also published, in 1882, as a fasciculus of the *International Numismata Orientalia*, a work on the coins of Arakan, Pegu, and Burma.\n\nSome fifteen papers on subjects of a similar character, and in part contributions to the eventual preparation of the works mentioned, appeared from time to time between 1841 and 1881, chiefly in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nLet me conclude with words already used in the obituary notice, to which reference has been made in a note at p. x.\n\n\"Just, humane, magnanimous, beneficent, animated by an extraordinary sense of duty, courteous, modest\u2014I never remember an instance in which himself, or his claims, or his rights, much less his merits, made any part directly or indirectly in his words or acts,\u2014with the wisdom to build up a state, as he built up a great province: what a contemptible thing seems the oratory on which men set such value, and bestow such admiring epithets,\u2014a tool as apt and as often used to destroy a kingdom as to build one up,\u2014beside such a combination of qualities as these!\"\u00b9\n\nDr. Samuel Birch,\u00b2 who was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society in the year 1866, was the eldest son of the late Rev. Samuel Birch, D.D., Rector\n\n\u00b9 A movement is on foot for the erection of a memorial to Sir Arthur Phayre, of which the Secretary in this country is Major-General Barnet Ford, 31, Queensborough Terrace, W. For the same object a meeting was held at Rangoon, on the 6th of March last. It is I presume a sign of the transitory character of society there that the meeting is reported to have been \"not very numerously attended.\" It was unfortunate that the venerable Roman Catholic Bishop Bigandet, who was one of Phayre's oldest and most valued friends, was unable, probably from his great age, to attend; and that the chief member of the American Mission was also prevented by illness from being present.\n\n\u00b2 Obituary notice supplied by Mr. Th. G. Pinches, British Museum.\nof St. Mary Woolnoth, and Vicar of Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire. His grandfather was Samuel Birch, of Cornhill (the old business still bears the name of Birch, though it is not in hereditary hands), who was not unknown as an author, and who attained to the dignity of Alderman, and was Lord Mayor of London in 1814-15. Dr. Birch was educated at Greenwich, Blackheath, and at Merchant Taylors' School, where he gained great distinction, and received an excellent education, which undoubtedly stood him in good stead in after-life. In the year 1834 he entered Government service, under the Commissioners of Public Records, and in January, 1836, received an appointment under the Trustees of the British Museum, in whose service he passed only a few days less than fifty years. On the retirement of Mr. Barnwell, Dr. Birch became Assistant-Keeper of the Department of Antiquities, which then included the whole range of Greek, Roman, British and Oriental archaeology, as well as numismatics and ethnology. In 1861, when this very miscellaneous department was divided, Dr. Birch was raised to the responsible position of Keeper of the British, Medi\u00e6val, and Oriental sections; and at a later subdivision, he was left with the strictly Oriental (Egyptian, Assyrian, Ph\u0153nician, and Himyaritic) Antiquities under his charge, retaining the post to the day of his death.\n\nAt a very early period of his life Dr. Birch had studied Chinese, and his first important duty at the Museum was the arrangement and cataloguing of the coins of China. He published, also, several articles and books, of which his translations of the Chinese writings, *Friends till Death*, *The Elfin Foxes*, *The Chinese Widow*, and *The Casket of Gems*, may be mentioned. One (or more than one) of these works was translated and published in Germany a few years ago. Besides the study of the Chinese coinage, Dr. Birch also devoted himself, for a time, to the study of the coinage of the ancient Britons. This resulted in the recovery, in 1844, of the royal name\nTasciovanus, the father of Cunobelin, from a few abbreviated legends (up to that time unexplained) found on the coins of the period.\n\nIt was to the study of the Egyptian antiquities, language, and literature, however, to which he ultimately devoted himself. Entering upon the study at the time when very little of a trustworthy nature existed, and great discredit had been thrown upon the discoveries already made in the science of Egyptology, Dr. Birch, following in the footsteps of Young and Champollion, made himself, by his detailed studies, so proficient that he may undoubtedly be regarded as one of the founders of the science. It was he who first gave continuous translations of the Egyptian texts\u2014translations which, notwithstanding the progress since made in the study, remain, on the whole, exceedingly exact. Among other things, he made translations of the Hieratic texts published in fac-simile in the Select Papyri, as well as of the well-known Egyptian Book of the Dead\u2014a text containing numberless difficulties.\n\nOf the two hundred or more books or papers by Dr. Birch upon subjects purely Egyptian, the most important (besides those mentioned above) were The Dictionary of Hieroglyphics and Egyptian Grammar, in the 5th vol. of the English edition of Baron Bunsen's Egypt's Place in Universal History, an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphics, a Magical Papyrus, the great Harris Papyrus, an Egyptian Reading-book, several Guides to the various galleries of his department in the British Museum, a Catalogue of the Egyptian Antiquities at Alnwick Castle, The Coffin of Amam, etc. etc. When one considers how the time of an official of the British Museum is taken up, the number and thoroughness of Dr. Birch's works can only be regarded as surprising. His great industry it undoubtedly was which made him one of the greatest Egyptologists in the world, with a reputation which was fully acknowledged\nnot only at home, but also in Germany, France, Italy,\u2014in fact, wherever notice is taken of the interesting results of the fascinating study to which he had devoted himself.\n\nDr. Birch began, at an early period, the study of Assyrian, but soon found that the acquirement of a really useful knowledge of that tongue would necessarily occupy much of the time which could be most profitably employed in studying the subject which he had made his speciality; and the little which he had learnt of Assyrian was soon forgotten. Nevertheless, he took an active interest in the subject to the end, and was fully alive to the importance of the discoveries made by the later as well as by the earlier scholars.\n\nAs Keeper of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, Dr. Birch was certainly pre-eminent. His capabilities as an arranger of antiquities were great, but he was much hampered in his work by the very limited space into which he was at first obliged to pack the various objects, and the great changes which have taken place at the Museum during the last few years. His knowledge of antiquities was very extensive, and his extreme caution, making him reject everything which even seemed to be false, undoubtedly kept the collections under his charge free from the many forgeries which abound, especially in Egypt, where falsifiers are skilfullest. Dr. Birch, however, suspected everything to be false until it was absolutely proved to be true. During the month of December last he received notice that some antiquities connected with my own special department were offered for sale to the Museum, and he asked me to examine them, remarking (though he had not seen the objects) that they were probably forgeries. The fatal illness had already overtaken him when I was prepared to report upon the matter. On being told that the objects in question were rank forgeries, \"I thought so!\" he exclaimed, starting up from\nhis pillow, \"just write and tell the owners that they are not suitable for acquisition by the British Museum.\" This is the line upon which he went, in all transactions with dealers, and he was thereby undoubtedly successful in keeping the collections under his charge in a high state of efficiency and trustworthiness.\n\nAlthough Dr. Birch never visited the sites which have yielded so plentifully the records of the ancient civilization which was his favourite study, it would be hardly fair to cast this omission against him as a reproach; for though a voyage in Egypt would undoubtedly have given him some advantage in his studies, it was nevertheless not by any means indispensable. It was with deliberate intention, however, that he stayed at home. \"I prefer to stay here,\" he used to say, \"for I know that most of the things of importance will ultimately be brought here into my room. I always told Mr. Smith that he would die if he went to Assyria, and it really turned out as I predicted.\"\n\nOne of the chief events of his life was the founding, in conjunction with the late W. R. Cooper and others, of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, upon the ruins of the Syro-Egyptian Society. Of this new and very successful venture he was president from 1870, the date of its foundation, until his death. He was also President of the London Congress of Orientalists in 1874. For such posts as these he was certainly eminently fitted from the wide range of his learning and reading.\n\nTo his study of fortification and military science in early youth is probably to be attributed that deep interest in politics which was one of his most characteristic traits, and those who came into contact with him will doubtless remember his opinions upon the Russian and Chinese questions. Though professing to be a Liberal, he nevertheless decidedly favoured Conservative policy. He was very unfavourably impressed by the \"three acres and a\ncow\" idea, and jocularly asked, if his own poor two-thirds of an acre were to form part of some lucky peasant-holder's three acres, when the idea came to be put into practice.\n\nIt has been asserted in one of the memoirs which have been written, that Dr. Birch was only a pioneer, and that his life was a failure, because he founded no school of students who, following their master's footsteps, might be able to continue his work. His very numerous works show that his life was not a failure as far as solid work is concerned\u2014indeed, it may be regarded as a most triumphant success; for the success or failure of a man's life does not depend upon the number of pupils he has trained. If Dr. Birch has left behind none, who, being still young, is nevertheless advanced enough to take his place, it was with deliberate intention on his part. \"What,\" he would say \"is the use of training a school of students of either Egyptian or Assyrian? When they have become proficient in the branch which they have chosen, how are they to gain their living? There may be work enough to keep two or three in a miserable kind of way, but even this is doubtful, for the chances of getting a living by literary work are very small, especially in a sphere so restricted; and when they find that they cannot earn their living, they will naturally forsake the study, and take to something else.\" To the correctness of this opinion I can myself testify from personal knowledge. Whatever the great scholar who has just passed away did, was the result of deep thought and deliberate intention. Men in whom real talent and common sense are combined are rare, and for this reason it seemed, probably, to those who had the honour of knowing him, that he was taken away from us all too soon, full of years and honours as he was. Long, however, will it be, ere this talented and genial scholar will be forgotten by those who knew him, and who now miss his kind face, his pleasant speech, and his ready, unfailing help and counsel.\nSir Walter Harry Medhurst\\(^1\\) was born in 1822 in Java, and his childhood was passed at Batavia and Malacca under the roof of his father, the celebrated missionary and Sinologue. He was subsequently sent home to Mill Hill School, and returning to the East, in 1838, rejoined his family at Macao. As a child he had acquired a knowledge of Dutch and Malay, as children do, without tears, and he had possibly been introduced to the study of Chinese. Dr. Medhurst, a man of remarkable aptitude, independently of his attainments as a student of the written language, had become a proficient in the dialect spoken by the natives of Fuh Kien, between which province and the island of Java and the Straits Settlements, thousands of Chinese had been long used to drift to and fro.\n\nAt Macao, at all events, the son was fairly entered, and under the guidance more especially of John Robert Morrison, the distinguished Chinese Secretary of the Superintendency of Trade, he became a competent speaker of the Mandarin, and withal a fair translator of official correspondence and the more difficult papers published in the Peking Gazette. In addition to this he learned to write a Chinese hand of singular excellence; a rare accomplishment, which stood him afterwards in good stead.\n\nIn those days the one spot in China accessible to the foreigner was Canton; Macao being regarded as an outlying dependency. Intercourse as well as trade was the monopoly of the Hong merchants. Chinese in any shape was studied more or less \\textit{sub rosd}, and the communication of the Gazette to the barbarian was a punishable irregularity. So short-handed in those days of anti-foreign jealousy was the native staff of the Chinese Secretariat, that the mere transcription and registration of correspondence was at times no easy matter. In 1839 occurred our first serious rupture with China, by which, of course, all difficulties of the kind\n\n\\(^1\\) Notice supplied by Sir Thomas Wade, K.C.B., M.R.A.S.\nwere much increased. The younger Medhurst's usefulness had already been recognized, and, in 1840, he was appointed to a clerkship in the Chinese Secretariat, and in the following year was attached to the suite of Sir Henry Pottinger. He accompanied the combined force up the coast in 1841, and was present at the first capture of Amoy and the second capture of Chusan, at which latter place he was left as Interpreter to the Garrison until December, 1842. The Five Ports having been opened by the treaty signed at Nanking in September, Mr. Medhurst became Interpreter to the Consulate of Shanghai, serving first under Sir George Balfour, and later under Sir Rutherford Alcock. In 1849, on the death of Mr. Gutzlaff, he succeeded that gentleman as Chinese Secretary, and in 1853, in addition to the duties of his own post, he acted as Secretary to the Superintendent of Trade. In 1854, he became Consul at Foochow, and in 1858, when the Northern Ports were opened by Lord Elgin's Treaty, he was named to Chefoo, but he never took up his commission there. He held various acting appointments up to 1864, amongst other places at Shanghai, during the Gordon campaign against the Tai Ping insurgents. Mr. Medhurst's assistance was cordially acknowledged by General Staveley, who commanded our own forces engaged against the same enemy, and in 1864 he became Consul at Hankow. Thence, in 1871, he was promoted to Shanghai, where he had in fact been acting since 1868, and at this last post he remained until 1877, when he retired on a pension. His services were then rewarded by a knighthood. He died of a fit of apoplexy at Torquay, on the 26th of December last.\n\nSir Walter Medhurst was one of the most orderly and punctual of men, and one of the most painstaking. His reports on trade attested his industry, and his opinions were always received with respect. As a linguist, he was useful rather than brilliant; but very useful. It seldom falls to\nthe lot of any man to be able to do what Sir Walter Medhurst did in 1876, when, at the instance of his former chief, Sir Rutherford Alcock, he proceeded eastward once more in the interest of the Borneo Company. The object of his mission being to encourage Chinese immigration in the direction of the newly-formed settlement, the Company were so fortunate as to secure in Sir Walter Medhurst an agent perfectly possessing the three languages, Dutch, Malay, and Chinese, for the employment of which necessity would be found to exist at either end of the line of communication.\n\nMr. James Fergusson,\u00b9 C.I.E., D.C.L. Oxon., LL.D. Edin., F.R.S., F.G.S., Vice-President of this Society, a Past Vice-President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, a Member of the Council of the Royal Geographical Society, a Member of the Society of Dilettanti, and of other learned bodies, was born at Ayr in Scotland, on the 22nd of January, 1808. His father, Dr. William Fergusson, author of Notes and Recollections of a Professional Life, was a man of some mark, who had seen service in various parts of the world, having been present on the Flag ship at Copenhagen in 1801, principal medical officer at the taking of Oporto, in the passage of the Douro, and at Talavera; and who, after serving in the West Indies, went to live at Edinburgh in the year 1817. James, the younger of Dr. Fergusson\u2019s two sons, had consequently the opportunity of beginning his education at the High School of that city. He entered Mr. Irvine\u2019s first class there in 1818, and in the following year was in the second class. Dr. Fergusson, however, left Edinburgh in 1821, and at the invitation of H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester, on whose staff he had acted in France, settled at Windsor, where he ultimately obtained a large and lucrative practice as a physician.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Notice supplied by Mr. William H. White, M.R.A.S., Secretary of the Roy. Instit. British Architects.\n\u00b2 See Dr. Fergusson\u2019s Notes and Recollections of a Professional Life; edited by James Fergusson. London, 1846, 8vo.\nwas then sent to a private school at Hounslow, and as he was destined for employment in the firm of Fairlie, Fergusson, and Co., of Calcutta, with which his family had been long connected, and in which his elder brother was a partner, his early education was neither academical nor classical. On the contrary, it was of a very ordinary character. The firm, however, failed soon after James Fergusson's arrival in India, and he became an indigo planter. He also, in conjunction with his brother William, started an independent house of business in Calcutta, from which he appears to have retired at the first opportunity open to him. Commercial pursuits were not to his taste; he took from the very earliest period great delight in old buildings, particularly those of a native type, and he was ultimately enabled to gratify his arch\u00e6ological bent. His rare powers of philosophical thought\u2014how acquired, it is now difficult to ascertain\u2014were expended upon the architectural remains to be found in the several localities he visited during lengthened tours over India, which seem to have occupied him from the years 1835 to 1842, when he returned to England. His route through the length and breadth of the Peninsula, sometimes on a camel's back, sometimes in a palanquin, is given in a map which forms one of the plates of his *Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindustan*, published in 1848. But prior to the appearance of that valuable work, he had communicated to this Society, of which he was elected a Member in 1840, some of the fruit of his earliest labours. At the close of 1843 he read a Paper, apparently the first he presented to any learned body, on *The Rock-cut Temples of India* [Vol. VIII. pp. 30\u201392, art. 10, illustrated with ten plates], which, after the due presentation of a memorial from the Council of this Society to the Court of Directors of the East India Company, led to orders being sent to the different presidencies, authorising the employment of competent persons to measure and draw the various antiquities remaining there\n\u2014a fact which led Fergusson to note, somewhat jubilantly, in a reprint of his Paper, that \"we may thus escape the hitherto too-well merited reproach of having so long possessed that noble country and done so little to illustrate its history or antiquities.\" Going out a second time, he was in Bombay in the spring of 1845, and this was the last visit he paid to the country with which his name, as the acknowledged historian of Indian and Eastern Architecture, and indeed of all architecture, must be ever identified. This too was a period of troubles and anxieties, augmented as they were in 1846 by the death of his father, whose memory he has preserved in the interesting work previously referred to.\n\nFergusson, when he founded the house of business before mentioned in partnership with his elder brother William, had always intended to leave it at the earliest opportunity, and he did so, returning home to build his house in Langham Place, and, having known the pleasures as well as the discomforts of a planter's life, to keep a very tolerable stable. But he committed the fatal mistake of leaving his name in the Calcutta house, and was therefore partly responsible for its debts and liabilities when the ultimate failure of the business was announced. He had, in conjunction with Mr. (now Sir) A. H. Layard, been the adviser of the Crystal Palace Company in the erection of the Assyrian House in the tropical end of the building (since destroyed by fire), and the author of the Handbook describing that structure; and at the juncture just alluded to he accepted the request of the Company to be their General Manager, a post which he entered early in 1856, and occupied till the middle of 1858. The practical details of the Handel Festival, which still exist with hardly a modification, were all settled by him, in reference to the first Festival in 1857. On leaving the Crystal Palace, he became Secretary to a Bengal Railway, an office which he relinquished after a short period of service.\n\nFergusson's second public contribution to the study of\nIndian architecture was made in 1848, in a Paper read to the Institute of British Architects, on the *Ancient Buddhist Architecture of India*, which is the first article from his pen printed in the *Transactions* of that body. This was followed, almost immediately, by the independent publication of a book, described by him at the close of his days as the best he had ever written, and of which he thought he had sold four copies, entitled, \"*An Historical Enquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art, more especially with reference to Architecture,*\" etc. The preface contains a reference to his earlier career, which possesses some social if not historical interest. Offering excuses for the defects of his ambitious task, he says: \"In the first place, few men have, either from education or the professional pursuits of their life, been less prepared for such a work as this. From boyhood I was destined to the desk. From school I passed to the counting-house; from that to an indigo factory\u2014of all places in the world, perhaps, the one least suited for a cultivation of any knowledge of the fine arts; from this to become an acting and active partner in a large mercantile establishment, from the trammels of which, in spite of every endeavour, I have never been able to free myself; and during the time this work has been in hand I have written, and, perhaps, also thought, more about the state of the money-market, indigo, sugar, silk and such-like articles, than I have regarding architecture, painting, or sculpture. This, in ordinary times, would only have delayed the work, and rendered its completion less speedy; but the last eighteen months have been times of anxiety and distress to every one connected with mercantile pursuits, and more especially to those connected with the East. All those with whom I was formerly connected have succumbed one after the other. The whole edifice under whose shade I have passed my life has been swept away, and there has been nothing but ruin and misery around me.\"\nHe does not, however, omit to mention his obligations to the late Mr. Edwin Norris, an old Member of this Society, more especially for the ethnographical portions of his book, and for the assistance which Mr. Norris, from his extraordinary knowledge of languages, was enabled to render. Another quotation from the same preface will serve to illustrate the independence of spirit in which he approached his subject, and partly account, perhaps, for some of the animosities he afterwards encountered, particularly among archaeologists, while forcing his facts and theories\u2014his \"harsh and unfashionable doctrines,\" as he termed them\u2014into unwilling ears. He says: \"I have also had the good fortune to spend the best years of my life in countries where Art, though old and decrepit, still follows the same path that led it towards perfection in the days of its youth and vigour, and, though it may be effete, it is not insane. In the East, men still use their reason in speaking of art, and their common sense in carrying their views into effect. They do not, as in modern Europe, adopt strange hallucinations that can only lead to brilliant failures; and, in consequence, though we may feel inclined to despise results, they are perfection itself compared with what we do, when we take into account the relative physical and moral means of the Asiatic and the Anglo-Saxon... A course of study pursued among the products of art themselves in this manner I have found far more instructive than books of theories are or perhaps ever can be; and I believe all would find it so if they could follow it in such circumstances as would prevent their being influenced by the errors of bad education, or free them from the trammels of the stereotyped opinions of the age. The belief that it has been so to me induces me now to publish the result of my experience. I believe I see the path which other and cleverer men have mistaken; and as the veriest cripple who progresses in the right direction will beat the strongest pedestrian who chooses a wrong path, I trust to being able to instruct even those\nbefore whose superior knowledge and abilities I would otherwise bow in silence.\"\n\nAt the end of the same preface he tells how he had even then put aside entirely the subject of that volume to give every thought and every spare moment to the science of fortification, his head being wholly filled with \"walls of brick and mounds of earth of the most murderous form and most utilitarian ugliness.\" In 1849 he published his *Proposed New System of Fortification*, the main feature of which was the proposal of earthworks in place of masonry\u2014then a most unfashionable doctrine, though now universally adopted. He further illustrated his ideas by printing a pamphlet entitled *The Perils of Portsmouth, or French Fleets and English Forts*, the third edition of which appeared in 1853, whereby he forcibly directed public attention to the dangerous insecurity of that great military and naval port; and this was followed in 1856 by a sequel entitled *Portsmouth Protected... with Notes on Sebastopol and other Sieges during the Present War*. The reputation obtained from these works caused him to be appointed a Member of the Royal Commission for the Defences of the United Kingdom.\n\nHe contributed to the *Transactions* of the Institute of British Architects papers of great value, namely, in 1849, on *The History of the Pointed Arch*; in 1850, on *The Architecture of Southern India*; in 1851, on *The Architecture of Nineveh*; in 1854, on *The Architectural Splendour of the City of Bijapur, and The Great Dome of Muhammad's Tomb, Bijapur*. The following year appeared his *Illustrated Handbook of Architecture*, in two volumes, a work undertaken by him at the request of Mr. John Murray, and afterwards enlarged into four closely printed, profusely illustrated octavo volumes, containing the *History of Ancient and Medi\u00e6val Architecture* (2 vols.), the *History of the Modern Styles of Architecture* (1 vol.), and the *History of Indian and Eastern Architecture* (1 vol.), the last one bearing the date of 1876,\nand it may be added that of all the many volumes which bear Fergusson's name on the title-page these are perhaps the only works from which he derived any emolument, the majority of his writings having been brought out at his own cost for the edification of a necessarily small number of readers.\n\nAn important characteristic of Fergusson's labours lay in the courage with which he maintained the opinions he had once given to the world. All or most of his so-called theories were started early in life, and they were seldom if ever withdrawn as untenable, though capable, as he often admitted, of obvious modification. In his first great architectural effort, *The Principles of Beauty*, &c., published in 1848, he devoted a portion (pp. 385\u2013393) to the mode in which the ancient Greek Temples were lighted. It seemed to him, even then, absurd to suppose that while the Egyptians had been so long familiar with the \"clearstory,\" by which he translated the word \u1f40\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd, the architects of ancient Greece should have remained in ignorance of it, and he contended that they were too artistic, either to shut out the light of day from their temples, as some thought, or to expose an ivory statue to the atmosphere even of Athens, as the text of Pausanias was interpreted to imply. He treated the same subject on a precisely similar basis at a meeting of the Institute of British Architects in 1861; and having prepared a large model of the Parthenon, complete, with its roof and \"clearstory,\" as he believed it originally existed, he wrote as late as 1883, *The Parthenon: an Essay on the mode by which light was introduced in Greek and Roman Temples*\u2014a subject of the utmost interest to architects and artists, as well as to archaeologists, but one which, during all the years that passed while he was writing about it, failed to elicit anything like enthusiasm either from theoretical critics or from practical men. On other ground further east Fergusson's perseverance was attended with more immediate success. In 1847 he published a work in large octavo form entitled *An Essay on the*\nAncient Topography of Jerusalem, grounded on the plans and measurements of Catherwood, Arundale, and Bonomi, who by a singular chance had been employed by the Turks to repair the so-called \"Mosque of Omar\" in Jerusalem, and had seized the opportunity to make complete drawings of the edifice. In this remarkable essay he contended that the present Church of the Holy Spulchre does not cover the true burial-place of our Saviour, but that the true site of the Holy Sepulchre is the \"Dome of the Rock,\" where the \"Mosque of Omar\" now stands, which building he believed, from the evidence of the architecture, to be the identical Church erected by Constantine the Great over the tomb of our Saviour at Jerusalem. The work fell, to use his own word, \"stillborn.\" But in 1860 an article appeared in the Edinburgh Review, on \"The Churches of the Holy Land,\" and Fergusson replied to it, the following year, with a pamphlet entitled Notes on the Site of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, in which he repeated his contention and concluded with expressing his belief that in a very short time it would be generally acknowledged that he was right. A storm of opposition to this theory was thereby raised, but at the same time the idea of making an accurate survey of the Holy City was induced by the novel views he advocated, and carried out at the cost of Miss Burdett Coutts by Capt. C. W. Wilson, R.E. At the same time his personal influence was rapidly increasing, and his views gained adherents. We have it on the authority of Sir George Grove, his colleague at the Crystal Palace, his collaborateur in the Dictionary of the Bible, and throughout his intimate friend and warm champion, that the Palestine Exploration Fund had its origin in a remark of Fergusson's addressed to him during the building of the Assyrian house in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, in the year 1853\u2014a complaint that there was no exhaustive and accurate Concordance of the Proper Names of the Bible. Nor did he confine himself to influence.\nHis purse was open for the prosecution of his favourite investigations, when he had confidence in the investigator. The first large map of the Haram Area at Jerusalem was drawn at his cost. In a letter to *The Times*, published on the 17th of January, 1886, about a week after Fergusson's death, Colonel Sir C. W. Wilson, R.E., wrote: \"It was Mr. Fergusson who enabled me to make those tentative excavations at Jerusalem in 1865, which led the way to the better known, and much more extensive excavations which were afterwards carried out by Sir Charles Warren for the Palestine Exploration Fund. In forwarding the necessary funds Mr. Fergusson, with characteristic fairness, wrote 'Dig wherever you like; you cannot dig anywhere without adding something to our knowledge of Jerusalem; and if you want more money, you can have it.' It is also no secret, I believe, that Mr. Fergusson was prepared to pay the cost of certain excavations in the Haram area, on the result of which he acknowledged his theories must stand or fall, and that the persistent refusal of the Sultan to allow excavations to be made in that area alone prevented him from putting his theories to practical test.\" His views on Jerusalem topography and on the Temple are given in a condensed form in two remarkable articles in the late Dr. William Smith's *Dictionary of the Bible*, vols. i. and ii.\n\nFergusson continued his inquiries into the subject with unabated persistency, and in 1878 published a work of more than three hundred quarto pages, fully illustrated with plates and woodcuts, on *The Temples of the Jews and the other buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem*, in which he maintained his original opinions in respect of the Mosque of Omar, as being the original church erected by Constantine, and developed them by learned and minute historical references.\n\nThe facts brought to light by the publication of the Marquis de Vogu\u00e9's book on *Syrie Centrale*, formed a subject of intense\ninterest to him, and through his influence the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture, which has been given annually since 1848 by Her Majesty the Queen to some architect or man of science of any country, was offered to and accepted by the Marquis in 1879. Nor is it any secret that the recommendations for this honour, made by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1883 on behalf of Mr. Penrose, and in 1885 on behalf of Dr. Schliemann, were brought about by Fergusson's earnest advocacy. Some years previously, in 1871, he had received it himself for \"patient and zealous industry, and power, as an architectural historian, and for the faithfulness, ability, and truthfulness with which he had fulfilled his task,\" the words used by the late Thomas H. Wyatt, when, as President, he presented the Royal Medal to Fergusson.\n\nIn 1867 Fergusson described to this Society the Amravati Tope in Gantur, and illustrated his subject with the aid of photographs and casts. This was the year of the great Exposition Internationale at Paris, where, with the consent of the British Government, a large collection of photographs of Indian architecture, including the Tope, was being exhibited in the Indian Court, and the facts connected with the collection are so identified with Fergusson and his method of research, and are also so interesting, told as they are by himself, that they should find a place in his Memoir. Having just completed the History of Architecture, and enjoying, consequently, some leisure, he accepted, on the suggestion of the late Sir Henry Cole, the task of arranging a number of photographs of Indian architecture, for the Paris Exhibition, and he proposed that some casts of sculpture or some architectural fragments should be added, to enable students to judge of the merit of the objects from actual specimens of the work. But the necessity of making such casts was obviated by the discovery that portions of an Indian monument\u2014the Amravati Tope\u2014were then in London.\nThese marbles had been excavated as far back as 1845, and sent to Madras, where they had lain exposed to wind and rain for some ten or twelve years. They had then been sent to England, and no room having been found for them in the India Museum, they were deposited at Fife House, in a disused coach-house, where Fergusson found them. The marbles were then photographed, the photographs were pieced together, and thereby two elevations of the outer Rail, and one of the inner Rail, of the Amravati Tope, were obtained. \"During the three or four months,\" to use his own words, \"which I had spent poring over these photographs, I had not only become familiar with their forms, but had acquired a considerable amount of unexpected knowledge of ancient Indian art and mythology\"\u2014the greater part of which, he afterwards adds, was quite new to him.\n\nThese marbles and photographs, and the Paper respecting them contributed to this Society, were the prelude to a work which was prepared by Fergusson under the authority of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and published by the India Office in 1868, namely, *Tree and Serpent Worship: or Illustrations of Mythology and Art in India, in the first and fourth centuries after Christ, from the Sculptures of the Buddhist Topes at Sanchi and Amravati*. Lord Iddesleigh, then Sir Stafford Northcote and in office, had entered warmly into Fergusson's views on this subject, and the Council had granted permission, and also the necessary funds, to publish all the information then possessed regarding the Amravati Tope; moreover Fergusson in the course of his investigations at the Library of the India Office had lighted on a beautiful series of drawings of the Sanchi Tope made in 1854, and at the same time there arrived from India a set of photographs of the same monument. The result was eminently gratifying to Fergusson, and a very valuable work, upon a subject which may ultimately obtain further elucidation, was thus placed at public disposal for a com-\nparatively small sum\u2014a work to which General Cunningham and others contributed important appendices.\n\nThe perplexed questions connected with megalithic remains next occupied Fergusson's attention, although the subject was not unfamiliar to him, seeing that he had written an article on Stonehenge, which appeared, in July 1860, in the Quarterly Review, and another in the same Review in April 1870, which was entitled \"Non-Historic Times.\" His contention with regard to these singular and inexplicable remains was that they are by no means so old as antiquaries wish to believe, and his Rude Stone Monuments in all Countries: their Age and Uses, treated of remains known to exist not only in Europe, but also in Asia and America.\n\nPrior to this, a new post had been created at the Office of Her Majesty's Works and Public Buildings, with the avowed object of securing Fergusson's services there. In January, 1869, he was appointed by the then First Commissioner (Mr. A. H. Layard) \"Secretary of Works and Buildings,\" but the business he was expected to do was not to his taste. A Committee was consequently called together, consisting of two Treasury officials and the late Mr. Austin, who stated in their Report that the First Commissioner required the aid of an officer conversant in a high degree with architecture, in reference to questions connected with existing or contemplated buildings, and on their advice Fergusson's new title was altered to \"Inspector of Public Buildings and Monuments.\" His recommendations, however, were not adopted in one important instance, namely, that of the recently-erected Royal Courts of Justice, and he retired at the first opportunity which offered. The fact was much to be regretted, not for Fergusson's, but for the country's sake, and a Memorandum (11 March 1869) on the subject of the appointment is in the highest degree instructive. In it Sir A. H. Layard wrote that the office held by Fergusson was one imperatively required for the public service, and that \"had\nsuch an officer been connected with the Office of Works, many things which have brought discredit on the Department might have been avoided.\"\n\nFergusson was often consulted on architectural questions by authorities of various kinds, and buildings were erected from his designs, notably the picture gallery containing Miss North's wonderful paintings in Kew Gardens, in which he put into actual practice his life-long theory of the mode of lighting Greek temples. He was also an active member of the several committees engaged in the difficult task of completing St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nBetween his first and second contribution to the Journal of this Society a gap of years intervenes. These contributions are:\n\nVol. VIII. (Original Series) Art. II.\u2014On the Rock-cut Temples of India, read 5th December, 1843, containing 10 plates.\n\nVol. III. (New Series) Art.

(New Series) page 105.\u2014Remarks on Mr. Robert Sewell's \"Note on Hiouen-Thsang's Dhanakacheka.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Art. IX.\u2014On the Saka, Samvat, and Gupta Eras, being a supplement to the author's paper on Indian Chronology.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 page 139.\u2014Notes on Babu R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra's paper on the age of the Caves at Ajunta.\n\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, whose name is last mentioned, is the author of many papers connected with Indian Archaeology,\nas well as of two considerable works, one of which (on Buddha G\u00e1ya) was published under the orders of the Government of Bengal, and the other (on the Antiquities of Orissa) under those of the Government of India, he having been attached to an arch\u00e6ological mission which, in 1869, visited the Katak Caves, examined hurriedly by Fergusson in 1837. The result not being satisfactory to the latter, he urged the desirability of sending another expedition to these Caves, under European guidance, and offered to pay the expenses of it should the Government decline to bear them. This led to a controversy of somewhat acrimonious character, and the strength of Fergusson's convictions was often expressed by him with an almost unnecessary strength of language, which may, however, be largely excused on account of the personal character of many of the attacks with which he was assailed. Irritated and indignant, he published, perhaps unwisely, in 1884, a pamphlet entitled Archaeology in India, in which, as he wrote in the preface, he took an opportunity of saying a few last words on some points of that subject which recent study had rendered clearer to him than they were before, and Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitr\u00e1's works became a convenient peg on which to hang his observations. But in such discussions, especially upon Indian matters, even his opponents were his debtors. Fergusson, by his individual efforts, without a jot of encouragement from the Government, with no existing criteria which could enable him to form a judgment of the age or style of the buildings he was studying, classified them, and laid the solid foundations of an architectural chronology for Hindustan. Undoubtedly some of the most remarkable edifices of that country had been visited and partially described, both by the illustrious Fran\u00e7ois Bernier and by other travellers, French and English, of the seventeenth century, as well as by later writers, among whom Heber may be prominently mentioned, and these edifices had been even drawn, though imperfectly, by Daniell\nand others. But until Fergusson began to systematize the result of his laborious examinations and to publish his studies of the historical monuments in stone and marble scattered over the face of India, the mass of these and their mutual affinities were like a sealed book to the learning and intelligence of the world. It is not too much to assert that the present votaries of Indian research owe to him the means of checking historical tradition by easy reference to the substantial records with which, principally through his works, they are now familiar.\n\nIt would not be right to terminate a memoir written for this Society without mentioning the Paper which Fergusson contributed to the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, for August 1863, on \"Recent Changes in the Delta of the Ganges.\" He had resided as a planter for five years on the banks of one of the most active of the Bengal rivers, and had been a witness of some of the changes he described. When, as he states, he first became aware of the disturbance that was taking place around him, he set himself to measure and observe what was passing, and in 1835 made a sketch survey of the Lower Ganges and Brahmaputra from Jaffergunge to the sea. This was published soon afterwards, and his Paper read to the Geological Society was illustrated with a map of the rivers of Bengal showing the changes since Rennell's survey. Such wide versatility of genius was all the more remarkable from the fact that his views on subjects of the most varied nature requiring study and ability of the most distinct character, and information from sources totally opposed to and distant from each other, were neither superficial nor cursory, but on the contrary were carefully thought out and illustrated generally with direct evidence of skill and learning. Besides those enumerated, he has written articles for periodicals, and letters without end which have been published in the newspapers, and his last contribution of this kind appeared in the Nineteenth Century,\nfor November 1885, on \"The Restoration of Westminster Hall.\" Seized the following month with a second attack of paralysis, he died on the 9th of January, 1886, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.\n\n\"Those,\" says an old and intimate associate, \"who only knew Fergusson in a business or an official capacity, and thus came into contact with his rough exterior alone, can have little idea of what a very affectionate and even tender side there was to his character. To those whom he loved he was devoted, and the number was greater than many would suspect. As a son and a brother few equalled him in unwearied care and thoughtful attention; and besides relatives, there are many friends of all classes who would gladly testify\u2014if such things were not too sacred for open testimony\u2014to the charm of his friendship, the firm attachment with which he had inspired them during a long intercourse of unvarying pleasantness, and their deep sorrow at his death.\"\n\nMr. Edward Thomas,\u00b9 C.I.E., F.R.S., the learned Numismatist and Indian Antiquary, who had been for nearly forty years a Member, and for twenty-five years, Treasurer of the Royal Asiatic Society, died on Wednesday, the 10th February, at his house, in Victoria Road, Kensington, after an illness of some weeks' duration. Having passed through the prescribed ordeal of study at Haileybury, he went out in 1832 to India, in the service of the Hon. East India Company, as a writer on the Bengal establishment. Owing to continued ill-health, which necessitated change of air and scene, his career in the East was more than once interrupted by absence on medical certificate, and his abilities and usefulness had not the same opportunity for display as would in other circumstances have been offered. Consequently, notwithstanding his many claims to distinction and promotion, he retired on his civil service annuity in 1857, devoting\n\n\u00b9 The greater part of this memoir, and list of writings which accompanies it (by Mr. Stanley Lane Poole, M.R.A.S.), have already appeared in the Athen\u00e6um.\nhimself thenceforward to those literary and scientific pursuits which had, to a great extent, been the charm if not the recognized business of his life. A constant attendant at the meetings of societies, he wrote a long series of essays and articles on many branches of Indian and old Persian Archaeology.\n\nThe services he rendered to science by breaking ground in a dozen obscure subjects\u2014such as Bactrian, Sassanian, and Indo-Scythic coins, Indian metrology, Sassanian gems and inscriptions\u2014are admittedly very great. Ever eager to turn his researches to practical account, he would sometimes hasten fearlessly to express his views, even in an embryo state, upon a new discovery, or to explain the bearings of a new point that had struck him in his constant and patient study of Indian antiquities. Indeed, it would not have been difficult to trace the gradual progress into shape of the new thought in a series of amended proof-sheets. But this promptness in publishing fresh data served as a stimulating impulse to other students, and it would be hard to say how many branches of study previously unexplored Mr. Thomas set on foot by one or other of his suggestive papers in the transactions of learned societies. He had the genius of the archaeologist for detecting analogies and relations, and he was a palaeographer of a very high order. He made many mistakes\u2014as scholars must do if they prefer premature hatching to prolonged incubation\u2014but he also advanced every study he took up, and gave it a fresh impetus, and often a new and accurate direction.\n\nLike De Quincey's, Mr. Thomas's works were mainly contributed to periodicals; but instead of Blackwood or Tait's, he wrote for such learned journals as those of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, as the Numismatic Chronicle and the Indian Antiquary. Many of his papers were afterwards collected in book form, and one such collection is his well-known \"Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Dehli\" (1847), which went to a second and greatly\nenlarged edition in 1871, and will always remain a standard work for Indian numismatists. Another important undertaking was his edition of James Prinsep's \"Essays on Indian Antiquities,\" with the \"Useful Tables,\" 2 vols., 1858, which he enriched with many valuable notes, and rendered, despite its want of order, an indispensable work of reference for archaeologists. His last great enterprise was the editing of what was intended to form a cyclop\u00e6dia of Eastern numismatics\u2014the \"International Numismata Orientalia\"\u2014of which nine parts, mainly written by leading authorities, have appeared between 1874 and 1885, and many more have been arranged for. Besides his constant literary activity, he was an energetic member of various learned societies, in whose proceedings he took a lively interest. The Royal Asiatic Society loses in him an excellent Treasurer and an invaluable Member of Council; and has recorded its deep appreciation of its loss in a special minute. Those who attend the Monday meetings at Albemarle Street will miss the familiar figure that regularly abandoned the temptations of the Athen\u00e6um Club to attend the Council of the Asiatic. Other societies owed much to Mr. Thomas's energy and experience; and his quick temper, intolerant of opposition (as became an Indian official of the old school), gave him an almost autocratic authority on subjects which he had made his own. No man has done more by personal influence, as well as by his writings, to encourage the study of Oriental antiquities in England. His conclusions may sometimes be erroneous, his theories\u2014say, of primitive Indian coinage and metrology\u2014fanciful, and his mode of expression peculiar; but his solid services to archaeology have been many and varied, and no one can dispense with his guidance in the numerous fields of research which he has opened to exploration. The Royal Society recognized his work by electing him a Fellow, the French Institute made him a Correspondent, and the Queen decorated him with the Order of the Indian Empire.\nThe following is a chronological list (with abbreviated titles) of the chief writings of the deceased:\n\n1846.

On the 27th of last month the grave closed on one whose life-long service in England's distant empire merits a brief notice.\n\nWilliam Rose Robinson entered the Madras Civil Service in 1842, having passed the two previous years at Haileybury College. On first arrival he had, as usual, to acquire a knowledge of the local languages, and was then employed in the Revenue Department in various districts. Limited as the opportunities of displaying marked ability necessarily are in subordinate positions, he soon evinced the qualities which distinguished him to the last\u2014untiring zeal and indomitable energy, independence of thought, and fearlessness in asserting\n\n1 This memoir is supplied by a friend and brother civilian.\nand doing what he believed to be right, and the entire sub-\nordination of every personal consideration to the performance\nof duty. His was never the perfunctory discharge of official\nbusiness during \"office hours,\" his whole time and every\nthought were given to his work: the pleasures of society, and\neven the comforts of home life, were sacrificed without hesita-\ntion whenever duty required. By general consent no one\nwas more thoroughly conversant than he with the character\nand disposition of the people and their peculiar land tenures and\ncustoms, and this knowledge was turned to good account\nin after years when he rose to positions of influence and\nauthority.\n\nIt is impossible here to follow him throughout his lengthened\ncareer, embracing service in every district of his presidency,\nand also in Calicut, where he took a prominent part in the\nframing of various legislative enactments and police measures.\nOne or two instances of special work may, however, be noted.\nAs quite a young civilian he was sent by the Madras Govern-\nment to the Laccadive Islands, where famine and \"a scourge\nof scurvy\" were rife, to supply the inhabitants with food and\nmedicine. Accompanied by a few native officials, he left\nCalicut for the scene of his labours, and remained at his post\nfor some months, the only European in that comparatively\nstrange locality. His comprehensive description of the islands\nform the subject of an instructive and interesting article in the\nMadras Journal of Literature and Science for the second half\nof 1847. It was on the occasion of one of his visits there that\na ship, through stress of weather, was driven ashore, and that\nhis gallant and official services in helping to save the crew and\n\nThe following incident will show the energy Mr. Robinson brought to bear\nupon his work in India from his first arrival in the country. Very shortly after\nhe joined his first appointment as assistant to the Collector of Canara, the civil\nengineer in his circuit visited Mangalore, when an improvement of its harbour\nwas suggested; but nothing could be done because there was no one of the Public\nWorks Department available to make the necessary surveys. Before the engineer's\nnext visit, however, the young Assistant-Collector had taught himself surveying,\nand prepared a map of the harbour with its soundings ready for his use.\ncargo earned him the award of salvage money from the owners.\n\nHe was at a later period employed in the Malabar district, and earned marked distinction during the troublous times when Moplah fanaticism culminated in the murder of the magistrate, Mr. Conolly (1855).\n\nBut the crowning work of his career was unquestionably the organization of the police of the Madras Presidency. The condition of that force had long been a cause of deep concern to the Government; its inefficiency was shown by the prevalence of crime undetected and unrepressed, and a painful belief in the venality and oppression of its native members was extensively current. The reform of this important branch of the administration was entrusted, in 1858, to William Robinson, and, undeterred by the magnitude and difficulty of the task, he undertook it single-handed, and so well performed it that when, in the ordinary course of the service, he would in his standing have been entitled to promotion and higher emoluments in other departments, his Government sought special sanction for such an increase to his allowances as would enable them to retain his services when they were so peculiarly valuable to the State, without subjecting him to pecuniary loss. It is difficult to exaggerate the magnitude of the work. His scheme was not composed in the quietude of his own study, or on the mere reports and suggestions of others; on the contrary, he visited every district of the Presidency, and, seeing for himself, and conferring with the local magistracy and others, submitted to his Government a plan of reorganization for each district complete in every respect, in accordance with the general principles previously laid down by him and approved by them. His plans provided for every detail of police administration, and included also the readjustment of the existing territorial divisions in order to provide funds, the relation of the force to the magistracy, the relief by the police of the numerous small detachments of military scattered\nabout the country, guarding treasuries and jails to the prejudice of military discipline, the framing of police regulations and laws, and other important matters. The mental and physical strain was indeed great, and he had also formidable difficulties to contend with, in the inert hostility of native officials of the old school, and especially in the submissive character of the people, affording no extraneous check to malpractices or oppression by the police. The force was at first entirely officered from the army, and the invidious task of selecting officers was, by universal consent, discharged by Mr. Robinson with the most absolute disregard of every consideration save that of fitness for the duty.\n\nIn 1866 Sir William was selected to be one of the first recipients of the honour of the Companionship of the Star of India. The following year he left the police force, which he had not only instituted but personally governed with admitted success, leaving to his successors a comparatively facile task. Experience has now proved the soundness of the principles he adopted; and the police administration of the Madras Presidency remains the enduring monument of his official career.\n\nIn 1869 Mr. Robinson was made a member of the Revenue Board and Inam Commissioner, and in 1873 a Member of Council of the Madras Government; and on the death of Lord Hobart in May, 1875, he became acting Governor, which post he held for seven months, and until the arrival of His Grace the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. On the 31st December he was raised to the dignity of a Knight of the Star of India. Of his work in these last years of his Indian service it is enough here to say that, like all his work, it was characterized by unceasing energy and diligence.\n\nSir W. Robinson retired from the service on the 5th December, 1878, and finding no means of further serving his country and the land in which he had spent a lifetime, betook\nhimself to the work of charity, becoming an active member of several societies, and\n\n\"Life's race well run,\nLife's work well done,\nLife's crown well won,\"\n\nhe passed to his rest on the 27th April last. The numbers assembled round his grave afforded silent testimony of his worth. Friends who had known him and his work in the days gone by, and friends who had only known but yet learned to value him, since his withdrawal from the scene of his life-long labours, now gathered round it, paying their last tribute of love and esteem.\n\nWe gather from *The Nation* that Professor Gustavus Seyffarth, the learned German archaeologist, died at New York on the 17th of November last, in his eighty-ninth year. Born in Saxony and educated in Leipsic, he was appointed Professor of Archaeology in the latter place at the age of 30.\n\n\"He turned his attention to Egyptian studies, and disputed with Champollion the authorship of the now accepted theory of hieroglyphics. In 1855 he came to the United States and was for six years a Professor in the Lutheran Seminary of St. Louis. In 1857 he published in this city a 'Summary of Recent Discoveries in Biblical Chronology, Universal History, and Egyptian Archaeology,' in English and German. He was a constant contributor to European and American periodicals.\"\n\nDr. Seyffarth had been on the List of Foreign Members of the Royal Asiatic Society since 1829, or for 57 years, and in 1834 presented its Library with a copy of the *Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss der Literatur, Kunst, Mythologie und Geschichte des Alten Egypten*, published at Leipsic in the previous year.\n\nHis long residence on the other side of the Atlantic severed him, as it were, from European literary circles; but the news of his recent death brings to remembrance the fact that the work done by him was in a wide field, and remains for the benefit of students in all quarters of the world.\nMr. Henry Louis St. Barbe, killed by dacoits in February of the current year, was a distinguished member of the Bengal Civil Service, which he joined in 1872. Removed to Burma within six months after his arrival in India, he filled several offices of importance in that country, and in 1879 was placed in charge of the Residency at Mandalay. His withdrawal from that station in October of that year was effected under stringent orders, and he afterwards became Assistant Agent to the Governor-General in Central India. In 1882, he returned from a two years' furlough to Europe, and in the following year his services were again utilized for the government of our possessions in the Far East. He was placed at the disposal of the Home Department, and appointed Deputy Commissioner of the fourth grade in British Burma, and posted to Bassein. It appears that while following dacoits in a steamer with a small force, he landed to reconnoitre, attended only by an orderly and guide. All three were shot: the bodies were removed by the captain of the steamer, who was wounded on the occasion. Mr. St. Barbe's death was not only a cause of deep sorrow to friends and relatives, but a heavy loss also to the Government he served with so much zeal and ability. As an Asiatic scholar, he may be mentioned as having passed examinations in Sh\u00e1n, Burmese, and Pali. He had been for about eight years a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, and contributed an article to the 10th Volume of the Journal under the heading of Burmese Transliteration.\n\nIn addition to the above, whose obituary notices may fairly demand admission in the Annual Report, as of members immediately forwarding the objects of this Society, there are recently deceased members who, from personal associations, or a certain position in the outer world, reasonably claim a passing mention, however brief.\n\nOf the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Travancore (R\u00e1ma Varm\u00e1, brother of Vanchi B\u00e1la R\u00e1ma Varm\u00e1), the Calcutta correspondent of the Times, in notifying his death in August, 1885, thus\nwrites:\u2014\"It is not too much to say that this event is a loss only less grave to the Indian Empire than to the particular State which he governed. Since he ascended the throne, five years ago, the late Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 has been known as the most enlightened and the most learned of native princes. He wrote and spoke English with ease, was well versed in several Indian vernacular languages, and was an accomplished Sanskrit scholar. He had travelled over a great part of India, and wherever he went he made himself thoroughly well acquainted with everything worthy of notice. As a youth he had the advantage of training under Sir Madhava R\u00e3o, the ablest of modern Native statesmen, and the first man to start Travancore on that path of progress which it has followed with so much success. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 was a firm friend of the British Government, and under his rule Travancore continued to advance in prosperity, and well deserved the epithet often applied to it\u2014the model native State of India.\n\nOn the 28th July, 1885, the Society lost in Sir Moses Montefiore, Bart., F.R.S.,\u00b9 a Member of 30 years' standing, who had completed his hundredth year in the preceding November. In early life he became a member of the Stock Exchange, and shortly amassed a large fortune. It was not, however, his ambition to become a millionaire, and he retired from business in 1825.\n\nIn 1827 Mr. Montefiore and his wife paid their first visit to the Holy Land, and on their way thither acquired the friendship of Muhammad 'Ali. They were cordially received at Jerusalem both by Jews and Gentiles, and spent some time there in prosecuting inquiries of interest. Sir Moses visited Palestine on six subsequent occasions. These visits were used as opportunities for the distribution of relief, and im-\n\n\u00b9 Abridged from an original memoir kindly supplied by F. D. Mocatta, Esq., M.R.A.S.\nprovement or establishment of works of education, sanitation and industry. In 1840 the blood accusations at Damascus, which occasioned the imprisonment of Jews and threatened them with horrible tortures, took Sir Moses, in company with M. Cr\u00e9mieux, to Alexandria and Constantinople. He obtained from Muhammad 'Ali the order for the release of the prisoners, and from the Sultan not only a firman entirely exculpating the Jews from the offences with which they were charged, but one of general toleration for them throughout the whole of the Turkish Empire. In 1863, he obtained a confirmation of this firman by the new Sultan Abdul 'Aziz, and in 1864, when in his 80th year, his present influence at Morocco gained for him a similar favour from the Sultan Sidi Muhammad for Jews in the Moorish States. Two journeys to Russia, where he was well received by the Emperors Nicholas and Alexander respectively, and one journey to Bucharest in the same cause, should also be here noted.\n\nHis final journey was his seventh visit to the Holy Land at the age of 90, in 1874. The last ten years of his life were passed in retirement at East Cliff Lodge near Ramsgate. He was, to the end, active in mind, and full of the projects to which he had devoted his life. He still directed an enormous correspondence, which flowed to him from all countries and in all languages, and still contributed largely to a number of benevolent enterprises, entirely ignoring diversities of creed or race. His appearance was dignified and commanding and, in old age, venerable in the extreme, with a charm of manner which was equally extended to poor and rich, to young and old. Chosen Sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1837, he was knighted in the same year; and about nine years later he received a Baronetcy from Her Majesty.\n\nThough wanting, in early life, the advantages of a very finished education, and never laying claim to scientific attain-\nments, the tastes and interests of Sir Moses were so general that he belonged to most of the learned societies of England. Of the Royal Society, in whose proceedings he always took much interest, he was elected a Fellow so far back as in 1836. His frequent journeys to the East, his efforts for the welfare of the Holy Land, and his intimate relations with many Oriental rulers and persons, may be considered also to have given Sir Moses Montefiore a fitting place among the Members of the Royal Asiatic Society, who will ever regard his memory with affection and respect.\n\nMr. Francis Mathew, M.I.C.E., who died on the 30th September, 1885, was, when in India, Chief Engineer, and, more recently in England, Consulting Engineer; of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway Company. He was a nephew of the celebrated Father Mathew.\n\nThe funeral in Westminster Abbey, on the 9th April last, of the Right Hon. W. E. Forster, bore plain testimony to the high esteem in which he was held by a very large section of official and public men irrespective of party. Although the memory of the deceased statesman was not directly associated with Asiatic literature, travel or research, yet his regard for India and the welfare of its people amply warrants the special mention of his name in the Obituary record of this Society. The busy character of his parliamentary life readily explains his rare attendance at its meetings; but it must not be forgotten that for 24 years he was one of its Resident Members. His personal history has been told elsewhere. It is that of a patriotic Englishman whose distinguished and honourable career sheds lustre on the country to which he belonged.\n\nAmong those Orientalists, not Members of the Society, who have died since the date of the last Annual Report, or between July 1885 and July 1886, may be mentioned Pandit Tara Nath Tarkavachaspati, for 30 years a Professor of Sanskrit in the college at Banaras: M. Brosset, an eminent\nGeorgian and Armenian scholar, in whose memory a monument has been erected at Tiflis; and the Hebrew scholar, Dr. Kalisch, the two last on the 22nd and 23rd August respectively. A Baptist Missionary, Dr. Nathan Brown, who died during the same year in Japan, had worked for 20 years in India, publishing there, in 1848, his Grammatical Notes of the Assamese Language, and in 1849 a translation of the New Testament into Assamese. On the 16th January 1886, His Excellency Subhi Pasha, a liberal patron of literature and science, died at Constantinople. He was the possessor of an Oriental Library of exceptional value. Dr. Jens Peter Broch, Professor of Semitic Languages in the University of Christiania for a quarter of a century\u2014said to have published the only book in the Arabic character ever printed in Norway\u2014died on the 15th March; and on the 17th idem, in his 92nd year, Leopold Zuns, the distinguished Talmudic scholar. To the above should be added, on the 27th April, Tobias Theodores, Professor of Oriental Languages at Owens College, Manchester, a scholar said to have been well acquainted with Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic, as well as Latin and Greek, and six modern European languages. Born at Posen in 1808, he came to England when a very young man, and engaged in commercial pursuits.\n\nThe Auditors submit the accompanying Account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Society, which will, they hope, be considered satisfactory.\n### ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1885.\n\n| Dec. 31, 1884. | RECEIPTS. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|----------------|-----------|--------|\n| Balances at Bankers', January 1, 1885 | 481 19 0 | |\n| 153 Resident Members | 185 9 0 | |\n| 1 Earl-Resident Member | 1 11 6 | |\n| 189 Non-Resident Members | 685 10 0 | |\n| Arrears\u20148 Non-Resident Members In advance | 6 6 6 | |\n| Compositors' Allowance &c., (for charges) | 20 9 4 | |\n| Donation from the India Office | 210 0 0 | |\n| Dividend on Consols | 27 12 2 | |\n| Rents\u2014University Extension Society | 117 0 0 | |\n| British Association | 80 0 0 | |\n| Numismatic Society | 15 15 9 | |\n| Sale of Publications | 10 10 0 | |\n| Total Receipts | 1403 19 9 | |\n\n| Dec. 31, 1885. | EXPENDITURE. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|----------------|--------------|--------|\n| Rents\u2014House | 300 0 0 | |\n| Water Rate | 9 10 0 | |\n| Income Tax | 5 0 0 | |\n| Fire Insurance | 100 18 0 | |\n| Salaries\u2014Secretary | 148 18 0 | |\n| Assistant Secretary | 24 14 0 | |\n| Journal\u2014Printing (for Vol. XVII.) | 247 17 7 | |\n| Books purchased bound | 40 5 3 | |\n| Stationery and Miscellaneous Printing | 45 11 7 | |\n| Postage and parcels | 3 8 0 | |\n| Bank Charges and Cheque Book | 2 17 0 | |\n| House Expenses | 114 14 10 | |\n| Investment | 36 0 0 | |\n| Total Expenditure | 1403 19 9 | |\n\nBalance at Bank, Dec. 31 | \u00a31403 19 9 |\n\nAmount of Society's Funds, Three per cent.

By J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., Litt.D., C.M.G., etc., etc.\n\nFour numbers of part 1, vol. liv. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1885), contain much interesting matter. In No. 1, Mr. Atkinson continues his learned \u201cNotes on the History of Religion in the Himalaya of the N.W. Provinces,\u201d confining his remarks almost wholly to the funeral ceremonies, which are well worthy of study as illustrative of the character of the people by whom they are practised. The last service for the dying\u2014preparation of the body for the pyre-office for cremation\u2014procedure after cremation, with the ceremonies belonging to each of twelve days, are all curious details. Mr. G. A. Grierson and \u0160r\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh edit and translate \u201cThe Battle of Kanarp\u00ed Gh\u00e1t, a poem, perhaps the most popular of its kind in Tirhut,\u201d written by a Maithil Brahman at the end of the last century, in the Baisw\u00e2r\u00ee dialect; and this is followed by Mr. Grierson single-handed, who, with his usual skill and industry, prepares for his reader the Bhojpur\u00ee and Magahi versions of the song.\nof Gopi Chand, and appends an English translation. Mr. C. J. Rodgers supplies information on some copper coins of Akbar, on coins of Ranjit Deo, Rajah of Jammu, struck in the last century, and on coins of Ahmad Shah Abdalli. The last give valuable testimony to historical data.\n\nIn No. 2 Mr. J. Boxwell, B.A., of the Bengal Civil Service, in his paper on the Trishtubh Metre, introduces some clever Latin renderings of Sanskrit verse.\n\nOf the Proceedings of the Bengal Asiatic Society, Nos. 1 to 10 (1885) contain notices and discussions in the several departments of Numismatics, Meteorology, and Natural History. The greater part of the papers alluded to have, however, been published in extenso in the Journal, and need not be here considered. At the monthly general meeting on the 1st July, the President, Dr. Rajendralala Mitra, C.I.E., exhibited five Sanskrit MSS. treating of Veterinary art, and gave an interesting analysis of them. The subject, he said, had not been hitherto noticed by any European Orientalist\u2014a circumstance due to the neglect it has experienced at the hands of modern Pandits, to whom the characteristics and diseases of horses offered no attraction. In ancient times it had been otherwise. Brahmins and scholars were kings and ministers, and the horse was looked upon as a \"vitaly important element of a kingdom.\" Tracing back the origin of Veterinary art in India to a period before the Aryans had separated into Greeks and Hindus, Dr. Mitra pointed out that eventually it became split into two parts\u2014one relating to cattle, and one to horses only. Of the former the most noted Professor was P\u00e1lak\u00e1pya: of the latter the earliest professor was \u015a\u00e1lihotra whose name appeared on a Hindi manuscript he had found, the name of the translator being Chetana. Other works noticed were those of Nakula, of D\u00edpa\u1e45kara, son of M\u00e1n\u00e1kara, and of Jayadatta, son of Vijayadatta. In the same number of the Proceedings (7) as that containing an account of these treatises, is\nrelated \"a Coincidence in Folk Lore\" by the Rev. Charles Swynnerton. The writer finds in the *liber facetiarum* of the 15th-century ecclesiastic, Poggio Bracciolini of Florence, the Italian counterpart of a folk-tale of the Upper Panjab which he had himself told in a recently published volume. It is the story of a husband moving up the current of a river to seek the body of his drowned wife, on the principle that she always, during life, took an opposite course to every other person. Such coincidences are certainly not rare; and Mr. Swynnerton is perhaps fully justified in arguing that the fables \"trace their original source to some common tribe or family of men, whether in Central Asia or elsewhere, whose descendants, extending themselves east and west over the world, carried their household words with them.\" The Annual Report of the Society for 1884 shows the total number of Members at the close of the year to be 326, of whom 102 are Resident, 157 Non-Resident, 12 Foreign, 15 Life, and 40 Non-Subscribing Members. A six years' average makes the total 336, of whom 282 are paying, and 54 non-paying.\n\nMention of the *Centenary Review of the Asiatic Society of Bengal* will be here appropriate. This goodly volume, which embraces the hundred years from 1784 to 1883 inclusive, is in three Parts, with an Appendix in the shape of Proceedings of the Special Century Meeting held on the 15th January, 1884. Part I. is the History of the Society by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, elected President in 1885. The learned native gentleman, in concluding his careful record, thus summarizes the great services rendered by the Society:\n\n1. It has provided for the use of scholars a commodious house valued at 150,000 Rupees.\n2. It has got up a library containing 30,000 volumes, of which upwards of 8000 are manuscripts.\n3. It has obtained a collection of ancient coins and medals valued at 10,000 Rupees.\n\n4. It has collected a small but valuable gallery of pictures and memorial busts.\n\n5. It has created an Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of considerable extent, a Geological Museum rich in Meteorites and Indian fossils, and a Zoological Museum all but complete as regards the Avi-fauna of India.\n\n6. It has published a total of 354 vols., including 21 vols. of the Asiatic Researches and Index, 84 vols. of the Journal and Index, 19 vols. of Proceedings, 167 vols. of Oriental works of different kinds, 31 vols. of miscellaneous works relating to India, 14 vols. of catalogues, and 18 vols. of Notices of Sanskrit Manuscripts.\n\nHis concluding words may be quoted as expressing an accepted fact: \"These are deeds which, for extent, variety and usefulness, may well claim the consideration of the public. They compare very favourably with the works of other and older Societies in other parts of the earth. To the student of science in India they have proved of invaluable service. And it is in view of these the Society this day celebrates its Centenary Jubilee.\"\n\nPart II. treats of Archaeology, History, Language and Literature; and is the work of Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle, the Philological Secretary. It has full and interesting Appendices. Part III. is devoted to Natural Science, and is by Mr. P. N. Bose. Appended to it is a Classified Index to the Scientific papers in the Society's Publications from 1788 to 1882.\n\nAmong the six Special Centenary Honorary Members lately created are three highly-esteemed Members of the London Society, Professor A. H. Sayce, M. S\u00e9nart, and Professor Sir Monier Monier-Williams.\n\nIn connection with the Bengal Asiatic Society may be mentioned the numerous fasciculi of the Bibliotheca Indica\nwhich have been added to our library during the current year (1886).

It contains the following twelve articles:\n\n1. On the Auchity\u00e2lamk\u00e1ra of Kshemendra, with a note on the date of Patanjali, by Professor Petersen.\n2. A note on B\u00e2dar\u00e2yana, author of the Brahma Sutras by the Hon. Kashinath Trimbak Telang, M.A., LL.D., C.I.E.\n3. A reply to Professor Petersen on the date of Patanjali, by Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, M.A.\n4. Five Copper Plate Grants of the Western Chalukya Dynasty, from the Karnul District, by J. F.

By Prof. Petersen.\n\nAmong these papers, Professor Bhandarkar\u2019s lectures are remarkable specimens of clear and well-reasoned argument, written in that kind of English which many well-educated young Englishmen might not scorn to imitate. Their publication in the Society\u2019s Journal appears to be an innovation in practice.\n\nCeylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014Since the\nTranslations from the P\u0101li and Proceedings noticed in the last Annual Report, no new publication has been received from Colombo.\n\nJournal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014In the December number (1884), besides a list of Members, the brief Annual Report and Proceedings, are to be found the following papers:\n\n1. Journey to the summit of Gunong Bubu, by the Rev. J. E. Tenison Woods.\n2. Continuation of a former paper on the Religions of the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak, by the Rev. J. Perham.\n3. The History of Perak from Native Sources, by the Hon. W. E. Maxwell.\n4. British North Borneo, by E. P. Gueritz, Esq.\n5. Jelebu, by H. A. O\u2019Brien, Esq.\n\nThese, however unpretending in themselves, all supply more or less valuable data for larger works on the history, politics, people, or geography of the places mentioned.\n\nOf the nine principal articles in the June number (1885), four are translations, one is an extract from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, and four are original contributions. All these last have geographical interest, especially the Journey from Ku\u00e2la Bernam (Straits of Malacca) to Ku\u00e2la P\u00e2hang (Chinese Seas): but the French Missionary\u2019s Journey from Bangkok to \u00dabon will attract the archaeologist also in its account of a ruined city. \u201cPuthai-saman,\u201d the explorer writes, \u201cwas an important town\u2014or perhaps rather an imposing temple erected to the worship of Buddha. It is one of those monuments of Cambodia which are so much renowned and which astonish all travellers by their original and beautiful architecture.\u201d The \u201cNotes and Queries\u201d issued with this number (15) of the Journal, are full of interesting local matter, bearing on history, language, law, folk-lore, social customs, games, etc. Though Penang and Perak may have\nthe lion's share, the scene is not limited to these localities. Malacca, Singapore, and even Borneo are included.\n\nNorth China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, New Series, vol. xviii. contains the following Articles:\u2014\n\nI. What did the Ancient Chinese know of the Greeks and Romans?\n\nII. Corea. Extracts from F. Scherzer's French Translation of the Chaou-hsien-chih, and Biographical Notice. Translated into English by Charles Gould.\n\nIII. Researches into the Geology of Formosa. By George H. J. Kleinw\u00e4chter.\n\nIV. Fragments d'un voyage dans l'interieur de la Chine. Par C.

Samshu Brewing in North China. By the same.\n\nVIII. Notes on Szechuen and the Yangtse Valley. By Archibald J. Little.\n\nVolume xix. pt. i. has the following papers:\u2014\n\nI. Animal, Fossil, Mineral and Vegetable Products of the Ichang Consular District. By C. T. Gardner, H.B.M. Consul.\n\nII. A Journey in Chekiang. By E. H. Parker, H.M. Acting-Consul.\n\nIII. A Journey in Fukien, with a map. By the same.\n\nIV. A Journey from Foochow to W\u00eanchow, through Central Fukien, with map. By the same.\n\nV. A Buddhist Sheet-Tract, translated with Notes. By the Rt. Rev. Bishop G. E. Moule, of Hangchow.\n\nVI. Trade Routes to Western China. By Alexander Hosie, of H.M. Consular Service.\nIn July, 1885, the Hon. Librarian addressed a printed circular from Shanghai to the several Societies with which the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society was in correspondence, stating that their Journal would henceforth be published in short instalments, instead of, as formerly, in annual volumes. Since that date the Royal Asiatic Society has received six numbers of the new publication (vol. xx. parts i. to vi. inclusive) of which the contents are now summarised:\n\nThe Hung Lou M\u00e9ng, or Dream of the Red Chamber, by Herbert Giles, President. On the Prevalence of Infanticide in China; a question discussed in writing and orally by selected and special authorities. The Mystery of Ta-Tsin, by G. M. H. Playfair. Chapter iv. of the Ching-Hua-Yuan, translated by C. B. T. What is Filial Piety? discussed by several writers. Is China a Conservative country? Anon. Sinology in Italy, by M. Nocentini. Western Appliances in the Chinese Printing Industry, by Mr. Hirth. Chinese Theatricals and Theatrical Plots, by several writers. The Seaports of India and Ceylon, by G. Phillips. Some additions to my Chinese Grammar, by G. von den Gabelentz; and an instructive article on Bibliography, giving a list of books and papers in China published since 1st January, 1884, compiled by Mr. Hirth. There are also to be found Proceedings, List of Members, and interesting Notes and Queries. Among the last, referring to the word Brangoye used in the chronicles of Bar Hebraeus, Dr. Edkins says, \"We can hardly doubt that it is the Persian word Farang applied after the Muhammadan conquests to Western nations generally.\" An extract from Sonnerat in Col. Yule's \"Glossary of Indian Terms\" (p. 269) gives almost the word itself: \"Ainsi un Europ\u00e9en est tout ce que les Indiens connaissent de plus m\u00e9prisable; ils le nomment Parangu\u00ef...\" But there can be no possible question on the identity of the words.\nJournal Asiatique, Serie viii. tome v. No. 3, Mai-Juin, 1885, contains the following papers:\n\nI. \"Etude sur les Inscriptions de Piyadasi,\" in which M. Senart continues his series of learned remarks on the Inscriptions of Piyadasi.\n\nII. \"Bibliographie Ottomane,\" in which M. Cl. Huart concludes his notice of Turkish, Arabic and Persian works published at Constantinople during the period 1299-1301 of the Hegira (1882-4).\n\nIII. \"Le Mariage par Achat dans l'Inde Aryenne,\" par M. L. Feer.\n\nIV. \"Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la Numismatique et de la Metrologie Musulmanes,\" being a further instalment of M. H. Sauvaire's papers on this subject.\n\nUnder \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes\" are M. Zotenberg's notice of the \"Livre de Barlaam et de Joseph\"; a review by M. S\u00e9nart of Sir Alfred Lyall's Asiatic Studies in their French guise; a paper by Dr. Saad on the Turko-Persian Frontier and Karbala Pilgrims; and part of a communication from M. Ren\u00e9 Basset to the editor, in which he mentions having discovered, in a list supplied to him at Algiers, four Arabic manuscripts of historical interest hitherto unknown.\n\nThe July number (vol. vi. No. 1) contains the Annual Report prepared by the Secretary, M. James Darmesteter. It is a paper of considerable interest, and may be perused with advantage by other readers than Orientalists. Among the death casualties of the Society during the foregone year mention is specially made of the former President, Jacques Auguste Antoine Regnier, editor and translator of the Pratisakhya of the Rig-Veda, a distinguished Sanskrit scholar and comparative philologist; also of the accomplished Stanislas Guyard, a skilful translator and critic, and withal a brilliant writer, to whose memory is paid a tribute of high but well-deserved praise. Installed, at the early age of 37, Professor of Arabic in the Coll\u00e8ge de France, he died shortly after delivering his\nopening address, described as a \"chef-d'\u0153uvre de concision et de pr\u00e9cision, digne de devenir classique, o\u00f9 il embrassait toutes les branches de ce domaine si vari\u00e9 et si vaste avec une aisance, une clart\u00e9, une hauteur d'aper\u00e7us qui, \u00e0 chaque ligne, r\u00e9v\u00e9laient un esprit ma\u00eetre d'un monde.\" Another helper, though not a member of the Society, Charles Huber, is honourably noticed for zeal and energy in epigraphic research, in connection with M. Eutig and our countryman Mr. Doughty.\u00b9\n\nIn vol. vi. No. 2, for August, September, and October, 1885, are:\u20141. A contribution by M. Masp\u00e9ro, Sur une Version Arabe du Conte de Rhampsinite. 2. Tchao-Sien-Tche, M\u00e9moire sur la Cor\u00e9e, by M. F. Scherzer, French Consul at Canton. 3. Origine des Ecritures Indiennes, by M. J. Hal\u00e9vy; and 4. Notes de Lexicographie Berb\u00e8re, by M. Ren\u00e9 Basset. Under \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes,\" it is notified that the July and October sittings have been discontinued; M. Bergaigne reviews M. Ludwig's interpretation of the chronology of the Rig Veda, and M. L. Feer remarks\n\n\u00b9 Of Huber's melancholy fate the following particulars recall the tragedy of the three Englishmen enacted only two years before, beside the Egyptian frontier, some five hundred miles nearer Europe:\u2014\n\nOn the night of the 26th July, 1884, he quitted Jedda to return to Haib, his head-quarters, where he had left the greater part of his luggage and collections. His intention was to explore Sadous, a distance of eight days' march to the S.S.E. of Haib, having learnt that some important ruins and inscriptions were to be seen there. Two days later he fell assassinated at Kassai Alia, almost at the very gates of Jedda. He had been accompanied from that town by his servant, Mahm\u00fad, and two guides. Mahm\u00fad had followed the road in charge of the baggage, while Huber and the guides had separated themselves to the right and left, in search of monuments and inscriptions. It had been agreed that all were to meet again at a certain halting-place, at which they were to take rest and refreshment. On the 29th, when Mahm\u00fad reached the appointed rendezvous, he saw Huber lying on the ground covered up in his Arab cloak, apparently asleep, and a little way off his guides engaged in prayer. He was about to unload the camels when he felt the muzzles of two barrels placed upon his breast, and heard one of the guides say, \"Throw away your arms, or we shall treat you as we did your master.\" Mahm\u00fad then observed for the first time that Huber was lying on the left side, and that the right side of his head was covered with blood, but that the body was in repose. He had been killed in his sleep by a pistol shot. Mahm\u00fad, after being kept prisoner for two days, managed to escape the assassins, and relate the story of his master's death to the French vice-consulate. Huber's body lay for two days exposed in the open air, but was at length buried by passers-by, who dug a ditch for the purpose.\nupon Dr. Duka's Life and Works of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s. There are also two short notices of a Persian translation of Azari-Turkish plays, and a fasciculus of the Annals of Tabari.\n\nIn No. 3 for November and December are:\u20141. The Brihatkathamanjari of Kshemendra in the Roman character, with a French translation, by M. Sylvain Levi. 2. Sur l'Origine de l'Ecriture Perse, by M. J. Hal\u00e9vy, and, 3. Les Quatrains de B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir 'Ury\u00e1n en Pehlevi Musulman, edited in the original and translated by M. Clement Huart. Under \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes\" mention is made of a paper read by M. Zotenberg on the origin of Gal'ad et Chimas, an Arab romance spoken of by writers in the fourth century, as also of a discussion on direct translations from the Sanskrit Kalila wa Dimna other than that in Pahlavi, and on the Teima inscriptions.\n\nVol. i. No i. for January, 1886, contains two articles only: L'Alchimiste; being M. Barbier de Meynard's French translation of the play, an English version of which, by Mr. Guy Le Strange, appeared in the January number of our own Journal. The simultaneous appearance of the two translations has been explained by Mr. Le Strange to be quite fortuitous. 2. Notes de Lexicographie Berb\u00e8re, by M. Ren\u00e9 Basset, continued. The \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes\" review Mr. Bendall's catalogue of Buddhist-Sanskrit MSS. in the Cambridge University Library; that of Professors Cowell and Eggeling for the Royal Asiatic Society; and that of M. Brian Hodgson's Sanskrit MSS. compiled by Dr. W. Hunter. They further notice an Arab account of the island of Jerba, translated by \"Exiga dit Kayser, interpr\u00e8te militaire,\" and published at Tunis.\n\nGerman Oriental Society.\u2014Vol. xxxix. part 2 contains the following papers:\u2014Dr. Samuel Kohn, a notice of the \"Bibliotheca Samaritana\" of Dr. M.

N\u00f6ldeke, Robertson Smith's \"Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia.\"\n\nArch\u00e6ology.\u2014The third annual report of Major Cole, the Curator of Ancient Monuments in India, shows that important work has been done during the year 1883-4. In the Bombay Presidency the chief operations have taken place at Bijapur. Sanction has been given for repairs to Sayid Usman's mosque and tomb at Ahmadabad. Major Cole has made long journeys, visiting most interesting ruins and monuments. He adds to his report certain weighty remarks upon the value of Indian Arch\u00e6ology apart from its influence upon the elucidation of the early history of the country.\n\nFour volumes of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India Reports have been added to the Library since July last year. Of these vol. xix. contains an account by Mr. H. B. W. Garrick, of a tour through Behar, Central India, Peshawar and Yusufzai. General Cunningham explains that his assistant, after photographing and exploring the old temples at Markandi, Mahadevpur, and Banarak, visited the sites of Bhojpur and Darauli in Western Shahabad, where he found square monoliths supposed to be the work of the aborigines. He further explored the remains of an old Buddhist monastery at\nBarm\u0101yan, the ancient city of G\u016brga in Rewa, and certain sites which had been unvisited in the Yusufzai district. Of the monastery no tradition of any kind has been preserved locally, but a golden image is said to be buried in its immediate neighbourhood; its main walls, which are in ruins and traced with difficulty, cover an area of 100 feet from north to south by 67 from east to west. General Cunningham had proposed to identify it with the monastery built by Maharaja Sri Gupta for the use of the Chinese pilgrims who visited India. At Gurga or Gurgi Masun are the remains of an ancient city, measuring \"along the stone walls on the southern side 3475 feet, along the eastern wall 3041 feet, the north wall 2050 feet, and that to the west 3700 feet.\" A colossal figure in blue stone, and similar monuments, are to be seen in the locality.\n\nIn the Yusufzai country Mr. Garrick thinks that many valuable inscriptions are yet to be found among the graveyards and Zi\u0101rats; but one of those brought to his notice he afterwards ascertained to have been discovered before by General Cunningham, whose account of it had actually been published.\n\nVol. xx. is the General's own report of a tour in Eastern Rajputana during the cold season of 1882-83. Some notion of the range of inquiry may be gathered from the statement that portions of Alwar, Bharatpur, Karauli, Dholpur, and Gwalior, with adjoining British districts of Dehli, Gurgam, and Mathura, were among the tracts visited. In Mathura he discovered several old inscriptions of the Indo-Scythic period, one of which he reckoned to be dated in A.D. 150; also a colossal statue seven feet high, cut in the round, with an inscription in Mauriya characters.\n\nVol. xxi. is in two parts, the first containing General Cunningham's personal reports of a tour in Bundlekhund and Rewa in 1883-4; the second of a tour in Rewa, Bundlekhund, Malwa, and Gwalior, in 1884-85. Among the more notable places visited were the great\nforts of K\u00e2laujara and Ajaygarh, and Khajur\u00e2ha, the religious capital of the Chandels. Among other work done, an inscription of Prithvi R\u00e1ja Chauhan was discovered at Madanpur, about 50 miles to the north of Saugor. \"It records,\" writes the General, \"his conquest of the country of Jej\u00e1kabhukti. The same spelling of the name I have since found in a Mahoba inscription. This then was its original form, which soon became shortened to Jej\u00e1huti, as written by Abu Rih\u00e2n, just as Tirabhukti became Tirahuti and Tirhut. The usual Brahminical derivation of the name of Jajhantiya from Yajur-hota, is thus proved to be erroneous.\"\n\nVol. xxii. is Mr. Carleyle's \"Report of Tours in Gorakhpur, Sarau, and Ghazipur in 1877-78-79-80.\" In this volume General Cunningham remarks that the discovery of the site of Kapilavastu,\u00b9 the birthplace of Buddha, has been followed up \"by the identification of several other important sites in the early history of Buddhism.\" Among these he mentions R\u00e2m-nagar, \"the site of the famous St\u00fbpa of R\u00e2magr\u00e2ma, from which the N\u00e2gas are said to have filched the tooth of Buddha, that is now believed to be preserved in Ceylon,\" and five other places or monuments, which appear to him to be \"certain.\" Of the last, the colossal statue of Buddha at Kasia, and an inscribed pillar of Asoka in the Tarai, are remarkable. General Cunningham believes the statue to be identical with that seen by the Chinese pilgrims in A.D. 637. The pillar was lying prostrate, with part of the inscription under water, its broken capital being attached to the shaft by a massive copper bolt. Hence the inference that the Hindus knew the destructive property of iron when used to fasten stones, to which the General adds: \"I have long held the opinion that the Hindus knew and practised the art of stone-cutting at least two centuries before the time of Asoka. Indeed, the very name of Taxila, or Takshasila-Nagara, the 'city of cut-stone'\"\n\n\u00b9 Alluded to in Annual Report for last year, page lxiii, as also the discovery of R\u00e2magrama and the statue at Kasia.\nbuildings, proves that the art was known and used before the time of Alexander.\" As regards our ignorance of any Indian inscription prior to Asoka, the learned commentator cannot but conclude that the beautifully-finished letters inscribed on the pillars of his period were preceded by a ruder alphabet, lost \"owing to the universal use of wood in early times.\"\n\nThe Theologische Literaturzeitung of the 11th July speaks well of the \"Geschichte des Alterthums\" of Mr. Edw. Meyer. It pronounces this first volume of a history of the East to the period of the founding of the Persian Empire, to be of great interest and to contain much new matter. To the Athen\u00e6um of the 5th September, Mr. Lindsay supplies a paper on the F\u00e1iyum papyri in the Bodleian Library, noticed by Mr. Nicholson, the librarian, in a subsequent number. The fragments are mostly written in Greek cursive characters, but several are in Coptic and some in Arabic. There is also in this issue a thoughtful review of tome iii. \"Histoire de l'Art dans l'Antiquit\u00e9\u2014Ph\u00e9nicie-Chypre,\" by Perrot and Chipiez, in which the reviewer points out how much has been done during the last two years to throw light upon a somewhat occult question, and define the \"R\u00f4le Historique des Ph\u00e9niciens.\" In the Academy of the same date, Dr. B\u00fchler notices Gen. Cunningham's discovery in the Panj\u00e1b-Haz\u00e1ra district of a new version (the seventh) of Asoka's Rock-edicts. It exhibits the so-called Bactrian, or Ariano-Pali characters. Such portions as he had been able to examine, through photographs, are stated to agree in every respect with the version of Shahbazgarhi. At the S\u00e9ance of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions on the 11th September is an account of the work carried on in the West of Persia in continuation of M. Dieulafoy's proceedings reported in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique. MM. Babin and Houssay, that gentleman's collaborateurs, driven away for four months by the heat of the plain country, proceeded to Ispahan by Ram\nHormuz, Shahpur, Shiraz and Persepolis. At M\u00e1l-i-M\u00edr, visited by Layard in 1841, Loftus in 1852, and Captain Wells in 1881, they made an inspection of the archaeological relics of Kal'a Fir'a\u00fan and the Shig\u00e1f-i-Salm\u00fan, photographing the Elamite figures of the bas-reliefs, and the inscriptions, heretofore only known by rough sketches. At Shahpur, photographs were taken of the Sassanian bas-reliefs, declared to be \"in\u00e9dits\"; while at the Naksh-i-Rustam, some three or four miles west of the Takht-i-Jamshid (Persepolis), M. Babin caused a scaffolding to be raised before the tomb of Darius to carry on the same process in a thoroughly efficient and complete manner. Seven inscriptions in turquoise blue were, moreover, brought to light from under a calcareous deposit. Whatever the results of M. Dieulafoy's explorations, it is hardly to be doubted that Susiana\u2014especially the site of Shushan\u2014has yet much to reveal to the archaeologist and savant. In the Athen\u00e6um of September 26 is a note by Professor Sayce on the Semitic origin of the Greek goddess Semele\u2014a name recurring in that of the Edomite king Samlah (Genesis xxxvi. 37). The same journal of the 3rd October reviews favourably Professor Hall's narrative of an expedition to the Sinai Peninsula, Wadiu'l Arabah, and Southern Palestine. We learn from a report of a S\u00e9ance at the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions on the 20th November that the Museum of the Louvre had been enriched by terra cotta objects found in Asia Minor; and that among other curiosities placed in it by M. Schlumberger was a gold ring from Antioch belonging to the Patrician Aetus who was martyred by the Saracens on the banks of the Euphrates in A.D. 846. At a S\u00e9ance of the same Academy on the 27th November the subject was that of Sanskrit inscriptions of Kambuj, which had been collected by M. Aymonier, and published by M. Barth. The most ancient of these antedated to the seventh century, the most modern to the eleventh. They were said to throw much light on Indian history. One of the\noldest cites the Ramayana. Another and later S\u00e9ance was interesting from its treatment of Annam Inscriptions, obtained in the provinces of Binh Thuan, Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen and Binh Dinh\u2014all in the ancient kingdom of Champ\u00e9, known to and described by Marco Polo. They confirm the Indian civilization of the country, and introduction therein of the various Brahmanical forms of worship, also of a Buddhism as in Kambuj. They are written in Sanskrit, and a dialect spoken in Binh Thuan; and they supply the names of some twenty kings, whose names end in varman, that flourished during the years from 784 to 1436 of the Christian era. The removal, in 1881, of the standing monument called Cleopatra's Needle from Alexandria to New York, has been made the raison d'\u00eatre of a volume on Egyptian Obelisks by Commander Gorringe of the U. S. Navy, reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 26th December. The work is said to be exhaustive, and its shortcomings are attributed to the repetition of commonly-received errors, \"unavoidable owing to the march of science and philology\" in a wide field. To the Academy of December 26, Mr. C. J. Lyall contributes a learned article on Euting's Nabatean Inscriptions. He shows how the valley, or rather \"depression\" of El Higr or Hegr, about 165 miles to the N.W. of Madinah, was in the first century of the Christian era, the southernmost point of the kingdom of Aretas\u2014he whose governor \"kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison\" (2 Cor. xi. 32). \"The commerce of the Sabaeans,\" he states, \"was transferred to the camels of the Nabataeans, a people reckoned by classical writers among the Arabians, of whom we first hear as a united power about 300 B.C.\" As to the inscriptions, they are found on tablets placed on the semi-classical frontages of rock-hewn sepulchres, and they bear the names of those who built or dedicated them, a limitation of their use to certain inheritors, and a denunciation of penalty against those who violate or alienate them. Mr. Lyall disagrees with, and combats Mr. Berger's \"strange\" theory\nthat classical Arabic owes its spread throughout Arabia to Muhammad.\n\nProfessor Ramsay's note on the river Castrus in the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 2nd January of the current year\u2014setting forth the discovery of its true source by the late Colonel Stewart of the 11th Hussars in an exploration of the mountains of Taurns, has not merely an arch\u00e6ological and geographical interest, but evokes a new tribute of respect for the memory of Charles Gordon's only companion on his last journey to Khartoum. An article in the same paper, four weeks later, headed \"News from Central Asia,\" mentions some arch\u00e6ological researches carried out under the direction of Professor N. N. Vessloffsky, partly in the environs of Samarkand and partly in the northern districts of Khokand. In the former locality inscriptions of a Pre-Islamitic period had been found, which seemed to throw light on the doings of Alexander in Transoxiana, and on the epoch of Buddhism in the same region. The *Athen\u00e6um* of the 10th April notices that the late Subhi Pasha, the numismatist and arch\u00e6ologist of Constantinople, had left the Sultan an agate seal of the Prophet, identified by the deceased as the only preserved heirloom of the three seals which Muhammad is reported by the initiated to have possessed. In the next week's number is a notice of the opening to the public of new collections in the department of the British Museum over which Mr. Franks presides. Among these are some valuable specimens of early Buddhist remains excavated by General Cunningham at Jamulgarhi. The *Athen\u00e6um* of May 1st states that ancient ruins of interest, older than the foundation of Aynthia in 1350, had lately been discovered in Siam near Chiengmai. A marked feature in the discovery is that the material used in the construction of the buildings is laterite, not brick, agreeably to modern local custom. Some inscriptions had also been discovered, but do not appear to have been deciphered. The *Academy* of the same date has a communication from General Schindler, from Tehran, in which he seeks\nto identify places mentioned by the older geographers with those now visited by travellers. In the district Rivend of the Arabs he finds the modern Nishapur; in the mountain Raeventa of the Shahn\u00e2ma a section of the mountains in that province; in the Gunabat of the Shahn\u00e2ma the Gunabad of to-day, and so on. The paper will repay perusal, and is worth closer examination. Some fifteen days after publication it called forth a short supplementary notice from Munich. \"Le Roi Donaghi \u00e0 Tello\" is the title of an article by M. Heuzey, in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique for April and May, 1886, in which the writer deals with the very difficult question of the age and political relations of the Sumerian and Akkadian King of Ur of the Chaldees. The pages of our Journal will tell their own tale of the more recent explorations on the Northern Afghan frontier and at Bamian.\n\nIn the Indian Antiquary for June, 1885, Pandit S. M. Natesa Sastri continues his paper on the Folklore of Southern India, the subject being \"The good husband and the bad wife.\" Captain R. C. Temple has a paper on \"The Delhi Delals and their Slang,\" a dialect used for the purposes of secrecy and deception. Professor Kielhorn of G\u00f6ttingen writes on \"A Copper Plate Grant of Vakpatriraja of Dhara,\" of which he furnishes a transcript and translation. The inscription has already been published by Dr. Rajendralal Mitra in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, vol. xix. p. 475. Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle has a paper on \"The Palas of Bengal,\" reprinted with revision from the Centenary Review of the Researches of the Asiatic Society Bengal 1784-1883, Part ii. Appendix ii. The historical interest of the Pala dynasty is very great, for they were Buddhists in religion, and they ruled over the whole of Bengal from Oudh eastward to the sea during the tenth century A.D., before the rise of the dynasty of the Senas. The object of Dr. Hoernle's paper is to reconstruct the chronology of the Palas by means of a more\ncareful reading of the Amgachhi inscriptions, of which he prints a revised text. He reduces the number of Pala kings from eleven to only six. Mr. Howorth continues his thirtieth paper \"On Chinghiz Khan and his Ancestors.\"\n\nIn the number for July is a \"Note\" by Captain R. C. Temple on \"A Modern Ornamental Kufic Alphabet from Kabul.\" Mr. G. A. Grierson, B.C.S., contributes an interesting paper upon Vidyapati, the most famous of the old master-singers of Bih\u00e2r, and his contemporaries. Dr. E. Hultzsch, of Vienna, writes on \"A Copper Plate Grant of the Gujarat Rashtrakuta King Dhr\u00fbva II., dated Saka 757 (A.D. 835-836).\" The inscription was found at Baroda. A German version of this paper has appeared in the Journal of the German Oriental Society. In the \"Miscellanea\" Sir Walter Elliot makes a note on the family and date of the great Rajendra Chola of Tanjore, in which he refers to the two inscriptions contributed by Mr. Fleet to the February number of this volume. Mr. Thomas Foulkes contributes a \"Note on the Genealogy of the Cholas,\" and Mr. Best continues his translation of the \"Proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi.\"\n\nIn the number for August the first paper is \"The Song of Alha's Marriage; a Bhojpuri Epic,\" edited and translated by Mr. G. A. Grierson, B.C.S. The Eastern version of the exploits of the famous Bund\u00eal'-khand heroes \u00c2lha and R\u00fbdal only exists in the mouths of itinerant singers, and is nearly always couched in the Bhoj'p\u00fbr\u00ee dialect of Bih\u00e2r\u00ee. The text given by Mr. Grierson was obtained with considerable difficulty from the mouth of one of these men, and has been carefully revised with the help of competent Bhoj'p\u00fbr\u00ee scholars. Dr. George B\u00fchler, C.I.E., contributes \"A Note on a second Old Palm Leaf MS. from Japan,\" which has recently been discovered by Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio. The leaf possesses high importance for Indian pal\u00e6ography. The contents are Buddhistic, and probably belong to one of the larger Sutr\u00e2s. Short as the piece is, it furnishes several new words not\nhitherto found in the Sanskrit dictionaries. In the third paper Mr. J. F. Fleet continues his remarks on \"Sanskrit and Old Kanarese Inscriptions,\" the present paper being devoted to the \"British Museum Plates of Eregana.\" Mr. Lewis Rice, C.I.E., M.R.A.S., writes on a \"Jaina-Vaishnava Compact\" engraved on a stone at the Jaina town of \u015aravana-Belgolor. It is known as R\u0101m\u0101nujach\u0101r\u012b's \u015a\u0101sana. The inscription is in Ha\u1e37e-Kannada characters, and in the Kannada language. Mr. Whitley Stokes has a note on \"Another Baumayantra\" obtained some years ago from a gentleman in Benares. Mr. K. T. Best continues \"The Proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi.\" There is also a notice of \"An Examination of the Claims of Ishmael as viewed by the Muhammadans,\" by J. D. Bate. The reviewer explains it to be the first chapter of the first section of an immense work that the author has in hand, entitled \"Studies in Islam.\" The part issued is in itself a volume, and is an attack on the cardinal Muhammadan doctrine that Ishmael and not Isaac was the \"Child of Promise.\" It is therefore considered as the commencement of a general attack along the whole line of Muhammadan dogma.\n\nThe September number contains a paper by Mr. E. Rehatsek on \"Russian Icons.\" The second paper is by the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles, and gives a Kashmiri tale entitled \"The Prince that was three times Shipwrecked.\" The third paper is a \"Summary of the Alha Khand,\" by Mr. G. A. Grierson, B.C.S. In the Miscellanea Mr. K. T. Best continues \"The Proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi.\"\n\nIn October, the Rev. Hinton Knowles writes on the Kashmiri Portable Brazier, called the k\u0101ngar or k\u0101ngr\u0101; Mr. Howorth continues his chronicle of Chinghiz Khan and his Ancestors; a long paper by Mr. Ball on the identification of the animals and plants of India known to early Greek authors is reproduced, with additions and revisions, from the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy; and Mr. Fleet resumes his inquiries on Sanskrit and Old Kanarese Inscriptions. In\nthe Correspondence and Miscellanea, it is to be noticed that one of the six proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi, \"The heart of a fool is in his mouth, and the tongue of a wise man is in his heart,\" is almost word for word Ecclesiasticus xxi. 20.\n\nIn November, Mr. Fleet's Sanskrit and Kanarese Inscriptions and selection of Kanarese Ballads; a continuation of Mr. Ball's paper of the previous month; Mr. Pattibai Wadia's Folklore in Western India; and a learned article on the identification of places in the Sanskrit Geography of India, with a book notice and Miscellanea supplied by Mr. Grierson and Dr. B\u00fchler, make up a highly satisfactory number; and the following double part issue, in completion of the year, is again largely indebted to Mr. Fleet and Mr. Ball, who, with Professor Kielhorn, the Hon. K. T. Telang and Dr. B\u00fchler, contribute to its pages. The last-named able writer has an appreciative notice of the Centenary Review of the Bengal Asiatic Society.\n\nFor January, 1886, the first part of vol. xv., Mr. Longworth Dames writes on \"Old Seals found at Harappa,\" in the Montgomery District of the Panjab; Mr. Pattibai Wadia on Folklore; and Professor Kielhorn on Copper Plate Grants in Kanauj; Mr. Grierson introduces an English-Gipsy Index compiled by Mrs. Grierson; and Mr. Edward Thomas publishes extracts from Chinese authors concerning the history of the Kushans. M. Stein's \"Afghanistan in Avestic Geography\" is a reprint from the Academy touching upon questions which have been more largely treated by Sir Henry Rawlinson; and the book notices are remarkable for an elaborate article by Sir Walter Elliot, reviewing Mr. Egerton's Illustrated Handbook of Indian Arms, and a preliminary notice of Beruni's Indica, by Dr. B\u00fchler.\n\nThe number for February opens with a paper by Professor Kielhorn on the Sasbahu Temple Inscriptions of Mahipala of Vikrama Samvat 1150. This is followed by a continuation of Folklore in Western India; a translation into Sanskrit\nby Professor Weber of the British National Anthem; and an additional part of Mrs. Grierson's Gipsy-Index. The Miscellanea are unusually brief, but the book notices would be interesting, if only for including the Thousand and One Nights, by that marvellous traveller and Orientalist, Sir Richard Burton.\n\nA question which\u2014if Oriental study and research can ever be called popular\u2014would be an especially popular one at the present day, is that of the comparative study of Asiatic Symbolism. Mr. Murray-Aynsley supplies \"Discursive Contributions\" on this in March. Colonel Jacob adds an article on the readings of the Nrisimhatapaniya Upanishad; and the Rev. Hinton Knowles one in the form of a Kasmiri tale, entitled Gullala Shah. Professor Kielhorn contributes notes on the Mahabhashya, while Mrs. Grierson continues her English-Gipsy Index. Book notices complete the number.\n\nThere is no new original contribution in April, which continues already mentioned papers by Mr. Murray Aynsley, the Rev. Hinton Knowles, Mr. Fleet, and Mrs. Grierson. The retirement of General Cunningham, after a connection with India, and \"with the study of Indian Archaeology in all its branches, that has lasted more than half a century,\" naturally calls for special notice.\n\nThe first three articles in May and the Gipsy-Index are continuations of papers. There is also a passage in the Jain Harivamsa relating to the Guptas from the pen of Mr. K. B. Pathak, B.A., with a note by Mr. Fleet. Prominent among the book notices is Mr. Fleet's review of the Journal of the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society, to which we have before alluded.\n\nPalestine Exploration Fund.\u2014At the annual meeting held on 24th June, 1885, it was announced that the Committee had received a magnificent contribution to the Survey of the East, in a packet of memoirs, plans, and maps from Herr Schumacher. This, certainly the most important examination,\nso far as it goes, of the Jaulan district, as yet made by any traveller, is put forward as the principal work of the year. The map covers about 200 square miles; and the memoirs contain a list of Arabic names, a general description of the country, and an account, with plans and drawings, of the villages and sites visited. Among the principal ruins described may be mentioned Khurbet Arkub er Rahwah, which Herr Schumacher would identify with the Argob of the Bible, commonly placed at the Lejjah, and those in Bait Akkar and Ain Dakhar. North of the last is a field of nearly 500 Dolmens, called by the natives Kabar Bani Israil\u2014graves of the children of Israel. Ancient stone bridges were found crossing the stream at Nahru'l Allan and Nahr Rukkad; also a remarkable altar and statue of basalt at Kefr el Ma. In a village called Sahem el Jolan, Herr Schumacher thinks he has discovered the Biblical Golan, which has hitherto escaped identification. The ruins of the remarkable underground city of Ed Dera were examined and planned for the first time, together with the towns and monuments of El Mezeirib, Tuffas and Nawar, identified by Mr. Oliphant with the land of Uz. Other subterranean buildings were found at Khurbet Sumakh and at Sheik Saad. The rock-tomb of Job was also photographed and planned. Mention is made of a Dolmen quite recently discovered in Jud\u00e6a, where hitherto none had been observed, and it was supposed that all had been destroyed. It lies in a desert and hilly part of the country between Khurbet Aujeh-el-Foka (Sheet xv. O.r.) and El Mughair (Sheet xv. N.q.).\n\nHow Mr. Oliphant came upon the Dolmen and a sarcophagus in Zimmarin is related in the July number, which contains the Report, enriched also with an account of Mr. Guy Le Strange's interesting journey east of Jordan, and Herr Hanauer's note on a Rock Altar near Zorah suggestive of that of Manoah (Judges xiii.). Moreover, in this particular issue, a kindly notice of our late lamented Secretary, Mr. Vaux, and his\nconnection with the Palestine Exploration Fund, must not be forgotten. It need scarcely be repeated here that Schumacher's \"Across the Jordan,\" with appendices, maps, plans and drawings, is published as a separate record.\n\nThe Quarterly Statements for October, and January and April (1886), are full of valuable papers. Among them are Mr. Oliphant's \"New Discoveries,\" and \"Excavations on Carmel,\" Mr. Chichester Hart's \"Naturalist's Journey,\" and contributions by Capt. Conder, Dr. Merrill, the Rev. W. F. Birch, Herr Hanauer and Mr. Greville Chester. But these are by no means all the names of those who supply this admirable serial with readable and instructive articles. A valuable archaeological communication from the pen of a less prominent contributor may be found in the April number under the head of \"The Aqueducts of Siloam.\"\n\nHerr Schick, in describing this particular locality at the present day, writes: \"When the Pool of Siloam is mentioned, that which contains water is generally meant; below this there is another and much larger pool, now used as a garden, and called Birket el Hamra; it is formed by a thick wall or dam built across the Tyrop\u0153an Valley from Ophel ('City of David') to the Western hill (Jerusalem).\" Outside the dam the writer had himself observed, in 1846, a tank of an oval form, since filled up; and two other tanks were discovered by Professor Guthe, one as late as 1841, near the north of the Pool of Siloam. \"There is now,\" he adds, \"only one real pool, but ancient Christian writers mention several ... one called 'Natatoria,' or the swimming pool; it was large, and had a kind of apsidal end; this appears to be the Birket el Hamra.\" He then goes on to describe traces of aqueducts now coming to light; the famous one, and several others which he took note of when clearing out the main aqueduct into which they all lead. Going down the road from the Pool of Siloam to the mill, he saw in the rock-wall to his left a hole; this he cleared out, and found to be a rock-hewn tunnel crossed by\nanother, the exploration of which led eventually to the discovery of a \"second aqueduct.\" After a detailed account of his investigations, he concludes by making certain definite suggestions to the Palestine Exploration Fund, the last of which is to the effect that something might be found in the hitherto unexplored caves on the southern side of Ophel, which might throw light on the \"Tombs of the Kings.\" Sir Charles Wilson, in remarking on Herr Schick's paper, gives an opinion that the discovery of a \"second aqueduct,\" partially rock-hewn, is very interesting; moreover, that his description makes it clear how \"the lower pool, Birket el Hamra, received water, direct from the 'Fountain of the Virgin,' at some period which Herr Schick places prior to the completion of the well-known Siloam Tunnel.\"\n\nMention has been made of the work in Western Persia carried on by M. Dieulafoy's collaborateurs; but, before leaving the subject of Biblical Archaeology, it may be well to revert to that gentleman's own proceedings reported in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique.\n\nThe mound of Susa, an artificial hill from 25 to 38 m\u00e8tres high, and of about 100 hectares in extent, had been explored in 1851, by Loftus, who discovered there the celebrated Inscription of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Continuing these investigations, M. Dieulafoy came upon a double-headed capital, nearly four m\u00e8tres long, similar to the Persepolitan capitals; part of the crown of the pylons placed before the palace of Artaxerxes; two fragments of a porcelain balustrade, of the Elamite epoch, curious specimens of the most ancient Susian art; fragments of bas-reliefs in enamelled brick, representing negroes clothed with royal insignia, suggesting an inquiry whether the dynasty which preceded that of the Achaemenians was of Ethiopic descent; various utensils of ivory, glass, bronze, and earthenware, but nothing of gold or silver; a great number of Elamite or Achaemenian seals, especially an opal which appears to have belonged to Xerxes or\nArtaxerxes I.; a series of bricks and st\u00e8les with inscriptions; and lastly, two-thirds of one of the towers which defended the entrance to the palace\u2014part of a very complete and scientific system of fortification. In a future exploration M. Dieulafoy hoped to penetrate into the Elamite palace.\n\nAmong the principal papers in the 3rd fascicule of the Gazette Arch\u00e9ologique is one on ancient Sculptures found in Carthage (Mus\u00e9e Saint-Louis), by MM. Reinach and Babelon.\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the 17th June of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Antiquaires de France M. Germain Bapst announced that excavations had been made at Van (Armenia), resulting in the discovery of some monuments of Chald\u00e6o-Assyrian art, the workmanship of which recalls that of the bronze seat obtained from the same place by the Marquis de Vog\u00fc\u00e9.\n\nIn the Revue Critique of 7th September M. Clermont Ganneau contributes a \"Note d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale\" on the subject of the positions of Segor, Gom\u00f4rrah, and Sodom.\n\nIn the Academy of 1st August is the notice of an interesting discovery recently made at Sidon, showing that the Ph\u0153nician city was preceded by an older settlement, whose inhabitants were still in the Stone age. Some natives, excavating for stone, after penetrating through the alluvial soil, had dug through a deposit of blown sand, six m\u00e8tres in depth, below which they found a stratum of earth containing flint implements, fragments of coarse red pottery, and other objects, among them a clay whistle.\n\nThe Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres has adjudged the Jean Reynaud prize to M. Aymonier, for his scientific voyages of exploration and arch\u00e6ological discoveries in Indo-China.\n\nWe are told in the Athen\u00e6um of the 8th August of a grant for the repair of the little mosque of Santa Sophia in the Seraglio, in which the Imperial Ottoman Museum is placed; moreover, that a collection of Egyptian antiquities had been commenced in the form of presents from an Egyptian prince.\nThe fifth volume of the \"Journal of Hellenic Studies\" contains a paper on \"Sepulchral Customs in Ancient Phrygia,\" by Mr. W. M. Ramsay, representing a further outcome of the researches in Asia Minor which he intended to resume in the spring.\n\nIn \"L'Art de la Verrerie,\" by Gerspach, recently published, are details on the antique productions of Egypt, Phoenicia, and Greece, while the division treating of Eastern glass deals with the products of Byzantium, Persia, Damascus, Arabia, and China. The ancient glass of this last-named country is considered by Dr. Friedrich Hirth, in his paper \"Zur Geschichte des Glases in China und des Antiken Orienthandels,\" in the June number of the Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient, in which the writer concludes that the Chinese first derived their knowledge of glass from the Phoenicians.\n\nSemitic Literature.\u2014Hebrew and Chaldee.\u2014\"The various papers read at Canon Driver's house at Oxford,\" referred to in the last Report as about to be printed, have appeared under the general title of \"Studia Biblica.\" The volume consists of ten articles, of which Dr. Neubauer and Professor Sanday have each contributed two, the remainder being the work of Dr. Edersheim, Professors Driver and Wordsworth, and Messrs. Ward, Gwilliam, and Randell respectively. A careful review in the Athen\u00e6um of the 19th September analyzes the several parts of this interesting collection of essays, nearly half of which are regarded as \"adaptations, for English students of theology, of German work on Bible subjects.\" As the reviewer awards the palm for interest to Mr. Randell and Dr. Neubauer, it may be well to state that the first bears testimony to the importance of classical epigraphy in the early history of the Church, and the second gives a learned r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of recent discoveries in Nabath\u00e6an and Temanite epigraphy, with a separate paper on the languages spoken in Jud\u00e6a in the time of our Lord.\nDr. Mo\u00efse Schwab, of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris, a scholar distinguished in the field of Rabbinical literature, who has for some years past been engaged upon a French version of the Talmud, of which five volumes have appeared, has now undertaken an English translation after the model of the French, of which the opening tractate, the \"Tractate Berachoth,\" has recently been published. In the Standard of 22nd August is a long article with special reference to this publication. The writer points out how, when the Syro-Aramaean dialect fell into disuse, and was gradually forgotten, much of the Talmud became unintelligible without numerous glosses, which in time slipped from the margin into the text, and when, finally, came the scissors of the Church censors, confusion was made worse confounded. Thus, any modern translation of the Talmud should be accompanied by full explanations and comments, to make the allusions\u2014of which the work is full\u2014clear, and the meaning manifest to those unacquainted with the methods of Rabbinical teaching. This appears to be a want in Dr. Schwab's version.\n\nIn the Academy of 25th July is a review by Dr. Driver of Prolegomena to the History of Israel, with a reprint of the article \"Israel\" from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, by Julius Wellhausen. \"Its aim, viewed as a whole, is,\" we are told, \"to develope and illustrate a theory of the history and legislation of the ancient Hebrews, which, though commonly associated with the name of Graf, has found its most able and powerful exponent in Professor Wellhausen.\" Messrs. Black and Menzies are praised, for the manner in which they have accomplished the translation, and retained the \"lucid and incisive\" style of the original.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of 11th July briefly notices Dr. Robert Young's \"Grammatical Analysis of the Book of Psalms in Hebrew,\" and recommends it to students as the \"outcome of careful labour and extensive knowledge.\" It also reviews the Rev. W. Randolph's \"Analytical Notes on the First and\nthree Last of the Minor Prophets,\u201d a book intended for the use of Hebrew students of the intermediate class.\n\nIn a letter to the Athen\u00e6um of the 1st August Dr. Ginsburg states that he possesses an edition of Kimchi\u2019s Hebrew Grammar, nearly ten years older than the supposed editio princeps, which is dated 1534. Unlike the 1534 edition, it does not give in the margin the references either to the respective books of the Scriptures or to the chapters of the books quoted in the body of the text. He notes, moreover, that folios 53, 60, 77 and 82 are blank, a circumstance he had remarked in other early-printed Hebrew books.\n\nThe same journal of the 8th August announces that Dr. Hartwig Hirschfeld, the translator into German of Judah Halevi\u2019s philosophico-theological work usually called \u201cKhuzan,\u201d has in readiness for the press the original Arabic text according to the unique MS. preserved in the Bodleian Library. He is to add in parallel columns the Hebrew translation by Jehudah Ibn Tibbon, collated with several MSS.\n\nThe Academy of 5th September notifies the publication by Herr Morris Jastrow of an able and careful monograph entitled \u201cAbu Zakarijja Jahja ben Daw\u00fbd Hajj\u00fbg und seine zwei Grammatischen Schriften.\u201d Hayy\u00fbj, who belongs to the middle of the tenth century, may be regarded as the founder of scientific Hebrew grammar. The two treatises by him which are the subject of this essay are still unpublished, although several MSS. exist.\n\nThe Academy of 3rd October has a note on \u201cDas Buch Kohelet: nach der Auffassung der Weisen des Talmud und Midrasch und der j\u00fcdischen Erkl\u00e4rer des Mittelalters,\u201d Theil i., \u201cVon der Mischna bis zum Abschluss des babyl. Talmud. Nebst zahlreichen kritischen Noten, und einer gr\u00f6ssern Abhandlung, von Rabbiner Dr. Sinai Schiffer.\u201d Dr. Schiffer thinks that a collection of the Talmudic and Midraschic explanations of biblical passages, arranged chronologically, will be of much use to philological expositors of the Old Testament.\nIn the *Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives*, Janvier-Juin, 1885, M. J. Hal\u00e9vy, Recherches Bibliques III., writes \"Sur l\u2019origine du dans les noms propres compos\u00e9s,\" and under the head \"Bibliographie\" reviews Frederic Delitzsch's \"The Hebrew Language,\" with special reference to its comparison with Assyrian.\n\nIn the *Literarisches Centralblatt* of the 11th July is an appreciative review of \"The Comparative Philology of Hebrew-Arabic Tongues,\" by Ab\u00fal Walid Merw\u00e2n Ibn Gan\u00e2h (Rabbi Jona). The learned reviewer, Professor Bucher, has since published the Life and Works of the Grammarian, favourably noticed in the *Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives*.\n\nDr. F. Rosenthal has published \"Vier Apokryphische B\u00fccher aus der Zeit und Schule R. Akibas.\" The publication is reviewed with approval by M. Steinschneider in the *Deutsche Literaturzeitung* of 5th September.\n\nFrom the pen of Dr. W\u00fcnsche we have, in the *Bibliotheca Rabbinica*, \"Der Midrasch,\" and \"Der Midrasch Bemid bar Rabba,\" a review of which appeared in the *Literarisches Centralblatt* of 22nd August. In the same journal, No. 30, of 18th July, M. Perles' \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Hebr\u00e4ischen und Arama\u00efschen Studien\" was pronounced to be full of interest.\n\nOne of the communications presented to the meeting of the American Oriental Society at Boston in May, 1885, was on \"The Holy Houses from the Hebrew Scriptures; also from the original texts of the Chronicles, Ezra, Maccabees, Septuagint, Coptic, Itala, Chaldee, Syrian, Samaritan, Talmud and leading Rabbis, by Professor J. A. Paine, of Elmwood, Massachusetts.\"\n\nThe *Academy* of the 12th September, mentioning the contents of the Expositor for that month, refers to Professor Driver's notes on the revised version of Leviticus and Numbers as \"very full and valuable for the history of exegesis.\" They are concluded in October.\nIn the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 7th November we read of a description, in the press, of the Hebrew MSS. of the Pentateuch in the Chetham Library, Manchester, by the Rev. C. G. R. Gillespie, to be issued in pamphlet form, under the title of \"Codex Chethamensis.\" On the 14th, the same paper announces the appointment, at Berlin, under the auspices of the Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund, of a historical Commission for the publication of original documents concerning Jewish settlers in the Holy Roman Empire up to A.D. 1273, and minor papers, a special volume being devoted to writings in Hebrew.\n\nThe annual notices of Continental literature which mark the first issue of the *Athen\u00e6um* for the New Year are papers of great interest and value, but they contain little of progress under the present head. When a Mosaic theme is treated, it is rather from the philosophical than philological point of view. We may, however, notice two publications which appear under the head \"Theological Books,\" in the number of the 14th February; one, a Rabbinical commentary on Genesis, translated by Mr. Hershon from the Jud\u00e6o-Polish; and another, the Talmud of Jerusalem, translated \"for the first time\" by Dr. Moses Schwab. This last, as already stated, is a translation into English of a French translation; but it is shown that the meaning is far from clear, and the reviewer reaches the conclusion that \"the Talmud must be studied in the original language, and with critical knowledge of the various subjects treated in it.\" So far back as the 3rd October the *Academy* had noticed the English translation as by an unknown collaborateur who had done his work imperfectly, but the *Athen\u00e6um* speaks of it as by Dr. Schwab himself. Under \"Literary Gossip\" the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 29th May states that Dr. Neubauer's Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in Oxford was approved for publication by the Delegates of the Press; and repeats a statement of the *J\u00fcdische Wochenschrift* that Signor E. Hoepli, the Milan bookseller, possesses a\nMS. of Maimonides' ritual work, entitled \"Mishneh Thorah,\" purchased by Don Isaac Abraband in the 15th century.\n\nA long article on \"Animal Names of the Revised Version of the Bible,\" in the Academy of April 24, by the Rev. W. Houghton, opens an interesting field of inquiry, and will, no doubt, have attracted the attention of Oriental scholars.\n\nVol. viii. part 3 of the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology (1885) has some remarkable papers. That upon the \"Handicrafts and Artizans mentioned in Talmudical Writings,\" by Dr. Louis, intended to throw light upon the social and industrial habits of the Jews about 2000 years ago, contains information which may be useful to those who are students, as well as mere readers of the Bible. In the Proceedings of the Society the Rev. C. J. Ball continues his illustrations of Hebrew verse, by adding to his specimens of trisyllabic metre, suggested metrical arrangements of Bible passages, such as \"The Great P\u00e6an, or Lob-gesang, of which we have two independent copies preserved respectively in 2 Sam. xxii., and in the Psalter (Psalm xviii.).\" He has examined and metrically divided, and he shows the Poem to consist of \"combinations of octosyllabic, heptasyllabic, and hexasyllabic stichi, with an obviously Iambic rhythm.\" It may interest Hebrew scholars to know that an entirely new French version of the Psalms, preceded by a word for word rendering, and a \"petite grammaire Hebraique et dictionnaire des racines,\" by M. B. Moss\u00e9, a Rabbi of Avignon, was published in that city, as also in Paris, in 1880, and, though not perhaps likely to afford much aid to critical research, cannot fail to be useful in comparing translations. While on this subject it may be stated that the Rev. Dr. Chotzner's work on Hebrew rhymed prose, called \"Sichronoth; or Reminiscences of a Student of Jewish Theology,\" is accompanied by an English essay on the \"Rise and Progress of Hebrew Poetry in post-Biblical Times.\"\nAmong the more recently published books may be mentioned the following:\n\nThe Pentateuch, its Age and Authorship, by Dr. Kennedy; Ewald's History of Israel, translated by J. F. Smith, vol. vii.; Le Po\u00e8me de Job, d'apr\u00e8s le texte Biblique, par l'Abb\u00e9 J. Bernard de Montm\u00e9lian; La Cantique des Cantiques, traduction en vers, par Jean Laher, d'apr\u00e8s la version de M. Reuss; D\u00e9couvertes en Chald\u00e9e, par Ernest de Sarzec, 1\u00e8re Livraison; La Monarchie chez les Juifs en Palestine, par Emile L\u00e9vy; Le Proph\u00e8te Habakuk, introduction critique et ex\u00e9g\u00e8se, avec examen sp\u00e9cial des Commentaires Rabbiniques du Talmud et de la Tradition, par Antoine J. Baumgartner. [The author truly says: \"Une production litt\u00e9raire de la valeur du Livre d'Habakuk m\u00e9rite, en effet, plus qu'aucune autre, l'attention de tous ceux qui aiment et qui admirent l'antique po\u00e9sie des H\u00e9breux.\" Dr. Pusey (Minor Prophets) and other well-known English commentators have taken up the subject, and the third and last chapter of this grand book is described in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible as \"the magnificent Psalm... unrivalled for boldness of conception, sublimity of thought, and majesty of diction.\"] B. Strassburger, Geschichte der Erziehung und Unterricht bei den Israeliten, von der Vor Talmud Zeit bis zur Gegenwart; B. Drachman, Die Bedeutung d. Jehuda Hajjug in der Hebr\u00e4ischen Grammatik; G.

Strack, Abriss der Neuhebr\u00e4ischen Literatur [the two last Leipzig publications, reviewed in the Austrian Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for October].\n\nAssyriology.\u2014On the 2nd June, 1885, at the Society of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology, Mr. T. G. Pinches read a paper \"On a Series of Specimens of the Familiar Correspondence of the Babylonians and Assyrians\"; and on the 3rd idem, at the\nBritish Archaeological Association, one \"On Babylonian Cylinders.\" The Journal of Assyriology (Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie), published by Schulze, at Leipzig, has now been issued for January and June, and takes the place of the Journal of Cuneiform Research (Keilschriftforschung). Its object is international, and it seeks to carry on its work by co-operation from abroad as at home. In this sense it is represented by the foremost Assyriologists of Europe; and the names of Sayce for Oxford, Oppert for Paris, and Schrader for Berlin, carry its guarantee of scholarship. The first number has seven papers, inclusive of criticisms, and is completed by a short but pertinent \"Bibliographie.\" The second issue (June) has eight papers and a \"Bibliographie.\" Under the head \"Sprechsaal\" are some interesting notes and comments on previously published articles or statements. Among them we find Prof. Oppert correcting M. Delitzsch for interpreting, as he himself had done before, the verb napahu as \"to rise,\" whereas, coupled with samsi, it signifies, like the Arabic \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633 mid-day, or the period of the sun in full power. Two numbers of the superseded journal, i.e. for July and November, have yet to be noticed. They contain in all 15 articles, besides reviews of books and Bibliographie. Mr. Pinches contributes additions and corrections to the fifth volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, and two texts from Sippara of the Sun-god; one, referring to blacksmith's work, dated in Tammuz, 13th year of the reign of Nabonidus, King of Babylon; the other in Nisan, 14th year of the same monarch. Professor Sayce continues his learned exposition of \"an ancient Babylonian work on medicine.\" The remaining papers are by Messrs. Schrader, Gr\u00fcnbaum, Latrille, Haupt, Jensen, Lehmann, and Delitzsch, besides fresh writers in the \"Sprechsaal.\"\n\nM. Carl Bezold, editor of the Zeitschrift just noticed, writes to the Academy from Munich, under date the 1st August,\na resum\u00e9 of recent work in Assyriology. Honourable mention is made of M. de Sarzec's excavations, resulting in the rich collection of ancient Babylonian inscriptions, of which we reported last year the issue of the first part; also of M. Joachim M\u00e9nant's Catalogue m\u00e9thodique et raisonn\u00e9 de la Collection de M. de Clercq; the autograph by the Rev. J. N. Strassmaier, of \"a beautiful Cuneiform text from a recently discovered cylinder, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York\" (transcribed and translated, with introduction and notes, by Dr. O'Conor, of the Woodstock College, in Maryland); the researches of Mr. Pinches, recorded in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology and Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung, and of Professor Sayce; and the third edition of Professor Delitzsch's Assyrische Lesest\u00fccke, \"with grammatical paradigms, a full list of signs, augmented by Babylonian and archaic forms of the Cuneiform characters, newly collated or entirely new texts, like the so-called Zurich vocabulary, the interesting 'reading-book' of the young Asnapper (Kouyunjik 4378), the eleventh tablet of the Nimrod series, or so-called Deluge tablet, newly translated by Professor Oppert, and a short Assyrian glossary.\" As regards the labours of our own countrymen, the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology for May, 1885, show the interpretation of a curious Babylonian text by Mr. Pinches, referring to work done by Babylonian workmen on board the state-arge of Darius, and papers by Professor Sayce on inscriptions of Assur-Bani-Pal and Tarkondemos. Besides the above, the learned editor notices especially Dr. Jensen's dissertation on the sixth tablet of the Surbu series as useful for lexicography and comparative studies; a brochure called \"Babylonische Buss-psalmen,\" by Dr. Zimmern, of Erlangen (who by the way rejects the theory on the Sumerian language of our contributor, Dr. Fritz Hommel); an \"excellent\" paper on Assyrian Phonology, by Professor Haupt, published in the Chicago Hebraica; and an \"interesting\" paper by Mr.\nBertin on Assyrian and Akkadian Pronouns, which appeared in our Journal for January, 1885.\n\nIn the Academy of July 4 is a favourable review of the \"Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament,\" by Professor Eberhard Schrader, of Berlin, translated from the second enlarged German edition by the Rev. Owen Whitehouse, M.A. The reviewer expresses his regret that the translator has not always given the Hebrew proper names in the forms adopted in the English Bible.\n\nIn the Mus\u00e9on for June, 1885, Mr. E. J. de Dillon notices Prof. Sayce's \"Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments,\" and gives a cordial welcome to this new work from his \"plume infatigable.\" At the annual meeting (May, 1885) of the American Oriental Society at Boston, Professor Lyon gave an account of recent progress in Assyriology. Independently of German and English publications, he referred to Professor Paul Haupt's contributions to the American Hebraica of a valuable paper on Assyrian vowels, and of a minute commentary on the confinement at Nineveh of a Kedarene prince, related in the annals of Assurbanipal. Mention also was made of \"an entertaining and scholarly address by Professor Francis Brown\" under the title of Assyriology: its use and abuse in Old Testament Study. Professor Lyon's own work, entitled An Assyrian Manual, announced as in the press, was intended for those who wish to study the language with or without a teacher; and would contain texts partly in Cuneiform character, but mostly transliterated, together with paradigms, notes, glossary and lists of Cuneiform signs.\n\nIn the Revue Critique of 27th July is a notice by M. Hal\u00e9vy of Dr. Jansen's \"Dissertations\" and Dr. Zimmern's brochure mentioned in M. Bezold's resum\u00e9 which has been summarized above. He couples the last with Dr. Fritz Hommel's Sumcrisch-Akkadische Sprache, giving as a reason that they exactly represent the three successive stages through\nwhich the Akkadian question has passed in Germany within a year. Dr. Hommel's work will, he believes, be the last put forward in support of the theory of the Turanian origin of the Sumerian or Akkadian language. As before shown, however, in the pages of this Journal (see Report for 1883, p. lxxxiii), many eminent scholars differ from this view and would utterly reject the dictum of his penultimate sentence; \"En on mot, l'Accadien ou Sum\u00e9rien pur est une chim\u00e8re; il ne se trouve nulle part, parcequ'il n'a jamais exist\u00e9.\n\nBesides a note in the Hebraica on Fred. Delitzsch's religion of the \"Kassites\" (die Sprache der Koss\u00e4er), there is, in the Literarische Centralblatt of the 11th July, a laudatory review of the same scholar's Assyrian reading-book, described as very useful and trustworthy.\n\nProfessor Sayce's \"Assyria, its Princes, Priests, and People,\" published by the Religious Tract Society, is very favourably reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 15th May, 1886. While the author himself is described as an \"eminent and brilliant leader in the difficult study of Assyriology,\" his small volume is pronounced to be \"instructive and remarkably interesting.\" The chapters on religion and Assyrian art and literature are specially selected for comment. Not the least important feature to be noted with satisfaction in this modest but valuable publication, is the aid afforded by the Cuneiform Inscriptions to the elucidation of history.\n\nNo. III. of the Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale contains, among other interesting papers elsewhere noted, one by M. Bertin on \"L'Incorporation Verbale en Accadien.\" The Editors take exception to the title on the plea that, while admitting the term Sumerian, they are doubtful whether \"Akkadian\" can be applied to a special dialect of Sumerian or to the Semitic language of the Assyrians; but the able and painstaking writer may be left to assert his own theories on the matter.\n\nAmong lately published works, not heretofore specified,\nmay be noticed: \"By-paths of Bible Knowledge,\" written by Professor Sayce for the Religious Tract Society, on the Assyrians and their History: Die Annalen Asurnazirpal (B.C. 884\u2013860), from the London edition, by Heinrich Shotzky: \"Les Langues perdues de la Perse et de l'Assyrie,\" by J. M\u00e9nant: Histoire Ancienne de l'Orient jusqu'aux Guerres M\u00e9diques, tome iv., 9\u00e8me \u00e9dition: \"Les Assyrois et les Chald\u00e9ens: Aug.

Lyon, Assyrian Study, its bearing on the Old Testament (in the Christian Year, Nos. 15 and 16): J. M\u00e9nant, Catalogue M\u00e9thodique, etc., above alluded to in M. B\u00e9zold's notice, 1\u00e8re et 2\u00e8me Livraison (deux fascicules); a beautifully printed and illustrated work: the same author's \"Recherches sur la Glyptique Orientale,\" 2nd part, Assyrian Cylinders (1886), of which the first part was published in 1883: Acta Sancti Maris Assyri\u00e6, Babyloniae ac Persidis, seculo i apostoli Syriace sive Aramaice, ed. J. B. Abbeloos (reviewed by N\u00f6ldeke in the Austrian Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient, October): Die Keilinschriften am Eingange der Quellengrotte d. Sebeneh-Su by E. Schrader (reviewed by M\u00fcller in the November number of the same): Assyriologische Bibliothek (vol. iv. parts 5 and 6), Delitzsch and Haupt.\n\nArabic.\u2014Some further correspondence on the \"Arabian Matriarchate\" (Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XVII. Part 2), will be found in the Academy of 4th July, where is a letter from Mr. J. W. Redhouse in reply to one from Professor E. B. Tylor, which appeared on 27th June. Writing again on 15th August, Professor Tylor mentions that Dr. G. A. Wilken has published the \"Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb\"; but, as the said publication is apparently not so accessible to English anthro-\npologists as it deserves to be, he cites some of its chief points. To this there is a rejoinder by Mr. J. W. Redhouse, in the issue of 22nd August, in which he expresses the opinion that his main contention had been overlooked; and declined to commit himself to any decided view on a \"conceivable prehistoric Arabian or Semitic matriarchate.\"\n\nIn the Academy of the 8th August is a review by Mr. C. J. Lyall of the Arabic-English Dictionary by Dr. F. Steingass, commending the book, in that it furnishes students, for the first time in English, with a trustworthy authority in a compact and convenient form. He points out that there is room for improvement in the classification and grouping of the different significations.\n\nA long-felt want has, it is hoped, been supplied by the publication of Dr. Tien's \"Manual of Colloquial Arabic,\" noticed in the Athen\u00e6um of 25th July and Saturday Review of 22nd August.\n\nIn the Journal of the German Oriental Society, Professor W. Robertson Smith has a note on M. Wellhausen's paper, the \"Lieder der Hudhailiten,\" in the preceding number of that Journal, pointing out that the hareheads on the hands of the maidens are not metaphorical, but, without doubt, actual heads, intended as amulets and worn as bracelets.\n\nThe Academy of 25th July announces the issue by Otto Schulze, the Leipzig publisher, of the \"Buch Al Chazari\" of Abu'l Hasan Jehuda Hallewi, by Dr. Hartwig Hirschfeld. It is published by subscription, in two parts (at the cost of 5 marks each), and contains the original Arabic text in square Hebrew characters from the unique MS. in the Bodleian Library; also, in parallel columns, the Hebrew translation, by Jehuda Ibn Tibbon, which is preserved in five MSS. collated for the purpose, with critical notes.\n\nIn the Oesterreichische Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for June and July are two long notices by Dr. Ign. Goldziher, of \"Aben Pascualis Assila\" (dictionarium Biographicum) Ad fidem\ncodicis Escurialensis Arabice nunc primum edidit et indicibus locupletissimis instruxit Franciscus Codera. The reviewer welcomes the appearance of Ibn Bashkuw\u00e2l's (A.H. 494-578) Biographies as evidence of the progress in Spain in the region of Oriental studies. The work forms the first two volumes of a Bibliotheca Arabica-Hispana, on the continuation of which Signor Codera gives a short programme in the preface. The editor, who is Professor of Arabic in the University of Madrid, has already acquired considerable reputation by his works on the history, numismatics, etc., of Muhammedan Spain. To these must now be added the present publication, a source of Spanish-Arabic literary history from the 4th to the 6th century of the Hegira. Ibn Bashkuw\u00e2l's work, in continuation of that of Ibn al Farad\u00ee to his own time, is again continued by Ibn Al Abb\u00e2r, and Abu'l Hasan Haz\u00eem of Carthagena. In editing this curious and instructive book, Signor Codera has rendered a service to Oriental science which merits acknowledgment. Although the reviewer indicates that the edition is in some respects inadequate in satisfying philological requirements, he bears evidence to the fact that much very learned information is conveyed in the 1440 biographical notices which it places before the reader. Three indices are appended, one topographical, one biographical, and one bibliographical. On the completion of the \"Bibliotheca,\" it is intended to supply a general biographical index covering the whole of the names therein contained. Such a task, if well performed, would afford welcome aid to students of Arabic literature. The third volume of the \"Bibliotheca Arabica-hispana,\" by MM. Codera and Ribera, has also been issued. Its title is \"Desiderium Qu\u00e6rentis historiam virorum populi Andalusiae auctore Adh-Dhabb\u00e9. Ad fidem codicis Escorialiensis Arabice nunc primum ediderunt Franc. Codera et Jul. Ribera.\" 8vo. Madrid, 1885.\n\nIn the Litterarische Centralblatt, No. 26 of 20th, June, is a notice of the \"Saadia Al-Faj\u00fbmi, Arabische Psalmen-\"\n\u00fcbersetzung, nach einer M\u00fcnchener Handschrift herausgegeben und in Deutsche \u00fcbertragen,\u201d von Dr. S. H. Margulies, 1. Theil. In No. 27 \u201cDie Zahiriten, ihr Lehrsystem und ihre Geschichte,\u201d by Dr. Goldziher, is favourably reviewed as being a very important contribution to our knowledge of the development of Musalman jurisprudence and theology, and in No. 31 \u201cDas Patriarchat bei den Alten Arabern, \u00dcbersetzung aus dem Holl\u00e4ndischen,\u201d by Mr. G. A. Wilken of Leiden, is noticed. To this last allusion has already been made.\n\nIn the Deutsche Literaturzeitung, No. 22, of 30th May, Ranke\u2019s \u201cWeltgeschichte, V.; die Arabische Weltherrschaft und das Reich Karls des Grossen,\u201d is reviewed by M. Kaufmann, who praises the chapters dealing with the commencement and development of Islam as distinguished by valuable evidences of special research. In No. 36 of 5th September is a notice by M. J. Schmidt of Roche\u2019s \u201cTrente-deux ans \u00e0 travers l\u2019Islam 1832-64, vol. ii. Mission \u00e0 la Mecque; Bugeaud en Afrique\u201d; a work also noticed in the Saturday Review of 4th July.\n\nAmong books issued during the past year may be specially mentioned \u201cTranslations of Ancient Arabian Poetry chiefly Prae-Islamic,\u201d by Charles J. Lyall. Reviews of this volume appear both in the Academy and Athen\u00e6um of the 3rd October. The first, bearing the well-known signature of R. F. Burton, gives ready testimony to the translator\u2019s exceptional scholarship, but does not find in his translation that most rare of all rarities in renderings from Oriental texts, the \u201cpeculiar cachet of the original.\u201d Burton\u2019s own words immediately following this expression are worthy of repetition, not only from their characteristic force, but to show the difficulty of the task signified: \u201cThis old-world Oriental poetry is spirit-stirring as a trumpet sound, albeit the words be thin. It is heady as the golden wine of Libanus, which tastes like water and is potent as brandy\u2014the clear contrary of our nineteenth-century style. It can\nbe represented only by the verse of the old English ballad, or by the prose of the Book of Job.\" From the review in the Athen\u00e6um, the concluding passage may be taken to express the general opinion entertained of Mr. Lyall's great merits: \"The book is replete with novel and valuable materials for the student of poetry, and we do not doubt it will receive the hearty welcome which so original, scholarly, and charming a collection deserves.\" There may also be noted: R. Dvorak, \"Ueber die Fremdw\u00f6rter in Kor\u00e2n\"\u2014\"Ibn Ginn\u00fb,\" de flexione libellus, arabice nunc primum edidit in latinum sermonem transtulit, notis illustravit Godfredus Hoburg. H.

[Upon this last work M\u00fcller remarks in the Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for August, that these MSS. which, with the exception of 17 relating to Turkish and Persian-speaking districts, belong entirely to Arabic Literature, were collected by Herr von Kremer during a period of over 30 years (1849\u201380) in various centres of Muhammadan life in the East.] Ahlwardt (W.), Verzeichniss der Landberg'schen Sammlung Arabischen Handschriften. Socin's \"Arabische Grammatik. Paradigmen, Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar,\" of which an English translation has appeared: \"Le Livre de Sibawaihi: Trait\u00e9 de Grammaire Arabe,\" tome ii. part 1, by H. Derenbourg. Dieterici (F.), Die Abhandlungen der Ichw\u00e2n es Saf\u00e2 in Auswahl. Fifth edition of the \"Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais Arabe des dialectes vulgaires d'Algerie, du Tunisie, de Maroc et d'Egypte, avec la pro-\nnonciation figur\u00e9e en lettres latines,\" by J. J. Marcel. All foreign systems of transliterating Arabic must, unfortunately, be perplexing; a truth self-evident to the English tyro, in the difficulty experienced by his countrymen in accepting an uniform system for themselves.\n\nTwo publications by Brill of Leiden merit remark. M\u00fcller's Geographie der Arabischen Halbinsel of Abu Muhammad al Hasan bin Ahmad bin Yakub bin Yusuf bin Dawud Abi Bakr, and the Kitabu 'l Bald\u00e1n of Abi Bakr Ahmad bin Muhammad al Hamad\u00e1ni.\n\nSamaritan.\u2014Dr. Kohn, in his review of the first volume of the Bibliotheca Samaritana, noticed in our last year's report, and again mentioned this year among the contents of the Z.D.M.G. vol. xxxix. pt. 2, points out that the remnant of Samaritan which has survived the lapse of time has not received the attention which it demands. Of original Samaritan literature still extant, but a very small portion is accessible, while in respect to the numerous MSS. which lie inedited in the Libraries of Oxford, St. Petersburg, Paris, Berlin, etc., not only the contents, but even the titles are scarcely known. The Bibliotheca Samaritana of Dr. Heidenheim should remedy this manifest deficiency. Its contemplated periodical issue in the Hebrew Square character, with the requisite Introduction, Notes and Supplement, should supply a series of valuable texts, and material for the thorough elucidation not only of the history, but of the language and religious and spiritual life of the Samaritans. In conclusion, Dr. Kohn regards the Bibliotheca Samaritana in the light of a praiseworthy undertaking; but he holds that if it is to promote the study of Samaritan, it must be carried to completion with more attention to grammatical precision and accuracy, and more systematic and scholarly supervision than hitherto evinced. The second volume of the Bibliotheca Samaritana has recently been published.\nHittite.\u2014Notwithstanding certain specific objections to some of the author's conclusions, Dr. Francis Brown's criticism of the \"Empire of the Hittites,\" in vol. i. of the American Journal of Archaeology, admits that Dr. Wright's book \"opens a new and attractive field to the general reader, and will be welcome to those who are concerned for the historical accuracy of the Old Testament.\" He further points out the strong evidence that there was once a large and formidable population between the Middle Euphrates and Orontes, with some kind of natural organization, to which the Assyrians gave the name of Chatti... and that the \"Chittites\"\u2014A.V. Hittites\u2014of the Bible present the same name in a very slightly modified form.\n\nSyriac.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um, 13th June, states that there is in the press a Neo-Syriac (dialect of Salam\u0101s) translation of Thomas \u00e0 Kempis by Father B\u0113djan. In the Academy of the 20th June is Capt. (Sir Richard) Burton's review of \"Kalilah and Dimnah, or the Fables of Bidpai, being an account of their literary history, with an English Translation of the later Syriac version of the same and Notes,\" by J. G. N. Keith-Falconer. The eighth Essay in the \"Studia Biblica\" is a careful study by Dr. Gwilliam of a Syriac version of Saint Matthew and Saint Mark in the Tattam collection.\n\nThe advertised course on Semitic languages at the Johns Hopkins University comprises no less than thirteen series of Lectures for advanced students, among them being one each for Syriac, Aramaean, Ethiopic, Babylonian, Akkadian and Sumerian.\n\nAt the May meeting of the American Oriental Society in Boston (1885), Professor Hall reported receipt of a letter from Professor Albert Long, intimating that he had found a fragment of a Syriac MS. of the Gospels, containing a portion of St. Luke. It was not Peshitto, but in the style\nof the Harklensian version. He had also received a package of fragments of Syrian MSS. from the Rev. Dr. Hayes Ward, obtained from a monastery in the T\u00fbr (name not given), rather valuable as specimens of writing than for other reasons. Of two carefully examined, one, a leaf from a Lectionary, was in splendid Estrangela, of uncertain age, containing portions of lessons from three of the four Gospels: the other was in old Estrangela, and Professor N\u00f6ldeke had identified it as almost a similar text to one found in Cureton's Ancient Syriac documents\u2014a part of a Syriac translation of Eusebius. Of the remaining fragments, the most remarkable was a folio (two leaves) of vellum, each leaf rather over 16 by 11\u00bd inches in dimension: it was a service-book, written in magnificent monumental Estrangela. One on vellum, written in old Jacobite, contained an entire rubric, \"Supplications of (the feast of) my Lord James (or Jacob).\"\n\nAmong the new books on Philology advertised in the Athen\u00e6um's special List on the 18th July last year, was the Verzeichniss der Sachau'schen Sammlung Syrischer Handschriften.\n\nEthiopic, or Himyaritic.\u2014Under the heading Saba\u00efsche Glossen, the Austrian Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient has a learned notice of Dr. J. H. Mordtmann's paper on new Himyaritic Inscriptions, the third in the list of contents, vol. xxxix. part 2 of the German Oriental Society's Journal, before specified.\n\nAryan Languages.\u2014Sanscrit.\u2014Among the papers before specified in the contents of the four parts of the Z.D.M.G. may be selected for repetition under this head: 1. Theodor Aufrecht's \"Strophen von K\u00e2lid\u00e2sa\":\u2014in this the Professor has brought together those verses which, in the Subh\u00e2shita and other writings accessible to him, have been ascribed to K\u00e2lid\u00e2sa, but which are not to be found in any work of his\nat present known to exist. 2. Dr. F. Kielhorn's \"Pr\u0101k\u1e5bitw\u00f6rte in Mah\u0101bh\u0101shya\":\u2014the writer observes that a few Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit words are known to exist in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101shya, but the more interesting of these do not appear to have hitherto received any attention.\n\nIn the Oesterreichsche Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for May and June, 1885, Professor George B\u00fchler, of Vienna, reviews at length \"A Second Report in Search of Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Circle.\" Like the former report, he considers it to be replete with matter both interesting and instructive; and he remarks that Dr. Petersen can render a very great service to his colleagues if he will see that all the Sanskrit anthologies are printed. In the number for July Professor B\u00fchler speaks in high terms of Professor Jolly's \"Tagore Law Lectures,\" a work useful to the general student of Sanskrit, and the first attempt to trace in a comprehensive manner the historical development of some of the most interesting topics of the Hindu Law. His confirmation of the discovery that the so-called Br\u012bhat or V\u1e5biddha Manu was a later recension of Bh\u1e5bigu's Samhit\u0101, deprives of its foundation the former opinion that \"our Manu must be later than the fifth century, because its predecessor, the V\u1e5biddha Manu, enumerated the signs of the Zodiac.\" In the number for August, Dr. Rudolf Meringer reviews the first volume of M. A. Bergaigne's \"Etudes sur le Lexique du Rigveda,\" and trusts that the appearance of his work will have the effect of giving fresh impetus to the discussion of questions connected with this particular subject.\n\nIn the Deutsche Literaturzeitung, No. 23, \"The Sankhya Aphorisms of Kapila, with Illustrative Extracts from the Commentaries,\" translated by Dr. Ballantyne, 3rd edition, is reviewed by M. Deussen, who considers it to be the best work on the subject. In No. 29 M. Garbe reviews \"La Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e de la Bhagavadg\u012bt, \u00e9tudi\u00e9e en elle m\u00eame et dans ses origines,\" par Ph. Colinet, which he considers well done, though diffuse;\nand in No. 30 is a review of Prof. Edgren's Sanskrit Grammar, which is said to be based essentially upon Whitney's, repeating its isolated faults, but behind it in exactness of detail and correctness of printing.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society at Boston, on the 6th May, 1885, Professor Hopkins stated his reasons for dissenting from Burnell's argument in regard to the date of the M\u0101nava-dharma-\u00e7\u0101stra. We cannot, he thinks, judge the age of the work by its latest portions; we have no grounds for narrowing the date to the time of Pulike\u00e7i I. Professor Whitney concurred in this view. He further alluded to his own work on \"Numerical Results from Indexes of Sanskrit Tense and Conjugation Stems,\" as nearly through the press; described its character, and gave some examples of the statistics of classification he had adopted. Prof. Lanman continued the discussion, and took occasion to describe a Sanskrit manuscript of a Hindu treatise on Logic, which had come into his hands since the October meeting. A paper by Professor Edgren, of the Nebraska University, on the so-called Tan-class in Sanskrit was presented by Professor Whitney. Professor M. Bloomfield, of Baltimore, remarked on some Vedic derivatives of the root pra\u00e7 \"ask,\" hitherto misunderstood, and referred to the respective translations of a Vedic hymn by Weber, Ludwig, and Grill as missing the point of the original.\n\nThe Academy of the 6th June quotes from the Cambridge University Reporter, Mr. Cecil Bendall's preliminary report on his tour in Northern India in the previous winter in search of Sanskrit MSS. In its issue of the 29th August we are told that among those collected in Nepal is a palm-leaf copy of N\u0101rada written in A.D. 1407, which contains an entirely new recension of that law-giver's code. The title of the work, M\u0101nava ny\u0101ya \u00e7\u0101stram N\u0101rada prokt\u0101 samhit\u0101, confirms the Indian tradition as to its connection with the celebrated Institutes of Manu. Mr. Bendall has lent the\nMS. to Professor Jolly of W\u00fcrzburg, who is printing the text. The *Athen\u00e6um* of the 15th August, 1885, notifies that Mr. Cecil Bendall, Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, and in charge of the Oriental Books at the British Museum, has accepted the post of Professor of Sanskrit at University College, London.\n\nPart I. of the Catalogue of the Old Collection of Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of Deccan College, issued during the past year, was prepared under the superintendence of Professor F. Kielhorn, and Part II. with Index by Prof. R. G. Bhandarkar.\n\nOn the authority of the *Academy*, we learn that in the course of last year, Mr. Anundoram Borooah, Officiating Magistrate and Collector, was preparing for the press a critical edition of the Amarakosa, to which end he had borrowed a large number of MSS. from various quarters, among them the entire Kosa Collection of the India Office, which is probably the richest that any library can boast. Subject to receiving substantial support, he intended to issue a cheap edition of the text, with the commentaries of Xirasvami and Rayamukta in full, and material extracts from all other important commentaries.\n\nThe *Academy* of July 4 notices an interesting monograph by Dr. Von Brandke on *Dy\u0101us Asura, Ahura-Mazd\u0101 und die Asuras*, the aim of which is to show, by passages from the Rig-Veda and other works, the true signification of *Asura*.\n\nThe *Academy* of July 11 publishes the Latin diploma of the University of G\u00f6ttingen, conferring the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy upon Prof. Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, of the Deccan College, Bombay. This is an honourable recognition of the learned Professor's high proficiency in the ancient languages of India. Professor Bhandarkar has long been an Honorary Member of the London Royal Asiatic Society, and is an important con-\ntributor to the number of the Journal of the Bombay Branch, noticed in p. lxi ante.\n\nIn reviewing \"The Ordinances of Manu,\" translated from the Sanskrit, with an Introduction by the late A. C. Burnell, the Athen\u00e6um of June 6, 1885, states that the translator's sound scholarship and accurate knowledge of Indian literature qualify him in an eminent degree for the undertaking. He had only however reached the beginning of the eighth lecture when failing health compelled him to lay aside his pen, and for the remaining five lectures we are indebted to Dr. E. W. Hopkins. It is added that a happier choice of an editor could not have been made, that Dr. Hopkins had cordially entered into the scheme of the work as originally devised, and had ably supplemented Dr. Burnell's annotations left incomplete at his death.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of June 13 contains an interesting communication from Professor Max M\u00fcller, furnishing proof of the existence of the \"Horiuzi Palm Leaves\" in A.D. 1235, in which year they are spoken of with reference to their former history. In the 4th and 18th July and 8th August a discussion is carried on between Professors Max M\u00fcller and Beal as to the value of the historical and pal\u00e6ographical evidence of the high antiquity assigned to these leaves. Dr. G. B\u00fchler, C.I.E., contributes a note on this subject to the Indian Antiquary for August, intimating that a second old palm-leaf MS. had been newly discovered in Japan by Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio. It is but a single fragment, but possesses high importance for Indian Pal\u00e6ography. The contents are Buddhistic and probably belong to one of the larger S\u00fbtras. Short as the piece is, it furnishes several new words not hitherto found in Sanskrit dictionaries.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of 11th July mentions that the number of the \"Anecdota Oxoniensia (Aryan Series),\" then ready for publication, would contain the \"Dharmasamgraha,\" a collection of Buddhist technical terms. The materials were collected.\nby Kenyiu Kasawara, one of the Buddhist priests who came from Japan to Oxford to study Sanskrit, and who died soon after his return to Japan. Prof. Max M\u00fcller, assisted by Dr. Wenzel, the well-known Tibetan scholar, who has been resident at Oxford for several years, had superintended the work when passing through the press. It contains copious notes and indices.\n\nProf. George B\u00fchler writes to the Academy of 15th August giving a short description of a Saurayantra belonging to Mr. Whitley Stokes, which, being of good execution, and apparently some antiquity\u2014perhaps between 300 and 400 years\u2014he deems worthy of notice. This tablet was probably used in worshipping the sun, just as the Bhaumayantra in the adoration of the planet Mars. Edgren\u2019s \u201cCompendious Sanskrit Grammar, with a brief sketch of Scenic Prakrit,\u201d being No. xiii. of Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s Simplified Grammars, is commended in the Literarisches Centralblatt of the 24th October. Reviews of the same work, both in the main favourable, had before appeared in the Academy of 11th and Athenaeum of 25th July. So also Jolly\u2019s \u201cOutlines of an History of the Hindu Law of Partition, Inheritance, and Adoption, as contained in the original Sanskrit treatises,\u201d is again favourably noticed in the Deutsche Litteraturzeitung of the 14th November. In the Academy of January 9 is a letter from Professor Max M\u00fcller stating that he is not aware any Sanskrit scholar had ever referred the date of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a to later than the 7th century A.D., but as regards that century the testimony of Subandhu was available. The same paper of the 13th February, referring to Sanskrit study in Benares, mentions that the Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya of the White Yajurveda with Uvata\u2019s Commentary; Bhartrihari\u2019s Vakyapadiya; Tantra-v\u1e5bttika, the great M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 work of Kum\u0101rilabhatta; and Pras\u0101tap\u0101dabh\u0101shya, the oldest commentary on the Vai\u015beshika-s\u016btras, are in progress in the local series. Other items of literary interest in connection with the above-mentioned city\nare also given. The Academy of the 13th March contains a notice by Professor Max M\u00fcller of Oriental translations of the National Anthem; including one by Professor Weber of new lines added to the old and well-known verse. One alleged objection to these is that they deviate from the rhyme and metre of the original, an objection to which Captain Temple has something to say in reply in the next week's issue, calling forth a rejoinder in the number succeeding. We learn from the same source that the Executive Committee of Cornell University had decided to discontinue the Chair of Sanskrit and Modern Oriental Languages, occupied for 17 years by Professor Roehrig. In the philology notes of the same journal of April 10th we learn that Dr. B\u00f6htlingk's Sanskrit Dictionary was near completion, and that the same scholar was about to re-edit Panini's Grammar. The following number contains a careful review of Whitney's Roots, Verb-Forms, etc., a work already mentioned. Mr. Cecil Bendall's instructive and elaborately-illustrated volume describing a \"Journey of Literary and Archaeological Research in Nep\u00e1l and Northern India,\" will be welcome, not only to archaeologists, but to Sanskrit scholars and connoisseurs in Jain MSS. It is brief, but full of information well tabulated and put together, and supplements the previous items of detached information received on the subject.\n\nAmong books recently published in Sanskrit, or relating thereto, may be mentioned:\u2014Raja\u00e7ekhara Pracandap\u00e2ndava. Ein Drama. Zum ersten Male hrsg. v. C. Cappellen:\u2014Charu-Niti Patha. By Kalikrishna Datta:\u2014Madhava et Malati. Drame en dix actes, et un prologue de Bhavabhouti. Traduit du Sanskrit par G.

Neil:\u2014Panini\u2019s Grammatik, hrsg. u. \u00fcbers. v. Otto B\u00f6htlingk:\u2014Indo-Germanische Grammatiken, Band ii. Supplement:\u2014The Roots, Verb Forms, and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language, a supplement to his Sanskrit Grammar, by William Dwight Whitney, Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology in Yale College (Leipzig, 1885). Also German translations of the same book by H. Zimmer.\n\nVol. xxvi. of the Sacred Books of the East contains part 2, or books iii. and iv., of the Satapatha Brahmana, translated by Professor Eggeling, of which the former part, or books i. and ii. appeared in vol. xii. of this remarkable series.\n\nAn article headed \u201cTranslations of the Rig Veda,\u201d which appeared in the Athen\u00e6um of the 6th February last, is short but suggestive. It refers to the increasing popularity which Vedic Literature, and more particularly the Rig Veda itself, has acquired among native students. An edition of the latter, begun at Bombay in 1876, with both a Marathi and English translation; Dayananda Sarasvati\u2019s edition, with translations and commentary in Sanskrit and Hindi; and the first volume of a quite recent Bengali translation by Mr. R. C. Dutt, of the\nBengal Civil Service\u2014all these bear testimony to the attraction of this branch of study to the present generation of Indian scholars.\n\nP\u0101li.\u2014In the Academy of the 19th September Dr. R. Morris writes that all who take an interest in P\u0101li philology and Buddhist Literature will hail the appearance of the excellent and carefully-edited text of the Sutta Nip\u0101ta which had just been issued by the P\u0101li Text Society among its publications for 1884. The Journal of the Society for the same year, and part 1, Sagatha-Vagga, of the Samyutta-Nik\u0101ya of the Sutta-Pitaka, edited by M. L\u00e9on Feer, have also been published. In vol. xx. of the \"Sacred Books of the East\" are Vinaya texts, translated from the P\u0101li by T. W. Rhys Davids and Hermann Oldenberg.\n\nM\u00fcller's Simplified Grammar of the P\u0101li Language receives a lengthy notice in the Literatur-Blatt for October\u2014December, 1885. This is one of the issues of Tr\u00fcbner's Simplified Grammar Series edited by Dr. Rost. It is also commented on in the Academy of the 3rd October, where it is stated that, notwithstanding some shortcomings, it is the best book on P\u0101li Grammar now obtainable in any European language.\n\nPr\u0101krit.\u2014Vol. xxii. of the Sacred Books of the East is \"Gaina Sutras. Translated from Pr\u0101krit by H. Jacobi. Part I. Ak\u0101r\u0101nga Sutra; the Kalpa Sutra.\"\n\nSinhalese.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of 25th July notices \"A Catalogue of P\u0101li, Sinhalese and Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Temple Libraries of Ceylon,\" recently printed at the Government Press, Colombo. The Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r Louis de Zoysa, Government translator, who had for a number of years been engaged on its compilation, unfortunately died before completion of his work. He was a Sinhalese gentleman of high linguistic attainments, and a frequent contributor\nto the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Colombo. As far back as the autumn of 1875 he had reported to the Government of the island on the results of his inspection of the temple libraries. In the present publication those results are classified in all their details under appropriate heads; but a last section, to have been reserved for works of a miscellaneous kind, was not ready for the press at the author's death, and the Catalogue is so far incomplete. In its present state, however, it is a valuable contribution to our knowledge of P\u0101li and Sinhalese literature.\n\nWe gather from the Academy of the 29th August that Shakspere is in favour with the natives of Ceylon, for whose benefit the Two Gentlemen of Verona has been translated, with the addition of verses to be sung in chorus in the Sinhalese stage adaptation.\n\nPahlavi.\u2014Vol. xxiv. of the Sacred Books of the East contains the third part of Dr. West's Pahlavi Texts, of which the previous parts are in vols. v. and xviii. It consists of the Din\u00e2\u00ee M\u00e2in\u00f4g-i-Khirad, or Opinions of the Spirit of Wisdom; the Sikand G\u00fbm\u00e2n\u00eek Vig\u00e2r, or the doubt-dispelling explanation; and the Sad Dar, or hundred subjects.\n\nZend.\u2014A curious dissertation on the words agaretem garen\u00f4 (sic), interpreted as the majesty, or happy state of the just, leading on to the definition of other expressions in the Avesta, is to be found in the Mus\u00e9on of August, 1885, and is from the pen of Professor E. Wilhelm of the Jena University.\n\nIn the Literatur-Blatt, No. iv. of the second volume or last quarter of 1885, is a notice of the first part of Karl Geldner's Avesta, which promises, by the great care taken in compiling and collating, to supply the deficiencies of previous editions, and to merit the thanks of all Zend students.\n\nUnder the title of \"Civilization of the Eastern Iranians in\nancient times, with an Introduction on the Religion of the Avesta,\u201d Mr. D\u0101r\u0101b Dastur Peshotan Sanj\u00e1n\u00e1, B.A., member of the German Oriental Society, has completed a translation of Dr. Wilhelm Geiger\u2019s Ostiranische Kultur im Alterthum, lately published by Frowde.\n\nPersian.\u2014M. James Darmesteter\u2019s inaugural lecture at the Coll\u00e8ge de France last year, under the designation of Coup-d\u2019\u0153il sur la histoire de la Perse, has been published, as well as his clever paper on the Mahdi, in the \u201cBiblioth\u00e8que Orientale Elzevirienne.\u201d No. 41 of the series is \u201cLes Langues Perdues de la Perse et de l\u2019Assyrie. I. Perse,\u201d by Joachim M\u00e9nant.\n\nThe Academy of September 5 states that Mr. A. N. Wollaston\u2019s Complete English-Persian Dictionary is in an advanced state of preparation; that it will appear in a royal quarto volume of about one thousand pages; but that, notwithstanding a grant in aid from the Secretary of State, the publishers appeal to Oriental Societies, and individuals interested in Persian, to subscribe for copies to defray the great cost of publication.\n\nMr. Finn\u2019s Persian for Travellers is said by the reviewer in the Academy of the 26th September to be a welcome contribution to our word-books for \u201call scholars who are anxious for any addition to the materials now existing for a compilation of a dictionary of the living language of Ir\u00e1n.\u201d But he objects, as the Athen\u00e6um had done before, to the mode of transcription which has been followed for Anglicizing Persian words.\n\nMr. Sidney Churchill has a short paper in the Academy of December 19, on the Matla\u2018u\u2019sh-Shams, vol. ii. issued from the Tehran Press by the San\u012bu\u2019d-daulah. It is mainly an account of the city of Mash-had and its notabilia.\n\nA second edition of Palmer\u2019s Simplified Grammar of Hindustani, Persian and Arabic, and the first volume of a\nDictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais-Persan, by J. B. Nicolas, A\u2014K, are reported available. In the Recueil des textes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019histoire des Seljoucides, par M. Th. Houtsma, vol. i., \u201cHistoire des Seljoucides du Kerman par Muhammad Ibrahim,\u201d has been quite recently published by Brill.\n\nThe second volume of M. Schefer\u2019s Chrestomathie Persane for the use of the pupils at the Ecole Sp\u00e9ciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, belongs to that class of publications which the industrious and able author knows so well how to prepare. The only flaw is one which may be rather apparent to the eye of an English than a Continental critic; and that is, the diminutive character of the Persian type.\n\n\u201cNotes of a Journey from Kasvin to Hamadan, across the Karaghan Country,\u201d is the title of a lately published volume (Madras, 1885), in which Mr. J. D. Rees, Under Secretary to Government, describes his personal experience of Persia. In a literary point of view its official form hardly does justice to so promising a launch into the world of letters. The book is favourably noticed in the Athen\u00e6um of February 27th, and has met with like welcome in other periodicals.\n\nThe Messrs. Scribner, of New York, have issued a new volume entitled \u201cPersia, the Land of the Im\u00e1ms,\u201d by Mr. James Basset, a Missionary of the Presbyterian Board. His narrative extends over a period of fourteen years, or from 1871 to 1885. That part of it which relates to Urm\u00eda and the country between Urm\u00eda and Hamadan will, perhaps, be the most attractive to readers of travel, as it is less known than the author\u2019s routes from Tehran to Mashhad on one side, and to Bushahr on the other, which have been repeatedly traversed and described by Englishmen.\n\nVol. i. part i. of the Umdatu\u2019t Taw\u00e1rikh, in Persian, by Lala Sohan Lal, to be completed in eight volumes, has been announced among Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s new Oriental publications. It is edited in English by Captain R. C. Temple.\n\nThe \u201cTrois Com\u00e9dies traduites du Dialecte Turc Azeri en\nPersian par Mirza Dja'far et publi\u00e9es d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9dition de Tehr\u00e1n avec un Glossaire et des Notes\u201d forms an inviting little volume for which students of Persian are indebted to M. Barbier de Meynard and the late Stanislas Guyard. For the more proficient, the Tehran edition itself is preferable, having the stamp of genuineness, both in binding and type, without a trace of the European printer or publisher. The three \u201ccomedies\u201d in the French are all to be found in the Persian edition; and indeed other dramatic sketches also.\n\nBal\u00fachi.\u2014The Reverend Arthur Lewis\u2019 \u201cBal\u00fachi Stories,\u201d in the language spoken by the nomad tribes of the Sulaiman Hills, was noticed in the Academy of June 6, 1885. They were recommended as likely to interest both the philologist and student of folk-lore; and, having been taken down from the lips of the Panj\u00e1b Frontier Bal\u00fachis, are undoubtedly genuine. Translations are attached.\n\nBrah\u00fasi.\u2014A contribution to the Asiatic Society\u2019s Journal by Dr. Th. Duka promises to throw additional light on the study of this language, which Mr. Cust has classed with Pashtu, to represent the Iranic branch of the Aryan Family. It will appear in January.\n\nUrd\u00fa.\u2014Mr. Platts has done good service by his publication of the Dictionary of Urd\u00fa, Classical Hindi and English; and his work has met with the favour which it merits at the hands of the reviewer. The commendation given to it in the Athen\u00e6um of the 20th June (1885) is not merely general: it applies to the book in detail and on given grounds. There can scarcely be two opinions on the proposition that \u201cno Hindustani lexicographer should be without a complete knowledge of Persian, and, as a natural consequence, of all the Arabic phraseology which forms part and parcel of the modern Iranian tongue.\u201d And it is satisfactory to learn that such\ncondition \"is fulfilled in an excellent way by Mr. Platts, who is as competent in the one language as in the other.\"\n\nBengali.\u2014We learn that the first part of an Encyclop\u00e6dic dictionary in Bengali, edited by two native scholars, has been published in India. It contains descriptive derivations of Sanskrit and Bengali words with Sutras quoted from Panini the grammarian; Arabic, Persian and Hindi words introduced into the Bengali language; notes on the ancient and modern religious beliefs of India, the Vedas, Pur\u00e1ns, Tantras and other sacred books; besides short articles embracing the whole range of modern science. A grammar of the language, by Mr. J. F. Blumhardt, of the British Museum, has been notified as in preparation. Mr. H. A. D. Philips has published Kopul Kundala, a Tale of Bengali life, translated from the Bengali of Bunkim Chandra Chatterjee.\n\nBih\u00e2r\u00ee.\u2014The Academy of the 20th June last year has much to say with reference to the first part of the Comparative Dictionary of the Bih\u00e2r\u00ee Language, on which Dr. Hoernle and Mr. G. A. Grierson had been for long engaged. Opposite the title-page are four maps showing the progress of the language from the old Prakrit of B.C. 500 to the Bih\u00e2r\u00ee dialects of the present day. The part comprises an introduction of fifty pages, containing an exposition of the system of transliteration and spelling adopted by the editors, and other necessary details; forty pages of dictionary proper, and ten pages of the promised Index to the Ram\u0101yan of Tul\u2019s\u012b D\u0101s. Although nominally a dictionary of the Bih\u00e2r\u00ee language, it deals scientifically with all the Aryan languages of India, from Sindhi on the extreme west, to Assamese on the extreme east. According to the \"Calcutta Englishman,\" it would be impossible to convey any idea of the diligence and erudition displayed by Dr. Hoernle and Mr. Grierson upon a subject apparently so uninviting. A glance\nat the list of philological works laid under contribution will be enough to convince the reader of the wide and profound character of the authors' investigations. Another review of the Dictionary is in the Austrian Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for December.\n\nMr. Grierson has also published parts i. to iv. of \"Seven Grammars of the Dialects and Sub-dialects of the Bih\u0101r\u012b Language,\" compiled under the orders of the Government of Bengal. They are thus arranged:\u2014I. Introductory, with map. II. Bhojpuri dialect of Shahabad, Saran, Champaran, North Muzaffarp\u016br and the Eastern portion of N.W. Provinces. III. Magadhi dialect of South Patna and Gaya. IV. Maithil Bhojpuri dialect of Central and South Muzaffarp\u016br. This gentleman's work on \"Bih\u0101r Peasant Life\" is replete with information of great value to scholars and general readers, is a worthy specimen of the resources of the Bengal Secretariat Press, and cannot fail to enhance the already high reputation of its author.\n\nThe Homeward Mail of 6th July says that a choice literature of vernacular Beng\u0101l\u012b has been called into existence of late years and that the province of Bih\u0101r has gained especial literary distinction. Foremost among the pioneers of progress is noted the Khadga Vil\u0101s Press at Bangkipur, which rapidly sends forth work after work in Hindi, each steadily rising in the scale of improvement. As an instance is given the Bh\u0101sti\u0101-S\u016bra, or a selection from the best writers in Hindi, in the first part of which are specimens from Lall\u016b L\u0101l, R\u0101j\u0101 Siva Pras\u0101d, B\u0101b\u016b Harischandra, Sri Giridhara D\u0101s, Rama Tiw\u0101r\u012b and B\u0101b\u016b Gad\u0101dhara, all of whom have made their mark in the vernacular of the North. The Bh\u016btatt-waprad\u012bp is cited as an excellent work on physical geography by Munsh\u012b R\u0101m Prak\u0101sh L\u0101l, while the Mah\u0101r\u0101s\u0101 N\u0101tak is a dramatic version of part of the Bh\u0101gavata Purana by L\u0101l Khadga Bah\u0101dur Malla.\nAsamese.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um, 26th September, notes a remarkable revival of linguistical research in Assam, mainly due to the enlightened zeal of Mr. E. Stack, of the Shillong Secretariat. The \"Outline Grammar of the Kach\u00e1ri Language,\" by the Rev. S. Endle, has been succeeded by a \"Short Account of the Kachchar Naga Tribe, with an Outline Grammar, Vocabulary and Illustrative Sentences,\" by Mr. C. A. Soppitt, a young officer in administrative charge of the North Kachar Hills. The Kachcha Nagas live west of the Angami Nagas, between these and the Khasis; their language has affinities with Mikir and Kach\u00e1ri. The same gentleman is now engaged upon a Kuki grammar, while Mr. Needham's \"Abor Grammar\" is in type, and Mr. MacCabe's \"Angami Naga Grammar\" ready for the press. The last-named language is, in spite of its tribal designation, quite different from the Kachcha Naga, and is a tonic tongue. Mr. Stack himself is working up his materials towards a grammatical account of the Bhutia Changlo dialect, and is likewise preparing from his rich collectanea a grammar and phrase book of Mikir. The Athen\u00e6um further states that, by order of the Assam Secretariat, Mr. Soppitt has recently printed \"A Historical and Descriptive Account of the Kachari Tribes in the North Cachar Hills, with Specimens of Tales and Folk-lore.\" The history of the Kacharis, who number upwards of 400,000 souls, cannot be traced further back than the beginning of the 14th century. Mention is also made of Mr. C. J. Lyall's able Census Report for Assam; the dictionary of the Garo language under preparation by the American Missionaries at Tura, and the proposed publication of Major Macgregor's \"Notes on the Singphos and their language.\"\n\nAt the Boston May meeting of the American Oriental Society, Prof. Avery analyzed and illustrated the character of the said Garo. He described the language to be one of a numerous and loosely affiliated group of tongues known as Tibeto-Burman; its nearest kindred being the Pani-koch, the\nKachari, the Deori-Chutia, and the Tipura. Reduced to writing by American Baptist missionaries some twenty years ago, the character used was the Bengali. The local government were printing a Tipura vocabulary, and grammars of the Garo and Miri were preparing.\n\nBurmese.\u2014Among the papers read at last year's session of the American Philological Association at Yale was one on the Tibeto-Burman group of languages, by Professor John Avery, of Brunswick. It is stated that a Burmese translation of Dr. W. W. Hunter's \"Brief History of the Indian People\" has been published at Rangoon. The Jardine Prize Essay on \"The Sources and Development of Burmese Law, from the period of the first introduction of Indian Law to that of the British occupation of Pegu,\" by Dr. E. Forchammer, has been published. Of three books on Burma reviewed in the *Athen\u00e6um* of May 1st, Mr. Scott's \"Burma as it was and as it will be,\" and Mr. Grattan Geary's \"Burma after the Conquest, viewed in its Political, Social, and Commercial Aspects from Mandalay,\" are likely to interest the general reader, the first as the work of a specially qualified authority on his subject, the second as that of a pleasant and experienced writer. Mr. Gray's \"Ancient Proverbs and Maxims from Burmese Sources; or the Niti Literature of Burma,\" is rather calculated to draw the attention of specialists.\n\nDravidian Languages.\u2014Tamil\u2014Telugu.\u2014Dr. Pope's appointment as Teacher of Tamil and Telugu at Oxford is an honourable recognition of the reverend gentleman's high qualifications. Formerly warden of the Bishop Cotton College at Bangalore, he has written standard books on the language and literature of Southern India, and has contributed to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe *Academy* of October 3rd, in criticizing M. Seshagiri Sastri's \"Notes on Aryan and Dravidian Philology,\" points\nout that, while the writer's linguistic attainments are exceptionally great, he has failed to make his book useful from want of philological experience and proper guidance.\n\nMalto.\u2014In noticing the \"Introduction to the Malto Language and Vocabulary,\" compiled and published by the Rev. E. Droese, senior Missionary of the Church Missionary Society at Bhagulpur, N.W.P., the Academy of August 8th remarks that Malto is the language of the Paharis or people on the tops of the hills in the Santal country, who call themselves Maler (men). It possesses a philological interest as being generally considered the most northerly offshoot of the Dravidian family of speech prevalent in Southern India. Mr. Droese, while recognizing Dravidian elements, e.g. the pronouns and the first two numerals, indicates many essential particulars in which it differs from the Dravidian type. His work is mentioned by Bishop Caldwell to be a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of the Non-Aryan languages of India. Although there are native Maler Christians, there is at present no Maler missionary, but the gospels and a few hymns have been translated into Malto.\n\nChinese.\u2014The first part of the translation by M. P. L. F. Philastre of the Le Yi King, or book of the revolutions of the Tsheou Dynasty, has been received by the Royal Asiatic Society, and is a worthy issue (vol. viii.) of the Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet, published by the never-tiring and never-failing Ernest Leroux.\n\nParts 3 and 4 of the first volume of the Netherlands-Chinese Dictionary, by Dr. G. Schlegel, have been published by Brill at Leyden in the complete form for which that house is so remarkable.\n\nAccording to a review of Dr. Beal's translation of the \"Si-Yu-Ki, a Buddhist Record of the Western World, by Hiuen Tsiang (A.D. 629),\" in the Academy of the 12th\nSeptember, by Mr. T. W. Rhys-Davids, the results of this new effort in the cause of research will probably be found to be of the greatest permanent value of all the translator's self-sacrificing labours.\n\n\"The Chinese painted by themselves\" is the title of a little book, published in the summer of last year, in which the account of the institutions and manners of the author's native country is stated by the *Academy* (July 16) to be \"well worth reading.\" It is a translation from the French of Col. Tcheng-ki-Tong, Military Attach\u00e9 of the Chinese Embassy in Paris, reviewed in the original in the *Athen\u00e6um*, 26th July, 1884. Vols. xxvii. and xxviii. of the Sacred Books of the East contain the Li Ki, which is part 3 of the Texts of Confucianism, translated by Professor Legge. Parts 1 and 2 will be found in vols. iii. and xvi. respectively.\n\nOf Miss Gordon Cumming's \"Wanderings in China,\" the *Athen\u00e6um* of Feb. 20 says that it \"knows no book of travel which sketches so graphically the Chinaman and his surroundings.\"\n\nAmong other books may be mentioned:\u2014V. Tissot, \"La Chine d'apr\u00e8s les voyageurs les plus r\u00e9cents\"; the Rev. S. Beal, \"Buddhism in China\"; Le Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys, \"Trois Nouvelles Chinoises, traduites pour la premi\u00e8re fois\"; Mr. C. Hunter, \"Bits of Old China\"; E. J. Dukes, \"Scenes along river and road in the Celestial Empire\" (for the Religious Tract Society); and those incidentally mentioned in the notices of reviews and serials.\n\nThe *Athen\u00e6um* of 19th October, in reviewing Balfour's Taoist Texts, considers that his selection of the commentary of L\u00fc Tsu as a basis for translation of the \"Taou-tih-king,\" or Bible of the Taoists, while imparting interest to his work, renders it in some sense unsatisfactory.\n\n*Annamite: Cochin-China.*\u2014Two admirably-printed volumes (the second in two parts) have been issued by Leroux for\nthe \u00c9cole des Langues Vivantes, entitled Kim van Kieu T\u00e2n Truyen, the translation of an Annamite Poem by Nguy\u00ean Du, Hiou tam tri of the Ministry of Rites in the reign of Gia long. The style of the poet is said to be Tonquinese, and the translator received one of the copies from which he prepared his text direct from Tonquin. Roman characters are placed on corresponding pages to those of the French version, which contains many graceful and charming lines.\n\nThe \"Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Acad\u00e9mique Indo-Chinoise de France,\" second series, vol. ii. (1882\u20133), has been issued, and has many papers of archaeological, scientific, and general interest. It opens with an analysis of Inscriptions Khmers (Kamboj) and Inscriptions Qiames de l'ancien Ciampa.\n\nThe ably-conducted periodical which records the progress of research in Cochin-China under the title of \"Excursions et Reconnaissances\" has in its May\u2013June number (1885) four main articles:\u20141. Historical Reminiscences of Saigon and its Environs, by M. Truong Vinh Ky. 2. An Inscription on a statue of Siwa, discovered in a forest which covers the site of the old city of Kampheng Phet, by M. Schmitt. 3. Annamite Tales and Legends, by M. Landes (continued). 4. Notes on the Fish of Lower Cochin-China and Kamboj. In July\u2013August, it has Notes on Annam (Binh Thuan), by M. Aymonier, and a sketch of the Province of Battambang\u2014a contribution, the second part of which appears in January\u2013February, 1886. There is, also, in this last-named issue, a continuation of the Annamite tales and legends; the account of a Siamese inscription at Bangkok, by M. Schmitt, and an Annamite dialogue, \"Bonze et Bonzesse,\" translated from the original by M. Ch\u00e9on.\n\nChina Review.\u2014Mr. E. H. Parker has two articles in No. 5 (March and April, 1885), one of a controversial nature and\none composed of extracts from the \"P'ei-w\u00ean-y\u00fcn-Fu\"; being No. 1 of contributions towards the \"Topography and Ethnology of Central Asia.\" Mr. Piton gives a biographical narrative of two rival statesmen of Ts'in, \"Wei Yen and Fan Ts\u00fc,\" from which we learn that the former was ennobled as Marquis of Yang in B.C. 291, and the latter as Marquis of Ying in B.C. 266. If to these titled officials we add the Marquis of Tang and Duke of Western Chow, other characters in the history, it would appear that patents of nobility were granted in those days as freely as at present. A short paper by Dr. Chalmers on the \"Chinese Ch'ih Measure,\" notices of new books, and notes and queries, provocative of comment, make up a reputable number. The Rev. Hilderic Friend's original tale of \"The Willow Pattern,\" dealing with Chinese life, is favourably noticed; and the narrative of the French Tongking campaign of 1884 is pronounced by the literary critic of the Review to evince great power of observation and description. No. 6 (May and June, 1885), opens with another biographical sketch by Mr. Piton, under the head of \"L\u00fc-Puh-Wei, or from Merchant to Chancellor.\" This is followed by a continuation of Mr. Parker's \"Extracts\" commenced in the last issue. Two papers by Dr. Edkins and one by Dr. Chalmers, notices of new books, and notes and queries, are the remaining contents. Among the books received are a reprint of Dr. Edkins' article, \"The Yi King of the Chinese,\" which appeared in Vol. XVI. Part 3 of this Journal; No. 4, vol. xvi. of the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, in which the only article of Sinologic interest is said to be one by Mr. E. H. Parker on the \"Ancient Language of China.\" The reviewer thinks that the Chinese themselves have \"never shown any really philologic interest . . . but that the whole field of Chinese philology is as yet a barren waste,\" only lately brought under cultivation, in which labourers would do well to pursue each his own course without depreciating the work of another. Mrs. Bryson's \"Child Life in Chinese Homes\"\nmeets with approval, and the \"Cochin-Chine Fran\u00e7aise,\" in Nos. 17-21 of the Saigon \"Excursions et Reconnaissances,\" calls forth the remark that, whatever the political results of French conquests in Indo-China, they will convey immense advantages to the interests of science. Dr. Hirth's \"China and the Roman Orient\" is considered an instance of the expenditure of valuable time and energy on philological research, the results of which are not equivalent to the cost of the chandelle.\n\nTurkish.\u2014The \"Dictionnaire Turo-Fran\u00e7aise,\" by Barbier de Meynard, is a useful and admirable supplement to previous dictionaries, containing words of Turkish origin; Arabic and Persian words used in Osmanli Turkish with their particular significations; proverbs and popular sayings, and a geographical vocabulary of the Ottoman Empire. The fourth part of the 1st volume has been published by the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of May 8 heralds the forthcoming translation by Mr. E. J. W. Gibb of the \"History of the Forty Vazirs,\" a Turkish story-book of the 15th century. It adds that the only complete translation of this collection into a European language is that in German by Dr. Behrnauer (1851), containing 80 subordinate stories; but that, as MSS. differ in the selections made, Mr. Gibb proposes to publish no less than 112 distinct stories collected from separate versions, some of which will be found variants of widely-distributed popular tales.\n\nIn the preface of his little \"Vade Mecum of Ottoman Colloquial Language,\" published in 1885, Dr. J. W. Redhouse promised to prepare a series of more complete and scientific works for the use of those who might wish to penetrate deeper into the arcana of what he justly called the \"really beautiful\" Turkish language. This pledge, which was in part redeemed\nby the publication of a small but excellent English-Turkish and Turkish-English Dictionary in 1856, and of a very complete English-Turkish Lexicon in 1861, is now receiving its crowning fulfilment in the issue of an elaborate and exhaustive Turkish-English Lexicon. This book, three parts of which are out, is being published by the Board of American Missionaries at Constantinople\u00b9 (no English firm having been found willing to take the risk), and will, when finished, form the most complete and trustworthy work of the kind in any European language. It contains 94,000 words, and occupied four years in compilation. But this does not represent anything like the amount of time that has been spent in collecting the materials utilized in compiling it. Some twenty years ago the learned and industrious author commenced an enormous Thesaurus of Arabic, Persian, Ottoman and Eastern Turkish words and phrases, explained at first both in Ottoman Turkish and in English, latterly in English alone. This gigantic undertaking, in which it was intended to include every procurable word in those languages, was brought down to the end of the letter \u03c9, when the long time that would be necessary to complete the work, and the extreme improbability of finding any publisher willing to take it up, determined the author to abandon his Herculean task. The tangible result of years of uninterrupted and loving labour, the huge folio volumes containing upwards of 84,000 words, many explained at great length, were last year (1885) presented by Dr. Redhouse to the British Museum, where, the author modestly hopes \"they may prove useful to young Oriental students in various ways, partly as an inducement to do better, and partly as a warning against attempting too much.\" It is owing to the stores collected during the years of work at the Thesaurus that Dr. Redhouse has been enabled to complete his Ottoman-English Lexicon in the comparatively short space of four\n\n\u00b9 Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. are the agents for its sale in this country.\nyears. Gifted with linguistic talents of a very high order, and having devoted a long life to the study of the Turkish language, and especially to Turkish lexicography, Dr. Redhouse is probably better equipped for the task undertaken than any other living scholar. Under these circumstances it was natural to expect that his work should be in every respect far superior to all existing European Turkish dictionaries. Judging from the three parts that have already appeared, these expectations will be more than realized; numerous words and phrases occurring in the classical writers of Turkey, which are absent from the pages of his predecessors, are to be found here; many meanings unknown to the earlier workers are entered; and in several instances erroneous or defective definitions are corrected or amplified. In preparing this invaluable work, Dr. Redhouse may well be said to have set the seal on his own reputation, and to have placed every student of the Ottoman language or literature under a lasting debt of gratitude.\n\n_Uzbek._\u2014In the _Athen\u00e6um_ of 21st November there is a review of \"Die Scheibaniade:\" an Uzbek Epic Poem in Seventy-six Cantos. The author of the original T\u00fcrki work was Prince Muhammad Salih of Khw\u00e1rizm; and Professor Vamb\u00e9ry has now reprinted the native text with a German translation, introduction, and notes.\n\n_Egyptology._\u2014On this subject there are in the _Academy:_\u2014June 6, 1885, a communication from Dr. W. Pleyte, of Leiden, reviewing the discoveries of M. Naville at Pithom. June 20, an article by M. Naville on the identification of Goshen. August 8 and 15 contain papers by M. Masp\u00e9ro, giving an account of his excavations during the preceding winter:\u2014the discovery of a funereal chapel of the 11th Dynasty, a little distance from El-Khoz\u00e1m, north of Thebes:\u2014an amusingly-told discovery of a mysterious chamber 40 feet\nbelow the surface of the ground in the cemetery of Drongah, south of Si\u00fat, containing more than 200 vases in stone and bronze, probably as old as the 4th or 5th Dynasties. Near the village of El Qa\u00e7aa, a little south of Edfu, was found a tomb dating from the end of the Ptolemaic period. Interesting details are given of the tombs at G\u00e9b\u00e9l\u00e9in, the ancient Aphrodit\u00e9spolis. The second part of M. Masp\u00e9ro's report is chiefly devoted to a description of the Necropolis at Akhmim, near El Hawawish. He concludes by mentioning the discovery at the village of Helleh, of the tomb of an equerry belonging to the time of Ramses III., and the picture of the king's two war-horses: of a temple built by Ramses III. at Mesheikh: while from a Coptic convent near Assu\u00e2n he procures twenty monkish epitaphs of the seventh century, among them those of two Bishops of Phil\u00e6, hitherto unknown. Further details of M. Masp\u00e9ro's work can be learned from his paper read before the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions on the 24th July, and from the accounts forwarded by him from time to time to the \"Journal des D\u00e9bats.\"\n\nAugust 8 has also a notice of the Exhibition of the Objects found by Mr. Flinders Petrie at Naukratis, at the Room of the Royal Archaeological Institute, Oxford Mansion. The same notice tells us that the principal results of the past season's work are:\u20141. Discovery of the site of Naukratis and of the plan of the Streets; 2. Discovery of the remains of the only archaic Greek temple known in Egypt; 3. Discovery of the only series of ceremonial foundation deposits yet known; 4. A large collection of archaic Greek iron tools of the sixth century B.C.; 5. A large collection of archaic Greek pottery, much of it incised with dedications of the sixth and seventh centuries B.C.; 6. The largest number of Egyptian weights yet known; and 7. A series of over a thousand stamped amphora handles. October 3 contains a long review of the Exhibition by Mr.\nErnest A. Gardner, while October 17 and 24 have an account of the Terra-cottas of Naukratis by Miss Amelia B. Edwards. In September 26 she reviews, under the head \"Some Minor Egyptological Literature,\" the following books:\u2014\"Aegypten und Aegyptisches Leben in Altertum,\" by Dr. Adolf Erman; \"Egyptian Religion,\" by J. Lieblein; \"Gammelaegyptisk Religion,\" by J. Lieblein; \"Ueber Alt\u00e4gyptische Religion,\" by J. Lieblein; \"Ueber Pithom, Hero, Klysma nach Naville,\" by A. Dillmann; \"Ged\u00e4chtnissrede auf Karl Richard Lepsius,\" by A. Dillmann; \"Richard Lepsius: ein Lebensbild,\" by G. Ebers; \"Antichit\u00e0 Sarde e loro Provenienza,\" by G. Ebers. August 15 tells us that the Louvre has recently acquired about 31 demotic papyri, chiefly dating from the reigns of Psammetichus and Amasis. October 31 and November 7 contain an account of the third annual general meeting of the Egypt Exploration Fund, and of Mr. Petrie's paper on \"Naukratis,\" and M. Naville's on his excavations in the Delta and identification of Goshen.\n\nNovember 7 has, too, a letter from Dr. G. B\u00fchler on the recent discoveries made by Prof. Karabacek and Drs. Wessely and Krall in the course of their exploration of the Archduke Rainer's famous collection of papyri. In December 5 is a long notice of the Revue Egyptologique, 1881-85, by Miss Amelia B. Edwards, and in December 26 a review of E. A. Wallis Budge's \"The Dwellers on the Nile\" by Thomas Tyler. January 2 and 30, and February 6, have contributions from Mr. Flinders Petrie and Mr. Ernest Gardner, on the progress of discovery at Naukratis. January 2 has also a short communication from Mr. F. Ll. Griffith on the identification of Kom-el-Husn (a three hours' walk south of Naukratis) with Amu. We have most interesting \"Letters from Egypt\" by Professor Sayce, in the Nos. of January 23, February 13, March 20, and May 1. In that of March 20, dated from Luxor, February 26, he gives us some account of\nthe excavations at Assu\u00e1n by General Grenfell and his soldiers. There are also two short notices on this subject by Miss Amelia B. Edwards in March 13 and May 1. In Feb. 13 notice is given of Mr. P. le Page Renouf's appointment as Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, in succession to Dr. Birch, and also of the advent, long looked for, and eagerly awaited, of M. Edouard Naville's edition of the \"Book of the Dead.\" Under the head \"American Jottings,\" Jan. 30 and May 8, we learn that the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund numbers already over five hundred subscribers, and also that Mr. A. W. Thayer, formerly U.S. Consul at Trieste, dedicates to that Fund the entire net proceeds of the sale of his book, \"The Hebrews and the Red Sea.\" In Feb. 27 we have communications from Mr. Petrie and Mr. Griffith from Tell Nebesheh, one of the cemeteries of Tanis, giving a description of the cemetery, and of a temple in which was found a black granite altar of Amenemhat II. (XII. Dynasty), beside which were the thrones of two life-sized statues of kings of that dynasty, and a fragment of a statue important as confirming a geographical inference as to the hieroglyphic name of the nome of Tanis. Two foundation deposits were discovered in the corners of an unimportant building in the cemetery. At the gateway of the enclosure of the temple a headless sphinx in black granite, with inscriptions much erased, but probably dating from the XII. Dynasty, was found; in the temple some sculptured blocks of red granite, two bearing figures of Khem; and the lower part, from waist to ankles, of a statue of Ptah in black granite.\n\nSome of the identifications already made by the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund are noted as follows: Pi-Tum (Pithom)=Hero=Tell Maskhuta; Naukratis=Nebireh; Kes (Goshen)=Phakoussa=Saft-el-Henna; Amu, capital of Libyan nome=Tell Hisn; nome of Am Pehu=Tanite nome, and Am=Tell Nebesheh or Tanis. The same Academy has a\nletter from Mr. Greville Chester on the genuineness of a set of chessmen from Thebes. The number for March 13 has a notice from Mr. Petrie on Tell Fer\u00e2in (Buto), and some further remarks from Mr. Griffith on Tell Nebesheh. March 27 has news of excavations at Naukratis from Mr. Ernest Gardner. April 10 gives us, from Mr. Petrie, an account of more discoveries at Tell Nebesheh, and of the finding, by Mr. Griffith, at Tell Gemayemi, of the traces of a large building and enclosure, with foundation deposits and several bronzes; the remains of a wooden shrine richly inlaid with inscriptions and patterns in coloured glass, unhappily broken up by the decay of the wood; a fine seated statuette of Isis; and a curious set of plaster casts of statues. In May 29 we have recorded the grateful thanks of the Trustees of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts for the large and valuable collection of pottery, metal work, and other objects excavated at Naukratis and San, and presented by the Egypt Exploration Fund in acknowledgment of the American contributions. In the Academy of March 6 is a review of Mr. Petrie's \"Tanis,\" part i., by Georg Ebers.\n\nAt the June meeting of the Society of Biblical Archaeology papers were read on \"The Topography of Northern Syria, with special reference to the Karnak Lists of Thothmes III.,\" by the Rev. H. G. Tomkins; \"The Eclipse in Egyptian Texts,\" by Mr. le Page Renouf; \"The Site of This,\" by Prof. Sayce. The \"Proceedings\" of the Society contain papers by: Mr. Cope Whitehouse on \"The Bahr Yusuf and the Prophecy of Jacob\"; Dr. A. Wiedemann on \"The Queen Pekersala, of the beginning of the Saitic Period,\" on \"The Egyptian Monuments at Venice,\" and \"Notes on the Cult of Set and on the Hyksos Kings\"; Mr. P. le Page Renouf on \"The Myth of Osiris Unnefer\" (see remarks and correspondence on this subject in the Academy of May 8 and 15); and Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge on \"Sepulchral Boxes.\" There are also communications from Prof. Sayce on \"A Hieroglyphical\nInscription at How,\" and from Mr. P. le Page Renouf on \"The name of the Winged Solar Disk on Egyptian Monuments.\"\n\nIn the Revue Egyptologique we have the following communications:\u2014\"On the Poem of Pentaur,\" by J. De Roug\u00e9; Letters to M. Revillout on \"the Fayum Greek contracts in the Louvre,\" from Charles Wessely; on the Ancient Rights of Women, by Victor Revillout; on House Taxation, from a Greek papyrus in the British Museum; from Eugene Revillout, \"Adoption by Mancipation (purchase) in the reign of Amasis, and divers forms of mancipation relating to human beings,\" \"The Prayers for the Dead in Egyptian Epigraphy,\" \"Accounts of the Serapeum,\" Greek papyrus 45 of the British Museum, and a new extract on the subject of the jackal Koufi and the Ethiopian cat; from W. N. Groff, a Letter to M. Revillout on the names Jacob and Joseph in Egyptian.\n\nIn the Illustrated London News of July 18 is a long and interesting paper by Miss Amelia B. Edwards, giving an account of the excavation of the Great Temple of Luxor, carried out under the able direction of M. Masp\u00e9ro, with five illustrations from photographs.\n\nThe Archaeological Journal (No. 164) contains an account of Antiquities from San, by Mr. Flinders Petrie.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of August 29 has a paper by Mr. Cope Whitehouse on the Reian Basin of Lake Moris, and of August 15 a review of Brugsch's \"Religion und Mythologie der alten Aegypter\"; in Dec. 26 is a notice of Commander H. H. Gorringe's \"Egyptian Obelisks\"; and in April 24 mention is made of MM. Derenbourg's transcriptions, translations, and explanations of sixty-one Ph\u0153nician inscriptions copied by Prof. Sayce from the graffiti in the temple of Seti I. at Abydos.\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique (No. 2, 1835) M. Masp\u00e9ro gives an Arab version of the story of Rhampsinitus, which, curious\nto relate, has returned to Egypt quite recently by means of the same writer's \"Contes populaires de l'Egypte ancienne,\" given by him to a schoolmaster at Erment. He, in his turn, passed the stories on to the people of Erment and Gournah, whence they travelled to Luxor and Neggadeh, and probably still further.\n\nObituary notices of the late Dr. Birch are to be found in all the well-known papers and magazines, and expressions of regret at his loss are received from Egyptologists in all parts of the globe. A collection of the several Biographies, together with a Bibliography of his literary works, has been published by his son, Mr. Walter De Gray Birch, F.S.A., etc.\n\nA most interesting series of Lectures on the Manners and Customs, Art and Literature, and Religion (with special reference to the burial of the dead), of the Ancient Egyptians, has been given to women in the Egyptian Galleries of the British Museum by Mrs. Tirard (Miss Helen Beloe).\n\nMr. Petrie geographically describes a \"Digger's Life\" in Egypt in the English Illustrated Magazine for March. Believers in Copts will have welcomed the testimony he gives, based on his own experience, to their worth. \"If ever Egypt is to stand alone,\" he says, \"it must be on a Coptic basis. That race\u2014the real Egyptians\u2014who have for twelve hundred years held their own against every persecution and in spite of a domineering fanaticism\u2014has in it more vitality than is dreamt of in England. If no foreign influence is brought to bear against them, and real liberty be established in the country, the Copts will, by their force of character and intellect, rise to the top. They have, in spite of everything, been all through at the top of the civil service, with nothing but the foreign military caste and its dependents above them, simply by brain power.\" We have thought it worth while to give this extract, coming as it does from one who for some years past has lived for\nthe most part not among the Europeans, but among the Egyptians in Egypt.\n\nWhile on the subject of Copts, we may mention that the *Athen\u00e6um* of August 15 has a review of Butler's \"Ancient Coptic Churches of Egypt\"; and that in the \"Proceedings\" of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, May 4th, is a paper by Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge, \"On a Coptic Version of an Encomium on Elijah the Tishbite, attributed to St. John Chrysostom.\"\n\nSome pamphlets on the subject of the Coptic Church have been published by the Association for the Furtherance of Christianity in Egypt. The endeavour of this Association is to hold out the hand of sympathy towards a Church, to which, in due time, it may be able, without destroying its nationality, to impart some more accurate knowledge of the truth, and some fresh vigour and spiritual life. To this end classes for young men have been established at Cairo, with very fair success.\n\nAmong books recently published on Egypt, we note the following:\n\nE. Naville, \"Das \u00e4gyptische Todtenbuch der XVIII. bis XX. Dynastie; H. de Vaujany, Description de l'Egypte (deuxi\u00e8me partie), Alexandrie et la Basse-Egypte; H. Brugsch and J.

A transliteration committee, consisting of four Japanese and two Europeans, was appointed, and the compilation of a vocabulary and test-periodical were taken into consideration. The Government will, it is believed, give the movement its support. Supporters of the innovation argue that the phonetic construction of the Japanese language is so far favourable to its introduction that it admits of the use of twenty-two Roman letters, without recourse being had to any diacritical marks, except the long sign over certain vowels.\n\nAmong new books relating to the country are: Isabella Bird, \u201cUnbeaten Tracks in Japan\u201d; Lord Ronald Gower, \u201cNotes of a Tour from Brindisi to Yokohama\u201d; Percy Thorpe, \u201cThe History of Japan\u201d; J. Morris, \u201cKotaka, a Japanese Tale\u201d; Judith Gautier, \u201cPo\u00e8mes de la Libellule, traduits du Japonais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la version litt\u00e9rale de M.

Chamberlain, \u201cSimplified Grammar of the Japanese Language\u201d; P. Noack, \u201cLehrbuch der Japanischen Sprache.\u201d\n\nAnnales de l\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient.\u2014In the number for April we have the commencement of an interesting paper by P. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9, entitled \u201cLes Russes sur le Chemin de l\u2019Inde\u201d; a short notice of the Mahdi; M. J. Raubert\u2019s views on the French protectorate of Obock, with suggestions as to the occupation of Zulah (the ancient Adulis) and Shaikh Sa\u00efd, near Cape\nBab-el-Mandeb; and M. Lanchier's article (continued) on \"Les Richesse Africaines et les moyens de les acqu\u00e9rir,\" dealing mainly with Dahomey, Porto Novo, the Topos coast, and Lagos. In the number for May M. P. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9 finishes with \"Les Russes sur le Chemin de l'Inde\"; M. Pierre Christi discusses the \"Commerce de Bangkok en 1883\"; and M. Lanchier continues his remarks on \"Les Richesses Africaines,\" etc., applying them to Benin, the Niger, Benou\u00e9, Bonny, and Old Calabar. There is also a short review of \"Les Richesses du Tongking, les produits \u00e0 y importer et l'exploitation Fran\u00e7aises. Guide administratif, commerciale, industriel, agricole,\" etc. The number for June has an interesting article by M. Mercier entitled \"Les voies commerciales avant Gama,\" being a comprehensive survey of the chief commercial highways between the West and the extreme East prior to the doubling of the Cape of Good Hope by Vasco de Gama. The Wealth of Africa is illustrated this time by \"Le Rio del Rey, le Rumby, la voie Ambas et le massif du Cameroon; la rivi\u00e8re Bimbio et les habitans de William-town.\" There are also notes or communications on the coast of Guinea, the Congo, Zanzibar, Madagascar, and Sumatra. In July there is the introduction to a paper on \"L'Art dramatique en Extr\u00eame Orient,\" by Count Meyners d'Estrey; the continuation of the articles on the \"Richesses d'Afrique,\" in reference to the Cameroons; articles on Arab education in Tunis, and the account of a voyage to the Somali country. The four succeeding numbers are greatly taken up with the already broached subjects of dramatic art in the far East, and the riches of Africa, but there is in the September number a notice of Dr. Duka's \"Life of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s,\" which M. L\u00e9on Feer pronounces \"un volume tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, rempli de faits, de documents . . .\" and a sketch of British Australia, with a certain amount of useful statistics. In December the subjects are the Portuguese in Morocco (a continuation); M. De Brazza's Mission, a short but suggestive\narticle on the French Congo; the Commerce of Tonking, and the Exterior Commerce of Independent Burma. The last attempts to show roughly the paying results of our annexation, and arrives at the conclusion that an intelligent and honest government could obtain from the country \"d'immenses richesses.\"\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014In its issue of 1st of August, 1885, the Academy states that a copy of the inscription which gives additional value to the cast of the Hittite Lion deposited in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum, would be found in the new edition of Dr. Wright's \"Empire of the Hittites.\"\n\nThe Revue Arch\u00e9ologique for Mai\u2014Juin contains an interesting article by Prof. G. Perrot, entitled \"The Monument of Eflat\u00fbn and a Hittite Inscription,\" in which an account and drawing are given of the curious monument of Eflat\u00fbn near Beg Shehr, in Asia Minor, first noticed by Hamilton, as well as of a new Hittite inscription discovered by Professor Sokslouski on a road leading from Ikonium. The copy of the inscription was found too imperfect to show more than its Hittite origin.\n\nUnder the title of \"L'Arabie avant Mahomet, d'apr\u00e8s les Inscriptions,\" M. Philippe Berger has published a valuable lecture on the important inscriptions recently discovered in Central Arabia, and the inferences that may be drawn from them. From a summary in the Academy of 15th August we learn that shortly after Mr. Doughty's journey to Meda\u00efn Saleh, and discovery there of Nabath\u00e6an tombs and inscriptions, Huber, the French traveller, found his way to the ruins of Teima, north-east of that place, and came upon \"an important st\u00e8le, containing two bas-reliefs in the Assyrian style, and an inscription of twenty-four lines in Aramaic characters, which are as early, at least, as the fourth century B.C.\" He had proposed to repeat the ex-\nploration in company with Prof. Euting, but was prevented by the hand of the assassin.\\footnote{See note at page LXVI.} Fortunately, squeezes and copies had been already taken of the inscription, and the stone itself is now safe in the Louvre. In the dedication engraved on it to the gods of Teima, attention is called to the Egyptian character of the second name in the description of the dedicator, \"the priest Tselem-Sazab, son of Petosiris.\" Like other inscriptions copied by Messrs. Huber and Euting in the neighbourhood, this may be cited as evidence of the former occupation of Central Arabia by Nabath\u00e6an tribes. Since the Nabath\u00e6ans belonged to the Aramaic branch of the Semitic race\u2014while inscriptions make it plain that Sab\u00e6an (or Himyaritic) influence and culture extended northward as far as their southern frontier\u2014little room is left, as M. Berger remarks, for \"the Arabia of the Koreishites and of Mohammed.\" He concludes that it must have originally been \"a dialect extremely restricted in area, the language, in fact, of a small tribe, which, owing to local circumstances, reached, at a particular moment, an extraordinary degree of perfection.\" The Academy considers that the names of the deities mentioned on the newly-found monuments will throw much light on Semitic mythology, and quotes M. Clermont-Ganneau's indication that Tselem is a god to whom there is a reference in Amos v. 26. The various interpretations put upon the Scriptural passage somewhat perplex the investigation, and although the Revised Version follows the Old in making Moloch and Chiun proper names, Dr. Pusey holds the true reading to be, in two distinct clauses, \"the tabernacle of your king (Ar. \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0643\u0645), and of Chiun your images.\" In addition to an article on the subject in the Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale, M. E. Renan has addressed the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, on the 26th June and 3rd July, on the Aram\u00e6an st\u00e8le of Teima, which he considers second in interest to the st\u00e8le\nof the Moabite King M\u00e9sa. The *Deutsche Literaturzeitung* of the 18th July has also a notice of these Nabath\u00e6an Inscriptions, and of Mr. Doughty's \"Documents Epigraphiques.\"\n\nIn the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 26th September mention is made of Prof. Euting's account of ninety-eight inscriptions collected during his travels in Syria and Arabia in the years 1883-4, which appeared in the last number of the *Sitzungsberichte* of the Academy of Berlin, under the title of \"Epigraphische Miscellen.\" Amongst the collections are an old Hebrew and one old Aramaic inscription; two Ph\u0153nician, two Egyptian-Aramaic on papyrus, forty Palmyrene, twenty-two Hebrew and Gr\u00e6co-Hebrew, and twenty-eight Greek inscriptions. Some have already been published by M. Clermont-Ganneau and by others. The Gr\u00e6co-Hebrew inscriptions are of importance for the history of early Christianity. In the *Oesterreichische Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient* for August there is also a notice of Professor Euting's paper by Dr. G. H. M\u00fcller, of Vienna, who compliments him on the admirable way in which he has prepared these inscriptions for publication.\n\nBesides M. Renan's paper above named, the *Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale*, Tome i. No. 2, contains the following articles on epigraphy: J. and H. Derembourg, \"Nouvelles \u00e9tudes sur l'epigraphie du Yemen\"; J. Oppert, \"L'Inscription du Saros\"; Ledrain, \"Quelques inscriptions palmyr\u00e9nienes.\"\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the *Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions* of 29th May M. Oppert exhibited photographs of two fragments of trilingual inscriptions found at Rh\u00e9, the ancient Rhages, near Teheran. The inscriptions are of King Artaxerxes Mnemon. Their value is in the evidence they give that the Ach\u00e6menian kings sometimes resided in the region where the Median language was spoken, a circumstance to be inferred from the use made of that tongue in their inscriptions.\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the *Acad\u00e9mie* of the 24th July it was announced that important Coptic st\u00e8les had been found at\nErment and Assu\u00e1n in Upper Egypt, the date of which could be determined by the inscriptions.\n\nThe Phoenician inscription referred to in the table of contents, vol. xxxix. part 2 of the Z.D.M.G. relates to part of an inscription on a marble fragment of an altar at Tyre. The letters, about one hundred in number, are very elegantly formed. Dr. Schroeder fixes the date at about the fourth or fifth century.\n\nThe Academy of 6th June states that Prof. D. H. M\u00fcller has lately published and translated four new inscriptions found at Palmyra, by Dr. Samson. One of them is attached to the figure of a man, above whom two palm branches are carved, and two others are engraved, each between the busts of a man and a woman. The last of these records the name of Rubat, the son of Beb\u2019-agab, a name already met with in Palmyrene texts, not unlike that of the Biblical Jacob.\n\nAccording to the Academy of the 29th August the long inscription of Nissanka Malla (12th century), discovered at Anuradhapura in Ceylon, would be published in the Journal of the P\u00e2li Text Society.\n\nIn No. iii. of the Revue d\u2019Assyriologie et d\u2019Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale for 1885 is a paper by the Derembourgs on the Phoenician Inscriptions of the Temple of Seti in Abydos; one by Professor Oppert on a Babylonian Inscription of Antiochus Setu; and one by M. Lethain on certain Semitic Inscriptions. The second is noteworthy from its illustration of the light thrown by Cuneiform on other than local history.\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions of the 11th September M. Bergaigne communicated a letter received from M. Aymonier reporting that he had obtained some new inscriptions, some of which were Sanskrit (one Buddhist). He was to continue his studies on the Tcham race, whose rule preceded that of the Annamites on a part of the west coast of Indo-China.\n\nIn the Revue Critique of 22nd June M. Clermont-Ganneau\nhas a note on \"Une Nouvelle Inscription relative \u00e0 Baal Marcod,\" from the neighbourhood of Deir-el-Kal'a, near Beyrouth. In the number of 6th July he writes on \"Un nouveau titulus fun\u00e9raire de Jopp\u00e9,\" bearing a Greek inscription, recently discovered, and probably coming from the ancient Jewish burial-ground there, the position of which he determined some years ago.\n\nFrom the Athen\u00e6um of the 29th August we learn that Professor Derenbourg's first fasciculus of the Himyaritic Inscriptions\u2014forming part of the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum, edited by the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres\u2014was then in the printer's hands; and, from the Academy of the 19th September, that the first chapter of the Aramaean Section (Fasc. iii.) was in slips, the second chapter, containing Aramaean Inscriptions, being ready for the press.\n\nM. S\u00e9nart's pamphlet, entitled \"L'Epigraphie et l'Histoire Linguistique de l'Inde,\" is an argument in favour of a more direct and serious employment of documents \u00e9pigraphiques to obtain further light on the history of Indian language and Indian literature. He gives his reasons for this new resort to Epigraphy, and formulates his conclusions under four heads; but the pamphlet should be studied as a whole, and is recommended for perusal accordingly. It consists of little more than twenty pages, and the writer's name is a sufficient guarantee that it is readable.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014Besides the three short papers by Mr. Charles J. Rodgers, Principal of the Normal College at Amritsir, which appears among the contents of part i., there is in part ii., Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, an article relating to symbols or devices on the gold coins of the Guptas, which will interest the numismatist. It is by Mr. W. Theobald, M.N.S.L., who aims at giving a new and more correct interpretation of Gupta symbols, such as the fillet, cornucopia, and footstool. Another article by Mr. Rodgers\non the square silver coins of the Sultans of Kashmir, is of historical as well as numismatic interest. There is also in the same issue a paper by Major Raverty on the Kings of the Safavian Dynasty of Nimroz or Sigistan, referring to a previously published note by Mr. Rodgers on some Kandahar coins.\n\nThe Academy of June 6th, 1885, reviews Mr. Stanley Lane Poole's \"Coins and Medals; their place in History and Art;\" and the Athen\u00e6um of the 8th August the same author's \"Coins of the Turks in the British Museum.\" In the eight volumes which embrace the whole collection, the respective coins are thus classified:\n\nVol. i. (1875), the initial coinage of the Muhammadans, i.e. for a period comprising nearly the whole numismatic history of the Khil\u00e1fat till its overthrow by Hul\u00e1ku on the capture of Baghdad. Vol. ii. (1876), the Amawees of Spain and succeeding dynasties of that country; with the small dynasties in North Africa, the Sam\u00e1nis of Samarkand, Nish\u00e1pur, Bokh\u00e1ra, the Ghaznavis, Khw\u00e1rizmis, and Buweyhis. Vol. iii. (1877), the three great T\u00fcrkman houses, Seljuk, Urtuk and Bani Z\u00e1ngi, with those of smaller dynasties and individual rulers. Vol. iv. (1879), the coinage of Egypt under the Fatimites, Aiy\u00fabis, and Mamluk Sultans. Vol. v. (1880), the Moors of Africa and Spain, and Kings and Im\u00e1ms of the Yemen. Vol. vi. (1881), the various Mughal dynasties. Vol. vii. (1882), Bukh\u00e1ra (Transoxiana) from Tim\u00far onward. Vol. viii. (and last, 1885), the Othmanli or Turkish Sult\u00e1ns to the present times, including the Am\u00edrs who ruled in Asia Minor after the fall of the Seljukis of R\u00fam.\n\nDr. Bushell's pamphlet on \"Ancient Roman Coins from Shansi\" is a republication from the Journal of the Peking Oriental Society. It gives an interesting account of a curious find of sixteen Roman copper coins, among which are examples of the money of twelve Emperors, ranging from Tiberius to Aurelian. A little copper coin of Henry III. of France had\nmade its way into the same collection. They are said to come from Ling-shih-hsien, a small district town in the interior of Shansi, on the left bank of the F\u00e9u, an affluent of the Yellow River, and about 20 miles north of Ho-chou. Dr. Bushell can venture no guess as to how they got to the locality, if indeed they were dug up there; their appearance led to the inference that they had been buried. He adds that \"the latest embassy from Ta-ch'in mentioned in the Chinese records arrived with 30,000 sheets of paper in A.D. 284, fourteen years after the death of Aurelian, the last Emperor represented\" in the series.\n\nFor information on Mr. Poole's \"Fasti Arabici,\" or recent works on Muhammadan and other Oriental coins, the space already taken up in the Annual Report suggests reference to the publications of the Numismatic Society.\n\nEnglish and Vernacular Literature of India.\u2014Calcutta Review.\u2014Civilians, soldiers and others whose better years have been passed in India, but who, after return home, have held little communication with residents in that vast Empire for a period of ten to twenty years, should experience a sensation of profound astonishment in perusing the numbers of the Calcutta Review as now issued. Not the least instructive portion of the contents of that well-maintained publication is that which affords insight into the progress of the native intellect. That natives of India should have learnt to write English as they do in the pages of the several Reviews, Proceedings of Societies, and periodicals which are received in England from the Presidencies and larger towns, is in itself surprising; but the fact may be in a great measure accounted for by the perseverance and almost thoroughness with which they engage in their earlier studies. Unlike the ordinary English student, who is called away from his books by cricket and boat-racing, tennis and other attractions or social demands, he spends his leisure\nhours in self-imposed scholastic tasks, and in many cases becomes imperceptibly a literary man, endowed with a literary style picked up from the writers of the days whose merits he has heard extolled by his English Professors or companions. In any case the progress to be recorded in this respect for the last few years is immense. And for the other sex, the names of some of the lady-writers and the subjects they have taken up\u2014together with the success they appear to have achieved\u2014all this is \"passing strange\" and, let us hope, hopeful. Nor is it the least agreeable sign of the times that the ladies write in their own vernacular.\n\nSince our last Annual Report five more numbers of the Calcutta Review have been received, and are of sufficiently varied character to attract the general reader. \"Something about Snakes\" and other cognate matters, which is the opening paper in No. clx., is a \"further contribution\" to what Dr. Vincent Richards calls the \"literature of snake-poisoning,\" which may be read with interest and advantage by other than residents in India. \"Detective Experiences in Bengal,\" by Mr. H. Giles, is certainly, as the author himself apprehends, too sensational a title for a sober, thoughtful article on a proposed Detective Scheme for India; but after all, it is only the title. The \"House of Lords\" suggests the admission of distinguished Indian and Colonial Officials as members of the Upper House, India and the Colonies being now represented there by a few peers who have filled the office of Viceroy or Governor-General. Mr. Sinnett considers the \"Theosophical Movement\" in India to merit attention, not only in its aspect as a system of philosophical inquiry, but because its philosophical are \"intimately blended with its social and philanthropic aspects.\" A writer who signs himself \"Covenanted\" has to deal with a delicate subject in discussing \"the Moral Progress of Indian Administration,\" but acquits himself of his task with praiseworthy earnestness, and winds up his observations in a loyal\nand becoming spirit. Col. Tyrrell's review of Sir Lambert Playfair's \"Scourge of Christendom\" is the substance of the article headed \"Turks in Algiers.\" In \"Nadir Shah,\" by Lieut. Wheeler, the great Eastern Conqueror is made doubly conspicuous by the light character of the preceding paper, under the signature of Esm\u00e9. \"Economic Reform in Rural India\" is a continuation of Mr. Harington's previous chapters on matters deserving serious attention; and the Editor's Notes on the Quarter, a Summary of Annual Reports, and Critical Notices complete the issue for April, 1885.\u2014No. clxi., for July, contains \"The Pre-Historic Man of Caves and Lake Dwellings,\" by a practised writer, Mr. Rehatsek: Mr. Mackenzie Cameron's \"Business Journeys through Java,\" with a far from inviting description of Batavia: Mr. R. N. Cust's \"International Congresses of Science,\" in which the author gives an instructive account of the Oriental Congress at Berlin and Geographical Congress at Venice in 1881, and the Oriental Congress at Leyden, in Holland, in 1883: Mr. H. Giles's \"Poisoners and their Craft\": Mr. Keene's graphic \"Indian Village\": a \"Recollection of a Battle-Field,\" by M.P.: Mr. Bishop's \"Stray Leaves from an Asylum\": Mr. Madge's \"Moral Aspect of Trial by Peer:\" Mr. Lee-Warner's \"Two Eastern Empires\u2014a Contrast\": Esm\u00e9's \"Few Words about Camping\": Mr. Haslett's \"Historic Notes,\" and verses under \"Primula Vulgaris.\"\u2014No. clxii. for October is opened by Mr. Keene with \"the British Conquest of Hindostan.\" This is followed by Mr. Molesworth's paper comprising many men's ideas on a large question, called \"Imperialism for India.\" His own view is that India should be \"knit with our Colonies into one mighty federation\u2014homogeneous in character, unselfish in aims, and united in policy.\" Mr. Turton Smith contributes \"Control over Criminals\"; Mr. Kennedy, \"Punjab Ploughing\"; Lieut. Wheeler, \"Timur\"; Mr. Cust, \"The Tour of a Cook Party in Egypt and Palestine\"; and Mr. Barada\nMitra, \"English Influence on Bengali Literature,\" in which the author unconsciously illustrates the effect of reading English books and periodicals upon the style of an intelligent Indian. Want of space only forbids the transcription of his last two pages. Mr. Arthur Harrington continues his \"Economic Reform in Rural India\"; and Esm\u00e9 writes a lively sketch, entitled \"Grit in the Wheels\": Mr. Cheetham, in \"The Congo Free State,\" repeats much of an old and well-worn story. Two papers in verse complete all but the regular monthly notices.\u2014No. clxiii. begins well the New Year with an interesting paper by Mr. Rehatsek on \"Missionaries at the Moghul Court, in Southern and in Portuguese India, during and after the Reign of Akbar.\" The other articles are, \"Burma before the Ultimatum,\" by Major Edmund Browne; \"Buddha as a Man,\" by Ram Chandra Bose; \"A Dance of Death,\" by J. H.; the \"Trial of Maha Raja Nanda Kumar,\" by Mr. Beveridge; and \"Egypt,\" by Mr. Cust. In the quality rather than quantity of its contributions, the number is, perhaps exceptionally, substantial.\u2014In No. clxiv. for April this year, is Mr. Barrow's \"Mofussil Municipalities in Lower Bengal\": Mr. Pringle Kennedy's \"Two Empires,\" an opposite view, or \"another side of the shield,\" to Mr. Lee-Warner's article already mentioned: Mr. Bate's \"Sketches of European Hajjis,\" a title which tells its own tale: Mr. Tute's \"on the Treatment of Ordinary Crime\": Mr. Beveridge's continuation of the \"Trial of Nanda Kumar\": Mr. Gough's \"Lotze's Philosophy\"; and Mr. Kipling's blank verse called \"The Seven Nights of Creation.\" As regards Mr. Beveridge's two articles, they form in themselves a volume of 230 odd pages; and are written with the object of proving Kumar's execution \"a judicial murder.\"\n\nThe following is a resum\u00e9 of most of the books noticed, with here and there a reviewer's comment:\n\nJanuary, 1885.\u2014English.\u2014Dr. Hunter's \"Short History\nof the Indian People,\u201d sixth edition, \u201cadmirable little publication.\u201d Major-General H.

Gribble's \"Outlines of Medical Jurisprudence for Indian Civil Courts\"; Jolly's \"Outlines of a History of Hindu Law of Partition, Inheritance, and Adoption; and Whitworth's \"Anglo-Indian Dictionary,\" all get a word of commendation. The second vol. of \"Haidarabad under Sir Salar Jung,\" by Maulavi Chiragh Ali, is less pleasantly treated; but Sir H. Maine's \"Popular Government,\" and \"The Life of William Carey,\" together with Col. Dowden's \"Pamphlet on the Rupee,\" meet with approval, and under the head of \"New India\" are classed \"Reforms and Progress in India,\" by an Optimist, and Mr. H. J. S.

A. v. No\u00e9r's Kaiser Akbar.\u2014The second volume of the Kaisar Akbar of H.H. the late Count F. A. v. No\u00e9r has appeared, and has been reviewed by Georg Weber in the Allgemeine Zeitung (Augsberger). It will be remembered that a short sketch of the distinguished writer's career is contained in the Obituary Notices of this Journal for May,\n1882, and that the first two parts, forming the first volume of his work, were published in 1880 and 1881. These were entitled, \"An Essay on Indian History in the 16th Century,\" whereas the present volume is issued as a posthumous collection of papers arranged by Dr. Gunter v. Buchwald. The reviewer regards the whole as a \"noteworthy literary production, both in respect of its contents, which bring to light the reign and personality of a remarkable sovereign, about whom we, until now, have possessed very defective information, and on account of the illustrious author who, out of a noble thirst for knowledge, travelled three times in the East, and with great pains and by dint of zealous study at native sources, collected and put together the data for a historical monograph.\" Count No\u00ebr looked upon Akbar as the man for the future, and remarked that he had striven to attain, and partly attained to aims \"which for the much-extolled 19th century yet lie in the dim distance.\" In reviewing his conduct towards the Muhammadan clergy (Ulema), he particularly noticed the way in which he carried on war against this spiritual hierarchy, \"which recalls to mind the measures taken by the Bourbons against the order of the Jesuits in the 'seventies' of the 18th century.\" In conclusion, the reviewer refers to the work as one \"in which the Muhammadan East, and Indian Middle Ages are illuminated by many a new, if faint, gleam of light. It is elegantly got up as regards style and typography, and contains two steel engravings\u2014the portrait and the mausoleum respectively of the great reforming sovereign of the East.\" The first volume is dedicated to \"Carmen, Countess v. No\u00ebr,\" the widow, who has conscientiously fulfilled the task bequeathed to her of bringing the work to completion; and on the fly-leaf of the second volume are the words, \"To the memory of His Highness Prince Frederick August of Schleswig-Holstein, Count v. No\u00ebr.\"\n\nMiscellaneous.\u2014Royal Prizes for Asiatic Research.\u2014His\nMajesty King Oscar II. of Sweden and Norway has been pleased to found two prizes for the best Essays on two Oriental subjects. They are as follows:\u2014\n\nA large gold medal in value about 1000 Swedish crowns, and a sum of money amounting to 1250 Swedish crowns, to the author of the best\n\n1. History of the Semitic languages;\n2. Description of Arab Culture before the time of Muhammad.\n\nA Committee has been formed to carry out the details. Many conditions are attached, of which competitors should inform themselves before entering for competition. Papers should be sent in before the end of the year 1888.\n\nRussian Literature.\u2014Nine volumes in Russian, chiefly on the derivations and affinity of words in various tongues, by Platon Lukachevitch, have been presented to the Royal Asiatic Society by the author. Of these the titles of two may be mentioned, i.e.:\u2014\n\n1. An Explanation of Assyrian Names. Kiev, 1868.\n2. On the Origin of the Hebrew Language. Kiev, 1882.\n\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.\u2014Since the appearance of vol. xvii. of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (the last noticed in this Journal), three volumes have been issued. Among the principal articles in these, treating exclusively of Asiatic subjects, are the following:\u2014\n\nIn vol. xviii. Oxus, by General Walker, R.E.; Pahlavi, by Professor N\u00f6ldeke; Palestine, by Professor Socin; Palmyra, by Professor Robertson Smith; Parsis, by Dr. F\u00fchrer; Peking, by Professor Douglas; Persia, Ancient and Modern, by no less than five writers; Philippine Islands, by Mr. H. A. Webster; Ph\u0153nicia, by Professors Socin and Gutschmid; and Phrygia, by Mr. W. M. Ramsay. In vol. xx. General MacLagan\u2019s Punj\u00e1b and Mr. Ronson\u2019s Rajputana should\nbe mentioned. Professor Robertson Smith lends his support to the theory that the Caphtu of Scripture is to be identified with the Island of Crete.\n\n**British and Foreign Bible Society.**\u2014The Honorary Secretary has communicated, as usual, a statement of the progress made by the British and Foreign Bible Society in translation work in the different languages of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and America. With the object for which these translations are made this Society has no relation, but the annual outturn of work done supplies a startling proof of the progress of Linguistic knowledge. The very names of some of the languages specified were totally unknown, and would have remained so, but for these translations; and it may be noted that the preparation of Grammars and Dictionaries must precede translation; the work, therefore, is of solid and abiding nature.\n\n**Amharic.**\u2014Mr. Flad completed the new edition of the Bible on May 15. As the work proceeded he found that more emendations were necessary than were at first contemplated. He received valuable assistance from Mr. Argawi, who left for Abyssinia in October, 1885. About a thousand grammatical improvements were made in the Prophetical Books and a great many in the New Testament.\n\n**Amoy-Colloquial.**\u2014On the return of Dr. Maxwell to England the Rev. T. Barclay, M.A., of Formosa, was chosen to succeed him as Secretary to the New Testament Revision Committee. A good beginning has been made. Dr. Kip has revised the Epistles to the Thessalonians, and these have been printed at the mission press, and are now in the hands of the missionaries for final revision. Dr. Talmage has made steady progress with the Epistle to the Galatians, and Mr. Sadler is well advanced with the Acts of the Apostles.\n\n**Api.**\u2014The Rev. Dr. Steel, of Sydney, reports that the Society's Auxiliary is printing a version of one Gospel in the language of the island of Api in the New Hebrides.\nArabic.\u2014Dr. Van Dyck has completed his re-examination of his version of the Bible, and all mistakes that have been discovered are being corrected, and all defective plates are being remade or amended. The New Testament is being brought out in two new sizes, and the books, which are handy and attractive, are expected to be very popular. A new set of stereotype plates, for Portions, are being prepared to supersede the Society\u2019s old plates. These new editions are being prepared at Beyrout under the joint superintendence of the Rev. Dr. Isaac Bliss, of Constantinople, and the Rev. R. H. Weakley, of Alexandria, the Agents of the American, and the British and Foreign, Bible Societies.\n\nArarat-Armenian.\u2014The Society\u2019s Bible, published at Constantinople in 1883, has been undergoing a careful examination by the Rev. A. Amirkhaniantz during the last two years. A complete set of marginal references has been prepared, taken chiefly from Dr. Scrivener\u2019s Cambridge Bible. Certain words in the text are to be transposed, a few words omitted have to be supplied, some obsolete words have to be replaced by others in general use, and faults of punctuation have to be rectified. Mr. Amirkhaniantz will also prepare chapter headings condensed from those in the English Authorized Version.\n\nBeaver.\u2014At the request of the Rt. Rev. Dr. Richard Young, Bishop of Athabasca, the Committee have printed an edition of 500 copies of the Gospel of St. Mark in Roman character. The translation was made and edited by the Rev. A. C. Garrioch, of the Church Missionary Society. The version is the first book that has been printed in the language of the Beaver Indians, with the exception of a small and imperfect primer.\n\nCanton Colloquial (for the blind).\u2014The Committee, at the request of Mr. Samuel Dyer, the Society\u2019s Agent at Shanghai, have agreed to publish the Gospel of St. Luke in the Roman character. The version has been prepared by the Rev. F. Hartmann, of the Foundling Hospital, Hong Kong.\nChinese (Easy Wenli).\u2014At the request of the Committee of the Amoy Auxiliary Bible Society, the Committee have given permission to the Society's Agents in China to purchase and circulate copies of the version of the New Testament made by the Rev. Griffith John in a style more simple than that of the Delegates' version. The version was brought out by the National Bible Society of Scotland.\n\nFanti (Ashanti).\u2014At the request of the Rev. W. M. Cannell, of the Cape Coast Wesleyan Mission, supported by the Rev. M. C. Osborn, the Committee have undertaken to publish an edition of 4000 copies of the Four Gospels. The version was made by a Fanti minister, named Parker, of the Wesleyan Church, whose father was a fetish priest. The translation was made from the English and compared with the Otji. It was afterwards carefully revised by a Committee of ministers, and finally passed by the Annual District Meeting of all the Wesleyan ministers. The version is intended for the Wesleyan Mission, which occupies nearly the whole of the Gold Coast for a distance of 300 miles, and inland for about 150 miles. They have 267 chapels and preaching stations, 495 agents, 5988 members, and 23,660 attending on public worship. The work is progressing slowly in the press, as the proofs have to be sent out to Cape Coast.\n\nFuh-chow Colloquial (Roman character).\u2014The Gospel of St. John, prepared for the press and edited by the Rev. R. W. Stewart, of the Church Missionary Society, has been well received. A large portion of the New Testament is now ready for the press.\n\nGujarati.\u2014The Translation Sub-Committee held two meetings during the year, one at Surat and the other at Ahmedabad. The meetings lasted nineteen days, during which they were engaged in revision work.\n\nHainan.\u2014The version of the Gospel of St. Matthew, which the Committee authorized Mr. Jeremiassen to make for the aborigines of Hainan, who do not understand Chinese, has\nbeen completed, and the Committee have authorized the publication of a tentative edition of 500 copies.\n\n**Hakka Colloquial.**\u2014At the request of the Rev. J. B. Ost, communicated by Mr. Samuel Dyer, the Society's Agent at Shanghai, the Committee have sanctioned the publication of the Old Testament, in portions, as the New Testament has already been published. The Book of Genesis is now passing through the press.\n\n**Harari.**\u2014A version of the Gospel of St. Matthew has been prepared, at the suggestion of Prof. Reinisch, of Vienna, by Hajlu, a Galla freedman from Harar. Hajlu was trained by the Swedish missionaries at Massowah, and he afterwards travelled with Prof. Reinisch in Africa as his servant. The Committee have agreed to purchase the version on the approval of Prof. Reinisch, to whom they already owe two new versions, the Bogos and the Falasha-Kara.\n\n**Hindi.**\u2014The New Testament Translation Committee, with the Rev. J. F. Holcomb as their secretary, have held six meetings since September, 1883, and have translated and revised the Gospels of St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, and part of St. John. The translators have followed the text that underlies the Revised English version.\n\n**Hindustani.**\u2014The Rev. M. G. Goldsmith, of the C.M.S., has carried through the press Genesis and Exodus up to chapter xx. He is now engaged in a revision of the Gospel of St. Luke. The Gospel of St. Mark has been submitted to the revisers, and Mr. Goldsmith awaits their judgment before proceeding further.\n\n**Igbara.**\u2014The Ven. Archdeacon Johnson, C.M.S., the translator of the Nup\u00e9 Gospels, reports that the whole of the New Testament has been translated, and awaits revision.\n\n**Japanese.**\u2014The Rev. P. K. Fyson, of the Church Missionary Society, reports some progress with the translation of the Old Testament. The books of Leviticus, Numbers,\nDeuteronomy, and Daniel, have been translated. He is beginning the translation of Isaiah, but he fears the Psalms may not be ready for publication this year.\n\nJavanese.\u2014Mr. Jansz, having completed, by the help of native scholars at Surakata, his version of St. Matthew, is now at Depok carrying the portion through the press. The publication has been much delayed by the slowness of the printer.\n\nKabyle.\u2014The Gospel of St. John, translated by the Arab who assisted P\u00e8re Olivier in the preparation of his Kabyle-French dictionary, has been thoroughly revised by Dr. Sauerwein, who edited the portion. The little book is received with considerable favour among the Kabyle.\n\nKafir (alias Xosa).\u2014The Revision Committee have completed their labours on the Old Testament, and are now revising the New. The work is drawing to a close, and has been heartily approved of by the representatives of all the missionary bodies, including the Wesleyan. The Rev. A. Krapf has been appointed by the Revision Board to proceed to England to carry the version through the press.\n\nKalmuk (or Western Mongolian).\u2014This language is closely related to the Buriat, in which we possess Swan and Stallybrass's translation of the whole Bible. During the work-period of the first Russian Bible Society, as early as 1815, a translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew was printed in St. Petersburg by the British and Foreign Bible Society. St. John's Gospel was afterwards completed by the same translator, Dr. Schmidt, of the Sarepta (Moravian) Society. Subsequently the whole New Testament was said to have been completed, but it was never printed. The translation of the New Testament at present going forward, and of which four Gospels are now in the press, has been taken up by Professor Pozdnejeff, with the assistance of the Archimandrite Smirnoff in Astrakhan. The original number of the edition was to comprise 2000 copies, but at Professor Pozdnejeff's request\nthe number was enlarged to 4000, with a subsidiary edition of 1000 copies of each of the four Gospels. This was founded on statistics supplied by the Professor, according to which the number of Kalmuks in European Russia should be, as estimated in 1869, 119,866; in Asiatic Russia, 40,000; while in China there are said to be 253,400 souls, possessed of a common language, not indeed devoid of dialectal peculiarities, but mutually intelligible, and having a common literature.\n\n*Kaz\u00e1n-Turki.*\u2014In 1884 an edition of 5000 copies of M. Saleman's version of St. Matthew was printed at the Kazan University Press. Saleman's translation of St. Mark, though completed, has not yet been printed. Mr. Nicolson writes: \"The people for whom this translation is being made are the remains of the mighty Tartar kingdom which once had its seat at Kazan, on the Volga. They inhabit the Governments of Kazan, Orenburg, Samara, and Stavropol, and are said to number about 1,000,000 souls.\"\n\n*Kirghiz-Turki.*\u2014A third edition of the New Testament, consisting of 4000 copies, is now being printed at the Kazan University Press, and edited by M. Saleman, of the St. Petersburg University. The first edition, consisting of 5000 copies, was printed at Astrakhan in 1820. The version was an adaptation, by the Rev. Charles Fraser, of the Scottish Mission, of the version made by the Rev. H. Brunton, and printed at Karass. The version was revised by Professor Gottwald, and an edition of 3000 copies was printed at the Kazan University Press for this Society, under the care of M. Saleman in 1880.\n\nThe Rev. W. Nicolson, the Society's Agent at St. Petersburg, says of the people for whom the version is intended: \"The Kirghese hordes\u2014Great, Little, and Middle, as they are called\u2014occupy various regions in Southern Siberia, Central Asia, and west of the Caspian Sea. The numbers of these hordes are variously estimated as high as 2,000,000, and as\nlow as 1,450,000, the lower number being probably the more correct.\"\n\n*Kumuk-Turki.*\u2014The version of St. Matthew, made by Khasan Beg, has been revised by Major Tchekanof, a good linguist, acquainted with Kumuk, and again re-revised by Mr. Amirkhaniantz, who compared it diligently with the Greek. The work being found satisfactory, the Committee have undertaken to print an edition of 500 copies. The proofs are being read by Dr. Sauerwein.\n\nThe only other known book in the language is a small volume of popular tales and songs, edited by Mahmoud Effendi, a mollah of the village Khasav-Turt.\n\nThe Kumuk is spoken by about 70,000 souls, inhabiting the north-west shore of the Caspian Sea, near Petrovsk, and the north-east districts of Daghestan, watered by the Aksai and Sunja Rivers. It is also found on the Terek, a little above Kizliar. Mr. Morrison, the Society's Agent in South Russia, to whom we owe this version, and our information regarding the people, says: \"The Kumuk are a peaceful people, learning to till the soil, and availing themselves of the schools which the Russian Government has placed among them.\"\n\n*Lifu* (Oceania).\u2014The Rev. S. M. Creagh continues to perfect the MS. and the marginal references of the Revised Version of the Bible, which will be ready for the press as soon as a new edition is called for.\n\n*Malagasi.*\u2014The Rev. W. E. Cousins reports the completion, on October 28, 1885, of the first revision of the Bible, begun December 1, 1873. The Revision Committee sat 433 days, and held 771 sittings, chiefly of three hours each. A second revision, for the purpose of harmonizing the different parts of the whole Bible, is now being carried out, and when that is completed Mr. Cousins will return to England, at the request of the Committee, to carry the Revised Version of the Bible through the press.\nMalay.\u2014Dr. Rost, of the Indian Office, has corrected and carried through the press an edition of 5000 copies of the Four Gospels, and the Committee have resolved to publish an edition of 5000 copies of the Books of Genesis, Psalms, and Proverbs under the care of the same editor.\n\nMalayalam.\u2014The Revision Board has been strengthened by the addition of the Rev. Messrs. Matthissen and Walter, of the Basel Mission, and it has been resolved to invite the Right Rev. Mar Athanasius, of the Syrian Church, to co-operate in the revision.\n\nA special united meeting of the Delegates was held at Cochin last September, and it was resolved to revise again the Revised New Testament. Criticism will be invited from all competent judges by the four bodies represented on the Revision Board, and as far as practicable the chief Delegate of each body will collect and send opinions to the Venerable Archdeacon Koshi. It is proposed to go through the Four Gospels and the Acts at the next meeting. To meet a pressing demand the Delegates have agreed to print an interim edition, in large type, of 2500 copies each of the Old and the Revised versions of the New Testament.\n\nMaori.\u2014The printing of the Revised Bible is making slow progress, owing chiefly to the loss of time in sending out proofs to New Zealand.\n\nMarathi.\u2014The Revision Committee, with the Rev. Dr. Mackichan as convener, have completed the Book of Genesis, and are about to undertake the revision of the Epistle to the Ephesians.\n\nMandari.\u2014An edition of 2000 copies of the Acts of the Apostles has been published by the Calcutta Auxiliary Bible Society. The version was made by Mr. Beyer, of the Gosner Mission in Chota-Nagpore.\n\nMurray Island.\u2014The Rev. J. P. Sunderland, of Sydney, reports the publication, by the Auxiliary, of the Gospels of St. Mark and St. John, translated by the Rev. Messrs.\nMacfarlane and Scott. Mr. Sunderland, who carried the version through the press, has sent 1000 copies of the portions to Murray Island.\n\nNegro-English (Negro-Dutch).\u2014At the request of the President of the Moravian Missions in Dutch Guiana the Committee have agreed to print an edition of 3000 copies of the New Testament and Psalms corrected and revised. The edition will be edited by the Rev. Andreas Bau and the Rev. E. Langerfield. The version has already been published by this Society in 1829, 1846, and 1865. There are about 25,000 souls connected with the Moravian Mission, of whom over 8000 are communicants.\n\nNew Guinea (South Cape dialect).\u2014The Rev. J. P. Sunderland, of Sydney, reports the printing, by the Auxiliary, of 500 copies of the Gospel of St. Mark, translated by one of the teachers and revised by the missionaries. Mr. Sunderland carried the version through the press.\n\nNiue, alias Savage Island (Oceania).\u2014The Rev. F. E. Lawes hopes to finish the translation of the Old Testament by the end of the year, and correspondence is in progress as to the publication of an edition.\n\nNup\u00e9 (West Africa).\u2014At the request of the Church Missionary Society the Committee have agreed to publish an edition, of 500 copies each, of Archdeacon Johnson's version of the Four Gospels. When the first Gospel was in type, it was decided that that Gospel should remain in the old orthography, but that the remaining Gospels should be printed in the new orthography. The version is being edited by the Rev. Dr. J. F. Sch\u00f6n, of the Church Missionary Society.\n\nPangasinan (Philippine Islands).\u2014The Committee have agreed to print an edition of 500 copies of the Gospel of St. Luke. The MS. of the version was presented to the Society in 1873 by Se\u00f1or Alonzo, of Seville, a native of the Philippine Islands. Chiefly through the interest taken\nin the version by Mr. T. Worthington, it has been thoroughly revised and rewritten by Se\u00f1or Alonzo, who will carry the edition through the press. The portion is intended for one million of the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands.\n\nPersian.\u2014The Rev. Dr. Bruce, of Julfa, is revising his version of the New Testament, with a view to the permanent fixing of the text. He has completed from the Romans to the Galatians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and he is now finishing Ephesians. Meanwhile an interim edition is being carried through the press at Leipzig by Dr. Sauerwein.\n\nPopo (Ewe, West Africa).\u2014The Committee are now carrying through the press an edition of 500 each of the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark. The translation was made by the Rev. T. J. Marshall, a native minister, and revised by the Translation Committee at Lagos. Mr. Marshall is carrying the portions through the press in accordance with the system that has been adopted for the Yoruba Scriptures.\n\nRarotonga (Oceania).\u2014The Rev. W. Wyatt Gill has completed his revision of the whole Bible at Sydney, and at the request of this Society he is returning to England to carry a stereotyped edition of the revised version through the press.\n\nRift (Shilha) Morocco.\u2014Mr. William Mackintosh is continuing his translation work.\n\nSanguir (Malaysia).\u2014The Rev. Mr. Kelling\u2019s version of the Psalms is now, after final revision, being carried through the press by Mr. Kyftenbeldt.\n\nSantal (India) (in Roman character).\u2014The Translation Committee are making satisfactory progress with the translation of the Gospels in the Roman character. An edition of 2000 copies of the Gospel of St. Luke was ordered last September.\n\nSantal (in Bengali character).\u2014The Committee have sanctioned the publication by the Calcutta Auxiliary of an edition\nof 1000 copies of the Gospel of St. Luke. The portion is intended for those who know the Santal language and only the Bengali character. The Rev. T. Cole, of the Church Missionary Society, editor of the Santal Translation and Revision Committee, will transliterate and edit the portion.\n\nSinhalese.\u2014The Committee have agreed, in response to a resolution of the Kandy Auxiliary, supported by the Colombo Auxiliary, to undertake a revision of the Bible.\n\nThe present Bible, an interim edition, was completed many years ago by the Rev. D. G. Gogerly. The New Testament was revised and accepted by the Society about sixteen years ago. It is now considered desirable to revise the New Testament slightly, and the Old Testament thoroughly. The Rev. S. Coles, of the Church Missionary Society, has undertaken the chief labour of the revision, but he will be assisted by a Committee in Ceylon, appointed by the Auxiliaries of Colombo and Kandy, who will finally revise the work.\n\nSwahili.\u2014The Committee have agreed to print an edition of 500 copies of the Book of Exodus, revised by the Venerable Archdeacon Hodgson. A tentative edition was printed by the Universities' Mission Press at Zanzibar. The editor the new issue will be the Rev. F. A. Wallis, of the Universities' Mission, now in England.\n\nSwahili (E. Africa, in Arabic character).\u2014An edition of 500 copies of the Gospel of St. John, intended for those who know the Swahili language and only the Arabic character, is now passing through the press. The version has been translated by Miss Allen, who is superintending its production.\n\nTelugu.\u2014During the year the Rev. Dr. Hay has revised from the beginning of Exodus to the end of Ruth. Isaiah is now in the course of revision, and it is hoped that it will be completed in time for insertion in the brevier edition at present\nin the press. The Books of Psalms and Proverbs, favourably known in their revised form, will receive a final revision for the same edition.\n\nInterleaved copies of the revised Pentateuch are now in the hands of the Delegates and other scholars, and a similar edition of the books from Joshua to Ruth is soon to be out, and of Isaiah later on. As Dr. Hay proceeds, a limited edition of the remaining books of the Old Testament, with wide margins, will be struck off, so that the Delegates may be provided with fresh matter to work upon.\n\nBoth the Parent Society and the Madras Committee are agreed that Dr. Hay should be left free to proceed with his preliminary revision without distraction from Delegates' meetings, as it is much to be desired that the work begun by Dr. Hay may be completed by him.\n\nThe Revision Committee has been strengthened by the addition of the Rev. J. R. Bacon, of the L.M.S., Cuddapah; the Rev. T. Heelis, of the Nursapur Mission; and Messrs. D. Antam, B.A., Shunmukharam, and C. Venkatachellam. The three latter Christian Hindu scholars have for a long time voluntarily rendered important aid to Dr. Hay.\n\nTranscaucasian Turki.\u2014The version of the Old Testament made by the Rev. A. Amirkhaniantz has been revised by the American missionaries the Rev. J. N. Wright, of Tabriz, and the Rev. B. Labaree, of Urmiah, and all dialectical and orthographical differences between the language as spoken in Northern Persia and other Turki-speaking districts have been satisfactorily adjusted.\n\nThe Committee have sanctioned an octavo edition of the whole Bible, consisting of 2500 Old Testaments; 5000 New Testaments, one-half to be bound up with the Old Testaments, and one-half to be issued separately; 2000 Psalms; 1000 Genesis; 2000 Isaiah; and 1000 each of St. Matthew, St. Luke, and St. John. The edition will be printed at Leipzig. The first proofs will be sent to Mr. Amirkhaniantz, the second\nproofs will be read by Dr. Sauerwein, and the third and final proofs will be read by Mr. Amirkhaniantz.\n\nTukudh (North America).\u2014The Ven. Archdeacon McDonald, having completed his New Testament, is now engaged on a version of the Old Testament. The Indians who speak the language are scattered over 100,000 square miles of a desolate region on the confines of the Arctic Circle. They have all been brought under Christian influence and baptized. Other tribes speak a cognate language, and the version will circulate among them.\n\nTulu (S. India).\u2014The Rev. M. Hartmann has nearly finished his revision of the Four Gospels. A tentative edition of the Gospel of St. Matthew will be issued with a view to obtain suggestions from the Tulu people on points of idiom. The revision of the books from Romans to Revelation was entrusted to Messrs. Ott and Riter, but as they have left the country it has not been ascertained what progress they have made with the work.\n\nTurkish (Osmanli).\u2014The revision of the Bible, in which the Committee united with the American Bible Society, has been brought to a close. The work was carried out by the Rev. Dr. Riggs, and the Rev. Messrs. Herrick and Dwight, aided by Pastor Avedis. The Rev. R. H. Weakley was also consulted. The Revised Version is now in the press and will soon be published.\n\nUrdu (in Arabic character).\u2014The Committee have agreed to print an edition of the large marginal Reference Bible. It will be printed in paragraph form, with a few alternative readings from the English Revisers' Greek Text, and with marginal references selected from Dr. Scrivener's Cambridge Bible. The Rev. Dr. Weitbrecht will edit the edition.\n\nUriya.\u2014The Committee have agreed to bear the expense of an edition of 2500 copies of the Old Testament, which the Rev. Dr. Buckley, of the Baptist Mission at Cuttack, has revised and is now carrying through the press.\nUzbek-Turki.\u2014At the request of the Rev. W. Nicolson, the Society's Agent at St. Petersburg, M. Ostrumoff, a Russian inspector of schools, has undertaken a version of the New Testament. Four Gospels have been completed, and an edition will shortly be published, the proof-sheets passing through the hands of Dr. Radloff and the Rev. A. Amirkhaniantz, of Tiflis. M. Ostrumoff is acquainted with the different Turki dialects of Central Asia, and believes that the Uzbek, which is used by the more settled and civilized portion of the inhabitants, is certain to become the dominant language of Central Asia.\n\nYahgan (Patagonia).\u2014The version of St. John, made by the Rev. Thomas Bridges, has been published. The final proofs were read by Mr. Henry Morris, a member of Committee.\n\nLanguages of Africa.\u2014During the last year the following books have been published:\u2014Swahili Exercises, by Bishop Steere, 1886, S.P.C.K.
