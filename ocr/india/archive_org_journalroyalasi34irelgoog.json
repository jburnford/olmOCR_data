Being a Translation of a Book of the I\u1e25y\u0101 \u2018Ul\u016bm ad-D\u012bn of al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b with Analysis, Annotation, and Appendices. By Duncan B. Macdonald, Hartford, Conn.\n\n(Concluded from p. 748, October, 1901.)\n\nWe have now given the rule of the first stage concerning understanding what is heard and applying it; and also the rule of the second stage concerning the ecstasy which is encountered in the heart; so let us now give what of it oozes to the outside, consisting of cries and weeping and movements and rending of clothes, etc. So we say\n\nThe Third Stage of Hearing Music and Singing.\n\nWe will give in it the laws of good conduct related to the hearing of music and singing internally and externally, and what of the traces of ecstasy is praised and what is blamed. The laws of good conduct are five. The first is showing regard for time, place, and company. Al-Junayd said, \u201cHearing has need of three things, and if they are not there, then do not hear; time, place, and company.\u201d His meaning is that there is no advantage in being occupied\nwith Hearing, on an occasion when food is present, or an occasion of discussion or of prayer, or of anything that turns away from emotion of the heart. This is the meaning of showing regard for time; the hearer shows regard for his condition of emptiness as to the heart. And as for place, sometimes it is the beaten highway or a place whose appearance is disliked or where there is some cause which distracts the heart; so he avoids that. And as for company, its cause is that, whenever there is present one of a different nature, who dislikes Hearing, external or a devotee, poor in the subtleties of hearts, he is found burdensome to the assembly and the heart is occupied with him. And so, too, when there is present one of the people of this world who magnifies himself, of whom a care must be taken and to whom regard must be shown; or one of the people of Sufism who strains and feigns ecstasy, being hypocritical in ecstasy and in dancing and in tearing clothes. All these things are disturbing, and it is fit that the Hearing should be abandoned in the case of lack of those three conditions.\n\nThe conditions just mentioned are to be considered by the listener; but the second law is a matter to be considered by those who are present. It is that the Shaykh, whenever beginners [Murids] are around him whom Hearing has ought not to listen in their presence, and if he listens, let him occupy them in some other way. The beginner who is hurt by singing is one of three. The lowest of these in rank is he who does not attain in the Path except external works, and who has no taste for Hearing. So let him be occupied with Hearing is his being occupied with what he does not know. For he is not of the people of sport that he should sport, nor of the people of taste that he should enjoy himself in Hearing; so let him be occupied in praising and service, otherwise his time is wasted. The second is he who has taste for Hearing, but in him a reminder of the fanciful desires [huz\u016bz] and a turn to lusts and fleshly qualities, and he is not yet subdued.\n\n1 *Twigs*, see note in *Lift*, p. 89.\nwith such a subduing that there is safety from his wicked-\nnesses. Then, often, Hearing arouses in him a summoner\nto sport and lust; and so his path is cut off, and his way\nto perfection is barred. The third is that his lust should\nhave been broken and there be safety from his wickedness,\nand his perception have been opened and the love of God\nMost High rule over his heart; but he be not wise in the\nexternal part of science, and does not know the names and\nthe qualities of God Most High and what is allowable with\nregard to Him and what is impossible. Then, whenever\nthe gate of Hearing is opened he applies what is heard to\nwhat is allowable and to what is not allowable with regard\nto God Most High; so his hurt from such thoughts as are\nunbelief is greater than his advantage from the Hearing.\nSahl\u00b9 said, \u201cEvery ecstasy to which the Book and the\nSunna do not witness is false.\u201d And for such a one as\nthis, Hearing is not good, nor for him whose heart is yet\nsoiled with the love of this world and the love of praise\nand glory, nor for him who listens for the sake of the\npleasure and to find delight in the impression. Then that\nbecomes a custom to him and diverts him from his religious\nduties and from regard for his heart; and his path is cut\noff. So Hearing is a slippery place for the foot; from it\nthe weak should be kept. Al-Junayd said: \u201cI saw Iblis\nin sleep and said to him, \u2018Dost thou gain the mastery over\nany of our comrades in anything?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, on\ntwo occasions; on occasion of Hearing and on occasion of\ntheological speculation [nazar], for I go in to them thereat.\u2019\u201d\nThen said one of the Shaykhs, \u201cIf I had seen him I would\nhave said to him, \u2018How foolish thou art! One who hears\nfrom Him when He hears, and speculates about Him when\nhe speculates, how canst thou gain the mastery over him?\u2019\u201d\nThen said al-Junayd, \u201cThou hast spoken truth.\u201d\n\nThe third law is that he should be attentive to what\nthe speaker says, present in heart, turning aside little,\nguarding himself from gazing upon the faces of those who\nare listening and upon what they exhibit of states of ecstasy,\n\n\u00b9 Sahl at-Tustari; see note I on p. 252 (1901).\nabsorbed in himself and in the guarding of his own heart and in the treasuring of what God Most High opens to him of His mercy in his secret heart, keeping himself from a movement that would disturb the hearts of his comrades. He should be in external rest, still in his extremities, holding himself from coughing or yawning. And he should sit with bent head as he would sit in thought that absorbed his heart, restraining himself from hand-clapping and leaping and the rest of the movements used to work up the emotions and make a hypocritical show, silent in the intervals of the recitation from such conversation as can be avoided. Then if ecstasy overcome him and move him without his volition, he is excusable in regard to it and not blameworthy. But whenever volition returns to him let him return to his stillness and to his repose; it is not incumbent on him that he should seek to prolong his ecstasy out of shame, lest it should be said, \"His ecstasy was soon cut short,\" nor that he should constrain himself to an ecstasy, out of fear, lest it should be said, \"He is hard of heart, lacking in purity and softness.\" It is related that a youth used to accompany al-Junayd, and whenever he heard aught of the mention of God he would cry out. Then al-Junayd said to him, \"If you do that another time, you shall not accompany me.\" And thereafter he kept putting pressure upon himself until from every hair of him there would drip a drop of water, and he did not cry out. And it is related that he choked one day through the force of the pressure upon him and sobbed a single sob, and his heart broke and he died.\n\nAnd it is related on tradition that M\u016bs\u0101 was telling traditional stories among the Ban\u016b Isr\u0101\u2018il, and one of them rent his dress or his shirt. And God Most High revealed to M\u016bs\u0101, \"Say to him, 'Rend for me thy heart and rend not thy dress.'\"\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Qa\u1e63\u1e63a; on the professional qa\u1e63\u1e63a and the practice of qa\u1e63\u1e63, see Goldziher in ZDMG., xxviii, p. 320.\n\n\u00b2 Joel, ii, 13; Moses is a bad shot even for a Muslim, but the whole thing is a good example of Oriental incuriosity.\nAb\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim an-Na\u1e63r\u0101b\u0101dh\u012b said to Ab\u016b \u2018Amr b. Najid, \"I say that whenever the people gather together, and there is with them a reciter of poems who recites, it is better for them than that they should talk slander.\" Then said Ab\u016b \u2018Amr, \"Hypocrisy in regard to Hearing\u2014and it is that you should show in yourself a state that is not in you\u2014is worse than that you should talk slander thirty years or thereabouts.\"\n\nAnd if you should say, \"Is the more excellent he whom Hearing does not move and upon whom it does not make an impression or he upon whom it appears?\" Then know that the lack of external appearance is at one time on account of weakness of the visitant [w\u0101rid] that springs from Hearing, and that is defeat; and at another time it is in spite of strength of ecstasy, but motion does not appear on account of perfect strength in control of the limbs, and that is perfection. And, at another time, it is on account of the state of ecstasy inhering in and being part of all the states. Then an increase of impression does not show itself on occasion of Hearing, and that is the utmost degree of perfection. For the ecstasy of him who has ecstasy in most states does not last, but he who is in a lasting ecstasy is applying himself assiduously and constantly to the Truth, and is clinging to the essence of Witnessing. Then such a one the occurrence of the states does not change. And it is reasonable to suppose that what is pointed to in the saying of as-\u1e62idd\u012bq, \"We were like you; then our hearts became hardened,\" is our hearts became powerful and were strengthened, and became able to cling constantly to ecstasy in all states while we are hearing the thoughts of the Qur\u02be\u0101n continually; and the Qur\u02be\u0101n is not new with regard to us nor fresh upon us so that we should be affected by it. So, then, the force of ecstasy moves the external manifestations, and the force of reason and self-restraint controls them, and sometimes the\n\n1 Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim Ibr\u0101h\u012bm b.

Al-Qush., p. 36.\none of them overcomes the other either on account of the vehemence of its force or on account of the weakness of what opposes it, and it is defeat or perfection in accordance with that. Then think not that he who throws himself upon the ground in agitation is more perfect as to ecstasy than he who is still and does not agitate himself; yea, often he who is still is more perfect as to ecstasy than he who is in agitation. Al-Junayd, in his novitiate, was wont to be moved through Hearing; then he came not to be moved, and people spoke to him about that. He said, \"And thou seest the hills, thou thinkest them firm, but they shall pass away even as the clouds pass away\u2014a work of God who hath made everything perfect\" [Qur., xxvii, 90]. This points to the fact that the heart may be agitated, circling in the invisible world [malak\u016bt], and the limbs externally well disciplined and at rest. And Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan Mu\u1e25ammad b. A\u1e25mad\u00b9 said\u2014he was in al-Ba\u1e63ra\u2014\"I companied with Sahl b. \u2018Abd All\u0101h sixty years, and I never saw him change at a thing which he heard of mention of God or from the Qur\u2019\u0101n. And when he was at the end of his life a man recited before him, And on this day there shall not be taken a ransom from you [Qur., lvii, 14], and the rest of the verse. Then I saw him tremble and almost fall. And when he returned to himself I asked him about that. And he said, \u2018Yes, my beloved, we have grown weak.\u2019 And so, too, one time he heard the saying of Him Most High, The kingdom on that day shall verily belong to the Compassionate One [Qur., xxv, 28]; then he was agitated. And Ibn S\u0101lim,\u00b2 one of his companions, questioned him, and he said, \u2018I have grown weak.\u2019 Then they said to him, \u2018If this springs from weakness, what is strength of state?\u2019 He said, \u2018That there should not come upon one a visitant [w\u0101rid] without his meeting it with the strength of his state; then the visitants do not change him, although they are powerful.\u2019\u201d And the cause of that strength in controlling\n\n\u00b9 Ab\u016b-l-Husayn (so the SM.) Mu\u1e25ammad b. Ahmad: d. 387. See Ibn Khall., iii, pp. 21 f.\n\u00b2 Ibn S\u0101lim; see note 3 on p. 203 (April, 1901).\nthe external parts in spite of the presence of ecstasy, is equality of the states in constant clinging to witnessing; as it has been related concerning Sahl that he said, \"My condition before prayer and after it is one\"; for he was a regarer of the heart, present in recollection with God Most High in every state. And thus he was before Hearing, and after it, since his ecstasy was abiding and his thirst enduring and his drinking continuous, inasmuch as Hearing had no effect in increasing his ecstasy, like as it is related that Mimsh\u0101dh ad-D\u012bnawar\u012b came upon a company, among whom was a reciter of poems, and they became silent. But he said, \"Return to what you were about, for even though you gathered all the musical instruments of the world in my ears, my meditation would not be disturbed, nor would aught appear of what is in me.\" And al-Junayd said, \"Defect of ecstasy does not hurt when there is abundance of science, and abundance of science is more powerful than abundance of ecstasy.\" But if you say, \"Why does such a one as this attend Hearing?\" know that some of these abandoned Hearing in the perfection of their strength, and were wont to attend only occasionally in order to assist one of the brethren and to cause joy to enter his heart. And often he would attend that the people might perceive the completeness of his power and know that completeness is not in external ecstasy; then that they might learn from him the control of the external through application, though they might be unable to imitate him in his becoming a model to them. And if their being present fell with other than people of this kind, they were with them with their bodies, but distant from them with their hearts and what is within; just as they might sit, apart from Hearing, with other than their kind for accidental causes which required such sitting with them. Then some copied from these the abandoning of Hearing, thinking that the cause of their abandoning it was that they were able to do without it through what we have mentioned. And some of them belonged to the ascetics, and had no spiritual part [\u1e25a\u1e93\u1e93 r\u016b\u1e25\u0101n\u012b] in Hearing, and were not of\nthe people of sport, and so abandoned it that they might not be distracted through what did not concern them. And some abandoned it for lack of brethren. It was said to one, \"Why do you not hear?\" He said, \"From whom and with whom?\"\n\nThe fourth law is that he should not rise up or raise his voice in weeping while he is able to restrain himself. Yet if he dance or force weeping, that is allowable whenever he does not intend hypocrisy by it; for forcing weeping induces grief and dancing is a cause of joy and liveliness. And the moving of every allowable joy is permissible; if it were unlawful '\u0100'isha would not have looked on at the Abyssinia with the Apostle of God while they were kicking out. That is '\u0100'isha's expression in some traditions, and it has been handed down from a number of the Companions that they hopped when a joy befell them which called for that. It is in the story of Ibna \u1e24amza when there disput about her 'Al\u012b b. Ab\u012b T\u0101lib and his brother Ja'far and Zayd b. \u1e24\u0101ritha, and they contended together jealously as her rearing. Then the Prophet said to 'Al\u012b, \"Thou art of me and I am of thee,\" and 'Al\u012b hopped; and he said to Ja'far, \"Thou resemblest me outwardly and inwardly,\" and he hopped behind the hopping of 'Al\u012b; and he said to Zayd, \"Thou art our brother and our freedman,\" and he hopped behind the hopping of Ja'far. Then the Prophet said, \"She belongs to Ja'far, for her maternal aunt is his wife, and the maternal aunt is the same as the mother.\"\n\n1 Here al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b and those like him appear to be opposed to simple ascetics. Such ascetics are incapable of higher spiritual life and gain nothing by music and singing; they do not belong to \"the people of the heart.\" Further, they are opposed to recreation and light things generally; not seeing what may be gained from them, they consider them vain.\n\n2 ZFN. It means in the first instance \"to kick or push with the leg,\" and there is a tradition of F\u0101\u1e6dima that she used to do this to al-\u1e24asan in the sense \"dance to him.\" The tradition runs, K\u016bnat tazj\u012bnu lil-\u1e24asan; and Layton Lexicon, 1237c, so translates it. But in the Lisan, xvii, p. 58, l. 13, it is explained with turagg\u012bshu, i.e. \"she would dandle him,\" that is, make him dance or leap (nazz\u0101thu) in her lap. See on this latter sense of ZFN Goldziher in the Wiener Zeitschrift, ii, 164 ff.; he there equates ragga\u1e63a with zaffana (the II stem), but I cannot find in the lexicons anything but the I.\n\n3 Ibna \u1e24amza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib; see an-Naw., p. 867, and Ibn Qw\u0101f, p. 60, l. 14.\n\n4 For Ja'far see an-Naw., pp. 192 ff., and note 7 on p. 203; and for Zayd pp. 260 ff.\na tradition it is said that he said to '\u0100'isha, \"Wouldst thou like to look at the kicking out?\" and 'kicking out' and 'hopping' are dancing. And that takes place on account of a pleasure or a yearning, and the law applicable to it is the law applicable to that which rouses it. If the pleasure which causes dancing is praiseworthy, and the dancing increases and strengthens it, then the dancing is praiseworthy. And if the one is permissible, then the other is permissible, and if blameworthy, blameworthy. Yet it is true that the practice of dancing does not befit the station of notable people or people who set an example, because, for the most part, it springs from sport and play, and that which has the aspect of play and sport in the eyes of the people should be avoided by him whose actions are imitated in order that he may not become small in the eyes of the people and they should leave off imitating him.\n\nAnd as to the tearing up of garments, there is no indulgence for it except when the matter passes beyond the control of volition. It is reasonable to suppose that ecstasy may overcome one so that he will tear his garment and yet not know it from the force of the intoxication of ecstasy which is on him. Or he may know it, but he is like one who is constrained and unable to control himself. Then he presents the appearance of one who is forced to do a thing though disliking it; since there is for him in moving or tearing a means of taking breath, and he is forced to it as a sick man is forced to groan. And though he were to impose patience upon himself as to it, he would not be able to control it in spite of its being a free-will action. For man is not able to abandon every action whose occurrence depends upon intention; taking breath is an action whose occurrence depends upon intention, but if a man imposed upon himself that he would hold breath he would be compelled from within him to will taking breath. So, too, is crying out; and tearing of garments sometimes happens in this way; then it is not to be described as forbidden. They spoke in the presence of as-Sari of the occurrence of extreme overwhelming ecstasy, and he said, \"Yes, the face\nof one may be struck with a sword and he not know\nThen they disputed with him about it and found it stra\nthat ecstasy should reach such a point, but he persisted\nwould not abandon his view that in some states this p\nwas sometimes reached by some individuals.\n\nAnd if you ask, \"Then what do you say as to the tear\nof new garments on the part of Sufis after the ecstasy\nsubsided and the Hearing is over, for they tear them\nlittle pieces and distribute them to the people and call t\nkhirqa?\" Know that that is permissible whenever i\ntorn into square pieces useful to patch garments and pra\ncarpets for the kirbas is torn up that the qam\u012b\u1e63 may\nsewn together from it. And that is not waste, for it\ntearing for a purpose. So, too, the patching of garme\nis only possible by means of little pieces, and that is\nobject; and the dividing to the multitude that the ben\nmay be general is an allowable object. Every king\nrequired to divide his kirbas into one hundred pieces o\ngive to one hundred poor people, but it is necessary t\nthe pieces shall be such that they can be made useful\npatching. And in Hearing we prevent only that teari\nwhich spoils the garment, destroying part of it so tha\ndoes not remain capable of use. That is pure waste, s\nis not lawful when it happens by free will.\n\nThe fifth law of good breeding is agreement of the peo\n\n1 The khirqa means first a rag or scrap of cloth, and secondly the mantle\na dervish. It seems to be applied to the mantle as made up of such sh\npatched together. The tearing up and distributing is to distribute the ble\nthat is supposed to cleave to them from having been worn by someone in\nespecially blessed state. So the garments of saints acquire miraculous powe\ncompare Elijah's mantle.\n\n2 The SM. describes the kirbas as a rough thick garment. But that is\nat all suitable here, and the other and common meaning of kirbas, a piece\ncotton cloth, is much better. See Lane, sub voce, and especially the Lis\nviii, pp. 78 f., where a tradition is quoted speaking of a qam\u012b\u1e63, or shirt, m\nof kar\u0101bis, the plural of kirbas.\n\n3 As a garment the kirbas is Persian, and we have probably here a Per\ncustom. I know nothing of it, and the SM., of course, gives no explana\nBut compare the seizing, tearing to pieces, and distribution of the pieces of t\njubba of the khaf\u012b\u1e0d who pronounces the khutba at the Mi'raj festival in mode\nMecca. It is described by Snouck-Hurgronje in his Mekka, ii, pp. 71 f. I\nrefers to the Berlin Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie, 1888, p. 112, where it is descr\nhow the Riff Arabs similarly tear to pieces the burnus of the Sultan.\nin rising up when one of them rises up in a true ecstasy without hypocrisy and strives; or rises up by choice without exhibiting ecstasy, and the company rises up to him. For there must be agreement because agreement belongs to the laws of comradeship. So, too, if it is the custom of a party to throw off the turban in agreement with him who is in ecstasy whenever his turban falls off, or to pull off garments whenever his garment has fallen off him through tearing, then agreement in these things belongs to good comradeship and social intercourse, since disagreement is churlishness and every people has a usage of its own. We must \"consort with people according to their qualities\"\u2014as has come down in the tradition\u2014especially when they are qualities containing good-fellowship and courteous treatment and soothing of the heart with help. And someone may say, \"Lo, that is an innovation [bid'\u0101]; the Companions did not do so.\" But everything judged allowable is not derived from the Companions. What is to be guarded against is committing an innovation which abandons a Sunna handed down from one to another; but forbidding a thing is not to be deduced from this. Rising up on the entrance of anyone was not a custom of the Arabs; yea, the Companions did not rise up for the Apostle of God under some conditions, as Anas has narrated.\u00b9 But since there is not established a general prohibition of it, we do not see any harm in it in those countries where it is a custom to honour him who enters by standing up; for its object is to show respect and to honour and to soothe the heart. So, too, it is with the other kinds of help when they have as object to soothe the heart and are adopted as usage by a company of people. Then there is no harm in their helping in these; yea, the best of things is help, except in a thing with regard to which there has come down a direct prohibition, insusceptible of explanation [ta'wil].\n\nAnd it belongs to good breeding that no one should arise\n\n\u00b9 On not rising to meet visitors as a sunna, cf. the life of 'Ali b. Maym\u016bn in ZDMG., xxviii, p. 300. 'Ali refused to rise to meet anyone, as he was a zealous upholder of sunna in all details.\nto dance with people if his dancing is considered sluggish and inert, lest he should disturb their states for them. Dancing without ecstasy is allowable, and a striver to achieve ecstasy is one in whom the trace of straining is evident to the company. And in the case of him who rises in sincerity, whom you would not think sluggish or inert in nature, the hearts of those present, if they are possessors of hearts, are a touchstone of sincerity and of straining. One of them was asked concerning sound ecstasy, and he said, \"Its soundness is the acceptance of it by the hearts of those present when they are like not opposites.\"\u00b9\n\nThen if you say, \"But what about that disposition which turns aside from dancing, does it rush erroneously to the opinion that dancing is lying, vain, and contrary to Faith, while he that is vehement in the Faith never dances without blaming it?\" then know that there is vehemence that is greater than the vehemence of the Apostle of God, and he saw the Abyssinians kicking out in the Mosque and did not blame what they were doing, because it was at a suitable time, that is, a time of Festival, and the part of suitable individuals, that is, Abyssinians. It is true that some dispositions turn aside from it, because it is seen for the most part in combination with vanity and play, and vanity and play are allowable, but only for the common people of the Zanj and Abyssinians and their like, while they are disliked in those who are notable people because they do not befit them. But it is not lawful to describe forbidden what is disliked because it does not befit the position of a person of note. If one asked a poor man something, and he gave him a cake of bread, that would be a praiseworthy gift; but if he asked a king and he gave him a cake of bread or two cakes of bread, that would be blameworthy in the sight of all men and would be written.\n\n\u00b9 The sense apparently is that the dancer in an ecstasy (wajid) is light and brisk in his movements, but he who is trying to bring on an ecstasy (mutawajid) is heavy and clumsy. The sincerity of the mutawajid can only be judged by the insight of those present.\nin books of history as of the number of his evil deeds, and his posterity and adherents would be upbraided with it. But, in spite of that, it is not lawful that what he did should be forbidden, since he, inasmuch as he gave bread to the poor man, was beneficent, but inasmuch as, in relation to his position, it was like refusing in relation to the poor man, his action is to be considered vile. So, too, it is with dancing and the class of permissible things that follow the same rule. \"The permissible deeds of common people are the evil deeds of pious people, and the good deeds of pious people are the evil deeds of archangels.\"\u00b9 But this is when we take account of relationship to different positions, and whenever the thing is looked at as it is in itself, the sentence must be passed that in it, as it is in itself, there is nothing forbidden\u2014and God knows best.\u00b2\n\nIt follows from all that has preceded, sectionwise, that listening to Music and Singing is sometimes absolutely forbidden and sometimes permissible and sometimes disliked and sometimes to be loved. It is forbidden to the most of mankind, consisting of youths and those whom the lust of this world controls so that Music and Singing arouse in them only that which has control of their hearts, consisting of blameworthy qualities. And it is disliked with reference to him who, it is true, does not apply it to the form of created things, but in whose case a habit which he has leads him on most occasions on the path of vain sport. And it is allowed with reference to him who has no delight in it except the taking pleasure in beautiful sounds. And it is loved with reference to him whom the love of God Most High controls and in whom Music and Singing arouse only praiseworthy qualities. The Praise belongeth to God alone, and His Benediction be upon Mu\u1e25ammad and his Family!\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 The often quoted saying of Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd al-Kharr\u0101z; see on him note 2 on p. 713 (1901).\n\u00b2 This phrase generally implies some grain of doubt in the mind of its user as to the correctness of what he has just said. But the SM. notes that here it is used lit-tabarruk, for the sake of gaining a blessing, i.e., al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b had no doubt as to the truth of his conclusion, but added the formula on general principles.\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.\n\nIn the following table the life of al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b is exhibited in outline as a part of the history of his time. For a full statement of his life and views, I would refer to my article in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 1899, pp. 71\u2013132. The sketch which I give here only be suggestive, but its suggestiveness can hardly be exaggerated. A year before the birth of this man, who was to be the restorer of faith in his age, died Ab\u016b-l-'al-Ma'arri, the great and only poet of scepticism in Arabic literature. In the year itself of his birth al-M\u0101ward\u012b, the master of constitutional law; in his lifetime al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b was to see the empire of the Seljuqs shrivel up and the Kh\u0101lifate move nearer to its end. When he was fifteen died al-Qushayr\u012b, who had done so much to formulate Sufism; he was to carry on his work. In his earliest youth had fallen the momentous exile of Ab\u016b Ma'\u0101li at Mecca, and the death of the same in 478\u2014a turning-point in his life. A year later, while he was with Niz\u0101m al-Mulk, the battle of az-Zal\u0101qa in Spain marked an epoch in the history of the Muslim West. Again two years later, N\u0101\u1e63ir b. Khusr\u016b died, poet, traveller, philosopher; he stands beside al-Qushayr\u012b and 'Uthman Khayy\u0101m for different phases of the mysticism and thought of the time. But a little later again\u2014al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b was with Niz\u0101m al-Mulk\u2014Isl\u0101m received two great blows. Hasan b. as-\u1e62abb\u0101\u1e25 seized Alam\u016bt, and the power of the Assassins stood firm for a century and a half until the Mongol wave under H\u00fcl\u0101g\u016b swept unchecked to the Mediterranean. In the same year Malta was taken by the Normans, never to be held again by Isl\u0101m. Now events crowd on, in all of which al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b had some part or with which he had so\nconnection. Niz\u0101m al-Mulk and M\u0101lik Sh\u0101h fall under the dagger; the Assassins are showing their teeth. The unending civil war that marks the decadence of a Muslim state appears; Bargiy\u0101ruq becomes Great Seljuq. Jerusalem is lost, first to the F\u0101\u1e6dimids, and by them to the Crusaders; the first Crusade has begun. In the year of its fall passes away, too, that hammer of Isl\u0101m and Christendom alike, El Cid Campeador. In 504 dies al-Kiy\u0101, an old fellow-pupil, and, in the eyes of many of his time, a greater scholar; a year more and al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b himself ends his short and troubled life: posterity has long since settled what place each shall hold. He had seen the star of the Mur\u0101bit empire rise and wax; if he had lived out the ordinary life of man he might have seen it wane. Nineteen years after him died Ibn T\u016bmart, the Mahd\u012b of the Muwa\u1e25\u1e25ids. Another fourteen years and az-Zamakhshar\u012b went his way, often and wrongly called the last of the Mu\u02bftazilites; their creed in differing forms survived for many a long year the polemic of al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b. In the field of letters he had as contemporaries, more or less, al-Jaw\u0101liq\u012b the lexicographer, N\u0101\u1e63ir b. Khusr\u016b and \u2018Umar Khayy\u0101m, al-Bakr\u012b the geographer, at-Tughra\u02bei the learned scribe, waz\u012br, and soi-disant poet (has not his L\u0101miyatul-\u02bfAjam enjoyed more European editions than any other piece of Arabic verse?), al-\u1e24ar\u012br\u012b, the master of ornate prose and artificial verse, and al-Mayd\u0101n\u012b of the proverbs. But a little after him died al-Baghaw\u012b, who first redacted the Tradition Books of the Six into practical and edifying form, and ash-Sh\u0101hrast\u0101n\u012b, who has laid before us with rare objectivity the religious world of his day and horizon. It was an age of summing up; of compendiums and systems. Meanwhile, in Europe, Hastings is lost and won when al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b has seen eight years; Hildebrand is running his great career and nourishing his vast dreams; he loves righteousness and hates iniquity, and dies in exile in the same year that the Im\u0101m al-Haramayn passes tranquilly away in the circle of his disciples. Berengerius and Lanfranc confront one another while al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b is wrestling with the theology of the schools and raising the clouds that\nare to overshadow his faith. But as he passes from us,\nthe shadow a new life springs in Europe as well. Anse\nthe father of scholasticism, has died, and the university\nBologna is founded; Abelard teaches at Paris; we pass fi\nthe Origen of Rome to the Sic et Non. In Abelard there\nmuch to remind us of al-Ghazzali\u2014his keen questioning\nscornful mind; but there is more in his great opponent\nSt. Bernard of Clairvaux, with his faith, his yearning\nupward, and his sagacity. If we can conceive of an Abel\nbecoming into a Bernard, we have the life of al-Ghazzali.\nSuch was the Europe of which the Muslim knew nothing\nin reality, but knew Christendom only under shield on\nterms of peace.\n\nwell.

Added to this there was other evidence from stray references, notes on the margin of manuscripts, and like; see Fl\u00fcgel in ZDMG., xvi, 691; Fleischer's note Cat. codd. MSS. orr. bibl. reg. Dresd., p. 94, and Cat. MSS. bibl. sen. Lips., p. 366. The publication of the al-\u2018Ar\u016bs by the Sayyid Murta\u1e0d\u0101, and of his commentaries\nthe *Ihy\u0101*, has, however, added much to the evidence, and somewhat changed its bearing.\n\nIn the *T\u0101j* (vol. viii, p. 44, ll. 19 ff.) the SM. writes:\n\n\"Ghaz\u0101la is one of the villages of T\u016bs, it is said. And to it is referred the *nisba* of the Im\u0101m Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, according to an-Nawawi's statement in the *Tiby\u0101n*. But Ibn al-Ath\u012br said that the form with *takhfif* is not the known form, and he approved of *tashdid* in it. And it is referred as a *nisba* to *ghazz\u0101l*, a seller of spun yarn; or it is related to *al-ghazz\u0101l* according to the usage of the people of Khw\u0101rizm and Jurj\u0101n, as *al-\u2018a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r\u012b* is related to *al-\u2018a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r*. As-Subk\u012b and Ibn Khallik\u0101n and Ibn Shuhba spread that view.\"\n\nHere there is no mention of Ibn as-Sam\u02bf\u0101n\u012b. An-Nawaw\u012b (d. 676) spells with one *z*, and refers to this asserted village. Ibn al-Ath\u012br (*Izz ad-D\u012bn*, the author of the *Lub\u0101b*, the basis of as-Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b's *Lubb al-lub\u0101b*, d. 630), on the other hand, prefers *tashdid*. Then Ibn as-Subk\u012b (the author of the *Tabaq\u0101t*, d. 771), Ibn Khallik\u0101n (d. 681), and Ibn Shuhba (*Taq\u012b ad-D\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr*, d. 850) spread the view that *ghazz\u0101l\u012b* was to be explained by the custom of the people of Khw\u0101rizm and Jurj\u0101n to use the measure *fu\u02bf\u0101l\u012b* instead of *fu\u02bf\u0101l*. Evidently in the SM.'s copy of Ibn Khallik\u0101n there was no mention of as-Sam\u02bf\u0101n\u012b; it is only in the autograph manuscript, and there as a marginal note.\n\nIn the introduction to the commentary on the *Ihy\u0101* (vol. i, p. 18) there is a section on this *nisba*:\n\n\"The author of the *Tuhfah al-Irsh\u0101d* says, deriving from an-Nawaw\u012b in the *Daq\u0101\u02beiq ar-Rauda*, 'Tashdid in al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b is the known form which Ibn al-Ath\u012br mentioned, but it has reached us that he (i.e. an-Nawaw\u012b) said that it was a *nisba* to Ghaz\u0101la with *takhfif*, one of the villages of T\u016bs.' I (the SM.) say that so an-Nawaw\u012b mentions it also in the *Tiby\u0101n*. And adh-Dhab\u0101b\u012b (d. 748) said in the *Ibar*, and Ibn Khallik\u0101n in the *Ta\u02berikh*, that it was a custom of the people of Khw\u0101rizm and Jurj\u0101n to say *al-qas\u1e63\u0101r\u012b* and *al-habb\u0101r\u012b* with *ya* in both; so they referred the *nisba* to *ghazl*, and said *al-ghazz\u0101l\u012b*, and like that is *ash-shah\u1e25\u0101m\u012b*. Ibn as-Sam\u02bf\u0101n\u012b (d. 562) also pointed\nto that and denied the *takhfif*, and said, 'I asked the people of \u1e6c\u016bs concerning this village and they denied its existence; the addition of the *ya*, they said, was for strengthening.' And according to the annotation of some of our shaykhs it is to distinguish between a *nisba* referring to the trade it was in and a *nisba* referring to someone whose trade it was. This is plain in the case of al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b, for he was not of those who span wool and sold it; that was only the trade of his father and grandfather. But in the *Mi\u1e63b\u0101\u1e25* (finished 710) of al-Fayy\u016bm\u012b is a statement that defends *takhfif* and involves that Ghaz\u0101la is a village in \u1e6c\u016bs, and that the name of the Im\u0101m Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid refers to it. He says, 'That was related to me by the shaykh Majd ad-D\u012bn b. Mu\u1e25ammad b. Ab\u012b-\u1e6d-\u1e6c\u0101hir Sharw\u0101nsh\u0101n b. Abi-l-Fad\u0101\u02beil Fakhr\u0101w b. \u2018Ubayd All\u0101h b. Sitt al-Mun\u0101 (?) bint Ab\u012b \u1e24\u0101mid al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b at Baghdad in the year 710. He said to me, \"The people have erred in writing our ancestor's name without *tashdid*; it is *mukhaffaf* only.\"'\n\nAnd ash-Shih\u0101b al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb said at the end of the *shar\u1e25* on the *Shif\u0101\u02be*, 'It is said that the *nisba* refers to Ghaz\u0101la, daughter of Ka\u02bfb al-A\u1e25b\u0101r.' If this is sound there is no escaping it. But the opinion generally depended upon now among the later writers of history and the genealogists is that Ibn al-Ath\u012br is in the right, i.e. that it is with *tashdid.*\n\nAt last the question was settled as questions are apt to be settled in Isl\u0101m. Al-Aydar\u016bs, a shaykh of the SM., drew attention to the fact that the Prophet, seen in a dream, had pronounced the name with double *z*. The SM. only alluded to this story here, but in the tractate of al-Aydar\u016bs referred to elsewhere (*Life*, p. 109) it is given on the margin of the SM., i, p. 29. It was the shaykh Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan ash-Sh\u0101dhil who saw the Prophet boasting of al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b to M\u016bs\u0101 ar-\u012as\u0101, and asking them if there was his like as a doctor of their flocks. After that there could be no more doubt; compare the story of the head of al-\u1e24usayn given by Lane in *The Modern Egyptians* (chap. ix) and Lane's remark.\n\n---\n\n1 D. 656: ZDMG., vii, 13 ff.; lii, 557, note. He was a native of Sh\u0101dhil in North Africa, and founded the Sh\u0101dhiliya order of dervishes.\nHere the oldest evidence is that of as-Sam\u02bf\u0101n\u012b, who also knew the ground at first-hand. It is evident that in his time the two forms were current, and that the two explanations were: (1) that it was from ghazl on the measure fa\u02bf\u0101l\u012b used by the people of Khw\u0101rizm and Jurj\u0101n for fa\u02bf\u0101l; and (2) that it was from Ghaz\u0101la, a village of T\u016bs. As-Sam\u02bf\u0101n\u012b, however, working on the spot, could find no trace or recollection of such a village; and it should be remembered that he died only fifty-seven years after al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b. Nor can I find in the geographers the slightest reference to such a Ghaz\u0101la. It is true that T\u016bs consisted of a complex of villages, and that the name of one might have been little prominent; but still it could hardly have escaped as-Sam\u02bf\u0101n\u012b\u2019s researches. But that it referred to this village, Ghaz\u0101la, was also the tradition in the family of Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid. This is a very important fact and is unexceptionally vouched for. Further, we have seen that the grand-uncle was also known under the same nisba. Is it possible that the nisba to a village Ghaz\u0101la was introduced into the family several generations back and continued in use after the village had disappeared, and that the origin of the nisba was forgotten except by those best informed? Then people may have begun to pronounce the name with tashdid, and explain it as a case of the measure fa\u02bf\u0101l\u012b for fa\u02bf\u0101l. In any case it is to be noticed that while as-Sam\u02bf\u0101n\u012b shows that the pronunciation with one z existed in his day, he cannot be quoted as approving of it. In Ibn Khallik\u0101n the passage which is supposed to involve that is a marginal insertion in the autograph, and runs literally: takinna h\u0101dha q\u0101lahu-s-Sam\u02bf\u0101niyu fi kit\u0101bi-l-ans\u0101b wa-l\u0101hu a\u02bflam; apparently it has been inserted in the wrong place.\n\nBut the question is again complicated by the fact that there are several others with the same nisba as our family of T\u016bs. The SM. says (i, p. 19) that it was the general opinion that there were no others, but that he had himself found two and then a third. One of them was \u2018Abd al-B\u0101q\u012b b. Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Abd al-W\u0101hid, the faq\u012bh, Ab\u016b-l-Man\u1e63\u016br al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b. He studied Fiqh with al-Kiy\u0101, and traditions\nAK-NAZZALI ON MUSIC AND ECSTASY.\n\nWe learned down from him by the \u1e25\u0101fi\u1e93 Ab\u016b-\u1e6d-Talib al-Na\u1e63\u012br\u012b. He died 513. The second was \u2018Ali b. Ma\u2019s\u016bm al-Dharr Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b. He was a Maghribi and a Sh\u0101fi\u02bfite, was born in 496, and died in Isfara\u012bn 565. The third was of later date, al-\u2018Al\u0101 \u2018Ali b. A\u1e25m ad-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b, the author of the Miz\u0101n al-istiq\u0101ma li-ahli-l-qaswul-kawima. He died 721. Further, I find that some have alleged the existence of a Mahm\u016bd al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b, a Mu\u2019tazili who was author of the Manh\u016bl instead of Ab\u016b \u1e24am\u012bd this, because of the railing accusations brought against Ab\u016b Hanifa in the Manh\u016bl. It seems hard to believe that these sprang from this vanished village of T\u016bs.\n\nSuch are the facts so far as I can find them, but they do not guide me to any certain result. I have, therefore, used the form al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b as that which eventually won its way universal acceptance in the East.\n\n1 Al-khayr\u0101t al-hi\u1e63\u0101n fi man\u0101qib al-Im\u0101m Abi Hanifa, by Ibn \u1e24\u0101j al-Haytami, p. 4 of ed. of Cairo, 1304. See also Life, p. 106.\nANALYSIS.\n\nTitle of Book. Ascription of praise to God as the enchainer of the hearts of His Saints and Blessing on Mu\u1e25ammad. Statement that Music and Singing are a means of eliciting what is truly present in the heart; under their influence the heart reveals itself and what it contains. This book will be in two chapters\u2014(I) The lawfulness of listening to Music and Singing, and (II) Their laws and effects on the heart and body (pp. 198\u2013200).\u00b9\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\u00a7 1 (pp. 200\u2013207).\n\nStatements of the learned opining that such listening is unlawful (pp. 200\u2013202), and, on the contrary, that it is lawful (pp. 202\u2013207). But these openly contradict one another. It is plain that thus, through attaching ourselves to authority, we can get no certainty. We must examine, rather, the legal sources of prohibition and permission (p. 207).\n\n\u00a7 2 (pp. 207\u2013244).\n\nA proof that listening to Music and Singing is allowable. A proof that it is unlawful must base on statute, i.e. what Mu\u1e25ammad said or did, or on analogy from statute. But it will be shown that no such statute or analogy exists, and that statute and analogy rather indicate allowableness (pp. 207\u2013208).\n\nListening to Music and Singing is hearing a sound, pleasant, measured, with a meaning, moving the heart. But hearing a pleasant sound is not unlawful (pp. 208\u2013210);\n\n\u00b9 Up to the middle of p. 27 the page references are to this Journal for 1901.\nnor is it if measure be added (pp. 210\u2013211). Yet certain instruments are expressly excepted by statute because they have been associated with drinking customs. So, too, if anyone especially connects Singing and Music with drinking and is through them led astray, listening is unlawful to him. Thus a distinction is to be made between some musical instruments and others; and those that are forbidden are not forbidden because they give pleasure but because of association (pp. 211\u2013215). Nor can the addition of a meaning to the pleasing, measured sound make it unlawful, always presupposing that the meaning itself is lawful (p. 216).\n\nThere are many traditions that the Prophet listened to poetry (pp. 215\u2013217). Strange effect on the mind of simply Music apart from words bearing a meaning (p. 218). Story of camels (pp. 219 f.). Nature of impression varies with circumstances and persons. Seven purposes for which Singing can be used\u2014(1) To incite to pilgrimage (p. 220). But it is not lawful to incite to go on pilgrimage to whom pilgrimage is unlawful (p. 221). (2) To urge warfare under the same conditions of lawfulness (pp. 221\u2013222). (3) To excite courage on the day of battle (p. 224). (4) To rouse to lamentation or sorrow, blameworthy or praiseworthy according to the sorrow (pp. 222\u2013223). (5) To arouse joy. Many traditions that the Prophet regards that as allowable (pp. 223\u2013228). (6) To arouse love and longing\u2014conditions when Music and Singing for that purpose are allowable (pp. 228\u2013229). (7) To arouse the love of God. Then are aroused States, i.e. Revelations and Caressings, unknowable except by experience. These bring after them further Visions, but how that happens is the secret of God (pp. 229\u2013230). How love and passionate love ('ishq) can be felt for God. How great is His perfection and how great should be the passion for Him! The love of God the only true love, and the term 'passion' only applicable to Him (pp. 231\u2013234).\n\nIn what cases is listening to Music and Singing unlawful? Five cases: (1) If the producer of Music be a woman under certain conditions (pp. 235\u2013236). (2) The instrument\nused: some are expressly prohibited (p. 237). (3) The content of what is sung: is satire allowable? is love-poetry allowable? (pp. 237\u2013238). How the heart applies the expressions heard to God and to intercourse with Him: examples (pp. 238\u2013239). To him who loves God and can thus apply what he hears, listening to Music and Singing is recommended (p. 239). (4) If lust have control over the listener, listening is unlawful for him (pp. 239\u2013240). (5) If anyone love listening to Music for its own sake and give too much time to it, that is unlawful for him. For its own sake it is allowable only as a recreation (pp. 240\u2013241). Thus Music and Singing are generally lawful, but unlawful under certain conditions (pp. 241\u2013242). The school of ash-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b does not pronounce them unlawful; it only pronounces professionalism unlawful (pp. 242\u2013244).\n\n\u00a7 3 (pp. 244\u2013252).\n\nThe arguments of those who pronounce against Music and Singing and the answer to them. Passages from the Qur\u02be\u0101n and tradition so alleged and their true explanation (pp. 244\u2013250). A general defence of play as a rest and recreation (pp. 251\u2013252).\n\nChapter II.\n\nEffects of Music and Singing and Laws of Polite Conduct with regard to them. There are three stages: understanding what is heard and applying it; ecstasy; movements of members of the body (p. 705). Stage I. Understanding and applying (pp. 705\u2013718). (1) Simple physical hearing as that of an animal is allowable (p. 705). (2) Hearing and applying to the form of a creature, unallowable (p. 705). (3) Hearing of the Murid. He, especially as a beginner, hears and tries to get experiential knowledge of God in his hearing. He takes over and applies to his intercourse with God the expressions which he hears without considering what the poet had meant (pp. 706\u2013707). Examples of this\nand of the ecstasy that it excites (pp. 707\u2013709). To this safely he must know well the law of the knowledge of God. Otherwise he is in danger of ascribing things God which are impossible and of being an unbeliever (pp. 709\u2013710). Some in hearing Music and Singing so far as to blame God for His distribution of ecstasy and His treatment of creatures in His predestining them; this is a great danger (pp. 710\u2013712). Listeners vary in their understanding of the same verses, and all the ways understanding them may be equally right: example (pp. 712\u2013715). Hearing on the part of him who is oblivious to himself and only conscious of God. Description of his state. Only comes in flashes; its consequences sometimes death from the agitation involved (pp. 715\u2013717). This is the highest degree. The nature of the heart in the spiritual sense and how it perceives. From this degree develop the errors of Pantheistic Sufis and Trinitarians (p. 718). Stage II. Ecstasy (pp. 719\u2013748). Its nature as given in various sayings of the Sufis (pp. 719\u2013721), also in statements of philosophers (pp. 721\u2013722). An attempt at a definition of ecstasy as the result produced in the soul by hearing Music and Singing. It may be by way either of knowledge or of feeling. If it expresses itself outwardly it is ecstasy, and varies in force in itself and in proportion to the self-control of him who is hearing (pp. 722\u2013723). It produces purity of heart and alacrity. How truth may be communicated to a pure heart\u2014by a H\u0101tif, by dreams, by al-Kha\u1e0dir, by angels to prophets (pp. 723\u2013725). Insight produced by this purity of heart: anecdotes (pp. 725\u2013727). The result of ecstasy divides into what can be expressed in language and what cannot. This is not strange: we all know ideas and states of feeling which we cannot express in words\u2014especially the feelings excited by instrumental music (pp. 728\u2013730). The difference between ecstasy and the affecting of ecstasy. The latter blameworthy or praiseworthy (p. 730). The path to ecstasy lies often through effort and application (p. 731), or by companionship (p. 732). But why should poetry be used to excite\necstasy and not the Qur'\u0101n? (p. 732). The Qur'\u0101n does excite it: examples (pp. 733\u2013737). But Singing is more powerful for seven reasons (p. 738):\u2014(1) All verses of the Qur'\u0101n do not suit the state of the listener, e.g. legislative verses. Some can be affected by such verses, but that is rare (pp. 738\u2013740). (2) The Qur'\u0101n is known too well, and what is heard for the first time makes a heavier impression (pp. 740\u2013741). (3) Poetry has the advantage of measure (pp. 741\u2013742). (4) The Qur'\u0101n must be recited simply and distinctly without varying to make measure, etc. (p. 742). (5) It is unallowable to accompany the Qur'\u0101n with instrumental music: in other ways also the Qur'\u0101n has to be guarded against profanation (pp. 742\u2013744). (6) If the sense of a verse of the Qur'\u0101n does not fit the hearer, he must either pervert its sense or reject it\u2014both are sins (pp. 744\u2013745). (7) The Qur'\u0101n is the uncreated word of God, and has no link of connection with humanity; therefore poetry makes a stronger impression on the sensuous nature. Thus poetry affects men when the Qur'\u0101n cannot. It is in accord with our human nature, and the Qur'\u0101n is not. Therefore men can write poetry, but cannot produce another Qur'\u0101n. It is a miracle (pp. 745\u2013748). Stage III. What shows itself externally of ecstasy and of the laws of good conduct in ecstasy (pp. 1\u201313). The laws are five:\u2014(1) Regard for time, place, and company (pp. 1\u20132). (2) The Shaykh should not hear in presence of Murids whom it hurts (p. 2). These are of three classes: (a) Those who attain to external works only. (b) Those who have still some passions and lusts. (c) Those who are ignorant of theology and therefore apply wrongly (pp. 2\u20133). (3) Attention to what the speaker says and avoidance of distraction (p. 3). The hearer should put pressure on himself and only give way to ecstasy when he cannot help it (p. 4). Lack of external ecstasy may be weakness of ecstasy, but may also be strength on the part of the hearer: examples of such self-restraint. He who is always beholding God does not yield to external ecstasy (pp. 5\u20137). Why do those who are thus perfect attend assemblies to listen\nto Music and Singing? In order to give an example and encouragement to others (pp. 7\u20138). (4) Not to rise and weep if restraint is possible. Yet if that will increase the emotion it is allowable: traditions in example (pp. 8\u20139). Garment-tearing only allowable when self-restraint is lost (p. 9). The tearing of new garments after ecstasy and distribution of the pieces only allowable when the piece may be useful (p. 10). (5) If one rises or throws off his garment or his turban, the others should aid him in a spirit of comradeship and courtesy. Yet that, like all social usages, depends on the usage of the country (pp. 10\u201311). No one should dance whose dancing is sluggish and inelegant (p. 11). The test of the genuineness of ecstasy is its acceptance by the hearts of the onlookers (p. 12). The suitableness of dancing generally depends on circumstances and the dancer. An allowable thing to one man may not be allowable to another. Legally, dancing is not forbidden (pp. 12\u201313).\n\nRecapitulation: Listening to Music and Singing is sometimes forbidden, sometimes disliked, sometimes loved. All depends on him who listens (p. 13).\nART. II.\u2014The Great St\u016bpa at S\u0101nchi-K\u0101n\u0101kh\u0113\u1e0d\u0101. By\nJas. Burgess, LL.D., C.I.E.\n\nAmong the ancient monuments of India, few are of more interest than the t\u014dps or st\u016bpas at S\u0101nchi-K\u0101n\u0101kh\u0113\u1e0d\u0101, about 5\u00bd miles south-west from Bhels\u0101 or Bhils\u0101, in the Gw\u0101liar territory, and some 20 miles north-east of the capital of the Bhop\u0101l State. There is now a railway station close to the spot, and most of the trains stop there. The various notices of the remains here are scattered in numerous publications, and some notice of them may perhaps be usefully combined with the history of the st\u016bpas since their discovery.\n\nThe larger st\u016bpa consisted of a hemispherical dome, about 110 feet in diameter at the ground level, against which was built a sort of ramp or berm, 14 or 15 feet high, about 5\u00bd feet broad on the top, and sloping out at the base, making the total diameter about 121\u00bd feet. On the top of the dome was a flat area 34 feet in diameter, surrounded by a stone railing, and having a square capital or shrine in the centre.\u00b2 The height of this platform is differently given by Generals Cunningham and Maisey\u2014both on somewhat theoretical grounds rather than from actual measurements: the first gave 56 feet and the second 53\u00bd; it is, perhaps, even somewhat less in height.\u00b3 The base of the st\u016bpa is ascended by a stair on the south side, and the whole is surrounded by a massive stone rail 11 feet high. This is nearly circular, but on the\n\n\u00b9 Lat. 23\u00b0 28' N. and long. 77\u00b0 48' E., in the Diw\u0101nganj subdivision of the Bhop\u0101l State.\n\u00b2 Cunningham's Bhilsa Topes, p. 184.\n\u00b3 Cunningham's statement (Bhilsa Topes, p. 186) that the whole structure must have been upwards of 100 feet in height, was an error: his restored elevation measures only 77\u00bd feet, and General Maisey's 72 feet. Cf. Sanchi and its Remains, p. 6.\nsouth side the stair demanded a slight extension of the curvatures. General Cunningham made the outside diameter of the dome 144\u00bd feet from east to west and 151\u00bd feet from north to south, a difference of 7 feet; but as the stair is only about 4\u00bd feet wide at the bottom, and the ramp is narrowed on the southern side, as is also the passage on the ground level, this amount can hardly be accounted for. Mr. H. Cousens last year made a careful re-measurement, with the result that the diameter of the dome at the top of the berm was found to be about 106 feet\u2014perhaps a very little more from north to south and less from east to west; but, owing to the irregularities of curvature in the restorations made about 1881, it is difficult to determine this with precision. The height of the terrace Mr. Cousens reports as 15 ft. 4 in. If the st\u016bpa was originally hemispherical, his measurements give a radius of 55 ft. 2 in.\u00b2 and a height of 52 ft. 6 in., with a measurement over the top of 141 ft. 8 in. Of the rail, the diameter from north to south measures 146\u00bd feet, and from east to west 143 feet, and these measurements, if not absolutely correct, must be within a few inches of the truth.\n\nOutside, to the north and south, stood monolithic pillars or l\u0101\u1e6ds, probably set up by A\u015boka\u2014for one of them at least bore one of his inscriptions\u2014and a line connecting them would pass within less than 6 feet of the centre of the st\u016bpa and would be on the meridian. When the gates came to be added, then\u2014to avoid the south pillar (the north one was farther off)\u2014it was necessary to put the entrance on that side a little to the west, and the northern one as much to the east of the cardinal points.\u00b3 These gateways or tora\u1e47as are richly covered with sculpture and probably date from the second\n\n\u00b9 Bhilsa Topes, p. 186.\n\u00b2 This gives an average diameter at the top of the ramp of 106 ft. 1 in.\n\u00b3 It may be noted that the older Nep\u0101l chaityas are mostly hemispherical: Wrigg Hist. of Nep\u0101l, pls. iv, ix, x, and xi. Cf. Oldfield, Sketches from Nep\u0101l, vol. ii, p. 206; and Notes on the Baudh\u0101na Rock-temples of Ajanta (Bombay, 1879), p. 103. A st\u016bpa excavated by Mr. Caddy in Sw\u0101t, in 1896, was also hemispherical.\n\u2074 A smaller monolith, 15 ft. 2 in. high, stood on the south of the east gateway and was still entire in 1852 or later. It seems to have disappeared by 1888. See Mailey, Sanchi and its Remains, p. 73, and pl. xxxiii, fig. 2; Cunningham, Bhilsa Topes, p. 199 and pl. vii.\ncentury B.C., when it is believed the south and north tora\u1e47as were executed, and the other two followed at no very long interval.\n\nThe second st\u016bpa stands at a slightly lower level about 400 yards W.N.W. of the first. Its dome was 39 feet in diameter, and, like the larger one, it had a platform on the top, according to Captain Fell, 19 feet in diameter, which must have been railed round and enclosed the capital. The basement was 6 feet high and projected about 5\u00bd feet. It was surrounded also by a stone rail with four entrances, but, so far as we know, without tora\u1e47as. There are some rather archaic-like sculptures on the pillars of the rail, but the larger st\u016bpa has so engrossed attention that no notice has been taken of them, though they may have an important bearing on the relative ages of the monuments.\n\nThe gateways of the great st\u016bpa stand forward from the rail, which is returned outwards to the back of the right-hand pillars or jambs; and from behind the left-hand pillar a rail is carried about 8\u00bd feet to the left, that is, the width of two interspaces with supporting uprights, and is then returned to the circular rail. This gives an area of about 16 feet by 8\u00bd inside each gateway, and on entering the portal one turns to the left, as the entry through the great rail is not opposite the tora\u1e47a.\n\nFacing each entrance and resting against the basement wall were large figures of Buddha, under carved canopies, which are now quite destroyed. The southern statue only was a standing figure with a large nimbus behind the head, on which were two flying Gandharvas. To the right and left were two attendants of smaller size, that on the left with the curly hair of a Buddha and a long staff, with a small elephant in front of the other.\u00b9 This seems to have been changed in 1881, and is an unfortunate interference which, if unnoticed, may lead to a serious mistake, for the south is the position of the Dhy\u0101ni Buddha Ratnasambhava, who is represented by K\u0101\u015byapa Buddha. It is now a large\n\n\u00b9 See Maisey's Sanchi, p. 14, and pl. xiv, fig. 1.\ncross-legged figure, the head of which has been broken but is set over the bust. The others may also have been altered, for Cunningham describes the northern figure terms which apply to that now on the east; and Maisey's account would agree with this latter position. This figure is seated with the hands in the Dhy\u0101ni mudr\u0101\u2014in lap, with the palms turned up, the robe over b shoulders, with two attendant chauri bearers, and a large decorated halo or nimbus having a flying Gandharva on each side. It may be Akshobhya or his mortal representative Kanakamuni. Colonel Maisey's account of the northern figure, which was still in its place in 1851, whilst the other had been disturbed, differs from Cunningham's; and the former represents the head, which had been broken off, having a high muk\u016b\u1e6da or crown, on the front of which was a seated Buddha.\u00b2 This would seem to point to the Bodhisattva Padmapani, who is associated with Amit\u0101bha of the western heavens. We should rather expect Maitreya in the north. The western figure was also seated, but the head was entirely gone in Maisey's time. Could he have mistaken the head belonging to this for that of the northern figure?\u2014then the arrangement of the \"four Buddhas\" would be that so received in northern Buddhism.\u00b3 The arrangement suggested by General Cunningham is very improbable.\n\nFrom the cast of the eastern torana now in our Museum we find that the side pillars, including the capitals, are 17 ft. 3 in. high by 2 ft. 5\u00bd in. square, and 6 ft. 11 in. apart while the three architraves measure 10 ft. 11 in. in height.\n\n\u00b9 It is possible that the figure that stood here fifty years ago was not the original; a seated figure probably occupied the place in A.D. 450, when \"the four-seated Buddhas\" are mentioned (Fleet, Corp. Inscrip. Ind., vol. iii, p. 262), but is this now the original, or was it the figure of which the head with a large nimbus is now in a cell on the terrace?\n\n\u00b2 Maisey's Sanchi, p. 6, and pl. xv, 10; Cunningham's Bhilsa Topes, p. 191.\n\n\u00b3 In almost all chaityas or stupas, seated figures of the Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas are placed in niches round the base of the dome or garbha, facing the cardinal points. Akshobhya occupies the niche on the eastern face, Ratnasambhava is on the southern, Amit\u0101bha is on the western, and Amoghasiddha on the northern face. Vairocana's place is the centre of the garbha; but he is often placed on the east of the hemisphere, close to the right side of Amit\u0101bha. Cf. Buddhist Art, p. 195; Notes on the Buddha Rock-temples at Ajanta, pp. 98, 99; Oldfield Sketches from Nepal, vol. ii, p. 214.\nor the whole height to the top of the third architrave is 28 ft. 5 in.; the ornaments above rise 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet over the architrave. The northern gateway is 6 ft. 11\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. wide; its jambs 2 ft. 3 in. square and about 18\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet high, 28 ft. 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. to the top of the third architrave, and 33 ft. 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. to the highest point. The west gate pillars were 16 ft. 2 in. high and 2 ft. 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. square; but since re-erection, the height to the lower side of the first architrave is 17 ft. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., to the top of the third 27 ft. 8 in., and to the highest point 28 ft. 1 in. And the re-erected south gate pillars are 1 ft. 9 in. square, and its total height 27 ft. 11 in.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe smaller torana which formed the entrance to the third st\u016bpa is 5 ft. 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. wide, with pillars 1 ft. 4 in. square and 9 ft. 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. high, and its entire height 16 ft. 5 in.\n\nProbably the first British officer to visit these monuments was General Taylor, of the Bengal Cavalry, who was encamped near them during the campaign against the Pindh\u0101ris in 1818. Three of the gateways of the great st\u016bpa were then standing, and the southern one was lying much in the condition in which it continued for fully sixty years afterwards. The great dome was then untouched, and a great part of the railing round the capital (gala or hti) upon it was still in situ. The second st\u016bpa was also untouched, and the third, with the gateway on its south side, was apparently in good preservation. There were remains of eight minor st\u016bpas, besides other buildings within 180 yards of the second, but of their then condition there is no record; they may have been ruinous from age, but most of them would otherwise probably have been undisturbed.\n\nThe next visitor seems to have been Dr. Yeld, and a sketch-plan, drawn to scale, and signed \"Roebuck, 1819,\" fell into Mr. James Prinsep's hands long afterwards, which was accompanied by marginal notes and directions, as if for some one to visit the spot.\\(^2\\) This may have been prepared\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These measurements have mostly been supplied by Mr. Cousens.\n\n\\(^2\\) Journ.

His account was reprinted by Prinsep in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in October, 1834.\u00b9 The two principal st\u016bpas, at least, were then quite entire.\u00b2\n\nIn 1822, when Mr. Herbert Maddock was Political Agent at Bhopal, he obtained permission from the native Government to dig into these venerable monuments\u2014it has been supposed for treasure\u2014and in December of that year Dr. Spilsbury found that Captain Johnson, the Agent's assistant, had completely opened the larger one from the top to what he believed the bottom of the foundation, and found the whole solid brickwork without any appearance of recess or open space within it.\u00b3 The second and smaller st\u016bpa, previously in perfect repair, was also half destroyed by the same bungling amateur antiquaries or searchers for coins in their blundering excavations; and they probably also completed the ruin of the other minor monuments previously unnoticed by the few visitors.\u2074 Similar destructive work has been too often repeated since in India, and even with Government permission. Structures have been demolished in search of relic caskets and the like; and it has been quite forgotten that scientific excavation is an art requiring specially skilled experience.\n\nThis careless search did immense damage to the structures of at least the three larger st\u016bpas, and hastened the dilapidation of their enclosures, while no discovery helped to compensate in any way for the wanton destruction. The west gateway was apparently much shaken, and fell some years afterwards, though the date is uncertain.\n\nOur next notice is of two inscriptions from S\u0101\u00f1chi, copied by the indefatigable Brian H. Hodgson in 1824, probably when he left Calcutta in that year to return to Nep\u0101l.\n\n\u00b9 Ibid., vol. iii, pp. 490\u2013494.\n\u00b2 Cunningham's Bhilaa Topes, pp. 185, 275.\n\u00b3 Journ. As.

In 1835 we find Dr. Spilsbury sending to Prinsep a native drawing, purporting to be from one of the sculptures on the gates, and urging that it would be well worth an amateur's while to take copies of the compartments, \"the sculpture of which is like nothing you see in India.\" In this desire Prinsep heartily joined, and was so far gratified in 1837 by Captain Edw. Smith, who copied and sent him twenty-five of the epigraphs, while Captain W. Murray supplied him with a number of drawings, of which he was only able to reproduce that of the large st\u016bpa from the east, a portion of the lower architrave of the south gateway, and some details.\n\nFergusson's *Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindostan* was published in 1847, in which, while expressing his regret that he had not visited S\u0101\u00f1chi in his tours, he gave a short notice of the st\u016bpas (pp. 21, 22) drawn from the information then available, and illustrated by a drawing of the east gateway, by an unknown artist\u2014but really more beautiful than faithful.\n\nThe same year, Captain Joseph D. Cunningham, R.E., then Political Agent at Bhop\u0101l, submitted to the Bengal Asiatic Society a paper on the antiquities of the districts within his agency, in which a considerable section was devoted to these st\u016bpas, with two plates and measurements. And two years later, Lieut. Fred. C. Maisey, who was employed under the Government of India in special archaeological work in the Upper Betw\u0101 districts of Central India, was called to S\u0101\u00f1chi, having been, at the agent's suggestion, directed to suspend his other work and proceed to prepare an illustrated report on the st\u016bpas, their sculptures and\n\n---\n\n1 Journ.

General Cunningham's only further contribution on this subject was a collection of transcriptions of short donative inscriptions made in 1875 and 1877, chiefly from the small rail that had surrounded the terrace on the dome, together with some architectural details.\n\nThe expense of reproducing Colonel Maisey's excellent drawings caused the Court of Directors to hesitate as to the publication of his work, and the appearance of Colonel Cunningham's volume was perhaps thought to render its non-appearance of less importance.\n\nFor the next dozen years the drawings lay unnoticed, until towards the close of 1866, when the late Mr. Jas. Fergusson was asked to assist the India Office in the illustration of Indian Architecture for the Paris Exposition. Colonel Maisey's drawings were in the Library, and together with Colonel (now Major-General) J. Waterhouse's photographs of the st\u016bpa, taken in 1862, they were committed to him, along with materials relating to the Amar\u0101vati St\u016bpa, and the whole were utilized in his work entitled *Tree and Serpent Worship*, first issued in 1868. This important volume illustrative of Buddha art and mythology helped greatly to create an interest in ancient Indian art, and was issued in a second and revised edition in 1873, which was also soon disposed of. The first half of the volume was mainly devoted to S\u0101\u00f1chi, and was the first serious attempt to explain the sculptures, and to call attention to their character, merits, and interest. The attempted explanations may not have been always satisfactory, but they indicated the lines in which such might be found, and so stimulated the research and examination that lead to discovery. It is to be borne in\n\n*Rep. Arch., Surv. India, vol. x, pp. 55\u201365, and pls. xx\u2013xxii.*\nmind also that Mr. Fergusson had only the drawings of those sculptures which Colonel Mailey had copied; they did not represent the commemorative series of sculptures even on one gateway, and it has since been noticed that different scenes of the same legend are depicted on adjoining panels. To read the scenes aright we need the whole before us, so as to see which belong to the same or connected myths; and the photographs then available were on too small a scale for incisive study. Representations of the whole series of relief in an adequate scale were still a desideratum.\n\nIn 1856 H.H. the Begum of Bhopal was requested to present one of these ancient Sanchi gateways to the Emperor Napoleon III., to be set up in Paris, and she asked whether the British Government might not prefer to have it for the British Museum. The Foreign Secretary, in his reply, wisely requested that no removal of any portion of the Sanchi monument might be permitted\u2014adding that casts would be made of more interesting portions and presented to the French Government. At this juncture also an important scheme was arranged for promoting reproductions of works of art for the benefit of the museums of all countries. In consequence of this suggestion, Major H. H. Cole was sent to Sanchi in 1857 to prepare casts of the north gateway, as being the finest and most entire; he preferred, however, to take the scene from the eastern one. The reproductions thus obtained are now to be seen in the national museums at South Kensington, Edinburgh, Dublin, Berlin, Paris, etc.\n\nIn Prinsep's \"India and Rajahs,\" published in 1875, some account of Sanchi is given (pp. 505-526), with several curious curiosities, but the information was drawn entirely\n\n---\n\n1. A more extensive bibliograph of six drawings of the faces of the gateways and of their reliefs were introduced. The originals must have been in a larger scale, and might have proved valuable, but they cannot now be seen. The account of Sanchi in Mr. Fergusson's History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, Vol. II, pp. 39-42, 89, 105, was based on the preceding work.\n\n2. See H. H. Cole's Report on Conservation, app., p. xcv.\n\n3. See also J. H. Prinsep, \"India and Rajahs,\" 1868; and also \"Sanchi: Its History, Art, and Orientalists\" (Stockholm, 1889).\nfrom Cunningham's early volume, and added nothing to our knowledge.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1880 the spread of vegetation about the st\u016bpa had increased greatly, and had begun to do considerable damage to the rails; the opening made by the excavations in 1822 and 1851 was quite overgrown by creepers, and their roots were forcing out the masonry of the dome. The railing on the south side had completely fallen, and natives had been mutilating the sculptures on the east gateway, and had cut up one of the fallen monoliths, close to it, for grindstones! This vandalism Major H. H. Cole proposed to stop by the appointment of \"a trustworthy watchman to be always on the spot in order to prevent such wilful damage,\" remarking that \"it is worth the wages of three or four native custodians to ensure that damage goes no further.\"\u00b9 This sensible recommendation was formally attended to and a chapr\u0101si appointed; but Professor E. Washbourn Hopkins, on two visits to S\u0101nchi in 1897\u201398, found the boys of the neighbourhood amusing themselves by throwing stones at particular figures, and no one appeared to forbid them. The chapr\u0101si lives in the village below and seems ineffective: loose sculptures disappear without his interference or report.\n\nThe overgrowth of vegetation was destroyed in 1881, and the breach in the great dome filled in, whilst in 1882\u201383 the fallen gateways on the west and south were set up and stayed to the dome by iron rods;\u00b2 the fallen portion of the railing was also set up, and the small gateway that had belonged to the third st\u016bpa was restored by the replacement of its second and third architraves. This most important service for the preservation of the monuments was carried out by the Government of India at an expenditure of 17,400 rupees. It is to be regretted that some attempt to preserve the second st\u016bpa also was not made at the same time.\n\nWhen the repairs were finished a series of photographs of\n\n\u00b9 Major Cole's Report for 1881\u201382, app., p. clxi.\n\u00b2 These appear in the photographs published by Major Cole and Sir Lepel Griffin, but seem to have been removed since 1889.\nthe gateways was taken and printed in heliogravure in or of the fasciculi of Major Cole's Preservation of Nation Monuments in India. Another series of twenty-seven plates taken about the same time, was printed in Sir Lepel Griffin Famous Monuments of Central India, 1886. Major Cole letterpress is of the most meagre sort, and Sir Lepel Griffin text is intended only for the general reader, and drawn from previous accounts. Both series of photographs are excellent and reproduced in the best style, but while well suited to give a clear idea of the richness of the sculpture, they are necessarily on too small a scale for detailed study.\n\nIn a hurried visit to Sanchi early in 1889, the writer collected impressions of a considerable number of the inscriptions, and next year, and again in March, 1893, Dr. F\u00fchrer copied a still larger number; these were submitted to the late Professor G. B\u00fchler, who discussed and translated the whole collection in the Epigraphia Indica (vol. ii, pp. 87\u201311 and 360\u2013408). They number 456, besides fragments, and about 200 more than were published by General Cunningham. They are almost exclusively donative\u2014containing only the names of the donors, with that of their town and occasionally of their parents, brothers, etc.\u2014so that we can only judge of their age by the style of alphabet. One on the south gateway, however, bears the name of R\u0101\u00f1\u00f1o Siri \u015a\u0101tak\u0101\u1e47i, in whose reign the upper architrave was presented by \u0100nanda the son of V\u0101sin\u1e6dha. This \u015ari \u015a\u0101tak\u0101\u1e47i was one of the Andhra kings, and as the alphabet of this and other epigraphs on the gateway differs but slightly from the type of the characters in the Asoka inscriptions, this king must be one of the earlier members of his dynasty, whose date would fall about the middle of the second century B.C. or soon after. This gives us the approximate date of one\n\n---\n\n1 Great Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi (1885), 11 plates: eight of the plates are reproduced in India: Photographs and Drawings of Historical Building (Delhi, 1896), plates 41\u201348, and six in Ancient Monuments, etc., of India, pt. (1897), among plates xxxv to liii, illustrative of Sanchi.\n\n2 In the India Office there are 75 negatives of photographs from Sanchi. They form part of a collection of over 3,000, representing Indian antiquities of which prints can be procured.\n\n3 Buddhist Art in India, p. 25; Epigraphia Indica, vol. ii, p. 88.\ngateway, and if they were erected successively, this one, leading to the steps by which the berm is ascended, would naturally be the oldest; the north gateway would follow next, and lastly those on the east and west. That on the west, with its peculiar dwarf capitals, would seem the latest, and might be followed by the torana to the third st\u016bpa.\n\nThe inscriptions give the old name of the place as K\u0101kan\u0101da (P\u0101li, K\u0101kan\u0101va); and S\u0101nchi does not appear in any form, and must be a modern designation. We learn also from literary records that this place or a town in the immediate neighbourhood was known as Chetiyagiri: and if this were the same as Vessanagara, the modern Besnagar, then it was about six miles to the north-east of K\u0101kan\u0101da. It was there that A\u015boka is said to have married the daughter of a local sett\u012bhi and had by her two sons, Ujjeniya and Mahinda, and a daughter, Sanghamitt\u0101. If Chetiyagiri were the name for the hill in use before A\u015boka\u2019s time, and not merely at the later date when the chronicler wrote, in the fifth century A.D., then we might infer that the St\u016bpa or Chaitya was already in existence before the accession of A\u015boka; but for this we have no proof. But on the north and south there stood two l\u0101ts with lion capitals; and on a fragment of the south one is part of an inscription\u2014apparently of an edict of A\u015boka\u2014from which it may reasonably be inferred that the great st\u016bpa belongs to about his time or 250 B.C. The erection of the rail would follow very soon after, and the gateways or toranas would come next.\n\nAmong the new inscriptions found in 1893, was an Indo-Skythian one on the base of a statue of Buddha, recording its dedication during the reign of the king\n\n---\n\n1 Fergusson: *Tree and Serpent Worship*, p. 101.\n2 *Epigr. Ind.*, vol. ii, p. 366; Fleet, *Corp. Inscrip. Ind.*, vol. iii, p. 31. In Cunningham, *Bhilsa Topes*, pp. 241, 288, 347, K\u0101kan\u0101va has been mistaken for a personal name.\n3 Buddhaghosa (*cir.* 420 A.D.) calls the place Wessanagara, and the *Mah\u0101vanso* (*cir.* 470 A.D.) has Chetiyagiri: Turnour, *Mah\u0101vanso*, p. 76. V. Smith, in his *A\u015boka*, p. 163, gives Vedisagiri instead of Chetiyagiri.\n4 *Epigr. Ind.*, vol. ii, p. 367.\nSh\u0101hi V\u0101sushka in the year 78 [A.D. 156?]. On the other statues were found the Buddhist creed in letters of the eighth or ninth century A.D. and fragments of verse in rather later characters. Two Gupta inscriptions of 41 and 450 A.D. have been translated by Dr. J. F. Fleet and the larger temple close by must belong also to the fifth century A.D., proving that the place was one of religious note probably as long as the Buddhist religion held an influence in Central India\u2014certainly till the tenth century or later.\n\nThe next publication on S\u0101\u00f1chi was that of General Maiss in 1892, who issued his drawings anew, in forty quarto plates with letterpress, the aim of which was to prove the Buddhism did not originate till about the Christian era, and that the Piyad\u012bsi of the inscriptions was not A\u015boka nor a follower of Buddhism. This theory is quite out of date and most of the drawings had been produced in a better style in Tree and Serpent Worship.\n\nPublished as a handbook to the Indian collection of antiquities in the Berlin Royal Museum, in 1893, Professor Albert Gr\u00fcnwedel's *Buddhistische Kunst in Indien* is of some importance here. The second chapter (transl., pp. 24\u201374) deals chiefly with the east of the eastern gateway at S\u0101\u00f1ch\u012b made in 1800. By showing the relative positions of the reliefs, this cast made it easier to render satisfactory explanations of a number of the subjects represented on the gateway; and Professor Gr\u00fcnwedel's observations on these may be helpful in guiding further attempts to unravel the stories on the others, when the whole of the sculptures in their relative positions are before the student.\n\nFor this purpose it was suggested to the Government of India that the whole of the S\u0101\u00f1chi reliefs might be photographed to a fixed scale suitable for their satisfactory study and if all were done to one scale, it would be possible to build...\nup the entire elevations from the photographs and mount them on sheets. The suggestion was at once generously approved and sanctioned, and Mr. Henry Cousens, of the Bombay Archaeological Survey, was instructed to carry it into effect. By an ingenious contrivance for moving the camera to various heights, on a framework formed by two vertical graduated poles, the whole of which could be readily moved horizontally across the front of the gateways, he succeeded in taking a series of negatives to a scale of one-eighth of the originals, or as nearly so as is readily practicable for such structures. The arrangement devised for this photographic work is represented in the accompanying illustration. The famine of last year hampered his operations from want of water, etc., and limited his time, but 200 negatives were secured.\n\nThe whole five toranas or gateways are in this series represented on about 150 plates, of which, besides the\ngeneral views, a considerable proportion are on plates 12 by 14 inches, and the rest on smaller ones. There besides many fine negatives of surrounding remains of ancient structures, etc., and these last are of much interest illustrating the various styles of art prevailing in the later ages, while the statues were still objects of religious interest. A comparison of these fragments, as well as of the sculptures in the museums with the Gandhara, Amaravati, Nasirabad, and other remains, will be of interest in illustrating the history of art and Buddhist iconography in India.\n\nIllustration of the photographs: It may be mentioned that most of the central gateway are pieced together from several negatives that form a representation or picture measuring 37 inches high by 50 inches across. And although they would be useful for lectures or museum purposes, they are perhaps more convenient for private study.\n\nAmong Illustrations from among the smaller photographs and show the superiority of these over the best drawings. The accompanying plate represents the 5th and 6th sections of the right-hand pillar of the east gateway; the drawing is from Col. Malleson, but compared with even his excellent work, it will be seen at once how superior the details are, how much better the human faces are depicted. In addition, these terraces represent the heavens, the gods of the gods. We observe that the central figure in the lower section holds in his right hand, a rajju or double-headed club which may indicate Indra.\n\nTo make these photographs available for study, however, some means of reproduction is essential. Illustration is now so easy as compared with what it was even a short time ago; it is not too much perhaps to expect that the most important series of representations of the ancient Indian monuments of Indian art that we possess may be published in a satisfactory form, as an important contribution to Indian arch\u00e6ology.\n\nIndian Art in India travel, p. 38.\nFIFTH AND SIXTH PANELS\nON RIGHT-HAND JAMB OF THE EAST GATEWAY,\nS\u0100NCHI ST\u016aPA.\nAfter S\u0101\u00f1chi we should also remember that the Buddhist caves at Kanheri, Elur\u0101, Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Udayagiri, and elsewhere contain a wealth of sculpture illustrative of the development of their mythology and art, that, if fully delineated and published, would supply much insight and information on the growth and history of the Buddhist mythology and religion.\nART. III.\u2014Vr\u0101cada and Sindhi. By G. A. Grierson, C.I.E., I.C.S.\n\nThe Vr\u0101cada Apabhrans\u0101 form of Prakrit was spoken in Sindh.\u00b9 We know very little about it, except that amongst its peculiarities were (1) the optional change of initial ta and da to \u1e6da and \u1e0da respectively; (2) the change of sa and na to \u1e63a; and (3) the prefixing of y to c and j.\n\nWith respect to (1) compare the frequent change of initial t to \u1e6d in Sindhi, as in \u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101m\u014d = Sanskrit t\u0101mraka\u1e25 \u2018copper,\u2019 and of initial d to \u1e0d\u1e0d, as in \u1e0d\u1e0dan\u1e0du = Sanskrit dandah.\n\nWith respect to (2) compare Sindhi ri\u015bu \u2018world\u2019 = Skr. ri\u1e63aya, and \u015bi\u1e25u = Skr. \u015bi\u1e41ha. This change is very common in Sindhi.\n\nWith respect to (3) I can find no corresponding form in Sindhi, unless we can quote the special Sindhi sounds which are usually represented in transliteration by gg, jj, \u1e0d\u1e0d, and bb. These are, as the transliteration shows, originally double letters. The Vr\u0101cada yj may be the origin of the Sindhi jj, and the other Sindhi letters may be the result of similar combinations not mentioned by the Prakrit grammarians, or not preserved in the MSS. which have come down to us. I know, however, of nothing in Sindhi which corresponds to the Vr\u0101cada yc. There is another possible explanation which I shall note a little lower down.\n\nThe intimate connection which exists between the modern languages of the north-west of India (including Sindhi) and those of the east (from Bih\u0101r to Assam) is well known. The Vr\u0101cada optional change of dental consonants to cerebrals really means that there was no sharp distinction in pronunciation between these two classes of sounds. Most\n\n\u00b9 See Pischel\u2019s Prakrit Grammar, p. 29.\nprobably both were pronounced as semi-cerebrals, as in English. This is the case at the present day in Eastern India. The dental letter \\( r \\) is continually confounded with the cerebral \\( d \\), and in Assam there is practically no distinction between dentals and cerebrals. All are semi-cerebrals. In Assam this is almost certainly due to the influence of Indo-Chinese languages. Can we assume that the same was the case with Vr\u0101cada?\n\nThe Vr\u0101cada change of \\( s \\) and \\( s \\) to \\( \u015b \\) is, as is well known also typical of the M\u0101gadhi Prakrit of Eastern India, just as at the present day it is typical of Sindhi and Bengali.\n\nIn M\u0101gadhi Prakrit every \\( ja \\) takes a sound which most native grammarians denote by \\( ya \\), and one or two by \\( yja \\). As Hoernle has long ago pointed out, it was really an obscure sound, intermediate between \\( ya \\) and \\( ja \\), and doing duty for both. This obscure sound has survived in words like \\( majh \\), 'a buffalo-cow,' in the Lahnd\u0101 of the Western Panjab, which is closely connected with Sindhi. The pronunciation of \\( majh \\) is described by Beames as \"something very odd. It might be represented by \\( megh \\), a very palatal \\( y \\) aspirated; perhaps in German by \\( m\u00f6ch \\), or rather, if it may be so expressed, with a medial sound corresponding to the tenuis \\( ch \\).\" Hoernle compares the sound to that given to \\( g \\) in the word \\( teendug \\) in the Rhenish Provinces.\n\nIn Magadhi, as in Vr\u0101cada, one native grammarian says that \\( go \\) becomes \\( yga \\), so that, here again, the correspondence between east and west is clear. What sound was intended to be represented by \\( yga \\) is not very evident, though we can gain some idea as to what was meant from the above remarks about \\( go \\) and \\( yga \\). Under any circumstances, a consideration of these remarks will suggest an alternative explanation of the Vr\u0101cada sounds. Possibly both explanations are correct, and the sound which Prakrit grammarians represented by \\( yga \\) has developed in M\u0101gadhi and Lahnd\u0101 into a semi-consonantal \\( sa \\), and in Sindhi into \\( jha \\).\n\n[Signature]\n[Date: 10, 1901]\nArt. IV.\u2014Description of Persia and Mesopotamia in the year 1340 A.D. from the Nuzhat-al-Kulub of Hamd-Allah Mustawfi, with a summary of the contents of that work. By G. Le Strange.\n\nIt is very generally a matter of complaint that the lithographed editions of Persian and Arabic works published in the East are, for the most part, unprovided with any index or full table of contents; and, further, that when the book treats of geography or history, the proper names of both persons and places are too often given in a manner that at first sight defies identification. Half a loaf, however, is proverbially better than no bread, and, until from some quarter funds are forthcoming to defray the cost of printing Persian texts in Europe, scholars would often be able to make use of the editions lithographed in India or elsewhere, if the true reading of the proper names were fixed by a collation of the best manuscripts, and if a full table of contents were available for purposes of reference. In many cases also a Persian work will only contain one part, or a series of chapters, that pre-eminently is of interest to Western scholars: and the remark, of course, applies more especially to the Cosmographies where the geographical chapters alone are of first-rate importance, as also to those numerous Universal Histories where only the concluding sections, dealing with the author's own time, can in any way be considered as of primary authority. An instance in point is, I consider, the cosmographical work of Hamd-Allah Mustawfi, which forms the subject of the present article, and of which a lithographed edition appeared in Bombay in 1894 (A.H. 1311) under the editorship of Mirz\u0101 Mahdi Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b, being published by Mirz\u0101 Muhammad Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b, surnamed Malik-al-Kutt\u0101b, or the Chief of the Scriveners.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nHamd-Allah Mustawfi and his two principal works\u2014the history called the *T\u0101rikh-i-Gus\u012bdah*, and the *Nuzhat-al-Kul\u016bb* which last is now under discussion\u2014were fully noticed by Mr. E. G. Browne in this Journal in a paper on \"The Sources of Dawlatsh\u0101h\" (J.R.A.S. for January, 1899), and more recently (October, 1900) he has given us a translation of the section on the \"Biographies of the Persian Poets\" from the *Gus\u012bdah*, with a detailed account of the content of that historical work, of which he hopes later on to publish an edition of the Persian text. As a complement and commentary to the *Gus\u012bdah*, the geographical part of the *Nuzhat-al-Kul\u016bb* is of considerable importance. Further and from the point of view of historical geography, it is of special interest, since it gives us a detailed description of Persia in the age immediately succeeding that of the travels of Marco Polo. The first half of the fourteenth century A.D. may indeed be regarded as a turning-point in the history of Western Asia, being a period of comparative calm coming between the epoch-marking conquests of the Mongols under Changhiz Kh\u0101n and the no less revolutionary period of conquest by Timur. From a geographical point of view it was a time of transition. Before this we have the lands of Isl\u0101m under the Abbasid Caliphs, as described by the Arab geographers I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri, Ibn \u1e24awkal, and Mu\u1e33addasi; after this there is Western Asia, as shown on our present maps, which last may be held to date from the changes effected by the conquests of Timur and the subsequent partition of his empire among his descendants and successors.\n\nNearly forty years ago Monsieur Barbier de Meynard (now director of the \u00c9cole des Langues Orientales Vivantes in Paris) gave us the translation of the greater part of the geographical section of the *Nuzhat-al-Kul\u016bb* in the notes to his well-known *Dictionnaire de la Perse*,\u00b9 which is based on the geographical encyclop\u00e6dia of Y\u0101k\u016bt. To the information contained in this book I must express my great indebtedness, and I may take the occasion of bearing witness to the\n\n\u00b9 Small 4to. Paris, Imprimerie Imp\u00e9riale, 1861.\nadmirable accuracy of Monsieur B. de Meynard's work, which, it should be remembered, had to be entirely based on manuscript material, being translated directly from the Paris MSS. of the *Mu'jam-al-Buld\u0101n*. Since 1861 the whole text of Y\u0101k\u016bt has been edited by Professor W\u00fcstenfeld; also, in his *Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum*, Professor de Goeje has now given us admirable editions of nearly all the earlier Arab geographers: it is therefore very easy to verify, by a reference to the texts, the translations given by Monsieur B. de Meynard; and it will be remembered that the *Dictionnaire de la Perse* is still the only portion of Y\u0101k\u016bt's great Encyclop\u00e6dia of which a complete translation exists in any European language. Seeing, therefore, that we have here a translation of all the longer articles in the *Nuzhat* which treat of the towns described by \u1e24amd-Allah, I shall only attempt in this paper to complete his lists of names, referring my readers to the pages of the *Dictionnaire de la Perse* for all further information in detail. My arrangement of the materials will, however, be somewhat different, for the *Dictionnaire de la Perse* being set in alphabetical order, no account is taken of the enumeration of the places as grouped by \u1e24amd-Allah under the various provinces, and this arrangement, for the elucidation of the historical geography of the period, is, I deem, of much importance. Then, again, Monsieur B. de Meynard, as he acknowledges in his preface,\u00b9 has made no attempt to identify the sites of places mentioned by \u1e24amd-Allah, as, indeed, this was inevitable forty years ago, for our maps of Persia were then in many parts a blank. Since that time, however, a host of travellers and explorers have filled in the names, and at the present day most part of the great plateau of \u012ar\u0101n has been explored. I need only mention the numerous excellent maps published by General Houtum.\n\n\u00b9 Op. cit., Pr\u00e9face, p. xx: \"Les questions si d\u00e9licates de topographie ancienne ne peuvent \u00eatre abord\u00e9es avec s\u00fbret\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9tude pr\u00e9alable des documents indig\u00e8nes. J'esp\u00e8re qu'il me sera donn\u00e9 un jour de travailler \u00e0 la solution de ce difficile probl\u00e8me, au moins, en ce qui touche la Perse : aujourd'hui je l'ai \u00e9cart\u00e9 de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\"\nSchindler in the Berlin *Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Erdkunde*, and the maps given by Monsieur J. de Morgan in his *Mission Scientifique en Perse*\u2014which last is still in course of publication\u2014as instances of completed surveys of the individual provinces under investigation; while in the numerous papers devoted to Persia contained in recent volumes of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society I have found much to aid me in the identification of ancient with modern sites. My mainstay, however, has been the great Map of Persia, in six sheets, on the scale of sixteen miles to the inch, published by the War Office Intelligence Department in 1886.\n\nFor the true spelling of the place-names I have had recourse to the systematic Itineraries given by Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih and Kud\u0101mah, supplemented by the detail of routes found in the works of Ya\u02bf\u1e33\u016bb\u012b, Ibru Rustah, I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri, Ibn \u1e24awqal, and Mukaddas\u012b, all of which date from the middle of the third to the last quarter of the fourth century A.H. (ninth and tenth centuries A.D.). These medi\u00e6val Arab Road-books have enabled me to correct, and hence profit by, the very full Itinerary which Hamd-Allah himself gives at the close of his description of \u012ar\u0101n. This Persian Itinerary is now published for the first time, and it has made the location of a number of medi\u00e6val towns and districts possible, all traces of which have long since disappeared from the modern map. As an instance I may mention the Mint-city of S\u0101b\u016brkhw\u0101st in Lurist\u0101n, which Hamd-Allah shows to be not the modern Khurram\u0101b\u0101d, as has often been supposed; then some important details are given about Sirj\u0101n, the capital of Kirm\u0101n, and about Old Hurmuz; and we are now enabled to fix approximately by these Persian Itineraries the positions of many lost towns such as T\u0101lik\u0101n and Fary\u0101b of south-eastern Khur\u0101s\u0101n; also K\u0101ghaz-Kun\u0101n and Bajarv\u0101n,\n\n---\n\n1 The spelling of Persian place-names is far from being consistent. The Persian for 'village,' now written and pronounced D\u012bh (vowel short), is generally in the MSS. written D\u012bh, with the vowel long. Other common variations are I\u1e63fah\u0101n or Isfah\u0101n, H\u016brm\u016bz or Hurmuz, T\u012bhr\u0101n or T\u012bhr\u0101n, K\u016bhist\u0101n or K\u016bhist\u0101n.\nonce important cities on the great northern high road from Adharbayj\u0101n towards the Caucasus frontier, besides many villages and post-stations.\n\nOn the vexed question of the lower course of the Oxus during the middle ages, and its outflow into the Caspian, \u1e24amd-Allah has important information to give. The detailed account of the provinces into which Persia in his day was divided shows, by a comparison with the provincial frontiers as given by the Arab geographers of Abbasid times, the changes effected by the Mongol conquest, and the later administration of the \u012al-Kh\u0101ns, who built Sult\u0101n\u012byah in Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k to be their capital, and to take the place of Baghd\u0101d as the Metropolis of Western Asia\u2014Mesopotamia being henceforth counted as merely a province of Persia. The most notable change in the political map of \u012ar\u0101n is the formation of the new province of Kurdist\u0101n, which was taken from the western half of the Arab province of Jib\u0101l (Media), the remaining, or eastern, portion of the older Jib\u0101l province now coming to be more generally known as Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k. Then, again, all the Yazd district, which had formerly been counted as of F\u0101rs, was now given to Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k, thus, in compensation for Kurdist\u0101n, which had been taken away, enlarging the older frontier of the Jib\u0101l to the eastward, and so rounding off what was now the central province of \u012ar\u0101n under the administration of the \u012al-Kh\u0101ns. Lastly, on the Persian Gulf region, \u1e24amd-Allah divides off Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah from the south-eastern part of F\u0101rs, making of Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah a separate province, of which the ancient D\u0101r\u0101bjird and L\u0101r (a town unknown to the earlier geographers) were the chief centres of population.\n\n\u1e24amd-Allah personally was well fitted thus to describe \u012ar\u0101n, for there is evidence that he had himself travelled over the greater part of the country. In the matter of frontiers and capital cities he was trained in office-work connected with the taxation of the provinces, being one who held by inheritance the post of Mustawfi or Accountant-general, this post having been in his family since the days of his great-grandfather, who was superintendent of the\nfinances of 'Ir\u0101\u1e33 in Abbasid times, before the first Mongol invasion. \u1e24amd-Allah himself had served under Rashid-ad-D\u012bn (the author of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b, published in part by E. Quatrem\u00e8re), the celebrated minister of Gh\u0101z\u0101n Kh\u0101n, and the present description of Persia and Mesopotamia, though completed in 740 (1340 A.D.), may be taken to represent the country as it existed under the government of that \u012al-Kh\u0101n and his successors Uljayt\u016b and Abu-Sa'id (brother and nephew of Gh\u0101z\u0101n) in whose service \u1e24amd-Allah held the office of Mustawfi.\n\nAt the head of most of the chapters describing each province of the \u012alkh\u0101nid empire in Persia and Mesopotamia \u1e24amd-Allah has given the sum of the provincial revenue paid in his own time. These figures may be best summarized in a note,\u00b9 and they are of interest as showing the financial condition of Persia under the \u012al-Kh\u0101ns. It must, however, be observed that Mustawfi very frequently also gives, under the separate articles, the state-revenues derived from the towns; hence the sums given in our footnote probably should not be held to represent the sum-total of the provincial taxes, for, while it is nowhere clearly stated whether or not these individual sums formed part of the aggregate, the revenues of all the chief towns are not given. From the point of view of Numismatics an interest lies in the statement repeated many times by Mustawfi (L. 133d, 170j, etc.) that in his day the currency-dinar (Din\u0101r-i-Raij), which was used in all accounts, a gold coin that possibly was only nominal (or but seldom coined), was reckoned to be worth six (silver) dirhams of the Abbasids;\n\n\u00b9 Reckoned in currency-dinars (four of these being about equivalent to the pound sterling), and in the year 35 of the \u012alkh\u0101ni Era (A.D. 1335), Arabian 'Ir\u0101\u1e33 paid 3,000,000 dinars; R\u016bm (Asia Minor), 3,300,000; Armenia, 390,000; Upper Mesopotamia, 1\u00bd million dinars; Kurdist\u0101n, 201,500; Kh\u016bzist\u0101n, 325,000; F\u0101rs, 2,871,200; Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah, 266,100; and Kirm\u0101n, 676,500 dinars. The list of provinces, it will be observed, is not complete. Mustawfi further, in many cases, records the revenues of former periods, notably for Saljuk times during the later centuries of the Abbasid Caliphate, but these seem hardly worth tabulating, for the sums mentioned are not likely to be very reliable.\nhence, as already said in our footnote, four of these currency-din\u0101rs were about equal in value to one pound sterling.\n\nThe present paper, it will be seen, only attempts the summary of Part II in the Third Book of the *Nuzhat*, and of this all that is now here given is the corrected list of the names of places, with the reference to the pages of the lithographed edition, and to the authority responsible for the true reading of the name. An attempt also has been made in every case to identify the site, or the fact is stated when the position is unknown.\n\nThe text as found in the Bombay Lithograph has been edited with almost incredible carelessness. The place-names heading each article are written indifferently with or without diacritical points, hence very often these names are perfectly illegible. Towns of a somewhat similar name in the written character, but quite well known, and, in point of fact, occupying different provinces\u2014such, for example, as *Ardabil* in Adharbayj\u0101n and *Irbil* in Upper Mesopotamia\u2014are as a rule here systematically confounded one with the other, and a place like Tawwaj, the celebrated commercial emporium of F\u0101rs in the earlier middle ages, appears in the Bombay text as N\u016b\u1e25, that is to say, Noah. Similarly absurd mistakes recur again and again, as, for instance, where our author, speaking of the rivers of Persia (which for the most part do not find their exit to the sea), describes each in turn as \"flowing out or becoming lost in the Desert (*Maf\u0101zah*)\", for which the Bombay edition invariably has the statement that the river becomes \"lost in a cave (*Magh\u0101rah*)\", the excuse for which nonsense being that in the Arabic character there is a similarity between *Magh\u0101rah* and *Maf\u0101zah* by a change of diacritical points.\n\nFor obtaining a correct text, I have collated (more or less completely) eight of the best MSS. found in the British Museum, also the six MSS. of the Bodleian at Oxford, and two MSS. belonging to the University Library at Cambridge. For Chapter 12, describing the province of F\u0101rs, I have been able to get the true readings for a number of place-names, not given by Istakhri or the other Arab geographers,\nby collating the MS. of the *F\u0101rs N\u0101mah* recently acquired by the British Museum. This is a Persian work on history and geography written in the first years of the sixth century A.H. (the twelfth A.D.) by a certain Ibn-al-Balkh who flourished at the court of the Salj\u016bk Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad surnamed Ghiy\u0101th-ad-D\u012bn, son of Malik Sh\u0101h; the exact date of the writing of the *F\u0101rs N\u0101mah* does not appear to be mentioned in the MS., but the writer's patron (whom he mentions as still reigning) succeeded in 498 (1104 A.D.), and ruled till 511 (A.D. 1117), which fixes the period within narrow limits.\n\nI have also made use of another unique MS. which the British Museum possesses, namely, the unnamed geography which is attributed to \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Abr\u016b, the Secretary of Timur. This work, which was written in 820 A.H. (1417 A.D.), copies a good deal from the *Nuzhat*, but adds at times geographical details not given by \u1e24amd-Allah. For instance, there are in this work some important passages which throw light on the vexed question of the course taken by the Oxus during the middle ages (these will be given in the notes to Chapter 17 on Khur\u0101s\u0101n); and it is worthy of remark that \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Abr\u016b himself appears to have travelled far and wide through the broad empire of Timur, so that much of his information is that of an eye-witness, and comes to us at first-hand.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The British Museum MS. of the *F\u0101rs N\u0101mah* is that numbered Or. 5,983; the work by \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Abr\u016b is that numbered Or. 1,577; and this last is described in vol. i, p. 421, of the *Catalogue of the Persian Manuscripts in the British Museum*, by Dr. Rieu. The British Museum MSS. of the *Nuzhat* that I have used are those numbered Add. 7,708, 7,709, 7,710, 16,735, 16,736, 16,737, 23,543, and 23,544 (cf. op. cit., p. 418). The Oxford MSS. are those numbered 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, and 411 in the *Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts* edited by Messrs. Eth\u00e9 and Sachau. The two Cambridge MSS. are those given under the numbers Add. 2,624 and 3,146; these are described on pp. 201, 202 of the Cambridge Persian Catalogue written by Mr. E. G. Browne. The two Cambridge MSS. I had the very great convenience of collating at my London lodgings in June and July, 1900, for, with exceptional generosity, the authorities of that University consented to grant these MSS. to me on loan, Mr. E. G. Browne giving security for their safe return. I must take this occasion of rendering him my thanks for this friendly action in my behalf; to the Vice-Chancellor, and to Mr. Jenkinson, the Librarian of the University Library, also I feel very deeply indebted for the loan. For the *F\u0101rs N\u0101mah* MS. I must express my thanks to Mr. A. G. Ellis, of the British Museum, who drew my attention to this new acquisition.\nThe Zafar N\u0101mah, describing the campaigns of Timur, written by \u2018Ali of Yazd (and translated at the beginning of the last century into French by Petis de la Croix), has been of use in identifying some of the place-names given in the Nuzhat, and often the position of places is roughly indicated by a reference to the marches of Timur, and this enables us to identify the sites of lost towns. A work which also seemed to promise much help is the well-known geography called the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, compiled by the great bibliographer H\u0101j\u012b Khalfah in Turkish at the beginning of the seventeenth century A.D. H\u0101j\u012b Khalfah repeatedly quotes the Nuzhat, and, as he evidently had excellent MSS. to work from, his readings of the place-names are valuable. Unfortunately, however, like all Oriental writers he is entirely uncritical. In the eastern regions, which lie beyond his personal ken, he inserts descriptions of Sirj\u0101n (in Kirm\u0101n), Zaranj (in S\u012bst\u0101n), and Arraj\u0101n (in F\u0101rs), as though all these cities still existed in his day, when we know from history that, as a fact, the two former towns were destroyed by Timur, while Arraj\u0101n even before the time of Timur had been replaced by Bihbah\u0101n, which is the present existing town, of which place, however, H\u0101j\u012b Khalfah makes absolutely no mention. Then, again, with no mark of the borrowing, H\u0101j\u012b Khalfah frequently makes mention of towns, giving the sums of revenue due from each (e.g. Salam and \u2018Ayn in Armenia); but in most cases these appear to be simply paragraphs taken over bodily from the Nuzhat, and the sums for the taxes are those already given by Mustawfi, writing under the \u012alkh\u0101nid administration three centuries before the time when the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 was compiled.\n\nIn quoting the spelling of names, the references are to the edition of the Persian text of the Zafar N\u0101mah published in the series of the Bibliotheca Indica (Calcutta, 1887). The French translation, called Histoire de Timur-Bee, was printed in four volumes 12mo, Paris, 1722.\n\nThe Turkish text of the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (to which my quotations refer) was printed in Constantinople A.H. 1145 (1732) by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Efendi, and a Latin translation of this work was made by M. Norberg, and published in 1818 at Londini Gothorum (Lund), in two volumes; but the place-names in this translation are not, as a rule, spelt correctly.\nIn conclusion of these preliminary notes, I may remark that for the true reading of the place-names I have relied far more on the authority of Y\u0101k\u016bt, supplemented by the older Arab geographers (the texts, namely, in the eight volumes of the Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum of De Goeje) and our present maps, than on the readings in the diverse MSS. of the Nuzhat, which last are often incredibly incorrect, from the carelessness of the scribes. Where the modern map and the Arab geographers together fail us (e.g. in some sections of the Itineraries), the spelling of the place-names becomes quite uncertain, and the diverse readings often equal in number that of the manuscripts consulted, each scribe having added diacritical points and letters according to fancy. The Persians are, indeed, far behind the Arab scribes in matter of accuracy in copying their texts; and, curiously enough, where a criterion has existed for settling the true reading, I have often found that the older MSS. of the Nuzhat were quite as incorrectly written as the more modern copies of the work.\n\nI have been unable to include in the following pages the names of all the villages given by Mustawfi in his lists; indeed, as a general rule, those names only are inserted which either occur in the works of the Arab geographers, or are found still to exist on our modern maps, or, finally, are inserted in the Itinerary. An exhaustive collating of all the MSS. would be required for fixing the readings of the outstanding names in Mustawfi's lists of sub-districts and villages; and even then accuracy would probably be unattainable, until the topography of Persia becomes more accurately and completely known. In the following pages, however, all the separate articles, whether of towns or districts, given by Mustawfi have been inserted, and the attempt is in every case made to identify the places mentioned; or, when the present maps and the Arab geographers alike are at fault, and no clear indication of the site is attainable, some indication is given of the region in which the place or its ruins should be sought for.\n\nBefore proceeding to a detailed examination of that section\nof the *Nuzhat* which especially deals with the \u012alkh\u0101nid kingdom of \u012ar\u0101n (Persia with Mesopotamia), it will be convenient to give first the general Table of Contents of the book, premising that the *Nuzhat-al-\u1e32ul\u016bb* is a cosmographical work, of which a part only treats of geography, and that it is divided into five sections, namely, an *Introduction*, *Three Books*, and a *Conclusion*, these sections being in many cases further subdivided into Chapters and various Appendixes or sub-sections.\\(^1\\)\n\n**INTRODUCTION** (called *F\u0101tihah* or *Mukaddamah*): treating of the Spheres, the Heavenly Bodies, and the Elements, followed by a description of the inhabited Quarters of the Earth, with an explanation of Latitude and Longitude, and the division into Climates, L. 8h.\n\n**FIRST BOOK** (*Mak\u0101lah-i-Awval*): describing the Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal Kingdoms, L. inset 21z.\n\n**SECOND BOOK**: Man, his nature, faculties, and qualities, L. 49a.\n\n**THIRD BOOK**, divided into four Parts (*Kism*).\n\n**Part I**: Mecca, Medina, and the Mosque of Jerusalem, L. 116o.\n\n**Part II**: The Lands of \u012ar\u0101n, divided into twenty Chapters (*B\u0101b*)\\(^2\\) and five Appendices (*Makhlas* or *Fas\u012bl*).\n\nCh. 1, \u2018\u012ar\u0101\u1e33 \u2018Arab, 132p.* Ch. 2, \u2018\u012ar\u0101\u1e33 \u2018Ajam, 141v.*\nCh. 3, Adharbayj\u0101n, 153m.* Ch. 4, Mugh\u0101n and Arr\u0101n, 159u.*\nCh. 5, Sh\u012brv\u0101n, 160x.* Ch. 6, Gurjist\u0101n,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The references (for distinction, where any ambiguity may occur, more especially marked L.) are to the lithographed edition, already indicated, of the *Nuzhat*. This contains in all 372 pages of text, which, for some unexplained reason, are not numbered consecutively. The pagination runs from pp. 1 to 48, this being followed by an inset of pp. 1 to 112, after which comes p. 49, thence running on continuously to the close of the work, which is numbered p. 260. Each page contains twenty-five lines of text, which for convenience I refer to under the letters of the alphabet; thus 132z and 133a indicate the last line and the first line of the text on these two pages respectively.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Persian text of the chapters marked * has been printed by C. Schefer in his *Suppl\u00e9ment au Siasset Nameh*, Paris, 1897, pp. 141\u2013230. Of those marked \u2020 the text is given by B.

Colophon, 260.\n\nReverting now to Part II of the Third Book, On the Lands of \u012ar\u0101n\u2014the subject of the present paper\u2014the detailed contents of the twenty chapters into which this is divided are succinctly discussed in the following pages. And here, for the sake of convenience, I have added to each chapter, when treating of the various provinces and towns, those articles which go to form Appendices II, IV, and V, in which Mustawfi describes the Mountains, Rivers, and Lakes of Persia and Mesopotamia, giving of course also a reference to the Nuzhat where the text of the Appendix will be found. Appendix I, on the Itineraries, will be treated in detail at the close of Chapter 20; but in regard to Appendix III, on Mines, being totally unacquainted with mineralogy, and since this section treats only of the places where diverse minerals and metals are to be found, I have thought it wiser to omit this part altogether from my paper.\n\nThe list of names is a long one, and perhaps a few remarks on the nomenclature will not be out of place before proceeding to the description of the various provinces.\n\nIn glancing over the place-names which Mustawfi records it is clear that the Arab element, found in the earlier geographers, had in the fourteenth century A.D. given place\nalmost entirely to Persian forms. The Arabs very usually added the article *al* to place-names which in their language had a meaning, e.g., Al-Anb\u0101r \u2018the Granary,\u2019 Al-\u1e24ad\u012bthah \u2018the New Town,\u2019 and Al-Maw\u1e63il \u2018the Junction\u2019 (Mosul); but in addition it will be found that they frequently wrote their article before purely Persian place-names, e.g. As-S\u012brj\u0101n and Al-I\u1e63\u1e6dahb\u0101n\u0101n, where there was no very obvious reason for so doing. It is impossible to say why Rhages should always have been written with the article *Ar-Ray*, while Jay, the old name for Isfah\u0101n, should have invariably been written without it. In Mustawfi\u2019s lists, however, the Arabic article has everywhere disappeared, and we have Ray, Maw\u1e63il, etc.; while names such as Ar-R\u0101n and Ar-Ras (*spelt* Al-R\u0101n, Al-Ras in the Arabic writing), which in the older geographers had thus the false appearance of Arab names, in the pages of Mustawfi appear in plain Persian as Arr\u0101n and Aras.\n\nGlancing over the map it will thus be found that nearly everywhere the older nomenclature has disappeared: Nay\u1e63\u0101b\u016br is become N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br (in modern Persian the diphthongs *ay* and *au* are as a rule replaced by long *i* and *u*), Kirmi\u0161\u012bn is replaced by Kirm\u0101nsh\u0101h\u0101n, Nashav\u0101 by Nakhchiv\u0101n; and Arabic names are given in their Persian equivalent, Ka\u1e63r-ar-R\u012b\u1e25 \u2018Wind Palace\u2019 becoming Dih B\u0101d, K\u0101riy\u0101t-al-Asad \u2018Lion Village\u2019 and Ka\u1e63r-al-Jawz \u2018Nut Palace\u2019 reappearing as Dih Sh\u012br and Dih Jawz, the meanings standing unchanged. More especially in the province of F\u0101rs it will be found that Kal\u2018ah, signifying a castle in Arabic, is still very generally retained; at times, however, it is replaced by the Persian equivalent Diz, e.g. Kal\u2018ah Isfandiy\u0101r, otherwise called Diz-i-Saf\u012bd \u2018White Castle,\u2019 and in one case the Arabic Kal\u2018ah or Kal\u2018at reappears under the purely Persian form of Kil\u0101t, which as a place-name became common in later times throughout Western Asia. In short, Persia proper in the time of Mustawfi had already got quit of Arabic place-names; one of the few mentioned by him (and the name is still retained) being Bay\u1e0d\u0101 (Arabic *al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101*, \u2018the White Town\u2019) in the\nMarvdasht plain to the north of Shiraz. Of purely Arabic names W\u0101sitah, 'the Middle place,' a post-stage between K\u0101sh\u0101n and Isfah\u0101n, is another example, but the reading of the MSS. is not sure, and in another instance \u1e24add\u0101dah, 'the Frontier or Barrier,' a stage on the great eastern road between Damgh\u0101n and Bust\u0101m, the Arab name is given with its Persian alias of M\u012bhm\u0101n-d\u016bst, and this last is the one still in use. One other instance of an Arabic name in Persia, as given by Mustawfi, occurs in R\u0101s-al-Kalb, 'the Dog's Head,' a stage between Ray and Samn\u0101n. No trace of this name exists at the present time, and apparently its place is occupied by L\u0101sjird, the name of the curious fortress-town (wanting in the lists of the medi\u00e6val geographers) which crowns a bluff overlooking the desert plain (see illustration in H. W. Bellew, From the Indus to the Tigris, p. 404).\n\nChapter 1.

In Abbasid times it is generally given as running up from Anb\u0101r on the Euphrates to Takr\u012bt.\nthe Tigris, both towns being as a rule included in the lower province. In the time of \u1e24amd-Allah, however, \u2018Ir\u0101k included as well many towns lying on the Euphrates to the north of Anb\u0101r, up to or beyond \u2018\u0100nah, and the frontier line at that period went from a short distance below Karkisiya, where the river Kh\u0101b\u016br joins the Euphrates, across Mesopotamia to a point on the Tigris immediately below the junction of the Lesser Z\u0101b. \u1e24amd-Allah in Appendix IV describes both the Euphrates and the Tigris at some length (L. 211u and 213z), but adds nothing to what has been already given in the notes to my translation of Ibn Serapion. The Tigris in his time still flowed down by the Shatt-al-Hay past W\u0101sit into the Great Swamps, which in their western portion swallowed up the waters also of the Euphrates below K\u016bfah; in short, the state of the country described by Ibn Serapion at the close of the ninth century A.D. still existed in 1340, and for that matter continued unaltered until after the time of \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Abr\u016b in 1420, the change to the present state of the Euphrates and Tigris having taken place in the century before 1652 A.D., when Tavernier visited the country.\n\nAmong the cities of \u2018Ir\u0101k, \u1e24amd-Allah being an ardent Shi\u2018ah gives precedence to K\u016bfah (I.S. 53), near the burial-place of the Im\u0101ms, which he calls the D\u0101r-al-Mulk, \u2018the Abode of Power,\u2019 though Baghd\u0101d is, he admits, \u2018the Mother of Cities\u2019 and the metropolis. His description of the celebrated shrines near K\u016bfah is given in the following\n\n---\n\n1 See Map of Mesopotamia as described by Ibn Serapion. In order to save needless repetition the letters I.S. will mark a reference to the volume of this Journal for 1895 where, in the notes to my paper on Ibn Serapion, details of many of the towns here mentioned will be found.\n\n2 See Baghdad during the Caliphate, p. 8, note 1. Since writing this I have found in Purchas' Pilgrims (folio, 1625, vol. v, p. 1411) that in 1581 John Newberie apparently travelled down from Baghdad to Ba\u1e63rah by the present, eastern, course of the Tigris. The change, therefore, from the W\u0101sit channel to that at present followed must have already taken place, in all probability, before the middle of the sixteenth century A.D. Nothing certain is to be learnt from the Narratives of Caesar Frederic in 1563 (Purchas, v, p. 1702), John Eldred in 1583 (Hakluyt Travels, 4to edit., ii, p. 404), or the anonymous Portuguese traveller, circa 1556, whose MS. is in the possession of Major M. Hume (see Athen\u00e6um for 25th March, 1901, p. 373).\nparagraph, which is a slightly condensed translation of the Persian text:\n\n\"Two leagues to the northward of K\u016bfah is Mashhad \u2018Ali, where the Caliph is buried; for, on receiving his death wound in the K\u016bfah Mosque, \u2018Ali had ordered that his body should be put on a camel, which was then to be turned loose, and wherever the camel knelt there his body was to be buried. All this was therefore done, but during the time of the Omayyads no tomb was erected at Mashhad \u2018Ali, for the place was kept hidden for security. In the year 175 (791 A.D.) the holy site was discovered by the Abbasid Caliph H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, for when hunting one day near K\u016bfah he had chased his quarry into a thicket, but on attempting to follow it he found that no force could prevail on his horse to enter the place. Then awe fell on H\u0101r\u016bn, and on enquiring of the peasants they told him this was indeed the burial-place of \u2018Ali, as such being an inviolate sanctuary. Orders were given to dig, and the body of \u2018Ali was found, to guard which a shrine (or Mashhad) was then built, which became a place of visitation. At a later date in the year 366 (977 A.D.) \u2018Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid erected the Mausoleum which still exists, and the place became a little town 2,500 paces in circuit. Gh\u0101z\u0101n Kh\u0101n the Il-Kh\u0101n in recent times erected here the house for Sayyids called the D\u0101r-as-Siy\u0101dah, also a Kh\u0101nk\u0101h or Darvish monastery. To the north-west of K\u016bfah, eight farsakhs away in the desert, is Karbal\u0101, the place of martyrdom of Husayn. The building now seen here was erected by \u2018Adud-ad-Dawlah aforesaid, and a small town has grown up round this shrine also, being some 2,400 paces in circuit. Outside Mashhad Husayn are seen the tombs of those who fell fighting at his side in the battle that resulted in his martyrdom.\"\n\nThe early history of these two celebrated shrines is obscure; the foregoing is the usual Sh\u012b\u2018ah account, but though it is true that H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd at one period of his reign favoured the Alids, the Arab chronicles do not\nrelate that he 'invented' the Tomb of 'Ali. The earliest notice in detail of Mashhad 'Ali appears to be of the middle of the fourth century A.H. (tenth A.D.), written by Ibn Hawkal. He says (p. 163) that the \u1e24amd\u0101nid prince Abu-l-Hayj\u0101, who was governor of Mosul in 292 (A.D. 904) and died in 317 (A.D. 929), had built a dome on four columns over the tomb at Mashhad 'Ali, which shrine he ornamented with rich carpets and hangings; further, he surrounded the town there with a wall. Elsewhere Ibn Hawkal, however, adds that in his day the burial-place of 'Ali was also shown in the corner of the great Mosque at K\u016bfah, and this attribution was credited by many persons. In the pages of the Chronicle of Ibn-al-Ath\u012br (ix, 13, 42, 169, 394; x, 103) it is recorded that the Buyid prince 'Aq\u016bd-ad-Dawlah was buried at Mashhad 'Ali, also his sons Sharaf and Bah\u0101-ad-Dawlah; and diverse other notable persons are under various dates stated to have been buried here.\n\nIn the year 443 (1051 A.D.) the shrine was burnt to the ground by the Baghd\u0101d populace, who, being orthodox, had taken to persecuting the Sh\u012b'ahs; it must, however, have been rebuilt shortly afterwards, for Malik Sh\u0101h and his Vaz\u012br, the Niz\u0101m-al-Mulk, made their visitation to the tomb in 479 (1086 A.D.). Y\u0101k\u016bt, who mentions Mashhad 'Ali in his articles on K\u016bfah and Najaf, unfortunately gives us no details of the shrine.\n\nIn regard to Karbal\u0101 and the shrine of \u1e24usayn, it is nowhere stated by whom it was first built, but in the year 236 (850 A.D.) the Caliph Mutawakkil earned the lasting hatred of all good Sh\u012b'ahs by ordering the buildings here to be destroyed by flooding the place with water; also he forbade the visitation of the sacred spot under heavy penalties. How long the tomb of \u1e24usayn remained in ruin is not stated, but 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid in 368 (979 A.D.) built a magnificent shrine here, and this is noticed by the contemporary geographers I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (p. 85) and Ibn Hawkal (p. 166). In 407 (1016 A.D.) the dome at Mashhad \u1e24usayn was burnt down, but doubtless was restored before the place was visited by Malik Sh\u0101h in 479 (1086 A.D.)\nwhen he went hunting in these districts. Y\u0101k\u016bt unfortunately gives us no description of Mashhad \u1e24usayn to supplement the above, which is derived from Ibn-al-Ath\u012br (Chronicle, vii, 36; viii, 518; ix, 209; x, 103).\n\nThe description of Baghd\u0101d, that follows the description of K\u016bfah in the Nuzhat, has already been summarized in a recent number of this Journal (J.R.A.S. for 1899, p. 885), and most of the other towns are mentioned in the notes to my translation of Iba Serapion and need only a reference here. A plan of the ruins of Anb\u0101r is given by Mr. J. P. Peters in his recent work on Nippur (i, 177); he visited the site, and this lies at some distance from Sifayra (see also I.S. 52). B\u0101bil is at the ruins of ancient Babylon (I.S. 259). According to Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 6), Bar\u0101z-ar-R\u016bz and Bandanij\u012bn were the chief towns of two neighbouring Sub-districts (Tass\u016bj) of the great District (Ast\u0101n) of Sh\u0101dh Kab\u0101dh, which was the third Ast\u0101n of the twelve Districts into which \u2018Ir\u0101k was divided in the times of the Abbasids. From the mention of neighbouring places it is almost certain that Bar\u0101z-ar-R\u016bz is identical with the modern Bil\u0101d R\u016bz, lying about twenty-five miles east of Ba\u1e33\u016bb\u0101; and \u1e24amd-Allah (L. 2204) also speaks of its river, which rising in the Kurdist\u0101n mountains flowed out into the plain and became lost before reaching the Tigris bank. Bandanij\u012bn, generally called Bandan\u012bg\u0101n in the Lihf District, has left no trace on the map. It was an important town when Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 745; iv, 353) wrote, lying near the foot-hills (or Lihf) of the Kh\u016bzist\u0101n frontier, and its ruins should be sought for some fifty miles to the eastward, bearing south, of Bil\u0101d R\u016bz.\n\nBa\u1e63rah and \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n have been noticed before (I.S. 302, 304). The little town of Bay\u0101t still exists, and \u1e24amd-Allah (L. 2209) refers to its river, which rising in the Kurdist\u0101n mountains became lost in the plain below the town after watering many districts. Bay\u0101t, a name which does not occur in the Arab geographers, is identical with, or rather lies close to, the ruins of Tib, a town mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 566) as of some importance during Abbasid days, the site of which has been visited and described by Sir H. Layard.\nTakrit was the frontier town on the Tigris between Lower and Upper Mesopotamia (I.S. 36). The great mound of Tall \u2018Akark\u016bf still exists; its village was, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 867), of the \u2018\u012as\u0101 Canal District, and probably stood at no great distance from the town of Muhawwal, of which apparently all traces have vanished. \u1e24ad\u012bthah, \u2018the New Town\u2019 of the Euphrates, lying some thirty-five miles below \u2018\u0100nah, is called \u1e24ad\u012bthah-an-N\u016brah by Y\u0101k\u016bt (ii, 223) to distinguish it from the other \u1e24ad\u012bthah on the Tigris, at the junction of the Upper Z\u0101b. Harb\u0101 still exists on the Dujayl Canal (I.S. 39), and Hillah is on the Euphrates (I.S. 259). The ruins of \u1e24ulw\u0101n exist at the site called Sar-i-pul, and have been recently visited by M. de Morgan. The remains of \u1e24\u012brah lie near K\u016bfah (I.S. 53), and the Kh\u0101lis is a canal of East Baghd\u0101d (I.S. 225). Kh\u0101nik\u012bn, Dak\u016bk, Zangi\u0101b\u0101d, and Ka\u1e63r Sh\u012brin all figure on the map and need no comment. The first and last are in the Itinerary (Route iii), and Hamd-Allah describes (L. 220) the Dak\u016bk river as flowing from the Kurdist\u0101n mountains by the Darband-i-Khal\u012bfah, past Dak\u016bk, and out into the plain, where its waters were usually lost in the sand, though in the spring freshets they flow down to join the Tigris.\n\nThe Dujayl Canal is of West Baghd\u0101d (I.S. 70), and Dayr-al-\u2018\u0100kul is on the Tigris, so too R\u016bm\u012byah, opposite Mad\u0101in (I.S. 40, 41). R\u0101dh\u0101n and Bayn-an-Nahrayn\u2014\u2018Between two Canals\u2019\u2014were two neighbouring regions of the Nahraw\u0101n. Both names have now disappeared from the map, but, according to Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 6), there were, in Abbasid times, two Sub-districts called the \u1e6cass\u016bj of Upper and of Lower R\u0101dh\u0101n which formed part of the Sh\u0101d Hurmuz Ast\u0101n or District, and this last was on the left bank of the Tigris in the neighbourhood of Mad\u0101in. It is to be remarked that the name of Bayn-an-Nahrayn does not apparently occur in any other author. The Khur\u0101s\u0101n Road is the name for the district to the eastward of Baghd\u0101d. S\u0101marrah and Ba\u1e33\u016bb\u0101 exist, and are noticed by Ibn Serapion (I.S. 36, 268). The region of \u1e62adr\u0101yn\nwas watered by the Euphrates, but I have failed to discover its position, though the name occurs in the *Jih\u0101n Num\u0101* (p. 466), and all the MSS. agree in this spelling. As given in the Itinerary (Route iii), and lying to the north-east of Baghd\u0101d, Shahrab\u0101n still exists; and \u2018\u0100nah is on the Euphrates (I.S. 52). Neither in the *Jih\u0101n Num\u0101* nor elsewhere, apparently, is any account found of the towns named \u2018Askarah (or \u2018Askar\u012byah)\u00b9 and K\u016br\u0101n, which are not either of them marked on our maps. K\u0101dis\u012byah may be either the town of that name on the Tigris (I.S. 37), or the place on the desert border near K\u016bsah, where the great battle was fought when the Arab armies first invaded Mesopotamia.\n\nAs already said, Muhawwal was the town on the great canal called the Nahr \u1e6c\u012bsa (I.S. 71) to the west of Baghd\u0101d, and the ruins of Mad\u0101in are still to be seen on the Tigris below Baghd\u0101d (I.S. 40). The canal called the Nahr M\u0101lik is the one below the Nahr \u1e6c\u012bsa flowing from the Euphrates to the Tigris (I.S. 74), and Nu\u2018m\u0101niyah (I.S. 43) stands on the Tigris a little above where the Nil Canal\u2014on which is the town called Nil\u2014flows in (I.S. 261). The city of Nahraw\u0101n is the place now called Sifwah (I.S. 269) on the Nahraw\u0101n, the great loop canal of the left bank of the Tigris which, starting from D\u016br below Takr\u012bt, rejoined the Tigris again below M\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101ya after a course of about 200 miles (I.S. 267). In its entirety this canal no longer exists, but its course can be traced, and from what \u1e24amd-Allah reports it had gone out of use even in his day, for he gives the name of Nahraw\u0101n to what is now known as the Diy\u0101l\u0101 river. In Appendix IV (L. 2167) he writes that the Nahraw\u0101n river had two head streams, both of which rose in the mountains of Kurdist\u0101n. One of them was called the Shirw\u0101n river from the district of that name on its upper course, and lower down reaching the Taymarrah District it took this latter name. Below this the Nahraw\u0101n, or Taymarrah, was joined by the other branch, which rose\n\n\u00b9 This place may be \u2018Askar-al-Mu\u2019tasim, or the Camp Quarter, at S\u0101marr\u0101\u2019, where the Alid shrines stood: see Y\u0101k\u016bt, iii, 675; Mushtarik, 309; Mar\u0101\u0161id, ii, 5.\nin the mountains above \u1e24ulw\u0101n, at a spring in the Pass of T\u0101k-i-Kiz\u0101 of the Gil wa Gil\u0101n District; thence flowing down past the cities of \u1e24ulw\u0101n, Ka\u1e63r-i-Sh\u012br\u012bn, and Kh\u0101nik\u012bn to its junction with the other stream. Below the junction, and above Ba\u1e33\u016bb\u0101, the united waters formed the Nahraw\u0101n, which finally flowed out into the Tigris a short distance below Baghd\u0101d.\n\nThe town of \u1e24\u012bt lies on the Euphrates (I.S. 52), and Jubbah, if this be the right reading of the text, is a small place on an island in the Euphrates fifteen leagues above \u1e24\u012bt. Lastly, W\u0101sit on the older course of the Tigris (now the Shatt-al-Hay) was a place of importance as late as the time of Timur (\u1e92afar N\u0101mah, i, 657, and elsewhere), though at the present day its ruins have almost completely disappeared (I.S. 44).\nREFERENCES TO MAP OF PERSIA.\n\nThe names of the stages on the post-roads will be found in Appendix I on the Itineraries.\n\n'\u012aR\u0100K 'AJAM.\u20141, Fir\u016bz\u0101n; 2, F\u0101rif\u0101n; 3, Var\u0101min; 4, T\u012bhr\u0101n and Shrine of Sh\u0101h 'Abd-al-'Az\u012bm; 5, F\u0101risj\u012bn; 6, S\u016bmgh\u0101n; 7, Sags\u0101b\u0101d; 8, Abhar; 9, \u0100vah; 10, S\u0101vah; 11, Sunkur\u0101b\u0101d; 12, Suj\u0101s and Suhravard; 13, Sat\u016br\u012bk; 14, Sarjah\u0101n; 15, \u0160\u0101in Kal'ah; 16, K\u0101ghadh Kun\u0101n or Kh\u016bnaj; 17, Muzda\u1e33\u0101n; 18, \u0160\u0101m\u0101n; 19, Ardist\u0101n; 20, Dalij\u0101n; 21, Gulpayg\u0101n; 22, Zav\u0101rah; 23, Dih S\u0101r\u016bk; 24, Nat\u0101nz; 25, Idhaj or M\u0101l Amir; 26, 'Ar\u016bj or S\u016bsan; 27, Lurdag\u0101n; 28, S\u0101b\u016brkhw\u0101st; 29, Khurr\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d; 30, Bur\u016bjird; 31, Saymarah; 32, Asad\u0101b\u0101d; 33, \u0100bah of Kharrak\u0101n; 34, Darguz\u012bn; 35, R\u016bdar\u016bd, Tuvi, and Sark\u0101n; 36, Maybud; 37, N\u0101y\u012bn.\n\nADHARBAYJ\u0100N.\u20141, Awj\u0101n; 2, \u1e6car\u016bj or \u1e6cas\u016bj; 3, Khalkh\u0101l; 4, Sh\u0101l and Kul\u016br; 5, Ahar; 6, Khoi; 7, Salm\u0101s; 8, Urm\u012byah; 9, Ushn\u016byah; 10, Sar\u0101v; 11, Miy\u0101nj\u012b; 12, Pasav\u0101; 13, Dih Khw\u0101rk\u0101n; 14, Layl\u0101n; 15, Marand; 16, Zangiy\u0101n and Bridge of Khud\u0101 \u0100far\u012bn; 17, Karkar and Bridge of Diy\u0101-al-Mulk; 18, Nakhchiv\u0101n; 19, Urd\u016bb\u0101d.\n\nMU\u1e24\u0100N and ARR\u0100N.\u20141, Barzand; 2, Pilv\u0101r; 3, Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d; 4, Barda'ah.\n\nKURDIST\u0100N.\u20141, Alishtar; 2, Bah\u0101r; 3, Sult\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d Jamjam\u0101l; 4, Shahraz\u016br; 5, Kirind and K\u016bsh\u0101n; 6, Harsin; 7, Vast\u0101m or Bis\u016bt\u016bn.\n\nKH\u016aZIST\u0100N.\u20141, Junday Sh\u0101p\u016br; 2, Haw\u012bzah; 3, R\u0101mhurmuz; 4, S\u016bs; 5, 'Askar Mukram; 6, Masruk\u0101n town.\n\nF\u0100RS.\u20141, Tawwaz; 2, Khabr; 3, Khunayfgh\u0101n; 4, \u0160imk\u0101n; 5, Kav\u0101r; 6, K\u0101rz\u012bn, K\u012br, and Abzar; 7, K\u0101riy\u0101n; 8, L\u0101ghir; 9, K\u016br\u0101n; 10, Mimand; 11, Istakhr; 12, Abark\u016bh; 13, Ikli\u1e0d; 14, Surmak; 15, Bayd\u0101; 16, Kharr\u0101mah; 17, M\u0101y\u012bn; 18, Band-i-Am\u012br; 19, Har\u0101t; 20, Kutruh; 21, Kam\u012bn; 22, Kall\u0101r and\nK\u016brad; 23, Yazdikhw\u0101st; 24, Dih Gird\u016b; 25, Ab\u0101dah; 26, Jahram; 27, Juvaym of Abu Ahmad; 28, Sh\u0101p\u016br; 29, Nawbanj\u0101n; 30, Tir Murd\u0101n; 31, Jirrah; 32, Gunbad Mallagh\u0101n; 33, Khisht; 34, Kum\u0101rij; 35, Juvaym and Khull\u0101r; 36, R\u012bshahr; 37, B\u016bst\u0101nak; 38, Mahrub\u0101n; 39, S\u012bn\u012bz; 40, Jann\u0101b\u0101.\n\nShab\u0101nk\u0101rah.\u20141, Dark\u0101n or Zark\u0101n; 2, I\u1e63\u1e6dahb\u0101n\u0101n; 3, N\u012briz; 4, Khayrah; 5, T\u0101rum; 6, Kurm and R\u016bbanz.\n\nKuhist\u0101n.\u20141, Bajist\u0101n; 2, Jun\u0101b\u0101d; 3, Dasht-i-Biy\u0101d and F\u0101ris; 4, Birjand; 5, Khuf; 6, Isfad; 7, Istind; 8, Sh\u0101rakhs; 9, \u1e6cabas Kilak\u012b; 10, \u1e6cabas Mas\u012bn\u0101n; 11, Darah Castle.\n\nKhur\u0101s\u0101n.\u20141, Isfar\u0101yin; 2, Bayhaq or Sabziv\u0101r; 3, Biy\u0101r; 4, Khud\u0101shah of Juvayn; 5, Mashhad-i-Im\u0101m Ri\u1e0d\u0101; 6, F\u016bshanj; 7, Kus\u016by; 8, Khargird; 9, M\u0101l\u0101n of B\u0101kharz; 10, Gun\u0101b\u0101d of B\u0101dg\u012bz; 11, J\u0101m, and B\u016bzj\u0101n or P\u016bchk\u0101n; 12, Khw\u0101f; 13, Sal\u0101m; 14, Sanj\u0101n; 15, Z\u016bzan; 16, Abivard; 17, Khav\u0101r\u0101n.\n\nK\u016bmis.\u20141, Khuv\u0101r or Mahallah B\u0101gh; 2, Samn\u0101n; 3, \u0100h\u016bv\u0101n; 4, Girdk\u016bh; 5, Fir\u016bzk\u016bh.\n\nG\u012bl\u0101n.\u20141, T\u016blim; 2, Shaft; 3, F\u016bmin; 4, Kawtam; 5, L\u0101hij\u0101n.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. V.\u2014The Ris\u0101latu'l-Ghufr\u0101n: by Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 al-Ma'arri. Part II, including Table of Contents with Text and Translation of the Section on Zanda\u011fa and of other passages. By Reynold A. Nicholson.\n\n[It was my desire that the translation of the passages here selected should be accompanied by the Arabic text, and in writing the notes I assumed that the reader would have the Arabic before him. It has been found necessary, however, to divide the article into three parts, two of which will contain the translation and notes, while the original text will be printed separately in the third.]\n\nIn the last sentence of my paper on Part I of the Ghufr\u0101n (J.R.A.S., October, 1900) I described the Second Part as \"more difficult, but also more characteristic and interesting.\" Further study has led me somewhat to modify this view. It is more difficult to read, because the scribe, hastening to the goal, drove his pen furiously. On the first reading a good deal of it seemed to me almost hopeless, but a closer acquaintance has removed not a few of these stumbling-blocks, and I am convinced that only patience and determination are needed to remove all, or nearly all, that are left. If indeed Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 had always written as he writes in the section to which this article is mainly devoted, his readers would have no cause for complaint: it comprises many anecdotes and comparatively little rhetoric; hence it is, beyond doubt, less difficult than any other section of the Ris\u0101la. Unfortunately, these twenty or thirty pages are but an oasis in the surrounding desert. Elsewhere Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 seldom escapes from his artificial prose with its forced metaphors and tyrannous rhymes. The passages of which I have attempted a translation, on pp. 127-129 and 161-163, may serve to illustrate his typical manner.\nBut on the whole, when account is made of the large number of scattered anecdotes, the Second Part is scarcely equal in difficulty to the First. That it is more characteristic will be admitted, in the sense that it is more personal. The author says that he now begins to answer his correspondent's letter, and though each point taken up is merely a peg on which to hang elaborate rhetoric or discursive erudition, we do get occasional glimpses of the man behind the artifice. The relative interest and value of the two parts must be a question of taste. Considered purely as literature, Part II cannot fail to be preferred by good judges. It is a delightful creation of the fancy, a trifle pedantic, but witty, audacious and original. According to tradition, the Ghufr\u0101n is tainted with heresy. For this criticism not the author's treatment of sandaka, which is by no means sympathetic, but his violation of orthodox susceptibilities must be held responsible. He has made Paradise the scene of a frivolous causerie. I am not aware that this feature of his work has any parallel in Mu\u1e25ammadan literature. It recalls faintly the Sixth Book of the Aeneid, the Divine Comedy, and the Vision of Ard\u0101 V\u012br\u0101f, but all these are distinguished by a calm sincerity and lofty seriousness which at once degrade the Ghufr\u0101n to the level of an impudent parody. To find a really significant parallel let us turn to Lucian, an author with whom Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 has much in common. Lucian, in the Verae Historiae, describes his visit to the Happy Isles, where, after seeing many ancient worthies, he has a talk with Homer, who enlightens him touching some details of the Homeric problem, and affirms the genuineness of the verses rejected by the Alexandrian grammarians, Aristarchus and Zenodotus. This is quite in Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101's spirit; so is the description of the islands and of the pleasures enjoyed by the Blest. A passing allusion to the Frogs of Aristophanes will suffice: here the differences are very great, and Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101, with all his cleverness and learning, shows poorly.\n\n1 Book ii, \u00a7 11 sqq. (ed. Dindorf). On leaving the Happy Isles Lucian, like the Shaikh in the Ghufr\u0101n, visited the infernal regions. Cf. also his Negeomanteia.\nbeside the splendid genius of the Greek. Both writers, however, agree in the burlesque handling of the Afterworld; and the literary duel between \u00c6schylus and Euripides may be compared with that between A'\u015fh\u0101 Kais and N\u0101bigha al-Ja'd\u012b in the Gh\u016bfr\u0101n.\n\nThe miscellaneous character of Part II, though destructive to its artistic merit, renders it perhaps more generally interesting. About a third consists of anecdotes, verses, and reflections concerning zandaka. These present a lively picture of ignorance and knavery possessing or assuming a religious virtue. Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 does not try to go beneath the surface; his observations on the origin of zandaka are trivial; he offers no theory such as that put forward by Chwolson,\u00b9 for which a strong case might be made, that many of these sects were the offspring of a widespread conspiracy, directed by Persians, to honeycomb Mu\u1e25ammadanism with Persian ideas and finally to re-establish the old faith upon the ruins of its oppressor. But after all, how should a mere man of letters, even though he was a poet and thinker as well, attain to the philosophical conception of history which so rarely is found in the professed historians of Isl\u0101m? He has given us notes on the margin of history; and a note is often more piquant than the text. His attitude towards the sindiks, if not absolutely irreproachable in the eyes of an orthodox Moslem, affords no ground for the imputation that he sympathized with them. He prays God to reward the Shaikh, who had expressed his abhorrence of their doctrines, and to bless Mu\u1e25ammad for having preached the gospel of the sword against heresy. He contrasts unfavourably the wilder spirits among them with the pagan Arabs, \"who inclined to the opinion of the philosophers and the wisdom of the ancient books.\"\u00b2 He castigates Ibnu'l-R\u0101wand\u012b for his presumption in attempting to supersede the Kor'\u0101n by a work of his own composition. In fact, he has nothing to say on their behalf, though he sometimes utters the hope that they are not so black as they\n\n\u00b9 Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus, i, 288.\n\u00b2 I.e. they acknowledged no prophet.\npaint themselves and that they profess what they do not actually believe. A bigot might accuse him of undue tolerance when, e.g., he will not affirm that Bashsh\u0101r b. Burd has gone to Hell, but leaves him in the hands of God, of whose mercy only infidels need despair. And the inquisitor may chance upon an unguarded expression like \"God does not care whether His servants keep the fast through fear or whether they break it.\" But on the whole he cannot fairly be charged even with lukewarmness, and certainly not with impiety. The ill repute of the Gh\u016bfr\u0101n appears to rest on two circumstances. It cannot be denied that Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 depicted the Paradise of the faithful as a glorified salon haunted by immortal but immoral Bohemians. In the second place, a man is known by the company he keeps. Sale translated the Kor'\u0101n: he was therefore 'a Turk.' Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 published stories about the sind\u016bs and blasphemous quotations from their poetry: who could doubt that he was a rascally fellow? Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 indeed hints that his accusers were right. \"It is said that I am religious, but if the veil were lifted my critics would not be content with abusing me: they would wish to make me drink poison.\" He humbly turns the smitten cheek to his assailants; he reserves his wrath for those who damn him with injudicious praise. How far this was sincere and how far it was politic self-depreciation, I cannot now undertake to determine.\n\nThe identity of his correspondent still remains undiscovered. I think, however, there is some plausibility in the conjecture that he is Ab\u016b Mans\u016br al-Dailam\u012b, better known as Ab\u016b'l-\u1e24asan 'Al\u012b Ibn Mans\u016br, who was the son of a soldier in the service of Saifu'l-Daula Ibn \u1e24amd\u0101n and was a good but licentious poet.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 I confess to having grave doubts of the author's honesty. Hypocrisy, he repeatedly observes, is the way of the world, and one fears that he himself practised it as a fine art. Cf. what he says about Ibnu'l-R\u0101wandi's D\u0101migh, and note ad loc.\n\n\u00b2 Ibn Khallik\u0101n, Translation, ii, 191, where he is casually mentioned in the life of Ibn Jinni. I shall be grateful for further references. The very brief notice in B\u0101kharz\u012b gives no information.\nRis\u0101la is often spoken of as \u2018Al\u012b b. Man\u1e63\u016br, and the kunya, Ab\u016b'l-\u1e24asan, is also mentioned. As Saifu'l-Daula died in 355 A.H., it is probable enough that this \u2018Al\u012b b. Man\u1e63\u016br was 60 years old in 424 A.H. The only objection that occurs to me is the silence of Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 regarding his poetry.\n\nThe translation aims at being exact rather than elegant, but I have not scrupled occasionally to vary the construction in order to make the sense clearer. Errors will, of course, be found, as is inevitable in a paper dealing with a difficult text, which I have had to decipher and interpret without help and in a definite time. The labour spent on this article was small, however, compared with the preliminary stage of correcting and, as far as I could, elucidating the whole Arabic text of Part II. Therefore I would claim indulgence for errors that are due, not to carelessness or ignorance, but to the necessity of making an end. The notes, though very brief and inadequate, are the fruit of much tedious hunting. Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 rarely gives the full name. He writes \"al-Kutrabbuli,\" \"al-'Alav\u012b al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b,\" etc., and since his biographical particulars are usually of the scantiest, it is no simple matter to decide what person is meant, or even, perhaps, to find anyone who might be meant. The list of variants is approximately complete, but I have not thought it worth while to mention every instance in which the diacritical points are misplaced, omitted, or wrongly inserted. Words enclosed within square brackets are omitted in the MS.\n\nBefore coming to the Table of Contents I must refer to another\u2014possibly the only other\u2014MS. of this work. Writing in the Deutsche Literaturzeitung (Feb. 25, 1899), Dr. Goldziher announced that a manuscript of the Ghufr\u0101n is in the 'Privatbesitz' of an Egyptian scholar, 'Abdu'l-Rah\u012bm Ahmad, \"von welcher er vor nun 2 Jahren eine Ausgabe in Aussicht gestellt hat.\" Apparently this prospect has not yet ripened into a reality, but there is no reason to conclude that it has fallen to the ground, and I look\n\nFor this reference I am indebted to the courtesy of Professor Margoliouth.\nforward to being enabled, by the publication of 'Abdu'l-Rahim's MS., to improve and in sundry places to restore the text of mine, which I hope eventually to edit with translation, commentary, and indices. Hence I refrain from recording here some valuable corrections sent to me by Sir Charles Lyall, who had a short loan of the MS. These and any others that I may receive will be gratefully acknowledged at the proper time.\n\nContents of the Ris\u0101latu'l-Ghufr\u0101n.

Considering, however, the very untrustworthy character of the Leiden MS., from which this fragment is published, I think it likely that \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062f is a corruption. The frequent word-plays leave no doubt that \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062f is the genuine reading in the Ris\u0101la.

Part II.\n\nThis section has run to great length, but now I will set about answering the letter. I perceive that you use the words \"May God make me your ransom!\" with that sincerity and honesty which are natural to you, but remote from the mass of mankind; for everyone cheats his neighbour and has become inventive in lying. If Queen Sh\u012br\u012bn had said to Khusr\u0101u, \"May God make me your ransom when you stay at home or go abroad!\" she would have cozened him therein and played the hypocrite with him, even though she enraptured him by her unadorned beauty and yielded to his desire.

The whole of this passage should be compared with another in the Letters (ed. Margoliouth), p. 74, l. 18 sqq.\npromise. If I enjoy a vain reputation, I am notorious for having trouble dealt to me in full measure. Verily the patient are rewarded and commended, and 't is beyond doubt that a scanty remnant of water will be the portion of him who changes his abode.\n\nI swear an oath like that of Imru'u'l-Kais, when he wished to stay with his beloved and had no fear either of maid or of mistress.\u00b9\n\nAnd said,\u00b2 \"By God, I will not stir from my seat, although they should cut off my head and my limbs beside thee!\"\n\nthat I am slandered just as the Arabs slander the gh\u016bl, which pays no heed to their stories, and as proverbial sayings malign the lizard, which like a passionate lover makes the hard ground its bed, and speak in the name of the dumb hyena whose tongue is not loosed at dawn or eve. It is supposed that I am a savant, whereas I possess neither knowledge nor intelligence. Truly this is an affliction that renders it impossible to see things as they really are; yet the sciences demand application and the most assiduous study of books. It is said also that I am religious, but if the veil were lifted, my critics would not be satisfied with abusing me: they would wish to make me drink jauzal with vitriol. Yet how can the morning neigh of the wild-ass, whose haunt is the Abyssinian levels, be such measured verse as the damsel in her chamber\n\n\u00b9 Literally: \"of the woman spying or of the woman that is the spy's object.\"\n\u00b2 The Diw\u0101ns, l\u012bi, 22.

Or that sparrows which fly with wings are like those of al-Mundhir which ate fodder and grunted? And how should an ordinary bird be thought to coo like the dove, when it is dumb as well as ugly in comparison? Far out is he who asserts that stones speak and feel pain when struck; and whoever seeks to clothe himself with a face-covering (lif\u0101m) will have nothing to console himself withal.\n\nWere I ignorant of these reports, I should not have had the trouble of denying or correcting them. I should have been like the idol, which does not care whether it is venerated or split, and like a salt land, which heeds not whether people say \u201cIt is fertile,\u201d or, \u201cWhat a bad crop\u201d; and like the beast slaughtered in its prime, which pays no attention to the man eating it, whether he says \u201cIt is fat,\u201d or whether (when the butcher cuts it up), \u201cIt sticks to the board.\u201d God, whose help is invoked against illusion, does not disturb the even balance. Al-il\u0101ki is connected with il\u0101k, i.e. lightning that is not followed by rain. How can I be deemed happy, when I am belied and have knowledge attributed to me, whereas I am not secure in the end from a distant shame? If I joy in this reputation, I am like one suspected of being rich: men believe that his rumoured wealth comes to him in loads, and it pleases him when the ignorant say, \u201cHe has plenty of money, gold is on his right hand and his left.\u201d Then the sultan requires him to pay over a large sum, and finding mere breath, he beats him\n\n1 The \u2018sparrows\u2019 of al-Mundhir were camels (see Lane under \u0639\u0635\u0641\u0648\u0631).\nMy reading (\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0643\u0647) for \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0643\u0647 does not involve a great change from the original, of which I can make nothing.\n\n2 The MS. reads \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062d, \u2018froth issuing from a camel\u2019s mouth.\u2019\n\n3 i.e. \u201cdoes not make truth prevail over falsehood.\u201d But the reading is uncertain.

The exact translation is: \u201cthat the rumours (of his wealth) bring him loads (of solid merchandise).\u201d\nto extort a confession, till at last he is punished capitally p. 129, and receives no merciful treatment. God knows, I listen gladly to my critics, because their doubts of me are not baseless, while I am vexed by fictitious praise that leaves me like a trapped animal exposed to the weather. Had I been butted by the 'horns' of the locust, I should have been debarred from all volition.\u00b9 As for the horn of the goat, someone else, in my opinion, has need of it, since to me the horn of the gazelle is fatal.\u00b2 May God pardon those who think well of the evildoer and place a pilgrimage in the postponed month! Were it not that I dislike society, preferring to die the death of a mountain-goat in its lair, and if these visionaries were confronted with me, it would soon be proved that they are in error. May the obscure reality become clear to them, and may the seeker grasp the leading-rope!\n\nAs regards the story which you mention of al-Kutrabbuli\u00b3 and Ibn Abi'l-Azhar,\u2074 the like of it may sometimes happen. It is dubious whether the former was imprisoned in 'Ir\u0101k, but his imprisonment in Syria is well known. I have been p. 140, told that when he was asked about the true meaning of this,\n\n\u00b9 I.e. the feeblest attack reduces me to helplessness.\n\u00b2 This appears to mean: \"It is a waste of good powder and shot to criticize me, because I am already past praying for.\" The words \u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0642\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0641\u0652\u0633\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062d\u064e\u062c\u064c may perhaps allude to the proverb (Freytag, i, 383), \u0648\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0642\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064d \"he carried him on the buck's horn,\" i.e. inflicted a great misfortune upon him.\n\u00b3 The only person with this nisba whom I can find is Ibn Sa'id al-Kutrabbuli, mentioned in the Fihrist, p. 124. That he was nearly contemporary with Ibn Abi'l-Azhar may be gathered from the statement of Ibn Khallik\u0101n (Translation, iv, 80), that Yahy\u0101 \u1e6cim\u016b'l-Munajjim, who died 300 A.H., found him a pleasant companion. Kutrabbul is a village between Baghdad and \u1e62\u016brab\u0101.\n\u2074 Fihrist, 147; Fl\u00fcgel, Grammatischen Schulen der Araber, 97. He died 325 A.H.\nsobriquet, he said, \"It is derived from nabna,\" i.e. a hill. He aspired to what worse men than he have aspired to, but a Providence on high directs the course of Destiny: its prizes fall to the fortunate, and it is not afraid of disappointing the earnest striver. Various things in his div\u0101n show that he was devoted to religion and resembled an imbecile in his craziness, e.g. the verse:\n\nRecompense is given, but none receives it except through his Creator, by divine ordinance.\n\nAnd again:\n\nHow unjust is God, if He requites His creatures, yet does not allow their assertions to be sincere!\n\nBut when it comes to fundamental principles, the speech of the tongue tells nothing of a man's belief, for the world is naturally disposed to falsehood and hypocrisy. It is possible that one should profess an article of faith, making it a specious mask whereby to gain applause or some idle transitory ambition, and perhaps in the past there may have been people with devout exteriors and impious hearts. I feel sure that Di'bil b. 'Ali had no religion. Although he professed to be a Shi'ite, his motive was altogether worldly. How many keep the Sabbath by writing odes to their mistresses! I doubt not that Di'bil held the same opinions as al-Hakami and his fellows, whose zandaka was notorious and emanated from their very doors. Ab\u016b Nuw\u0101s is a subject of dispute: it is claimed for him that he was pious and used to perform his daily prayers by night, but as a matter of fact he took the way of his contemporaries. The Prophet (on him be God's blessing and peace!) found the Arabs desiring green fodder but not spirited enough\n\n1 I do not understand this derivation.\n2 Possibly should be omitted; the metre will then be fawil.\n3 Ab\u016b Nuw\u0101s.\n4 I.e. they were inveterate, radical zind\u012bks. Cf. the German phrase, 'von Hause aus.'\nto pass the outer wall. Some followed him\u2014God best knows their true thoughts. But when Isl\u0101m became established and its empire firmly based, the Arabs mixed with other peoples and heard the language of physicians, astronomers, and masters of dialectic; and a great number fell away. Hereby has never ceased among men from time immemorial: writers of history allege that Adam (God bless him!) was sent to his children, and that he warned them of the future life and bade them fear punishment, but they would not believe him and rejected his tidings. And so it has continued to the present day. According to some scholars the chiefs of the Koraish were sindiks. And serve them right! Their poet, elegizing one after another those who fell at Badr, said with reference to Shadd\u0101d b. al-Aswad al-Laith\u012b:\n\nUmm Bakr gave me greeting. Greet Umm Bakr and say,\n\"Peace be with thee!\"\nHow much glory, how many a noble man lies at the well, the well of Badr!\nAnd at the well, the well of Badr, how many a wooden bowl crowned with the camel's hump!\nO Umm Bakr, never offer me the cup again, now that the brother of Hish\u0101m is gone!\nAh, who will bear my message to the 'Compassionate,' that I renounce the month of fasting?\nAnd now that his uncle is gone, who was a chief among the chiefs, a mighty winebibber.\n\n1 This verse is supplied at the bottom of the page.\n2 This verse is in Shahrist\u0101n\u012b, p. 433; Wright's Reading-book, p. 150.

Touching the complaints addressed to Time by temporal beings, that is a practice borrowed from antiquity. Abuse of Time increased to such an extent that it was prohibited in the \u1e25ad\u012bth \"Do not abuse Time, for God is Time.\" What this means is well known, and also that its inner sense is not that which appears on the surface; for one of the Prophets (on them be peace!) used to hold that Time is the Creator but not the Object of worship, and we read in the Kor'\u0101n\\(^3\\): \"Nothing but Time destroys us.\" The statement\n\n\\(^1\\) Shahrast\u0101n\u012b (p. 433) gives the line thus:\n\nwhich is a manifest reconstruction.

In Sibawaihi's Book there are indications that, according to his view, Time is the passing of night and day; and marginal notes on this expression have been appended to the text. I have given a definition that well deserves to have been anticipated, although I never heard it before, viz., \"Time is a thing whereof the least part is capable of containing something,\" just like the contents of a vessel; for the predicament of quantity cannot be separated from Contingent Being. With respect to those who say, \"Nothing but Time destroys us,\" etc., as for instance the verse generally attributed to al-Akhtul, but declared by \u1e24ab\u012bb b.

No; this is a thing inherited by one age after another. In the tribe of 'Abdu'l-Kais there was a poet called Sh\u0101timu'l-Dahr, who is the author of the following verses:\n\nAnd when I saw that Time's way was hard, and he showed us a hairy face with cropped ears,\nAnd an ape's forehead, thin like the sandal-strap, and a shrunken nose, and he haughtily averted his beard,\nI remembered the noble, the munificent who passed away, and I said to 'Amr and \u1e24us\u0101m, \"Oh, give me leave to depart!\"\n\nAs to your indignation touching the zind\u012bks and heretics, may God reward you for it, even as He rewarded you for your thirst on the road to Mecca, and for your exposure to the scorching heat at 'Araf\u0101, and for the nights which you passed at Muzdalifa! Doubtless you supplicated God during the numbered and appointed days that He should make soft [to your feet] the hills of Isl\u0101m, and should set up a shining sign for those who submit themselves to His will.\n\nBut zandaka is an old sore; the skin has long been worm-eaten by it. Some divines have held that, if a man who has shown himself to be a zind\u012bk repents in fear of being put to death, his repentance is not admitted. There is a difference in the case of other infidels: when an apostate recants his recantation is accepted. Every religion has its heretics,\n\n1 I have not been able to find any further mention of this poet.\n2 Cf. the verse cited by Lane under \u062c\u062f\u0639:\n\u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0631 \u062f\u0648 \u0623\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0647 \u062c\u062f\u0639\u064a\u0627\n3 This is a variation of the phrase \u0623\u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0623\u062e\u062f\u0639\u0647.\n4 The three days following the tenth of Dhul-Hijja (Kor. ii, 199).\n5 The first ten days of Dhul-Hijja (Kor. xii, 29).\n6 Opposite this line comes the marginal note: \u0645\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0642\u0629.\nwho are regarded by their orthodox brethren as conformists but are recusants in secret. It is necessary that the impostor should be brought to shame and the springs of evil laid bare; and the kings of Persia used to punish zanda\u011fa with death. The sindiks are called materialists. They acknowledge neither prophet nor sacred book. This peculiarity was imitated by Bashsh\u0101r. It is related that among his books a paper was found on which was written, \"I wished to satirize so-and-so, the H\u0101shimite, but spared him on account of his kinship with the Apostle of God.\" They assert that Bashsh\u0101r used to take counsel with Sibawaihi, and that one day when he was present in the literary circle of Y\u016bnus b. \u1e24ab\u012bb, he said, \"Is any informer here?\" On p. 148. being assured that there was none, he recited to them:\n\nO sons of Umayya, wake from your slumber.

It is related that he found fault with Bashsh\u0101r for his verse:\n\n*Greeting from me to al-Ghazal\u0101!* Long have I toyed with her in the shade of a verdant spot o'ergrown with flowers.\n\nSibawaihi maintained that the form *ghazal\u0101* was not used by the Arabs, but Bashsh\u0101r pointed out that it was analogous to *bashak\u0101*, *jamaz\u0101*, and the like. Bashsh\u0101r in his poetry employed *nin\u0101n* as the plural of *n\u016bn*, a fish, and Sibawaihi is said to have disapproved of it. But these stories have no authority. According to the Book of Sibawaihi *n\u016bn* makes *nin\u0101n* in the plural, and this fact is enough to demolish the anecdote in question. Bashsh\u0101r's biographers mention that he threatened to satirize Sibawaihi, but that Sibawaihi made it up with him and cited his poetry. Possibly, however, his citation was nothing more than quoting from memory, as is customary in salons and in places where people are gathered together. Those conversant with Bashsh\u0101r attribute this couplet to him:\n\n*Not every man of judgment offers you his advice, and not every one that offers his advice is a man of judgment.*\n\nThe second half of this couplet occurs without the author's name in the chapter devoted to *idgh\u0101m* in Sibawaihi's Book. Others declare that the author is Ab\u016b'l-Aswad al-Du'ali. It is said that Ya'k\u016bb b. D\u0101'\u016bd, the waz\u012br of al-Mahdi, persecuted Bashsh\u0101r and finally had him killed. There is a dispute as to his age, some saying that he was 80 years old at the time of his death, while others think he was older; but only God knows the truth. I do not decide that he is in Hell, but I mentioned him as I did because I attached him to the will of God, and verily God is forbearing, munificent. The author of the *Kit\u0101bu'l-Waraka* has\n\n---\n\n1. *Agh.* iii, 54. Another account makes al-Akhfash the critic.\n2. This word is not in the lexica.

See also *Fihr\u012bst*, p. 128.\nmentioned a number of poets in the table of Ab\u016b Nuw\u0101s and his predecessors, and has described them as zind\u012bks, but the hearts of men are inscrutable, and only He who knows all mysteries hath knowledge thereof. At that time such beliefs were nourished in secret from fear of the sword, whereas now people's inmost thoughts are revealed and the ostrich's broken egg discloses\\(^1\\) the ugliest chick. In the former epoch there was a man who had friends among the Sh\u012b'ites and also a zind\u012bk friend. One day when he had invited the Sh\u012b'ites to his house, the zind\u012bk came and knocked at the door and said:\n\nMy breast is laden with sorrows, divided with anxieties and cares.\n\nThe master of the house said to him, \"Confound you! what means this?\" So the zind\u012bk left him and went his way. Afterwards the person who had given the entertainment met him, and said: \"Look here, did you want\\(^2\\) to get me into trouble?\" for he was afraid that his friends might suspect him of being a zind\u012bk. \"Invite them again,\" said he, \"and let me know the occasion.\" So when they were gathered in his house, the zind\u012bk came and cried:\n\nMy breast is laden with sorrows, divided with anxieties and cares.\n\nThey said, \"O wretched one, why?\" He said:\n\nBecause of the sin committed against the father of \u1e24asan by 'Umar and his friend Ab\u016b Bakr.\n\nThereupon he departed, and the Sh\u012b'ites rejoiced at his words. When the master of the house met him, he said, \"Thank you heartily, you have freed me from suspicion.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0628\u062a should be read. Cf. Letters \\(^3\\)c, l. iv, \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0628\n\n\\(^2\\) The manuscript reading (\u0627\u0646\u063a\u0627\u0636\u062a) is to be explained by the fact that \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0643\u0629 also means 'water left by a torrent.'\n\n\\(^3\\) For the omission of \\(\\hat{i}\\) in colloquial Arabic cf. Van Vloten's preface to the Kit\u0101b-i-Bukh\u0101l\u0101, p. 3.\nA number of scholars used to sit in the *majlis* of Bagra. Among them was a *zindik* who had two swords, one of which he had named *Khair* (Good) and the other *Falah* (Prosperity), and whenever a Moslem gave him greeting he replied:\n\n*Good attend thee in the morning and Prosperity in the evening!*\n\nThen he would turn to his companions who were acquainted with the circumstance and say:\n\n*Two swords like the lightning when the lightning flashes.*\n\nAs regards the verse of Ab\u016b Nuw\u0101s:\u00b9\n\n*The airs of a singer and the elegance of a zindik,* this idea has been criticized. It is said that he meant one of the Ban\u016b'l-\u1e24\u0101rith, well known for his impiety and elegant accomplishments, who was a royal favourite. The first part of the distich,\n\n*Boon-companion of a prince, gossip of a king,* resembles the verse of Imru'u'l-Kais:\u00b2\n\n*To-day I will drink, not burdening my conscience with sin against God nor intruding as an uninvited guest.*\n\nIt cannot properly be referred to those cases in which the *h* is pausal, e.g.:\n\n*O Baidarah, O Baidarah, O Baidarah!*\n\n\u00b9 This line, of which the metre is *mansarij*, occurs in Freytag, *Arabum Proverbia*, i, 214. According to the scholiast, Bashsh\u0101r b. Burd used to say \u0623\u064e\u0638\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0641\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064e\u0651\u0646\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0642\u0652, referring to Mu\u1e6di' b. Iy\u0101s (Brockelmann, i, 73). The same authority declares that it is wrong to say \"more elegant than a *zindik*,\" but the example of the \u1e62\u0101bi'ans, at Baghdad and elsewhere, and of many Persian freethinkers, fully justifies a general application of the phrase. Mu\u1e6di' seems to be the person intended by the vague description \"one of the Ban\u016b'l-\u1e24\u0101rith,\" i.e. \u1e24\u0101rith b. Baqr b. 'Abd Man\u0101t (W\u00fcstenfeld, *Genealogische Tabellen*, N. 11).\n\n\u00b2 *The D\u012bd\u0101ns*, li, 10.\nor as another poet says:\u00b9\n\nOften the wolf crouched and gathered himself to spring upon\na gamesome buck, white in the foreleg, of middle size.\nWhen he saw that he could not enjoy\u00b2 (the wished-for prey) nor\nfill his belly, he sidled off to an art\u0101-tree in the sandy\nbend and lay down to sleep.\n\nThis is approved because of the h being distinctly pro-\nnounced.\u00b3 When a phrase is complete the silent h may\nwell be added, but mu\u1e25addithuh malik\u2074 are muddaf and muddaf\nilaih, and such a license is inadmissible when the two nouns\nare practically one.\n\n\u00b9 The first two lines are cited in the \u1e62ab\u0101\u02bfa under \u0635\u062f\u0639 and the fourth line\nibid. under \u0628\u0627\u0631.\n\u00b2 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 = \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652.\n\u00b3 See Wright's Grammar, ii, 369 D, Rem. a.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. VI.\u2014A List of Writers, Books, and other Authorities mentioned by El Maqrizi in his Khit\u0101t. By A. R. Guest.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive; it is thought, however, that it will be found to contain the names of the principal authorities cited by El Maqrizi in this book, and, in the absence of an index to the only printed edition at present available, it is hoped that it may be of service to students of Egyptian history.\n\nThe names of authors and others who appear to be quoted with reference to matters of but slight or of no historical importance, and also the names of all those who are obviously not quoted at first-hand, are printed in italics. The names of the principal authorities on which El Khit\u0101t is chiefly based are distinguished by capital letters; the rest are shown in ordinary type.\n\nNumbers not preceded by letters refer to the B\u016bl\u0101q 1270 A.H. edition of El Khit\u0101t, 2 vols., which is specially denoted where necessary by the abbreviation Maq. = El Maqrizi.\n\nEl Maw\u0101'iz wa 'l I'tib\u0101r bi D\u012bkr El Khit\u0101t wa 'l Ath\u0101r, by Taqi ed D\u012bn Ahmad, El Maqrizi, commonly called Khit\u0101t el Maqrizi, whose author died 845 A.H. (1441-2 A.D.), was written between the years 820-840 A.H. It was printed at B\u016bl\u0101q 1270 A.H. (1853 A.D.), and this edition is the one that is referred to in these notes, in which the following abbreviations are used:\n\nAh. = Ahmad.\nH.K. = Hajji Khalifah's Kashf es Zun\u016bn. Constantinople, 1310 A.H. 2 vols.\n\n1 Maq. i, 286, 188; ii, 463.\nIn spite of the wide celebrity of El Khit\u0101\u1e6d and the familiarity of most readers of Arabic with the book, a brief description of its scope and a few remarks on its general character may not be out of place.\n\nThe statement that the B\u016bl\u0101q edition reaches a little over one thousand pages quarto, with 39 lines to the page, will give an idea of its size.\n\nThe author of El Khit\u0101\u1e6d tells us in his preface the task which he set himself in the composition of the book. He says: \u201cIts object is the collection of the scattered history of Egypt and (accounts of) the condition of its inhabitants... so that a person who has mastered it shall know the monuments which were existing and vanished at each period...\u201d\n\nHe also gives its division into seven parts. The first one relates to the geography of Egypt, to the Nile, to its taxation, and the mountains which bound it (vol. i, pp. 5\u2013128). The second part describes many of its towns (vol. i, pp. 128\u2013285). The third part contains the history of Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d and its governors (vol. i, pp. 285\u2013347). The fourth part gives the history of El Q\u0101hirah (Cairo), the city founded by El Mu\u2018izz (vol. i, pp. 348\u2013496).\n\nThe second volume begins with the fifth part, which describes Cairo in the author\u2019s own time (vol. ii, pp. 1\u2013200). The sixth part is devoted to the citadel (vol. ii, pp. 201\u2013230).\n\nWhen, however, we look for the seventh part, announced by the author in his preface as \u201cthe causes that gave rise to the decay of Egypt,\u201d we do not find it in the second volume, nor, indeed, is this subject treated at length anywhere in the book, and therefore we must suppose that the author altered his intention after writing his preface. In its place we have a history of the Aiyubite and Mamluke kings (pp. 232\u2013246),\nfollowed by an account of the mosques, shrines, and tombs of Cairo and its vicinity, properly belonging, it would appear, to the part 5 of the author's preface (pp. 246-463). In this section there is an interlude on the various sects of Islam and an account of the different doctrines of that religion prevalent in Egypt at divers periods (pp. 331-360) which deserves notice.\n\nThe second volume ends with an account of the Jews and Christians of the country, with remarks on their creeds and places of worship (pp. 464-510), the latter being not much more than a list of names.\n\nEl Maqrizi's cosmography and geography has little special interest: the ancient history of Egypt in pre-Islamic times which he recites merely serves to show the state of ignorance prevalent in his day on the subject. The most interesting part of his first volume is that relating to the taxation of the country, and to its administration under the Fatimites. He gives us many details about the Khalifs of that dynasty, their palaces, treasures, ceremonials, and officers, which enable us to form a conception of the conditions of life in their day. His early history of the governors of Fustat and the semi-independent Tulunides and Ikhshidides is not so detailed as his account of the Fatimites, but still most valuable and interesting. His accounts of Aiyubite and Mamluke history are much briefer, which need not be regretted, as information from other sources on these dynasties is abundant. Nevertheless, El Khit\u0101t furnishes us with a considerable amount of miscellaneous information relating to the Mamlukes, among which an account of the principal officers of their state is very useful.\n\nThe great feature of the book which has gained it its wide reputation and its place as a standard classic is its topography of Cairo and its account of the monuments of that town and its earlier neighbour Fustat. All the sites in Cairo and its vicinity are treated of with considerable\nMost of the quarters, streets, lanes, and bazaars of the writer's day are noticed, besides the principal buildings, such as mosques, houses of consequence, baths, and the like, down to shrines and tombs of small importance.\n\nOn the subject of El Maqrizi's topography it may be remarked that his description of Misr el Fustat (Old Cairo), the traces of which were rapidly disappearing at his epoch, is brief and incomplete. And as to his description of what was in existence in his own time, indications are not wanting of absence of system in its composition. Streets and buildings of a certain amount of importance are omitted from the special descriptions, though incidental reference to them demonstrates their existence and that El Maqrizi could have told us something of them. Concerning other monuments, certainly in existence when he wrote, his silence is absolute.\n\nA far more serious defect is the vagueness of his terms of direction. He is unable to define a direction with precision, and rarely gives a distance or a dimension. Also in many cases he tells us almost nothing about the places he mentions, and when he does give us a little information about edifices it often happens that it is impossible to locate them owing to the disappearance of landmarks and the ambiguity of the terms in which he states their position.\n\nIn spite of the above, the diligence and learning of the writer of El Khitat cannot but command admiration. He has accumulated and reduced to a certain amount of order a large quantity of information that would but for him have passed into oblivion. He is generally painstaking and accurate, and always resorts to contemporary evidence if it is available. Also he has a pleasant and lucid style, and writes without bias and apparently with distinguished impartiality.\n\nOn the other hand, although El Maqrizi's arrangement of El Khitat is probably a great improvement on that of the works of his predecessors, it still leaves much to be desired. The book is a collection of articles rather than a continuous whole; history is mixed up with archaeology, so that neither do we get a complete history nor a clear\ntopography. El Maqrizi was to a great extent wanting in the critical faculty, and usually copies without comment. He also often lacks a sense of proportion, and will spend as long describing an insignificant shrine as in giving an account of the Grand Pyramid. Further, his accounts are often not worked out: he fails us just where we should like to know more, content to give a few facts about a subject without trying to give a complete or even intelligible description of it.\n\nTherefore El Khit\u0101t, valuable as it is, must be regarded more as a collection of materials for an Egyptian history and a topography of Cairo than as work that can give a clear account of them.\n\nIn this relation it is of the greatest importance, because its writer had access to practically all the authorities of consequence on the subject who preceded him, and more than three-quarters of the works of these have been lost. Fortunately El Maqrizi is usually careful to quote the sources from which he derives his statements, and this gives his book an increased value. Hence we are able to form an estimate of its reliability, and also to get an idea of the scope of many lost works which can be checked from other sources. The following rough list is intended to show the chief authorities on which El Khit\u0101t is based, and also to give some idea of El Maqrizi\u2019s library and the verbal sources of his information. It has been thought better to retain the names of the early traditionists, although their sayings were probably in all cases collected by authors at a time long subsequent to their deaths; also the names of authors of works other than historical or who are obviously quoted at second-hand have still been given a place in the list. It will be observed that the principal authorities, whose names are printed in capital letters, only amount to about twenty, but they appear to include all Arabic works of real importance on Egypt, or on Cairene topography and history at any rate, except one, that of Ibn Abi'l Barak\u0101t, which El Maqrizi had probably never seen, as I cannot find it referred to except in his preface.\nThe list does not pretend to be in any way exhaustive. It is quite characteristic of the East that the B\u016bl\u0101q edition of El Kh\u012btat is printed without an index, and to make a thoroughly exhaustive list of the authors cited in it would require more labour than the writer is able to give, or perhaps than the subject deserves. If El Kh\u012btat appears in a new edition the least that can be expected is that it will be provided with a proper index.\n\nMeanwhile, it is hoped that the following list may be of service in giving a fair idea of the chief authorities employed by El Maqr\u012bz\u012b, and enabling reference to be made to the subjects to which they refer, and be of general assistance to readers of the book.\n\nIbn Abb\u0101s. \u2018Abdull\u0101h. \u202068 A.H.

Es Sirah ez.\n\nThe following is the sequence of El Maqrizi\u2019s principal authorities: Ibn \u2018Abd el Hakam, \u2020 257 A.H., El Mas\u02bf\u016bdi; \u2020 346 A.H., Ibn Y\u016bnus, \u2020 347 A.H., and El Kindi, \u2020 350 A.H.\nIbn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn and Ibn Y\u016bnus supply nearly all that is known of the conquest and early history of Egypt. It appears they have collected the sayings of the early historians. El Kindi's information is in great part geographical, but that of El Kindi chiefly topographical.\n\nThere is also the anonymous life of Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn, which may be assumed to be by a contemporary (c. 879 A.H.). If so, he is one of the earliest writers on Egyptian history. El Maqr\u012bz\u012b has taken up where Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn left off.\n\nDuring the Fatimid period, we have Ibn Zul\u0101q, \u1e62\u0101d\u012bq ibn \u1e24asan al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b, \u2020420 A.H., El Qud\u0101\u02bei, \u2020457 A.H., an anonymous author of Sirat 'el Baz\u016br\u012b, of about the same date, Ibn el Ma\u02bem\u016bn, who probably wrote about 520 A.H., and El Jaww\u0101n\u012b, who was alive in 570 A.H., but who died before he witnessed in 539 A.H., thus enabling us to fix his period pretty closely.\n\nBoth El Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b and Ibn el Ma\u02bem\u016bn, being in high places, were exceptionally situated as regards information; their works, besides those of Ibn Zul\u0101q, were written in great part minutely detailed chronicles of their own times, but there is a gap between about 450 A.H. and 520 A.H., for which information seems meagre. This is confirmed by the statement of Hajji Khalifah to this effect: there is apparently no complete detailed record of the great events of the 4th-6th A.H., nor of the vizierate of Badr and \u1e62\u0101d\u012bq ibn \u1e24asan, written by a contemporary, or, at any rate, El Maqr\u012bz\u012b does not seem to have known of one. The works of El Qud\u0101\u02bei and El Jaww\u0101n\u012b were archaeological, referring to Cairo and Fustat.\n\nAs to the observances of the Fatimid Court, their government, and other details of the kind, El Maqr\u012bz\u012b appears to rely on El Jaww\u0101n\u012b, besides a book called Ed Dakh\u0101\u02beir on Egypt, which may date from the seventh century of the Hijra. We shall in general it would seem that his remarks on these subjects were taken from authors living a considerable time after the Fatimid period.\nAfter this comes El Q\u0101\u1e0di \u2019l F\u0101\u1e0dil, \u2020 596 A.H., from whom much has been taken, nearly all relating to matters of which he had personal knowledge; then Ibn \u2018Abd ez Z\u0101hir, \u2020 692 A.H., and Ibn el Mutauwaj, \u2020 730 A.H. The last-mentioned relates almost exclusively to Mi\u1e63r, i.e. Old Cairo, and all three are mostly referred to on questions of topography. Ibn el Mutauwaj is the last author of importance frequently quoted by El Maqr\u012bz\u012b, who does not really give us very much detailed history of the Aiyubite and Mamluke period in El Kh\u012b\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d. The works of nearly all the authors mentioned in the foregoing have now been lost, either wholly or for the most part, but from the frequent quotations that are made from them in El Kh\u012b\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d, it is fair to suppose that its author had access to them all.\n\nIn addition to these the remarks of Ibn Sa\u2018id, \u2020 685 A.H., are amusing, besides being interesting, as the impressions of a stranger visiting a foreign country. These, too, would probably have been lost to us without El Maqr\u012bz\u012b\u2019s intervention, and, when we consider the enormous labour that he must have spent upon his book, and how much he has preserved to us, we can realize the extent of the service which he has rendered to the history of Egypt.\nART. VII.\u2014Note on the Languages spoken between the Assam Valley and Tibet. By Sten Konow, of the University of Christiania, Norway.\n\nThe mountainous region between the Assam Valley and Tibet, from Bhutan in the west to the Brahmaputra in the east, is inhabited by a series of tribes which are all of Tibeto-Burman stock.\n\nBeginning from the west, they are the Akas, the Dafl\u0101s, the Abor-Miris, and the various Mishmi tribes, viz., Chuli-kat\u0101, Dig\u0101ru, and Mij\u016b Mishmi.\n\nOur chief sources for the knowledge of the dialects spoken by these tribes are as follows:\n\nHesselmeyer, C.

[Shillong.]\n\nThe dialects in question may conveniently be classed together as the North Assam Group of Tibeto-Burman\nlanguages, and in the remarks which follow I shall try to throw some light on their relation to each other and to connected forms of speech.\n\nThe dialects spoken by the Dafl\u0101s and the Abor-Miris are closely related to each other, and their vocabulary, to some extent, agrees with that of Mishmi. Aka, on the other hand, has a different and very peculiar appearance. Strange and radical phonetical laws have been at work in that dialect, and it is, in most cases, very difficult to compare it with other Tibeto-Burman languages. The grammatical structure, however, is exactly the same as in the languages of the surrounding tribes, and there is also a considerable number of words which can be traced in other Tibeto-Burman languages. Thus, Aka \u0101\u016b, Dafl\u0101 \u0101-bo, father; Aka \u0101-ni, Dafl\u0101 \u0101n, mother; Aka ang\u0101-s\u0101, Meithei angang and ma-ch\u0101, child; Aka nyu, Kuki-Chin nai and nau, younger brother or sister; Aka l\u016b, Tibetan blo, Lush\u0113i lung, mind; Aka e-nyi, Dafl\u0101 a-nyi, eye; Aka nus\u016b, Tibetan sna, nose; Aka khie, Tibetan mgo, Burmese khaung, head; Aka khe-chu, Burmese chham, hair of head; Aka mi, Tibetan me, fire; Aka \u03c7\u016b, Tibetan chhu, water; Aka ju, Singph\u014d jan, sun; Aka cchi, Tibetan \u0148i, fish; Aka ts\u0101u, Tibetan za-ba, Burmese ts\u0101, eat; Aka th\u016b, Tibetan a-thung-ba, Dafl\u0101 t\u016b, drink; Aka ji, Dafl\u0101 ji, give; Aka l\u0101u, Meithei l\u0101u, take; and so forth.\n\nAll the dialects in question agree in some points. The differences between them, on the other hand, are considerable, and they do not form a distinct linguistic group. They have been classed together because they are all intermediary between Tibetan and the Assam-Burmese languages of the Tibeto-Burman family, and because the tribes speaking them are found in the same locality. The group, therefore, is both a geographical and a linguistic one.\n\nIn order to understand the position of these dialects and their relation to other Tibeto-Burman languages it will be necessary to go into details. It is, however, difficult to do so, because our knowledge of them, and especially of Aka and Mishmi, is very limited. The remarks which follow are therefore given with every reserve. Their reliability\nis dependent on the trustworthiness of our materials. They do not extend to the whole grammatical structure, because a comparison of the various dialects would, in many cases, be uncertain. I have confined myself to some remarks on the numerals, the personal pronouns, and a few grammatical features.\n\nThe first five numerals are:\n\n| Aka | Dafl\u0101 | Miri | Chulikat\u0101 | Dig\u0101ru | Mij\u016b |\n|-----|-------|------|-----------|--------|------|\n| One | \u0101     | akkin | \u0101-k\u0101, \u0101-t\u0113r | e-khe | \u0113-khing | ko-mo |\n| Two | ksh\u012b  | a-nyi | \u0101-nyi | k\u0101-ni | k\u0101-ying | k\u0101-ning |\n| Three | tz\u016b | n-om | \u0101-\u016bm | k\u0101-sh | k\u0101-s\u0101ng | k\u0101-s\u0101m |\n| Four | pf\u0101-r\u012b | a-pl(i) | \u0101-pi | k\u0101-ppi | k\u0101-prei | kam-brin |\n| Five | pom | \u0101-ng(\u014d) | \u0101-ng\u0101 | m\u0101-ng\u0101 | m\u0101-ng\u0101 | ka-l\u012bn |\n\nOne.\u2014The forms in Dafl\u0101, Chulikat\u0101, and Dig\u0101ru are practically identical. Aka \u0101 corresponds to Miri \u0101-k\u0101, Meithei a-m\u0101, Kachin ai-m\u0101, etc. Mij\u016b ko-m\u014d perhaps corresponds to the forms occurring in the other Mishmi dialects and Dafl\u0101. The final m\u014d must be compared with m\u0101 in Meithei a-m\u0101, Kachin ai-m\u0101, etc.\n\nTwo.\u2014Aka ksh\u012b is probably derived from k\u00f1\u012b; compare Aka chhi, Tibetan \u014bi, fish. The prefix k is identical with Mishmi k\u0101, and corresponds to Tibetan g in g\u016bs, two. Dafl\u0101 and Miri use a prefix \u0101 like many Central and Eastern N\u0101g\u0101 dialects.\n\nThree.\u2014Mishmi, and probably also Aka, have a prefix k\u0101 corresponding to g in Tibetan gsum, three. Dafl\u0101 and Miri prefix \u0101. Compare \u2018Two.\u2019\n\nFour.\u2014All dialects apparently contain a numeral li or ri with a suffix pa or p, corresponding to b in Tibetan b\u015bi, four; \u1e6du in Lepcha; b and bi in the Bodo languages; ba and pa in many N\u0101g\u0101 dialects, and pa in Kuki-Chin. To this p\nMishmi prefixes *k\u0101* or *kam*. The numeral *li* or *ri* also occurs in Lepcha and most Assam-Burmese languages, while Tibetan has *\u015bi*.\n\n**Five.**\u2014Mij\u016b *ka-\u015bin* seems to correspond to Tibetan *linga* with *ka* prefixed. Aka *pom* is probably derived from *pa-nga*. The prefix *pa* has already been mentioned with \u2018Four.\u2019 *Ma* in Chulikat\u0101 and Dig\u0101ru *ma-ng\u0101*, five, corresponds to the prefix *ma* in the numeral \u2018five\u2019 in Kachin, Meithe\u012b, Lh\u014d\u1e6da, Miklai, Thukumi, and most N\u0101g\u0101-Bodo dialects.\n\nThe higher numerals, twenty, thirty, etc., are formed by prefixing \u2018two,\u2019 \u2018three,\u2019 and so on to the numeral \u2018ten\u2019 in Aka and Mishmi, while Dafl\u0101 and Miri suffix the multiplier after the pattern \u2018tens-two,\u2019 \u2018tens-three,\u2019 etc. Tibetan, Kachin, Burmese, Mikir, and other dialects agree with Aka and Mishmi, while Lepcha, the Kuki-Chin, and most N\u0101g\u0101 languages form their higher numerals in the same way as Dafl\u0101 and Miri.\n\nGeneric prefixes are used with numerals in the Bodo languages, some N\u0101g\u0101 dialects such as Mikir and Emp\u0113\u014d, and the Kuki-Chin group. They are also used in Dafl\u0101 and Miri. Compare the generic suffixes in Burmese. Mishmi, and probably also Aka, agree with Tibetan where the numerals are used without such qualifying affixes.\n\nThe preceding remarks will have shown that the numerals in Aka and Mishmi are more closely connected with those usual in Tibetan than the forms occurring in Dafl\u0101 and Miri. These latter dialects in important points agree with the Bodo, N\u0101g\u0101, and Kuki-Chin languages. All dialects in question agree with the Assam-Burmese languages in the form of the numeral \u2018four.\u2019\n\nI now turn to the personal pronoun *I*. Aka, Dafl\u0101, Miri, and Chulikat\u0101 have forms which are identical with or derived from Tibetan and Burmese *nga*. The Dig\u0101ru pronoun *ha*, I, is probably derived from the same form. Compare Meithe\u012b *ai* and Khoir\u0101o *hai*. It is probable that the forms beginning with *h* are due to an aspiration of the initial *ng*, corresponding to the aspirated pronunciation of soft consonants in Eastern Tibet. A strong aspiration might\nwell supersede the rest of the consonant in the pronunciation. A similar interchange between ng and h occurs in dialects of Khami. Mij\u016b ki corresponds to kei in the Kuki-Chin languages. It is probably derived from nga, ngha; compare Kachin ngai. This derivation is based on the supposition that an aspirated ng might become gh and, farther, k. Compare the aspirated soft consonants in Eastern Tibet, which can scarcely be distinguished from the corresponding hard sounds. In the same way we find Ang\u0101mi ko corresponding to \u0100o ngo, fish.\n\nThou.\u2014Dafl\u0101, Miri, and Mishmi have the forms n\u00e1 and ny\u00e1, corresponding to Ang\u0101mi no and similar forms in many Assam-Burmese languages. Aka b\u0101 seems to correspond to b\u0101 in Sir George Campbell\u2019s Hati Garya.\n\nThe personal pronouns of the third person differ in most dialects. All forms are originally demonstrative pronouns, and corresponding ones are found in the neighbouring languages. Thus, Miri and Dafl\u0101 bui corresponds to bi, b\u00e9, and similar forms in Bodo, po in Ang\u0101mi, etc.; Aka i and \u00ea, and Dig\u0101ru \u00ea to a, that, in Tibetan and other connected forms of speech; Dafl\u0101 ma to m\u0101 in the Kuki-Chin dialects; Dig\u0101ru he to h\u00e9, this, in Lush\u0113i and connected languages; and Mij\u016b ve to Garo u\u0113, Arung wi, he, etc.\n\nWe shall now proceed to make some remarks on the formation and inflection of words.\n\nA vocalic prefix which occurs in various forms such as a, e, i, o, and u, is apparently used in all dialects, perhaps with the exception of Mij\u016b. It is not, like the Burmese prefix a, used to form nouns of action from verbs, but is very common before nouns, and also before adjectives, apparently without adding anything to the meaning. It is probably identical with the prefix a in N\u0101g\u0101 and Kuki-Chin languages, in Lepcha, and in Tibetan words such as \u2019a-pha, father; \u2019a-ma, mother. In Aka it is identical in form with the personal pronoun of the third person, and it is perhaps originally a pronominal prefix.\n\nDafl\u0101, Miri, and Mishmi also use a prefix ka before adjectives, as do also the Bodo, N\u0101g\u0101, and Kachin languages.\nGender is distinguished in the same way as in all connected languages by using separate words or adding suffixes. Many of the suffixes of gender are identical with those occurring in neighboring dialects. Thus, the usual male suffix is *-a* or *-a*, corresponding to Tibetan *pa* and *po* and similar forms in other Tibeto-Burman languages. The forms *wa* and *wa* correspond to Kachin *wa* and the pronoun *wa* or *wa* after vowels in Tibetan.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Daila and Miri repeat the same nouns or the last syllable of them, before the suffixes of gender. The same principle also prevails in\n\nThe genitive is formed by prefixing the governed to the governing noun. Aka often repeats the governed noun by prefixing a possessive pronoun prefixed to the governing noun. The same principle largely prevails in the Kuki-Chin languages. Daila and Miri possess a genitive suffix *ka*, corresponding to Tibetan *tya*, Meithei *gi*, etc. The same nouns form their locative by adding a suffix *la*, which is similar to the Tibetan dative suffix *lo*.\n\nThe suffix of the comparative in Daila and Miri is *ya*, which corresponds to *ya* and *ya* in many Kuki-Chin dialects.\n\nIn regard to the inflection of verbs, it is of importance to note that all languages, perhaps with the exception of Daila, use the same verb substantive in the formation of\n\nThe various forms of this verb all correspond to Tibetan *-ayat*, which is used in the\n\nDaila and some other languages also Daila agree with Mikir in the formation of the future; the suffixes *ye* and *piu* in Miri correspond to Tibetan *i* and *po*. Compare also the suffixes *-a* and *-a* in Angami and *phu* in Burmese, *-a* and apparently also Digaru, often use different suffixes in the negative future, as is also the case in Angami.\n\nThe suffix of the negative future in Miri is *ge*, which is used in a similar negative sense in Digaru, while Mijju *yu* corresponds to Miri *ye*. This latter suffix is always used together with *ye* in Aka. Compare the\nsuffix *nhi\u00e0* which forms a future of doubt in Ang\u0101mi, and\nthe future suffix *ngi* in Sem\u0101, etc.\n\nThe suffixes of the conjunctive participle are *na* and *la*\nor similar forms in Aka, Dafl\u0101, and Miri. No instances are\navailable for Mishmi. Compare Tibetan *na* and *la* and\nsimilar forms in many other connected languages. Compare\nalso the Tibetan case suffixes *la* and *na*.\n\nThe formation of causatives is only known in Dafl\u0101 and\nMiri, where the verb \u2018to do,\u2019 *ma* and *m\u014d*, respectively, is\nsuffixed to the principal verb. Compare the prefixed *ma*,\n*man*, etc., in the Old Kuki dialects. The causative in Aka\nis probably formed in the same way as in Tibetan. Thus,\nin *sh\u016b*, to kill, from *dz\u016b*, to die, we find the causative formed\nafter the pattern intransitive *g*, transitive *kh*.\n\nThe negative particle is *m\u0101* or *m\u0101\u1e45* in all dialects with\nthe exception of Dig\u0101ru, where it is *im*. This *im* is, however,\nprobably derived from the same original. The negative is\nprefixed to the verb in Aka and Mij\u016b, but suffixed in Dafl\u0101,\nMiri, and Dig\u0101ru. There are no instances available in\nChulikat\u0101. Aka and Mij\u016b agree with Tibetan, Kachin,\nBurmese, Central N\u0101g\u0101, etc., while the suffixed negative\nis found in Kuki-Chin, Western N\u0101g\u0101, N\u0101g\u0101-Bodo, N\u0101g\u0101-\nKuki, and Bodo. The negative particle *m\u0101* is identical\nwith Tibetan and Burmese *ma*. The forms *m\u0101\u1e45* in Miri\nand *im* in Dig\u0101ru may perhaps contain this *ma* prefixed\nto some verb substantive. Compare Tibetan *med-pa*, for\n*mi-yod-pa*, not-to-be. The suffixed negative is perhaps\nderived from a compound verb of this kind. It is, however,\nalso possible that the position of the negative in the Tibeto-\nBurman languages was originally freer than it is now.\n\nWe may note that the usual tense suffixes are often\ndropped in the negative mood, as is also the case in\nBurmese and other connected languages.\n\nIt will be seen from the preceding remarks that all the\ndialects in question have several points of analogy with\nother Tibeto-Burman languages.\n\nThey agree with Tibetan in the use of the same verb\nsubstantive in order to form a periphrastic present.\nA prefix \\(a\\), \\(e\\), \\(i\\), etc., is used in the same way as the corresponding prefix \\(a\\) in Tibetan and most of the Tibeto-Burman languages of Assam, while the peculiar use of the prefix \\(a\\) in Kachin and Burmese seems to be foreign to them.\n\nThe conjunctive participle is formed by means of the same suffixes as in Tibetan and the languages of Assam.\n\nThe numeral 'four' agrees with the forms used in the Assam-Burmese languages.\n\nThe prefixes are apparently, to a great extent, full syllables, as is the case in the Assam-Burmese languages. Our materials are not, however, sufficient for entering into this question.\n\nAll these points seem to show that the North Assam dialects are intermediary between Tibetan and Burmese, or, more correctly, between Tibetan and the Tibeto-Burman languages of Assam.\n\nTheir position would be easier to define if we had sufficient information regarding the existence of tones. We know that several tones exist in Dafl\u0101, Miri, and Mishmi, and the same is probably the case in Aka. This fact seems to show that they are more closely connected with Tibetan than with Burmese. The same conclusion must be derived from the fact that initial soft consonants occur to a considerable extent, while they are changed to hard sounds in Burmese.\n\nAll the dialects in question differ to a great extent in vocabulary. This is especially the case with Aka, while the Mishmi dialects in many points agree with Miri and Dafl\u0101, as will be seen from the comparison of a few words:\n\n- **arrow**: Dig\u0101ru \\(m-p\u016b\\); Dafl\u0101 \\(\u014d-p\u016b\\).\n- **blood**: Mij\u016b \\(ui\\); Dafl\u0101 \\(\u016bi\\).\n- **brother**: Dig\u0101ru \\(n\u0101-p\u016b\\); Dafl\u0101 \\(a-b\u016b\\).\n- **dark**: Dig\u0101ru \\(k\u0101-n\u014d-\u0101\\); Dafl\u0101 \\(k\u0101n\\).\n- **die**: Dig\u0101ru \\(s\u012b\\); Dafl\u0101 and Miri \\(s\u012b\\).\n- **dog**: Dig\u0101ru \\(n-kw\u012b\\); Dafl\u0101 \\(i-ki\\); Miri \\(\u0113-ki\\).\n- **dream**: Dig\u0101ru \\(y\u0101m\u014d\\); Dafl\u0101 \\(y\u016bmr\u0101\\).\ndrink . . Dig\u0101ru tum; Dafl\u0101 tu; Miri t\u016bng.\neat . . Dig\u0101ru dh\u0101; Dafl\u0101 da; Miri d\u0101.\nfeather . . Dig\u0101ru am; Dafl\u0101 am.\nflower . .

They show that there are a considerable amount of common words in Mishmi and Dafl\u0101-Miri. These dialects also agree in the use of the prefix ka with adjectives, in the personal pronoun of the second person, and other points. Dig\u0101ru also agrees with Dafl\u0101 and Miri in the use of a suffixed negative, while Mij\u016b, like Aka, prefixes the negative to the verb.\n\nThe Mishmi dialects cannot, however, be classed as closely related to Dafl\u0101 and Miri. They sometimes also agree with Aka as against the central dialects.\n\nThus, they use a prefix ka in the numerals 'two' and 'three,' as is also the case in Aka and Tibetan. They form the higher numerals as in Tibetan, Kachin, Burmese, etc., after the pattern 'three-tens,' and they do not use generic prefixes before numerals.\n\nThe Mishmi dialects also, in some points, agree with Kachin. Thus, the numeral 'five' takes a prefix ma as in Kachin, Meithei, and some N\u0101g\u0101 dialects, and the usual prefixes m and n in Mishmi and Kachin are probably identical. There is also some connection between them in vocabulary. Thus, we find Dig\u0101ru n\u0101-p\u016b, Kachin ph\u016b, brother; Mij\u016b b\u0101ng, Kachin m\u2019b\u0101, cloth; Mij\u016b and Kachin manchu, cow; Mij\u016b and Kachin sha, eat; Mij\u016b mi, Kachin\nmi, eye; Mij\u016b s\u0101t, Kachin sat, kill; Mij\u016b s\u00fc-lap, Kachin lap, leaf; Mij\u016b and Kachin k\u0101p, shoot; Mij\u016b laung, Kachin n\u2019l\u0101ng, stone; Mij\u016b ph\u0101t, Kachin m\u2019phat, vomit; Mij\u016b m\u2019bong, Kachin m\u2019b\u016bng, wind; etc.\n\nThe proportion of common words does not, however, appear to be great.\n\nThe central dialects, Miri and Dafl\u0101, agree with several of the neighbouring forms of speech. The reduplication of the nouns before the suffixes of gender is also common in Kachin. The prefixes before the first numerals are the same as those used in some Central and Eastern N\u0101g\u0101 dialects. The formation of the higher numerals is the same as in the Kuki-Chin and most N\u0101g\u0101 languages. Generic prefixes with numerals are used in the same way as in the Bodo, some N\u0101g\u0101, and the Kuki-Chin languages. Compare the generic suffixes in Burmese. The comparative suffix is the same as that occurring in some Kuki-Chin languages. Some tense suffixes are common to Miri-Dafl\u0101 and Mikir, and so forth.\n\nThe result of the above may be summed up as follows:\n\nThe dialects in question occupy an intermediate position between Tibetan and the Tibeto-Burman languages of Assam. They agree with Tibetan in important points, but differ in others in the same way as the connected languages of Assam and Burma.\n\nWe can only account for this relationship by the supposition that the tribes in question were gradually driven into their present homes from a locality where the different branches of the Tibeto-Burman family were in mutual contact. This points to the country about the headwaters of the Irawaddy and Chindwin rivers as the locality from which the North Assam tribes crossed the Brahmaputra and wandered westward to their present habitat.\n\nThe dialects under consideration cannot be considered as one distinct group, and we must therefore conclude that the immigration into the mountains between the Assam valley and Tibet extended over a considerable period, the various tribes having crossed the Brahmaputra at different times.\nThe mountainous region which is their home may be considered as a backwater that was gradually filled up from the great Tibeto-Burman current which, in the course of time, split up and flowed into Tibet and Further India.\n\nThe Akas are probably the first immigrants, and have lived isolated in their mountains for a considerable time. This would account for the strange appearance of their vocabulary, and also for the many points of analogy with Tibetan.\n\nThe Miris and Daflas must have had intercourse with the tribes now known as Kachin, Kuki-Chin, N\u0101g\u0101, and Bodo, before they reached their present homes. The Mishmis have more affinity to Tibetan, but are also akin to the Kachins. The Western Mishmis, the Dig\u0101rus, and Chuli-kat\u0101s have also been influenced by their western neighbours, the Miris and Daflas, and perhaps also by the Tibeto-Burman tribes of Assam.\nART. VIII.\u2014Kusin\u0101r\u0101, or Kusinagara, and other Buddhist Holy Places. By Vincent A. Smith, M.R.A.S., late of the Indian Civil Service.\n\nForty years ago Sir Alexander Cunningham, adopting a hint given by Professor H. H. Wilson, identified the Buddhist remains near Kasi\u0101 in the Gorakhpur District as marking the site of Ku\u015binagara, or Kusin\u0101r\u0101, the traditional scene of the death of Gautama Buddha.\n\nThe discovery in 1875\u201376 by Mr. Carlleyle among the ruins near Kasi\u0101 of a colossal recumbent statue of Buddha, which corresponded closely with Hiuen Tsiang\u2019s description of a similar statue at Ku\u015binagara, seemed to settle the question as to the identity of the site. Archaeological writers, the general public, and Buddhist pilgrims from Burma and Ceylon, all agreed in accepting as conclusive Sir Alexander Cunningham\u2019s announcement that the remains near Kasi\u0101 beyond doubt occupied the site of Ku\u015binagara. I shared the general belief, and felt no doubts on the subject until I made a special inquiry on the spot, and found the existing facts at Kasi\u0101 to be at variance with Cunningham\u2019s description and irreconcilable with the accounts of Ku\u015binagara given by the Chinese pilgrims. The results of my inquiry were published in 1896, and in the same year the true site of the Lumbini Garden, the traditional site of the birth of Gautama Buddha, was discovered. My local inquiry proved by means of topographical details that the remains near Kasi\u0101 could not possibly represent Ku\u015binagara as described.\n\n---\n\n1 Cunningham: Archaeological Survey Reports, vols. i, xviii, xxii.\n2 \u201cThe Remains near Kasi\u0101, in the Gorakhpur District, the Reputed Site of Ku\u015binagara or Ku\u015bin\u0101r\u0101, the Scene of Buddha\u2019s Death,\u201d by Vincent A. Smith, I.C.S., Fellow of the University of Allahabad. Allahabad: Printed at the North-Western Provinces and Oudh Government Press, 1896.\nby the Chinese pilgrims.\\footnote{Kusinagara is the form of the name which corresponds best with the Chinese notation, and is used by Mr. Takakusu in his translation of I-teing. Mr. Beal transliterates the Chinese as \\textit{Kiu-shi-na-k'ie-lo}. Mr. Giles writes \\textit{Ch\u00fc-i-na-chieh}. In P\u0101li the dental sibilant alone is used, and the name is invariably given in the form Kusin\u0101r\u016b.} The discovery of the true site of the Lumbini Garden proved that Ku\u015binagara, which was known to lie in a south-easterly direction from the garden, could not possibly be represented by the remains near Kasi\u0101, which lie a little west of south from the garden.\n\nThe irresistible force of the arguments in refutation of Cunningham's identification was at once admitted, and, so far as I am aware, nobody since 1896 has attempted to maintain the correctness of that identification. The purely negative result that the remains near Kasi\u0101 do not represent Ku\u015binagara was thus obtained and accepted, but no progress was made in affirmatively determining the position of the town which was the scene of Buddha's death. The few words, unsupported by argument, in which five years ago I indicated my belief as to the probable position of Ku\u015binagara could not be expected to command assent. Dr. Hoey has since endeavoured to locate Ku\u015binagara in the S\u0101ran District, far to the south, near the Ganges. The etymological foundation of his ingenious arguments, which ignore the testimony of the Chinese pilgrims, seems to me so insecure that I may be excused from the task of detailed criticism.\\footnote{\"On the Identification of Kusinara, Va\u015bali, and other places mentioned by the Chinese Pilgrims,\" by W. Hoey, Litt.D., I.C.S.: J.A.S.B., 1900, vol. lxix, pt. 1, p. 74.}\n\nThe question as to the true position of Ku\u015binagara is therefore still open, and the problem awaits solution. From time to time for seven years past I have devoted many hours and much labour to the search for a solution, and now publish the results of my investigation because there is no immediate prospect of the discovery of additional materials on which to form a judgment. I venture to think that an approximately correct solution of the problem is attainable by strict reasoning from the existing materials, and that this approximate solution involves the settlement of several doubtful points in the itineraries of the Chinese pilgrims.\nThe purpose of my investigation is simply to determine the position of the town which was shown in the fifth century to Fa-hien and in the seventh century to Huen Tsiang as being Ku\u015binagara, the reputed scene of Buddha's death. Whether Gautama Buddha really died at that town or not is a question beyond my province. I desire merely to ascertain the identity of the town visited by the two pilgrims, while abstaining from discussion of the authenticity of the holy places shown to them by their monkish guides.\n\nBoth pilgrims apparently visited the same place, and it is probable that the town shown to Fa-hien as Ku\u015binagara at the beginning of the fifth century is the same as that mentioned under the name of Kusin\u0101ra in the much earlier P\u0101li books. Those books certainly preserve a very ancient body of tradition, and we may safely believe, on their authority, that Gautama Buddha, the \u015a\u0101kya sage, really passed away at Kusin\u0101ra. The presumption is that the tradition of Buddha's death remained attached to one spot, and until good reason is shown for supposing that the traditional locality was shifted, we may assume the identity of the Chinese Ku\u015binagara and the P\u0101li Kusin\u0101ra.\n\nThe itineraries of the Chinese pilgrims give bearings and distances from which the position of Kusinagara can be deduced, whereas the geographical indications given by the P\u0101li books are not sufficient to determine the position of Kusin\u0101ra. Therefore, in order to ascertain the position of the traditional scene of Buddha's death, it is desirable to begin with the detailed accounts of the late Chinese pilgrims rather than with the indeterminate indications of the early P\u0101li writers, and thus to proceed from the known to the unknown.\n\nProfessor Rhys Davids, on the other hand, would apparently prefer to take the ancient P\u0101li books as the starting-point for the investigation, and to treat the Chinese records as of secondary importance.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 [I must be allowed to enter a mild protest against this reading of my views. They are expressed, perhaps not clearly, in the words immediately quoted. In discussing historically the archaeological remains at any ascertained spot the\nKUSIN\u0100RA OR KU\u015aINAGARA.\n\n\"It is a pity,\" he observes, \"that Indian archaeologists ignore the details given in the most ancient records concerning the places they attempt to identify. Before writing about Kusin\u0101ra, it would seem almost a matter of course that not only the descriptions of a traveller in the seventh century A.D., but also all that can be gathered from the words\u2014at least a thousand years older\u2014of the Pali Pitakas, should be in the writer's mind. We there learn from Mah\u0101va\u1e45ga, vi, 34-38,1 that the Buddha journeyed along the following route: Ves\u0101li, Bhaddiya-nagara, \u0100\u1e37\u0101pa\u1e47a, Kusin\u0101ra, \u0100\u1e6dum\u0101, S\u0101vatthi. The contrary route from S\u0101vatthi to Ves\u0101li is given at Sutta Nip\u0101ta, p. 185. The name of the grove of S\u0101l\u0101-trees under which the Buddha died is the Upavatt\u0101na, 'on the further side of the river Hiranyavat\u012b' ('Buddhist Suttas,' S.B.E., xi, p. 85); and the route by which it was reached was Ves\u0101li, Bha\u1e47\u1e0dag\u0101ma, Amba g\u0101ma, Jambu-g\u0101ma, Bhoga-nagara, P\u0101v\u0101 (these two last also mentioned in the same order in the Sutta Nip\u0101ta, p. 185), and across the river Kaku\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101 to Kusin\u0101ra ('Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 64-74, 89). There is no reference in the oldest texts to its being a walled town; it is called a 'wattle and daub town, a village in the midst of the jungle' (ibid., pp. 100, 248). Other references are Anguttara, 2. 274; Ud\u0101na, p. 37.\" 2\n\nThis criticism would be unanswerable if it were possible, independently of the Chinese pilgrims, to identify the rivers Kaku\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101 and Hiranyavat\u012b and the various villages named. But, unfortunately, the efforts which I have repeatedly made to effect these identifications have failed, and at present no helpful guidance is to be found in the P\u0101li books. The enquirer is therefore forced to rely upon the itineraries of the Chinese pilgrims in order to ascertain the position of the town Kusinagara visited by them, which was probably identical with the Kusin\u0101ra of the P\u0101li writers. The\n\n[The writer should consider all the evidence, and not ignore that preserved in the books. I have not said, and assuredly do not think, that the evidence afforded by the Chinese pilgrims, or any other evidence, is of secondary importance.\n\nIn the attempt to fix upon a doubtful site, that of the Chinese is of especial value, as it is the Chinese who give bearings and distances. If a book put together many centuries before the Chinese writers visited the spot should happen also (which such books, alas! very seldom do) to give bearings or distances, then these also should be considered and due weight attached to them, and Mr. Vincent Smith does this.\u2014Rn. D.]\n\n1 \"Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. xiii, pp. 121-143.\n2 J.R.A.S., Oct., 1897, p. 920.\ninsignificant village which seems to have existed in the time of Gautama Buddha may easily have become a walled town in the long interval of about twelve hundred years between the death of Buddha and the visit of Hiuen Tsiang, who found the town almost deserted and the walls in ruins.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrims give three distinct bearings, with distances, for Kusinagara. These bearings are (1) in an easterly direction from the Lumbini Garden; (2) in a north-westerly direction from Vais\u0101li; and (3) in a northeasterly direction from Benares, or the kingdom of Benares.\n\nThe positions of the Lumbini Garden, Vais\u0101li, and Benares being now all known with certainty, it would seem at first sight that no problem exists, and that the position of Kusinagara could be readily determined by drawing three lines on a map and noting their point of intersection. But, as a matter of fact, the problem exists, and is one of considerable complexity.\n\nThe Lumbini Garden is now represented by the mound of ruins at Rummind\u0113i, which is situated in the Nepalese Tar\u0101i, about five or six miles nearly due north of Dulh\u0101 House in the Bast\u012b District of the North-Western Provinces, and approximately in E. long. $83^\\circ 20'$, N. lat. $27^\\circ 29'$. The spot, although not marked on the map, may be easily noted on the edge of Sheet 102 of the Indian Atlas, at a distance of about four miles north of the frontier and half a mile west of the Til\u0101r river, which is marked on the map.\n\nIn a subsequent paper I hope to discuss the remains at and near Bas\u0101r in the Muzaffarpur District of Bih\u0101r, which occupy the site of Vais\u0101li. These remains lie approximately in E. long. $85^\\circ 11'$ and N. lat. $25^\\circ 58'$. I cannot stop now to prove the identity of Bas\u0101r with Vais\u0101li, and must ask my readers to accept the assurance that the identification is certain.\n\nThe position of Benares is defined as being in E. long. $83^\\circ 3' 4''$ and N. lat. $25^\\circ 18' 31''$. Kusinagara, therefore, should be sought in an easterly direction from the Lumbini Garden, E. long. $83^\\circ 20'$, N. lat. $27^\\circ 29'$; north-westerly direction from Vais\u0101li (Bas\u0101r), E. long. $85^\\circ 11'$, N. lat.\nA glance at the map will show that the Ku\u015binagara of the Chinese pilgrims must consequently lie between 84\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 E. long., and 27\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 N. lat. The resulting rectangle lies to the extent of about three quarters in the hills of Nepal, and to the extent of about one quarter in the Camp\u0101ran District of Bihar. The portion of the rectangle which falls within the limits of the Bankeipur District is inconsiderable. The towns of Lumbini (Nawangarh), Navadurgarh) stand on the southern boundary parallel of the rectangle, which includes the town of Ch\u0101nd\u012b Bazar and the towns of R\u0101mnagar and S\u0101h\u0101r\u0101 in the Bankeipur District. The site of Ku\u015binagara is therefore either in Bankeipur District or in the Camp\u0101ran District at a distance of a few miles from the foot of the hills.\n\nThe distances given by the pilgrims from each of the four points, the Lumbini Garden, Vais\u0101l\u012b, and Kusinagara, are examined in order to fix with greater accuracy the site sought.\n\nThe distance Ku\u015binagara relative to the fixed point of Lumbini Garden is defined as follows by Fa-hien,\n\n\"...from the garden, and at a distance of five leagues there is a place called R\u0101ma.\" After describing the place where the heirloom horse was white horse; and there\n\n\"...four leagues to the east from this, there is a Ch\u0101nd\u012b tope, where there is also\n\n\"...from the garden, and at a distance of five leagues there is a place called R\u0101ma.\" His other distances are quoted as \"proceeding... again going twelve yojanas...\" He gives the name of...\nIn tabular form Fa-hien's itinerary may be thus expressed:\n\n| From            | To               | Direction     | Distance |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|\n| Lumbini Garden  | R\u0101magr\u0101ma        | Easterly      | 5 yojanas|\n| R\u0101magr\u0101ma       | Cand\u0101ka's return | ,,            | 3 ,,     |\n| Cand\u0101ka's return| Ashes st\u016bpa     | ,,            | 4 ,,     |\n| Ashes st\u016bpa     | Ku\u015binagara       | ,,            | Total 12 ,, |\n|                 |                  |               |          |\n| Grand total, from Lumbini Garden to Ku\u015binagara, 24 yojanas |\n\nTaking the yojana as equal to about 7\u00bd miles, the distance from the Lumbini Garden to Ku\u015binagara by road was about 180 English miles. The easterly direction must, of course, in accordance with Fa-hien's usual practice, be interpreted in a very wide sense, as meaning any direction east of a north and south meridian.\n\nHiuen Tsiang followed the same route as his predecessor, and notes the same stages:\n\n| From            | To               | Direction     | Distance |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|\n| Lumbini Garden  | R\u0101magr\u0101ma        | East          | 200 li or so.\u00b9 |\n| R\u0101magr\u0101ma       | Cand\u0101ka's return | ,,            | About 100 li.\u00b2 |\n| Cand\u0101ka's return| Ashes st\u016bpa     | South-east    | 180 or 190 li.\u00b3 |\n| Ashes st\u016bpa     | Ku\u015binagara       | North-east    | Not stated (\"A dangerous and difficult road\").\u2074 |\n\n\u00b9 \"Ashes pagoda\" by Giles. R\u00e9musat (Laidlay) calls the same monument \"Tower of the Charcoal,\" and agrees with Giles and Beal in giving three yojanas as the distance between R\u0101ma and the place of Cand\u0101ka's return. The preponderance of authority is, therefore, in favour of the shorter distance, which is also supported by Hiuen Tsiang's estimate of the distance as 100 li, equivalent to 2\u00bd yojanas.\n\n\u00b2 \"Environ deux cents li\" (Julien). The \"300 li or so\" of Beal is evidently an error. Hiuen Tsiang reckoned 40 li to the yojana. His distance and direction, therefore, agree with those of Fa-hien.\n\n\u00b3 100 li = 2\u00bd yojanas, roughly equivalent to Fa-hien's \"3 yojanas.\" Hiuen Tsiang says \"about 100 li.\"\n\n\u2074 180 or 190 li = about 4\u00bd yojanas. Fa-hien gives the round number 4. Note the precision of Hiuen Tsiang in direction as compared with his predecessor. The deviation to the south-east adds greatly to the distance by road.\n\nHere Hiuen Tsiang gives the correct bearing, and Fa-hien gives the estimated distance. In the time of Hiuen Tsiang the difficulties of the journey, over the hills and through the forests infested by wild beasts, were so great that\n\nJ.M.A.S. 1902.\nWe have thus by a certain and indisputable process obtained the result that the two Chinese pilgrims agree in placing Kusin\u0101r\u0101, or Ku\u015binagara, in an easterly direction from the Lumbini Garden at an estimated marching distance of about 180 English miles, more or less. The later stages lay in exceptionally difficult country, and were therefore liable to be overestimated. In the hills, moreover, experience proves that about one-third must be added to the map measurement to obtain the distance by road. The actual marching distance from the Lumbini Garden to Ku\u015binagara was, therefore, probably not more than, say, 160 or 170 miles, and the distance measured on the map would be considerably less, or, say, 140 to 150 miles.\n\nI now proceed to consider the bearings of Ku\u015binagara in relation to Vais\u0101li. The evidence presents certain difficulties. Fa-hien (Beal, chap. xxiv and xxv) says:\n\n\"Going south-east twelve yojanas from this place [Ku\u015binagara], we arrive at the spot where the Lichchhavis, desiring to follow Buddha to the scene of his Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, were forbidden to do so. On account of their affection for Buddha they were unwilling to go back, on which Buddha caused to appear between them and him a great and deeply-scarped river, which they could not cross. He then left with them his alms-bowl as a memorial, and exhorted them to return to their houses. On this they went back and erected a stone pillar, on which this account is engraved.\n\n\"From this, going five yojanas eastward, we arrive at the country of Vais\u0101li.\"\n\nhe did not attempt to estimate the distance. But his distance of 480 or 490 li from the Lumbini Garden to the st\u016bpa of Candaka's return agrees with Fa-hien's estimate of 12 yojanas. The earlier pilgrim's estimate of the distance from the Ashes st\u016bpa to Ku\u015binagara may, therefore, be accepted as correct.\n\n1 The distance stated, 12 yojanas, is much too short. R\u00e9musat and his colleagues state it as 20 yojanas (Laidlay's translation), which figure, according to Beal, is due to a mistranslation. But is it not possible that the text used by R\u00e9musat correctly read \"20 yojanas\"? Inasmuch as the distance from the Ashes st\u016bpa to Ku\u015binagara is reckoned as 12 yojanas, and the site of the Ashes st\u016bpa (Lauriya-Nandangarh) is distant about 55 or 56 miles, or 7 to 8 yojanas, from Kesariya, which was, according to Fa-hien, the scene of the leave-taking, the figure 20 is approximately correct. The road from Ku\u015binagara to Vaisali passes Lauriya-Nandangarh.\n\n2 Legge gives \"ten yojanas,\" an absolutely impossible distance. The error is evidently in the text used by him. Giles and R\u00e9musat agree with Beal in stating the distance as \"five yojanas.\" Giles points out that there is no authority in the original for the words \"went back\" in Beal's version.\nThis account places the scene of the Licchavi farewell at a distance of about 37 miles north-west from Vais\u0101li, and states that the spot was marked by an inscribed stone pillar.\n\nHiuen Tsiang's account is in some respects very different. He says (Beal, ii, 73):\n\n\"Going north-west of the chief city [Vais\u0101li] 50 or 60 li, we come to a great st\u016bpa. This is where the Lichhavas (Li-ch'e-p'o) took leave of Buddha. Tath\u0101gata having left the city of Vais\u0101li on his way to Ku\u015binagara, all the Liechavas, hearing that Buddha was about to die, accompanied him wailing and lamenting. The Lord of the World having observed their fond affection, and [sic] as words were useless to calm them, immediately by his spiritual power caused to appear a great river with steep sides and deep, the waves of which flowed on impetuously. Then the Lichhavas were abruptly stopped on their way, moved with grief as they were. Then Tath\u0101gata left them his p\u0101tra [alms-bowl] as a token of remembrance.\n\n\"Two hundred li to the north-west of the city of Vais\u0101li, or a little less, is an old and long deserted city, with but few inhabitants. In it is a st\u016bpa. This is the place where Buddha dwelt when, in old days, . . . . he was a Chakravartin monarch and called Mah\u0101d\u00e9va.\"\n\nBoth pilgrims relate the one legend, but they assign it to different localities. Five yojanas of Fa-hien correspond with the \"200 li, or a little less,\" of Hiuen Tsiang, and may fairly be interpreted as $4\\frac{1}{2}$ yojanas, or about 30 miles. Fa-hien places the leave-taking at this spot, which he asserts was marked by an inscribed pillar. Hiuen Tsiang places at the same spot the st\u016bpa of the ancient Cakravartin R\u0101ja. A st\u016bpa, which is to this day ascribed to a Cakravartin R\u0101ja named Ben, is in existence at Kesariy\u0101, about 30 miles north-west of the site of Vais\u0101li, but no inscribed pillar at this place has yet been discovered. The leave-taking is assigned by Hiuen Tsiang to a spot distant 50 or 60 li, equivalent to about 9 miles, north-west from Vais\u0101li,\n\n---\n\n1 The suggestion has been made that the name Kesariy\u0101 may be equivalent to Caesar\u0113a, and may be an echo of the Roman Caesar (D'Alviella, \"Ce que l'Inde doit \u00e0 la Gr\u00e8ce,\" p. 17, note). This conjecture, which cannot be either proved or disproved, is not very probable.\nmarked by a great st\u016bpa, which also has not been discovered. Hiuen Tsiang was clearly right in locating the traditional leave-taking at a spot distant only a few miles from Vais\u0101li. Fa-hien may not have traversed the whole road between Ku\u015binagara and Vais\u0101li, and probably either misunderstood information supplied to him or made a slip in writing up his notes. Hiuen Tsiang may have made an excursion from Vais\u0101li as far as Kesariy\u0101, but he does not seem to have travelled the road between Kesariy\u0101 and Ku\u015binagara. He went to Ku\u015binagara via the Lumbini Garden, R\u0101magr\u0101ma, and the Ashes st\u016bpa, and returned through the Gorakhpur and Azamgarh Districts to Benares.\n\nWhether Fa-hien personally traversed the Ku\u015binagara-Vais\u0101li road or not, his text certainly contains an error, and confounds the scene of the leave-taking with the site of the Cakravartin R\u0101ja\u2019s st\u016bpa. The error may be due to the local guides and not to the pilgrim himself.\n\nWith reference to my theory that Fa-hien and Hiuen Tsiang when describing Kapilavastu were describing different places,1 this case of the Licchavis\u2019 farewell deserves to be noted. It is a clear example of a single legend being assigned by the two pilgrims to two distinct localities, separated from one another by a distance of about 20 miles.\n\nCunningham\u2019s attempt to explain the discrepancy by making out the Cakravartin R\u0101ja\u2019s st\u016bpa, distant 30 miles from Vais\u0101li, to have been a memorial monument erected to mark the scene of the farewell, which was also commemorated by an inscribed pillar \u201cerected near the home of the Licchavis, that is, at Vais\u0101li,\u201d does violence to the texts, and cannot be accepted as satisfactory. I have no doubt that Hiuen Tsiang\u2019s description is, as usual, accurate, and that one st\u016bpa, about 9 miles from Vais\u0101li, commemorated the leave-taking, while another, some 20 miles further on the same road, commemorated the Cakravartin R\u0101ja. Fa-hien may or may not have been correctly informed about the\n\n---\n\n1. The exposition of this theory will be found in my Prefatory Note to B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji\u2019s \u201cReport on Explorations in the Nepalese Tar\u0101i.\u201d\nexistence of a stone pillar. But I suspect that his note on the subject is due to erroneous information concerning the A\u015boka pillars along the Vais\u0101li and Ku\u015binagara road. Such pillars are known to exist at four places, namely, Bakhir\u0101 (Vais\u0101li), 2 miles north-west of Bas\u0101r village; Lauriya-Arar\u0101j, about 20 miles north-west of Kesariy\u0101; Lauriya-Nandangarh (Navandagah), about 15 miles north-north-west of Bettiah; and R\u0101mpurw\u0101, situated \"20\u00bd miles to the north-north-east-half-north from Laoriya Naonadgarh\" [sic], in longitude 84\u00b0 34' E. and latitude 27\u00b0 15' 45'' N. It is quite possible that another similar pillar may yet be found at Kesariy\u0101, and others may be in existence at several other points on the road, which has never been thoroughly explored.\n\nHiuen Tsiang gives no information concerning localities between the Cakravartin R\u0101ju's st\u016bpa and Ku\u015binagara, nor does he state the distance between the two places. But he confirms F\u0101-hien's evidence that the road from Vais\u0101li to Ku\u015binagara ran north-west for a considerable distance and passed Kesariy\u0101. From F\u0101-hien we learn that the distance from Ku\u015binagara to Kesariy\u0101 was estimated as being 12 yojanas, or about 90 miles, Vais\u0101li being 30 miles beyond Kesariy\u0101, and in a direction between south and east from Ku\u015binagara, which therefore, according to this authority, was distant from Vais\u0101li about 120 miles by road.\n\nThe bearing of Ku\u015binagara in relation to Benares is stated by Hiuen Tsiang only, who, as already noted, returned by way of Benares. After describing the other monuments at Ku\u015binagara, the pilgrim continues:\n\n\"By the side of the place where he [Buddha] showed his feet is a st\u016bpa built by A\u015boka-r\u0101ja. This is the place where the eight kings shared the relics. In front is built a stone pillar on which is written an account of this event. . . . To the south-west of the relic-dividing st\u016bpa, going 200 li or so, we come to a great village; here lived a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 of eminent wealth and celebrity. . . . Going 500 li through the great forest we come to the kingdom of P'o-lo-ni-sse (Ban\u0101ras).\"\n\n1 Garrick in Arch. Survey Reports, vol. xxii, p. 51.\n\"This country is about 4,000 li in circuit. On the western side the capital adjoins the Ganges.\"\n\nThe above quotation, except the last clause, is from Beal's translation (ii, 40-44). The last clause is rendered in accordance with Julien's French version, \"du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'ouest, la capitale est voisine du Gange\" (i, 353). Beal's rendering is, \"The capital borders (on its western side) the Ganges river.\"\n\nJulien's version clearly means that the capital stood on the bank of the Ganges at the western side of the kingdom, and this version gives undoubtedly the true sense. Hiuen Tsiang was approaching Benares from the north-east, and apparently desired to draw attention to the fact that he had to cross the whole kingdom before reaching the capital. Ordinarily, when he states the distance to a kingdom he means the distance to its capital, but in this case, where the capital was remote from his point of entry at the north-east frontier of the kingdom, he seems to have reckoned the distance from Ku\u015binagara to the frontier of the Benares kingdom, and not to Benares city. The total distance from Ku\u015binagara via the Brahman's village to the kingdom of Benares is stated as being 700 li, equivalent to about 130 miles. It has been proved that Ku\u015binagara must have lain between E. long. 84\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 and N. lat. 27\u00b0 and 28\u00b0. No site in that approximate position can possibly be made out as being only 130 miles distant from Benares city. The distance of 130 miles from Benares city is, it is true, sufficiently in accordance with Cunningham's identification of the remains near Kasi\u0101 with Ku\u015binagara. But no ingenuity can make out Kasi\u0101 to be 24 yojanas, as Ku\u015binagara was, from the Lumbini Garden, the direct distance between the two places being only about 65 miles, or 9 yojanas, and the distance by road not more than 10 yojanas.\n\nAll the foregoing preliminary reasoning has now prepared the way for tracing on the modern map with approximate accuracy the actual course of the pilgrims from the Lumbini Garden, through Ku\u015binagara, to Vais\u0101li. At present it is\nunfortunately impossible to give the details with precision. A large part of the pilgrims' route lay through territory now included in Nep\u0101l, which is to Europeans almost an unknown land. The portion of the route which lies in the Nepalese Tar\u0101i, or plain below the hills, north of the Bast\u012b and Gorakhpur Districts, is accessible in the sense that the Nepalese Government would probably give an archaeological surveyor a pass authorizing his researches. But, owing to the want of roads, the difficulty in obtaining supplies, and the prevalence of fever, this part of the frontier is a very inconvenient region to visit. The portion of the route which lies to the north of the Camp\u0101ran District beyond the passes is absolutely inaccessible, being jealously closed to all Europeans, and probably even to native Indian subjects. The valley of the Little R\u0101pt\u012b, beyond the Some\u015bvar Range, where the site of Ku\u015binagara seems to lie hid, is believed to be covered for the most part with dense forest, and there is not the slightest prospect that permission to visit it will ever be given. Even if permission were obtainable, it is quite possible that the explorer would be unable to find the site of Ku\u015binagara. A dense forest, full of tigers and wild elephants, is not convenient ground for arch\u00e6ological investigation, and many ancient sites, not readily distinguishable, are probably buried in the jungle.\n\nThe pilgrim, when proceeding eastward from the Lumbini Garden, would have reached the Little Gandak river at a distance of about 30 miles, and the Gandak river about eight miles further east. The distance from the Lumbini Garden to R\u0101magr\u0101ma, or Lan-mo, 200 li or 5 yojanas, is equivalent to about 37 or 38 miles by road, or from 32 to 35 measured on the map. (Five yojanas at $7\\frac{1}{2}$ miles each = $37\\frac{1}{2}$ miles = 200 li, at 40 li to the yojana.)\n\nAccording to this computation, R\u0101magr\u0101ma should lie in the space between the Little Gandak and the Gandak rivers, in approximately N. lat. $27^\\circ 26'$ and E. long. $83^\\circ 52'$. Just here, exactly on the frontier of the Gorakhpur District and Nep\u0101l, a village called Dharmauli (= Dharmapuri) is shown on Indian Atlas Sheet No. 102. When I was Commissioner\nof Gorakhpur I obtained from natives vague information of brick ruins and of a stone pillar in the neighbourhood. Early in June Dr. Hoey, M.I.A.S., who was then Magistrate of Gorakhpur, visited me together from the police station of Pratapgarh in the vicinity mentioned, and moving apparently to the north-west, crossed streams tributary to the Jharahi river, and came across a cairn about 15 feet high on the east bank of the river, some two miles south-east of Parasi in Nepal. Parasi, or the Haridranath, is a market village distant five or six miles from the railway, in approximately N. lat. 27\u00b0 29' and E. long. 83\u00b0 46'. Dr. Hoey took a photograph of this cairn, which is said to be clearly visible from a distance of several miles, where the view is not obscured by trees.\n\nIn the same neighbourhood, Dr. Hoey also came across remains of a large reservoir, and he saw in the bed of an abandoned stream the stone capital of a pillar, \"about 5 feet in diameter and well carved.\" Remains of ancient brick buildings were also observed. This spot seems to be \"about four miles north of Parasi and slightly westward within the village lands of Harkatawa.\" This cairn, which Dr. Hoey is inclined to identify with Sisagara, seems to be on the west side of the Little Himalaya, near the foot of the hills. Without detailed investigation it is impossible to fix with precision the site of Sisagara, but it certainly lies between the limits of N. lat. 27\u00b0 25' to 33\u00b0 and E. long. 83\u00b0 52'. For the purpose of computing the pilgrims' stages my figures, N. lat. 27\u00b0 29' and E. long. 83\u00b0 46', may be taken as correct.\n\nThe pilgrims' next stage was one of 3 yojanas, or about 10\u00bd miles east, to a place where monuments marked the spot where, according to the legend, Gautama Buddha cut off his hair and sent back his charioteer. Hiuen Tsiang's estimate of the distance as being about 100 li (18 or 19 miles) indicates that the stage was something less than 3 yojanas, which at 3\u00bd miles to the yojana, are equivalent to\n\n---\n\n*Note: Mentioned in connection of his excursion under the title \"Buddhist Sites in Nepal\" in the *Times* newspaper, Allahabad, March 25th, 1889.*\n22\u00bd miles. The marching distance may be taken as being from 18 to 20 miles. At a distance of 17 or 18 miles, as measured on the map, from Dharmauli, in a south-easterly direction, we find a village named Bih\u0101r (=eth\u0101ra), in the Camp\u0101ran District, east of the Gandak. This village, which is precisely in the required position, probably marks the traditional site of the return of the charioteer C\u0101\u1e47\u1e0daka, but I have no information concerning the local remains. The name indicates that the ruins of a monastery exist.\n\nThe next stage of 4 yojanas (31 miles), or, according to Hiuen Tsiang, of 180 to 190 li (about 33 miles), brought the travellers to the Ashes st\u016bpa, in a south-easterly direction. In that direction at a distance of 31 miles, as measured on the map (Indian Atlas, Sheet 102), we find the remarkable remains at Lauriy\u0101-Nandangarh, which have been long known to Indian archaeologists. These remains, I believe, mark the site of the Ashes st\u016bpa, erected, according to tradition, by the Moriyanas (? Mauryas) of Pipalivana over the ashes or charcoal from the funeral pile of Gautama. The remains comprise a pillar inscribed with A\u015boka\u2019s edicts, dated in the twenty-seventh year of his reign, more than a score of barrows or st\u016bpas, some being cased with brick and some made of earth only, as well as the Nandangarh mound, a very large detached st\u016bpa of brick. The A\u015boka pillar, which still retains its lion capital, stands nearly half a mile to the north-east of the large village named Lauriy\u0101, on the west side of the Turk\u0101h\u0101 stream, and four or five hundred feet to the north of the most easterly st\u016bpas.\n\nThe great detached mound, still some eighty feet high, known as Nandangarh, stands about half a mile to the southwest of Lauriy\u0101. The top is said to be from 250 to 300 feet in diameter. Slight excavations made by B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji\n\n---\n\nCunningham writes the second name as Navandgarh, but B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji states that the correct form is Nandangan, and in proof of his statement refers to a local folk-tale which associates the remains near Lauriy\u0101 with the nand and the remains at Ch\u0101nkigarh with the bhauj\u0101i of the R\u0101ja or R\u0101ni. Nand means \u2018husband\u2019s sister,\u2019 and bhauj\u0101i means \u2018elder brother\u2019s wife.\u2019 Earlier writers on Indian antiquities described this A\u015boka pillar under the name of \u2018Mathiah,\u2019 which is a village about three miles distant.\nhave proved that this vast structure is a circular st\u016bpa. The space to the south was enclosed by a massive wall, described as being ten feet in thickness. A small brick st\u016bpa exists in the village of Ma\u1e47hi\u0101, three furlongs further south, and several other mounds, apparently st\u016bpas, have been noticed in the immediate neighbourhood. Some of the bricks used in the construction of the great st\u016bpa are of enormous size, measuring about 24 inches in length by 18 in breadth, and 5\u00bd in thickness.\n\nThe principal group of st\u016bpas at the Lauriya site, to the north of the village and stream, is composed of three rows of monuments. One row running east and west comprises five st\u016bpas. The other two rows, farther to the west, are parallel one to the other and run north and south. They comprise about seventeen monuments. All these barrows or st\u016bpas, so far as they have been examined, have been proved to be sepulchral, and many of them are probably pre-Buddhistic.\n\nMr. Carleyle opened the large mound marked E by Cunningham in the row running east and west, which was about 45 feet in height. Traces of successive interments, consisting of charcoal, fragments and ashes of bone, broken coarse pottery, and \u201ca very few particles of iron totally dissolved with corrosion\u201d [sic], were found in the interior at different levels, the details of which were not noted. This monument was an earthen tumulus cased with brick, and furnished with a brick perambulation-path about three or four feet in width. The tumulus marked G in the middle line running north and south had no brick casing. Near its base traces of an interment, or interments, were found, consisting, as in the other case, of ashes and charcoal, with fragments of bone and pottery. Coffins with \u201cunusually\n\n---\n\n1 Cunningham estimated the height of the great st\u016bpa as 80 feet; B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji estimated it as 100. The B\u0101b\u016b visited many of the ancient sites in the Camparau District in March, 1897, under the orders of the Bengal Government. He gave me a copy of his draft report, which has been of use, although it was too crude for publication. The dimensions of the bricks are as stated by the B\u0101b\u016b.\n\n2 The stream bends to the north, and the most easterly barrow, A of Cunningham, is consequently east of the stream, which flows between A and B. The pillar is north of a point midway between A and B.\nlong human skeletons\" are reported to have been found by other explorers in some of the Lauriya mounds, but no intelligible account of the discoveries has been preserved. According to Mr. Carlleyle, scores of small earthen barrows exist in the region from three to six miles west of Lauriya.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the age of the great st\u016bpa at Nandangarh. B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji says that some of the bricks two inches in thickness \"contain inscriptions in ancient P\u0101li characters.\" He gives an eye-copy of one of these inscriptions, which, though not legible, is evidently in early Br\u0101hm\u012b characters, comprising six or seven ak\u1e63aras. I think that this is the large st\u016bpa erected by A\u015boka near the small st\u016bpa built originally to enshrine the ashes or charcoal from Buddha's funeral pyre.\n\nThe only description of the Ashes st\u016bpa is that given by Hiuen Tsiang, who says:\n\n\"To the south-east of the head-shaving st\u016bpa, in the middle of a desert ('\u00e0 travers des plaines sauvages,' Julien) going 180 or 190 li, we come to a Nyagr\u014ddha [banyan] grove, in which there is a st\u016bpa about 30 feet high.\n\nFormerly, when Tath\u0101gata had died and his remains had been divided, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who had obtained none, came to the place of cremation, and taking the remnant of coals and cinders to their native country, built this st\u016bpa over them, and offered their religious services to it. Since then wonderful signs have occurred in this place; sick persons who pray and worship here are mostly cured.\n\nBy the side of the ashes st\u016bpa is an old sangh\u0101r\u0101ma [monastery], where there are traces of the four former Buddhas, who walked and sat there.\n\nOn the right hand and left of this convent there are several\n\n---\n\n1 Cunningham, Archaeol. Survey Reports, i, pp. 68-74, pls. xxiii and xxv; ivi (Garrick), pp. 104-109, pls. xxvii and xxviii; xxii (Carlleyle), pp. 36-49. In \"the large mound directly south of the lion pillar,\" apparently B of Cunningham, Mr. Garrick found a shallow earthen vessel containing 67 cowrie shells at a depth of seven feet. Cowries have often been found in st\u016bpas. In the great st\u016bpa of Nandangarh, at a depth of about five feet from the top, Mr. Garrick found an earthenware lamp bearing traces of an inscription in early Br\u0101hm\u012b characters, apparently similar to those of the A\u015boka inscriptions. The reports of Messrs. Carlleyle and Garrick are very unsatisfactory, and both gentlemen failed to keep proper notes of their destructive proceedings.\nhundred st\u016bpas, among which is one large one built by As\u00f4kar\u00e2ja; although it is mostly in ruins, yet its height is still about 100 feet.\n\n\"From this, going north-east through a great forest, along a dangerous and difficult road, where wild oxen and herds of elephants and robbers and hunters cause incessant trouble to travellers, after leaving the forest we come to the kingdom of Kiu-shi-na-k'ie-lo (Ku\u015binagara).\"\n\nAccording to the pilgrim's description, which is no doubt quite correct, the remains of a monastery should be traceable. The published accounts of the Nandangarh ruins are so imperfect that it is impossible to be certain whether or not a monastery existed there. B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji notes that there is a vast accumulation of brick d\u00e9bris at the foot of the great st\u016bpa, and that the area enclosed by the massive wall to the south, which is covered by dense and thorny brushwood and includes various brick remains and small tanks, may have been the site of a monastery. Hiuen Tsiang saw several hundred small st\u016bpas. At present only a few have been traced, but it is probable that, as at Kasi\u0101, many are hidden below the surface.\n\nThe tumuli containing traces of interments may be, as already remarked, pre-Buddhistic. Similar, though smaller, earthen tumuli exist adjoining the Buddhist ruins in the neighbourhood of Kasi\u0101, and I suspect that the existence of these prehistoric cemeteries near Lauriy\u0101 and Kasi\u0101 explains the ancient sanctity of both localities, and their selection as sites for Buddhist monuments. I freely admit that the identification of the Lauriy\u0101-Nandangarh remains with the Ashes St\u016bpa site rests mainly upon the fact that these remains are exactly in the position where the Ashes St\u016bpa must have stood, according to my reading of the pilgrims' itineraries. The proposed identification is not contradicted by the local facts so far as they are known; but until an adequate survey of the entire group of ruins is made, and well-devised excavations are effected, it is\n\n1 Beal, ii, 31.\nimpossible to affirm positively that the great st\u016bpa of Nandangarh is the Ashes St\u016bpa built by A\u015boka. No other group of ruins is found in the required position.\n\nThe important remains at C\u0101nk\u012bgarh, about 11 miles directly north from Lauriyy\u0101, have been described in a fashion still more unsatisfactory. The principal mass of ruin is said by Mr. Garrick to be loftier than Nandangarh, being about 90 feet in height, and composed of solid masonry constructed with brick slabs 14 inches square and 2\u00bd inches thick. Remains of ancient buildings are said to exist on the top. The shape of the mound is irregular. Mr. Garrick estimated its length east and west to be about 250 feet. B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji doubles this estimate, and gives the approximate height of the mound as 135 feet.\u00b9 This mound is distant only about 27 miles in a direct line from the village Bih\u0101r, which I identify with the place of Candaka\u2019s return, and cannot well be the Ashes St\u016bpa.\n\nAssuming that the Lauriyy\u0101-Nandangarh remains represent the Ashes St\u016bpa, Ku\u015binagara should lie to the north-east, that is to say, between north and east, at a distance by road of twelve yojanas, or about 90 miles. The road in the seventh century was dangerous and difficult, being infested by wild elephants and other beasts. After passing through the forest, the pilgrim emerged in the kingdom of Ku\u015binagara. This description seems to indicate that it crossed the passes and forests of the Some\u015bvar Range.\n\nA line 90 miles in length measured directly on the map in a north-easterly direction from Lauriyy\u0101-Nandangarh extends far beyond K\u0101thm\u0101nd\u016b. But when the line is measured along the actual road a possible site for Ku\u015bin\u0101r\u0101 is obtained. The hills can, of course, be crossed only at the passes, which were the same in the pilgrims\u2019 time as they now are. The direction of the series of A\u015boka pillars clearly indicates the Bhikn\u0101 Thor\u012b Pass as that used by the pilgrims. The distance from Lauriyy\u0101 via C\u0101nk\u012bgarh and the A\u015boka\n\n\u00b9 The correct name of this place seems to be C\u0101nki, or Chankee, as it is spelled in the Indian Atlas. Mr. Garrick, in Reports, vol. xvi, p. 109, calls it Chandkigarh, whereas in vol. xxii, p. 50, he calls it Janki Garh.\npillar at R\u0101mpurw\u0101 to the Bhikn\u0101 Thori Pass on the frontier is approximately 30 miles. At the pass the road turns sharply to the west for about 7 miles, and then turns northwards for about 7 or 8 miles to the Ch\u016bria Gh\u0101ti Stockade,\\(^1\\) from which the place marked Gurunggaon on Sheet 102 of the Indian Atlas is distant about 18 miles north-east. Gurunggaon is situated at the cross-roads a mile or two beyond the Little R\u0101pt\u012b river. The distance from the Bhikn\u0101 Thori Pass to Gurunggaon is, by road, as measured on the map, therefore \\((7 + 8 + 18)\\) about 33 miles. Adding one-third because the road is in the hills, the marching distance must be about 44 miles. The marching distance from Lauriy\u0101-Nandangarh in the plains to the Bhikn\u0101 Thori Pass may be taken as about 35 miles. The total marching distance from Lauriy\u0101-Nandangarh to Gurunggaon is, therefore, about \\(44 + 35 = 79\\) miles. The 12 yojanas of F\u0101-hien are equivalent to about 90 miles. Considering the nature of the country, the difference between 79 and 90 is not very great. Distances in difficult country are always liable to be overestimated.\n\nI believe that the site of Kusin\u0101r\u0101, or Ku\u015binagara, must lie a few miles beyond Gurunggaon in the valley of the Little R\u0101pt\u012b, which constituted the kingdom of Ku\u015binagara, into which Hiuen Tsiang entered when he emerged from the \"dangerous and difficult\" forest and hill paths. The position of Ku\u015binagara may therefore be defined with a near approach to accuracy as in E. long. \\(84\u00b0\\ 51'\\) and N. lat. \\(27\u00b0\\ 32'\\). The spot thus indicated is about 30 miles in a direct line from K\u0101thm\u0101ndu, the distance by the circuitous road being probably half as much again.\n\nHiuen Tsiang describes the Valley of Nep\u0101l as forming a separate kingdom. The kingdom of Kusin\u0101r\u0101 or Ku\u015binagara was, according to my view, the valley of the Little R\u0101pt\u012b, which is a tributary of the Gandak.\n\n\\(^1\\) Marked on Sheet 102 of the Indian Atlas as \"Choorea Ghati Pass, a large Stockade.\" Oldfield spells the name Cherya Ghatti.\nKUSIN\u0100R\u0100 OR KU\u015aINAGARA.\n\nFrom my position for Ku\u015binagara the stages back to Vais\u0101li will be, in a general direction between south and east:\n\n1. To the Ashes St\u016bpa (Lauriy\u0101 - Nandangarh) 12 yojanas = 85\u201390 miles;\n2. From the Ashes St\u016bpa to the st\u016bpa of the Cakravartin R\u0101ja (Kesariy\u0101) about 7 yojanas, equivalent to about 53 miles;\n3. From the st\u016bpa of the Cakravartin R\u0101ja to Vais\u0101li, (nearly) 5 yojanas, or about 30 miles.\n\nThe total marching distance is, therefore (12 + 7 + nearly 5), 23 or 24 yojanas, or about (85 (or 90) + 53 + 30) equivalent to 168 to 173 miles. The distance of 12 yojanas given in the texts of Fa-hien, translated by Beal, Giles, and Legge as the distance from Ku\u015binagara to Kesariy\u0101, is impossible. The true distance is between 19 and 20 yojanas, and I am therefore disposed to believe that the 20 yojanas mentioned by the French translators were really found in the text used by them.\n\nThe village of the learned Brahman, which Hiuen Tsiang places on the road to Benares, about 200 li, or 37 miles, from Ku\u015binagara, must be in Nep\u0101l, not very far from the Bhikn\u0101 Thori Pass. It may be represented by Maw\u0101garh, which is said to be the name of considerable remains a few miles west of the Pass.\u00b9\n\nFrom the Brahman's village the pilgrim reckons about 500 li, equivalent to 12\u00bd yojanas, or 93 miles, in a south-westerly direction to the kingdom of Benares. Protraction of this distance and direction from the Bhikn\u0101 Thori Pass brings us to the Gh\u0101gr\u0101 River, which formed, I believe, the boundary between the kingdom of Benares on the south and the countries of the Mallians and Licchavis on the north of the river. The kingdom of Benares lay between the\n\n\u00b9 B\u0101h\u016b P. C. Mukherji heard of Maw\u0101garh, and was told that there are also ruins at a place called B\u0101ngarh, to the east of the Pass.\nRiver, no doubt, emerged from the hills at some point in the seventh century, as it does now, but there seems to be even probable, that at that period the river running through the plains may have flowed into the east, which is still remembered as the Gandak. The stupa of Candaka's Return would then have been on the west side of the stream, and not on the east as it stands now is. The legend of the return of the Buddha would naturally be associated with the arrival of the travelers at the first great river which they met, and it is very probable that, if the stupa of Candaka's Return can be distinctly identified, it will be found on the west bank in old bed of the Gandak. My information concerning the topography of the Camparan District is not sufficiently detailed to allow of my tracing throughout the course of the old bed of the Gandak, nor do I know by which the river changed its course.\n\nDue to unavoidable indistinctness of detail, I am convinced that the accompanying sketch map indicates with a fair approach to accuracy the route of the Chinese pilgrims from the Lumbini Garden to Kusinagara. I think that the site of R\u0101magr\u0101ma, the stupa of Candaka's Return, or Kusin\u0101ra, or Kusinagara, have been approximately determined, and that the site of the Ashes, or Charcoul, Stupa has been almost certainly fixed at Lauriy\u0101-Nandangurh. From N\u0101sikata to Vais\u0101li the line of march in the plains is clearly marked out by the A\u015boka pillars at R\u0101mpurw\u0101, near Nandangarh, Lauriy\u0101-Arar\u0101j, and Bakhir\u0101 near Vais\u0101li, and by the Cakravartin R\u0101ja's stupa at Kesariy\u0101.\n\nThe position of Kusinagara as determined in this paper is very remote from the position of Kusin\u0101ra according to the P\u0101li books. Both Buddhaghosa and the J\u0101taka place Kusin\u0101ra at a distance of 25 yojanas from R\u0101jagrha (R\u0101jgir). Assuming that the yojana used in the P\u0101li books is the same as that on which Fa-hien makes his computations, 25 yojanas are equivalent to about 190 miles. R\u0101jgir is about 40 miles\n\n---\n\n*Rhys Davids in 'B.R.S.' for July, 1901, p. 405.*\nKUSIN\u0100R\u0100 OR KU\u015aINAGARA.\n\nnearly due south of Patna, and 60 odd miles from Vais\u0101li (Bas\u0101r).\n\nK\u0101thm\u0101ndu, the capital of Nep\u0101l, is about 190 miles distant in a direct line measured on the map from R\u0101jg\u012br, and the indication given in the P\u0101li books is sufficient to show that the writers believed Kusin\u0101r\u0101 to be in the territory now belonging to Nep\u0101l. According to my computation, the marching distance from R\u0101jg\u012br to the probable position of Kusin\u0101r\u0101 would be about 32 or 33 yojanas.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. Prehistoric Burial Sites in Southern India.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In the Journal for October, 1901, p. 925, Dr. Burgess draws attention to the interesting excavations made by Mr. Rea in South India, and announced by him in his Annual Report to the Government of Madras. This Annual Report, being embodied in a 'G.O.,' is circulated among a few favoured individuals and institutions, but it does not reach the public. What we want are annual volumes such as those produced by the Egypt Exploration Fund. The world is the richer this month by the publication of Professor Flinders Petrie's last volume. The \"Royal Tombs\" is a monument of splendid energy, published while all the facts are fresh in the explorer's mind, and profusely illustrated. These volumes are published every year. They embody the outcome of the previous season's work. They profess no finality. They are not kept back, as our Indian volumes are kept back, until some great specialist shall have assimilated everything that can be known, and can write with certainty his full and deliberate convictions. And the result is that while in every civilized country the work going on in Egypt is watched with intense interest by numbers of people who do not profess to possess any great scientific knowledge of the subject, and while, therefore,\n\n---\n\n1 The Egypt Exploration Fund has published thirty-three handsome volumes in the last twenty years, besides other Reports and Summaries. Only one or two concerning South India have seen the light in that period, so far as I know.\nthe Societies engaged are supplied with funds which enable them to carry on the excavations and print their volumes, the labours of the Indian Archaeological Departments fall invariably dead and lifeless. Whatever is being done in India is done almost in secret, and everybody knows that nothing will be heard of it for fifteen or twenty years, so that no one cares to support it. If we could have for India annual volumes such as we have for Egypt, I am confident that the Royal Asiatic Society and the Indian Exploration Fund would receive numbers of new adherents, and the value of their work would be greatly increased.\n\nDr. Burgess's seven handsome volumes have appeared at intervals since 1874, an interval of twenty-seven years. We have had no volume dealing with South India (setting aside epigraphical publications) since 1887. For fourteen years, therefore, the public have had no information as to the progress of archaeology in that tract. Can this state of things not be remedied?\n\nNotes.\n\nA.\u2014Urn-burial was common in the South of India, and apparently the practice lasted into historic times, for it is clearly mentioned in the \"Purra N\u0101nn\u016bru.\" Dr. Pope publishes in the *Indian Antiquary* for October, 1900 (p. 284), the following extract from one of these poems (date unknown, but apparently of the Chola period). It is ascribed to Mudan\u0101r, the lame bard of Aiy\u016br:\n\n\"O potter-chief! maker of vessels!\nThou whose furnace sends up thick clouds\nOf smoke, veiling the outspread heavens,\n\nVallavan, the great . . .\nHath gained the world of gods. And so\n'Tis thine to shape an urn, so huge\nThat it shall cover the remains of such an one.\"\nB.\u2014The rock-bruisings at Bellary are very interesting. They are to be found on a hill about four miles east of that town, above a trap-dyke which had been extensively used for the manufacture of stone axe-heads, hammers, and the like. I made a rough drawing of some of these, which Mr. F. Fawcett published in the Asiatic Quarterly Review in 1892, p. 147.\n\nC.\u2014The 'prehistorics' of South India include innumerable quantities of rude stone circles, cromlechs, dolmens, menhirs, and kist-vaens\u2014the 'holed dolmens' being particularly interesting, and some of them of very elaborate design; flint and other stone weapons, a few being palaeolithic but most of them neolithic; hammers, adzes, chisels, mealing-stones, corn-crushers, grinding-stones, and axe-heads of all sizes and shapes; bronze and iron weapons, ornaments, and implements; funereal urns, coffins, and other vessels in pottery; bruisings and cuttings on rocks; cinder-mounds in places (if these are prehistoric); carvings and rude sculptures on stone; gold ornaments; pottery whorls and beads; and many other objects.\n\nShortly after the above note was written I received, through the kindness of the author, a copy of Mr. R. Bruce Foote's \"Catalogue of the Prehistoric Antiquities\" in the Government Museum at Madras. No one could be more competent to undertake such a work. Mr. Foote is not only an expert in 'prehistorics,' but his long service in the Geological Department has led him into most of the wild tracts of Southern India. Here, then, is the first attempt at the much-needed classification, and it will be widely welcomed. When I add that a great deal remains to be done it must be understood that the opinion is expressed without the slightest wish to disparage the work of the author, to whom I am personally indebted for much kindness in former years, and for much help, advice, and encouragement. But this publication, in one of its aspects, proves the truth of the assertions made above. The gem of the Madras Collection is the great series brought together by\nthe late Mr. J. W. Breeks, of the Civil Service, from his explorations amongst the cairns and barrows of the Nilgiri Hills. The volume, however, dealing with this was published in 1873, and during the subsequent twenty-eight years no systematic researches appear to have been carried out in the Madras Presidency, except by Mr. Bruce Foote and Mr. Rea; and no volume bearing on the subject has been laid before the scientific world until the present year.\n\nWe learn from Mr. Foote's treatise that there were in Southern India a palaeolithic, a neolithic, and an iron age, but apparently no age of bronze. In the neolithic age men had learned how to drill the hardest stones and how to make household vessels of pottery. In the iron age they knew how to smelt that metal and to forge it into shapes for daily use, both in agriculture and warfare. They used the potter's wheel also for making their pots. They do not, however, appear to have been possessed of any knowledge of mixed metals\u2014of copper or of bronze. There appears to have been a great gap, historically speaking, between the dates of the palaeolithic and neolithic folk, but none between the men of the neolithic and iron ages, the latter being the direct descendants of the former. The carved kistvaens and cromlechs of Sholur and Melur seem to belong to the later iron age, and the grotesque pottery 'figurines' (represented as armed with axes, daggers, and swords) to the earlier iron age. The iron age pottery was frequently so shaped that the vessels might rest embedded in soft soil, or on detached earthenware 'ring-stands.' (This was also the case in Egypt.) No trace of any alphabetic writing has been yet found.\n\nThe author himself expresses the regret which all interested will feel, that in so many cases the information is imperfect. Often we have objects incapable of being classified in order of date, or of being assigned to any particular locality, because this information has been for ever lost. Is it too much to hope that in future greater care will be exercised, and that everything found will be so recorded as to convey to the world the full knowledge which it is capable of teaching?\nSome of the points of interest in this study of prehistoric man\u2014points which must be worked out in the future\u2014are the following:\u2014(A) As to disposal of the dead. What was the practice in palaeolithic days? In neolithic and subsequent ages various customs seem to have obtained. But in what tracts, and amongst what tribes? There is burial in large urns, the body being doubled up. There is burial in large pottery coffins with several legs. There is cremation, followed by burial in small urns. What was the practice amongst the tribes who buried their dead in (1) kistvaens sunk in the ground, (2) dolmens and cromlechs placed above ground, often on slopes of solid rock, as may be seen in the North Arcot District forests? (e.g., was there any cremation prior to interment?) and at what period of history were these monuments raised? It would seem that the custom of urn-burial was in vogue in Chola days, and if so, it is perhaps the latest form of sepulture in existence prior to the introduction of Brahmanical worship into Southern India. (B) As to civilization, arts, industries, manners, and customs. It will be most interesting to compare the condition of prim\u00e6val tribes with that of the Dravidian and pre-Dravidian races of to-day. In one respect the older folk contrast favourably with the moderns. Their pottery appears to have been far harder and more durable. To what age belong the elaborately-arranged dolmens of the western hills in the North Arcot District? Was the country densely or sparsely populated in prehistoric days? Can the ancient tribes be so localized that in historic sequence their descent can be traced into the dynastic period, and thence to the present day? Thus, if it can be shown that the practice of urn-burial was confined to the pre-dynastic Pallavas of the Eastern and Southern coasts, what was the practice of the tribes which afterwards became merged under the sovereignty of the Cheras, Cholas, and Pandiyan?\n\nAll these riddles and many others will be solved, no doubt, in course of time; but when is the process of solution to be earnestly taken in hand?\nAnd, once more, will the Government, or the Indian Exploration Fund, publish annual volumes, fully illustrated like those issued by Professor Flinders Petrie and his co-workers, containing the results of the work, not of past decades, but of the year immediately preceding the issue of each? It may be safely prophesied that, if this be done, the number of persons interested in Indian antiquities will rapidly increase, and both our Society and the Indian Exploration Fund will greatly benefit.\n\nR. Sewell.\n\n2. The Author of the Life of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to Professor Denison Ross's paper in the J.R.A.S. for 1896, p. 249, I beg leave to suggest that the author of the life of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl may have been Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdullah Marw\u0101rid. He was a high officer under Sult\u0101n Husain Baiqra of Herat, and some years after the death of that prince he entered into the service of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl. Ill-health, however, obliged him to give up public employment and to retire into private life, when he occupied himself in writing the life of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl in prose and verse. He completed the prose history, which had the name of the T\u0101r\u012bkh Sh\u0101h\u012b, but did not live to finish the poem. These facts are recorded by Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl's son, S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, in his Tah\u0101fat S\u0101m\u012b, of which an abstract has been given by Silvestre de Sacy (Not. et Ex., iv, 273). It is true that S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101 says that \u2018Abdullah died in 922, and that Khwand\u0101mir makes a similar statement in the Hab\u012bb-as-Siyar (B.M. MS. Add. 17,925, 438b). But it seems to me that this date, which is only given in figures in the Tah\u0101fat, must be a mistake for 932. In the first place, S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101 tells us that \u2018Abdullah completed his history, but he could hardly be said to have done this unless he lived to the end of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl's reign, which did not occur till 930. Secondly, S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101 tells us (see p. 283 of De Sacy's notice) that he had been \u2018Abdullah's disciple. Now S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, as we learn from the \u1e24ab\u012bb MS. (loc. cit., 536b), was born in 923, and so\ncould not have been the disciple of a man who died in 922. 'Abdullah Marw\u0101rid was a very well-known man, both as a public servant and as a writer, and S\u0101m Mirz\u0101 speaks of his history as having considerable vogue. If the anonymous life is not his T\u0101r\u012bkh Sh\u0101h\u012b, what has become of the latter? If we suppose that he died in 932 this would agree with the opinions of Professors Rieu, Ross, and Browne that the life was written shortly after the accession of Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp. As regards the mention of M. Zam\u0101n Mirz\u0101's death in the life, I would suggest that this fact, which occurred in 947, was added by a copyist or by 'Abdullah's son, Mirz\u0101 M\u016bm\u012bn. He seems to have been connected with Muhammad Zam\u0101n, for the two names are bracketed together in Khwand\u0101mir's notice of Mirz\u0101 M\u016bm\u012bn (loc. cit., 554a), and it is evident from the long details about M. Zam\u0101n which are given in the anonymous life that he and the writer must have known one another. Mirz\u0101 M\u016bm\u012bn was S\u0101m Mirz\u0101's preceptor, and a well-known writer and calligrapher. He afterwards entered Tahm\u0101sp's service, but left him for some reason and went to India (not improbably in company with M. Zam\u0101n), and died there. According to De Sacy this occurred in 948, but I do not find this date in the British Museum copy of S\u0101m Mirz\u0101's work.\n\nFinally, if we must take the date 922 as the correct date of 'Abdullah's death, may we not hold that the latter's life of Sh\u0101h Isma'il was continued and completed by the son.\n\nNotices of 'Abdullah Marw\u0101rid will be found in Mir 'Ali Sh\u012br's Maj\u0101lis; in Daulat Sh\u0101h, p. 515 of Mr. Browne's edition, and in B\u0101bar's Memoirs, in his account of the eminent men of Sult\u0101n Husain's Court.\n\nII. BEVERIDGE.\n\n3. A CAMBODJAN MAH\u0100VAMSA.\n\nW\u00fcrzburg, Sanderring 20.\nSeptember 14, 1901.\n\nMy dear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014During the last three months I have possessed here at our University's\nlibrary a MS. from Paris, containing, to judge from the catalogue in the J.P.T.S., 1882, p. 35, the Mah\u0101vamsa in Cambodian writing. But the catalogue is mistaken. The MS., which is not badly written, although it abounds with errors of every sort, and far exceeds in size the Mah\u0101vamsa, as we know it from the published text, contains a secondary work, embodying the Mah\u0101v. (i.e. the thirty-eight paricchedas), only with many liberties in adapting it to the general plan the author had in view. You will better understand his intentions by the colophon. I quote from it the following verses:\u2014\n\nBuddhavamsam Mah\u0101vamsam sikkhina\u00f1 ca sam\u0101ha\u1e6dam\nTh\u016bpavamsam gahetv\u0101na sampinditv\u0101na ekato\natthato gandhato c\u0101pi yuttato c\u0101pi ettha ca\nayuttam p\u0101liruddham v\u0101 yadi pasati ki\u00f1c\u0101pi\npubb\u0101param viloketv\u0101 vic\u0101retv\u0101 punappunam\ndhimant\u0101nam gahetabbam gahetabbam na dosato\ntividhopad\u0101nam [written \u00b0dhoppapa\u00b0] gatiyo\u00b9 duvidh\u0101\n[written duvu\u00b2] ti ca\ntasma upaparikkhitv\u0101 veditabbam [written \u00b0bba] vibh\u0101vina\nantar\u0101yam vin\u0101 cayam yath\u0101 siddhim up\u0101gata\ntath\u0101 kaly\u0101nasamkapp\u0101 siddhim gacchanti [written \u00b0cchati]\np\u0101ninam.\n\nThen follow two slokas containing the usual prayers. Then in prose: anena pu\u00f1\u00f1ena may\u0101 katena sikkheyyam [written \u00b0yy\u0101] tam dhammavaram jinassa, pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya silena kusalena c\u0101ti [written c\u0101to or c\u0101go] an\u0101gate ketumagyam [? ketum\u0101ghyam?] bhaveyyam, yada sutv\u0101na saddhammam Mettayass\u2019 [thus clearly] eva santike pasanno p\u012btiy\u0101 mayham pabbaji jinas\u0101sane Moggall\u0101no ti n\u0101m\u0101ham. Then follow two slokas of benedictions.\n\nThis Moggall\u0101na, of whose date we as yet know nothing, was certainly no great poet, but, so far as he was led by the wish to banish darkness wherever the reader of the existent\n\n\u00b9 In Cambodian g and t are the same. I read gatiyo, but the meaning of this verse is not quite intelligible to me.\nMah\u0101vamsa may meet with it, and to amplify more and more the original text, his task is executed pretty well. To demonstrate this, I beg to point out only two instances.\n\n(1) After the first four verses of the first chapter follows a section which bears the subscription: Uravelagamanan nitthitam, of about 490 \u015blokas, beginning with Pubbe kira gavesanto bodhi\u00f1\u0101nam nar\u0101sabho.\n\nFrom bodhito navame m\u0101se (sl. 19 of the Mv.) the compilation agrees with the text, but already in the second half it disagrees and makes a digression, relating in detail and with many interspersed dialogues the affairs in La\u1e45k\u0101 on Buddha\u2019s first visit there. Whereas the original text consists of 24 \u015blokas from Bodhito (v. 19) to the conclusion (v. 43) of the Mahiya\u1e45ga\u1e47\u0101gamana, Moggall\u0101na has brought them up to more than 200, a few only being identical with those in the printed text of the Mv. In other sections the additions are smaller, but every section has additions.\n\n(2) In ch. v (ed. Turnour, p. 41) is simply related how Tissa propounded to the king (Asoka) the Tittiraj\u0101taka. From the circumstances under which this was done it follows that J\u0101t. iii, 64 sqq. is meant. In the compilation of Moggall\u0101na, however, after the words \u201cthero bodhesi r\u0101j\u0101nam vatv\u0101 Tittiraj\u0101takan,\u201d the whole J\u0101taka, i.e. a versification of the commentary, including the stanzas, is inserted, beginning with\u2014\n\nAtite Brahmadattamhi k\u0101rente bhavanam kira samiddhe nagare ramme pure B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012bvhaye.\n\nThis addition consists of thirty \u015blokas, and it is connected with the \u2018Rahmenerz\u00e4hlung,\u2019 so to speak, by the words\u2014\n\ntam dhammadesanam sutv\u0101 r\u0101ja attamano tato vasanto garu satt\u0101ham r\u0101juyy\u0101ne manorame sikkhapetv\u0101 mahipalam sambuddhasamayam varam.\n\nThe verb fin. is missing, as often, and \u2018garu\u2019 instead of \u2018tattha\u2019 (reading of the printed text) was needed, in order to remind the reader that Tissa is spoken of in the second half of the \u015bloka (which, in our case, has an additional line).\nFor a fuller report on this singular work, its sources and composition, I may be allowed to refer to my new edition of the Mah\u0101vamsa now in preparation.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nE. Hardy.\n\n4. A Sanskrit Maxim.\n\nRedhill.\nNovember 25, 1901.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014In the Preface to my pamphlet on Sanskrit Maxims, which was published last year and noticed in this year's July number of the R.A.S. Journal, I gave a short list of ny\u0101yas contained in the lexicons, but which I had failed to find in the literature. Amongst them was the andhagajany\u0101ya, \"the maxim of the blind men and the elephant.\" I have since discovered it, however, in Suresvara's huge v\u0101rtika on Brhad\u0101ranyakopani\u1e63ad\u0101dhy\u0101ya, 4. 4. 566 (p. 1813 of \u0100nand\u0101\u015brama edition). The verse is as follows:\n\n\"Ekam evaikar\u016bpam sadvastvaj\u00f1\u0101t\u0101m nira\u00f1janam |\nJ\u0101yandhagajadr\u1e63\u1e6dyeva ko\u1e6di\u1e63\u0101\u1e25 kalpyate m\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101.\" ||\n\nBut a much more interesting fact in connection with this ny\u0101ya is that the story on which it is based is of Buddhistic origin. Several months ago Monsieur Barth informed me that he had met with it in some Buddhist work which he could not then remember; and now the missing link has been supplied by Monsieur Louis de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin, who referred me to p. 187 of your Dialogues of the Buddha. It is there stated that the story was told by Gotama himself to a number of non-Buddhist teachers who were disputing as to the meaning of the Ten Indeterminates (\"Whether the world is eternal or not,\" etc.), and I now learn from yourself that the original is contained in Ud\u0101na, vi, 4, pp. 66-69 of the Pali Text Society's edition.\n\nI hope to embody this information in a Second Handful of Sanskrit Maxims which I have in the press.\u2014Yours sincerely,\n\nG. A. Jacob.\n5. Chronology of the Ku\u1e63\u0101\u1e47 Dynasty of Northern India.\n\nCheltenham.\nDecember 16, 1901.\n\nMy dear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014I shall be obliged if you can spare a little space in the January number of the Journal for the announcement that I believe myself to be so fortunate as to have solved the long-debated problem of the Ku\u1e63\u0101\u1e47 chronology.\n\nThe known dates are:\u2014\n\nKani\u1e63ka, from 5 to 28.\nHuvi\u1e63ka, ,, 29 ,, 60.\nV\u0101sudeva, ,, 74 ,, 98.\n\nThese dates are, I think, expressed in the Laukika or Saptarshi Era of Ka\u015bmir, the millenniums and centuries being omitted in accordance with the practice of the R\u0101jatara\u1e45gini.\n\nThe corresponding dates are:\u2014\n\n| King    | Laukika | K\u0101li Yuga | A.D.\u00b9 |\n|---------|---------|-----------|-------|\n| Kani\u1e63ka | [32]05 + 25 = 3230 = 129\u2013130 |\n| ,,      | [32]28 ,, = 3253 = 154\u2013155\u00b2 |\n| Huvi\u1e63ka | [32]29 ,, = 3254 = 155\u2013156\u00b2 |\n| ,,      | [32]60 ,, = 3285 = 184\u2013185 |\n| V\u0101sudeva| [32]74 ,, = 3299 = 198\u2013199 |\n| ,,      | [32]98 ,, = 3323 = 222\u2013223 |\n\nI have worked out this result in detail, after consideration of all the principal writings on this subject, including the recent essays of Messrs. Bhandarkar, Boyer, Sylvain L\u00e9vi, and Specht.\n\nI hope on another occasion, in due course, to convince others, as I have convinced myself, that my solution is in conformity with the Chinese, epigraphic, numismatic, and monumental evidence\u2014or, in other words, that it satisfies all the conditions of the problem.\u2014Yours sincerely,\n\nVincent A.

By Enno Littmann. pp. viii + 76. (Leipzig, 1901.)\n\nFar to the south-east of Damascus, in the volcanic region of the \u1e24arra, and more especially in the neighbourhood of Mount \u1e62af\u0101, a number of inscriptions in an unknown character were discovered by the English traveller Cyril Graham in 1857. Others were found in later years by Wetzstein and De Vog\u00fc\u00e9, and their number has recently been considerably increased by the journeys of Messrs. Dussaud and Macler, and, to a greater extent, by the American Archaeological Expedition in Syria in 1899\u20131900. Graham himself published an article on his finds in this Journal (1860, Vol. XVII, pp. 286\u2013297), but it is to the Germans O. Blau and D. H. M\u00fcller, and more particularly to the versatile French scholar Hal\u00e9vy, that we owe any considerable knowledge of the contents of these inscriptions.\n\nIn the course of the recent American expedition referred to above, Herr Enno Littmann, of Oldenberg, who represented the department of Semitic epigraphy, made a hurried journey through the \u1e24arra and the Ruhbeh oasis, and copied 134 of these so-called \u1e62af\u0101 inscriptions, upon the publication of which he is now engaged. The present monograph is a prolegomena to the larger work, and is intended to set the decipherment of these inscriptions upon a surer basis. The first part of his book deals with those characters for which he has suggested values differing from Hal\u00e9vy. To put it briefly, we may say that Hal\u00e9vy drew up an alphabet\nof twenty-three characters corresponding to that of the Hebrew, with the addition of a sign for \u03c7 (\u1fc6). This additional sign in itself should have aroused suspicion, but for twenty years his identifications have been accepted, and appear, for example, in Euting's fine table of Semitic alphabets which accompanies Zimmern's Vergleichende Grammatik (1898). Praetorius, however, in a review of Hal\u00e9vy's book (which was a reprint of a series of papers to the Journal Asiatique, 1877\u20131882), did not fail to see the incompleteness of the identifications, and now Littmann makes it highly probable that the alphabet actually consists of twenty-eight letters corresponding in number and value to the Arabic, a return in theory to the views of the earlier decipherers. Hal\u00e9vy's \u03c7 now becomes \u03c1; a character which was formerly looked upon as a variant of \u03c1 is here shown to be the regular form of \u03c7 (\u1fc6), and so on. Littmann makes a fresh examination of the inscriptions, and contends that it is only by adopting the new readings that they become intelligible. For example, Hal\u00e9vy's \u03c8 should be \u03c2, and the name which the former read \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0 should be \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0, with which Littmann compares the \u1e62afa \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0, and the newly-discovered Nabatean \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0 and \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0. In like manner, Hal\u00e9vy's \u03c9 is clearly to be read \u03c9, and the legend \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0, which was accompanied by a rude drawing of a horse, should obviously be read \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0. Similarly, for \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0 we should now read \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0, a name which has abundant analogies. In the second part of his book Littmann has transliterated a number of inscriptions which are not wholly genealogical and offer some interesting additions to the vocabulary. Many of these, unfortunately, are almost unintelligible, and the meaning that can be wrested from them is too often only plausible. The majority of them are from De Vog\u00fc\u00e9 and Dussaud, and are not accompanied by any facsimiles.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to observe that Herr Littmann's conclusions, if sound, will mark an important stage in the\ndecipherment of the \u1e62af\u0101 inscriptions, and will aid the reading of the closely related Lihyan inscriptions of el-'Ol\u0101. Further investigation, it is to be hoped, will give us more precise information regarding the nomad Arab tribes whose work these inscriptions are. Already, thanks to one of Littmann\u2019s inscriptions, it is possible to date them more precisely than hitherto, since it is highly probable that the \u201cyear of the war of the Nabateans\u201d (\u05e0\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d7\u05b2\u05e8\u05b5\u05d1 \u05e0\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd), which he has found cited (p. iv), is a reference to Trajan\u2019s campaign of A.D. 106. It is noteworthy that, whereas the Sinaitic and Nabatean inscriptions are Arabic solely as regards the proper names, those of \u1e62af\u0101 are entirely South Semitic; only one or two names (e.g. \u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4, p. 44) appear to be Jewish. On the other hand, the article is not \u05d0\u05b6, as in the Sinaitic proper names, but always \u05d0\u05b6 \u2014 apparently connected with the Lihyan \u05d0\u05b6. The alphabet, too, does not, like the Sinaitic and Nabatean, belong to the Aramaic branch, but, as Littmann\u2019s table shows, is closely related to the South Semitic scripts. Here it may be remarked that it is difficult to see upon what grounds a recent writer\u00b9 has asserted that the \u1e62af\u0101 alphabet is a link connecting the alphabets of the Southern Semites with the Ph\u0153nician, a view which must rest upon a preconceived notion of its antiquity. Though not ancient it is of some interest, since it is not improbable that some of the characters have survived in a modified form in the Arab cattle-wasms, specimens of which have been collected by Burton, Doughty, and others. These would then find their analogy in the \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 of the Greeks (as instanced in the \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 and \u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2), and the ancient house- or clan-marks of northern Europe, evidence in favour of a totemic origin being as yet wanting.\u00b2 Returning to Littmann\u2019s alphabet, we note that the character which he\n\n\u00b9 The Edinburgh Review, July, 1901, p. 46.\n\u00b2 Robertson Smith\u2019s conjecture (Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia, p. 312 sq.) that, since some of the old wasms appear to be pictorial in origin, they may have primarily represented totems, has not as yet been substantiated by the few wasms which have been published.\nidentifies as \u1e24 has the form of a rough circle, or even an oblong, either (as he suggests) a borrowing from the so-called proto-Arabic, or, more probably, a differentiation of \u1e25 (the 'view' of Praetorius). It is also noteworthy that his signs for \u1e21 (\u0635) and \u1e21 are practically identical with the South Arabian \u1e21 (\u0646) and \u1e21. These equations are difficult, and if substantiated will further complicate Semitic phonology. In a work of this nature, where so much pains has been taken to collect material to support the newly-proposed readings, it must sometimes happen that the evidence is of doubtful weight. When, for example, the validity of a proposed reading of a name is supported by a reference to a corresponding Arabic root, even though it may be \"zur Namenbildung wohl geeignet\" (p. 21), we are reminded of what Renan said of the Arabic lexicon. Moreover, the testimony of names from Greek inscriptions is of necessity sometimes ambiguous. It is certainly difficult to decide whether \u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 should be cited in support of \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd (p. 26), or whether, like \u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, it does not represent a form from the root \u1f00\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5. Similarly, \u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5, instead of supporting a form \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (p. 21), might, in all probability, like \u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1, go back to the Palmyrene \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 or \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2. Littmann's reading \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (p. 8) is, as the plate shows, far from certain. He supports it by the Sinaitic \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, which, as a matter of fact, could also be read \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (so Euting) or \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2. The Palmyrene name \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, which he cites in support of his reading \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (loc. cit.), is not necessarily from the same root (see Cook, Aramaic Glossary, s.v.). These criticisms, however, do not diminish the importance of Littmann's book, and the weight of the cumulative evidence favours the general correctness of his results.\n\nOn p. 17, \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, on the last line, is a misprint for \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, and for the statement on p. 34 that \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 is found in\nNabatean I can find no justification. The view that \\(\\alpha\\lambda\\omega\\upsilon\\phi\\alpha\\) and \\(\\alpha\\lambda\\alpha\\phi\\omega\\nu\\alpha\\sigma\\) come from \\(\\gamma\\lambda\\alpha\\) (p. 32, s. \\(\\gamma\\lambda\\alpha\\)) I fail to understand, since \\(\\alpha\\lambda\\alpha\\phi\\omega\\nu\\alpha\\sigma\\) occurs in a bilingual inscription where the corresponding Palmyrene reads \\(\\gamma\\lambda\\alpha\\eta\\gamma\\lambda\\alpha\\) (or rather \\(\\gamma\\lambda\\alpha\\eta\\gamma\\lambda\\alpha\\)).\n\nIn conclusion, it is worth remembering that although the thirty-one \u0160af\u0101 inscriptions which Graham published in this Journal do not appear to be absolutely trustworthy copies, yet, of the seventeen identifications which he proposed more than forty years ago, nearly half of them still hold good, and two even (\\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\eta\\)), though unrecognized by Hal\u00e9vy, are now substantiated by Littmann himself. Whilst we desire to give Graham's work that prominence which is justly due to every pioneer, our admiration for the patient investigation of later decipherers undergoes no diminution. We shall look forward to the publication of the results of the American Archaeological Expedition (of the importance of which we gain some idea from Mr. Butler's report in the American Journal of Archaeology, vol. iv), and shall await with special interest the appearance of Herr Littmann's edition of the newly-found inscriptions.\n\nS. A. C.\n\nF. H. Weissbach. Die Sumerische Frage. (Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1898. 10s.)\n\nOne feels inclined to call this book the description of a modern 'comedy of errors,' for in it is described the process of evolution of the study of the so-called Sumerian language found in the cuneiform tablets. The author gives, in the first half of his book, a minute historical and chronological description of all the views which have hitherto been enunciated concerning the nature and character of this language; the contending notions entertained by Hal\u00e9vy as well as those of\n\n---\n\n1 See J. Mordtmann, Palmyrenisches, p. 26, in the Mitteilungen d. Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft, 1899, 1.\nThe whole discussion turns mainly round the point raised first by Hal\u00e9vy as to whether there is any truth in the assumption that the so-called bilingual tablets and inscriptions contain a different language or only a variation in the script alone, i.e. whether they represent a different language, called by Oppert Sumerian, or only a different way of writing. The majority of scholars hold to the former theory. In the second part of his book Herr Weissbach treats us to his views on the subject. Whilst in the first he proves to be painstaking and accurate, and therefore reliable, giving a clear picture of the constantly changing views of the representatives of Assyriology, groping slowly from one error to another, and emancipating themselves step by step from those mistakes; in the second he is no less biased and unreliable than all his compeers. It makes one doubt his qualification to discuss with authority the problem when we find him referring to modern argot and thieves' language as arguments. No one can doubt the fundamental fact that hitherto no clear and unequivocal reference to this language as a distinct and different one from the other (Assyrian) has been found, which, to say the least, is very surprising, considering the large number of such so-called bilingual texts. It can also not be doubted that this language is thoroughly permeated with Semitic words; not one single purely Sumerian text has been found free of these elements, which even predominate in all the texts hitherto recovered. An argument such as the following cannot be taken as serious. It is advanced by the author as an explanation of the fact, that we find in the Assyrian cuneiform script, signs for the purely Semitic sounds K, T, S, and H. The author remarks, \"In modern Persian the Arabic sign \u0121 is also found in Iranian words, and Semitic signs have been adopted for Non-Semitic words. We are therefore justified in believing that the Assyrians could have done the same in adopting the script of another language\" (p. 147). The author forgets that it is a totally different thing to adopt signs already in existence and to adapt them to the new requirements\u2014as has happened with the alphabet\nin its migration from East to West, where afterwards the superfluous signs have often disappeared\u2014and, on the contrary, to adopt signs which could not originally have existed at all. For if the inventors of the cuneiform script, according to the current theory, were a people of a non-Semitic origin, not having such sounds in their language, they would not idly invent signs which would be of no use to them. If they then originated that system of writing they must have had these purely Semitic sounds in their language, and must have therefore been a Semitic people. It is premature, however, to fix definitely as yet the true character of that language with the still scant knowledge of the so-called Sumerian. A solution will be found if we admit that these bilingual texts represent two different Semitic languages, one more pure, the other mixed, and in a later period, with non-Semitic elements, but still not so much as to be considered as a different language altogether. Hence the silence as to a distinct name, hence its pronounced Semitic phonetics, and some portions of the grammatical structure. In conclusion, the wish may be expressed that henceforth, if possible, the discussion be kept free from the personal element that has contributed so much to obscure the issue. The author of this book has also not been able to withstand temptation.\n\nRev. Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby. Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan Calendars, with Rules and Tables and Explanatory Notes on the Julian and Gregorian Calendars. 4to. (London: George Bell & Sons, 1901. 21s.)\n\nSince Sachau's edition of Albiruni's \"Chronology of Ancient Nations\" no more important contribution to this question has appeared in English\u2014nay, in any other language. The subject is not a popular one, and somewhat remote from the daily necessities. It requires some of the idealism of the classical scholar and of the mathematician who revels in abstract theorems, to tackle so delicate and intricate\na problem as the elucidation of the Jewish Calendar. The Muhammadan runs on more smooth lines as far as its original history is concerned, and its governing principles. Not so the former, the origin and history of which are involved in great obscurity. At the time when it appears it is fully developed, and so carefully worked out that during the sixteen hundred years since it has been known not a single alteration has been made to it. With great acumen the Rev. S. B. Burnaby tries to lay bare the guiding principles, and to unravel partly, if not the history, at least the practical manipulation of the system. He is right in asserting that the Calendar, as now known and observed by the Jews, is the one promulgated by the Prince Hillel II, whose computations agree with those of Hipparchus. The whole system is then elaborately described, and numerous tables help to make the book almost indispensable for anyone interested in the Calendar. The author has been able to show that even the best of scholars who have studied the Calendar have gone astray in some details; notably important is his statement that the Kebi\u00f3th are not stationary. A valuable contribution is the disquisition on the Megillath Taanith (p. 240 ff). No less lucid and instructive is the description of the Muhammadan Calendar and of the Julian and Gregorian. The book is the work of a thorough scholar and a master of his subject, and can confidently be relied upon.\n\nM. G.\n\nW. Skeat. Fables and Folk Tales from an Eastern Forest. Illustrated by F. H. Townsend. (Cambridge, 1901.)\n\nThe author of \"Malay Magic\" presents us here with specimens of folk-tales collected from the same Malayan sources. It is a delightful publication from every point of view, and Mr. Skeat is to be urged on to the publication of all the materials he has collected, if, as we may assume, they are of a similar character. Out of the twenty-six\ntales, seventeen are purely animal stories, told in the very language of the East, though shorn of its redundancy, but not adapted to European standards. The poetry of the animal world in tales and fables is being enriched by the lithe and lovable \"Friend Mouse-deer,\" which takes the place of the fox of the Western world. All the tales are taken from the mouth of the local Malay story-teller, and the scholarly reputation of the author warrants the genuineness of the materials thus collected. It is a pity that the folkloristic side of the tales has been completely neglected. When the rest is so good one is often given to ask for more. Many of these tales throw a new light on old acquaintances, which appear here under a somewhat changed form, of great value for comparative studies. I cannot discuss each of them separately. Only a few may be mentioned, for they struck me specially when reading them. The very first, as pointed out by the author in the notes\u2014which, by the way, are, for the rest, of a more philological character\u2014belongs to a circle of well-known tales, connected only in the East with the name of King Solomon. This points to the fact that they must have come with the Islam. This parallel occurs among the so-called Parables of King Solomon as \"The Three Advices.\" No. iv, \"Who Killed the Otter's Babies?\" is a variant of one of the stories of the Noodles, in which an innocent man, by a chain of curious argumentation, is proved to be the culprit, and is punished for a crime of which he is not aware even in the remotest degree. Of the highest interest to me is the following, No. v, \"A Vegetarian Dispute,\" which I intend studying more fully elsewhere. For I see in it the only known Eastern variant of one of the most curious Byzantine legends, viz. the \"Condemnatio Uvae\" (v. Krummbacher, p. 884). To the circle of \"The Ungrateful Animal\" belongs No. viii, with the difference that in the Western tales it is the snake, in the Malay version the tiger, who is caught by his own wickedness. In No. xv we have the Oriental version of the old French fablieau of \"Les trois bossus.\" To the tale of the \"Courageous Gipsy,\" or Cosquin No. viii in a more\nmodernized form, belongs No. xiii. In the Rumanian; etc., tales he threatens to eat the devil, and the latter runs away, just as in the Malay the Mouse-deer threatens to eat the tiger, and feigns to be grateful to the ape for decoying the tiger to his destruction, by which he frightens the latter away.\n\nThe illustrations are spirited, and the book a pleasant instalment of more good things to come from the \"Eastern Forest.\"\n\nM. G.\n\nRapport sur une Mission Scientifique en Turquie d'Asie, par Dom J. Parisot. Extrait des Nouvelles Archives des Missions Scientifiques, t. ix. (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1900.)\n\nThe object of Dom Parisot's mission was twofold\u2014(1) to investigate the Neo-Syriac dialect of Ma'l\u016bl\u0101; and (2) to study the music of this part of Asia Minor, and to make a collection of traditional airs sacred and secular.\n\nThe three villages of Jub'\u0101din, Ma'l\u016bl\u0101, and Bakha, comprising in all some 1,500 inhabitants, form a small linguistic island, in which Syriac has continued to flourish, while all the rest of Asia Minor has been submerged by the flood of Arabic. Dom Parisot has already dealt with this interesting survival in his articles on \"Le dialecte de Ma'l\u016bl\u0101\" published in the Journal Asiatique. The present Report is almost wholly occupied with the musical question, and contains, in addition to an account of the various musical systems, a collection of 358 traditional airs. These are classified as (1) Maronite, (2) Arabic ecclesiastical, (3) Arabic secular, (4) Syrian, (5) Chaldaean; and, as an appendix, are added a number of Israelitish melodies of the Jews of Jerusalem. In a short introduction Dom Parisot explains the peculiarities of tonality and the construction of the musical scale which are characteristic of each of these sections.\nThe study of Oriental music from a European standpoint is one which can only be undertaken profitably by those few scholars who possess a very rare combination of gifts. As a rule, Orientalists are not musicians, and musicians are not Orientalists in any sense of the word; but, apart from this fact, the scientific grasp of the principles of any foreign musical system, and still more, perhaps, its artistic appreciation, present difficulties which can only be surmounted by years of patient study and actual experience.\n\nFor the present, the most important task is to rescue from oblivion all such musical systems as are in danger of passing away without record; and from this point of view\u2014that of providing trustworthy material for the future investigator\u2014the present Report is most acceptable. The collection of so many traditional airs must have been a task of much patience. How truly Dom Parisot's words, explaining one of his difficulties in securing the correct reading in every case, will come home to all who have had much to do with singers!\u2014\"L\u00e0-bas, plus qu'ailleurs, celui qu'on pr\u00e9sente comme le meilleur chanteur n'est pas toujours le plus s\u00fbr.

Von Dr. M. Streck. Theil ii. (Leiden: Brill, 1901.)\n\nWith commendable promptitude Dr. Streck has now issued the second part of his work, but with the thorough-going method that he follows at least two parts more must yet be written to complete his survey of Babylonia. The present instalment describes the course of the Tigris, with the cities on either bank, from Takrit, the first town of \u1e6c\u0101\u1e33 on the river a hundred miles above Baghdad, down to W\u0101sit, below which city the Tigris flows out into the Great Swamps. An interesting chapter (pp. 182\u2013219) is devoted to the topography of S\u0101marr\u0101, the capital during more than half a century of the Abbasid Caliphs. Dr. Streck, following\nY\u0101k\u016bb\u012b gives details of the many palaces which Mu'tasim and his successors erected there, and next describes the five main thoroughfares which traversed the newly-built city. It is perhaps a pity that the writer, at this point, did not prevail on his publishers to supply a ground-plan of medi\u00e6val S\u0101marr\u0101, which could easily have been constructed from the detailed description of Ya'k\u016bb\u012b and other contemporaries; it would have been interesting to see how the triangulation of main streets and canals could have been worked out.\n\nComing down below Baghdad, Dr. Streck gives a long account of Al-Mad\u0101in, or 'the Cities,' as the Arabs named the complex of seven hamlets that stood among the ruins of Ctesiphon and Seleucia. On p. 270 our author sums up the evidence as to 'the seven,' too long to quote here, but which may be recommended to geographers interested in the subject. Passing on to K\u016bt-al-'Am\u0101rah, Dr. Streck points out that the Tigris during the middle ages flowed down the course now known as the Shatt-al-Hay, past W\u0101sit to the Swamps, this being the all-important fact for understanding the geography of the country during the period of the 'Abbasid Caliphate. At the present day the Tigris takes a more easterly course below K\u016bt-al-'Am\u0101rah, but Dr. Streck makes no attempt to solve the problem as to the date when this important change of the Tigris bed took place.\n\nThe description of W\u0101sit is all that can be desired; our author, however, implies (p. 332) that W\u0101sit never recovered from the Mongol sack in the time of H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, A.D. 1258. This is far from being exact; W\u0101sit must still have been a populous city when the geographer Kuzwini was Judge (K\u0101d\u012b) there in the latter half of the thirteenth century A.D., and W\u0101sit continued to be the chief town of Lower Babylonia till the close of the following century, when the place was taken and sacked by the armies of Timur. In conclusion, we may note that the word Mashra'at can hardly be rightly translated (p. 327) as 'Strassenecke': the very anecdote which Dr. Streck quotes\u2014us to how the governor Hajj\u0101j\nhaving been sent an Indian elephant as a present, the great quadruped was landed from the boat at the Mashra'at-al-Fil\u2014shows plainly that the term must be translated by 'wharf,' and this Elephant's Wharf in later times continued to be a well-known place in W\u0101sit.\n\nIt is to be hoped that in the next instalment Dr. Streck will give us a map of Babylonia.\n\nG. Le S.\n\nDr. Gustaf H. Dalman. Aramaeisch-Neuhebraeisches Woerterbuch zu Targum, Talmud, und Midrasch. Vol. ii. (Frankfurt a/M.: J. Kauffmann, 1901.)\n\nAfter six years Professor Dalman has at last finished the Dictionary to the Targum, Talmud, and Midrash, the first part of which had been reviewed by me in this Journal in 1894. The second and concluding volume partakes of the same characteristics then briefly commented upon. It is the first attempt of a complete dictionary of this language in a concise form and at a reasonable price. It will prove indispensable to the beginner, and it is marked by the accuracy which Professor Dalman sometimes overdoes in his desire of giving a correct vocalization and in amending what he believes to be incorrect and corrupt readings in the Midrashic texts. In the first instance he follows in too slavish a manner the Yemenite tradition, adding to it his own interpretation of it. It is specially noticeable in the punctuation and in the placing of the Daggesh in many words where there is no cogent reason to assume that the letters had been pronounced as Tenues. It is a mistake to adopt the biblical tradition as a guide for post-biblical and non-Hebrew words. The rules which guided the Massorites cannot be safely applied to any book outside the sacred Canon, for as often as not the Massoretic tradition deviates from those general rules. A disjunctive accent at once changes the character of an initial letter in the following word, but where is one to look for a similar tradition in texts without accents or vowels based on ancient tradition?\nA practical example will show how insufficient the reason is which has guided Professor Dalman in the manner of his punctuation and vocalization. According to him, words with initial \u03a7 (\u03ba), though derived from the Greek, like \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, ought to have the first letter hard, and we find the word in question in the Dictionary with a Daggesh, thus suggesting that it had been so pronounced in ancient times. It is absolutely incorrect and misleading. A Hebrew biblical word in that position would require, if standing absolute, to have the initial letter -\u03a7 with Daggesh, but this rule not only does not hold good for New Hebrew, but is in truth not correct, as proved by the examples derived from the Greek, or in later times from the Latin, when \u03a7 was surely pronounced soft = \u03c7. Nor can we understand the reason for the vocalization 'Lolab,' when the traditional form is 'Lulab'; there is no grammatical necessity for deviating from this latter form. Why has the author included in his Vocabulary the doubtful Sukkoth (Amos, v, 26), declaring at the same time in definite manner that it was the name of a god? Commentators of the Bible are not agreed upon it. But however many the differences may be between our views and those of the learned author, no one can gainsay that this publication is one of practical use and of great scientific value for the study of the texts written in Aramaic and New Hebrew. Numerous additions at the end of the volume show the book not to be perfect. But there is no limit to such possible additions, especially if we take into consideration the author's attempts at correcting the readings in the texts from which he borrows his materials. Almost every new MS. will offer variae lectiones. A German-Hebrew Index would have more than doubled the value of this publication, which, meritorious though it is, does not fully supersede the old and invaluable, but almost forgotten \"Semahh David\" of David a Portaleone.\n\nM. G.\nAsoka, the Buddhist Emperor of India. By Vincent A. Smith, M.R.A.S. pp. 204. (Rulers of India Series. Oxford Press. Price 3s. 6d.)\n\nI had undertaken to write the book on Asoka for this series, but the very scanty leisure available to me was not sufficient to enable me to get the work ready in time, and I was very glad to hear that Mr. Vincent Smith would undertake it. He has produced an admirable little book, just what was wanted, popular, and at the same time scholarly, giving in brief the cream of the results so far obtained by the study of such evidence as we have on the history of Asoka.\n\nThe main evidence is, of course, the edicts promulgated by Asoka himself, and engraved by his orders on stone pillars and rocks throughout his extensive empire. The ones already discovered amount in number to thirty-four, and it is not doubted that others will yet be found. But this evidence is supplemented, and often rendered intelligible, by other information derived from three sources\u2014the details, derived mostly from Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador at the court of Patna, which have been preserved in scanty and imperfect notices by later Greek writers; the statements, often correct and often legendary, of later Indian writers, including the Ceylon chroniclers; and the incidental references, often correct and often legendary, made by the Chinese pilgrims in the fourth, sixth, and eighth centuries, to the Buddhist shrines in India. Of these the Greek notices are the most reliable, being much older; and it is from Greek sources that the real date of Asoka has been fixed within a year or two. But the traditions of India, as handed down by the Sanskrit, Pali, and Chinese writers, though centuries later, have also preserved, amid much legend and distortion, material of value for the critical historian.\n\nThe plan of the book is accordingly very simple. In the first chapters, occupying about a hundred pages, the author gives an account, derived from all the sources, of\nthe historical facts ascertainable about Asoka and his monuments. There then follows a complete translation, occupying 45 pages, in English, of all the edicts. These have all been translated before, most of them several times; but these former translations are scattered through numerous learned publications; and this is the first time that the whole have been published consecutively in English. Then follows a summary, in 12 pages, of such traditions about Asoka, current in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. at Anur\u0101dhapura, as have been preserved in the Dipavamsa and the Mah\u0101vamsa; and finally, in the last chapter of 21 pages, we have a similar summary of such traditions about Asoka, current from the third to the seventh century in India, as have been preserved in the Asok\u0101vad\u0101na or by the Chinese pilgrims.\n\nThe first and most important part is exceedingly well done. Without entering into any lengthy or learned discussions, and simply ignoring the later traditions except in so far as they throw light on, or are confirmed by, the earlier evidence, the author, with sound judgment, and in well-written and easy style, tells us what the cultured reader, who has neither time nor inclination to study the edicts word for word, would wish to know. The translation of the edicts, chiefly based, of course, on the invaluable discussions and renderings of Senart and of B\u00fchler, is also a distinct success, both readable and accurate. For the object in view it was not desirable to enter into discussion with the great scholars who have differed in the interpretation of isolated words; but occasionally, in cases of importance, such divergences are referred to in the few short notes, which are brief and clear, and well chosen. It was a happy idea of the author to put a title to each edict; and the titles chosen are such as assist the reader to appreciate more clearly the object the royal author of the edicts had in view.\n\nOne of the most distinguished of our Honorary Members is said to have advised the author of a learned work: \"Be sure to leave an error or two. You really must think of\nthe poor reviewer!\" And I suppose, as a reviewer, one ought to find some fault. It is not easy; but there are two objects of Mr. Vincent Smith's antipathy I should like to say a word for. He says (p. 7) that he has\u2014\n\n\"shunned the pedantic atrocities of international transliteration systems, which do not shrink from presenting Krishna in the guise of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Champ\u0101 as Kamp\u0101, and so on.\"\n\nNow this is really very funny. For the international system expressly contemplates the use in popular works of such forms as Krishna (which may fairly be regarded as an English word); and it has expressly rejected the italic k as a representation of the sound of the English ch. One is sorry to find so sound a scholar, who all through the book transliterates rightly enough, going over, on grounds so mistaken, to the camp of the enemy. Correct transliteration is, on practical grounds, a considerable aid to the spread of knowledge, and it will, sooner or later, be generally adopted. The international system has been very carefully considered by a number of scholars of some eminence, for whom the author has, no doubt, a sincere respect; and it has been formally recognized by the Society. But it has still to contend against that sort of sentimental antipathy to which the author gives such forcible expression. And his phrase may be used by the opponents of correct transliteration, who will not, perhaps, always think it necessary to add that his actual practice shows him to be really on the other side.\n\nThe other case is of a similar kind. The author seems unable to mention the Ceylon chroniclers\u2014the unknown author of the D\u012bpavamsa, and Mah\u0101n\u0101ma the author of the Mah\u0101vamsa\u2014without a strange ferocity. Three or four times he stops to turn and rend these unfortunate old writers. Are they really so much more mendacious than other chroniclers\u2014the English ones, for instance? Is it quite so certain that they deliberately invented lies? Another hypothesis is at least equally possible, namely,\nthat they were placing on record the tradition current at\nthe time and place when they wrote, and that they were\nquite sincere in supposing themselves to be contributing\nuseful work in doing so. Those traditions must, of course,\nbe used under the guidance of the accepted laws of\nhistorical criticism relating to the use of such material.\nBut it is quite feasible to observe those laws without\nforgetting the debt of gratitude we owe to the author\nwhose work the original decipherer of Asoka's edicts found\nso indispensable a help. Mah\u0101n\u0101ma was a monk, it must\nbe admitted. But so also were the English chroniclers,\nand the Chinese pilgrims. He believed in the miraculous.\nSo did they. He has preserved traditions, quite useful as\nevidence of the belief in his time, and of little or no\nvalue as evidence of events centuries before. So did\nthey. He tells us legends which he himself believed, and\nwhich we do not. But so did the Chinese pilgrims, of\nwhom Mr. Vincent Smith, very rightly, speaks with courtesy\nand respect, simply ignoring their miracles, and making\nwhat use is critically possible of what else they say. In\nthese two just parallel cases the author's treatment of the\npilgrims is an excellent model of what the treatment of\nthe chroniclers might have been. And if I, personally, in\nthe case of the famous old pilgrim, would confess, further,\nto a feeling of affectionate regard towards the personality\nrevealed in the \"Life\" and the \"Travels,\" it may be\nremembered that we know but little of the personality of\nMah\u0101n\u0101ma, and that we may not be so far wrong, after\nall, if we give him the benefit of the doubt (to which even an\naccused person is usually considered entitled), and suppose\nthat he, too, may have been a fairly estimable man.\n\nOne point is quite certain. The chronology found in the\nchronicles is not the work of Mah\u0101n\u0101ma. Even if it be a\nmendacious fiction (and mistakes in chronology may be due to\nother causes than that), it existed already before the time of\nthe author of the Dipavamsa, who was some generations older\nthan Mah\u0101n\u0101ma. Mah\u0101n\u0101ma would at once, therefore, on\nthis issue, be declared by an impartial court \"not guilty.\"\nAnd in a greater or less degree the same argument holds good of most of the other cases in which the author sees fit to reject Mah\u0101n\u0101ma's testimony. It would almost seem that the author, when speaking of the chronicles as \"a tissue of absurdities\" or as \"mendacious monkish legends,\" is scarcely on a line with the universal opinion of modern scholars about such works. He says elsewhere (J.R.A.S., 1901, p. 843) of two similar documents\u2014\n\n\"If, then, one is pure fiction and the other is serious history, the distinction is certainly not apparent on the face of the documents.\"\n\nBut, surely, the unanimous verdict of other scholars would be quite simple. Neither is either. No one dreams of taking such late legends, preserved centuries after the event by well-meaning but biased monks, learned only in the learning of their time\u2014whether English, Chinese, or Sinhalese\u2014as sober history. No one expects to find such chroniclers versed in historical criticism; or even averse to recording what we now think absurd. On the other hand, the hypothesis of deliberate lying, of conscious forgery, is now in such cases generally discredited; and it is not supposed that such legends are, on the part of the chroniclers, pure fiction. It is difficult, therefore, to understand why any hard words should be necessary at all in this particular case, and we are quite unable to see any essential difference between the Ceylon Bhikshus and the Chinese pilgrims.\n\nBut the reader will see that the expressions objected to are merely obiter dicta. They have nothing to do with the main line of the argument. Their effect is only therefore to jar upon the reader, not to impair the value of this very able sketch of Asoka, certainly the greatest native sovereign in India, and one of the most interesting and impressive personalities among the sovereigns of the world.\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\nR\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drap\u0101la Paripr\u0325cch\u0101, publi\u00e9 par L. Finot. 8vo.\nVol. ii: pp. xvi and 69. (St. Petersburg: Imperial Academy, Bibliotheca Buddhica, 1901.)\n\nIt is a great pleasure to see the Buddhist Sanskrit Text Series, inaugurated and managed by Professor Serge d'Oldenbourg, and published at the expense of the Russian Government, now beginning to become an accomplished fact. The present work is little more than a tract, and the text would occupy, if printed after the method followed by the Pali Text Society, about 40 to 50 pages. It is in form a J\u0101taka. The first half, called the Nid\u0101na, corresponds to the Introductory story preceding each of the J\u0101takas in the Pitaka Collection edited by Faub\u00f6ll. The second half gives the J\u0101taka proper, the story of Pu\u1e47yara\u015bmi.\n\nIn the Introduction we have a discussion of the qualities of a Bodhisatwa, that is, those that have to be acquired by a man in order to become a Buddha, and of the qualities obstructive to that end. In the course of this discussion the Buddha tells R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drap\u0101la of the qualities he acquired in fifty of his previous births. As the editor points out (p. vi), there are similar enumerations in the Lalita Vistara and in the Mah\u0101vastu. He might have added that a similar list is also found in the Introduction (also called the Nid\u0101na) to the canonical collection of J\u0101takas; and that two whole books, one in Pali and one in Sanskrit, the Cariy\u0101 Pitaka and the J\u0101taka M\u0101l\u0101, are based on a precisely similar enumeration.\n\nIn my Buddhist Birth Stories\u00b9 there was given, twenty years ago, a comparative table of the J\u0101takas thus referred to in these two books, and it would have been interesting to have had a comparative table here showing the relation in which this new list stands to the older ones. In the books the stories are told; in this Nid\u0101na, as in the Nid\u0101na to the J\u0101takas, they are only referred to. And Professor d'Oldenbourg has given a valuable table identifying two-thirds of them. It is particularly interesting to find that\n\n\u00b9 London, 1880. Table iv, p. xviii.\nso many of these Birth Stories, perhaps half of them, cannot be traced in the canonical collection. We are frequently finding Birth Stories, both in Pali and in Sanskrit sources, not included in it. It was certainly, even when it was made, by no means complete. But other stories may have been subsequently invented; and a careful discussion of the facts, on this one point, now ascertainable, would already give valuable results towards the history of the literature.\n\nThere are added to the book two indices, one of verses and one of proper names. Both of these are most useful. But there is no index of subjects, or of Buddhist technical terms used in the text. It is most desirable that in every future volume published in this series such indices should be provided. For many historical enquiries it is of the first importance to know when a particular idea was first introduced, where and in what degree it was subsequently modified, and how late its existence can be certified. Certain words or phrases are not found in the earliest books, certain other words have changed their exact meaning in the course of time, certain other words are not found after a particular epoch. Abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, for instance, is, in the Suttantas, used only in a general way in the meaning of 'insight.' Later on, a specific group of six kinds of insight, the Chal-abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, has become a common phrase. In this text we find, not six, but five abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101s. There is a similar history, as yet not traced out, of the idea Paramit\u0101, which in this text are six in number, not ten; and so also of the enumeration of wrong doctrines, speculations (Ditthi), which are here referred to as one hundred, and not sixty-two, in number. The ideas of the five gatis, or forms of rebirth, of the eightfold Path, of the Great Person (the Mah\u0101 Puru\u1e63a) are found here in a form apparently quite the same as they had in the oldest documents. But the Four Bonds, obstacles which keep a man back from becoming a Buddha, are here mentioned (on p. 20) possibly for the\n\n1 No. 8, the \u015aibi Birth, is no doubt the same as the Sivi J\u0101taka, No. 499 in the canonical collection.\nfirst time. In the investigation of any of these questions\u2014and they could be multiplied almost indefinitely\u2014it is evident that good subject indices not only save time, but are practically indispensable.\n\nThe examples cited in the last paragraph show how closely this text adheres to the older phraseology. There are differences no doubt, slight differences, but each of these is valuable as historical evidence. Often, too, a comparison with the older texts throws light on later readings, an assistance of which M. Senart, to whom the present work is dedicated, has so often availed himself in his monumental edition of the Mah\u0101vastu. Thus, to cite only one example, M. Finot, at p. 49, has rejected the reading chinna-prap\u0101ta of his unique MS. in favour of a conjecture supported by the Chinese. A comparison with D. 2. 162 (that is, the Mah\u0101 Parinibb\u0101na Suttanta, chap. vi) would have shown that the Chinese author is probably wrong; he has misunderstood a rare and difficult phrase taken over by our author from old tradition, and the manuscript reading is right.\n\nOne of the differences, probably the chief one, between this text and the older ones, is the importance it attaches to Bodhisatvaship, practically ignoring the older ideal of Arahatship. Already in 1880, when we had but little Mah\u0101y\u0101na writing before us, I pointed out, for the first time, the importance of this distinction, and ventured to call it \"the keynote of the Great Vehicle.\" It was impossible then to go into detail and show how far the two ethical ideals were different. The Pali texts have now given us full evidence as to the details of the Bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma, the constituent qualities of Arahatship, and their opposites. The present work gives us similar details as to Bodhisatvaship. It would now, therefore, be most interesting to have a careful comparison, carried out into full detail, between the two ideals; and comparing the intermediate stage as represented in the Mah\u0101vastu.\n\n1 Hibbert Lectures, pp. 254, 255.\nIn language and metre the R\u0101strap\u0101la Paripr\u0113ch\u0101 approximates already to the stage reached when Sanskrit became the literary language of India. But there are many of the earlier prakritisms still left, of which M. Finot gives instances in his introduction. He also furnishes a list of the metres, utilizing for that purpose the names afterwards given to metres by the writers on Sanskrit prosody. The list is a goodly one, and will be found suggestive when the history of Indian metres comes to be written.\n\nAltogether this little volume is full of matter to help in the solution of the many historical problems\u2014literary, religious, and social\u2014that now lie ready to the hand of any scholar who has leisure to devote to them. On its probable date the editor has nothing to say. But he mentions that four passages, amounting altogether to about 70 lines, are cited from the present work in the \u015aik\u1e63\u0101 Samuccaya, now being edited by Professor Bendall for the same series; and a list of those readings in the citations which differ from the text here printed has been supplied by Professor Bendall. These citations give us a terminus ad quem for the date of the story; and a discussion of the points of doctrine referred to in the text, and of the names of Bodhisatvas said in it to have been in attendance on the Buddha, would have gone far to settle its approximate date as compared with that of other Buddhist texts. M. Finot mentions Chinese and Tibetan versions; but he does not say whether these are based on our text, a retelling of the story in different words, or whether they are actually what we should now call translations. It has been pointed out in our last volume (p. 406) how important it is that this distinction should be observed.\n\nWe hope that the learned and able editor will be able to find time, amid his important duties as Director of the Oriental School in Saigon, to discuss some of the questions above referred to. Meanwhile we can heartily congratulate him on the present work; and may venture to express the hope that the other volumes in preparation may soon appear:\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\nNOTICE SUR LA VIE ET LES TRAVAUX DE JOACHIM MENANT.\n\nPar M. LE DUC DE LA TREMOILLE. (Paris, 1901.)\n\nThe interesting biographical notice of the late M. Menant, published by the Duke de la Tremoille in the Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, has been reprinted in quarto form, with an excellent heliogravure of the deceased Assyriologist prefixed.\n\nM. Menant, who, like many others, devoted himself to study in the midst of other occupations, was born in 1820, and died in 1899. He will be remembered as having worked, when the science of Assyriology was young, with Professor Oppert, the veteran Assyriologist, and became, with him, a pioneer of the study in France, turning his attention also, in later years, to the decipherment of the hieroglyphic system of writing generally called Hittite. He was elected a free member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres in 1888. His works were very numerous (a list of forty-seven of his principal publications are given by the author of the notice), one of the last being the Catalogue m\u00e9thodique et raisonn\u00e9 de la Collection de Clercq, a splendid work of extreme utility, by which the owner of the collection, as well as M. Menant, earned the thanks of the learned world. M. Menant likewise wrote concerning the Yezidis, and upon ancient and modern Persia. By his death, a noteworthy and much-respected personality, linking the present and the past in the Assyriological world, disappeared, to the regret of all who had come into contact with him.\n\nT. G. P.\n\nFour Egyptological papers have appeared from the pen of that indefatigable Egyptologist of the Museum of Brussels, M. Jean Capart. His En \u00c9gypte : Notes de Voyage are exceedingly interesting, and are illustrated by some excellent reproductions of photographs. The paper is naturally mainly archaeological, but observations upon the\ncountry as it is at present occur in it, and are noteworthy. Concerning the belief of the Arabs as to the treasures to be found among the ruins, the following (probably an anecdote well known to those who have travelled in that land) is interesting:\n\n\"Au dire des Arabes, les ruines des temples et des tombeaux sont pleines de tr\u00e9sors, sans cela comment expliquer que l'on vienne de si loin pour y faire des fouilles? N'est-ce pas, comme ils le racontent, dans les pyramides de M\u00e9ro\u00e9 que Lepsius a trouv\u00e9 l'or qui, quelques ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s son voyage, permit \u00e0 l'Allemagne de battre la France?\"\n\nAnother paper by the same author is entitled *Une D\u00e9esse th\u00e9baine : Miritskro*, and treats of the deity in the form of a serpent adored on the great Western Peak (\"la grande cime d'Occident\"). The royal tombs there add to the desolation of this mountain, in which lifeless place the goddess was worshipped. The meaning of her name ('lover of silence') is just what one would expect to find applied to a divinity dwelling there. Pictures of the goddess in the form of a serpent, as a serpent with a woman's head, as a woman having a serpent's head, and as a serpent with three heads, one of a woman and two of serpents, are shown. A very interesting account of the worship is given.\n\nTo the periodical *Man* M. Capart contributes an article on the \"Libyan Notes\" of Messrs. MacIver and Wilkin. Based on these researches, M. Capart puts forward two hypotheses: Either the prehistoric Egyptians were for the most part Libyans, or at the moment of the entry of the Pharaonic Egyptians into Egypt, the Libyans were also on the point of invading the country, which they surrounded from the west of the Delta as far as Upper Nubia. In this case the Pharaohs, to consolidate their power, had to fight with the native population, and repel, at the same time, the Libyan invasion. This hypothesis, he says, is more simple than the other if the Libyans formed the bulk of the population in Egypt.\nThe fourth contribution of M. Capart to the science of Egyptology is entitled \"La F\u00eate de frapper les Anou,\" and appears in the Transactions of the First Congress for the History of Religion, which saw the light at Paris last year. Taking as his text the palettes of slaty schist found by Mr. Quibell at Hieraconpolis, he examines once again these much-discussed objects. In his opinion, they bear representations of a festival, that called in the calendar of Palermo \"the destruction of the Anu,\" as has been suggested by M. Naville; and the victory of Nar-Mer over the inhabitants of the Delta, north of the Fayoum, as Spiegelberg has shown. M. Capart then goes on to show how important this people, the Anu of Nubia, were, and that they are to be classed among the original inhabitants of the country, separated by the Pharaonic invasion from their kin of the north; and their expulsion was such a triumph, that it was celebrated thereafter by the Egyptians during the history of their rule. Remarks upon the religion of the Egyptians, the festival in question, and the names of towns containing the element an, etc., are added by the author, giving to the paper additional interest and value.\n\nFull of information is the paper by the Baron von Oefele entitled Vorhippokratische Medizin Westasiens, Aegyptens, und der mediterranen Vorarier, in the Handbuch der Geschichte der Medizin. Though discursive, it is a valuable contribution to the literature of the subject. Medical science in pre-Arian India, among the old Nubian peoples, \"in the land of the gods and of incense\" (the neighbourhood of the Red Sea), among the north-west Africans, with the Trojans, etc., etc., are all treated of. One could have wished for a better arrangement of the material, but there are probably many who will find it all that could be wished, and, after all, the facts brought together are the main thing. I greatly regret that I cannot follow the author in much that he says about the literature bearing upon the subject found in Babylonia and Assyria (quite apart from the difficulty of the reading of medical texts by those who are not medical men, to which the author refers). My translation of the\ninscription on a physician's cylinder-seal, for instance, differs entirely from that given in this paper.\n\nNevertheless, Dr. von Oefele evidently has an excellent knowledge of the tablets bearing upon the medical knowledge of the Babylonians and Assyrians. He refers to the opinions of the ancient Sumerians (Akkadians) with regard to the human body. The seat of understanding was the heart, the body is designated as \"flesh,\" and the blood is the life of the body. The central organ for the blood, however, was the liver. \"Heart and liver\" was used to the latest times for \"soul and body.\" The central organ of the will is the ear. Arterial blood and venous blood were distinguished. As some of these points are not universally accepted, a few extracts giving examples of these ideas would have added greatly to the value of this part of the paper. With regard to the expressions for arterial and venous blood, however, it may be noted that they were not \"blood of the day (?)\u201d and \"blood of the night (?),\" but \"light blood\" and \"dark blood\" respectively.\n\nT. G. P.\n\nKeilinschriftliche Bibliothek, in Verbindung mit L. Abel, C. Bezold, P. Jensen, F. E. Peiser, H. Winckler, herausgegeben von Eberhard Schrader Band VI, Theil 1: Assyrische-babylonische Mythen und Epen, von P. Jensen. (Berlin: Reuther & Reichard, 1900-1901.)\n\nNotwithstanding that the state of his health renders it difficult for the Father of Assyriology in Germany to do much original work, his editorship of these volumes of the Assyrian Library is a thing of extreme usefulness. It is impossible to have any other feeling for the veteran Professor of the University of Berlin than affectionate regard, mingled with admiration for his past work and his courage under affliction, and all will wish him a long life and a useful one to edit this series of texts in transcription and translation, and sincerely hope that he may yet have health to contribute many things to this collection himself.\nThe present work is one of the most comprehensive that has ever been published, and Professor Jensen's contributions to it among the most characteristic and noteworthy. In the present volume we have eleven of the most complete of the legends of Babylonia, including\u2014\n\nThe legends of the Creation.\nBel and the L\u00c1Bbu (as the author has it).\nMyths of Z\u016b, the storm-bird.\nThe I(U)ra-myth.\nNerigal and Ere\u0161kigal.\nI\u0161tar's descent into Hades.\nAdapa and the south wind.\nThe Etana-myth.\nThe Gilgame\u0161 (Nimrod)-Epos.\n\u00caa (?) and Atar-\u1e25asis (?).\nThe King of Cutha.\n\nThe system used in this \"Assyriological Library,\" edited by Professor Schrader, is, to give the Assyrian (Semitic-Babylonian) transcription on the left-hand page, line for line, numbered, and the translation on the right-hand page (where, however, the lines are unfortunately not numbered, making it rather unsatisfactory, notwithstanding the careful folding, to find the corresponding lines except where near the beginning or the end of a page or a paragraph). At the end of the book is a commentary, giving the reasons why any particular translation of a word or a phrase has been chosen, or the other possible renderings. Doubtful passages are indicated by italics and queries.\n\nThe translations are besprinkled with all Professor Jensen's peculiarities and mannerisms. Thus, the doubt between \\( b \\) and \\( p \\), \\( k \\) and \\( q \\), is represented by printing both letters \\((ab(p)-k(k)al-lu, ti-is(z, s)-b(p)u-tu, etc.)\\), and in the translations possible alternative renderings are indicated in much the same way. Other devices give a picturesque (though not always comprehensible) appearance to the translations:\u2014\n\u201cErschlag\u2019 mich nicht, mein Bruder! Ich will dir\n\u201ceine Rede sagen.\u201d\n\u201c[Von Ni]a-\u1e25ar-bi\u0161 ihre Verw\u00fcnschung erhebe sich\n(gegen) dich (, dich)! \u201d\n\nNaturally such a work as this is difficult to review within\nthe compass of a short notice on account of its extent (it\nruns to 301 pages of transcription and translation, and 288\npages of notes thereon). All that can be said is, that these\nnew renderings bring many improvements into the trans-\nlations of the inscriptions as hitherto known, and suggest\na number of other possible alternative readings, which may\nor may not be adopted later on. It is unfortunate that,\nin the Story of Bel and the Dragon (the Semitic account\nof the Creation), the author was unable to use the fragments\nlately published by the Trustees of the British Museum, as\nthat completing the second tablet\\(^1\\) is important, especially\nin connection with the reverse of the duplicate of the first\ntablet, found by Mr. Rassam at Abu-habbah, and published\nby me in 1890.\n\nThe new renderings which he introduces into the translation\nof the first tablet of the Creation series are important, though\nit remains to be seen whether they will stand in every\nrespect the test of time. Thus ammatum, generally rendered\n\u2018earth\u2019 (its connection with the Heb. all Assyrio-\nlogists must have seen), he now translates by \u2018die Feste\u2019\n(in italics, implying uncertainty). For the much-discussed\nword mummu he gives the translation \u2018Urform,\u2019 which seems\nto be a good reading, better than \u2018mother\u2019 or any other\nsuggestion. This translation is not rendered improbable by\nthe translation of mummu by b\u0113llu, \u2018lady,\u2019 as that might\nsimply be a kind of descriptive title, all female divinities,\nby their exalted position, being \u2018ladies,\u2019 just as all gods\n\n\\(^1\\) A duplicate of this gives some variants, and another fragment, also\nunpublished, completes, to a certain extent. K. 4832. The most important\nrestoration is l. 11 (= Mythen und Epen, p. 6, l. 32, and p. 8, l. 12), where\nI have copied\nmight be called *b\u0113lu*, 'lords.' One of the epithets of Ti\u0101matu, the *mummu*, or 'original shape,' is *\u1e2bupur* or *\u1e2bubur*, concerning which Jensen gives many suggestions. It expresses a 'cosmic idea,' it is the name of a river, and apparently the river of the underworld, which Tammuz, on his way thither, has to cross; and there is nothing to be brought against the conjecture that \u1e2aubur and the \u1e2aubur river are the *\u03a9\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2* which surrounds the earth. In the translation he translates *ummu \u1e2aubur* 'the mother of the north,'\u00b9 which is a rendering to all appearance capable of improvement. An interesting paragraph is that in which the author refers to the word *\u016bmu* in the meaning of 'day,' and the beings personifying the \"raging, gliding, onrushing day.\" In connection with this he seeks to show that the word *\u016bmu* has also the meaning of 'appearance,' a rendering which would probably please those who see in the first chapter of Genesis the six days of creation as so many visions. His suggestion that the name of the Babylonian Noah may be read *\u016am-napi\u0161tim* instead of *Pir-* or *Par-napi\u0161tim* would, if correct, restore my own reading of some years ago, though I took *\u016bm* to have its usual meaning, 'day of,' or something similar. It is noteworthy that, in this note, Professor Jensen speaks of Professor Delitzsch as having \"made front\" against him energetically on this question, but this is a thing he ought not to mind\u2014it is one of the proud privileges of German scholarship.\n\nExcellent as this book is, and anxious as the author has evidently been to express himself with caution and reserve, so as to disarm, wherever possible, the criticism which, in Assyriology more, perhaps, than in most other branches of study, prevails, it is doubtful whether he has altogether succeeded. One cannot but admire, however, the straightforward way in which he always expresses his doubts upon the renderings which he gives, though one could wish, in many cases, that, for the sake of clearness, he had done it in a different way. All scholars will look forward to the\n\n\u00b9 The italics are Professor Jensen's, and imply that the rendering is doubtful.\nsucceeding parts of the sixth volume of Schrader's *Keil-\ninschriftliche Bibliothek*, which is to contain \"religious texts\nof every kind,\" by the same author. Even though one may\nnot agree with him, there is generally something suggestive\nand noteworthy in what he has to say.\n\nT. G. PINCHES.\n\n*Katalog der Handschriften der Universit\u00e4ts-Bibliothek\nzu Leipzig. I: Die Sanskrit-Handschriften, von Theodor\nAufrecht.* (Leipzig, 1901.)\n\nThis volume of nearly 500 pages is the first of a series of\ncatalogues which is to appear within the next five years, and\nwhich, when complete, will contain a description of the whole\nof the ancient manuscripts in the Library of the University\nof Leipzig. That it is the work of the veteran Professor\nAufrecht, the greatest of all the makers of Sanskrit cata-\nlogues, is in itself a sufficient guarantee of its scholarly\ncharacter.\n\nThe Leipzig University Library, unlike some others,\nnotably the Berlin Library and the Library of the India\nOffice, had not the good fortune to become the repository\nof any of the celebrated great collections of Sanskrit manu-\nscripts made in the earlier days of Sanskrit studies. Its\nacquisitions seem to have been chiefly the result of purchases\nmade, for the most part, within the last twenty years; but\nthey fairly represent the whole range of Sanskrit literature,\nand constitute altogether a most serviceable collection. The\nfine series of astronomical and astrological works may,\nperhaps, be specially mentioned. A glance at Professor\nAufrecht's description of this portion of the collection will\nshow that several of these works, apart from their interest\nfrom the point of view of astronomy or mathematics, may be\nexpected to yield incidentally a rich harvest of historical and\ngeographical information when they are properly studied\nand indexed.\n\nE. J. RAPSON.\nThe previous volume of this series dealt with the Muhammadan architecture of the provincial towns of Gujarat, a considerable proportion of which dates from the fourteenth century A.D., when the country was ruled through governors appointed by the Sultans of Dehli. The present volume is confined to those Muhammadan buildings of the capital which were erected during that portion of the rule of the Ahmad Shahi Sultans of Gujarat, which extends from the foundation of Ahmadabad in 1412 to the year 1520. Such is the wealth of the Muhammadan architecture of Ahmadabad that another part will be needed for the description of those monuments which belong to the remainder of the sixteenth and to the early part of the seventeenth century.\n\nIn an architectural work of this kind, the letterpress is confessedly held subordinate to the illustrations; and, in the present volume, the 112 photographic and lithographic plates may, to a very great extent, be left to speak for themselves. The short historical introduction to the volume and the descriptions added to the plates are written with all Dr. Burgess's usual clearness, and supply everything that is needed to enable the student to appreciate a particularly interesting branch of Muhammadan architecture.\n\nAs Dr. Burgess points out, this school of Muhammadan architecture carries on, to a very great extent, the pre-existing Jaina architecture, the great formative idea of which consists in \"an octagonal dome resting on horizontal architraves supported by twelve pillars.\" The work, moreover, was executed by craftsmen who were really Hindu, and Muhammadan in little more than name. We have, therefore, the interesting phenomenon of an essentially Indian style of architecture modified and elaborated in accordance with Muhammadan ideas. The analogy suggested\nby Dr. Burgess with the early Christian adaptations of the temples of heathen divinities at Rome is precisely to the point. In either case we see the conversion of \"a pagan style of architecture to the purposes of a religion abominating idolatry.\"\n\nE. J. Rapson.\n\nNeun Mahaban-Inschriften \u2014 Entzifferung, \u00dcbersetzung, Erkl\u00e4rung. By Dr. Georg Huth. (Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen aus dem K\u00f6niglichen Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde.) (Berlin, 1901.)\n\nIn this monograph, Dr. Huth deals with one class of those inscriptions in unknown characters which are found in districts on the extreme north-western frontier of India. The inscriptions of this particular class are characterized by their use in common of an alphabet of which at least some thirty different characters are to be distinguished; and these characters recur in the various published inscriptions, and are to be recognized in new inscriptions as they are brought to light,\u00b9 in a manner which conveys a prima facie impression of genuineness. So much can scarcely be said about some of the other inscriptions, or supposed inscriptions, from the same part of the world, which have been published.\n\nAnd just as there is no reason to doubt the genuineness of the inscriptions now published by Dr. Huth, so it is extremely probable, as has been generally suggested, that their language is some ancient dialect of T\u00fcrki. It is on this assumption that Dr. Huth's decipherment is founded.\n\nManifestly, no complete examination of Dr. Huth's position is possible without some acquaintance with T\u00fcrki. All that can be attempted in the present notice is a bare statement of the facts of the case, and some estimate of the probability or possibility of any certain decipherment in similar circumstances. The finding of a bilingual inscription in these unknown characters and in one of the known Indian alphabets, for instance, would, of course, settle the question\n\n\u00b9 E.g. the inscription published in this Journal, 1898, p. 619.\ndefinitely; but, failing this, we may well consider how far the admitted facts of the case would justify us in maintaining an attitude of skepticism towards any suggested decipherment, however plausible.\n\nNow, the whole amount of the material used by Dr. Huth consists of nine very short inscriptions, of an average length of not quite five lines each, containing in all, as transliterated and transcribed by him, 470 alphabetic characters or 235 words. It must be confessed that this amount of material would have been perilously small, as far as any certain decipherment is concerned, even if the decipherer had started with some certain clue\u2014even if, for example, he had known with certainty the values of ten of the alphabetic characters. But he had no clue of the kind. He can only have proceeded experimentally, assuming certain values for certain signs, until, by a process of selection, he obtained results which gave a more or less satisfactory meaning, on the hypothesis that the language of the inscriptions was some dialect of T\u00fcrki. In the absence of a clue of any kind, this procedure is, of course, the only one possible; and there is no reason why a satisfactory result should not be obtained by it. The question is whether it is, on the whole, probable or not that such a result has been obtained in the present instance.\n\nThis question may no doubt, to a great extent, be solved by the discovery of other inscriptions of this class in the future, or finally settled by the discovery of some bilingual\n\n---\n\n1 How exceedingly difficult the task of decipherment would have been even with the aid of a clue of this kind may be seen at once by putting any English sentence continuously, without division of words, into a cipher composed partly of letters having their proper value and partly of signs representing the other letters used. In the following cipher, for instance, which represents a sentence in the present notice, ten letters appear with their proper value, while the other ten letters which occur are represented by dissimilar inverted letters:\n\nCBUTOTIMUITXIBTTOVTAVTADATAPTAUCA BCVUINITABCBOOTKTUTAVTALALAUCAVTAVOBFT OVVAEICEITOBTACVEAIDBTUBUGPLAUDOGOTOWABTIA VADTAOFATUOVTUVIATIVAI\ninscription. In the meantime, we are left to form for ourselves some opinion as to the probability of the correctness of Dr. Huth's decipherment by an examination of his methods.\n\nThe language of the Mahaban inscriptions is, according to Dr. Huth, written in an alphabet which, like many other Eastern alphabets, expresses only the framework of words and leaves to the reader the task of filling in the 'moving' vowels. It is the enormous extent to which this filling in is left to the imagination or to the knowledge of the reader\u2014surely quite unprecedented even among Eastern alphabets\u2014that would seem to suggest a doubt as to the possibility of the correctness of Dr. Huth's system. To take an instance at random. In Inscription Pa. iv, lines 3 and 4, we find in the transcription the letters\u2014$s_2 s_2 l_2 d \\overset{\\circ}{s} k_1 s_2$. These are vocalized and made into words by Dr. Huth as follows:\u2014as \u0101sil idi \u012b\u0161 ki\u0161i. This, it must be remembered, is not a specially selected example, but is fairly typical of all the nine inscriptions. It is difficult to believe that an alphabetic system which left so much to be supplied by the reader can ever have obtained even in the East. It has often been said of certain other Eastern alphabets that, like language, they would seem to have been invented by man for the concealment of his thoughts; but surely none of the others can have effected this purpose so completely as the alphabet of the Mahaban inscriptions.\n\nThe interpretation of the language would, moreover, seem to have required just as much use of the imagination as the transcription of the alphabet. The passage just quoted is translated word for word by Dr. Huth, Geist Herkunft Herr Handeln Mensch, and the whole is interpreted, (der) an Geist (und) Abstammung ein Aristokrat, in Handeln (ein einfacher) Mensch (war)! which, it must be allowed, is a good deal to get out of $s_2 s_2 l_2 d \\overset{\\circ}{s} k_1 s_2$.\n\nThe difficulties in the way of accepting Dr. Huth's decipherment of the Mahaban inscriptions are, therefore, not slight; but he will have our thanks and our admiration for the great patience and ingenuity which he has brought to bear on a most difficult problem. He has, at least, furnished\nus with a working hypothesis which must serve until a better in forthcoming; but, with all respect to Dr. Huth, many scholars will doubt whether the time is yet quite ripe to speak of the \"grosse historische Bedeutung\" of these inscriptions.\n\nE. J. RAFTON.\n\nPRELIMINARY REPORT ON A JOURNEY OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN.\n\nBy M. A. STEIN, Indian Educational Service. (Published under the Authority of H.M.'s Secretary of State for India in Council: London, 1901.)\n\nRecent numbers of our Journal have contained contributions by Dr. Stein himself giving an account of the main results of his explorations in the neighbourhood of Khotan while they were actually in progress. Since the appearance of these articles, Dr. Stein has brought to London the whole collection of antiquities which he made in this region and entrusted it to the safe keeping of the British Museum to await the opportunity\u2014may it not be long delayed?\u2014of such an extended leave of absence from his official duties in India as will enable him to return and superintend the production of a full detailed report. In the meantime he has issued the present \"Preliminary Report\" describing the various sites excavated and the nature of the various classes of objects discovered, without making any attempt to produce a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 or entering into any minute discussion of questions of art or epigraphy. Such a catalogue and such discussions will find a place in the final report, which will include, moreover, the important results of the topographical and ethnographical investigations which Dr. Stein combined with his archaeological work.\n\nThe \"Preliminary Report,\" however, is amply sufficient to enable us to form an estimate of the importance and the extent of Dr. Stein's discoveries. It has for years past been recognized that the ancient civilization which flourished\nwhere now the Taklamakan Desert presents but a vast expanse of shifting sand-dunes, was to some extent Indian in character. The bilingual coins from this part of the world, with their inscriptions in ancient Chinese and in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b of the Indo-Scythic period, bore positive testimony to this fact, and their testimony has in recent years been supported by the discovery of other antiquities, above all by the discovery of a birch-bark manuscript of the Dhammapada in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b characters. But these documents have, for the most part, been obtained casually by European travellers, or procured through the agency of native 'treasure-seekers' by Russian and British political officers. It has remained for Dr. Stein to organize and carry out a systematic scientific exploration of the most important ancient sites in this now desolate region. This exploration has proved marvellously fertile in results. It has brought to light ancient objects of art\u2014statues, frescos, pictures, terra-cottas, and seals\u2014which present the most interesting problems. There can be no doubt that some of the seals are purely classical, while others show the influence which native ideas exercised in modifying the Western art thus strangely planted in far-distant Central Asia. Some of the statues and sculptures, again, like those of Gandhara, undoubtedly show, in varying degree, the influence of Graeco-Roman art. Both of these classes present a most interesting parallel with the coins of the Graeco-Indian kings who held the Kabul Valley and the Northern Panjab from c. 200 B.C. to c. 25 B.C. In all three classes alike may be traced a gradual degradation from the Graeco-Roman standard, ending at last in Oriental monotony and conventionality. These remarks may be illustrated by a comparison of the following seals represented in Dr. Stein's plates\u2014(1) N. xv, 330, a seated Eros (pl. ix); (2) N. xv, 137 (pl. viii), and N. xv, 166 (pl. x), Athene Promachos; (3) N. xv, 167 (pl. ix), a portrait in juxtaposition with a Chinese inscription; (4) N. xv, 71 (pl. ix), a portrait.\n\nThese seals, if one may judge from the analogy which the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b writing of the wooden tablets to which they\nare affixed presents with that of the Indo-Scythic coins, belong, in all probability, to the first and second centuries A.D. Of a later date (perhaps c. 500\u2013800 A.D.) are the painted tablets (pl. ii) and the frescos (pl. iv), which show a predominant Chinese or Tibetan influence.\n\nThe most important of Dr. Stein's discoveries are, however, the inscribed documents, and, in particular, the parchments and wooden tablets bearing Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscriptions. The fragments of MSS. in Br\u0101hm\u012b, Chinese, and Tibetan characters, in all probability represent, for the most part, portions of the Buddhist canon. The Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b parchments and wooden tablets, on the other hand, present us with something novel, alike as regards alphabet, language, and contents; and, as there are over 400 of these, it is evident that from this source we may expect very considerable additions to our knowledge of the history of this part of Central Asia in the first centuries of the Christian era. The alphabet is cursive, and therefore differs from the formal Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscriptions on the coins of the Indo-Scythic kings. It has more compound consonants than the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b of the Dutreuil de Rhins MS. of the Dhammapada, and some of these compound consonants, especially when they occur only in non-Indian titles or non-Indian names, will prove extremely difficult to determine. The language would seem to be not far removed from Sanskrit\u2014e.g., the genitive singular in -asya and the 3rd singular future in -i\u1e63yati are found, and not the corresponding Prakrit forms; but it has many peculiarities, due, no doubt, to the locality. Nothing certain can yet be said as to the nature of the contents of these documents; but by far the greater number are undoubtedly royal commands, and it is extremely probable that they are safe-conducts ensuring the bearer protection and assistance throughout the king's dominions. It is probable that the seals affixed to them were added as tangible evidence of their authority. They are regularly dated in regnal years, with the addition of month and day. The names of more than one king occur, and these names seem to be non-Aryan in character, and the documents are\naddressed to more than one personage. It is not possible to say, until the whole number have been most carefully studied, how much historical information these Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b parchments and wooden tablets may be expected to yield; but, from the point of view of language and epigraphy, their importance is unquestionably very great.\n\nDr. Stein started on his expedition on May 29th, 1900 (p. 6), and exactly a year later, on May 29th, 1901 (p. 69), he left Kashgar with his archaeological finds en route for London. It seems almost incredible that this prolonged expedition, necessitating the employment of numbers of carriers and excavators, and all the accessories required for residence in the desert far away from any base of supplies, should have been carried out at a cost to the Government of India of only some \u00a3700; but such appears to be the case. Surely a similar amount has never been bestowed to better purpose on archaeological work of any kind or in any country. The Indian Government is to be thanked for the enterprise which has produced such notable results, and, at the same time, to be congratulated on having at its disposal the services of a scholar of Dr. Stein\u2019s attainments, capability, and tact.\n\nE. J. Rapson.\n\nArchaeological Survey of India: A Report on a Tour of Exploration of the Antiquities in the Tarai, Nepal, the region of Kapilavastu, etc. By Babu Purna Chandra Mukherji, with a Prefatory Note by Mr. Vincent A. Smith, B.A., M.R.A.S., etc. No. xxvi, Part I, of the Imperial Series. (Calcutta, 1901.)\n\nThis detailed description of the antiquities in the immediate neighbourhood of Buddha\u2019s birthplace is most welcome. The district seems to have been explored under the sanction and with the aid of the Indian Government and the Nepalese Government by Mr. Mukherji and Major Waddell independently, and the Report of the latter will, presumably, appear separately as Part 2 of vol. xxvi of the Archaeological\nSurvey of India (Imperial Series). Whether it is wise to divide forces in this way, is a question which could only be answered by one who was in possession of all the facts of the case.\n\nThe identification, which is absolutely beyond doubt, of Rummin-dei with the Lumbini-vana, the actual birthplace of Buddha according to all the Buddhist scriptures, affords a fixed point in early Indian archaeology, which may, perhaps, be best compared with the fixed point which was gained for Indian chronology when Sir William Jones identified the Sandrocotus of Megasthenes with the Maurya king Candra-gupta; and we may confidently expect that, starting from it, similar progress will be made in the determination of much that is at present indistinct and nebulous.\n\nApart from the identification of the Lumbini-vana with Rummin-dei, there can scarcely yet be said to be any consensus among archaeologists as to the identification of the sites and monuments of early Buddhism as known to us from the Pali books and from the accounts of the Chinese pilgrims. In the present volume, for instance, the site of Kapila-vastu, the capital of the \u015a\u0101kya dynasty to which Buddha belonged, is discussed by Mr. Mukherji and by his editor, Mr. Vincent Smith, with rather different results. Mr. Mukherji comes to the conclusion (p. 50) that it is to be identified with Tilaur\u0101-kot. Mr. Vincent Smith, on the other hand (Prefatory Note, p. 10), sees reasons for supposing that in their descriptions of Kapila-vastu the two Chinese pilgrims, Fa-hien and Hiuen Tsiang, are referring to two entirely distinct places\u2014the former to Pipr\u0101v\u0101, the latter to Tilaur\u0101-kot. Mr. Vincent Smith has arrived at this conclusion, which seems at first sight somewhat startling, as the only possible means of reconciling the accounts which the two pilgrims give of Kapilavastu and its position relative to \u015ar\u0101vasti and other places. To quote his own words, \"The moment that this explanation flashed on my mind, all difficulties in the interpretation of the documents vanished. Each locality described dropped into its proper\nposition in the itinerary of each pilgrim, and each itinerary fitted into the other. Hiuen Tsiang now supports Fa-hien, and Fa-hien supports Hiuen Tsiang.\"\n\nOn consideration, this theory is not so improbable as it may appear at first glance. As Mr. Mukherji points out (p. 15), Kapilavastu had decayed before the date of these pilgrimages. Of it Fa-hien, c. 400 A.D., says, \"there is neither king nor people: it is like a great desert. There is simply a congregation of priests and about ten families of lay people\"; and Hiuen Tsiang, about 230 years later, describes the district as having \"some ten desert cities, wholly desolate and ruined.\" It is by no means improbable that, amidst this desolation, traditions may have been lost or confused. It would be interesting to ascertain whether similar confusions in the identification of places connected with the life of Christ are to be found in the Holy Land.\n\nMr. Mukherji has brought together a mass of information dealing with the ancient monuments of this most interesting district, the home of Buddhism, which will prove of great importance to future workers in this field. The whole scheme of his operations and his instructions as to methods of procedure were drawn up at the request of the Government of India by Mr. Vincent A. Smith. It is a matter of the deepest regret that Mr. Smith's retirement deprives India of one who, by his great knowledge of the monuments, his faculty of weighing evidence, and his sober judgment, was eminently qualified to serve the cause of Indian archaeology.\n\nE. J. Rapson.\n\nIndiens Kultur in der Bl\u00fcthezeit des Buddhismus.\nK\u00f6nig Asoka: von Edmund Hardy. (Mainz: Kirchheim, 1902.)\n\nThis beautifully illustrated and extraordinarily cheap volume\u2014it costs only four shillings\u2014is one of a series on \"The World's History in Character-pictures.\" The publisher of the series has been fortunate to obtain the\nservices of so able a writer and so careful a scholar as Professor Hardy for this particular volume. It is true that the popular nature of the whole series has precluded the author from the discussion of those doubtful points in the biography of the great Buddhist sovereign which would have given the best scope for his special knowledge. But the hand of the scholar is traceable throughout.\n\nWe have first an account of Alexander's invasion of India. It is incidentally noticed that copper coins struck then and there by Alexander, in just the square form of the Indian currency of the time, are still extant. A figure of one of these coins now in the Old Museum in Berlin is given in illustration. The author is of opinion that it was the invasion of Alexander that gave rise in India to the idea of a Cakravarti, of a sovereign of the world. In my little manual (p. 220) I have said, speaking of Candragupta, not of Alexander: \"Is it surprising that this unity of power in one man made a deep impression upon them? Is it surprising that, like the Romans worshipping Augustus or like Greeks adding the glow of the sun-myth to the glory of Alexander, the Indians should have formed an ideal of their Cakravarti, and transferred to this new ideal many of the dimly sacred and half understood traits of the Vedic heroes? Is it surprising that the Buddhists should have recognized in their hero the Cakravarti of righteousness, and that the story of the Buddha should have become tinged with the colouring of these Cakravarti myths?\"\n\nThis does not say in so many words that the idea was not older than Candragupta. But that was probably in my mind; and I take the present opportunity of saying that, for the reasons given in this book, it was almost certainly Alexander, and not Candragupta, whose power and career first gave strength to this old conception of the king of the golden age, so powerful ever afterwards in the minds of the peoples of India.\n\nThere then follows an account of Asoka's life as crown prince: and incidentally we have the very interesting question discussed whether the two bas-reliefs on the eastern\nTorana at Sanchi do not represent the state processions at the time of the taking of the Bo Tree from Budh Gay\u0101 to Ceylon. Dr. Gr\u00fcnwedel was the first to suggest this. Dr. Burgess (pp. 70\u201372 of the English edition) has adopted his view. Professor Hardy (pp. 10, 11) evidently thinks it is probably right, and makes the further suggestion that the two figures above the peacock (may\u016bra, mora) may be meant for Asoka and his wife. It is well known that Asoka's clan-name, Maurya, is derived from the peacock. The question is a difficult one to discuss without plates; and Professor Hardy's are much larger, clearer, and better than any we have yet had.\n\nThe description of Asoka's activity after he ascended the throne is based on the inscriptions, but illustrations of a most suggestive kind are throughout adduced both from the literature and from the monuments. And attention is directed (p. 24) to the point, sometimes overlooked, that royal edicts are not always entirely to be trusted, even when their meaning is not open to doubt. We are glad to see that the author understands the sambodhi exactly in the sense in which it is taken in the \"Dialogues of the Buddha,\" I. 190\u2013192. And the observations at pp. 29\u201331 are both new and true. It has been sometimes supposed that it was Asoka who gave importance to Buddhism. On the contrary, says Professor Hardy, Asoka, always intent on practical political results, probably chose Buddhism, not so much on account of its peculiar doctrines, as because it was already the creed of the majority, and therefore politically more important than other creeds. This is an exact analogy (he might have added) to the relation of Constantine to Christianity.\n\nThe book is full of suggestive points of this kind, and we trust that the author will find opportunity to publish more in full his views on several subjects, especially, for instance, on the chronology of the edicts and on the interpretation of the Bhabra Edict, on both of which he differs from M. Senart.\n\nR.H. D.\nBuddhist Art in India. Translated from the \"Handbuch\" of Albert Gr\u00fcnwedel by Agnes L. Gibson. Revised and enlarged by Jas. Burgess. (London: Quaritch, 1901.)\n\nThe original handbook on which this work is based was noticed at some length in this Journal when it appeared in 1893, and the hope was expressed that, as it was the best book on the subject, it would be translated into English. The best possible fulfilment of this wish lies before us in the present handsome volume, brought out under the supervision of the veteran archaeologist to whom students of the history of Indian art are already so much indebted.\n\nThe letterpress in the English work is about twice as long as that in the original German, and the number of illustrations is 154 as against 73. This is partly due to additions made in the second edition of the German, and partly to additions made by the English editor. It would not be possible, without a detailed examination of all three editions, to apportion the various parts of the present volume to their respective authors, and no one will think such an examination worth while. Dr. Burgess, with his usual modesty, has only affixed his initials here and there to a note. But his work has not been at all confined to the notes so distinguished, and he has added many of the illustrations. What we have, then, is all that is contained in the German edition, elucidated and added to by the most competent authority in England. The result is a volume quite indispensable to anyone, whether in Europe or in India who is occupying himself with the real meaning and history of Indian art; and it would scarcely be possible to exaggerate highly the debt they owe to both author and editor.\n\nA somewhat cursory review of the work has already been given, and we may now go on to make a few suggestions for the new edition which will certainly be wanted, and will, we hope, be well received. As we have observed, most of these\nsuggestions have little or nothing to do with art, and are therefore matters which probably have not been considered.\n\nThroughout the book the word Nirvana is wrongly used. The Buddha attained to Nirvana when seated under the Tree of Wisdom. For forty-five years afterwards he wandered, very much alive, over the plains of Hindustan. This is the use of the word, without any exception, in India. For the Jain usage see, for instance, Jacobi, \"Jaina S\u016btras,\" i, p. 201. I am aware that, in popular English usage, Nirvana is supposed to be the name of a sort of heaven into which the Buddha is believed to have entered after death. But this idea, though in harmony with most European notions as to salvation, is antagonistic to Indian views. Nirvana meant, at the date in question, precisely what \u0101van-mukti meant, centuries afterwards, to the followers of \u015aa\u1e45kara.\n\nAt pp. 74, 208 it is said that Sanskrit was chosen at J\u0101landhara for the language of the sacred texts. This is a mistake. It was chosen as the language in which were written three specified commentaries (one on each of the three Pitakas of the sacred texts). These commentaries themselves are not sacred texts. A similar mistake is made on p. 13, where the Avid\u016bre Nid\u0101na is called a canonical text. It is only one of the commentaries on a canonical text.\n\nOn p. 10 it is said that the system of caste was fully established in the time of the Buddha. That used to be the opinion of scholars, but I think I have conclusively shown (\"Dialogues of the Buddha,\" 1. 97\u2013102) that this cannot possibly have been the case.\n\nOn p. 11 there is a curious contradiction. It is there said at the top of the page that religion in the fifth century B.C. was \"entirely in the hands of the brahmins.\" Just below it is said, on the contrary, that the forms of worship of the common people \"were quite left to themselves.\" The latter view is, no doubt, the correct one.\n\nOn p. 15, line 7, we are told that the Buddha \"journeyed about in Behar.\" For \"in Behar\" read \"in Hindustan.\" Just below there is the expression \"the Master gone into\nNirvana,\" on which see above. (So also p. 68, \"disappeared into Nirvana.\") And again, in the fifth line from the bottom the word *them* is puzzlingly ambiguous.\n\nIn the division of the monuments on p. 20 the third class is called Chaitya. The meaning adopted, following Fergusson and Cunningham, is that of a temple containing a st\u016bpa or d\u0101gaba. This is never the meaning of the word in Indian books. It always means a sacred place, usually in a grove or on a hill-top, pertaining to the non-brahminical and non-Buddhist local cults. The word is much wanted in this sense, for which we have no other expression. The caves to which Fergusson wrongly applied this name were chapter-houses for the Order, halls where the Patimokkha was recited and the Kammav\u0101c\u0101s, the formal corporate acts of the Order, were carried out. A Vih\u0101ra, on the other hand, always means in the canonical books an apartment, a cell. A cave containing several such cells may rightly therefore be called a Vih\u0101ra cave. The secondary use of the word in the sense of monastery has not yet been found earlier than the fifth century A.D.\n\nAt the end of the interesting discussion on Vajrap\u0101\u1e47i, the name given by the author to the figure with the thunderbolt in his hand (so often represented, on the bas-reliefs of the Gandh\u0101ra school, in attendance on the Buddha), it is said (p. 95) that Vajrap\u0101\u1e47i at first meant Sakka, then got separated from him and was converted into a distinct god, and lastly that Sakka \"sinks into a yaksha.\" Now in one of our very oldest texts, the Amba\u1e6d\u1e6dha Suttanta (translated in my \"Dialogues of the Buddha,\" p. 117), Vajrap\u0101\u1e47i is used as an adjective to describe a yaksha in attendance on the Buddha. It would seem, therefore, that the process has been exactly the reverse. First we have the yaksha with a descriptive adjective (not yet a name), *vajirap\u0101\u1e47i*, that is, 'having a thunderbolt in his hand.' This may be as old as the fourth century B.C. Nine hundred years later we find Buddhaghosa, in his commentary (quoted by me loc. cit.), identifying this yaksha with Indra. There is no evidence that this identification had been already made at the time\nof the bas-reliefs. All one can say is that it may have been so. And in any case the yaksha does not end, he begins the series. When we find him twice on the same bas-relief there is no necessity to suppose that we have two different conceptions. The two figures may be meant for the same yaksha at different points in the story to be illustrated, as is so often the case elsewhere.\n\nThroughout the book the fullest and most careful references are given to previous European writers on the art of the bas-reliefs. The references to the books containing the stories or legends which the bas-reliefs are intended to illustrate might be greatly improved. It is odd that there is not a single reference (so far as I have been able to discover) in this book on Buddhist art to any one of the Buddhist canonical texts. The reference given in the last paragraph would have been very much to the point, and have probably led to a modification of the text. At pp. 46, 62, 93, 95, 122 references are given to texts long posterior in date to the works of art in question. It would be easy to replace these by references to works of approximately the same age.\n\nThe bas-relief reproduced in fig. 57 can scarcely refer to a N\u0101ga asking to be admitted to the Order. There is no such case in the books. A comparison of the canonical passage on the point (translated in \"Vinaya Texts,\" l. 218) would have shown that a N\u0101ga wishing to join the Order could only do so by assuming human form. In the bas-relief the N\u0101ga appears quite distinctly as a N\u0101ga, and must therefore merely be asking for instruction or for some favour.\n\nAt p. 158, for rartagati read vartayati; and on p. 78 Milinda is three times spelt with a cerebral l, which is perhaps possible, but is against the authority of the MSS.\n\nRH.

Specht applies the term Indo-Ephthalite to that class of the coins attributed by Cunningham to the White Huns which is characterized by its thin 'Sassanian' fabric, and by the presence of inscriptions in an alphabet which has not hitherto been deciphered. This term has the advantage of indicating, at the same time, the country from which the coins come\u2014Sind, the valley of the Lower Indus\u2014and the nationality of the monarchs who struck them\u2014Ephthalite, Hunya or White Hun. The attribution of these coins to the Hunyas would seem to be proved by the very close resemblance which they bear to certain coins having the names of the Hunya monarchs, Jabubla (Toramana) and Mihirakula, in Sanskrit characters. Until, therefore, anything can be proved to the contrary, the designation 'Indo-Ephthalite' would seem to be admirably suited to describe this class, which, in point of date, would fall within the period from the fifth to the seventh century A.D.\n\nIn attempting the decipherment of these inscriptions in unknown characters, which he supposes to be of Aramaean origin, M. Specht has been guided by the analogy of other alphabets derived from the same source, and has sought, in the first instance, to determine certain words which might naturally be expected to occur on the coins, e.g. the word malka, which he recognizes with the variant forms malkin and malkon, and the proper names of the kings Chach and Satis, who are known from Arab historians to have ruled in Sind during this period. With the results thus obtained, M. Specht proceeds to the decipherment of the remaining portions of the inscriptions. There is much that he confesses must at present remain doubtful, and he appears to be probably diligent as to a considerable proportion of the readings and interpretations proposed by him. There must naturally remain a great deal of uncertainty as to the\ncorrectness of his system of decipherment; but it must be acknowledged that the results obtained seem, in many cases, to be extremely probable. The discovery of further specimens and the more minute study of this class of coins may be expected to throw further light on the whole subject. In the meantime, M. Specht has suggested an ingenious solution of a very difficult puzzle.\n\nE. J. Rapson.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(October, November, December, 1901.)\n\nI.

Obituary Notices.\n\nProfessor Albrecht Weber.\n\nOn November 30th, at Berlin, died Albrecht Weber, one of the greatest Orientalists of our time. If less known to the public than men like Max M\u00fcller or Renan, amongst his fellow-workers in Indian research Weber occupied a position quite unique. As a writer no man has explored so many new fields; as a teacher none can boast so goodly an array of pupils.\n\nBorn at Breslau in 1825, studying at Bonn and Berlin, Weber settled (after some scholarly travel in England and France) in 1848 in Berlin, where he was appointed Professor in 1856, and taught for the remainder of his life. His first great work was the edition of the \"White Yajur-veda,\" of which vol. i appeared in 1849 (the same year that saw the first volume of Max M\u00fcller's \"Rigveda\"). About the same time Weber undertook the cataloguing of the Sanskrit MSS. in the Royal Library at Berlin. The first volume appeared in 1853. This was the earliest full and scientific catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. published, and it has remained a model. Its special feature was the full description of the subordinate works of Vedic literature, till then known in Europe mostly by hearsay. Not content, however (like some cataloguers), to leave his best results to be gleaned by others, Weber followed this up by numerous essays on all branches of Indian research on subjects as widely separated as Vedic astronomy and the relatively modern cult of the god Krishna. These were published partly by the Berlin Academy of Sciences (to which he was elected in 1857), but chiefly in his own periodical for the study of Indian antiquity, Indische Studien, of which seventeen volumes (1850\u201385) appeared, in great part written by himself.\n\nBesides his work on Sanskrit, Weber was also the first real pioneer in the scientific study (still neglected) of Prakrit, the middle stratum of Indian speech, from which\nthe vernaculars of Northern India have sprung. In several forms of this speech Weber edited texts, especially in that adopted by the Jain religion, of which Europe owes to him its first trustworthy information. His interest in this probably led him to compile the second volume of his great library catalogue, in 1,202 quarto pages, of which the last 787 are devoted to Jain literature. The results of the latter portion were worked out in *Indische Studien*, and have thence been translated with the author's revision into English. The results of some of his university teaching were embodied in his lectures on Indian literature, which, on the ground of their wide grasp of facts (for Weber had no graces of style), remained the standard work on the subject throughout Europe for half a century.\n\nAngelo de Gubernatis, one of the most versatile of his pupils, calls him \"le grand ma\u00eetre des indianistes contemporains,\" and, indeed, it is probable that not only half the numerous chairs of Sanskrit in Germany (where the subject is far more widely endowed than here) are occupied by his pupils, or their pupils, but also a goodly number in Holland, Switzerland, Italy, and America. Weber's personality was most genial, and his venerable figure will be missed from the numerous congresses of scholars that he attended as long as he was able. In later years his sight failed. He says pathetically in the Vorwort to his last great catalogue (1891): \"Es ist ein m\u00fchsames Werk das ich hiermit abschliesse. Ein gut St\u00fcck meiner Sehkraft liegt darin begraben.\" But in spite of failing powers he died in harness, returning in his numerous recent publications mainly to his earliest subject, the Veda, and corresponding in his own hand with his many friends, in their own language, both in Germany and in this country.\n\nC. Bendall.\n\n[From the *Athen\u00e6um*.]\nIII. Notes and News.\n\nLady Hunter has presented the Library with the Life of Sir W. W. Hunter, by Mr. F. E. Skrine, late of the Indian Civil Service. This interesting biography, as well as Mr. J. F. Hewitt's new book on the History and Chronology of the Myth-making Age, will be reviewed in the next Journal.\n\nT\u0113r.\n\nIn the previous volume of the Journal (pp. 537-552), Dr. J. F. Fleet, C.I.E., has given an interesting discussion on the identification of the ancient Tagara of the \u015ail\u0101h\u0101ra dynasty with the modern T\u0113r, a town in the Naldurg district of the Nizam's dominions: lat. 18\u00b0 19' N., long. 76\u00b0 12' E. In the early part of November, Mr. H. Cousens paid a short visit to T\u0113r, which proved very successful, and he has supplied me with the following facts, which are of interest:\n\n(1) He obtained a loan of a copy of a Mah\u0101tmyam, styled the Mah\u0101tmyam of Satyapura, which contains no mention, however, of Tagara or T\u0113r, but states that the village or town was called Satyapura in the first age, \u015aantapura in the second, Kank\u0101vati in the third, and Siddh\u0101\u015brama in the fourth age. This hardly helps us, and one is inclined to suspect that this Mah\u0101tmyam may possibly have come from some other place in possession of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 who had removed to T\u0113r.\n\n(2) In the village is an inscribed land grant on a stone slab, dated \u015aaka 1076, but so much abraded that possibly little can be made out from it. Mr. Cousens has, however, taken paper impressions, a photograph, and a plaster cast from it, and they will be submitted to Dr. Fleet. He got also copies of a set of Persian copperplates, about 250 years old, in which the Q\u0101zi of T\u0113r (\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a) confers certain privileges on the head of the T\u0113li caste. He obtained also five old coins\u2014three Muhammadan, one unintelligible, and a much corroded Andhra coin with four small circles connected by cross lines on one side, and probably an elephant on the\nother. He had obtained two similar coins some years ago at Banavasi, on one of which is [Sa]takan[i].\n\n(3) But more interesting still, he has found a venerable ancient Buddhist Chaitya, built of brick, and\u2014though used as a modern Vaishnava temple dedicated to Trivikrama, and has a later mandapa attached\u2014it is not seriously injured. In form it is just the structural counterpart of the rock-cut Chaityas, and recalls the outlines of the Sahadeva and Ganesha Rathas at Mamallapuram, having a barrel- or waggon-vaulted roof running up to a ridge, with an apsidal back. The fa\u00e7ade is a rough counterpart of the Buddha Chaitya cave known as Visvakarma at Elura\u2014worked in relief in brickwork. This fa\u00e7ade is about 33 feet in height, and the chaitya is 31 feet in length outside. It stands in the town of Ter, in fairly good preservation, its base mouldings being now some 4 feet below the level of the present narrow court. The bricks measure 17 inches in length by 9 broad and 3 thick, are well made, and carefully laid with very fine joints.\n\nThis is the second Buddhist structural Chaitya that has been found: the first was discovered by Mr. Alex. Rea, of the Madras Archaeological Survey, some years ago at Chezarla in the Kistna district, and is of about the same size as this at Ter. When complete drawings and photographs of these two remarkable structures can be compared, we may obtain some new light on Buddha architecture. There are also said to be some Pali inscriptions at Chezarla.\n\nMr. Cousens adds that, in a modern Jaina temple outside and to the west of Ter, are four Buddhist sculptures, two of which probably belonged to the dagaba that once occupied the apse in the Chaitya, and a third is a portion of a Buddhist paduka slab that bore a pair of colossal footprints with a beautiful border of lotuses, makaras, and birds, in low relief. These are carved apparently on Shahabad limestone, which closely resembles the Amaravati stone or marble.\n\n(4) Two very old brick temples were also found, similar in style, and apparently in age, to some early Dravidian temples at Kukkanur. All the decorative work is produced\nin finely moulded and carved brick. With the beams and ceilings, the doorways are all in wood and very richly sculptured. No stone is used in their structure.\n\nOutside T\u0113r, on the south and west, are great mounds from which, to the present day, the villagers dig out old bricks. The city must also once have extended to the opposite side of the river, where huge mounds of d\u00e9bris and a small hamlet indicate its extent.\n\n(5) The *tagara* shrub, from which Tagarapura possibly took its name, the people declared did not grow nearer than Dh\u0101r\u0101\u015biva, and but little there. This, however, is not conclusive: we may not know the local name for *tagara*; in North India Roxburgh tells us the *Valeriana Hardwickii* is known as *tagar*; in Tamil the *Cassia tora* is called *tagarai* and *ushit-tagarai*; and the Telugu name for *Heterophragma chelonoides*, according to Ainslie, is *tagada*\u2014the Mar\u0101thi *p\u0101dal*. The same name is, not unfrequently, applied to different plants in different provinces.\n\n*Edinburgh, Dec. 2, 1901.*\n\n*Jas. Burgess.*\n\n**Indian Documents on Parchment.**\n\nDr. Stein, in his most interesting \"Preliminary Report on Archaeological Exploration in Chinese Turkestan\" (p. 47), notes with surprise that the rubbish heap near the Niya River \"yielded another writing material, little suspected among a Buddhist population with an Indian civilization. About two dozen Kharosh\u1e6dh\u012b documents on leather, mostly dated and apparently of official nature, prove that the Buddhists of this region had as little objection to the use of leather for writing purposes as the pious Brahmans of old Kashmir had to the leather bindings of their Sanskrit codices. Plate xi shows one of these documents on leather, both in its original folded state and when opened after centuries of burial.\"\n\nThese leather documents discovered by Dr. Stein will probably prove to date from the second century A.D. Strabo has preserved a notice of an Indian official letter on\nparchment sent to Augustus, who died in A.D. 14. \"To these accounts,\" he writes, \"may be added that of Nikolaos Damask\u0113nos. This writer says that at Antioch by Daphn\u0113 he met with the Indian ambassadors who had been sent to Augustus Caesar. It appeared from their letter that their number had been more than merely the three he reports that he saw. The rest had died chiefly in consequence of the length of the journey. The letter was written in Greek on parchment and imported that P\u00f4ros was the writer, and that though he was the sovereign of 600 kings, he nevertheless set a high value on being C\u00e6sar's friend, and was willing to grant him a passage wherever he wished through his dominions, and to assist him in any good enterprise. Such, he says, were the contents of the letter. Eight naked servants presented the gifts that were brought.\"\u00b9\n\nVINCENT A. SMITH.\n\nIV.

In the time of the Salj\u016bk princes, by some misnomer, this, their capital province, came to be called \u2018Ir\u0101k \u2018Ajami, or Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k, a name that was totally unknown to the earlier Arab geographers. Hence in after days Al-\u2018Ir\u0101kayn, \u2018The Two \u2018Ir\u0101ks,\u2019 were taken to mean Media and Lower Mesopotamia, which last for distinction was thenceforth called Arabian \u2018Ir\u0101k\u2014\u2018Ir\u0101k \u2018Arab\u012b. Originally, it is to be observed, Al-\u2018Ir\u0101kayn had been a term applied to the two great cities of (Arabian) \u2018Ir\u0101k, namely, K\u016bfah and Ba\u1e63rah; but the Salj\u016bks had affected the title of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n of the Two \u2018Ir\u0101ks, which in consequence, as explained above, came to be applied to the two provinces, but as Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 408) writes \u201camong the vulgar,\u201d and wrongfully (see also Y\u0101k\u016bt, ii, 15, and Lane, Dictionary, s.v. \u2018Ir\u0101k). The name, however, has continued in use down to the present time.\n\nFurther, it is to be remarked that after the Mongol settlement Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k was greater in extent to the eastward than the older Arab province of Jib\u0101l, by the addition thereto of Yazd and its district, which formerly had been counted as of F\u0101rs; on the other hand, it had been diminished in size by the creation of the new province of Kurdist\u0101n, which had been taken from its western part, and Kurdist\u0101n now divided Persian from Arabian \u2018Ir\u0101k. Under the Ilkh\u0101ns Persian\nIr\u0101k became the capital province of their empire, for it included the four great cities of Isfah\u0101n, Ray, Hamad\u0101n, and Sult\u0101n\u012byah, the new metropolis recently founded by Uljayt\u016b.\n\nThe eight districts of Isfah\u0101n mentioned by \u1e24amd-Allah all exist at the present day (as do many of the villages which he also enumerates, and which are described by General Schindler in Eastern Persian Ir\u0101k, pp. 120, 122). The city, he says, originally consisted of four wards (still existing in name), viz., Karr\u0101n, K\u016bshk, J\u016bb\u0101rah, and Dardasht, the walls round these having been built by Rukn-ad-Dawlah the Buyid. In the Julb\u0101rah quarter (now pronounced Gulb\u0101rah, and lying to the north-east of modern Isfah\u0101n, round the Mayd\u0101n-i-Kuhn\u0101h or Old Square) was the Madrasah (College) and tomb of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad the Salj\u016bk, and here might be seen a block of stone weighing 10,000 man (equivalent, perhaps, to a little less than 32 tons weight), this being a great idol carried off by the Sultan from India, and set up before the College-gate (L. 142u). History, however, does not record that this Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad (a son of Malik-Sh\u0101h, who reigned from 498 to 511 A.H.) made any conquests in India, nor does \u1e24amd-Allah himself allude to the fact in the Guzidah when treating of his reign.\n\nIsfah\u0101n lay on the northern or left bank of the river Zandah-r\u016bd, which is described as rising in the mountains of Zardah K\u016bb, the 'Yellow Mountains,' still so called from their yellow limestone cliffs (L. 204g). Of this region also were the Ashkahr\u0101n mountains, lying on the frontiers of Greater Lur (L. 202u). After passing the cities of Fir\u016bz\u0101n [1] and Isfah\u0101n, the Zandah-r\u016bd flowed through the district of R\u016bdasht, of which the chief town was F\u0101rif\u0101n [2], and there became lost in the great swamp of G\u0101vkh\u0101n\u012b. The river was also known as the Zayindah or Zar\u012bn-r\u016bd, and, according to popular belief, after sinking into the G\u0101vkh\u0101n\u012b swamp, it flowed for sixty leagues underground to Kirm\u0101n,\n\n---\n\n1 The numbers in square brackets refer to the Map.\nwhen it rose again to the surface and thence attained the sea (L. 214r). Besides Isfah\u0101n town, the Isfah\u0101n district included the two great cities of F\u0101rif\u0101n and Fir\u016bz\u0101n. The former still exists as a village (Schindler, op. cit., p. 126) not far from the G\u0101vkh\u0101n\u012b swamp. Fir\u016bz\u0101n city has apparently disappeared from the map, but according to our author it stood on the river bank in the Kh\u0101nlanj\u0101n District, and paid revenue to the amount of 164,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs (about \u00a341,125). Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah (ii, 52), who visited the town, says it was six farsakhs distant from Isfah\u0101n.\n\nThe city of Ray (Rhages) was ruined during the Mongol invasion. Mustawfi says that in the time of Ghazan Kh\u0101n the houses were in part rebuilt, but Var\u0101min [3] had already supplanted it and become the chief town of the province. The Shrine of the Im\u0101m-Z\u0101dah \u2018Abd-al-\u2018Az\u012bm\u00b9 was to be seen near Ray, as mentioned in the Itinerary (Route ix), and the castle which was called \u1e6cabarik lay at the foot of the hill of K\u016bh \u1e6cabarik to the north, where there are said to have been silver-mines (L. 205t). Of this castle, however, apparently no trace exists, though the Shrine of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abd-al-\u2018Az\u012bm is still a famous place of visitation. Mention is made of the river Kard\u0101n-r\u016bd, which waters the Ray Districts, thence flowing out to the desert; and some other lesser streams are also named as coming down from the Kharrak\u0101n District; also the J\u0101ij-r\u016bd from Dam\u0101vand and the river Garm-r\u016bd or K\u016bh-r\u016bd of S\u0101uj-Bul\u0101k (L. 216v, r, and 217r, v, x, but cf. Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 304). The great mountain of Dam\u0101vand rose to the north of Ray, visible from a distance 100 leagues away, and of its many marvels\n\n\u00b9 Otherwise called Husayn, a son of the eighth Im\u0101m, \u2018Ali-ar-Rid\u0101. \u1e6cabarik is also the name of the Castle of Isfah\u0101n, which, according to \u2018Ali of Yazd (Zafar N\u0101mah, i, 431), was occupied by Timur, and of which the ruins still exist. The foundation of Kal\u2019ah \u1e6cabarik of Ray is ascribed by Z\u0101hir-ad-D\u012bn (Dorn, Muhammadische Quellen, i, p. 15 of the Persian text) to Man\u016bchahr the Ziy\u0101rid, at the beginning of the fifth century (the eleventh A.D.), and he states that \u1e6cabarik means a \u2018hillock,\u2019 being the diminutive form of \u1e6cabar, signifying a \u2018hill or mountain,\u2019 in the \u1e6cabarist\u0101n dialect. According to Yak\u016bt (iii, 507), \u1e6cabarik of Ray was destroyed in 588 (1192 A.D.) by Tughril II, the last Salju\u1e33 Sultan of \u1e6cr\u0101k, and Yak\u016bt gives a long account of the siege of the famous castle.\nHamd-Allah gives a full account (L. 203s). T\u012bhr\u0101n, the present capital of Persia [4], was already in the time of Hamd-Allah a fair-sized town, though formerly, he says, a mere village. Both Ray and Var\u0101m\u012bn are now only marked by rain-heaps lying some distance to the south of T\u012bhr\u0101n.\n\nSult\u0101niy\u0101h, founded by Argh\u016bn Kh\u0101n, was completed by Ulj\u0101yt\u016b, who made it the capital of \u012ar\u0101n; and he was buried here in a magnificent sepulchre, the ruins of which still exist. Hamd-Allah has much to say about K\u0101zv\u012bn, his native town, with its dependent villages, among which were D\u0101hand, F\u0101risj\u012bn [5], S\u016bmgh\u0101n [6], and Sag\u0101b\u0101d [7], lying on the road eastward as named in Routes ix and xxvi. He also describes its many streams, namely, the Khar-r\u016bd, the B\u016bh-r\u016bd, the Turkh\u0101n-r\u016bd, the K\u0101zv\u012bn river, and the \u0100b\u0101d-Kharrak\u0101n (L. 217j, q, r, s, t, v, and Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 305). These streams had their sources for the most part in the Barch\u012bn K\u016bh and the R\u0101khi\u1e0d (or R\u0101hand) mountain (L. 203s and 204n). Abhar [8], on the river of the same name (L. 217g), had a famous castle called \u1e24aydar\u012byah, after Haydar its builder, one of the Salj\u016bk princes; and to the north of Abhar on the Gil\u0101n frontier lay the Daylam and T\u0101l\u012bsh districts, among which were the towns of Ashk\u016br, Khawk\u0101n, and Khasj\u0101n (but the reading of these three last names is very uncertain, and they are not given by other writers, nor are they to be found on the map). The city of \u0100vah [9], between S\u0101vah [10] and Kum, stood on its river, the G\u0101vmah\u0101-r\u016bd, which flows down from near Hamad\u0101n in the west to the great dam between S\u0101vah and \u0100vah, where it forms a lake (L. 217a).\n\nThe R\u016bdb\u0101r district, in which stood the ruins of the famous castles of the Assassins, lay along the course of the river Sh\u0101h-r\u016bd, the lowest of the many affluents of the Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd; and the District was at some distance to the north of K\u0101zv\u012bn (L. 215n). The city of Zanj\u0101n lay on the Zanj\u0101n river, also called the M\u0101j-r\u016bd (L. 217e), which was another affluent of the Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd; and the town of Zanj\u0101n is said by Mustawfi to have been named Shah\u012bn by its first\nfounder, King Ardashir B\u0101bag\u0101n. The city of S\u0101vah [10] is chiefly remarkable for its lake, which history reported had miraculously dried up at the birth of the prophet Mu\u1e25ammad; lay on the Muzdak\u0101n river (L. 217n); and a number of villages are named by Mustawfi in the S\u0101vah District, of which, however, the readings are uncertain, and they are not to be found on the map. S\u0101uj-Bul\u0101k, the name of the district round Sunqur\u0101b\u0101d [11], meaning \u2018the cold spring,\u2019 is given in some MSS. (e.g., British Museum, Add. 23,543, and Cambridge, Add. 2,624), but this paragraph is omitted in the lithographed text. Under the Mongols it was considered as of the S\u0101vah Province, though it had originally been counted as of Ray; its villages were Khar\u0101v and Najm\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nSuj\u0101s and Suhravard [12] were before the Mongol invasion important towns according to I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (pp. 196, 200) and Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (iii, 40, 203); they are now apparently not marked on any modern map, though Sir H. Rawlinson, writing in 1840 (Journ. Roy. Geographical Society, x, 66), speaks of Suj\u0101s as a small village then existing, with Suhravard close to it. According to \u1e24amd-Allah, Suj\u0101s was five leagues distant to the south of Sul\u1e6d\u0101niyah (L. 145h), and the surrounding districts were called Jar\u016bd and Anjar\u016bd, apparently identical with Ijar\u016bd and Angur\u0101n of the present maps. In the hills near Suj\u0101s was the grave of Argh\u016bn Kh\u0101n, of which a long account is given in the Nushat. The town of Sat\u016br\u012b\u1e33 [13] lay at the western end of the Anjar\u016bd district, and was celebrated for its palace, rebuilt by Aba\u1e33ah Kh\u0101n, and the lake which was reported to be bottomless. This is the well-known Takht-i-Sulaym\u0101n, described by Sir H. Rawlinson (J.R.G.S., x, 65), who would identify this place as the site of the northern Ecbatana. The castle of Sarjah\u0101n [14] has disappeared from the map, but it lay five leagues to the east of Sul\u1e6d\u0101niyah on the T\u0101rum mountain, and Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (iii, 70), who had visited it, reports that it was one of the strongest castles of the district, and from its towers the city of Zanj\u0101n was plainly visible.\n\u015e\u0101in Kal'ah [15], which still exists,\u00b9 this being the Mongol name for the Kuh\u016bd village, lay south of the T\u0101rum district, otherwise called the T\u0101rumayn, 'the two T\u0101rums,' Upper and Lower, of which the capital formerly had been Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d. Of Upper T\u0101rum the chief town was Andar, with many dependent villages; in Lower T\u0101rum the most important place was the Castle of Sam\u012br\u0101n or Shamir\u0101n, of which Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 148) gives a long account. The streams of the T\u0101rum districts all flowed into the river Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd (L. 217k), and the name of this district (T\u0101rum) is still marked on the map. The T\u0101lik\u0101n district, which in the time of \u1e24amd-Allah lay to the south-east of T\u0101rum, apparently no longer exists, and the towns of Jar\u016bd, K\u016bhb\u0101nah, and Karaj, which our author mentions, are no longer to be found. K\u0101ghadh Kun\u0101n, 'the Paper Factory,' or Kh\u016bnaj [16], was an important place, the position of which is fixed by the Itinerary (Route xx) as south of the river Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd and fourteen leagues north of Zanj\u0101n, in the district known as the Mugh\u016bliyah. Muzda\u1e33\u0101n [17], which gave its name to the S\u0101vah river, as already mentioned, still exists, also S\u0101m\u0101n [18] at the place where the river rises. The three villages of \u1e6cabarik, Marjamn\u0101n, and Andij\u0101n lay among the hills to the north of Abhar [8], but have apparently now disappeared, and the Pushkil Darrah district was that lying to the east of Kazvin and south of T\u0101lik\u0101n.\n\nThe holy city of Kum was watered by the Gulpayg\u0101n river (L. 216z), and between Kum and \u0100vah was the salt mountain called K\u016bh-Namak-Lawn, a solitary hill, the summit of which was said to be unattainable (L. 206z). The neighbouring city of K\u0101sh\u0101n (which the older geographers always spelt K\u0101sh\u0101n, with the dotted k) had its water from the Kuhr\u016bd hills, the stream flowing to the desert (L. 217m). Ard\u012bst\u0101n [19], to the south-east of K\u0101sh\u0101n, and the Tafrish districts, to the westward of Kum, still exist, and Dalij\u0101n [20] lies about half-way between K\u0101sh\u0101n and Gulpayg\u0101n [21].\n\n\u00b9 Meaning 'the Castle of \u015e\u0101in,' possibly called after \u015e\u0101in, otherwise B\u0101\u1e6d\u016b Kh\u0101n, grandson of Changhiz Kh\u0101n.\nwhich latter town of old was called Jurb\u0101dak\u0101n. The hamlet of Zaw\u0101rah [22] lies on the desert border near Ard\u012bst\u0101n.\n\nComing to the western side of Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k, the Far\u0101h\u0101n District\u2014of which the chief town was Dih S\u0101r\u016bk [23], visited recently by Mrs. Bishop (Kurdistan, i, 146)\u2014is the region lying eastward of Hamad\u0101n. The chief town here at the present time is Sult\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, founded in the reign of Fath-\u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h at the beginning of the nineteenth century. According to \u1e24amd-Allah there was a lake here, which the Mongols called Jagh\u0101r Naz\u016bd (but the reading is uncertain), which is doubtless the present Lake of Tual\u0101 to the north of Sult\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d. Dawlat\u0101b\u0101d was of the Far\u0101h\u0101n villages, and this is still an important place lying to the east of Nih\u0101vand. The city of Karaj, called Karaj of Abu Dulaf, has entirely disappeared from the map. Its position is given in the Itinerary (Route vii), and from the fact that the town lay to the south of the R\u0101smand mountains, which are those now known under the name of R\u0101sband, it is easy to locate the site. The streams from these hills watered the celebrated pastures called Marghz\u0101r K\u012bt\u016b (or K\u012bs\u016b) lying round the town; and its castle was named Farz\u012bn (L. 204h). Returning once more to the eastern side of the province, near the desert border was Na\u1e6danz [24], with the castles called Nism\u016br and Wash\u0101k, with the District of Mar\u0101wadin, but the reading of these three last names is very uncertain, and with the exception of Wash\u0101k, which is mentioned in the Guzidah (see E. G. Browne, J.R.A.S., 1901, p. 25, n. 4), being also copied into the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 299), these names do not occur elsewhere.\n\nIn the south-western corner of the province of Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k was Lurist\u0101n, divided between the Greater and the Lesser Lur districts. \u012adhaj, otherwise known as M\u0101l-Am\u012br [25], was the capital of Great Lur, the district which lay entirely to the south of the great bend of the K\u0101r\u016bn (between its left bank and the plain-country); and Great Lur for the most part had been counted as of Kh\u016bzist\u0101n by the Arab geographers. \u012adhaj was famous for its bridge, and its\nwhirlpool, and the city has been described by Ibn Bat\u016b\u1e6dah (ii, 29), who visited this region. The town of \u2018Ar\u016bj, or \u2018Ar\u016bh, otherwise called S\u016bsan, or S\u016bs [26], also lay on the K\u0101r\u016bn river, some four leagues to the north-west of Mal-Am\u012br, and this place must not be confounded with the other S\u016bs in Kh\u016bzist\u0101n to the south of Dizf\u016bl. Its ruins have been described by Sir H. Rawlinson, and were visited by Sir H. Layard (see the J.R.G.S. for 1839, ix, 83; also 1842, xii, 103). Lurdag\u0101n, or Lurk\u0101n [27], is found on the map near the affluent joining the K\u0101r\u016bn at its extreme western point. The district of Lesser Lur was the highland to the north of the great bend of the K\u0101r\u016bn; and in his Gus\u012bdah Hamd-Allah gives the following account of this district, which is worth quoting\u00b9:\n\n\u201cIn the province of Lesser Lur are three rivers, namely, the \u0100b-i-Sil\u0101kh\u016br flowing down to Dizf\u016bl, the Khurr\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d river which goes towards \u1e24aw\u012bzah, and the Kazk\u012b (?) river which also flows down by Dizf\u016bl towards \u1e24aw\u012bzah. And there are three towns that are still flourishing places, namely, Bur\u016bjird, Khurr\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, and S\u0101b\u016brkhw\u0101st. This last was of old an immense city, extremely populous, being inhabited by people from all nations, for it was the residence of kings: it is now, however, merely a provincial town. Finally, in Lesser Lur are three ruined cities named Kirisht (?), B\u016brisht (?); and \u1e62aymarah.\u201d\n\nThe importance of this passage lies in the proof here given that S\u0101b\u016brkhw\u0101st is not identical with Khurr\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, as has been often supposed, since both towns existed in the time of Mustawfi; and the fact is confirmed by his statement in the Itinerary (Route vii) that, bifurcating at Bur\u016bjird from the Karaj high road, \u201cthe road to S\u0101b\u016brkhw\u0101st here goes off to the right hand\u201d (L. 195r). The ruins of S\u0101b\u016brkhw\u0101st [28] have not yet been identified, but they must\n\n\u00b9 The paragraph is given at the end of Section xi of Chapter IV, immediately before the Section devoted to the Mongols. It is wanting in many MSS., but occurs in the old MS. of which I made a copy in Shiraz in 1880, and also is found in the British Museum MSS. numbered Add. 7,630, Add. 22,693, and Egerton, 690.\nbe sought for some few leagues to the south of Khurram\u0101b\u0101d [29]. The town of Bur\u016bjird [30] is frequently mentioned by Istakhri (pp. 258, 262) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 596); the Arab geographers, however, appear not to have known of Khurram\u0101b\u0101d in Lesser Lur, and \u1e24amd-Allah is probably the earliest authority to mention this important town. He says that dates grew well both here and at Saymarah [31], the old capital of the Mihraj\u0101nkhadhak District; according to Ibn Rustah (p. 269) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 443), already in the fourteenth century A.D. a ruin. Saymarah is marked on the map at some distance from the western bank of the Karkhah river, but I am unable to identify Sams\u0101 (or Samh\u0101) and D\u016bs-i-Siy\u0101h, 'the Black Castle,' which stood near it according to our author. Somewhere in Lesser Lur also was the mountain called Huwayn (or Har\u012bn) K\u016bh, where there were celebrated iron-mines (L. 207b). In regard to the three rivers of Lesser Lur mentioned in the Guzidah, these are referred to again in the Nushat (L. 215u, v). Sil\u0101kh\u016br is the name of the plain in which Bur\u016bjird stands, and its river is the chief source of the \u0100b-i-Diz; further the Kazk\u012b is apparently the affluent now known as the \u0100b-i-Baznoi. The Khurram\u0101b\u0101d river drains to the Karkhah, which \u1e24amd Allah describes as passing through the \u1e24awizah country, and this latter river now joins the K\u0101r\u016bn below Ahw\u0101z, as will be noticed in the chapter on Khuzist\u0101n. The Karkhah and its affluents came down from the Alvand mountain (L. 202v), lying southward of Hamad\u0101n; its peaks were almost always covered with snow, and forty-two streams take their rise in this region, which, says Mustawfi, measures thirty leagues in circumference.\n\n\u1e24amadan city, when \u1e24amd-Allah wrote, was for the most part in ruins; it included five townships, Kal'ah Kabrit\u2014'Sulphur Castle';\u2014Kal'ah M\u0101kin, Girdl\u0101kh, the Kishl\u0101k or 'Winter Quarters' of Shuj\u0101'-ad-D\u012bn Kh\u016brsh\u012bd, and Amas\u016b. The surrounding province comprised five other districts with many villages, namely, Far\u012bv\u0101r (or Kar\u012bw\u0101r), Am\u0101nd\u016bn (or Ag\u0101y\u0101rd\u016bn), Shar\u0101h\u012bn (or Shar\u0101m\u012bn), A'lam, with Nasrud and Barbandr\u016bd (or Barhanar\u016bd). None of\nthese names appear on the present map (those given in parenthesis are from the Turkish text of the *Jih\u0101n Num\u0101*, p. 300); but Far\u012bv\u0101r was watered by the upper affluent of the G\u0101vm\u0101h\u0101 or G\u0101vm\u0101sa river (already mentioned), which rose in the hills of Asad\u0101b\u0101d [32] to the north-west of the city (L. 217a).\n\nThe places called M\u0101jal\u016b and Tams\u0101r appear to be unknown, but the two districts of Kharrak\u0101n (marked Karagh\u0101n on our maps) are those lying to the south-west of K\u0101zvin, towards which and out eastward to Ray the Kharrak\u0101n streams took their course (L. 217v), as already described. The chief town in the Kharrak\u0101n District is \u0100bah [33] or \u0100vah (not to be confounded with \u0100vah near S\u0101vah, already mentioned), and there were besides forty other villages. The Darguz\u012bn District lies between Kharrak\u0101n and Hamad\u0101n, Darguz\u012bn [34] being also the name of the chief town of the district, and this formerly had been included in A\u02bflam, one of the five Districts, as already mentioned, of Hamad\u0101n, which, says \u1e24amd-Allah, by the Persians was called Al\u0101mar. R\u016bdar\u016bd or R\u016bdr\u0101var [35] was a large town, the ruins of which still exist at R\u016bdil\u0101var (*Mission Scientifique*, De Morgan, ii, 136), near Tuvi and Sark\u0101n. These ruins probably also represent the older town of Karaj of Hamad\u0101n, which, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (ii, 832; iv, 251), was the capital of this R\u016bdar\u016bd district, and lay seven leagues distant both from Hamad\u0101n and from N\u012bh\u0101vand. Here were the five Districts named from the rivers Hind-r\u016bd, Sark\u0101n-r\u016bd, Karz\u0101n-r\u016bd, Lami-r\u016bd, and Barazmahin respectively.\n\nS\u0101m\u0101n of Kharrak\u0101n, at the headwaters of the Muzdak\u0101n river, has already been mentioned. Shabdabahar and Ful\u0101d (the readings are uncertain) are districts no longer shown on our maps, but which probably lay near the city of N\u012bh\u0101vand; and this last, Mustawf\u012b writes, comprised three Districts, named Mal\u0101ir, Isfidh\u0101n, and Jah\u016bk, which, however, are likewise not to be found on modern maps. Coming finally to the south-eastern corner of the province of Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k, \u1e24amd-Allah notices the cities of Yazd, Maybud [36], and Nay\u012bn [37], which, as he rightly remarks, were formerly\ncounted as belonging to I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr (Persepolis), and hence were of the province of F\u0101rs.\n\nChapter 3. Adharbayj\u0101n.\n\nContents: Tabr\u012bz, 153p, and its seven districts, viz., Mihr\u0101n-r\u016bd, Sard-r\u016bd, S\u0101vil-r\u016bd, Ar\u016bnak, R\u016bdkab, Kh\u0101num-r\u016bd, and Bid\u016bst\u0101n, 155e; Awj\u0101n, 155v; Tas\u016bj or Tar\u016bj, 156a; Ardabil, 156c; Khalkh\u0101l and Firuz\u0101b\u0101d, 156k; D\u0101rmara\u1e93, 156s. The Sh\u0101hr\u016bd district, 156t; the Pishkin district, 156w; Un\u0101r and Arj\u0101k, 157a; Ahar, 157d; Takallafah and Jiy\u0101r, 157f; Dar\u0101vard, 157h; Kal'ah Kahr\u0101n, 157j; Kalantar, 157k; Kil\u0101n-Fadl\u016bn, 157m; Murd\u0101n Na'im, 157n; Naw-Diz, 157o; Maft, 157s; Khuvi or Khoi, 157t; Salm\u0101s, 157x; Urm\u012byah, 158b; Ushn\u016by\u0101h, 158g; Sar\u0101v, 158k; Miy\u0101nij and the Garm-r\u016bd, 158n; Mar\u0101ghah, 158q; Pasav\u0101, 158x; Dih Khw\u0101rk\u0101n, 158s; Layl\u0101n, 159b; Marand, 159c; Dizm\u0101r, 159h; Zanj\u012by\u0101n, 159l; Riwaz, 159m; Karkar, 159n; Nakhchiv\u0101n, 159o; Akhb\u0101n and Urd\u016bbad, 159r.\n\n\u1e24amd-Allah notes that the capital of Adharbayj\u0101n under the earlier Mongols had been Mar\u0101ghah, but this preeminence had in his day been transferred to Tabr\u012bz.\u00b9 A very full account is next given of Tabr\u012bz, beginning with its early history, and how it had recently been rebuilt and enlarged by Gh\u0101z\u0101n Kh\u0101n. Details follow of the new walls, with the ten city gates, also of the outer suburb and wall, with its six gates. Tabr\u012bz, according to \u1e24amd-Allah, was the largest city in Persia; it was watered by the river Mihr\u0101n-r\u016bd, which rose in the Sahand mountain lying to the south, and round the city lay the seven districts (given above) called for the most part after the various streams which irrigate their lands (the reading of these\n\n\u00b9 The Arab geographers generally give Ardabil as the capital city; and this became also the capital of Persia under the earlier Safav\u012b kings, until Sh\u0101h 'Abb\u0101s removed his court to Isfah\u0101n.\nnames, however, is in many cases very uncertain). The Mihr\u0101n-r\u016bd, which ran through the suburbs of Tabr\u012bz, and the Sard-r\u016bd to the south-west, which also came down from Mount Sahand, both joined the Sar\u0101v-r\u016bd at a short distance to the north of the city; and this latter river, which rose in the great mountain district called Sabl\u0101n-k\u016bh to the north-east of Tabr\u012bz, flowed out into the Urm\u012byah Lake, some forty miles away to the westward of the city. The mountains of Sahand and Sabl\u0101n, as also these various streams, are all carefully described by \u1e24amd-Allah in Appendices II and IV (L. 204c, 205h, 217c, 218e, j).\n\nThe Urm\u012byah Lake appears to have been known to \u1e24amd-Allah under the name of the Lake of Khanjast,\u00b9 but the origin of the name is nowhere explained. He also frequently refers to it as the Salt Lake (Dary\u0101-i-Sh\u016br), or as the Lake of Tar\u016bj or Tas\u016bj, from the name of the town near its northern shore; and he writes that in an island of the lake the Mongol Princes had their burial-place under a great hill (L. 226f'). The town of Awj\u0101n, or Uj\u0101n [1], which Gh\u0101z\u0101n Kh\u0101n had rebuilt, lies to the east of Tabr\u012bz, and its river, which rises in Mount Sahand, joins the Sar\u0101v-r\u016bd (L. 218a). Tar\u016bj [2] or Tas\u016bj,\u00b2 which sometimes gave its name to the Urm\u012byah Lake, lay close to its northern shore, and to the west of Tabr\u012bz.\n\nArdabil lay at the foot of Mount Sabl\u0101n, on the river Andar\u0101b, also called the Ardabil river; this, after passing the Bridge of \u2018Ali-Sh\u0101h, became an affluent of the Ahar\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. vary greatly as to the spelling of the name; Janjast, Janjish, Khujant, and Hanjast appear with other variants. The medieval Arab geographers knew of the lake also under various names: thus Mas\u2018\u016bd\u012b (i, 98) and Ibn Hawkal (p. 247) call it the Lake of Kab\u016bdh\u0101n, Istakhri (p. 181) writes of the Buhayrab-ash-Shar\u0101t, and in Mukaddasi (p. 380) it is called merely the Lake of Urm\u012byah. Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 42) knows it as the Lake of Til\u0101; and according to H\u0101fiz Abr\u016b (MSS., folio 27a) the island in the middle of the lake (now the Sh\u0101h\u012b peninsula, which only becomes an island at flood-water: see R. T. G\u00fcnther, Geographical Journal for 1899, p. 516) was crowned by the castle known as Kal\u2019ah Til\u0101, said to have been built by Il\u016blag\u0101 Kh\u0101n. He had stored his treasures here, and after his death his tomb was made in this castle, which henceforth was called G\u016br-Kal\u2019ah, or \u2018Tomb-Castle.\u2019\n\n\u00b2 Both spellings are given in the MSS. and occur on the present maps. In the map to the paper referred to in the previous note, Mr. G\u00fcnther gives the name as Turseh.\nriver, which last flowed into the Aras (L. 217w). Above Ardabil, on the slopes of Mount Sabl\u0101n, stood the Castles of Diz Bahm\u0101n and Diz R\u016by\u012bn (or R\u016bbin) with some others (L. 204v). Khalkh\u0101l is still the name of the District at the foot of Mount Sabl\u0101n; in the time of Mustawfi it was also the name of its chief town [3], but this has apparently disappeared. The town, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 198) and the Itinerary, was two days' march from Ardabil. In former times Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d had been the capital of the Khalkh\u0101l District, and Mustawfi mentions a number of the neighbouring villages (Amidah, Kh\u0101midah-Bil, Sanjad-r\u016bd, and Zanjil\u0101b\u0101d), but none of these unfortunately are now to be found on the map. D\u0101rmaraz, with the villages of K\u016bl, J\u0101mk\u016b, and Z\u0101har, was of this neighbourhood. Sh\u0101hr\u016bd was the District on the stream called the \u0100b-Sh\u0101l, an affluent of the Safid-r\u016bd (L. 218h). Of this district the chief places were Sh\u0101l [4] and Kul\u016br (which still exist), and adjacent lay the T\u0101lish (or Taw\u0101lish) District of \u2018Ir\u0101k \u2018Ajami. Pishkin (which in the present maps is written M\u012bshk\u012bn) is the name of the District of which Ahar [5] was the chief town; the town of Pishkin also existed, and formerly was known as Var\u0101v\u012b, lying one march from Ahar. A number of other places were of this district, among them Takallafah, Un\u0101r, which with Var\u0101v\u012b is described by Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 367; iv, 918), also Arj\u0101k, Jiy\u0101r, and Kalantar, this last being at the foot of the hill called Siy\u0101h K\u016bh, 'the black mountain' (L. 205k). Most of the other places in Pishkin here mentioned must have stood on the southern slopes of the Sabl\u0101n mountain (L. 204v), though only the last named, Kalantar, now appears on the map, Ibn Pishkin being the family name of the Amir of the Province.\n\nThe city of Ahar [5] lay on the river of the same name (the Ahar-r\u016bd). This flowed down from the Pass of Arm\u012bn\u0101n, which the Mongols called G\u00fclchah Nil (Blue Lake), and after taking up the Ardabil river discharged into the Aras (L. 217y; see also Route xxiii). To the north of Ahar was the mountain called Sarahand (L. 205e), and in the neighbourhood at the foot of Mount Sabl\u0101n stood the\nfollowing places, namely, Dar\u0101vard, where the Mongols had their winter quarters, the Castle of Kahr\u0101n, Kil\u0101n-Fa\u1e0dl\u016bn, and M\u0101ft (some MSS. have Y\u0101ft, and B\u0101ft is printed in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 385). Murd\u0101n Na'im apparently lay to the northward of Ahar, on the Aras river. The castle of Naw-Diz (surrounded by the towns of H\u016bl, B\u016bl, Hinduv\u0101n, and Bul\u016bk-Inj\u016b) stood on the upper waters of the Ahar river and is described by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 822). The city of Khuv\u012b [6], or Khoi, stands on an affluent of the Aras which rose in the mountains to the north of Salm\u0101s [7]. This latter city, as well as Urm\u012byah [8], which now gives its name to the Lake, and Usbn\u016by\u0101h [9], all lie at some distance to the westward from the shore, standing on streams that flow into the Lake. The town of Sar\u0101v [10], otherwise written Sar\u0101t or Sar\u0101b, lies under Sabl\u0101n K\u016bh in the midst of four Districts, these are named by Mustawfi Warzand, Darand, Bar\u0101gh\u016bsh, and Sakhir; its stream has already been mentioned as the most important of the rivers flowing through Tabr\u012bz.\n\nMiy\u0101nah or Miy\u0101nij [11], formerly a large town, but when our author wrote a mere village, stands in the Garm-r\u016bd or 'Hot River' district. At some distance above the town the river Garm-r\u016bd, which rises in the mountains south of Sar\u0101v, joins the left bank of the Miy\u0101nij river, and this last below the town further receives the water of the Hasht-r\u016bd\u2014'Eight Streams'\u2014on its right bank, which, before flowing in, passed under a great bridge of thirty-two arches, and had its source in the hills to the eastward of Mar\u0101ghah (L. 218h, n, q; also Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 388). The Miy\u0101nij river itself came down from the west, rising in the country south of Uj\u0101n; after receiving the streams of its two affluents, it turned northward at no great distance from the town of Miy\u0101nij, and poured its water into the Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd, which from this point, and down a considerable length of its lower course, formed the boundary between the provinces of Adharbayj\u0101n and Persian 'Ir\u0101k. The Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd\u2014'White River'\u2014which Mustawfi says the Turks called H\u016bl\u0101n M\u016bl\u0101n (evidently a corruption\nof the Mongol words *Ulan M\u00f6ren*), meaning 'Red River,' had its head-waters in the Kurdist\u0101n province in the Jib\u0101l Panj Angusht, called in Turkish Besh-parmak, both names signifying the 'Five-finger-mountain.' Flowing northward, the Safid-r\u016bd first received the Zanj\u0101n river (already mentioned in Chapter 2) on its right bank, then the Miy\u0101nij rivers on its left bank, and, next turning westward, received also on its left bank the united streams of the Sanjidah and Gadiw-r\u016bd (given in the *Jih\u0101n Num\u0101*, p. 388, as Sanjad and Kadp\u016b) coming down from the hills to the south of Ardabil (L. 218f), the position of which river is fixed by the Itinerary (Route xx). Below this, and also on the left bank, there flowed in the Sh\u0101l river from the Sh\u0101hr\u016bd District, already spoken of in a previous paragraph. After passing through the T\u0101l\u012bsh district, the Safid-r\u016bd was next joined on its right bank by the T\u0101rum river, and then by the river Sh\u0101h-r\u016bd of the Country of the Assassins, both of which streams have already been mentioned in Chapter 2, and finally in Kawtam of the Gil\u0101n Province the Safid-r\u016bd flowed out to the Caspian (L. 215c).\n\nMar\u0101ghah, one of the former capitals of the province of Adharbayj\u0101n, stood on the river \u0160\u0101fi-r\u016bd, which, rising in Mount Sahand, flowed out directly, or indirectly by overflowing into the bed of the Jaght\u016b-r\u016bd, into the Urmiyah Lake (L. 218g). The city of Mar\u0101ghah was famous for the Observatory built by the order of H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n for N\u0101\u1e63ir-ad-D\u012bn of T\u016bs, the astronomer, but in the time of \u1e24amd-Allah this building was already in ruins. The districts of Mar\u0101ghah are given as Saraj\u016bn, Niy\u0101j\u016bn, Dazakh-r\u016bd, G\u0101vd\u016bl, Hasht-r\u016bd, Bihist\u0101n, Ang\u016br\u0101n, and K\u016bl Uz\u0101n.\n\n---\n\n1 Part of its course is now known as the K\u0131z\u0131l Uzen, which in Turkish has the same meaning. For the Mongol words see *Mongolisch-Deutsch W\u00f6rterbuch*, by J. J. Schmidt, pp. 52b and 223c. From this and other passages, it is clear that Mustawfi uses *Mugh\u0101l* (Mongol) and *Turk* indifferently.\n\n2 This stream is now called the Sh\u0101hr\u016bd, like the great right bank affluent from the mountains north of Kazvin, with which it must not be confounded.\n\n3 These are described by General Schindler in the Berlin *Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Erdkunde*, 1883, p. 338, and a plan is there given.\nbut the spellings are uncertain. Basaw\u0101 [12] or Pasav\u0101 will be found on the map to the south-east of Ushn\u016byah, and Dih Khw\u0101rk\u0101n [13], on a stream from Mount Sahand, lies near the eastern shore of Lake Urm\u012byah. Layl\u0101n [14]\u2014the MSS. generally spell the name Nayl\u0101n\u2014is on the Jaght\u016b river, which, side by side with the river Taght\u016b, both rising in the Kurdist\u0101n hills, flows into the lake from the south. At periods of high flood the waters of the rivers \u0160\u0101f\u012b, Taght\u016b, and Jaght\u016b all mingle together in the swamp formed at the south-western corner of the Urm\u012byah Lake (L. 218b, p).\n\nThe town of Marand [15] lies to the north of the lake, and its river, which is also called the Z\u016bl\u016b, is a tributary of the Khoi (or Khuvi) river, which flows to the Aras (L. 218/). To the northward of Marand lay the castle of Dizm\u0101r, on a tributary of the Aras, which Y\u0101k\u016bt (ii, 573) has also described. Zanj\u012by\u0101n or Zangiy\u0101n [16] stood near the bridge over the Aras called P\u016bl-i-Khud\u0101 \u0100far\u012bn, and this was counted as of the Murd\u0101n Na'im district mentioned above. In this neighbourhood also appears to have been the town of R\u012bvaz\u2014some MSS. give Zath\u016br and D\u012bvaz, with Zan\u016bz in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 387). Karkar [17] is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 262), and is possibly identical with the fortress named \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r Karn\u012b (from a mistake of the copyist) by 'Al\u012b of Yazd; it stood close to the great bridge over the Aras, built by Diya-al-Mulk, son of Malik-Sh\u0101h's Waz\u012br, the celebrated Ni\u1e93\u0101m-al-Mulk. 'Al\u012b of Yazd describes this bridge at some length (\u1e92afar N\u0101mah, i, 399), and it crossed the Aras on the direct road from Nakhchiv\u0101n to Marand.\n\nNakhchiv\u0101n [18], which the Arab geographers called Nashaw\u0101, lies to the north of the Aras, and four leagues from the city was the snow-clad mountain of M\u0101st-K\u016bh (L. 206r). The fortress of Alanjik, according to Saint Martin (M\u00e9moire sur l'Arm\u00e9nie, i, 146), was called Erenjag in Armenian, and lay a short distance to the east of Nakhchiv\u0101n. Mustawfi also speaks of Sh\u016brm\u0101r\u012b, Naghaz, and Fagh\u0101n as fortresses of the Nakhchiv\u0101n District; and probably likewise of this\nneighbourhood was Akhb\u0101n (or Ajn\u0101n), known as the K\u0101r-kh\u0101nah or 'Workshop,' on account of the works at the neighbouring copper-mine. Urd\u016bb\u0101d [19] stands on the Aras, at the junction of a stream from the north, which Mustawfi says rises in Mount Kiy\u0101n (or Kib\u0101n), and on this same river higher up lay Az\u0101d, the last town mentioned in this chapter.\n\nChapter 4. M\u016bgh\u0101n and Arr\u0101n.\n\nContents: Bajarv\u0101n, 159z; Barzand, 160f; Pilv\u0101r, 160j; Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d and Hamshahrah, 160k; Baylak\u0101n, 160m; Ganjah, 160p; Barda\u2018ah, 160s; H\u012brak, 160v.\n\nM\u016bgh\u0101n or M\u016bk\u0101n is still the name of the Steppe country lying south of the lower course of the Aras river. \u1e24amd-Allah states that this district stretched from the right bank of the river southward to the pass of Sang-bar-Sang\u2014'Stone upon Stone'\u2014in the hills above Pishkin, and that from the plain the mountain of Sabl\u0101n K\u016bh was everywhere visible. As of this province he also mentions (L. 206k) the region called Gulist\u0101n K\u016bh\u2014'Rose-garden mountain'\u2014noted for its flowers, and here the Mul\u0101\u1e25id sect or Assassins had their famous paradise. Bajarv\u0101n had of old been the capital of M\u016bgh\u0101n, but in the time of Mustawfi was fallen to ruin and become a mere village. It is no longer found on the map, but its position is given in the Itinerary (Routes xx and xxiii) as lying four leagues north of Barzand [1], which still exists, and which was a notable town as early as the days of the Caliph Mu\u2018ta\u0161im, son of \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd. Pilv\u0101r [2] or Pilsuv\u0101r (not marked on any map) stood on the stream coming from Bajarv\u0101n, and was eight leagues distant from the latter town. It is said to have been named after an Am\u012br of the Buyids. Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d [3] in the plain of G\u0101vbar\u012b, near the Caspian, according to the Itinerary (Route xxi) was twelve leagues beyond Pilv\u0101r. Hamshahrah lay two leagues distant from the sea-shore; it\nwas also called B\u016b-Shahrah or Abar-Shahr, according to the *Jih\u0101n Num\u0101* (p. 393), but it is impossible now to fix exactly the position of any of these places, which appear to have completely disappeared from the modern maps.\n\nThe territory of Arr\u0101n, which the Arab geographers always spell Al-R\u0101n (pronounced Ar-R\u0101n), as though it were an Arabic name, is the triangle of land included between the rivers Aras and Kur\u2014the Araxes and Cyrus. The Aras is described (L. 213b) as rising in the K\u0101lik\u0101l\u0101 mountains near Arzan-ar-R\u016bm (now Erzerum), whence it flows through Armenia and along the southern border of Arr\u0101n to its junction with the Kur, having been previously joined from the south, or right bank, by the K\u0101ra S\u016b, the name, apparently, of the lower course of united streams which flow down from Ardabil and Ahar described in Chapter 3. The river Kur (L. 215y) also rose in the K\u0101lik\u0101l\u0101 mountains, and passing through Gurjist\u0101n came to the city of Tifl\u012bs. Below this town it formed the northern frontier of Arr\u0101n, and \u1e24amd-Allah states that here a branch went off to the Lake of Shamk\u016br, though what sheet of water is thus indicated is not very clear. Thence the main stream of the Kur passed on down to its junction with the Aras, the combined streams flowing out to the Caspian after passing through the Gusht\u0101sf\u012b country.\n\nThe capital of Arr\u0101n was Baylak\u0101n, at the close of the fourteenth century A.D. frequently mentioned by \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd in his account of the conquests of Timur. During his siege the city was partially destroyed, but was rebuilt in 1403 A.D. by command of Timur, and a canal dug, six farsakhs long, bringing to it the waters of the Aras river (*Zafar N\u0101mah*, ii, 543, 545). Though apparently all traces of the town have disappeared, its approximate position is fixed by the Arab Itineraries of Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 122), \u1e32ud\u0101mah (p. 213), and Ibn \u1e24awkal (p. 251). According to these Baylak\u0101n lay fourteen leagues south of Bardh\u0101\u2019ah, and seven or nine leagues north of the Aras bank, on the road coming up from Barzand. In Armenian it was known as Phaidagaran (Saint Martin, *M\u00e9moire sur l\u2019Arm\u00e9nie,*\nBardh\u0101'ah [4], a town that still exists, the name being more often written Barda', stood on the river Tartur, a right bank affluent of the Kur; and Ganjah to the north-west is now more generally known as Elizabetpol, its Russian name. Sirak, or Hirak, was the name of the summer pastures above Barda', but it is not now found marked on our maps, and in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 392) the name is printed Tark.\n\nChapter 5. Sh\u012brv\u0101n.\n\nContents: B\u0101k\u016byah, 159s and 161a; Sham\u0101kh\u012b, 161a; Kabalah, 161c; Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d or Fir\u016bzkub\u0101d, 161d; the Gusht\u0101sf District, 161e.\n\nThe province of Sh\u012brv\u0101n lay to the north of the Kur river, and extended to the foot of that part of the Caucasus range known to Moslem geographers as Darband-i-B\u0101b-al-Abw\u0101b\u2014'the Barrier of the Gate of Gates.' B\u0101k\u016byah, or B\u0101k\u016b, was its port on the Caspian, and Sham\u0101kh\u012b inland\u2014now called Shem\u0101kh\u0101\u2014was the capital city, famous, as Mustawfi relates, from the legendary Rock of Moses and the Fountain of Life, both of which were said to have existed here. Kabalah stood near the mountains; its position is unknown, but from its mention by 'Al\u012b of Yazd (i, 406) when describing the campaigns of Timur in Georgia, it must have stood very near the river Kur, and the Kabalah mountain is also mentioned by Mustawfi (L. 206d). Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d, or Fir\u016bz-kub\u0101d, both names being given by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 928, 929), was a town standing in the neighbourhood of the Caspian, though its position cannot be more exactly fixed. The Gusht\u0101sf province, said to have been so named after Gusht\u0101sf, one of the ancient Persian kings, formed part of Sh\u012brv\u0101n, and lay along the shore of the Caspian above the mouth of the Aras river.\nChapter 6. Gurjist\u0101n and Abkh\u0101s.\n\nContents: Al\u0101n, 161k; \u0100n\u012b, 161m; Tifl\u012bs, 161n; Khun\u0101n, 161p; Kar\u015f, 161p.\n\nIn the district of Abkhasia Al\u0101n is given by Mustawfi as the name of a town lying under the Alburz Mountains on an affluent of the Kur. \u0100n\u012b was the ancient capital of Georgia, the ruins of which still remain; but Tifl\u012bs had become the chief city of the province already in the time of \u1e24amd-Allah. Khun\u0101n (reading uncertain, Jan\u0101n, Khab\u0101n, and Hab\u0101n, all being given in the MSS.) was the name of a castle on the Arr\u0101n frontier. According to Mukaddas\u012b (p. 382) and other Arab geographers this town lay halfway between Shamk\u016br and Tifl\u012bs, being three marches from either place. Kar\u015f, to the south-west of Tifl\u012bs, was already a town with a strong fortress when \u1e24amd-Allah wrote.\n\nChapter 7.

Unfortunately, the Arab geographers afford us but little information about Asia Minor, which, during the earlier centuries of the Abbasids, had of course formed part of the Byzantine empire, and which only came within the boundaries of Islam when occupied (470 A.H.) by the Saljuks of Rum in the latter part of the eleventh century A.D. The next two centuries (the sixth and seventh of the Hijrah) were the period of magnificence for these Saljuks in Asia Minor, after which their power rapidly waned before the rising glory of the Ottoman Turks, whose Sultan, 'Orkh\u0101n, in the early part of the fourteenth century A.D. had established his capital at Brusa, had organized the famous corps of the Janissaries, and, after taking Nicomedia in 1327 and Nicea in 1330, was threatening the Hellespont.\n\nThis was the state of affairs when Mustawfi wrote, and which is described by his contemporary Ibn Bat\u016b\u1e6dah, who travelled over the length and the breadth of Asia Minor during the year 733 (1333 A.D.). The description of Asia Minor given by Mustawfi, however, evidently dates from an earlier period, and gives an account of the country as it was under the Saljuks; he knows nothing of the later conquests of the Turks, and the most western town, apparently, that he mentions is G\u00fcl H\u0131\u1e63\u0101r, 120 miles south-west of Antakiyah. More than one-half of the places mentioned in this chapter of the Nushat can easily be identified on the modern map; but unfortunately, among some fifty place-names, I am unable to fix either the position or the true reading for nearly a score of towns, and neither Ibn Bat\u016b\u1e6dah nor H\u0101jj\u012b Khalfah are of much aid in the matter.\n\nThe Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 of the latter author quotes little of the Nushat in the chapters devoted to Asia Minor, and the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 describes the country as it existed in the days when H\u0101jj\u012b Khalfah wrote, namely, at the beginning of the seventeenth century A.D., when all Asia Minor had for nearly three centuries formed an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. Further, the information which Mustawfi gives\nabout the towns that he names is very meagre, and the alphabetical order, in which for the most part these names are arranged, unfortunately fails to give the clue which we should have were the towns mentioned according to the various districts, or province by province.\n\nThe chief city of the Kingdom of R\u016bm was S\u012bv\u0101s (Sebasteia), which had been rebuilt by \u2018Al\u0101-ad-D\u012bn Kay-Kub\u0101d the Salj\u016bk. Its wool was famous and was largely exported. Abulust\u0101n is now known as Al-Bust\u0101n, and is the medi\u00e6val Arabissus. Ank\u016brah (written with the dotted k and short vowel) is Angora; but the name, as Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 390) states, is more generally written Ang\u016briyah (with y or k, and long vowels), under which form it frequently occurs in the Zafar N\u0101mah of \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd (ii, 417 and elsewhere). Arzanj\u0101n on the upper Euphrates and Arzan-ar-R\u016bm (Erzerum) need no comment, being well known. Ar\u0101k also lay near the Euphrates, but it is not apparently marked on the map; neither is Aks\u012bk to be found, but the readings in both cases are doubtful. \u0100\u1e33 Sar\u0101y\u2014\u2018White Palace\u2019\u2014is some distance to the south-west of the Tatta Lake; it was built by \u2018Izz-ad-D\u012bn K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7-Arsl\u0101n the Salj\u016bk in 566 (1171 A.D.).\n\nThere were two places called \u0100\u1e33 Shahr\u2014\u2018White Town\u2019\u2014one lying seven leagues north-west of Arzanj\u0101n; the other a town three marches to the north-west of K\u016bniyah, and both are marked on our maps. Am\u0101siyah (Amaseia on the Halys) and Ant\u0101kiyah (Antiocheia) still exist. Awnik or Avan\u012bk is given by Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 408), and \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd (i, 691) mentions it as having been stormed and captured by Timur; it being a castle in the mountains eight leagues distant from Arzan-ar-R\u016bm. Mustawfi adds that the town at the foot of the castle was called Abaskh\u016br; and according to Saint Martin (M\u00e9moire, i, 109) Avan\u012bk is the place now called in Turkish Jav\u0101n Kal'ah, which lies to the north of the Aras between Hasan Kal'ah on the west and Majankird on the east. B\u0101birt lies to the north of Arzanj\u0101n, but I am unable to identify Z\u016bfarl\u016b, Z\u016bbark\u012b, Dh\u016bl\u016b (or Z\u016bl\u016b), and Shahrah, which last is reported to have\nstood on the coast of the Black Sea; the spelling, however, of the first three names is very doubtful, and apparently none of them occur in the pages of the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, or in any of the earlier geographers. Kharbirt, or Kharput, is near the junction of the eastern Euphrates or river Arsan\u0101s, on which stream, but higher up, lay Shimsh\u0101t (see I.S. 57). Sams\u016bn was already a celebrated port for shipping on the Black Sea; \u2018Am\u016briyah (Amorium) still exists (Mustawfi, apparently by some error, states that the name was then pronounced Ank\u016briyah, which, as already noted, is Angora). K\u0101lik\u0101l\u0101 was a city in the country of this name, near the Armenian frontier (see I.S. 64), which has generally been identified with the Byzantine city of Theodosiopolis on the upper Euphrates, otherwise called Karin.\n\nKar\u0101 \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r\u2014\u2018Black Fort\u2019\u2014was the name of diverse castles, four of which were especially celebrated. One (apparently not marked in our maps) was on the mountains near Kaysariyah; another was of the district of K\u016bniyah (probably the Kar\u0101 \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r lying south-west of \u2018Am\u016briyah); a third castle of this name stood near Nikdah, while the fourth Kar\u0101 \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r is that lying a short distance north-east of \u0100\u1e33 Shahr and belonging to the Arzanj\u0101n district. Kastam\u016bniyah lies some distance west from Sams\u016bn; and K\u016bman\u0101t is one of the many towns called Comana by the Greeks. K\u016bniyah is the older Iconium; here the castle had been built by Sult\u0101n K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Arsl\u0101n of cut stone, and in like material great city walls were erected by \u2018Al\u0101\u02be-ad-D\u012bn Kay-Kub\u0101d the Salju\u1e33; K\u016bniyah further was celebrated for the tomb of the S\u016bf\u012b saint and poet Jal\u0101l-ad-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b.\n\nKaysariyah (Caesareia Mazaka) still exists, but K\u0101\u1e6d (or K\u0101b) is apparently not to be found on our maps. Kam\u0101kh (or Kamkh) on the Euphrates is well known (I.S. 48), and G\u00fcl is probably G\u00fcl \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r to the south-west of Ant\u0101kiyah, which was visited by Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah (ii, 269), but the double town called Kir and Bak\u012bj I am unable to identify. L\u016bl\u016bah is in the Cilician passes north-west of Tarsus, and Nikdah (or Nigdah) lies to the north of it. Malat\u012byah is Melitene near\nthe Euphrates (I.S. 48), and Niksar stands a short distance south-east of Samsun and Amasiyah.\n\nHushyar (which is not mentioned in the Jihan Num\u0101) is said to have been the Castle of Karaman, better known as Larandah, the capital of the Karaman province on the borders of Little Armenia. Yalkan Baz\u0101r (not marked on our maps) was a town between Kuniyah and Ak Shahr, celebrated for its hot springs; and Kir-Shahr, frequently mentioned by Ali of Yazd (ii, 418 and elsewhere), stands half-way between Ank\u016brah and Kay\u1e63ariyah. Zamand\u016b, Kaduk (or Kadul), and Tamar Aghach (or Tur Aghach) I am unable to identify, and the names do not occur in the Jihan Num\u0101. Ziyarat Baz\u0101r is possibly the town of Ziyarat to the south of Kharp\u016bt. Agrid\u016br is the town at the southern end of the lake of this name; it is mentioned by Ibn Bat\u016b\u1e6dah (ii, 266), also by Ali of Yazd (ii, 485). Kawak probably is the place of this name lying a short distance to the west of Sivas. Sivri Hisar is the well-known city, north of Amuriyah, to which, according to Ali of Yazd (ii, 448), Timur marched in six stages from Angora. Neither Kulamiyah (Colonia) nor Kastaki occurs in the Jihan Num\u0101, nor is either apparently to be found on the map, for both are said by Mustawfi to lie on the shore of the Black Sea.1 Kush Hisar, however, exists, standing to the south of Kastamuniyah, and Malankubiyah, which is referred to by Yakut (iv, 635), lies east of Kuniyah, and is the ancient Malacopeia.\n\n1 Kulamiyah of the Arab geographers is generally identified with Colonia, founded by Pompey as described by Procopius, which the Armenians call Agovendzor, or Goghonia, and which lies about 60 miles north-west of Kamkh. See Saint Martin, Memoire sur l'Arm\u00e9nie, i, 189.\nChapter 8. Armenia.\n\nContents: Akhl\u0101t, 164t; Ab\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6d (or Abt\u016bk) and Arj\u012bsh, 164v; Arm\u016bk, 164x; Al\u0101\u1e6d\u0101k, 164y; B\u0101rk\u012br\u012b, 164z; Bay\u0101n, 165b; Khar\u0101d\u012bn, 165c; Kh\u016bsh\u0101b, Jaramrast, and L\u016bkiy\u0101m\u0101t, 165d; Hang\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, 165e; Salam and \u2018Ayn, 165f; Kab\u016bd and Mal\u0101zgird, 165g; V\u0101n and Vast\u0101n, 165j; Val\u0101shgird, 165m.\n\nThe Arab geographers unfortunately afford us but meagre accounts of Armenia, and though \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd in his description of the campaigns of Timur enables us to identify some of the outstanding names, \u1e24\u0101jj\u012b Khalfah in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 proves of little service. Hence, out of the list, as given above, it has been only possible to identify a third of the places named.\n\n\u1e24amd-Allah remarks that this country is divided into Greater and Lesser Armenia; but that with Lesser Armenia (otherwise Cilicia), of which the capital was S\u012bs, he does not deal in detail, for this formed no part of \u012ar\u0101n. The great lake which is the central feature of the country, now called Lake V\u0101n, \u1e24amd-Allah describes (L. 226j) under the name of the Arj\u012bsh or Akhl\u0101t Lake, from what were then the two chief towns on its borders. It was celebrated for the fish called \u1e6cirr\u012bkh, with which its waters, that were salt, abounded. Our author also speaks of the modern G\u016bkchah Lake under the name of Buhayrah G\u016bkchah Tangiz, meaning in Turkish \u2018the Blue Lake\u2019 (L. 226k). It lay on the Adharbayj\u0101n frontier of Armenia, and its waters were sweet and good for drinking; the G\u016bkchah Tangiz is also frequently mentioned by \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd (\u1e92afar N\u0101mah, i, 414, 415; ii, 378).\n\nThe town of Akhl\u0101t, at the north-west corner of the V\u0101n Lake, was then the capital of Armenia and produced revenue to the amount of 50,500 d\u012bn\u0101rs (about \u00a312,500), and above Akhl\u0101t to the eastward rose the great mountain of K\u016bh Sib\u0101n, now called Sip\u0101n D\u0101gh (L. 205l). Neither Ab\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6d, \u2018a fine town,\u2019 nor Arm\u016bk is apparently marked on the map; but Arj\u012bsh is still found at the north-west end of the lake. Al\u0101\u1e6d\u0101k\nis described as a good pasture-ground, where Argh\u016bn Kh\u0101n had built himself a Saray or palace for his summer quarters; it is the mountainous region now known as Ala D\u0101gh to the north and north-east of the lake, and is frequently mentioned by \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd (I.S. 417, 421, 685); further, Timur kept his standing camp here during the Georgian campaigns. In the neighbourhood is the town of Band-M\u0101h\u012b (Fish Dam), one stage to the eastward of Arj\u012bsh (see Route xxv) on the Arj\u012bsh bay of Lake V\u0101n, Kh\u016bsh\u0101b lies at some distance to the south-east of the V\u0101n Lake.\n\nThe places named Bay\u0101n (or Nab\u0101r), Khar\u0101d\u012bn (Khar\u0101vin or Jaz\u0101v\u012bn), Jarimarast (Jarvar\u012bb or Harsarbat), L\u016bk\u012by\u0101m\u0101t (T\u016bm\u0101n\u0101t), Hang\u016bm\u0101b\u0101d, Salam (Shalam), \u2018Ayn, and Kab\u016bd, are none of them to be found in Y\u0101k\u016bt, though many of these names are copied into the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 418) without comment; they have apparently also disappeared from the map, and the readings are in most cases uncertain. Mal\u0101jzird lies on the upper course of the western Euphrates, due north of Lake V\u0101n: the city of V\u0101n itself is near the eastern end of the lake, and V\u0101st\u0101n lies on its southern shore. The exact position of Val\u0101shgird is doubtful; but Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 939) mentions a town of this name as situated near Akhl\u0101t, though none is now shown on the map.\n\nChapter 9.

Diyar-Rabi'ah is the south-eastern half of the province, with Mosul for capital; Diyar-Bakr being the north-western part, with Amid for its chief town. Mosul was the largest city of the Jazirah province; but Irbil (Arbela), to the eastward, standing half-way between the banks of the two Z\u0101bs, was a place of great importance. The Upper or Greater Z\u0101b rose in the mountains of Armenia and flowed down to join the Tigris at Hadithah\u00b9; while the Lower or Lesser Z\u0101b, called also Majn\u016bn, 'the mad river,' because of its swift current, rising also in Armenia joined the Tigris at the hill of Sinn (L. 214/). In many of the MSS.\u00b2 Arzan or Arzanah is next described, an important town standing on a left bank affluent of the Tigris, and its ruins still exist.\n\nAmid is the chief place of Diyar-Bakr (and the town is often called by the name of the province); it stands on the Tigris to the westward and higher up than the inflow of the Arzan river. The towns of B\u0101\u1e63aydah and B\u0101\u1e6darn\u016bh I am unable to identify\u00b3 (the latter name being variously given in the MSS. as B\u0101zarn\u016bkh, B\u0101tahb\u016bj, etc.), but from its position in the alphabetical order, the first syllable is apparently B\u0101\u2014the Syriac form of Bayt or Beth\u2014so common in the place-names of this region. Bartall\u0101 is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 567), and still exists about sixteen miles to the eastward of Mosul, but it is difficult to identify the town called J\u0101r or Jas\u0101r, and the reading is probably corrupt. Baw\u0101z\u012bj, though it has disappeared from the map, is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 750), and from his account we learn that it stood near the mouth of the Lower\n\n\u00b9 Not to be confounded with \u1e24adithah on the Euphrates, mentioned in Chapter 1.\n\u00b2 British Museum MSS., Add. 7,708, 16,737, and 23,543. Not to be confounded with Arzan-ar-R\u016bm, otherwise Erzerum. In the Zafar N\u0101mah (i, 665) the name is spelt Arzin.\n\u00b3 Unless for B\u0101\u1e63aydah we read B\u0101\u1e63abdhah, which might be merely another way of spelling B\u0101zabda (as the name is given by Y\u0101k\u016bt, i, 466), the well-known town on the eastern bank of the Tigris opposite Jazirah Ibn \u2018Omar, which had been the Roman fortress of Bozabda.\nZ\u0101b, and not far from the hill of Sinn. Jaz\u012brah Ibn \u2018Omar is a town on an island in the Tigris above Mosul (see I.S. 34), and \u1e24\u0101n\u012b, to the north of \u0100mid, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (ii, 188), was celebrated for its iron-mine. What place Sitw\u0101n or Siw\u0101n represents is not clear, but the reading is not improbably corrupt.\n\n\u1e24arr\u0101n, with its castle of cut stone, founded, it was said, by Arphaxad, son of Shem, lay near the sources of the river Balikh, which joined the Euphrates at Rakka\u1e25 (L. 219j). \u1e24i\u1e63n Kayf\u0101 is an important fortress on the Tigris, lying due south of Arzan (I.S. 264). Kh\u0101b\u016br is the name of some town on the Kh\u0101b\u016br river, on which stood R\u0101s-al-\u2018Ayn, and the Kh\u0101b\u016br river, after taking up the Hirm\u0101s, joined the Euphrates at Karkisiy\u0101, or Circesium. Rakka\u1e25, the ancient Callinicus, stands on the Euphrates, above the junction of the Balikh river (I.S. 50), near the famous battlefield of Siffin. Ruh\u0101, or Edessa, is described in many of the MSS., and some details are given of its wonderful churches. S\u0101\u2018ird (south of Bitlis) was famous for its manufacture of copper pots and cups. Sinjar stood on the mountain side overlooking the Tharth\u0101r river, this last being a branch stream from the Hirm\u0101s river, which, flowing eastward, joined the Tigris at Takrit (L. 219o).\n\nS\u016bk Tham\u0101nin\u2014\u2018Market of the Eighty\u2019\u2014records the settlement of that number of the companions of Noah when, according to Moslem tradition, the Ark came to rest on Jabal J\u016bd\u012b. This S\u016bk Tham\u0101nin is not found on the maps, but Mount J\u016bd\u012b is known, and in his Itinerary Mukaddas\u012b (p. 149) reports that this town lay one march distant (west) of Jaz\u012brah Ibn \u2018Omar, and Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 275) says that Tham\u0101nin lay to the north of \u2018Im\u0101diyah. \u2018Akr, signifying \u2018a castle,\u2019 constantly recurs in place-names; the castle here intended is doubtless \u2018Akr-al-Humaydiyah, mentioned also by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 696), which is marked on the map some thirty miles to the south-east of \u2018Im\u0101diyah. This last, a town of considerable size, is said by Mustawfi to have\n\n---\n\n1 Those cited above, and others.\ntaken its name from 'Im\u0101d-ad-Dawlah the Buyid (brother of Mu'izz-ad-Dawlah), who died in 338 (A.D. 949). According to Ibn-al-Ath\u012br (xi, 60), however, 'Im\u0101diyah had its name from 'Im\u0101d-ad-D\u012bn Zangi, Lord of Mosul, who had founded the town in 537 (A.D. 1142). Not far from 'Im\u0101diyah is Karmal\u012bs, of the Mosul district, also mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 267), which will be found to the south of Bartall\u0101h. Karkisiya stands on the Euphrates at the junction of the Kh\u0101b\u016br (I.S. 51). Mardin was famous for its castle, and the S\u016br river which irrigated its gardens flowed thence northward to join the Tigris (L. 219p). M\u016bsh stands near the upper waters of the Arsanas or eastern Euphrates, May\u0101farikayn lying south-west of it, and on a left bank affluent of the Tigris. Na\u1e63\u012bbin or Nisibis, celebrated for its roses and venomous scorpions, is on the Hirm\u0101s river, which forms the chief affluent of the Kh\u0101b\u016br (L. 219m); lastly, Nineveh (N\u012bnav\u012b), opposite Mosul on the Tigris, was famous for the shrine shown here of the prophet Y\u016bnus or Jonah.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. X.\u2014Vais\u0101li. By Vincent A. Smith, M.R.A.S., late of the Indian Civil Service.\n\nWhen discussing the position of Ku\u015binagara I was compelled by the necessity of avoiding undue prolixity to assume without proof the correctness of the current belief that the ancient and famous city of Vais\u0101li (Ves\u0101li) is now represented by the ruins at Bas\u0101r and the neighbouring villages in the Muzaffarpur District of North Bih\u0101r.\u00b9\n\nThe evidence in favour of the current belief was presented by Cunningham in such an unconvincing fashion that it was impossible for his readers to feel assured of the identity of Vais\u0101li and Bas\u0101r.\u00b2 At one time I felt doubts on the subject myself. Professor Rhys Davids has recently intimated his opinion that the site of Vais\u0101li is quite uncertain, while Dr. Hoey has felt at liberty to reject Cunningham's decision, and to propose the identification of Vais\u0101li with a place named Cherand in the Chapra or S\u0101ran District.\u00b3 Inasmuch as Dr. Hoey's ingenious arguments move on a plane different from that of mine, and seem to me wholly opposed to the evidence, I trust that I may be excused from criticizing them in detail. But the fact that doubts concerning the identification of Bas\u0101r with Vais\u0101li have been freely expressed is good reason for examining afresh the evidence which satisfied Cunningham, as well as any other available, and for forming a definite and well-considered judgment on the question at issue. In the following pages I propose to\n\n\u00b9 Ante, p. 143.\n\u00b2 Cunningham: Arch. S. Reports, i, 55, 56; xvi, 6.\n\u00b3 \"On the Identification of Kusinara, Vaisali, and other places mentioned by the Chinese pilgrims,\" by W. Hoey, Litt.D., I.C.S.: J.A.S.B., 1900, vol. lxix, pl. i, pp. 78, 83. Cherand stands on the northern bank of the Ganges, in approximately N. lat. 28\u00b0 41' and E. long. 84\u00b0 55', about seven miles south-east from Chapra.\nsubmit to impartial criticism and discussion all the known facts, and I venture to think that any reader who examines the case without prepossession will agree with me that Cunningham was right in his conclusion, although, as often happened, he failed to record the reasons for his opinion with sufficient detail and lucidity to compel the assent of his readers. I have no doubt whatever that Bas\u0101r and the adjoining villages occupy the site of the city of Vais\u0101li, and am further convinced that, while the limits of the city can even now be determined with a near approach to accuracy, a very moderate amount of local exploration, conducted under competent guidance, should result in the determination of the exact sites of many renowned monuments.\n\nThe village of Bas\u0101r (\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0930) stands in about N. lat. 25\u00b0 58' 20\" and E. long. 85\u00b0 11' 30\", twenty-six or twenty-seven miles in a direct line a little to the west of north from Patna, the ancient P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, and about twenty miles from H\u0101jipur on the northern bank of the Ganges opposite Patna. It is due north of the D\u012bgha Gh\u0101\u1e6d railway station on the Bengal and North-Western Railway.\n\nThe great mound or 'fort' at the village is known as the Fort of R\u0101ja Bis\u0101l (Vis\u0101l). The close correspondence of the name of this eponymous local chieftain with the city name of Vais\u0101li or Ves\u0101li is obvious, and, although not by itself conclusive evidence of identity, is of great weight as corroboration of other evidence.\u00b9\n\nWell-known Buddhist legends, which it seems unnecessary to repeat in detail, clearly imply that Vais\u0101li lay beyond the Ganges at a moderate distance in a northerly direction from P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, and on the road from that city to Kusin\u0101ra (Ku\u015binagara).\n\n\u00b9 The correct spelling is said to be Bas\u0101r (\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0930), but I believe that the spelling Bas\u0101rh (\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0939) is also permissible. The first syllable is certainly not Be-, \u092c\u0947, as it is written by Cunningham and Hoernle. The Indian Atlas (Sheet 102) spells the name as 'Busadh Puttee.' Bas\u0101r represents Vais\u0101li or Ves\u0101li more accurately than does the form Bas\u0101r. Cunningham (Reports, i, 56) erroneously places Bas\u0101r \"a little to the east of north from Patna.\" The mistake is probably due to a misprint.\nThe traditional account of Gautama Buddha's last journey relates that he travelled leisurely from P\u0101\u1e6daliputra to Vais\u0101li in three stages, halting twice on the way, first at Ko\u1e6digr\u0101ma and next at Nadiy\u0101gr\u0101ma. Travellers in India whose journey begins with the crossing of a great river are always glad to make their first halt as near as possible to the further bank of the river. The ancient town of H\u0101jipur (N. lat. 25\u00b0 40', E. long. 85\u00b0 18' 30\"), which stands on the eastern bank of the Gandak river and the northern bank of the Ganges at a distance in a direct line of six or seven miles from Patna, is still the first halting-place for the traveller proceeding north from Patna. We may be quite certain that Ko\u1e6digr\u0101ma, the first camping-ground of Buddha, was at or close to H\u0101jipur.\n\nL\u0101lganj, situated twelve miles from H\u0101jipur and eight from Basar, is now the principal village intermediate between those two places, and Nadiy\u0101gr\u0101ma should be looked for in the vicinity of L\u0101lganj. Careful local enquiry would probably find the names Ko\u1e6digr\u0101ma and Nadiy\u0101gr\u0101ma surviving in slightly modified forms, such as Ko\u1e6dg\u0101o and Nadiy\u0101o, but no such names are entered in the Indian Atlas, sheet No. 103.\n\nThe position of Basar at a distance of three easy marches north of Patna exactly agrees with the position of Vais\u0101li in relation to P\u0101\u1e6daliputra as described by Buddhist tradition.\n\nHiuen Tsiang places the st\u016bpa marking the locality of the orthodox Council or Convocation of Vais\u0101li at a spot two and a half miles (15 or 16 li) south-east from the city. At a distance of 15 or 16 miles (80 or 90 li) to the south of this st\u016bpa stood the splendid monastery of \u015avetapura, which marked the place where the s\u016btra called \"Bodhisattva-pitaka\" was supposed to have been revealed. A st\u016bpa, ascribed to A\u015boka, stood beside the monastery, and preserved the memory of the spot where Buddha, when going south to Magadha,\n\n---\n\n1 H\u0101jipur possesses an ancient fort dating from Hindu times, and the principal mosque stands on the site of earlier buildings. The ruins of a Hindu temple known as Mahai exist two miles to the north of the town. (Cunningham, Reports, xvi, 5.) A hoard of gold Gupta coins, ranging in date from about A.D. 320 to 400, was found in the bazaar in 1893. (Proc. A.S.B., March, 1894, p. 67.)\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nstopped to look back upon Vais\u0101li. The \u015avetapura monastery, therefore, stood on the road from Vais\u0101li to P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, at a distance of about 20 miles from the former city, and close to the river. Five or six miles (30 li) to the south-east of \u015avetapura a st\u016bpa on the northern bank of the Ganges marked the position of the ferry where, according to the legend, \u0100nanda divided his body, and gave half to the king of Magadha on the southern and half to the king of Vais\u0101li on the northern side of the river. A corresponding st\u016bpa stood on the southern bank. The ferry connected by legend with \u0100nanda was therefore 23 or 24 miles (2\u00bd+ 3 or 16-5 or 6) distant from Vais\u0101li in a direction slightly east of south, and, inasmuch as the Ganges then flowed a good deal farther to the north than it does now, the st\u016bpa marking the northern end of the ferry should be looked for near Mah\u0101sagar, about six miles south-east from H\u0101jipur. The st\u016bpa at the southern end of the ferry must have been some way by the river. The \u015avetapura monastery must have been near H\u0101jipur. Its \"massive towers,\" of which Hiuen Tsuang speaks, were probably wooden, but it is quite possible that careful search would succeed in tracing the substantial brick foundations on which those towers rested.\n\nThe position of Vais\u0101li in relation to \u015avetapura on the neck of the Ganges agrees accurately with the position of Kesariya in relation to the river.\u00b9\n\nHiuen Tsuang expressly states that Vais\u0101li lay on the road from Pataliputra to Nep\u0101l.\u00b2 Bas\u0101r lies on the ancient royal road from the capital to Nep\u0101l, marked by three of A\u015boka's pillars, which passed Kesariya, Lauriy\u0101-Ara\u1e47\u0101j, Betiya,\n\n\u00b9 Ibid., Records, ii, 74-77. The statement that the Bodhisattva-pitaka s\u016btra was revealed at \u015avetapura is taken from the \"Life of Hiuen Tsuang\" (p. 101), which defines the position of \u015avetapura by the rather obscure words: \"Leaving the southern borders of Vais\u0101li and following the Ganges river for 100 li or so (i.e. 24 miles), we came to the town of \u015avetapura.\" The Life, as M. Sylvain L\u00e9vi has pointed out, was written for edification, and is not to be depended on for geographical or topographical details. Many statements in the book are manifestly erroneous. The Records, on the other hand, the more they are tested, the more accurate they are proved to be.\n\n\u00b2 Ibid., ii, 81.\nLauri\u0101-Nandangarh, Ch\u0101nkigarh, and R\u0101mpurw\u0101, entering the hills by the Bhikn\u0101 Thori Pass. The jealousy of the existing Nepalese government compels the modern traveller to take a more easterly route and pass through Sigauli (Segowlee) in lat. 26\u00b0 44', long. 84\u00b0 47'.\u00b9\n\nTwo geographical tests of the identity of Bas\u0101r and Vais\u0101li having been proved satisfactory, I now proceed to apply a third test of the same kind.\n\nThe st\u016bpa near Kesariy\u0101, known by the name of R\u0101ja Ben Cakravart\u012b, is, as was explained in my discussion of the site of Ku\u015binagara, the spot erroneously described by F\u0101-hien as the scene of the Liechavi leave-taking, and correctly described by Hiuen Tsiang as the memorial of a Cakravartin R\u0101ja. Both pilgrims substantially agree in their estimate of the distance of this locality from Vais\u0101li, F\u0101-hien giving the round figure \"5 yojanas,\" equivalent to 38 miles,\u00b2 while the more accurate Hiuen Tsiang states the distance as being \"a little less than 200 li.\" Five yojanas being the exact equivalent of 200 li, the term \"a little less than 200 li\" may be fairly interpreted as equivalent to 4\u00bd yojanas, or 33 miles, which is the approximate marching distance between Bas\u0101r and Kesariy\u0101. Measured on the map (Sheets 102 and 103 of the Indian Atlas), the direct distance between Busadh Puttee (Bas\u0101r) and the \"hillock with temple\" south-west of Kesariy\u0101 village is about 30 miles. Consequently in relation to Kesariy\u0101 the correspondence in position between Bas\u0101r and Vais\u0101li is again proved to be perfect.\n\nF\u0101-hien states that \"the confluence of the five rivers,\" that is to say, of the Ganges, Son, Gh\u0101gr\u0101, Gandak, and some smaller stream not identified, was distant four yojanas, or about 30 miles, eastward from the st\u016bpa to the north of Vais\u0101li, which, according to his guides, marked the scene\n\n\u00b9 The ancient and modern routes can be traced on Sheets 102 and 103 of the Indian Atlas. No doubt in ancient times several passes into the valley of Nep\u0101l were open to the traveller. The royal route led to the Goramas\u0101n Pass, as well as to the Bhikn\u0101 Thori Pass, but the latter was probably that generally used.\n\n\u00b2 \"Five yojanas\" (Beal and Giles). The distance of \"ten yojanas\" stated in Legge's translation is out of the question.\nof the Buddhist Council or Convocation of Vais\u0101li. The river Ganges below the present junction with the Gandak opposite Patna has made a considerable move in a southerly direction, having in ancient times flowed much farther to the north. In those days the Son followed the present course of the Punpun and Murh\u0101r rivers, and joined the Ganges to the north of Phatu\u1e25\u0101 (Fatuh\u0101), about 10 miles east from Patna and about 25 miles east from the present point of junction. As long as the vast mass of water from the Son was thrown into the Ganges below Patna, the latter river was necessarily forced towards the north. When the mouth of the Son moved to the west, and the pressure from its waters was withdrawn, the Ganges naturally took a more southerly course. In F\u0101-hien\u2019s time P\u0101\u1e6daliputra stood in the tongue of land between the Ganges and the Son, but nearer to the latter river, and might be accurately described as situated on the bank of the Son. The old gh\u0101ts, or riverside stairs of the city, can still be traced along the bank of the ancient bed of the Son. The critic who merely glances at the modern map would suppose F\u0101-hien to be mistaken in describing A\u015boka\u2019s city of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra as being distant a yojana, or some seven miles, from the Ganges where he crossed at the confluence. But a knowledge of the changes in the courses of the rivers as explained above fully justifies the pilgrim\u2019s description, and explains his meaning without violence to his text. The confluence of the five rivers must have been situated near the villages named B\u0101z\u0101r and Gop\u0101lpur (I. A., sheet 103), which stand north of Fatuh\u0101, and about nine miles south-east from H\u0101jipur. The distance from those villages to the ruins of A\u015boka\u2019s city on the old course of the Son is about eight miles. F\u0101-hien when defining direction commonly uses the four cardinal points only. He therefore describes the confluence of the five rivers as being \u201cto the east\u201d from Vais\u0101li, and P\u0101\u1e6daliputra as being \u201csouth\u201d from the confluence. The true bearings are approximately south-east and south-west respectively.\n\nThe direct distance measured on the map from Baniy\u0101 (Buneean), situated north-west of Bas\u0101r, which approximately\nmarks the position of Fa-hien's \"convocation st\u016bpa,\" to B\u0101z\u0101r is 29\u00bd miles, or four yojanas as required. The distance from B\u0101z\u0101r to A\u015boka's city of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra being about eight miles, the city would have been in the dry season about a yojana from the southern bank of the river, as stated by the pilgrim. Thus, a fourth geographical test rigorously applied establishes the identity of Vais\u0101li with Bas\u0101r.\n\nIf my readers have had the patience to follow me so far, I trust that they will be satisfied that the remains at Bas\u0101r and the neighbouring villages beyond doubt occupy the site of the famous city Vais\u0101li. The identity of the site is established by the continuance of the name of Vais\u0101li in the forms Bas\u0101r (or Bas\u0101rh) and Bis\u0101l, as well as by the exact agreement in the positions of Bas\u0101r and Vais\u0101li on the old royal road from P\u0101\u1e6daliputra (Patna) to Nep\u0101l with reference to P\u0101\u1e6daliputra itself, to the course of the Ganges, to the Kesariy\u0101 st\u016bpa, and to \"the confluence of the five rivers.\"\n\nThe discussion of the topography of Vais\u0101li, on which I now propose to enter, will be found to strongly corroborate the geographical arguments set forth above.\n\nThe exact date of Hiuen Tsiang's visit to Vais\u0101li is not known, but the year 635 A.D. may be assumed as approximately the correct date. His description of the city is unusually detailed and precise, and enables the modern reader not only to form an accurate conception of the state of the ruins in the seventh century A.D., but also to mark on the map with a close approach to exactness the position of each monument described.\n\n1 Fa-hien, ch. xxvi, xxvii, in Legge's version. For the changes in the courses of the rivers see the discussion by Cunningham and Beglar in Reports, vol. viii, pp. v, vi, xi, 23, and plate i. Cunningham (pp. vi and xi, with a misprint at p. vi) cites Patanjali as mentioning \"P\u0101\u1e6daliputra on the Son,\" sonam P\u0101\u1e6daliputram. Patanjali is supposed to have lived about n.c. 150. I have myself seen the remains of the riverside stairs on the old bank of the Son near Bankipore. They were traced by Babu P. C. Mukherji for a distance of about 1,000 feet to the north of Nayatola, midway between Patna and Bankipore railway stations, and adjoining Kumrah\u0101r (also called Nema or Nima), the site of the Maurya palace.\nAt the time of the pilgrim's visit the city was to a great extent in ruins. The buildings were in a state of advanced decay, the forests had been uprooted, and the numerous lakes and ponds had shrunk into offensive swamps. The ruins covered a space about twelve miles (60 or 70 li) in circuit, and included the remains of hundreds of Buddhist monasteries, out of which only three or four were occupied by a few monks. The Jains (Nirgranthas) were numerous, as might naturally be expected, Vais\u0101li having been the birthplace of their religion; and Brahmanical Hindus of various sects worshipped at more than a score ('several tens') of temples. The citadel, or palace precinct, was less than a mile (4 or 5 li) in circuit, and was inhabited by a small population. This citadel is obviously represented by the mound now known as R\u0101ja Bis\u0101l\u2019s Fort (Bis\u0101lgarh), which retains the ancient name almost unaltered, and in dimensions exactly agrees with Hiuen Tsiang\u2019s description.\n\nA monastery tenanted by a few friars of the Sainmatiya school of the Hinay\u0101na stood about a mile (5 or 6 li) north-west of the citadel, and apparently within the city walls. Hiuen Tsiang specifies the position of most of the monuments mentioned by him with reference to this monastery, which was evidently his residence during his sojourn.\n\nClose to the monastery three st\u016bpas attracted the pilgrim\u2019s special attention. One of these commemorated the delivery of the Vimalakirtti S\u016btra and the presentation of precious parasols to Buddha. The second marked the spot where S\u0101riputra and others attained the rank of saint (arhat). The third, which stood at a short distance to the south-east, was the most interesting monument at Vais\u0101li, being the st\u016bpa which enshrined the share of the relics obtained by the\n\n---\n\n1 The fort is 1,680 feet in length from north to south, by 750 feet in width from east to west, and the circuit round the crest of the mound measures 4,660 feet (Cunningham, Reports, i, 55; xvi, 6), equivalent to about 5 li at the rate of 5\u00bd li to the mile. The extensive forest to the north of the city was still standing in Fa-hien\u2019s time, about A.D. 405, in the reign of Candra Gupta II. The final ruin of the city was probably due to the destructive wars with the White Huns half a century later.\nunnamed king of Vais\u0101li at the time of the cremation of the body of Gautama Buddha. This st\u016bpa, dating from about B.C. 500, will probably, when identified, prove to be similar to the monument at Pipr\u0101v\u0101, which enshrined the share of the relics obtained by the \u015a\u0101kyas of Kapilavastu.\n\nReference to the accompanying map will show that the S\u0101mat\u012bya monastery, the st\u016bpa containing the cremation relics, as well as the st\u016bpas of S\u0101riputra and the Vimalak\u012brtti S\u016btra, must all lie in a compact group (No. 1 on map) between the Kharon\u0101 tank and the village of Phar\u0101wal, where a large mound exists. B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji, when visiting Vais\u0101li, discerned that the cremation-relics st\u016bpa must be near Phar\u0101wal. It is astonishing that Sir Alexander Cunningham made no attempt to ascertain the position of this most interesting monument of the earliest period of Buddhism, which probably still contains the relics of Gautama. According to a legend told by Hiuen Tsiang, A\u015boka removed nine-tenths of the original deposit, leaving one-tenth behind. I have no doubt that careful survey, supplemented by intelligent excavation, will bring to light this st\u016bpa, which is almost certain to contain a valuable inscription.\n\nHaving visited and described the more conspicuous and interesting monuments close to the monastery where he lodged, which must all have been situated within the walls,\n\n---\n\n1 The exact date of the death of Gautama Buddha \u015a\u0101kyamuni is not known, and is probably unascertainable. The Ceylonese date, B.C. 543, which has been treated with undue respect, appears to be a little too early. If the figures 256 in A\u015boka\u2019s Minor Rock Edicts express a date, they indicate that A\u015boka believed Gautama to have died in or about B.C. 508. As an approximate round figure, B.C. 500 may be considered correct. As to the authenticity of the Pipr\u0101v\u0101 relics, see Professor Rhys Davids\u2019 paper \u201cA\u015boka and the Buddha-relics\u201d in J.R.A.S., July, 1901, p. 398.\n\n2 My map is based on a tracing of plate ii in vol. xvi of Cunningham\u2019s Reports. The scale of Cunningham\u2019s map is really the same as that of mine, but is misprinted. Some details are taken from his earlier, and apparently less correct, plate xxi in vol. i of the same series. The additions made by me are supported by my interpretation of the Chinese pilgrims\u2019 texts, and by some notes supplied by B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji, who visited the locality in November, 1897, on behalf of the Government of Bengal. His notes, although too crude for publication as a whole, contain valuable matter. The position of Chak R\u0101md\u0101s is misrepresented in the map in Reports, xvi. This hamlet is really contiguous to Baniya, from which it is divided by a narrow passage. (Ibid., 91.)\nHiuen Tsiang turned towards the north-west, where he found a distinct group of holy places (No. 7 of map). He observed a st\u016bpa built by A\u015boka, beside which stood a stone pillar 50 or 60 feet high, surmounted by the figure of a lion. To the south of the pillar was a tank, which, according to the legend, was dug by monkeys for the use of Buddha, and two st\u016bpas to the south of the tank marked the spots where the monkeys gathered honey and offered it. The pilgrim notes that a figure of a monkey still stood in the north-western corner of the tank.\n\nHis description of these monuments is strictly applicable to the remains situated on a low mound one mile south-east of Bakhir\u0101 village and about two miles north-west of Bis\u0101lg\u0101r\u1e25, the fort of Bas\u0101r. A\u015boka\u2019s pillar with its lion-capital complete is still standing. Its height from the water-level is known to be 44 feet 2 inches, and several feet are submerged. The total height, therefore, closely agrees with Hiuen Tsiang\u2019s estimate. A ruined st\u016bpa of solid brick due north of the pillar is evidently that erected by A\u015boka. The tank to the south of the pillar, measuring about 200 feet in length from east to west and 150 feet in width from north to south, agrees exactly in position with that connected by Hiuen Tsiang with the legend of the pious monkeys who offered honey to Buddha. Small mounds to the south of the tank seem to represent the st\u016bpas which commemorated the monkeys\u2019 piety. A life-size statue of Buddha, with an inscription, considered by Cunningham to date from the tenth century, was found in the ruins of a temple about 720 feet north of the st\u016bpa, and Lieut.-Colonel Waddell observed on the pedestal of a similar statue, or perhaps the same one, a representation of the monkey legend. No hesitation, I think, need be felt in accepting Cunningham\u2019s identification of the remains south-east of Bakhira with the group of ruins described by Hiuen Tsiang as lying to the north-west of the Sammatiya monastery.\n\nI may observe in passing that the legend of the presentation of a pot of honey to Buddha by a monkey,\nor company of monkeys, is often represented in sculpture, and was localized at Mathur\u0101 as well as at Vais\u0101li.\\(^1\\)\n\nI am unable to agree with Cunningham (i, 56) that the city of Vais\u0101li, strictly so called, included the Monkey Tank group of ruins and Bakhira village. Attentive consideration of the testimony of F\u0101-hien and Hiuen Tsiang permits no doubt that both Bakhira and the Monkey Tank group of ruins fall outside the line of the ancient walls. The Kut\u0101g\u0101ra, or \u2018upper-storied,\u2019 hall, where Buddha dwelt during the fifth year of his ministry, was situated in the precincts of the Mah\u0101vana Vih\u0101ra, or monastery of the great forest, and on the bank of, or close to, the Monkey Tank. F\u0101-hien informs us that the great forest, or Mah\u0101vana, lay to the north of the city, and that the \u201cdouble-galleried vih\u0101ra\u201d where Buddha dwelt (i.e. the Kut\u0101g\u0101ra) was in that forest. But inasmuch as the \u201cdouble-galleried vih\u0101ra\u201d adjoined the Monkey Tank, that tank also must have been within the forest and without the city. The \u201cst\u016bpa of the last look,\u201d which will be mentioned presently, stood outside the western gate, and it is impossible to locate this st\u016bpa if Bakhira be considered part of the city. The village of Kollu\u0101, or Kolhu\u0101, which is unfortunately not marked on the maps accessible to me, is close to the Monkey Tank, and probably represents the ancient suburb Koll\u0101ga. The Monkey Tank group of remains may properly be regarded as forming part of that suburb. The site of Bakhira village lay, I should think, quite clear of the city.\\(^2\\) It is, however,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cunningham: *Reports*, i, 56, 58\u201363; xvi, 12\u201316. The distance of the temple from the st\u016bpa is given in the text as stated in *Reports*, xvi, 16; in ibid., i, 61, the distance is stated to be 500 feet. The existence of the mediaeval statue may be explained by the well-known devotion of the P\u0101la kings to Buddhism. Lieutenant-Colonel Waddell\u2019s observation was communicated to me by letter. For the Mathur\u0101 variant of the monkey legend, see Beal, i, 182. Hiuen Tsiang was not disturbed by the duplication of the story.\n\n\\(^2\\) F\u0101-hien, ch. xxv (Legge); Turnour in *J.A.S.B.* for 1838, pp. 790 and 1,200; Burnouf, *Introduction*, p. 74. The last two references are given by Cunningham, and I have not verified them. As to Kolhu\u0101, Cunningham (xvi, 12) writes: \u201cNear the village of Kolhu\u0101, 2 miles to the north-west of Bes\u0101r\u1e25, and 1 mile to the south-east of the village of Bakhra, stands the massive stone pillar known as the Bakhra l\u0101\u1e6d, or monolith.\u201d In my map I have, therefore, inserted Kollu\u0101 as north of the Monkey Tank. B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji spells the name of the village as Kollu\u0101, and states that there is a large mound on the eastern side.\nquite possible that when Hiuen Tsiang estimated the circuit of the \"old foundations\" of the ruined city as measuring some twelve miles (60 or 70 li), he meant to include the Monkey Tank group of monuments. Excluding that group, the periphery of the walled city, as will presently be explained, seems to have amounted to about ten miles only.\n\nThe third group of monuments (No. 2 on map), described in detail by Hiuen Tsiang, consisted of four buildings distant more than half a mile (3 or 4 li) in a north-easterly direction from his temporary residence at the Sammatiya monastery. A st\u016bpa marked the reputed site of the house where the convert Vimalak\u012brti had lived, and close by a so-called \"spirit-dwelling in shape like a pile of bricks\" preserved the memory of the spot where he had preached. A second st\u016bpa commemorated the residence of Ratn\u0101kara (? Ratnak\u016bta), and a third monument of the same kind occupied the site of the residence of the celebrated courtezan \u0100mrap\u0101li, whose hospitality Buddha had not disdained to accept. The aunt of Buddha and other nuns were believed to have attained Nirv\u0101\u1e47a at this spot. The monuments included in this group must have been situated at or close to the site of the hamlet, now called Chak Abor\u0101. It seems to be possible that this name may preserve that of \u0100mba- or \u0100mrap\u0101li. \u0100mbapura might easily pass into Abaura or Abora.\u00b9 This group of monuments was evidently inside the city walls.\n\nThe fourth group of buildings selected by Hiuen Taiang for special notice is described by him with reference to a st\u016bpa (No. 3 on map) situated to the north of the monastery where he lodged at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile (3 or 4 li). This st\u016bpa, which evidently was inside the walls, marked the spot where Buddha, attended by a crowd of men and angels, was believed to have halted for a moment before he passed out by the western gate on his long journey to Kusin\u0101ra and to death. At a short distance to the north-west of this st\u016bpa, a similar\n\n\u00b9 The name is given as Abora in Reports, xvi, pl. ii, and as Aboha in ibid., i, pl. xxi. The latter form is probably a misprint.\nmonument, outside the walls (No. 4 on map), recalled the memory of the long, last look which the Master took at the city where he had dwelt so long.\n\nA little way to the south of this st\u016bpa of the last look, Hiuen Tsiang was shown a vih\u0101ra and a st\u016bpa said to mark the site of the garden presented to Buddha by \u0100mrap\u0101li. The two last-named monuments may possibly have been inside the walls, because F\u0101-hien explicitly records that \"inside the city the woman \u0100mrap\u0101li built a vih\u0101ra in honour of Buddha, which is now standing as it was at first.\" As to the position of the garden, Hiuen Tsiang seems to have been misinformed. F\u0101-hien correctly places it to the south of the city on the west side of the road from P\u0101\u1e6daliputra.\n\nAnother st\u016bpa, near the site shown as that of the garden to Hiuen Tsiang, commemorated, according to his guides, the spot where Buddha announced his approaching dissolution to his attendant \u0100nanda.\n\nYet another st\u016bpa, not far off, marked the spot where, according to a wild legend, \"the thousand sons beheld their father and their mother.\" F\u0101-hien relates a variant of this fantastic legend, which belongs to the J\u0101taka cycle, and gives the st\u016bpa the quaint name of \"bows and weapons laid down.\" He fixes its position as being three li, say a thousand yards, to the north-west of the city. Close by a st\u016bpa had been erected on the spot where Buddha had expounded the meaning of the J\u0101taka legend of the thousand sons.\n\nFurther to the east were the ruins of the \"turretted preaching hall, where Buddha uttered the Samantamukha dh\u0101ra\u1e47i and other s\u016btras.\" This hall is the \"double-galleried vih\u0101ra where Buddha dwelt\" in the great forest north of the city as described by F\u0101-hien, near which stood the st\u016bpa built by the Licchavis over their half of the body of \u0100nanda. This st\u016bpa, according to Hiuen Tsiang, was \"by the side of the preaching hall, and not far from it.\" The same hall is described in other books as the Ku\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ra on the bank of the Monkey Tank, and we are thus able to check and combine the topographical indications given by the two\npilgrims, and to fix the approximate position of each building described.\n\nF\u0101-hien supplies another and important datum by the statement that the st\u016bpa which commemorated the site of the Council of Vais\u0101li stood three or four li, say 1,000 to 1,200 yards, eastward from the st\u016bpa of \"bows and weapons laid down.\" He also tells us that the st\u016bpa standing on the spot where Buddha foretold his approaching dissolution was \"by the side\" of the \"bows and weapons laid down\" monument. In this detail he differs from Hiuen Tsiang.\n\nB\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji is very probably right in locating the site of the Ku\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ra to the north-east of the A\u015boka pillar, \"where the field is comparatively high, and where some years ago the local zemind\u0101r excavated hundreds of cartloads of bricks, which he carried to Bakhir\u0101 to build his house\" (No. 6 on map). The scene of the Council of Vais\u0101li, according to F\u0101-hien's guides, must have been close to the Ku\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ra, and the st\u016bpa over the half body of \u0100nanda should be looked for in the same group of ruins.\n\nThe st\u016bpa of the \"thousand sons,\" or \"bows and weapons laid down,\" and the adjoining st\u016bpa marking the spot where Buddha, according to F\u0101-hien, foretold his death, which were about 1,000 yards west of the Ku\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ra, must be represented by the \"two high conical mounds half a mile to the west of the pillar\" known locally either as \"Bh\u012bm Sen's baskets\" (pall\u0101), or as \"R\u0101ja Bis\u0101l's battery\" (morca, No. 5 on map). These two st\u016bpas, according to the testimony both of Cunningham and B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji, are constructed of earth without bricks, and are used as a quarry by the L\u016bniyas, or saltpetre-makers. They are, no doubt, of very early date.\n\nIt is interesting to observe that in two cases the distinct statements of the two Chinese pilgrims differ so irreconcilably that they can be explained only by the assumption that their guides showed them different sites under the same names. F\u0101-hien places the garden of \u0100mrap\u0101l\u012b where we should expect to find it, a little to the south of the city, and he adds that it was situated to the west of the road from P\u0101taliputra.\nHe does not mention any st\u016bpa or monument as marking the site. Hiuen Tsiang was shown a st\u016bpa on the alleged site of the garden, which he places a short distance to the south of the \"st\u016bpa of the last look\" (No. 4 of map), and consequently to the west of the city.\n\nA more important discrepancy concerns the locality of the famous Council of Vais\u0101li, which Hiuen Tsiang places about 2\u00bd miles to the south-east of the city. He says that the site was marked by a \"great st\u016bpa,\" of which careful exploration will probably disclose remains, although Cunningham's hasty researches failed to find them. I have not the slightest doubt that Hiuen Tsiang saw the \"great st\u016bpa,\" and that his guides told him that it marked the locality where the Council was held.\n\nFa-hien, with much greater probability, locates the Council st\u016bpa close to the Ku\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ra, or \"double-galleried vih\u0101ra where Buddha dwelt,\" and 3 or 4 li east from the st\u016bpa of \"bows and weapons laid down,\" or the \"st\u016bpa of the 1,000 sons,\" as it is called by Hiuen Tsiang. The site of the Council hall was therefore, according to the information given to the earlier pilgrim, close to the A\u015boka pillar, which was probably erected there for that reason. A council or synod of some sort was doubtless really held at Vais\u0101li, although the accounts which profess to give its date and the details of the proceedings are hopelessly contradictory and incredible.\u00b9\n\nThe fact that the two pilgrims were shown totally irreconcilable sites for the garden of \u0100r\u1e47ap\u0101li and the Council of Vais\u0101li is of importance, and should be borne in mind during discussions of the authenticity of the sites described by them. Pious visitors to the Holy Land of Buddhism, like Christian pilgrims in Palestine, were, of course, completely at the mercy of their guides, and were obliged to accept what they were told, and they were not always told the same thing. I have proved, or believe myself to have proved, that a similar discrepancy exists\n\n\u00b9 See my paper on \"The Identity of Piyadasi (Priyadar\u015bin) with A\u015boka Maurya, and some connected problems,\" in this Journal for October, 1901.\nbetween the statements of Fa-hien and Hiuen Tsiang concerning the site of Kapilavastu. The Kapilavastu of Fa-hien is represented by the ruins at Pipr\u0101v\u0101, 9 miles from the Lumbini Garden, whereas the Kapilavastu shown to Hiuen Tsiang is represented by the walled enclosure of Tilaur\u0101 Ko\u1e6d and the surrounding ruins, distant about 15 miles from the Lumbini Garden.\n\nIn all the three observed cases of clear discrepancy I believe that the earlier pilgrim, Fa-hien, is right; that is to say, that the genuine sites were shown to him, whereas when Hiuen Tsiang made his pilgrimage some 230 years later, the legends had been shifted to fictitious sites. I cannot add to the length of this already long essay by discussing the possible or probable causes of the shifting, and content myself with noting that Dr. Stein has recently pointed out that sacred sites can be, and often are, completely forgotten. Sites, the true position of which has been forgotten, can be easily changed. Dr. Burgess also has shown how freely the Burmese priests, in their anxiety to localize sacred legends, have invented a system of fictitious geography.\n\nA few words are necessary to explain the principles on which I have endeavoured to determine the approximate limits of the ancient city.\n\nAccording to Jain tradition, Vais\u0101li consisted of three distinct portions, Vais\u0101li proper, Kundag\u0101ma, and V\u0101niyag\u0101ma, besides the Koll\u0101ga suburb. Vais\u0101li proper has been sufficiently identified as being represented by Bis\u0101lgarh and an indeterminate portion of the other extensive ruins. The village of Baniy\u0101 (with the adjacent Chak R\u0101md\u0101s) is almost certainly the representative of V\u0101niyag\u0101ma. The lands of the village contain \"extensive mounds,\" and some ten years ago two statues of Jain T\u012brtha\u1e45karas, one seated,\n\n---\n\n1 \"A Report on a Tour of Exploration of the Antiquities in the Tarai, Nep\u0101l, the Region of Kapilavastu, during February and March, 1899,\" by B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji, with a Prefatory Note by Vincent A. Smith; being No. xxvi, pt. 1, of the Imperial Series of Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India; Calcutta, 1901. I refer especially to pp. 10 and 21 of my Prefatory Note.\n\n2 Indian Antiquary, vol. xix (1901), p. 95.\n\n3 Ibid., p. 387.\nthe other standing, were discovered about eight feet below the surface, and 500 yards west of the village. V\u0101niyag\u0101ma was the residence of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, the great prophet of the Jains, and this discovery of Jain images strongly confirms the identification suggested by the name. The hamlet of Bodh\u0101 also possesses a mound of ruins. The western boundary must run to the west of Baniy\u0101, nearly as I have drawn it. B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji was told by a resident Brahman, that the principal angles of the ancient walls were marked by images of the four-faced (chaumukhi) Mah\u0101d\u0113o, and was shown one of these images buried under the embankment of a large tank, about half a mile south-east of Bas\u0101r. This image probably marks the eastern extremity of the line of the southern wall. The B\u0101b\u016b says that he found distinct traces of a rampart both to the west and north of it. I have, therefore, drawn the eastern wall as extending in a straight line to another similar image which exists some four feet below the surface, near B\u0113nipur. A third Mah\u0101d\u0113o of the same kind is enshrined in a modern temple north-east of Baniy\u0101, and is probably near its original position. A fourth Mah\u0101d\u0113o is said to have formerly stood at Dhar\u0101r\u0101 at the south-west corner of the fort, but that one, of course, cannot have been on the city wall in that position. The northern portion of the city must have included the mounds of Phara\u1e47wal village, Chak Abora, where the house of \u0100mrap\u0101l\u012b is located, and Chak Bi\u1e63anpur. The suburb of Koll\u0101ga is probably represented by the village of Kollu\u0101 and the group of A\u015boka ruins, which must have been without the walls. The boundary at the north-western corner of the city is uncertain; it has been contracted in my map in order to agree with the traditional accounts of Buddha\u2019s last journey.\n\nThe result is a city ten miles in circuit, which agrees with the popular local estimate of five kos, but is somewhat smaller than Hiuen Tsiang\u2019s estimate of twelve miles, which may have included the Koll\u0101ga suburb.\n\nThe foregoing discussion will, I hope, have convinced my readers that Professor Rhys Davids carries scepticism rather\nVAIS\u0100LI.\n\nNor when he suggests that nobody knows the site of Vais\u0101li. \"It must,\" he writes, \"have been a great and flourishing place. But, though different guesses have been made as to its site, no one of them has yet been proved to be true by excavation. It was somewhere in Tirhut; and just three leagues, or say 23 miles, north of the Ganges, at a spot five leagues, say 38 miles, from R\u0101jagaha.\"\u00b9\n\nThe distance of the city from the river, as stated by the P\u0101li writer, is sufficiently correct; but, if the words \"at a spot\" refer to the position of Vais\u0101li, and not to a point on the bank of the Ganges, the alleged distance from R\u0101jagaha is little more than half of the true distance. R\u0101jgir, the site of R\u0101jagaha, is 40 miles distant in a straight line from Patna (P\u0101taliputra) on the south side of the river, and the marching distance from R\u0101jgir to Bas\u0101r (Vais\u0101li), through Patna and across the river, must slightly exceed 70 miles. The distance from R\u0101jagaha to Vais\u0101li was therefore approximately ten, not five, yojanas or leagues of more than seven miles each. If the words \"at a spot\" refer to a point on the bank of the Ganges, the statement of the P\u0101li author is approximately correct. The statements in the P\u0101li books of distances expressed in yojanas are often so discrepant, and so far invalidated by doubts as to the value of the yojana used, that they are generally of little practical use.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Journal of the P\u0101li Text Society for 1897-1901, p. 79. For the distances stated Professor Rhys Davids refers to \"Dhammapala on S.N. 2. 1.\"\n\n\u00b2 The best published discussion of the value of the yojana is that given by Professor Rhys Davids in \"Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon,\" pp. 15-17. He finds that the yojana used by F\u0101-hien was approximately equal to 7\u00bd miles, and with this finding I agree. Both the Chinese pilgrims reckoned 40 li to the yojana, and their li, therefore, is equivalent to about 3\u00be of a mile, or, in other words, 5\u00bc li go to the mile. Cunningham reckoned 6 li to the mile. The modern Chinese li is about one-third of a mile. Gibbon, with his usual accuracy, did not fail to perceive the lower value of the ancient li. \"According to the present standard,\" he observes, \"200 li (or, more accurately, 193) are equal to one degree of latitude; and one English mile consequently exceeds three miles of China. But there are strong reasons to believe that the ancient li scarcely equalled one half of the modern.\" (Note to ch. xxvi.)\n\nHuen Tsung records the fact that the yojana had three values, namely:\n\n(1) According to the old accounts, 40 li;\n(2) According to the common reckoning in India, 30 li; and\n(3) In the sacred books, 16 li (Beal, i, 70).\n\nHuen Tsung's measurements in li, when compared with F\u0101-hien's in yojanas,\nThe vague and contradictory estimates of distance given in the Buddhist sacred books cannot, so far as I can see, be made by any amount of cross-questioning to disclose the site of Vais\u0101li, which, however, is now established, as I venture to think, without any room for reasonable doubt, even in the absence of the test by systematic excavation and survey.\n\nNo site in India calls more loudly for such excavation and survey. It is far more promising than the site of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra. Most of the remains of that famous capital lie, as I have seen, buried fifteen or twenty feet below the present surface, and it is practically impossible to explore them. The city of Patna, the civil station of Bankipore, the East Indian Railway, and sundry villages and high roads, all lie over P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, and cannot be dug up by archaeologists.\n\nThe site of Vais\u0101li, on the contrary, is in open country, always give a value of 40 li for the yojana. I have not noticed in any book a clear example of the yojana containing only 30 li, equivalent to 5\u00bd miles. But examples of the yojana of the value of three miles, containing only 16 li, or an equivalent Indian measure, seem to occur in 'the sacred books.' The following quotations are from Spence Hardy's \"Manual of Buddhism,\" 2nd ed. Hardy drew his information from P\u0101li authorities.\n\nThe distance from Kapilavastu to Anoma river, according to him, was 480 'miles,' and from the same river to R\u0101jag\u1e5bha the distance was equal. Hardy's 'mile' seems to be the sixteenth of a yojana, and the two distances stated would be 30 yojanas each (pp. 164, 165). This interpretation is fully justified by the statement (p. 204) that when Buddha commenced his journey he proceeded each day sixteen 'miles,' and accomplished the distance of 60 yojanas between R\u0101jag\u1e5bha and Kapilavastu in two months, that is to say, in sixty days he travelled sixty yojanas of 16 'miles,' or li, each. He is, therefore, alleged to have moved at the very leisurely rate of 3 English miles a day. But, even if the yojana be taken at this minimum value of 3 miles, the total distance as stated of 180 miles (60 \u00d7 3) between R\u0101jag\u1e5bha and Kapilavastu is not nearly correct. The position of R\u0101jag\u1e5bha is certain, and Kapilavastu stood a few miles westward from Rummindei, the certain site of the Lumbini Garden. The direct distance from R\u0101jag\u1e5bha to Kapilavastu is about 225, and the marching distance about 250 miles. The estimate of 60 yojanas cannot be reconciled with any of the known values of the yojana.\n\nThe distance between R\u0101jag\u1e5bha and \u015ar\u0101vasti is stated to be 45 yojanas, or 45 days' journey for Buddha (ibid., pp. 224, 225). But the site of \u015ar\u0101vasti is nearly 100 miles further from R\u0101jag\u1e5bha than is Kapilavastu, the distance from which place to R\u0101jag\u1e5bha is stated as 60 yojanas.\n\nFrom \u015ar\u0101vasti to Vais\u0101li the distance is said (p. 291) to be 54 yojanas, and the distance from Kapilavastu to Vais\u0101li (p. 354) is given as 49 yojanas; whereas the distance from \u015ar\u0101vasti to Kapilavastu is known to have been 12\u00bd long yojanas, equivalent to 500 li. From such figures it is difficult to deduce any valuable result.\nat a considerable distance from the great rivers or any town, and has not been extensively built upon. The slight expansion which has been effected has been concerned only with a few of the Buddhist holy places. The pre-Buddhist and Jain associations of the place, which give it such a special interest, have been almost ignored.\n\nAt the very dawn of Indian history we catch glimpses of Vais\u0101li as a splendid city, the capital of the proud and wealthy Licchavi clan. The religious ferment which so deeply moved the hearts of the dwellers in the Gangetic valley during the sixth century B.C. seems to have centred in Vais\u0101li.\n\nVardham\u0101na, surnamed Mah\u0101v\u012bra, who erected the fabric of the Jain system upon the foundation laid by P\u0101r\u015bvan\u0101tha, was a noble of Vais\u0101li, a member of the N\u0101ta or N\u0101ya clan of K\u1e63atriyas who dwelt in the suburb Koll\u0101ga, which is probably now represented by the village situated close to the Monkey Tank called Kollu\u0101 or Kolhu\u0101, on the eastern side of which a large mound exists. In Cunningham's time Jain history and antiquities had not attracted the general attention of scholars, and the great opportunities offered by a study of the remains at Vais\u0101li for the elucidation of the story of the rise and progress of Jainism were not utilized. The position of Kollu\u0101 is not even marked on either of Cunningham's maps, and its identifications with Koll\u0101ga cannot yet be treated as an absolute certainty. I understand that the village lies to the north-east of Baniy\u0101, between Vais\u0101li (Bas\u0101\u1e5b) and Bakhir\u0101.\n\nV\u0101niyag\u0101ma, the mercantile quarter of the city, may be confidently, for reasons already stated, identified with Baniy\u0101 village. Exploration of the Baniy\u0101 and Kollu\u0101 sites should yield materials for the study of Jain history little inferior in interest to the discoveries in Buddhist lore which may\n\n---\n\n1 A convenient summary of the Jain traditions, with references to the original authorities, will be found in Dr. Hoernle's masterly address delivered to the Asiatic Society of Bengal on the 2nd February, 1898. As an indication of the early pre-eminence of Vais\u0101li, see the curious story about \"the water of the tank in Ves\u0101li City where the families of the kings get water for the ceremonial sprinkling,\" in J\u0101taka No. 465, the Bhadda-S\u0101la (Rouse, transl. iv, 94).\nconfidently be expected from the same localities or others immediately adjoining. I expect that Jain and Buddhist monuments will be found intermingled, and that considerable difficulty may be experienced in distinguishing them, because the Jains and Buddhists alike built st\u016bpas, st\u016bpa railings, and tora\u1e47a gateways, and to a large extent used the same symbolism.\n\nKu\u1e47\u1e0dag\u0101ma, the Brahman section of Vais\u0101li, may be represented by the hamlet called Basuku\u1e47\u1e0d, but the identification must at present remain doubtful.\n\nAt one time there was reason to suppose that I might be in a position to attempt a solution of the many problems in the ancient history of India on which light would probably be thrown by the systematic survey and exploration of the Vais\u0101li site; but, as that cannot be, I have written this paper in order that it may serve as a rough guide to other enquirers; and I trust that the official advisers in archaeological matters to the Governments of India and Bengal may be induced by the perusal of these imperfect and tentative notes of mine to undertake the adequate exploration of the rich field which lies ready before them.\n\nI understand that the Government of India, as at present constituted, is disposed to rely largely on private effort for the work of archaeological research as distinguished from that of conservation. If that opinion should be acted on, the results are likely to be disastrous. Private enterprise cannot deal with the gigantic task of Indian archaeological exploration. Even the resources of the Government can effect but little compared with the vast amount of work remaining to be done, but intelligent official direction by competent persons can secure at least that wanton destruction be not wrought in the name of science, whereas unsystematic\n\n---\n\n1 The full proof of this proposition will be found in my work entitled \"The Jain St\u016bpas and other Antiquities of Mathur\u0101,\" now in the press, which will be published as volume xx of the Imperial Series of Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India. Dr. F\u00fchrer left behind him a series of valuable plates depicting the Jain remains at Mathur\u0101, to which I have added a brief descriptive commentary.\nprivate enterprises will ordinarily in the future, as in the past, destroy more than they discover.\\(^1\\)\n\nProfessor Rhys Davids is not far wrong when he writes that \"the archaeology of India is, at present, almost an unworked field.\"\\(^2\\) I need hardly add that the enunciation of this dictum does not imply either on his part or on mine any failure to appreciate the high value of many of the researches conducted by a long line of learned scholars and enthusiastic explorers. It means, I apprehend, that earnest students of Indian archaeology are the persons most sensible of the very small proportion borne by the work properly done to that which remains undone.\n\n\\(^1\\) The prospectus of the India Exploration Fund fully recognizes the special interest attaching to the Vais\u0101li site. If that Fund should ever come into being it will, so far as I understand, simply result in a small cash contribution to the Archaeological Department of the Government of India for expenditure on work selected by the managers of the Fund.\n\n\\(^2\\) Journal of the P\u0101li Text Society, 1901, p. 79.\nART. XI.\u2014Abu'l-'Al\u0101 al-Ma'arri's Correspondence on Vegetarianism. By D. S. Margoliouth.\n\nIt has already been mentioned\u00b9 that, according to \u1e62af\u0101d\u012b, a correspondence on Vegetarianism between Abu'l-'Al\u0101 and a certain Hibat Allah Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, due to a line in the former's Luz\u016bmiyy\u0101t, was excerpted by Y\u0101k\u016bt. The first volume of Y\u0101k\u016bt's precious Dictionary of Litt\u00e9rateurs is in the Bodleian Library,\u00b2 soon, I hope, to be published with such other volumes of it as can be found. Y\u0101k\u016bt, whose acquaintance with literary history was unique, tells us that a passage in the Falak al-Ma't\u0101ni of Ibn al-Habb\u0101riyyah\u00b3 had roused in him the desire to get at this correspondence, which he reproduces in an abridged form. Abu'l-'Al\u0101's correspondent was a man of some importance, whose grave was still shown in Makrizi's time in Cairo,\u2074 where he held the post of Chief Missionary. The fact that Abu'l-'Al\u0101 addresses him with the titles ra'is and ajall shows that he held this or some similar post at the time of the\n\n\u00b9 Letters of Abu'l-'Al\u0101, ed. D. S. M., p. xxxix.\n\u00b2 Bodl. Or. 753.\n\u00b3 Ibn al-Habb\u0101riyyah appears to have been much interested in Abu'l-'Al\u0101. \u1e62af\u0101d\u012b (Comm. on L\u0101miyyat al-'Ajam, Cairo, 1305, ii, 189-191) gives a long quotation from a Ris\u0101lah written by him to Al-Ust\u0101dh al-Kha\u1e6d\u012br\u012b Abu Mans\u016br, in which an allusion is made (p. 190, med.) to Abu'l-'Al\u0101's kufr and ilh\u0101d. \u1e62af\u0101d\u012b was acquainted with the published collection of Abu'l-'Al\u0101's Letters: he quotes them, ii, 102 and i, 112. In ii, 198, there is an epigram containing an allusion to the \u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646, of which Mr. Nicholson has given such an interesting account in this Journal:\n\n\u0642\u062f \u0632\u0631\u062a \u0642\u0628\u0631 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0637\u064a * \u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u062a\u064a\u062a \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0646\n\u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0625\u0646\u0647 * \u064a\u0628\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\n\nThe author was 'Al\u0101 al-d\u012bn al-Wad\u0101'\u012b: he visited Abu'l-'Al\u0101's grave in 679.\n\n\u2074 Kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63, i, 460.\ncorrespondence. This must be fixed for 438 A.H., since Abu'l-'Al\u0101 (who was born in 363) says that he began vegetarianism at the age of 30, and had continued it for forty-five years. The \"Crown of Princes,\" to whom Hibat Allah offers to write to obtain an increase of the poet's salary, appears to have been \u1e62adakah Ibn Y\u016bsuf al-Fall\u0101h\u012b, who bore the title Fakhr al-Mulk (here given him by Abu'l-'Al\u0101), and, according to Ibn al-Athir, died in 440. Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b says he was Vizier to the Fatimide Al-Mustans\u012br from 436 to 439. When Abu'l-'Al\u0101 says that \"after what has passed\" he could not appear before this person in the light of a place-hunter, he refers to Letter xxiii of the published collection, in which he refused \u1e62adakah's offer to help him at the court of a former governor of Haleb.\n\nThe amount of information which these letters convey seems to be very considerable, at least for the history of the \"leading ideas of Islam.\" The \"Chief Missionary\" at the Academy of Cairo was by profession pledged to Shi'ism; it was his business to instruct and admit converts. Yet if orthodoxy was a qualification for the post, Hibat Allah seems to have possessed it in a very slight degree. He thinks it \"bad form\" to quote either the Koran or the Tradition on such a question as Vegetarianism; he only does so as a rejoinder to Abu'l-'Al\u0101, otherwise he would have kept clear of this line of reasoning. He found that mankind were of two classes\u2014one of them so stupidly fanatical that they would accept any statement; what the other class were like he does not say. But he tells us that he had defended Abu'l-'Al\u0101 at debates in which the latter's orthodoxy was questioned, and yet appears quite prepared\n\n1 ix, 377.\n2 \u1e24asan al-Muh\u0101d\u0101rah, ii, 153.\n3 I cannot find the title t\u0101j al-umar\u0101 given him elsewhere. However, his successor in the office of Vizier had similar titles to those which Abu'l-'Al\u0101 lavished on him: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0644\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u063a\u064a\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u064a\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0648\u0636 \u062a\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0627\u0621 (Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b, l.c.). The nisbah is wrongly written \u0639\u0644\u0627\u062c\u064a in Ibn Iy\u0101s. Cf. W\u00fcstenfeld in Abh. G\u00f6tt. Akad., xxvii, No. 8, p. 5.\nto hear the other assert the human origin of all professedly sacred codes. To him the poet of Ma'arrah is known, not as a freethinker, but as the great scholar of the age. He supposes that his conduct will be the result of profound speculation, and tests him in an easy matter in order to be able to approach him on difficult ones.\n\nAnd what sort of figure does Abu'l-'Al\u0101 cut in this correspondence? One that justifies the statement of the Prophet that \"poets say what they do not do.\"\u00b9 The poet had offered his services to those \"whose religion and understanding were ailing\": some one who acknowledges to that condition asks his aid, and the poet does his utmost to explain away his offer, to make learned quotations serve instead of arguments, and to substitute special and personal motives for reasons based on universal laws. He does not appear capable of distinguishing between may and must, important though that distinction be. He also, under the pretence of being horrified, cites with evident gusto some of the most blasphemous lines preserved in Arabic.\n\nIbn al-Habb\u0101riyyah supposed the correspondence had had fatal results for Abu'l-'Al\u0101. It is pleasing to know that the correspondents parted friends. Hibat Allah probably had too great experience of mankind to be greatly disappointed when he found the poet's promise could not be kept. In the sources at present open to me I can find no further mention of Hibat Allah besides the notice in Makrizi. What the purport of the title \"the aided in religion\" (given him by both Abu'l-'Al\u0101 and Makrizi) may be is not clear.\n\nIf it were true, as Von Kremer and others supposed, that Abu'l-'Al\u0101 was imitating the practice of the Jainas in his ascetic r\u00e9gime, we might expect some reference in these letters to the Indian doctrine, which, however, is not to be found. Moreover, it is noticeable that he tells us his asceticism began in his 30th year\u2014not after his return from Baghdad, as had seemed probable. Syria does not seem a likely place for Jaina doctrines to have been reached,\n\n\u00b9 Sura xxvi, 225.\nand yet before the journey to Baghdad Abu'l-'Al\u0101 would seem not to have gone outside its limits.\n\nWe learn incidentally the source of Dhahabi's account of the poet's income, and the way in which it was disposed. If his journey to Baghdad was really undertaken with the object of securing it, this object was realized.\n\nThe Bodleian copy of Y\u0101k\u016bt is very modern, and contains many errors. Of these only the most obvious have been corrected. Y\u0101k\u016bt's abridgment was not very skilfully made, since the correspondents not infrequently quote passages of each other's letters which do not appear in the compendium. Probably, however, little of importance has been omitted.

\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647.\n2 Sura lxxiv, 46.\n3 MS. \u0622\u0630\u064a\u0647.\nTRANSLATION.\n\nI read in the work called the *Firmament of Ideas*\u00b9 that many ignorant persons regard death as an injustice done by the Creator, and think it a shame, notwithstanding the kindness and wisdom which it displays, and the comfort and benefit which it brings. And, indeed, Abu'l-'Al\u0101 Ahmad Ibn Abdallah Ibn Sulaym\u0101n Al-Maghribi,\u00b2 the author who is so vain of his attainments, who makes professions so long and broad, who extols and vaunts his wisdom so much, says\u2014\n\n\"Thou\u00b3 didst forbid murder, and dost Thyself send two angels to take the soul: Thou declarest that we shall return again. Could not it have dispensed with both states?\"\n\nNow this is the talk of a raving maniac who supposes death and murder to be identical. When this idiot forfeited the pleasure of religion, and the sweetness of the truth, and the light of scripture, and the comfort of the verity, he would have done better not to pretend to powers of which he was utterly destitute, in the verse\u2014\n\n\"Are\u2074 thy understanding and thy counsel ailing? Come to me that thou mayest learn the utterances of sound wits!\"\n\nFor God put him in the power of Abu Na\u1e63r Ibn Ab\u012b\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 An account of Ibn al-Habb\u0101riyyah, the author of this work, is given by Ibn Khallikan, ii, 19\u201321 (Cairo, 1299). He died about 504 A.H., and is likely to have been born about the time of Abu'l-'Al\u0101's death. The narrative quoted by Y\u0101k\u016bt teems with inaccuracies.\n\n\u00b2 Probably the author's mistake for Al-Ma'arri.\n\n\u00b3 Often quoted as an example of Abu'l-'Al\u0101's impiety.\n\n\u2074 *Lus\u016bmiyy\u0101t*, Cairo, 1891, i, 232. In both this and the Bombay edition the first word is wrongly vocalized.\n'Imr\u0101n,\u00b9 Chief Missionary \u00b2 in Egypt, who said to him, \"I am the person of ailing understanding and counsel, and have come to thee for medicine, so heal me.\" A long correspondence went on between them, and at last Abu Na\u1e63r ordered the poet to be brought to \u1e24aleb,\u00b3 where he was promised a large sum from the treasury\u2074 if he accepted Islam.\u2075 Abu'l-'Al\u0101, knowing that the alternatives before him were Islam or death, took poison, and died of it.\u2076 He had better, then, have been quiet instead of boasting of his understanding and uttering absurdities of the sort, such as could only suit the case of one who cared not for God.\n\nWhen I read this story, I was anxious to know exactly what passed between them, and at last I got hold of a thin volume, containing a number of letters from Abu Na\u1e63r Hibat Allah Ibn Ab\u012b 'Imr\u0101n to Al-Ma'arr\u012b on the subject. Their correspondence, however, ended in both parties acquiescing, and there was no suggestion of Abu'l-'Al\u0101 having poisoned himself, as Ibn al-Habb\u0101riyyah says. To transcribe the letters in full would take too long, so I have extracted the main points, omitting the verbiage in which Al-Ma'arri indulges.\n\n\u00b9 He is called by Ma\u1e33rizi (i, 460) Hibat Allah Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-A\u2018jami, i.e. of the tribe Al-A\u2018jam.\n\u00b2 The office of \u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0627\u0629 is thus defined by Kalkashand\u012b, ii, 236 (Arch. A. Seld. 18):\u2014\"He came next after the chief K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b in rank, and wore the same attire. The religious doctrines (\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0647\u062c) of the people of the Prophet's house were studied with him in a house called the Academy (\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645), and he gave the oath to those who wished to join their sect.\"\nThe passage is translated by W\u00fcstenfeld, l.c., xxv, 1, p. 185. It is also to be found in Makrizi, i, 391, whose account of the conduct of the mission is of extraordinary interest. See De Sacy, Religion des Druzes, i, lxiii sqq. Of this \"Academy\" an interesting history is given by Makrizi (Khitat, i, 458-460); it was founded by H\u0101kim in 395, and closed by Al-Afdal Ibn Amir al-Juyush in the sixth century. From Makrizi's account it appears to have been a hotbed of heresy, with which the character which Hibat Allah gives of himself corresponds.\n\u00b3 Since Hibat Allah was in Cairo, he could not well do this. Ibn al-Habb\u0101riyyah was thinking of an apocryphal story of Abu'l-'Al\u0101 being summoned by the Vizier of \u1e24aleb, and killing fifty men by his imprecations.\n\u2074 This is an allusion to another story of Abu'l-'Al\u0101 being offered the contents of the treasury of Ma'arra\u1e25.\n\u2075 In this correspondence Abu'l-'Al\u0101 appears as a model of orthodoxy.\n\u2076 As a matter of fact he lived eleven years longer.\nI. Letter of Ibn Abi 'Imr\u0101n.\n\nThat you, dear sir, God guide you well, have a tongue so excellently learned that it reduces all besides to silence, is generally acknowledged by all who are on the surface of this earth; only that learning, to which you are what Galen was to medicine, and the keys of whose mysteries you control, seems to furnish no great boon for either your present or your future life, unless it be winged fame\u2014fame which, so long as a man lives, he may hear ringing, and of which he may be conscious as an ornament and personal charm, whereas when fate has once driven him from the outside of the earth to the inside, neither can fair fame help him nor ill fame hurt him. This being so, it is extraordinary that you, God help you, with your powerful intellect, should devote the whole of it to studying the rules of the Arabic language, and collecting its words and their meanings, thus lavishing your life on what cannot profit you, while leaving your brilliantly talented mind destitute of reflections on your future; choosing the labour that profiteth not, to be left, when the froth is gone, dry, with nothing else. Hence it follows with certainty that you, God guard you, must have drunk deep of this sweet draught, but must, for reasons of policy, have concealed it. And the proof that you have reflected on the future life is to be found in your ascetic practice, your abstention from all luxurious food, drink, and clothing, your refusing to suffer your body to be the grave of animals, to taste their milk, or to turn into food any of the creatures whose generation and breeding give pleasure to the sources of them. Your practice implies the belief that pain inflicted on them will be avenged, and represents the extreme of asceticism. Observing this, and hearing the invitation conveyed in a verse ascribed to you\u2014\n\n\"Are thy faith and thy understanding ailing? Come to me that thou mayest learn the true account of the matter,\"\nI hastened towards you, as one whose faith and understanding are both unsound, unto one who, being sound himself, can tell me \"the truth of the matter.\" I then am the first to answer your summons, and to acknowledge my own bewilderment. And you must not take me into dark places, nor obscure tracks, nor try in what you say to obscure the truth with error. My first question will be about a simple matter, and if your treatment of it be successful I will go on to something serious. What is your ground for abstaining from meat, milk, and all other animal products, as though they were unlawful? Are not, I ask you, plants set by nature where the animals will come upon them, so that by their existence, their goodness, and by a sensitive force which the animals possess the latter have power to utilize the plants? Were it not for the animals, the plants would be a meaningless and purposeless creation. On the same principle the human force controls the animals just as the animals control the plants, owing to the superiority which man possesses in the reason and the power of speech. Hence man utilizes the animals for a variety of purposes, and were it not for that, the creation of the animals would be purposeless. Hence your refusing to use what is created for you, and ordained on your account, destroys the harmony of Nature.\n\nYour purpose in abstaining from meat must be either compassion for the animals, which makes you disapprove of doing them violence, in which case you have no right to be kinder to them than their Creator; but if you hold that certain men (and not God) are responsible for the notions lawful and unlawful, these persons being the lawgivers, whereas God has given no permission for the shedding of the blood of animals and for eating their flesh, your doctrine is disproved by the fact that we see before us various beasts and birds of prey, created by God in forms which are only compatible with carnivorous habits, involving the tearing of animals and devouring of them. This fact being well established in creation, mankind may well be excused for eating meat, and those who allow it to be eaten\nare evidently in the right. Or, secondly, you may regard the shedding of the blood of animals as an unwise ordinance, in which case your objection will fall on your Creator who called you into existence.\n\nIf, then, you would be so kind as to produce a ground which I can regard as satisfactory, I shall hope for a cure of the malady which I have acknowledged.\n\nII. Answer from Abu'l-'Al\u0101 of Ma'arra\u1e25.\n\nSays God's weak and humble slave Ahmad, son of Abdallah, son of Sulaym\u0101n. I will commence by observing that I regard the most noble prince (my correspondent), whom God has guided in religion, and whose life may He prolong, as one of those who have inherited wisdom from the Prophets, while I regard my erring self as one of the unlearned. You to condescend to write to me! Who am I that one like you should write to one like me! The Pleiades might as well come down to the Earth. God knows that I am hard of hearing and of sight, this fate having befallen me when I was four years old, so that I cannot distinguish between the house and its inhabitant. Then to this was added a whole train of disasters, so that my figure got to resemble a curved branch, and finally I have in my latter years become crippled, and unable to rise. As for your questions, I will say a little about the problems which vex you. God Almighty condemned me personally to privation, and hence I commenced the holy war of poverty. The verse that you quote\u2014\n\n\"Are thy understanding and thy faith ailing? Come to me,\" etc.,\n\nwas only addressed to those who are in the slough of ignorance, not to one who is the beacon and source of knowledge. The animals are, as you know, sensitive, and feel pain, and I have heard something of the discussion of the ancients, and the first point with which they start is\nthis\u2014Supposing any human being were to say: If we were to frame a proposition made up of a subject, predicate, and two intermediate terms, one negative and the other exceptional, viz. \"God does nothing but good,\" this proposition must be either false or true. If it be true, still we see that evil prevails, and we know that this is a mystery. Hence professedly religious persons have at all times been anxious to abstain from meat, because it cannot be obtained without causing pain to animals, which at all times shun pain. Think of the ewe, domesticated, and with young; when she has born the lamb, and it has lived a month or thereabout, they kill it and eat it, and want her milk. And the ewe spends the night bleating, and would run in quest of it if she could. A commonplace among the Arabs is the suffering of the wild beasts, and the pining of the wild cow for her calf. One of them says\u2014\n\n\"Ne'er was sorrow like mine felt by a camel-calf's mother, though when she loses him she whines oft and oft.\"\n\nNow an opponent may urge: If God wills nothing but good, then of evil one of two things must be true. Either God must know of it or not. If He knows of it, then one of two things must be true. Either He wills it or not. If He wills it then He is practically the doer of it, just as one might say, \"The governor cut off the robber's hand,\" even though he did not do it with his own hands. But if God did not will it, then He has suffered what such a Governor should not suffer upon earth. If there be done in his province what he dislikes, he reproves the doer and commands that the practice stop. This is a knot which the metaphysicians have tried hard to solve, and found insoluble. Then the Prophets tell us that Almighty God is merciful and loving. If, then, He be loving towards mankind, assuredly He will be tender to other classes of living beings which are sensitive to the least pain. And He must know that the animals as they pasture are oftentimes attacked by the horseman, who transtixes the male ass or\nthe female . . . . How, then, can one who treats them thus deserve compassion, they who drink not out of buckets nor transgress any written code? Ofttimes, too, have I seen a couple of armies, each of them professing a distinct cult, meeting in battle, and thousands falling on each side. For which theory does this make? Even study does not make it clear.\n\nI therefore, having heard of these different opinions, and having reached my 30th year, begged God of His mercy to grant me a perpetual fast, which I never break during month or year save at the two Feasts; for the rest I let the days and nights roll by and break it not. I believed, too, that restricting myself to a vegetable diet would secure my health; and doubtless you have looked into the ancient works and the sayings ascribed to Galen and others, which show that the authors believed in the soundness of this r\u00e9gime. And if it be said that the Creator is loving and merciful, then why does He suffer the lion to despatch a human being who is neither mischievous nor cruel? How many multitudes have perished of serpents' bites! Why has He given the hawk and the falcon control over birds that are satisfied with pecking grain? Often does the sandgrouse start off of a morning, leaving its chicks athirst, to find water to bring them in its crop; when ere she can reach them she meets with a kite, that devours her, so that the chicks perish of thirst. (He goes on in this style for some time, and then says) I pray God I may be saved from the utterance of the unbeliever\u2014\n\n\"Umm Bakr has come greeting, and bid her welcome. And how many a noble pedigree and generous frame lies in the Well, the Well of Badr! How many a bowl once crowned with camel's hump\n\n1 This is surely not to be taken literally. The phrase 'a perpetual fast' used by Ibn al-Athir in the story of \u1e24al\u0101j (viii, 92) would seem, however, to have some technical sense.\n\n2 These verses are given by Ibn Hish\u0101m (ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, p. 530) as said by Shadd\u0101d Ibn al-Aswad after Badr. The texts are very different. See also Mr. Nicholson's note, p. 93 supra.\nlies in the Well, the Well of Badr! Mother of Bakr, bring me no more cups since Hish\u0101m\u2019s brother is dead! No more since his father\u2019s brother, who was a hero of heroes, a drinker of wine. Tell God Almighty from me, please, that I give up the fasting month. What, when the head has parted from its shoulders, and the companion has had his fill of food, does Ibn Kabshah\\(^1\\) promise that he shall live? And how is he going to give life to ghosts and spectres? Is there truly a revelation to the effect that death will give back my frame, and restore me after my bones are dust?\"\n\nGod\u2019s curse, too, be on him who says (said to be Al-Walid Ibn Yazid Ibn Abd al-Malik)\u2014\n\u201cBring it\\(^2\\) near me, my friend.\u201d\n\u201cI am quite sure that I shall not be raised up for Hell. I shall teach my people till they embrace the religion of the Ass.\\(^3\\) For I find that he who seeks Paradise is playing a losing game.\u201d\n\nA plague, too, on Ibn Ru\u2019yan, if it be he who said\u2014\n\u201c\u2019Tis the first; they do indeed promise a second, but deferred hope makes the heart sick. And if part of what they say be true, then He who afflicts us also makes us well.\u201d\n\nAnother ground that induced me to abstain from animal food is the fact that my income is a little over twenty dinars a year, and when my servant takes out of that as much as he wants, no magnificent sum is left. So I restrict myself to beans and lentils, and such food as I would rather not mention. So now, if my attendant gets what I think\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A name given by the Pagans of Mecca to the Prophet.\n\\(^2\\) Probably the wine. The verses are also given in Aghani, vi, 123, with many differences.\n\\(^3\\) The text of the Aghani, which is obscene, may have been altered intentionally.\nmuch and he thinks little, my portion is a small fixed charge. And I have no intention of increasing my rations, or getting fresh visits from ailments. Farewell.\n\nIII. Answer from Ibn Abi 'Imr\u0101n.\n\nGod preserve you from being of the number of those whose religious and intellectual honour is stained by illness, and from having answered one who appealed to you, in virtue of your verse, in order to obtain relief from sickness, with an answer that only makes his thirst worse! Truly you would in that case be an illustration of Mutanabbi's line\u2014\n\n\"The world stirred my thirst, but when I came to her to slake it, she rained troubles on me.\"\n\nI asked you a personal question about your reason for abstaining from the meat which strengthens the body and produces flesh; and you give me an answer of which I can only say, \"Are these the utterances of sound wits?\" This medicine of yours only makes the sick man yet worse, and your words only increase the blindness and deafness of him who is religiously and intellectually suffering from those ailments. Moreover, all you say is off the point of my first question, and has nothing to do with it. With regard to your assertion that meat cannot be procured without infliction of pain on animals, that has already been answered. You need not be kinder to them than their Creator. Either He is just or unjust: if He is just, then He takes the lives of eater and eaten alike, and His right is unquestioned therein; if He be unjust, then we need not outdo our Creator and be just where He is unjust. When you say \"Now an opponent may urge, etc.,\" this reminds me of a story how a man lost his Koran, and some told him to read \"By the sun and its noon,\" since that would enable him to find it; but the man observed that this Sura was in his lost Koran too. Similarly I may say that\nthis difficulty of yours is one of the whole number, all is dark, and where is the light? My purpose was to learn \"the utterances of sound wits,\" as you express it. When you observe, \"Seeing the diversity of opinions, and conscious of decline, I besought God to grant me a perpetual fast, and that I might be satisfied with vegetables,\" I am not clear whether the God of whom you besought this is the one who wishes good only, or the one who wishes evil only, or the one who wishes both together. And Fasting is an ordinance based on a code brought by an Apostle, and an Apostle is connected with a Sender. And about this Sender we are in doubt. Does He send His Apostle meaning him to be obeyed or not to be obeyed? If He wills the former, then His will is overruled; for more disobey than obey. If He means him to be disobeyed, then His sending the Apostle is an absurdity, a mere search after an excuse for torturing poor men. If, therefore, your fasting be based on this, it is useless; but if it have some more valid and clearer ground, I should like to know it. When you repeat the words of certain heretics, and ask God to protect you from finding fault with His word, \"Now He destroyed the old Ad and Thamud, and spared not,\" etc., if God created them knowing that they would sin, without hope of repentance, surely the \"Merciful and Loving\" had better not have created them to torture them; but if He does not know, nor can tell what a man will do, then He is like ourselves. When you go on to say, \"God forbid that we should say this, rather let us assent and repeat the text, 'Whom God guides, he is in the right way; whom He misleads, for him thou shalt find no guiding friend,'\" well, if a heretic observes that sugar is sweet he is not to be disbelieved because he is a heretic, and the argument of our heretic requires an answer. If you have an answer, that is what we request; if not, your assent in such a case is assent to the heretic, nothing else. When you repeat the verses, \"Umm 'Amr has come greeting,\" etc., and rebuke and curse their author, who ever suspected you of holding these sentiments? God\nforbid! And why need you reproduce such blasphemous verses?\n\nAs for your last remark, that all you have in the year is twenty dinars and odd, of which the larger half goes to your servant and the smaller remains to you, and that you must put up with the provision of the fortune that feeds you, which it would be necessary to bear if it were heavy, and still more when it is light, I have written to my lord Taj al-\u02bfUmara, requesting him to offer to remove this cause by presenting you with what to him is a trifling amount of the richest food, and to see that this is regularly given you, that the veil of this necessity may be removed, and that your mode of living may be thoroughly comfortable. If you are energetic enough to reply, I beg that you will excuse me from recherch\u00e9 rhymes and forced figures, as what I want is not sound but sense.\n\nIV. Abu'l-'Al\u0101's Answer.\n\n(After compliments) I, who confess my ignorance and acknowledge my bewilderment, and pray God that He may grant me a little of His mercy. [I can only say] what I said when I first addressed you, when I mentioned my confidence in your ability and my own feebleness and wretchedness compared therewith, and how I reckon myself a dumb brute and wonder that one like you should seek guidance from who has it not\u2014it is as though the moon that travails night and day in the service of its Lord should seek guidance from a horned beast in a desert, that goes down to the water to meet the huntsman who sends an arrow into its heart.\n\nYou quote one of my verses in \u1e24\u2014a verse written to tell others how keenly I strive to be religious, and what is my expedient with regard to the text \"whom God guides he is in the right way.\" The first of them runs\u2014\n\"Are thy understanding and thy faith ailing? Come then to me that thou mayest learn the true account of the matter.\n\nEat not wrongfully what the water produces, nor eat the meat of beasts newly slain.\"\n\nNow no one can deny that the creatures that live in the sea come out of the water against their will. And if the reason be consulted about it, it will find no fault with the refusal to eat fish; for religious men have at all times abstained from things which in themselves are lawful for them.\n\n\"Nor the white of mothers who meant the cream thereof for their babes and not for proud high-born maids.\"\n\nThe 'white' means the milk. Now it is well known that when the calf is killed the cow pines for it, and keeps awake whole nights on its account. Its flesh is eaten, and the milk that it should have sucked is lavished on its mother's owners. What harm, then, can there be in abstaining from killing the calf, and declining to use the milk? Such a man need not suppose it to be unlawful; he only abstains out of religious fervour and mercy towards the victim, and in the hope that he may be compensated for his abstinence by the Creator's forgiveness. And if it be said that the Almighty distributes His gifts equally between His servants, then what sins have the victims committed that they should be excluded from His mercy?\n\n\"Neither fall upon the birds when they are busy with their eggs, for robbery is the worst of crimes.\"\n\nThe Prophet forbade hunting at night. And this is one of two interpretations of his dictum \"leave the birds in their nests.\" In the Koran, too, is the text \"O ye that believe, slay not the quarry while ye are on pilgrimage; and if any of you kill any on purpose, then he is to pay in cattle the value of what he killed,\" etc. Anyone with the\nsmallest amount of sense who hears this tradition cannot be blamed if he tries to win the favour of the Lord of heaven and earth by treating lawful quarry like unlawful quarry, though the former be not forbidden.\n\n\"And leave alone the honey for which the busy bees went out so early to gather it from the fragrant flowers.\"\n\nSince the bees fight their hardest to keep the gatherer off their honey, there is no harm in a man abstaining from it, and desiring to place the bee in the same category as other creatures that dislike being killed to be eaten and having their means of living taken to feed and fatten women and other human beings. The poets have described that to which I refer; Abu Dhi'b thus speaks of the honey-gatherer\u2014\n\n\"When the bees sting him little recks he of their sting, but fights on for the house of the honey-bees.\"\n\nA story to the following effect is told of 'Ali. He had a sack of barley-flour, ordinarily sealed up; only when he fasted he would have none of it sealed. And although he had great quantities of corn, he used to give the whole of it away in alms, and content himself with a minimum. A certain ascetic also said in a sermon that he gathered in 50,000 dinars' worth of corn in the year (but gave it all away). Hence we learn that the Prophets and the original authorities stint themselves, in order to bestow of their superfluity on the needy.\n\nYou have even suggested that a vegetarian is to be blamed. If this principle were to be applied, a man ought not to pray except the appointed prayers, for any additional prayers lead to unnecessary trouble, which God (forsooth) does not approve. Also when a wealthy man has set apart the fortieth of his gold for alms, he ought not to give any more; whereas there are many places in the Koran in which expenditure is commended.\n\nThis is a sufficient answer for your feeble, humble servant.\nWere I to appear before your exalted presence, you would know that there is nothing left of me to ask or answer. For my limbs refuse to act in concert; I cannot stand up to pray, but have to pray sitting, God help me. Gladly would I reach the stage of being able to crawl about with a staff. (Some verses are here quoted in illustration of his feebleness.) When I lie down I cannot sit up, and have to get assistance. When my helper stretches out his hand to raise me, my bones, which are bare of flesh, rattle.\n\nAs for the verse of Mutanabbi which you quote, one who seeks guidance from so feeble a creature as I am can only be compared to one who seeks dates from thistles. You can only have been brought to do it by that confidence which is the mark of a noble nature, of a lofty soul, of high breeding, and of a stainless character.\n\nYour suggestion, too, that you would write to get my salary increased also is proof of generosity inherited from countless ancestors, beginning with the Earth. I have no desire for any increase; no desire to return to delicacies, abstinence from which has become a second nature to me. For forty-five years I have tasted no meat, and an old man does not quit his habits till he is covered by the grave-dust. The most excellent \"Crown of Princes, Pride of the Kingdom, Mainstay of the sovereignty, Arms and Glory of the dynasty, doubly glorious,\" is, as I know, the equal of all the children of Shem, Ham, and Japhet, and gladly would I see the castle of Haleb and all the mountains of Syria turned into gold, that they might be bestowed in charity by the Crown of Princes and Mainstay of the Prophetic dynasty, on whose head be peace, as also on his righteous ancestors, without a penny thereof coming to me. And, indeed, I should be ashamed if the Crown of Princes were to regard me as one who is hankering after this world, after what has passed. And I shall be glad if when I appear before God Almighty I am charged with nothing more than abstinence from meat. If I reach this condition I shall be right blest. (He then excuses himself for rhyming with the aid of various anecdotes and arguments.) And may your\ncause always be the winning one, and your power be ever in the ascendant. Even as Tha'labah, son of \u1e62u'air, says\u2014\n\n\"Many an evildoer and a man of mischief, whose breasts boiled with fallacious fictions, did I . . . . to their vexation, and silence their error with victorious truth.\"\n\nAnd were you to argue with Aristotle, you would nonplus him, or with Plato, he would throw his arguments away. God glorify His Code by your life, and help His religion by your evidences. God is sufficient, etc.\n\nV. Answer from Ibn Abi 'Imr\u0101n.\n\nIn addressing you at the first I endeavoured to conceal my personality, preferring that the source of the question should not be known, so that your answer might be one of argument, without respect of persons, and without the awkwardness of having to introduce the \"my lord\" and \"your excellency,\" etc., since the matter on which we are engaged required that the vanities of this world should not be mixed therewith, and because I truly believed you to be one who, owing to your contempt of the world, had a reach so much wider than mine that I could not hope to buy any piece of religious knowledge from you; and I know not how the fact was divulged, so that you should address me as \"lord\" and \"excellency.\" I am your superior neither materially nor morally; I merely direct my steed towards you to gain something. If I find a well of water, or come to a river or the sign thereof, I shall meet it with gratitude for your kindness, and do not pretend to dispute your claim to teach.\n\nI would have you know that I traversed the earth from the furthest part of my country to Egypt, and everywhere found people divided into two classes. There are the fanatical believers who are so enchanted with their religion, that if their religious records contained the statement that an\nelephant flew or a camel laid an egg they would believe it implicitly. They would regard one who thought otherwise as a heretic and a fool, who might be neglected. With such persons as these the reason is at a discount. It is difficult to awake such a man to the fact that the light of reason must have sparkled from the religion which he professes ere its collar could have been placed on the neck or its bracelet on the wrist. How, then, can it be right to give the reason control at the first and to proceed to dethrone it?\n\nWhen my fortune brought me to Syria, and I heard of your eminence as a scholar and savant, I found that on that matter opinions were agreed and the evidence established irrefragably. But I found that men were divided about your religious position, and distraught about it, each speaker taking a view of his own. I attended a seance at which the subject was discussed, and all sorts of things were said about you. I defended you in your absence, saying that your well-known and confirmed asceticism cleared you of all suspicion. I was convinced that you must have some esoteric religious knowledge, which you kept concealed from the rest of mankind. There must be something which distinguishes you from people who charge each other with heresy. And so when I heard the verse \"Are thy understanding and thy counsel ailing,\" etc., my conviction was so much the more strengthened. I thought that a tongue that could utter such a claim and give vent to such a boast must be a tongue meet to silence every speaker, though he were to stand on the highest pinnacle of the mount of knowledge. So I approached you as Moses approached the mountain, hoping to get a light, and endeavouring to raise a lighthouse of glory; to learn what others were too backward to know, or about which men differed. So I dropped in my bucket in the form of my question about a trifle, thus ascending from my own low level to one higher, and rising from my own littleness to one who was great. You answered that you were too humble a person to serve as a source of direction. This,\nI thought, was an extra virtue on your part, and what might be expected of such a man. Finally, your answer resolved itself into the assertion that mankind were all at some stage or other of a wandering in the valley of bewilderment, stumbling over its edges. One says that good and evil are from God, and he is answered with the question whether the dangers of travel from which the Prophet used to ask deliverance, and all similar things from which deliverance is sought, are good or evil. If they are good, why should they be prayed against? If evil, but intended by God, then the prayer is as useless as before\u2014nay, more so. And the similar question whether the poisoning of Hasan and the murder of Husain were good or bad; if they were good, then why should their author be cursed? If they were bad, but intended by God, then the slayer is not to blame. Another says that good is of God, and evil of another, and is answered in a manner that silences him. With this answer you combined other matter, including some blasphemous verses. My answer was that I disclaimed all connection with those whom you mentioned, and threw myself on you, that the discussions of these people had never slaked the thirst, and that in my ears they found no assent. I asked you, therefore, to open the gate for me to your own opinions, and to give me access to your private thoughts. This you did not do. Then I asked you why you abstain from meat, and you replied that you dislike hurting animals and causing them pain. I rebutted your plea, after you had dilated on it, by observing that if God empowers one animal to eat another, though He knows best what is wise and is most merciful to His creatures, you need not be more just and merciful to them than their Lord and Creator. You then changed your ground, and alleged your inability to procure animal food, because of the whole sum which came to you in the year the greater part went to your attendant, and only a little remained for yourself. This, too, I rebutted by pointing to a liberal source, one of those who never taunt those whom they benefit with their favours or insult them,\nwho would provide you with an ample supply of the daintiest food and the most luxurious stores. This, too, you declined, declaring in your second letter that you disliked it, and would not have it, and could not abandon the vegetarianism which you had so long maintained. You went on to say that I had been seeking counsel from one who had none to give, and that the verse of which I had taken hold and alleged as my ground for enquiring into your practice and principles, was only intended to exhibit your religious zeal and your expedient for dealing with the text \"He whom God guides finds His way; He whom God misleads thou shalt not find for him a guiding friend.\" Therein you combined two contradictory statements in one proposition. If the verse is true, then study is useless.\n\nNext you say that God has secrets that only the saints understand. It is just that secret about which we are hovering, and round the door of him who knows it that we are making circuit. And when we, arguing from your verse, suppose that you do possess it, seeing that you profess that your own religion and intellect are sound, whereas those of other men are ailing, you declare that you have no counsel to give! Assuredly in this matter your prose contradicts your verse and your verse your prose. So what is to be done?\n\nThen you say that the sense of the verse \"Are thy understanding and thy faith,\" etc., is given by the following line, \"Then eat not,\" etc. Clearly, then, the sickness of faith and understanding must be due to eating meat and drinking milk and consuming honey, so that soundness of both is to be acquired by abandoning these practices. You must know that soundness of faith and understanding is not produced thereby. Hence the second verse cannot annul the first, so as to make the substance of your assertion that men require to be rendered sound in understanding and faith an exhortation to them not to eat meat or drink milk!\n\nNext you observe that the creatures of the sea dislike being brought on dry land, and that the reason cannot find fault with abstention from their flesh, though it be lawful\nfor food, for religious men at all times abandon the use of certain things that are lawful for them. Now there is no animal on sea or land that is more honourable than man, the living, the intelligent. He dislikes death, yet he dies. He dislikes being eaten, yet the worms eat him in his grave. If this proceed from some wise principle, then what you say about the sea-animals and the land-animals belongs to precisely the same field; but if it be a case of deflexion from wisdom, it is absurd that my Maker should be a fool and I, His creature, be wise. When you quote the tradition that the Prophet prayed till his feet blistered, and being asked about it said \"Ought I not to be a grateful servant?\" this has nothing to do with the present issue. A man may say as many prayers as he likes in the times at which prayer is lawful, only to the appointed prayers he must not add nor may he diminish them. Now this matter belongs to the Code, whereas our theme was discussion of matters connected with the reason. When you say that the Prophet regarded game within the sacred territory as unlawful, so that others may treat lawful game as unlawful, in order to win God's favour thereby, I reply that God only may make things lawful or unlawful.\n\nWhen you say that 'Ali, when the pressed dates were brought, asked whether the Prophet had eaten thereof, and being told that he had not, refused to eat, this is an argument against you, not for you. For it is agreed that the Prophet never became a vegetarian, whereas you are one all your life. This, therefore, is a plain contrast to the Prophet's practice. And had you not quoted the Law against me, and not exceeded the scope of the reason, I should have spared you this rejoinder, which may trouble your mind, for which I should be sorry.\n\nWhen you complain of your weakness and difficulty of moving, and say you have no strength left to ask or answer questions, whether weak or strong you are still one of the glories of the age, and one whose praises travellers carry with them everywhere. However much fate may have wronged you, you have wronged yourself by depriving\nyourself of the pleasures of the world. And if you hope for pleasures which will compensate for them, pleasures of a better and more lasting sort, then you will have made no bad bargain, and the verse of yours which has been discussed will have been justified, though you may incur the reproach of stinginess in rejecting requests for aid and refusing those who ask you. If, on the other hand, you are torturing yourself without any clear reason, as you now assert, being one of the many who \"idly dispute\" and founder in bewilderment, then you have wasted your life and wronged yourself. You will also in the verse that has been quoted have made an assertion which you cannot verify.\n\nThe purpose of my questions and answers was my own benefit. Since that is not to be had, God has relieved you of the trouble of answering me. As for the rhymes and my request that we might be relieved of them, it is because rhymes are not ideas worth going out of our way to follow, and because were I to study the excellence of your works in belles lettres and poetry I should find therein an ample field. Would that I could get at the hidden treasures of your religious lore as I can at your compositions in prose and verse! But before and after I ask pardon for troubling your mind, and wasting your time in reading my letters and answering them. For inasmuch as I have done you no good I have done you harm. God knows that I had no intention save to benefit by your wisdom and fill my bucket from your sea.\nART. XII.\u2014An Unknown Work by Albiruni.\n\nBy H. BEVERIDGE.\n\nThere is in the British Museum a Persian MS., Or. 5,849, which is a translation of an Arabic treatise by Albiruni. It is a small quarto containing 175 folios, and at one time belonged to one of the Oude royal libraries, and has several red impressions of seals. It was picked up by me in Lakhnau, in 1899. The MS. is a materia medica, and contains accounts of drugs, vegetable and mineral, in alphabetical order. Its title is Kitab-i-saidanah, and the translator discusses at some length the origin of this name. Albiruni was inclined to derive it from the Indian chandan and the Persian chandal, sandalwood, but this etymology is rejected by the translator. There is a long preface by the translator, and as it is in very high-flown language, and as the MS. is much worm-eaten, it is not very easy to understand his meaning. However, we learn from p. 2b1 that the translator's name was Abu-bakr, son of Ali, son of Usman Asfarul-kasani, and further on we find that he came to India in the beginning of Shamsu-d-din Iltatmish's reign, or in the last year of his predecessor and father-in-law, Qutbu-d-din Aibak, and consequently about 607 A.H. (1211 A.D.). He speaks of staying in Dihli for eighteen months. Though he does not tell us the exact\n\n---\n\n1 The translator mentions his own name again at p. 108a, under the article Salsal, and also at p. 114, under the article Talc, i.e. 'talc,' where he seems to speak of his having been in Kashghar, and at 132a, under the article Tark, i.e. 'stores.'\n\n2 So spelt by Dr. Rieu; often spelt Altamsh and Altmish. See Thomas's \"Pathan Kings,\" pp. 43, 44. Badayuni's explanation that the name was derived from Shameu-d-din's being born during an eclipse of the moon may be correct, for it is in some measure confirmed by Redhouse, and Badayuni had means of hearing the story of the derivation, for Badayuni was Shamsu-d-din's sifet, and the tradition may have lingered down to Badayuni's time.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nyear in which he made his translation, it is certain that it was before 626 A.H. (1229 A.D.), for he refers to Shamsu-d-din's having a son born to him in the beginning of his reign, and expresses a hope that this will put an end to sedition by reducing the rebels to despair. He calls this son (p. 4b) Na\u1e63iru-d-daniy\u0101 wa ud-d\u012bn, and he must mean thereby the elder prince of that name, who became governor of Bengal during his father's lifetime, and died in 626 A.H.\n\nAfter the translator's preface there follows Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b's own preface, or an abridgment thereof. In it Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b describes the books he used. One was a compilation giving the names of drugs in ten languages; another, which he got from Christian physicians, was in Syriac, and gave the names of drugs in Syriac, Greek (R\u016bmi), Arabic, and Persian; a third, which he also got from Christian physicians, bore the name of Lexicon. He also acknowledges his obligations to a distinguished physician named Ab\u016b H\u0101mid, son of A\u1e25madu-l-bashafi (?).\n\nThe descriptions of the drugs give first their localities and characteristics, and then their remedial action. I have looked in vain for any interesting autobiographical details, though there are several references to Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b's travels. Thus, under the account of the drug goz gandam (p. 148b) there is a reference to what he had seen in the country of Jurj\u0101n, and in the account of the orange (n\u0101ranj), p. 165, we are told what the old men of Bast (in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n) said about the seeds having been brought into their country by a strange bird, which they found lying dead in a river bed after there had been a long drought. Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b adds that the Indian name for the orange is \u0643\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u062f kirand. Apparently this is the Sanskrit kar\u012b\u1e47a and Hindustani karna, which is a name for the pummelo. Opium is one of the drugs described, and its use by the people of Mecca is spoken of, but nothing is said about its use or cultivation in India. Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b generally gives the name of each drug in several languages, and under opium, afy\u016bn, he quotes one Fir\u0101z\u012b as stating that the Sindh name for the drug is ras-i sir shamy (?). Fir\u0101z\u012b is again quoted under t\u016bb\u0101l (vitriol?), p. 47a.\nThe last article in the book is zamb\u016bt or the carob-tree, and the one immediately before it gives an interesting account of jasht, or jashm, i.e. \u2018jade.\u2019 Galen\u2019s description of it is quoted, and we are told that the Greek name for jasht is \u1f40\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. Probably the copyist has written \u1f40\u03c3 by mistake for \u1f40\u03bc, and the word \u1f40\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 is apparently a corruption of \u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, which is Galen\u2019s name for green jasper. (See K\u00fchn\u2019s ed., Leipsic, 1826, vol. xii, pp. 206, 207.) Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b says that the Greek word means snakestone, and it appears from this remark and from the rest of the description that he or his authority has mixed up two drugs described by Galen, one ophites or snakestone, and the other omhatites, which last I have not been able to find in any Greek dictionary.\n\nAlb\u012br\u016bn\u012b\u2019s work is mentioned by H\u0101j\u012b Khalfa, Fluegel\u2019s ed., V. 110, No. 10,263. It is there called Kitab-as-\u1e63aidalat, which is translated by Fluegel as \u201cliber botanicae theoreticae.\u201d In Dozy\u2019s Suppl\u00e9ment, p. 856b, \u0635\u064a\u062f\u0644\u0629 saidalat is given as meaning drugs. Possibly the translator of the work is the \u201cAb\u016b Bikr-e\u1e63 Saidd\u0101n\u012b\u201d of H\u0101j\u012b Khalfa, IV. 417 and V. 461. In the first of these references Ab\u016b-bikr is described as a lawyer, but in the second he is entered as a lexicographer and grammarian, and this tallies with the translator\u2019s predilection for verbal questions, as shown by the disquisition in the preface about the etymology of \u1e63aidana. Unfortunately H\u0101j\u0101 Khalfa evidently knew very little about him, and does not even give the year of his death.\n\nAs pointed out by Dr. Sachau (Introduction to the Arabic text of the chronology of ancient nations, p. 48), the \u1e62aidalat is not mentioned in Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b\u2019s own list. That list was made in 427 H. (1035), and Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b lived for thirteen years afterwards, dying on 2nd Rajab, 440 H. (11th December, 1048). He must therefore have written the \u1e62aidalat between 1035 and 1048.\n\nThe MS. was copied in 1190 A.H. (1776) by Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad Sam\u012b\u2018 of Dihli.\nART. XIII.\u2014The Ris\u0101latu'l-Ghufr\u0101n: by Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 al-Ma'arri. Part II, including Table of Contents with Text and Translation of the Section on Zanda\u1e33a and of other passages. By REYNOLD A. NICHOLSON.\n\n(Continued from p. 101.)\n\nAs for \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 b. 'Abdu'l-Kudd\u016bs, though his zanda\u1e33a has become notorious, he did not avow it (and knowledge belongs to God alone) until he was convicted out of his own mouth. The following verses are ascribed to his father, 'Abdu'l-Kudd\u016bs:\n\nHow many a visitor hath Mecca brought to perdition! May God raise Mecca and her houses!\nMay the Merciful refuse sustenance to her living inhabitants, and may Mercy roast her dead [in hell-fire]!\n\n\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 had a son who was charged with zanda\u1e33a and imprisoned for a long time. These verses are said to be his:\n\nWe went forth from the world, though we belong to it; and we are neither the living in it nor the dead.\nWhenever a visitor comes to inquire for us, we rejoice and say,\n\"Here is one from the world!\"\n\nHis recanting, when he perceived that his execution was at hand, was a piece of trickery. And God bless Mu\u1e25ammad, for it is related of him that he said, \"I was sent with the\n\n1 A contemporary of Bashsh\u0101r. They were put to death in the same year, 167 A.H. See Weil, Geschichte der Chalifen, ii, 106 seq.\n2 Ibn Khallik\u0101n, Translation, ii, 465, attributes them first to Ab\u016b'l-'At\u0101hiya, and then to \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 himself.\nsword, and weal is with the sword, and weal is in the sword, and weal is by the sword.\" And in another \u1e25ad\u012bth, \"My people shall not cease to flourish while they bear swords.\" Twas the sword that impelled S\u0101lih to affirm the truth and caused him to renounce his pernicious belief. This is one of God's signs, which is only revealed to the miscreant soul when her time has indubitably passed by and her profession of faith will not be accepted at this juncture. She believed not before. Folly has its light drizzle and its heavy rainfall.\n\nWith regard to al-Kass\u0101r, he was a fool in the block and a fool in the chips. Had he pursued an attainable truth, he would have been saved from the poison that he swallowed, but our natures are ranged against us and none may avoid the appointed doom. He whose name is connected with chests is held to be a zindik. I suppose that he is the person, known as Mans\u016br, who appeared in 270 A.H. and made a long stay in Yemen. In his time the singing-girls used to play on the tambourine while he chanted:\n\nO thou, take the tambourine and play, and blason abroad the virtues of this prophet!\nThe prophet of the Ban\u016b H\u0101shim has departed, and the prophet of the Ban\u016b Ya\u02bfrub has arisen.\nNo more is it behothing to run at \u1e62af\u0101 or to visit the Tomb at Medina.\nWhen the people pray, do not thou stand up, and if they fast, do thou eat and drink.\n\n1 Kor. vi. 159.\n2 Hamd\u016bn Kass\u0101r (ob. 271 A.H.) may possibly be meant. He was the chief of those \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs who call themselves Malamatis, and gave his name to the sect of Kass\u0101ris (\"Att\u0101r, Tadh. al-Awliy\u0101\u02be, Brit. Mus. MS., f. 195 sqq.; Nafah\u0101tul-\u02bfUms, p. 67). But one would hardly expect to find him in this company or described in these terms, and I regard the proposed identification as doubtful.\n\n3 His name was the carpenter. See below.\n4 See Kay's Yaman, p. 191 sqq. and p. 323. Ibnu'l-Ath\u012br, viii, 22, calls him Rustam b. al-Husain b. Haushab b. D\u0101dh\u0101n al-Najj\u0101r.\n5 In Kay's Yaman, p. 199, these verses are ascribed to Mans\u016br's colleague, 'Al\u012b b.

O my mistress, what an excellent creed!\u00b9\n\nNow may the execration of all who join in execrating evildoers light upon the adherents of this gospel! This class of men (God curse them!) seek by various methods to enslave the vulgar. They are eager to claim divinity, without substantiating their pretensions; nor do they shrink from what is abominable, but when they know that a man is distinguished\u00b2 [by intelligence] they invite him to that which, in the abstract, is worthy of praise. There was in Yemen a man who retired to the seclusion of his castle, employing as intermediary between himself and the people a black servant whom he had entitled Gabriel. One day this servant murdered his master and went off, whereupon some irreverent wit remarked: \"Blessed is God in His height. Gabriel has fled from iniquity, and he whom ye assert to be a Lord lies murdered on his throne.\" It is said that he was urged to this deed by the shameful services imposed on him. When one of this sort aspires, he is not content with being an im\u0101m or a prophet. No! he mounts upward in falsehood, and his drink is the foul water beneath the film.\n\nThe Arabs of the Ignorance were not guilty of such criminal and disorderly practices. Rather did their minds lean to the opinion of the sages and to the wisdom of the\n\n\u00b9 Kay renders, \"and its use is now hallowed by the law.\" But this is impossible for metrical and other reasons. cf. Hariri (ed. De Sacy), p. 539, l. 2.\n\n\u00b2 \u1e6dim\u012br and \u1e25\u0101jir are distinctly written in the M.S. In a passage below (p. 165) the forms \u1e6dim\u012br and \u1e25\u0101jir occur, and perhaps they should be restored here.\nancient books. For most of the philosophers were without belief in prophecy and paid no heed to those who affirmed it. Rabi'a b. Umayya b. Khalaf al-Jumahi had an affair with Ab\u016b Bakr al-Sidd\u012bk (may God have mercy on him!), in consequence of which he fled to R\u016bm, and it is related that he said:\n\nP. 161. I fled to the land of R\u016bm, undisturbed by the abandonment of evening and midday prayer.\n\nBut do not omit to bring me a morning-draught of wine; for the purest of wine is not forbidden by God.\n\nIf Taim b. Murra has been given the command among you, there is no good in the land of \u1e24ij\u0101z or in Egypt.\n\nAnd if my 'isl\u0101m' is the truth and the right way, lo, I renounce it in favour of Ab\u016b Bakr.\n\nMen showed themselves so versatile in error that at last they considered the claim of divinity allowable. That was to push infidelity to its extreme point and to collect sin in the largest bottles. The people of the Ignorance only rejected prophecy: they went no further. When 'Umar b. al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b (God have mercy on him!) cleared out the 'Covenanters' from the Arabian peninsula, the emigrants were sorely distressed, and it is said that one of the Jews of Khaibar, known as Sadid b. Adkan, spoke these verses thereupon:\n\nAb\u016b Hafs attacks us with a whip. Not too fast! A man now rises, now sinks.\n\n\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0628\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0631\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u0636\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u064a\u064ain \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u064a\u0641\u064a \u0648\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0641 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u0647\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0648 \u0648\u0630\u0644\u06a9 \u0641 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0639\u0634\u0631 \u0648\u0641\u06cc \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0636\u0631\u0628 \u0648\u0644\u062f\u0647 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u0631\u0647 (Marginal note in MS.).\n\n2 From whom Ab\u016b Bakr was descended (W\u00fcstenfeld, Genealogische Tabellen, R.).\n\n3 \u0647\u0648 the \u0636\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u06a9\u06cc\u062f (Wright, Grammar, ii, 265).\n\n4 I.e. \"he is welcome to it: much good may it do him!\"\nIt would seem that you never followed the loaded camels of a hard driver;\u00b9 that you might get your fill.

I learn from travellers to those parts that certain sectaries are to be found there at the present day, every one of whom asserts that he is the expected Ka'im and receives a tithe of property to gratify his base ambitions. And I have been told that the \u1e32arm\u0101\u1e6d\u012bs have a house at al-A\u1e25s\u0101,\u00b3 from which, as they pretend, their im\u0101m will come forth, and they keep a saddled and bridled horse standing at the door of that house, and say to the common and vulgar, \u201cThis horse is for the Mahdi\u2019s stirrup: he will mount it when he appears with a marvellous truth.\u201d Their object in all this is to cajole and amuse with vain promises and manoeuvre themselves into power and lead men astray. And one of the most wonderful stories that I have heard is this:\u2014Long ago a chieftain of the \u1e32arm\u0101\u1e6d\u012bs, when his time was come, gathered his followers round his deathbed and began to say to them: \u201cI am now resolved to depart. I had already sent Moses and Jesus and Muhammad, and I cannot but send another.\u201d Be he accursed! He committed the greatest infidelity at the moment when it behoves the infidel to believe and the traveller to return to his final bourne.\n\n\u00b9 The camels driven at full speed would be likely to spill a portion of their cargo. M\u0101kit is explained below (p. 166) as meaning \u2018one who runs from town to town.\u2019 But here it seems rather to be derived from the phrase \u0645\u064e\u0643\u0650\u064a\u062a\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0634\u064e\u0651\u0631\u0652\u0637\u0650.\n\n\u00b2 The proverb is \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u064a\u062a\u0643 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u064a \u0623\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0645\u064f (Freytag, ii, 879).\n\n\u00b3 In Bahrain.\nAs regards Walid b.

Men are ill-trained indeed that they follow the religion of the ass!_\n\nSurely 't was an amazing time that made the like of him an im\u0101m and invested him with imperial power; and though it may be that other monarchs hold the same, or nearly the same creed, they keep it hidden and fear [to divulge it]. These verses are also ascribed to him:\\(^4\\)\n\n_I boast myself to be Walid, the Im\u0101m, trailing my striped robe and listening to words of love._\n\n_I drag my skirt to the chambers of my mistress, and I heed not those who blame and rebuke me._\n\n_There is no pleasure save in listening to a singing-girl and in wine that leaves a youth intoxicated._\n\n_I do not hope for the houris in the next world.

This is not a unique example of human folly; nor [would a parallel be wanting] even if the gazelle had been worshipped in its lair. Fortune has lighted on an ape ere now and caused it to obtain the place of honour, and the people cried, \"Bow to the ape in its season!\" And I shrink from the sin of mentioning the ape which the governors, it is said, used to come and salute in the time of Zubaida; and Yaz\u012bd b.

Poor wretch! he was beguiled by Ab\u016b Ja\u2018far.3 He did not put his milk in a large skin. Sometimes you may find a man skilful in his trade, perfect in sagacity and in the use of arguments, but when he comes to religion he is found obstinate, so does he follow the old groove. Piety is implanted in human nature; it is deemed a sure refuge. To the growing child that which falls from his elders' lips is a lesson and abides with him all his life. Monks in their cloisters and devotees in the mosques accept their creed, just as a story is handed down from him who tells it, without distinguishing between a true interpreter and a false. If one of these had found his kin among the Magians, he would have declared himself a Magian, or among the S\u0101bi\u0101ns, he would have become nearly or quite like them. When Reason is made guide, it does a good turn to the thirsty traveller by quenching his thirst. But where is he who will patiently submit to the laws of Reason and polish his intelligence till it attains a perfect lustre? Alas! that quality belongs to none upon whom the sun rises or who lie rotting in their graves, unless there be one unique among his kind, marked by completeness of superiority.

And these verses are quoted:\n\n*Come, give me wine to drink, O wise one, for I am not of opinion that I shall be raised to life.*\n*Seeest thou not how the Shi'ites are distracted and beguiled by Ja'far from their religion?*\n*I was seduced by him for a while; then a secret revelation appeared to me.*\n\nAnd they quote also:\n\n*I went to Ja'far for a time, but I found him treacherous and cajoling,*\n*Drawing the chief power to himself and pulling everyone to his own side.*\n*But if your pretensions had been true,\\(^2\\) your murdered ancestor\\(^3\\) would never have been dragged [in the dust].*\n*May none of you gain experience by age, and may your lives be short, for your misfortunes are sufficient!*\n\nThe \u1e24ul\u016blis are next door to the doctrine of metempsychosis. I had the following story from one of the leading astrologers in Harr\u0101n, who stayed some time in our city. One day he went out with a party of pleasure. They passed an ox ploughing, and he said to his friends, \"I am sure that this is a man who was known in Harr\u0101n by the name of Khalaf,\" and began calling to him, \"O Khalaf!\" The ox happened to low; whereupon he said to his companions, \"Don't you see, I told you the truth?\"\n\nAnd it was related to me, concerning another believer in metempsychosis, that he said: \"I saw my father in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Shahrast\u0101ni, 124 seq.\n\\(^2\\) An ironical reference to Ja'far's title, 'al-\u1e62ad\u012bk.'\n\\(^3\\) Husain.\na dream, and he said to me, 'O my son, my spirit has been transferred to a one-eyed camel in so-and-so's troop, and I long for a water-melon.'

When I approached him with the melon, he took it like one who desires ardently.\" You see, my dear sir, with what a want of discrimination these men are cursed, and how they apply to a special case that which does not admit of such a restriction.\n\nAs to the D\u0101migh,\u00b9 I think it turned the head of him alone who composed it and claimed for it an impious succession. Among the Arabs there is a man known as Dam\u012bghu'l-Shai\u1e6d\u0101n;\u00b2 but this man [Ibnu'l-R\u0101wand\u012b] is like dried-up gossamer. The scandalous fact that it is famous for its oaths\u00b3 indicates a weakness of mind on the part of its author: does anyone listen to a screecher? M\u0101gh\u016bn is derived from the phrase magh\u0101ti'l-hirra, 'the cat miaued.'\n\nHe flung in my face a thing of which I, and my father too, am clear; and he flung from inside the well.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Houtsma, Zum Kit\u0101bu'l-Fihrist, Vienna Oriental Journal, 224, where it is described as:\n\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0637\u0628\u0639 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646\nIt was written to prove by its superiority of style that the Kor'\u0101n is no such miracle as Muhammadans generally consider it to be.\n\n\u00b2 I.e., harebrained, crazy. The form of the sentence seems to imply that a particular individual is referred to, but the author can hardly mean this. If, however, the statement refers to a typical individual one would expect:\n\n\u00b3 It is doubtful whether the MS. reads \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 or \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647.

See Freytag, Arabum Proverbia, i, 556.\nMay his stone recoil on himself and his woe in the next world long endure! Evil is that which is referred to R\u0101wand! For who can disparage\u00b9 Dab\u0101vand?\u00b2 He only rent his own garment and exposed his empty paunch to view. Heretic and churchman, conformist and nonconformist, are agreed that the Book brought by Mu\u1e25ammad (on whom be God\u2019s blessing and peace!) is a book that overcame and disabled and caused his enemies to shiver when confronted with it. It was not formed upon any model, and it excelled the most marvellous works of imagination.\u00b3 It was neither in poetical measure nor in the commonplace doggerel of the camel-driver. (The m\u0101ki\u1e6d is he who runs from town to town.) I am told that a similar claim is made on behalf of a woman at K\u016bfa.\n\nI have heard it related that some partisans of Ibnu\u2019l-R\u0101wandi declare him to have been the abode of deity and to have been divinely inspired with knowledge. And they falsely attribute to him many superhuman qualities, which the Creator and all reasonable men attest to be silly inventions. But, for all this,\u2074 he is an infidel and not reckoned among the noble, the pious. The following lines by him are quoted (no God-fearing instructor is he!):\n\nP. 167. Thou didst apportion the means of livelihood to Thy creatures like a drunkard who shows himself churlish.\n\n\u00b9 Or perhaps rather, \u201cWho can kindle a fire in Dab\u0101vand?\u201d i.e. attain to so great a height. Cf. Arabum Proverbia, ii, 518.\n\u00b2 The well-known mountain near Teher\u0101n.\n\u00b3 The above passage forms a strange comment on the fact \u201cthat Ab\u016b\u2019l-\u02bfAl\u0101 took up the challenge of the Kor\u02bean, and wrote a rival work, which he thought only required \u2018to be polished by the tongues of four centuries of readers\u2019 to be equal to the sacred volume\u201d (Margoliouth, Introduction, p. 36). It is almost impossible to believe that this censure of Ibnu\u2019l-R\u0101wandi was penned by one who had already committed the same impiety; unless it is to be regarded as a singularly inept and ungraceful palinode: for why should Ab\u016b\u2019l-\u02bfAl\u0101 sit in the chair of Satan rebuking sin? If the work in question was later than the Ghulfr\u0101n (which seems unlikely), he must have known that he already stood condemned by his own words. But such a violent revolution of opinion in a man of three-score, though far less damaging to his character, is also less credible than the alternative hypothesis that he used Ibnu\u2019l-R\u0101wandi as a scapegoat to divert popular indignation from himself. Either view is beset with difficulties, and one would like to end the matter by declaring that Ab\u016b\u2019l-\u02bfAl\u0101 must be the victim of a calumny. The evidence, however, is strongly against this solution.\n\n\u2074 \u0645\u0639 \u0647\u0630\u0627 = \u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652 \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627.\nHad a man made such a division, we should have said to him,\n\"You have swindled.

And when madness\nseizes any outrageous pretender, does he not always meet\nwith fools to lead astray?

(The \\(khauf\\) is a little leathern \\(iz\u0101r\\), of which\nthe lower edges are split, worn by young girls.) He\nclaimed to be a prophet and made ludicrous revelations,\nand displayed therein the obstinacy of a quarrelsome\nwoman. He had some cotton in his house. \"My cotton,\"\nsaid he, \"will not burn\"; and he bade his daughter\napply a lighted wick to it. It caught fire, and the\nwomen ran out of doors, while the neighbours gathered\nto try if they could extinguish the flames. I was told by\neye-witnesses that he used to laugh immoderately, without\nany cause and though nothing surprising had happened.\nOn being asked why he laughed, he answered to this effect,\nthat men rejoice in a brief separation [from the celestial\nworld]: how, then, as regards union with the grace of God?\nHe was evidently mad; his imbecility is not concealed.\nAnd he found disciples in the foolish, and denied the\nrevelation of the prophets until he was put to death in\n\u1e24alab (God be her guard!).

All good is in Thine hands.\"\n\nThe second sort has two varieties: (a) rajaz, (b) munsarih. The following is an example of rajaz:\u00b3\n\nLabbaik! Thine is the praise and the kingdom. Thou hast no companion, save a companion that belongs to Thee. Thou art his lord and the lord of what the father of girls at Fadak possesses.\u2074\n\nThis is a talbiya of the Ignorance. In those days there were idols at Fadak.\n\n\u00b9 The following passage, with which I conclude the present article, is of great interest. Ya'k\u016bbi (ed. Houtsma), i, 296 seq., gives a number of talbiyas, but none of these, with two partial and trifling exceptions, will be found here.\n\n\u00b2 The first kind of rajaz contains six feet: when four are dropped, the verse is called manh\u0101k; when three are dropped, mashl\u016br.\n\n\u00b3 This talbiya, except the last line, occurs in Shahrast\u0101n\u012b, 434; Wright's Reading-book, 151.

Fadak is a place in the Hij\u0101z. \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u062a seems to refer not to the father of the victims, but to the god, who may equally well be called their father according to Arabic idiom.\nAnother example [of rajaz] is:\n\n*Labbai, O giver of plenty! Labbaik from the Ban\u016b Namir! We come to Thee in the year of dearth, hoping for an abundant rainfall that will make the dry watercourse a rushing torrent.*\n\n(b) *Munsarih.* Of these there are two kinds: (a) the two final letters are quiescent, e.g.:\n\n*Labbai, Lord of Hamd\u0101n! Whether distant [from Thy shrine] or near, We come to Thee with swift she-camels, easy to manage. We come seeking Thy bounty, Traversing the valleys towards Thee, hoping for the grace of forgiveness.*\n\n(\u03b2) Two quiescent letters are not combined, e.g.:\u00b9\n\n*Labbai from Bajila, the honoured, the powerful (a fair tribe is she!), That brings to Thee an intercessory offering in hope that Thou wilt make her prevail!*\n\nAnd in some cases different rhymes are used: e.g., in the talbiya of Bakr b. W\u0101\u2019il they relate as follows:\u00b2\n\n*Labbai in very truth, in devotion and abasement! We come to Thee for counsel, we come not for gain.*\n\nThe third sort has two varieties: (a) rajaz, according to the opinion of Khalil; e.g., in the talbiya of Bakr it is related:\n\n*Labbai! Were not Bakr Thy defender, men would give Thee partners and would deny Thee. Bands [of pilgrims] from our tribe come to Thee always.*\n\n\u00b9 Ya\u02bfk\u016bbi, i, 227, cites:\n\n\u0644\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0646 \u0628\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0642 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064f\u062e\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0647\u0650\n\n\u00b2 \u064a\u064f\u0634\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0643\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0643\u064e \u064a\u064f\u0634\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0643\u064f\u0643\u064e app. = though it may be translated \u2018make Thee a partner with other gods.\u2019 Examples of \u0643\u0641\u0631 with the accusative occur in prose.\n(a) two quiescent\n\nof Hamd\u0101n:\n\nclansmen that\n\nof kingly race\n\nHearken,\n\ncommunity.\n\nthose who read\n\nin rhyme.

Aufrecht, Oxford, fol. 254*), where is narrated, with variants, the legend elsewhere attributed to Udayana: \"y\u0101\u1e25 patitv\u0101 gir\u014d \u015br\u0101\u1e47\u0101d avyayah, tanmat\u0101\u1e41 dhruvam yadi ved\u0101\u1e25 pram\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 syur, bh\u016by\u0101t k\u0101 cin na me k\u1e63atih.\" The Buddhists do not accept this ordeal: \"saugata\u015b tv abhrav\u0101m: idam na pram\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 matanairmaye, manimantraus\u0101dhaire evam dehurak\u1e63\u0101 bhaved iti.\" The king does not yield to this (rather conclusive) argument, but he manages a new experience, asking: \"What is hidden in this basket?\" The Buddhists do, of course, know that there is a serpent. But a divine voice is heard: \"This serpent is not a serpent, but Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\" Therefore the king gives orders for the slaughter of the heretics (vadh\u0101ya \u015br\u0101tvividvi\u015b\u0101m).\n\nThe story of the serpent in the basket is well known from T\u0101ran\u0101tha.\n\nThe legend of Udayana\u2014Brahmin and Buddhist falling from the top of a mountain\u2014is interesting from its conclusion. The Naiy\u0101yika conqueror, being a murderer\u2014for the benefit of the creed\u2014is not approved of by the priests of Jagann\u0101th, and he does not conceal his anger. \"The following couplet, which has not been traced beyond oral tradition, at once illustrates the irreverence of the Hindu mind and shows that the Ny\u0101ya is prized as the stronghold of theism. The verses are reported\u2014falsely, it is hoped\u2014to have been uttered by Udayana \u0100c\u0101rya: ai\u015bvaryamadamatto 'si, m\u0101\u1e41 avaj\u00f1\u0101ya vartase: upasthit\u0113su bauddhesu madadh\u012bna tava sthitih... but let the Buddhists show themselves, and upon me will depend thy very existence.\" (N. Nilakantha Gore: \"A Rational Refutation of the Hindu Philosophical Systems,\" p. 6, note. Mr. C. H. Tawney has given me this curious reference. See also Barth, Bulletin, 1899\u20131900, 2, 32, n. 4; J.B.T.S., iv, 1, p. 21.)\nbelieve them to be only a fiction, but they must be looked upon as of little historical importance. The war is really elsewhere; it is between the philosophical systems (darsana), not between the magicians (mantra-vid).\n\nThe doctrinal debate is essentially a philosophical one: the magister dirit argumentation cannot be used, and it appears that Dign\u0101ga's adversaries have been obliged to submit to his controversial axiom, that is to say, \"a doctor cannot be beaten, except by such way of reasoning as is in accordance with his own point of view.\"\n\nWe do not fully trust the legends on the Indian St. Bartholomew, ruled over by Sankara and his fellow-workers; but we know that the prize of the fight was an important one. The intellectual doctor had to accept his winner for a pure 'master.' The conversion or apostasy, it must be added, was not very hard. Brahmins and Buddhists, these two classes, are the products of parallel intellectual evolution; they had many points of agreement; and the Buddhist Truth's kingdom, that is, the sphere of the supreme (vividh\u0101ra), is large enough to allow easy accommodation.\n\nThe importance of those logical and oratorical contests is beyond my doubt. The prosperity of Buddhism seems to have varied with its doctors' fortune\u2014there were hundreds of scholar-monks in the large catholic Sangha, when the Dign\u0101gas, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, Candragominus, were giving the Good Law its chief authority; falling almost into decay under the weak successors, mean magicians, and of a poor doctrine. Therefore, one must insist on the great interest these disputes would offer to the Indianist, who wishes to know them with some details. The two schools, in all their strength of their maturity, were\n\n---\n\n1. For a convenient account of Dign\u0101ga, see Madhyamakacaryt\u012b, fol. 9b, p. 372; Sadagiro Sugura, \"A Study of Indian Logic,\" p. 34, Un. of Pennsylvania.\nfighting each other; philosophical questions of capital consequence were being discussed. The Buddhists, so to speak, champions of the \"free examination\" (libre examen), are distinguished from the other sects by the indelible character of a definite creed, and by the somewhat revolutionary appearance of some of their essential dogmas. But, up to the present time, we have had nothing to base our conclusions upon except hypotheses. T\u0101ran\u0101tha, like many a chronicler, prefers the marvellous stories to the doctrinal expositions. On the Buddhist darsanas we knew almost nothing but what Colebrooke, the first and no doubt the greatest of Indianists, taught us some sixty years ago. The Sarvadar\u015bana and the famous commentary on the Brahmas\u016btras were the only authorities to draw from. On the Buddhist side the Sanskrit documents are very few; they were left a long time untouched or unknown. The courageous explorations of Schiefner, Wassilieff, and others, interesting as they are, throw little light on the momentous matter.\n\nBut things are going now another way. Not to speak of several collections, the Bibliotheca Indica, the Vizianagaram S.S., the Chawkhamba S.S., give us in a handy form the works of the high masters and the commentaries of their pupils\u2014honest, eloquent, and learned men\u2014the \u015ar\u012bdharas, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimisras, V\u0101caspatimisras.\n\nWe find in the Bh\u0101mati the whole of a quotation from the \u015a\u0101listambas\u016btra; in the Ny\u0101yav\u0101rttika we find a precise reference to some old canonical definition of the pudgalav\u0101da.1 \u015aa\u1e45kara mentions the famous text, \"What does the Earth rest upon? . . . . What does the Wind?\"2 In a chapter of the Ny\u0101yaratn\u0101kara are twenty quotations ascribed to the 'Bhiksu,' fourteen of which, at least, are to be read in the fifth chapter of the Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya by Dign\u0101ga. The T\u0101tpary\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101 and the M\u0101dhava's well-known compilation show their high value by numerous passages extracted from\n\n---\n\n1 Bouddhisme, Notes et Bibl., p. 43, n. 1 (from the Mus\u00e9on); J.R.A.S., 1901, p. 308.\n2 \u015aa\u1e45kara, 2, 2, 24; Abhidharmakok\u016bra, 13* (Burn., Introd., 449); Madhyamakav\u1e5btti, ad vii, 25. Cf. Aitareya Br. 11, 6, 4.\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya of Dharmak\u012brti. And lastly, Dharmottara and his Ny\u0101yabindu were both known to V\u0101caspatimi\u015bra.\u00b9\n\nHow could we doubt it? Those books are circumstantial books, books of polemic. So says V\u0101caspatimi\u015bra: \u201cVatsy\u0101yana has written a commentary on the Ny\u0101yas\u016btras; but that commentary (bh\u0101sya) has been discussed by Dign\u0101ga; and it was to answer that powerful antagonist that Uddyotakara made his new commentary on the same S\u016btras (v\u1e5bttikas).\u201d\n\nNot less rich, indeed, in precious references is the Jaina literature, as the learned pandit K. B. Pathak has conscientiously established.\n\nIt seems unquestionable, if we trust T\u0101ran\u0101tha\u2014and a short examination of Tandjur confirms the Tibetan chronicler\u2014that Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti were fortunate enough to endow their co-religionists with a complete new set of philosophical principles. Thanks to those doctors, the canonical dogmas of \u201cuniversal momentariness\u201d and of \u201cno existence of a soul\u201d (k\u1e63a\u1e47ikatva, nair\u0101tmya) were provided with a logic, with a psychology, with a theory of the understanding. Since Brahmins and Buddhists start from directly opposite tenets, no wonder is it to find them in manifest conflict concerning the definition of perception, the essence of individual and universal, the normal use of reasoning, the final emancipation. But not to speak of the historical meaning of those strong though subtle conceptions, we shall find abundant food for our curiosity in the varied turns of a war in which every blow is warded off, in which each party, if uncertain to win, is, at least, sure not to be irremediably conquered.\n\nThe above prolegomena seem necessary, firstly, to show with a full light how much needed are the researches to which we venture to call attention (those researches, it must\n\n\u00b9 See the transl. of the S\u0101rv\u0101dars\u0101, s., Musson, 1901.

Professor Harapra\u015bad \u015aastri, in his last report (1895-1901), has given a short but interesting notice of two little treatises by Ratnakirti, Apohasiddhi, K\u1e63a\u1e47abha\u1e45gasiddhi.\nbe admitted, will not get their full value before the Tibetan translations of \u015a\u0101stras and V\u1e5bttis have been duly studied); secondly, to make any mistake impossible: for the question I shall endeavour to develop is certainly not to be neglected, but it is only one of the many doctrinal topics the \u0100c\u0101ryas of both parties have explained.\n\nThe question bears on the authority of the Vedas and of the Buddhist \u0100gamas, or, to use the technical word, on the 'authority of the Verbum,' the \u015aabdapr\u0101m\u0101nya.\n\nThe problem is a difficult one, for it implies the investigating of a more general question, namely, the question of the pr\u0101m\u0101nya, or the validity of the means of proof\u2014the very nucleus of Kant's or of Descartes' philosophical systems. We shall not investigate here this last question, which would carry us too far.\n\nAs far as the \u015aabda is concerned, Sir John Muir, in the third volume of his \"Original Sanskrit Texts,\" has given a complete survey of all the texts published up to 1873; Professor Cowell just touches it, but throws a great deal of light upon it in his translation of the Jaimini-dar\u015bana; Dr. G. Thibaut, in the introduction of his Arthasa\u1e43graha, led us to hope he would some day examine the opinion of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas on the matter; Mah\u0101dev R\u0101j\u0101ram Bodas treats it in a few words in his ample commentary on the Tarkasa\u1e43graha.\n\nI can only point out the final result of a long scholastic elaboration. There are two orthodox systems, not to dwell on the minute divergences, that of the Ved\u0101ntists and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sists on one side, that of the Naiy\u0101yikas on the other.\n\n---\n\n1 See \u015aa\u1e45kara\u1e0digvijaya, \u0100nand. S.S., Comm. ad viii, 81. \u015aa\u1e45kara was paying a visit to the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka Mandana; as he asks some washing-women the way to the \u0101\u015brama, they give the following answer: \"Where you shall hear the birds singing: svata\u1e25 pram\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41, parata\u1e25 pram\u0101\u1e47am... there is the house.\"\n\n2 On the philosophical problem, Advaitabrahmasiddhi, p. 185, is interesting.\n\n3 Sanskrit Texts, second edition, 1873.\n\n4 Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e43graha, transl. 1882.

That God, \"who never can mislead or be misled,\" has revealed the truth.\\(^1\\) And where is that revelation to be found if not in the Veda, mould and pattern of the sacrifices, of the castes, of the social and cenobitic life?\n\nFor the former (M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sists and Ved\u0101ntists) the Vedas are eternal; they have no personal author (apauru\u1e63eyatva).\n\nThe \u015aabda, that is, the Verbum or Veda, is a means of proof quite different from that our senses, or reason, can furnish us. Its object\u2014be it either the Brahman, the endless and boundless substance, as the Ved\u0101ntists believe, be it the Dharma, or the sacrificial law, as the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sists contend\u2014is above any common or worldly pram\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nThe Ved\u0101ntists call the sm\u1e5bti, or tradition, inference (anum\u0101na), and for them the word perception (pratyak\u1e63a) has the same meaning as \u015bruti (revelation),\\(^2\\) which has a self-authority, this authority being recognized by an internal intuition.\n\nThe Vedas are eternal and the origin of knowledge.\n\nAgainst the opinion of all the Veda-followers (vedavid), M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sists or Naiy\u0101yikas, the Buddhists maintain that the \u015babda or \u0101ptopade\u015ba (the word of a truthful witness)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) V\u0101caspatimisra, Ny\u0101ya v\u0101rtika t\u0101tparyatik\u0101, p. 300: \"It shall be established, in the fourth book of the s\u016btras, that from the existence of created things (k\u0101rya), viz. the body and the world, can be logically demonstrated the existence of a creator of these creatures, able to create them, knowing the essence of everything, unpolluted by the impression of the matured passional action, and endowed with a supreme pity. But, when this compassionate Being sees that the creatures are ignorant of the method to realize their own welfare and to avoid bad destiny, that they are consumed by the fire of numerous sufferings, he must be grieved by the sufferings of the creatures. Being so grieved, knowing the way of salvation, is it possible that he did not teach this way, or that he did teach this way erroneously? Therefore, this compassionate Being, after having created the earth and the four classes of human beings, did certainly teach them the way to attain happiness and to avoid the reverse: he cannot stay without teaching it (na hy anupadi\u1e63ya sthatham arhati). And the teaching of this father-like compassionate Being is accessible to the Devas, to the \u1e5asis, to the men; it must be accepted by the four classes.\n\n\\(^2\\) Deussen, p. 96: \"Das Offenbarte ist ihm (\u015aa\u1e45kara) das Offenbare.\" Cf. \u015aa\u1e45kara, 1, 1, 2 (\u0100n.

Udayana and V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra bring forth Dign\u0101ga\u2019s dilemma:\n\n\u201cWhere is the \u0101ptopade\u015ba\u2019s strength to be found? In the witness\u2019s undoubting trustfulness, or in the specific truth of his learning? In the first instance, it is a case of inference. (Witness is to be relied upon, for he knows the facts and he does not lie.) In the second, the evidence comes from an actual perception. (The truth of the teaching is made obvious by its accordance with the facts.)\u201d\n\nLet us see, however, if the dissidence is as deep as it seems to be. On the one hand\u2014the Brahmins do not deny it\u2014the eternity of the Vedas or the existence of God, the Veda-inspirer, has to be established by proofs. On the other hand, the Buddhists consider their own s\u016btras as eternal, and one of the most commonly used names for Buddha is the Omniscient. Both make an equal use of \u201cFaith resting on Reason,\u201d and the polemic, apart from the logical dispute, grows up unchecked on the solid ground of fact.\n\n\u201cThe Buddhists,\u201d says Kum\u0101rila, \u201cgive the Veda a human origin; on account of the principle of the universal momentariness they deny its eternity; but, strange to say, they claim eternity for their own books (\u0101gamas)!\u201d\n\n---\n\n1 \u0100ptav\u0101ky\u0101visam\u0101v\u0101das\u0101m\u0101ny\u0101d anum\u0101nat\u0101 = Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya, ii, 5, fol. 5*, 4 (Tandjur, Mdo, xcv):\n\nyid-ches thsig ni mi-balu-ba\nspyi-las rjes-su-dpag-pa-nid.\n\nCf. iii, 2 (fol. 7*, 2); T\u0101tp. 138. 2; V\u0101rttika, 61. 13; Ny\u0101yas. i, 1, 17.\n\n2 \u201cAs it has not a specific object, the \u015babda is not a specific pram\u0101\u1e47a.

Though I am not the best, admitting the possibility of a higher form of learning, because of my superiority in the past, they deem me the authority in their opinions; at the same time, I feel very honored, they glorify him for having discovered the doctrine of the ancient respect for living beings. The Buddha's opinions, they say, are eternal. But I wonder whether these words written?\n\nIt seems, however, that where I perceive, then the\n\n[Text continues with paragraphs and footnotes]\nPrakrits were, at his time, considered as recent degenerations of the Sanskrit.\n\nThat philological argument is capital; but Kum\u0101rila goes on, for it is of interest to overthrow Buddhism in the very core of the Good Law, in the dogmatic conception of the Teacher. \"This word of Buddha,\" so he says, \"is well known: 'May all sins done in the world during this iron age fall down upon my head; but may the world be saved!'\" In that saying we find the whole of the Great Vehicle's glory.

Cf. Kandali, 397 fine; Bh\u0101mat\u012b, 322. 4.\nthat we want?\" And we shall prove that Buddha knows the Dharma. This Buddha's saying, 'All compound is momentary,' and any other texts dealing with ascertainable matters, are easily shown to be exact; therefore, the dogmatic principles, or v\u00e9rit\u00e9s de foi, those, for instance, that bear on the worshipping of relics or caityas, must needs be exact, since they have been said by Buddha himself.\"\n\nKum\u0101rila answers: \"The way you reason does not make the authority of Buddha certain; on the contrary. That Buddha, in matters of common experience, might have said the truth, no wonder; but as soon as his teachings pass those limits, where does his authority come from? Since you appeal for a certainty to your own examination, you make Buddha's authority useless. Shall I show you with a more striking instance how irrelevant is your reasoning? I shall use your own syllogism: 'Buddha is not omniscient, since I say he is not; for the fire burns when I say it does.' To affirm safely that Buddha is omniscient, one must needs be oneself omniscient.\"\n\nThen Kum\u0101rila: \"Buddha, you say, has made himself a teacher. What for? For his own, or for other people's advantage? In both cases he is led by r\u0101ga, by desire, or some p\u0101\u1e6dhas; and an omniscient being cannot be pa\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (r\u0101gar\u0101n).

Kum\u0101rila does not mention the Pur\u0101nic hypothesis of the Buddha avatar of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, that is, avatar of malevolence\u00b2 or of pity, according to the way it is looked at. More clever still, and with a sort of anticipation of Professor Herman Oldenberg's theory, he thinks that the Vedas, misunderstood, contain the germs of all heretic systems: \"The doctrine of the non-existence of the external world, that of the universal momentariness, and that of the non-existence of a soul, are derived, he says, from the Upani\u1e63ads.\"\u00b3 Therefore we have to recognize the authority of those nihilistic doctrines only so far as they lead us to dislike the sensible world.\n\nBut, \"That indebtedness to the Veda is fruitless for those heretic leaders (t\u012brtha\u1e45karas): they give the Veda up since they are rationalists.\" \"\u015a\u016bky\u0101 does not teach the Dharma\n\n\u00b9 \u015alokav\u0101rt. 86. 10 (Comm.): \"tasmin nirv\u0101y\u0101p\u0101re 'pi tattva\u1e41 ni\u1e25sram\u0101navai kudya\u1e0dibhyo 'pi des\u0101na nisarant\u012bti cet . . .\" See the s\u016btras quoted Bodhicary\u0101r. f. 276: \"tasmin dhy\u0101nasam\u0101panne cint\u0101ratnavad \u0101sthite | niscaranti yathak\u0101ma\u1e41 kudya\u1e0dibhyo 'pi des\u0101nah | t\u0101bh\u012br j\u012bj\u00f1\u0101sit\u0101n arth\u0101n sarv\u0101n j\u0101nanti m\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25 | . . .\" And: \"te tath\u0101gatamukh\u0101d \u016br\u1e47\u0101k\u014d\u015b\u0101d u\u1e63\u1e47i\u1e63\u0101d gh\u1e5b\u1e47im niscarant\u0101 \u015br\u0101vanti . . .\" Cf.

The Buddhist \u0101gamas did not regulate the laws of caste and of the Brahmanic life; they know nothing of the rites of life from the cradle to the grave. Those \u0101gamas, of which the authority is vainly supported, depend for all that concerns the practical life upon the \u015aruti, the Sm\u1e5bti, the Itih\u0101sas, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. Buddhists themselves do not fear to say, 'It is the custom (s\u0101\u1e41v\u1e5btam etat),' and they follow, in practical life, Revelation and Tradition. The Vedas, and the Vedas only, are observed by the three castes. In order to keep their meaning unaltered, the \u1e5asis, one after the other, have written the several limbs of the Vedas and the Treatises (\u015a\u0101stras). Buddha's words do not, in fact, interfere with the every-day life of men.

Kennedy.\n\n\"Up from Earth's centre through the seventh Gate\nI rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate;\nAnd many a Knot unravel'd by the Road;\nBut not the Master-knot of Human Fate.\"\n\nTwo questions, the early contact of Buddhism with Christianity, and the origins and character of Gnosticism, have attracted much attention of late. Although these questions are independent of each other in the main, they happen to join hands in the case of the great Gnostic Basilides. I propose to show that the famous scheme of that arch-Gnostic was an attempt at fusing Buddhism with Christianity, and thus to throw some light upon the one question and the other.\u00b9\n\nThe universal charity enjoined by the Buddha, and the occasional parallelisms of doctrine or story in the Buddhist writings and the Old and New Testaments,\u00b2 have awakened much curiosity regarding the possible contact of the two religions. So much so, indeed, that the Congr\u00e8s International d'histoire des religions has called attention to the matter by a special resolution.\u00b3 Moreover, such speculations are not devoid of a certain historical basis. Asoka states in an inscription, four times repeated, that between 260\n\n\u00b9 Basilides occupies a considerable place in all works dealing with early Church history or the Gnostics. For the special bibliography regarding him see Bardenhewer's Patrologie, and the admirable article on Basilides by Dr. Hort in Smith's Dict. of Christian Biography.\n\n\u00b2 A useful collection of parallel texts will be found in \"Christianity and Buddhism,\" by Dr. T. Sterling Berry (S.P.C.K., London).\n\n\u00b3 Upon the motion of M. Camerlynck, of Amiens, the Congress agreed to the following resolution: \"That at the next Congress attention be drawn to the relations which may have existed, at the commencement, between Buddhism and Christianity.\"\nand 256 B.C. he despatched preachers of 'the law' to five Greek kings. At the other end of the chain we have the proselytizing efforts of Nestorian and Buddhist monks in Central Asia between the fifth and twelfth centuries A.D., which resulted in that curious syncretism of religious ceremonies and legends ascribed by the good Abb\u00e9 Huc to the machinations of the devil. The widespread story of Barlaam and Josaphat is the earliest literary proof of this syncretistic activity. But Barlaam and Josaphat were unknown saints before the seventh century A.D. Prior to that date we have nothing certain, although much has been conjectured. Unfortunately these conjectures seldom conform to the historical conditions of the problem. And three reasons may be adduced to show that before the birth of our Lord any considerable importation into the West was an unlikely thing. Firstly, Indians and Arabs kept up a lively exchange across the Indian Sea, but Indian merchants and sailors were not to be found beyond the shores of Arabia and the Persian Gulf; while the trade by land was chiefly in the hands of Bactrians, and the Bactrians were zealous Zoroastrians until converted to Buddhism by the Kushan kings in the first century A.D. In either case direct intercourse with Alexandria and the Roman Empire was practically nil. Secondly, the agents who might be supposed to carry Buddhism to the West were few. We have none of the soldiers, the officials, the women and slaves who spread the rites of Isis and Mithras, and for that matter Christianity itself, throughout the\n\n1 Epigraphia Indica, vol. ii. The latest transliteration and translation of the text with which I am acquainted is given in McCrindle's \"Invasion of India by Alexander the Great,\" pp. 372-374. I understand that it was supplied by the late Dr. B\u00fchlert.\n\n2 Some of the Celtic gods are occasionally represented as sitting cross-legged in an attitude resembling that of Buddha. These rude representations probably date from the first or the beginning of the second century A.D.; and are in any case posterior to the time of Julius Caesar. The resemblance is limited to the general attitude; the figures themselves with their symbolism are purely Gallic, and they cannot have been borrowed from Buddhism, since figures of Buddha are unknown in India until the first century A.D. (v. pls. xxv and xxvii, \"La Religion des Gaulois,\" par M. A. Bertrand, pp. 314 and 318). The swastika and the aureole were not peculiar to Buddhism, and the swastika travelled to Gaul before Buddha was born.\nEmpire. Hindoo merchants and sailors alone visited the West, and of these the merchants only were Buddhist. Thirdly, down to the battle of Actium India received much of its civilization and its impulse from the West, from Persia first and foremost, and in a lesser degree from the Bactrian Greeks. It was the long peace with the Parthians inaugurated by Augustus, and the destruction of Aden and of the Arab monopoly of the Indian trade, in the time of Tiberius or Claudius, which first opened up those direct communications between India and the Empire that lasted with such brilliancy for two centuries. Therefore, although it would be unsafe to deny the possibility of an earlier contact between Buddhism and Christianity, the probability of it is exceedingly small. We must look to the two centuries succeeding Tiberius for the earliest fruitful contact between the two religions, and it is precisely to this era that Basilides belongs.\n\nIf Buddhism was to influence Christianity, Gnosticism might be supposed to furnish the most likely channel. Gnosticism was anterior to Christianity, and was open to Indian influence. In the period immediately preceding and following the commencement of the Christian era Syria, Mesopotamia, and Babylonia became a breeding-ground of religious ideas. The ferment was primarily due to Hellenism, which had weakened or destroyed the national religions and stimulated thought, but it stimulated chiefly through the antagonism it evoked. And in this fermentation, which affected Essenism and the later developments of the Zoroastrian religion as well as Mithraism, and the Syrian solar cults, and sowed the germs of the future Kabbala, the Jewish and the Syro-Babylonian religions were the strongest elements and took the leading part. Their disintegration\n\n---\n\n1 I have discussed the earliest communications between India and the West in an article on \"The Early Commerce of Babylon with India,\" in J.R.A.S., 1898, p. 241 ff.; and I gave a sketch of its subsequent history in a lecture delivered before the Royal Asiatic Society in March, 1900. I hope some day to deal with the whole subject in a more extended form. For the opening up of the Egyptian trade with India under Augustus, v. Mommsen's masterly account in the \"Provinces of the Roman Empire,\" vol. ii, p. 298 ff., Eng. trans.\nand their contact created a religious syncretism which strove to unite Judaic monotheism and the problems of the Fall and the origin of sin with Babylonian ideas of the spirit world, of destiny, and the future life. The process was a natural one, the work of nameless men, and it took many forms and created many schools, Jewish and pagan, some of which took the name, and all received the collective designation, of Gnostic. Morally this syncretism was apt to run into those extremes of asceticism and libertinism so characteristic of the Syro-Babylonish cults. Intellectually it followed two main tendencies. It took from the ancient religions a theory of the spirit world which was essentially magical. The disembodied soul wandered by the dark path or the bright, through many realms and among many perils, from which the magic word alone could save it. Magic is essentially cosmopolitan, and it was this magic which in after days gave popular Gnosticism its vitality, when it was transported to the West, and its polypous faculty of assimilating strange religions. The Syrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians, the peoples who held the belief in a future life with the greatest earnestness and plenitude of knowledge, were the peoples among whom Gnosticism flourished longest. The second great subject of Gnostic speculation was the Fall, the origin of man, and the origin of sin\u2014questions which reveal their full significance only from the monotheistic standpoint. Hence the important part which theories of the flesh, of cosmogony, of emanation play in all these Gnostic systems.\n\nIn this fluid mass of primitive Gnosticism it is possible to find many Indian analogies. We have similar theories of emanation, the same threefold division of souls, the same\n\n---\n\n1 We must not conceive of the Gnostic schools either now or afterwards as in any way akin to the Stoa and the Porch or the other schools of Greek philosophy. They are of the Oriental type, the religious family, the Mohant and his Chelas, the master and his disciples. The only Hellenic thing about Gnosticism is the approximation, by certain schools in later days, of the Gnostic mysteries to the Greek. But the Greek mysteries had borrowed most of their contents from the East; they were mainly Oriental themselves, even the Eleusinian, and they represent the most Oriental aspect of the many-sided Greek intellect. Here, therefore, a rapprochement was easy.\nbelief in transmigration, and an almost identical scale of ascent for the soul after death. Emanation theories are not peculiar to India, the threefold division of souls is natural, the belief in transmigration may have been derived from India, but has nothing specifically Indian, and was moreover always subordinate to Chaldaean astrology and planetary fate; but the resemblance between the Indian and the Gnostic history of the soul is striking. According to the Ch\u0101ndogya Upanishad the soul of the ascetic\u2014the initiated\u2014travels upwards by the way of the Gods through ever-increasing spheres of light. From death it passes to the sunlight, from the sunlight to the region of day, from the day to the bright half of the month, and thence to the summer, when the sun travels north; further on it passes through the world of the Gods, of the sun, of the lightning, to enter the world of Brahma, from which it will return no more. Virtuous souls that lack initiation travel by the darker path\u2014the way of the Fathers. Through the smoke of the funeral pyre they ascend to the night\u2014the dark half of the month, the winter of the year, the world of the Fathers, the aether and the moon, where the Devas feed upon their spiritual substance; and they descend again to earth by the way they had trodden. All this corresponds closely to the ascent of the Gnostic soul, and the soul of the simple, by the right-hand path or the left through the Archon-guarded spheres of light. By the right-hand path the Gnostic attains the eternal silence\u2014the divine pleroma\u2014and will never return. The obscure path on the left\u2014the dishonourable hand\u2014leads the simple through the intermediate worlds, where the Archons feed themselves by sucking out his light, and he is presently returned, shorn of his brightness, to the earth. Now whether these coincidences be accidental or not, they have nothing Buddhist. The ordinary Gnosticism may owe something to India, with which it was in contact, but what it owes\n\n1 v. Professor Rhys Davids' article on \"The Soul in the Upanishads,\" J.R.A.S., 1899, pp. 79-80.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nis due to popular mythology and to the Vedanta; Buddhism contributed nothing to it.\\footnote{Lassen's attempts (Ind. Alter., iii, p. 379 ff.) to connect Gnosticism with Buddhism have not met with general acceptance: v. Garbe, \"Die Sankhya-Philosophie,\" p. 96 ff. The resemblances are, some unreal, some superficial, and others are more easily accounted for otherwise. The emanation theories of the Gnostics are totally opposed to everything Buddhist.}\n\nOriginal Gnosticism had two great divisions, the Jewish and the pagan, and the pagan schools were either magical or ascetic, as the speculative element or the moral tendency prevailed. Judaic Gnosticism first came into contact with Christianity, but it was the pagan Gnosticism which most materially affected and was affected by it. In reality neither the Judaic nor the pagan Gnosticism underwent any fundamental change. The popular Gnostic schools, however fluid, assimilative, indeterminate in details they might be, always conformed to one or other of a few main types, and these types essentially Eastern. But in the commencement of the second century A.D. we come upon a new phenomenon. Christianity had entered the world as a mighty vivifying power, but it wanted a philosophy. Basilides and Valentinus, then Marcion, and later still Tatian and Bardaisan, supplied it with one on a so-called Gnostic basis. These men were endowed with fresh and vigorous minds, in no ways inferior to their contemporaries, and if Tatian be excepted, the intellectual equals of Plutarch, Epictetus, and Dio. They were each the founder of a philosophic school, their influence was far-reaching, and some of them had illustrious successors; but their philosophy was far above the comprehension of the commonplace vulgar that took their name, and it has come down to us only in detached fragments preserved by Clement or Origen and others, or in imperfect pr\u00e9cis, which often represent the average belief of the common Gnostic rather than the teaching of the founder. Here, then, we have a twofold task, to reconstruct the system and to explain the phenomenon. Are we to say that Christianity had set out to conquer the Hellenic world, and that the Hellenic\nworld required a philosophy? But these philosophies were presented, not to outsiders, but to Christians. Is this Gnosticism, then, an intrusion of Hellenic philosophy into the Christian faith? These arch-Gnostics were men of learning and of culture, they had the Hellenic spirit in so far as they were philosophers, and the method, the form, the symmetry, above all, the inward necessity they felt for a philosophy, is Greek. But the substance? The controversialist Fathers of the Church, men of Hellenic education, and unacquainted with Oriental theosophy, gave various answers. The majority declared that the arch-heresiarchs had borrowed and disguised ideas from every Greek school of thought, as Plato and Aristotle in turn had stolen their ideas from Moses and the Hebrew Prophets. Others stoutly put down everything to the religion of Zoroaster. The opinions of the moderns are equally divided. It is undeniable that Valentinus and Marcion largely employed Oriental elements, but Basilides is usually held to have been \"steeped in Greek philosophy,\" although a few, on the strength of the \"Acta Arebelai,\" have claimed a Zoroastrian origin for him. It is the purpose of the present essay to prove that the system of this supposed coryphaeus of the Greek philosophy was Buddhist pure and simple\u2014Buddhist in its governing ideas, its psychology, its metaphysics; and Christianity reduced to a semi-Buddhist ideal for result. The moment we apply this key every fragment takes its place, the system is complete, and we can reconstruct the whole. If the form is Greek the positive Greek element is altogether wanting. Christianity was represented to the Hellenic world as a \"barbarian philosophy\"; and the first attempts at its intellectual comprehension, the first efforts of dogma, were based on a philosophy profounder and more venerable far than the juvenile wisdom of the Greeks, a wisdom which the Greeks regarded with the reverence of ignorance. Gnosticism is not pure Hellenism, as some say; it is rather pure Orientalism in a Hellenic mask. If the 'true Gnostic' of Clement is a Hellen, the genuine Gnostic of Basilides and Valentinus is a thorough Oriental.\nLet me state at the outset what I consider it is that I have to prove. I assert, then, and shall try to show, that Basilides had opportunities of becoming acquainted with Buddhism; next, that pessimism and transmigration, the two basal doctrines of his philosophy, are held by him in specifically Indian forms, which cannot have been derived from any other quarter; and lastly, that the system is developed on Christian-Buddhist lines with many Buddhist coincidences, great and small. And the correctness of this view is proved by the fact that the master key of Buddhism effects what no other key has done; it resolves difficulties, reconciles conflicting opinions, assigns each fragment to its proper place, and gives us a complete, symmetric, and intelligible whole, a revivification and restoration of one of the greatest of Gnostic philosophies.\n\nBasilides flourished at Alexandria under Hadrian (117-138 A.D.), and is said to have been the disciple of Glaucias\u2014the \"interpreter of S. Peter.\" He belonged therefore to the second generation after the Apostles, and to the great age of the Gnostics (Clem. Strom., vii, 17. 106, p. 325). Possibly he was somewhat senior to his contemporary, Valentinus, and his death occurred before or soon after the accession of the elder Antonine. His great work, the \"Exegetica,\" in twenty-four books, is said to have been \"a commentary on the Gospel\"; and Origen says that he composed odes\u2014probably like those of the Gnostic Valentinus and of Bardaisan. The doctrines of Basilides were to be found not only in his own \"Exegetica,\" but in the numerous writings of his son and chief disciple, Isidore.\n\n1 According to Baur, Basilides laid special stress upon free-will, according to Neander upon fate; Dr. Hirt finds his psychology \"curious\"; some hold Basilides for a Pantheist, others find dualism in him. These and other hypotheses are all justified, explained, and modified by the Buddhist theory.\n\n2 Clement affects to doubt the tradition, but apparently only from a general suspicion of such claims. There are no chronological difficulties, the tradition was accepted by the Basilidians in Clement's time, and as they professed to base their doctrines on the secret teachings of S. Matthew and not of S. Peter, they had no reason to invent a fable.\n\n3 A comparison of Clem. Strom., vii, 17. 106, and Justin Martyr, Ap. i, 26, makes this almost certain.\nAnd when we have said this, we have said all that is known with certainty regarding him.\n\nBut we may advance a little further by conjecture.\\footnote{A very ingenious person might conjecture that Basilides is merely a translation of Rajput. The conjecture would be on a par with a good many others that have been hazarded. But unfortunately the Rajputs are not heard of in India for five centuries after this.} Epiphanius will have it that he was a Syrian, but Epiphanius wished to connect him with Menander, and made other wrong guesses about him. And as Basilides named his son Isidore after the great tutelary goddess of Alexandria,\\footnote{Egyptians usually retained their heathen names after their conversion to Christianity, even although the name was taken from a god. Ammonius, Serapion, Pachomius, are instances in point. But I am not sure that they gave heathen names to children born after the conversion of the parent. Isidore must have been born when his father was a comparatively young man, and probably before Basilides joined the Christian Church.} we are probably correct in considering him a Hellenized Egyptian. Basilides had a perfect command of the ordinary Alexandrian Greek and wrote it with vigour, but his predilections, if not his training, were mainly Oriental. Eusebius and Theodoret tell us, on the authority of Agrippa Castor, that Basilides had a special regard for the prophecies of Barcabbas and Barcoph and other barbarous apocryphal writers.\\footnote{Euseb. H.E., iv, 7; and Theodoret, Haer. Fab., i, 4.} His son Isidore wrote a commentary on the Prophet Parchor, and quotes the prophecies of Ham, and although Isidore knew something of Aristotle, he studied by preference the poems of Pherecydes, the singer of the wars of the Titans and the teacher of Oriental metempsychosis to the Greeks (Clem. Strom., vi, 6. 53, p. 272). It is clear that father and son took their stand on the wisdom of the East, and that the sources of their knowledge were unfamiliar to the Christian writers and historians.\n\nAlexandria, the home of Basilides and Valentinus, was the second city of the Empire in the age of Hadrian. It was famous for its situation and its sky, a marble-fronted city rising from the sands that fringe the shallow Egyptian sea. It was a city of harbours and dockyards, of broad streets and echoing arcades, of palaces and shady gardens.\nThe architectural magnificence and the variegated splendours of the royal halls and piazzas which lined the shore and overlooked the moving waters at their feet, fell not short of the subsequent glories of Venice; the Pharos and the Serapeum were accounted among the wonders of the world; and the town could boast of the tomb of Alexander and the mausolea of the Ptolemies. A city of commerce, of philosophy, of bustle, and of pleasure. Greeks, Jews, and Egyptians streamed noisily from their separate quarters to view the horseraces and the pantomimes; and charioteers, harpers, and flute-players, male and female, like the jockeys and the divas of a modern capital, were the idols of a witty and turbulent populace. Filthy cynics lay outside the temples or in the streets, exchanging coarse repartees with the jesting crowd. Dignified philosophers discoursed in private lecture-halls or wrote books (which have rarely survived) in cool libraries. But the chief occupation, although not the chief passion of the city, was trade. Dio Chrysostom calls it the world's agora, and Hadrian, or the pseudo-Hadrian, says that among the innumerable sects and cults which congregated there, one only was supreme\u2014the worship of 'hard cash.' The great corn ships for Rome were laden at the quays, and the piers were crowded with merchant craft from the \u00c6gean and Syrian seas, and from the distant Euxine. The bazars were filled with motley crowds, rough mariners, inquisitive Greeks, bearded Jews, and tattered Bedouin. Blear-eyed Egyptian boatmen and peasants thronged the canals. But being above all the great emporium of the trade with the East, Alexandria was the chief resort of Oriental merchants, and Dio Chrysostom, in an oration which he delivered to the Alexandrians in the reign of Trajan, when Basilides was a youth, gives us the following enumeration of them: \"I see among you not only Hellenes and Italians, and men who are your neighbours, Syrians, Libyans, and Cilicians, and men who dwell more remotely, Ethiopians and Arabs, but also Bactrians, Scythians, Persians, and some of the Indians ('\u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2), who are among the spectators,\"\nand always residing here.\"\u00b9 This colony of resident Indians must have been a colony of merchants from the west coast of India\u2014probably from Ceylon or Barygaza, the chief dep\u00f4ts of the Alexandrian trade. Colonies of this sort have been dotted along the shores of the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf from the earliest days of intercourse with India, and we have literary evidence of the existence of similar colonies in Socotra and Armenia in the first and second centuries A.D. We can therefore form a fair estimate of the character of this Alexandrian colony. Now Indian merchants, as a rule, have always been Buddhists or Jains. Buddhism was a merchant religion par excellence; there are few parables or birth-stories in which a Buddhist merchant does not figure,\u00b2 and Ceylon and Barygaza were head-centres of the Buddhist faith. If we find that Basilides was a Buddhist philosopher it is easy to discover the source from which he learned his philosophy.\n\nBefore proceeding with my exposition of Basilides' teaching, it is necessary that I should advert to, although I need not discuss, a question which has evoked much literary criticism. It is universally admitted that the accounts given us by Clement and Hippolytus are irreconcilable with those given by Iren\u00e6us and Epiphanius; and it is very generally, but not universally, admitted that while the former state the doctrines of Basilides himself, the latter are reporting the opinions of the later Basilidians. Personally I have no doubt of the correctness of this view, and I might shelter myself behind the authority of the greatest names.\u00b3 But it will be found that the question solves itself. If I discover Buddhist pessimism and transmigration in Clement, Buddhist metaphysics in Hippolytus,\n\n\u00b9 Dio Chrysos., Orat. xxxii, ad Alexandrinos (Teubner ed., vol. i, p. 413). I have said something of these Indian merchant colonies in \"The Early Commerce of Babylon with India\" (J.R.A.S., 1898, p. 269 f.).  \n\u00b2 Mrs. Rhys Davids gives a number of examples in her essay \"Economic Conditions in Northern India\" (J.R.A.S., 1901, p. 859 ff.), and it would be easy to extend the list.  \n\u00b3 Baur, Mansel, Hort, and others.\nand Buddhist psychology in both, it is evident that both are describing a single system\u2014the system of the master.\\footnote{The literary question is fully discussed in Dr. Hort's article. Clement wrote his \"Stromata\" at Alexandria some sixty years after the death of Basilides, and had excellent opportunities for knowing the facts. He gives extracts from the \"Exegetica\" and from Isidore's works; he repeatedly refers to or summarizes the opinions of Basilides and the Basilidians, using the terms usually as synonymous, and sometimes interchanging them. In one passage he pointedly contrasts the degenerate teachings of the later Basilidians with the doctrines of their master. Clement's object was ethical and practical, while Hippolytus dealt with the speculative part of the Basilidian philosophy. The two therefore seldom deal with the same subject, but where they do they agree. They also agree in undesigned ways, as, for instance, in the use of terms which had a technical significance in the Basilidian teaching, e.g., \\textit{\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}, \\textit{\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}, etc. The extracts given by Hippolytus are evidently from the \"Exegetica,\" although Hippolytus does not give the name of the work. Moreover, Hippolytus expressly distinguishes in one passage a work circulating among the later Basilidians from the works of Basilides and Isidore. The only serious objection to the general opinion is the Greek character (so-called) of the Hippolytian extracts, but if they turn out to be not Greek at all, but Buddhist, this objection vanishes.}\n\nIt must also be borne in mind that Basilides was a sincere Christian, utterly ignoring Buddha and all Indian mythology. If we forget this, we shall utterly misunderstand him. He adopts the Buddhist philosophy, but not the Buddhist religion; the Buddhist faith is nothing to him. And it is as a metaphysic, not as a religion, that Buddhism first penetrated to the West.\n\nI now proceed with the main subject of this essay\u2014the exposition of Basilides' teaching. I shall first consider the general presuppositions which lie at the root of all his doctrines. I shall then consider his Psychology, next his Metaphysic, and lastly his Theology.\n\nI. Presuppositions.\n\nThe Basilidian system is based upon certain fundamental conceptions of the nature of sin, of suffering, and rebirth.\n\n1. The universality of suffering is for Basilides the cardinal fact of the world. \"Pain and Fear are as inherent in human affairs (\\textit{\u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd}) as rust in iron.\"\\footnote{Clem. Alex. Strom., iv, 12, 90, p. 218. Clement denies the doctrine \\textit{\u03bf\u1f50\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f45\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f41 \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2 \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb} (i.e. the Basilidians) \\textit{\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f41 \u1f30\u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c3\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1fbd}, etc.}\nBuddha laid the same foundation\u2014\"Birth is suffering, old age is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, to be united with the unloved is suffering, to be separated from the loved is suffering, not to obtain what one desires is suffering.\" In brief, the conditions of individuality and their cause, the clinging to material form, sensations, abstract ideas, mental tendencies, and mental powers involve suffering.\" The universality of suffering is the fundamental fact, the extinction of suffering the goal, of the Basilidian theology.\n\n2. But Basilides' pessimism takes a distinctively Christian cast. If suffering accompanies all action, it is especially the concomitant of sin. This theory lies at the bottom of Basilides' famous paradox\u2014\"the Martyrs suffer for their sins\"\u2014a paradox which shocked the conscience of the Church, and was utterly perverted by Basilides' followers. Basilides thought no scorn of martyrdom; it had its consolations and was a good (\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd). But still the martyrs suffered for their sins, although they might be unconscious of them, or like the new-born babe might be innocent of actual transgressions. But why must the infant suffer? Why must the martyr have committed sin? Because,\n\n1 From the Buddha's First Sermon, translated in \"Buddhist Suttas.\" Compare Dhammapada, 186 ff.\n2 Basilides' views on martyrdom were grossly misrepresented. The extracts given by Clement (Strom., iv. 12. 83\u201385, p. 217) from the 23rd book of the \"Exegetica\" show this clearly. \"For I say that all those who undergo the aforesaid tribulations have undoubtedly sinned, though they be ignorant of it (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2), in other ways; but are led to this particular good by the goodness of Him who directs (them), being really accused of other faults (than those they have committed); so that they suffer not as malefactors for confessed iniquities, nor as the murderer and adulterer reproached by all, but as Christians\u2014a fact so consoling that they appear not to suffer at all. And even granting that the sufferer is entirely innocent of actual sin (which rarely happens), yet not even will this man suffer by the design of any (evil) power, (the orthodox held that persecutions were the work of the devil), but he will suffer as suffers the infant apparently innocent of sin.\" Further on Basilides says that as the infant, although obviously incapable of sinning, \"suffers because he has a sinful nature, and gains the benefit of suffering,\" so the perfect man, innocent of actual sin, suffers for his evil propensities. According to Clement, Basilides admitted that his argument applied even to the Lord Himself, although in the extract Clement gives us Basilides will not mention Him by name, taking refuge in the text \"none is free from stain.\" Dr. Hort has some excellent remarks on the whole subject.\nso Basilides says, suffering is the consequence and the proof of sin, if not of actual sin committed in this life, yet of an inherited tendency to sin; otherwise we accuse the Divine Constitution of the world. \"And I will admit anything,\" he cries, \"rather than admit that the Divine Constitution of the world is evil\" (\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4' \u1f10\u03c1\u1ff6 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f22 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f10\u03c1\u1ff6), (Strom., iv, 12. 84, p. 217).\u00b9\n\n3. And this leads us to the keystone of the Basilidian as of the Buddhist system\u2014the fatal law of transmigration which governs all things in heaven and earth. Every act produces fruit, so every life bears the burden of its fruitage in the following rebirth. \"Basilides lays down (\u03c4\u1f78 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b7 \u1f24 \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) that the soul has previously sinned in another life, and endures its punishment here, the elect with honour by martyrdom, and the rest purified by appropriate punishment\" (Clem. Strom., iv, 12. 85, p. 217). And again, \"If any, then, of the Basilidians, by way of apology, should say that the martyr is punished for the sins committed before this present embodiment (\u03c0\u03c1\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd\u03c3\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2), and that he will hereafter reap the fruit of his doing during the present life, for thus has the constitution (of the world) been ordained, then we would ask him,\" etc. (Clem. Strom., iv, 12. 90, p. 218). Origen says that Basilides interpreted Romans vii, 9 as an apostolic reference to transmigration,\u00b2 and he complains in his Commentary on S. Matthew iii that Basilides \"deprived men of a salutary fear by teaching that transmigrations are the only punishments after death.\"\u00b3 The Basilidians interpreted the phrase \"unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me\" of this series of rebirths (Clem.\n\n\u00b9 The Divine Providence (\u1f21 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1) plays a great part in the Stoic and rhetorical literature of the second century A.D., but it always applies to the universe, and not to the individual. With Basilides, Providence in the ordinary sense is an impossibility; he means by it the constitution of the world \"involuntarily willed\" by \"not-being God.\"\n\n\u00b2 Origen expressly mentions transmigration into beasts and birds. \"Dixit enim, inquit, Apostolus, quia ego vivebam sine lege aliquando, hoc esset, antequam in istud corpus venirem, in ea specie corporis vixi quae sub lege non esset, pecudis scilicet vel avis.\"\n\n\u00b3 Dr. Hort.\nAlex. Frag., 28, p. 338); and Basilides was logical when he said that the only sins which can be forgiven are involuntary sins and sins of ignorance (Clem. Strom., iv, p. 229). Every act is fruitful, and every sin of commission bears its fruit in a future life.\n\n4. We shall presently see that the Basilidian soul is not a simple, but a compound composed of various entities. These warring entities influence the actions of the man; and as some of them have the character of animals and others of plants (Clem. Strom., ii, 20. 112, p. 176) they explain how rebirth in another than a human form is philosophically conceivable. I notice more especially the transmigration into plants, because this is a specifically Indian doctrine, although found occasionally among savage tribes of the Eastern seas.\u00b9\n\n5. Man is enthralled in the fatal bondage of rebirth, but during the present life his will is free. This is stated in the clearest manner. \"If I persuade anyone that the soul is not a single entity, and that the sufferings of bad men are occasioned by the violence of the 'appendages' (a technical word of which more hereafter), then the wicked will have no small excuse to say I was compelled, carried away, involuntarily acted, nor did I will my deed, although the man was led by his lust for evil, and did not struggle against the compulsion of the 'appendages.' It behoves us to rise superior by virtue of our rationality, and to appear triumphant over the baser creature within us\" (Clem. Strom., ii, 20. 113, 114, p. 176). And again, \"Only let a man will to achieve the good, and he will obtain it\" (Clem. Strom., iii, 1. 2, p. 183). Man's will is free to act, but the consequence of his action is inevitable: that is the sum and substance of the doctrine.\n\n6. With the freedom of the will comes the possibility of salvation, but the elect alone are saved, and the mass of mankind will remain bound everlastingly in the endless cycle\n\n\u00b9 Tylor (\"Primitive Culture,\" 2nd ed., ii, p. 6) says that they may possibly have been influenced by Indian ideas. Ovid mentions transmigration into plants, but this is the only instance I can remember among Western writers.\nof causation and rebirth\u2014a subject which I shall discuss at length in connection with the Basilidian theology.\n\nThese are the fundamental tenets of Basilides, and they are also the foundations which the Buddha laid. The inherency of suffering in existence, its cause rebirth, the freedom of the will, the salvation of the few, and, (if I may anticipate,) nirv\u0101na form an essential and the most important part of both their systems. There is, however, a divergence from the outset in one point, and in one point only. The Buddha had a practical end in view; he wished to discover and to preach the mode of liberation. For Basilides the way of salvation had been found in Christianity, and his purpose is purely philosophical. The burden of existence weighs upon him; how shall he harmonize the constitution of the world and the universality of suffering, how \"justify the ways of God to men.\"\n\nBut granting the identity of Buddha's and Basilides' ideas of suffering and transmigration, it may be urged that the coincidence is natural and accidental, that the origin of sin formed the starting-point of every form of gnosis, and that transmigration was a theory known to Hellenes and Egyptians. I reply that pessimism, the inherency of evil in all action, was alien to Greek modes of thought, and was never the basis of any Greek philosophy; while it has always been a marked peculiarity of Indian speculations. And I next proceed to show that the Basilidian theory of transmigration is exclusively Indian. I have already pointed out that Basilides adopted that rare form of metempsychosis, transmigration into plants, universal in India, but sporadic elsewhere. But let that pass. It is with the various stages in the transmigration theory that I wish to deal.\n\nIt is usual to confound two very different sets of ideas, a series of rebirths and the temporary or permanent lodgment of a spirit in a foreign body. Most nature-religions assume that the gods can take the form of men or beasts at pleasure, and that certain men can change their shape into that of the inferior animals. Apollo and Athene,\nchanged for the nonce into birds upon a tree, overlook\nthe windy plains of Troy; or the transformations of Procris,\nof Narcissus, and of Daphne may serve for Greek examples.\nThe much-imperilled soul of the ancient Egyptian had to\nput on many an animal shape and many a disguise to escape\nits ghostly enemies on the road to the blessed fields of Aru.\nMen everywhere believe in lycanthropy, the wandering of\nthe soul in sleep, the power of witches to assume the shape\nof animals. In magic the process is reversed. Spirits no\nlonger assume inferior shapes alone: they have the power\nof putting on the higher forms of gods and demons; but\nwith this we are not here concerned. Suffice it to say that\nsuch temporary embodiments of the spirit in foreign forms\nrefer to a totally different line of thought from a series of\nrebirths. They belong to animism\u2014to the savage philosophy\nwhich distinguishes only between animate and inanimate,\nand which accounts for the travels of the soul in trance\nand dreams. They have nothing to do with the belief in\na future life.\n\nMetempsychosis properly so called is of three kinds. Men\nhave at all times and everywhere believed in the rebirth of\na departed spirit. The soul of the deceased returns to earth\nin the person of a new-born infant of the family, whose\nlooks and ways recall a thousand times a beloved memory.\nOr the soul may come to earth again in some stranger, the\ndouble of the dead. But this return of the soul is occasional\nand sporadic; it has not been systematized into a theory\nof the future life. It is a floating semi-conscious belief.\nAmong the great nations of antiquity only two advanced\nfurther on this path\u2014the Indians and the Gauls. Both\nheld the doctrine of a future life with firmness, they knew\nit in detail, and with both of them transmigration is the\nuniversal law of humanity.\\footnote{For Gallic and Celtic beliefs v. \"La Religion des Gaulois,\" par A. Bertrand, p. 270 ff., and Rhys Davids, Hibbert Lectures, 1881.} It is no part of the common\nAryan tradition (if such tradition or stock there ever was),\nnor does it occur in the earlier Vedas. The Greeks first\nlearned the doctrine from Pherecydes and Pythagoras; and these great doctors doubtless learned it from the Cymri or Cimmerians of Asia Minor, who taught them other Gallic lore. But there is a third stage in the history of the doctrine. From the universal belief of India the Brahmins evolved a profoundly philosophical theory peculiar to themselves. In the popular belief each successive transmigration is occasioned by, but is not the result of, the previous life. The Indian philosophers introduced the law of causality; causes are equalled by their effects; and each rebirth is the exact resultant of the preceding life. Transmigration is for them the reign of causal law in the spiritual world; it has the rigour, the universality, the invariability of Fate; it is the self-made destiny which overshadows man from the cradle to the grave: and it is this law which enabled Buddha, and Basilides after him, to explain the origin of evil, and the method of salvation.\n\nII. Psychology.\n\nFrom this digression, necessary to avert any suspicion of a non-Indian origin, I proceed to consider the Basilidian psychology. The Buddhist doctrine of personality has mightily puzzled modern scholars, and the Basilidian theory of the soul was equally puzzling to Clement. He compares it to the Trojan horse which was full of warriors, and a little further on he says that the Basilidians, like the Pythagoreans, believed in two souls (Strom., ii, 20. 113, 114, p. 176). Three passages contain all that we know of Basilides\u2019 psychology. The first consists of Clement\u2019s summary. The Basilidians \u201care accustomed,\u201d Clement says, \u201cto call the\n\n---\n\n1 Or more probably the Kh-batriyas.\n2 On the Indian ideas of transmigration v. chap. xiv of Dr. P. Deussen\u2019s excellent work \u201cDie Philosophie der Upanishad\u2019s\u201d (Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie, vol. i, pt. 2), and Garbe, \u201cDie S\u0101mkhya-Philosophie,\u201d p. 174 ff.\npassions Appendages,\\(^1\\) stating that these are certain spirits which have a substantial existence, having been 'appended' to the rational soul in a certain primitive turmoil and confusion, and that again other bastard and alien natures of spirits grow upon these, as of a wolf, an ape, a lion, a goat, whose characteristics (say they) create illusions in the region of the soul, and assimilate the desires of the soul to the animals: for they imitate the actions of those whose characteristics they wear, and not only are they familiar with the impulses and impressions of the irrational animals, but they even ape the movements and beauties of plants, because they likewise wear the characteristics of plants appended to them. Moreover [these Appendages] have properties of a particular state like the hardness of a diamond.\\(^2\\) (Strom., ii, 20. 112, 113, p. 176.) According to Clement, then, there is a rational soul (\\(\\gamma \\lambda \\sigma \\gamma \\mu \\epsilon \\eta \\psi \\nu \\chi \\eta \\nu\\)). There are also certain appendages (\\(\\pi \\rho \\sigma \\alpha \\rho \\tau \\eta \\mu \\alpha \\tau \\alpha\\)) adhering to it. These parasitic appendages are the various affections (\\(\\tau \\alpha \\pi \\alpha \\theta \\eta\\)) which have a substantial entity of their own (\\(\\pi \\nu \\epsilon \\nu \\mu \\alpha \\tau \\alpha \\tau \\alpha \\nu \\kappa \\alpha \\tau \\prime \\omega \\sigma \\iota \\alpha \\nu \\upsilon \\pi \\alpha \\rho \\chi \\varepsilon \\nu\\)). They are intermixed with the rational soul by a prim\u00e6val confusion, intermixed, be it noted, and not intermingled, since the whole process of evolution is to disentangle them. These entities, as well as the rational soul, remain always separate and distinct.\n\nThe second passage is the extract (Strom., ii, 20. 113, 114, p. 176) from the work of Isidore \"On the Attached (or Parasitic) Soul\" (\\(\\pi \\epsilon \\rho \\lambda \\pi \\rho \\sigma \\alpha \\phi \\nu \\omega \\upsilon \\psi \\nu \\chi \\eta \\nu\\)), already quoted in connection with free-will. From it we learn that the soul is not a simple entity, that it suffers from the violence of the parasitic appendages, and that it can rise superior to them by virtue of its rationality.\n\nThese extracts find their explanation and complement in the statements of Hippolytus (Haer., vii, c. 15, cf. vii, c. 12).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \\(\\pi \\rho \\sigma \\alpha \\rho \\tau \\eta \\mu \\alpha \\tau \\alpha\\), a technical word employed by Basilides and by Isidore. Tertullian translates it as 'appendices' ('ceteris appendicibus sensibus et affectibus,' Adv. Marc., i, 25); and Dr. Hort also refers to M. Aurelius, xii, 3, with Gataker's note. \\(\\tau \\alpha \\pi \\rho \\sigma \\alpha \\rho \\tau \\eta \\mu \\alpha \\tau \\alpha\\) might be translated as parasites which attach themselves externally.\n\n\\(^2\\) I have adopted Dr. Hort's translation with a few alterations.\nBasilides held that there were five separate entities in Jesus (and therefore in all the elect who are the sons of God). At His death the Sonship ascended into what, by anticipation, I shall call Nirv\u0101na; another part ascended to the Firmament, a third to the Aether, a fourth to the Air, and the corporeal part which suffered and died reverted to Formlessness, i.e. to matter. It would seem, therefore, that Basilides conceived of the elect, if not the natural man, as a compound of five entities\u2014the highest being the rational part (also called the subtle part and the Sonship), the lowest the material body. The resemblance of this conception to the Buddhist theory of the Skandhas is remarkable. Man is a compound, say the Buddhists, of five Skandhas\u2014or 'aggregates' as Professor Rhys Davids translates the word. The highest is reason, the lowest the material body. The other three, in an ascending scale, are the Sensations, Abstract Ideas, and Potential Tendencies. So far as one can judge, the Basilidian analysis of man is identical with the Buddhist.\n\nDid Basilides go further? Did he, like the Buddhist, deny the existence of the soul? We cannot say. Clement certainly talks of 'the rational soul,' as he naturally would; but Isidore neither mentions nor implies it, and he employs \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd when we should have expected \u1f21 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae. We learn from Hippolytus that the proper region of the \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae was the air; and in Basilides' fivefold division of man there is no room for a soul in the ordinary sense.\n\nI may here note the employment of two technical expressions, Ignorance and Formlessness (\u1f21 \u1f00\u03b3\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b1 and \u1f21 \u1f00\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1). The Great Ignorance which (as we shall see) makes the world content to exist without a thought of Nirv\u0101na is a translation of the Buddhist Avijj\u0101 (Avidy\u0101). Avijj\u0101 has a double aspect.\u00b9 It is at the root of all desire for a sensuous existence, and is therefore the origin of all evil. On the other hand, take consciousness away and there is\n\n\u00b9 For the double aspect of Avidy\u0101, v. Deussen, \"Die Philosophie der Upanishad's,\" p. 217 (Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie).\nleft neither knowledge of Nirv\u0101na nor feeling of suffering. It is with this latter connotation that Basilides talks of 'the great ignorance.'\n\nThe second word is Formlessness (\u1f21 \u1f00\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1), used six times in Hippol. Haer., vii, c. 14, 15, as an equivalent for the blind material world. Now the words R\u016bpam and Ar\u016bpam, Form and Formlessness, play a great part in Buddhist psychology, but with a different signification. Natural objects when present to perception have form; ideas presented to the reason are formless.\u00b9 The Basilidian \u1f00\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 is different, it corresponds more closely to the conception of Prakriti\u2014nature unperceived in consciousness.\n\nIII. METAPHYSICS.\n\nWhether Basilides postulates a soul or not, he certainly postulates a God. But his God is the most abstract, the most remote that ever was imagined. Like Philo and the Alexandrian Jews, the Gnostics, and the later Kabbalists, he declares the Absolute God to be unknowable and unutterable, unpredicable, inconceivable. But no one has equalled Basilides in the energy of his expression. He strains negations to the utmost. 'Not-being God' (\u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f41\u03bd \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2) is Basilides' name for Him. He will not use the article, \u1f41 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f41\u03bd \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, although Hippolytus does so. To assert that God exists is to affirm a predicate, and He who is unknowable is above all predicates. But there is an earlier stage than 'not-being God.' \"Was when was nothing,\"\u00b2 nor was that nothing any kind of entity, but in plain, unreserved, unequivocal language, there was altogether nothing. And when I say 'was,' I do not assert that 'there was,' but I merely indicate my meaning when I affirm that there was\n\n\u00b9 V. \"A Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics\" (translation of the Dhamma Sangani), Or.

Beside \u2018not-being God\u2019 there exists the world conceived as a seed-mass, posterior to Him in thought, but co-eternal with Him in reality. This seed-mass (\u1f21 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1) is conceived both as an ideal cosmic germ (\u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1) and as a mass of individual seeds, the world of actuality (\u1f21 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6), precisely as Prakriti bears the same double signification in the Sankhya philosophy.\u00b9 The relation of not-being God to the cosmic germ is described as follows:\u2014\u201cWhen there was nothing, neither matter, nor substance, nor entity, nor simple, nor compound, nor incomprehensible, nor imperceptible, nor man, nor angel, nor a God, nor anything that has a name, or can be perceived by sense, or conceived by mind, or what is of more subtle still, when every [predicate] has been removed, not-being God without or act of mind or sense, without plan, without purpose, without affection, without desire, willed to make the world. And when I say willed, I mean [an act] involuntary, irrational, insensible; and by the \u2018world\u2019 I mean, not the world of length and breadth [the world of space], and which existed subsequently, and has a separate existence, but the germ of a world (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5). And the seed of the world held all things in itself, just as a grain of mustard-seed contains within the smallest body all things at once [in embryo], the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves, the numberless seeds of other plants born of that one plant, each seed in its turn the parent of innumerable other seeds, a process many times repeated. Thus not-being God made a not-being world out of things that are not, casting down and depositing a certain single seed containing in itself the whole germ of the universe (\u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u1f10\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03bd)\u201d (Hippol. Haer., vii, 9). This cosmic seed,\n\n\u00b9 \u201cHinter der als Lingam individualisierten Prakriti steht die allgemeine, Kosmische Prakriti, ohne dass von ihr weiter die Rede w\u00e4re\u201d (Deussen, \u201cDie Philosophie der Upanishad\u2019s,\u201d p. 217).\nthis not-being world, is purely ideal, like not-being God; it is beyond all predicate; \"the not-being seed of the world which had been deposited by not-being God\" (Haer., vii, c. 9).\n\nFrom the transcendental cosmic seed we pass to the individual seeds which in their aggregate form the actual world. \"The non-existent seed of the world constitutes at the same time the germ of a multitude of forms and a multitude of substances\" (Haer., vii, c. 9). \"It had all seeds treasured up and reposing in itself just as not-being entities, and designed to come into being by 'not-being God'\" (Haer., vii, c. 10). But how existence evolves itself from non-existence Basilides cannot say. \"Whatsoever I affirm to have been made after these, ask no question as to whence\" (Haer., vii, c. 10). The Buddhists also asserted that from the non-existent the existent is evolved.\u00b9 But \"Buddhism does not attempt to solve the problem of the primary origin of all things. When M\u0101lunka asked the Buddha whether the existence of the world is eternal or not eternal, he made him no reply.\"\u00b2\n\nThe actual world, then, according to Basilides, is preceded by an ideal world deposited by an ideal God. But this is evidently a mere accommodation to the infirmity of human thought. We shall see hereafter that the world of actuality has no end. We may conclude that it had no beginning, and that creation is a mere fiction of the mind. But neither Basilides nor the Buddha definitely say so.\n\nFrom cloudland we pass to reality. This spawn of the world, this chaotic and conglomerated seed-mass, has all entities, all realities stored up, entangled, and confounded in itself. It evolves these entities by a process of discrimination and differentiation, and it has three fundamental qualities which correspond with the three Gunas. This last\n\n\u00b9 \"Nach der Ansicht der Buddhisten geht das Seiende aus dem Nichtsegenden hervor,\" says Garbe, quoting Vacaspatim\u012bcra (\"Die S\u0101mkhya Philosophie,\" p. 201).\n\u00b2 \"Buddhism,\" by Professor T. W. Rhys Davids, p. 87. Compare his \"Dialogues of the Buddha,\" pp. 187, 188.\nis evident from the description of the triple Sonship. We have the light or subtle (\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) and the dense = Sattvam and Tamas. Between these two is the second Sonship in the region of \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7 = Rajas. This seed-mass proceeds to evolve itself in obedience to a double law. First: each individual seed, eternal in itself, eternally acts in accordance with its original nature, and without exterior government or aid. \"The things which are generated are produced according to nature, as has been declared already by Him who calculates things future, when they ought [to be], and what sort they ought [to be], and how they ought [to be]. And of these no one is superintendent, or thought-taker (\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2), or demiurge; for sufficeth to them that calculation which the not-being One calculated when He made them\" (Haer., vii, c. 12). The second law is that everything ascends, and nothing descended. The whole scheme of salvation, according to Basilides, is founded upon this. \"Nothing descended from above,\" he says, speaking of the Gospel (Haer., vii, c. 13). And again, \"All things press from below upwards, from the worse to the better. Nor among things superior is any so senseless as to descend below\" (Haer., vii, c. 10).\n\nBasilides classifies all existences (\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f64\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) as either mundane or supra-mundane. The supra-mundane corresponds to Lokuttara, which is the same as the region of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a; the mundane includes everything below it. This is Basilides' primary classification, and it is also the chief division of the Buddhists. But we find another and\n\n---\n\n1 Basilides (or rather Hippolytus) does not give us the exact Greek equivalents for the second and third Gunas. The second Sonship is called \u1f21 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 [\u03cd\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7] (Haer., vii, c. 10). The third Sonship is the Sonship \"left behind in Formlessness\" (Haer., vii, c. 14). The second Sonship is less deeply embedded in the material world, and resides in the Aether, the region of the Great Archon (Haer., vii, c. 10 and 11).\n\n2 Prakriti, says Deussen, \"besteht aus den drei Guna's (am besten als Faktoren zu \u00fcbersetzen . . . ) Sattvam (das Leichte, Helle, Intellektuelle), Rajas (das Bewegliche, Treibende, Leidenschaftliche) und Tamas (das Schwere, Dunkle, Hemmende), und auf der verschiedensten Mischung der drei Guna's beruht die urspr\u00fcngliche Verschiedenheit der L\u012b\u1e45ga's.\" (\"Die Philosophie der Upanishad's,\" pp. 218-219.)\n\n3 Basilides divides \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f64\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4' \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74 \u03c8\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 (Haer., vii, c. 11).\nsubsidiary division, peculiar to Basilides, which carries us much farther. According to this there are five spheres. The highest is the region of 'not-being God,' of the supra-mundane, the \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1, of the Lokuttara, that is, Nirv\u0101na. It is separated from the mundane world by the second sphere, which is the Firmament\u2014the abode of the Holy or Limitary Spirit. The Aether forms the third sphere, the region called the Ogdoad, extending from the Firmament to the Moon. This is the sphere of the Great Archon, \"more potent than things potent, wiser than things wise,\" the unutterable. The fourth sphere embraces the region of the Air\u2014the Hebdomad and habitation of the Lesser Archon, whose name is speakable and who inspired the Prophets. Lastly, we have the Earth, the place of Formlessness and Matter, \"where men sit and hear each other groan.\" Each of these regions, or \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9, has its Treasury, and is filled with innumerable beings whose nature\n\n1 The not-being God and the first Sonship abide in the \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 (Haer., vii, c. 10). The Firmament is between the \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 and the Kosmos (\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd: vii, c. 11). It is the abode of the Holy Spirit, also called the Limitary Spirit (\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03cc\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1. \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, etc.: vii, c. 11).

The highest of these regions is the Ogdoad, the region of the Aether and the seat of the Great Archon (\u03b1\u1f55\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4' \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b4\u03cc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7, \u1f45\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2: \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f67\u03b4' \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f22 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f45 \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2: vii, c. 11). This region extends to the moon (\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c0' \u1f23\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u1f76\u03bd: vii, c. 12). The greatness of the Great Archon is frequently extolled: \"He is more ineffable than things ineffable, more potent than things potent, wiser than things wise, and his beauty surpassingly beautiful\" (vii, c. 11). He surpasses every entity except the Sonship left behind (vii, c. 11). He believes the Kosmos to be His creation, and that there is nothing higher than Himself (vii, c. 11). He is called demiurge and God (\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03b3\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03bd: vii, c. 12). The region below the Ogdoad is the Hebdomad, the region of the Air which extends from the moon to the earth (\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 . . . \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u1f00\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9: vii, c. 12); (\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f41 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f11\u03b2\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2: vii, c. 12). The second Archon, like the first, is administrator and demiurge (in appearance) of all subject to him (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2: vii, c. 13). He is the God of Abraham and inspired the Prophets (vii, c. 13). The Great Archon is \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2, \u1fe5\u03b7\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f22 \u1f10\u03b2\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 (vii, c. 13). The distinction between the two Archons, in Basilides' opinion, probably corresponded to the Gnostic distinction between Yahweh and Adonai. The Formlessness is the lowest sphere (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4' \u1f24\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f43\u03bd \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f21 \u1f00\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1: vii, c. 15). The Gospel comes first to the Ogdoad, then to the Hebdomad, and lastly to us (vii, c. 14). The body of Jesus reverts to Formlessness, and His psychical part to the Hebdomad (vii, c. 15).\nfits them for it. Some are destined to a further process of refinement and ascent; others have reached the final stage of which their nature is capable, and ascend no further. All this is partly Gnostic, partly the popular physics of the time, and Basilides uses Gnostic terms throughout\u2014Archon, Ogdoad, Hebdomad, Principalities and Powers, \u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1, and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9.\u00b9 But this fivefold division, combined with the law that nothing descends from the stage in which it is, enables him to present the world-process with a sharpness of outline and firmness of detail impossible to the Buddhists, whose spirits wander aimlessly through multitudinous worlds from heaven to earth, from earth to hell.\n\nIf now we return to Basilides' scheme of Metaphysics as a whole, with the exception of 'not-being God' and the fivefold division of the spheres, everything in that scheme is evidently Buddhist. It is impossible to mistake the general identity. Barth sums up the groundwork of the S\u0101\u1e45khya and Buddhist metaphysics thus:\u2014\"Instead of organising itself under the direction of a conscious, intelligent, divine being, the primary substance of things is represented as manifesting itself directly without the interposition of any personal agent, by the development of the material world and contingent existences. It is then simply, and by whatever name it may be called, the asat, the non-existent, the indeterminate, the indistinct, passing into existence\u2014chaos, in other words, extricating itself from disorder by its own energies. When systematised, this solution will on one side have its counterpart in the metaphysics of Buddhism, while on the other it will issue in the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy.\"\u00b2 \"The whole theory of the Basilidians consists of the confusion of a seed-mass, and the sorting and restoration into their proper places of things so confused.\"\u00b3 The cosmic germ, the derivation of existence\n\n\u00b9 Even the region (\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5: Haer., vii, c. 10) of the ineffable 'not-being God' had its treasury (\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2: vii, c. 14).\n\u00b2 \"The Religions of India,\" by A.

But can we go further? Can we, for instance, identify 'Formlessness' with Prakriti, and the conscious spirits in earth, air, and aether with Purusha? Like Prakriti 'Formlessness' is always single, while the spirits and entities of the Ogdoad, the Hebdomad, and the Earth are innumerable like Purusha; in the Indian and the Basilidian scheme the Purusha and the Prakriti are closely entangled and intertwined: in both they are capable of ultimate separation. But how far the identity of the two systems went, we cannot say; our evidence is very fragmentary, and we have no right to go beyond it:\n\nSo far I have followed Basilides upon purely Indian ground. I now turn to him as a Christian theologian.\n\n1 For Prakriti and Purusha v. Deussen, \"Die Philosophie der Upanishad's,\" pp. 216-219, and Garbe, \"Die Samkhya-Philosophie,\" p. 204 ff.\n\n2 Basilides' repute for Hellenism is mainly founded on his Metaphysics, but it does not amount to much. The attempt of Hippolytus to affiliate the architectonic ideas of the system upon Aristotle has long been abandoned; and modern critics are divided between Plato and the Stoic. 'Not-being God' and the 'not-being world' are expressions which go back through Philo to Plato, but there is little Platonism in Basilides' use of them. According to Plato that which is \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u1fb6\u03c2 is the ideal good; but the \u1f45\u03bb\u03b7 \u1f41 \u1f00\u03b8\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 of Basilides is the first stage of evolution from the Absolute; it is only in his Theology that 'not-being God' becomes the ideal good. Nor has the 'not-being world' any connection with the invisible world of the Platonic ideas; it is the embryonic germ, the cosmic Prakriti. The corrective power of suffering is a Platonic idea, but it is applied for the explanation of the value of martyrdom, and not to the suffering of the world. These ideas are common to Philo, Celsus, and Clement (\u1f41\u03b4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u1ff6\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b4 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2), and were part of the mental equipment of the time; they do not necessarily imply any knowledge at first-hand of the master. The word \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac is used by Plato (Timaeus, 73, c.) and by Aristotle with reference to Anaxagoras, but in neither case in the Basilidian sense. Baur has pointed out the analogies between Basilides and Anaxagoras. Anaxagoras starts his physical theory of the universe with an infinite number of seeds, but apart from this there is no resemblance between the two systems. The seeds of Anaxagoras are all specifically different from each other; they are moved little by little at a time by mind, which orders and arranges them. Order arises from their commixture, corruption from their separation. There is an express denial of fate and chance (Ritter, Hist. Anc. Phil., i, p. 284 ff., Eng. trans.). The alleged resemblances to Stoicism are based on the supposed Pantheism of Basilides, and are general. But 'not-being God' is not consubstantial with the world, and has no further connection with it after it is started. The Buddhist hypothesis alone meets all the requirements of the case.\nIV. Theology.\n\nFor Basilides was a sincere Christian in his own belief. He was probably not conscious of any sensible difference from the ordinary Christians around him, at least not of any difference greater than that which might reasonably separate a philosopher from a simple believer, except in one point only. He pointedly refused to accept the belief in our Lord's impeccability. He admitted that our Lord did not sin, but he would not say that His material body was not sinful; he would not say \"non potuit peccare.\" But in everything else he appears at first sight orthodox. He frankly accepted Christianity as a historical fact and as a rule of life. There is nothing docetic in his philosophy. \"Jesus was born,\"\u00b9 and \"all the events in our Lord's life occurred in the same manner as they have been described in the Gospels.\" Basilides was acquainted with a considerable portion of the New Testament. He quotes S. Luke and S. John, and the whole scheme of his theology is in reality little more than the Basilidian expansion of the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel. His great work the \"Exegetica\" is said to have been a Gospel commentary. He delights to interpret some of the Pauline Epistles, especially the Epistle to the Romans, and he appears to have known the Acts of the Apostles, 1st Peter, and the Epistle to the Hebrews. Moreover, he treats the Old Testament with a respect somewhat unusual among the Gnostics. His reverence for our Lord and his admiration of the moral law are marked characteristics of the man.\n\nNor is his exegesis, startling though it be, anything extraordinary in the age of Hadrian. Unlike Marcion and Valentinus, he did not violently alter or mutilate the text of\n\n\u00b9 It is always necessary to distinguish between Jesus and Chrestos in dealing with the Gnostics. Hippolytus uses the word 'Christ' in speaking of the Son of the Great Archon (vii, c. 14), but whether Basilides gave it this limited signification is not clear. The Son of Mary is always Jesus in the summary of Hippolytus.\nScripture, so far at least as we can judge. His canon of interpretation is that of most philosophers of his time, the same canon which Dio Chrysostom and Aristides apply to the Homeric poems, an arbitrary adaptation of the meaning to a preconceived philosophy. Nay, we might go a step further and say that, granting him his own interpretation, he might have accepted considerable portions of the Nicene Creed, had it then been formulated. At first sight he is the most orthodox of all the Gnostics; a Bible Christian one might almost call him.\n\nBut granting that Christianity was historically true, and an absolute rule of conduct, it wanted a philosophy. The age of Hadrian was enamoured of philosophy: it had just awakened to a general sense of human suffering, and as a rule it accepted in popular form the Stoic idea of a Divine Providence which governed the world. Christianity presented for the first time the problems of Humanity in a new and universal form. What is the origin of sin? what the method of salvation? The Basilidian scheme is an answer to these questions.\n\nBasilides bases his theology on the baptismal formula, the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. The \"Inconceivable and Blessed not-being God\" (Haer., vii, c. 13) is the Father. The Sonship (\\(\\eta\\) \\(\\nu\\) \\(\\iota\\) \\(\\sigma\\) \\(\\tau\\) \\(\\eta\\) \\(\\varsigma\\)) is consubstantial with Him (\\(\\delta\\) \\(\\mu\\) \\(\\alpha\\) \\(\\omega\\) \\(\\sigma\\) \\(\\tau\\) \\(\\iota\\) \\(\\sigma\\) \\(\\iota\\) \\(\\sigma\\) \\(\\o\\) \\(\\varsigma\\); Haer., vii, c. 10). The Holy Spirit is inseparable from, but not consubstantial with the Sonship (Haer., vii, c. 10). With this Basilides starts, and develops his philosophy by the aid of two ideas, the Sonship and the Evangel.\n\nThe Father is inconceivable, and above all created things or human predicates. The Sonship, on the contrary, is deposited in the cosmic germ, but being consubstantial with the Father, cannot stay there; it must be restored to communion with Him, and its evolution is the history of the world-process (Haer., vii, c. 10). But this Sonship is not single; it is a collective germ, containing the seeds of many Sons within itself, and according to the Basilidian metaphysic it ought to have a twofold division, the\nsupra-mundane and the mundane. But Basilides insists that it is threefold: \u1f26\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f40\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd (Haer., vii, c. 10). The refined or subtle Sonship (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2), free from all cosmic stain, ascends at once with the deposition of the seed in pre-cosmic time to the region of the Father (Haer., vii, c. 10); or in other words, seeing that the deposition of the cosmic seed is a mere figment of human thought, the primal Sonship was with the Father from eternity. The grosser Sonship (\u1f21 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1) is more or less entangled in the seed-mass and remains behind. But the more aetherial part of it, less heavily clogged, ascends (also in pre-cosmic time) to the region of the Great Archon, whom it illuminates and instructs. This is the second Sonship (Haer., vii, c. 10). With this second Sonship, however, must be classed the Son dwelling in the Hebdomad with the Archon of the aerial and psychic world (Haer., vii, c. 12). The third Sonship is deeply submerged in the material world of Formlessness, and first disentangles itself in the Son of Mary, the prototype of all the Sons of God on earth (Haer., vii, c. 14).\n\nBefore we go further we must pause a moment. It is clear that, under the Basilidian scheme, each region of Being (except the region of the Holy Spirit), required a Sonship for itself, whose business it was to illuminate and benefit that region; and this corresponds with the actual enumeration. Why, then, does Basilides insist on a threefold division? The logical division would have been twofold, the actual one is fourfold. Basilides was doubtless influenced by the doctrine of the three Gunas, but there was probably a Christian element at work. The first Sonship corresponds with the Son who \u201cis in the bosom of the Father from eternity\u201d; the second corresponds, in position at any rate, with the Son \u201cby whom all things were made,\u201d since this is called the Son of the Great Archon, who imagines Himself to be the Creator; while the third is the historical Christ.\n\nSince the Holy Spirit is inseparable from the Sonship\nthere must have been a tripartite division of the Holy Spirit also. Hippolytus mentions only one, the \u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 (Haer., vii, c. 11); Clement mentions a second, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 (Strom., ii, 8. 36, p. 162, and Frag., p. 337). The Limitary Spirit accompanies the first Sonship on His upward flight, but not being consubstantial with Him is left behind in the adjacent firmament.\\(^1\\) He has a distinct entity, although scarcely a distinct personality, and the Sonship is related to the Holy Spirit as a bird to its wing, or a pot of myrrh to the fragrance it exhales (Haer., vii, c. 10). The second and third Sonships are accompanied by the 'ministering' Spirit, but as the Spirit cannot descend from a higher to a lower sphere the 'ministering Spirit' of each must be regarded as distinct; and it is evident that when each Sonship finally ascends to the region of 'not-being God' the accompanying Spirit must be left behind in the region of the Firmament.\n\nThe second factor is the advent of the Gospel, for \"although nothing descended from above, yet from above the Gospel really came\" (Haer., vii, c. 13). It came as naphtha catches fire from a spark, and each sphere in turn caught the glory from the sphere above it. The Ogdoad, the region of the Great Archon, was illuminated first; his ignorance was enlightened, he confessed his sin, and his awe-struck mind learned that \"fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wisdom\" (Haer., vii, c. 14; cf. Strom., ii, 8. 36, p. 162). From the world of the Ogdoad the Gospel descended to the Hebdomad, and from thence to the earth. Each world has been illuminated and evangelized in turn.\n\nWhat, then, is this Evangel? It is the knowledge of supra-mundane and celestial things, to know what is the Father, the 'not-being God,' what the Son, and what the\n\n\\(^1\\) \u1f26\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c7 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03c7\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (Haer., vii, c. 10, cf. c. 11). Hippolytus (c. 10) attaches this Limitary Spirit to the second Sonship (\u1f21 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2). But there is evidently some confusion, since he explains why this Limitary Spirit could not enter into the communion of not-being God. Moreover, nothing could have checked the upward flight of the second Sonship, had there been no limit. In c. 14 the Holy Spirit is also represented apparently as Light.\nHoly Spirit. To know this, and to know what is the constitution of the universe, the differentiation, the perfecting, the restoration of all things, that is the fourfold wisdom (Haer., vii, c. 14).\u00b9\n\nThe advent of the Gospel is a world event. And here we come upon a striking application of an Indian belief. The novelty of Christianity profoundly impressed the Church of the first two centuries; it was a characteristic note of early Christianity. But none seized on it more powerfully than the Gnostics; it is a keystone in the theories of Marcion and Valentinus as well as of Basilides. With Basilides the time of Jesus\u2019 birth was determined by the conjunction of the stars, for although the stars, he holds, do not determine the destiny of man, they control the hour of his birth. And so, when Jesus was born, a new Kalpa or Yug began,\u00b2 a world period which will end when all the Sonship has been gathered in and the consummation of all things takes place. For the third Sonship is not exhausted by Jesus any more than the second Sonship is exhausted by Christ. It embraces all the Sons of God left behind in the material mass.\u00b3 Jesus lived the life narrated in the Gospels; he is \u201cthe first-fruits of the discrimination of the things confused\u201d (Haer., vii, c. 15), and all the Sons of God must follow in His steps (Haer., vii, c. 14, 15). They are the elect (\u1f21 \u1f10\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae), and their very nature ensures their ultimate salvation, although the time may be postponed by voluntary sin. It is neither the Valentinian gnosis nor the contemplative absorption of the Buddhist which enables them to apprehend the Gospel, but it is Faith. Faith (\u1f21 \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), according to the Basilidian\n\n\u00b9 \u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f44\u03bd, \u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u1f21 \u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, \u03c4\u03af \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f18\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1, \u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u1f21 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae, \u03c0\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7 \u03b1\u1f55\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f21 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bd \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u1ff3 \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 (Haer., vii, c. 14); cf.

Strom., ii, 3, 10, p. 156, and ii, 6, 27, p. 160). By this faith the elect,\u00b9 the believer by nature, arrives at a stage of serene blessedness, fulfilling the divinely constituted law which requires him to be in a state of charity with all things, neither desiring nor hating anything (Clem. Strom., iv, 12, 88, p. 217).\u00b2 All passion, all desire is past: surely the elect has attained to the dignity of an Arahat.\n\nIf the Pauline terms Faith and Election are essential terms of Basilides\u2019 teaching, perfection and restoration are so equally. Jesus suffered and died, and His material part was restored to the Formlessness to which it belonged. The psyche ascended to the Hebdomad, and the regions of the Great Archon and of the Holy Spirit received such elements of His personality as were peculiar to them, while the third Sonship ascended through all these regions to the \u2018Blessed Sonship,\u2019 which had been from the beginning with the Father\u2014the \u2018not-being God.\u2019 And in like manner as Jesus ascended, so must all the elect ascend (Haer., vii, c. 15). Now this region at which they arrive, and this communion with \u2018not-being God,\u2019 \u2018the Inconceivable and Blessed,\u2019 is none other than Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. And, like Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, it is a state to be passionately desired. \u201cFor every nature desires that [not-being God] on account of a superabundance of [its] beauty and [its] bloom,\u201d and \u201cthat blessed region which words cannot express nor reason grasp\u201d (Haer., vii, c. 10).\n\n\u00b9 The \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 and the \u1f10\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u1f76 are convertible terms; \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 (Strom., v, 1, 3, p. 233).\n\u00b2 It is \u1f10\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 . . . \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f21\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f72\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f22 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03ce\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1. \u201cIt is one part of the declared will of God\u201d \u201cto be in a state of charity with all things, because all [individual] things bear a relation to the whole, i.e. the general scheme of the Kosmos.\u201d This \u201cdeclared will of God\u201d is the constitution of the universe \u201cinvoluntarily willed by not-being God.\u201d \u201cDeus nec amat nec odit\u201d is a fundamental maxim of all Indian philosophy as well as of Spinoza, and to attribute a state of charity to \u2018not-being God,\u2019 as some commentators do, is to furnish with morality a being above all predicates.\n\u00b3 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u1f72 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u1f70 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd. Professor Rhys Davids has pointed out to me that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is, properly speaking, a state and not a region. Now Basilides certainly conceived that\nFrom this state the Sons of God can never more descend, for them rebirth is over, all things are at an end. When the last seed of the Sonship has been gathered in, the world-period is over, the 'Kalpa' is completed, and the restoration of all things will take place. At present \"the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together,\" waiting for the manifestation of the Sons of God; it is disturbed by the birth pangs of the spiritual Sonship, and desires heights to which it can never attain. But when the Divine Light is for ever withdrawn it will cease from unavailing trouble, sorrow and sighing will flee away, and 'the great Ignorance' will envelop everything (Haer., vii, c. 15).\n\n\"Thy hand, Great Anarch, lets the curtain fall,\nAnd universal darkness covers all.\"\n\nBasilides and the \"Dunciad\" arrive at the same happy conclusion.\n\nThis, then, is the far-famed Basilidian theology, a scheme immensely ingenious, boldly conceived, powerfully reasoned, sincerely believed. It is composed in unequal parts of Gnosticism, Christianity, and Buddhism. With the main stream of Syrian Gnosticism, which attained to Hellenic symmetry and form in the hands of Valentinus, Basilides was well acquainted. But he borrows little from it except the general problem. All the Gnostics agreed in placing the Absolute God beyond all human ken, they all assigned an inferior place to the Old Testament dispensation, they entertained somewhat similar notions of the demiurge, and\n\n\"being with not-being God\" implied not only a state but a place, a supramundane region with its 'treasury.' We must remember that Basilides acquired his knowledge, not from learned Sramanas, but from the popular beliefs of Buddhist merchants, and that at this very time the doctrines of the older Buddhism were falling into abeyance, and Buddha himself was widely worshipped. Even Clement was aware of that. But if Buddha were worshipped, he must be somewhere; he must have some shadowy existence in some supramundane region.\n\n1 Apparently a favourite text with Basilides. Hippolytus twice quotes it in his summary.\n\n2 \"As a mere system of metaphysics the theory of Basilides contains the nearest approach to the conception of a logical philosophy of the absolute which the history of ancient thought can furnish, almost rivalling that of Hegel in modern times.\" (Mansel, \"Gnostic Heresies,\" p. 165.)\nthey all set themselves to solve the problem of the origin of evil and the ascent of man. But beyond this Basilides has not much in common with the Gnostici. He borrows the terms Ogdoad and Hebdomad, and the division of the Spheres. He may have borrowed from his contemporary and fellow-townsman Valentinus the term 'Limitary Spirit,' although the term is so essential to the Basilidian theology that, if borrowing there was at all, I suspect the borrowing was the other way. But in everything else Basilides and the Gnostici are opposed. For them the great fact of human life is the fatalism of the stars, and metempsychosis takes a secondary place. The fatal nexus of rebirth determines Basilides' philosophy, and astrology is scarcely of account. They proceed by emanations, and clothe their ideas in the garb of Babylonian or Egyptian mythology. Basilides is comparatively free from mythology,\u00b9 and argues vigorously against all emanation theories (Haer., vii, c. 10). They start with a fall from the Infinite to the Finite; he knows nothing of it.\n\nBasilides doubtless believed Christianity to be the main factor of his system. He frankly accepted the Gospel narrative, the evangelical morality, the doctrine of the Trinity, the Pauline terminology. His whole scheme is intended to show the advent of the Gospel, how the Divine Sonship came into the world and gave the power to become sons of God to as many as are born of God. And his theology throws a suggestive light upon the doctrinal teaching, and the authority of the Gospels and Pauline Epistles in the Church of Alexandria when Hadrian reigned.\n\n\u00b9 The one, directly mythological expression I find in Basilides is the remark that Righteousness and her daughter Peace dwelt in the Ogdoad (Strom., iv, p. 231). The Ogdoad was doubtless inhabited by a number of abstract entities\u2014Nous, Phronesis, Logos, and the rest mentioned by Irenaeus\u2014but not emanations as Irenaeus and the later Basilidians held. All these were probably treated, like the Sonship, as collective germs, and characteristic of the sphere. But these are merely abstractions hypostatized after the Oriental fashion. They do not necessarily wear a mythological or even an anthropomorphic dress. At the same time the spheres of the first and second Archon were inhabited by innumerable hosts of \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af, \u1f10\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03af, and \u03b4\u03c5\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, the Gnostic counterpart of Greek demons, Jewish angels, and Buddhist devas, who were ready to supply the later Basilidians at once with a full-blown mythology.\nBut this Christianity apparent to the eye is profoundly Buddhist at the core. All things have their law of being in themselves: suffering is the concomitant of existence, rebirth is the result of former acts, and metempsychosis governs men with inflexible justice and with iron severity. The office of Jesus is the office of the Buddha;\u00b9 the elect alone are saved, and the mass of mankind remains content to be born again. All things have their consummation in immense ignorance. But the Basilidian scheme is more grandiose than its prototype: in the place of unending turmoil it substitutes a world process of differentiation, for the release of the individual Arahat the cessation of the sorrows of the world; and it is carried out with a historical character, a clearness of definition, and a rigour of logic which Buddhism never knew.\n\nThus Basilides lived and taught, accounted an arch-heretic in after times, but in his own day an eminent doctor of the Church at Alexandria. He had constructed, so he thought, a vast th\u00e9odic\u00e9e, he had solved the problems of Free-will and Fate, he had explained the evolution of the Spheres, and of the innumerable spirits which dwell above and below the motions of the Moon, as well as of the Sons of God on earth, consubstantial with not-being God and desirous to return to Him. \"Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy.\" Buddhist metaphysics found little acceptance in Alexandria; they were too foreign to Hellenic modes of thought, and it was many centuries later when the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat first attracted the mind of the West. The doctrines of Basilides were misunderstood by his critics, and misinterpreted by his followers. Clement and Hippolytus prove their agreement and good faith by enabling us to reconstruct the main outlines of the system, but they were frequently much puzzled. The followers of Basilides were confined for the most part to Alexandria and\n\n\u00b9 \"You yourselves must make the effort: the Buddhas are only preachers\" (Rhys Davids, \"Buddhism,\" p. 107). Compare the striking elaboration of the theme, \"Be ye lamps unto yourselves,\" in the Maha Parinibbana, translated by Rhys Davids, \"Buddhist Suttas,\" pp. 36\u201339.\nthe Delta of the Nile; they were men of little note, probably Egyptianized Hellenes, and Hellenized Egyptians and Jews. They turned the Basilidian teaching into a wild farrago and an immoral cult. The doctrine of election lent itself to Antinomian licentiousness, and the moderate Clement reproaches them with their views of marriage; they scorned the sufferings of the Martyrs, and counted it wisdom to deny Christ. They delighted in emanations and astrology, divided the spheres into 365 heavens,\\(^1\\) and placed the solar Abrasax\\(^2\\) at its head, and they were famed above all other sects for their belief in the hidden virtues of stones, in talismans and spells, and all the products of Jud\u00e6o-Egyptian Magic. These beliefs, the offspring of superstitious hearts and stuffed-up brains, bear as little resemblance to the teaching of Basilides as the confused medley called the religion of the Mandaites bears to the teaching of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is clear from Hippolytus, vii, c. 14, that that \"tedious treatise\" on the 365 heavens had nothing to do with Basilides or Isidore. These 365 heavens correspond with the 365 days of the Egyptian 'common' year, and are connected with Abrasax and the solar cult of the later Basilidians.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Abraxoid gems are numerous, especially in the Delta of the Nile, and they are the only ones which are certainly Gnostic. Hippolytus tells us (vii, c. 14) that Abraxas, or more properly Abrasax, was supreme lord of the 365 heavens, which represent the 365 days of the year. He bears therefore a solar character, and the Greek letters of his name have 365 for their numerical value (\\(\\alpha = 1, \\beta = 2, \\rho = 100, \\sigma = 1, \\xi = 60, \\alpha = 1, \\varsigma = 200 = 365\\)). Neilos and Meithras give the same arithmetical result. The iconic representations of Abrasax on the gems represent him in the main as an Egyptian solar deity. He has the head of the solar hawk, the bird of Horus, or rather Horus himself, and the addition of a rude cock's comb on some gems may represent, as in other cases, not a cock's head, but flames or rays. With his left hand Abrasax advances a shield, his right hand holds a scourge upraised to strike. The scourge I identify with the \\(khu\\) of the Egyptian gods, and the attitude recalls the attitude of Min Amen at Thebes. The Abrasax legs are snakes, the symbols of the underworld. The bark of Ra is drawn by serpents in its passage through the twelve hours of the night, and on the sarcophagus of Seti I serpents represent the hidden fires of germination in the realms of Osiris (v. \"The Alabaster Sarcophagus of Oimenepthah I,\" by J. Bonomi & S. Sharpe, 1864, pl. vii). Abrasax is often identified with Iao, and Iao is occasionally represented by an immense python for ever travelling\u2014a python such as we find on the walls of the same Seti's tomb in the Valley of the Kings. These Abraxoid gems are magical talismans for the protection of the wearer. But Abrasax is much more than \\(\\eta \\lambda \\iota \\sigma \\delta \\lambda \\epsilon \\tau \\iota \\kappa \\alpha \\sigma \\varsigma\\), more than Amen-Ra; he is the invention of Egyptian Jews and Gnostics, and has Jewish and even Syrian elements in his composition.

The Basilidians and Basilides have little in common except the name.\n\nIt is a fascinating spectacle, that inward struggle of the early Church in the generations that extend from the persecutions of Nero to the golden age of the elder Antonine. On one side was ranged the Christian consciousness, the organization, the simple faith, and solid virtues of obscure men; on the other side were learning and philosophy, poetry and genius. The Church was still largely Oriental in character, and Christian experience had not had time to formulate itself in universally accepted dogma. If the churches of Rome, of Antioch, and Asia Minor reeked with blood, these persecutions which made men shudder had not extended to the banks of the Euphrates or the Nile. While Rome and Asia Minor were engaged in building up the social and ecclesiastical organism, and in evolving the rudiments of the liturgy, the Oriental mind was busy in adapting Christianity to preconceived philosophies. Orthodox and Gnostics were sincere believers alike; alike they acknowledged the divinity of Christ, the novelty and the superiority of the Christian dispensation; they listened with curiosity and respect to the stories of those who had known the Apostles. But the Gnostic philosophies were pagan, no other, indeed, being then available, and for the early Christians Paganism was an instinctive barrier. Had the Gnostics prevailed Christianity would have been at an end; happily it was the Church of the simple that triumphed. And yet, perhaps, something has been lost with the disappearance of the traces of the struggle. The historian may regret the loss of traditions which threatened to occupy a place similar to that they hold in Mahommedan theology. Some great truths held alike by Orthodox and Gnostics were allowed to fall into the background. The Church resolutely set its face against all inquiries into the origin of evil. But whenever Christian poets and divines have dared to overleap the limits of our ignorance they have always begun with that first supposition of the Gnostics\u2014the pre-existence of the soul.\n\"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\nThe soul that rises with us, our life's star,\nHath had elsewhere its setting,\nAnd cometh from afar.\n\nHence, in a season of calm weather,\nThough inland far we be,\nOur souls have sight of that immortal sea\nWhich brought us hither;\nCan in a moment travel hither\u2014\nAnd see the children sport upon the shore,\nAnd hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\"\nART. XVI.\u2014Note on the Past Tense in Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b. By Sten Konow, of the University of Christiania, Norway.\n\nThe past tense in Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b is formed by adding a suffix la. The same suffix is also used in Bih\u0101r\u012b, Oriy\u0101, Bengali, and Gujar\u0101t\u012b. This form has long been a puzzle to scholars. Mr. Beames, A Comparative Grammar of the Modern Aryan Languages of India, vol. iii, p. 135, compares the past tense in Slavonic languages; Dr. Hoernle, A Comparative Grammar of the Gaudian Languages, p. 139 f., derives la from the suffix ta of the past participle passive in Sanskrit; and Sir Charles Lyall, A Sketch of the Hindustani Language, Edinburgh, 1880, p. 48 f., thinks that la is a diminutive suffix added to the old past participle passive. This last view is essentially the same as that held by Dr. Grierson, who some time ago, and before I had arrived at any independent opinion regarding the question, told me that he derives la from the Prakrit suffix illa (Hemacandra, ii, 164).\n\nIt is not my intention to discuss the whole matter in this place. I hope that such a discussion will soon proceed from a more competent authority, and I shall only draw attention to some phonetical features in Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b which will, in my opinion, throw some new light on the matter.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b possesses two l-sounds, a dental and a cerebral one, but this fact has never, so far as I am aware, been satisfactorily explained.\n\nThe cerebral l only occurs between vowels, and its use is also in that position restricted. The Prakrits do not give any clue towards the solution of the question about its use. In most manuscripts the cerebral l is never written, while others, copied in South India, always use l instead of l.\nAn inspection of numerous instances in Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b has led me to the following conclusion: Every single l between vowels in the Prakrits becomes \u1e37 in Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, while ll becomes l.\n\nThis rule does not apply to modern compounds, nor to tatsamas and other borrowed words, and the initial l of postpositions is not changed after words ending in vowels. In other cases I have not found any exception to the rule.\n\nSingle l between vowels becomes \u1e37. Thus, \u1e0dak\u1e63\u1e47\u0113, to know, Prakrit \u1e0dakkha; k\u0101l, time, Prakrit k\u0101la; k\u0101\u1e37\u0101, black, Prakrit k\u0101la; gal\u0101, neck, Prakrit galaa; ga\u1e45\u1e47\u0113, to fall, Prakrit gal\u0101; g\u014d\u1e37\u0101, globe, Prakrit g\u014d\u1e37aa; d\u014d\u1e37a, eye, Prakrit d\u014d\u1e37aa; pa\u1e6d\u1e47\u0113, to run, Prakrit p\u0101\u1e37\u0101; phal, fruit, Prakrit phala; mi\u1e45\u1e47\u0113, to meet, Prakrit milai; mu\u1e37\u0113, on account of, Prakrit m\u016b\u1e37an\u0101m; vi\u1e6d\u0101\u1e37, impurity, Prakrit vitt\u0101la.\n\nDouble l between vowels becomes \u1e37. Thus, an\u1e0dil, male, Prakrit *an\u1e0dilla; \u0101\u1e6di, being in, Prakrit *antilla; o\u1e37\u0101, wet, Prakrit ollaa; k\u0101l, yesterday, Prakrit kallam; gh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e47\u0113, to throw, Prakrit ghall\u0101; ta\u1e0d\u1e47\u0113, to go, Prakrit calla (Hemacandra, iv, 281); cikhal, mud, Prakrit cikkhalla; t\u0113\u1e37, oil, Prakrit tella; ph\u016b\u1e37, flower, Prakrit phulla; b\u014d\u1e6d\u1e47\u0113, to say, Prakrit boll\u0101; bail, a bull, Prakrit bailla; bh\u016b\u1e6d\u1e47\u0113, to forget oneself, Prakrit bhull\u0101; va\u1e0dil, an elder, Prakrit vaddilla.\n\nIt seems to me that there can be no doubt regarding the existence of this law. And we are, I think, justified in using it for the explanation of dubious forms. Thus the form pahil\u0101, the first, must be derived from a hypothetical *prathillaa, and not from *prathilaa. The Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba form pahila represents the modern, and not the Prakrit stage. \u0100pa\u1e37a, his, must be compared with Prakrit appulla. Further, the suffix l\u0101 of the past tense must be derived from ll\u0101, that is from ill\u0101n, as Dr. Grierson thinks; compare Ardham\u0101gadhi \u0101\u1e47illiya, brought.\n\nIt is of interest to note that the change of l to \u1e37 is also found in Pai\u015b\u0101ci and in C\u016blik\u0101pais\u0101cika. The conditions seem to be exactly the same as in modern Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b. Compare ku\u1e37\u0101m, salil\u0101m, ja\u1e37\u0101m, p\u0101\u1e37ak\u014d, li\u1e37\u0101, but ucchallanti. There is no connection between Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b and these old dialects, but the coincidence shows that the law is an old one, and that\nit is not restricted to Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b. I do not doubt that further investigations will show that \u1e47 and n interchange according to the same law in other modern vernaculars where both sounds occur.\n\nIt may be noted that \u1e47 and n between vowels appear to be interchangeable in exactly the same way as was the case with \u1e0d and \u1e0d. That is to say, \u1e47 is derived from a single, and n from a double n. We are, in this case, able to follow the development farther back. Ardham\u0101gadh\u012b, Jaina Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b, and Jaina \u015aaurasen\u012b change every single n between vowels to \u1e47, but usually write n in the beginning of words, and nn between vowels. The oldest manuscripts prefer \u1e47 in all positions, but n is very common in all paper manuscripts. Compare Pischel, Grammatik der Prakritsprachen, \u00a7 224.\n\nMedial \u1e47 is preserved in Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b: thus, \u0101\u1e45\u1e47\u0113, to fetch, Prakrit *\u0101\u1e47\u1e47a\u1e47\u1e47a\u1e47\u1e47u\u00b9; k\u014d\u1e47, who? Prakrit k\u014d u\u1e47a or k\u014d \u1e47u; t\u0113\u1e47\u0113 (-kar\u016bn), therefore, Prakrit t\u0113\u1e47\u0101m; pa\u1e47, but, Prakrit pu\u1e47a; bahi\u1e47, sister, Prakrit bahi\u1e47\u012b.\n\nMedial \u1e47\u1e47 becomes n: thus, k\u0101n, ear, Prakrit kanna; d\u014dn, two, Prakrit d\u014d\u1e47\u1e47i; dzun\u0101, old, Prakrit junn\u0101; r\u0101n, forest, Prakrit ra\u1e47\u1e47a; vinavi\u1e47\u0113, to entreat, Prakrit vi\u1e47\u1e47av\u0113i; s\u014d\u1e47\u0113, gold, Prakrit so\u1e47\u1e47aa.\n\n\u00b9 I do not believe in the derivation of the infinitive suffix \u1e47\u0113 from -aniyam. The suffix ana, anai in Apabhr\u0101\u1e41\u015ba (Hemacandra, iv, 411) certainly belongs to an ordinary verbal noun in ana, and I am unable to explain the phonetical changes and the development of the sense of the form which must be supposed when adopting the derivation from aniyam. The suffix aniya becomes anija in Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b, and Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b agrees with that dialect in the formation of passive forms. Hindi and especially Braj, on the other hand, show some points of connection with \u015aaurasen\u012b (compare, for instance, kiya\u1e47, done, with \u015aaurasen\u012b ki\u1e0da, where Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b has ka\u1e0da), and aniya in \u015aaurasen\u012b becomes ania. I therefore think it probable that an old verbal noun in anaa, corresponding to the Apabhr\u0101\u1e41\u015ba infinitive in anai, has in Hindi been confounded with a form derived from the participle of necessity in aniya. Such a supposition would explain the fact that the Hindi form in na is used both as an infinitive and as a future participle passive. In Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, however, the form in \u1e47\u0113 is a pure verbal noun. And its derivation from aniya is, I think, phonetically impossible. A suffix -anai, on the other hand, must become Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b \u1e47\u0113, Braj naai, and so forth. Compare the analogous development of the past participle passive.\nThere is, however, some uncertainty with regard to the matter. In the Dekhan every \\( n \\) is, at least in many places, pronounced as a dental, and we cannot, therefore, expect that the two sounds should be correctly distinguished. Thus we find \\( r\u0101n \\) and \\( r\u0101n \\), colour; \\( \u0101ni \\) and \\( \u0101ni \\), and ; and so forth. The word \\( r\u0101ni \\), a queen, is probably correct. It is scarcely derived from a Prakrit \\( *r\u0101nn\u012b \\), as the corresponding \\( r\u0101n \\) usually preserves the long \\( \u0101 \\), and the analogy of this word should, therefore, be expected to counteract the shortening of \\( \u0101 \\) in \\( r\u0101j\u00f1\u012b \\). The suffix \\( \u016bna \\) of the conjunctive participle would be against the rule, if it is in reality identical with Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri \\( \u016bna \\). The old forms in \\( \u014dn \\), \\( \u014dni \\), and \\( \u014dniy\u0101 \\) make the explanation of this suffix very difficult, and I am not able to solve the question. Compare the old ablative suffixes \\( p\u0101suniy\u0101 \\), \\( huniy\u0101 \\). \\( Niy\u0101 \\) seems to be a postposition of the ablative or the instrumental added to the old form in \\( \u016b \\). Compare Gujar\u0101ti (i-)m\u0113.\n\nI have already mentioned that the suffix of the past tense probably goes back on an older \\( illa \\). This suffix is in the Prakrites interchangeable with \\( alla \\) and \\( alla \\), and I think it probable that one of these latter forms occurs in past tenses such as \\( bud\u0101la \\), he sank.\n\nThere are in Mar\u0101\u1e6dhi several irregular verbs, and some of these allow us to see that the \\( ll \\)-suffix was really added to the past participle in \\( ta \\). I shall make some remarks on a few of these forms.\n\nPoetical texts have preserved several old forms. Thus, \\( k\u0101\u1e0dhiya\u1e47i \\), taken out, for the modern \\( k\u0101\u1e0dhi\u1e47i \\), where the old participle is clearly preserved. The same is the case with \\( p\u0101\u1e6dali \\), went, from Prakrit \\( p\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6daila \\). Several such forms have been mentioned by Sir Charles Lyall, l.c., and the reader may be referred to that work for further instances.\n\nThe old participle is also easily recognizable in several forms in the modern language. Thus, \\( k\u0113\u1e6di \\), done; \\( g\u0113\u1e6di \\), gone; \\( m\u0113\u1e6di \\), dead, clearly contain the old Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri participles \\( kaa \\), \\( gaa \\), \\( maa \\), respectively. It is of interest to note that \\( k\u0113\u1e6di \\) is derived from \\( kan \\), and not from \\( kia \\), \\( ki\u0101na \\), which latter form is common in \u015aaurseni. \\( Py\u0101\u1e6di \\), drunk, contains \\( p\u0101\u015bi \\);\nbhya\u1e6de, feared, bhia; and lyal\u0113, put on, probably a *lia. Khall\u0113, ate, is not clear to me. There exists a poetical form khadil\u0113, which seems to be the origin of it, but this latter form looks like a late loan-word from Sanskrit.\n\nThe t of the past participle has been preserved in forms such as gh\u0113\u1e6da\u1e6de, taken; gh\u0101\u1e6da\u1e6de, put; dh\u016b\u1e6da\u1e6de, washed; bagh\u012b\u1e6da\u1e6de, seen; s\u0101\u1e45g\u012b\u1e6da\u1e6de, said; m\u0101g\u012b\u1e6da\u1e6de, asked. This t must be traced back to a double t in Prakrit. Gh\u0113\u1e6da\u1e6de is derived from ghetta, a form which must be inferred from M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri ghettuna. Gh\u0101\u1e6da\u1e6de belongs to Prakrit ghallai, to throw, from which a past participle *ghatta, that is ghalta, might be formed. The t of the other forms must be explained after the analogy of Prakrit forms such as hatta=h\u0101a, killed; khatta=kh\u0101a, dug; that is, the t of the suffix has been doubled under the influence of the accent.\n\nIn mha\u1e6da\u1e6de, said; khan\u1e6da\u1e6de, dug; and h\u0101\u1e6da\u1e6de, slain, a t precedes the suffix le. The form mha\u1e6da\u1e6de is probably derived from a Prakrit *bha\u1e6d\u1e6dha, formed from *bh\u0101\u1e63-ta, just as la\u1e6d\u1e6dha, friendly, from *la\u1e63-ta. It might, however, also be derived directly from the root bhal. This verb is in Prakrit conjugated as belonging to the 9th class, and the same was perhaps originally the case in Sanskrit. The forms khan\u1e6da\u1e6de and h\u0101\u1e6da\u1e6de are not clear to me. I may note that a form mhan\u1e6da\u1e6de, said, occurs in dialects.\n\nThe mentioned forms are not all clear, but this much they show, that the suffix la is an additional suffix added to the old past participle passive.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. A Rectification.\n\n3, Via San Francesco Poverino, Florence.\nJanuary 9, 1902.\n\nMy dear Professor,\u2014I have recently received a letter from General Houtum Schindler in Tehran, from which it appears that, quite unintentionally, I have misstated his views in my recent paper (J.R.A.S. for April, 1901) on \"The Cities of Kirman.\" I therefore hasten to set the matter right. In regard to the site of Sirj\u0101n (p. 282 of last year's volume) I have misunderstood General Schindler in supposing that he had identified this place with the modern Sa'id\u0101b\u0101d; on the contrary, General Schindler is of opinion that this, the older capital, probably stood in the M\u0101sh\u012bz plain, which is considerably to the eastward of Sa'id\u0101b\u0101d. In the second place, in connection with the etymology of the name Bardasir (note 1 to p. 283), General Schindler disclaims any reliance on the statements of the Persian dictionary called Farhang-i-Anjuman \u0100ra, which he knew to be misleading and incorrect.\u2014Believe me to be, yours most truly,\n\nG. Le Strange.\n\n2. The term Sahampati.\n\nSir,\u2014In the course of Dr. Anesaki's interesting letter on the Agamas in the J.R.A.S. for 1901, p. 899, he gives the\nexplanation of Japanese scholars of the puzzling title Sahampati applied to Brahm\u0101 in Buddhist books. Chinese scholars interpret it somewhat differently. They translate the first part of the word sometimes by \u2018patient\u2019 and sometimes by \u2018mixed,\u2019 and explain the whole word as meaning \u201cthe inhabitants of the sphere over which \u015a\u0101kya-Buddha\u2019s influence extends.\u201d The older Chinese translators generally transcribed it sh\u0101-po or sha-bo, which is apparently meant to represent sarva or sabba, but the meaning they give is always either \u2018patient\u2019 or \u2018mixed,\u2019 and not \u2018perishable.\u2019 It is evident that those who give the meaning \u2018patient\u2019 had the root sah, \u2018to be patient,\u2019 in view; and those who give the meaning \u2018mixed\u2019 had the preposition saha, \u2018with,\u2019 in view.\n\nThe Chinese Buddhist scholiasts further explain the word \u2018patient\u2019 thus:\n\n\u201call creatures inhabiting the sphere which is under \u015a\u0101kya-Buddha patiently bear r\u0101gas, dve\u1e63as, and mohas.\u201d\n\nAnd the word \u2018mixed\u2019 thus:\n\n\u201cin this sphere holy sages, gods, common people, and the beings in hell are found, they are mixed in that world,\u201d\n\nso that, in the view of those writers, Sahampati has the same meaning as Praj\u0101pati.\n\nU. WOGIHARA.\n\n1 Cf. Karun\u0101-pu\u1e47\u1e0darika (Calc. ed., fasc. i, p. 63), where we must read saha instead of sah\u0101.\n\n2 [This comes to much the same as Dr. Anesaki\u2019s explanation \u201cLord of the Shaba world,\u201d where shaba is an interesting cross between sarva and sabba. It seems more natural to connect Sahampati, as an epithet of Brahm\u0101, with svayambhu, also used as such an epithet. So already in 1881, in our \u201cVinaya Texts,\u201d l. 86; and Professor Franke, in 1893, in the Vienna Journal, p. 359. The Chinese derivations are very forced. If one wanted to say \u201cLord of the world,\u201d is it probable one would have said either \u201cLord of the patient ones\u201d or \u201cLord of the with\u2019s,\u201d even if either of these explanations were etymologically satisfactory? But they belong to the sphere of exegesis rather than to that of etymology\u2014like the word-plays in the Old Testament or in the Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta\u2014and, as such, are very ingenious.\u2014RH. D.]\n3. Water (vatura) in Sinhalese.\n\nIndian Institute, Oxford.\nJanuary 22, 1902.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014As the word vatura in the sense of 'flowing water' occurs in an inscription of King Dappula V (A.D. 940\u2013952), which I have just edited for the \"Epigraphia Zeylanica,\" I had to go into the question of its correct signification and its etymology, about which you and Mr. Ferguson contributed several interesting notes to the Journal for 1898 (pp. 198, 367\u2013369) and for 1901 (pp. 119\u2013120).\n\nThere is no doubt that vatura, as well as its more archaic form vaturu, meant originally 'water in motion,' and not 'water' pure and simple, as it is now understood. To the authorities already cited, I may add the Ruvanmala and the Piyummala (Pandit Batuvantud\u0101ve's edition, 1892, pp. 21, 81, and 90), as well as Jayatilaka's Elu-ak\u0101r\u0101diya (p. 37), where only the old form vaturu is given as a synonym of \u014dga (Pali ogha), 'flood'; megha, 'rain-cloud'; salu or pil\u012b, 'cloth.' Of the words diya and diyara, the former is common enough in the literature, and always means simply 'water,' except, of course, when it represents the Skt. words jaya, 'victory'; jagat, 'world'; and jy\u0101, 'bow-string' (Piyummala, p. 103); the latter, on the other hand, is not recorded in any of the well-known vocabularies such as N\u0101m\u0101valiya, Ruvanmala, nor have I come across it in inscriptions or standard works. Jayatilaka also omits it from his useful Elu-ak\u0101r\u0101diya (Colombo, 1893). We see, however, from Mr. Ferguson's letter at p. 369 of the Journal for 1898, that diyara and diya were synonyms commonly used in every-day talk so far back as the beginning of the seventeenth century.\n\nTurning to the etymology of these three words, we find James de Alwis derives vatura from Skt. v\u0101ri, Dr. Goldschmidt from v\u0101tula, while my friends Mudaliyar B. Gu\u1e47asekara and Professor Geiger connect it with\nSkt. *vistara*, 'extensive,' through P\u0101li and Pkt. *ritthara* (\"Etymologie des Singhalesischen,\" Munich, 1897, p. 78; also his \"Litteratur und Sprache der Singhalesen,\" Strassburg, 1901, pp. 32 and 36). Mr. Ferguson, in his last note on the subject (J.R.A.S., 1901, p. 119), adheres to this etymology. There is yet another derivation which I wish to submit, and which seems to me to be more in accordance with the phonetic laws of Sinhalese. I should connect *vatura* or *vaturu* with the Sanskrit *vartar\u016bka* (Hemacandra's *Anek\u0101rthasa\u1e45graha*, iv, 31), through a Pr\u0101k\u1e5btic form *vattar\u016ba* and Sinhalese *vataru* and *vaturu* (cf. Sinh. *katura* = Skt. *kartari*; Sinh. *turu* = Skt. *t\u0101ra* or *t\u0101raka*; Sinh. *vat-man* = Skt. *vartam\u0101na*; Sinh. *daru* = Skt. *d\u0101raka*). *Vartar\u016bka*, moreover, means a whirlpool, an eddy. It is also the name of a river. Compare in this connection Skt. *avarta*, 'whirlpool,' and *\u0101-vartaka*, name of a form of cloud personified.\n\nProfessor Geiger has rightly adhered to the recognized etymology of *diya* from P\u0101li *daka*. We have *dala* from Skt. *jala* in *dala-dara* (Skt. *jala-dhara*, 'cloud,' and *jala-dh\u0101ra*, 'current of water, stream'). The word *diyara*, however, I am inclined to consider either as a derivative of a compound *daka-dh\u0101ra* or as a word formed from *diya* by adding *ra* on the analogy of *vatura*. The different spellings *diya-wara*, *diaura*, *diora*, quoted by Mr. Ferguson (J.R.A.S., 1898, p. 369), seem to support the first etymology. Compare also Sinh. *piyayuru* with Skt. *payodhara*.\u2014Yours very truly,\n\nDon M. de Zilva Wickremasinghe.\n\n4. Two Old Manuscripts.\n\n17, Elysium Row, Calcutta.\nDecember 10, 1901.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014It may interest the members of the Society to learn that in the course of removing the Records of the Board of Examiners, Fort William, which is the existing\nrepresentative of the College of Fort William, to the new offices, I have unearthed two rather interesting manuscripts. One is a large thick folio of 271 manuscript pages, in excellent condition, except as regards the calf binding. The paper is thick, and bears in it a watermark, a shield, on which is a bend, the shield surmounted by a fleur de lis and beneath it the letters G. R. The paper is yellowed by age and somewhat mottled by damp, but otherwise is in excellent preservation. The title-page reads as follows:\n\n\"M\u0101nava Dherma-Sastra or The Laws of Menu with the Gloss of Cull\u016bca; comprising the Hindu System of Duties, Religious and Civil, verbally translated from the Original Sanscrit By Sir William Jones.\"\n\nThis MS. appears on the face of it to be Sir William Jones' original manuscript. It is undoubtedly in his handwriting, as judged by specimens of his script in the records of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. I have no knowledge of the circumstances under which this MS. came into the possession of the College of Fort William, whose Library stamp it bears.\n\nII. The second MS. is the original Catalogue of the Library of Tippoo Sultan, made in 1805 by Major Charles Stewart. This is a folio of 105 pages, in Stewart's own handwriting and bearing his signature.\n\nI have collated it with the printed Catalogue of the Library published at Cambridge in 1809, and am about to bring the MS. before the Asiatic Society of Bengal at the next meeting. It is in good condition, but requires re-binding. Not a page, however, is missing.\nThe title-page reads\u2014\n\n\"Detailed Catalogue of the Library of the late Tippoo Sultan of Mysore. Compiled A.D. 1085 [sic; in pencil is added \"1806?\"].\"\n\nThe last words are\u2014\n\n\"Having given the Titles of the Books in the Persian Character, I have not been at all studious in my Oriental Orthography, nor have I attempted in the course of the work any Elegance of Language. It may perhaps mitigate the severity of criticism when it is known that from the commencement of this work till its conclusion only five months have elapsed. College, January 7, 1806.\n\nSd/ Charles Stewart.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Ranking, M.D.,\nLieut.-Col., I.M.S.\n\n5. The word Kozola as used of Kadphises on Kush\u0101n Coins.\n\nBedford.\nMarch 15, 1902.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014Mr. Vincent Smith's paper on the Kush\u0101n, or Indo-Scythian Period, read at the last meeting of the Society, has shown that there is much to be said in favour of a readjustment of present conceptions as to the chronology of the Kush\u0101n kings. At any rate it has revived my interest in the question as to what the term Kozola means which is found attached to the name of Kadphises I, and I venture to offer a solution.\n\nAs this monarch consolidated the five Yue-chi kingdoms and became the sole supreme head of the Kush\u0101n empire, I at one time suspected that the word might be intended to represent the Latin title Caesar, or even Khusro, but this proved to me to be untenable when I considered that the longer expression Kozola-kara is, unless I am mistaken, found as qualifying Kadphises. This shows that the term must be explained by a word which is equivalent in meaning, whether it be Kozola or Kozola-kara. We have the words Ku\u015bala and Ku\u015bala-kara in Sanscrit which satisfy this requirement.\nThey mean 'prosperous,' 'prosperity-causing,' and 'auspicious' or 'propitious.' The parallel terms Kshema and Kshemakara in Sanscrit are of exactly similar meaning. I am not sure that I should not be justified in saying that the same idea of the auspicious or prosperous underlies the very name of Augustus, whose coins seem to have served as an archetype for one issue at least of Kadphises; and perhaps the word Augustus may have suggested Kozola. In cases where one meets Kozolakasa, or Kuyalakasa, or Kujalakasa, this would be the genitive of Ku\u015balaka, a noun formed from the adjective Ku\u015bala.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nW. Hoby.\n\n6. Buddhist Notes.\n\nBritish Museum.\nMarch 25, 1902.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014Perhaps the following observations may have some interest, despite their trifling nature. If there should be any error in them I shall be grateful for correction.\n\n1. Apparently there exists in Burma a Pali version of the Lalitavistara. That maker of books without end, the late Shwegyin Hasadaw, has written a little tract called K\u0101m\u0101dinarakath\u0101, containing the well-known passage describing the sleeping damsels seen by Siddh\u0101rtha (pp. 252f in the Bibliotheca Indica), with a Burmese translation and homiletic notes (Mandalay, 1894, 1898).\n\n2. The British Museum possesses two MSS. of a little Bimbam\u0101navidhi (Or. 5291\u20132), which begins\u2014\n\n\u0101p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dugandam aru\u1e47\u0101dharam \u0101yat\u0101k\u1e63im\nbhr\u016bc\u0101pac\u0101rucaturasmitam induk\u0101ntam\nm\u0101r\u0101\u1e45gan\u0101vadanapa\u1e45kajam abhyah\u0101ri\nyen\u0101vadh\u016btam avat\u0101t sugatasya yu\u1e63m\u0101n.\n\nThis apparently means \"may you be blest through the sanctity of the Buddha, for whose sake a smile was brought...\"\nupon the lotus-faces of M\u0101ra\u2019s maids\u201d (Lalitavistara, xxi). The interest lies in the imperative avat\u0101t. After pointing out the extreme rarity of imperatives in -tat in later Sanskrit, Whitney remarks that for the \u201cbenedictive\u201d value of this form avouched by the grammarians (P\u0101\u1e47ini, vii, 1. 35, etc.) no examples appear to be quotable. Here is a striking example.\n\n3. There is a certain wit in passages such as the ma\u1e45galdacara\u1e47a of the Jain Jyot\u012b\u015bas\u0101roddh\u0101ra\u2014\n\ntam nam\u0101mi jin\u0101dhi\u00e7am sarvaj\u00f1am sarvasiddhidam\npratibimbitam \u0101bh\u0101ti jagad yajj\u00f1\u0101nadarpane.\n\nThis is clearly a voice from the S\u0101\u1e45khya. The T\u012brtha\u1e45kara is omniscient; the content of his thought is the whole universe. For this his mind is a perfect mirror; himself Buddha, he cognizes the All with pure buddhi. Remembering that two of the functions of buddhi are defined as \u201creflexion of object\u201d and \u201creflexion of soul,\u201d we see all these points brought out still more explicitly in the opening stanza of the Daivaj\u00f1ak\u0101madhenu of the Buddhist Anomadass\u012b\u2014\n\npratiphalanti jaganti samantato\nmah\u0101ti yad dhi san\u0101mani darpa\u1e47e\nsa bhagav\u0101n munir \u012bhita siddhaye\nh\u1e5bdi ciram mama gandhaku\u1e6d\u012byat\u0101m.\n\n\u201cForasmuch as the universe is reflected in the great (mahat = buddhi) mirror that has the same name as he (i.e. the buddhi of the Buddha), may the saintly Lord long dwell enshrined in my heart,\u201d etc.\u2014Very sincerely yours,\n\nL. D. Barnett.\n\n7. Kusin\u0101r\u0101.\n\nErrata.\n\nGwynfa, Cheltenham.\nMarch 25, 1902.\n\nMy dear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014I regret to say that I find a serious and misleading blunder in my paper on\nKusin\u0101r\u0101, ante, p. 140, top. For the sentence \"The discovery . . . . garden,\" please substitute \"The discovery of the true site of the Lumbini Garden proved that Ku\u015binagara could not possibly be represented by the remains near Kasi\u0101, which are neither at the right distance, nor in the right direction, from the garden.\"\n\nAlso the following errata:\u2014Ante, p. 152, line 3, for 'Magistrate' read 'Commissioner'; ibid., footnote, for '1889' read '1898.' I am indebted to Mr. Walter Lupton, M.R.A.S., for pointing out the former error, which was due to a slip of memory on my part. The second error is merely a misprint.\u2014Yours sincerely,\n\nV. A. Smith.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nA Catalogue of the Syriac Manuscripts preserved in the Library of the University of Cambridge. By the late William Wright, LL.D.; with an Introduction and Appendix by Stanley Arthur Cook, M.A. 1901.\n\nNo work on Syriac or Arabic literature could come to the world better recommended than one bearing on its title-page the name of W. Wright. The present Catalogue, of which more than three-quarters were prepared by that eminent scholar, provides a further proof of his extraordinary industry, to which Oriental study owes so many monuments. The MSS. catalogued are far less interesting in every way than those of the British Museum, but this fact does not diminish the gratitude due to those who have gone through the trouble of acquainting the world with the nature of their contents. The editor, besides describing those MSS. which Wright had not examined, has contributed an Introduction dealing with the history of the accessions to the Syriac collection of the Cambridge Library and also a valuable note on South Indian Syriac MSS. The arrangement of MSS. in the Catalogue, which appears to follow the shelf-numbers in the Library, is less helpful than the arrangement according to subjects which is ordinarily adopted; but the Indexes which the editor has appended compensate for this disadvantage.\n\nD. S. Margoliouth.\nBRUCHST\u00dcCKE INDISCHER SCHAUSPIELE IN INSCRIPTIONEN ZU AJMERE. Von F. KIELHORN. Mit 4 Tafeln. Separat-\nabdruck aus der Feestschrift zur Feier des 150 j\u00e4hrigen\nBestehens der K\u00f6nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften\nzu G\u00f6ttingen, 1901. (Berlin: Weidmannsche Buch-\nhandlung, 1901.)\n\nThe inscriptions which Professor Kielhorn now publishes\nare found on four basalt slabs which are kept in the Arhai-\ndin-ka Jhompra mosque in Ajmere. They have already been\npartly edited by the same scholar in the Indian Antiquary,\nvol. xx, and in the G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten for the year 1893.\nThe new edition is based on better pencil rubbings and\naccompanied by photolithographic plates of the originals.\n\nThe Ajmere slabs contain fragments of two plays,\nthe Lalitavighar\u0101jan\u0101\u1e6daka, written in honour of King\nVigrahar\u0101ja of S\u0101mbhar, and the Harakelin\u0101\u1e6daka by King\nVigrahar\u0101ja himself. The former is styled a N\u0101\u1e6daka, but\nis in reality a N\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101. Both are engraved by Bh\u0101skara,\nthe son of Mahipati, and the latter is dated Sa\u1e41vat\n1210=1153 A.D.\n\nThe fact that these plays were engraved on stone is of\ninterest as giving some support to the tradition according\nto which the Hanumann\u0101\u1e6daka was originally engraved on\na rock. Their chief importance, however, rests with the fact\nthat they contain passages in Prakrit which more closely\nagree with the rules laid down by the Prakrit grammarians\nthan is the case with any known manuscripts of Sanskrit\nplays. This is especially the case with the Lalitavigharaha-\nr\u0101jan\u0101\u1e6daka. We find here three Prakrit dialects used\u2014\nMah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri, \u015aauraseni, and M\u0101gadhi. The last-mentioned\ndialect is not used in the Harakelin\u0101\u1e6daka, and the Prakrit\npassages in this play are, on the whole, far inferior to those\noccurring in Somadeva\u2019s work.\n\nThe spoken vernaculars of India had in the twelfth\ncentury A.D. developed very far from the stage represented\nby the literary Prakrits, and an author who wished to use\nthose forms of speech in his compositions was, accordingly, obliged to learn Prakrit from literary sources. The manuscripts of older plays were, as we can see from Hemacandra's grammar, at this period much better than now. And a study of them might therefore convey a fair idea of the peculiarities of the various Prakrit dialects. There is no reason for supposing that Somadeva and Vigrahar\u0101ja have not studied their predecessors. But such a study is not sufficient to account for the comparative correctness of the Prakrits, especially in Somadeva's work, and there can be no doubt that there has been another source from which they derived their knowledge. This source cannot be anything else than the Prakrit grammarians.\n\nProfessor Pischel has already a long time ago, when these inscriptions were for the first time made known, drawn attention to the fact that Somadeva's Prakrit is, broadly speaking, in close accordance with the rules laid down in Hemacandra's Prakrit grammar. This is not only the case where Hemacandra's rules are in accordance with the practice in the oldest plays, but often also where his sources have been corrupt. The rich materials collected in Professor Pischel's masterly Prakrit grammar make it a comparatively easy task to state the relation between them, the more so because Professor Kielhorn in footnotes refers the reader to Professor Pischel's book. It is not necessary to go into details in order to show the general agreement of Somadeva's Prakrit with Hemacandra's rules, as this has already been done in a review of Dr. Bloch's \"Vararuci und Hemacandra\" in the G\u00f6ttinger gelehrte Anzeigen, 1894, pp. 478 ff. I shall only make some remarks regarding the instances where Somadeva's Prakrit is incorrect.\n\nA medial t ought to be dropped in M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri. It is, however, in some instances changed to d. Thus, m\u0101l\u0101di, agahida, amupida. It is probable that here we have only to do with ordinary blunders. The Prakrit grammarians teach that t becomes d in certain words, not however in those just quoted. Hemacandra declares that this change is not justified. He admits, however, that instances occur. They\nmust, he informs us, be explained by means of the rule *ryatyayat ca*, according to which the various dialects are freely mixed up with each other. That is to say, that the rules of his grammar may, if convenient, be disregarded. It is characteristic for Hemacandra as a systematic grammarian that the first and last rule about Prakrit teaches to neglect the whole grammar *ad libitum*.\n\nI shall now turn to Somadeva's \u015aauraseni. We here find several orthographic mistakes; thus, final *m* instead of *n*, e.g. *devyam anur\u0101dam \u0113arisam*; *n* instead of *m*, e.g. *Nom\u0101lie* and *Nom\u0101lie*; double consonants in the beginning of words, e.g. *\u1e6d\u1e6dhane, vvavasidam, jjhijjai*; single consonant instead of double ones, e.g. *pacakkha\u012bn, tamapasara*, and so forth. Most of these are probably only slips of the pen. The same is the case with *kitti* for *kim ti*, *ki\u1e47\u1e47a* for *kim na*, *humti* for *honti*, etc. Hemacandra's grammar contains many similar blunders, and they are of no importance. The words of Desaladevi, plate i, l. 37 f., are pure M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri and were perhaps meant as verses.\n\nThere remain, however, several blunders of a more serious kind.\n\nThe form *dupp\u0113ccha*, i, 7 is M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri. The corresponding \u015aauraseni form is *dupp\u0113kkha*. The grammarians do not, however, give any rule about this word.\n\nA *t* between vowels becomes *d* in \u015aauraseni. This rule is usually observed by Somadeva. We find, however, also the M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri form in words such as *\u0113risam, raya\u1e47\u0101im*. These are probably mere slips, and are against the rules of all grammarians, with the exception of the convenient *ryatyayasa* and *bahulam*. Hemacandra commits the same blunder in his Kum\u0101rap\u0101lacarita, a monstrous work which clearly shows how little he really understood of Prakrit. Compare *jinacain\u0101 = jinapatin\u0101*, vii, 94.\n\n*Th* becomes *dh* under the same conditions as those under which *t* is changed to *d*. The rule is, however, according to Hemacandra, iv, 267, and other authorities who copied his statements, only facultative. Somadeva follows this laxer rule and presents forms such as *ma\u1e47oraha, jahattha*.\nThe inflection of nouns and verbs is in accordance with Hemacandra's rules. The locative plural ends in *su*, not in *sum*; thus, *peramtesu*. The grammarians do not give any rule about the formation of this case in \u015aaurasen\u012b. The correct form is, however, probably *sum*; compare Pischel, Grammatik, \u00a7 371.\n\nThe false form *k\u0101mi\u1e47i-ra\u1e47a*, i, 8, is only a misprint for *k\u0101mi\u1e47i*.\n\nThe form *tujjha* for *tuha*, thy, in i, 2, is probably false, but quite in accordance with Hemacandra, who actually gives *tujjha* in \u015aaurasen\u012b, Kum\u0101rap\u0101lacakarita, vii, 101.\n\nIn the inflection of verbs we may note forms such as *gihida*, *huvamti*, *huvidavva\u1e41*, which, though wrong, are not forbidden by Hemacandra. The conjunctive participles in *\u016b\u1e47a*, e.g. *aacch\u016b\u1e47a*, *p\u0113kkhi\u016b\u1e47a*, *k\u0101ri\u016b\u1e47a*, are M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri and not \u015aaurasen\u012b. Hemacandra, however, allows the forms in *d\u016b\u1e47a*.\n\nThe \u015aaurasen\u012b termination of the passive is *iadi*. Hemacandra, however, freely uses the mixed form in *ijjadi*. The same is the case with Somadeva, who writes *p\u0113kkhiyadi*, *jam-pijjadi*, *p\u0113kkhiyanti*, and so forth.\n\nSomadeva's use of the particles *vea* for *iva*, *khu* after *a* and *o*, and *hu* in \u015aaurasen\u012b is probably wrong, but is in accordance with Hemacandra's grammar. The same is the case with the use of *d\u0101ni* for *id\u0101nim* in the beginning of a sentence.\n\nThe only point where Somadeva's \u015aaurasen\u012b differs from Hemacandra is in the particle *jjeva=eva* for Hemacandra's *yyeva*. I think it probable that Somadeva has here followed the practice of older plays.\n\nSeveral of the preceding remarks also apply to the M\u0101gadh\u012b passages in the Lalitav\u012bgrahar\u0101jan\u0101\u1e6daka. Compare forms such as *\u015bal\u016bva\u1e41=svar\u016bpam*, *y\u0101yiyyadi* for *y\u0101yiadi=j\u00f1\u0101yat\u0113*, *hage khu* for *hage kkhu=aham khalu*, *eva=iva*, and so on. All these forms are in accordance with Hemacandra's practice. The same is the case with the substitution of *nd* for *nt* in forms such as *payya\u1e41da=paryanta*. Hemacandra allows this change also in \u015aaurasen\u012b. The change of *nt* to *nd* is now common in Pa\u00f1j\u0101b\u012b, Sindh\u012b, Mult\u0101n\u012b, Naip\u0101l\u012b, and K\u0101\u015bm\u012br\u012b. It is also occasionally met with in the Prem S\u0101gar, from\nwhich work I have noted Vaisandara = Vaibhavantara. Compare Dr. Grierson, ZDMG., l, p. 36. It is therefore probable that such forms are due to the influence of the Western vernaculars spoken in the neighbourhood of Hemacandra's home, just as his Apabhram\u015ba is often pure Gujar\u0101t\u012b. Compare, however, Pischel's Prakrit Grammatik, \u00a7 275.\n\nHemacandra teaches that j, dy, and y in M\u0101gadhi become y and yy. He does not, however, give any such rule for the treatment of the corresponding aspirates. Forms such as nijjhala and yujjha are, therefore, not in disaccord with his grammar. The only point where Somadeva really differs from Hemacandra in his M\u0101gadhi is in the treatment of original k\u1e63, \u015bk, and rth, for which he substitutes \u1e63k, \u1e63k, \u1e63t, and st respectively, instead of Hemacandra's \u1e0dk and sk, sk, and st. I do not think that this disaccord is in reality serious. In Hemacandra, iv, 296, kjasya \u1e0dkah, '\u1e6dk must be substituted for k\u1e63', the jihv\u0101m\u016bliya \u1e0d is not written in any manuscript, but we find k\u1e63 and \u015b instead of it. The same may have been the case in the copy which Somadeva used. We can clearly see how little he was able to distinguish between the different s-sounds in his treatment of rth, which, according to Hemacandra, becomes st. Somadeva has \u015ba\u015bta = s\u0101rtha, but aste = artha, yahastam for yadhastam = yath\u0101rtham, and so on. The same remark holds good with regard to the change of sk to \u015bk instead of Hemacandra's sk. Compare Tulu\u015bka = Turu\u015bka, \u015bu\u015bka = \u015bu\u015bka. Namisadhu, whose source must have been somewhat the same as Hemacandra's, has \u015bk as Somadeva.\n\nI cannot, therefore, see any serious obstacle to the supposition that Somadeva actually used Hemacandra's grammar. It is well known that the courts of S\u0101mbhar and Anhilv\u0101d were in intercourse with each other, and it is therefore quite probable that copies of Hemacandra's grammar were sent to S\u0101mbhar.\n\nThe Harakelin\u0101\u1e6daka also contains some passages in Prakrit, but only in M\u0101h\u0101ra\u1e63\u1e6dri and \u015aauraseni. The two dialects are much more mixed up with each other than was the case in Somadeva's work. But the mistakes are exactly of the\nsame kind. Thus we find -ggahida=grhita in M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri; duggai=durgati; nigga=nirgata, n\u0101ha=n\u0101tha, etc., in \u015aaurasen\u012b. Other mistakes of the Harakelin\u0101\u1e6daka do not occur in the Lalitavigrahar\u0101jan\u0101\u1e6daka, but do not, on the other hand, sin against any of Hemacandra's rules. Compare the locatives samaammi and aggin\u012b, the imperative p\u0113kkhadham, the use of the theme k\u016bp=k\u1e5b in kunehi, and forms such as avid\u012bya, that is abid\u012bya=advitiya, mahad\u0101ru\u1e47a for mah\u0101d\u0101ru\u1e47a, and so on.\n\nThe preceding remarks will have shown that the Prakrit dialects of both plays are not correct, but still, on the whole, in agreement with the teaching of contemporary grammarians. This is of importance for the understanding of the Prakrits and their history. It shows, as does also Hemacandra's grammar, that the knowledge of the different Prakrit dialects was in the twelfth century vague. The old writings had been copied during centuries by more or less ignorant writers, the dialects had been mixed up, and had long ago ceased to be clearly understood. The later grammarians based their works on their predecessors and on the manuscripts, which did not any more faithfully represent the old dialects. But these grammars were used by the authors for their compilations, as they are used to the present day. And we may safely conclude that the common practice had been the same for centuries.\n\nThe fact that we are able to prove that these authors used a Prakrit grammar for their work is of importance, because it conclusively shows that this was the practice, and that the authority of the grammarians can accordingly be, at least to a great extent, relied on when we have to correct Prakrit manuscripts. It is quite irrelevant for this question whether Hemacandra or some related Jaina grammarian was the authority used by Somadeva and Vigrahar\u0101ja.\n\nProfessor Kielhorn's edition is excellent. I have only noted a few misprints. Thus, p. 2, l. 20, k\u0101min\u012b for k\u0101min\u012b; p. 6, l. 19, prad\u0101y=\u0101smad- for prad\u0101y=\u0101smad; p. 7, l. 23, namn=eva for n\u0101mn=eva; p. 8, note 6, bh\u016bsidabbham- for bh\u016bsidabbham-; p. 9, note 2, e\u0101risam for ed\u0101risam; p. 19,\n1. 27 ff., ought to have been printed as verse; p. 24, note 2, calli is correct; compare Karp\u016brama\u00f1jar\u012b, iv, 12b, 16b. I may add that the last Prakrit passage on p. 12 ought to be translated sakala-jagad-eka-pradipa, etc.\n\nThe accompanying plates are very clear, and Professor Kielhorn's Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit passages will prove to be useful.\n\nSTEN KONOW.\n\nSanskrit Grammar for Beginners. By A. A. Macdonell.\n\n(London, 1901.)\n\nThe appearance of Professor Macdonell's Sanskrit Grammar for Beginners will be welcome to those who are entering on the thorny paths of Sanskrit, and still more to those who have to guide them. It is the work of one who has tested by experience the needs of elementary students, and, but for the fact that Vedic reading generally comes early into the course of a Sanskritist, it hardly deserves its modest title, since the student of purely classical Sanskrit will find enough for his needs until he begins the study of the Indian grammarians. The mistake made by many writers on grammar is to suppose that condensation means simplification, and this is by no means the case. It is often easier by the help of the numerous examples given in a large grammar to formulate a rule that can be understood and remembered than to understand the condensed statement in a short grammar, and some of the new simplified grammars of Eastern languages err greatly in that respect. Professor Macdonell has, however, generally avoided this difficulty, though occasional passages would not be very clear to a solitary student.\n\nThe book begins with an interesting short introduction to the history of Sanskrit grammar, which will give pleasure to older students also. The Devan\u0101gar\u012b is transliterated throughout, with the exception of the examples in the syntax and the parts of the irregular verbs, these exceptions\nbeing made in order to compel practice in reading the native alphabet. It may be doubted whether these also should not have been printed in Roman type. Sanskrit students are either obliged to read Devan\u0101gar\u012b, or, in the case of some philological examinations, are purposely exempted from so doing. The latter will be impeded in the use of the syntax and the list of verbs, while the former have probably ample opportunities of learning the character in their reading. Intelligent students, moreover\u2014and most Sanskrit students are intelligent\u2014ought to be able to consult the whole grammar long before they can read the foreign character with ease.\n\nProfessor Macdonell shows his knowledge of a beginner's needs by telling him where to seek in the dictionary for words containing anusv\u0101ra and visarga. The Sandhi rules are very good, but Sandhi is the greatest difficulty in starting Sanskrit, and it would be convenient to have such a table as Dr. B\u00fchler gave in his Leitfaden. The rules on internal Sandhi he wisely suggests should be taken after learning the paradigms. It is questionable whether the arrangement of learning the vowel declensions first, familiar already to classical students, is not better than to start with the more normal endings of the consonant declension. Change of termination demands less mental effort than change of stem, however regular, and, for practical use in reading, the vowel declension is sooner needed than u\u1e63\u1e47ik or sam\u1e5b\u0101t, while the philological student has no difficulty in re-classifying the declensions in his own mind. The paradigms of verbs and the explanations of their formation are very clear, while the chapter on particles is specially useful, and given in great detail for the size of the book. Compound words also, the second great difficulty of the beginner, are well analyzed, while the syntax is excellent and contains all that is necessary for the ordinary reader of classical Sanskrit. There is a useful short appendix on metre, and a second, of eight pages, on Vedic peculiarities. Two pages of the latter are given to an admirable account of Vedic accent. The purpose of this appendix is doubtless to increase\nstudent's thirst for knowledge, for, good as it is, it is hardly sufficient equipment for reading a Vedic hymn.\n\nIt would be interesting to know if, when Professor Macdonell says the five nasals are incorrectly replaced by anusv\u0101ra, and the final m of a sentence wrongly written with the same sign, he would condemn the practice of the Clarendon Press\u2014a system which the student begins by reprobating, but ends, for its saving of the eyes, by blessing.\n\nAltogether, the book is an excellent and scholarly one, written with practical experience of the needs of learners, and already found valuable when tested by the experience of teachers.\n\nC. M. RIDDING.\n\nAlexander S. Khakhanov. Ocherki po Istorii Gruzuskoj Slovesnosti. Vypusk 3: Literatura xiii-xviii vv. Outlines of the History of Georgian Literature. Part 3: Literature from the Thirteenth to the Eighteenth Centuries. (Moscow, 1901.)\n\nThe third volume of the elaborate work of Professor Khakhanov on Georgian Literature treats of the period from the beginning of the thirteenth to the end of the eighteenth century. We have left the classical period and now have to do with others, in which much less poetical merit can be found. As M. Khakhanov says, literary productions are numerous, but they are deficient in originality and style. A large number are translations from Persian, which had a great influence upon Georgian literature. Thus, in the Vardbulbuliani of Teimouraz (1591\u20131663) we have the favourite Persian motif of the loves of the Nightingale and the Rose. References to the originals of these poems can be found in the excellent works of Professor Eth\u00e9, who has done so much for the history of Persian literature. The very interesting version in Georgian of the Alexander-Saga will attract the reader's attention. Mention must be made of the Rostomiani, a version (although not complete) of the\nShah Nameh. Professor Eth\u00e9 gives a catalogue of the translations of Firdousi's great work, but does not appear to mention this.\n\nOne of the most important productions in Georgian of the eighteenth century is the version of the Kalilah va Dimnah made by Tsar Vakhtang VI. The tsar seems to have accomplished his translation partly while imprisoned at Isfahan, whither he had gone to do homage to the Persian king who was his suzerain. The latter, however, was offended with him because he would not turn Mohammedan. Vakhtang translated the prose, but the verse was rendered by the famous Savva Sulkhan Orbeliani, the author of the first Georgian Dictionary. In the introduction Tsar Vakhtang speaks of an earlier version of the twelfth century, which would have been of great interest. This has been considered lost. Professor Khakhanov, however, thinks that he found some fragments of it in the Library of the Georgian Society at Tiflis. The version from which the tsar translated was a Persian redaction of the fifteenth century. Vakhtang died in 1737: he will be always famous in the annals of Georgian literature for having established the Press at Tiflis. The earliest book printed in the Georgian language was a Psalter at Moscow in 1705; the first book which issued from the Tiflis press was an edition of the Gospels in 1709. In 1712 was printed there the work of Rustaveli, Vepkhvis tqaosani, which has now become a great rarity. In 1743 the Georgian Bible appeared at Moscow.\n\nWe must not leave the authors of the eighteenth century without mentioning the Catholicos Antoni, who wrote a famous grammar of his native language, and afterwards under the influence of the Latin monks at Tiflis turned Roman Catholic. Sulkhan Orbeliani, previously mentioned, travelled in the west of Europe, and, besides his dictionary, wrote his famous collection of stories called the \"Book of Wisdom and Lies,\" of which an excellent translation into English has been published by Mr. O. Wardrop.\n\nMr. F. C. Conybeare has also translated the Armenian\nversion of the Khikar, a book which belongs to this period, although not written by Orbeliani. The work of Professor Khakhanov concludes with pieces of apocryphe\u2014the Gospel of Joachim, the birth of the holy Virgin, etc.\n\nThis useful production fills a void, for but little is known about Georgian literature in Europe. Professor Khakhanov has a very readable style. Unfortunately his book is written in Russian, but the number of students of that important language is so continually increasing that it seems idle to talk of a book in the Russian language as being sealed.\n\nW. R. Morfill.\n\nThe Spoken Arabic of Egypt. By J. Selden Willmore, M.A. (London: David Nutt, Long Acre, 1901.)\n\nIn a country which has been during the whole of the past century closely connected with England, and for the last twenty years of it has occupied a very exceptional position under British influence, it is indeed strange that the English-speaking resident should have found himself up to the present without any reliable guide in his own tongue to the language spoken by the people.\n\nYet this has been the case in Egypt. A few English grammars of Arabic have, it is true, given some indications of the Egyptian dialect, but their references to it have been generally merely incidental, and they have so confused it with the literary language, or with other dialects of Arabic, as to be of little value.\n\nWe now have a work which supplies this want. It will be welcomed by those who are desirous of acquiring a practical knowledge of the speech of the country in which they live, but there is another class to which it will be equally acceptable. Students of the Semitic languages will regard it as by no means an unimportant contribution to Semitic philology.\n\nIts author, a well-known resident of Cairo, where he occupies the position of a Judge in the Native Court of\nAppeal, is exceptionally well situated with regard to his undertaking. His judicial office must give him remarkably good opportunities for hearing the speech of all sorts and conditions of men delivered under circumstances that preclude artificiality of diction.\n\nBesides having lived in Cairo for a considerable time he has, we believe, previously passed a number of years at other places in the East, and thus has had the opportunity of acquiring a diversified experience of Oriental life and a knowledge of Eastern languages in addition to Arabic, which, doubtless, he has found of considerable service to him in the execution of his task. We have to thank him for a comprehensive Egyptian-Arabic Grammar, the first that has been written in English which treats the subject on a fitting scale with full detail. It is evident that labour has not been spared in the execution of the work. Those who examine it, when they see the great quantity of interesting material that it contains, will be able to realize the amount of time and trouble that must have been spent on its collection.\n\nA work of this sort, founded on original observation by an author really familiar with the language of which he writes, and resident in the locality where it is spoken, is the only kind that can be of real value as a dialectical study. Yet so much is written on dialects by persons extremely imperfectly qualified, and based on observation made over totally inadequate periods, that the production of such work must be looked upon as the exception rather than the rule, and hence its appearance will be regarded with increased appreciation.\n\nMr. Willmore gives us a volume of some 390 pages, divided into two parts. The first part contains an Accidence; the second a Syntax. There are 74 exercises, consisting of sentences for translation from and into Arabic in the first part, which together with vocabularies and the sections of the Accidence to which they are attached, form a series of graduated lessons. There are also 42 exercises in Arabic for translation into English in the second part, illustrative of the rules of Syntax. In addition to this, two appendices,\none on 'Na\u1e25wi,' the other on provincial pronunciation, besides a vocabulary which gives the meaning of the words occurring in the Syntax exercises that have not been explained in the body of the book, must be mentioned.\n\nThe book contains a number of footnotes by its author, and a few by Professor Sayce, to whom Mr. Willmore in his preface acknowledges his obligation for reading his manuscript, and who supplies a short introduction.\n\nThe Latin character is used throughout, the spelling of Arabic words being generally phonetic, but with some regard to uniformity of spelling, so that words may not be represented in forms in which they might be hard to recognize.\n\nThe volume is well bound, and of a convenient size.\n\nReference to the book would have been much facilitated by the provision of a proper table of contents. Its index is too scanty to be of much use for the purpose, and having had occasion to examine it we feel that this is a real want.\n\nThe study of the Egyptian dialect by Europeans may be said to have been commenced by Burckhardt, whose collection of proverbs, published in 1817, contains the first genuine material of value relating to the subject. It was not, however, until 1880 that the first complete exposition of the grammar of the Cairene language was made, by Spitta in his \"Grammatik des Arabischen Vulg\u00e4rdialectes von Aegypten.\" The importance of this book was immediately appreciated, and it has remained until now the standard authority. Mr. Willmore has been able to supplement and correct the observation of his predecessor, whose work, admirable as it is, could not possibly be expected to be exact in every single particular. Yet the generally unimportant nature of the differences between Mr. Willmore and Spitta on points of fact gives a striking testimony to the care and accuracy of the latter. Spitta's book affords a standard by which Mr. Willmore's book will naturally be compared.\n\nIt appears to be, like that of Spitta, confined almost entirely to the dialect of Cairo. Mr. Willmore makes a few remarks on the idiom of the fellahin, but we think\nwe are right in supposing that he would not claim that his book includes all their forms of speech. He would doubtless justify its title in the same way as Spitta does that of his grammar in his preface.\n\nAn essential difference between Mr. Willmore's treatment of his subject and that of Spitta may now be pointed out.\n\nThe latter continually compares the etymology and syntax of the modern dialect with that of 'classical' Arabic. The former does not keep up a regular comparison between them.\n\nThe reason of this is apparent when the author's preface is examined. From it may be gathered that he does not believe that Cairene is derived from classical Arabic. We understand that the dialect is considered by him to have a separate place in the Semitic family, that is to say, it is derived from some form of Arabic so far removed from the classical as to be really a distinct language, occupying a place beside it similar to that of Hebrew, Ethiopic, or any other of the Semitic group.\n\nTo assert that the Arabic portion of Cairene is all derived from the dialect of Quraish would be so opposed to probability as to be absurd. But the compilations of Arab lexicographers and grammarians are not confined to the 'Quranic.' They cannot be imagined to treat of a single dialect, but to embody the words and practice of a number which, taken together, form what is generally called classical Arabic.\n\nHistorical considerations make it exceedingly improbable, one might almost say quite impossible, that Cairene is derived wholly from any single Arabic dialect, so that it can have a place in the Semitic family similar to that of one of the languages referred to.\n\nIt can hardly be otherwise than derived from a mixture of several Arabic dialects. In the classical compilations we find what appear to be the easily recognizable originals of nearly every one of its Arabic words and forms, whose modification, by readily visible phonetic changes due to the corruption of foreign influence until they have reached their present shape, seems usually easy to trace.\nIt is quite possible that Cairene may have preserved to us a few words or even forms from Arabic dialects outcast by Arab philologers as vulgar or ungrammatical, but if this is kept in view it seems safe to treat it as a derivative of classical Arabic.\n\nIt is not, however, necessary to make any assumption in order to be able to recognize that no other language of which we have any knowledge affords a more useful standard of reference for the comparison of Cairene grammar, without which it can hardly be made intelligible. Mr. Willmore, by ignoring classical Arabic almost wholly, deprives himself of what would have given him the means of elucidating much that he leaves obscure. He generally rejects the services of a guide, whose place is poorly supplied by a little casual assistance that he derives from Hebrew, Syriac, or Amharic.\n\nHe is naturally perfectly right in dissociating the dialect from the written language by rigidly excluding forms of the latter which do not occur in the former. Want of recognition of the obvious fact that the dialect must be treated as thoroughly distinct has long prevailed; it is only lately that the necessity for a proper division has been appreciated, or, at least, has been acted upon. But he appears to tend to the other side, and a bias against the written language pervades his work. What else could induce him to say that words like h\u0101lan, d\u0101iman, daw\u0101man, mar\u0101ran do not in reality belong to the dialect of Cairo?\u00b9 They are in universal use, not only in Cairo, but throughout Egypt. But they belong also to the written language, and preserve the sign of inflection. So, too, do a good many more nouns not mentioned in the list where the words cited are given (e.g., abadan, t\u0101ratan, taqriban, gh\u0101liban, jiddan), whose use is also general. We are therefore told they are borrowed from it. The participles with preformative mu, in some cases the typical form, whose existence destroys attractive analogies with Hebrew, are kept, likewise, well in the background.\n\n\u00b9 \u00a763, p. 54, remark.\nThe book commences with an account of speech sounds. Comparing this with the same section of Spitta's work, one perceives that the latter is more elaborate. Some differences of observation will be noticed on examination. Spitta divides his vowel sounds into \\(a, i, u\\) groups; Mr. Willmore into \\(a, e, i, o, u\\). Why his treatment of the vowel sounds precedes that of the consonants, since the former are influenced by the latter far more than the latter by the former, is not quite evident. The syllable is not dealt with specially; some remarks on it are found under double consonants. We do not see the very peculiar transformation of \\(jim\\) to \\(shin\\) in 'wish' (wajh) noticed on the chapter on transformation of letters. With respect to the pronunciation of vowels we may enquire whether the long \\(a\\) (\\(\u00e2\\)) of kh\u00e2lis, entirely, has the same sound as that of n\u00e1r, fire, or r\u00e2b, it curdled. We think that in the former word its sound is far deeper than in the last two.\n\nIt is true that \\(i\\) followed by 'ain has the sound of the French eu in the word li'b, game (\\$5, p. 4). But it has not this sound under the same circumstances in fi'l, deed, bi't, I sold, simi', he heard; at least we are convinced we have never heard feu'l, beu't, simeu'. The rule at \\$5 seems, therefore, to require modification. Also we agree that the vowel following the \\(t\\) of 'yistiwi,' it is ripe, sounds like a French \\(\u00fc\\) (\\$5, p. 4). To lay down as a rule from this that \\(w\\) following \\(i\\) converts it into the French \\(\u00fc\\) does not, however, seem quite admissible. First, because to do so requires an assumption that the original sound of the vowel following the \\(t\\) in the above word is \\(i\\). It might be reasonably maintained that this vowel is original \\(a\\). But a stronger reason is that \\(w\\) following \\(i\\) does not appear to always give it this \\(\u00fc\\) sound, e.g., diw\u00ee, riw\u00e2iyah, siw\u00e2r, in none of which has the \\(i\\) this sound. Mr. Willmore tells us that the final consonants of ab, akh, and some other words of this sort are doubled, but not in the construct form (\\$24, p. 23). A doubled consonant closing a syllable would be pronounced in exactly the same way as a single one: its duplication could only be apparent when it is followed by a 'helping' vowel. We venture to doubt that these words are always\npronounced abbe, etc., and think that the statement referred to cannot be accepted without reservation.\n\nThere is a great deal more in Mr. Willmore's phonetics that requires careful consideration. We will only briefly refer to the long lists of words spelt in Arab dictionaries with i, i, e, and z, which are pronounced in the dialect of Cairo i, i, e, or z. Leaving out of consideration one or two cases, p. 12; aimaz, p. 15, which are not spelt in any ordinary Arabic dictionary as represented, the correctness of the rendering of the pronunciation of some of the others, such as qatir, qatt, qar, etc., instead of sugar, etc., might be tested by some one on the spot to see whether the consonants are really transmitted in the manner indicated, or, as we are inclined to think, a thickening of the vowel has not produced the idea that the consonants have changed.\n\nThe spelling of Arabic words appears, generally speaking, good throughout the book. The helping or semi-vowels are not as a rule represented. They can easily be supplied by the reader himself, but it is hard to explain the reason of the omission of the sign for hamzah qat before a vowel, p. 16, note 2, or to understand how the presence of this hamzah can be divined when it is not indicated. When many poems are written, how is anyone to know that it must be pronounced marta?\n\nThere are a few words of which the spelling seems open to question, such as p. 471, and qatir, p. 15, hamza qatir, p. 16, hajjatir, etc. Possibly, p. 16, qatir, qatir, possibly misprints, p. 16, qatir, and other elsewhere page 169, page 169, p. 16, and possibly qatir, qatir.\n\nThe hamzah wa, a, appears frequently as a. It may be doubted whether this is a strictly accurate representation of any form which it assumes.\n\nA few remarks may be made on the Accidence which follows. Some of the general rules might have been laid down with more emphasis, and a clearer distinction might have been drawn between them and what may afterwards be treated upon as exceptions. To illustrate this remark\nmay be made to the article dealing with the formation of the relative adjective. It will be seen that only one of the forms mentioned in \u00a7 44 is described as \"but sparingly used\" (remark d). But surely others of the forms given are also extremely rare; for example, that which is formed by the addition of \u0101ti. It would be possible also to give some fuller information with respect to the application of the other terminations and the conditions under which they are used, besides some idea as to the relative frequency of their occurrence. Again, a number of broken plurals are formed so frequently from certain forms of singular that they may be considered as the regular plurals of words in these forms. These might well have been pointed out for the assistance of the learner (\u00a7 91). The rules for the formation of quadriliterals (\u00a7 S3, p. 80), etc., appear far simpler when given in the usual way than as they are stated.\n\nThe formation of nouns from roots is not explained in a way that would make it very clear to anyone without previous knowledge (v. \u00a7\u00a7 228, 131, which treat of the matter). Full justice does not seem to be done to this part of the subject.\n\nAttention may be drawn to a few rules that occur in this part of the book.\n\n\u00a7 40. \"The indefinite [article] w\u00e2hid agrees in gender and number with its noun.\" Spitta (\u00a7 114, b, p. 252) by no means corroborates the universality of this rule. He appears to make the agreement of w\u00e2hid with a feminine the exception (\"gew\u00f6hnlich beim Femin. nicht ver\u00e4ndert\"). In \u00a7\u00a7 64-67 the correctness of the rule relative to the forms assumed by nouns ending in a to which a noun in the genitive is annexed depends on whether the words ending in \u0101, which it is stated do not undergo any change when followed by a word in the genitive, can properly be written phonetically as ending with a long a.\n\nBut we know that in the great majority of cases this spelling does not represent their pronunciation in the dialect. Mr. Willmore tells us so himself (remark a, p. 56). The rule, then, appears of no service at all: the form in which it\ncould be given is obvious, but the author's aversion to the classical language seems to prevent him stating it in an intelligible manner.\n\nIt must be remarked that if the rule stated in \u00a7 66 is correct, ruyasit (ru'asit) Ma\u1e63r, Khulafit Ma\u1e63r will be regularly formed combinations and, as far as we understand the rule, ruyas\u00e2 (ru'as\u00e2) Ma\u1e63r, Khulaf\u00e2 Ma\u1e63r would not be admissible. But with the suffixed personal pronoun, according to \u00a7 121, remark b, p. 105, one can say either ruyas\u00e2ya and Khulaf\u00e2hum or ruyas\u00e2ti and Khulaf\u00e2thum, but ruyasiti and Khulafithum would not be allowable. Such a remarkable usage of the dialect certainly requires corroboration.\n\n\u00a7 73, note 1. Mr. Willmore informs us that Spitta is mistaken in stating that widn, ear, has a dual form, and also in giving abbahen, ummahen, as the duals of 'abb' and 'umm.' We cannot pretend to say which is right.\n\nWith regard to a statement in \u00a7 79 to the effect that almost all nouns ending in iy\u00e2 make their plurals in \u00e2t, the exceptions to this rule seem so numerous that we think it can hardly be accepted. As far as the writer's personal experience enables him to judge, very many common words such as, e.g., ma'addiyah, zarbiya, qadiya, would not admit of a plural being formed in this manner: indeed, it seems difficult to call to mind many substantives of Arabic form ending in iy\u00e2 except such as denote the abstract idea of the primitive noun, that usually make their plurals in the manner described.\n\nIn the chapter on the pronoun we find (\u00a7 112, remark b), \"with the negative particles ma and sh ana becomes manish\" (manish as well). This is correct, but turning to \u00a7 120 we find that precisely the same form, manish, is regarded as a combination of the verbal suffix with negative particles! The statement in this latter paragraph, that the suffixes have with the negative particles the forms which they assume as objects of the verb, is, we submit, altogether a mistaken one. It is hardly necessary to spend time in demonstrating the fact that the suffixes are not attached to the negative particle, as Mr. Willmore himself, in the\nfirst of the extracts cited, has contradicted the theory which he gives in the second. One of the most extraordinary statements in the Accidence is that which makes inta\u1e93ar to be a verb of the form inbarak (\u00a7 173, p. 146). As one cannot believe that Mr. Willmore would seriously wish to derive this form from a stem \u2018ta\u1e93ar,\u2019 it must be looked upon as a slip; but upon it an exception is made to a rule to which we are unable to call to mind any exception, namely, that the sense of verbs of the form inbarak is never active. A mistake of this sort is enough to shake one\u2019s confidence in the whole book.\n\nThe chapters on the pronoun and verb are very full and will be read with interest.\n\nGeneral rules are laid down with regard to the vocalization of the aorist of most forms of the simple verb. This is, we believe, the first time that any system with respect to it has been demonstrated. Spitta (p. 207) was unable to fully establish one. In spite of somewhat numerous exceptions, Mr. Willmore\u2019s rules seem very useful, and great credit is due to him for his successful investigation of this difficult matter.\n\nIt may be noted that Spitta gives us examples of itfi\u2018il as well as itfa\u2018al; we understand Mr. Willmore to admit only of itfa\u2018al (v. \u00a7 168, p. 141). The former mentions it\u2018izim, itfihim (Spitta, p. 199), which the latter renders it\u2018azam, itfaham (Vocab., pp. 141, 142).\n\nFor the aorist of waqaf Spitta gives jyqaf (yiqaf) (p. 223, near foot) as a possible form; we do not find this form (which we never remember having heard, and are certain must be somewhat rare if it still exists) in Mr. Willmore\u2019s book (\u00a7 192, p. 166).\n\nA suggestion may here be hazarded on the writer\u2019s own responsibility that the assimilation of the preformative with the initial waw of verbs which have that letter for their first radical, does occasionally give rise to the sound au = o nearly, in their imperatives and aorists. Thus we think Au\u2018\u0101 (\u014d\u2018\u0101)\u00b9 will be heard as often as \u016b\u0101, tauqaf as well as t\u016bqaf.\n\n\u00b9 See Mr. Willmore, p. 87 vocab., for \u014d\u2018\u0101.\nBesides this, those who can hear the dialect spoken may consider whether the vowel sound of the preformative of the aorist in other cases is not \\( e \\) as frequently as \\( i \\). The rule given by Mr. Willmore (\\$140) that the vowel of the preformative syllable persons of the aorist other than the 1st pers. sing. is \\( i \\), although subsequently modified, appears to us too absolute even for strong verbs.\n\nNeither of these views is supported by Spitta or by Mr. Willmore, so they must be put forward with due diffidence.\n\nComing to the prepositions, doubt may be expressed as to the correctness of the classification of lamma among them. Presumably, in some such expressions as ru\u1e25t lamma\\(^1\\)...l bait, it is considered to have the function of a preposition. The construction here seems to be elliptical, and we think lamma ought to be regarded as an adverb. At any rate, if it is a preposition it is an undeveloped one. It cannot surely take the pronominal suffixes. As \u2018ala represents the literary ila (\\$242, note), something more than \u2018on,\u2019 \u2018against,\u2019 should be given for its meaning.\n\nThere are excellent lists of adverbs and conjunctions. An addition that might perhaps be made to the former is the interrogative particle \u2018a.\u2019 Although Spitta (p.168) hardly seems justified in thinking that this \u2018a\u2019 appears in \u00e4zai, ezai (which by the bye is generally pronounced izzey or ezzey), since the first part of that compound is surely nothing more than the interrogative pronoun \u2018ai\u2019 (ey), yet unless recollection is wholly unreliable \u2018a\u2019 affixed to the negative particle \u2018ma\u2019 does occur frequently in such phrases as ama aqul lak, Do not I tell you.\n\nAppendix A, on Nahwi, contains one or two visible errors. It is needless to particularly mention each one. With regard to provincial pronunciation we wonder whether Mr. Willmore is quite correct in entirely excluding the pronunciation of jim as \\( j \\). Spitta emphatically agrees with him (p.5), but he does not seem to have had very much experience of the\n\n\\(^1\\) No example of the use of lamma as a preposition seems to be given.\nprovinces. The writer believes he has heard jim pronounced as \\( j \\) in Upper Egypt by peasants not 'Bedwins,' but he has to depend on his memory and he cannot assert positively that this is the case. He is able, however, to vouch for the transformation of jim into \\( d \\) in the speech of some natives of the southern provinces, generally Copts. They pronounce jebel, debel, etc. This peculiarity is well known to Egyptians; it appears to arise from an inability to pronounce the letter, and may therefore be looked upon more as a defect of speech than as dialectical variation. It may be mentioned since the letter to which the jim is changed is remarkable if its original pronunciation by their fellows is \\( g \\).\n\nIn his Syntax Mr. Willmore has possibly found himself hampered by his destination of his book for two purposes, that of a practical manual and that of a grammar for the use of students. The standpoint from which the syntax is viewed seems rather that of showing how English expressions may be rendered into Cairene Arabic than of explaining the relations expressed in that language by the combination of its words in speech and the manner of the construction of its sentences. The arrangement of this part of the book certainly does not compare favourably with that of Spitta's grammar. One does not find Spitta's orderly sequence, his careful subdivision of his topic into sections, the subject of each of which is thoroughly discussed under its proper heading with a rigid exclusion of irrelevant matter. One misses also his lucid explanations of broad general principles. A grasp of the spirit of the language is essential in order to make the intricate and difficult syntax anything more than a hopeless puzzle. More consideration of the principles of the grammar of the literary language would have facilitated the exposition of many things that are left far from clear.\n\nSome of the rules given appear to be unduly minute, and to make distinctions the validity of which seems extremely doubtful; in other cases matters which are really important are hardly noticed, or receive what seems inadequate attention. Instances of the former are such as the rule in\n\u00a7 282, that the second noun of two nouns in the vocative, \"especially if denoting a high office,\" may take the definite article instead of the interjection being repeated. Or the rule as to the particular concord of the verb with the word ghanam, of which we learn in \u00a7 461, remark b: \"With the words 'askar, soldiers, troops, and ghanam, sheep,' the verb is put in the fem. singular. . . . Il 'askar gum may be also said, but not il ghanam gum.\" Examples of this kind could be multiplied; it is not necessary to add to them. They show the character of the rules referred to.\n\nOn the other hand, no separate section of the syntax deals with the relation between subject and predicate. The only mention that is made of the nominal predicate at all seems to be in the chapter on the adjective. It is there generally dealt with at the same time as the attributive adjective. The adverbial relation is also hardly sufficiently discussed. What relates to it is divided between the chapter on verbs, transitive and intransitive, and that on the noun, but there is little information given that makes the practice of the language with respect to the adverbial use of nouns clear.\n\nWhat is said about the relative pronouns also does not clearly explain the peculiar principles of their use, and comes partly under the heading Possessives and Suffixes, partly under Relative Pronoun.\n\nSome of the rules of Syntax appear rather loosely worded, and statements which are demonstrably not accurate occur. A few specimens of these may be noticed.\n\nIn \u00a7 248(b) we are told that the definite article is used in Arabic where not expressed in English \"with names (nouns) followed by a demonstrative pronoun.\" Anyone reading this would draw the obvious inference that with nouns preceded by a demonstrative pronoun the practice is as in English. This is, of course, not intended, as it is not the case.\n\nIn \u00a7 277 Mr. Willmore says that a noun immediately following a predicate and limiting or specifying its action may be regarded as an accusative of extent, and gives for an\nexample Kabir es sinn, saying in a note that the noun in literary Arabic takes the sign of the accusative. That the note is absolutely erroneous, as far as this example is concerned, is quite beyond dispute; no deep knowledge of literary Arabic is required to be aware that 'sinn' would be in the genitive.\n\nAgain, we are informed, in \u00a7 288, that in the sentence Shufte w\u00e2hid dir\u00e2'u maks\u00fbrah there is an ellipse of the relative pronoun illi, etc. But we know from the usage of Arabic and, indeed, of all Semitic languages that this sentence ought not to be regarded as elliptical.\n\nIn \u00a7 430 the statement that \"the relative is not expressed when the antecedent is indefinite\" is, we think, hardly the right way of saying that relative sentences are annexed to an immediately preceding indefinite substantive without the aid of a conjunctive noun. If this be thought hypercritical there can, at any rate, be little doubt that the direct inference to be drawn from \u00a7 433, viz., that m\u00e2, which is a relative pronoun, may have an indefinite antecedent, is irreconcilable with the rule in \u00a7 430 just referred to. We should like to know an example of the use of m\u00e2 with an expressed antecedent definite or indefinite. Apparently in cases like Kaffit ma 'andu (\u00a7 433, c) Mr. Willmore looks on Kaffit as the antecedent of ma!\n\nIt is quite evident that the real distinction between ma and illi has not been apprehended by him, so it is hardly to be wondered that he fails to make it clear.\n\nAfter this we are not surprised to see that m\u00e2 \"may take the pronominal suffixes\" (p. 270, line 1), an example of which, we suppose, is that given below\u2014'ala qadde m\u00e2hum 'nuzin. This sort of assertion does not require serious refutation.\n\nIn \u00a7\u00a7 263, 426, \u1e25agit eh is classed as an instance of the partitive genitive, doubtless on the strength of the t in \u1e25agit. With this we must express dissent, based on the meaning of the phrase, which will admit of two interpretations, but not, in our opinion, of the one given.\n\nAbout r\u00e2khar we are told (\u00a7 330, remark d) that \"it\nalways agrees with the subject of the sentence.\" This hardly seems right. We take from Spitta, \u00a7 125 (a), r\u0101khar rabat\u016bh, where it agrees with the object. Without this example we should have been sure that 'r\u0101khar' could and often does stand in apposition to and agree with the object or with any substantive.\n\n\u00a7 376 tells us that even adjectives used as adverbs will sometimes take the pronominal suffixes. A little later, in \u00a7 390, we read that pronominal suffixes are \"rarely appended to adjectives, and then only of course when they are used as substantives.\"\n\nFrom this it follows that in the example given in the first paragraph referred to ('beyinhu khayif') beyin must be regarded as used as a substantive, and also from the terms of that paragraph that beyin is used as an adverb in this sentence.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to argue that beyin is not, in this case, an adjective used as a substantive; the only way in which it can be made out to be an adverb, as far as we can see, is that in English we can translate it by 'apparently.' But the correct equivalent of the phrase, which shows its construction, is '[it is] apparent that he is afraid.' That beyin is an adjective, the predicate of a suppressed subject, appears to us not open to question. And we are not able to admit that the example is an instance of the annexation of a pronominal suffix to an adjective. Such a construction is, we believe, impossible from the relation expressed by the attachment of these suffixes to a noun, due to the fact that they are by nature defined.\n\nA reasonable interpretation can be found on the theory of the phrase being a contraction of beyin innahu khayif, which Arabic grammar would lead one to expect, and the facility of the assimilation of n's will support.\n\nAll through the chapter on verbs, transitive and intransitive, we notice no distinction between the direct object of a verb and its adverbial complement. Thus, in \u00a7 550 we gather that in the expression ana fidilte mahalli, mahalli is regarded as 'the object' of fidilte. Similarly, in the\nexamples \u00a7 554 (c) malit el k\u00fbz moiya, moiya is the second object of malit. It must be said that a note after this paragraph informs us that this object might be regarded as a \"mere complement.\" Of course all depends on what is meant by the term object. If it is used in its ordinary meaning of \"the word which stands for the object of the action described by the verb,\" as appears to be done, then surely neither mahalli nor moiyah are the objects of their verbs.\n\nIf 'object' is intended to include all limiting adjuncts of a verb, we see no difficulty in saying that Ramad\u00e2n is the object of S\u00e2m in the expression S\u00e2m Ramad\u00e2n. But in this case a verb may have more than two objects, and the character of the various relations they express ought to be explained.\n\nWe have not been able to discover anything about the noun used to indicate the condition of the subject or object of a verb, the 'h\u00e2l' of Arabic. It is quite impossible to discuss all the rules of syntax in a moderate space, and would be futile. There are a great many with which we by no means agree, and consider as either misleading or wrong in principle.\n\nA useful list of examples of the use of the various prepositions, and another of stock expressions in use on the occurrence of common events and the usual replies to them, will both be found of interest.\n\nThere remains to be mentioned a difference between Mr. Willmore and Spitta relative to the concord of the verb. The former, if we understand him rightly, makes the concord depend on the question of the definition or indefiniteness of the subject rather than its position with respect to the verb, which he regards as a subsidiary condition. The latter does not adopt this view.\n\nSpitta, in his chapter on reflexives, mentions the well-known instance of the use of the pronominal suffixes to denote the reflexive pronouns as direct objects of the verb khalla. Mr. Willmore seems to have overlooked this.\n\nWe ought to be informed of the source from which the\nexercises on syntax have been derived. The same remark applies to the examples throughout the book. Spitta gives us a description of the way in which his \"Sprachjagd\" was conducted. He assures us definitely that all the data on which his grammar is based are taken from the spontaneous speech of natives, collected in a manner which he describes. He tells us the origin of his longer prose pieces. Mr. Willmore ought to give similar information about the collection of his material. We do not find that he does so. In the absence of any it is not possible to feel the same confidence in Mr. Willmore's exercises as we can feel in those of Spitta.\n\nWe do not think that Mr. Willmore's prose contains words and combinations which are not in use. But the phraseology of some of the pieces strikes one as rather strange. Long sentences strung together with leinn, which occur very often, hardly appear typically idiomatic; the tendency of Cairene speech is, we believe, to break up sentences and to avoid complex construction.\n\nAn abnormal frequency of explanations of simple terms prefaced by ya'ni suggests conversation to a foreigner rather than from one native to another. After reading some of the pieces we are left with the impression that a native talking naturally would hardly have told the story in this way. Possibly this impression is mistaken. A satisfactory account of the manner in which the exercises were obtained, and a certainty that if they have been taken down from the mouths of native speakers sufficient precautions were taken to ensure their having been delivered in a wholly natural style, would give a guarantee of their reliability.\n\nIn conclusion, we may say that Mr. Willmore's book, by its comprehensiveness and its elaboration, claims a foremost place as a standard authority. Such a book must necessarily be submitted to the most searching examination before it attains the position which it will reach provided that it is proved to be thoroughly reliable.\n\nThe comments which we have made in the foregoing remarks concern matters that are not, we think, without some importance, but are far secondary to the accuracy of\nits data. With respect to this, we have been only able to point out one or two differences between Mr. Willmore and the only recognized authority that is available, and to make a remark or two on our own responsibility, which we put forward with a full knowledge of the unreliability of memory. The test of the accuracy of the representation of the dialect, which is the most important part of the book, must be made by those living in Egypt who have opportunities for comparison with the actual speech they hear. If the result is, as we believe it will be, to establish its general trustworthiness on matters of fact, then any slight imperfections that it may contain in respect to their co-ordination and arrangement will become of very minor moment.\n\nA. R. Guest.\n\nArabic Manual. (Luzac, 1901.)\n\nThis is another work on colloquial Arabic, by Mr. F. E. Crow, late H.B.M. Vice-Consul at Beirut, dealing with the Syrian dialect. It is not intended to be in any way exhaustive, but merely to serve as a practical manual for the use of visitors to Syria and Palestine. For this purpose it will doubtless be useful. It consists of a sketch of Arabic grammar followed by an excellent and comprehensive vocabulary of words in common use. The Arabic of the grammar and vocabulary is that of Beirut. As a rule, the vocabulary gives the plurals of nouns, and indicates also the formation of the tenses of the verbs, a most desirable aid to those for whom it is intended, the necessity of which is frequently overlooked in guides of the kind. One wonders why the plurals have not been given in every single case, and for what reason they are occasionally omitted.\n\nFollowing the vocabulary is a series of dialogues in the Damascus dialect. These dialogues appear to be well chosen and to deal with subjects that the ordinary traveller will be likely to require.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nIt should be said that the European character is used throughout. Altogether, Mr. Crow's book seems to be well adapted to the purpose for which it is intended, and it will also not be without interest to those who wish to take a general view of the present dialects of Syria.\n\nA. R. G.\n\nEin S\u00fchngedicht der Bonpo. Edited by Dr. Berthold Laufer. Reprinted from vol. xlvi of the Denkschriften der Kaiserliche Academie der Wissenschaften in Wien. (Wien, 1900.)\n\nThe work of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s is bearing fruit now, not only in the interest felt by Sanskritists in the Buddhist works of Tibet, but in the labours of a few scholars who are devoting themselves to its indigenous literature. Of this we have a proof in Ein S\u00fchngedicht der Bonpo, edited by Dr. B. Laufer from MS. 52 in the Schlagintweit Collection at the Bodleian, treating of the sacrifice to be offered by man, as tiller of the soil, to the nature deities, whose haunts are troubled by his works. Its date and author are unknown, but a reference to the 'Land of the Three Valleys' and certain dialect forms point to West Tibet as its home. By a process that combines minute statistics with sympathetic imagination, Dr. Laufer shows how the poem, though containing only about 300 lines, is not all the work of one period. A metrical analysis resolves the verses into those consisting respectively of two, three, or four dissyllabic feet followed by one accented syllable, as e.g.\n\n\"y\u00fal la | m\u00ed ma | mkh\u00e1n,\"\n\nwhich is the normal verse.\n\nThe occurrence of many irregular verses he explains as due sometimes to names of deities which do not fit the metre, occasionally to a desire to give dignity by a full rounding of the verse, but most frequently to an extra syllable connected with monosyllabic pronominal words or\naffixes, especially the word *der*. For the facts we have\nstatistics; the human element comes in the explanation.\nIt appears that the MS. was not copied, but written\nfrom dictation, and may perhaps be a school exercise,\neven verbal directions given by the dictator being sometimes\ninserted in the text. The metre demands condensation and\nfulness of meaning, and the teacher tries to obviate the\nobscurity thus produced by adding particles to indicate\nthe construction. For instance, the couplet\n\n\" klu g\u00f1an sa bdag sgrog\nklu g\u00f1en sa bdag thar\"\n\nbecomes enlarged for the pupil's help into\n\n\" klu g\u00f1an sa bdag gi sgrog yan\nklu g\u00f1en sa bdag gi thar ram phye.\"\n\nMany of these lengthened lines form a helpful commentary\nto the text, and while the textual critic must separate them\nthe translator will use the help they afford. We get a vivid\npicture of the patient teacher, also a West Tibetan, and the\npuzzled or inattentive pupil putting down at random the\nremarks of the teacher or the words of the text. We are\neven allowed to conjecture that the addition at the end,\nquite at variance with the metrical scheme of the rest, is\nan exercise in style by the pupil. Dr. Laufer is careful to\nsuggest this only as a hypothesis, but it is one which may\nwell be true. Rhyme is not uncommon, and alliteration is\noften used.\n\nThree kinds of verse are distinguished. The single line,\nwhich Dr. Laufer calls *Typical*, which is repeated in different\nplaces to serve as \"leit-motif\"; the *Parallel* verse, such as\n\n\" sgrog tu bcags nas hdug\nnad kyi bcins nas hdug\";\n\nand the *Corresponding* verse, which repeats part of\na previously expressed whole to bring in a new thought.\nThe first brings the leading idea of the poem and its logical\nconclusion, the second gives form and colour to single\nthoughts, and the third weaves the parts into a whole. It\nis this variety of artistic handling, combined with directness, that gives the poem its charm.\n\nSections on phonetics, morphology, syntax, and lexicography deal in a full and scholarly manner with the fresh knowledge gained from the text. Among them we may note variations in Sandhi, the spelling ro for rea, which shows its pronunciation, and the use of ba after another determinative with a noun of relationship, which is also the subject of the sentence.\n\nThe poem falls into two parts, the picture of the primitive world and its contest with man.\n\nIt begins with the creation. \"In the first season of the world naught was. In the chaos that has no beginning were created the elements in their turn. Moisture and water arose: from the earth, stirred up by the water, arose moisture and lakes. Then the lakes overflowed and formed many a spring, and in these lay the N\u0101ga cities.\" The eight N\u0101ga kings arose, Ananta, Tak\u1e63aka, etc., and N\u0101gas of the four castes, with the C\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la caste in addition. Then arose the kings of the g\u00f1an, rulers of the regions, and among others the Four Raging Brothers, the Four destroyed by sin, and the Four g\u00f1an of the year. To them were added the Earth-potentates, among whom we notice the Lord of Stones, with a pig's head, the Lord of Water, with the head of a water dragon, the Lord of Wood, with a panther's head, and the Flamingo, Lord of the Wind, while their followers were scorpions with long stings, ants with flat bodies, golden-eyed fishes, shell-white butterflies, and other creatures. \"Fearlessly they dwelt in wood, fearlessly they dwelt in rock, fearlessly they dwelt on the earth.\" Then the land had a name, but no man dwelt therein. But in the land of Skos the King and Queen had two sons, the Elder and the Younger Brother, who worked evil. \"They took the land in possession; they turned it into ploughland; they cleft rocks and built castles; they cut off water and collected it in tanks; they felled wood and burnt it on the hearth.\" Such sinful deeds did they bring to pass, and hated Earth-potentates, N\u0101gas, and g\u00f1an, and destroyed\ntheir followers. \"Then in wrath the N\u0101ga host spread abroad like a lake; the g\u00f1an host was violent as the wind; the Earth-potentates' host crashed down like a rock,\" and brought upon the sons of Skos, the Elder and the Younger Brother, disease, crippling, deafness, and deformity. And a witch consulted by the King and Queen of Skos said that in such transgressions as these she had no power to help. Meanwhile the N\u0101gas, g\u00f1an, and Earth-potentates cried out for a loosing of their fetters, and the Skos King and Queen prepared a feast of reconciliation, to which they called the Tha\u0144 po and the Winged Beings (mythical beings of uncertain nature), and these demanded the presence of the Bon worshippers belonging to N\u0101gas and g\u00f1an. These came and received rich gifts, with drugs to heal their ills. Among other preparations the King and Queen \"drew on white Chinese paper the land and the castles, and the shapes of N\u0101gas, g\u00f1an, and Earth-potentates, as large as life. Three days they heaped up gifts, and three nights with hymns and blessings gave them to the injured deities. They mended the severed bodies of the ants with red cotton, and the wings of the butterflies with blue N\u0101ga silk. Then the sons of Skos were anointed with nectar, and healed of their diseases\"; and the poem ends with the words\u2014\n\n\"The fruitful earth is reconciled,\nThe crooked is made straight:\nIn the Three Valleys of Lahul contentment reigns . . .\nMay Earth-potentates, N\u0101gas, and g\u00f1an be at ease,\nFor Earth-potentates, N\u0101gas, g\u00f1an, and the offerers of gifts are reconciled.\"\n\nIn addition to the interest of folklore and the increase of our small knowledge of the Bo\u00fc religion, the unusual simplicity and directness of this short poem make it, especially with the help of the German translation Dr. Laufer has provided, an excellent book for the beginner in Tibetan. Its style is not the artificial one produced by translating Buddhist Sanskrit, but a genuine product of the country.\nIts merits are those of the best ballad poetry, and we may hope to see in it the firstfruits of a literature valuable both for its intrinsic beauty and its human interest, while it promises well for Tibetan scholarship that its pioneers keep before them so high an ideal of scholarly work as is here visible.\n\nC. M. Ridding.\n\nThe first part of vol. iv of the *Mittheilungen des Seminars f\u00fcr Orientalische Sprachen, zweite H\u00e4lfte, Westasiatische Studien* (1901), is devoted to the conclusion of Mr. Wilhelm Padel's article on recent laws concerning landed property. This is followed by an article on the study of Turkish *Grundbuchwesen* by Count von Mulinen. Two other articles, the first by Dr. B. Meissner, the second by P. L\u00e9on Pourri\u00e8re (written in French), deal with the Arabic dialects of Ir\u0101q and Aleppo, and are of considerable interest. Both begin with a survey of the peculiarities of the dialects in question, and are supplemented by a number of proverbs with translation and philological notes. There are many instances in the Qor\u0101n where the term *mathal* is applied to sayings and sentences of every kind, and Dr. Meissner was therefore well advised not to omit anything which seemed worthy of notice. It is altogether greatly to the credit of the *Mittheilungen* that they pay so much attention to Arabic dialectology, a field not sufficiently cultivated in this country. The lack of a centre to train young scholars in this branch becomes more marked every year. Dr. Barthold concludes his very useful essay on the writings by Russian students on Western Asiatic literature. Professor Brockelmann publishes an ancient Arab recension of the legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, and Dr. Foy contributes a study on the oldest Turkish texts in Gothic transcription.\nThe Lament of B\u0101b\u0101 T\u0101hir, being the Rub\u0101'iyat of B\u0101b\u0101 T\u0101hir, Hamad\u0101n\u012b ('Ury\u0101n). The Persian text edited, annotated, and translated by Edward Heron-Allen, and rendered into English verse by Elizabeth Curtis Brenton. pp. xxii and 86. (London: Quaritch, 1902.)\n\nThe importance and extent of the literature of the Persian dialects has hitherto scarcely been adequately appreciated; and, so far as we can judge from a careful examination of the older documents bearing on Persian literary history, this literature was in early times, especially during the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries of our era, much more important and extensive. Verses in dialect, which are, unfortunately, but seldom wholly intelligible to us, are constantly cited in historical works, treatises on prosody and rhyme, and the like, with evident approval and consideration, as productions worthy of serious attention; and we read of extensive works both in prose and verse, such as the Marzub\u0101n-n\u0101ma and Niki-n\u0101ma of Marzub\u0101n, the son of Rustam, the son of Sharw\u012bn Par\u012bm, a scion of one of the noble families of \u1e6cabarist\u0101n who lived towards the end of the tenth century of our era, composed entirely in one or other of the Persian dialects.\n\nOf all these dialect-poems, however, few are at the present day much known in Persia outside their own districts save those of B\u0101b\u0101 T\u0101hir. Concerning this mysterious individual but little is known, and the oldest and fullest account of him which I have met with occurs in the unique Schefer MS. of a contemporary history of the Selj\u016bqs entitled R\u0101\u1e25atu's-Sud\u016br wa \u0100yatu's-Sur\u016br, now No. 1,314 of the Suppl\u00e9ment persan in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris. Of this valuable and interesting history, which was composed in A.H. 599 (A.D. 1202\u20133), and of which this MS. was transcribed in A.H. 635 (A.D. 1238), I intend to publish a full account in the next two numbers of this Journal. This will include the text (f. 43b of the MS.) of the passage\nconcerning B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir, of which the translation runs as follows:\n\n\"I have heard that when Sult\u00e1n \u1e6cughril Beg came to Hamad\u00e1n, there were there three aged and saintly men, B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir, B\u00e1b\u00e1 Ja'far, and Shaykh \u1e24amsh\u00e1. Hard by the Gate of Hamad\u00e1n is a hill called Khi\u1e0dr, on which they abode. The Sult\u00e1n's glance fell upon them; he halted his army, dismounted, and approached them with his Minister, Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r al-Kundur\u00ed, and kissed their hands. B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir, who was somewhat crazy in his manner, said to him, 'O Turk, what wilt thou do with God's people?' 'Whatever thou commandest,' replied the Sult\u00e1n. B\u00e1b\u00e1 said, 'Do rather that which God commands: \"Verily God enjoineth justice and well-doing\"' (Qur'\u00e1n, xvi, 92). The Sult\u00e1n wept and said, 'I will do so.' B\u00e1b\u00e1 took his hand, saying, 'Dost thou accept this from me?' 'Yes,' answered the Sult\u00e1n. B\u00e1b\u00e1 had on his finger the top of a broken ewer (ib\u1e6diq), from which he had for years performed his ablutions. This he removed, and placed it on the Sult\u00e1n's finger, saying, 'Thus do I confide to thy hand the empire of the world: be just!' And the Sult\u00e1n always treasured this amongst his amulets, and when a battle was impending he would place it on his finger. Such was the purity of his faith and the sincerity of his belief; for in the Religion of Mu\u1e25ammad there was none more pious than he, nor more vigilant.\"\n\nNow this meeting must have taken place about A.H. 447 (= A.D. 1055\u20136: cf. Houtsma's ed. of al-Bund\u00e1ri's History of the Selj\u00faqs, pp. 12, 13, and 15), and thus, though the date of B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir's death (A.H. 410) given by Rida-quli Kh\u00e1n in his excellent Riy\u00e1\u1e0du'l-'\u0100rif\u00edn (lith. T\u00edhr\u00e1n, A.H. 1305; p. 102) is evidently a mistake, the poet belongs without doubt to the early Selj\u00faq period, so that his simple and plaintive quatrains\u2014his \"lament,\" as Mr. Heron-Allen appropriately terms them\u2014which are still widely sung and recited in Persia, are nearly nine hundred years old.\n\nThese quatrains were published with a French translation\nand notes by M. Cl\u00e9ment Huart in the *Journal Asiatique* for 1885 (ser. viii, vol. vi, pp. 502\u2013545); and Mr. Heron-Allen, who is already well known to students of Persian literature by his contributions to the extensive literature connected with 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m, and more particularly by his final settlement of the vexed question as to how far Fitzgerald's famous rendering of the Quatrains represents the Persian original,\u00b9 has now, making use of all the available materials to perfect and complete the work of his illustrious predecessor, republished them with an Introduction (pp. i\u2013xxiv), an English verse rendering by Mrs. Elizabeth Curtis Brenton (pp. 1\u201315), notes and variants on the text (pp. 19\u201363), and a literal prose translation (pp. 67\u201386). The whole makes a pleasant and readable volume, which will be welcomed by all those who are interested in Persian literature; and if it has the effect of directing greater attention to the poetry of the Persian dialects, a field hitherto but scantily explored, it will render a great service to the cause of Oriental letters.\n\nE. G. B.\n\n**Die Litteraturen des Ostens in Einzeldarstellungen.**\n\nBand vi: Gesch. d. Pers. Litt., von Dr. Paul Horn; Gesch. d. Arab. Litt., von Dr. C. Brockelmann. pp. 228 and 265. (Leipzig, 1901.)\n\nThis volume is the first of the above-mentioned series (which deals also with the East European literatures) treating of the literatures of Asia; and since it comprises in one compact and readable book accounts of two of the most important and interesting branches of Muhammadan letters, each written by a scholar of distinction in a style which happily combines the scientific and the popular, it should meet with a warm welcome from all Orientalists.\n\n\u00b9 Edward Fitzgerald's *Rub\u00e1'iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m*, with their original Persian sources, collated from his own MSS. and literally translated, by Edward Heron-Allen (London: Quaritch, 1899). The author's conclusions are summarized on pp. xi\u2013xii of the Preface.\nThe first half of the volume (which is entirely independent of the second, both as regards pagination, subject-matter, preface, and index, though one cover contains the two parts) deals with Persian literature from the Avestic period till the present day. The first chapter (pp. 1\u201333) deals with the Avesta; the second (pp. 34\u201344) with the Old Persian (Achaemenian) and Pahlawi remains; the third (pp. 45\u201381) with the beginnings of Modern Persian literature down to the time of Firdawsi; the fourth (pp. 81\u2013114) with Firdawsi and his predecessor Daqiqi, together with some of his successors; the fifth (pp. 114\u2013145) with Hafiz, Jami, and the lyric poets, including the moderns Qa\u2019ani and Shaybani, who died only eleven or twelve years ago, and some of the older satirists, quatrain-writers, etc.; the sixth (pp. 145\u2013176) with the mystics, moralists, and didactic poets; the seventh (pp. 177\u2013193) with the romanticists, notably Nizami and Jami; the eighth (pp. 194\u2013201) with the panegyrists and court poets; the ninth (pp. 201\u2013212) with the Drama, that is to say the ta\u2019ziyas, or Muharram Passion-Plays, and the quite modern comedies of Mirza Ja\u2019far Qaraaja-daghhi; and the tenth (pp. 212\u2013222) with Persian prose down to modern times. It will be observed from this epitome of the contents that Dr. Horn has arranged his materials according to style and treatment rather than chronologically, but the materials have been handled in a manner which leaves nothing to be desired in a work like this, which is primarily intended for the general reader rather than the professed Orientalist, while Dr. Horn\u2019s high reputation as a Persian scholar, and the eminent services which he has rendered to the study of Persian philology and literature, are a sufficient guarantee of the excellence and accuracy of the work. The only criticisms which could be made on it are that Persian prose hardly receives the attention that it deserves; that the diaries of the late Shah can hardly be taken as representative of all the best modern prose writing; that the early Samanid poets (of whom our very slight knowledge rests ultimately almost entirely on \u2018Awfi\u2019s Lubabu\u2019l-Albab) receive a disproportionately large share of attention; and that hardly any\nmention is made of the important and extensive literature which, though written in Arabic, was produced by Persians, and which, therefore, if we understand the term \"Literary History\" in a wide sense, believing that the special characteristics of a people are displayed not merely in their language but in their thought, ought to be considered to some extent even in a History of Persian Literature. Yet these criticisms apply to all existing works of the same character, and the force of the last is to a large extent removed by the fact that to Arabic literature in its wider sense, as including all that has been written from the earliest times to our own day in the Arabic language, the second and larger half of this volume is devoted.\n\nIn this second part Dr. Carl Brockelmann, whose more technical, and, alas! still incomplete Arabische Litteraturgeschichte (Weimar, 1897-) has been so precious an aid to all students of Mu\u1e25ammadan literature, follows in general arrangement the lines laid down in that earlier and more elaborate work. The material is divided as follows into eight books, each of which is subdivided into numerous chapters. The first book deals with the pre-Islamic literature, which is, as is well known, almost entirely poetical; the second with the literature of the Arabs during the time of the Prophet and his immediate successors; the third with the same in the Umayyad period. With the triumph of the \u2018Abb\u00e1sids and the consequent rise to power of non-Arabs, especially Persians, the literature produced in the Arabic language is no longer wholly or even chiefly Arabian, and hence it is no longer spoken of as \"die arabische Nationallitteratur,\" but as \"Isl\u00e1mic literature in the Arabic language.\" This literature forms the subject of Books iv\u2013viii, of which the fourth book deals with what may be called the \"Golden Age\" of the \u2018Abb\u00e1sid Caliphate (A.D. 750\u20131000); the fifth with the period of \u2018Abb\u00e1sid decadence down to the Mongol invasion, fall of Baghdad, and destruction of the Caliphate (A.D. 1000\u20131258); the sixth with the period intervening between the events last mentioned and the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Sultan\nSelim (A.D. 1258\u20131517); the seventh with the succeeding period down to Napoleon's invasion of Egypt (A.D. 1517\u20131798); and the eighth and last with the succeeding century, which brings us down almost to the present day.\n\nWithin the limits here imposed it is impossible to bestow on this interesting and valuable manual the fuller and more detailed notice which it so well merits, but it will certainly be read with equal pleasure and profit by all students of Isl\u00e1m, and by that wider circle of readers who desire to acquaint themselves with \"the best that has been said and thought in the world.\"\n\nE. G. B.\n\nThe Majjhima-Nik\u0101ya. Vol. ii (1898). Vol. iii, Part i (1899); Part ii (1900); Part iii (conclusion, 1902).\nEdited for the Pali Text Society by Robert Chalmers, C.B. With Indices to the three volumes by Mabel Bode, Ph.D.\n\nDie Reden Gotamo Buddho's aus der mittleren Sammlung (Majjhimanik\u0101yo) des P\u0101li-Kanons. Zum ersten Mal \u00fcbersetzt von Karl Eugen Neumann. IIter Band.\n(Leipzig: Wilhelm Friedrich, 1900.)\n\nThis year the Pali Text Society fitly celebrates its coming of age by completing its publication of this wonderful old book. It wants but the appearance of a few volumes for the whole of the Sutta Pitaka to be fully presented in scholarly collation and in Roman type. This is now the twelfth year since the Pali Text Society brought out the late V. Trenckner's great editio princeps of the first half of the Majjhima, and the fifth year since the editor of the remaining seventy-six Suttas began to fill up his intervals of strenuous leisure from professional work with the disinterested labour of finishing Trenckner's task. The debt that scholars of Pali and of Buddhism owe to Mr. Chalmers's conscientious workmanship, so unfalteringly carried through, cannot easily be estimated, the more so in that he is adding to their indebtedness by\npreparing an edition of Buddhaghosa's Commentary, the Papa\u00f1ca S\u016bdan\u012b, the greater part of which is so far transcribed that I have been able, with the editor's generous permission, to have access to a great part of it.\n\nThat in a lengthy foreign text the typographical errors should be so few and unimportant is a noteworthy feature. Such slips as bh\u016btam tuccham for taeccham (as opposed to rittam tuccham in the preceding line) in ii, 171, and sa\u00f1\u00f1am for su\u00f1\u00f1am in ii, 263, the reader need not stumble over. Katham, however, in ii, 35, l. 18, has been misinterpreted. But among the MSS. themselves there is now and then a partial consensus of apparent error, as, for instance, in iii, 245, where the Siamese version as well as Buddhaghosa write abhinandit\u0101ni, when we should look for the anabhinandit\u0101ni of the Copenhagen and Kandy MSS.\n\nThe editor, finally, seems to have hit the golden mean in the extent to which he has paragraphed and punctuated the text, aiding without worrying the student\u2014ett\u0101vat\u0101 pi kho \u0101vuso bhikkhuno bahu katam hoti!\n\nMrs. Bode's indices to the Majjhima will be hailed with grateful appreciation as an attempt to meet a great want. The time required hitherto for searching its pages for any one of the countless points of antiquarian or doctrinal interest scattered broadcast has ill-fitted into the normal span of life. It is only to be regretted that when so beneficent an aid was compiled, its range should not have been stretched yet a little further. I do not mean to say that a concordance of the Majjhima was feasible, but I do think that, had one more sheet of space been conceded to her disinterested labours, the help to a student would have been doubled. The indices of proper names and of similes would then have been really as exhaustive as they are intended to be. And that of subjects might have been made to exhaust the occurrences of the terms selected, instead of sampling the passages as has usually been the case. All rare words too, or, let us say, all that are not in Childers's Dictionary, might then have been included. For instance, names of rivers, mountains, and places of resort (at S\u0101vatthi, etc.) would have been useful to\nsome readers. Had more space been available the similes would have included the beautiful and prominent parable of the creeper (m\u0101luva, i, 306); that of the lamp (i, 295); of the dart (i, 429); that of the two chief apostles as parent and educator (janetti, ap\u0101det\u0101), recalling so forcibly the Christian parallel\u2014I (Paul) have planted, Apollos watered\u2014and the Christian divergence which completes it; that of Gotama of himself as Way-guide (maggakh\u0101y\u012b); those included in the striking allegory of the Vammika-sutta, and about twenty others. Finally, we should have had such important references (doctrinally considered) as ii, 33, 36 under atta, iii, 42, 220 under atammayat\u0101, i, 147\u2013150 under n\u0101\u1e47am (*dassanan\u012b), i, 167 (let alone several others) under yogakkhemo, i, 480 under saccam. Unusual words like attak\u0101mar\u016bpo (i, 205; iii, 155), (an)\u0101layo (i, 49, 191; iii, 251), apahatt\u0101 (i, 447), bh\u016bnahu (i, 502), amatag\u0101ma (i, 510), allamattik\u0101pu\u00f1jo (iii, 94), amosadhammo (iii, 245), abb\u016b\u1e37har\u0101 (i, 414, 450), tammayo (i, 319), ketubhi (iii, 6), passivedan\u0101 (iii, 26), and many others would have found mention. And there would have been space for the insertion of terms of philosophical importance, or curious application, such as parinibb\u0101yati of a well-trained horse (i, 446), puttamata (i, 524), aniccan, anattan, asmim\u0101no, upadh\u012b, n\u0101nattan, ripassan\u0101, samatho, sambodhi, etc., etc. It will be thought perhaps captious to regret that the thoroughness observed in indexing the term Tath\u0101gato has not been the rule throughout, but when one thinks of the splendid accessories to study enjoyed by students of the classics, of theology, and even of Sanskrit, one is apt to forget the gratitude due to ungrateful toil of this sort, and, with unreasonable impatience, to envy a younger generation who will find a concordance of at least the Five Nik\u0101yas ready to hand.\n\nTurning to the subject-matter of these seventy-six suttas, it may straightway be said that they contain no missing pillars of the essential structure of Buddhist doctrine. That\n\n---\n\n1 Mallik\u0101 (dev\u012b), Subh\u016bti and a few other personal names are omitted. Bako (br\u0101hma\u1e47o) should be (Brahm\u012b).\ndoctrine had, from the time of its first promulgation till the compilation of the Nik\u0101yas, been so well elaborated, as far as it went, that almost any sample reveals the whole. Hercules stands revealed in the foot. They cannot, even as restatements and variants of this or that tenet, touch those of the first volume in breadth, grasp, and eloquence. There are indeed not wanting, in some of them, hints that seem to betray other compiling hands, later, less original. Out of the 15 vaggas of 10 suttas each, the 14th (Vibhanga-Vagga) includes two extra, that is, 12 suttas. Now the first 10 of these 12 suttas have a different form from the rest of the Majjhima. The subject is first presented as a brief 'argument' or statement (uddesa)\\(^1\\)\u2014a term quite familiar to Buddhaghosa, who applies it to the treatment in the Dhammasanga\u1e47i. The exegesis (or vibhanga) then follows, supplied in four of the ten discourses by leading theras\u2014a procedure which Gotama may conceivably have adopted as he grew old, to spare himself and to regulate the preaching of his future representatives. But of the two extra suttas (141\u20132), one\u2014the Sacca-vibhanga\u2014whereas in form it loosely resembles the other ten, is unique, if I mistake not, in taking as its text, so to speak, the fact that the Tath\u0101gata had delivered his famous first sermon at Isipatana on the Four Truths. And the exposition contains the greater part of the concluding portion of the Mah\u0101-sati-pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na-suttanta of the D\u012bghanik\u0101ya, which is omitted in the Sati-pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na-sutta of the Majjhima. The other\u2014the Dakkhin\u0101-vibhanga-sutta, with the episode of \u0100nanda for a second time pleading the cause of Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b-Gotam\u012b, the aunt and foster-mother of the Buddha\u2014seems to belong, in its subject-matter, to the Vinaya.\n\nBut apart from these probably interpolated suttas, there are several lines of thought as well as terms which seem to break out in the last third of the Majjhima, but do not, so far as I can yet ascertain, form integral threads in the\n\n\\(^1\\) The two Kamma-vibhanga suttas (135\u20136) are only formally exceptions to this method.\nA new life was assigned to it, in\nwhich the Buddha visited stations\nin India. A certain house matched\nthe description of the Buddha, and\nit was decided that the Buddha was not even\nthere. The Buddha visited the residences of out-\nstanding people, but he disappeared al-\nmost immediately. It was concluded as mere\nspeculation that the Buddha was repre-\nsented by a person who had died. Further speculations\nwere made about the Buddha's death and likely to\nhave been caused by a more positive\npersonality. The Buddha died and\nwas buried at his founder.\nThe Buddha's death is the\nevent that is most often put into\nthe Mahavamsa (115th\nchapter) and is visible in the B\u0101la-\nkanda (138). Gotama\nBuddha died and his bhikkhus\nwere instructed after death with\ninstructions to bury him or a village\nin which he was represented as\nliving on specific\nsubsequent to Gotama's death, but, of course, this does not prove them later than the rest as compilations. The discussion by Gotama (128th Sutta) of the difficulties encountered by Anuruddha and his two brethren in the practice of Jh\u0101na is interesting rather as the earliest (if partial) account of the process, than as suggesting later work. So, too, the windy speculations of Anuruddha himself, in the preceding sutta, discoursing in his turn, are interesting rather as contrasting with the usually more solid teaching of his Master than as indicating decadent interpolation. Once more, in the Anupada-sutta (111), the analysis of consciousness into different dhamma or 'states of mind' as it enters on successive stages of rapt meditation and abstraction is interesting rather as the prototype of the method followed in the first Kanda\u1e47i of the Dhamma-sanga\u1e47i than as betraying approximation in date to the latter work.\n\nSpace does not allow me to dwell on the ways in which these suttas help to body out the leading characters and doctrines of early Buddhism, as well as introduce fresh personages. A few words on each must suffice. Of the great central figure, the slight biographical touches vouchsafed show him as aged. King Pasenadi, in his glowing tribute of homage, recounted in the Dhamma-cetiya-sutta (89), speaks of both Gotama and himself as octogenarians.\u00b9 Subha the Brahmin is a m\u0101\u1e47ava when first meeting the Buddha (99), and still a m\u0101\u1e47ava after the teacher's death (D\u012bgha, i, 204). Paternal solicitude seems to break through the Buddha's passionless detachment in the C\u016b\u1e37a-r\u0101hulov\u0101da-sutta (147), when, having watched his only son's dawning arahatship, he fires him to supreme attainment with a final ray of inspiration. We see him, too, preparing the way for S\u0101riputta by extolling in detail his great qualities (111, 141), and, watchful at the same time over the spiritual and moral purity of the thera himself, urging on him daily self-examination\u2014paccavekkhitv\u0101 paccavekkhiteva (iii, 297; cf. i, 415). And we note, in the penultimate Vagga (140th Sutta), that so well known were the characteristic features of his\n\n\u00b9 So Gotama of himself, i, 82.\nteaching that a young man of good birth, whom the Dhamma had converted at second-hand, recognized the Master by his discourse when they two met casually to pass the night under the same roof. Turning back to the 86th Sutta, however, which gives us the authorized version of the account of Gotama\u2019s bearding the desperate bandit Angulim\u0101la and converting him, we have an event attributed elsewhere to the fifty-sixth year of the Buddha\u2019s life.\n\nIt may also be seen, as the Majjhima draws to a close, that the proportion of the discourses said to have been uttered at S\u0101vatthi and the Kosalan country generally is even greater than that which obtains for the whole collection, viz. $\\frac{3}{4}$ in vol. iii as against $\\frac{1}{5}$. Judging by the Majjhima, the Jetavana of S\u0101vatthi had become the focus of the new Buddhist school. Here it is that we meet again with young Subha of Tudi, with J\u0101nusso\u1e47i and his gorgeous white equipage, professing fresh but apparently unfruitful adherence to the Tath\u0101gata after each interview, as well as with other brahmins foregathering from other districts, such as Esuk\u0101ri, and those who give the learned youth Assal\u0101yana no peace till he consents to try a \u2018throw\u2019 of dialectic with the famous Kshatriyan teacher. Elsewhere in Kosala we meet again with the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas, including Sang\u0101rava, with V\u0101set\u1e6dha, as well as with the distinguished Cank\u012b, Pasenadi\u2019s chaplain, who is said by Buddhaghosa to have convened a congress of brahmins every six months at Ukkattha to keep pure their genealogical records (j\u0101ti), and every six months at Icch\u0101nankala to revise the orally registered mantras.\n\nR\u0101jagaha of Magadha appears as a sub-headquarters of the Buddhist Order. The only new brahmin personage of that town to which this half of the Majjhima introduces us\u2014Dh\u0101nanj\u0101ni, the ranchman\u2014goes to justify the low esteem in which Magadhese brahmins were held, for he has the reputation of being a double swindler in his official\n\n---\n\n1 See Weber, *Lit. Gesch.*, 2nd ed., pp. 83, 123, 156; and Oldenberg, \u201cBuddha,\u201d 1st ed., p. 400.\ncapacity as tithe-collector, fleecing his fellow-brahmin grain-growers, and stinting the court on the plea that the crops were scanty. So at least the Commentator explains. Of itinerant clerics\u2014paribb\u0101jakas\u2014who flocked to both places we meet for the second time with leaders like Sakulud\u0101yi (77, 79; cf. A. iv, 30, 185), and for the first time with the personality of Sumana, nicknamed Ugg\u0101ham\u0101na, son of Man\u1e0dik\u0101 the saman\u0101, who is quoted in Sum. i, 32, and with that of Vekhanassa, the institutes of whose Order are referred to in Manu vi, 21 (see B\u00fchler's Introd., S.B.E., xxv, p. xxvii). An interesting feature in the otherwise insignificant grouping effected by the Vaggas is that, in the 8th and 10th, dealing respectively with instances of questions put by paribb\u0101jakas and brahmins, we can contrast the ideas habitual to either section of Indian society. The brahmins are interested in correct externals and birth-privileges; gentlemanly in deportment and without originality, they are living intellectually on the social capital of their traditions pitakasampad\u0101ya (ii, 169). The paribb\u0101jakas, freed from trammels of property and caste, but without the substitution of any sounder intellectual discipline, let their imagination spread, etiolated and distorted, among mythical speculations.\n\nAmong the Sangha itself it is interesting to meet here with another early account of that cheerful missionary Pu\u1e47\u1e47a (P\u016br\u1e47a) of the \u0106r\u014d\u1e47apar\u0101ntakas (Burnouf, Lotus, i, 250 foll.; Diev. 38 foll.; cf. S. iv, 61). And we get a pleasing record of a college lecture catechetically delivered to women students in the Royal Park at S\u0101vatthi, a daily institution which a certain thera, Nandaka, whose turn it was to teach, wished to shirk, but was not suffered to by the Master. The lecture (146th Sutta) is on the central tenets of the faith, and the answers of the students do credit to their teaching. But the curt dismissal by the reproved teacher and the approving Master\u2014\"Go, sisters; time is up!\"\u2014is suggestive.\n\nOne more scene I must touch on is the deathbed of the Order's great patron, An\u0101thapindika (143). Visited by Ananda and S\u0101riputta, he is honoured by an examination\ninto the detachment of the mind from all worldly grasping such as it was customary in mild men with dying religieux.\n\nIn the actual doctrines of Buddhist philosophy\u2014and for present purposes I would formulate them as follows:\n\n1. Emphasis on the means to avoid Ill; (2) rejection of the logical possibility of postulating a super-phenomenal ego\u2014a view incompatible with the universality of Ill;\n\n2. Belief in the possibility of realizing that the character that Ill loses all power over it\u2014on these doctrines the present writer has found most useful for comparative purposes, for instance, in its more positive form, by focusing on the way to attain to\n\n3.

He merely demonstrates that, whatever be the solution, a permanent subject of mental phenomena could not logically be predicated of man as we here and now know him. This difficulty of reconciling a belief in moral retribution with actions as anattakat\u0101ni may have driven many followers to his chief aversion\u2014that 'net for fish'\u2014the anti-causationist Makkhali Gos\u0101la (A. i, 33, 286), who possibly was also a disbeliever in soul. And it is not surprising that Gotama drew all earnest adherents away from considerations of 'my' actions, 'my' attainments, 'my' personal fate, to the cultivation of a purely objectified moral consciousness.\n\nThis brings me to a final word respecting point 4. Whether or not it may be held to betray later compilation, nothing in these volumes, especially in the last, is so thrown into relief as the importance in Buddhist ethics of cultivating psychological analysis\u2014an examination, that is to say, into the nature of sense-consciousness. To become morally strong, the student was not, as some taught (152nd Sutta) to ignore sense-experience, but to break it up into its constituent processes and resultants, so as to divert those complex impacts of the external world from kindling delusion and passion, and convert them into the cool judgments of intellect. Of the last thirty-four Suttas no less than fifteen are concerned with this question. The 111th also, the Anupada-Sutta, in paying tribute to S\u0101riputta's proficiency in introspection, shows that the factors of the states of consciousness in the Dhamma-sanga\u1e47i are to be understood as so many consecutive moments of consciousness. And the discourse which betrayed Gotama to the disciple who knew him not was not an exposition of the central Truth-tenets, but mainly an analysis of sense-experience!\n\nMeanwhile Dr. Neumann has published the second third of his translation of the Majjhima, and given fresh proof of his rare powers of style and wealth of diction. A foreigner must speak with diffidence on such a matter, remembering\nthe enhancement of ideas,\u2014to quote George Eliot\u2014the glamour of unfamiliarity conferring dignity on subjects presented in another language. But the vivid colour and graphic force of the translation, combined with a sufficient but not excessive dash of archaism, can hardly fail to impress strongly any reader. If the literary standard is maintained to the end, the work should rank, as to style, with the great translations of world-literature.\n\nDr. Neumann, on the other hand, for the setting out of what he conceives to be some point in the original, seems at times, I venture to think, to flit too lightly among terms. To quote one instance out of many, to render uss\u0101ho by 'gelten lassen' and chando by 'billigen' is an uncalled-for laxity. The Commentator (if one may mention him!) seems at all events to hold that the normal meanings of r\u0101yamati and kattukamyat\u0101 are good enough (ii, 174). Then, again, as to paripu\u1e47\u1e47a-sankapp\u0101. In vol. i (p. 304) of his translation this was rendered 'wird voller Willensregungen.' Surely the point is just the opposite\u2014the student in question becomes irrationally content, ceases to aspire higher. In the 146th Sutta it is clear that the women-students have successfully graduated, or 'fulfilled their intention.' And I shall be curious to see, in his last volume, whether the phrase attak\u0101mar\u016bp\u0101 viharanti in Sutta 128 will be again rendered (as in Sutta 31) 'selbstzufrieden scheinen'\u2014seem self-contented. Is it not more probable (I speak without access to this part of the Commentary) that the theras are supposed to be engaged in pantheistic meditation, and that the meaning is 'seem to be aspiring or longing after the \u0100tman'? Cf. the expressions in Brih. Up., 4. 3. 21, and 4. 4. 6.\n\nReturning to the volume under consideration, I do not hold that pacchim\u0101 janat\u0101 means 'posterity' in Sutta 83 any more than in Sutta 4. Gotama is mindful of the effect of his actions on the weaker among his disciples\u2014pacchime mama s\u0101vake,\u00b9 or istis fratribus meis minimis, as Christ would have said. Again, when, in Sutta 100, the brahmin youth\n\n\u00b9 Com. on A. i, p. 61.\nasks the question, rather flippantly, if there are gods, the *th\u0101naso* of Gotama's very qualified and guarded remarks is not, I think, properly rendered by *deutlich*, 'clearly.' If the use of the word in M. i, 395, with that in A. iii, 238, be compared, it will appear that the sense is probably 'speaking off-hand.' The question is put hastily with levity, and Gotama does not condescend to discuss it.\n\nC. A. F. Rhys Davids.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(January, February, March, 1902.)\n\nI.

Died December 5, 1901.\n\nAmongst the many sad losses of a year conspicuously associated with public and private mourning, one of the most irreparable, not only to our Society but to Oriental learning, is that of Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, one of the finest Turkish scholars whom Europe has ever produced, who died after a short illness of about three weeks at his London house, 15, Chepstow Villas, Bayswater, on Thursday, December 5, 1901.\n\nMr. Gibb was born at Glasgow on June 3, 1857, and was educated in the same city, first at Park School under Dr. Collier, the author of the History of England, and afterwards at Glasgow University. His taste and aptitude for linguistic studies manifested themselves at an early age, and it was perhaps the charming stories of the Thousand and One Nights which first inspired him with that deep love for, and interest in, the East which characterized the whole of his mature life. I first heard of his proficiency in Turkish about 1878 (some five years before I made his personal acquaintance) from the late Sir James Redhouse, to whom I had written for advice as to my own studies; and a year later (in 1879) his first published work, an English translation of the account given by Sa'du'd-D\u00edn of the Capture of Constantinople in the great history entitled\nT\u00e1ju't-Taw\u00e1rikh, appeared. This was followed in 1882 by his Ottoman Poems, wherein he first fixed and applied those principles of rendering Oriental into English verse on which his later and maturer work was based. An admirable enunciation of these principles will be found at pp. ix\u2013x of the Preface to the first (at present the only published) volume of his great History of Ottoman Poetry (Luzac, 1900). Briefly stated, his opinion was that to make an adequate translation of an Oriental poem it was not sufficient to give a bald prose rendering, no matter how correct, nor even to construct an English metrical paraphrase; but that, in the words of the late Mr. J. A. Symonds, \"a good translation should resemble a plaster-cast, the English being plaqu\u00e9 upon the original, so as to reproduce its exact form.\" To this principle, as applied by Mr. John Payne to the translation of Oriental verse into English, Mr. Gibb gave his full allegiance; and though there is much room for discussion and difference of opinion on the general question (for even the poets of Asia, when rendering Arabic verses into Persian, or vice versa, have not felt bound to preserve the metre or verse-form of the original, though the same system of prosody holds good for both languages, while it is foreign to the genius of European verse), it is probable that few have succeeded so well as he did in faithfully rendering into a European language both the meaning and the form of Oriental poetry.\n\nIt was in the Summer of 1883, a year after I had visited Constantinople for the first time, that I first made the personal acquaintance of Mr. Gibb. Both of us were working at that period at Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, and both of us held strongly that the best and fullest knowledge of the East must be sought from the people of the East. We therefore arranged to spend some six weeks together in London, working at the subjects of our common interest, and cultivating the society of some of those well-read and intelligent natives of Western Asia who are at all times to be found in the Metropolis, though their number at that time happened to be unusually large. Notable amongst\nthem was that wonderful old man, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad B\u00e1qir of Baw\u00e1n\u00e1t in F\u00e1rs, of whom I have given a slight sketch in the Introductory Chapter of my *Year amongst the Persians*. From this period, to which I look back as one of the happiest and most interesting in my life, dates my friendship with that most illustrious yet most modest scholar of whose fruitful life and premature death it is my sad duty to write the record.\n\nIn 1884 Mr. Gibb published a translation of the Turkish *Story of Jev\u0101d*, and in 1886 a translation of the *Forty Vezirs*. A year later he printed for private circulation a small edition (50 copies) of the twelfth-century French romance of *Aucassin and Nicholete*, accompanied by a tasteful and scholarly English rendering, and at later dates he contributed to the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica* the article on *Turkish Literature*, and two of the most important chapters in the *History of Turkey* published in the \"Stories of the Nations\" series. To his crowning work, the *History of Ottoman Poetry*, of which the first out of the projected five volumes was published in 1900 by Messrs. Luzac, I have already alluded. It was the earnest desire of his widow and his parents that the publication of this great work, the mature product of his rare learning and most diligent labour, should, if possible, be continued, and to me they have entrusted the honourable but difficult task of seeing through the press the four remaining volumes. In the *Athen\u00e6um* of January 13 of this current year I have described with sufficient fulness the state in which the manuscript was left, and that description I will not here repeat. Suffice it to say that it was nearly complete, only a few chapters in the last volume (e.g. that dealing with the work and influence of Kem\u00e1l Bey, one of the founders of the Modern School of Ottoman literature) being unwritten; and that the orderly and methodical arrangement of the materials has enormously facilitated a task which, difficult as it is, would otherwise have proved almost impossible. I may add that the second volume, which was practically ready for press, has now undergone final revision, and been\nplaced in the hands of the careful and skilful printers Messrs. E. J. Brill, of Leyden; that some 80 pages are already in type, and that the volume will, I trust, be published in the course of this year, and will be followed as quickly as possible by the remaining volumes.\n\nBy his will Mr. Gibb has left to the British Museum his very valuable collection of Turkish and other Oriental manuscripts, which comprises some 324 volumes, and contains many extremely rare and several unique works. Of this collection a summary account is given in the number of the *Athen\u00e6um* to which I have already referred, and, should circumstances permit, I hope perhaps to describe them more fully in another number of the *Journal*. The destination of the printed Oriental books, which are also of great value, is not yet determined; but, since the chief desire of Mr. Gibb's widow and parents is that his name may be perpetuated and his work continued, it is probable that they also will be generously bestowed where they are likely to be of the greatest use to those who shall hereafter follow in the steps of him who gathered them together with such taste, judgment, and trouble.\n\nDeath is hardest to understand, and sorrow most difficult to bear, when he whom we mourn dies not at a ripe old age, his work accomplished and his labour completed, but is cut off in the very meridian of life, with faculties fully matured and energy still undiminished. We can only repeat the faith so beautifully expressed by Browning in that magnificent poem *A Grammarian's Funeral*:\n\n\"Oh, if we draw a circle premature,\nHeedless of far gain,\nGreedy for quick returns of profit, sure\nBad is our bargain!\nWas it not great? did not he throw on God\n(He loves the burthen)-\nGod's task to make the heavenly period\nPerfect the earthen?\"\n\nE. G. B.\nIII. Notes and News.\n\nLauri\u0101\u2014Nandangarh.\n\nIn my article entitled \"Kusin\u0101r\u0101 or Ku\u015binagara\" (ante, p. 153) I stated that the great st\u016bpa near Lauri\u0101 in the Camp\u0101ran or Motih\u0101ri district is called Nandangarh, not Navandgarh, as given by Cunningham, and that the name is derived by the villagers from the word nanad, 'husband's sister.' Since the publication of my article I have ascertained from Mr. J. H. Bernard, I.C.S., Magistrate of Camp\u0101ran, that both these statements, which were given on the authority of B\u0101b\u016b P. C. Mukherji, are correct.\n\nAccording to the local legend R\u0101j\u0101 Janak lived at C\u0101nkigarh, eleven miles north of Lauri\u0101 (ante, p. 157). His sister was married in Lauri\u0101, and inasmuch as she was the nanad of the R\u0101j\u0101's consort, the site of her dwelling was called Nandangarh. Philologists may find a difficulty in deriving Nandan from nanad, but popular etymologists are not troubled by philological scruples.\n\nIn my article the word nanad is misprinted nand.\n\nVincent A.

By Oliver Wardrop.\n\nThe Persian poem of Wis and Ram\u00edn, by Fahraldin As\u00e1d Al Astarabadi Al Fakhri Al Gurgani, was published at Calcutta in 1864\u201365 by Captain W. Nassau Lees, LL.D.; an exhaustive account of it, by K. H. Graf, will be found on pp. 375\u2013433 of vol. xxiii of Zeitschrift d. Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, Leipzig, 1869.\n\nIn 1884, \"Visramiani,\" in the Georgian language, edited by Prince Ilia Chavchavadze, Al. Sarajishvili, and P. Umicashvili, was printed at Tiflis (pp. xii and 477, 8vo). The edition is a model of careful editing. Extracts of the work had already been printed by D. Chubinov in his Chrestomathy, with occasional variants of trifling importance. No other printed versions exist in Georgian. All the MSS. extant were used for the 1884 edition; none of them is older than the seventeenth century; doubtless a very large number of MSS. were destroyed by the clergy, especially in the eighteenth century, when the Catholicos Antoni burned nearly all the secular literature which failed to satisfy his taste.\n\n\"Visramiani\" is attributed to Sargis Thmogveli, who flourished in the reign of Queen Thamara. This would\nmake the date about 1200, or a few years earlier. Rust'ha-\nveli, in the \"Man in the Panther's Skin,\" refers to the story\nof Vis and Ramin in the following lines:\n\n182. \"Such grief neither Ramin nor Vis saw.\"\n1071. \"P'hatman was dying for lack of him, like Ramin\nwithout Vis.\"\n\nEven if Sargis be not the author of the Georgian version,\nthe style, vocabulary, and grammatical forms are not later\nthan those of the period of T'hamara. The book reads like\nan original work, and purely Georgian expressions and\nallusions are freely used; there are even occasional references\nto the Christian religion\u2014\n\n\"The king himself was a fire-worshipper, and all his\nkingdom. This king was before the coming of\nChrist\" (ch. ii).\n\n\"When the priest plays a two-stringed instrument what\ncan the deacon do but dance?\" (ch. xxiii).\n\nThe story begins in the following manner:\n\nCh. I. The Beginning of the Story of Vis and Ramin.\n\nIn the land of Khvarasan and Adrabadagan there was\na great and mighty Sultan, Tughlurbeg, lord of many hosts,\npowerful, glorious, sovereign of all Persia. Only the city of\nAspaan was lacking to his kingdom.\n\nAll his nobles and great men assembled and said: \"Inas-\nmuch as you, mighty and greatly renowned Sultan, possess\nyour throne and kingdom in power and glory, and this is\nHis will and choice that all Islam should be obedient to\nyour command and should swear by your sun, now we\ncounsel your Majesty to do this: to assemble your armies\nand march against the city of Aspaan. Whoever is not\nobedient to your sway, and does not seek peace, shall he\nnot be straightway subdued? and henceforth if any dare\nto disregard your commands, let your unrelenting wrath fall upon him, and so let your will and desire be accomplished.\"\n\nThe king hearkened to them, he summoned his three kingdoms. Then he divided his armies, and sent one to Kirman, one to Musul, one to Havaz; some he sent to the provinces of Somkhiti (i.e. Armenia), some to Greece. And all, from everywhere, returned victorious and triumphant.\n\nThen came an ambassador from Arslan-Khan in order to arrange a matrimonial alliance, and he brought countless gifts. At the same time there came an ambassador from the King of the Greeks, and presented gifts of beautiful raiment, and among those gifts was a jewel, a red jacinth, weighing six and twenty drams. At Aspaan he donned the raiment sent by the King of the Greeks, and all Moslems did him homage, both foreign monarchs and his own nobles; and he was extolled by all, because of the honours, gifts, and embassies he had from all monarchs.\n\nAnd this Sultan had such servants and slaves that on the face of the whole earth there were none like unto them. Among them was a renowned, generous, wise-minded man, complete in manhood, fearless, prudent, cheerful, faultless in speech, brave and a seeker after wisdom, perfect in all virtues, handsome; he knew well the art of healing; a lover of all men, a man of God, and he was lord of a great land. Besides all these virtues, he was a seeker after strange stories and poetry.\n\nWhen the Sultan had taken the city of Aspaan he left his army and departed, leaving Ibdal-Melik vizier in Aspaan. While (Ibdal) was on a journey he saw a man of Jorjan, and the man pleased him, and began to tell stories of what he had seen. At night he was by his side, and in drinking Ibdal enquired: \"Dost thou not know that there is a story of Vis and Ramin? I greatly wish to hear their story, and for a long time I have sought it: I have heard of their virtues.\"\n\nP'hakhp'hur replied: \"I know it all, and I have heard of their virtues and their royal character, for it is a good, pleasant story, told by wise men, and composed in the\nP'halauri (i.e. Pehlevi) tongue; but since nobody knows P'halauri very well, no one can translate it. Now, if thou commandest me, I will try to translate their story into Persian.\"\n\nIbdal-Melik-Abunasar thanked him for this, and gave him hope of reward. Then P'hakhp'hur spoke thus: \"Since it is so, and their story is naturally liked, and it is desired that I should tell it, I will narrate\\(^1\\) it and translate it. Since their name is great in the land, my name too will by this means remain in the land.\"\n\nAccepting this as it stands, it would seem as if the Georgian translator had used a modern Persian text made from a Pehlevi original in the reign of Tughlurbeg, between 1042 and 1055 A.D. But the text of the passage is very corrupt, and there is ground for suspicion that it may have been prefixed to the story by a scribe of much later date.\n\nIn writing this paper my object is to appeal to students for information as to the probable source of the Georgian version. Several hypotheses may be considered.\n\n1. That it is a translation of the poem of Al Gurgani. Against this are the following serious objections:\n\n   (a) A translation from a poem would certainly have been in poetical form. The Georgian language lends itself to rhythm and rhyme to an extraordinary degree; narrative verse is perhaps easier to write than prose.\n\n   (b) The resemblance between the Georgian prose and the Persian verse is not sufficiently great to justify the supposition; at most it would only give ground for the hypothesis that the two were drawn from the same prose source.\n\n2. That it is merely an adaptation of the Persian poem.\n\n3. That it is a translation or adaptation of a Persian prose translation of the old Pehlevi romance. This is the opinion which, subject to advice from scholars, I am inclined to adopt.\n\n\\(^1\\) Literally, \"in a measured (or metrical) form.\"\n4. That it should be a direct translation from Pehlevi into Georgian seems improbable, even if the first chapter be admitted to be a forgery. Yet something can be said on behalf of this view. There is little doubt that Pehlevi was understood in ancient Georgia, and while the style of the Georgian version seems to point to the fact that it could not have been made later than the T'hamarian age, it is impossible from internal evidence to assert positively that it may not have been of much earlier date.\n\nIn order to supply readers with materials for coming to a decision it seems to me that it will be well to print here passages selected from various parts of a complete English manuscript translation recently made.\n\nCh. II. The Story of Vis and of Ramin and his elder brother Shah Moabad.\n\nThere was once a great and mighty king of Adraban and ruler of all the provinces and countries, lord of great treasures. He held Khorasan, Turkistan, Eraq, Adrabadagan, Koistan, Khurazm; he was lord of lands and seas and famous over all Persia. Many kings he had under him happy and secure, and in those days there was no man disobedient to his word. The king himself was a fire-worshipper, and all his kingdom. This king was before the coming of Christ, and his name was Shah Moabad. He had a brother called Zard, and he was Shah Moabad's vizier.\n\nAs is the custom with the Persians, they made a great assembly and celebrated the New Year (Navroz) with such magnificence that it cannot be conceived by the mind of man. Let us tell somewhat of the pomp of their Bairam-Navroz celebration. On that day came the kings who were his vassals, and the magnates with their wives and children, to rejoice and to do homage: men of Shiraz, Aspaan, Eraq, Jorjan, Gelan, Ardavel, and Bardavel; Shahp'hur of Gelan and Zard himself, brother and vizier of Shah Moabad, and the nobles of the whole land, with their womenfolk, went\nto Shah Moabad to Khuarasan, to the city of Marav (Merv). They came forth, and each ordered his footman to set up tents and apartments in the field. \"Adorn the plains,\" said they. All this grandeur excelled the power of imagination. They came to the plain, they brought wall carpets, the footmen and other servants adorned the orchards and filled them with household goods and treasures. They hurried on the elephants and camels bearing loads of treasures. Whatever was befitting to His Majesty that they sent to him.\n\nHe called the monarchs and the nobles: whoever was worthy to sit down, seated himself, and as for the others who were there, they stood each with his staff in his hand. They invited the queens and the dames to sit down honourably, they led in many kinds of skilful maiden minstrels, on the one hand the lovers of the rose (i.e. nightingales) warbled on the rose, and on the other hand the singers sang their songs. The wives of the monarchs, and the dames, fair as sun and moon, sat down. Two beautiful ruby tints there were among the ladies, one of the face and the other of the wine. They burned aloes, musk, and amber, and the fragrance thereof made as great a smoke as a cloud, and its colour was like the hair of the dames. Their wealth and fortune, treasure and riches, were heavier than a mountain, and the sorrow among them was lighter than chaff. And from all lands folk came to look at the ladies, to gaze at their brides. There were the fairest among the new brides, and in gaining them much blood will be spilt. There was Sharo Mahdukht of Adrabadgan, Manosh of Asp'hurgan, Naslakit'h of Dehistan, Dinirges and Zarniges, maids from the roots of the mountains, Shirin and Gorges of Aspaan, two sunlike beauties, Abanozn, Abanoed, two pretty damsels, daughters of scribes, the wife and Shakarlab the daughter of Iasaman the vizier, and Abanosh of Eraq, the tender Adragun and Gulguno, Shainam and Khaibla of Shiraz, and Shah Moabad's wives; there were Chinese, Turkis, Barbarians, Greeks, noblemen's daughters, and Khuarazmi was the lady\nof these queens. Each was more beautiful than the other. No one can fittingly tell forth their praise, in face and form they were faultless in all points. All were seated before King Moabad.\n\nThe monarch Shah Moabad was a lover of women; he gazed, he rejoiced, he gave gifts, and bade the minstrels sing; some he made to joust in the lists, some to sport with spears, and the lovely damsels to sway to and fro in the round dance.\n\nFor a week they made merry with great rejoicing. He gave away all the jewels, pearls, and treasures which had been used in their drinking and rejoicing at the feast. He satisfied great and small, none there was neglected. Thereupon Shahro, the elder born, with smiling face jested with Shah Moabad. When Shah Moabad heard the words of Shahro he spoke thus:\n\n\"Ah, rose, thou that smiling speakest! May I ever see thee merry! Since in the days of thine old age thou art such a ravisher of hearts, what must thou have been in the time of thy youth! Since thou art thus when thou art a half-faded rose, how could those who erstwhile saw thee live or have reason! Now that my heart is darkened and I am without hope, do not cut me off from thy race; wed me to thy daughter, for the fruit is like the seed, and thy daughter is like thee. My fate and future will then be more blessed when of thy race a sun like thee shall shine in my palace. And if I find a sun on earth I shall not need a sun in heaven.\"\n\nThus in reply spoke Shahro the fair: \"O most sovereign of sovereigns! Nothing better could befall us than to have thee for son-in-law if God had been merciful and had given me a daughter; but, by thy sun, I have no daughter, otherwise I would have told thee. Hitherto no girl child has been born to me, and if now one shall be given to me without fail I shall tell you.\"2\n\n1 Perhaps \"the Khurazmian ladies excelled all the foreigners in beauty.\" The whole passage appears to be very corrupt.\n2 Throughout the work the second person singular and second person plural are used irregularly.\nThen Shah Moabad made her swear: \"Swear unto me that if a daughter be given thee she shall wed none save me.\"\n\nThe wife of Qaran, the mother of Viro, made a solemn vow with an oath: \"If a daughter be given me I shall wed her to thee, and she shall be thy wife.\"\n\nShahro's husband was called Qaran. But Shahro was of nobler birth than Qaran; she was of the race of King Jimshed, who was the fifth king after Adam.\n\nThey mixed musk and rose-water and therewith they wrote down the oath, and they made a contract together: \"If a daughter be given to Shahro, Shah Moabad's wife shall she be.\"\n\nBehold what sorrow they both were to see: He is to wed the unborn, and the mother betroths the unborn.\n\nCh. VIII. Here is the great Battle between Moabad and Viro.\n\nWhen from the east came forth the sun, whose vizier is the moon and whose throne is the morning, both hosts formed early in battle array and both monarchs in pomp came forth before their armies to battle. On both sides began the beating of copper drums, the cry of the trumpets, the voice of the clarion; it was, so to say, the noise of devils, for whoever heard that din everyone at the sound became a foeman to another. It was such a clatter that old corpses which had crumbled to earth would have trembled in the ground for fear of it.\n\nThey hurled themselves one upon another, and the shock was like autumn wind casting down the leaves from the tree. Two armed men by the clash of such an encounter were cut down, and from both sides drum and trumpet shrieked: \"Haste ye, O ye ravishers of life!\" The trumpet evidently knew of their death, it wept for them even beforehand. The sharp swords in the hands of the warriors smiled like lightning on their souls. The heroes in the plain were like lions, and in the mountains like fierce panthers, and even they who were experienced, they in the\nbattle became mad, of a truth they were mad and full of hate, so that they feared neither fire nor water, neither sword, lance, scourge, nor arrow, neither lions nor elephants. In that battle there were heroes such that they sacrificed their sweet souls for glory and did not fear death. They only feared shame and flight. The air was like a forest with the multitude of lances and standards, the earth was like a cedar-grove with the many kinds of flags; on some the lion sits, on some a peacock, on some a vulture, on some an eagle. The earth was suddenly become dust, it rose to heaven and poured down upon the heads of the soldiers. Many youths became like old men and black horses grew grey. Cowards and brave men were recognized by this, that the cowards were melancholy and the brave were gay. The face of the brave was like the flower of a pomegranate, of the cowardly like a scorpion with yellowness.\n\nThe two armies met like two mountains of steel falling together. Between them, like messengers, the arrows of poplar with eagles' plumes came and went steely-faced; such beloved messengers were they that they penetrated even to the heart and to the eyes, no other place would please them, and into whatever abode such a messenger came he carried off with him the master and host. The battle became so keen that they saw eternity clearly. Brother became careless of brother, and in that hour none had helper or succourer save his own right arm. Whoever had a powerful arm used his sword as it seemed good to him. The warriors seemed tongueless amid the wind of battle and the noise of the trumpet. Nothing else was heard. Sometimes a sword clove chain armour like water, into the eyes of some an arrow stole like sleep, into the hearts of some a lance crept like love; halberts penetrated the heads of some\u2014the merry halbert sought to learn from the brain in what part of a man's form God had implanted the soul; the sword entered by one path and the spirit came forth by the same path. The steel swords were like a blue cloud, but it rained, and the shower which came forth from it was red. In the battle the arrow was like a sempstress, for it sewed the bodies to the saddle.\nUntil evening the two armies prolonged the battle. In the melly one was like a leopard and one a wild goat. Qaran, the father of the well-beloved Vis, was slain by his foes, and round about him were slain a hundred and thirty nobles, braves of Viro. There rained, so to say, drops of rain that was death. So many men were slain that heap upon heap of corpses lay piled, and round about them flowed streams of blood.\n\nWhen Viro saw his father Qaran slain, and so many nobles lying devoted beside him, he called to his magnates:\n\n\"Brothers! in a battle sloth is monstrous and a shame to brave men. Are you not ashamed that so many of your race are massacred for the enemy to rejoice over? Have you no shame for the sake of Qaran, whose white beard has been crimsoned by blood? and that such a monarch lies miserably slain? Is there no avenger of blood among so many warriors? The sun of heroism and glory-seeking is set, for no one seeks any longer fame or heroism. I have not yet sought to avenge his blood, and have not rejoiced myself over the enemies. Now night is falling and it will soon be dark. The soldiers retreat. Since morning you have shown great bravery and waged battle, now I will attack, and let your prowess help me and aid me to seek to avenge my father's blood. And be ye all like dragons in the search for blood and in boldness, so that I may not bring shame on my race. Now are the days of death from my sword. Fate and the world I despise. I will be delivered from shame and from the rotten Moabad, and I will rejoice the soul of my father by slaying him.\"\n\nWhen he had spoken thus, he fell upon them together with his nobles, men at arms, and chosen troops; like fire he burned and there was no help for him (or, he was not master of himself). Moabad's soldiers were like a flood rushing down a mountain slope, for they could no longer conceal themselves. Their caress was lance, sword, and arrow. In slaying one another, friend was worse than foe, father became heedless of his son, son of his father, and friend of his friend. Whoever met another spared not to\nslay. It became so dark that nothing could be seen before the eyes. Brother slew brother and father son. The lances were like spits, instead of roast meat there were men, and the earth, from the flow of blood, was like a winepress. Death was, as 'twere, a powerful wind which scattered men's heads like leaves from a tree; the heads of the warriors were like balls in the playing-field (maidan), and their forms like felled trees in a thick wood. When the sun set it seemed as if Moabad's fate set with the sun, and fate had cut off hope of the monarchy of Moabad.\n\nMoabad fled even unto Ispaan and Khuarasan. And when his soldiers saw him flee all fled. The chief of his soldiers were slain, and if darkness had not come on Moabad himself could not have escaped. But Viro and his nobles no longer pursued. They thought since Moabad was fled he would not fight them any more again as long as he lived.\n\nHis idea was one thing and God's decree was otherwise.\n\nWhen Viro saw that Moabad had fled he rejoiced, and lo! he had not alighted from his horse before the Delamis and Gelanis and the Kiamanis (var. Kirmanis, Gelanelis, and Iamanelis), countless as sand, wild goats, rain, and the leaves of trees, fell upon Viro. Viro's soldiers and the outlanders, whoever was foreign, all fled without fighting the Gelanis and the Delamis, because they were marvellously many and their leaders were renowned for valour. When Viro knew of their coming and of the flight of his soldiers he was astonished at the deed of Fate, which is inconstant, its bitterness and joy are a pair, like the brightness of day and the darkness of night. In this fleeting world grief is more than joy, and the heart of the wise and prudent is timid in Fate's hands. When Fate had rejoiced over Moabad, the same Fate frowned on his foes. With a sweaty and dusty face Viro stood, his bloody sword he did not sheath, with a few soldiers he directed himself against the king of the Delamis in battle with naked sword.\n\nWhen Moabad heard this news, how Viro had gone against the Delamis and the Gelanis, at the same moment he turned back, and since he felt no fatigue he went so\nswiftly that the wind could not overtake his dust. He came with his army to Gorab, where was the house and dwelling of Vis.\n\nCH. XXVIII (extract). Moabad lights a fire for Vis to swear by.\n\n. . . . . \"There is nought better than this, that thou shouldst swear to me; it will save from suspicion and reproach, and will bind the tongue of everyone who slanders thee. Now will I light a great fire, I will make smoke of aloes and musk; swear to me by this fire, before all the nobles and soldiers, pass through the midst of it, so that at the moment when thou swearest to me thou mayst become pure in soul from sin. After this, none will dare to reproach thee nor speak an unpleasing word. Then thou shalt be my soul and fate (or world), I shall love thee like my life, I shall give thee my kingdom besides and show forth thy purity.\"\n\nVis replied: \"Do so. Thou shalt purify and I too shall be purified by this. As long as thou suspectest in thy heart that I am not pure, thou harmest thy soul and all religion. It is better to see sin and hide it than not to see it and speak slander.\"\n\nThen Shahinshah called together all the servants of fire, his nobles and armies, and sacrificed on the altar great possessions, so that of each it is impossible to tell the quantity\u2014gold, jewels, pearls, villages. Thence they caused a little fire to be taken, in the moedan (public square) they lighted with it a great mountain of fire, so that its heat reached unto heaven and its flame was like a fair woman in a linen smock walking delicately. The greatness of the fire lighted up the whole land, and it was consumed by the heat, as a lover is consumed by absence, and its smoke darkened the air of heaven. And none knew for what reason Shahinshah had lighted such a fire, and it mounted so high that its flame warmed the moon. There stood\ntogether before the fire the nobles of Khuarasan. Vis saw that fearful fire from Moabad\u2019s tower, and said to Ramin:\n\n\u201cBehold the deed of that man, how he has lighted a great fire for us and wishes to burn us in it! Now, before he burn us, come let us both steal hence. We shall cause Mobad\u2019s heart to burn in this same fire. Moabad said to me yesterday: \u2018Swear that thou hast not had Ramin.\u2019 And I began to discourse and cheated him. Now they have lighted a great fire before the citizens and soldiers, and he will make me walk in this fire, he will bring me to shame before these men, and thus he said to me: \u2018Thou shalt go in naked before these men, that none may slander thee with Ramin.\u2019\n\nCh. XLII (extract). Wedding of Ramin and Gul.\n\nRamin held Gul by the hand. She poured a hundred vessels full of jewels and pearls at Ramin\u2019s feet (var. Ramin poured at (his father-in-law) Rap\u2019hed\u2019s feet), she seated him on a golden throne. Whoever of their kinsfolk were magnates and nobles they called them all and made merry. In confirmation of the deed Ramin swore solemnly by their (? local) oaths, by God and fire, that:\n\n\u201cAs long as the earth endures, and Geon (i.e. Gihon) flows a stream, as long as fish are found in the sea, or the sun and moon have brilliance, as long as night is dark, as long as wind blows on the mountains, and beasts feed in the plains, I living shall seek none save Gul, I shall desire no other wife nor friend, nor shall I mention the sorceress Vis as if I had ever loved her. As long as I live Gul shall be my heart. I have separated myself from other love, and am weary of it. The rose, a rose in name, is mine\u2014my wife\u2014and Gorab is mine abode. As long as I have the rose I shall not smell a violet, as long as there is a moon I shall not esteem the light of the stars.\u201d\n\n1 The Shahinshah\u2019s name is inconsistently spelt\u2014Mobad, Moabad, Movabad, Muvabad, Munabad. Cf. Khvarasan, Adrabagan, etc., in Ch. I.\n\n2 A play upon words\u2014gul means a heart in Georgian, a rose in Persian.\nCh. XLVIII (extract). The First Letter of Vis to Ramin.\n\nA letter was written from the sorrow-stricken Vis to the merry and light-hearted Ramin. Instead of paper was used Chinese vellum (petraconi), for ink T'humbut'hian (Tibetan) musk, an Egyptian reed (calami), rosewater from Nisib, and tubers of Saman aloe (? 'aloe of the plains,' reading sem-awas?), the scribe himself a Kaj-like (i.e. possessed of supernatural cunning) finder of words, his words were mingled with sugar and pearls. . . . .\n\nCh. LXXXIX (last chapter). Ramin's Accession and Death.\n\nWhen they told Ramin of this death (of Moabad) by mischance, and how the dragon had swallowed unexpectedly the sun of the world, he showed much outward grief, he made mourning and lamentation for the dead. But in secret he gave God great thanks that He had done thus, and had not brought about a war in which the blood of the poor would have been shed. Moabad was dead, Ramin's desire was fulfilled. He did homage to God and indited a song of praise. . . . . (Here follows an account of Ramin's reign until the death of Vis.) He summoned his eldest son, Khorshed, the grandees and the troops. And he set Khorshed on the royal throne, placed the crown on his head, girt a sword about his loins, blessed him as king, and called his name Khuasrov. Thus he spoke: \"Eighty and three years have I been a happy monarch. Now have I given thee my property and the throne, for ruling beseems and befits thee too. God make thee happy! Thou art a young man and thy fate is young too. Bring not shame upon Vis, thy mother, nor upon me. Do what thou hast seen me do, that I may not judge thee when God asks me in that other world. Have a care of divine things, be zealous for justice.\" He confided to him his crown, throne, kingdom, troops, and treasures. He came not forth from Vis's sepulchre till the time of his death, nor opened the door, and no man saw him.\nFor lack of space, these extracts must suffice. They will, perhaps, furnish material for some opinion as to the probable date of the Georgian text. As a story, \"Visramiani\" has great merits, and would be read by any cultivated reader with keen interest. Apart from the vivid sketches of ancient life and manners, there is everywhere apparent a strong sense of humour which prevents even the lyrical passages from becoming tedious.\nART. XVIII.\u2014Description of Persia and Mesopotamia in the year 1340 A.D. from the Nuzhat-al-Kul\u016bb of \u1e24amd-Allah Mustawf\u012b, with a summary of the contents of that work. By G. LE STRANGE.\n\n(Continued from p. 266, April Number, 1902.)\n\nChapter 10. Kurdist\u0101n.\n\nContents: Al\u0101n\u012b, 167q; Al\u012bsh\u1e6dar and Bah\u0101r, 167r; Khuftiy\u0101n, 167s; Darband T\u0101j Kh\u0101t\u016bn and Darband Zang\u012b, 167t; Darbil, 167u; Dinav\u0101r, 167v; Sult\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d Jamjam\u0101l, 167w; Shahraz\u016br, 167y; Kirm\u0101nsh\u0101h, 168a; Kirind and Kh\u016bsh\u0101n, 168f; Kanguvar, 168h; M\u0101yidasht, 168k; Harsin, 168l; Vast\u0101m, 168m.\n\nThe description of Kurdist\u0101n given by Mustawf\u012b (which H\u0101jj\u012b Khalfah has copied almost verbatim into his Jih\u0101n Num\u0101) presents a number of small problems which I find myself unable satisfactorily to solve. Kurdist\u0101n, or the Land of the Kurds, is not mentioned by the earlier Arab geographers, and it appears to have been first erected into a separate government under the Salju\u1e33s, who, in the time of Sulaym\u0101n Sh\u0101h, divided it off from the rest of the Jib\u0101l Province, which they called Persian \u2018Ir\u0101\u1e33, as explained in Chapter 2. Sulaym\u0101n Sh\u0101h, under whose rule Kurdist\u0101n appears to have flourished greatly, surnamed Ab\u016bh (or\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nAy\u016bh) was the nephew of Sultan Sinjar, who had appointed him governor of this province, and Sulaym\u0101n Sh\u0101h at a later date\u2014that is, from 554 to 556 (1159 to 1161 A.D.)\u2014became for a short time the Salj\u016bk Sultan of the Two \u2018Ir\u0101ks, and chief of his house.\n\nAl\u0101n\u012b (thus in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 450, though some MSS. read Al\u0101b\u012b) was one of the chief towns of the province of Kurdist\u0101n, but no trace of it is to be discovered on the present maps, it is mentioned apparently by no other geographer, and is not marked in the Itinerary. At Alishtar (the next town named by Mustawfi) there was an ancient Fire-temple called Ardahish (or Arakhash), and Alishtar [1] would appear to have been some town in the well-known plain of this name, still so marked on our maps. This town is possibly that given in Ibn Hawkal (p. 259), and others, as lying ten farsakh\u012bs south-west of Nih\u0101vand, being twelve leagues north of S\u0101b\u016brkhw\u0101st. The older geographers, however, spell the name L\u0101shtar, and the MSS. of the Nuzhat give every variety of reading for this name\u2014such as Alisht, Al-Bashr (so in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 450), Alisbar and Basht\u2014so that the identification given above is more than doubtful; and in regard to the Fire-temple I am at a loss for any further references.\u00b9\n\nThe town of Bah\u0101r [2], with its castle, which \u1e24amd-Allah reports to have been the capital of Kurdist\u0101n in the days of Sulaym\u0101n Sh\u0101h, lies some eight miles to the north of Hamad\u0101n. Khuftiy\u0101n (given as Khuny\u0101n, Hu\u1e35h\u0101n, Ju\u1e2db\u0101n, and Khays\u0101n, with diverse other readings in the MSS., the form \u1e24a\u1e2dshiy\u0101n being printed in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 450) is difficult to identify; it was a fine castle, according to \u1e24amd-Allah, that stood on the bank of the Z\u0101b river (but\n\n\u00b9 On his march from Tustar to Shir\u0101z, Timur, according to \u2018Ali of Yazd (i. 600), after crossing the \u0100b-Shirin, camped on the Plain of L\u0101shtar, and two days later coming to the river of the Sha\u2018b Bavv\u0101n valley, halted at Basht. Both places will be found on the modern map, and naturally suggest themselves as possible alternatives, one or other, for the town of Kurdist\u0101n mentioned by \u1e24amd-Allah; but unfortunately both would appear to be out of the question, and too far south (being well within the boundary of F\u0101rs) ever to have been counted as of Kurdist\u0101n. The Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, as usual, merely copies the Nuzhat without comment.\nwhether Upper or Lower Zab is not stated), being surrounded by many villages.\n\nThe towns of Darband (Pass of) T\u0101j Kh\u0101t\u016bn and Darband Zang\u012b, also, are neither of them marked on the map; Darband T\u0101sh\u012b Kh\u0101t\u016bn, however, is frequently referred to by \u2018Ali of Yazd (i, 585, 599, 640) in his account of the marches of Timur through Kurdist\u0101n. Dirb\u012bl, or Dizb\u012bl, \u2018a medium-sized town,\u2019 likewise is not found either on the map or in the works of the earlier Arab geographers; the spelling, however, is most uncertain, the MSS. giving Dars\u012bl, Wazpal, etc., with some other variants.\n\nDinav\u0101r, the ruins of which have been described by De Morgan (Mission en Perse, ii, 95, 96), was still, when Mustawfi wrote, a fine town, and produced excellent corn crops. The ruins of Jamjam\u0101l [3] are marked on the maps as lying due east of Kirm\u0101nsh\u0101h and south of Bis\u016bt\u016bn [7], this position (for there are other villages of the same name) being confirmed by the distances given in the Itinerary (Route ii); and our author states that this place, called more especially Sult\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d Jamjam\u0101l, was at one time the capital of Kurdist\u0101n, and that it was founded by Sultan Uljayt\u016b the Mongol. The city of Shahraz\u016br [4] is to be identified with the ruins at Y\u0101s\u012bn Tappah, in the present plain of Shahraz\u016br. The town was known to the Persians as Nim-R\u0101h\u2014\u2018Half-way\u2019\u2014that is, lying half-way between the ancient Fire-temple at Mad\u0101in and the Temple on the Adharbayj\u0101n frontier at Sat\u016br\u012bk (already mentioned above in Chapter 2), which Sir H. Rawlinson has identified with Sh\u012bz of the Arab geographers (see J.R.G.S., x, 65).\n\nKirm\u0101nsh\u0101h, which the Arabs called Kirm\u012bs\u012bn, was celebrated for the sculptures in the neighbouring mountain of Bis\u016bt\u016bn. Kirind [5] and K\u016bsh\u0101n were two villages at the head of the Hulw\u0101n pass; the name of K\u016bsh\u0101n has now apparently disappeared from the maps, though Kirind remains; and this latter in the time of Mustawfi was the less important place of the two. Kanguv\u0101r, which the Arabs called Ka\u1e63r-al-Lu\u1e63\u016bs\u2014\u2018Robbers\u2019 Castle\u2019\u2014according to our author had been built with stones taken from the ancient\nname as Khuzistan. M\u0101h\u012bdasht, or Mah\u012bdasht, is still the name of the great plain watered by the Kirind river; and Harsin (q.v.) the name of a castle and town, lies some miles southeast of Khuzistan. Finally, Vast\u0101m [7], or Bast\u0101m, is apparently the name near the present T\u0101k-i-Bust\u0101n, at the foot of the Bust\u0101n hill, for it is described as a large village lying over against the great Achaemenian sculptures, which represent, according to the Persians, King Khusr\u016b Bar\u0101z and his horse Sh\u0101h\u012brak, with Queen Shirin, and these names certainly inscribed in his account of the Bis\u016bt\u016bn monument (L. 395).\n\nChapter II. Khuzistan.\n\nNames: \u1e2a\u016bz: Alwaz, 169e; Tarb, 169e; Junday Sh\u0101h\u0101n: \u1e2a\u016bz: \u1e2auzistan, 169f; Dizful, 169f; Daskarah, \u1e2a\u016bz: \u1e2auzistan, 169g; S\u016bs, 169h; Tar\u0101zak, 169i; \u2018Askar Mukram, \u1e2a\u016bz: \u1e2auzistan, 170a.\n\nNow that we have in this province it will be well to examine the information as is given by Hamd-Allah Mustawfi, who flows out to the Persian Gulf by several streams through the tidal estuaries of the Shatt-al-Arab. The chief stream of Khuzistan is the K\u0101r\u016bn, which Mustawfi and other geographers call the Dujayl (q.v.), a lesser river. This had its source in the 'Lur Mountains'\u2014of Great Lur, where the river Kazki had its head-waters (L. 204q, 205). The Dujayl river, after many windings, joins with the Tis\u0101r at \u2018Askar Mukram and Ahw\u0101z, and flows into the Dizful river, and their united stream is the second estuary of the Shatt-al-\u2018Arab flowing out into the Persian Gulf. The Dizful river, which flows below \u2018Askar Mukram, was joined by the united streams of the Kazki river and the Dujayl of Ahw\u0101z, which last, flowing down from\nBur\u016bjird (see above, Chapter 2), was also named the Sil\u0101kh\u016br (L. 215u). Further to the westward came the Karkhah, also called the river of S\u016bs; this rose in the Alvand mountains; it was soon joined by the river K\u016blk\u016b, also by the stream from Khurram\u0101b\u0101d, and thence flowing down past S\u016bs to the \u1e24awizah country came to the tidal estuary of the K\u0101r\u016bn, by which its waters, uniting with the overflow of the Tigris and Euphrates, finally reached the sea (L. 216v, also Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 286).\n\nThe boundary between Kh\u016bzist\u0101n and F\u0101rs was formed by the river T\u0101b, which is the name that Mustawfi and all the Arab geographers give to the river called at present the Jarr\u0101hi; the modern T\u0101b river (flowing past Hindiy\u0101n) being presumably the medi\u00e6val \u0100b-i-Shir\u012bn, but there is some confusion in the present nomenclature. The T\u0101b river (of Mustawfi and the Arab geographers) rose in the Sar\u0101m hills in Lurist\u0101n, it was soon joined by the waters of the \u0100b-i-Mas\u012bn which came down from the Sumayram mountains, and the united streams some distance below the point of junction were crossed by the great bridge of Rak\u0101n near Arraj\u0101n. After watering the R\u012bshahr districts the T\u0101b finally flowed out to the sea (L. 218s, u); and these places will all be more particularly mentioned in Chapter 12 on F\u0101rs.\n\nKh\u016bzist\u0101n was coterminous on the north with Kurdist\u0101n, these two Provinces coming in between Arabian and Persian \u2018Ir\u0101k, though Saymarah, counted as of the latter (see Chapter 2), must have been very near the frontier of \u2018Ir\u0101k \u2018Arab\u012b. When Mustawfi wrote the capital of the Kh\u016bzist\u0101n Province was Tustar, already then commonly called Shustar, famous for the great weir across the K\u0101r\u016bn, which at the city gate divided the stream into three parts, called respectively the Canals of Dasht-\u0100b\u0101d, of D\u016b-D\u0101nik, and of Chah\u0101r-D\u0101nik (Two Sixths and Four Sixths). Ahw\u0101z has already been noticed in my paper on Ibn Serapion (p. 311). The town of Turb (or T\u016bb according to some MSS.), on the sea-shore, I cannot identify, but apparently it occupied more or less the position of B\u0101siy\u0101n, so frequently\nThe town was visited by I\n\nthe ruins of which has apparentl\nChapter 12.

The Islands of the Persian Gulf, namely, Kays, 180r; Abr\u016bn, 181d; Abarkum\u0101n, 181e; and Kh\u0101rik, 181f.\n\nIn the time of the \u012al-Kh\u0101n dynasty F\u0101rs had come to be a much smaller province than it had been during the Caliphate, and as described by the Arab geographers. In the pages of \u1e24amd-Allah F\u0101rs has lost the whole of the Yazd district on the north-east, this under the Mongols being given to Persian \u2018Ir\u0101\u1e33; while the eastern districts round D\u0101r\u0101bjird, having taken the name of Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah, had been formed into a separate province, which under this title will be noticed in the following chapter. A long and interesting account is given by \u1e24amd-Allah of Sh\u012br\u0101z, the capital of the F\u0101rs province since the Moslem conquest; the nine gates in its walls are enumerated, and its various mosques and shrines are described in some detail. \u1e24amd-Allah notes further that the territory immediately adjacent to the city was called its \u1e24\u016bmah (often written J\u016bmah or Jaumah), a word that may be translated \u2018domain.\u2019 Two leagues distant from Sh\u012br\u0101z was the mountain called K\u016bh-i-D\u0101rak, on which the winter snow was stored in pits for use in the hot weather (L. 203y); while three farsakhs to the south of Sh\u012br\u0101z was a castle known as Kal\u2018ah-i-T\u012bz (other readings in the MSS. give B\u012br, Tabr, T\u012br, Tash\u012br, etc.), which crowned a solitary hill, on the summit of which was a spring of water (L. 179d). Also in the Sh\u012br\u0101z district was the Castle of Khuv\u0101r (L. 179n), and this place is mentioned by I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (p. 104) as a small town of the Ardash\u012br Khurrah district. Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 199; ii, 480), who copies the account, adds no particulars, and evidently cannot give more exactly the position. Sh\u012br\u0101z has no river, but its waters drain eastward to the salt lake of M\u0101hal\u016byah (L. 226c), which is some twelve leagues in circuit, and lies in the plain a few miles from the city on the left hand of the road to Sarvist\u0101n.\nThe shores of the lake were used for salt-pans, and much salt was exported from Shiraz to outlying places.\n\nThe sea-coast districts of Fars, known as the A'm\u0101l-i-S\u012bf, were divided between the S\u012bf\u2014'Coast'\u2014of the Ban\u012b Zuhayr and the S\u012bf of 'Um\u0101rah. The positions of these districts are given by I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (pp. 140, 141) and by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 217), the former region lying near Siraf and the latter near the Kirm\u0101n border, over against the Island of Kays. The B\u016bshk\u0101n\u0101t district, according to the F\u0101rs N\u0101mah (f. 86a), lay twelve leagues from Ghundij\u0101n towards Naj\u012bram. Tavvaj, often spelt Tawwaz [1], had been a celebrated commercial town in early days, but when Mustawfi wrote it was already in ruins. Apparently no traces of it now exist; it stood, however, near the lower course of the Sh\u0101p\u016br river, called the Tawwaj-\u0100b, and according to I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (pp. 128, 133) lay about half-way between K\u0101zir\u016bn and Jann\u0101bah [40].\n\nKhabr [2], somewhat over fifty miles south-east of Shiraz, exists, and was famous for its castle, called Kal'ah Tir-i-Khud\u0101\u2014'God's Arrow' (L. 179g). The region of Khatiz\u012bn (which some MSS. give as Khayriz or Khat\u016bhar) I am not able to identify; the districts of Ramzav\u0101n and D\u0101dhin lay south of Jirrah. Dav\u0101n plain, according to the F\u0101rs N\u0101mah (f. 73b), lay six leagues north of M\u0101y\u012bn [17]. Khunayfgh\u0101n [3], which was commonly called Khan\u0101fg\u0101n, was to the north of Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d at the sources of the Bur\u0101zah river. Sarvist\u0101n is near the eastern end of the M\u0101hal\u012byah Lake; but K\u016bhj\u0101n (or K\u016bbanj\u0101n in the F\u0101rs N\u0101mah) has apparently disappeared from the map. Of Siraf, the celebrated port on the Persian Gulf, the ruins still exist, and have been described by Captain Stiffe (J.R.G.S., 1895, p. 166), and according to I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (p. 34) Naj\u012bram lay to the northward of it, Kh\u016brshi (or Kh\u016br\u0101shi) being of its dependencies.\n\n\u1e62\u012bmk\u0101n [4] lies to the east of Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d (cf. Stack, Six Months in Persia, ii, 232), and \u1e24\u012brak was a large village near by. Of Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d, anciently called J\u016br, the chief town of the district of the same name, \u1e24amd-Allah gives a long account, mentioning also its castle (L. 179o), called Kal'ah Shah\u0101rah, which crowned a height four leagues\nfrom the city. The Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d river was called the \u0100b-i-Bur\u0101zah\\(^1\\) (L. 219g), a right bank affluent of the \u0100b-i-Zak\u0101n (L. 214s), which last is by far the most important stream in this part of Persia. The Zak\u0101n (or Zhak\u0101n; the MS. of the F\u0101rs N\u0101mah always spells the name Thak\u0101n) is named by I\u0161takhri (p. 120) and other Arab geographers the Nahr Sakk\u0101n, and is the present K\u0101r\u0101 Agh\u0101ch, which rises at some distance to the north-west of Shir\u0101z. It flows into the sea a little to the south of Najiram, and in its lower course is now known as the Mand river. The town of Kaw\u0101r [5] is near its left bank (half-way between Shir\u0101z and Khabr already mentioned), and after passing \u0160imk\u0101n, not far from its right bank are the towns of K\u012br, K\u0101rz\u012bn [6], and Abzar. K\u0101riy\u0101n [7] lies at some distance to the eastward of these places, and L\u0101ghir [8] is mentioned by Mr. Stack (ii, 233), also by Mustawfi in his Itineraries (Route xxviii).\n\nK\u0101rz\u012bn had a celebrated castle (L. 179q) on a hill overhanging the river bank. Kaharj\u0101n or Makarj\u0101n apparently lay near L\u0101ghir, and about half-way between this last and Sir\u0101f, on the coast, was the town of K\u016br\u0101n [9] in the \u012ar\u0101hist\u0101n District, lying adjacent to the Zuhayr coast, mentioned in a previous paragraph and described by I\u0161takhri (pp. 106, 141, 454). The region of M\u0101ndist\u0101n was on the coast, and probably the name is connected with the present Mand river, as the lower part of the K\u0101r\u0101 Agh\u0101ch (\u0100b-i-Zak\u0101n) is called. Mimand [10] is the chief town of the N\u0101band district on the coast, to the east of Sir\u0101f, as mentioned by I\u0161takhri (p. 104), but I am unable to identify H\u016bm\u016b or Hamj\u0101n Kabr\u012bn; many MSS. give Harm\u016bd and Hamj\u0101n Kirtan, and the readings are more than doubtful. The port of Huz\u016b was opposite the Island of Kays; this is the last stage in the Itinerary (Route xxviii) from Shir\u0101z to the coast; and T\u0101nah (or T\u0101bah) was a village near.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is the spelling of the F\u0101rs N\u0101mah (i. 79b), who says it was so named after the great engineer Hakim Bur\u0101zah of the days of King Ardash\u012br. The MSS. generally give the name as Bar\u0101rah.\nThe city [11] of I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr (Persepolis) had been the capital of F\u0101rs before the Moslem conquest. It lay on the banks of the Parv\u0101b or Pulv\u0101r river (L. 218r), a left bank affluent of the Kur. In the neighbourhood of Persepolis was a cave in the mountain called K\u016bh-i-N\u012bsht (or Na\u02bfisht), where there were famous sculptures (L. 206v). I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr was celebrated for its three great castles, called the Sih-Gumbadh\u0101n\u2014'Three Domes'\u2014which crown the hill-tops to the north of the Marvdasht plain. These were known as the Kal\u02bfah I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr, the Kal\u02bfah Shikastah\u2014'the Broken Castle'\u2014and the Kal\u02bfah Shankav\u0101n (L. 178u). Further, there was the Kal\u02bfah I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr Y\u0101r, or B\u0101r, probably on the hill above Persepolis (L. 179a), where ruins still exist. The remains of the three castles on the hill-tops to the westward, which were famous for their great cisterns, have some of them been visited and described by Morier (Second Journey in Persia, pp. 83, 86) and De Bode (Lurist\u0101n, i, 117). Abraj, as the name is spelt in the F\u0101rs N\u0101mah, often incorrectly written \u012araj, appears from I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr\u012b (p. 102) to have been near M\u0101y\u012bn [17], and it stood at the base of a hill, on which was a strong castle called Diz Abraj or \u012araj (L. 179c). Abark\u016bh\u00b9 is the well-known town on the frontier of F\u0101rs [12] towards Yazd; and near it was Far\u0101ghah (written Mar\u0101ghah in some MSS., also in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 266), which was celebrated for its cypresses. Uzj\u0101n, or Uj\u0101n, lies north of M\u0101y\u012bn. Not, however, to be found on the map are Isfand\u0101n (or Isfid\u0101n) and Kumist\u0101n (or Kuhist\u0101n), these being all copied into the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 266), and near Kumist\u0101n in\n\n\u00b9 According to Hamd-Allah (L. 174g) Abark\u016bh was remarkable for the fact that no Jew could survive for more than forty days who settled here. Hence these people were not found among the population of the town. Further in Abark\u016bh stood the tomb of the celebrated saint surnamed T\u0101\u02bf\u016bs-al-Haramayn\u2014'Peacock of the Two Sanctuaries,' viz. Mecca and Medina\u2014and it was a known fact that his shrine would never suffer itself to be covered by a roof. However often a roof was erected over the tomb, it was invariably destroyed by a supernatural power, lest the saint's bones should become the object of an idolatrous worship. The same phenomenon is said by Ibn Bat\u016btah (ii, 113) to be characteristic of the shrine of Ibn Hanbal at Baghdad; and Professor Goldziher has some interesting remarks on this subject in his Muhammedanische Studien (i, 257).\nthe mountain there was a mighty cave. Iklid [13] and Surmak [14] lie to the south-west of Abark\u016bh. Bavv\u0101n (with variants Tav\u0101n or T\u016bm\u0101n) and Mar\u00fcst (possibly Marvdasht) were two villages in the great Persepolis plain, which itself bore the latter name; in the upper, western, part of the Marvdasht plain lay the city of Bayd\u0101 [15], celebrated for its pasture-lands.\n\nThe town of Ab\u0101dah stood on the northern side of Lake Bakhtig\u0101n, and there was a celebrated castle here (L. 179b). This town is frequently mentioned by I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (p. 131) and other Arab geographers; it was also known as the village of \u2018Abd-ar-Rahm\u0101n. Hafrak is the district near the junction of the Pulv\u0101r river with the Kur, and Har\u012br was near Lake Bakhtig\u0101n. Sabziv\u0101r and K\u0101li (or F\u0101l\u012b) appear to have been famous meadow-lands or Marghs\u0101r near the Pulv\u0101r river (L. 180b). Kharramah [16], also celebrated for its castle (L. 179b), is a town to the east of Sh\u012br\u0101z near the Bakhtig\u0101n Lake at the place where the river Kur flows in. R\u0101mjird is the district higher up the river Kur\u2014above the plain of Marvdasht\u2014and M\u0101yin [17] is the capital town of R\u0101mjird.\n\nThese districts were all watered by the Kur, of which Mustawfi gives a long account (L. 216a). This river rose above Kall\u0101r [22], was joined on its right bank by a stream from Sha'b Bavv\u0101n, and lower down on the left bank near Persepolis by the \u0100b-i-Parv\u0101b or Pulv\u0101r river (L. 218r). In its lower reaches the Kur river was crossed by a number of weirs, each serving to raise a head of water for irrigation purposes. The first dam or weir was that called the Band-i-Mujarrad, an ancient foundation, which was repaired under the Salj\u016bks by their Atabeg, or Governor, in F\u0101rs, the celebrated Fakhr-ad-Dawlah Ch\u0101\u016bli (spelt J\u0101\u016bli by Ibn-al-Athir, x, 202), who then gave it the name of Fakhrist\u0101n. Below this was the \u2018Ad\u016bd\u012b or Band-i-Amir (Bendemir of the poet Moore, in Lalla Rookh), built by \u2018Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, and marked in the Itineraries (Route xxxii); this served to raise the waters for irrigating the two districts of Upper and Lower Kirb\u0101l. The lowest of the dams was the\nFuller's Weir\u2014Band-i-Kassar\u2014at no great distance above the point where the Kur flowed out to the Lake of Bakhtig\u0101n. This was the largest of the salt lakes of F\u0101rs, and when Mustawfi wrote was surrounded by populous districts and towns, among which occur the names of \u1e24ar\u012br, Ab\u0101dah, Khayrah, Nayriz, and S\u0101hik (L. 225y). The north-western part of the lake was known as the Bu\u1e25ayrah B\u0101safhuyah (L. 226v), and it was celebrated for its fish. S\u0101hik (or Ch\u0101hik) and Har\u0101t [19] lay at some distance from the eastern borders of the Bakhtig\u0101n Lake, and Ku\u1e6druh [20] is to the south-east.\n\nThe most northern town of F\u0101rs towards Isfah\u0101n is K\u016bmishah, protected by the Castle of K\u016blanj\u0101n. The district of K\u0101m Fir\u016bz lay on the banks of the Kur river (south of R\u0101mjird), being celebrated for its lion-haunted forests; and the two districts of Kirb\u0101l, as already said, were on the lower reaches of the same river near the Fuller's Weir (Band-i-Kassar). Kam\u012bn [21] lies north of Istakhr, near the Pulv\u0101r river, and K\u0101rin was a town near it. Kall\u0101r and K\u016brad [22] were on the upper waters of the Kur river, and their positions are fixed by Mu\u1e63addas\u012b (p. 458) in his Itinerary, being five farsakhs north of K\u0101m-Fir\u016bz. Yazdikhw\u0101st [23] and Dih Gird\u016b [24] lie on the road to Isfah\u0101n, and in this connection Ab\u0101dah [25] (which still exists, and is not to be confounded with the town of the same name on Lake Bakhtig\u0101n) is mentioned, lying to the east of Dih Gird\u016b. Sh\u016brist\u0101n, according to the F\u0101rs N\u0101mah, lay half-way between this northern Ab\u0101dah and Yazdikhw\u0101st, while Dih M\u016brd\u2014'Myrtle Village'\u2014called by the Arab geographers \u1e32ariyat-al-\u0100s or B\u016bdanj\u0101n, stood by the shore of Lake Bakhtig\u0101n, half-way between the southern Ab\u0101dah and S\u0101hik. R\u0101dh\u0101n, according to Istakhri (p. 102), lay half-way between S\u0101hik and Shahr-i-B\u0101bak.\n\nIn the south-eastern part of F\u0101rs, the town of Jahram [26] is well known, and was famous in the time of Mustawfi for the strong castle, lying five leagues away on a hill-top, called Kal'ah Kh\u016brashah (L. 179h). Juvaym [27] of\nAbu A\u1e25mad lies south-east of Jahram, and its castle too was famous, being known as the Kal'ah Sam\u012br\u0101n or Sham\u012br\u0101n (L. 179p). The city of Fas\u0101 lies north of Jahram, on the border of Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah; Shakk R\u016bdb\u0101r and M\u012bsh\u0101n\u0101n (or P\u012bshk\u0101n\u0101t in some MSS.) were of its dependencies, and the castle called Kal'ah Khav\u0101d\u0101n (I. 179m) was a strong place in the neighbouring district.\n\nK\u0101zir\u016bn lies west of Sh\u012br\u0101z, on the road down to the sea. Mustawfi gives a long account of the place, which had originally consisted of three towns. In the plain to the east of K\u0101zir\u016bn is the lake which Mustawfi calls the Buhayrah Mawz, but the reading of the name is doubtful, both in the Nuzhat MSS. and in the text of Ibn \u1e24awk\u0101l (p. 193), from whom, apparently, he has taken the name of the lake. The ruins of the old city of Sh\u0101pur [28] are to be seen at some distance west of K\u0101zir\u016bn, and have been described by De Bode (L\u016brist\u0101n, i, 214) and others. Sh\u0101pur city appears originally to have been known as Bish\u0101v\u016br (for Bih-S\u0101b\u016br). Mustawfi gives a long account of the place, and further describes the colossal statue of King Sh\u0101pur, which may still be seen in the neighbouring cave.\n\nAnb\u016br\u0101n was a small town near Nawbanj\u0101n [29], and B\u0101sht K\u016b\u1e6d\u0101 (some MSS. give M\u0101sht F\u016b\u1e6d\u0101) a district in the mountains near, the whole of this neighbourhood being known under the name of Bil\u0101d Sh\u0101pur, or the Sh\u0101pur Country. Tir Murd\u0101n [30] was an important place mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 905), and it lay, according to \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd (i, 607), beyond the Valley of Bavv\u0101n and west of Kark\u0101n, which is mentioned in the Itinerary (Route xxxiii); the place called J\u016bbk\u0101n (or Kh\u016bbig\u0101n) and other districts were in its neighbourhood.\n\nThe mountain region called Jabal Jil\u016byah was on the Lurist\u0101n border, and the name is probably connected with\n\n---\n\nSo named to distinguish it from Juvayn [35], one stage to the north-west of Sh\u012br\u0101z see Route xxviii. This last is sometimes (incorrectly) written Juvayn; and in this case must not be confounded either with the city of Juvayn in S\u012bst\u0101n to the north of Zaranj see Route xvii, or with the Juvayn District of Khuras\u0101n see Chapter 17 lying between J\u0101jarm and Sabziv\u0101r.\nthe Kurdish Zamm, or tribe, of Jil\u00fcyah mentioned by \u0130\u015ftakhri (pp. 98, 113). Mustawfi elsewhere (L. 206g) speaks of the mountains called K\u016bh Gil\u00fcyah, and apparently a neighbouring range was the K\u016bh K\u016bshid lying between F\u0101rs and \u1e6cr\u0101k, where of old had lived a dragon slain by King Kay Khusr\u016b, who then built here the Fire-temple afterwards known as Dayr K\u016bshid (L. 206o). Probably of this district also was the mountain of K\u016bh M\u016brj\u0101n (or M\u016brkh\u0101n), in which was a cave, with dropping water, that was considered a talisman (L. 206t).\n\nThe \u0100b-i-Rat\u012bn, which rose in the district of Khum\u0101yij\u0101n, was an upper affluent of the Sh\u0101pur or Bish\u0101v\u016br river, the lower part of which was called the \u0100b-i-Tavvaj, where it passed the city of Tavvaj, or Tawwaz [1], before falling into the Persian Gulf (L. 219a, f'). The Sh\u0101pur river, up in the mountains, was joined on its left bank by the \u0100b-i-Jirrah, which, flowing down from the M\u0101\u1e63aram and Ghundij\u0101n districts, passes the city of Jirrah [31], which is some miles south-east of K\u0101zir\u016bn. Before its junction with the Sh\u0101pur river, the Jirrah river received from the south the combined waters of the \u0100b-i-Jarsh\u012bk and the Ikhs\u012bn river, this last being famous for its stone bridge called the Kan\u1e6darah Sabuk (L. 219b, d).\n\nGumbadh Mallagh\u0101n [32] lay about half-way between Nawbanj\u0101n and Arraj\u0101n, at the place now called D\u016b Gumbad\u0101n, where there are extensive ruins (De Bode, i, 258). It was famous for its castle, in the district of P\u016bl B\u016bl\u016b, which \"was so strong a Kal'ah that a single man could hold it\" (L. 179r). Khisht [33] and Kum\u0101rij [34] lie on the road down from Sh\u012br\u0101z to the coast, and not far from the banks of the Sh\u0101pur river. Khull\u0101r [35], celebrated for its mill-stones, lies about half-way between Nawbanj\u0101n and Sh\u012br\u0101z; Khum\u0101yij\u0101n, with Dih 'Ali, being a district to the westward of Khull\u0101r. To the north, on the Lur frontier, came the districts of S\u012bsh\u0101t (or Sal\u1e25\u0101t in some MSS.), also B\u0101zrank and \u0160ar\u0101m, which last Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (ii, 45) gives as Char\u0101m. Ghundij\u0101n, generally called Dasht B\u0101r\u012bn, was the region in the neighbourhood of Jirrah [31], and here stood the\ncastle called Kal'ah Dam Dar\u0101n, or Ram Var\u0101n, for the name is variously given in the manuscripts (L. 179a).\n\nNawbanj\u0101n [29], more commonly called Nawbandag\u0101n, had been rebuilt by Atabeg Ch\u0101uli; it was renowned for the great White Castle, and for the neighbouring valley called Sh\u0101h Bavv\u0101n, always counted as one of the four earthly paradises, such was its fertility and beauty. I\u1e63f\u012bd D\u012bs, 'the White Castle,' also called Kal'ah I\u1e63fandiy\u0101r (L. 178p), after one of the heroes of ancient Persia, lies two leagues distant to the north-east of Nawbanj\u0101n, and occupies the summit of a table-mountain; it is accessible by one road only, being on all sides protected by precipices (Macdonald Kinneir, Persian Empire, p. 73). At the foot of the mountain fastness was a second smaller castle called Nishn\u0101k (Nishkun\u0101n in some MSS.). Half a century after the time of Mustawfi, Kal'ah Saf\u012bd (as it was more generally called) became famous for the siege and sack which it suffered at the hands of Timur, as recorded by 'Al\u012b of Yazd in the Zafar N\u0101mah (i, 600).\n\nThe K\u016brah or district of Kub\u0101d Khurr\u0101h was one of the ancient divisions of F\u0101rs, and according to I\u1e63takhri (p. 125) it was that of which K\u0101rzin [6] was the capital, already mentioned, near the Zak\u0101n river, on the eastern border. Arraj\u0101n was the chief town of F\u0101rs on the western side, towards Kh\u016bzist\u0101n. It is now a complete ruin, being replaced by Bihbah\u0101n, which appears to have been founded in the latter half of the fourteenth century A.D., after the time of Mustawfi, but prior to the date when Timur invaded Persia. In the account of his campaigns given in the Zafar N\u0101mah (i, 600), the city of Bihbah\u0101n only is mentioned by 'Al\u012b of Yazd, though its river is called by him the \u0100b-i-Argh\u016bn, that is to say, the Arraj\u0101n river, as confirmed by the statement of both Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 193) and Mustawfi, who write that Arraj\u0101n in their day was generally called Arragh\u0101n or Argh\u0101n. Its ruins lie not far from the bank of the (older) T\u0101b river, now known as the Jarr\u0101h\u012b (see above, Chapter II), which separates F\u0101rs from Kh\u016bzist\u0101n. At the crossing of the river was the celebrated bridge called\nP\u016bl-i-Tak\u0101n, which is described by I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr\u012b (p. 134). The ruins of this bridge still exist, also those of a second bridge likewise described by the Arab geographers, and fully noticed in the travels of De Bode (*L\u016brist\u0101n*, i, 297), who, it may be remarked, was the first to identify Arraj\u0101n.\n\nAccording to \u1e24amd-Allah there were various castles of the Ismailian sect, known as the Assassins, in the hills above Arraj\u0101n. Such were Kal'ah \u1e6cayf\u016br and Diz Kal\u0101t, this last being one league distant from the town of R\u012bshahr [36], otherwise called R\u016bsh\u012br, which lay to the west of Arraj\u0101n. B\u016bst\u0101nak [37] was the last stage in F\u0101rs on the Kh\u016bzist\u0101n frontier, as given in the Itinerary (*Route xxxiii*). Hindij\u0101n exists, \u1e24abs (also given as J\u012bs or Khabs) and Furzuk were near Arraj\u0101n, but the spelling of these names is not sure, and their exact position is uncertain. Jann\u0101b\u0101 [40], also called Ganbah, was a celebrated port on the Gulf, the ruins of which still exist; it was originally named Gand\u0101b, or \u2018the back-water,\u2019 by the Persians. The river called the \u0100b-i-Shir\u012bn, which rose in the hills called K\u016bh-i-D\u012bn\u0101r, flowed out to the sea near Mahrub\u0101n and is the modern T\u0101b or Zuhrah river. Near Jann\u0101b\u0101 was the mouth of the Sitadk\u0101n or Sh\u0101dhk\u0101n river, which flowed down from the B\u0101zrank hills (this district has been mentioned above) and the region of Kahark\u0101n (L. 218v, v). According to Mustawfi, Jall\u0101dj\u0101n and Hayv\u016bd\u012bn (many MSS. give H\u016bdv\u012bn) were districts near Arraj\u0101n; Mahrub\u0101n [38] was the port on the Gulf at the frontier of Kh\u016bzist\u0101n, S\u012bn\u012bz [39] being the next port down the coast, eastward, and on the other side of the bay opposite Mahrub\u0101n.\n\nThe river Khw\u0101nd\u0101n, or Kh\u016bbdh\u0101n (L. 218z), was an affluent of the Nahr Shir\u012bn, which flows out to the sea near Mahrub\u0101n (the modern river T\u0101b, see above, Chapter 11). It rose in the Kh\u016bbdh\u0101n or Khw\u0101nd\u0101n hills near Nawbanj\u0101n [29], and in its lower course watered the district of Jall\u0101dj\u0101n already mentioned. There is, however, much confusion in the nomenclature of all these rivers of western F\u0101rs; and this goes back to the descriptions of them given by I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr\u012b and other of the Arab geographers, whose notices do not\ntally with the streams as shown on our present maps. This is especially the case with the river called the \u0100b-i-Darkh\u012bd (or Darkhuvayd), which flowed out of (some MSS. give it as flowing into) the Darkh\u012bd Lake (L. 218y, 226d), which lay to the west of Nawbanj\u0101n. It was a large river and not easily fordable, but what stream it corresponds to on our modern maps is not very clear, though it may be that now known as the \u0100b-i-Sh\u016br.\n\nIn regard to the celebrated castles of F\u0101rs Hamd-Allah states that these had numbered over seventy in ancient times, but that most had gone to ruin with the lapse of time, and sixteen only in his day remained standing. All these have been mentioned in previous pages, when speaking of the various towns or districts to which each belonged, and it is needless to recapitulate them here, the list having been given in the table of contents to this chapter.\n\nHamd-Allah next enumerates the various Marghz\u0101rs, the celebrated pastures or meadow-lands of F\u0101rs. That of \u0100vard (or Urd) was on the road between Isfah\u0101n and Sh\u012br\u0101z, near Kushk-i-Zard, two stages south of Yazdikhw\u0101st (see Route xxvii); and the Marghz\u0101r of Dasht-i-R\u016bn (or Rav\u0101n) was one stage south of this again, near the Rub\u0101\u1e6d, or Caravanserai, of Sal\u0101\u1e25-ad-D\u012bn, whence it extended to the Shahriy\u0101r Bridge over the upper course of the Kur river. The Marghz\u0101r of Dasht Arzin lay near the lake of that name (L. 226a) on the road between Sh\u012br\u0101z and K\u0101zir\u016bn; it was noted for the lions who haunted its thickets, and the same remark is added to the notice of the Marghz\u0101r of Shik\u0101n (Ushk\u0101n, Arashk\u0101n are other readings of the name) in the district of Juvaym of Abu A\u1e25mad; in the neighbourhood of which also was the Marghz\u0101r of Bahm\u0101n. The Marghz\u0101r of Bid and Mashk\u0101n appears to have been near Tustar in Kh\u016bzist\u0101n; that of Bay\u1e0d\u0101 was near the town of that name in the Marvdasht plain. No position is given for the Marghz\u0101r of Shid\u0101n close to which was \u2018the Lake of the Marghz\u0101r\u2019 (L. 226r), but this meadow-land was famous as being one of the four earthly paradises. The Meadows of K\u016bl\u012b (or F\u0101l\u012b or F\u016bl) were on the banks\nof the Pulv\u0101r river, where also lay the Marghz\u0101r K\u0101l\u0101n near the grave of the Mother of King Solomon, as the Moslems have named the Tomb of Cyrus; while further down the Pulv\u0101r river were the Kamin meadow-lands. The Marghz\u0101r of K\u0101m Fir\u016bz lay along the Kur river, where its thickets were haunted by lions; and lastly, the Marghz\u0101r-i-Narkis\u2014'the Narcissus-Meadows'\u2014were between Kazir\u016bn and Jirrah.\n\nThe Persian Gulf and its Islands are described by Mustawfi at the end of his chapter on F\u0101rs, and also at a later page (L. 222s) when describing the Seas; further, he gives the distances between the chief islands in his Itinerary (Routes iv and xxviii). Some confusion, however, exists in the names given during the middle ages to the various islands. The Island of Kh\u0101rik still bears this name, and lies some forty miles north-west of the modern Bushire. On the road to India, and eighty leagues further down the Gulf, came the Island of Al\u0101n (otherwise L\u0101n or All\u0101r), which by the distances must be the present Island of Shaykh Shu\u2018ayb. According to Mustawfi and other geographers, between this and \u1e34ays came the two islands called Abr\u016bn and Khayn, and the former is probably that now known as the Hindarabi Island.\n\nThe great emporium (Dawlat-Kh\u0101nah) of \u1e34ays, as described by Mustawfi, was the most populous island of the Gulf, and lay four leagues from Huz\u016b on the mainland, where the road coming down from Shir\u0101z reached the coast. From \u1e34ays the ships sailed for India, and at the narrows of the Gulf came the great island called Abr\u016bkam\u0101n\u0101n (Abarkum\u0101n in some MSS. or Abark\u0101f\u0101n, with many other variants). Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (iv, 342) calls this L\u0101ft, or the Island of the Bani Kaw\u0101n, and its name was spelt in a variety of different ways: but, undoubtedly, what is now known as the Long Island of Kishm (Jazirah Tawilah) is the place indicated. To the east of this came Hurmuz, which will be mentioned in Chapter 14 on Kirm\u0101n; and the island of Hurmuz was called Jir\u016bn where the city of New Hurmuz came to be founded. A neighbouring island,\nhowever, appears already from the earliest times to have borne the name of Urm\u016b\u015f or Urm\u016bz, recalling the name of Hurmuz. It is mentioned by \u1e24amd-Allah (L. 222s) and many of the earlier Arab geographers, as, for instance, Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 62), but what island this Urm\u016b\u015f now corresponds to is not very clear. The island of J\u0101s\u012bk may, from what Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 503) writes, be another name for the great Island of Kishm, and therefore a duplicate name. Besides J\u0101s\u012bk (or Kh\u0101s\u012bk) Mustawfi mentions (L. 222s) the islands of Kand, An\u0101sh\u0101k, and L\u0101hur (in the MSS. given as L\u0101dur or L\u0101wur, and possibly identical with L\u0101n or L\u0101r already given), but these I am unable satisfactorily to identify.\n\nChapter 13. Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah.\n\nContents: Av\u012bg, 181k; Dark\u0101n, 181m; I\u1e63\u1e6dahban\u0101n, 181n; Burk, T\u0101rum, Khayrah, N\u012briz, and Misk\u0101nat, 181p; D\u0101r\u0101bgird, 181r; Kurm and R\u016bbanz, 181w; L\u0101r, 181x.\n\nWhat became the province of Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah under the Mongols, had formed the eastern part of F\u0101rs in the time of the Caliphate, as already stated in the previous chapter. The name Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah does not occur in the earlier geographers, but the district came in Mongol days to be called after the people who inhabited it, the Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah being a powerful family settled in these regions during the period of the Salj\u016bk supremacy. They waged successful war against the Salj\u016bk Atabegs \u2014 against the Amir Ch\u0101\u016bli, mentioned in the previous chapter, in particular; and finally after the fall of the Salj\u016bks these Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah were left masters of the whole western part of F\u0101rs.\n\nNearly all the towns named by \u1e24amd-Allah as of Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah may still be recognized on the present map. The capital of the district was \u012ag, or Av\u012bg, a strong fortress, with the town of Dark\u0101n [1], or Zark\u0101n, situated at no great distance from it, both places still existing, and further.\nbeing mentioned by the earlier authorities. I\u1e63\u1e6dahb\u0101n\u0101n [2], which the Arab geographers write variously as I\u1e63\u1e6daban\u0101t, I\u1e63bah\u0101nat, and I\u1e63bahbadh\u0101t, is now called Savan\u0101t, lying a short distance north-west of \u012ag; N\u012briz [3] lies to the east of it, and Khayrah [4] between Savan\u0101t and the shore of Lake Bakhtig\u0101n (see Route xxxi), which, in its southeastern bay, forms the northern frontier of the Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah district, and is often called the Lake of N\u012briz. Burk represents the town the name of which is now generally pronounced Forg, and which the Arab geographers wrote Furj. There is, however, the evidence of Mu\u1e33addas\u012b (p. 428) that of old there were here two neighbouring towns, called Furj and Burk, and the latter site is now probably represented by the Castle of Bahram, described by Mr. Stack (Six Months, i, 156). T\u0101rum [5] lies on the frontier to the east of Forg; the Mishk\u0101nat (or M\u0101skin\u0101t) district being on the road between Khayrah and N\u012briz.\n\nD\u0101r\u0101bgird had been the chief town of eastern F\u0101rs in earlier days; there was near this in the hills a famous pass, called Tang-i-Zin\u0101h, commanded by a strong castle. The mountains of D\u0101r\u0101bgird (L. 204f) were celebrated for the salt, of seven diverse colours, that was dug out of the mines here, and in the southern part of the country was the mountain called K\u016bh-i-Rast\u0101\u1e33, \u201cthree leagues in height, like a snow-covered dome,\u201d where great serpents abounded (L. 204g). The towns of Kurm [6] and R\u016bbanz (generally spelt R\u016bniz, in error, in the MSS.) lay on the road towards Fa\u1e63\u0101; the first still exists, and R\u016bbanz or R\u016bbanj was the chief town of the Khas\u016b district mentioned by Mu\u1e33addas\u012b (p. 423), the town of Khas\u016b, now to be found on the map, being identical in all probability with the older R\u016bbanj city. L\u0101r, which is not mentioned by the older Arab geographers, appears to have been a foundation of the Shab\u0101nk\u0101rah. Mustawfi speaks of it merely as a district (Vil\u0101yat), but his contemporary, Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah (ii, 240), speaks of \u201cthe great city of L\u0101r,\u201d celebrated for its five markets, and \u1e24amd-Allah adds in his account that the people of L\u0101r were mostly merchants who occupied themselves with sea voyages.\nChapter 14. Kirm\u0101n.\n\nContents: Guw\u0101sh\u012br or Bardas\u012br, 182c; Bam, 182j; J\u012bruft, 182l; Khab\u012b\u1e63, 182n; R\u012bgh\u0101n, 182o; Sirj\u0101n, 182p; Shahr-i-B\u0101bak, 182q; Narm\u0101sh\u012br, 182r; Old and New Hurmuz, 182t.\n\nThe medi\u00e6val Guw\u0101sh\u012br or Bardas\u012br, as has been shown in a previous paper (J.R.A.S. for April, 1901, p. 284), represents the present city of Kirm\u0101n. Mustawfi quotes (in Arabic) an anecdote having reference to the first Moslem conquest of Kirm\u0101n, when its inhospitable climate was reported on to \u1e24ajj\u0101j, the Viceroy of \u2018Ir\u0101k, by the Arab commander. The text is, of course, most unintelligibly transcribed in the Bombay lithographed edition and in most of the MSS.; it will be found, however, given in full by Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b in his Meadows of Gold (v, 341). Among other matters Mustawfi speaks of the Old Mosque in Guw\u0101sh\u012br, dating from the time of the Omayyad Caliph Omar II; he also refers to the celebrated garden called the B\u0101gh-i-Sirj\u0101n\u012b laid out by the Am\u012br \u2018Al\u012b Iliy\u0101s, who had removed the capital of the province from Sirj\u0101n to Guw\u0101sh\u012br, and who also built the great Castle of the Hill. Further, within the city was also the mosque known as the J\u0101mi\u2018-i-Tabr\u012bz\u012b, founded by T\u016br\u0101n Shah the Salju\u1e33, this being that used for the Friday Prayer when Mustawfi wrote.\n\nThe town of Bam is on the eastern borders of Kirm\u0101n; J\u012bruft, of which the ruins exist at the present Shahr-i-D\u0101ky\u0101nus (see J.R.G.S., 1855, p. 47), lying some distance to the south-west of it, being built on the river called the D\u012bv-r\u016bd\u2014\u2018Demon-stream\u2019\u2014from its violent course (L. 219e), the stream now known as the Khalil-r\u016bd. Khab\u012b\u1e63 lies east of Kirm\u0101n city near the desert border, and R\u012bgh\u0101n or Rik\u0101n is south-east of Bam. Sirj\u0101n, as I have shown in my paper above referred to, must probably be sought for at the ruins near Farid\u016bn. Sirj\u0101n had been the older capital of the Kirm\u0101n province, but in the time of Mustawfi, though merely a provincial town, Sirj\u0101n was still an important place\nwith a strong castle, and it only fell to ruin after the days of Timur. Shahr-i-B\u0101bak still exists, in the north-western angle of the Kirm\u0101n province; while Narm\u0101sh\u012br stands on the desert border on the other side, south-east, towards Makr\u0101n.\n\nOn the south coast of Kirm\u0101n lay the port of Hurmuz on the mainland (at the site now marked Minao on the map), but this place, as Mustawfi records, had already been abandoned in his day. The King of Hurmuz, Fakhr-ad-D\u012bn\u2014or \u1e32\u016b\u1e6db-ad-D\u012bn, as some MSS. give the name, following in this Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah (ii, 230)\u2014had migrated with his people on account of the attacks of brigands, and had established his capital for greater safety on the Island of Jir\u016bn, one league distant from the shore (the present Ormuz Island). This transfer of the capital would appear to have taken place in the year 715 (A.D. 1315), though nearly a century later, in the time of Timur, Old Hurmuz, according to \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd (Zafar N\u0101mah, i, 789, 809), was still an important city. There were mountains in Kirm\u0101n (L. 206h) where, says Mustawfi, a stone capable of being burnt for firewood existed (doubtless lignite), and this was used for fuel in those parts. To the north-east of Hurmuz on the Bal\u016bch frontier were the mountains called the K\u016bh-i-\u1e32af\u1e63, which are frequently mentioned by the earlier Arab geographers; also in Kirm\u0101n was the range named K\u016bh-i-\u1e32\u0101r\u012bn, which are the mountains more properly called Jabal B\u0101riz by the older geographers, but which Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 148) had already misnamed, being doubtless the authority used by Mustawfi (L. 205x, 206e, and cf. I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri, p. 163, note d).\n\n1 The Bombay Lithograph gives M\u0101shiz for Narm\u0101sh\u012br, but the latter reading is that of all the best MSS. and agrees with the statement that it was a town founded by Ardash\u012br B\u0101bag\u0101n, for M\u0101shiz is a modern place.\n\n2 The history of Hurmuz is obscure; the best account of its rulers that I have met with will be found in the Majma\u2018-al-Ans\u0101b, an historical work written about the year 743 (A.D. 1343). Of this work our Society possessed a MS., and another copy (Add. MS. 16,696) will be found in the British Museum Library. Dates are unfortunately very generally omitted in the Majma\u2018-al-Ans\u0101b, but it gives an account of the Kings of Hurmuz, as also of the Atabeg Ch\u0101n\u012bl and others, who ruled in F\u0101rs before the advent of the Sunk\u016br\u012b Atabegs, hence it is a valuable authority. For the present state of Hurmuz see the papers by Captain Stiffe in the Geographical Magazine for 1874, vol. i, p. 12, and the J.R.G.S., 1894, p. 160.\nChapter 16. The Desert.\n\nContents: Jarmak, 183b; Sanij and the two cities of Tabas, 183c; Kuhbinan, 183d; Nih, 183e.\n\nThe great salt desert of central Iran, which is now generally known as the Kavir (a name of uncertain etymology), is always referred to by Mustawfi by its Arabic name, Mafazah, meaning 'the wilderness.' He describes it as extending from the village of S\u00fcmgh\u00e4n\u2014which the Mughals called Ak Khwajah, lying a little south of Kasvin\u2014right across Persia in a south-easterly direction, and reaching nearly down to the sea of Om\u00e1n at Hurmuz. The south-western limit of the desert was marked by the towns of S\u0101vah, Kum, K\u0101sh\u0101n, Zav\u0101rah, Nayin, Yasd, and thence along the Kirm\u0101n and Makran border to the mountains above the coast. The north-eastern limit of the desert went by Ray along the borders of K\u016bmis and part of Khur\u0101san, then by K\u016bhistan and Z\u0101vil down to S\u012bst\u0101n, and thence to the neighbourhood of Hurmuz.\n\nIn the middle of the Great Desert, half-way across on the road going from Nishapur to Isfahan, lay the three villages of Jarmak in an oasis where there were water springs. This oasis, the position of which is fixed by the Arab Itineraries, was visited in 1875 by Colonel Macgregor (Khur\u0101san, i, 91); its chief village is now called Khur, and the district is Biy\u0101banak\u2014'Little waterless place'\u2014by which name it was already known in the seventeenth century, being mentioned by Tavernier in his Travels (Voyages, i, 769; La Haye, 1718). The position of Sanij is also fixed by the Arab Itineraries; it was on the Kirm\u0101n frontier, half-way between Narmashir and Zaranj. While there is no doubt about the position, there is some about the name, which in many MSS. of the Arab geographers may be read Safid or Isfand in place of Sanij (cf. Istakhri, p. 228, note r), and the MSS. of the Nuzhat confirm the doubtful reading.\nTabas, on the S\u012bst\u0101n border, will be mentioned in the following chapter; Kuhb\u012bn\u0101n (the Cobinan of Marco Polo) is on the K\u012brm\u0101n side, and has been visited by Mr. Stack (Six Months in Persia, i, 231). Lastly, of the towns mentioned Nih is in S\u012bst\u0101n, as marked on the map. On the extreme north-western border of the Great Desert, not far from the high road going down from Ray to Kum, lay the mountains called K\u016bh-i-Kargas\u2014\u2018the Vulture Hills\u2019\u2014and according to Mustawfi (L. 206e) their recesses were the chosen home of the Ibex (Wa\u2018il). The Vulture Hills are doubtless the present Siy\u0101h-Kuh\u2014\u2018the Black Hills\u2019\u2014overlooking the Kav\u012br, some distance to the east of Kum.\n\nChapter 16. Sijist\u0101n or Nimr\u016bz, and Kuhist\u0101n.\n\nContents: Zaranj, 183g; Tursh\u012bz, 183m; Kishmar, 183o; T\u016bn, 183s; Bajist\u0101n and Jun\u0101bad, 183x; Dasht-Biy\u0101d and F\u0101ris, 184b; Birjand, 184c; Kh\u016bsf, 184e; S\u0101khis or Shakh\u012bn, 184f; Zirk\u016bh, 184g; Tabas Mas\u012bn\u0101n, 184h; Tabas Kil\u0101ki, 184m; K\u0101y\u012bn, 184p; Kal\u2018ah Darah, 184u; Mum\u012bn\u0101b\u0101d, 184v; Z\u0101vil, 184w; Fr\u016bzk\u016bh, 184x; Ghaznayn, 184y; \u1e6curm\u012bshah, 185b; Maymanah, 185c; Karnayn, 185d.\n\nS\u012bst\u0101n, by the Arabs written Sijist\u0101n, was of old called Nimr\u016bz, meaning \u2018Midday,\u2019 a name said to have been given to the province in regard to its position south of Khur\u0101s\u0101n. Kuhist\u0101n\u2014\u2018the Mountain-land\u2019\u2014was the north-western part of this country, and in older times it was more often included in the Khur\u0101s\u0101n government.\n\nZaranj, the capital, also known as S\u012bst\u0101n city, was a great place in the middle ages. It was completely destroyed by Timur half a century after the time of Mustawfi, and the extensive ruins of the old town, the name of Zaranj having long since been forgotten, lie some miles to the north-east of N\u0101\u1e63ir\u0101b\u0101d (or Na\u1e63rat\u0101b\u0101d), the modern capital of S\u012bst\u0101n, near the hamlets of Pish\u0101var\u0101n and N\u0101d \u2018Ali. The city of Zaranj lay along the bank of the Siy\u0101h-r\u016bd\u2014\u2018the Black Canal\u2019\u2014a branch from the Helmund river. The\n\u0100b-i-Hirmand, as Mustawfi spells the name (L. 216s), rises in the mountains of Gh\u016br, and after passing the fortress of Bust curves round northward to the city of Zaranj, flowing out finally into the Zirrah Lake from the eastward by many mouths and canals. From the north the Zirrah Lake received the water of the \u0100b-i-Farah, the river which passed the town of Farah, and which like the Helmund also rose in the mountains of Gh\u016br, in what is now north-western Afghanistan (L. 216t, 226p).\n\nTurshiz was the chief city of the Kuhist\u0101n province, and near it was the village of Kishmar,\u00b9 famous for the great cypress-trees planted by Zoroaster, as related by Fird\u016bs\u012b in the Sh\u0101h N\u0101mah (Turner-Macan, iv, 1067). Near Turshiz were four famous castles called Kal'ah Bard\u0101rud, Kal'ah Mik\u0101l (or Hayk\u0101l), Muj\u0101hid\u0101b\u0101d, and \u0100tishg\u0101h ('the Fire-temple'). No town called Turshiz exists, but a district now bears this name, and from the Itineraries given by \u0130\u015ftakhri (p. 284) and others Turshiz, anciently called Turthith, or \u1e6curaythith, lay one day's march westward of Kundur. Hence the ruins of the city are probably those seen at Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d, near the village of 'Abdul\u0101b\u0101d; and in any case Turshiz cannot be Sult\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, the modern capital of the Turshiz district, for this lies east of Kundur.\n\nT\u016bn is still one of the chief towns of Kuhist\u0101n, and according to Mustawfi was originally laid out on a Chinese plan, whatever that may signify. Bajist\u0101n [1], of which Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 497) also speaks, lies due north of T\u016bn; it is to be noted, however, that in the Jah\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 326) and many of the Nuzhat MSS. this name is given as Tanjah, but probably in error. Jun\u0101b\u0101d [2], generally called Gun\u0101b\u0101d, and which the Arab geographers write Yun\u0101bidh, lies northeast of T\u016bn; it was famous for its two castles, called Kal'ah Khw\u0101shir and Darj\u0101n (or Darkh\u0101n). In the neighbourhood were the mountains called K\u016bh-i-Gun\u0101b\u0101d and K\u016bh-i-Z\u012bbad, which are said to be mentioned by Fird\u016bs\u012b (L. 206n). The district of Dasht-i-Biy\u0101d lies south of Gun\u0101b\u0101d and\n\n\u00b9 In Kazv\u012bn\u012b (ii, 299) printed Kishm by mistake: but right in Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 278).\neast of T\u016bn; its chief town was F\u0101ris [3], now generally called Kal'ah Kuhnah, or 'the Old Castle.' Birjand [4] lies at some distance to the south-east of T\u016bn, and to the west of Birjand is Kh\u016bsf [5], a name which the Arab geographers write Khawst; the position of S\u0101khis (Sh\u0101h\u012bn, S\u0101h\u012bn, and Shakh\u012bn are manuscript variants) appears to be unknown. Zirk\u016bh\u2014'the Foot-hills'\u2014is the name of a district marked on the map as lying to the eastward of K\u0101y\u012bn; Mustawfi states that it had three towns, namely, Isfadan [6], Istind [7], and Sh\u0101rakhs [8], all of which may still be found on the map.\n\nDuring the middle ages there were two cities called \u1e6cabas, namely, \u1e6cabas Kilak\u012b [9], which in the Arab geographers is given as \u1e6cabas-at-Tamr\u2014'\u1e6cabas of the Date'\u2014and \u1e6cabas Mas\u012bn\u0101n [10], formerly known as \u1e6cabas-al-'Unn\u0101b\u2014'\u1e6cabas of the Jujube-tree.' From the distances given in the Arab Itineraries it would appear that \u1e6cabas Kilak\u012b (or Gilaki) is the place still marked in our maps as \u1e6cabas, which lies on the desert border, and this agrees with what is said of the limits of the Maf\u0101zah, or Great Desert, in the previous chapter. The position of \u1e6cabas Mas\u012bn\u0101n cannot be exactly fixed, but the evidence of Ibn \u1e24aw\u1e33al (p. 335) and the other Itineraries would place it about half-way between T\u016bn and the other (the present) \u1e6cabas, which last is often named \u1e6cabasayn. The city of K\u0101y\u012bn lies east of T\u016bn, and was noted as the central point of Kuhist\u0101n; the Castle of Darah [11] is south-east of Birjand, and Mum\u012bn\u0101b\u0101d is the name of the mountainous district to the east of Birjand.\n\nIn regard to Z\u0101vil, Mustawfi gives this as the name of a town with its surrounding district, and in the previous chapter he has mentioned Z\u0101vil as lying on the north-western border of the great desert. The name does not occur in Y\u0101k\u016bt or any of the earlier Arab geographers, but Monsieur B. de Meynard, in a note to his Dictionnaire de la Perse (p. 35), quoting the author of the Mub\u0101rik Sh\u0101h\u012b, states that Z\u0101vil was a district near Asfuz\u0101r (Sabziv\u0101r of Herat), and that it was watered by eighty streams on which stood water-mills. Fir\u016bzk\u016bh\u2014'Turquoise Mountain'\u2014is\nprobably the ancient capital of Gh\u016br, which will be noticed in the next chapter, the exact position of which, in what is now north-western Afghanistan, is unknown. Ghaznayn, otherwise Ghaznah, needs no comment, but I am unable to identify the place written \u1e6carm\u012bshah (\u1e6car\u012bt, \u1e6carmast, etc., are variants given in the MSS.) ; possibly it is merely a mistake for, and duplicate of, Tursh\u012bz. Maymanah, which the Arab geographers called Yah\u016bdiyah \u2014 'Jew-town' \u2014 lies east of B\u0101l\u0101 Murgh\u0101b, in the north-west of modern Afghanistan; and the city of Karnayn, celebrated as the birthplace of Layth, the founder of the Saffarids, lies in the desert one march to the north of Kh\u0101sh on the river Helmund, according to the distances given by Ibn \u1e24awkal (p. 306).\n\n(To be continued.)\nArt. XIX.\u2014On the Mugdh\u0101cabodhamauktika, and its evidence as to Old Gujar\u0101t\u012b. By G. A. Grierson, C.I.E., I.C.S.\n\nIn the year 1889 the late Mr. H. H. Dhruva published an edition of the Mugdh\u0101cabodhamauktika, which he described as \"a Grammar for Beginners of the Gujerati Language.\" He cannot have given much study to the work, for a perusal of it will show that it is not a Gujar\u0101t\u012b Grammar at all. It is a very elementary Sanskrit Grammar, with the explanations written in an old form of Gujar\u0101t\u012b. The date of the work is A.D. 1394, and all that is known of the author is that he was the pupil of Deva-sundara. His name is not given. As a Sanskrit Grammar the Mugdh\u0101cabodhamauktika is of very small value. It deals more with what we should call syntax than with the formation of words. But, as the explanations are written in the vernacular, these incidentally afford information as to what was the condition of the language of Gujarat between the time of Hema-candra (fl. 1150 A.D.) and the time of Narsingh Mehta (fl. 1450 A.D.), with whom Gujar\u0101t\u012b literature is commonly said to commence. I have therefore examined the text with some minuteness, and lay the results before the Royal Asiatic Society, as providing a valuable connecting link between the Gaurjara Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba of the Prakrit grammarian and modern Gujar\u0101t\u012b. The close connection of this Old Gujar\u0101t\u012b with the former is remarkable; and, though the materials are very incomplete, we are entitled to say that for the first time we have before us an unbroken chain of development between a Prakrit dialect and a modern Indian vernacular.\nPHONETICS.\n\nThe original is carelessly printed. Great laxity is shown in the use of anusv\u0101ra, which is omitted ad libitum. When printed, it usually represents anun\u0101sika. Possibly it sometimes represents anusv\u0101ra. As one cannot distinguish between the two uses of this sign, I have contented myself with uniformly transliterating it by ~. Forms like t\u0101, j\u0101, should perhaps be written ta\u1e41, ja\u1e41, respectively. I have silently corrected the numerous misprints in the use of anusv\u0101ra.\n\nThe letters e and o are no doubt often short, as in Apabhr\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. As the original makes no distinction in the quantity of these vowels, I have perforce left them unmarked.\n\nDr. Konow has drawn my attention to the fact that, in Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, a single Prakrit n remains cerebralized in the modern vernacular, but that a double cerebral nn becomes dentalized to n, thus following the example of Jaina M\u0101har\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri. The same rule obtains in Old Gujar\u0101ti. Thus, Apabhr\u0101\u1e41\u015ba j\u0101nai, Old Guj. j\u0101nai, he knows; but Ap. panna, Old Guj. p\u0101na, a leaf; Ap. annai, Old Guj. anai, and.\n\nThe rule, of course, does not apply to tatsamas like d\u0101na, a gift.\n\nAs in Apabhr\u0101\u1e41\u015ba, a conjunct r is optionally retained (Hc., iv, 398).

They are not the Sanskrit diphthongs, and are usually written as separate letters, thus ai, a\u00fc.

Neut. dharm\u016b sukha-nai k\u0101rani hui, virtue is for (i.e. leads to) happiness; caittu-tanai dhan\u016b gami chai, Caitra\u2019s wealth is in the village.\n\nAccusative.\u2014(a) ritaraga va\u00f1chita dii, the ascetic grants a boon; vata karai, converses (see above); tapa karai, he performs austerities; guru-tanai vacana haai s\u0101bhalaai, I listen to the word of the preceptor; artha puchai, he asks the meaning; hala khedatau, driving the plough (cf. below); bija vaivai, he sows seed; sukha praimai, he obtains happiness; sisya hai s\u0101bhalaai, I hear the disciple; s\u0101stra pathatau, reading the scriptures.\n\n(b) Chaittu katu karai, Chaitra makes a straw mat; sausaru tarai, he passes over existence; guri arthu kahatai, while the preceptor is telling the meaning; kisi khedatau, halu, what is he driving? the plough (cf. above).\n\nInstrumental.\u2014(a) jiva dharm\u016b sausaru tarai, by virtue a living being crosses (the ocean of) existence (see below); kijai kijatau, s\u016btradh\u0101rii, by whom is it being made? by the architect (see below); sisya pathitai hai s\u0101bhalaai, I listen to what is being read by the disciple; \u0113 grantha sukhi patthayai, this book can be read with pleasure; \u015br\u0101vakii deva pujai, the god is worshipped by the votary; gop\u0101lii gac dohitie, while the cows are being milked by Gop\u0101la; caitai gaitai maittu nacai, while (a song) is being sung by Caitra, Maitra dances.\n\n(b) kisi tarai, dharmi, by what does one cross? by virtue; s\u016btradh\u0101rii kijatau prasada, loka dekhai, a person looks on while the palace is being built by the architect.\nDative.\u2014sukha-na\u012b, for bliss; jeha vastu-na\u012b parity\u0101ga s\u016bci\u012b, for what thing abandonment is indicated. Instead of na\u012b, the word k\u0101ra\u1e47i (the locative of k\u0101rana), preceded by nai (the termination of the genitive put into the locative neuter to agree with k\u0101ra\u1e47i), is commonly used. Thus, vivekiu moksa-na\u012b k\u0101ra\u1e47i khapai, the man of discrimination strives after salvation; dharmu sukha-na\u012b k\u0101ra\u1e47i hui, virtue is for (leads to) happiness. After a verb of giving the genitive termination raha\u012b is used to indicate the dative. Thus, jeha-raha\u012b d\u0101na dijai, to whom a gift is given.\n\nIn the following instance the dative is used for the accusative:\u2014i-k\u0101ra-na\u012b bolivai, in saying the letter i.\n\nAblative.\u2014v\u1e5bk\u1e63a-tau p\u0101na pa\u1e0dai, the leaf falls from the tree.

Cf. Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba *t\u0101raa* and *sona\u0101\u012b*. The distinction between masc. and neut. is, however, very doubtful, and possibly both terminations are used indifferently. The plural oblique base is the same as the nominative. In Modern Gujar\u0101t\u012b the forms for both the Nom. and the Obl. base are *t\u0101r\u0101-(o)* and *son\u0101-(o)*, the addition of *o* being optional in each case. The only examples which I can give of the plural are *m\u016blag\u0101 kart\u0101 kriy\u0101 suciya\u012b*, the original subject and action are indicated (here apparently *kart\u0101* and *kriy\u0101* agree with an adjective in the neuter plural, unless the termination is also used for\nthe masculine); \u0101tmanepada-tan\u0101 nava vacana, the nine persons of the \u0101tmanepada; ketal\u0101, how many (apparently masc.), and similar forms.\n\nThe following are examples of the use of some of the cases of the singular:\n\nNominative.\u2014kriy\u0101 karivai ju m\u016bligau hui, su kart\u0101, the originator in doing an action is the subject; t\u0101rau \u016bgiu, the star rose; ih\u0101 sona\u016b suh\u0101ga\u016b vik\u0101i, gold is sold cheap here; \u0101tmanepada-na\u016b pahil\u0101 ek\u016b-ja vacana hui, the third person of the \u0101tmanepada is only in the singular (j = \u015aauraseni jjeva); jeha-raha\u012b kriy\u0101 hetupan\u0101i na hui, the actions of which do not become causality.\n\nAccusative.\u2014s\u016btradh\u0101r\u012b kijata\u016b dehara\u016b loka dekhai, a person looks at a temple being built by the architect.\n\nInstrumental.\u2014kari lei dei ity\u0101di bolivai, by saying \u2018having done,\u2019 \u2018having taken,\u2019 \u2018having given,\u2019 etcetera.\n\nLocative.\u2014ju karai lii dii padhai hui ity\u0101di bolivai, in saying the person who does, takes, gives, reads, becomes, etcetera; kriy\u0101 karivai ju m\u016bligau hui, su kart\u0101 (see Nom.).\n\nOblique base.\u2014varga-tan\u0101 pahil\u0101 ak\u1e63ara parai, after the first letter of a varga.\n\nNo examples of the employment of the other cases are available.\n\nOther Nouns.\n\nOnly sporadic examples of other nouns occur in the grammar. They are the following:\n\nNominative singular.\u2014vivekiu mok\u1e63a-nai k\u0101ra\u1e47i khapai, a man of discrimination strives for final beatitude; karasa\u1e47i hala khedat\u0101u bija v\u0101vai, the cultivator, while driving his plough, sows seed; guri arthu kahatai pram\u0101diu \u016bghai, while the preceptor is telling the meaning, Pram\u0101di (or the lazy one) is drowsy.\n\nAccusative singular.\u2014s\u016btradh\u0101r\u012b kijati v\u0101vi loka dekhai, a person looks at a well being built by the architect.\n\nDative singular.\u2014jeha vastu-na\u012b parity\u0101ga s\u016bci, for what thing abandonment is indicated.\nGenitive singular.\u2014guru-tanau vacana, the word of the preceptor.\n\nGenitive plural.\u2014e bihui-nai yogi, in the sense of these two.\n\nLocative singular.\u2014guri, loc. of guru, see Nom. sing. above.\n\nLocative plural.\u2014gop\u0101l\u012b \u0101ge (gen. sg. g\u0101i-nau) dohitie caittu ariu, Caitra came while the cows were being milked by Gop\u0101la (loc. plur. absolute).\n\nOblique singular.\u2014kart\u0101 (nom. the same) \u0101gali, before the subject.\n\nADJECTIVES.\n\nThe feminine of strong nouns or adjectives in au (neut. a\u016b) ends in \u012b. Thus, puvilau, first; puvili kriy\u0101, the first verb. So kijatau (masc.), kijati (fem.), kijata\u016b (neut.), being done (pres. part. pass.). Adjectives are declined like substantives. Thus, sonau suh\u016bga\u016b (nom. neut.), cheap gold; varga-tan\u0101 trij\u0101 (nom. masc. trijau) ak\u1e63ara-rahi pad\u0101nti, (in the place) of the third letter of a set at the end of a word (here the adjective in the oblique form agrees with a genitive); li\u1e45ga chehil\u0101 (oblique form) \u015babda-tanau hui, the gender (of a dvandva compound) is that of the last word; \u0101ge dohitie, while the cows are being milked (loc. plur. absolute).\n\nThe genitive in tanau or nau is treated exactly like an adjective, and is declined throughout all cases and numbers in agreement with the noun which it qualifies. When, however, the case of the principal noun is formed by adding a suffix to the oblique form, the suffix is not repeated after the genitive, which thus only appears in the oblique form. When a genitive agrees with a noun in the instrumental or locative, it is itself put into the same case. Examples are\u2014\n\nNom. sing. masc.\u2014eha-tanau or eha-nau, of this; any\u0101diku-nau yogu, the sense of \u2018other\u2019 and the like; je kart\u0101-nau athav\u0101 karma-nau adh\u0101ra hui, te adhikaraya, those things which are the receptacle of the subject or of the object are the adhikaraya; teha trij\u0101 ak\u1e63ara parai hak\u0101ra-rahi trij\u0101-nau sagau cauthau hui, after these (above-mentioned) third\nletters (of the vargas) the fourth letter (of the varga) is added (sagata) to the third one (in the place) of the letter ha.\n\nNom. sing. fem.\u2014kart\u0101-n\u012b apek\u1e63\u0101 hui, there is a reference to subject.\n\nNom. sing. neut.\u2014caittu-tan\u0101\u016b dhan\u016b, the wealth of Caitra; kauna-tan\u0101\u016b dhan\u016b, whose wealth? guru-tan\u0101\u016b vacana, the word of the preceptor; \u0101pan\u0101 karma-n\u0101\u016b vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e47a, a qualifier of its own object; bh\u0101va-n\u0101\u016b (sic) vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e47u (sic), a qualifier of impersonality, an impersonal verbal adjective.\n\nLoc. sing.\u2014teha-nai yogi, in the sense of that; jeha-nai k\u0101ra\u1e47i, for whose sake; vivekiu mok\u1e63a-nai k\u0101ra\u1e47i khapai, a man of discrimination strives for final beatitude; dharmu sukha-nai k\u0101ra\u1e47i hui, virtue is for happiness; ktv\u0101-nai karmi dvit\u012bya, in the object of (a word ending in) the suffix ktv\u0101 there is the accusative case; \u015babda-nai chehi, at the end of a word; karasa\u1e47\u016b-nai vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e47i, in the adjective qualifying the word karasa\u1e47i.\n\nObl. form sing.\u2014pratyaya-n\u0101 kart\u0101 \u0101gali, before the subject of a suffix (here kart\u0101 is in the oblique form, which is the same as the nominative, being governed by \u0101gali); varga-tan\u0101 triy\u0101 ak\u1e63ara-rah\u012b, (in the place) of the third letter of a varga; varga-tan\u0101 pahil\u0101 ak\u1e63ara para\u012b, after the first letter of a varga.\n\nNom. plur.\u2014\u0101tmanepada-tan\u0101 nava vacana, the nine persons of the \u0101tmanepada.\n\nPRONOUNS.\n\nThe information regarding the personal pronouns is not complete. The pronoun of the first person is ha\u016b, I. So Ap.; Mod. Guj. hu\u016b. No instance of the pronoun of the second person occurs. It was probably tuh\u016b, as in Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba. In Mod. Guj. it is tu\u016b. No other cases of either of these pronouns occur.\n\nInstead of the genitive we have possessive pronouns, which are adjectives. These are m\u0101harau (Ap. m\u0101harau, Mod. Guj. m\u0101ro), my; amh\u0101rau (Ap. amh\u0101rau, Mod. Guj.\nam\u0101ro), our; t\u0101harau (Ap. tuh\u0101rau, Mod. Guj. t\u0101ro), thy; tam\u0101rau (Ap. tumh\u0101rau, Mod. Guj. tam\u0101ro), your.\n\n'He,' 'that' is su, neut. t\u0101. No instance of the feminine has been noted. The corresponding forms in Ap. are su (m.), sa (f.), ta\u1e41 (n.). In Mod. Guj. we have te (com. gen.). The nom. plural is te (? com. gen.). In Ap. it is te (m.), t\u0101o (f.), t\u0101i (n.). Mod. Guj. has te(-o) (com. gen.). Examples of these pronouns are\u2014\n\nGuru-tan\u0101\u016b vacana h\u0101\u016b s\u0101bhala\u016b, I listen to the word of the preceptor.\n\nJu tarai su kart\u0101, he who crosses (the ocean of existence) is the subject (of the sentence); so ju dekhai su kart\u0101; j\u0101 kijai t\u0101 karma, that which is done is the object (of the sentence); \u015b\u012bsya \u015b\u0101stra pa\u1e0dhi artha p\u016bchhai; ju p\u016bchhai su kart\u0101, tiha pratham\u0101; kis\u016b p\u016bchhai, artha; j\u0101 p\u016bchhai, t\u0101 karma, tiha dvitiy\u0101, the disciple having read the holy book asks the meaning; he who asks is the subject and therefore in the nominative case. What is asked? the meaning. That which is asked is the object and therefore in the accusative case; je linga vibhakti vacana h\u016b\u012b, te satr pratyaya parai \u0101\u1e47\u016b, the signs of gender, case, and number are put after the suffix satr.\n\n'This' is e, which is both masc. and neut., sing. and plur. In Ap. the forms are eho (m.), eha (f.), ehu (n.), sing.; ei (com. gen.), plur. In Mod. Guj. it is e for all genders and both numbers. There is a substantival oblique form, eha, for both sing. and plur. Examples are\u2014\n\nE grantha sukhi\u012b path\u0101yai, this book can be read with pleasure; e bihui-nai yogi, in the sense of these two; eha-nau, of this; eha-raha\u012b, of this. From this oblique form, we may assume that the oblique form of su is teha.\n\nThe relative pronoun is ju, neut. j\u0101. The feminine has not been noted. The corresponding Ap. forms are ju, ja, jam, Mod. Guj. je (com. gen.). There is also an instrumental j\u012bna\u012b or j\u012bn\u0101 (this latter may possibly be an accusative), both used as substantives. The nom. plur. is je, with a neuter substantive jih\u0101\u012b. The substantival oblique form, both singular and plural, is jeha. Examples are\u2014\nJu tarai; j\u0101 p\u016bchai; as given above under su; j\u012bn\u0101 kar\u012b karai lii dii ity\u0101di yukt\u0101 jih\u0101i kah\u0101i, anai j\u012bn\u0101 kar\u012b kart\u0101 kriy\u0101 s\u0101dhai, t\u0101 karaya, the instrument is those things which are said (i.e. indicated) by the expression \u2018having done (by) what, he does, takes, or gives,\u2019 and \u2018having done (by) what, the subject accomplishes an action\u2019; j\u012bn\u0101i m\u016blag\u0101 kart\u0101 kriy\u0101 suciy\u0101i, by which the original subject and action are indicated. The dative sing. is jeha-nai or jeha-nai k\u0101rani; the abl. jeha-tau, -h\u016btau, -thau, -thakau; jeha-si\u016b ity\u0101di bolivai sah\u0101di yogi tritiy\u0101 hui, in saying \u2018with whom\u2019 and the like, in the sense of \u2018with\u2019 and the like, the third case is used. The genitive is jeha-nau or jeha-raha\u012b, with a loc. of gen. jeha-nai, and an obl. gen. jeha-n\u0101. For the nom. plur. we have je li\u1e45ga vibhakti vacana hui as given under su.\n\nThe interrogative pronoun for masc. and fem. is ka\u1e47\u1e47a or ku\u1e47\u1e47a. Its instrumental singular is ki\u1e47\u1e47ai or ka\u1e47\u1e47ai, its abl. ka\u1e47\u1e47a-tau, its gen. kiha-tanau, and its obl. base ka\u1e47\u1e47a or ki\u1e47\u1e47a. Compare Ap. kava\u1e47u, fem. kavana, and Mod. Guj. ko\u1e47, obl. ko\u1e47\u0101. Examples are\u2014\n\nKa\u1e47\u1e47a tarai, who passes over? candra \u016bgai; ku\u1e47\u1e47a \u016bgai, candra, the moon rises. Who rises? The moon; ki\u1e47\u1e47ai kijatau, by whom is (the palace) being made? g\u0101e ka\u1e47\u1e47ai dohi\u1e6die, while the cows are being milked by whom? vrk\u1e63a-tau p\u0101\u1e47a pa\u1e0dai; ka\u1e47\u1e47a-tau pa\u1e0dai, the leaf falls from the tree. From what does it fall? ki\u1e47\u1e47ai-si\u016b, with whom?\n\nThe neuter interrogative pronoun is kisa\u016b, kisu\u012b, or kisi\u016b; instr. kisi\u016b; dat. kis\u0101-nai k\u0101rani or ka\u1e47\u1e47a-nai k\u0101\u02be; abl. ka\u1e47\u1e47a-tau; gen. ka\u1e47\u1e47a-tanau; loc. kisi\u0101i; loc. plur. fem. (see example below) kisi\u0113. The forms with ka\u1e47\u1e47a refer to nouns having grammatically a masculine gender. Compare Ap. kiin, instr. ki\u1e47\u0101, abl. kisa, gen. kiss\u0101. Mod. Guj. has \u015b\u016b. Examples of this pronoun are\u2014\n\nKisu\u012b p\u016bchai, what does he ask? kisu\u012b khe\u1e0datau, halu, what does he drive? the plough; kisa\u016b dekhai, pras\u0101da, what is he looking at? the palace; guri arthu kahatai, kisi\u016b kahatai, while the preceptor is telling the meaning. What is he telling? kisi\u016b tarai, dharm\u012b, by what does he cross; by\nvirtue; ka\u1e47a-nai k\u0101ra\u1e47i, mok\u1e63a-na\u012b, for the sake of what? for beatitude; kis\u0101-nai k\u0101ra\u1e47i dharmu hui, sukha-na\u012b, for what (i.e. tending to what) is virtue? for happiness; ka\u1e47a-tau pa\u1e0dai, v\u1e5bk\u1e63a-tau, from what does it fall? from the tree; kisai h\u016btai, g\u0101itai, while what is going on? while singing is going on (loc. abs.); gop\u0101l\u012b g\u0101e dohi\u1e6die caittu aviu; kisai h\u016btai, g\u0101e; g\u0101e kisie, dohi\u1e6die, while the cows were being milked by Gop\u0101la, Caitra came; while what were being dealt with? cows; while what was being done to the cows (lit. while the cows were what, loc. plur. fem. abs.)? while they were being milked.\n\nThe reflexive pronoun occurs only in the genitive. Thus, \u0101pa\u1e47i (fem. of -\u1e47au) kriy\u0101, its own action; \u0101pa\u1e47\u0101 karma-nau, of its own object. Ap. has appanau. Mod. Guj. has \u0101pa\u1e47o, but it is used in the meaning of 'our' including the person addressed.\n\nThe only instance of an indefinite pronoun which I have noted is amukau, a certain person.\n\nVERBS.\n\nConjugation is very superficially dealt with in the Mugdh\u0101vabodhamauktika. No attempt is made to explain the formations of the various tenses. Only the personal terminations are given in Sanskrit, and that without any translation into the writer's vernacular. Participles and the like are treated more fully. From what is given we can gather the following concerning Old Gujar\u0101ti.\n\nPresent tense.\u2014The only instance of the first person singular is s\u0101bhala\u016b, I hear. The only other persons which occur are the third persons singular and plural. The termination of the third person singular is ai, or, after a vowel, i. That of the third person plural is \u0101i, or, after a vowel, \u012b. There are several examples of the third singular. Thus\u2014\n(a) Consonantal roots.\n\n\u0101cai, he comes. n\u0101cai, he dances.\n\u016bghai, she is drowsy. pa\u1e0dhai, it falls.\n\u016bgai, (the moon) rises. pa\u1e0dhai, he reads.\nkarai, he does. p\u016bchai, he asks.\nkhapai, he strives. pr\u0101mai, he obtains.\nchai, it is. vasai, he dwells.\nj\u0101nai, he knows. v\u0101vai, he sows.\ntarai, he passes over. sakai, he can.\ndekhai, he sees.\n\n(b) Vocalic roots.\n\nhui, he becomes. dii, he gives.\nlii, he takes.\n\nThe following are examples of the third person plural:\nn\u0101ca\u0169, they dance; hu\u0169, they become.\n\nThe following table compares the forms of Old Guj. with Ap. and Mod. Guj.:\n\n| Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba | Old Gujar\u0101t\u012b | Modern Gujar\u0101t\u012b | English |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|---------|\n| naccau     | n\u0101ca\u0169        | n\u0101ce           | I dance |\n| naccai     | n\u0101cai        | n\u0101ce           | he dances |\n| naccahi    | n\u0101ca\u0129        | n\u0101ce           | they dance |\n\nFuture tense.\u2014No example of the future occurs. We should expect a form such as n\u0101cisa\u0169, corresponding to the Mod. Guj. n\u0101cis and the Ap. naccisa\u0169. The noun of agency in -anah\u0101ra can be used as an immediate future, as in ha\u0169 k\u0101li amuka\u0169 karanah\u0101ra, I shall do such and such a thing to-morrow.\n\nPast tense.\u2014This is formed as in all modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars from the past participle passive. All three constructions, the active, the personal passive, and the impersonal passive are used. Thus, caittu aviu, Caitra is\ncome; \u015br\u0101vak\u016b deva p\u016bj\u012bu, the god was worshipped by the votary, i.e. the votary worshipped the god; \u015br\u0101vak\u016b deva p\u016bj\u012bu, by the votary, with reference to the god, worship was done, i.e. the votary worshipped the god.\n\nPast conditional.\u2014This is formed with the present participle, as in jai hai pa\u1e0dhata tau ubhal\u0101 h\u016bta, if I had read I should have (?) understood. So also in Jaina Prakrit.\n\nThe passive voice is formed by adding iy to consonantal roots, and iy to vocalic ones. With the terminations ai and \u0101i of the third person, iyai can become ii, and iyai ii. The Ap. termination of the passive is iyai, or in \u015aauraseni Ap. ia. This form of the passive is not used in modern standard Gujar\u0101t\u012b. Examples are\u2014\n\n(a) Consonantal roots.\n\nuccariyai, it is pronounced.\nkahiyai, it is said.\nkahii, it is said.\ntarii, it is passed over.\npathii (not padhi), it is read.\nboliyai, it is said.\nsuciyai, it is indicated.\nsucii, it is indicated.\n\u0101\u1e47ii, they are brought.\nsuciyai, they are indicated.\n\n(b) Vocalic roots.\n\ndiyai, it is given.\nlijai, it is taken.\nkijai, it is done.\n\nNote that the root kar, do, is treated irregularly as if it were vocalic (Pr. kijai).\n\nA potential passive is formed by adding \u0101 or \u0101y to the root. So also in Mod. Guj. Examples are\u2014\n\npath\u0101yai (not padh\u0101yai), it can be read.\nbol\u0101yai, it can be said, it is called.\nvik\u0101i, it can be sold.\nkah\u0101i, they can be said.\nPresent participle.\u2014This is formed by adding *atu* (weak form) or *atau* (strong form). I have only noted the weak form in the neuter (cf. the genitive termination *n\u016b* on p. 545). Thus, masc. *karatau*, fem. *karati*, neut. *karat\u016b* or *karata\u016b*, doing. So in the passive, *kijatau*, -*ti*, -*ta\u016b*, being done. These are declined like adjectives, and locatives absolute are common. Examples are\u2014\n\n(a) **Active.**\n\n- *karatau*, doing.\n- *kahatau*, saying. Loc. abs. *kahatai*.\n- *khedatau*, driving (a plough).\n- *gha\u1e6ditau*, happening.\n- *pa\u1e6dhatau*, reading.\n- *letau*, taking.\n- *varasatau*, raining. Loc. abs. *varasatai*.\n- *hutau* or *h\u016btau*, becoming. Loc. abs. *hutai* or *h\u016btai*.\n\n(b) **Passive.**\n\n- *kijatau*, being done.\n- *g\u0101itau*, being sung. Loc. abs. *g\u0101itai*.\n- *dohitau*, being milked. Loc. plur. fem. abs. *dohitie*.\n- *pa\u1e6dhitau*, being read.\n- *lijatau*, being taken.\n\nExamples of the use of these participles are\u2014\n\n*Meghi varasatai mora n\u0101cai*, while the clouds rain the peacocks dance; *guri arthu kahatai pram\u0101diu \u016bghai*, while the preceptor is telling the meaning, Pram\u0101di is drowsy; *gop\u0101lii g\u0101e dohitie caittu aviu*, while the cows were being milked by Gop\u0101la, Caitra came; *\u015bi\u1e63ya \u015b\u0101stra pa\u1e6dhatau hau s\u0101bhala\u016b*, I listen to the disciple reading the holy book; *\u015bi\u1e63yi \u015b\u0101stra pa\u1e6dhita\u016b hau s\u0101bhala\u016b*, I listen to the holy book being read by the disciple; *caitt\u012b g\u0101itai maittu n\u0101cai*, Maitra dances while it is being sung (impersonal) by Caitra, i.e. while Caitra sings.\n\nPast participle passive.\u2014This usually ends in *iu*, as in Ap. The examples found are *aviu*, come; *giu*, went; *p\u016bji\u016b*\n(neut.), worshipped; \u00fathiu, risen; j\u00e1gia, awakened. The Sanskrit supta(ka) becomes, through the Ap. suittu, s\u00e1ttu. No examples occur of those past participles which are usually irregular in Mod. Guj. In the last-named language the participle usually ends in yo, as in \u00fathyo, risen.\n\nThe conjunctive participle ends in i as in Mod. Guj., corresponding to the Ap. -i or -iu. Examples are kwi, having done; lei, having taken; d\u00ebi, having given; pa\u00f0hi, having read. The verbs 'to know' and 'to be able' are construed with this participle, as in kari j\u00e4nai, he knows how to do; lei sakai, he can take. So, the Ap. iu is by origin an infinitive.\n\nVerbal noun.\u2014This ends in va\u00fc after consonantal and va\u00fc after vocalic roots. Thus, kariva\u00fc, the act of doing; leva\u00fc, the act of taking. The oblique forms, such as karived, levad, are used as infinitives of purpose in sentences such as \"the potter brings earth to make a pot\" (in the original the example is only given in Sanskrit). The locative and instrumental are also very common.\n\nThe noun of agency is formed by adding anah\u00e4ra to consonantal and nah\u00e4ra to vocalic roots. Thus, karana\u00f1ah\u00e4ra, a doer; lenah\u00e4ra, a taker. The Mod. Guj. forms would be karan\u00e4r, len\u00e4r.\n\nPOSTPOSITIONS.\n\nThe following postpositions have been noted. They all govern nouns in the oblique form.\n\nsi\u00fc, with.\nmahi, in.\n\u00e1gali, before.\np\u00e1chali, behind.\nparai or pari, after.\n\nIt will be seen that the last four are nouns in the locative.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS PRONOMINAL FORMS.\n\nih\u00e3 or ih\u00e3, here; tih\u00e3, there; jihi\u00e3, where; kihi\u00e3, where? hava\u1e0da, now; tat\u00e3ra\u00ef, then; kav\u00e3ra\u00ef, when? aneri-va\u00efra, at another time; eka-va\u00efra, once; sadaivai, always.\nim, in this manner; tim, in that manner; jim, how; kim, how?\nisiu or isau, like this; tisiu, like that; jisiu, like what; kisiu, like what?\netalau, this much; tetalau, jetalau, ketalau.\netal\u0101 (plural), this many; tetal\u0101, jetal\u0101, ketal\u0101.\neva\u1e0dau, this big; tera\u1e0dau, jeva\u1e0dau, keva\u1e0dau.\nathau, facing in this direction; tethau, jethau, kethau.\n\nThe following is a list of words not mentioned in the preceding pages.\n\naiya, (?) thus.\naji, even to-day, still, yet.\nanai-k\u0101i, what else?\nanareu (? aneriu), adj., like another, of another kind.\nanera\u012b disi, on another day (both words in loc.).\nanera\u012b-tanau, belonging to another.\nahuna, during the present year.\nahunoka, belonging to the present year.\n\u0101g\u012blu, adj., before, in front.\naju, to-day.\n\u0101j\u016bnu, of to-day, modern.\navatai k\u0101li, to-morrow (both words in loc.).\nih\u0101-tanau, belonging to here.\nupari, above.\nurahau, near, on this side.\n\u016bpilu, adj., upper.\n\u016byatra, ascent (udy\u0101tr\u0101).\nek\u016b-ja, one only.\noliu (cf. pailau), facing towards one.\nkanhai, near.\nk\u0101i, somewhat (kimapi).\nk\u0101li, to-morrow, yesterday.

XX.\u2014A Comparative Vocabulary of Malayan Dialects.\n\nBy C. Otto Blagden.\n\nI would beg to be allowed to correct the somewhat misleading description of MS. No. 29 of the Maxwell Bequest of Malay Books which was published in my provisional list of them printed in Part I of the Society's Journal for 1899. I was misled by the first few pages of the book, which consist of a rather elaborate list of languages, into supposing that the MS. contained vocabularies of all of them: having identified a few, I assumed, somewhat too hastily, that the rest were also represented there.\n\nOn looking over the book more carefully than was possible in the short time available when the provisional list was compiled, I find that it is indeed a comparative vocabulary, but does not include all that I had imagined, being, in fact, confined to five languages (or dialects) and Malay.\n\nAmong these five there are, in the first place, two dialects spoken by the S\u0113mangs (Negritos) of the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, and in the MS. called respectively S\u0113mang Bukit (\u0633\u0650\u0645\u064e\u06a0 \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a\u062a), that is, S\u0113mang of the Hills (or rather, I think, of a particular hill, the name of which is given but which I cannot quite make out or identify: it looks like \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0633\u0631 or \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0633\u0631), and S\u0113mang Paya (\u0633\u0650\u0645\u064e\u06a0 \u0641\u0627\u064a), S\u0113mang of the Swamps or Low Country of \u0627\u0648\u0648\u0644 \u0643\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646 (Ulu K\u0113rian, I think, is meant).\n\nAs to these I need say nothing, except that I can identify them as genuine specimens of what they purport to be, having compared them with other specimens of the dialects of neighbouring tribes, which have been collected from time\nto time by other persons; and, further, that I am on the look out for more material of that sort, and shall be glad to hear about it from anyone who possesses it.\n\nThe remaining three languages are in the MS. called\u2014\n\n1. \u0645\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0647 or \u0645\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0647 (M\u0101kuah or M\u0101kuat?).\n2. \u062a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648 or \u062a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648 (Toleho (Tulihu?) or Ambun Toleho: the Amboyna dialect of Toleho?).\n3. \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0627 or \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0627 (Mandura; properly Madura), further stated to have been obtained from one S\u0113rang Yahia (\u0633\u0631\u063a \u064a\u062d\u064a\u064a\u0627), a native of Kampong Melaja (\u0643\u0645\u0641\u0648\u062c \u0645\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0627) in \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0627.\n\nThis last appears, from the form of certain words, to be Madurese, the language of the island of Madura and the eastern end of Java: the \u0645\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0647 is rather a mystery and I have suspicions as to its genuineness, but in some words it seems to show affinity with certain languages of the eastern half of the Indian Archipelago, while the \u062a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648 is clearly somewhat closely allied to the Moluccan dialects of which specimens are given in Wallace's \"Malay Archipelago.\" I am unable, however, to localize \u0645\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0647 and \u062a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648 definitely, and do not remember to have come across their names anywhere.\n\nI append a short list of test words extracted from the MS., which will, I imagine, enable some of your readers to identify them. There are sure to be several Dutch scholars who would be able to recognize them at a glance.\n\nI have added the English equivalents of the Malay words, but, apart from that, I reproduce all the words as I find them in the MS. I do not attempt to transliterate them, because of the inherent uncertainty with regard to the vowels which the Arabic alphabet involves.\n| PAGE OF MS. | MALAY. | \u0645\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0647 |

there would be about 6,000 words (or combinations of words) of each of the five languages in question and Malay.\n\nThe \u062a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648 dialect runs through the book from about the beginning nearly to the end, and is a very full vocabulary; the \u0645\u06a9\u0648\u0627\u0647 runs through two-thirds of the book, and is also pretty full, so far as it goes; while the \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0645 begins on p. 24 and goes on to p. 136, but is much less complete than the two preceding; and the \u0633\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06af dialects begin about the beginning, but are rather scrappy in places, and leave off about the middle of the book. There are many gaps in all the lists (except the Malay) and numberless repetitions.\nThe Malay list gives a good many synonyms, some of which are probably local or dialectic words; it might be worth the while of compilers of Malay dictionaries to look through it, but the spelling is rather unconventional.\n\nThe book is rather cleverly arranged according to subjects, beginning with abstract ideas of quality and the like and going on to material things grouped under such headings as 'earth,' 'water,' 'sky,' 'vegetables,' 'trees,' 'animals,' 'man,' etc., the specific terms being classified under the appropriate generic heads.\n\nIt is written throughout in the Arabic character\u2014the Malay list carefully and neatly (though without strict regard to spelling), the rest (probably by several hands) badly; the S\u0113mang dialects mostly in pencil, the others in ink. There is a table of contents at the beginning.\n\nIt was apparently the property of a Malay of Perak or K\u0113dah (for the K\u0113rian is the boundary stream between these states), and is well bound in a native dark red leather binding, stamped with a particularly good design. To the extent of about two-thirds, the book is made up of sheets of rough white paper, bearing on one half of the sheet the watermark \"Berdo Ghigliottj\" [sic] under a design or trademark consisting of a Latin cross within a pear-shaped ornamental border, and on the other half \"Varennia 1842\" under a star of eight rays. Then follow some pages of white paper, smoother than the preceding, covered with a watermark of small wavy lines but no letters or figures. The rest is of blue paper, bearing on one half of the sheet a figure of Britannia within an oval border, which is surmounted by a royal crown, and on the other half \"W Lewis 1850.\"\n\nI conjecture that the vocabularies were compiled some time between 1850 and 1875. The point is not without interest, as the S\u0113mang dialects of the peninsula are rapidly becoming extinct, and it is rather a piece of good fortune that these two fairly long vocabularies have been preserved, though they are, unfortunately, very full of Malay loan-words, blunders, and ambiguities.\nWhether the and vocabularies (which are, no doubt, equally full of mistakes) would be of any value to philologists I cannot say, for I do not know what other records (if any) of these two dialects may exist. For the study of Madurese there is, I believe, ample material elsewhere.\nART. XXI.\u2014Account of a rare, if not unique, manuscript History of the Seljuqs contained in the Schefer Collection lately acquired by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris, and now described by Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn the pages of this Journal I have repeatedly had occasion to insist, especially in my notice of M. Blochet's most useful Catalogue (J.R.A.S. for 1901, pp. 331\u20133), on the unique value of the magnificent collection of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish MSS. formed by the late M. Charles Schefer, and now belonging to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. During a fortnight spent in Paris in the Easter vacation of 1901, I was able to examine more closely some of the most interesting MSS. comprised in this collection, and in particular the MS. which forms the subject of this notice, which is remarkable alike for its age (it is dated the beginning of Ramad\u00e1n, A.H. 635 = April, A.D. 1238); its fine, clear, careful script; the interest and authority of its contents; and the fact that it is, so far as I have been able to ascertain, unique.\n\nThe importance of a careful study of the original materials for the history of the Selj\u00faq period, so far as these are still extant and accessible, has been so admirably expressed by Houtsma in the preface (pp. vi\u2013viii) to the first of the three texts (the History of the Seljuqs of Kirm\u00e1n, by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm) which he published in his Recueil de Textes relatifs \u00e0 l'histoire des Seldjoucides, that I need say nothing more on this head, save that in citing the Arabic text of the Histoire des Seldjoucides de l'Ir\u0101q par al-Bond\u0101rt d'apr\u00e8s Im\u0101d ad-d\u012bn al-K\u0101tib al-\u012asfah\u0101n\u012b (Leyden, 1889), which forms the second volume of this Recueil, and to which I shall have frequent occasion to refer in the course of the following pages, I shall, for brevity's sake, speak of it simply as \"Bond\u0101ri.\"\nThe publication of texts of the most important original historical works is, without doubt, as Houtma insists (loc. cit., p. vi), what is most required for the proper elucidation of Persian history, for at present the actual material of study is deficient; but in the meanwhile much, I think, may be done to clear the ground, and to determine what most deserves publication, by careful, though greatly condensed, abstracts of rare manuscript histories which have not yet attracted the general attention of Orientalists. Months are required to copy and collate the text of a large manuscript, and years may then pass ere it finally appears in type, even when the difficulty of finding a publisher for books necessarily so unremunerative has been overcome; but a pretty full abstract of its contents may, with diligence, be made in two or three weeks, and published in some fifty or sixty pages of our Journal. Thus at least are the still unexplored realms of Eastern literature outlined for our successors, as were regions now explored surveyed for us by the pioneers of a past generation in those admirable Notices et Extraits des manuscrits de la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, which must ever stand as our models for work of this class.\n\nTo come now to our manuscript, a large volume of 179 leaves, formerly No. 11 of M. Schefer's collection, now No. 1,314 of the Suppl\u00e9ment persan of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale.

'Al\u00ed b. Sulaym\u00e1n b. Mu\u1e25ammad b. Ahmad b. al-Husayn b. Himmat (?) ar-R\u00e1wand\u00ed.\" It was composed (f. 27b) in A.H. 599 (= A.D. 1202\u20133), and dedicated to Abu'l-Fath Kay-Khusraw b. Qilij Arsl\u00e1n b. Mas'\u00fad\nb. Qilij Arsl\u00e1n b. Sulaym\u00e1n b. Gh\u00e1zi b. Qutalmish (so printed on f. 41b). In brief, it may be described as a history of the Selj\u00faqs from the beginning of the dynasty to the author's own time (A.H. 418\u2013594 = A.D. 1027\u20131197). It therefore deals at first-hand (for hardly anywhere does the author appear to derive his information from books, but always from state archives or oral tradition) with 170 years of one of the most important periods of Persian history. Its extent, according to my computation, is something over 100,000 words; and it includes at the end (ff. 157a\u2013179a) sundry rather irrelevant, but interesting sections on the Courtier's Accomplishments (\u0622\u062f\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u062f\u0645\u062a), including the different forms of chess; the ethics of wine-drinking; various sports, notably riding and archery; the principles of writing, calligraphy, and the keeping of state accounts, and other like matters.\n\nABSTRACT.\n\nThe usual doxology opens on f. 1b with a Persian mathnawi poem of fourteen couplets beginning:\n\n\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0631\u060c \u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u060c\n\nand continues in mixed prose and verse, the latter including nine couplets of a mathnawi poem beginning:\n\n\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0622\u063a\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u0630\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u060c\n\nand six couplets of another beginning:\n\n\u0628\u06cc \u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0648 \u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0645\u0633\u062a \u062c\u0648\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0647\u060c \u062d\u0627\u062c\u062a \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0627 \u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0645\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0648\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0647\u060c\n\nThis doxology is followed (f. 3a) by a section in praise of the Prophet, entitled:\n\n\u0645\u062f\u062d \u0627\u0646\u0628\u0627 \u0648 \u0633\u0646\u0627\u064a\u0634 \u067e\u06cc\u063a\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u06cc \u0635\u0644\u0639\u0645\u060c\n\n---\n\n1 Or Kay-Khusraw I, one of the Selj\u00faqs of R\u00fam. See Lane's Mohammadan Dynasties, p. 155, and the genealogical table facing p. 152. Lane's statement of the duration of his reign (A.H. 588\u2013597) hardly agrees with the date here given. I follow the MS. throughout, but probably (with Lane) we should read \"Sulaym\u00e1n b.

'Umar's praise is celebrated in a poem beginning:\n\n\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631 \u0646\u0647\u0627\u062f\u060c\n\u0645\u062a\u062a \u0628\u06cc \u062d\u062f \u0648 \u0639\u062f \u0628\u0631 \u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u063a\u0645\u0631 \u0646\u0647\u0627\u0646\u060c\n\n\u00b9 In a tradition of Ab\u00fa Dhar cited in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Guz\u012bda (composed in A.H. 730 = A.D. 1330) by \u1e24amdu'll\u00e1h Mustawfi of Qazw\u00edn) we find it stated that the total number of Prophets was 124,000, of whom 313 were 'Apostles' (\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644), as opposed to mere 'Preachers' or 'Warners' (\u0645\u0646\u0630\u0631).

These panegyrics on the Four Orthodox Caliphs are succeeded by encomiums on the following leading lights of Isl\u00e1m: Ab\u00fa \u1e24an\u00edf\u00e1, Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed, the Q\u00e1d\u00ed Ab\u00fa Y\u00fasuf, Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24asan ash-Shayb\u00e1n\u00ed, Sufy\u00e1n ath-Thawr\u00ed, M\u00e1l\u00edk and A\u1e25mad b. Hanbal, 'Abdu'll\u00e1h b. Mas'\u00fad, 'Alqama, an-Nakha'\u00ed, al-\u1e24amm\u00e1d, and Mu\u1e25ammad b. Idr\u00eds, especially the first of these, concerning whom several anecdotes are related. Incidentally (f. 8a) the author makes mention of his maternal grandfather, Mu\u1e25ammad b. 'Al\u00ed b. A\u1e25mad ar-R\u00e1wand\u00ed, styled by him\u2014\n\nas handing down from the Im\u00e1m Aqda'l-Qud\u00e1t Dhah\u00edru'd-D\u00edn of Astar\u00e1b\u00e1d a tradition that on one occasion when Ab\u00fa \u1e24an\u00edf\u00e1 prayed for the safe endurance of his doctrine he was answered by a h\u0101t\u00edf, or Voice from the Unseen: \"The truth hast thou uttered: thy doctrine shall not wane so long as the sword abides in the hands of the Turks\"\u2014\n\nThis leads, by a natural transition, to a panegyric on the Turks, especially the Selj\u00faqs, as the champions of orthodoxy, and an exultant boast that \"in Arabia, Persia, R\u00fam (Turkey in Asia), and Russia the sword is indeed in their hands.\" But though the author declares that \"whosoever speaks ill of Ab\u00fa \u1e24an\u00edf\u00e1 or ash-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed is an infidel,\" it is clear that he prefers the former, since he praises Sult\u00e1n Sinjar because he would suffer only \u1e24anafites to hold office, and relates that when the great minister Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk gave the Masjid-i-j\u00e1mi', or Great Mosque, of Isfah\u00e1n to the Sh\u00e1fi'ites, such riots ensued that Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad sent an army to scatter the insurgents (many of whom he beheaded) and to restore the mosque to the \u1e24anafites. Mention is also made of a similar occurrence at Hamadh\u00e1n. This general\npraise of the Selj\u00faqs is followed by a wordy and bombastic panegyric, in mixed prose and verse, on the author's patron, the king Abu'l-Fath Kay-Khusraw b. 'Al\u00e1'u'd-Dawla 'Izzu'd-D\u00edn Qilij Arsl\u00e1n b. Mas'\u00fad b. Qilij Aral\u00e1n b. Sulaym\u00e1n b. (sic: cf. p. 569 supra, n. 1 ad calc.) Gh\u00e1zi b. Qutlamish b. Isr\u00e1'il b.

But latterly, the author complains (f. 14a), all this is changed: \"heretic myrmidons\" (\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062f \u062f\u06cc\u0646) abound, and hence the present distress and heavy taxation.\u00b9 These heretics hail for the most part from the\n\n\u00b9 The connection is not obvious, but we are reminded of a feature in the well-known story of the quarrel between the Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk and Hasan-i-\u1e62abb\u00e1h, the latter having excited the King's cupidity by declaring himself able to increase\ntowns of Qum, K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, \u00c1ba, Ray, and Far\u00e1h\u00e1n, and gain office by promising the king an increased revenue (\u062a\u0648\u0641\u06cc\u0631), \u201cunder which expression,\u201d says the author, \u201cthey cloak their exactions.\u201d Against such he warns his patron:\n\n\u0632 \u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0630\u06af\u0647\u0631 \u0648 \u062c\u0641\u062a \u0628\u062f\u060c \u062a\u0628\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u062f\u0647\u06cc\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u062f\n\nThese men, who are set in authority over true believers, are \u201cunbelieving captains, whose blood, according to the dictates of scripture, is lawful\u201d:\n\n\u0633\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0641\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0633\u062a\n\nThey do all manner of evil; build wine-shops; and openly practise every kind of immorality (\u0628\u063a\u0627\u0634 \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0637\u0647 \u0648 \u0632\u0646\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u062f).

The Sult\u00e1n employed his newly acquired accomplishment in transcribing the Qur\u2019\u00e1n, and 100 Maghrib\u00ed d\u00edn\u00e1rs were expended in gilding and illuminating each portion, or juz\u2019, as it was finished. Part of this volume was in the possession of \u2018Al\u00e1\u2019u\u2019d-D\u00edn, lord of Mar\u00e1gha, and part in that of \u1e32aykhusru, lord of Akhl\u00e1t and others. The author was one of those charged with the gilding and illumination of it, and was thus brought under the notice of the king, a detailed history of whose great deeds and achievements he purposes to write, should he be spared:\u2014\nThis present work, however, is a mere compendium, for a full account of the feats of Sult\u00e1n Tughril, At\u00e1bek Mu\u1e25ammad, and Qizil Arsl\u00e1n would exceed the limits which he has set himself (f. 20a).

The author boasts of his many distinguished pupils, princes, governors, and scholars, who, he declares, \"gloried in having studied under him\"; and remarks that, being by birth a native of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, he was much helped by his fellow-citizens, many of whom held office in secretarial posts, the K\u00e1sh\u00e1n\u00ed\u00eds being everywhere celebrated for their skill in calligraphy:\u2014\nIn the year A.H. 557 (= A.D. 1161\u20132) the above-mentioned Zaynu\u2019d-D\u00edn, our author\u2019s maternal uncle, being then only 18 years old, recited at K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, then the centre of Arabic learning in Persia, an Arabic qa\u1e63ida, which was admitted by all judges to be incomparable. His poems were widely imitated by his numerous admirers. Amongst them is the following Persian quatrain:\n\n\u0645\u0633 \u062c\u0632\u063a\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0631\u0645 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u063a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u062a\u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u06af\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u0645 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u063a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u060c\n\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0633\u0631\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0627 \u0632\u06cc\u0645 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0628\u0648\u062f\u060c \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u062a \u062a\u0627\u062c \u0633\u0631\u0645 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u063a \u0628\u0627\u0634.\n\nAgain, in A.H. 577 (= A.D. 1181\u20132) he recited to \u2018Az\u00edzu\u2019d-D\u00edn mustawfi an Arabic qa\u1e63ida (33 couplets cited), composed in a single night, from which even his enemies and rivals could not withhold their praise. After mentioning Khw\u00e1ja Dhah\u00edru\u2019d-D\u00edn Karaj\u00ed, whom he calls \u201cpeerless in his time\u201d (\u0631\u0648\u062d\u06cc \u0639\u0635\u0631), our author mentions some of his teachers at Hamadh\u00e1n, to wit, Fakhru\u2019d-D\u00edn Balkh\u00ed, \u0160afi\u2019u\u2019d-D\u00edn Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed, and Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019d-D\u00edn Yazd\u00ed, and then cites (f. 25a) the following rather fine Arabic verses:\n\n\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0643\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u063a\u0631 \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0636\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0629\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0639\u062b \u0645\u063a\u0644\u0642\u060c\n\u062e\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u0643\u0631 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a\u060c \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u062d\u0645 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0649\u060c\n\u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062c\u0627\u0628 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0634\u0631\u0649\u060c \u0648\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0633\u0627\u062f \u064a\u064f\u062d\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u064a\u0634\u0631\u0649.\n\nIn A.H. 580 (= A.D. 1184\u20135) King Ruknu\u2019d-D\u00edn Tughril b. Arsl\u00e1n (Tughril II: see p. 575 supra) desired the author\u2019s\nuncle Zaynu'd-D\u00edn to compile and transcribe for him an anthology of poems, and the volume, on its completion, was illuminated, and illustrated with portraits of the poets cited, by Jam\u00e1l the painter of Isfah\u00e1n. The poems were supplemented by entertaining anecdotes about their authors, and the King himself often came to superintend the progress of the work:\n\nThis passage is very interesting from the point of view of literary history, as showing the judgment of men of taste in those early times when Anwar\u00ed and Abu'l-Faraj of R\u00fana could still be spoken of as 'moderns,' and it may be compared with two similar passages in the rather earlier Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la (pp. 24-25 and 49-50 of the separate\nreprint of my translation of that work = J.R.A.S. for 1899, pp.636-7 and 661-2). It also raises, on chronological grounds, very serious doubts as to whether two entirely different poets, one Min\u00fachihri of the early Ghaznavid period, and another Min\u00fachihr (called \u0634\u0635\u062a \u0643\u0644\u0647, however this sobriquet is to be explained), who, as the above extract shows, was at any rate posterior to Anwari, have not been confounded by Dawlatsh\u00e1h (pp. 40-41 of my edition) and other later writers, including M. A. de Biberstein Kazimirski, the editor and translator of the Div\u00e1n de Menoutchehri. For Anwari lived till the latter part of the sixth century of the hijra, being, in fact, contemporary with our author, which makes it impossible that one of his contemporaries\u2014and, moreover, a younger contemporary\u2014could have been the court poet of the Am\u00edr Falaku'l-Ma'\u00e1li Min\u00fachihr, who died about A.H. 420, more especially if it be true, as 'Awfi tells us in his Lub\u00e1bu'l-Alb\u00e1b, that this court poet \"was short-lived . . . and died about the year four hundred and thirty and odd.\" As the Persians say, \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a.\n\nTo return to our MS. (f. 264). Our author was moved by these examples to a desire to make such an anthology of Persian verse, but was hindered by adverse circumstances, amongst which he refers especially to the death of Tughril II in the year A.H. 590 (=A.D. 1194). After lavishing praises on the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma of Firdaws\u00ed, from which he continually cites lengthy passages, he introduces the following fine Arabic verses, which strongly recall two Persian couplets cited (p. 45 of the reprint = J.R.A.S. for 1899, p. 657) in the Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062c\u0631\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0632\u062f\u06cc \u0644\u0633 \u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0645\u060c \u0630\u06a9\u0631 \u062c\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u060c\n\u0648 \u0646\u0631\u0649 \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u062e\u0644\u062f\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u062e\u0641\u062a \u0628\u0646\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0646\u060c\n\u0648 \u0645\u0644\u0648\u06a9 \u063a\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u063a\u0627\u0641\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u060c \u0642\u062f \u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0633\u0627\u0646.\n\nThe following Persian verses which immediately follow\n\nIts meaning is discussed in Kazimirski's ed. of the Div\u00e1n, p. 7.\nremind us strongly of a well-known passage in the first book of Sa\u2019di\u2019s Gulist\u00e1n (ed.

After repeating its title, he states summarily its contents, to wit:\u2014Praise of God, the Prophet, the Holy Family, the Im\u00e1ms, the \u2018Companions,\u2019 the \u2018Followers,\u2019 the eminent doctors of Isl\u00e1m, and his Royal Patron; some account of his own life; the cause of composition; celebration of the justice and mighty deeds of the Selj\u00faqs; some account of the poets of this age, and the panegyrics recited by them in the Royal Presence; concluding with some remarks on Court etiquette and courtly accomplishments, such as wine-drinking, chess, draughts, archery, horsemanship, venery, state receptions, battle, banquet, calligraphy, \u063a\u0644\u0648\u0628\u060c drugs and potions, \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u060c and, in conclusion, a selection of \u0645\u062e\u06a9\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u0647\u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062a, which last, however (f. 175), he ultimately decided to omit. The indulgence of his readers is claimed (f. 28) in the following verses:\n\n\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u062d\u0633\u0646\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0644\u063a\u062a\u064a \u0641\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0648\u062e\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646\u060c\n\u0641\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0628 \u0628\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0649 \u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0642\u0635\u064a\u060c \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646.\n\nThe Selj\u00faq rule began with Isr\u00e1\u2019il b. Selj\u00faq, the seventh ancestor in the direct line of ascent of Abu\u2019l-Fath Kay-Khusaraw, the patron of our author, who, after invoking curses on anyone who shall alter or deface his book, and making mention of Dhahiru\u2019d-Din Nish\u00e1p\u00far\u012b, the tutor of Sult\u00e1ns Arsl\u00e1n and Mas\u2018\u00fad, passes to a dissertation on the\nvalue of a study of history, and the virtues of the Selj\u00faqs, who, he declares (f. 29*), were, after the Caliphs, the greatest and most religious monarchs who ever reigned. Ruknu\u2019d-D\u00edn Ab\u00fa \u1e6c\u00e1l\u00edb \u1e6cughr\u00edl b. Mu\u1e25ammad b.

He proposes to give some account of the ministers, chamberlains, and at\u00e1beks of each Selj\u00fak monarch, and reminds his patron that of Maliksh\u00e1h, Ma\u1e25m\u00fad, Barkiy\u00e1r\u00faq, Mu\u1e25ammad, \u1e6cughr\u00edl, and Mas\u2018\u00fad naught remains, in spite of their great deeds, save their pious and charitable works and the colleges which they founded at Isfah\u00e1n, Hamadh\u00e1n, and other places.

I supply it from f. 46b, where the account of his reign is given.\n2 The omission of Mahm\u00fad b. Maliksh\u00e1h, whose name should come here, whether it be intentional or not, occurs also in the text. From a passage on f. 58a, however, it would appear that the author regarded him as a usurper, or at least as not de facto king.\n3 The omission at this point of D\u00e1'\u00fad (who reigned, according to Lane, one year, A.H. 525-6) seems likewise to be intentional, no separate article being consecrated to him in the text.\nHere may be said to begin the historical portion of this discursive work, though the author places it on f. 30v, at the beginning of his praise of justice:\n\n1. Beginning of the Selj\u00faq power.\n\nThe Selj\u00faq Turks came originally from Turkist\u00e1n to Transoxiana (\u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0642\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0631\u064f), dwelling in winter in N\u00far of Bukh\u00e1ra (cf. Bandari, p. 5, ll. 4-5) and in summer near Bughd of Samarqand. Selj\u00faq had four sons\u2014Isr\u00e1'il (eighth ancestor of the author's patron, Abu'l-Fath Kay-Khusraw).\nM\u00edk\u00e1\u2019\u00edl, Y\u00e1nus (f. 40a), and M\u00fas\u00e1. Isr\u00e1\u2019\u00edl, the eldest, was driven to revolt by the injustice of his liege, Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad of Ghazna, who, instigated by the \u00cdlak Kh\u00e1n (Qadar Kh\u00e1n: cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 5, l. 9), with whom he had just concluded peace on the banks of the Oxus, invited the Selj\u00faqs to settle on the frontiers of his kingdom, forgetting the proverb:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0639\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0641\u0652\u062a\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0633\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064f \u0633\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0645\u064b\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062c\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0631\u064e\u062c\u0652\u062f\u064b\u0627\n\nOn one occasion (f. 40b), when Isr\u00e1\u2019\u00edl was with Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad, the latter enquired of him how many armed men he could supply in case of need, to which he returned the answer recorded by most historians (whose fancy is struck by the tale), that an arrow sent by him to his tribe would bring 100,000 horsemen to his side, and his bow 200,000. This reply filled Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad with apprehensions, and he forthwith devised a plan to cast Isr\u00e1\u2019\u00edl and his followers into bonds, and imprison them in the castle of K\u00e1lanj\u00e1r (\u06a9\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062c\u0631) in India. There Isr\u00e1\u2019\u00edl languished in captivity for seven years, in spite of the attempts to rescue him made by the Turkm\u00e1ns, whom he bids not to despair, because Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad is only the son of a slave (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647). Finally, (f. 41b) Isr\u00e1\u2019\u00edl dies in bondage, but his son Qutalmish (\u0642\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u06cc\u0634) escapes from India to S\u00edst\u00e1n by way of the \u201cRed-caps\u2019 Desert\u201d (\u067e\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u062e \u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646), whence in time he joins his uncles and kinsmen at Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1. These now swear vengeance against the treacherous Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad (f. 42a), from whom they ask permission to cross the Oxus and settle between Nas\u00e1 and B\u00e1ward. Arsl\u00e1n J\u00e1dh\u00edb, governor of T\u00fas, who built the Rib\u00e1t-i-Sang-bast (cf. my ed. of Dawlatsh\u00e1h, p. 176, ll. 2\u201310), and is there interred, advised the King to refuse this request, lest, through the growing strength of the Selj\u00faqs, some mischief might accrue to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n:\n\n\u0627\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u06a9\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0626\u06cc \u0637\u0648\u0633 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0631\u0628\u0627\u0637 \u0633\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\nContrary to this advice, Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad granted the request of the Selj\u00faqs, who, however, caused no further trouble until his death in A.H. 418 (= A.D. 1027). During this period there had been born to M\u00edk\u00e1\u2019il b. Selj\u00faq his sons Chaghr\u00ed Beg Ab\u00fa Sulaym\u00e1n D\u00e1\u2019\u00fad and Tughril Beg Ab\u00fa T\u00e1l\u00edb Mu\u1e25ammad. On the accession of Mas\u2019\u00fad b. Mahm\u00fad messengers were sent to the \u2018Am\u00edd of N\u00edsh\u00e1pur S\u00far\u00ed b. al-Mu\u2019tazz (cf. my ed. of Dawlatsh\u00e1h, p. 50, ll. 22\u201323, where the reading \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0634\u0631 should no doubt be corrected to \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0632), who built the cupola at Mashhad over the tomb of the Im\u00e1m Rid\u00e1, and who was at this time encamped in Gurg\u00e1n against the Ziy\u00e1rid prince Sharafu\u2019l-Ma\u2019\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n b. Falaku\u2019l-Ma\u2019\u00e1l\u00ed Min\u00fachihr b. Shamsu\u2019l-Ma\u2019\u00e1l\u00ed Q\u00e1b\u00fas b. Washmg\u00edr, awaiting support from the \u2018Am\u00edd Ab\u00fa Sa\u2019\u00edd Hamd\u00fan\u00ed. He at once wrote to Mas\u2019\u00fad b. Mahm\u00fad, who thereupon left N\u00edsh\u00e1pur to attack the Selj\u00faqs. His soldiers were wearied and their weapons rusted with marching through the forests and marshes of M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n, and they were shamefully defeated by the Selj\u00faqs, who carried off much booty. This engagement took place between Shahrist\u00e1na and Fir\u00e1w (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0648). Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2019\u00fad, though greatly vexed at this reverse, was compelled to come to terms with the Selj\u00faqs, as he was then preparing for a campaign in India.\n\nOn his return to Ghazna he found that they had greatly increased in strength, and ordered them to be expelled from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, but the governor of that province, having very unwillingly attempted to carry out this order, suffered a serious defeat (f. 434), whereby the boldness of the Selj\u00faqs was still further increased, so that Tughril Beg\ncame to Nishapur and (in Ramad\u00e1n, A.H. 429 = June, A.D. 1038), as we learn from Bundari (p. 7, l. 1), was proclaimed king.\n\n2. Reign of Tughril Beg (ff. 43a\u201348b).\n\nHis full name and title was as-Sult\u0101nu'l-Mu'adhdham Ruknu'd-Dawla wa'd-Duny\u0101 wa'd-D\u012bn Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib Tughril Beg Mu\u1e25ammad b. Mik\u0101'il b. Seljuq. Later, in A.H. 437 (= A.D. 1045\u20136), as we learn from f. 46a of our MS., his sovereignty was recognized by the Caliph, who conferred on him the title of Yaminu Amtri'l-Muminin. His ministers were Abu'l-Qasim al-Kubani, the Salar of Buzhgan; Ab\u016b Ahmad ad-Dahistani, called 'Umri; and the 'Amidu'l-Mulk Ab\u016b Nasr al-Kunduri. His chamberlain was 'Abdu'r-Rahm\u0101n Alp-zan al-Aghaj\u012b. His crest or sign-manual was \u0634\u06a9\u0644 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc, the shape of a club or mace. He reigned 26 years.\n\nHere follows (f. 43b) an anecdote which is of great interest as proving conclusively the date at which B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e6c\u0101hir, the celebrated dialect poet of Hamadh\u0101n, flourished.\u00b9 This extract I give in the original.\n\n\u00b9 An article on this poet by Zhukovski appeared at pp. 104\u2013108 of the Zapiski of the Oriental Section of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society for 1901 (vol. xiii, part 4). See also Mr. E. Heron-Allen's recently published Lament of B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e6c\u0101hir (Quaritch, 1902).\nThis meeting of Tughril Beg and B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir probably took place about A.H. 447 (= A.D. 1055\u20136: cf. Bund\u00e1ri, pp. 12\u201313) or A.H. 450 (= A.D. 1058\u20139: cf. ibid., p. 15), so that the latter may very well have, as asserted by some writers (Zhukovski, loc. cit.), conversed with the great Avicenna (\u2020 A.H. 427 = A.D. 1036).\n\nThe growing power of Tughril Beg (f. 44a) impelled Sult\u00e1n Mas\u00fad of Ghazna again to hazard a campaign against him. Setting out from Ghazna, he marched by way of Bust and Tak\u00edn\u00e1b\u00e1d to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, where Tughril Beg, separated from his brother (Chaghri Beg), was then residing. Mas\u00fad, mounted on a female elephant, resolved on a forced night-march of 25 parasangs, designing thereby to prevent the Selj\u00faq forces from effecting a junction. Unfortunately he\n\n* The MS. is too ancient to distinguish, as a rule, between \u062c and \u062c, so that this name is generally written \u062c\u063a\u0632\u06cc, but on l. 45a, l. 4, we find \u062c\u063a\u0632\u06cc.\nfell asleep on the elephant's back, and his retainers dared not wake him or continue the march. When he awoke at daybreak he found that Tughril Beg had eluded him and joined his brother Chaghri Beg. Mas'ud, after putting the driver of his elephant to death, turned back to a plain between Sarakhs and Merv, where the Seljuk forces were encamped. These, having supplied themselves with sufficient water, had filled up the wells; and Mas'ud's army, tormented by thirst, suffered a fresh defeat at their hands. During the rout and flight of the Ghaznavid army (f. 44b) Mas'ud dealt one of the pursuing Turkmans so terrible and deadly a blow that the comrades of the victim dared not press the pursuit. \"Such,\" said Mas'ud, \"is my sword-stroke, but luck is wanting!\"\n\nBy this victory (f. 45a) the power and prestige of the Seljuqs was confirmed and increased, and the issue of the struggle was no longer doubtful:\n\nTughril, Chaghri, and their uncle Musa b. Seljuk, called Payghu Kalan (or, by other writers, Arslan Payghu), bind themselves by an oath to loyal union and mutual support. The old illustration of the strength of united action by the bundle of arrows and the component arrows taken singly is here said to have been employed by Tughril Beg on this occasion. The three kinsmen then indite a letter to the Caliph al-Qaim, relating the treacherous dealing of Sultan Mahmud towards Isra'il b. Seljuk (see p. 587 supra), assuring him of their loyalty to himself, and craving his sanction and recognition of their power. This missive they despatch (f. 45b) by the hands of Abu Ishaq al-Fuqqai (cf. Bundari, pp. 7-8). They choose the Salar of Buzhgan as their minister, and then proceed to divide the territories which they have conquered. Chaghri Beg takes Merv; Musa Payghu Kalan, Bust, Herat, and Sistan; Qawurd, Chaghri Beg's eldest son, Kirm\u00e1n and Tabasayn (Tun and Tabas);\nTughril Beg, \u2018Ir\u00e1q; Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm b. \u00cdn\u00e1l\u00b9 b. Selj\u00faq was sent to Hamadh\u00e1n (Tughril selecting Ray as his capital); Am\u00edr Y\u00e1q\u00fat\u00ed [b. D\u00e1\u2019\u00fad Chaghr\u00ed Beg] to Abhar, Zanj\u00e1n, and \u00c1dharb\u00e1yj\u00e1n; and Qutalmish [b. M\u00fas\u00e1 Peygh\u00fa Kal\u00e1n] to Gurg\u00e1n and D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n. Alp Arsl\u00e1n, another of Chaghr\u00ed Beg\u2019s sons, elected to remain with his uncle Tughril Beg, saying:\n\n\u0631\u0636\u0627\u06a9 \u0631\u0636\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0633\u0631\u06a9 \u0633\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f\u0631\n\nWhen the Caliph received the letter above mentioned, he sent Hibatu\u2019ll\u00e1h b. Muhammad al-Ma\u2019m\u00fan\u00ed (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 9, ll. 9\u201310) with a favourable reply to Tughril at Ray. There the ambassador abode for three years, Tughril being too busy with the organization of his newly acquired territories to accompany him to Baghdad; until, in A.H. 437 (= A.D. 1045\u20136: cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 9, l. 5), the Caliph ordered Tughril\u2019s name to be inserted in the khutba and placed on the coinage (in other words recognized his sovereign rank) before the name of the Buwayhid Am\u00edr al-Maliku\u2019r-Rah\u00edm Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r b. Abi\u2019l-Hayj\u00e1 Sult\u00e1nu\u2019d-Dawla, the grandson of \u2018A\u1e0dudu\u2019d-Dawla (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 10, ll. 18\u201319), besides conferring on him the ambiguous\u00b2 title of Yaminu Amiri\u2019l-M\u00faminin, lately borne by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazna. In Ram\u00e1d\u00e1n of this same year (A.H. 437 = March \u2013 April, A.D. 1046) Tughril Beg went to Baghdad, and was received by the Caliph with great honour. Al-Maliku\u2019r-Rah\u00edm the Buwayhid came out to meet him at Nahruw\u00e1n, but was seized by the Selj\u00faq and sent in fetters to Tabaruk near Ray (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 10, ll. 18\u201320). Tughril\u2019s authority over the two \u2018Ir\u00e1qs and K\u00fahist\u00e1n was confirmed by the Caliph.\n\nIn A.H. 449 (= A.D. 1057\u20138) the Isfahsal\u00e1r Bas\u00e1s\u00edr\u00ed (Abu\u2019l-H\u00e1rit\u00ed Arsl\u00e1n: see Bund\u00e1ri, p. 12, ll. 18\u201319) revolted against the Caliph, who craved help from Tughril, on whose approach the rebels fled to Syria. On the march\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Houtsma\u2019s note on p. 8 of Bund\u00e1ri.

Bund\u00e1ri, p. 15). On Tughril\u2019s retiring from Baghdad, Bas\u00e1s\u00edr\u00ed returned, reinforced by the King of Mawsil (\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0634 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0644\u062f), Quraysh b. Badr\u00e1n, and Dubays b. \u2018Al\u00ed b. Mazyad (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 12), foully slew the Ra\u2019\u00edsu\u2019r-ru\u2019asa, maltreated the Caliph, and for a year caused the name of the \u201cEgyptians\u201d (i.e. the F\u00e1t\u00edmide al-Mustans\u00edr) to be inserted in the khutba (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 15, l. 19 seq.). But the discontent of the people of Baghdad against Bas\u00e1s\u00edr\u00ed increased; their governor (Shahna), \u00cdtk\u00edn Sulaym\u00e1n\u00ed, fled to Hulw\u00e1n and wrote an appeal to Tughril; to whom also the Caliph, banished to \u2018Ana and placed in the custody of Bughr\u00ed Muh\u00e1rish (Bund\u00e1ri, p. 16, ll. 18\u201319), addressed a prayer for succour, saying:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0634\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0639\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0634\u062f \u0648 \u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0645\u0637\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\u06af\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u062f\n\nMoved by these letters (f. 47b), Tughril bade Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r al-Kundur\u00ed \u2018Am\u00edd\u00fa\u2019l-Mulk write to \u00cdtk\u00edn (Bund\u00e1ri, pp. 44, 80) to hold the roads and passes and inform the Caliph of his speedy approach.

On receiving these grants, \u1e6cughril withdrew to Tabr\u012bz, leaving the 'Am\u012bd at Baghdad to endeavour to arrange a marriage between him and the Caliph's sister Sayyidatu'n-Nis\u0101. In spite of his aversion, the Caliph was finally compelled to give his consent to this union, and, bestowing on his sister \"F\u0101\u1e6d\u012bma's dowry\" of 400 silver dirhams and one gold din\u0101r, sent her to Tabr\u012bz, which was decorated in her honour (\u0634\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0631 \u0622\u062f\u064e\u0645\u0650 \u0628\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0646\u062f).

His motto was \"God giveth victory\" (\u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0635\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e). In appearance he was tall, with moustaches so long that he used to tie up\ntheir ends when he wished to shoot; and never did his arrows go wide of the mark. He used to wear a very high kul\u0101h on his head, and men were wont to assert that from the top of his kul\u0101h to the tips of his moustaches was a distance of two yards (gaz)!\n\nImmediately on his accession Alp Arsl\u00e1n dismissed the \u2018Am\u00edd from the post of Prime Minister, and appointed the Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk to this office. For some months he carried the dismissed minister from place to place with himself, but in A.H. 456 (=A.D. 1064) he caused him to be executed at Nas\u00e1 in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, being instigated thereto by the Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk. Having prepared himself for death, the unfortunate \u2018Am\u00edd sent the following messages to the King and to his successful rival (f. 51b):\n\n\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06af\u0648\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0645 \u062e\u062f\u0645\u062a \u062e\u062f\u0645\u062a\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u062f\u0645\u062a \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0639\u0645\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0633 \u062f\u0627\u062f \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u062a\u0648 \u0622\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u062a\u0645 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u060c \u067e\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u062f\u0645\u062a \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627 \u0648 \u0622\u062e\u0631\u062a \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u060c \u0648 \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06af\u0648\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0633 \u0628\u062f\u0639\u062a\u06cc \u0648 \u0632\u0634\u062a \u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u062a\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u06a9\u0634\u062a\u0646\u060c \u0622\u0631\u0632\u0648 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u062a \u062f\u0631 \u062d\u0642 \u062e\u0648\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0646 \u0648 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\n\n\u201cSay to the King, \u2018Behold, a fortunate employ was your service! Thy uncle gave me this world to rule over, and thou hast given me the other world, making martyrdom my portion! So, by your service, have I won this world and that.\u2019 And to the Wazir say, \u2018An evil innovation and an ugly practice hast thou brought into the world by putting [dismissed] ministers to death! I trust that thou wilt see the same renewed in thine own case and in that of thy descendants!\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter subduing P\u00e1rs and overcoming the Shab\u00e1nk\u00e1ra (f. 51b), Alp Arsl\u00e1n marched westwards to give battle to the Byzantine emperor Romanus (\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0633), who, with 600,000 men, was threatening the frontiers of the Muslims.\nThe two forces met at Mal\u00e1skurd (so pointed, \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u0648\u062f). Before engaging the enemy, Alp Arsl\u00e1n reviewed his forces, which comprised 12,000 men. At this review the Am\u00edr Sa\u2019du\u2019d-Dawla Guhar-\u00e1y\u00edn noticed a very insignificant Greek soldier whose name no one knew. Some of the officers were for rejecting him, but the Am\u00edr bade them let him be, \u201cfor who knows,\u201d said he, \u201cthat he may not be destined to take captive the Emperor of the Greeks?\u201d By the strangest of coincidences this actually happened. Alp Arsl\u00e1n kept the Emperor prisoner for a few days, and then, having placed rings in his ears (the mark of a slave), released him, on his agreeing to pay a daily tribute (\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0629) of 1,000 din\u00e1rs.\n\nNow in the year A.H. 465 (=A.D. 1072\u20133: cf. Bund\u00e1ri, p. 46) Alp Arsl\u00e1n marched against the Turks. On reaching the Oxus some prisoners taken from the Castle of Narzam (\u0646\u0698\u0645), including the Warden of the Castle, Y\u00fasuf Narzami, were brought before him. Being interrogated by the Sult\u00e1n, Y\u00fasuf returned false and unsatisfactory answers, which so infuriated Alp Arsl\u00e1n that he seized his bow, and, bidding the prisoner\u2019s custodians stand clear, fired at him. The arrow missed its mark, and Y\u00fasuf rushed upon the King, and, wounding the Am\u00edr Sa\u2019du\u2019d-Dawla Guhar-\u00e1y\u00edn, who had thrown himself before his royal master, dealt him a mortal blow, though 2,000 ghul\u00e1ms were standing by and looking on. Only after the assassination had been accomplished did the chief farr\u00e1sh, J\u00e1mi\u2018 of N\u00edsh\u00e1pt\u00far, slay the assassin with a blow on the head from his mallet.\n\n\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0632 \u0631\u0641\u0639\u062a \u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u06af\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u060c\n\u0628\u0645\u0648 \u0622\u06cc \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u062e\u0627\u06a9 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u062a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u060c\n\nIn the reign of Alp Arsl\u00e1n\u2019s successor, Maliksh\u00e1h, the son of this farr\u00e1sh was slain by one of the Caliph al-Muqtad\u00ed\u2019s ghul\u00e1ms, who then took refuge in the Caliph\u2019s harem. The farr\u00e1sh clamoured for vengeance, crying, \u201cO sire! deal with the murderer of thy slave\u2019s son as I dealt with thy father\u2019s murderer!\u201d Maliksh\u00e1h, considering this demand\nto be just, sent his chamberlain Am\u00edr Qum\u00e1j to demand the surrender of the assassin. The Caliph offered 10,000 din\u00e1rs if they would refrain from violating the sanctuary which the criminal had sought, but Maliksh\u00e1h was obdurate, and the murderer was brought forth and put to death. Alp Arsl\u00e1n left nine sons besides Maliksh\u00e1h, who succeeded him.\n\n4. Reign of Maliksh\u00e1h (ff. 54a\u201358b).\n\nHis full name and title was as-Sul\u1e6d\u00e1n Mu\u2019izzu\u2019d-Duny\u00e1 wa\u2019d-Din Maliksh\u00e1h b. Mu\u1e25ammad Alp Arsl\u00e1n Qasimu Amiri\u2019l-M\u00faminin. He was born in Jum\u00e1da I, A.H. 445 (= Aug.\u2013Sept., A.D. 1053), lived 38 and reigned 20 years. He was of somewhat corpulent figure. His Prime Minister, until almost the end of his reign, was the Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk, and his chamberlain Qum\u00e1j (f. 54b).\n\nWhile Maliksh\u00e1h was on his way from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n to \u2018Ir\u00e1q to assume the reins of government, his uncle Q\u00e1wurd advanced against him from Kirm\u00e1n. The two armies met at the gates of Karach (\u0628\u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u0686: cf. Bund\u00e1rti, p. 48 et seqq., and also vol. i of the same Recueil, p. 12 et seqq.), and the battle endured three days and nights, until at length Q\u00e1wurd and his army were routed. One of Maliksh\u00e1h\u2019s champions cut one of his adversaries clean in two. The booty taken by the victors was enormous. Maliksh\u00e1h\u2019s soldiers, on their return to Hamadh\u00e1n, clamoured for more pay and richer rewards, threatening to support Q\u00e1wurd in his pretensions if their demands were not complied with. The Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk, however, put them off with promises, and at once caused Q\u00e1wurd to be poisoned and two of his sons to be blinded; and the mutineers, on hearing of Q\u00e1wurd\u2019s \u201csuicide,\u201d were quieted.\n\nIn A.H. 471 (= A.D. 1078\u20139) Maliksh\u00e1h captured Samarqand and took its Kh\u00e1n prisoner (cf. Bund\u00e1rti, p. 55). The Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk pays the boatmen who take Maliksh\u00e1h over the Oxus in drafts on Antioch, and explains to the\nKing that he does this so that they may realize the greatness of his empire.

To his retainers he gave fiefs in the remotest part of Syria, e.g., to Qas\u00edmu'd-Dawla Aq-sunqur in Aleppo, to 'Im\u00e1du'd-Dawla B\u00fazh\u00e1n in Ruh\u00e1, and to \u062c\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0634 in Mawsil (cf. Bund\u00e1rt, p. 70). From Antioch he marched to Samarqand, where he took prisoner Sulaym\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n; thence onwards to U'zkand, Khat\u00e1, and Khutan (f. 56b). He maintained an army of 46,000 regular troops, whose names were all recorded in the registers of his War Office. The administration of justice he carefully supervised, and he was always accessible to such as deemed themselves oppressed or wronged. Amongst the monuments of his piety and philanthropy are the wells which he constructed on the pilgrim-route, and the endowments he bestowed on the Warden of the Sacred Cities of Mecca and Medina (\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0646) in order that pilgrims might be exempt from the poll-tax of seven gold dinars hitherto levied on each. He was devoted to the chase, and for every head of game which he slew he used to bestow a Maghribi din\u00e1r on some poor man. He caused a careful record of his bags of game to be kept; such a record, in the handwriting of Abu T\u00e1hir al-Kh\u00e1t\u00fam, was seen by the author, and therein it was recorded that in one day's hunting Maliksh\u00e1h shot 70 gazelles:\nEverywhere on his hunting-grounds he built pyramids of the hoofs of the gazelles and wild asses which he had slain.\n\n\u012a\u1e63fah\u0101n was his favourite residence,\u00b9 and there he constructed many fine buildings and gardens, such as the B\u0101gh-i-K\u0101r\u0101n, the Baytu'l-M\u0101 ('Water-house'), the B\u0101gh-i-Ahmad Siy\u0101h,\u00b2 the B\u0101gh-i-Dasht-i-G\u016br ('Garden of the Plain of the Wild Ass'), the Qal'a-i-Shahr, and the Qal'a-i-Diz-K\u016bh.\n\nHis Prime Minister, the great Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk, had twelve sons, each of whom held some government office. Turk\u0101n Kh\u0101t\u016bn (f. 57b), the daughter of Tamgh\u0101j Kh\u0101n, who enjoyed an immense influence over Maliksh\u0101h, conceived the idea of displacing him in favour of her own minister T\u0101ju'l-Mulk Abu'l-Ghan\u0101'im-i-P\u0101rs\u012b, and finally succeeded in persuading the King to make this change of ministers. Her hatred of the Nidh\u0101m was due to the fact that she desired her young son Mahm\u016bd to be nominated by Maliksh\u0101h as his successor, while the Nidh\u0101m espoused the cause of the Prince Barkiy\u0101ruq. The following rash speech of the Nidh\u0101m to his royal master is said to have served in some degree as the pretext for his dismissal:\n\nAbout this time Mali\u1e33sh\u0101h set out from \u012a\u1e63fah\u0101n for Baghdad (f. 58b), and when the royal cavalcade reached Nah\u0101vand one of the Assassins (\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0647), incited thereto by the T\u0101ju'l-Mulk, mortally wounded the Nidh\u0101m (a deed, adds the author, which no good Muslim would have done), who was then \"over eighty years of age.\" \"Thou would'st suppose,\" says our author, \"that this word of his (cited above) was an omen, for the King too died eighteen days after he reached Baghdad\"; and he then cites the celebrated verses of Mu'izz\u012b (cf. my ed. of Dawlatsh\u0101h, p. 60):\n\n\u00b9 Cf. J.R.A.S. for 1901, pp. 667-8.\n\u00b2 Cf.

Maliksh\u00e1h Yaminu Amiri'l-M\u00faminin*. He was of very handsome appearance; he succeeded to the throne in A.H. 486 (=A.D. 1093), reigned 12 years and lived!25. He was born at Isfah\u00e1n in Mu\u1e25arram, A.H. 474 (= June\u2013July, A.D. 1081). His motto was \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0645\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 (\u062a\u0648\u0642\u064a\u0639). His prime ministers were al-\u1e24usayn 'Izzu'l-Mulk b. Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk, Ab\u00fa Bakr Mu'ayyidu'l-Mulk b. Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk, Fakhru'l-Mulk b. Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk, A'azzu'l-Mulk, 'Abdu'l-Jalil ad-Dahist\u00e1n\u00ed, and Majdu'l-Mulk 'Bu'l-Fadl al-Qumm\u00ed. His chamberlains were the Am\u00edr Qum\u00e1j, Tugh\u00e1n \u064a\u0631\u062b, and 'Abdu'l-Malik.\n\nAt the time of his father's death Barkiy\u00e1ruq (the eldest son, though hardly yet 13 years of age) was at Isfah\u00e1n. Turk\u00e1n Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, who was at Baghdad, besought the Caliph to give the crown to her own son Mahm\u00fad, but the Caliph at first refused on the ground of the child's tender age. The Caliph, however, had a son by Maliksh\u00e1h's sister Mah-Malik Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, named Am\u00edr Ja'far, whose help, by bribes and flattery, Turk\u00e1n Kh\u00e1t\u00fan succeeded in gaining, so that the Caliph at length acceded to her desire. Thereupon she at once despatched Am\u00edr B\u00fagh\u00e1 to Isfah\u00e1n (which he reached in one week from Baghdad) to seize Barkiy\u00e1ruq (f. 60a), whom, however, the Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk's sons concealed, protected, and carried off under cover of darkness to S\u00e1wa and \u1e34aba, whence G\u00fcmush-Tagin the j\u00e1nd\u00e1r (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, pp. 83\u20134) conveyed him to Ray, and there proclaimed him king. At the time of his coronation Barkiy\u00e1ruq was not 13 years of age, and the bejewelled crown was suspended over his head (being too heavy for him to wear)\u00b9 by Ab\u00fa Muslim, the governor (\u0631\u0626\u06cc\u0633) of Ray, while nearly 20,000 troops assembled at the gates of Ray to defend his cause.\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Ibn Hish\u00e1m's Biography of the Prophet, ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, p. 42.\nMeanwhile Turk\u00e1n Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, accompanied by her son Mahm\u00fad, occupied Isfah\u00e1n. Barkiy\u00e1ruq marched against her. Her advisers, Majdu'l-Mulk of Qum, T\u00e1ju'l-Mulk Abu'l-Ghan\u00e1'im, the Isfahs\u00e1l\u00e1r Am\u00edr Unr\u00fa Bulk\u00e1 Beg, agreed to give Barkiy\u00e1ruq 500,000 din\u00e1rs as his share of the inheritance on condition of his raising the siege. On receiving this sum Barkiy\u00e1ruq retired to Hamadh\u00e1n, whereupon Turk\u00e1n Kh\u00e1t\u00fan again began to intrigue against him, promising his maternal uncle Malik Isma'il that if he could defeat Barkiy\u00e1ruq she would marry him. Accordingly, early in A.H. 486 (= A.D. 1093) Malik Isma'il gave battle to Barkiy\u00e1ruq at Karach, but was defeated.\u2014Zubayda Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, the mother of Barkiy\u00e1ruq, is put to death (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, pp. 83 and 87).\u2014Barkiy\u00e1ruq's uncle Tutush b. Alp Arsl\u00e1n revolts, and marches on K\u00fahist\u00e1n (cf. Bund\u00e1ri, pp. 84\u20135).\u2014Turk\u00e1n Kh\u00e1t\u00fan is put to death by Barkiy\u00e1ruq in Ram\u00e1d\u00e1n, A.H. 487 (= Sept.\u2013Oct., A.D. 1094).\u2014Barkiy\u00e1ruq, overcome by his uncle Tutush, surrenders (f. 61v) to his brother Mahm\u00fad, who receives him at Isfah\u00e1n with apparent kindness. He is imprisoned by Unr\u00fa Bulk\u00e1 in the K\u00fashk-i-Mayd\u00e1n, and it is decided to blind him, but at this juncture Mahm\u00fad is attacked by the smallpox (\u0645\u0644\u0644), and the amirs determined to await the issue of the disease, which terminates fatally the same week, whereupon they again place Barkiy\u00e1ruq upon the throne. At this juncture Mu'ayyidu'l-Mulk, son of the Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk, arrived from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and was made Prime Minister. Barkiy\u00e1ruq in turn was attacked by the smallpox, so that his life was despaired of, but he recovered, marched on Hamadh\u00e1n, and in Safar, A.H. 488 (= Feb.\u2013March, A.D. 1095), fought a battle with his uncle Tutush. Fakhru'l-Mulk, another son of the Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk, arrived from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n bringing many fine presents, and was made Prime Minister. Barkiy\u00e1ruq was wounded by one of the Assassins (\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062f\u062f), but recovered, and marched on Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n against his uncle Arsl\u00e1n Argh\u00fan, sending his\n\n1 Pointing and pronunciation uncertain: here written \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0644\u0643\u0627, lower (f. 61v) \u0627\u0646\u0631 and (f. 62v) \u0627\u0646\u0631.\nbrother Sinjar and the At\u00e1bek Qum\u00e1j on in advance (A.H. 489 = A.D. 1095), but (f. 61b) ere the hostile forces met, Arsl\u00e1n Argh\u00fan was stabbed to death by a slave-boy at Merv (Bund\u00e1ri, pp. 256\u20138). Barkiy\u00e1ruq then came to Tirmidh, made his brother Sinjar king over Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and returned to \u2018Ir\u00e1q.\n\nUnr\u00fa Bulk\u00e1 next revolted, instigated thereunto by the Mu\u2019ayyidu\u2019l-Mulk (whom Barkiy\u00e1ruq had then just dismissed from the office of Prime Minister), who said to him, \u201cHow art thou less than Mahm\u00fad, the son of Turk\u00e1n Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, seeing that Maliksh\u00e1h loved thee above all his sons?\u201d Unr\u00fa, however, was assassinated by one of the Mal\u00e1hid\u00e1 at Injil\u00e1wand near S\u00e1wa, and the Mu\u2019ayyidu\u2019l-Mulk, unable to remain in \u2018Ir\u00e1q or Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n on account of the treason he had committed and the enmity of the powerful Majdu\u2019l-Mulk, fled to Ganja (Bund\u00e1ri, p. 87) to Barkiy\u00e1ruq\u2019s brother Mu\u1e25ammad, whom he urged to contest the crown with Barkiy\u00e1ruq. Accordingly, in A.H. 492 (= A.D. 1098\u20139) they marched forth from Ganja towards K\u00fahist\u00e1n, whither Barkiy\u00e1ruq, accompanied by Majdu\u2019l-Mulk Abu\u2019l-Fadl of Qum, had come from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. Now Barkiy\u00e1ruq\u2019s troops conceived a great hatred of this minister, and sought his life, so that he took refuge in the King\u2019s tent; but, seeing the furious persistence of his foes, he at last advised his master to surrender him to them. This the Sult\u00e1n refused to do, but the soldiers broke into the tent, dragged out the unfortunate minister by his beard, and tore him in pieces. The \u00c1khur-beg (Master of the horse) \u00cdn\u00e1nj Paygh\u00fa, who, with the sons of the Amir Isfahs\u00e1l\u00e1r Bursuq (see Houtsma\u2019s note on Bund\u00e1ri, p. 70: the name is unpointed in our MS.), had instigated the murder, now advised Barkiy\u00e1ruq to flee, and he accordingly left the camp for Ray, accompanied only by ten or fifteen personal attendants. Mu\u1e25ammad his brother, accompanied by his minister Mu\u2019ayyidu\u2019l-Mulk (f. 63a), came to the gates of Hamadh\u00e1n and proclaimed himself king (panj naebat zad). Barkiy\u00e1ruq gathered an army from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, Gurg\u00e1n, and Ray, marched against his brother Mu\u1e25ammad, defeated him, and took prisoner\nMu\u2019ayyidu\u2019l-Mulk, who, when he had lain some days in prison, offered Barkiy\u00e1ruq 100,000 din\u00e1rs to release him and make him Prime Minister. Barkiy\u00e1ruq consented to this, and the minister was engaged in raising the required sum of money, when one day one of the King\u2019s footmen (\u0637\u0634\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631), thinking that his master was taking his noon-tide siesta, uttered a disparaging comment on the lack of zeal (\u062d\u0645\u064a\u062a) of the Selj\u00faqs which could condone such treachery and double dealing as that of which the Mu\u2019ayyidu\u2019l-Mulk had been guilty. Barkiy\u00e1ruq heard this remark, came forth from his chamber, and ordered the Mu\u2019ayyidu\u2019l-Mulk to be brought before him, blindfolded and seated in a chair. Then with his own hand he severed the traitor\u2019s head from his body, and, turning to the footman, said, \u201cThou seest the zeal of the Selj\u00faqs!\u201d\n\n6. Reign of Mu\u1e25ammad b. Maliksh\u00e1h (ff. 64a\u201369a).\n\nHis full name and title was as-Sult\u00e1n Gh\u00edy\u00e1thu\u2019d-Duny\u00e1 wa\u2019d-D\u00edn Ab\u00fa Shuj\u00e1\u2018 Mu\u1e25ammad b. Maliksh\u00e1h Qasimu Amiri\u2019l-M\u00famin\u00edn. He was born in Sha'b\u00e1n, A.H. 474 (= January, A.D. 1082), lived 37 years, and reigned 13, succeeding to the throne in A.H. 498 (A.D. 1104\u20135) on the death of his brother Barkiy\u00e1ruq. His motto (\u062a\u0648\u0642\u06cc\u062d) was \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0641\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647. His ministers (f. 65a) were Mu\u2019ayyidu\u2019l-Mulk b. Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk (before his undisputed accession), Kha\u1e6d\u00edru\u2019l-Mulk Ab\u00fa Mans\u00far al-Maybudh\u00ed, Sa\u2019du\u2019l-Mulk al-Ab\u00ed, Ahmad Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk b. Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk, and Rab\u00edbu\u2019d-Dawla Ab\u00fa Mans\u00far al-Q\u00edr\u00e1t\u00ed. His chamberlains were \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Malik, \u2018Umar Qar\u00e1tag\u00edn, and \u2018Al\u00ed B\u00e1r. He was a vehement champion of the Faith, and a relentless foe to the heretical Isma\u2018\u00edl\u00ed\u015b (\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0647) and to all such as favoured or sympathized with them. To the reduction of Diz-k\u00fah, one of their strongholds near I\u1e63fah\u00e1n (identical with Sh\u00e1h-d\u00edz\n\n---\n\n1 Added in margin: \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0644\u062b \u0628\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0631\u0643.\n2 This is definitely stated on f. 66a:\n\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629 \u062f\u0632\u06a9\u0648\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0647\u060c\nof *Bund\u0101r\u012b*, p. 90), he devoted seven years; and, remarks our author:\n\nAt the beginning of his reign he had to go to Baghdad (f. 65b) to fight \u1e62adaqa\u00b9 and Ay\u00e1z, sons of one of Barkiy\u0101ruq\u2019s clients, who had revolted against him. The rebels, terrified by heavenly portents, were defeated, \u1e62adaqa killed in battle, and Ay\u00e1z taken prisoner and put to death. \u1e62adaqa\u2019s head was sent to the King\u2019s brother Sinjar in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n.\n\nDuring the fratricidal quarrels of Muhammad and Barkiy\u0101ruq, the Assassins, or *Mal\u0101h\u012bda*, had increased greatly in strength, and to their extirpation the King now devoted his energies. The following interesting passage (f. 66) concerning the wholesale abductions and murders alleged to have been committed by them in I\u1e63fah\u0101n may be compared with *Bund\u0101r\u012b*, pp. 90 et seqq.:\n\n\u00b9 Cf. pp. 102\u2013104 (Anecdote xxix) of my translation of the *Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la*. For the following valuable note I am indebted to Mr. T. A. Archer. \u201cAs to one of the people mentioned in your translation,\u201d he writes, \u201cI can possibly give you a little information that may be new to you. I refer to the \u1e62adaqa on pp. 102\u20133 [of the *Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la*], who is there called by the strange title of \u2018King of the Arabs.\u2019 This is, I think, beyond any doubt \u2018\u1e62adaka\u2019 (or \u2018\u1e62adaqa,\u2019 as the French translations spell the word), lord of Hillah, and, according to one thirteenth-century Arabic historian, if my memory does not fail me, \u2018founder\u2019 (*sic*) of that place. He was a most remarkable man, very famous for his love of letters and his large collection of books; a collection all the more remarkable in that, if my memory does not fail me again, he could not, according to the same Arabic chronicler, read himself. He appears to have been somewhat of a heretic (a Shi\u012bte, I suppose), and died in battle against the \u2018Abb\u0101sid Caliph and Muhammad the Sultan early in March, A.D. 1108 (March 4 or 5, according to my calculation). The Arabic chroniclers, if I remember right, speak of him as N\u012bdh\u0101m\u012b does, by the strange title \u2018King of the Arabs,\u2019 and, what is more curious still, the title \u2018King of the Arabs\u2019 passed on to his son, the still more famous Dubays, who figures more than once in actual crusading history as warring against the Norman Crusaders in the principality of Antioch, many of these Normans being\u2014to judge from their sur-names\u2014members of well-known English families (I mean of Norman families settled in England). Walter, the Chancellor of Antioch, who was actually taken prisoner by Dubays and his allies in A.D. 1119, always speaks of Dubays as \u2018rex Arabum\u2019 (N\u012bdh\u0101m\u012b\u2019s title for his father); and even William of Tyre, writing about 60 years later, knew that he was an Arab chief, for he refers to him as \u2018astrapa potentissimus Arabum.\u2019 I may add that you will find a fairly detailed account of \u1e62adaqa himself in Ibnul\u2019-Ath\u012br, under, I believe, the year A.H. 501.\u201d\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nThere was at I\u1e63fah\u00e1n a certain literary man (ad\u012bb) called \u1e62\u016br\u012bk \u2018A\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101sh (\u0639\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0634). Being from the first in the same connection, he became suspected [of being in sympathy with al\u0101hida], and the clergy (\u0623\u0626\u0645\u0629) of I\u1e63fah\u00e1n pursued him to persecute him. He fled to Ray, and there himself to \u1e24asan-i-\u1e62abb\u00e1\u1e25. . . . . Thereafter he found in his handwriting a letter which he had written to a friend, wherein occurred the expression, \u2018I have left behind me the Grey Falcon, and this hath compensated me for what I have left behind\u2019\u2014\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0637\u0650\u0639\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0632\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0647\u0650\u0628\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u064a \u0639\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0641\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0647\u064f.\n\nThis handwriting is well known, and there [still] exist many books written in his hand. And this Ahmad had a son called Ahmad, who during his life was a linen-merchant (kirb\u0101s-furi\u0161i kard\u012b), and he held in detestation his father\u2019s sect and renounced all part or share. So, when they did him no hurt.\n\nNow the Castle of Dizk\u016bh, which was built by Sult\u0101n Maliksh\u0101h and named Sh\u0101h-diz, were placed, during the absence of the King, the [royal] treasure and armory, and likewise the young page-boys (\u0648\u0634\u0627\u0642\u0627\u0646) and girls of the Palace; and a company of Daylamites kept guard over the Castle. There this Ahmad, the son of \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Malik, introduced himself in the capacity of teacher to the page-boys, and whenever he came into the town he used to buy for the girls clothing, veils, and other women\u2019s gear; and he used to hold private conferences with the Daylamites, for whom he professed friendship. These were themselves [already] prone to the matter; all of them responded to his propaganda, and he then became the governor of the Castle and they his subjects.\n\nThereafter he constructed a \u2018Mission-house\u2019 (da\u2018wat-kh\u0101na) at the very gates of the city, near the Dasht-i-G\u016br, whither nightly a company would repair from the town (f. 66b), absorb his teaching, and make profession of his\ndoctrines, until every class had established in its own quarter a congregation imbued with this heresy, whom they then presented at the 'Mission-house,' till 30,000 men had accepted the propaganda. And they used to kidnap Musulm\u00e1ns and do them to death.\n\n\"About this time there appeared a blind man called 'Alaw\u00ed Mad\u00e1n\u00ed (\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0645\u062f\u0646\u06cc), who, towards nightfall, used to stand at the end of his street with a staff in his hand, crying, 'May God pardon him who will take the hand of this poor blind man and lead him to the door of his dwelling in this lane!' Now the lane was long and dark, having at its end the Sar\u00e1y-i-G\u00far, and in the porch of this building was a well. And when [the victim] had brought 'Al\u00ed [or 'Alaw\u00ed, as he was called previously] to the door of the building, a gang [of the heretics] would seize him, drag him within, and cast him head downwards into the well, whence passages communicated with the cellars. Four or five months passed in this fashion, and a large number of the young men of the city disappeared, for none won forth thence, nor could tidings be obtained of either living or dead.\n\n\"One day a beggar-woman craved an alms at this house. Hearing a groaning, she exclaimed, 'May God heal your sick!' The inmates of the house, fearing lest she should become cognizant of their doings, sought, on the pretext of giving her food, to inveigle her within; but she, being alarmed, fled. Meeting some people at the end of the street, she said to them, 'From such and such a house I heard a horrible wailing, and some people endeavoured to seize me.' Then a turmoil arose, and crowds of people assembled outside the door of the house, and, effecting an entrance, began to search its every nook and corner. Ultimately they found their way to the cellars, where they beheld four or five hundred men or more, some slain and others crucified against the walls, of whom two or three still breathed. This being noised abroad through the city, men flocked thither, each to find some friend or kinsman, and there fell upon I\u1e63fah\u00e1n lamentation and wailing, the\nlike of which none can describe. Then they seized 'Alawi Madan\u00ee and his wife, sought out their accomplices, and burned him and his wife in the Bazaar of the Army.\"\n\nNow Sa'du'l-Mulk, the minister, was suspected of sympathizing with the Assassins by many of the nobles and some of the clergy of Isfah\u00e1n, such as the Chief Q\u00e2d\u00ed 'Ubaydu'll\u00e1h Kha\u1e6d\u00eeb\u00ee and Sadr\u00fb'd-D\u00edn Khujand\u00ee, but though these suspicions were on several occasions communicated to the King, he refused to credit them, having entire confidence in the accused. But Sa'du'l-Mulk had a chamberlain who was acquainted with his most hidden secrets, and from whom he concealed nothing. And when the siege of Disk\u00fbh had continued for a long while, Ahmad b. 'Att\u00e2sh, the chief of the Assassins, sent a message to Sa'du'l-Mulk, saying, \"Our stores are nearly at an end, and our men are weary of fighting: we desire to surrender the Castle.\" But Sa'du'l-Mulk sent answer, \"Be patient for one week and do not surrender, till we overthrow this dog\" (meaning the King). Now it was the King's custom to be bled once every month, and Sa'du'l-Mulk bribed the phlebotomist with a thousand din\u00e2rs to use for the operation a poisoned lancet. This plot was communicated by his chamberlain to his beautiful wife, who communicated it to her paramour (\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631), who told one of the officers of Sharaf\u00fb'l-Isl\u00e1m, by whom it was made known to the King. So next day the King, feigning illness, sent for the phlebotomist, and caused him to be scratched with his own lancet; whereupon, the poison taking effect, he turned black and died in agony. Next day the King hanged Sa'du'l-Mulk and Abu'l-'Al\u00e1 [b.] Mufaddal. Two days later Ahmad b. 'Att\u00e2sh surrendered the Castle of Dizk\u00fbh. His hands were bound, and, mounted on a camel, he was paraded through the streets of Isfah\u00e1n, where more than a hundred thousand men, women, and children turned out to\n\n1 The MS. reads Mu'ayyidu'l-Mulk, but this must be an error. See p. 604 supra.\n2 Bund\u00e2ri (p. 92) regards all these charges against Sa'du'l-Mulk as mere calumnies.\nsee him, pelting him with dirt and dust, and mocking him in scornful ballads:\n\nThen he was crucified for seven days, and, as he hung there, they fired arrows at him (tir-b\u00e1r\u00e1n-ash kardand), and afterwards burned his body.\n\nSo the Castle of D\u00edzk\u00fah was dismantled, and Shir-g\u00edr was sent to attack Alam\u00fat, the headquarters of the Assassins. It also was on the point of surrendering when news arrived of the Sult\u00e1n\u2019s death, and the siege was raised.\n\nThe deceased King, apart from his avarice, which was extreme, was a good ruler. When Ahm\u00e9d (f. 68b) b. Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019l-Mulk was w\u00e1z\u00edr, he prepared to attack Sayy\u00edd Ab\u00fa H\u00e1sh\u00edm, the chief of Hamadh\u00e1n, the grandfather of \u2018Al\u00e1\u2019u\u2019d-Dawl\u00e1; and the minister was to pay the King 500,000 din\u00e1rs on condition that he might deal with the Sayy\u00edd as he pleased. The latter and his three sons, being informed of this arrangement, escaped from Hamadh\u00e1n, and made their way in one week to \u00cdsfah\u00e1n, where, by means of a courtier named L\u00e1l\u00e1 Qar\u00e1t\u00e1g\u00edn, whom they bribed with 10,000 din\u00e1rs, they obtained by night a secret audience with the King, whose wife, N\u00far\u00e1n\u00ed Qutlugh Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, was also\n\n---\n\n1 The same was done (but with bullets for arrows) to Mirz\u00e1 \u2018Ali Mu\u1e25ammad the B\u00e1b when he was put to death at Tabr\u00edz in the summer of 1850.\n\n2 This story is very well known, but the individual concerned is seldom named. It occurs in \u2018Aw\u00edf\u00ed\u2019s Jav\u00e1mi\u2018u\u2019n-l-Hik\u00e1yat, and is cited from there in the chrestomathy at the end of Salemann and Zhukovski\u2019s Persische Grammatik.\npresent. The Sayyid then presented the King with a priceless pearl, and promised him 800,000 din\u00e1rs (f. 69a) if he would spare him and protect him against his foe Ahmad b. Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk. Greed of money was stronger with the King than love for his minister, and the Sayyid, having received promise of protection, was suffered to depart. The 800,000 din\u00e1rs, laden on 40 mules, were duly sent by him to the King, who only bestowed one single din\u00e1r on the messenger who brought them.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. XXII.\u2014Catalogue of the late Professor Fr. Max M\u00fcller's Sanskrit Manuscripts. Compiled by Don M. de Z. Wickremasinghe.\n\nThe collection of Sanskrit MSS. described below forms part of the library of the late Professor Fr. Max M\u00fcller, which was acquired in July, 1901, for the Japanese University of Tokiyo. It consists of 82 codices, of which 15 are tracings and 26 are transcripts of MSS. chiefly in the Berlin Royal Library, the Munich University Library, the Paris National Library, the India Office Library, and the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The remaining 41 MSS. were received from India through the agency of the late Dr. J. R. Ballantyne, of the Benares Sanskrit College, Professor G. B\u00fchler, and Dr. FitzEdward Hall. All these MSS. represent Vedic works, chiefly connected with the Rgveda, and have been more or less used in the preparation of Professor Max M\u00fcller's edition of the Rgveda-samhit\u0101 with S\u0101yana's Commentary.\n\nThe compiler takes this opportunity to gratefully acknowledge advice and encouragement received from Professor A.

It is a copy of a MS. which belonged to Dr. Bh\u0101u D\u0101ji, but not of that now in the Library of the Asiatic Society, Bombay. In addition to the division into eight adhy\u0101y\u0101s, subdivided into varg\u0101s mostly containing five \u015blok\u0101s, the \u015blok\u0101s are continuously numbered from the beginning, total 1,281. Adhy\u0101ya i (f. 3b), ii (f. 6b), iii (f. 9b), iv (f. 12b), v (f. 16a) vi (f. 19b), vii (f. 22b), viii (f. 25).\n\nOn f. 1a: atha B\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101-pr\u0101rambho'ya\u1e41 asti. The end of the seventh adhy\u0101ya (22b) is wrongly described as \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dho 'dhy\u0101ya\u1e25.\n\n55.\n\nMM. 35 (M). Indian paper; ff. 53; Devan\u0101gar\u012b character, clearly written, 9 lines on each page; date, \u015aaka 1788 (A.D. 1866\u201367). On the outside top leaf (1a) is written in Professor Max M\u00fcller's hand, \"Sent by Dr. B\u00fchler, Sept., 1866. A copy m.o. of the same MS. from which my other MS. (b), likewise sent by Dr. B\u00fchler, was taken.\"\n\nAnother copy of the B\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101. Fairly correct. Besides divisions into adhy\u0101y\u0101s and varg\u0101s, the \u015blok\u0101s are numbered continuously, total 1,049 (a shorter recension than that of the preceding MS., MM. 34 A). Practically identical in numbering, mistakes, etc., with the following copy, MM. 36 (M b).\n\nOn f. 1a: atha \u015aaunak\u012bya-b\u1e5bhadderat\u0101-pr\u0101rambha\u1e25. Fol. 53b is blank. Adhy\u0101ya i (f. 7b), ii (f. 15a), iii (f. 21b), iv (f. 28 (?)), v (f. 34a), vi (f. 40a), vii (f. 46b), viii (f. 53). End of the seventh adhy\u0101ya erroneously described as \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dho'dhy\u0101ya\u1e25.\n\n56.\n\nMM. 36 (M b). Indian paper; ff. 57; Devan\u0101gar\u012b character, written somewhat rapidly but fairly clear; date, \u015aaka 1767 (A.D. 1845\u201346).\n\nAnother copy of the B\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101. Fairly correct. Same divisions and numbering of \u015blok\u0101s (same total, 1,049) as in MM. 35 (M).\nOn the outside top leaf (1a) is written by Professor Max M\u00fcller in red pencil, \"sent to me by B\u00fchler (present)\u2014MS. M.\" This MS. is identical down to minutest details with the Haug MS. in the Munich Library, even the date (as given above) being identical. Therefore the present MS. and MS. M (MM. 35) are evidently copies of the MS. which belonged to Professor Haug (containing as it does the entry \"M. Haug, Poona, 11 M\u00e4rz, 1865\"), and which, after his death, came into the possession of the Royal Library at Munich.\n\nOn f. 1a: atha \u015aaunakiya-b\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101-pr\u0101rambha\u1e25. End of the 7th adhy\u0101ya, wrongly described as \u015ba\u1e63\u1e6dho'dhy\u0101y\u0101\u1e25.\n\nThese three MSS. (MM. 34\u201336) were collated by Professor Max M\u00fcller for the passages of the B\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101 quoted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, also by Professor Macdonell (in 1886) for his edition of \u015aadguru\u015bi\u1e63ya, for an article in the R.A.S.'s Journal (1894, pp. 11\u201327), and for his forthcoming edition of the B\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101.\n\n57.\n\nMM. 55.

According to Professor Macdonell, this appears to be a copy of the MS. in the Munich Royal Library.\n\n58.\n\nMM. 77 (B 8) II. Cream-wove copying paper; pp. 103; size 11 in. by 4 in.; Devan\u0101gar\u012b character, 5 to 6 lines (about 9 in. long) on each page. An impression taken by means of a copying machine, of a transcript of the MS. 1,152 in the India Office Library. On the top of the first page is written \"Copied from MS. 1152 E.I.H. collat. with MS. 132 E.I.H.\" At the foot of p. 101 the same note is repeated with the addition of \"the last chapter is not in the other MS.

For by a curious coincidence it would seem to have been used, not only by Dr. Leyden for his English translation, but also for the two\n\n---\n\n1 In Notes, J.R.A.S., July, 1900, p. 452, reference is made to an uncatalogued manuscript collection in the Advocates' Library. I have now ascertained that this is one of recently acquired Scottish MSS., and that it does not include any Oriental MSS.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nPersian versions, i.e., that of Mirz\u0101 P\u0101yanda Mu\u1e25ammad and Mu\u1e25ammad Quli, finished 1586, and that reputed to be by \u2018Abdu-r-rah\u012bm Mirz\u0101 and presented to Akbar in 1590.\n\nThis supposition rests on the following points of identical content or gap:\n\n(1) The Elphinstone has lost the concluding part of A.H. 908. This is given both in No. X and No. XII.\n\nThe score of Persiap MSS. which I have examined and also the regal Ulwar copy which Mr. Beveridge has seen, all lack this same part. P\u0101yanda \u1e24asan\u2019s version, moreover, contains the identical scribe\u2019s note which Dr. Leyden has translated and commented on. (Mems., 122.)\n\n(2) The Elphinstone does not contain the full account of Hind\u0101l\u2019s adoption which is in No. XII, and with brief omission in No. X. Nor do the Persian MSS. contain it.\n\n(3) The Elphinstone contains the \u201cshaving passage\u201d signed by Hum\u0101y\u016bn. (Cf. J.R.A.S., July, 1900.) It is not in No. X or in No. XII.\n\nIt occurs in every one of a score of reputed \u2018Abdu-r-rah\u012bm versions. P\u0101yanda \u1e24asan does not include the chapter in which it might occur.\n\n(4) The Elphinstone does not contain the account of the Indian revenues (A.H. 932). Nor does any one of a score of Persian MSS. This is in No. X and No. XII.\n\nOther less important points of identity could be mentioned, but the four cited suffice, when taken with Mr. Erskine\u2019s statement that the Elphinstone contains two marginal notes made by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, to establish a probability that the Elphinstone was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s own book, and the very MS. used for the two Persian translations made under Akbar.\n\nWithout seeing the Elphinstone so as to be sure that Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s notes are truly marginal and autographic, and are not merely interpolations, one cannot go beyond \u201cprobability\u201d in the matter, but support is given to the probability by two other circumstances. (1) No Persian text reproduces the amratphul note. (Mems., 329 n.) Had it been interpolated in the text and not marginal, it would have been copied with the rest (cf. infra on this note).\n(2) No other Turk\u012b text which has the characteristics of the Elphinstone in notes and lacunae has come to light. It is easy to understand tatters and tears in Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s library, because it was subjected to much hard travel\u2014one story of its loss and recovery is historical\u2014it will have gone where the royal exile went; the date of the \u201cshaving passage\u201d is that of the stay in K\u0101bul (cir. 1553) before the Restoration.\n\nIt is not easy to understand why the Persian translations were made only from an incomplete Turk\u012b text. But there is the fact. The scribe of the Elphinstone, if one may judge from the translation, has not made any lament over gaps excepting the one of 908 H. This silence allows a conjecture (a) that he knew of the existence in B\u0101bar\u2019s work of the missing portion, and that he was aware the gap was caused by lost pages; (b) that he acquiesced in some other lacunae in the narrative, because they were left blank by B\u0101bar; and (c) that some of the lacunae found by Leyden and Erskine in the Elphinstone have been caused by loss of pages subsequent to the Persian translation.\n\nAlthough I have not been able to trace the Elphinstone MS., I have found, in Persian, a passage it contained, i.e. the amratphul note (Mems., 329 n.), which Mr. Erskine attributes to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. This is bound up in one of Mr. Erskine\u2019s volumes of manuscript remains (B.M. Add. 26,605, p. 88). It is not, either in this copy or in Mr. Erskine\u2019s English reproduction, in any way authenticated as Hum\u0101y\u016bn. His \u201cshaving note\u201d is signed harara-hu Muh. Hum\u0101y\u016bn (Mems., 304; cf. Notes, J.R.A.S., July, 1900). The expression in it \u201cdar zam\u0101n-i-m\u0101\u201d shows it to be a royal entry, but its non-appearance in the Persian translation and its disrespectful tone, so unlike that of the first note in which Hum\u0101y\u016bn speaks of his father, suggest that it is Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s or perhaps Sh\u0101h-jah\u0101n\u2019s.\n\nX. Hyder\u0101b\u0101d MS. (Library of the late Sir Salar Jung).\n\nIt was my good fortune to hear of this valuable MS. through Mr. Beveridge, and I have now had an opportunity\nof examining it, an advantage I owe to the kind help of Shamsu'l-'ulama Sayyid 'Ali Bilgr\u0101mi. For it is the first complete Turk\u012b text of the B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma (T\u016bzuk-i-b\u0101bar\u012b) which I have found existing \"under the flag,\" and equalling, if not excelling, the St. Petersburg texts.\u00b9 No public library in England or in India owns a MS. that approaches it for completeness; of the two St. Petersburg MSS. which carry the narrative down to A.H. 936 (Mems., 425), i.e. No. XI and No. XII, it is distinctly superior to the latter, as being oriental and a good text, and at least the equal of No. XI, concerning which some details have not reached me which would allow closer comparison. It may be the equal of the renowned Bukh\u0101r\u0101 MS., but of this text only the high reputation is known, a reputation fully established in India amongst the early workers on the B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma in the nineteenth century, when there was talk amongst Elphinstone, Leyden, and Erskine of obtaining a copy from it.\n\nNo. X measures 7\u00bd inches by 4 inches; is bound in red leather, gold-lined; has been rebound; and has been worm-eaten both before and since the rebinding. It contains 382 folios, and on each page are 14 lines. It is written in Nast\u0101liq and by two hands, neatly and without appearance of haste, but the concluding pages are less neat and less leisurely than the great bulk of the work. There is no adornment of any kind in the MS.; there is no distinction in the handwriting such as marks the beautiful Turk\u012b T\u016bzuk (A.D. 1629\u201330) and its Persian rendering (A.D. 1638\u20139) of 'Ali'l-kashmiri. Mr. Alexander G. Ellis estimates the date of its transcription as being about A.D. 1700. The quality of the paper precludes the sixteenth century.\n\nThe obverse of the first folio of the MS. is inscribed with Kit\u0101b-i-b\u0101bar-n\u0101ma ba zab\u0101n-i-turki; with an Arabic press-mark (?) in pencil, \"3\u201316\"; an ink entry in English,\n\n\u00b9 I have collated it with Leyden and Erskine\u2014page by page or more, frequently. Twenty lines of L. and E. enclose fourteen (one page) of No. X, the average being somewhat less. With the exceptions, large and small, mentioned in the text, the copies are identical.\n\"S.R. 35,\" which is remarkably like Mr. Erskine's writing of about the same date (B.M. Add. 26,605); and one in Raqam\u2014pencilled and deleted\u2014\"35.\" On the reverse of the last folio is scribbled what may be \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93.\n\nOn the page bearing the title there appears also a seal, and this is impressed again on the last page of the text. It is that of the father or grandfather of Sir Salar Jung, an oblong with the inscription Mun\u012bru'l-mulk, A.H. 1206 (A.D. 1791). The second impression has been made in the space between the end of A.H. 935 and the beginning of A.H. 936, but nothing as to the date of transcription can be inferred from this interpolated position, because spaces similar to this one occur at the end of other years.\n\nUnder the lining-paper of the boards are sheets inscribed, as Mr. Blumhardt has kindly informed me, with shopkeepers' accounts in the commercial Nagari of Central India, of date about A.D. 1800. This date agrees with that on the seal, and is probably the approximate date of acquisition by Sir Salar Jung's ancestor, and of the repair and rebinding of the book.\n\nThe text opens with a plain bismill\u0101h, and, like the Elphinstone, but varying from Kehr, with the words, \"In the month of Ramzan.\" Even a cursory examination has shown me that its variants in proper names are useful both biographically and orthographically. Moreover, it gives in pure Turki some passages which are corrupt and alloyed, or pieced out with Persian in Kehr's text. It contains all that Leyden and Erskine gathered from the Elphinstone and their two Persian MSS., and over and above this, the concluding portion of A.H. 908, the longer account of Hindal's adoption, several short passages which are omitted in the Memoirs and the Persian sources, and the revenue account of India, set down, moreover, by an Oriental.\n\nNo. X is a veritable trouvaille. Its excellence and rarity claim reproduction in facsimile, since there are so very few texts of equal merit and volume that B\u0101bar's book might easily be lost for ever. At the present time Ilminski's imprint, the reproduction of a western and defective text, is only to be purchased as a rarity; and there is no complete\nTurk\u012b text accessible to students either in England or India. As is known to many of his friends, the late Mr. John Beames occupied the closing months of his life with work on the B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma, but there was no Turk\u012b text of critical value for his use more accessible than in St. Petersburg. He had heard with pleasure of the excellence of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, and I had hoped to enable him to use it, even in his invalid retirement, by a photographic reproduction which I desire to carry out.\n\nEvery MS. has its points of human interest. Here is one in No. X, a minor matter, but showing a thought of the scribe. Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012brz\u0101 is said by B\u0101bar to have had three daughters by Pasha Begam, but particulars are given of one only, the eldest. This silence as to the others seemed to me as unnatural as it was inconvenient, because one of the anonyma was, I believed, a wife of B\u0101bar. Now I find from No. X that its scribe, like myself, thought some further particulars were needed, for he has left a blank space where they should come in. (Cf. Memoirs, 30 : No. X, f. 27a.)\n\nHere is another and somewhat similar point. Mr. Erskine is fully borne out by No. X in his supposition (Mems., 230, l. 4 and n.) that B\u0101bar may have omitted the name which is missing here, for No. X (211b) has a space of about an inch where it should come in. There is another instance of this expectancy on the scribe\u2019s part that something would fill the blank. Or possibly in both cases the royal writing was illegible.\n\nA curious little variant, which may be due to reconsideration on B\u0101bar\u2019s own part, is contained in the narrative of Hind\u0101l\u2019s pre-natal adoption by M\u0101ham. Kehr has a long account of this, and includes in it a quaint taking of omens as to the sex of the coming child. No. X has the same account, minus the casting of the fates.\n\nNeither of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s notes occurs in No. X, which at the point where the Elphinstone contains the \u201cshaving passage\u201d runs on from \u201cRahmat pi\u0101da\u201d to the \u201csun in Aries.\u201d As has been already said, these notes appear in no Turk\u012b text examined by me, except the Elphinstone. There\nseem good grounds for leaving the *amratphul* note out of consideration here, for it is not known to us to be Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s, and it occurs only in the Elphinstone so far as we know. But the first of the notes attributed to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, the \u201cshaving passage,\u201d is of great interest in the genealogy of the Turki and Persian texts. It divides them into two branches, the Elphinstone and its descendants in Persian, and (as a minimum) the Kehr, with Ilminski\u2019s imprint and its French descendant, and the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n---\n\n**Errata in Notes, July, 1900.**\n\np. 450, l. 4, B.M. 16,623.

Sewell has dealt with the history of the kingdom of Vijayanagara, one of the most powerful empires that ever existed in India. In the lucid way which distinguishes all his works he has succeeded especially in throwing new light on the reign of Deva R\u0101ya II. There cannot be the slightest doubt now that this king began to reign in the year A.D. 1419, and died about 1443 or 1444. As regards his successor things are not quite so clear. Sewell says (p. 80), \"that at present it looks as though there had been a Deva R\u0101ya III. reigning from A.D. 1444 to 1449, but this point cannot as yet be settled.\"\n\nMay I draw your attention to a passage in the work of Kallin\u0101tha, the celebrated commentator on the Samgita-Ratn\u0101kara of \u015a\u0101r\u1e45gadeva. Kallin\u0101tha's work is entitled Kal\u0101nidhi, and has been edited by Pandit Mangesh Ramkrishna Telang in the \u0100nand\u0101\u015brama Series (Poonla, 1897). In the introduction to his commentary, after having described\nthe country in which he is living, our author continues (v. 6\u20139):\n\nBhogisthit\u0101 bhogavat\u012b ca nityam suparvaramy\u0101 divijasthal\u012bva |\npuriha vidy\u0101nagar\u012b cak\u0101sti tu\u1e45g\u0101tar\u0101\u1e45gair abhita\u1e25\npavitra || 6 ||\n\nEt\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101sti pra\u015bastapratibha\u1e6damuk\u016b\u1e6daprotaniryatnaniryadyad-\nratnajyothi\u1e25praval\u0101vanamsuacu\u1e6dul\u0101topat\u0101papratapah |\nkarn\u0101\u1e6d\u0101gh\u0101\u1e6dalak\u1e63m\u012bcaranaparilasatpauru\u1e63otkar\u1e63a\u015b\u0101li prau-\n\u1e0dha\u1e25 \u015br\u012bdevar\u0101j\u014d vijay\u0101npasuto y\u0101dav\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 vare\u1e47yah || 7 ||\n\nVi\u015bvambhar\u0101bh\u0101gyak\u1e5btvat\u0101r\u0101stastyasi putro ya\u015bas\u0101 pavitra\u1e25 |\nsa\u1e45g\u012btas\u0101hityakal\u0101sv abhij\u00f1\u0101\u1e25 prat\u0101pav\u0101n imma\u1e0dideva-\nr\u0101ya\u1e25 || 8 ||\n\nSudharmeva sabh\u0101 yasya samull\u0101sikal\u0101dhara\u1e25 |\ng\u0101ndharvagun\u0101gamabh\u012bra vidy\u0101dharavinodin\u012b || 9 ||\n\nI translate these verses without regard to the double meaning of some of the words:\n\n6. Resting upon the serpent, ever teeming with pleasures, beautiful in the happy distribution of its various parts, like unto a heavenly abode, shines yonder brightly the town of Vidy\u0101nagara, purified on all sides by the waves of the Tu\u1e45g\u0101.\n\n7. It was ruled by Prau\u1e0dha Devar\u0101ja, the son of king Vijaya, the best of the race of the Y\u0101davas, a hero whose incomparable valour, by vanquishing Karn\u0101\u1e6da, rose up even unto the feet of Lak\u1e63mi. In trembling glitter shone his majesty\u2019s crown of light\u2014a radiance reflected from the gems in the diadems of his noble adversaries\u2014as they bowed before him in submission.\n\n8. Prat\u0101pa Imma\u1e0di Devar\u0101ya was his son. In him was incarnate the welfare of the whole world. Steeped in glory, he was moreover deeply learned in the arts of rhetoric and of music.\n\n9. His audience hall was like unto the hall of the gods, radiant as the full moon, thronged with the choicest singers, graced even with the presence of the Vidy\u0101dharas.\n\n1 The reading of the manuscript G is the correct one.\n2 About the two different names of the town see Sewell, l.c., p. 19 and n. 2.\nIn these verses it is expressly stated that Prat\u0101pa Imma\u1e0di Deva R\u0101ya was the son of Deva R\u0101ya II., and the grandson of Vijaya. Further, he bears all the titles of a king, and to him, as to his patron and protector, Kallin\u0101tha is applying. Therefore Deva R\u0101ya III. must have ascended the throne after the death of his father, and must have been reigning when Kallin\u0101tha wrote his commentary. This statement is corroborated by an inscription found at Conjeeveram, dated A.D. 1449, and published by Hultzsch (South Indian Inscriptions, i, 110). It records a grant by a king called Vira Prat\u0101pa Praudha-Immadi-Deva R\u0101ya: his name is exactly the same as that ascribed to him by Kallin\u0101tha. I therefore think we are not only able but even obliged to assume that there must have been a Deva R\u0101ya III. reigning from A.D. 1444 till at least 1449.\n\nAs to the inscription found at Sr\u0101vana Belgola, dated A.D. 1446 and published by Kielhorn (Ind. Ant., xxv, 346), which relates to the death of a Prat\u0101pa Deva R\u0101ya, I am as little able to say anything as Sewell. That this inscription arouses suspicion on account of the remarkable style of its writing, Sewell has already pointed out.\n\nConcerning the inscription, dated A.D. 1476\u201377 and mentioned by Sewell (l.c., p. 97), in which a Praudha Deva of Vijayanagara occurs, it may not be quite impossible that it relates also to our Deva R\u0101ya III. We have, it is true, inscriptions which show that the other two sons of Deva R\u0101ya II. were on the throne, the one, Mallik\u0101rjuna, about A.D. 1452\u201362, the other, Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a I., about 1470. But either three brothers were reigning at the same time (which would not be impossible, considering the great extension of the kingdom), or, in consequence of the tempests and troubles which followed the death of Deva R\u0101ya II., the three brothers were struggling for the throne, and reigned at different times according to their changing fate.\n\nHowever this may be, it cannot be doubted that a Deva R\u0101ya III., a son of Deva R\u0101ya II., was in existence, and reigned from A.D. 1444 till at least 1449.\u2014Yours very truly,\n\nR. Simon.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nPHON\u00c9TIQUE ANNAMITE (DIALECTE DU HAUT-ANNAM).\nPar L. Cadi\u00e8re, de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 Paris. (Paris : Imprimerie Nationale, 1902.)\n\nThis appears as volume iii of the Publications de l'\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient, a series which promises to add so much to our knowledge of the language and antiquities of the Indo-Chinese peninsula. French Indo-China comprises, it is hardly necessary to say, the old countries of Tonkin, Annam (Cochinchina), and Cambodia. The Annamese language, which extends from the southern border of China to the frontier of Cambodia, is divided into three dialects: (1) the dialect of Tonkin, with its capital at Hanoi; (2) the dialect of Upper Annam (Haut-Annam), with its capital at Hu\u00e9; and (3) the dialect of Lower Annam (Bas-Annam), with its capital at Saigon. It is the second of these three dialects, the phonology of which is studied here by M. Cadi\u00e8re, who uses the term Haut-Annam, instead of the Haute-Cochinchine of the last century, the latter being now, he says, almost obsolete. He adds: \"I have chosen the title Dialecte du Haut-Annam, intending the expression to be taken generally as meaning the dialect spoken from Tourane to Vinh. Similarly, by Dialecte du Bas-Annam, I intend generally that which is spoken to the south of Tourane, as far as Cambodia; and by Dialecte du Tonkin, that which is spoken in the Tonkinese delta. With regard to the pronunciation of the city of Hu\u00e9 and of the Court, I have left that for subsequent consideration, on account of the small extent of country...\"\nover which it prevails, from its character which appears to me to be comparatively recent, and besides because it was worthy of separate treatment.\"\n\nThe ground being thus defined, the author further contracts its limits by explaining that his work is purely phonetic, and that he will not occupy himself, for the moment, either with vocabulary or with syntax, both of which are left to be treated apart. The book is divided into three parts, the first of which treats of vowel changes, the second of transformations of consonants, the third of modifications of tone. Changes of tone are at least as important as those of vowels or consonants, if not more so, in languages of Eastern Asia. Certain peculiarities of minor importance relating to the phonology of the dialect are relegated to an appendix.\n\nThe author, fearing that his method might give rise to the supposition that there was a certain known mother language, with dialects derived from it of which the degree of filiation was established, deprecates this idea, and is more inclined to admit, for the nonce, that the modern subdivisions of the language of Annam are the result of the simultaneous development of different dialects whose origins are unknown to us, still less their relative distances from a primitive mother tongue. Such terms he employs only for convenience, and they must not be taken in the precise and absolute sense which they have in Western languages, the descent of which is perfectly established.\n\nM. Cadi\u00e8re compares the sino-annamite pronunciation of Chinese characters with that of modern Chinese dialects, and says justly that further study, methodically prosecuted, of the comparative grammar of the two countries will throw more light on the origin of the language of Annam and its phonetic elements. It may be of interest to note the dictionaries used by him in his researches, which are: *Dictionarium annamitico-latinum*, editum a J. L. Taberd. Serampore, ex typis Marshman, 1838.\u2014*Dictionnaire annamite-fran\u00e7ais*. Tan Dinh (Saigon), imprimerie de la Mission, 1878.\u2014*Dictionnaire annamite-fran\u00e7ais*, par J. F. M. Genibrel,\nmissionnaire apostolique. Ibid., 1898.\u2014Dictionarium sinicum et latinum, auctore P. S. Couvreur, S. J. Ho Kien Fou, ex missione catholic\u00e6, 1892.\u2014A Chinese Dictionary in the Cantonese Dialect, by E. J. Eitel. Hongkong, 1877.\n\nThe first part of the book, devoted to vowel changes, is divided into two sections, the first section including such changes as are common to all languages, the second those peculiar to Annam called voluntary modifications, in which vowels are conventionally changed to avoid pronouncing the name of a grand personage, of the tutelary spirit of a village, of a deceased ancestor of the speaker, etc. Such conventional changes are confined to the vowels of syllables, neither consonants nor tones ever being modified for the purpose. Tones are of first importance in Annamese words; as an old French missionary wittily expresses it: \"Ne dites pas le mot, mais faites l'accent; cela suffit, vous serez compris.\" Tones are not pronounced in the same way in Upper Annam as in Cochinchina and in Tonkin; and the difference is declared to be greater between Hu\u00e9 and Saigon than between Hu\u00e9 and Hanoi. There are six tones in all, which are described in detail in the third part of the book, and graphically represented there by lines drawn upon a musical scale.\n\nThis is hardly the place for a minute analysis of the manifold phonetic changes characteristic of the dialect of Upper Annam. To those interested in the subject the book is available for a lucid and scientific exposition, presented with the clearness that distinguishes French scholarship.\n\nS. W.

(Paris: Leroux, 1901.)\n\nFurther India, or, as it is now generally called, Indo-China, is in many respects the reflex and counterpart of India proper. On its soil, amongst an indigenous population of\nmixed and alien origin, the Hindu civilization, imported in the early years of our era (or possibly even a few centuries earlier), struck root and flourished, underwent a peculiar development in adapting itself to local circumstances, and has left remarkable traces of its existence in a relatively large number of buildings, now for the most part in ruins, some of which are among the most magnificent specimens of architecture that Asia has produced.\n\nThe temples and palaces of Camboja rank second to none as regards the grandeur of scale and richness of detail displayed in their construction. Rediscovered, so far as the European world is concerned, within the memory of men still living, they have attracted the attention of archaeologists and architects by their antiquity and their highly artistic character, while the imagination is struck by the juxtaposition of such noble works with the sordid huts which suffice for the degenerate descendants of the mighty race that constructed them, and with the waste swamps and jungles by which they are surrounded.\n\nThe remains of the Cham architecture, though by no means on a level with those of Camboja, present, on a smaller scale of grandeur and with less perfection of detail, somewhat similar features. Both owe their inspiration largely to Indian models, and each may be taken to represent the highest artistic achievement of the race, a race in each case of alien origin, led into the paths of a civilization by Indian influence.\n\nThe sphere of this influence has undergone a notable contraction since the period when most of these works were constructed; it has been steadily suffering from the encroachments of the neighbouring Chinese civilization, which in the hands of the Annamese has spread from Tongking down the whole of the east coast of Indo-China, and has absorbed a large section of the territory that was formerly, in a sense, part of India. Moreover, the artistic inspiration has almost died out in these regions, and it is as illustrations of an irrevocable past and a departed splendour that these remains have for us a somewhat melancholy interest.\nThe present volume is a summary record of these monuments so far as French Indo-China is concerned, wherein they are classified first, with a short description of each, under the respective administrative divisions in which they are situated, and afterwards in an alphabetical list, with an indication of their positions on the several maps which the volume contains. These are five in number, viz., Northern and Southern Annam (for the Cham monuments), Northern and Southern Camboja (for the Cambojan ones), and a general map, on a smaller scale, of Eastern Indo-China, which, besides giving the position of the areas respectively covered by the other sheets, contains the situation of certain remains in the Laos country not included in them.\n\nThe items enumerated amount to between three and four hundred, and, of course, vary in importance from relatively insignificant remains of small isolated buildings to the wonderful specimens of palatial architecture already referred to. The work is confined to the remains which owe their inspiration to Indian influences, and expressly excludes the architecture of Annamese and Chinese origin. It is to be observed that, in a sense, it is incomplete, as it necessarily does not include the architectural remains lying outside the sphere of French influence, while a great part of the old Cambojan territories is now included in the kingdom of Siam (which, indeed, contains the finest of the Cambojan remains). The authorities have, however, been well advised to publish the results of their researches without waiting for their problematical completion at some uncertain future date.\n\nAn introduction by the author gives some information as to the administrative divisions under which the classification is made, the system of transcription adopted, and the meanings of certain frequently occurring native names. A preface by the director of the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient, under whose auspices the work appears, draws attention to the importance of the subject and to the amount of hard work which the compilation of the present\nsummary has involved. This last is obvious on the face of it, and it is clearly of the highest importance that these interesting monuments should be completely enumerated and accurately located. A good many of them have been described and illustrated elsewhere, but much remains to be done in this direction also; and it is to be hoped that in course of time a complete record of them will be made, which will enable their artistic value to be more generally appreciated than can be said to be the case at present.\n\nC. O. Blagden.\n\nTRANSLATION FROM URDU FOR ADVANCED STUDENTS, being fifty Urdu passages with Introduction, Notes, and Translation by C. M. Mulvany, M.A., B.Litt., Professor, Queen's College, Benares. (Allahabad: The Indian Press.)\n\nProfessor Mulvany, of Queen's College, Benares, has found time among his other duties to write a manual to assist his pupils in their English studies. Fifty extracts are given in Urdu, and of these a model English version is offered, with such grammatical notes as explain the variations between the two languages. It has often been seen that the trained philologist can show his special skill in whatever language, rich or poor in structure, dignified or undignified, which may be submitted to him. We might guess from his brilliant Oxford career that Professor Mulvany was an excellent Greek and Latin scholar. We cordially endorse all that he says of the value of a training in these languages. Donaldson, the Cambridge scholar, recommends in one of his books that a man about to translate a piece of prose into Latin should first read a corresponding piece in Latin, and on p. 4 Mr. Mulvany suggests that the same practice should be followed with English classics. We are afraid that natives can never be taught to shape their ideas in the English fashion, nor do we believe that any man can think in a language not his own, but Mr. Mulvany\nrightly hopes that by reading English prose, which has become saturated with Greek and Latin literature, the native tendency to bombast may be checked. The severity of the classics has assisted the seriousness which is natural to Englishmen. Here we are in direct opposition to the mobile and loquacious Asiatic. The remarks of Newman quoted by our author are very much to the point. We wish this excellent little work all possible success.\n\nMr. Mulvany is evidently quite alive to the errors commonly made by Indian students in translating from their mother tongue into English, and in English composition, and the rules and hints he provides for the guidance of those who speak Urdu are all that could be desired in respect of clearness and simplicity. We fail, however, to understand why the words *aisi ko\u2019t tadbiir*, on p. 8, may not be translated literally \u2018some such plan.\u2019 And we do not think Mr. Mulvany would be, under any circumstances, justified in rendering the word *h\u00e1l* (p. 7) by the English \u2018method.\u2019 Again, on p. 13, we find *agar ap bhi apn\u00e1-ko apn\u00e9 hath-se m\u0101rn\u0101 kare to bh\u00ed ky\u00e1 hog\u00e1*, where *apn\u00e1-ko* should be *apne-ko*, and *m\u0101rn\u0101* appears to be a misprint. Such errors, however, are few, and do not detract from the numerous excellences of the work. We would particularly draw attention to the rules on (1) the use of the personal pronouns; (2) questions; (3) indirect speech; (4) the infinitive: these are perpetual stumbling-blocks to an Indian student. We congratulate Mr. Mulvany on the excellence of his work, and trust we may regard this little book as but the first instalment of what he intends to give us. We would suggest, however, that he should give a little more attention to Arabic. Even a little Arabic would be found useful in his Urdu studies, and would serve to show that the corrupt English form Aladdin (i.e. *\u2018al\u00e1\u2019ud-d\u00edn*, \u2018the nobility of the religion\u2019) cannot be derived from the Arabic *\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u062f\u06cc\u0646\u0650* (if such a compound be possible), and that *abu\u2019l-hasan* and *nuzhatu\u2019l-aric\u00e1h* should be written *\u0646\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0647\u064f\u062a\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u0650* and *\u0646\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0647\u064f\u062a\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u0650*.\nThis is a valuable contribution to our scanty store of knowledge concerning a highly interesting people. The Chams, who once constituted the considerable kingdom of Champa (Camp\u0101 or Mah\u0101camp\u0101), whose metropolis Balonga is mentioned by Ptolemy, and whose greatness and outward magnificence are attested by Hiuen Thsang and Marco Polo, occupied for a dozen centuries or more a unique position as the eastern outpost of Indian civilization on the Asiatic mainland.\n\nTheirs was the borderland where that form of civilization struggled with its mighty rival and neighbour, the Chinese civilization represented by the Annamese, to which it yielded only after a succession of gallant but unavailing struggles. Shorn, one by one, of its outlying northern provinces, reduced after each defeat by successive annexations to a smaller sphere of action, the fierce but intermittent flame of the Cham national spirit, inherited from a Malayan ancestry, repeatedly burst out afresh and for a time seemed to retrieve these losses. In the end, however, the stolid persistence and harder stamina of the northern race prevailed over the fiery ardour of the south, and after the final fall of Cham national independence in 1471, the Annamese gradually ground the remnants into submission.\n\nAt the present day their descendants are little more than the shadow of a name; the glory of their splendid past is well-nigh forgotten, and the race is represented in its ancient seats by a few groups of poverty-stricken village communities; while the emigrant Chams who have settled in the neighbouring kingdom of Camboja, though more prosperous than their cousins of Annam, are even more out of touch with the old traditions of their race. At some period which is not clearly defined, probably about the fifteenth century, a portion of the nation was converted\nto Isl\u0101m, and among the Cambojan Chams that religion is now universal. Among the Chams of Annam, Hinduism of a sort still lingers on, mixed with elements of indigenous origin; and here, too, there are some followers of the Prophet, but their notions appear to be very far removed from the orthodoxy of the schools of Mecca. Their im\u0101ms, though occasionally possessing more or less corrupt copies of the Kor\u0101n, are unable to read Arabic, and can only repeat a few traditional formul\u00e6. It may, however, be doubted whether they are Shiites, as the author of the work under review seems inclined to suppose: *a priori* it is far more probable that, like most of their Malayan cousins, they are nominally Sunnis of the School of Sh\u0101fi\u2018i.\n\nIt is, however, the Hinduism of the Chams that for historical reasons has the best claim upon our regard, and here we have a most valuable contribution to the study of that religion, or, perhaps one should rather say, of what now represents it among the remnants of the Cham race. A very full account of their divinities, their priests and priestesses, their ceremonies and observances on special occasions, together with a large number of texts of the hymns, prayers, and ritual employed, make up the bulk of this volume. Only those who have themselves attempted to record the fragmentary relics of an almost extinct culture can have any conception of the labour which the collection of these materials must have involved. Their value from the point of view of the comparative study of religions, and particularly as specimens of a peculiar development or corruption of Hinduism, can hardly be overrated. To a great extent, however, this Hinduism is a mere veneer covering a mass of native folklore based on animism, worship of the powers of nature, serpent-worship, and what not, which invites comparison with more or less analogous ideas and usages scattered about in almost every quarter of the globe.\n\nThe texts, so far as they are Hindu in character, are Sivaite, and are written partly in the Cham language, partly in a jargon which appears to be Sanskrit corrupted\nby traditional repetition and quite unintelligible to those who use it, but which may still be capable of restoration by competent Sanskrit scholars basing their comparisons upon the better preserved texts of other Hindu rituals. The greater part, and especially the part which is in the Cham language, consists of elaborate rubrical directions; it embodies in some sort a ritualism run to seed, a symbolism of which the meaning has been entirely forgotten and swallowed up in the form. At the same time it may fairly be allowed that some of the hymns to the gods are not without a certain poetic grace and wild disordered beauty of their own. The high gods and goddesses of the Hindu Pantheon have become inextricably mixed up with local divinities of Nature or identified, after the fashion of Euhemerus, with deified kings and national heroes. Curiously enough, the mightiest of them all is of the female sex, P\u00f4 Yan In\u00f6 N\u00f6gar, the Great Goddess Mother of the Kingdom, who is supposed to represent Mah\u0101dev\u012b, and whom the Muhammadan Chams identify with our mother Eve.\n\nThe priests are chosen from a special caste and wear a peculiar dress; below them is a caste of ministers who perform subordinate functions, and in addition there are persons who may be described as lay assistants, not belonging to any particular caste, but initiated by their predecessors in office. The various sacrifices and lustrations in use are carefully described in this work, which is also illustrated by numerous representations of specimens of the sacred vessels and other objects used in connection with religion, of photographs of individual priests and other members of the Cham race, and of some of the original manuscripts from which most of the materials embodied in the book were derived. The frontispiece representing the temple of P\u00f4 Klo\u00f1 Garai at Phan-Rang and the image of the Great Goddess figured on a later page are of some artistic value as specimens of Hindu workmanship.\n\nIn addition to other ethnological information, the author devotes a chapter to the language of this highly interesting people, with specimens of the elaborate forms of the complex\nIndian alphabet in which that language is written. It should, however, be pointed out that his twice repeated assertion that the Chams are derived from Java is quite unwarranted by evidence, and probably entirely contrary to fact. As Professor Kern, of Leyden, demonstrated years ago, a comparative study of the great Malayo-Polynesian family of languages points to the probability that the centre of dispersion of that vast group was a large country occupying a coastline in South-Eastern Asia. It is almost certain that they are derived from Champa or its neighbourhood, not the Chams from them or their outlying islands.\n\nThe Cham language as it is written and spoken now, and, indeed, so far as it is on record in the inscriptions of the last thousand years or so, presents us with the curious picture of a mixed tongue made up of almost equal proportions of Malayan and Indo-Chinese (M\u00f4n-Annam) elements, overlaid with Sanskrit accretions. It is hard to say whether it should be classified with the Malayan or the M\u00f4n-Annam group, but, at any rate, the Malayan element in it cannot be derived from any of the existing Malayan sub-families. Besides possessing peculiarities of its own, it has features in common, now with the languages of the Sumatran, now with the Bornean, and occasionally with the Philippine group, which make it utterly impossible that it should have been derived from any one of them. In fact, its characteristics are so strongly marked that one is bound to infer its separate existence from a period coeval with the differentiation of the other Malayan languages of the western half of the Indian Archipelago; and it is entitled to be recognized as a separate entity in that family, so far as its Malayan constituents are concerned.\n\nIt may, perhaps, be worth noticing that one of its most striking peculiarities is its almost Indo-Chinese tendency towards a monosyllabic form, as a stepping-stone to which it tends (like AChinese) to throw the accent on the last syllable, while Malay almost invariably accents the penultimate. But in some cases this very peculiarity has preserved its words in a fuller and more archaic form than the Malay, so that\nthey certainly cannot be derived from the latter: thus, the final diphthongs which Malay, by strengthening the penultimate syllable, has attenuated to simple vowels, are retained in Cham, as they are to some extent in AChinese. Moreover, many old words which Malay has lost have survived in the continental language as part of its inheritance from the common Malayo-Polynesian mother tongue; the name of the Great Goddess furnishes three instances in point: p\u00f4 (lord or lady), yan (deity), and in\u00f6 (mother) are words which, though occurring in many of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, no longer exist as separate words in Malay, but are represented there by derivatives. In spite, therefore, of its admixture with alien elements, Cham offers a substantial contribution to the comparative study of the Malayan languages, and from this point of view deserves more attention than has hitherto been paid to it.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the French scholars, who now have the opportunity of rescuing the few remaining records of this nation which is now on the verge of being utterly absorbed by its stronger neighbours, will do so before it is too late. In the meantime one may express the recognition that is due to M. Cabaton for the valuable instalment which he has succeeded in preserving. It should also be stated that a very full bibliography of the literature of his subject, several indexes, and a table of contents add considerably to the utility of his present work, which by its appearance and style also does credit to its publisher.\n\nC. O. Blagden.\n\nTetraeuangelium Sanctum Juxta Simplicem Syrorum Versionem ad Fidem Codicum, Massorae, Editionum Denuo Recognitum, Lectionum Supellectilem, etc.\nBy Philip Edward Pusey, M.A., and George Henry Gwilliam, B.D. (Oxford, 1901.)\n\nThe extraordinary energy which is being expended at the present day upon the text of the Bible finds outlet in various\nways which need not be particularized here. Perhaps of most lasting importance, inasmuch as it is entirely free from subjectivity, is the labour which is now being spent upon new revisions of the text of the leading versions. Whilst Cambridge is undertaking the gigantic task of editing the text of the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament, based upon a collation which will supersede that of the historic Holmes and Parsons, Oxford is issuing smaller but equally valuable works, in the shape of new editions of the text of the Vulgate New Testament and of the Syriac Peshitta version of the Gospels.\n\nMany years ago the late Philip Edward Pusey, son of the renowned Professor of Hebrew at Oxford, set before himself the task of ascertaining whether the traditional text of the Syriac New Testament, first published at Vienna in 1555, might reasonably be taken to represent the text of the ancient Syrian Church. This text was made by J. A. Widmanstad, with the help of Moses of Mardin, from unknown sources, and, as it happens, all subsequent printed editions are practically copied from it. At that time, however, Syriac studies were almost unknown among Europeans, and it was not until the seventeenth century that the language really claimed the attention of scholars. Manuscripts, which in England at least were probably unknown before the first quarter of the seventeenth century, were collected from time to time, so that after a lapse of nearly three and a half centuries from the printing of the editio princeps, there was good reason to suppose that a critical collation of the numerous Biblical manuscripts might lead to the establishment of a somewhat different text.\n\nThe collations which were begun by Mr. Pusey were continued after his death by Mr. Gwilliam, under whose hands the plan of the whole work has considerably outgrown the original design. No fewer than forty-two MSS., more or less complete, were collated, the majority of them ranging from the fifth\\(^1\\) to the eighth century. They represent both\n\n\\(^1\\) The earliest dated MSS. belong to the middle of the sixth century.\nthe Jacobite and the Nestorian branches of the Syrian Church, and Mr. Gwilliam considers it not unlikely that some of the earliest may even represent the text of the undivided Church before the schism of 488\u20139.\n\nThe results attained after this laborious undertaking may at first sight appear hardly commensurate with the pains. Mr. Gwilliam has found that \"the text of the Editio Princeps of 1555 is almost identical with that current at the time when our MSS. were written . . . . the Peshitto version of the Gospels has not been corrupted in later times, but whatsoever variations it exhibits from the Greek date from a most remote antiquity. Our authorities are products of both the great schools of Syriac Christianity, while our most ancient copies connect our readings with those of the undivided Syriac Church.\"\u00b9\n\nThis conclusion is particularly interesting on account of the parallel between this, the first critical edition of the Peshitta Gospels, and the valuable collations of Hebrew MSS. of the Old Testament undertaken by Kennicott (1776\u201380) and De Rossi (1784\u201398). In this case, too, it was discovered that all our manuscripts practically represent one and the same text. This circumstance, however, is now known to have arisen from the fact that at a certain date (early in the Christian era) the text was fixed and all subsequent copies were conformed to it, whereas previously, as is proved by the Septuagint and by early quotations, a considerable number of variations must have existed.\n\nIn like manner there is reason to suppose (1) that this fixed Peshitta text is an artificial production; (2) that, like the Massoretic text, the present is only a stage, and that a relatively late one, in its history; and (3) that it can no more lay claim to be the original version than the so-called\n\n\u00b9 Professor Rendel Harris, from an examination of two fifth-century MSS. not included in Mr. Gwilliam's list, comes to the same conclusion as regards the fixed state of the text; see his article in the London Quarterly Review, January, 1902.\nMassoretic text which appears in our Bibles can claim to be the *ipsissima dicta* of the original writers.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe lasting importance of Mr. Gwilliam's work will be cordially recognized by scholars, and only those who have undergone the tribulation of collating manuscripts can appreciate to the full Mr. Gwilliam's wearisome task. To some his results may appear disappointing, even as the great expectations which had been formed respecting the result of a collation of Hebrew MSS. were considerably lowered. But the actual positive conclusions, now firmly established, are a lasting boon which scholarship owes to Mr. Gwilliam and to Mr. Pusey before him\u2014novel results would have meant novel unlooked-for problems, and of problems the Syriac text of the Gospels has already enough.\n\nThere are other valuable features associated with this edition to which attention must be drawn. The text is fully vocalized and pointed on the evidence of Massoretic MSS., and in the critical apparatus many interesting notes of interest to the grammarian and lexicographer are recorded from hitherto unpublished works. Special care has been paid to the Syriac system of Sections and Canons, which is now, for the first time, published in full. The division into paragraphs follows the most ancient witnesses, and as the editor remarks: \"These are often interesting, as showing the opinions of ancient scribes on the connexion of parts of the narrative.\"\n\nThe printing is clear and well-arranged, although we could wish that the numbers of the chapters were indicated more prominently, and on every page. The number of misprints is remarkably small, and the whole reflects to the highest degree upon the care of the editor and of the Oxford University Press, under whose auspices the work is published.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The date of the establishment of the Peslutta text has recently been ascribed with great probability to the time of Rabb\u016bl\u0101, Bishop of Edessa (411\u2013435 A.D.). Mr. F. C. Burkitt, to whom this is due, has proved conclusively that the *terminus a quo* must be subsequent to the Syrian father Ephr\u0113m (died 373). The *terminus ad quem* is probably barely a century later. (See Burkitt, \"St. Ephraim's Quotations from the Gospels,\" *Text and Studies*, 1901, vii, 2.)\nWe must not omit to mention one other valuable feature in the addition of a literal Latin translation for the convenience of theologians who ought to\u2014but generally do not\u2014read the \"mother of versions\" in the original tongue.\n\nS. A. C.\n\nMuhammad and his Power. By P. De Lacy Johnstone, M.A., M.R.A.S. (Edinburgh, 1901.)\n\nMuhammad is the only representative of the Semitic race of olden times to figure among the \"World's Epoch-makers,\" and in the account which Mr. Johnstone has written for this popular series of handbooks, both the inclusion of this great figure and the editor's choice of a writer are amply justified. So much has been written upon the subject that the small book before us could have been easily doubled or trebled in size, but Mr. Johnstone has carefully sifted the great mass of material at his disposal, and this concise account of his should have the effect of awakening in his readers an interest in Oriental history and thought. He has paid sufficient attention to every point of importance, and he has not failed to indicate here and there a few of the problematical questions upon which the last word has not yet by any means been said. In the opening chapters the writer has given us an all too short sketch of the land and people of Arabia before Islam, a particularly fascinating subject, a popular account of which for English readers is still a thing of the future. Not the least valuable feature of this portion of the book is the inclusion of extracts from Sir Charles Lyall's Ancient Arabian Poetry. On the other hand, it is to be regretted that the writer has failed at least to mention Robertson Smith among the authorities \"easily accessible in our own language\" (p. viii). He is one of the few scholars who have investigated at first-hand the environment of Islam, a knowledge of which is indispensable to the understanding of Mohammedanism, and is at the same time highly suggestive to students of other early Semitic literature. In conclusion, we venture to express the conviction that there\nis need\u2014great need\u2014for popular yet scholarly handbooks such as the one before us. This country's ignorance of and indifference to Eastern life and thought are, comparatively speaking, inversely proportionate to the immense political issues at stake.\n\nS. A. C.\n\nThe History of Hum\u0101y\u016bn (Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma). By Gul Badan Begum. Translated by Annette S. Beveridge, M.R.A.S. pp. 331. (London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1902.)\n\nThese memoirs of her own times by a Princess of the royal house of Timur possess an interest of a peculiar kind. As a daughter of Babar, a sister of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and an aunt of the great Akbar, the Princess was in a position to throw a vivid light on the events of the troublous times in which she lived. The monotonous seclusion of the harem was not so rigidly enforced in those days as in later times. The ladies of the royal family, dragged about from one place to another, at one moment honoured and feted, at another subject to indignities, imprisonments, and dangers, were far from being passive spectators of current events. They held interviews with the males of their family, and the principal nobles and men of mark\u2014veiled probably, but not hidden behind the curtains of the zenana. They formed shrewd judgments on men and events, and on many occasions exercised considerable influence. They were very numerous, these spirited and strong-minded Turk and Mughal women, and took the keenest interest in everything that happened. The Princess Gulbadan in particular shows herself a remorseless critic and an outspoken recorder of the actions of her relatives. It is this that gives her memoirs such a lively and piquant interest. Her narrative supplies those intimate details of private life which are wanted to clothe and make real the dry bones of official history. Her style, too, is simple and natural, a refreshing contrast to the turgid, pompous verbosity of courtly writers like the unendurable Abul Fazl and his fellows.\nSo far my father had himself written before his death. In the course of a conversation he had with me about the book he made several further comments to the following effect:\u2014\n\n\"The translation of Mrs. Beveridge is scholarly, and shows insight and sympathy with the subject. Her rendering of the Princess Gulbadan's words bring out well the womanly side of the writer, and her way of regarding the stirring events of her life, without any sacrifice of accuracy. The notes are very good and useful, especially those relating to the complicated relationship of the numerous personages whose names appear in the history. In the seclusion of the harem a clever woman like the Princess Gulbadan would acquire a large store of information on this subject, and in her old age would take a great pleasure in showing off her knowledge. This is not unknown among our own countrywomen. Mrs. Beveridge has conferred a great benefit on the student of this period of history by the care with which she has analyzed and tabulated the relationship of the different personages. The illustrations are good. The one of the Emperor Akbar is the only one I have seen which gives at all a living impression of that great man, and which conveys an idea of his ability. Mrs. Beveridge has added to the value of her work by making this available to European scholars. It is also a very especial advantage to have her excellent edition of the text printed in the same volume with the translation, and Mrs. Beveridge may be heartily congratulated on this sound piece of work, as useful as it is interesting.\"\n\nF. Beames.\n\nAssyrian Deeds and Documents recording the Transfer of Property, etc. By the Rev. C. H. W. Johns, M.A., Lecturer in Assyriology, Queens' College, Cambridge. Vol. III. (Cambridge: Deighton Bell & Co. London: G. Bell & Sons. 1901.)\n\nAssyriologists will welcome the Rev. C. H. W. Johns's third volume as they welcomed the first and second. Though\n\n1 The first volume was noticed in the J.R.A.S. in 1898, pp. 893\u2013897, and the second in 1901, pp. 600\u2013609.\nthe author of this book modestly refers to Assyriology as his 'hobby,' the seriousness and thoroughness with which he works at it would put to the blush the life-work of not a few. The energy with which he does his recreation (for it is as such that most people regard a 'hobby') will be appreciated by all, and this appreciation will be mingled with considerable admiration when it is realized that he is not the man of leisure which the present writer, and probably also many others, supposed him to be.\n\nThe third volume of Assyrian Deeds and Documents is of like bulk with its predecessors, and runs to 599 pages. It is devoted to \"Money loans, Legal Decisions, Deeds of Sale, Slave Sales,\" and includes lists of names of males, females, places, divinities, Greek, Latin, Biblical, classical, and north Semitic words and names, an index of Assyrian words and phrases, a list of ideograms, and a subject-index. The critical apparatus would therefore seem to be as perfect as possible.\n\nThe book is an elaborate and minute examination of documents which the author has published in the two preceding volumes, and contains, like them, a large amount of material, not only a basis for further research, but also exceedingly suggestive in itself.\n\nThere is no doubt that, for all who are interested in the history of trade and exchange, these volumes will be most useful. One of the points touched upon by these tablets is the question of interest, and Mr. Johns shows that even this, dry as the subject is, is not without its attractions. It would seem that, whilst interest on money lent in Babylonia was as a general rule one shekel upon every mane\u1e25 monthly ($1\\frac{3}{4}$ per cent. = 20 per cent. yearly), in Assyria it varied from that amount to as much as 150 per cent., though it happened now and then that less was arranged for, the tariff in one case being as low as half a shekel on $1\\frac{1}{3}$ mane\u1e25s (i.e. 100 shekels) per month, or about $1\\frac{1}{3}$ per cent. yearly. This, of course, was a merely nominal rate, such as might be arranged between friends.\n\nAll the sections of Mr. Johns's work are discussed with\nthe same minuteness, and also with the same acuteness, as that referred to above. Another point dealt with is the many and seemingly inconsistent ways of writing recurrent words and phrases (pp. 26 ff.), and the question naturally arises whether in some cases they may not be due either to ignorance or to carelessness on the part of the scribes. Many of the variants, however, seem to be due to the Assyrian dialect \u2014 the peculiarities of pronunciation of Assyro-Babylonian current in Assyria. Judging from the examples which the tablets published by Mr. Johns contain, Assyrian pronunciation differed, especially in the matter of the vowels, from that of Babylonia. In the case, for example, of the forms of the word nad\u0101nu, 'to give,' vowel-harmony seems to come into play. Thus, when the termination is i, the interior vowel is sometimes i (iddini), and when it is u, forms with u as interior vowel are found (iddunu, idunu). Iddan, idan, iddanuni, iddinuni, iddinnumi, etc., also occur. In the classical form the proper vowel is in all cases i (iddin, iddinu, iddinuni, etc.), and whether the scribes may have been influenced sometimes by other forms of foreign (west Semitic) origin, such as those of nath\u0101nu (\u05e0\u05b7\u05ea\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc), must at present remain undecided.\n\nThat west-Semitic influence was strong among the trading population may be gathered from the fact that, as the author remarks, all the names containing the element \u0101bd\u016b, 'servant' (the Assyro-Babylonian form is \u0101rd\u016b), were probably Syrian, and the number which he gives is sufficiently numerous. That such names indicated in many cases the nationality of the bearer has long been my own opinion, and to the list of those quoted by Mr. Johns many more may in all probability be added.\n\nThe number and the diversity of the foreign names, or names of foreign form, in the contract-tablets of Assyria, are probably greater in proportion than in the documents of the same class found in Babylonia. How this is to be explained is not quite certain. There is no doubt that in the earlier ages Babylonia was more resorted to by persons of foreign birth than most other trading centres, and the tradition of the\nconfusion of tongues there is probably due to that fact. As time went on, however, Assyria increased in importance, and though Babylonia did not in any way diminish, the large increase which undoubtedly took place in her population must have made the foreign element much less conspicuous, and spread it over a much larger extent of territory. For the same reason, it is probable that the percentage of Babylonian trade records which have been preserved to us is much smaller than in the case of Nineveh, cut off in the midst of her prosperity, at a time when \"great Babylon\" had still some years to wait before she reached the zenith of her power and the plenitude of her population, and after that several centuries before she ceased to be.\n\nThe presence of strange names of divinities, such as \u0160uriha, \u1e24aldi, Zirpanitu (so, not Zarpanitu, according to the phonetic spelling, systematically ignored by the German school), and others, implies that not only native gods, but those of the nations or districts around were also worshipped. In the case of the divinity \u0160uriha, whose name occurs in that of the personal name \u0160uriha-Aa, we have an example of the identification of one god with another\u2014\"\u0160uriha is Aa\"\u2014exhibited by so many of the names of this district and period. Its composition is upon the model of such names as Ya-Dagunu, \"Jah is Dagon,\" and others.\n\nIn general Mr. Johns's analysis of the inscriptions of which he treats is very close, and is on that account of all the greater value. To take an instance which is not of the most striking, he refers to and discusses (p. 177) all the cases where the name Nin\u00e2a or Nin\u00fbaa, 'the Ninevite,' occurs. It is spelled phonetically, as the name of a witness (thrice), as the name of a slave, and as that of a buyer. It is written AL Ni-nu-a-a as the name of a witness from Kurai; the form AL NINA-KI-a-a contains it, and its bearer was a sak \u0161arri (? 'king's captain') and buyer in four cases. A form without the KI is the name of a borrower in 681 B.C.; a witness and \u1e25azanu in another case, a witness in a third case, and occurs also as a specimen-name. The form NINA-a-a is the name of a rab bar\u00fb, b\u00eal t\u00eami, B.C. 649, and\nwe have further NINA-KI-a-a as the name of a buyer and sak \u0161arri three or four times, and as a \u0161a \u0161ep\u0101 once. I have not given Mr. Johns's references, but in every case the student is able to find what he wants. The question naturally arises whether it would not have been better to relegate all these detailed descriptions to a classified list of names, accompanied by the original characters. It will easily be understood from these details that the author does not write for the public, but for students. For those who are not specialists, it may be here mentioned that all the above forms, notwithstanding their diverse writing, are to be read simply Nin\u016baa or Nin\u0101a.\n\nLike the contract-tablets of Babylonia, material for biographies of the people mentioned may easily be obtained, though the details are much scantier and the number of instances much more rare. Such biographies are naturally rather interesting, and bring home to the student the reality of the life in the East revealed by those tablets of so many hundreds of years ago. \"If we cared to adopt the popular style of some Assyriologists,\" the author says, \"we might easily write up a 'story of an Assyrian corn-dealer,' and even perhaps work in a few Jews into the business.\"\n\nUnscientific as it may be, however, Mr. Johns cannot resist giving a very interesting account of the career of one Ba\u1e2bi\u0101nu, who plays a prominent part in barley-dealing from 704 to 667 B.C. Loans of barley and corn were his principal transactions, but he also appears as a witness to other documents, and sometimes has to do with slaves, and also with money-lending. His death is mentioned in a letter, from which it would appear that at the time of his departure for the abode of his god he was fairly well off in this world's goods.\n\nFrivolous as it may seem to indulge in these biographical reconstructions, such work is not only interesting, but also useful. It gives us the means, now and then, of deciding dates when direct statements are wanting, and other useful information for scientific research may also be obtained. Indeed, one may go so far as to say, that when an alphabetical\nlist of names of Assyrians and Babylonians mentioned in the various tablets has been drawn up, with dates, short biographical notices, and references, we shall have much useful material not only for verifying dates, but also for controlling translations, and throwing light on the obscure bypaths of ancient Oriental history in many ways which can only be guessed at present.\n\nThis is, in fact, one of the reasons why Mr. Johns's volumes upon the contract-tablets of Assyria are so valuable. The modern student, moreover, desires not only history and philology; he wishes also to know the aims, ambitions, thoughts, feelings, desires, and prejudices of the ancient personages revealed to him in these tablets during their earthly pilgrimages. The dry bones of chronology, philology, and history are of prime importance, but there is something of scientific value even in the human interest attached to these documents.\n\nSo, for his book, for the many interesting things which it contains, for the minuteness of his examination of these comparatively monotonous texts, every Assyriologist will render to Mr. Johns his sincerest thanks. The opportunity which the author has had of putting together all the materials bearing upon his branch of the subject enables him to suggest meanings, or further and more precise renderings, of words hitherto untranslated or doubtful; chronology, law, manners and customs, the state of society during the period treated of\u2014these and many other things receive new light. But such work is not easy, as may be judged from the uncertainty which attends research and its results, even when everything possible has been said and done.\n\nT. G. Pinches.\n\nThe India of Aurangzeb (Topography, Statistics, and Roads). By Jadunath Sarkar, M.A. (Calcutta: Bose Brothers, 1901.)\n\nFor one reason, if for no other, this work should be welcomed and commended. It is, so far as I know, the\nfirst attempt by an English-educated Indian to deal with the modern history of his own country in the critical and scientific spirit. Any other works that I know are mere compilations, as often as not taken from the books of European writers. Mr. Jadunath Sarkar has gone instead to the original sources, qualifying himself for dealing with them by first acquiring a knowledge of Persian.\n\nCompared with the rich archives of modern European states, India of the Mahomedan period is poor in material. But there can be no question that, whatever their defects, the histories and chronicles still extant present a very extensive field for the labour and self-devotion of many scholars. The settling of texts, the translation into English, the annotation and critical examination of these chronicles appear to be tasks admirably suited to the bent of the Indian mind, its patience and its love of detail. Let us hope that Mr. Jadunath Sarkar may continue the task that he has so well begun; and that his example may stimulate some of his fellow-graduates to similar undertakings.\n\nThe work before us consists of (i) a translation of the Khul\u0101\u1e63at-ut-taw\u0101r\u012bkh of Suj\u0101n R\u0101e, the portion relating to topography, about one-fifth of that work, pp. 1\u2013123; (ii) an abstract of the topographical chapters of the Chah\u0101r Gulshan of R\u0101e Chatarm\u0101n, giving an account of Hindust\u0101n and the Dakhin, and of the routes throughout India, pp. 123\u2013178. Prefixed to these two texts there is an Introduction of ninety-six pages summing up the author's conclusions on the area, the revenue, the topography, and the routes of the Mogul Empire.\n\nThe Khul\u0101\u1e63at-ut-taw\u0101r\u012bkh is a work with considerable pretensions to literary style, and in that respect is far superior to the Chah\u0101r Gulshan, which reads more like a set of rough notes than a finished work. The translation of the Khul\u0101\u1e63at is fairly well done, though the point of some of the poetry seems to be rather missed in the renderings given. In dealing with the Chah\u0101r Gulshan, Mr. Sarkar appears to me to have been less successful, especially in the road lists. In Persian texts names of places (if you do not\nknow them already) are notoriously difficult to decipher and verify. In the present instance, Mr. Jadunath Sarkar was handicapped by working on a single manuscript text. I have not been able to find time for the minute collation that I intended, but so far as I have gone I find that my manuscript gives numerous variants and discrepancies, both in the revenue figures and in the names of the stages in the routes. There is no space to enter here on these details, and I will take other means of communicating them to the author. One excellent point is the frequent reference to modern atlases and gazetteers and the works of European travellers. Some European scholars still betray a strange reluctance to avail themselves of the admirable maps published by the Indian Survey.\n\nAs for the revenue statistics, I fear that Mr. Sarkar, not being a revenue official, hardly realizes the uncertainties that are latent in all the records he treats of. I doubt if Mr. Edward Thomas made this preliminary point sufficiently clear. Again, in themselves, as a matter of formal arithmetic, the tables are defective; the detailed figures as often as not do not, when added up, agree with the total given, and the figures themselves are often so badly written as to be difficult to decipher. But apart from these formal defects, which Mr. Sarkar himself points out, the statements are a very uncertain foundation on which to build. We do not know with certainty whether the sums shown in them are (1) the *jama-i-k\u0101mil*, that is, a mere assumed or standard revenue; or (2) the *jama-i-w\u0101j\u012bb\u012b*, the actual demand of a particular year; or (3) the *jama-i-was\u016bl\u012b*, the actual receipts of some one year. Under the last two heads we rarely have the actual year stated, and thus do not know whether it was a normal or an exceptional harvest. And if we use the figures for comparison with present-day revenue collections, it must not be forgotten that the Mogul accounts show net receipts, after the deduction of local expenses, while ours are gross receipts, and all our disbursements are brought to account separately *per contra*. If Mr. Jadunath Sarkar devotes further labour to the subject, as I think he may well\ndo, he will find that there are three, if not four, other sets of statistics, quite independent of those he has already made use of, which might be incorporated in his statistical tables.\n\nIn conclusion I will note some of the leading points which appear to me to be doubtful, or to require further elucidation. On p. xvi., ch\u0101t\u016bras should be ch\u0101r\u016bs, the bambu poles or sticks carried at the head of the processions in question (see Platts' Dictionary, 462). It is not quite true (p. xviii) that the historical part of the Chit\u0101r G\u0101th\u0101 is of no value; there are one or two statements about the reigning sovereign, \u0100lamg\u012br II., which are not found elsewhere; so also, it is the only authority for the account of Aj\u012bt Singh, son of Guru Gobind Singh. On p. xxii., the first appearance of the Mahra\u1e47\u1e6das north of the Nerbada is put in 1737, which is many years too late, and by inference we are told that the Panj\u0101b had been added to Akbar's S\u0101l\u0101r Akh\u0101ds in 1751. Instead of saying this it was added to Nerbada S\u0101l\u0101r in 1739, governed temporarily by Akbar, and then finally by the mahra\u1e47\u1e6das in the Agara and Chit\u0101r G\u0101th\u0101s.\nThe 'Dokon' of p. xlix and p. 32 represents, I suppose, of the text, which should be read 'Deoganw,' otherwise 'Dog\u0101m' (see an interesting account of the mint there by Dr. W. Vost, Indian Medical Service, J.A.S. Bengal for 1895, part i, pp. 69\u201381). On p. lxix, line 16, Kurdezi ought, I think, to be read Gardezi, from Gardez, a place in Afghanistan. It is the appellation of a class of Indian Sayyads, see Elliot (Supp. Gloss., p. 447); and on the same page, line 24, 'west' surely ought to be by the map 'east' of Multan, though the mistake is probably due to Suj\u0101n R\u0101e, as the Ellis MS. of the Khul\u0101\u1e63at has the words Kh\u0101car-r\u016byah-i-Mult\u0101n. On p. 10 it would be well to give the meaning and derivation of the epithet k\u0101ki attached to the name of the saint Khw\u0101jah Qutb-ud-d\u012bn, Bakht\u012b\u0101r. I believe it comes from kak, the name of a cake or biscuit offered at his shrine. As for the territory of Bhadaur (p. 26) not being identified, it will be found in the B\u0101h Pin\u0101hat parganah to the east of Agrah city, and south of the Jamnah (see a long account of the Bhadauriyah r\u0101jahs in Elliot, Supp. Gloss., pp. 75\u201380).\n\nThe doubtful passage of the Khul\u0101\u1e63at on p. 42 reads thus in the manuscript belonging to Mr. A. G. Ellis: Ba khushki ba sing\u0101san raevand; bar, far\u0101z-i-\u0101n jihat-i-b\u0101rish o t\u0101bish niz s\u0101yah ba-s\u0101zand. The note as to the chaudhri on p. 50 should read 'headman of a parganah,' not of a 'village.' Under M\u0101lwah, p. 55, line 14, following the Ellis MS., for 'Numan' read 'Diw\u0101s,' and for the river 'Tawa' read 'Narbad\u0101.' On p. 61, is not porah the common word p\u016brah, a hamlet, the diminutive of p\u016br, a town? The patched gown or khirqah, p. 76, line 15, is, of course, the robe of office conferred on admission to a mendicant order, and the dispatch of it to Shekh Far\u012bd-ud-d\u012bn was a token that the spiritual succession had been transmitted to him.\n\nIn the abstract of the Chah\u0101r Gulshan I note one or two variants of importance. On p. 122, for 'mela of the Ganges,' read 'mela of K\u0101lk\u0101 J\u012b,' a well-known temple south of modern Dihl\u012b. As to Sark\u0101r Barhar, No. 5 on p. 136, might it not be the Tarhar mentioned on p. 323\nof Elliot's \"Supplemental Glossary\"? In my MS. the word is plainly written 'Burh\u0101npur'! The conjecture in the note on p. 140 is borne out by my MS., which has the word ser; but ser-h\u0101\u1e63il simply means 'very productive.'\n\nI have said enough to show that Mr. Sarkar's work is of a very meritorious nature, but if it is to be perfected he should keep it constantly by him, amending and altering it as his researches extend and his materials accumulate. We shall look for and welcome the other works announced as in preparation. But we beseech him on the next occasion not to forget an index, without which any work of this kind is nearly useless.\n\nWM. IRVINE.\n\nMEMOIRS OF MAHARAJA NUBKISSEN BAHADUR. BY N. N. GHOSE. (Calcutta, 1901.)\n\nThe Sobha Bazar family has been exceptionally fortunate in finding such a competent writer as Mr. N. N. Ghose to undertake the biography of its founder, Maharajah Nubkissen. The Rajah was born about 1732, being the third son of one R\u0101m Charan, ak\u0101yasth, who had moved from his home near Murshid\u0101b\u0101d to M\u016brg\u0101cha, a parganah close to Calcutta, upon appointment as a q\u0101n\u016bngo. Nubkissen was probably born in Govindpur, one of the three villages now merged in Calcutta. Apparently he was left to fight his own battle in life; he began to earn his living early, at the age of 18, as Persian munshi to Warren Hastings. In 1757 he was employed by Clive, and afterwards rose rapidly in the English Company's service. Finally, in 1767, he was made Political Banyan, or the chief native servant of the Government. He retired from public life in 1782, and died at his house in Calcutta on the 22nd November, 1797, full of years and honours.\n\nMr. Ghose's subject inevitably introduces us to many often-debated points in Anglo-Indian history\u2014Nubkissen's loan to Hastings, the prosecution and execution of Nandkum\u0101r, the Bardw\u0101n saz\u0101wal\u012b, and so forth. On most of these\nhe takes a fairly impartial attitude. Nandkumar, as he evidently thinks, got no more than his deserts. As to the matter of the loan of three lakhs to Hastings, it would have been better if a bond had been executed in the usual way when the money was accepted. At the same time, apart from the turgid rhetoric of Burke, there is nothing to prove corrupt intention. No one, so far as I know, denies that Nandkumar was a man with a very bad record; still, that fact, as one easily perceives, is no proof that he committed forgery in the particular instance. But he was elaborately tried before a jury, which probably came to a correct finding. With the actual course of this trial Hastings could not interfere, and to that extent cannot be made responsible; it might have been better, looking to the novelty of the death penalty for that crime, if Nandkumar had not been hung; but here, too, Hastings is apparently not to blame, for he would have sent the prisoner's petition to the judges if Francis and the others had not outvoted him (p. 134). Hastings disliked Nandkumar, of that there is little doubt; probably he was not sorry that the man was prosecuted; but in spite of all the research devoted to the subject, nothing in the shape of act or word involving him has been discovered. Nubkissen seems to have given his evidence with some reluctance. I do not believe that this was mere finessing, meant to produce all the more deadly effect. In such matters the simplest explanation is generally, in my experience, the safest and soundest. Nubkissen was, I think, really reluctant to give evidence incriminating a Brahman, but what he did say was the truth, as he believed it.\n\nModern Indians are somewhat unfortunate in the types that they have chosen as national heroes: the Mahrattahs with their Shivaji, a robber chief of genius; the Bengalis, with Nandkumar (p. 104), a man who ended on the scaffold a life of intrigue and deceit, his last crime being the mean one of forgery.\n\nAs for Mr. Ghose's view that the services of Nubkissen have been overlooked by the English, in fact that Indian\nwork is always ignored by us, we would remind him that this injustice (so far as it may be truly alleged) is not confined to India or the English. Nowhere do the working subordinates obtain the recognition that is so often their due. In Nubkissen's case, moreover, he got all that he sought for, power, wealth, and titles; and I should be very much astonished to find that he ever looked on himself as a slighted or neglected man. By the custom of his caste, observed through thousands of years, he was born to earn his living by his pen in the service of others; and it seems a mere modern misinterpretation of the then conditions to picture him as a conscious patriot working for the redemption of his native land. One master was to him as good as another; it was a question of personal advantage. Like most other Indians, he faithfully served the side that employed and paid him.\n\nThe position of the Indian in the employ of the Anglo-Indian Government has gone through several phases; before Cornwallis, after Cornwallis, under Lord William Bentinck, and since the Mutiny, each of these periods marks a different stage in the position of officials of Indian race. At present a higher official morality is preached in native society and to a great extent practised. Irregular gains have nearly ceased; existence has to be maintained on pay which, although liberal enough, does not permit the honest acquirement of wealth. The money rewards having diminished by the loss of unavowed receipts, something must be substituted, and Indians now claim, fairly enough, increased public recognition and more equality with Europeans in power and position. They are no longer content, as of old, to be the power behind the throne, having great influence and little responsibility.\n\nMr. Ghose, on p. 123, contests the justice of Macaulay's assertion that the Indian is peculiarly ready to turn upon a man directly he has fallen from power or favour. The metallic brilliance of Macaulay's style produces too often the effect of exaggeration or even untruth. In this instance, however, was he so very far wrong? My own experience,\nreinforced by that of my contemporaries, could furnish me with innumerable instances of the same habit of mind, of course on a smaller scale and in regard to more trifling matters. But Mr. Ghose may console himself under the imputation against Indians by the reflection that the same readiness to pander to kings and crowds, in their fickleness, is far from unknown in other parts of the world.\n\nAs for the late Professor Seeley's paradoxes, Mr. Ghose would do well not to be fascinated too much by their inviting speciousness. Of Seeley's two assertions, (1) that the English conquered India without intending it and (2) that the Indians conquered it themselves for the English, neither is worth anything. Sir Alfred Lyall has already sufficiently disposed of the first half of the theory. As to the second, I would ask Mr. Ghose, who is, so far as I can judge, an exceedingly fair and open-minded man, how it happens that for over a hundred years (1757 to 1857) the side the English were on invariably won? The inference is sufficiently obvious\u2014nay, inevitable. It reminds me of the old dispute between the organ-blower and the organist; the first supplies the material force, but the second plays the tune. Both are necessary, but what result would there be without the organist? In a sense the Indians did conquer India for us; we led and they fought. But for any effectual purpose, either of history or present-day politics, what useful deduction can be drawn from that admission? None, so far as I can see.\n\nOne statement of fact struck me as erroneous. On p. 44 Mr. Ghose says, \"After consulting him (Nubkissen), Clive reinstated Jaffer Aly Khan as subadar and Muzuffer Jung as naib subadar.\" If we consult the volume of \"Treaties and Engagements\" (4to, 1812) we find that the Treaty of Reinstatement, dated the 10th July, 1763, bears the signatures of Henry Vansittart and his councillors. Mir Ja'far died on the 5th February, 1765, while Clive did not land in Calcutta until May, 1765 (Marshman, \"History,\" i, 307). Thus Clive could not possibly have reinstated M\u012br Ja'far.\n\nMr. Ghose, on p. 51, suggests that the Emperor Sh\u0101h\n\u0100lam made a very bad bargain by the grant of the Dew\u0101ni to the Company. Had he not, on the contrary, considerable reason to be \"pleased\" with the transaction? For forty years the Dihli Court had seen very little money from Bengal, and for at least twenty years none at all, beyond an occasional bribe. In short, Sh\u0101h \u0100lam conferred an office over which he had not the least power or control, in exchange for the very substantial tribute of twenty-six lakhs of rupees annually. Evidently he had a predilection for such one-sided bargains. In 1774 he offered the Province of Sind, first to the French and then to the English, in return for military protection at Dihli. This can be seen in Mr. Emil Barbe's \"Le Nabab Ren\u00e9 Madec\" and in the pamphlet of J. Morrison, \"generalissimo of the Armies of the Great Mogul\" (London, 1774). After Sind was ceded to N\u0101dir Shah in 1739 the Moguls had exercised no authority there.\n\nIn the English documents quoted there are several words which would have been useful additions to Mr. Crooke's new edition of Yule and Burnell's Glossary\u2014Pooneah (p. 79), the formal commencement of rent or revenue collections; Connah Barry (id.), a house enclosure; Kauridge (p. 81), land excluded at settlement; Jeriff (p. 87), Zeriff (p. 89), a word not traced, apparently some kind of account on estimate; Cullundaun (p. 101), pen-case or qalam-d\u0101n.\n\nNubkissen was a devout and orthodox Hindu, but at the same time a most generous benefactor to both the Christians and the Mahomedans of Calcutta. On the whole, he was a man of most estimable character, endowed with considerable ability and savoir-faire, who played his part in important events with great credit to himself and his country. Mr. Ghose's task in bringing together the documents and setting them forth has been well done, and he deserves much commendation for the satisfactory book he has produced.\n\nWm.

Now, however, he has been so long with us, we have become so fully acquainted with his characteristics, we know so well how admirably suited he is for the duties he has to discharge, that I think it would\nbe quite superfluous to do more than formally to propose his re-election, which I have now the honour to do.\n\nSir Charles Lyall, Vice-President, seconded the proposal, which was carried unanimously.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Marks,\nMr. Maung Tha Hnyin,\nMr. Edmund Forbes, and\nMr. Kishan Singh\n\nhad been elected members of the Society.\n\nSir M. E. Grant Duff being obliged to leave, the chair was then taken by Sir Charles Lyall, and Dr. Thornton, in the absence of the Secretary through illness, read the following Report of the Council for 1901:\n\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1901.\n\nThe Council regrets to report the loss by death or retirement of the following thirty-three members:\n\nThere have died\u2014\n\nMr. F.

The total number of members on the 1st of January of each of the last fourteen years is as follows:\n\n| Year | Members |\n|------|---------|\n| 1889 | 432     |\n| 1890 | 437     |\n| 1891 | 450     |\n| 1892 | 459     |\n| 1893 | 476     |\n| 1894 | 493     |\n| 1895 | 492     |\n| 1896 | 523     |\n| 1897 | 524     |\n| 1898 | 532     |\n| 1899 | 553     |\n| 1900 | 551     |\n| 1901 | 566     |\n| 1902 | 577     |\nThe progress it will be seen, though small, has been fairly kept up. The average yearly increase, in spite of numerous losses each year, is about ten; and the total increase is 145. The general financial position of the Society shows an increase of the yearly fund available for the work of the Society amounting, in the same period, to about \u00a3200, and in this connection the following table will be of interest:\n\n| Year | Annual Subscriptions | Sale of Journal | Total Receipts | Total Expenditure |\n|------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|\n| 1888 | 575                 | 47             | 1177          | 1087             |\n| 1889 | 535                 | 119            | 1130          | 1339             |\n| 1894 | 574                 | 185            | 1280          | 1260             |\n| 1895 | 570                 | 230            | 1284          | 1172             |\n| 1896 | 570                 | 193            | 1318          | 1188             |\n| 1897 | 578                 | 188            | 1286          | 1159             |\n| 1898 | 612                 | 224            | 1341          | 1285             |\n| 1899 | 628                 | 202            | 1275          | 1330             |\n| 1900 | 622                 | 205            | 1290          | 1230             |\n| 1901 | 652                 | 205            | 1391          | 1328             |\n\nThe principal entry on the expenditure side is, as usual, for rent (including under that head rates and taxes). It amounts this year to \u00a3478 17s. 8d., as against a yearly average of about \u00a3400. The difference is caused by an unusually heavy expenditure of \u00a366 18s. 2d. on repairs, rendered necessary by the terms of our lease. Since its foundation the Society has been compelled to spend no less a sum than about \u00a335,000 on rent, rates, and taxes. Other learned societies of equal standing to the Royal Asiatic are relieved by Government from any expenditure for these purposes; and the Council ventures to express the hope that this Society may one day be placed, in this respect, on an equality with the other societies referred to. It is somewhat remarkable that a Society whose work is so intimately connected with our imperial interests in the East should have been so long left out in the cold. The removal of the London University to the Imperial Institute rendered\navailable the premises till then allotted to it by Government in Burlington House; and the Council then made endeavours to get this neglect remedied. Those endeavours were, unfortunately, without success. But the point has not been lost sight of, and the Council will move again in the matter whenever an opportunity shall present itself.\n\nThe gross receipts this year are larger than the Society has yet been able to show; and the balance of receipts over expenditure works out at \u00a3158 11s. 3d. This is partly due to the fact that a cheque for \u00a395 paid, on account of expenses on the Journal, in December, was not presented to the Society's bankers till January, and must therefore appear in next year's accounts. The balance-sheet for this year accordingly states that the printing account for the Journal only covers three numbers instead of the usual four, which were actually issued. Had this cheque been presented in December the expenditure on the Journal would have been therefore \u00a3313 instead of \u00a3218, and the balance of receipts over expenditure only \u00a363 11s. 3d. Out of this and previous balances the Council has invested \u00a3200 in the purchase of \u00a3198 5s. 4d. in 3 per cent. Local Loans Stock, and has placed \u00a3162 15s. on deposit at the Society's bankers. The manner in which the Council proposes to deal with this surplus is shown in the next paragraph of this Report.\n\nDuring the year under review the series of Asiatic Monographs, the establishment of which was announced in the last report, has been much under consideration by the Council. The scheme has now been fully started; and arrangements have been made for the publication of the following monographs, each of which is a distinct contribution to our knowledge of the subject dealt with:\n\n(1) Gerini (Major G. E.). Researches on Ptolemy's Geography of the Far East.\n\n(2) Winteritz (Dr. M.). Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Royal Asiatic Society's Library, with an Appendix by Mr. F. W. Thomas.\nANNIVERSARY MEETING.\n\n(3) HIRSCHFELD (Dr. H.). New Researches into the Composition and Exegesis of the Qoran.\n\n(4) STRONG (Professor S. A.). The History of Jakmak, Sultan of Egypt, by Ibn 'Arabshah.\n\n(5) LE STRANGE (Guy). Description of Persia and Mesopotamia in the year 1340 A.D., from the Nuzhat-al-Kulub of Hamd-Allah Mustawfi, with a summary of the contents of that work.\n\nIf funds should permit of the series being carried on, in future years also, by the publication of such results of original research, it will rank on a par with the similar series brought out (independently of their respective journals) under the auspices of the Asiatic societies in France, Germany, Holland, and Russia; and it will be a considerable step forward in accomplishing the work which our Society was founded to do. But the initiation of this series has only been rendered possible by the gradual increase of the Society's income; and its future depends on that increase being maintained.\n\nIn noticing the commencement of this new departure, the Council is glad to be able to add that the new undertaking will not in the least interfere with the already existing series of Oriental Translations. Thanks principally to the efforts of our late colleague, Mr. Arbuthnot, whose death has been so great a loss to the Society, thirteen volumes have now appeared, the last being Mrs. Rhys Davids's Dhamma Sangani (of which the cost was defrayed by Mr. Sturdy). Mr. Arbuthnot had made arrangements, which still hold good, for the publication of three further volumes at his expense. And, besides that, the accounts show a balance to the credit of the fund of \u00a3112 7s., about half of this resulting from sales of the Dhamma Sangani and half from the sale of the other volumes.\n\nThis year another volume, Mrs. Beveridge's translation from the Persian of the Memoirs of Gulbadan Begum, aunt of Akbar the Great, has appeared. In this case the\nexperiment has been made of publishing, with the translation, the text also of the unique MS. on which it is based, and the Council takes the opportunity, in connection with these last two volumes of the Translation Fund, to call attention to the valuable assistance which lady members of the Society can thus render to Oriental research.\n\nThe posthumous work of the late Thomas Watters on the travels in India of the Chinese pilgrim Yuan Chwang is in the press, and will appear in the volumes of this series for the ensuing two years. This work is being edited by the Secretary in collaboration with Dr. Bushell, to whom the cordial thanks of the Society are due.\n\nWith regard to the establishment of an Oriental School in London, the Council has at present nothing further to report. The University is being now organized. The necessary funds will, it is hoped, be forthcoming; and the Council will lose no opportunity of pressing upon the University authorities, whenever they shall have to decide on the apportionment of funds, the importance and the needs of Oriental research.\n\nThe Council has decided to extend a special welcome to the Indian Princes who will be present at the Coronation, by inviting them to a banquet to be held at the Whitehall Rooms on June the 17th. The arrangements are being made by an influential committee, presided over by Sir Steuart Bayley. This intention has received very encouraging support from the members of the Society and their friends, and the Council has every confidence that the result will more than justify their expectations.\n\nThe Council has to report, in respect to the Society's Journal, a very encouraging sign of the increased interest that is being taken in Oriental matters. In spite of the increase in the size of the Journal, which now, indeed, threatens to become too bulky, as a bound volume, for convenience, the number of original articles sent in to the Council for publication has far outrun the available space. The Council is exceedingly loth to decline, or indefinitely to postpone, the publication of such articles as\nare a distinct contribution to human knowledge. But it has now found it necessary to accept articles filling up the Journal for so many issues ahead that it will become a serious matter for consideration whether the Journal must not be still further enlarged. As the size of the volume has already reached the utmost limit, it would be necessary, in that case, to break up the Journal into two or more separate issues, each containing articles devoted to some special branch of enquiry. To do this would be an advantage in some respects; but it would be so great a disadvantage in others, that the Council hopes to be able, by transferring the longer articles (especially abstracts of newly discovered MSS.\u2014always, very properly, somewhat long) to the Monograph Series, to postpone the day when a decision on this point will have to be taken. The Council is very glad to notice that the sale of the Journal, so important for the financial position of the Society, continues remarkably steady; and it trusts that the Society will appreciate its continued efforts to retain, in all the articles accepted, the high standard of scholarship for which the Journal has now so well-earned a reputation.\n\nOn the whole, and especially considering the very small means of the Society, the record of work done, and of new enterprises undertaken, is not discouraging. Slowly but surely it grows year by year, and was never so extensive as it has now come to be. But it will be long before the arrears of work, necessarily as yet left undone, can have been worked off. Even as regards the present it cannot yet be said that the East, as it is, has been made intelligible to the West. And as regards the past, some of the most interesting chapters in the history of the development of religion, of philosophy, of the social and economic conditions of mankind, remain still unwritten because the materials on which they must be based have not, as yet, been adequately edited, translated, and summarized. The Society is really at the beginning of its labours. It is a disadvantage in some respects that our subjects are literary and historical. They seem to add nothing to material comfort. The study of\nthem does not result in that sort of knowledge which affords a livelihood. There is no reason for complaint in an age of luxury, of keen commercial competition, of severe individual struggle for the means of livelihood, that such studies as lead only to ideas, to a richer intellectual life, should be pushed, for a time, into the background, should receive but little popular support. Similar causes have operated in the past. It is only in recent generations that we have seen the rise of the new science of history, on the watch, not for the romance of individual lives, but for the causes that underlie the rise and development of human ideas and institutions. In this respect we stand just at the parting of the ways; and not in this only. The nations are awakening to a sense of the pressing necessity, in the imminent struggle in the East for commercial and political advantages, of a more accurate and full acquaintance with the habits and ideas and languages of the Eastern peoples than has hitherto been found necessary. The importance and interest of the work is already, therefore, for both these reasons, becoming largely recognized abroad; and the Council looks forward with confidence to the future in the hope that it must soon be more adequately recognized here.\n\nBy the lamented deaths of Professor Weber and Professor Tiele, two vacancies have occurred in the list of our Honorary Members. The Council proposes the election in their stead of Professor Lanman, of Harvard, and of Professor Houtsma, of Utrecht.\n\nLord Reay retires from the office of President, and Lord Crawford, Sir M. E. Grant Duff, Sir F. Goldsmid, Sir Charles Lyall, and Sir Raymond West retire by rotation from the office of Vice-President. The following members retire, under the rules, from the Council:\n\nMr. Fleet,\nMr. Frazer,\nMr. Irvine,\nProfessor Macdonell,\nMr. Sewell.\nIn place of them the Council proposes the election, as Vice-Presidents, of\n\nSir M. E. Grant Duff,\nSir F. Goldsmid,\nSir Charles Lyall,\nSir Raymond West;\n\nand of members of Council, of\n\nMr. Fleet,\nProfessor Macdonell,\nProfessor E. G. Browne,\nProfessor Douglas,\nMr. Dames.\n\nThe usual statement of accounts is laid on the table.\n\nSir W. Rattigan, K.C., said:\u2014It is with very great pleasure I rise to propose the adoption of the Report we have just heard. It is, I think, a practical, businesslike document, which puts before the meeting, briefly and clearly, the results of the year's operations from a financial and a literary point of view. And I think also you will agree with me that from either point of view it is eminently satisfactory. There is an increasing number of subscribers, with an increase of \u00a3101 over last year's receipts, leaving a balance in excess of expenditure of \u00a363. This may not represent a large addition to our available funds, but it shows at all events a watchful administration which does not embark on any ambitious projects beyond the existing resources of the Society. I entirely agree with what was said by Sir Charles Lyall at last year's meeting, that the Society was not formed for the purpose of hoarding money, but rather of spending it usefully in stimulating interest in, and improving our knowledge of, Eastern subjects. At the same time it is necessary that our Society should be maintained in a condition which may be described as that of 'healthy solvency,' and it is from this point of view that I regard the existence of a balance at credit as the result of the year's receipts and expenditure as a sign of good\n## ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND RECEIPTS.\n\n| Subscriptions\u2014 | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| 94 Resident Members at \u00a33 3s. | 296 2 0 |\n| 1 \" in arrears | 3 3 0 |\n| 192 Non-Resident \" at \u00a31 10s. | 286 11 0 |\n| 12 \" in arrears | 18 0 0 |\n| 10 \" in advance | 21 19 2 |\n| 17 \" at \u00a31 1s. | 17 17 0 |\n| 6 Library Members at \u00a31 10s. | 9 0 0 |\n| **Total** | **652 12 2** |\n\n### Journal\u2014\n\n| Subscriptions | 155 19 7 |\n| Sale | 29 2 0 |\n| Sale of Index | 10 0 0 |\n| Sale of Pamphlets | 6 17 0 |\n| Advertisements | 12 17 8 |\n| **Total** | **205 6 3** |\n\n### Donations\u2014\n\n| India Office | 210 0 0 |\n| Gerini for Monographs | 50 0 0 |\n| **Total** | **260 0 0** |\n\n| Rents | 212 4 0 |\n| Interest\u2014on Deposit in Bank | 8 12 6 |\n| \" in Savings Bank | 5 6 0 |\n| Sale of Catalogue | 1 15 0 |\n| Miscellaneous | 6 2 0 |\n| Subscriptions paid in error | 4 10 0 |\n| **Total** | **35 8 0** |\n\n### Dividends\u2014\n\n| N.S.W. 4 per cents | 30 7 4 |\n| Midlands | 5 0 8 |\n| **Total** | **35 8 0** |\n\n| Balance at Bank, January 1, 1901 | 65 4 11 |\n| \" on Deposit | 112 13 6 |\n| \" Petty Cash | 19 10 |\n| \" in Post Office | 226 4 11 |\n| **Total** | **405 3 2** |\n\n| Funds (value on Dec. 31). | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| \u00a3803 13s. 10d.

We are now looking at the great scope of our work and hope to find with larger funds at our disposal we can do even more than is at present possible by our means. Indeed, when we consider the vast extent of the resources of a Society like ours in the hands of men at our disposal, the thought that has come to all our minds is that which oppressed the great moment of the great and true Englishman who now sees the great heap of death on the crest of the lonely mountain, and whose soul remains. If a few more generous donors like the late Mr. Arbuthnot, whose death was a heavy blow, would only come forward and make an effort to aid some of the chiefs and nobles of India with what they could contribute to the advancement of this Society in the direction of Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit works so far unknown to European readers, the possibilities would be opened out, which are now shut up in a storehouse designed for but scarcely within the grasp of the present generation.\n\nWe have not yet realized, while our present resources are still so rich a harvest of work, that there is still matter for sincere regret that much has been accomplished, but in the course of the past year holds out to us. We have been able to publish thirteen works in the past, including the recent translation of the Dhamma Sutra, and translation of the Memoirs of Akbar the Great, which we have had the honour of being a member of our Society, and which will be translated into other languages.\n\nThere are also at least five works which are now in course of publication by writers whose names are known throughout the East and in contemplation of the future. These are also at least five works which are now in course of publication by writers whose names are known throughout the East and in contemplation of the future.\nIt is by publications of this kind that we not only justify the existence of our Society, but we serve to foster also that deeper interest in the East which contributes so largely to widen and improve our knowledge of and to enlist our intelligent sympathy with those Asiatic races towards whom our Empire has a noble mission to fulfil, a mission which can best be promoted by making ourselves more conversant with all that is worthy to be known of the past history, the literature, the habits, laws, and customs of these races. It is by acquiring a fuller knowledge on these points that we learn to respect those races for their many virtues and for the part they have played in the world's history, and it is by feeling this respect for them ourselves that we can alone hope to inspire a similar feeling on their part towards us, and thereby deepen the true foundations on which our Empire must rest in the East.\n\nConsidering, therefore, what our Society has done in the past, how it is still zealously labouring with limited means in the same direction, I cannot but express surprise and regret that the Government has given so little encouragement to its efforts. We might well, I think, expect a special grant towards the Translation and Monograph Fund from the State, and also a contribution towards meeting the charge for rent of a suitable building, and I trust that the Council will not relax its efforts to obtain this monetary and well-merited assistance.\n\nI cannot conclude without adding my humble testimony to the increasing excellence of the Journal published by the Society. The articles are all well chosen, and display an amount of research and learning which make them valuable and attractive to all readers who are interested in the East.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure in moving the adoption of the Report.\n\nSyed Ali Bilgrami, in seconding the report, said:\u2014My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014The Report which has just been read is eminently satisfactory so far as the working of the Society is concerned. It shows that the Society has been making steady progress. The number of its members,\nnotwithstanding withdrawals and loss by death, is on the increase. Its Journal has not only maintained the high standard of excellence which it has lately attained under the management of our able Secretary and his assistant, but, thanks to the growing number of Orientalists in this country, there is every prospect that the same high standard will be maintained in the future. In fact, so great is the flow of material that it has become a question whether the Journal should not be appreciably enlarged. So far so good, and for a Society like ours perhaps the best measure of its success is the record of its work. But at the same time you all know the adage that bricks cannot be made without straw, and when we look to the small balance of \u00a363 11s. 3d. left to our credit after meeting the ordinary expenditure of the year, it becomes a question whether our financial position is as sound as might be desired. Looking back to the steady progress we have made during the last five years, and the ease with which we have been able to balance income and expenditure, we are apt to forget that so long as we are dependent on the annual subscriptions of our members for the maintenance of our efficiency, the Society cannot be regarded as having a sound financial position. Moreover, we must not forget that there are certain social functions which it would be extremely desirable to institute in order to make our Society acceptable to a wider circle of members in this country, but which the Society is unable to undertake owing to the small margin of balance on which it has to work. For my part, until such time as we have a funded capital sufficient to pay the cost of the publication of the Journal and the rent of the premises in which the Society is located, we should not delude ourselves with the notion that we are doing well, and it should be the endeavour of every member to devise ways and means for bringing grist to the mill.\n\nWe all know that our field of operation is represented by the vast continent of Asia. The elucidation of its past and present, the study of the languages, history, and antiquities of its vast concourse of people, is our chief aim, and yet\nlooking through the list of our members, it is astonishing how small is the number of Asiatics on our rolls. To my mind this is a point which deserves our serious consideration. To make the Society known to and appreciated by the people for whom it is working, will not only add lustre to its name, but will materially aid its finances. Unfortunately for us, most of the Asiatic countries have forms of government which do not recognize or encourage progress. There is, however, one considerable portion of Asia which is free from this reproach, and has been making steady progress under the blessings of British rule\u2014I mean India. This is a subject on which I need not dilate in an assembly so largely representative of the past governors of the country, but I may be permitted to say that notwithstanding the pessimistic views regarding the poverty of India which are being ventilated in certain quarters, no one who has a knowledge of facts can deny that during the last thirty years the advancement of India, both material and moral, has been uninterrupted, and this applies not only to British India but also to the Native States. The Indian Princes are beginning to recognize the real responsibilities of government, and it is to them that we must turn for help on behalf of our Society. I am convinced that if we could only sufficiently make clear to them the aims and objects of the Society, the majority of them will join us and become life members; and perhaps later, when they are imbued with the spirit of research, they will help us with funds for carrying out some of the literary work which is being done under the auspices of the Society. In this connection the institution of the Coronation Banquet, at which I understand all the Indian Princes who have been invited to London will be present, is a most happy circumstance. I trust that we shall be able to take full advantage of the opportunity thus afforded of making ourselves known to our distinguished visitors.\n\nTurning to the events of the past year, that destroyer of delights and the disperser of assemblies, as death has been poetically called in the \"Arabian Nights,\" has deprived us of ten of our members. The most to be lamented among these\nis the late Mr. Gibb, the well-known Turkish scholar, whose History of Ottoman Poetry is a marvel of sound scholarship, wide research, and lucid exposition. It is fortunate that his mantle has fallen on worthy shoulders, and the completion of the work has been entrusted to our most regular contributor and valued friend, Professor Browne of Cambridge, whose marvellous knowledge of Mussulman languages and literature is only equalled by his deep sympathy for the people to whom these languages belong.\n\nWe have also to lament the death of the late Mr. Arbuthnot, who was not only a very old member of the Society, but whose liberality has enabled us to revive the old Translation Fund. The last work in this series, viz., the Memoirs of the Gulbadan Begum, is from the pen of Mrs. Beveridge, one of our lady members to whom we owe so much. It is much to be regretted that the text is founded on a unique MS., but this could not be helped. Mr. Beveridge found mention of a Humayun Nama in the Catalogue of the Library of the late Sir Salar Jung at Hyderabad, but this appears to have been lent out, and notwithstanding repeated applications to the Librarian no trace of the work has been found.\n\nThe scheme of Asiatic monographs is now fully matured, and five distinct monographs are in the press, and some of these ready for publication.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my pleasing duty to express the thanks of the Society to our President, Lord Reay, whose interest in the work of the Society remains unabated. We have also to thank our able and energetic Secretary, Professor Rhys Davids, and our Assistant Secretary, Miss Hughes.\n\nMr. Vincent Smith, supporting the adoption of the Report, said:\u2014I think that the meeting may feel quite satisfied that the Society is making good progress in the hands of its officers. It enjoys in Lord Reay an eminently painstaking and tactful President, and the Society can be heartily congratulated on his re-election.\n\nThe devoted and ardent labours of our distinguished Secretary, Professor Rhys Davids, and his very competent\nassistant, Miss Hughes, are known to all members of this Society, and the Report read and the work done throughout the year are evidence that the Council as a whole have attended with diligence and care to all the various duties imposed upon them.\n\nAn allusion has been made, unfortunately as usual, to the lamented lack of interest in Oriental studies in this country. The question has been principally discussed here on previous occasions with reference to an Oriental School of Languages. There is a lamentable inconsistency between our vast Oriental obligations, and the prevalent ignorance of and indifference to our Eastern possessions, their language, manners, and customs. It seems to me that we lack not so much teachers as students, and these we shall never have until young men can be brought to see, and it is made worth while for them to learn, the importance of making a thorough acquaintance with the languages, geography, customs, history, and traditions of the people they will live among when they go East. It is of no use approaching Chinese and other Oriental teachers with a view to their giving lectures if you cannot get students to attend them. It is not the fault of the Professors that the lectures are thinly attended. The necessity for such knowledge is nowhere properly recognized either by the public or the Government.\n\nIn France things are very different. There they have an \u00c9cole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, with 200 real students, besides a certain number who go there to diminish their term of military service. The Council might turn their attention to the providing of students rather than Professors. When the former come along bringing fees the latter will not be difficult to find.\n\nThe best way would be to urge upon the different Government Departments and the heads of Mercantile Institutions the urgent necessity of so training young men destined to go East that they may be equipped with a colloquial knowledge of the languages, and some sound information regarding the history, manners, and customs of the people with whom they will have to deal. Personally\nI should like to see Haileybury revived on a magnified scale, and a college established for the training of students, official and non-official, who purpose to spend their working lives in the East. Then all our young men destined for India, Turkey, Japan, and China would be able to say that they had received their education in one of their own great colleges.\n\nYoung men going to India would be far better trained at such a college than by spending a year or two at the English Universities, which are imbued with classical traditions, and can do very little to stimulate Oriental studies or arouse sympathies with Oriental peoples.\n\nI should be very glad to see the Council address themselves to the task of making business people interest themselves in getting young men who are going abroad to attend a special practical college course for teaching all the branches of knowledge necessary to men destined for service in the East.\n\nThe Journal of the Society continues under the capable editorship of our Secretary and Assistant Secretary to do us credit, and is able to hold up its head among similar journals of other societies in the world.\n\nAfter a few remarks from other members present, in the course of which it was pointed out by Mr. J. Kennedy that of the balance of \u00a363 11s. 3d. shown in the Report \u00a350 was already earmarked for Major Gerini's Researches on Ptolemy's Geography of the Far East, the Chairman put the question that the Report be adopted. In doing so he observed that even after the deduction made there was actually a small balance in hand on the receipts and expenditure of the year, and that the expenditure side was unduly swollen by a charge of \u00a366 18s. 2d. on repairs, which was not a recurring item. In addition to the hopeful indications for the future dwelt upon in the Report, he might mention the successful institution of the medal and prizes for competition in subjects of Indian history and research offered to leading public schools, referred to in last year's Report, which had now been\ndefinitely established; and he might refer also to the proposed British Academy, in which it was hoped that the Society would shortly be represented, and which could not, he thought, fail to stimulate public interest in things Asiatic.\n\nThe Report and the recommendations contained in it as to Vice-Presidents and members of Council were then adopted unanimously.\n\nJune 10.\u2014Lord Reay, President, in the Chair.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nMr. Maung Tsain,\nThe Rev. W. S. Caldecott,\nThe Rev. H. H. B. Ayles,\nMr. U On Gaing, C.I.E., and\nMiss A. L. B. Hardcastle\n\nhad been elected Members of the Society.\n\nDr. G. Thibaut read a paper on the R\u0101m\u0101nuja Bh\u0101shya. A discussion followed, in which Col. G. A. Jacob, Mr. A. B. Keith, Dr. Grierson, Sir R. West, Mr. Vaidya, Syed Ali Bilgrami, and Professor Bendall took part.\n\nII. CONTENTS OF FOREIGN ORIENTAL JOURNAL.\n\nVIENNA ORIENTAL JOURNAL. Vol. xvi, No. 2.\n\nSpeyer (J. S.).

OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nProfessor Charles Rieu, Ph.D., M.A.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, March 19 of this year (1902), after an illness of less than three days, there passed away from us one of the greatest Oriental scholars of our time, and one who, notwithstanding his modest and unassuming character, probably enjoyed a higher and wider reputation in scholarly circles than almost any Orientalist of this age. The width and depth of his scholarship were such as to command the admiration of all who were capable of appreciating his rare attainments; while his gentle and amiable disposition, his constant readiness to place at the disposal of all who needed them the vast stores of his learning, and his eagerness to see only the good points in the work and characters of others, earned him the deep affection and gratitude of all\u2014especially his younger fellow-workers\u2014who enjoyed the privilege of his friendship. His death, alike to his friends and to those branches of learning to which he devoted his long and laborious life, is an irreparable loss; yet in its circumstances it was, we may be sure, such as he himself would have most desired; for after an active and fruitful life of 82 years (during nearly 60 years of which he enjoyed a European reputation as an Orientalist of the first rank) he passed quietly away, after a brief and comparatively painless illness, having been in perfect health until within three days of the end, and with a mind clear and tranquil to the last.\n\nDr. Rieu was born at Geneva in 1820, and, on leaving school at the age of 15, entered the Acad\u00e9mie de Gen\u00e8ve in November, 1835. There he remained for four years, of which the first three were passed in the Faculty of Philosophy, and the last in that of Science. During a part of this period he studied under Jean Humbert, who (like Freytag, with whom he afterwards pursued his studies) was a pupil of the great French Orientalist Sylvestre de Sacy.\nIn the Autumn of 1840 he left Geneva for the University of Bonn, where he was inscribed in the Philosophical Faculty on October 30 of that year, and where he remained till the Summer of 1843, when he received his doctor's degree and published his dissertation on Abu'l-'Al\u00e1 al-Ma'arr\u00ed, one of the most interesting and at the same time most difficult Arabic poets, which dissertation at once assured his reputation as an Arabic scholar. A series of letters to his parents, ranging over the greater portion of this period (January, 1841\u2014June, 1843), which the kindness of his widow and daughter has placed at my disposal, throws much light on his life and work at this time. He at once began to read Arabic with Freytag and Sanskrit with Lassen, but was obliged at first, in addition to the ordinary classical and historical studies required by the University in that Faculty, to devote a good deal of time to learning to speak, understand, and write German and Latin, candidates for the Doctor's degree being at that time compelled in the Prussian Universities both to speak and write the latter language in the exercises required for admission thereto. At a later period of his residence at Bonn he read Arabic both with Freytag and Gildemeister (who, though a comparatively young man, seems to have been a more efficient and stimulating teacher than his older colleague), and also received private instruction in Hebrew.\n\nIn 1843, as already said, Dr. Rieu completed his studies and received his degree at Bonn, and published his dissertation on Abu'l-'Al\u00e1, which was entitled *De Abu'l-Alae poetae arabici vit\u00e2 et carminibus*. About a year later (November 8, 1844) he was elected a member of the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, on the proposal of Burnouf and Reinaud. In 1847 was published at St. Petersburg Hemachandra's Sanskrit Dictionary, the *Abhidana chintamani*, in the production of which Dr. Rieu collaborated with B\u00f6htlingk, for whom he transcribed the unique MS. of the Bodleian. In the same year he entered the British Museum, in which for nearly half a century he was one of the most zealous and indispensable officers. There, indeed, was accomplished the\ngreat and immortal work of his life, to wit, the preparation and publication of such catalogues of the vast and precious collections of Oriental MSS. there preserved as must ever remain the beau id\u00e9al of such work, and the indispensable companions of every student of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literature. In 1867 Dr. Rieu was nominated Curator of the Oriental MSS. in the Museum, and four years later he completed (in 1871) the second part of the Catalogus Codicum Manuscriptorum Orientalium, or older Catalogue of the Arabic MSS., of which the first portion had been published by Cureton in 1846. This was followed successively by the Catalogue of Persian MSS. (1879\u20131883), the Catalogue of Turkish MSS. (1888), the Arabic Supplement (1894), and the Persian Supplement (1895). These seven volumes constitute a veritable treasury of knowledge concerning all that relates to these three chief branches of Mu\u1e25ammadan literature and literary history, and give evidence of an amount of labour and a degree of critical scholarship which only those who have attempted a similar task can fully realize. Only so great a scholar and so indefatigable a student, working on so rich and copious a collection of manuscripts, could have produced so monumental a series of catalogues, which will probably remain unequalled and indispensable so long as Mu\u1e25ammadan literature is studied and appreciated.\n\nIn 1893 (nearly two years before he actually severed his connection with the British Museum, and, at the invitation of the Electors to the Sir Thomas Adams\u2019 Professorship of Arabic in the University of Cambridge, accepted that Chair, rendered vacant by the death of Professor W. Robertson Smith in March, 1894) Dr. Rieu, who had already nominally retired from his post in the Museum (which, however, till the end of his life, he was ever ready to aid with his counsels), celebrated the jubilee of his Doctorate, and received on this occasion (September 6, 1894) the most flattering congratulatory address from the University of Bonn, who thus fittingly gave public recognition to the eminent services to learning of her illustrious son, \u201cqui Arabicis, Persicis, Turcicis Musei Britannici Codicibus summ\u0101\ncum cur\u00e2 singularique doctrin\u00e2 descriptis ad vastos litterarum\nthesauros omnibus aditum patefecit, adeuntes semper consilio\natque opera comiter adjuvit.\"\n\nIt was in the late Autumn of 1894 that Dr. Rieu's election\nto the Chair in which I now most unworthily succeed him\ntook place. He neither offered himself as a candidate for\nthis distinction, nor was he easily persuaded to accept\nit, until he was convinced that it was the earnest desire\nof those most concerned that he should do so. At the\nage which he had then attained (nearly 75) he had the\nright to demand a well-earned repose rather than new\nobligations and responsibilities; but it was not in his\nnature to lay aside, ere he was compelled, the labours\nwhich are at once the scholar's duty and pleasure, or to\ndeprive this University, which sought and needed his\nhelp, of the honour of including another illustrious name\nin the roll of those who have laboured for 270 years\nto make the Oriental School of Cambridge the best, as\nit is the oldest, in Great Britain. Of the Chair founded\nby Sir Thomas Adams in 1632 Dr. Rieu was the sixteenth\noccupant, and the only one who was not a native of the\nBritish Islands; a fact which, to the writer's mind, is\nequally honourable to the country which produced so\nillustrious a scholar and the country which offered him\nso great and useful a career. How much consolation and\nhope does this reflection contain: that in the realms of\nscience at least we see some dim foreshadowing of that\nuniversal brotherhood of mankind which elsewhere is but\ndreamed of and hoped for, wherein the limitations of\nnationalities and tongues vanish away, and even East and\nWest, so widely separated by thought, custom, feeling,\nand belief, are reconciled in the Light of that Knowledge\nwhich is the Creator's Supreme Attribute and the student's\nultimate goal.\n\nEdward G. Browne.\nJohn Beames.\n\nBorn June 21, 1837. Died May 24, 1902.\n\nThe Royal Asiatic Society has lost one of its most distinguished members, and Oriental scholarship one of its most eminent interpreters, by the death of Mr. John Beames, which took place after a long illness at Clevedon, in Somerset, on Saturday, the 24th of last May.\n\nJohn Beames was born at Greenwich Hospital on the 21st of June, 1837. He was the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Beames, Preacher of St. James's, Piccadilly, and grandson of John Beames, Esq., K.C., Bencher of Lincoln's Inn. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School under Dr. Hessing, and, while there, obtained an appointment in the Indian Civil Service, and proceeded to Haileybury College. He studied at Haileybury during the years 1856\u20137, in his fourth term obtaining the Classic and Sanskrit prizes and the Persian medal. He arrived in India in the year 1858, and served in the Panjab from March, 1859, to late in 1861. From December, 1861, to the conclusion of his service he was employed in the Bengal Presidency, becoming a permanent Collector in the year 1867, a Commissioner in 1881, and twice officiating as a Member of the Board of Revenue. On his retirement from the Indian Civil Service in March, 1893, he had thus gained the rare experience of having worked in the Mufassal of two widely distant provinces, and this was no doubt one of the causes of that wide grasp which he exhibited in dealing with all things Indian. To him were equally familiar, from practical contact with the village people who spoke them, the rough patois of the Jats of the Panjab, the smooth-flowing Oriy\u0101, the clipped dialect of a Bengali peasant, and the clear-cut, practical Bhojpuri of Bih\u0101r.\n\nWe have seen that Mr. Beames distinguished himself by his attainments in Oriental languages while he was yet in Haileybury. In India he served an apprenticeship of seven years, laying the foundations of that encyclopaedic, yet accurate, knowledge of things pertaining to the East which\nafterwards became the mark of all that he wrote. His first essays appeared in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society in the year 1866, shortly after he had been placed in charge of the frontier district of Camp\u0101ran in Bih\u0101r. These dealt with the now well-worn topic of the advisability or otherwise of retaining the Arabic element in the official form of Hindost\u0101ni. In the previous year his attention had been drawn to Bishop Caldwell's Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, and it immediately occurred to him that a similar book was much wanted for the Aryan group. The result was the commencement in 1866 of those studies which bore their first ripe fruit in 1872. In the meantime other shorter but important works issued from his pen. The earliest was his well-known Outlines of Indian Philology,\u00b9 the first attempt to prepare a scientific general account of all the languages then known to be spoken in India. Much of this work is now of course out of date, but parts of it, notably the chapter entitled \"Hints on observing and recording a new language,\" are as valuable to-day as they were when first published. In 1868 we have two excellent papers in the Journal of this Society\u2014one on the Magar language of Nep\u0101l, and the other on the form of Bhojpuri spoken in Camp\u0101ran. The latter was for many years the only account in existence of any dialect of Bih\u0101r\u012b (the language of over thirty-six millions of Indo-Aryans), and the former (if we except Hodgson's short vocabulary) the only account of one of the most important hill languages of Nep\u0101l.\n\nMr. Beames's connection with the Bengal Asiatic Society lasted until the year 1885. During the twenty years which succeeded his first essay, its Journal was enriched by many contributions from his pen. Essays on Cand Bardai and other old Hindi authors were interspersed with studies on the antiquities and history of Orissa (1870\u20131883). In 1884\u201385 appeared his important articles on the Geography of India in the Reign of Akbar. During the same period the Indian Antiquary numbered him among the brilliant band of its\n\n\u00b9 Written in 1866: 1st ed. 1867, 2nd ed. 1868.\nearlier writers, and its pages contain many careful reviews of the works of other scholars, besides original articles of great interest on the early literature of Bengal proper and Orissa.\n\nIn 1869 appeared his well-known edition of Sir Henry Elliot's *Supplemental Glossary of Indian Terms*, a work which it is superfluous to praise. Twenty-two years afterwards, in 1891, was published his excellent Bengali Grammar, the first book of its kind which attempted to deal, not only with the inflated language of modern Bengali literature, but also with the altogether different spoken tongue. After his retirement he wrote for the most part in the Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review. At one time he contemplated the preparation of a Prakrit Dictionary, but I believe that, not receiving sufficient encouragement from publishers, he abandoned the scheme. At the time of his death he was engaged on a translation from the Turki of Baber's Memoirs.\n\nI have hitherto omitted mention of the work on which his reputation chiefly rests, the *Comparative Grammar of the Aryan Languages of India*, commenced in 1866, and published volume by volume in 1872, 1875, and 1879. The year 1872 witnessed the simultaneous appearance of three accounts of the growth of the modern Aryan vernaculars of India\u2014Dr. Trumpp's Sindh\u012b Grammar, Dr. Hoernle's *Essays in aid of a Comparative Grammar of the Gaurian Languages*, and the first volume of Mr. Beames's work. The three scholars proceeded, quite independently, on similar lines. All three emphasized the importance of the Prakrits in the development of the modern languages, and made systematic studies of the laws of that development. But Dr. Trumpp's Grammar referred mainly to Sindhi, and, so far as comparative philology is concerned, remained only a brilliant fragment; Dr. Hoernle's Essays (many of the conclusions of which were afterwards adopted with full acknowledgment by Mr. Beames) were 'essays' in the strict sense of the term, destined to be the foundation of the admirable volume published in 1880; while Mr. Beames was the first to issue a work deliberately intended to cover the whole ground of the subject. \"Whether I have done well or ill,\" he says\nin his preface, \"the book was meant to be a Comparative Grammar, and I have called it so accordingly.\" It is difficult to decide which to admire most in this Grammar, the learning displayed, or the clearness with which the results of that learning are put forth. That parts of it have been superseded by later inquiries must, of course, be conceded, but this cannot prevent our appreciation of the solid erudition, combined with sobriety of argument, which adorns every page. Personally, the debt which I owe to these volumes is great, and I am glad to have this opportunity of acknowledging it.\n\nAlthough for many years under the same Government in India, our lines were mostly cast in widely different parts of the country, and we seldom met. But we often corresponded, and never without the debt being on my side. I still remember the first letter I received from him, in the year 1878 or 1879, in answer to one from me about a small point in Maithili grammar. In those days philology was not popular in India, and civilians who collected information regarding the languages of the country were apt to be looked down upon as shirking their legitimate duties. This letter of Mr. Beames, coming as it did from one high above me in my own service, was the first word of encouragement to proceed with my studies which I received from an official. One of his last acts of kindness to me was to revise the proofs of the Bengali section of the Linguistic Survey of India, and to offer me quite a number of invaluable hints and suggestions. He had a trenchant pen, and could wield it with effect when he considered it to be necessary, but the numerous references in his magnum opus to the opinions of other scholars showed that he possessed a double portion of the spirit of Saraswat\u012b\u2014a just confidence in his own great store of learning, and an ungrudging recognition of the discoveries made by other students in the same line of research as that in which he had an acknowledged claim to be recognized as one of the first authorities.\n\nG. A. G.\nL\u00e9on Feer.\n\nYet another name has dropped out of the short list of the older living Orientalists. M. L\u00e9on Feer, the well-known Sanskrit and Tibetan scholar, died in Paris, March 10th of the present year.\n\nL\u00e9on Feer was born at Rouen on the 22nd November, 1830. In 1864 he was appointed to a Paris professorship, succeeding M. Foucaux in the Chair of Tibetan originally created for the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale and transferred in 1865 to the \u00c9cole des Langues Orientales. He afterwards (1869) held a lectureship in Tibetan and Mongol at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. To this period (1864 to 1872) belong his earlier works, *Ruines de la Ninive* and *La Puissance et la civilisation mongoles au xiii\u00e8me si\u00e8cle*.\n\nIn 1872 M. Feer entered the MS. Department of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. He passed from promotion to promotion to be biblioth\u00e9caire of his department, where he remained working steadfastly till his death, in spite of failing health and growing infirmity in later years. In 1900 he was appointed Conservateur-Adjoint of the great national collection.\n\nOutside his special field\u2014or fields\u2014of work M. L\u00e9on Feer published a number of articles in the *Revue Contemporaine*, *Revue des deux mondes*, *Revue Chr\u00e9tienne*, *Revue des Cours publics*, and *Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019Histoire du Protestantisme fran\u00e7ais*. But we are here chiefly concerned with his work in Buddhist literature, work which has the enduring merit of having brought within reach important texts from widely separated regions of this great field of research.\n\nM. Feer\u2019s learning embraced Tibetan and Mongol, Sanskrit and P\u0101li. He was therefore able to contribute largely to our knowledge both of the Buddhism of countries where the documents have the peculiar interest of works translated into non-Indian languages from the Sanskrit, and the Buddhism of the school that preserves its characteristic and rich literature in a purely Indian dress.\nThe first in order of his translations was the S\u016btra en quarante-deux articles (1878). The following were afterwards published in the Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet: a translation of the Analyse du Kandjour et du Tandjour of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, with many additions and notes (vol. ii of the Annales), Fragments extraits du Kandjour, translated from the Tibetan (vol. v), and the Avad\u0101na\u00e7ataka; cent l\u00e9gendes bouddhiques, from the Sanskrit (vol. xviii).\n\nIn the Biblioth\u00e8que orientale elz\u00e9virienne series appeared a translation by M. Feer of the Tibetan version of the Dhammapada, and in the Collection de Contes et de Chansons populaires a translation from Bengali under the title Contes Indiens; les trente-deux r\u00e9cits du tr\u00f4ne.\n\nL\u00e9on Feer's greatest service to P\u0101li scholarship was his edition of the Samyutta-nik\u0101ya for the P\u0101li Text Society. It was his last long work.\n\nHe contributed articles to the Grande Encyclop\u00e9die, and was one of the oldest collaborators in the Revue de l'Histoire des Religions. An obituary notice in the last-named review acknowledges the value of his contributions on Tibetan subjects, in which his competence was shared by very few. He was also an unwearied contributor to the Journal Asiatique till within a few months of his death.\n\nIt was as Librarian of the MS. Department of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale that most of the younger Orientalists knew him best, and here all who sought his help had experience of his unselfish kindness and readiness to lend his time and learning and official authority to smooth the way of their researches.\n\nThe cataloguing of Eugene Burnouf's papers (now in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale) fell to M. Feer. It must have been a truly congenial task to him, for he had the scholar's lovable piety towards the memory, works, and relics of a past generation of great Orientalists. The present writer remembers the touching pleasure with which he once showed her a manuscript in Sir William Jones' handwriting, an unfinished poem that had not the remotest connection with indianisme.\nM. Feer lived a secluded life. Modesty, a certain shyness, and heart-whole devotion to his work were so much his leading characteristics that it is difficult to bring out a distinct portrait of this reserved but kindly personality. Perhaps the plain record of his long and patient labours is not an unfitting tribute to his memory.\n\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nProfessor Rhys Davids has been elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences.\n\nDr. M. A. Stein, of the Indian Educational Service, has, with the sanction of H.M.'s Secretary of State for India, been placed on eight months' special duty in England in order to prepare a detailed report on the results of his recent journey of archaeological and topographical exploration in Chinese Turkestan. Dr. Stein's Preliminary Report on these explorations, issued in November last, and already noticed in the J.R.A.S., showed the extent of the antiquarian and other materials brought back from this journey and awaiting detailed examination.\n\nNew Appointments.\n\nMr. E.

Medi\u00e6val Khur\u0101s\u0101n extended on the north-east to the Oxus, and included all the districts round Herat which now belong to Afghanistan. On the other hand, the small province of K\u016bmis, on the northern boundary of the Great Desert, which at the present day is included within the limits of Persian Khur\u0101s\u0101n, was of old a separate district, and formed in the time of Mustawfi a province apart.\n\n\u1e24amd-Allah divides Khur\u0101s\u0101n into four quarters (Rub\u2018)\nor districts; namely, N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br, Her\u0101t, Balkh, and Great Marv. Of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br city he gives a full account, describing its plan, which had originally been laid out after the fashion of a chess-board, and noting its walls and watercourses. The Arabs had written the name Nays\u0101b\u016br. Mustawfi devotes a paragraph to the great suburb of Sh\u0101dy\u0101kh, which Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 228) from his personal knowledge has also described. This had been built, or rebuilt, after the great earthquake of the year 605 (A.D. 1208) which had laid N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br in ruins; but both suburb and city were again destroyed by the earthquake of 679 (A.D. 1280), and a third city of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br was the capital of Khur\u0101s\u0101n when Mustawfi wrote. In regard to Sh\u0101dy\u0101kh its ruins still exist some three miles to the east of the modern city (Yate, Khur\u0101s\u0101n, p. 412).\n\nN\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br had its chief water supply from a stream that flowed down from the mountains to the north-east of the town; and forty water-mills were turned by the stream in the two leagues of its course through the plain after leaving the hills. Five leagues distant from the city, on the watershed of the range dividing N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br from the Mashhad valley, was a small lake, about one league round, called Bu\u1e25ayrah Chashmah Sabz\u2014\u2018the Lake of the Green Spring\u2019\u2014recently visited and described by Colonel Yate (Khur\u0101s\u0101n, p. 353), from which Mustawfi reports that water flowed either way, east and west. Here the Amir Ch\u016bp\u0101n had built a kiosk on the brink of the spring, of which many wonders are told, and spectres were seen rising from the waters at certain seasons; further, the lake was said to be unfathomable (L. 226l). A great number of streams flowed down from this mountain range to the plain of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br, chief among these being the Sh\u016brah-r\u016bd or Salt River, into which at flood times most of the lesser streams ultimately drained, coming from the various sides of the plain. Mustawfi (in part copied by the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 328) mentions the names of a great number of these, to wit, the Dizb\u0101d river, flowing to the village of this name on the Her\u0101t road, the \u0100b-i-Sahr (or Sakhtar), the Khayr\u016bd or \u0100b-i-Khar\u016b, the\nT\u016bsank\u0101n or T\u016bshk\u0101n-r\u016bd, the \u0100b-i-Pusht-i-Far\u016bsh, the Khajank river, the \u0100b-i-Farkhak, the \u0100b-i-Dahr, and the \u0100b-i-\u2018A\u1e6dsh\u0101b\u0101d \u2014 \u2018Thirst River\u2019 \u2014 coming down by the Mayd\u0101n-i-Sult\u0101n, but of which the water-supply so often failed as fully to deserve its evil name (L. 219q to 220b).\n\nThe town of Isfar\u0101yin [1] in the centre of the plain of this name, at the ruins known as Shahr-i-Bilkis, recently described by Colonel Yate (Khur\u0101s\u0101n, p. 378), was celebrated for its castle called Diz-Zar, \u2018the Golden fort.\u2019 Bayh\u0101k was the capital of the great district of the same name lying south of Isfar\u0101yin, and its ruins lie close to Sabziv\u0101r [2], which is the present chief town of this district. Biy\u0101r [3] lies on the border of the Great Desert, and is marked as Biy\u0101r-Jumand on our maps. Juwayn is the name of the plain south and west of Isfar\u0101yin (see Route x): its chief town is Fariy\u016bmad, and Mustawfi mentions the hamlets of Bahr\u0101b\u0101d, D\u0101v, Kazr\u012b, and Khud\u0101shah [4]. The city of J\u0101jarm is at the western limit of the Juwayn plain on the river Jagh\u0101n-r\u016bd (L. 220e); in its neighbourhood is the mountain known as K\u016bh-i-Shak\u0101k (Sak\u0101n, Sit\u0101n, etc., are other readings of the MSS.), whence a stream flowed forth from a marvellous cave (L. 205m).\n\nKhab\u016bsh\u0101n, now known as Kuch\u0101n, is in the Mashhad valley to the east of Juwayn; the city had been rebuilt by Hul\u0101g\u016b, and the surrounding district was known as that of Ustuw\u0101. The town of Shak\u0101n (or Shaf\u0101n) I am unable to identify. T\u016bs, one of the ancient capitals of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, is now a complete ruin; it lies four leagues distance to the north-west of the shrines at Mashhad [5], which last is the modern capital of Khur\u0101s\u0101n and means \u2018the Place of Martyrdom,\u2019 originally called the village of San\u0101b\u0101d. There lie buried at Mashhad the Im\u0101m R\u012bz\u0101 and the Caliph \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, with many other famous personages, their tombs being surrounded by what in the time of Mustawfi had already come to be a large city. In the mountain called K\u016bh Gulsh\u0101n near T\u016bs was a great cavern with a spring welling from its depths, of which many wonders are related (L. 206m, and see Yate, Khur\u0101s\u0101n, p. 351). The\ngreat mountain fastness of Kil\u0101t,\\(^1\\) with Jirm for its chief city, lies to the north of Mashhad, and is now generally known as Kil\u0101t-i-N\u0101dir\u012b, from the fact of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h having stored his Indian treasure here. This is one of the earliest notices of Kil\u0101t, for it is not mentioned by the earlier Arab geographers, but it became famous in later times, notably after its siege by Timur, as described by \u2018\u0100l\u012b of Yazd in his Zafar N\u0101mah (i, 323). In 1875 it was visited and described by Colonel Macgregor (Khur\u0101s\u0101n, ii, 51). The town of Mar\u012bn\u0101n (the MSS. give Mars\u0101n, Hafarmiy\u0101n, and many other variants) was within the limits of Kil\u0101t.\n\nHer\u0101t was watered by the canals of the river Har\u012b-r\u016bd. It had a famous castle called Sham\u012bram, built over the ruins of an ancient Fire-temple, on a mountain two leagues distant from the city, and Mustawfi adds a long account of the town, its markets and its shrines, giving the names of the various city canals derived from the Har\u012b-r\u016bd (L. 216p). The river of Her\u0101t rose in the mountains of Gh\u016br; after passing Her\u0101t it watered the F\u016bshanj district, and thence flowed north to join the Sarakhs river (the modern Tejend\u0101b). Asfuz\u0101r, now generally called Sabziv\u0101r of Afghanistan, is a town at some distance to the south of Her\u0101t, and is mentioned in the Itineraries (Route xvii, and Ibn \u1e24awkal, p. 305). F\u016bshanj [6], or B\u016bshanj according to the same authorities, must be identical with the present city of Gh\u016briy\u0101n lying west of Her\u0101t near the Har\u012b-r\u016bd; and under the name F\u016bshanj it sustained a siege by Timur, as described in the Zafar N\u0101mah (i, 312), but I have been unable to discover when its present name of Gh\u016briy\u0101n first came into use.\\(^2\\) According to Mustawfi, Kus\u016by, or Kusri [7] and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Kil\u0101t, which has come to be the name of more than one important fortress-town of western Asia, is a word that apparently came into use at the close of the middle ages, and is presumably a Persianized form of the Arabic Kal'ah (spelt with dotted k), meaning \u2018a castle.\u2019 It is worth noting that the name Kil\u0101t does not occur in Y\u0101k\u016bt or, I believe, in any of the earlier Arab geographers.\n\n\\(^2\\) The name F\u016bshanj, or B\u016bshanj, has apparently gone completely out of use; on the other hand, I can find no mention of this Gh\u016briy\u0101n in any Eastern author. Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii 821, 824) mentions Gh\u016braj, which he says is commonly pronounced Gh\u016brah, and is a village near the gate of the city of Her\u0101t; and there was the village of Gh\u016briy\u0101n near Marv. Neither of these, however, can\nKharkird [8], the former given in the Itinerary of Ibn Rustah (p. 172) and the latter by Ibn \u1e24awkal (p. 334), were the chief towns of its district.\n\nM\u0101l\u0101n [9], apparently the town now called Shahr-i-Naw, judging by the distances in the Arab Itineraries, was the chief town of the B\u0101kharz district, which lay further to the north along the left bank of the Har\u012b-r\u016bd, and the district of B\u0101dghis lies some distance to the eastward, away from the right bank of the Har\u012b-r\u016bd, being due north of Her\u0101t. Mustawfi mentions K\u0101rizah, where Hak\u012bm Bark\u0101\u1e6d had lived who founded the city of Nakhshab in Transoxiana, also as its chief town G\u016bn\u0101b\u0101d (or K\u016bh Ghan\u0101b\u0101d) [10]; and he names various other places both here and in the Itinerary (Route xviii) which cannot now be identified (viz., Buzurgtar\u012bn, Lab, J\u0101d, Uk\u0101ir\u016bn, K\u0101l\u016bn, and Dihist\u0101n), for the whole region of B\u0101dghis has now relapsed to the desert, though numerous ruined sites are to be met with near the river beds. The town of J\u0101m [11], famous for its shrine, was by the Arab geographers known as Buzj\u0101n, later P\u016bchk\u0101n, and is marked on our maps. Chast (cf. Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah, iii, 457) would appear to have been a town near Her\u0101t, but its exact position is unknown, and the spelling of the name is uncertain. Khw\u0101f [12], with its district, lies to the south of B\u0101kharz, and Mustawfi gives its chief towns as Sal\u0101m [13], Sanj\u0101n [14], and Z\u016bz\u0101n [15], all of which will be found on the map, in the present Khw\u0101f district. Z\u0101vah is, as we learn from Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah (iii, 79), the town now known as Turbat-i-Haydari, so called from the saint buried there, and Z\u0101vah was the name of the surrounding region, also known as Bishak.\n\nThe great districts lying to the north-east of Khur\u0101s\u0101n (in what is now Afghanistan) are only very briefly referred to by Mustawfi. Gh\u016br, the mountainous country lying between the head-waters of the Her\u0101t river and the Helmund, has already been referred to in the previous chapter when\n\nbe the modern town of Gh\u016briy\u0101n, the name of which recalls the province of Gh\u016br, where the Ghurid Sultans held sway in the latter half of the twelfth century A.D.\nspeaking of Fir\u016bzk\u016bh. Balkh is mentioned as being in ruins, and B\u0101miy\u0101n was in a like condition, Changhiz Kh\u0101n having ordered its utter destruction to avenge the death of a grandson who was killed during the siege, at the time of the Mongol invasion. \u1e6cukh\u0101rist\u0101n is the country along the southern bank of the upper waters of the Oxus, and Panjhir is the name of the silver-mine at the eastern source of the K\u0101bul river. J\u016bzj\u0101n is the district westward of Balkh, of which Shaburk\u0101n and F\u0101ry\u0101b were the chief towns. The first-mentioned still exists, and the position of F\u0101ry\u0101b, which is described by Ibn Hawkal (p. 321) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 840, 888), is fixed by the information given in the Itinerary (Route xii). Khutl\u0101n is the country lying north of the upper waters of the Oxus, Saminj\u0101n lay south-east of Balkh, and T\u0101yik\u0101n is the place which still exists of this name in the extreme east of the province of \u1e6cukh\u0101rist\u0101n, being sometimes, in error, written T\u0101lik\u0101n. The name T\u0101lik\u0101n, however, is more properly given to the city of the J\u016bzj\u0101n district, the name of which has now disappeared from the map, but which, according to the Itinerary (Routes xii and xiiia), lay three marches distant from Marv-ar-R\u016bd (B\u0101l\u0101 Murgh\u0101b) and a little off the high road going from that city to Balkh. This T\u0101lik\u0101n is described by Ibn Hawkal (p. 321), Ya\u1e33\u016bbi (p. 287), and Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 491); it was an important town, and its ruins are probably to be identified with the mounds of brick near Chachaktu, which have been recently examined by Colonel Yate.\n\n1 In this passage, in place of Gh\u016br, many MSS. of the Nuzhat read Gh\u0101ri, and some have Gharjist\u0101n. The name of this region has nothing to do with Georgia, or Gurjist\u0101n, to the north of Armenia, described by Mustawfi in Chapter 6; for Gharjist\u0101n took its name from the ancient kings of northern Afghanistan, called by the Arabs Gharj-ash-Sh\u0101r. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 785, 786, 823) Gharjist\u0101n, often confounded with Gh\u016brist\u0101n, and spelt indifferently Gharsh\u012bst\u0101n or Gharist\u0101n, was the country along the upper waters of the Murgh\u0101b, to the eastward of Marv-ar-r\u016bd. Its limits were Gh\u016br on the one side and Her\u0101t on the other, with Ghaznah to the south-east. The sites of the many towns in Gh\u016br and Gharjist\u0101n, mentioned by the Arab geographers, are completely unknown.\n\n2 See Northern Afghanistan, by C. E. Yate (1888), p. 157. The Chachaktu ruins are forty-five miles as the crow flies from B\u0101l\u0101 Murgh\u0101b, which last, I consider, undoubtedly represents Marv-ar-Rud, and this distance may be counted as the equivalent of three days' march in the hill country. Kal'ah\nKavadiyan still exists to the north-east of Tirmid, which last is on the Oxus, and Kalif is lower down the great river, also on its right bank. Mustawfi gives a long account of Marv-i-Shahijan, or Great Marv, on the Murghab river. This river, as he says (L. 214u), had originally been called the Marv-ab or Marv river, but was in his days generally known as the Ab-i-Razik. The Jihan Numda (p. 328) has Zarbak, and the MSS. give Ab-i-Rubaq or Zarik, as in Yakut (ii, 777), with other variants. It flowed down to Great Marv from Marv-ar-Rud, or Little Marv, which is now represented by the place called Bal Murghab, as stated in a previous note. Abivard [16] still exists, on the desert border north of Kalat-i-Nadir. Khavaran [17], now Khabaran, and Khavardan, its dependency, lie between Kalat-i-Nadir and Sarakhs, which last stands on the lower reach of the Herat river after it has received on its left bank the stream coming down from Tus and Mashhad. Lastly, Marez (Yadaz and Yazan, with other readings, are given in the MSS.) appears to be unknown, and the same remark applies to Kalah May, of which the MSS. also give many diverse readings (Bay, Nar, etc.).\n\nAs stated at the beginning of the chapter, the province of Khurasan in the middle ages extended as far north and east as the bank of the Oxus, which was held to divide the lands of Iran from Turan; and when Mustawfi wrote there appears good evidence for the belief that the Oxus was pouring\n\nWali and Takht-i-Khatun, one or other of which is put forward by Colonel Yate (op. cit., pp. 194-5 and 211) as a possible site for Talikan, being each of them only some twenty-seven miles distant from Bala Murghab, are both of them too near to suit the case. As regards the site of the city of Faryab, this may well have been at the modern Khayrabad, where there is an ancient fort and mounds with ruins, as described by Colonel Yate (op. cit., Map of the North-West Frontier of Afghanistan, and p. 233), who narrates some local legends of past times that have clustered round this site. The name of this Faryab of Juzjan is also spelt Firyaab by Yakut (iii, 888), and it must not be confounded either with Farab, otherwise written Barab (now called Otrar), on the Jaxartes, or with Firab, sometimes written Firab, on the Oxus, at the ferry of Charjuy. It will be noticed also that there were during the Middle Ages three Talikans, viz., Talikan, or Tayikan, the town of Tukharistan which still exists; next, Talikan of Juzjan aforesaid; lastly, the Talikan district in Persian Irak, to the south-west of Kazvin, which has been noticed in Chapter 2.\nits waters into the Caspian Sea, and not, except for an insignificant part, into the Aral, as is now the case.\\footnote{Professor de Goeje has written a most learned and interesting work on this subject (\\textit{Das alte Bett des Oxus}, Leyden, 1876), in which he seeks to discredit the statements of the Persian geographers, and in conclusion gives it as his opinion that the Oxus during all the middle ages (as at the present time) flowed into the Aral. I shall not presume to enter the lists against Professor de Goeje; I only quote in the following passages the authorities on the other side. But I may mention that Sir Henry Rawlinson, who had studied the question as a practical geographer, and knew as well the writings of the Persian and Arab authors, was always of a contrary opinion, holding that from the earlier years of the thirteenth century A.D. down to about the year 1575 the Oxus had continued to have its chief outflow into the Caspian, not into the Aral.}\n\nIn Appendix IV Mustawfi gives a description of the Jayh\u016bn or Am\u016byah (L. 213\\textit{i}, with which compare the Turkish translation in the \\textit{Jih\u0101n Num\u0101}, p. 360), as the Arabs and Persians named the Oxus. The river had two sources, one in Tibet, the other in the Badakhsh\u0101n mountains; and along its upper course five great streams flowed in before it took up the waters of the Wakhsh\u0101b (L. 220\\textit{d}) in the district of \u0160agh\u0101niyan, where stood Tirmid over against Balkh. Flowing on through the desert, the Oxus next came to the Narrows, mentioned also in the Itinerary (Route xix), known as Tang-i-Dah\u0101n-i-Sh\u012br\u2014\u2018the passage of the Lion\u2019s Mouth\u2019\u2014near Buk\u0161ah, of the district of Haz\u0101rasp, where the precipitous banks are hardly a hundred \\textit{gez} (yards) across. This is the gorge which is now known as Deveh Boyun\u2014\u2018the Camel\u2019s Neck\u2019\u2014and according to Mustawfi the stream here passes underground for a couple of leagues completely hidden from sight. From Haz\u0101rasp down to the Aral Sea numerous canals are led off, some ending in the desert, some discharging their water into the Aral; but the main stream, Mustawfi says, after passing Old Urganj, turns down by the \u2018A\u1e33abah-i-Halam (or Salam), which in Turki is called Kurl\u0101di (or Kurl\u0101vah), where the rushing of its waters can be heard two leagues away, and, thence flowing on for a distance of six days\u2019 march, ultimately finds its exit in the Caspian Sea (Ba\u1e25r Khazar) at Khalkh\u0101l, a fishing station.\n\nWhen describing the Caspian (L. 225\\textit{d}), Mustawfi speaks of the Island of \u0100bask\u016bn, and he says \u201cthis island is now\nsunk under the water, because the Oxus, which formerly had flowed into the Eastern Lake (the Aral) lying over against the lands of Gog and Magog, since the time of the Mugh\u0101l invasion has changed its course, and now flows out to the Caspian; and hence, this latter sea having no outlet, the dry land (of the \u0100bask\u016bn island) has now become submerged by the rising level of the waters.\" Now, in regard to this alleged change in the Oxus bed at the epoch of the Mongol invasion, we have the contemporary evidence of Ibn-al-Ath\u012br (xii, 257) that Changhiz Kh\u0101n in 617 (A.D. 1220) sent his armies against Khw\u0101rizm, when, after a siege of five months, Old Urganj was stormed, and the Oxus dykes which protected the city having been cut, the whole country was laid under water. The overflow appears to have drained off to the south-west, following a line of depression to the Caspian; for there is the evidence of Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 670), a contemporary of these events, who describes Mankishl\u0101gh as a strongly fortified castle \"standing on the shore of the Sea of \u1e6cabarist\u0101n (i.e. the Caspian), into which the Jay\u1e25\u016bn now flows.\"\n\nIn the work of H\u0101f\u012bz Abr\u016b, composed in 820 (1417 A.D.) under the patronage of Sh\u0101hr\u016bkh, the son and successor of Timur\u2014and H\u0101f\u012bz Abr\u016b must himself have been well acquainted with the geography of these countries from personal knowledge\u2014we find the statement that the Jay\u1e25\u016bn, \"which of old flowed into the Lake of Khw\u0101rizm (the Aral), having made itself a new bed, now flows out to the Bahr-Khazar (the Caspian) at Kurl\u0101vud or Kurl\u0101vv\u016b, otherwise called Akranchah, by which cause the Aral Sea has come to disappear\" (British Museum Manuscript, Or. 1,577, folio 32b). And again, in the paragraph on the Aral Sea in the same MS. (folio 27b), he says that, while formerly the Jay\u1e25\u016bn had flowed into the Aral, \"now, namely in the year 820, this sea no more exists, for the Jay\u1e25\u016bn has made a new bed to itself, and flows out into the Caspian.\"\n\nFinally, to complete the evidence on the double shifting of the Oxus bed, we have the account by Abu-l-Gh\u0101z\u012b, a native prince of the Urganj region, who states that some\nthirty years before A.H. 1014, the date of his birth, which places the change in about A.D. 1575, the Oxus made itself again a new channel, and turning off at Kara-Uighur-Tukay below Khast-Minarahsi, made its way to Tuk Kal'ahsi and thence out directly to the Aral Sea, thus changing the lands between Urganj and the Caspian into a desert for lack of water. And in another passage he describes how in former times, namely, among the events of the years from 1520 to 1530 A.D., all the way from Urganj, by Pishgah and Kara Kichit, to Uighurchah and Abulkhan on the Caspian, there were cultivated fields and vineyards along what was still, when he wrote, the but half dessicated bed of the Oxus. (French translation by Baron Desmaisons of the History of the Mongols and the Tartars by Abu-l-Ghazi Khan, vol. i, pp. 221 and 312, and Text in vol. ii, pp. 207 and 291, St. Petersburg, 1871.)\n\nIn regard to Khwarizm, now generally called Khivah, which is the Delta land of the Oxus, it will be found that among the Itineraries Mustawfi gives two (Routes xiv and xix) leading across the desert to Urganj, one from Faravah (Kizil Arvat), the other from Great Marv. Khwarizm was at no time counted as of Iran, but, as noticed in the Table of Contents of the Nushat, a short section is devoted to this Province in Part IV of the Third Book, treating of Foreign Lands, which may be summarized in the following concluding paragraph. Unfortunately, the names of towns as given in the MSS. and in the Lithographed text (L. 234g) are extremely corrupt, and, indeed, do not serve to clear up the many queries in regard to the names of stages in the two Routes which lead to Urganj.\n\nHamd-Allah begins by stating that at the time when he wrote the capital city of the country was Urganj, which, however, was then more generally known as Khwarizm (properly the name of the whole province). Formerly, he adds, the capital city was Fil, but the government was shifted first to Manjurah and then to Urganj. The city of Keth had in former times (he says) been known as Jurjaniyah (this, however, is undoubtedly a mistake), and\nhe then names a number of the more important towns, among which are Haz\u0101rasp, Dargh\u0101n, and Madm\u012bniyah, with many others whose names it is impossible to identify, finally Khivah, a small provincial town (or Ka\u1e63bah) which had recently been the abode of the Shaykh Najm-ad-D\u012bn Kubr\u012b. We thus learn that already in the fourteenth century A.D. Khivah was rising to importance; it is merely mentioned in the list of towns by the earlier Arab geographers, but Y\u0101k\u016bt, writing a century before the time of \u1e24amd-Allah, has devoted a short article to it (ii, 512), spelling the name Kh\u012bvak, adding that the common people of Khw\u0101rizm then already called it Khivah. Under the spelling Kh\u012bvak the town and its governor are mentioned by \u2018Al\u012b of Yazd, and this was the scene of one of the early adventures in the life of Timur, who at a later period caused its walls to be carefully rebuilt (\u1e92afar N\u0101mah, i, 62, 449).\n\nChapter 18. M\u0101zandar\u0101n.\n\nContents: Jurj\u0101n city, 190h; Astar\u0101b\u0101d, 190p; \u0100mul, 190q; Dihist\u0101n, 190l; Rustamd\u0101r, 190u; R\u016bghad, 190v; S\u0101r\u012b, 190x; Kab\u016bd J\u0101mah, 190y; Nim-Murd\u0101n, 190z.\n\nThe mountainous region lying along the south coast of the Caspian, towards the east, was called Tabarist\u0101n in the early middle ages, \u1e6cabar having the signification of 'mountain' in the local dialect, whence Tabarist\u0101n would have had the meaning of 'the Mountain Country.' This name, however, about the time of the Mongol conquest, gave place to that of M\u0101zandar\u0101n; the new province being taken to include Jurj\u0101n on the east, which formerly had been reckoned as a separate district and not included in the older \u1e6cabarist\u0101n. M\u0101zandar\u0101n is divided by Mustawfi into seven districts, namely, Jurj\u0101n, M\u016brust\u0101k (with variants Murdist\u0101n, etc.; the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 339, has Bard-M\u016brust\u0101k), Astar\u0101b\u0101d, \u0100mul with Rustamd\u0101r, Dihist\u0101n, R\u016bghad, and Siy\u0101h Rast\u0101n (other variants of this last in... SS. being Wast\u0101n, Sit\u0101n,\nS\u0101rist\u0101n, and in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, S\u0101st\u0101n). Of these seven, the positions of three, namely, of M\u016brust\u0101k, of R\u016bghad, and of Siy\u0101h Rast\u0101n, are entirely unknown, and these names are not apparently mentioned by any other geographer.\n\nIn his Appendix on the Rivers Mustawfi notes that the district of Jurj\u0101n was watered by two rivers, namely, by the lower part of the \u0100b-i-Atrak (L. 212a), which had its springs near Khab\u016bsh\u0101n and in the famous plain of N\u012bs\u0101 (now Darrah-Gaz) of Khur\u0101s\u0101n; and next by the Jurj\u0101n river (L. 213u), on which stood the city of Jurj\u0101n; both the Jurj\u0101n river and the Atrak flowing out to the Caspian within the Jurj\u0101n territory. Jurj\u0101n City in the time of Mustawfi was a ruin, Astar\u0101b\u0101d being the capital of the district. Dihist\u0101n lay on the northern frontier; the ruins of it are probably those now known as Mashhad-i-Mi\u1e63riy\u0101n, and it was the outpost against the Turks and Kurds on the road to Khw\u0101rizm.\n\n\u0100mul has always been the capital of \u1e6cabarist\u0101n, and Rustamd\u0101r is the district already noticed in Chapter 2 as lying along the bank of the Shahr\u016bd which as R\u016bdb\u0101r was counted as of Persian \u1e6ar\u0101\u1e33. According to the Nuzhat R\u016bghad (R\u016b\u02bfad in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 341) was a medium-sized town, being also the name of the surrounding district; the site is unknown, but it lay presumably in \u1e6cabarist\u0101n, among the mountains overlooking the Caspian. The city of S\u0101r\u012b is still a flourishing place, and its district was that which Mustawfi names Kab\u016bd J\u0101mah, while Nim-Murd\u0101n (neither name being mentioned by the Arab geographers, though both are copied into the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 341) was a populous island or peninsula, with Shahr\u0101b\u0101d for chief town, at the south-eastern angle of the Caspian, presumably now represented by the tongue of land forming the northern limit of Astar\u0101b\u0101d Bay. As of \u1e6cabarist\u0101n, Mustawfi mentions the mountains called K\u016bh T\u0101r\u012bk and K\u016bh Haram, or Hajam (L. 205r, 207a), where marvellous caves and wondrous sights were to be seen, but the position of neither mountain is given, and these names do not appear on our present maps.\nChapter 19. K\u016bmis.\n\nContents: Khuv\u0101r, 191d; D\u0101mgh\u0101n, 191e; Samn\u0101n, 191h; Bust\u0101m and \u0100h\u016bv\u0101n, 191j; Girdk\u016bh, 191l; Fir\u016bzk\u016bh, 191m; Dam\u0101vand, 191n; Firrim, 191p; Khurk\u0101n, 191r.\n\nK\u016bmis was the name of the province lying along the desert border south of the great mountains of Tabarist\u0101n; most of the towns mentioned by Mustawfi still are found, but now included in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, for as a separate province K\u016bmis no longer exists, and the name even is gone out of use. In the vicinity of D\u0101mgh\u0101n was a mountain called K\u016bh-i-Zar\u2014'Gold Mountain'\u2014where mines of the precious metal were worked (L. 204q), and D\u0101mgh\u0101n itself is still an important city. Khuv\u0101r [1] is the town now called Arad\u016bn, but the district round is known under the old name, and Khuv\u0101r or Arad\u016bn, called Khuv\u0101r of Ray or Mahallah-i-B\u0101gh, is on the great eastern high road from Ray into Khuras\u0101n (see Route ix). Samn\u0101n [2] stands half-way between Khuv\u0101r and D\u0101mgh\u0101n, Bust\u0101m (Bist\u0101m or Bast\u0101m) lying further to the eastward of this last, while \u0100h\u016bv\u0101n [3] is a Rub\u0101\u1e6d or Guardhouse between D\u0101mgh\u0101n and Samn\u0101n.\n\nThe fortress of Girdk\u016bh [4], called also Diz-i-Gumbadh\u0101n\u2014'the Domed Fort'\u2014lay in the mountains three leagues distant from D\u0101mgh\u0101n, and Mans\u016br\u0101b\u0101d was in its vicinity. The celebrated stronghold of Fir\u016bzk\u016bh [5] stands at the head-waters of the stream flowing down to Khuv\u0101r; due west of it lies the town of Dam\u0101vand [6], which Mustawfi says was originally called Pashy\u0101n, the town lying a considerable distance to the south of the famous Dam\u0101vand mountain of Tabarist\u0101n. The position of Firrim, mentioned also by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iii, 890) and other Arab geographers, has not been identified. Khurk\u0101n was a town of the district of Bust\u0101m, lying four leagues distant therefrom, on the road towards Astar\u0101b\u0101d, as is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (ii, 424) and Kazv\u012bn\u012b (ii, 243).\nChapter 20. Gil\u0101n.\n\nContents: I\u1e63fahbad, 191v; T\u016blim, 191x; Tam\u012bj\u0101n, 191y; Rasht, 191z; Shaft, 192a; F\u016bmin, 192b; K\u016bjasfah\u0101n, 192c; Kawtam, 192d; Karjuy\u0101n, 192e; L\u0101hij\u0101n, 192f; Ta\u2019sar, 192h.\n\nGil\u0101n, or the Jil\u0101nat Province, was backed by the mountains of Daylam, and lay on the shore of the Caspian at the mouth of the river Safid-r\u016bd. I\u1e63fahbad, or Ispahbid, as is well known, was the name given to the semi-independent governors of this province under the Sassanian kings, and the Ispahbids continued to rule as princes under the early Caliphs; the city of Ispahbud\u0101n is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 298) as lying two miles from the sea-shore, but apparently no trace of it now remains. In the time of Mustawfi, however, I\u1e63fahbad was a medium-sized town surrounded by a district with nearly a hundred villages, and its revenues amounted to 29,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, or about \u00a37,000. T\u016blim is now the name of a district lying west of Rasht, the town of T\u016blim [1] having presumably gone to ruin, both this and the town of Tam\u012bj\u0101n (or Taymj\u0101n) having disappeared from the map. Mustawfi is one of the first authorities to mention Rasht,\u00b9 now the chief town of Gil\u0101n, and it was already in his day famous for its silk stuffs.\n\nThe town of Shaft [2] no longer exists, but the district of this name lies south of Rasht, and to the westward of it is the F\u016bmin [3] district, with the town of F\u016bmin as its chief place. Of K\u016bjasfah\u0101n (Kujast\u0101n is the spelling given in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 344, with Kujk\u0101n, K\u016bjfah\u0101n, and other\n\n\u00b9 In the Catalogue of Oriental Coins in the British Museum (vols. iii, 52, 63, and ix, 282), a series of copper coins is described, bearing the numbers 107, 107a, 107b, 108, which are dated 595 A.H. and 598 A.H., and attributed to the mint-city of Rasht. These coins bear the name and titles of Sulaym\u0101n II, the Saljuks Sultan of R\u016bm, and if the reading Rasht be accepted, would go to prove that the Saljuks of R\u016bm exercised sovereign rights in Gil\u0101n, and that Rasht was already an important city at the close of the sixth century A.H. The reading, however, does not appear, on examination of the coins, to be tenable; and the facts as known to us from history are decidedly against Rasht having ever belonged to Sulaym\u0101n II of R\u016bm.\nreadings in the MSS.), originally built by Ardashir B\u0101bg\u0101n and named Sahmish, nothing is now known; and the same has to be said of the town of Karjuy\u0101n, given also as Kirj\u0101n or Ka\u1e25y\u0101n in the MSS., but not named elsewhere. Kawtam [4], on the sea-shore, a good port near the mouth of the Safid-r\u016bd, though mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (iv, 316), is apparently now lost, being represented by the modern K\u016bhdam district lying eastward of Shaft. L\u0101hij\u0101n [5] still exists, and by Mustawfi is held to be the capital of Gil\u0101n, being famous for its fruit gardens; but for Ta\u2019sar, the last place mentioned in the list (with variants in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 344, of Bish\u012bsh\u0101h, also N\u012bsar, Nir, and Tastar in the MSS.), I am unable to offer any identification.\nAPPENDIX I. THE ITINERARIES.\n\nFor convenience of reference the Itineraries given consecutively by Mustawfi are in the following pages divided up into thirty-three Routes. Many of these are identical with the routes given by Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih and Kud\u0101mah in their Road-books, and are found in other of the medi\u00e6val Arab geographers. Some of the routes not given by the Arabs are found copied from Mustawfi into the pages of the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 of \u1e24\u0101jj\u012b Khalfah. The distances are given in Farsakhs, each equivalent to a league, or one hour's march.\n\nRoute I.\u2014Sult\u0101niyah to Hamad\u0101n and Kanguvar (L. 192w).\u2014Sult\u0101niyah 5 farsakhs to Bajsh\u012br village, thence 4 to the Rib\u0101\u1e6d of Atabeg Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ildagiz, thence 4 to Karkahar village in the Hamad\u0101n province, thence 6 to \u0160\u0101j\u012b village of Hamad\u0101n, thence 5 to Walaj village, thence 6 to the city of Hamad\u0101n, thence by the pass over mount Arvand (Elvend) in 7 farsakhs to Asad\u0101b\u0101d, and thence 6 to Kanguvar, the first village in Kurdist\u0101n.\n\nAs far as Hamad\u0101n these stages are not given in any of the Arab Itineraries\u2014Sult\u0101niyah, as already said, only having been built and made the capital of the \u012alkh\u0101ns in the reign of Uljayt\u016b\u2014and most of the names of places mentioned in the list are uncertain. Thus, D\u012bh Bajsh\u012br is given in the various MSS. as Lajshir, Val\u0101shjird, and D\u012bh Baksh\u012bh (D\u012bh being the Persian for \u2018village,\u2019 omitted or added, indifferently), and this may be Bijtayn, a village at the right distance south of Sult\u0101niyah; the various readings given above would then be due merely to confusion in the placing of diacritical points. For D\u012bh Karkahar some MSS. have Karkaharand, possibly for the present Kabatrung.\n\n1 Much of this country is described in Notes of a Journey from Kazveen to Hamadan, by J. D. Rees (Madras, 1856), but the names given by Mustawfi do not occur.\nVariants of S\u0101j\u012b are S\u0101hib\u012b, Mas\u0101h-jin, and S\u0101j\u016b. Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ildagiz, the founder of the Rib\u0101t mentioned above, was Atabeg of Adharbayj\u0101n and virtual ruler of \u2018Ir\u0101k from 568 to 581 (1172 to 1185). The word Rib\u0101t (pronounced also Rub\u0101t and Rab\u0101t), which occurs frequently in the names of post-stations, means literally \u2018a tying-up place\u2019 and came to signify a hospice, or guardhouse, notably on the frontier.\n\nRoute II.\u2014Kanguv\u0101r to \u1e24ulw\u0101n (L.192z).\u2014Kanguv\u0101r in 5 farsakhs to S\u012bnah village, thence 4 to Jamjam\u0101l City, thence in 6 farsakhs\u2014the statue of the horse Shabd\u012bz lying to the right of the road, with the portraits of King Khusraw and Queen Shir\u012bn at a place where two springs gush out that turn two mills\u2014to Kirm\u0101nsh\u0101h\u0101n, thence 6 to Khushkarish, thence 5 to J\u0101k\u0101v\u0101n, thence 6 to the villages of Kirind and Kh\u016bsh\u0101n, thence by the Pass of T\u0101k-i-Kiz\u0101 in 8 farsakhs to \u1e24ulw\u0101n city, the first place in Arabian \u2018Ir\u0101k; but by the Gil wa Gil\u0101n road this last stage is easier, though one farsakh longer.\n\nThe stages from Hamad\u0101n going south-west, but given the reverse way, are part of the great eastern high road leading from Baghd\u0101d to Marv, found in all the Arab Itineraries. Khushkarish is the reading in Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p.19); the Nuzhat MSS. give various readings, as Hak\u0101rmish, Chak\u0101rish, etc., and no place of this name now exists. The next place, J\u0101k\u0101v\u0101n, is not identical with any stage mentioned by the Arab Itineraries, and many variants are given, e.g., D\u012bh \u1e2ais\u0101kav\u0101n, Khaf\u0101rk\u0101n, \u1e24af\u0101kad\u0101n, Jan\u0101k\u0101n, and Khiy\u0101rkav\u0101n. No village of Kh\u016bsh\u0101n (or \u1e24arsh\u0101n as a variant) is to be found on the map anywhere near Kirind; but the road down by Gil wa Gil\u0101n, and the T\u0101k-i-Kiz\u0101 pass, are mentioned (L. 216n) as the place where one of the affluents of the Nahraw\u0101n takes its rise (see above, Chapter 1).\n\nRoute III.\u2014\u1e24ulw\u0101n to Baghd\u0101d and Najaf (L.193c).\u2014\u1e24ulw\u0101n in 5 farsakhs to \u1e32a\u1e63r Shir\u012bn, thence 5 to Kh\u0101n\u012b\u1e33\u012bn city, thence 5 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Jal\u016bl\u0101 built by Malik-Sh\u0101h the Salj\u016bk, thence 5\nto \u1e24ar\u016bn\u012byah, thence\u2014with Shahrab\u0101n lying 2 farsakhs distant to the right of the road\u2014in 7 farsakhs to Ba\u02bfk\u016bb\u0101 city, and thence 8 to Baghd\u0101d. From Baghd\u0101d it is 2 farsakhs to \u0160arsar village, thence 7 to Far\u0101shah, thence in 7 farsakhs\u2014the city of B\u0101bil lying on the Euphrates half a league away on the right hand\u2014to the Nil Canal, then 2 farsakhs to the city of Hillah, thence\u2014passing the place where Nimrod threw Abraham into the Fire at K\u016bth\u0101 Rabb\u0101, lying one league to the left of the road\u2014after 7 farsakhs comes the city of K\u016bfah, thence 2 farsakhs distant lies the Mashhad (Place of Martyrdom) of \u2018Al\u012b, the Commander of the Faithful, at Najaf on the desert border.\n\nMost of the places mentioned in this and the next two Routes are given on my Map for Ibn Serapion. The Rub\u0101\u1e6d (Guardhouse) of Jal\u016bl\u0101, a place famous in Abbasid history, is probably the present Caravanserai of K\u0131z\u0131l Rub\u0101\u1e6d. Dih Far\u0101shah, nine leagues south of Baghd\u0101d, is not given by any other authority; other variants in the MSS. are Kar\u0101jah, Khaw\u0101shah, and B\u0101diyah-Farrash\u2014\u2018the Carpet-spreader\u2019s plain\u2019\u2014but the readings are most uncertain. The text of the Nuzhat after this gives the Routes beyond Najaf for the pilgrims crossing Arabia to Mecca and Medina, but these are here omitted, as belonging to countries outside the limits of \u012ar\u0101n, with which alone the present paper deals.\n\nRoute IV.\u2014Baghd\u0101d to Ba\u1e63rah, and thence by sea to the Island of Kays (L. 195g).\u2014Baghd\u0101d 5 farsakhs to Mad\u0101\u02bein, thence 10 to Dayr-al-\u02bf\u0100k\u016bl, thence 7 to Jabbul, thence 10 to Fam-\u0101s-\u1e62ilh, thence 9 to W\u0101sit, thence 10 to Nahrab\u0101n, thence 8 to F\u0101r\u016bth, thence 5 to Dayr-al-\u02bfUmm\u0101l, thence 7 to \u1e24aw\u0101n\u012bt; thence passing by the canal called the Shatt-al-M\u0101\u02be to the Swamps, and on through the Nahr-al-Asad, after 30 farsakhs is the beginning of the Blind Tigris estuary, by which and the Nahr Ma\u02bekil after 10 farsakhs is Ba\u1e63rah. From Ba\u1e63rah it is 12 farsakhs to \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n, whence 2 by fresh water to the open sea, thence 50 leagues to Kh\u0101rik Island, thence 80 leagues to Al-\u0100n Island, thence 7 to Abr\u016bn Island, thence 8 to the island of Ch\u012bn or Khayn, which is uninhabited, and thence 8 to the emporium of Kays Island.\nThe towns on this and the next two Routes will be found on the Ibn Serapion Map. For the islands in the Persian Gulf, see above, Chapter 12; a part of this Route is given in the Jih\u0101n Numa, p. 456.\n\nRoute V.\u2014Baghd\u0101d to Rahbah (L. 195v).\u2014Baghd\u0101d 3 farsakhs to Tall-\u2018A\u1e33ark\u016bf, which is a hillock so high that it can be seen from the desert eleven leagues away; thence 8 farsakhs to the city of Anb\u0101r; thence by the way across the Samaw\u0101t desert you may reach Damascus direct in ten days, it being 100 leagues distant; or from Anb\u0101r you go to Rahbah (on the Euphrates), which last is 70 leagues from Baghd\u0101d.\n\nRoute VI.\u2014Baghd\u0101d to Mosul (L. 195z).\u2014Baghd\u0101d 4 farsakhs to Barad\u0101n, thence 5 to \u2018Ukbarah, thence 3 to B\u0101\u1e25amsh\u0101, thence 7 to K\u0101disiyah, thence 3 to S\u0101marrah, thence 2 to Karkh, thence 7 to Jabult\u0101, thence 5 to Sudak\u0101niyah, thence 5 to B\u016brimm\u0101, thence 5 to the Bridge over the Lesser Z\u0101b, a tributary of the Tigris, thence 12 to \u1e24ad\u012bthah, thence 7 to Ban\u012b Tam\u2018\u0101n, and finally 14 farsakhs to Maw\u1e63il (Mosul).\n\nThe name of the place called B\u0101\u1e25amsh\u0101 or B\u0101jamsh\u0101 by Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 93), a dozen leagues north of Baghd\u0101d, is uncertain; the Nuzhat MSS. give the name variously as Jam\u012b\u2018\u0101, \u1e24ams\u0101sah, and \u1e24amy\u0101, with other variations. Ban\u012b Tam\u2018\u0101n, the last stage before Mosul, is also uncertain; variants are Ban\u012b Tah\u0101n in the MSS., and in Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 93) \u1e6camy\u0101n, \u1e6cahm\u0101n, etc., are given.\n\nRoute VII.\u2014Kanguv\u0101r to Isfah\u0101n (L. 195q).\u2014Kanguv\u0101r 5 farsakhs to Bidast\u0101n, thence 3 to Nih\u0101vand city, thence 4 to Far\u0101murz village, thence 4 to the city of Bur\u016bjird. Beyond Bur\u016bjird the road to S\u016bb\u016brkhw\u0101st turns off to the right hand, while going left from Bur\u016bjird it is 4 farsakhs to \u1e24asan\u0101b\u0101d, thence 8 to Miy\u0101n-R\u016bd\u0101n, thence 3 to Min\u0101r, thence 5 to the city of Karaj. From Karaj it is 4 farsakhs to D\u016bns\u016bn, thence 5 to \u0100san: here the more direct road to Isfah\u0101n turns off to the right, while going left from \u0100san it is 6 farsakhs to Sang\u0101n, thence 6 to J\u016by-Murgh-Kuhtar, thence 7 to Ashkur\u0101n, thence 7 to Tir\u0101n, thence 6 to J\u016by-i-Kushk, and finally 4 leagues to Isfah\u0101n.\nThe road going eastward from Kanguv\u0101r to Isfah\u0101n, in the Arab Itineraries, follows a different route to the one given by Mustawfi, though both pass by Karaj of Abu Dulaf, the position of which has been noticed in Chapter 2. The MSS. give a few variants; the name of the village of Far\u0101murz beyond Nih\u0101vand is written Kar\u0101kirk in some copies, and Hasan\u0101b\u0101d appears as Jun\u0101b\u0101d. Miy\u0101n-R\u016bd\u0101n\u2014'Between Streams'\u2014is on the upper waters of the eastern tributary of the Bur\u016bjird river, south-east of this town and south-west of Karaj of Abu Dulaf. From Karaj to Isfah\u0101n many of the places named on the map are not found, and the variants in the MSS. are \u0100san or M\u0101san; for Sang\u0101n, Sitak\u0101n or Sakw\u012bn. Ashk\u016br\u0101n or Ashghur\u0101n is marked on the map and given by Y\u0101k\u016bt (i, 281) as Ashk\u016br\u0101n; he also mentions (i, 446) B\u0101b Kushk as one of the great quarters at the gate of Isfah\u0101n, and though this name has now disappeared, Tir\u0101n is a village marked on the map.\n\nRoute VIII.\u2014Sult\u0101n\u012byah to S\u016bmgh\u0101n (L. 196d).\u2014Sult\u0101n\u012byah in 5 farsakhs to the village of Kuh\u016bd, which the Mugh\u0101ls call S\u0101'in Kal'ah, thence 4 to the city of Abhar, thence 4 to F\u0101risj\u012bn, thence\u2014with the city of Kazv\u012bn lying 4 leagues distant on the left hand\u2014in 6 farsakhs to S\u016bmgh\u0101n, which the Mugh\u0101ls call Ak Khw\u0101jah. Beyond this place the way divides; to the right one road turns off, going to Sagz\u0101b\u0101d in 5 farsakhs (see Route XXVI), while the main road towards Khur\u0101s\u0101n continues onward, as given in the next Route.\n\nThe name Kuh\u016bd is now not known, S\u0101'in Kal'ah having taken its place; the three next places will all be found on the map. S\u016bmgh\u0101n, however, is wanting, and apparently is not mentioned by any other geographer; also the reading of the name is uncertain. \u1e24amd-Allah, as will have been seen in Chapter 15, gives it as the uppermost limit of the Great Desert, and in the various MSS. the name appears as Sum\u1e33\u0101n, Suwik\u0101n, S\u016bsk\u0101n or S\u016bshk\u0101n, S\u016bbi\u1e33\u0101n, Siy\u016bti'\u0101n, and S\u016bs'an. It evidently was a place of some importance, and its position is fixed by the distances given between it, F\u0101risj\u012bn, Kazv\u012bn, and Sagz\u0101b\u0101d or Sagzi\u0101b\u0101d.\nRoute IX.\u2014S\u016bmgh\u0101n to Bust\u0101m (L. 196d).\u2014S\u016bmgh\u0101n in 5 farsakhs to the village of M\u0101marah, thence 8 to Dahand, thence 5 to Sunkur\u0101b\u0101d, thence 5 to D\u012bh Kh\u0101t\u016bn, thence 5 to the Place of Martyrdom (Mashhad) of the Im\u0101m-z\u0101dah \u2018Abd-al-\u2018Az\u012bm, thence 3 to the city of Ray, thence 6 to Var\u0101m\u012bn, thence 6 to the Rub\u0101t of Khum\u0101rtakin, thence 6 to Khuv\u0101r of Ray, which is called Mahallah-i-B\u0101gh (the Garden-Place), thence 6 to D\u012bh Namak (Salt Village), thence 6 to R\u0101s-al-Kalb (Dog\u2019s Head), thence 6 to D\u012bh Surkh (Red Village), thence 4 to Samn\u0101n, thence 7 to Rub\u0101t \u0100huv\u0101n, thence 7 to Rub\u0101t Hurmuz, also known as Jarm-J\u016by (Hot-stream), thence 6 to D\u0101mgh\u0101n, thence 6 to Hadd\u0101dah, otherwise known as Mihm\u0101n-d\u016bst (Guest-friend). From this place one road branches to the right, going direct to N\u012bsh\u0101pur by Sabziv\u0101r; to the left is the high road which passes through J\u0101jarm, and from \u1e24add\u0101dah by this it is 7 farsakhs to the city of Bust\u0101m.\n\nThe name M\u0101marah, one stage out from S\u016bmgh\u0101n, is uncertain; the MSS. give various readings, as Y\u0101harah, M\u0101rbin, H\u0101mr\u012bn, and H\u0101marah. Also the next stage is variously given as D\u012bhand, D\u012bh Pahand, or Sahand, and this name occurs again as one among the villages of K\u0101z\u012bn mentioned in Chapter 2 (L. 146r). The remaining stations are for the most part those of the Arab itineraries, and will be found on the map; R\u0101s-al-Kalb (Dog\u2019s Head), which Y\u0101k\u016bt (ii, 733) refers to as a Kal\u2019ah or Castle, is possibly identical with the present Lasjird, as already stated in the Introduction. Places named in the next two Routes have already been noticed in Chapters 17 and 19, or else will be found on our present maps; these being also for the most part identical with the stages given in the Arab itineraries.\n\nRoute X.\u2014Bust\u0101m to N\u012bsh\u0101pur (L. 196m).\u2014From the city of Bust\u0101m it is 7 farsakhs to Maghaz, thence 7 to Sult\u0101niyah village (or D\u012bh-i-Sult\u0101n), thence 3 to Rub\u0101t Savanj, and thence 6 to J\u0101jarm. From J\u0101jarm it is 8 farsakhs to the village of \u0100zadv\u0101r, the birthplace of Khw\u0101jah Shams-ad-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad S\u0101\u1e25ib Div\u0101n, thence 4 to Kh\u016bd\u0101sh\u0101h, thence 3 to Bahr\u0101b\u0101d village, the abode of Shaykh Sa\u2019d-ad-D\u012bn of Ham\u0101h, thence 5 to Barzam\u0101b\u0101d, thence 4 to T\u016bdah (or N\u016bdah), thence\n8 to Tak\u0101n-k\u016bh, thence 6 to Rub\u0101t B\u016bzinag\u0101n at the village of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and thence 4 farsakhs to N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br.\n\nRoute XI.\u2014N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br to Sarakhs and Marv-ar-R\u016bd (L. 196u).\u2014N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br 7 farsakhs to Dih B\u0101d, whence the road to Her\u0101t branches to the right hand (Route XV); and from Dih B\u0101d, turning left, it is 5 leagues to Kh\u0101kistar village, thence 3 to Rub\u0101t Sangbast, thence 6 to Rub\u0101t M\u0101h\u012b, thence 7 to Rub\u0101t T\u016br\u0101n (or N\u016br\u0101n); thence in 7 farsakhs, across two passes each of half a league, you go to Rub\u0101t \u0100bg\u012bnah, thence 6 to Sarakhs, thence 9 to Rub\u0101t Ja'far\u012b, thence 7 to Mil 'Om\u0101r\u012b, thence 7 to Rub\u0101t Abu Nu'aym, thence 5 farsakhs across the desert sands with no water to \u0100b-Sh\u016br, thence 2 to Diz Hind, and thence 5 to the city of Marv-ar-R\u016bd.\n\nRoute XII.\u2014Marv-ar-R\u016bd to Balkh and the Oxus (L. 197a).\u2014Marv-ar-R\u016bd 7 farsakhs to Rub\u0101t-i-Sult\u0101n, thence 5 to the village of Karaj\u0101b\u0101d (or K\u016bch\u0101bad), thence in 7 farsakhs\u2014the city of T\u0101lik\u0101n lying 6 leagues distant on the right hand of the road\u2014to \u0100b-i-Garm (Hot-Spring), thence 5 to Kab\u016btar-kh\u0101nah; thence 7 to Masjid R\u0101z\u0101n; thence in 7 farsakhs\u2014the city of F\u0101ry\u0101b lying two leagues distant on the right of the road\u2014to Ast\u0101nah, thence 6 to Rub\u0101t Ka'b, thence 9 farsakhs across a waterless plain to the city of Shaburk\u0101n. Thence it is 2 farsakhs to the village of Sulbar\u0101n, thence 9 to Rub\u0101t 'Alaw\u012b (the Alid Guardhouse), thence 1 to Dastagird, thence 5 to the village of P\u0101rah at the Bridge of Jam\u016bkh\u012by\u0101n, and thence 2 to Balkh. From the city of Balkh it is 6 farsakhs to Siy\u0101h-k\u016bh (the Black Hills), and thence in 6 farsakhs you come to the Oxus river over against Tirmid.\n\nRoute XIIa.\u2014In the British Museum MS. (Add. 16,736) is the following duplication, in part, of the preceding route:\u2014Marv-ar-R\u016bd 5 farsakhs to Araskan, thence 7 to Asr\u0101b, thence 6 to Ganj\u0101bad, thence 6 to T\u0101lik\u0101n, thence 5 to Kashh\u0101n, thence 5 to Argh\u016bn in the district of J\u016bzj\u0101n, thence 5 to \u1e32asr H\u016b\u1e6d; thence 5 to F\u0101ry\u0101b, thence 9 to K\u0101'; thence 9 to Shaburk\u0101n, thence 6 to \u015aidrah, thence 5 to Dastagird, thence 4 to 'Awd, and thence it is 3 farsakhs to Balkh.\n\nThe first of these two routes is given, in part, in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 329), and between them they fix within narrow limits the positions of T\u0101lik\u0101n and F\u0101ry\u0101b, two\nimportant towns of the J\u016bzj\u0101n District, the names of which have apparently entirely disappeared from the map. Their probable sites have been discussed in Chapter 17.\n\nRoute XIII.\u2014Bus\u1e6d\u0101m to Far\u0101vah (L. 197/').\u2014From Bus\u1e6d\u0101m by the pass called Nardib\u0101n-Payah it is 7 farsakhs to Dih Ganj, thence 6 to the village of Milab\u0101d, thence 5 to M\u016bs\u0101-\u0101b\u0101d village, thence 5 to the city of Jurj\u0101n. From Jurj\u0101n there are two roads to the northern frontier\u2014one direct by the waterless desert, the other by Dihist\u0101n. By this last from Jurj\u0101n it is 9 farsakhs to Bist\u0101n, thence 7 to the village of Mu\u1e25ammad\u0101b\u0101d, thence 7 to Dihist\u0101n; from here it is 7 farsakhs to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Kurs\u012b (or Gazb\u012bn\u012b), thence 9 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Abu-l-\u2018Abb\u0101s, thence 7 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Ibn \u1e6c\u0101hir, and thence 7 farsakhs to the city of Far\u0101vah.\n\nThe MSS. give many variants both in this and the next route for the intermediate stages, which in the desert were mostly Rub\u0101\u1e6ds or Guardhouses. For the part north of Jurj\u0101n city Sir H. C. Rawlinson may be consulted in the Proceedings of the Roy. Geog. Soc., 1879 (i, 170), and for Bist\u0101n, which the MSS. give variously as B\u0101raz, S\u0101rar, S\u0101r-r\u016bd, and Sard-r\u016bd, he adopts the reading Sin\u0101bar-r\u016bd, \u201ca name restored to agree with the modern Sunibar.\u201d Far\u0101vah, a place frequently mentioned by the Arab geographers, is probably to be identified with the modern K\u0131z\u0131l Arv\u0101t, this last being a corruption for K\u0131z\u0131l-Rub\u0101\u1e6d, \u2018the Red Guardhouse.\u2019\n\nRoute XIV.\u2014Far\u0101vah to Urganj (L. 197/').\u2014From the city of Far\u0101vah it is 8 farsakhs to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Khisht-Pukhtah, thence 8 to Kh\u016bsh\u0101b, thence 7 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d \u1e6caghm\u0101j, thence 7 to Karv\u0101n-g\u0101h, thence 9 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Sarhang, thence 7 to Min\u0101rah-g\u0101h, thence 8 to Sail-Bali, thence 7 to Mushk Mabn\u0101, thence 9 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Maryam, thence 8 to the town of New Khw\u0101rizm, thence 6 to New \u1e24alam (or Khulm), and thence 4 farsakhs to Urganj, the capital of Khw\u0101rizm.\n\nThe stages of this desert road to Urganj, the city which the Arabs knew as Jurj\u0101n\u012byah, are given with a variety of readings in the MSS. The variants, however, are of no\ngreat importance, since the stages merely represent halting-places, not towns or villages. Khw\u0101rizm-i-Naw \u2014 New Khw\u0101rizm\u2014must be the capital of the province built to replace the town destroyed by the Mongols, and the ruins of New Khw\u0101rizm are now known as Old Urganj\u2014Kuhnah Urganj; but what the place which Mustawfi calls \u1e24alam or Khulm-i-Naw may represent\u2014lying between the newer and the old capital of his time\u2014it is difficult to determine. For Khw\u0101rizm in general see the concluding paragraphs of Chapter 17; also below, Route XIX.\n\nRoute XV.\u2014N\u012bsh\u0101pur to Her\u0101t (L. 197r).\u2014N\u012bsh\u0101pur in 7 farsakhs to Dih-B\u0101d, where the road to Sarakhs already given (Route XI) goes off to the left, thence 7 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d-Badi\u02bfi, thence 7 to Farh\u0101d\u0101n village, thence 7 to Sa\u02bfid\u0101b\u0101d village, thence 5 to Dih Khusr\u016b, thence 7 to the city of B\u016bjk\u0101n (or B\u016bzj\u0101n), thence 6 to Gul\u0101b\u0101d, thence 10 to K\u016bshk Man\u1e63\u016br, thence 6 to the city of F\u016bshanj (or B\u016bshanj), and thence 8 farsakhs to Her\u0101t.\n\nDih-B\u0101d\u2014\u2018the windy village\u2019\u2014is the place named in the Arab itineraries Ka\u1e63r-ar-R\u012b\u1e25, which has a similar signification; it is now called Dizb\u0101d-P\u0101y\u012bn. As noticed in Chapter 17, the city of B\u016bjk\u0101n, or B\u016bzj\u0101n, also written in two words P\u016bch-K\u0101n, is by the Arab geographers called Z\u0101m or J\u0101m, and is now known as Turbat-i-Shaykh-J\u0101m, from the tomb of the Saint buried here. F\u016bshanj or B\u016bshanj (see also Chapter 17) is the modern Gh\u016briy\u0101n, but when the town took this last name appears to be unknown.\n\nRoute XVI.\u2014N\u012bsh\u0101pur to Tursh\u012bz (L. 197x).\u2014From N\u012bsh\u0101pur going through a populous, well-watered country where are 80 villages, it is 5 farsakhs to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Sih Dih (Guardhouse of the Three Villages), thence 4 farsakhs to Rub\u0101\u1e6d N\u016br-Kh\u0101n, thence 3 to Ch\u0101h Siy\u0101h (Black Pit), thence 5 to the village of D\u0101yah, thence 4 to Dih Murd, and thence 7 farsakhs to Tursh\u012bz. From Tursh\u012bz it is 25 farsakhs to T\u016bn, and 36 to K\u0101y\u012bn, and likewise 36 to B\u016bjk\u0101n.\n\nOf the route here given none of the villages appear now to exist; their names are not found in the Arab itineraries;\nand further, the readings of the *Nushat* are uncertain. In the MSS. the first stage out is often given as Rub\u0101t Sayyidi Ghar. D\u012bh D\u0101yah appears as D\u0101nah, D\u0101r, or V\u0101nah; D\u012bh Murd as Nimr, Nimrud, \u2018Umrad, or Bamr\u016b, also as D\u012bh Ghar.\n\nThe following Route is not found in the Bombay Lithographed Text; it is practically identical with the road described by Mukaddas\u012b (p. 350) and the other Arab geographers.\n\n**Route XVII.**\u2014Her\u0101t to Zaranj, given in the British Museum MS. (Add. 16,736).\u2014Her\u0101t one march to Jam\u0101n, thence the same to K\u016bh-i-Siy\u0101h (Black Hills), thence the same to Kan\u0101t Sar\u0101y, thence the same to Kh\u016bst\u0101n (or J\u0101st\u0101n), which is Asfus\u0101r, thence the same to K\u016bst\u0101n, thence the same to Darah, thence the same to the city of Farah, thence the same to P\u016bl-i-R\u016bd-i-Farah (Bridge over the Farah river), thence the same to Sirishk, thence the same to Kanjar, thence the same to Bast (or Bastak), thence the same to Juvayn, thence the same to Bastar, thence in 4 farsakhs you come to and cross the Hirmand river to Kark\u016byah, and thence in 3 farsakhs to (Zaranj, capital of) S\u012bst\u0101n.\n\n**Route XVIII.**\u2014Her\u0101t to Marv-ar-R\u016bd and on to the city of Marv (L. 198a).\u2014Her\u0101t in 5 farsakhs to Hang\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, thence 5 to B\u0101dg\u012bs, thence 5 to T\u016bn, thence 5 to Marghz\u0101r Darrah, thence 8 to Baghch\u012b Sh\u016br, thence 5 to Usf\u016bd (or L\u016bn-r\u016bd), thence 4 farsakhs to Marv-ar-R\u016bd. From Marv-ar-R\u016bd it is 5 farsakhs to \u1e34\u0101sr A\u1e25naf ibn Kays, thence 4 to Khawr\u0101t (Khawrz\u0101n or Kh\u016br\u0101b), thence 6 to Asad\u016bb\u0101d (or Astar\u016bb\u0101d), thence 7 to Kar\u012bnayn, thence 5 to Yahy\u0101-\u0101b\u0101d, thence 7 to Mahdi \u0101b\u0101d, thence 6 to F\u0101z, and thence 7 farsakhs to the city of Marv.\n\nThe first part of this route, from Her\u0101t to Marv-ar-R\u016bd (B\u0101la Murgh\u0101b), for the most part is identical with that given in the Arab itineraries; it lies through a country where now there are no towns and hardly any villages, though in the middle ages B\u0101dg\u012bs was a populous province.\n\nFrom Marv-ar-R\u016bd to Great Marv the route is that of the Arab geographers, and follows the course of the river Murgh\u0101b; \u1e34\u0101sr A\u1e25naf is the present Mar\u016bchak or Marv-i-Kachik (Little Marv), ha\npalaces of Ahnaf, son of Kays, the Arab leader in the first Moslem conquest of Khurasan. The stages named are not those now found on the map.\n\nRoute XIX.\u2014Marv to Urganj (L. 198e).\u2014Marv in 5 farsakhs to Dih Sakri, thence 2 to Dih Abdun Ganj, thence 8 to Rubat Suran, thence 5 to Chah Khak (Dry Well), thence 7 to Chah Sachi, thence 7 to Chah Harun; thence in 7 farsakhs\u2014of which 2,000 yards are across the Moving Sands\u2014to Rubat-i-Naw-Shagird, thence 7 to Sangabad, thence 6 to Rubat Tahiri, thence 5 to Rubat Budinah, thence crossing the frontier of Khwarizm in 7 leagues to the city of Jakarband, thence 9 to Darghan, a city of Khwarizm, thence 5 to the Rubat of Dahani-Shir (the Guardhouse of the Lion's Mouth), where precipitous rocks form the Narrows of the Oxus, thence 4 to Sadur (or Sandbur), thence 10 to Hazarasp, thence 9 to Dih-Zarduk, thence 7 to Rakhushmihan, thence 6 to Andarabiyan (Andarabnau or Uzarmand), thence 2 to the city of Nuzvar (Ruzvand or Suravan), and thence 6 farsakhs to the city of Urganj, the capital of Khwarizm.\n\nThis route is also given in the Jihan Numah (p. 457), but the first portion across the desert is not found in any of the earlier Arab geographers. The names of the stages here are many of them uncertain, being differently written in the various MSS. of the Nushat. Cultivation began at Rubat Tahiri, or Tahiriya, on the Oxus, the first place in Khwarizm. This is mentioned by the Arab geographers, who name many of the stages given after this in their notices of the Khwarizm Province. The Narrows of the Camel's Neck, or Lion's Mouth, have been referred to in Chapter 17; but the names of the stages between Hazarasp and Urganj are most uncertain, and should be compared with those given by Mukaddasi (p. 344).\n\nRoute XX.\u2014Sultaniyah to Bajavvan (L. 198n).\u2014Sultaniyah in 5 farsakhs to Zanjjan, thence 7 to the village of Tut (or Bub) Suvari, thence 7 to the city of Kaghadh Kunan, thence by the Pass of Burulaz on the river Safid-rud in 6 farsakhs to the village of Sanjidah and Khalkhal, thence 6 to the\nvillage of M\u0101l\u012bsh (B\u0101l\u012bsh, or T\u0101l\u012bsh), thence 6 to the city of Ardab\u012bl, thence 8 to Rub\u0101t Arshad, thence 8 to the village of Varan\u1e33, to the east of which, one farsakh distant, lies Barzand, formerly a city, now a mere village, and thence 4 farsakhs to B\u0101jarv\u0101n, formerly a city, now only a village.\n\nThis route, which is found in the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 389), gives the position of K\u0101ghadh Kun\u0101n or Kh\u016bnaj, already mentioned in Chapter 2, which was a mint city. The name of the pass near the Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd is doubtful; it is variously given in the MSS. as Girivah-i-Pardahl\u012bs, Buzurgtar, or Bar\u016blah, and the Sanj\u012bdah is also a river mentioned among the affluents flowing into the Saf\u012bd-r\u016bd. North of Ardab\u012bl the ruins of Barzand exist, and this fixes the position of B\u0101jarv\u0101n; for Arshad some MSS. give Arand; and for Varan\u1e33 the variants are Varla\u1e33, Dhar\u012b\u1e33, Dart\u0101\u1e33, with other readings.\n\nMany of the places on this route, with those to be mentioned in Route xxi, have been already referred to in the notes to Chapter 4 on M\u016bgh\u0101n.\n\nRoute XXI.\u2014B\u0101jarv\u0101n to Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d (L. 198s).\u2014B\u0101jarv\u0101n in 8 farsakhs to P\u012blsuv\u0101r, thence 6 to J\u016by-i-naw (New Canal), and thence 6 to Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d G\u0101vb\u0101r\u012b.\n\nRoute XXII.\u2014B\u0101jarv\u0101n to Tiflis (L. 198u).\u2014B\u0101jarv\u0101n in 7 farsakhs to the village of \u2018Al\u012b Beg, thence 6 to the village of Bakr\u0101b\u0101d, thence 2 to the bank of the river Aras, which is the frontier of Kar\u0101b\u0101gh, thence 3 to the village of Har, thence 5 to Ghark, thence 4 to the village of Laband\u0101n, thence 3 to B\u0101z\u0101rch\u016bk, thence 4 to the city of Bard\u0101\u2019, thence 1 to the city of J\u016bzb\u012b\u1e33, thence 4 to D\u012bh Isfah\u0101n\u012b, thence 5 to Kh\u0101nk\u0101h Shutur, thence 5 to Ganjah city, thence 2 to the city of Shamk\u016br, now in ruins, thence 3 to Y\u016brt-Sh\u0101d\u0101\u1e33-B\u0101n, thence 6 to the Ak\u1e6dav\u0101n river, thence 5 to Y\u0101m, and thence 4 farsakhs to the city of Tiflis.\n\nOn this road to Tiflis, Bard\u0101\u2019 and Ganjah exist, also Shamk\u016br, but for the intermediate stages the MSS. give a variety of readings. Ghark is given as Fark, K\u016bra\u2019, Kir\u1e33, or T\u016brak. Laband\u0101n appears as D\u012bh Shutur\u0101n, or Katr\u0101n;\nand the next stage may be read Darh\u016bk. For J\u016bzb\u012bk we get J\u016bz\u012bnak, Kh\u016brank, or H\u016brish; and the name Sh\u0101d\u0101k is given as Sadmiy\u0101n or S\u0101rikiy\u0101n; finally, Y\u0101m may be read B\u0101m or M\u0101ndam.\n\nRoute XXIII.\u2014B\u0101jarv\u0101n to Tabr\u012bz (L. 199b).\u2014B\u0101jarv\u0101n in 4 farsakhs to Barzand (as aforesaid), thence 6 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d-i-Ayv\u0101n built by the Vaz\u012br Khw\u0101jah T\u0101j-ad-D\u012bn \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h Tabr\u012bz\u012b, thence 8 to the village of Bahlat\u0101n (Baylak\u0101n, D\u012bh Sult\u0101n, or Sahlak\u0101n) known as the village of the S\u0101hib Div\u0101n, thence in 8 farsakhs passing the Rub\u0101\u1e6d (Guardhouse) built by the Vaz\u012br \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h aforesaid standing in the valley called Darrah Far\u016bj\u0101y to the city of Ahar, thence in 6 farsakhs by the Pass of G\u016blchah-Nil (the Blue Lake), in which stand two Guardhouses\u2014one the Rub\u0101\u1e6d built by Khw\u0101jah Sa\u2019d-ad-D\u012bn, the other by Am\u012br Niz\u0101m-ad-D\u012bn Ya\u1e25y\u0101 of S\u0101vah\u2014to the village of Armin\u0101n (or Arminiyy\u0101n), thence passing another Rub\u0101\u1e6d built by the Vaz\u012br \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h aforesaid at the stage of Yald\u016bk (or Bald\u016bk) it is 8 farsakhs to Tabr\u012bz.\n\nThe name of the valley called Far\u016bj\u0101y is in some MSS. given as Kirdj\u0101y or Kar\u016bj\u0101y; G\u016blchah Nil appears as K\u016bkjay or Kavilah Nil, while Armin\u0101n or Arminiyy\u0101n has the variants Aranmiy\u0101n or Lars\u0101n. Apparently none of these places are marked on our maps, but this route is copied into the Jih\u0101n Num\u0101 (p. 389), and in Appendix III, already quoted in the remarks on Chapter 3, Mustawfi (L. 217g) mentions many of these places when describing the course of the Ahar river.\n\nThe next four Routes, giving the Itineraries from Sul\u1e6d\u0101niyah westward to S\u012bv\u0101s, and from S\u016bmgh\u0101n (already mentioned in Route viii) southward via Isfah\u0101n to Sh\u012br\u0101z, need no comment, for the places mentioned will for the most part be found on the map, and have already been dealt with in Chapters 2, 3, 7, and 12.\n\nRoute XXIV.\u2014Sul\u1e6d\u0101niyah to Tabr\u012bz (L. 199b).\u2014Sul\u1e6d\u0101niyah in 5 farsakhs to Zanj\u0101n, thence 6 to

Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d 7 farsakhs distant away to the right hand, in 5 farsakhs to Rub\u0101t Chamank\u0101n, thence 5 to Maymanah, thence 6 to the beginning of the Simk\u0101n District, thence 6 to the end of this District, thence in 7 farsakhs to K\u0101rz\u012bn by the Pass of Sang-i-Safid (the White Stone), which is one farsakh short of K\u0101rz\u012bn, thence it is 5 farsakhs to L\u0101ghir, thence 6 to the F\u0101ry\u0101b District, thence 6 to the city of Saj, thence 5 to \u0100b-Anb\u0101r-i-Kin\u0101r, thence 5 to Haram, thence in 6 farsakhs by many steep passes to the village of D\u0101r\u016bk, thence 6 to M\u0101h\u0101n, thence in 6 farsakhs by the Pass of Lardak to Huz\u016b on the sea-shore. From here you cross the water in 4 leagues to the city of Kays (on the island of that name). From this island it is 18 farsakhs to the Island of Abark\u0101f\u0101n, thence 7 to the Island of Urm\u016bs, thence in 70 leagues you come to the Island of B\u0101r on the frontier of Sind, and thence it is 80 to Daybul, which lies 2 leagues from the mouth of the Mihr\u0101n (Indus), which is the great river of Sind.\n\nFrom Shir\u0101z to K\u0101rz\u012bn and L\u0101ghar this road may be followed on the map, and the \u2018Pass of Chains\u2019 north of Fir\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d is still so named; but south of this, to Hus\u016b on the coast (given by the Arab geographers as the port for Kays Island and city) the route is found in no other authority, and has not, I believe, been followed by any traveller in modern times. Variants are numerous in the MSS. The name of the city called Saj may be S\u0101h, Haj, or D\u0101h, with many other combinations of the diacritical points as Khabakh and \u1e24anaj, etc. Haram appears as Siram or Marmaz. D\u0101r\u016bk may be D\u0101rzak, \u016arak, or D\u0101vrak; finally, M\u0101h\u0101n is given as H\u0101m\u0101n or M\u0101y\u0101n. From Kays\nIsland the sea road to India is that in continuation of Route IV already given, and in regard to the names of the islands in the Persian Gulf these have all been discussed in Chapter 12.\n\nRoute XXIX.\u2014Shiraz to Kazirun (L. 200z).\u2014Shiraz in 5 farsakhs to the Wall of Hajji Kawwam, thence 8 to Dasht Arzin, thence 6 to the Rubat (Guardhouse) at the head of the Malan Pass, which is very steep, thence by the Hushang Pass, also very steep, in 3 farsakhs to Kazirun.\n\nThe two passes named before Kazirun are those now known as the K\u016btal-i-P\u012br-i-Zan and the K\u016btal-i-Dukhtar\u2014the Passes of the Old Woman and of the Maiden: for the other places see Chapter 12.\n\nRoute XXX.\u2014Shiraz to Hurmuz (L. 200z).\u2014Shiraz in 12 farsakhs to Sarvistan, thence 8 to the city of Fasa, thence 6 to Timaristan village, thence 8 to Darakan (or Zarkan), from which, turning to the left in 4 farsakhs, you reach the city of Ig, the capital of Shabankarah. To the right from Darakan it is 10 farsakhs to Darabgird, thence 3 to the village of Khayr, thence 6 to Shabankan, thence 3 to Rustak, and thence 3 farsakhs to Burk (Forg); from here it is 6 farsakhs to Tashk\u016b, thence 6 to Tarum, thence to the frontier of the Lar Province at Janad (or Chin\u0101r) it is 4 farsakhs, thence 8 to Chah Chil, thence 8 to Tusar on the sea-coast, whence by water it is 4 leagues to the Island of Hurmuz.\n\nThe places along the route have been for the most part noticed in Chapters 12 and 13. Tashk\u016b beyond Forg is mentioned by Dupr\u00e9 (Voyages en Perse, ii, 489); the MSS. give Tashl\u016b, D\u0101shl\u016b, Shal\u016b, with many other readings; but Tashk\u016b is doubtless the true version. Tusar, the port on the Persian Gulf, whence the crossing is made to Hurmuz Island, is given as D\u016bsar, Lawhar, and Luvilir in the various MSS. It must occupy, more or less, the position of the harbour named Shahr\u016b by Istakhri (p. 170) and S\u016br\u016b or S\u0101r\u016b by Ibn Hawkal (p. 226), being identical with the later Gombroon, which is written Gumr\u016b by Hajji Khalfah (Jih\u0101n Num\u0101, p. 260); and this last is generally held to have been\na corruption of Gumruk, the Turkish name for 'Customhouse' (from the Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03c1\u03ba\u03af), which came into common use all over the East.\n\nRoute XXXI.\u2014Shiraz to Kirm\u0101n (L. 201f).\u2014Shiraz in 8 farsakhs to D\u0101riy\u0101n, thence 8 to Kharr\u0101mah, thence 4 to Kh\u016blanj\u0101n, thence 6 to Kand (or K\u012bd), thence 6 to Khayrah, thence 5 to Ch\u0101h \u2018Uqbah, thence 8 to Bulang\u0101n, thence 8 to Ch\u0101hik, thence 8 to Ch\u0101hik City, thence 8 to Sar\u016bshak, thence 8 to Shahr-i-B\u0101bak, thence 8 to K\u016bshk Nu\u2019m\u0101n, thence 4 to Ab\u0101n, thence 10 to the city of Sirj\u0101n, from which it is 20 farsakhs to Kirm\u0101n (city).\n\nThis is the road by the southern side of Bakhtig\u0101n Lake to the towns of Little and Great S\u0101hik (or Ch\u0101hik) given by the Arab itineraries. The present ruins at Dih Ch\u0101h and Ch\u0101h Khushk probably represent these places. Great S\u0101hik was a city of some importance in the middle ages, where the road from Persepolis to Kirm\u0101n\u2014along the northern shore of Lake Bakhtig\u0101n by Ab\u0101dah City\u2014joined the route here given coming from Shiraz. For the reading Shahr Ch\u0101hik (Great S\u0101hik of the Arabs) nearly all of the MSS. give Shahr At\u0101beg, which possibly may have been the name of this place in the fourteenth century, though apparently not so given by any other authority.\n\nThe next route needs no commentary; it follows the nomenclature of the Arab geographers, and most of the places named will be found on the map, and have been noticed in Chapter 12.\n\nRoute XXXII.\u2014Shiraz to Yazd (L. 201k).\u2014Shiraz in 5 farsakhs to the village of Zarg\u0101n, thence 3 to the dam called Band-i-Am\u012br on the Kur river, thence 3 to the village of Kin\u0101rah in the districts of Hafraq and Marv Dasht, thence 3 to F\u0101r\u016bk, thence 3 to Kamin, thence 4 to Mashhad-i-M\u0101dar-i-Sulaym\u0101n\u2014'Shrine of the Mother of Solomon,' namely, the Tomb of Cyrus\u2014thence 6 to Rub\u0101\u1e6d Mashk, thence 12 to the city of Abark\u016bh, thence 13 to Dih Sh\u012br (Lion village), thence 6 to Dih Jawz (Nut village), thence 4 to Kal\u2019at-i-Maj\u016bs (Magiau\u2019s Castle), thence in 5 farsakhs to the city of Kathah or Yazd, standing in its J\u016bmah (District, otherwise H\u016bmah).\nRoute XXXIII.\u2014Shiraz to Arraj\u0101n and Bust\u0101nak (L. 201p).\u2014\nShiraz in 5 farsakhs to Juvaym, thence 5 to Khall\u0101r, thence\n5 to Kharr\u0101rah, thence 4 to Kuv\u0101r, which is of the district of\nT\u012br Murd\u0101n, thence 3 to Kark\u0101n, thence 3 to Nawbanj\u0101n,\nthence 4 to Kh\u0101bad\u0101n, thence 6 to Kishish, thence 5 to\nGumbadh Mallagh\u0101n, thence 4 to Chawhah, thence 4 to Jish,\nthence 6 to Furzuk, thence 4 to Arraj\u0101n, and 4 farsakhs on to\nBust\u0101nak, which is the frontier of F\u0101rs and Khuzist\u0101n.\n\nThese stages for the most part are given in the Arab\nitineraries, and in the reverse order this is the route followed\nby Timur when on his march from Shustar to Kal'ah Safid\nand Shiraz, as given in the Zafar N\u0101mah (i, 600). Juvaym\n(marked Goyun on the map) and Khull\u0101r exist, also the\nruins of Nawbanj\u0101n or Nawbandaj\u0101n, which last name the\nMSS. more often give as B\u016bhanj\u0101n or L\u0101hij\u0101n, and in\na variety of other mistaken readings. This Nawbanj\u0101n,\na celebrated city throughout the middle ages, lies some\ntwenty-five miles due north of the ruins of Sh\u0101pur, and was\nclose to the famous valley of Sha'b Bavv\u0101n. Our maps now\nshow another Nawbanj\u0101n, a village about twenty-five miles\ndistant due west of Sh\u0101pur; this place is not mentioned by\nthe medi\u00e6val geographers, and the city of Nawbanj\u0101n or\nNawbandaj\u0101n must not be confounded with this modern\nvillage. Khab\u0101dh\u0101n, or Khw\u0101nd\u0101n, was on the river of\nthat name already mentioned in Chapter 12, and Gumbadh\nMallagh\u0101n is doubtless the modern Du Gumbad\u0101n (Two\nDomes), near which are some extensive ruins. The\nremaining stages to Arraj\u0101n are difficult to identify, and\nthe MSS. give a variety of readings. Kishish appears as\nKish or M\u0101l\u012bsh, Chawhah as \u0160\u0101fah or \u0160\u0101'ighah, Jazrak as\nKhawrak or Marz\u0101k; but the same uncertainty is found\nin the corresponding Arab itineraries of Ibn \u1e24awk\u0101l and\nMu\u1e33addasi, and as none of these names are now found on\nthe map it is impossible to get to any certainty in the matter.\n\nIn conclusion, I have two corrections of some importance\nto add, which have come to hand since the earlier portions of\nthis paper were published. In the April number (p. 240) it,\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1902.\nis stated that \"the Urmiyah Lake appears to have been known to \u1e24amd-Allah under the name of Khanjast,\" and it is added that the spelling of this name is uncertain. Professor P. Horn, of Strassburg, has since written to me that the true reading is Ch\u012bchast (differing from Khanjast only by a variation of the diacritical points), this being a modification of the name given to the Urmiyah Lake in the Avesta where the ancient spelling is Cha\u0113chasta. Hence in the Sh\u0101h N\u0101mah (Turner-Macan, p. 1860, l. 4, and p. 1927, l. 6 from below) Ch\u012bchast should be read for 'Khanjast.'\n\nThe second correction is for the July number (p. 530), in the matter of the true site of Sirj\u0101n, the earlier of the two capitals of the Kirm\u0101n province. In his recent work Ten Thousand Miles in Persia, which is reviewed on another page, Major P. Molesworth Sykes describes (p. 431) the ruins of a fortress and town called Kal\u2018ah-i-Sang, covering a hill-top, which is some 5 miles to the eastward of Sa\u2018\u012bd\u0101b\u0101d on the road to B\u0101ft. These ruins are also known as Kal\u2018ah-i-Bayz\u0101, 'the White Castle,' and appear beyond reasonable doubt to be those of Sirj\u0101n, the fortress of which was destroyed by the orders of Tim\u016br (see J.R.A.S., April, 1901, p. 284). The position of Kal\u2018ah-i-Sang is, it is true, rather more to the westward and further from Kirm\u0101n city than the distances given in the Arab geographers would seem to warrant, but this is probably explicable by the very varying estimate given to the Marhalah, or Day's March, on which we have to rely when, unfortunately, the stages in farsakhs are not given.\nINDEX OF

XXV.\u2014Three Arabic MSS. on the History of the City of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn. By H. F. AMEDROZ.\n\nMayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, like many a Moslem city, was not without its historian, but hitherto he has been a name only\u2014Ibn al-Azraq al-F\u0101riqi\u2014known to us by the quotations from his history in the biographies of Ibn Khallik\u0101n. Now, however, the British Museum has acquired a nearly complete copy of the Ta\u02ber\u012bkh Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, Or. 5,803. Its date of composition is 572 A.H. The MS. is written in a good hand, and was copied probably at Damascus, and in the seventh century of the Hijra. It contains 200 folios of about twenty-two closely written lines a side: the first eight folios, to 17 A.H., are wanting; a gap, covering the years 567\u20139, follows folio 194, and the years 571\u20132 are wanting at the end.\n\nAnd recently the Museum has acquired a fragment of an earlier version of the same history\u2014Or. 6,310\u2014composed, as appears from a passage on folio 94b, in 560 A.H. Its form is more concise, owing to the absence of much of the non-local matter of the later version, and its contents correspond with the latter half of that version, and do not cover the first two and a half centuries of the Hijra. It may be that this period, during which Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn had no history of its own apart from that of the Caliphate, was therein dealt with briefly.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 This MS. is in a more formal hand than Or. 5,803; it contains 138 folios of ten short lines a side; it commences at 255 A.H. (fol. 103a of Or. 5,803), proceeds through 130 folios to 543 A.H., when there occurs a gap of a year (fols. 173\u20134 of Or. 5,803), and then extends to 548 A.H. (fol. 178a of Or. 5,803). There is also a gap at fol. 25b, line 3, which is covered by the matter on fols. 121\u2013125 of Or. 5,803, being the period between the revolt at Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn against the Dailamite garrison of \u0160ams\u0101m al-Daula the Buwaihid and the seizure of \u0100mid by Ibn Damnah early in the reign of Mumahhid al-Daula the\nSome details of Ibn al-Azraq's career may be gathered from his history, but beyond the fact that he was the grandson of 'Ali, his name had to be sought elsewhere. Fortunately Professor D. S. Margoliouth drew my attention to a citation from the Bodleian MS., Marsh 333, in the \"Life and Letters of Abu'l-'Al\u0101,\" Oxford, 1900, relating to the bequest of a library to Mayyafariqin. This bequest was mentioned also in Or. 5,803 (fol. 135a) and Marsh 333, which is a geographical and historical description of Mesopotamia (Bodl. Cat., i, No. 945), proved to contain copious quotations from Ibn al-Azraq's history, and to give its author's full name as Al\u1e25mad b. Y\u016bsuf b. 'Ali. 'Ali b. al-Azraq, the grandfather, is mentioned (fol. 149a) as holding the office of Na\u1e93ir of \u1e24u\u1e63n Kayf\u0101 at the taking of Mayyafariqin by Ibn Jah\u012br in 478 A.H., when he was party to a pious fraud through which the late Marw\u0101nid Vizier, Ibn al-Anb\u0101r\u012b, was saved from death at the hands of Marw\u0101nid. And the contents from fol. 88b, line 5, to fol. 90b, line 6, are out of place, and should follow on fol. 92a, line 9, owing, no doubt, to the copyist's original having been out of order. Being generally unpointed, this MS. forms a useful exercise in reading, with Or. 5,803 as a key.\n\n1 The name Abu Mu\u1e25ammad given to Ibn al-Azraq by W\u00fcstenfeld, (Gesch. No. 256) is erroneous. The person referred to is a Z\u0101hid and miracle-worker. (See the passage cited, Abu'l-Fida, iii, 624.)\n\n2 The authorship of Marsh 333 is not settled (see Nicoll's note, Bodl. Cat., ii, p. 602), but the manuscript may now, I think, be safely regarded as the second volume of al-\u0100'laq al-Khatira f\u012b Dhikr Umara al-Sham wa-l-Jazira, by the Katib 'Izz al-D\u012bn Ibn Shadd\u0101d al-Hal\u0101l (Brockelmann, Gesch., i, p. 482), for on fol. 36b of the MS. the author mentions as his work the Sirat al-Sultan al-Malek al-Z\u0101hir, i.e. Baibars, and of this work 'Izz al-D\u012bn was the author. (See H\u0101ji Khal\u012bfa, No. 7,330, and also \u1e62af\u0101di, List of Authorities to his Wa\u1e6df bil-Wafay\u0101t, Vienna, No. 1,163, i, 18b.) The MS. would, indeed, have been identified as the above work by Nicoll, but for the error of H\u0101ji Khal\u012bfa (No. 935) in attributing al-\u0100'laq to Baha al-D\u012bn Ibn Shadd\u0101d, who died in 632 A.H. (Brockelmann, Gesch., i, p. 316), whilst the author of Marsh 333 was writing in 679 A.H. H\u0101ji Khal\u012bfa does, in fact, attribute al-\u0100'laq to 'Izz al-D\u012bn, but under the name of al-Durrat al-Khatira (No. 4,934). Further, the H\u0101fi\u1e93 Zain al-D\u012bn, who is suggested by Nicoll as a possible author of the MS., is mentioned therein as an actor in the narrative. It is noticeable that Ibn Shadd\u0101d's account of B\u0101d the Kurd, the founder of the Marw\u0101nid line (fol. 79b), is given on the authority of Ibn al-Ath\u012br (ix, 125) on the ground that he is not mentioned by Ibn al-Azraq. This is untrue for Or. 5,803 (see fol. 121a), but is true of the other MS. as it stands, owing to the gap in the text at fol. 25b, and there are many indications that the version used by Ibn Shadd\u0101d must have been more akin to this one than to Or. 5,803. More about the Bodleian MS. follows infra. I am indebted to the Librarian of the Bodleian, Mr. E. W. Nicholson, for the advantage of having been able to compare it with the History of Ibn al-Azraq.\nof Ibn Jah\u012br, by whom he was credited with a too accurate knowledge of the amount of Marw\u0101nid treasure which had been got in.\n\n\u2018Ali is again mentioned (fol. 150a\u2013b) as one of a deputation of inhabitants sent to the Sultan\u2019s court in 481 to procure the removal of the Governor, Abu \u2018Ali al-Balkh\u012b, who had succeeded Ibn Jah\u012br. In 482, under Ibn Jah\u012br\u2019s son, \u2018Am\u012bd al-Daula, the new Governor, he is mentioned (fol. 151a) as N\u0101z\u012br and Governor of Arzan, and in the earlier version (fol. 76b) he is included among the leading persons of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn who accompanied \u2018Am\u012bd al-Daula on his departure to Baghd\u0101d late in 484 by way of Ispah\u0101n, when they were admitted to the Caliph\u2019s palace and treated with much honour.\n\nHis grandson, the historian, was born at Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn in 510 A.H. (fol. 160a). His first public mission was to M\u0101rid\u012bn in 529 (fol. 167b), and during the next twenty years he repeatedly records his presence in various cities of Mesopotamia and Syria. In 536 he was at \u0100mid with his father (fol. 170a); in 542 at Mu\u2019dan, buying copper for an issue of coinage by the Ortoqid \u1e24us\u0101m al-D\u012bn (fol. 172b); in 544 at Mosul, selling iron on behalf of this sovereign, when he was present on the Maid\u0101n at the meeting between the At\u0101bek Q\u016b\u1e6db al-D\u012bn Maud\u016bd and the Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Shahraz\u016br\u012b on his release from prison (fol. 174b)\u2014see his life in Ibn Khallik\u0101n (Sl. Eng., ii, 646), whose account of the meeting seems to be taken from this history\u2014and when he had from Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn particulars of the killing of Zangi at the siege of Qal\u2019at Ja\u2019bar in 541, and how its commander\u2019s confident trust in succour from Allah was justified (see Ibn al-Ath\u012br, xi, 81, and his History of the At\u0101beks of Mosul, \u201cRecueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Orientaux,\u201d vol. ii, pt. 2, p. 131).\n\nHe was in the camp of \u1e24us\u0101m al-D\u012bn late in the year when he received the surrender of D\u0101r\u0101 (fol. 174b), his absence from Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn being due to his holding the office of Mutawalli Ashraf al-Waqf, i.e. superintendent of charitable property, outside its territory (fol. 174a).\nBaghdad he visited three times. First, in 534 (fol. 169a-b), when he stayed six months, and studied under various teachers, whom he enumerates. He relates how he saw the Caliph Muqtafi receive the homage of the Khw\u0101ja \u2018Izz al-Malk\u00b9; and how he was present at the B\u0101b al-Hujra on the arrival of the Sultan Mas\u2018\u016bd\u2019s sister,\u00b2 and also at the marriage of the Sultan with the Caliph\u2019s daughter, when the Vizier Sharaf al-D\u012bn \u2018Ali b. \u1e6cir\u0101d al-Zainabi acted as proxy, as he had acted for the Caliph on his marriage. From one prominent official\u2014Abu \u2018Abd Allah Mu\u1e25ammad b. \u2018Abd l-Kar\u012bm al-Anb\u0101r\u012b, who was nephew to the above-mentioned vizier of that name, and was long in the service of the Caliphs from Musta\u1e93hir onwards, in the Diw\u0101n al-Tush\u0101\u00b3, refusing the post of vizier (fol. 153b), until his death in 538 (fol. 186a; Ibn al-Ath\u012br, ix, 196)\u2014he received a full account of the conflict between the Sultan Mas\u2018\u016bd and the Caliphs Mustarshid and R\u0101shid, their deaths, and the accession of the Caliph Muqtafi (fol. 165-6).\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 \u201cAbul-\u2018Izz T\u0101hir b. Mu\u1e25ammad al-Bar\u016bjirdi,\u201d forced on Sultan Mas\u2018\u016bd as vizier by Qar\u0101 Sunqur in 533 in place of Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad b. al-Husain the treasurer (Ibn al-Ath\u012br, xi, 42, sub 532, and al-Bund\u0101r\u012b\u2019s abridgment of Im\u0101d al-D\u012bn al-K\u0101tib al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b, \u201cRecueil de textes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019histoire des Seldjoukides,\u201d by Houtsma, vol. ii, at p. 187, where the treasurer is named Mu\u1e25ammad b. \u2018\u0100li, and he is called, too, al-Man\u0101z\u012b in the Zubdat al-Taw\u0101rikh, B.M. Stowe, Or. 7, 62a).\n\n\u00b2 His father, Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad, had given her mother to his Maml\u016bk Qar\u0101j\u0101 al-S\u0101qi before 508 A.H., when she entered Mayy\u0101f\u0101r\u012bq\u012bn as his wife (fol. 159a; as corrected by earlier version, fol. 99a). Fatima, her daughter, had been espoused to the Caliph three years before (Ibn Khallik\u0101n, Sl. Eng., ii, 234). The Halls (Hujra) were added to the palace by Mustarshid (Y\u0101q\u016bt, i, 144), and in one of these Fatima lived until her death in 542. (See \u201cBaghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate,\u201d Oxford, 1900, by G. Le Strange, p. 273.)\n\n\u00b3 This account accords in substance with that given by Ibn al-Ath\u012br (xi, 14-17, and At\u0101beks, 87-98), but Ibn al-Arraq\u2019s informant, who was an eye-witness of, and actor in, the proceedings, adds many interesting particulars. He relates how Mustarshid started on the campaign against Mas\u2018\u016bd in opposition to the advice both of himself and of the Vizier al-Zainabi, who instanced the fatal move of al-Husain from Mecca to \u2018Ir\u0101q, to all of which the Caliph\u2019s reply was that, if death was inevitable, a coward\u2019s death was a poor one to choose:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0628\u062f \u0641\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0628 \u0625\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u0648\u062a \u062c\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064b\u0627\n\nHe said, too, that the Caliph\u2019s assassination whilst a prisoner in Mas\u2018\u016bd\u2019s camp was by many attributed to Mas\u2018\u016bd, acting perhaps on the advice of his uncle, the Sultan Sinjar; and by some to the instigation of the Marr\u0101d\u012bl Dabars b. Sadaqa, the Caliph\u2019s bitter enemy. That the people of Baghdad believed both Sultans to be guilty is shown by the recollection of Im\u0101d al-D\u012bn al-K\u0101tib al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b,\nHis second visit was in 546 A.H. (fol. 175a), when he arrived in Ramadhan, and, whilst there, attended the classes who was there in 549 A.H. (see al-Bundari, op. cit., p. 178), and the killing of Dubays by Mas'ud is regarded by Ibn Khallikan (SL Eng., i, 506) as a device for laying the deed to his charge. Neither of these theories has the support of Ibn al-Athir. On the contrary, he suggests that Dubays' death was due to Mas'ud having no longer occasion to play him off against the Caliph (vol. xi, p. 19). Al-Anbari went on to say how he, and the other advisers of the late Caliph, were now summoned by Mas'ud from the fortress of Sarjahan, where they had been imprisoned since their defeat\u2014a place which the historian mentions he saw when at al-Rayy in 549 A.H.\u2014and were consulted as to what was to be done about the Caliphate. The Sultan held very Erastian views as to the position of the Caliph towards the Saljuq power. When the vizier said that the office had passed to the designated successor, Rashid, who had received homage on that occasion and again lately, he replied that he would never confirm his appointment. Rashid, he said, meant to revolt, like his father, Mustarshid, who had attacked his brother Mahmud twice and himself once, with the result that, till the end of time, they would have to bear the odium of a Caliph's death, after having restored the dignity to his house\u2014an allusion, no doubt, to the suppression of the revolt of al-Basasiri and the restoration of the Caliph Qaim by his ancestor, Tughril Beg, in 450 (Ibn al-Athir, ix, 445). His wish was to have someone appointed who would not interfere in matters outside the faith, and not put himself at the head of a party hostile to him and his dynasty. An Abbasid of some years should be chosen\u2014there were plenty to select from\u2014a man of sense and judgment, who must bind himself to be duly obedient and to keep at home, and he told them not to leave out of sight Harun (the words are \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u062c\u0648 \u0639\u0646 \u0647\u0631\u0648\u0646, see the same form used with \u0625\u0644\u0649 in the sense of turning the attention to taking another's territory, Ibn al-Athir, viii, 520, l. 19), Harun being a son of the Caliph Muqtadi, for he was an elderly man and would not be inclined to rebellion; he was, moreover, recommended to him by his uncle Sinjar. The historian then enumerates the descendants of Muqtadi, Mustazhir, Mustarshid, and of Rashid, who had over twenty children, the eldest born to him when he was 9 years of age only, and the historian dwells on this instance of precocity and cites other cases (fol. 166a). Then, resuming the narrative, he tells us that Mas'ud, whilst recommending Harun, added that, in pursuance of the advice of his uncle Sinjar, a guarantee for the behaviour of the person appointed would be required from the vizier, the treasurer, and Ibn al-Anbari, whereupon the vizier said that, having regard to this liability, it was for them to select, and that their choice fell on the most fit of them all, namely, Mustazhir's son, Abu 'Abd Allah, for whose acts they would go surely. (He was, in fact, the vizier's son-in-law, having married his daughter when his father was Caliph and hers Chief Naqib.) The Sultan assented, and advised secrecy, lest the nominee should be murdered in Baghdad. Later they proceeded there with Mas'ud. Then follows (fol. 166b) an account of the doings of Rashid, and his offer to Zangi to procure the Sultanate for Alp Arslan, son of Mas'ud's brother Mahmud, and then under Zangi's charge, and that Zangi should be Atabek (guardian) to both Sultan and Caliph. Zangi advanced to Baghdad, but had to retire before Mas'ud, and Rashid, seeing that his fall was inevitable, assembled all the members of the house of Abbas in an underground chamber, which he ordered should be closed. And the historian was told by a chamberlain that Rashid had handed him a sword, saying he was to help him in killing them all, and so leave no one eligible for the Caliphate, as the enemy might substitute one of them for himself; and that he then ordered the chamber to be opened. Just then came the news of Zangi's flight to Mosul after pillaging the Harim of Tahir, and the Sultan's arrival at Nahrawan, whereupon they both threw\nof the Preacher Qutb al-Din al-'Abadi; he also saw the Sultan Mas'ud on his coming to pass the winter there, \"and away their swords, and, seizing some valuables, started off with the Chief Qadi al-Zainabi, and the lately appointed vizier Ibn Sadaga, to join Zangi at Mosul.\n\n[Ibn al-Athir attributes the pillage to the criminal class, and Zangi's withdrawal, not flight, to discord among the allies and to the irresolution (\u062a\u062b\u0627\u0621\u0628) of the Caliph (Atabeks), p. 94]. He is always favourable to the Mosul dynasty.]\n\nAl-Anbari went on to say that on reaching Baghdad in 530 A.H. he and the rest gave the required guarantee, and afterwards waited on Abu 'Abd Allah, when the Vizier stipulated that he should abide by the conditions imposed, and informed him that they had already guaranteed this. (It appears from al-Bundari, op. cit., p. 235, and from the Zubdat al-Tawarikh, 71b, that one condition was not to keep any Turkish mamuks, which the Caliph evaded by hiring Armenians and Greeks. Ibn al-Athir records that a similar condition was submitted to by Rashid, vol. xi, p. 62.) Abu 'Abd Allah assented, and they informed the Sultan, who fixed the day following for the ceremony of homage. On that day (fol. 167a) they first removed from the palace various instruments of music and other improper objects, and then took the evidence of its inmates that Rashid was given to fermented beverage, whereupon his deposition was pronounced by Abu Tahir Ahmad b. al-Karkhi, the Chief Qadi of the Shafeite sect (in the absence of al-Zainabi at Mosul, Ibn al-Athir, xi, p. 27). Next they presented the new Caliph with a list of titles, which included 'Muqtafi,' 'Mustadi,' and 'Mustajir' \u2014 in the earlier version (115a) 'Mustajir.' He left the choice to them (Ibn al-Athir, xi, p. 28, attributes the choice to a dream), and al-Anbari, being asked for his opinion, chose Muqtafi. The Caliph said, \"May it be blessed,\" whereupon the Vizier and the rest of them kissed the Caliph's hand and did homage in these terms:\n\n\u0628\u0627\u064a\u0639\u062a \u0633\u064a\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062a\u0641\u064a \u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062e\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0647\n\nwhilst al-Anbari substituted, after the titles, the words\u2014\n\n\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0639\u062a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0628\u0627\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u062e\u064a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0647\n\nfor he had done homage to Mustajir as Wakil al-Dar in 490 and to Mustarshid when in the Diwan al-Insha' in 507, and also to Rashid, presumably on his designation as successor.

Having recorded the occupation of Tifl\u012bs by David in 515, after his defeat of the Ortoqid Najm al-D\u012bn \u012al Gh\u0101z\u012b and his Moslem allies outside that city, and that many of the prisoners were still in captivity, he says (fol. 161b) that he saw the field of battle when he went to Tifl\u012bs in 548 to the Court of Demetrius; that he accompanied the King in a journey of over seventy days through his kingdom, passing by Abl\u0101n and Darband to the province of Abkh\u0101z; that there they came to a fortress in which the King told him was a prisoner of \u012al Gh\u0101z\u012b's force, 'a Must'arab,' and that he ought next day to visit him and ask him whence he came; that he was prepared to do this, but at night came tidings of disturbances which compelled their sudden departure, and so prevented his seeing the captive. On fol. 162a he records the regulations respecting the Moslem inhabitants of Tifl\u012bs, which he describes as eminently favourable to them, and that in 548 they were still in force. Further, that he had seen King Demetrius, when on a visit to Tifl\u012bs, attend at the Mosque on a Friday and take his seat on a raised bench (\\(\u0661\u0662\u0665\\)) opposite the Kha\u1e6d\u012bb, and listen to his address, and that on leaving he gave 200 dinars for the benefit of the Mosque; and that his conduct towards men of learning and piety was both honourable and liberal; in fact, he had seen Moslems treated by him\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This passage is quoted by Ibn Khallik\u0101n in his life of Mas\u02bf\u016bd (Sl. Eng., iii. 357).\n\n\\(^2\\) Imprisoned by order of the Caliph Mans\u016br in Mecca in 158 A.H. with members of the Al\u012bde family; died in 161 (Ibn al-Ath\u012br, vi, 23 and 38).\nwith a respect that they would not have met with even in Baghd\u0101d itself. It was on this journey that he heard of the death of \u1e2a Gh\u0101zi, in Dhu'l-Qa'da, 548, for he says (fol. 176b) that when near Darband, in Muharram, 549, the King sent for him and told him his master was dead, and that the news had just reached him. On his return by way of Greek territory (fol. 180a) Ibn al-Azraq resisted an attempt by N\u012b\u1e93\u0101m al-D\u012bn Y\u0101gh\u012b Siy\u0101n b. Dushmand to\n\n1 After the city had been taken by assault and pillaged for three days David promised the inhabitants protection and fair treatment. He remitted various taxes during that year; at the request of the Moslems he provided that no swine should be allowed to be slaughtered in their quarter of the city; he issued coin bearing on one side the names of the Caliph and Sultan, and on the other the names of Allah and of the Prophet, with his own name on the border (and some of these coins are in existence, see \"Suites Mon\u00e9taires de la G\u00e9orgie,\" V. Langlois, p. 45; Paris, 1870); he made proclamation that he would refuse to protect anyone injuring a Moslem; that these should have the right of calling to prayer, and of praying and reading openly, and of pronouncing the Khutba from the pulpit on Friday for the Caliph and the Sultan, but for these only; that no Georgian, Armenian, or Jew should enter the baths of Ism\u0101'il at Tiflis; and he fixed the yearly payment due to himself, 2,000 dinars, for Georgians at five, for Jews at four, and for Moslems at three dinars (fol. 162a). This statement by a Moslem historian is strong evidence of David's toleration. Moslem practice was otherwise. 'Am\u012bd al-Mulk, governor of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn in 580, hearing the call to prayer (\u0646\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0633) sounding from a Nestorian monastery on a hill near, exclaimed, \"This is sounded on Moslem hill-tops, whilst we need authorization (\u0627\u0646\u062d\u0646\u0649) at Constantinople!\" and being told the edifice was once a mosque, he had it reconverted (fol. 150a, earlier version 74a). Both these episodes are told by Sib\u1e6d ibn al-Jauzi in the Mir'\u0101t al-Zam\u0101n (Paris, 1506, 306a and 202b), and are doubtless taken from this history, and the former is given also by al-'Aini (Brock., ii, 52) in his history; Petersb. As. Mus. Rosen, 177 (see Brosset's Hist. G\u00e9orgie, vol. i, Add. 240\u20131). Ibn al-\u0100th\u012br (x, 399) mentions only the pillage, not the toleration. In his account of the recapture of Tiflis by the Moslems under Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn Khw\u0101rizm Sh\u0101h in 623 (xii, 293\u20136) he draws attention to the strength of the Georgians in holding the city so long against all Moslem attacks.\n\n2 I.e. of the D\u0101nishmand family. See Lane-Poole's \"Mohammedan Dynasties,\" p. 156. Both forms of the name occur in the MS., fols. 186a, 197a, and 200a. In the list of this dynasty given in Jann\u0101bi's History (Bodl., Pocock 177 and Laud 238) this Y\u0101gh\u012b Siy\u0101n appears as the third ruler, being son to Muhammad al-Gh\u0101zi, whom he succeeded in 537. He died in 562. He is mentioned again in the MS. under 570 A.H. (fol. 200a) as having been at some date deprived of his territory by the Sultan (of R\u016bm).\nretain him in his service, and went on to Akhl\u0101t, and thence to al-Rayy by way of Arjish, Barkari, N\u016bshahr, Qa\u1e6dwar, Khuwayyi, Marand, Tabr\u012bz, Zarakn\u0101n, and the river. At al-Rayy he visited the tomb of Chosroes, and of Mu\u1e25ammad b. al-\u1e24asan, the pupil of Abu \u1e24anifa,\u00b9 and then retraced his steps to Akhl\u0101t.\u00b2 In 549 (fol. 181a) he was again in Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn.\n\nIn 558 he was at Akhl\u0101t (fol. 186a), when the news arrived of the defeat of the Georgian king by a coalition of Moslem rulers, viz., Sh\u0101h Arman, the Salj\u016bq Arsl\u0101n Sh\u0101h of \u2018Ir\u0101q, Shams al-D\u012bn \u012aldigiz of Adharbij\u0101n, and Fakhr al-D\u012bn of Arzan. He says that the king fled to some densely wooded ground, three days off, a spot known to him from his visit in 549, and he describes the rejoicings at Akhl\u0101t, when 300 oxen were slaughtered and distributed among the needy.\n\nIn 562 (fol. 190b) he records his appointment as superintendent of charitable property at Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, and in 563 (fol. 191b), having journeyed to Damascus by way of Ruh\u0101, Manbij, \u1e24alab, \u1e24ims, and \u1e24am\u0101h (and the journey lasted from the middle of Sha'ab\u0101n to the 17th Ramadhan), the Chief Q\u0101\u1e0di, Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Shahraz\u016bri, appointed him N\u0101\u1e93ir of charitable property there. He was at Damascus at the time of the severe earthquake in 565, which, he says, was fatal to only one person there (fol. 193a), and in Rab\u012b\u2018 II, 566 (fol. 194a), he witnessed the starting of a remarkable caravan for Egypt, in which travelled Saladin's brother, Shams al-Daula (T\u016br\u0101n Sh\u0101h), with his children and nephews and their families and dependants, and which consisted, it was said, of over 70,000 camels, with as many as eight persons on a camel\u2014three women and five small children. It arrived in safety and was met by Saladin.\u00b3\n\nOn the 13th Jum\u0101da I in the same year (fol. 194b) he\n\n\u00b9 His life is given by Ibn Khallik\u0101n, Sl. Eng., ii, 590.\n\u00b2 For this route see Istakhri, p. 194.\n\u00b3 The departure is mentioned by Ibn al-Ath\u012br (see At\u0101beks, p. 258, and Ibn Khallik\u0101n, Sl. Eng., iv, 497).\nstarted homewards, and retracing his steps to Manbij, reached Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, through Harr\u0101n, Ra\u2019s al-\u2018Ain, and M\u0101rid\u012bn, in the middle of Jum\u0101da II. In 570 (fol. 198b) he is journeying by \u0100mid, to \u1e24am\u0101h, on to \u1e24\u0101ni, and thence home by the Monastery of the Cross.\n\nAnd in 571 (fol. 200a), after another successful campaign against the Georgians, he was at Akhl\u0101t when the remains of a deceased vizier of Sh\u0101h Arman arrived there, and witnessed the grief and mourning of the ruler and people. How long he lived after 572 is uncertain, as I have been unable to find any biographical notice of him. From his constant journeys it would appear that, like his grandfather, he was connected with state business\u2014in two instances he says so\u2014and various passages in his history indicate that he was interested in public works; on bridges, for instance, he has much to say, and seems to look at them with a practised eye.\u00b9\n\nIbn al-Azraq says (fol. 7a) that his history had originated in a perusal of the Kit\u0101b Baghd\u0101d, with its description of the building of that city by al-Man\u1e63\u016br, and of the Kit\u0101b al-Mausil, composed by al-Shimsh\u0101\u1e6di for the Oqailid Qirw\u0101sh, and extending to about 440 A.H. Of this last work and of\n\n\u00b9 He mentions that a bridge at Aqr\u0101m\u0101n, over the S\u0101tidam\u0101 river, gave way in 539 (fol. 171a); that an attempt to rebuild it in 541 failed owing to the foundations being undermined by a flood; that the person charged with the work was saddled with the cost; and that his successor did his work excellently, the bridge being completed in 548 (fol. 171b). He states its height as over sixty cubits \u201cbi\u2019l-Najj\u0101r\u201d (i.e. one larger by a sixth than the ordinary cubit; see Ibn Haugal, 112 (c), and Gloss Geogr. sub \u201cNajar\u201d). He says, too, that it was the first bridge to be built in Diyar Bakr; and proceeds to instance other bridges of later date (fol. 179b), one of these being that over the Y\u0101r\u0101r river between Fanak and Jaz\u012brat ibn \u2018Omar, built by Jam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-I\u1e63bah\u0101n\u012b, the vizier at Mosul, who contemplated another over the Tigris at B\u0101fata below Jaz\u012bra, but did not live to complete it (ib. and 185b). On fol. 195b he records, too, that in 570 Banafshah, a slave girl belonging to the Caliph, made a second bridge of boats (Jisr) over the Tigris for which the chain, which cost 1,500 dinars, was procured from \u1e24\u0101ni (where there were iron-mines, Yaq\u016bt, ii, 188); that it was moored below the T\u0101j palace, the old bridge being removed to near the entrance of Darb Zakhi near the college of Muwaffaq; and that the new bridge proved of great use. (The building by Banafshah of a bridge near the Sh\u016bnizayya quarter, probably the \u2018Thorn bridge,\u2019 is mentioned in \u201cBaghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate,\u201d by G. Le Strange, p. 79, on the authority of the Ta\u2019r\u012bkh-i-Guzidah of \u1e24amd-Allah. Perhaps the bridge was misdescribed by \u1e24amd-Allah.)\nits author nothing is known,\u00b9 but the Kit\u0101b Baghd\u0101d is the well-known work by Ibn abi \u1e6c\u0101hir Taif\u016br, the prototype of all subsequent histories of Baghd\u0101d. (See Brockelmann, Gesch., i, p. 138.)\u00b2 The earlier version of Ibn al-Azraq\u2019s history (Or. 6,310) is smaller in compass than Or. 5,803, not so much owing to greater conciseness as to the absence of the matter added to the later version. The scope of the history is rather local than general, and, apart from the proof afforded by the existence of the earlier version, it would have been apparent that much of the non-local matter in Or. 5,803, at least in its latter half, which alone I have fully read, was an addition to an existing work. This foreign matter, down to the fall of the Marw\u0101nid dynasty in 478 A.H., consists in the main of scraps of Baghd\u0101d history with some notices of the Fatimide rulers, inserted, at times, in the middle of an episode, or out of order of date, or twice over, and under different dates. And many of the dates are at variance with those given in other histories. Later, from the time of Zangi onwards, when the centre of politics had shifted to Mosul and Damascus, when M\u0101ridin and not Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn was the residence of the ruling dynasty, and when Ibn al-Azraq was himself a spectator of events, his history broadens somewhat, and is made up of unconnected notices of events occurring in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. To its close the\n\n\u00b9 This author must not be confused with \u2018Ali b. Muhammad al-Shimsh\u0101\u1e6di, a poet at the Court of Saif al-Daula; see fol. 113b of this MS., Y\u0101q\u016bt, iii, 320, and Ibn Khallik\u0101n (Sl. Eng., ii, 335). Dhahab\u012b (Or. 48, 2b) quotes a History by \u2018Ali b. Muhammad al-Shimsh\u0101\u1e6di for warfare between Saif al-Daula and the Greeks in 351 A.H.\n\n\u00b2 I have found but one subsequent reference in the MS. to the Kit\u0101b Baghd\u0101d\u2014at fol. 95a, where it is quoted as fixing the death of the Im\u0101m M\u0101lik in 199 A.H. at the age of 85 years. Ibn al-Azraq there says that he had already given the date otherwise and as he then believed it to be, and that he now gave this different date. And he had in fact stated (fol. 92a\u2013b) that the Im\u0101m died in 179 A.H., aged 84 years, or, according to al-W\u0101qid\u012b, aged 90 years. Ibn Khallik\u0101n\u2019s life of the Im\u0101m (Sl. Eng., ii, p. 547) contains a similar statement. Ibn al-Azraq was evidently struck by the discrepancy between the two dates. That given by Ibn Taif\u016br unfortunately does not fall within the period covered by the fragment of his work (B.M. Add. 23,318) relating to the reign of Ma\u2019m\u016bn, which begins at 204 A.H. Ibn al-Azraq relates the foundation of Baghd\u0101d at fol. 89, but does not quote the Kit\u0101b Baghd\u0101d.\nwork continues to be rather a patchwork than a tissue of history.\n\nIn the course of the opening narrative of the Moslem conquest of the country is inserted an account of the founding of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn (fol. 7b et seq.), taken from a 'Tash\u012btha' in the Melkite Church there, which a Christian translated for the author from the Syriac into Arabic. And Y\u0101q\u016bt, writing just half a century after Ibn al-Azraq, gives the same account in a more concise form in the Mu'jam al-Buld\u0101n, ed. W\u00fcst., iv, 703. The narrative proceeds under headings of successive Caliphs until, on fol. 110a, comes an account of the rise of the Hamd\u0101nids, and in particular of Saif al-Daula, who held Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, with notices of his campaigns, of his Court, of the names of the literary men who frequented it (fol. 113b), of his death, and of his\n\n1 Some of the variants in the two texts are noticeable.

Brosset, vol. i, 248 and 263; St. Petersburg, 1874). The title 'Marzpan' (Marzub\u0101n) of Armenia occurs, ib. 210. The Ba\u1e6driq al-Ba\u1e6d\u0101riqa is probably the 'Ishkh\u0101n' or central king. The Sun\u0101suna, who are mentioned elsewhere in the MS. as hostile neighbours, were an Armenian tribe (Ibn al-Ath\u012br, ix, 306). For 'al-Ta\u012btaw\u0101na,' see Y\u0101q\u016bt, iii, 570, and for 'Barkar,' I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri, 194. The latter is marked as 'Pergri' on Kiepert's map of Turkey in Asia, and as situate on the stream at the north-east corner of Lake Van, with Arjish, Dh\u0101t al-Jauz, and Akhl\u0101t lying along the north shore in succession westwards, Dh\u0101t al-Jauz being \"Ardzge or '\u0100deldjw\u0101z,\" and on fol. 160a it occurs again as \u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0646. I am informed by Mr. A. G. Ellis that the word should more properly be 'Artek\u0113,' the Armenian having probably been transliterated according to Constantinople pronunciation; further, that\n'Adud al-Daula, with a notice of his literary Court, which included al-'Utbi, the author of the Kit\u0101b Yam\u012bn\u012b (fol. 120a). And then an account of how in 372, on the death of 'Adud al-Daula, B\u0101d the Kurd succeeded in establishing himself in Diyar Bakr as an independent ruler, where he was followed in succession by his three nephews, the children of his brother-in-law Marw\u0101n, with Mayyaf\u0101riq\u012bn as their capital. Their dynasty\u2014the Marw\u0101nid\u2014with that of their successors, the Ortoqids of M\u0101rid\u012bn, under whom Ibn al-Azraq lived, occupy the remainder of the MS. Of these I hope to give some account on a future occasion.\n\nIbn al-Azraq's quotations from other histories by name are few, and from the time of the Marw\u0101nid rulers onwards no historian is cited. In the earlier half of the MS., so far as I have perused it, I have found quotations from the following authors:\n\nAl-W\u0101qid\u012b, Brockelmann, Gesch., i, p. 135, on fol. 92b; Ibn Qutaiba, Kit\u0101b al-Ma\u02bf\u0101rif, ib., p. 120, on fols. 88b, 90a, and 94b; al-Bil\u0101dh\u016br\u012b, Kit\u0101b al-Buld\u0101n, ib., p. 141, on fol. 2a; Ibn Taif\u016br, Kit\u0101b Baghd\u0101d, ib., p. 138, on fol. 95a; Al-Dinaw\u0101r\u012b, al-Akhbar al-Tiwal, ib., p. 123, on fol. 12b; Al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b, Kit\u0101b al-Aur\u0101q, ib., p. 143, on fol. 100a; and Hil\u0101l al-\u1e62\u0101b\u012b, Ta\u02ber\u012bkh, ib., p. 323, on fol. 123a. And on fol. 108a an unknown historian, Ibn Shajara, is quoted for a strange gift to the Caliph Muqtadir, in 306 A.H., of the upper half of a huge fish's head, which was said to have remained in the palace until it was pillaged by al-Bas\u0101s\u012br\u012b (in 450 A.H.; Ibn al-Ath\u012br, ix, 442). The text is as follows:\n\n\u0648\u0642\u064a\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0634\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u0647 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0647\u062f\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062a\u062f\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0633\u062a \u0648\u062b\u0644\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0646\u0635\u0641 \u0631\u0623\u0633 \u0633\u0645\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0643\u0629\n\nLucas Injijian, in his Universal Geography, Venice, 1806, vol. i (Armenia) of the first part of the work (Asia), at p. 165 gives the modern name of the place as 'Aljavaz' or 'Atiljewaz.' 'Sibalwark' is the modern Turkish 'S\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9k.' 'Qalb' is included in the list of the towns and fortresses of Diyarbakr, given by Ibn Shadd\u0101d (Bodl., Marsh 333, 65a), which, he says, passed from one ruler to another as if they were pledges or chessmen.\nI have found Ibn al-Azraq\u2019s history quoted or copied by Ibn Khallik\u0101n in the following passages of De Slane\u2019s English translation:\u2014Vol. i, p. 127 (Or. 5,803, fols. 134b\u2013135a), for the bequest by al-Man\u0101zi of his library to two mosques; p. 158 (fols. 140b\u2013141b), p. 506 (fol. 165b), and p. 602 (fol. 183a); vol. ii, p. 111 (fol. 121a), p. 581 (fol. 103b), p. 629 (fol. 182a), and p. 646, without mention of the history, being the above-mentioned passage relating to Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Shahraz\u016br\u012b (fol. 174b); vol. iii, p. 338 (fol. 163b), p. 356 (fol. 175a), and p. 601, where our author\u2019s name is printed by error Ibn Zul\u0101k (fol. 189a).\n\nSib\u1e6d Ibn al-Jauzi, in the Mir\u02be\u0101t al-Zam\u0101n, quotes a History of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn\u2014meaning no doubt that by Ibn al-Azraq\u2014B.M. Or. 4,619, fol. 216b, under 418 A.H., for the placing of a purse of money in the coffin of the Vizier al-Maghribi as a means of identification (see Or. 5,803, fol. 135b), and also (ibid., fol. 217a) for a statement, on the authority of a certain Abu \u1e24aw\u0101r\u012b al-W\u0101siti, that the vizier wished to be buried beneath the feet of al-Husain, a statement which appears neither in Or. 5,803 nor in the earlier version.\n\nAnd again, in the same work (Paris, 1506, fol. 69a), under 453 A.H., he quotes this history for many facts relating to the life of the Marw\u0101nid Na\u1e63r al-Daula; again, on fol. 252b, in connection with the summoning of Qilij Arsl\u0101n b. Sulaim\u0101n in 498 from Mala\u1e6d\u012byyah to rule at Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, for the fact that his father, Sulaim\u0101n b. Qutalmish, had been sent by Malek Sh\u0101h to conquer the former place; on fol. 258a, for the defeat of Qilij Arsl\u0101n in 499 by J\u0101wali Saq\u0101wah, a maml\u016bk of Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad, and his death by drowning (see Or. 5,803, 158a); and on fols. 258a and b, in the notice of Qilij Arsl\u0101n, under 500 A.H., for the statement that Mu\u1e25ammad also despatched J\u0101wali to fight the Franks, and\nordered the local rulers to obey him; that Jakarmish of Mosul refused to do so, was defeated by J\u0101wali, and died of his wounds; that Qilij Arsl\u0101n then occupied Mosul, but was also attacked by J\u0101wali and drowned; and that his infant son was sent to the Sultan Mas\u02bf\u016bd, and became the ancestor of the Salj\u016bq line of R\u016bm. (This passage is not to be found in Or. 5,803; the events are told by Ibn al-Ath\u012br, x, 291 et seq.) Again, on fol. 306b, the passage relating to the earthquake at Janzah in 510 A.H. is taken verbatim from Or. 5,803, 162a\u2013b, viz., that the town was attacked and pillaged by David (the Restorer), the captives being so numerous that they were conveyed to Tiflis in waggons. Moslems were brought in there in flocks, and most of them were bought and released by the inhabitants\u2014presumably the Moslem section\u2014many of whom told the author (i.e. Ibn al-Azraq, on his visit in 548) that they became impoverished in that year.\n\nLastly, the author of the MS. Bodl. Marsh 333 drew from the history of Ibn al-Azraq about one-fourth of its contents. Of that MS. the probable author, as above stated, was \u02bfIzz al-D\u012bn Ibn Shadd\u0101d.\n\nIt remains to give some account of this author and of his works. Dhahabi, in the Ta\u02ber\u012bkh al-Isl\u0101m, B.M. Or. 1,540, sub 684 A.H., has a notice of his death, as follows:\u2014\u201cThe K\u0101tib \u02bfIzz al-D\u012bn Abu \u02bfAbd Allah Mu\u1e25ammad b. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm b. \u02bfAli b. Shadd\u0101d al-An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b of Halab, born there in 613 A.H., was a man of great culture and intelligence. He was the author of a History of \u1e24alab, and of a life of the Sultan al-Malik al-Z\u0101hir al-\u1e62alih\u012b (i.e. Baibars). He had been in close attendance on the Sultan al-Malik al-N\u0101\u1e63ir Y\u016bsuf (i.e. the Ayyubid ruler at \u1e24alab, 634\u2013658 A.H.), and had gone on missions from him to H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b and others. Later, after the fall of \u1e24alab, he settled in Egypt, and acquired position and respect at the Court of al-Malik al-Z\u0101hir and al-Malik al-Man\u1e63\u016br (i.e. Qal\u0101un, 678\u2013689, whose reign followed on those of the two sons of Baibars). He possessed\na courtier's ingratiating qualities, and was alert in rendering service to people. To some extent he imparted traditions, and some persons in Egypt derived them from him. He died in \u1e62afar, and was buried at the foot of Muqat\u1e6dam (sic). He was offered the post of vizier under al-Malik al-Sadid (probably al-Sa\u02bf\u012bd Baraka Kh\u0101n, Baibars' son and successor, ruled 676\u20138 A.H.), but he declined it. His monthly stipend was a thousand dirhams. He led an honoured and easy life.\"\n\nThis account accords very closely, as will be seen, with what the author of Marsh 333 says therein of himself.\n\nThe \"History of \u1e24alab\" is doubtless the first volume of al-A\u02bfl\u0101q al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bra, composed not earlier than 678, which comprises \u1e24alab and the adjacent district. Of this the British Museum possesses an incomplete copy of the seventeenth century, Cat. No. 1,323, and a fragment of the same, ib., No. 282 (2). There is, too, a copy at St. Petersburg\u2014Asiatic Museum, 162. The British Museum possesses also a fine MS. of the third volume of the work\u2014Cat. No. 1,324\u2014comprising Damascus and Eastern Syria, which dates from the time of composition,\u00b9 but which is imperfect, and so greatly damaged by water as to be largely illegible.\n\nThe MS. Bodl. Marsh 333 is a fine fourteenth-century copy. It was composed in 679 A.H., and copied in 789 A.H. by Sulaim\u0101n b. Gh\u0101zi b. Mu\u1e25ammad al-\u012aw\u0101ni; and it is both perfect and legible. It comprises the districts of Diyar Modar, Diyar Rab\u012b\u02bfa, and Diyar Bakr. And there must have been yet another portion of the work, on Mosul, for the author says in his preface that he means to treat of it, for although not strictly part of Mesopotamia, yet it was adjacent, and under the Caliphate was included with it under one governor; and later, on fol. 46a, in his account\n\n\u00b9 The date of the composition of both volumes is given in the B.M. Catalogue, No. 1,324, as 674 A.H. But it appears from the former (Add. 23,334, 92a) that it was composed after the accession of Qal\u0101\u016bm, in 678; and as regards the latter volume (Add. 23,335, on fol. 76a) the date 675 appears. As to this volume see concluding Note infra.\nof the town of Sinj\u0101r, he says with reference to the Oqailid Muslim that his story was given in the history of Mosul.\n\nThe other work mentioned by Dhahabi\u2014the Life of Baibars\u2014is referred to in Marsh 333 on fol. 36b, when the author, speaking of B\u012bra as having been since 560 under governors appointed by Baibars, adds that the place underwent three sieges by the Tatars, \"as shall be related in our history, under successive years, of the life of the Sultan al-Malik al-Z\u0101hir, may Allah perpetuate his rule.\"\n\nFurther, the author mentions two other historical works as his. On fol. 40a, in relating how the Ayyubids had called in Khw\u0101rizm Sh\u0101h to expel the At\u0101bek Lu'lu' from Na\u1e63\u012bb\u012bn, he adds that this shall be set out fully \"in our continuation (\u0641\u06cc\u0644) to the history of Ibn al-Ath\u012br.\" And, on fol. 107b, when relating the defeat and death of Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn Mankburni\u00b9 in 628, he says that he will give some account of his doings \"notwithstanding we have gone into this in detail in our work entitled \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0634\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u062e\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a\u064a\u0646,\" the two powers being presumably the Khw\u0101rizm Sh\u0101h and the Ayyubid of \u1e24alab, al-N\u0101\u1e63ir Y\u016bsuf.\n\nAs regards the employment of Ibn Shadd\u0101d by al-N\u0101\u1e63ir Y\u016bsuf, the author of Marsh 333, in his account of Harr\u0101n, tells us (fol. 20b) that in 640 A.H., after the town had passed to that sovereign, he was sent to inspect it; that he found its revenue at that date to amount to one million dirhams, whilst in the time of al-Ashraf (i.e. fifteen years earlier) the amount had been thrice as much; and that it still further declined later under Tatar rule.\n\nAgain, in his account of Jaz\u012brat ibn 'Omar, which, on the death of its At\u0101bek Ma\u1e25m\u016bd in 648, passed to his son Mas\u02bf\u016bd, he says (fol. 62a) that in 649, after the return of al-N\u0101\u1e63ir from defeating the Egyptians, there arrived Tatar envoys, and with them merchants, who were the bearers of\n\n\u00b9 The name is written 'Mankoberki' by Houdas in his translation of the life of Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn by al-Nasawi, Paris, 1895; see preface and note on p. 3. But it is written 'Mankburni' in the thirteenth-century MS. of the same work (B.M. Or. 5,662) and elsewhere. Safadi, in his notice of Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn in the W\u0101\u1e0di bil-Wafay\u0101t (B.M. Add. 23,359, 23a), spells the name 'Mank\u016bburni.'\norders on various sovereigns for the payment of sums of money,\\(^1\\) viz., 200,000 dinars on al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, and smaller sums on the rulers of R\u016bm, Mosul, Maridin, Mayyafar\u012bq\u012bn, Jaz\u012bra, and \u1e24u\u1e63n Kayf\u0101 respectively. These all shifted their liability on to al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, on the plea that he was their suzerain, and that they could not satisfy the orders unless he did the same. The claim was accordingly presented to al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, and he was advised by Sulaim\u0101n al-H\u0101fi\u1e93\u012b\\(^2\\) to satisfy it. But the author protested against this course on the ground that when T\u0101j al-Mul\u016bk visited K\u016byuk Kh\u0101n in 643, similar documents (\u0628\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646) were made out to him, to the effect that they on their side should be under no liability to satisfy such orders, nor to provide any assistance in men. And the documents were fetched and bore this out. Thereupon al-N\u0101\u1e63ir sent the author with the envoys and merchants to the other rulers with instructions to traverse the claim (\u0625\u0650\u062d\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0627\u062b\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652). In the meantime a message arrived from Mas\u02bf\u016bd\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The words are \u062d\u0648\u0627\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u062a\u0636\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u063a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u062e, meaning, apparently, orders for payment to the merchants of money due from the various rulers to the Tatars.\n\nThe Turkish word \u064a\u0627\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u062e means a royal order; see Zenker, Dict. Turk., ii, 949.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is the person suggested by Nicoll (Bodl. Cat., ii, 603) as the possible author of the MS. He is mentioned on fol. 56b, under the name of Zain al-D\u012bn, as having given advice owing to which succour sent from Damascus to support al-Lu\u02bein\u02bes son, al-Muzaffar, in Sinj\u0101r against the Tatars was by them intercepted and the place taken. A notice of this Zain al-D\u012bn Sulaim\u0101n al-H\u0101fi\u1e93\u012b is given by Ibn Abi Us\u0101bi\u02bfa (Brock., i, 325) in his \u201c\u02bfUy\u0101n al-Anb\u0101\u02be,\u201d Cairo, 1299, ii, 189, from which it appears that he was first in the service of al-H\u0101fi\u1e93 Arsl\u0101n Sh\u0101h, the son of al-\u02bfAdil, ruler of Qal\u02bfat Ja\u02bfbar, and contributed to bring about its transfer to al-N\u0101\u1e63ir of Halab (in 638, see fol. 35b of the MS.). He then went to Halab, where he gained influence and wealth, and on al-N\u0101\u1e63ir acquiring Damascus (in 648) he accompanied him there. When the Tatars began pressing their demands on al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, he was sent as envoy to Hul\u0101g\u016b, when he was completely gained over to the cause of the Tatars, and used his position to push their pretensions and to inspire al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, who was averse to warfare, with apprehension by exaggerating their resources as compared with his own. When Damascus submitted to the Tatars, Zain al-D\u012bn obtained a great position there under the Na\u02bfib, but when the Tatars were defeated by the Maml\u016bk Sultan Qutuz, and Syria was restored to the Moslems, the Na\u02bfib fled, and with him Zain al-D\u012bn, afraid of the treatment he would receive at Moslem hands. His fears were misplaced. \u1e62af\u0101di, in the W\u0101fi bil-Wafay\u0101t, Bodl., i, No. 668 (Seld. Arch. A. 23), records him under the name of Sulaim\u0101n b. \u02bfAl\u012b Zain al-D\u012bn Abu al-Muayyad Khat\u012bb \u02bfUqbar\u0101 al-H\u0101fi\u1e93\u012b, and, after quoting the above statements of Ibn Abi Us\u0101bi\u02bfa, says that he was accused by Hul\u0101g\u016b of corresponding with the ruler of Egypt, and was put to death with his children and relatives, to the number of fifty persons. \u1e62af\u0101di adds that the ruler in question was al-Zah\u012br, i.e. Baibars, and the date 662 A.H.\ncomplaining of the hostility shown to him since his father's death by Lu'lu' of Mosul, and offering to cede Jaz\u012bra to al-N\u0101\u1e63ir for a compensation. This offer al-N\u0101\u1e63ir did not immediately entertain, being fully occupied with Egyptian matters, but he directed the author to intercede with Lu'lu' on Mas\u02bf\u016bd's behalf, and to try and arrange matters. The author accordingly followed the envoys to Mosul, where he found he had been preceded by \u2018Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm Majd al-D\u012bn, son of the \u1e62\u0101\u1e25ib Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn \u2018Omar, known as Ibn al-\u2018Ad\u012bm (the historian of \u1e24alab), to condole on the death of Lu'lu'\u2019s son. Lu'lu' alleged various grievances against Mas\u02bf\u016bd, one being, apparently, that he had taught his daughter bad language, and he offered his guest an opportunity of overhearing a specimen, but received the reply that his statement was sufficient proof. He further said that Mas\u02bf\u016bd was wholly incompetent to guard his territory; that it ought to belong to someone who could do the Moslem cause some benefit; and he offered al-N\u0101\u1e63ir 50,000 dinars in gold if it were made over to him. The author did not encourage this plan, nevertheless Lu'lu' managed, through Majd al-D\u012bn, to come to a secret arrangement with al-N\u0101\u1e63ir to the effect that when the latter was rid of the Egyptian business he was to be at liberty to seize Jaz\u012bra. The author next proceeded to Jaz\u012bra, and Mas\u02bf\u016bd offered to leave the place in his charge whilst he went and saw al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, but the author declined this and went on to M\u0101rid\u012bn.\n\nThe question of the money claims had been discussed between the envoys and the author, in Lu'lu'\u2019s presence, and had led to much recrimination. The envoys were insolent to Lu'lu'; he reproached the author with having come to his detriment; the author retorted that Lu'lu' was the cause of the envoys' outburst, and the latter were rebuked by the Tatar N\u0101\u02beib at Mosul. But to him and them alike the author was inflexible, and refused all payment, whether on the part of al-N\u0101\u1e63ir or his feudatories. Whilst the envoys were on their way to Irbil, Lu'lu' caused them to be attacked and killed to a man, and in answer to the N\u0101\u02beib's protests alleged that it had happened outside his territory,\nbut that he would make an enquiry. He then collected out of his fortresses all such as deserved to die, had them executed, and handed over their possessions to the N\u0101'ib, saying that they were the culprits. This quite satisfied the N\u0101'ib, and Lu'lu' told the author in confidence that his suzerain al-N\u0101\u1e63ir might with advantage act by his example. As regards Jaz\u012bra, the author says that Lu'lu', on hearing of al-N\u0101\u1e63ir's assent, hastened in 649 to seize the town unconditionally. Mas\u02bf\u016bd was shipped off to Mosul by river, but he never arrived, being drowned on the way. He was the last ruler of the line of Zangi.\n\nThe author also gives in the MS. an account of his embassy to H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, or, more accurately, to his son Yashm\u016bt, who was in command of the Tatar force besieging Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn in 656 A.H. It came about thus. The last Ayyubid ruler of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, al-K\u0101mil Mu\u1e25ammad, who, in 645, succeeded his father, al-Mu\u1e93affar Gh\u0101zi b. al-\u02bf\u0100dil, had induced the Mongol B\u0101\u1e6d\u016b to recall the Tatar troops who were besieging Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn in 650, on condition of his attending in person at the Court of Mang\u016b (fol. 111a-b). Late in the year he did this, bearing rich gifts. His arrival coincided with that of al-Mu\u1e93affar Qar\u0101 Arsl\u0101n, the son of al-Sa\u02bf\u012bd Najm al-D\u012bn Gh\u0101zi, the Ortoqid ruler of M\u0101rid\u012bn, and a contest for precedence arose between them which was decided by Mang\u016b in favour of al-K\u0101mil, on the ground that his dominions were the more extensive. Both did homage to Mang\u016b, who dismissed them with a letter of recommendation to his brother H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, telling them they were not to attend on him again unless by order of H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, for they were now under his supervision (fol. 112b).\n\nAl-K\u0101mil, on his return to Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn, threw off his allegiance to Mang\u016b and imprisoned his representatives. Mang\u016b showed no resentment, only ordering al-K\u0101mil to proceed with his troops to Baghd\u0101d.\u00b9 He did not do this,\n\n\u00b9 In order to assist the Tatar besiegers. Al-K\u0101mil's disobedience to the order was one of the four acts alleged against him by H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b when he put him to death on the taking of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn in 658 (fol. 120a).\nand when H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b laid siege to Baghd\u0101d he removed to Harr\u0101n, and from there wrote to the author, then at \u1e24alab and on the point of starting on a mission, telling him to stop and await his arrival. He wrote also to al-N\u0101\u1e63ir announcing his coming, and on his encamping outside Damascus, al-N\u0101\u1e63ir came out to meet him in accordance with the opinion of all his advisers, except al-H\u0101fi\u1e93i. Al-K\u0101mil urged on him that the Tatars meant conquest, and that it was useless to give way to them. Since 642, he said, his suzerain al-N\u0101\u1e63ir had been making payments to them, and to what purpose? For his part, seeing he must perish, he would prefer to die a martyr in Allah\u2019s cause. Why should not the Sultan and his army, including himself, go to the assistance of the Moslems of Baghd\u0101d? If they succeeded they would stand well with\\(^1\\) the Caliph; if they failed they could avenge him. Many of al-N\u0101\u1e63ir\u2019s advisers supported this view. He, however, suggested sending an envoy to accompany al-K\u0101mil to H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b to negotiate. Al-K\u0101mil answered, \u201cI base my appeal on religion: you take a worldly view.\\(^2\\) If I chose to go to H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, I could do so to greater advantage than you could, having already seen him twice.\u201d Eventually nothing was done and Baghd\u0101d fell. Then the two sovereigns agreed to aid each other when attacked. Al-K\u0101mil, on his return, met the author at \u1e24alab, and was advised by him when he got home to remove his \u1e24ar\u012bm, appoint a deputy in his place, and come and renew his attempts to instil resolution into al-N\u0101\u1e63ir (fols. 113b\u2013114b).\n\nIn 656 Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn was attacked by the Tatars under Y\u0101shm\u016b\u1e6d, son of H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, reinforced by troops from the rulers of Mosul and M\u0101rid\u012bn. The knowledge that al-K\u0101mil was in the place caused the siege to be pushed hotly. Al-N\u0101\u1e63ir carried out his idea of despatching an envoy, for in 657 the author says (fol. 115b) that he left, accompanied\n\n\\(^1\\) The phrase is \u0627\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627. It is used again on fol. 135a.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0627\u0645\u0631\u062f\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0645\u0631\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0649\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0631\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0649.\nby a grandson of Saladin and by the three sons of al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, together with his \u1e24ar\u012bm, who were to be left in \u1e24alab, and taking with him 1,500 dinars and a jewelled belt and sword as gifts for Yashm\u016b\u1e6d. After being attacked at \u1e24\u0101mah by Tatars, who were bought off with 2,000 dirhams, the party travelled by \u1e24arr\u0101n to M\u0101rid\u012bn, where the author was refused an audience by the Ortoqid Sa\u02bf\u012bd because of the Tatars. At al-\u1e62\u016br another Tatar attack was bought off. They then crossed the Euphrates, meeting with further rough treatment from the Tatars, their baggage being searched and some of it taken from them. Next day they were received in audience by the \u012al Kh\u0101n, and delivered their complimentary message, complaining at the same time of Tatar attacks and outrages on the inhabitants. The reply was that these were the aggressors, and that the only object on their side was to punish the Turkomans and Arabs. The envoy then demanded compensation, failing which they would throw off their allegiance; this was answered by threats.\n\nThe Tatars now tried to use the envoy as a means of drawing al-K\u0101mil out from the besieged city. They told him al-K\u0101mil wished to see him. He replied this was needless. Asked if he would go to him at their bidding, he pleaded the absence of instructions from his sovereign. As they insisted, he asked what he was to say to him; they replied, \"Say you are come from al-N\u0101\u1e63ir to plead for permission for him to come out and submit to the \u012al-Kh\u0101n.\" This message he refused to take, whereupon he was taken past a heap of slain, and told that in an hour he would be as they were. He replied that destiny was inevitable. Pressed as to why he refused to go, he said that they meant through him to lure al-K\u0101mil out to destruction and to slaughter the inhabitants, all of which would have happened through his means. A chief urged him not to talk thus or he would be killed. Finally, he consented to go, on condition that al-K\u0101mil was not to come forth, and that when terms were agreed to the Tatars should depart. He was then conducted by a Tatar officer to the city gate, when they were met by\nthe Governor. Three days' negotiation followed, during which the besieged provided them with ample and varied food, to show their ability to endure the straits they were in. Eventually terms were agreed on, viz., a payment in money and in kind, including camels, mules, and horses, part forthwith, and the rest when the Tatars were gone. And the Tatars were actually moving eastwards on their way to depart, when a message came from Lu\u2019lu\u2019 of Mosul announcing that certain coast inhabitants and Kurds were on their way to attack al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, who had resolved on flight. Letters came, too, addressed to the envoy, urging him to make peace, and get the Tatars away. On this the Tatars dissembled. The envoy was interrogated, and in spite of his explanation the operations against Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn were renewed, and he was ordered to depart. He withdrew accordingly to M\u0101rid\u012bn. This time he saw its ruler, al-Sa\u02bf\u012bd, who congratulated him on his efforts in the Moslem cause, and said that if he were granted a subsidy in men and money by al-N\u0101\u1e63ir he would make the Tatars raise the siege, and they could then unite in wresting Mosul from that hypocrite (\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0642), i.e. Lu\u2019lu\u2019. And to this he bound himself by oath. The author then continued his journey to \u1e24arr\u0101n, when he heard that the Tatars had regretted his departure, and had decided to reopen negotiations through him. At \u1e24alab he heard that Yashm\u016b\u1e6d had raised the siege, but had left a force under a deputy to prevent al-K\u0101mil's escape, the cause of this being cold, want of supplies, and mortality among the horses. And during the whole of the year 657, messages reached Damascus from Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn imploring aid.\n\nFrom \u1e24alab the author was summoned to Damascus, and went to meet al-N\u0101\u1e63ir on his way back from Jerusalem. He told him of what had been suggested. To the proposal of the ruler of M\u0101rid\u012bn no reply was sent.\n\nThese are the only fragments of the author\u2019s personal history to be found in the MS., but it is probable that more might be gathered from the volumes on \u1e24alab and on Damascus.\nThe MS. contains references to the following writers on geography:\n\n*Ya'q\u016bbi* (Brockelmann, Gesch. Arab. Lit., i, 226), on fol. 3a for Diy\u0101r Rab\u012b\u02bfa; 26a for al-Ruh\u0101; and 27a for Jaz\u012brat ibn \u2018Omar.\n\n*Ibn Khurd\u0101dhbih* (ib., 225), on fol. 3a for Diy\u0101r Rab\u012b\u02bfa.\n\n*Ibn \u1e24auqal* (ib., 229), on fol. 21a for Raqqa; 41a for D\u0101r\u0101; and 44b for Sinj\u0101r.\n\n*Idrisi* (ib., 477), *Nuzhat al-Musht\u0101q fi ikhtir\u0101q al-\u0100f\u0101q*, on fol. 21a for Raqqa; and 26a on al-Ruh\u0101.\n\nWriters on philology and tradition:\n\n*al-Sharqi b. Kat\u0101mi* (W\u00fcst. Gesch., 23), on fols. 65b and 66b for the origin of the names of \u0100mid and Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn.\n\n*Hish\u0101m al-Kalbi* (Brockelmann, i, 139), on fols. 21a and 44b for the names of Raqqa and of Sinj\u0101r.\n\n*Jaw\u0101liqi* (ib., 280), \u201cal-Mu\u2018arrab,\u201d on fol. 14a on the change of \u2018Arran\u2019 into \u2018\u1e24arr\u0101n.\u2019\n\nAnd the following historians:\n\n*W\u0101qid\u012b* (ib., 135), on fol. 26a for the conquest of al-Ruh\u0101.\n\n*Bil\u0101dhu\u1e63\u012b* (ib., 141), on fol. 37a for that of Na\u1e63\u012bb\u012bn.\n\n*T\u0101b\u0101r\u012b* (ib., 142), on fol. 14a for the founding of \u1e24arr\u0101n, and 21a for the visit of Man\u1e63\u016br to Raqqa (154 A.H.).\n\n\u201c*Ta\u02ber\u012bkh Mu\u1e93aff\u0101r\u012b*\u201d (W\u00fcst. Gesch., 205), on fol. 131b for M\u0101rid\u012bn, under Muqtad\u012br, 317 A.H.\n\n*Hamadh\u0101n\u012b* (ib., 232), \u2018Uyun al-Siyar (written \u2018Unw\u0101n), on fol. 11a for the Saff\u0101rids; on fol. 130b for M\u0101rid\u012bn in the time of Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did; and his \u201cTadhy\u012bl,\u201d on fol. 132a for the fact that Mumahhid al-Daula reigned only a single year over Diy\u0101r Bakr, which, he says, is contradicted by the history of\n\n*Ibn al-Azraq al-F\u0101riq\u012b* (ib., 256), which is quoted largely, as above mentioned.\nThe K\u0101mil of Ibn al-\u0100th\u012br is frequently quoted; once, on fol. 46a, for matter sub 502 A.H. relating to Sinj\u0101r, which does not appear in Tornberg's edition.\n\nIbn al-\u2018Ad\u012bm\u2019s history of Halab is quoted, on fol. 73b, for the revolt of \u2018\u012asa b. al-Sh\u0101ikh in Diy\u0101r Bakr in 255 A.H.\n\nLastly, on fol. 26a the author quotes Ma\u1e25b\u016bb b. Qustant\u012bn al-Manbij\u012b for the Tower of Babel, and for Nimrod, the founder of al-Ruh\u0101. This Ma\u1e25b\u016bb is likewise quoted by Ibn Shadd\u0101d in the first volume of the \u0100l\u0101q, relating to Halab and its district,\u2014B.M. Add. 23,334, sub \u201cAntioch,\u201d on fol. 86a, for the rise of the Maccabee, John Hyrcanus; and again, sub \u201cManbij,\u201d on fol. 96b, as saying in his annals of the Mul\u016bk al-R\u016bm that the life of Isaac, the son of Abraham, extended thirty-one years after the birth of Levi, the son of Jacob; and that during that period Queen Semiramis (\u0633\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0633) built a temple in a town on the Euphrates to an idol, with a staff of seventy priests, the town being called Hieropolis (?). This passage occurs somewhat differently in a work largely based on that of Ibn Shadd\u0101d, the Durr al-Muntakhab of Ibn Shihna (Brockelmann, Gesch., ii, 42); see B.M. Add. 22,673, 112b, and 23,337, 77a, where the quotation from Ma\u1e25b\u016bb is made to appear part of a quotation from Ya\u2018q\u016bb\u012b which precedes it in Ibn Shadd\u0101d\u2019s work. Mas\u2018\u016bd\u012b also, in his Kit\u0101b al-Tanbih wa\u2019l Ishr\u0101f (Bibl. Geogr. Ar., pt. viii, p. 154), when treating of the Christian Emperors before Isl\u0101m, mentions Ma\u1e25b\u016bb b. Qustant\u012bn and Eutychius (Brock., i, 148) as the two best Melchite historians he was acquainted with. There is at Florence a MS. which is described by Assemani (Bibl. Med. Laur. et Pal. Cat. or. Florentiae, 1742, No. 133) as a universal history by Ma\u1e25b\u016bb b. Constant\u012bn, Jacobite Archbishop of Mabb\u016bg (Manbij), extending from the creation to the author\u2019s own time, viz. 712 A.H. (1312 A.D.). But inasmuch as Mas\u2018\u016bd\u012b died in 345 A.H., the attribution of this MS. to Ma\u1e25b\u016bb is inaccurate, or else it must include a continuation by another hand. And I am told by Mr. E. W. Brooks that the name of Ma\u1e25b\u016bb\nis not to be found in the list of Jacobite bishops given in the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian (B.M. Or. 4,402, 405b), which includes those ordained between 793 and 1166 A.D. Ma\u1e25b\u016bb appears also to be quoted in the chronological work of Abu Sh\u0101kir (Butrus b. Muhadhdhib), who wrote circ. 662 A.H.; see Dillmann, B.M. Cat. Ethiop., No. 36, under ch. 48.\n\nNote.\u2014A quotation from Ibn Shadd\u0101d\u2019s description of Damascus contained in the Bibl. Geog. Ar., pt. vi, preface, p. xii, has led to my being favoured with the following information by Professor de Goeje. He writes that the MS. from which the quotation was taken (Leyden, 1466) is entitled \u201cBaraq al-Sh\u0101m fi Mah\u0101sin Iql\u012bm al-Sh\u0101m,\u201d and that a comparison of its contents with the description of vol. iii of \u201cal-A\u2018l\u0101q al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bra,\u201d given in the B.M. Cat., No. 1,324, shows the MS. in question to be the first and second parts of that volume, under a new title. And he adds the following extract from the description of the MS. to appear in the forthcoming revised edition of the Leyden Catalogue:\n\n\u201cQuum h\u00e6c Capita in Exemplaribus operis de-siderentur, codex noster pretiosus est; utilissimum nempe est opus ad res Syri\u00e6 Meridionalis et Palestin\u00e6 pr\u00e6sertim s\u00e6culis sexto et septimo cognoscendas. Ex Antiquioribus s\u00e6pe laudantur al-Bal\u0101dzori, Geographia al-Ja\u1e33\u016bbi, interdum Abu-\u1e24anifa ad-Dinaw\u0101r\u012b et Ibn Hauqal. Codex Anno 870 bene exaratus, continet 289 pag.\u201d\n\nThe concluding parts, therefore, both of vol. i and of vol. iii, relating to the dynasties which ruled at \u1e24alab and at Damascus, as well as the part of the work relating to Mosul, are still to be sought for.\n\nSince this article was in print Professor Sachau, now on a visit here from Berlin, has enabled me to identify, as I believe, yet another MS. as a part of al-A\u2018l\u0101q al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bra of \u2018Izz al-D\u012bn Ibn Shadd\u0101d, viz. No. 9,800 in Ahlwardt\u2019s Catalogue. The Professor has been good enough to ascertain that the\naccount therein of the conquest of Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn and \u0100mid (fol. 47a) is given on the authority of \"Ahmad b. Y\u016bsuf b. 'Ali Ibn al-Azraq \u1e62\u0101\u1e25ib T\u0101'rikh Mayy\u0101f\u0101riq\u012bn wa \u0100mid.\" From the entry in the Catalogue it appears that the author of the Berlin MS. mentions his embassy to the Tatars in 657 A.H.; that he had written a continuation to the history of Ibn al-Ath\u012br; and that he was writing this work in 679 A.H.;\u2014which accords with the statements in the Bodleian MS. Marsh 333. Its contents seem to be covered by the Berlin MS., but the opening statement in the latter MS., that it was to include an account of Mosul, does not seem borne out by the Catalogue's analysis of its contents.\n\u0648\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0637\u0644\u0642\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0648\u0646\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649

Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\n(Continued from p. 610, July Number.)\n\n7. Sinjar b. Malikshah (ff. 70a\u201377a).\n\nHis full name and title ran as-Sul\u1e6d\u0101nu'l-A\u02bfdham Mu\u02bfizzu'd-Duny\u0101 wa'd-D\u012bn Abu'l-\u1e24\u0101rith Sinjar b. Maliksh\u0101h Burh\u0101nu Amiri'l-Mumintin. His motto (tawq\u012b\u02bf) was \u062a\u0648\u0643\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647. His prime ministers were Mu\u02bf\u012bnu'd-D\u012bn Mukhta\u1e63\u1e63 of K\u0101sh\u0101n, Shih\u0101bu'd-D\u012bn Abu'l-Mah\u0101sin b. al-Faq\u012bhu'l-ajall (nephew of the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk), Sharafu'd-D\u012bn Ab\u016b T\u0101hir M\u0101mis\u0101 of Qum, Yagh\u0101n (\u064a\u063a\u0622\u0646) b. al-K\u0101shghar\u012b, Qiwa'mu'd-D\u012bn Abu'l-Q\u0101sim, and N\u0101siru'd-D\u012bn T\u0101hir b. Fakhru'l-Mulk. His chamberlains were the Am\u012br Ghuzughl\u016b (\u063a\u0632\u063a\u0644\u0648): cf. Bund\u0101r\u012b, p. 185, l. 16, which has \u063a\u0632\u063a\u0644\u0648, \u1e24usayn al-\u1e24\u0101jib, Nidh\u0101mu'd-D\u012bn Mahm\u016bd of K\u0101sh\u0101n, and Falaku'd-D\u012bn 'Al\u012b Chatr\u012b (cf. Bund\u0101r\u012b, p. 225, l. 1).\n\nAlike in length of life and brilliant achievements Sinjar surpassed all the other Selj\u016bq monarchs. From the time he was made king of Khur\u0101s\u0101n by Barkiy\u0101ruq he effected, during a period of 40 years, nineteen conquests. He took Ghazna and made Bahr\u0101msh\u0101h king thereof, on the understanding that he should pay him 1,000 din\u0101rs a day (f. 71a). He also took captive the king of Samarqand, for after Barkiy\u0101ruq's death A\u1e25mad Kh\u0101n rebelled, but was defeated and taken prisoner in A.H. 524 (= A.D. 1130). He also took S\u012bst\u0101n and Khw\u0101razm, and made Atsiz (or Utsuz, \u0627\u062a\u0633\u0632, as it is here pointed) b. Mu\u1e25ammad b. N\u016b\u0161tag\u016bn \u063a\u0632\u062c\u0647 ruler of the latter (Khw\u0101razmsh\u0101h), and T\u0101ju'd-D\u012bn Am\u012br Abu'l-Fadl governor of Nimruz and Z\u0101bulist\u0101n.\nOn the death of his brother Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad in A.H. 511 (A.D. 1117\u20138) he came from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n to \u2018Ir\u00e1q, where his nephew Ma\u1e25m\u00fad b. Mu\u1e25ammad had been crowned king. Ma\u1e25m\u00fad was persuaded by his nobles to attack his uncle, but was defeated, and fled to Isfah\u00e1n. His governor, \u2018Al\u00ed B\u00e1r, sent his kadkhud\u00e1 or steward, Abu\u2019l-Q\u00e1sim Anas\u00e1b\u00e1d\u00ed (\u0622\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06cc), to Sinjar to apologize for his nephew\u2019s conduct, and it was agreed that Ma\u1e25m\u00fad should wait on his uncle and remain with him a month, foregoing, during the whole of this period, the outward signs of sovereignty enumerated (f. 71b) in the following words:\n\n... \u0628\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0628\u0631 \u0646\u0634\u0633\u0645 \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0648\u062f \u0622\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0646\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0631\u0627\u067e\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u062e \u062c\u0647\u0631\u0645\u06cc \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0628\u0631 \u0646\u0634\u0633\u0645 \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0648\u062f \u0622\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0639\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u06af\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0622\u0646\u062c \u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0648 \u0622\u06cc\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u06af\u0630\u0631\u0627\u0646\u062f.\n\nAfter Ma\u1e25m\u00fad had thus humbled himself, Sinjar made him his vicegerent in \u2018Ir\u00e1q.\n\nSo great were Sinjar\u2019s domains that his name was recited in the khutba in the mosques from K\u00e1shghar to Yaman, Mecca and T\u00e1\u2019\u00edf, and from Mukr\u00e1n and \u2018Umm\u00e1n to Adhar-bayj\u00e1n and the frontiers of R\u00fam, and continued to be so recited until a year after his death; yet he was simple and unostentatious in his dress and habits, wearing generally a \u0642\u0628\u0627\u06cc \u0631\u0646\u062f\u0646\u06cc\u062c\u06cc. He was, moreover, virtuous and pious, and in his day Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n was the goal of the learned and the focus of culture and science.\n\nIn the year A.H. [5]35 (= A.D. 1140\u20131), however, when Sinjar went from Merv to Samarqand, the pagans of Khat\u00e1 (Cathay) began to harry the land, and anarchy to prevail in Transoxania, so that men accounted death a blessing:\n\n\u06a9\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u06a9 \u062f\u0627 \u061b \u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0648\u062a \u0634\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u064b\n\nThe invaders (of the \u062e\u06cc\u0644 \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0642) numbered 30,000 or 40,000 men, and the army of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n was entirely routed by these pagan hordes, who slew 3,000 or 4,000 people, including many men of note. T\u00e1ju\u2019d-D\u00edn Abu\u2019l-Fadl\nadvised Sinjar to flee, but he, with 300 knights, attacked the heathen with great valour, emerging from the conflict with only fifteen survivors. After this Sinjar fled to Balkh and occupied the fortress of Tirmidh (f. 72\u00b0), where he was gradually joined by the survivors of his army. The poet Far\u00edd-i-K\u00e1tiib (or Far\u00edd-i-dabir, as he is here called) sought to console the King for his recent reverse by the following well-known quatrain:\n\n\u0634\u0647\u0627 \u0632 \u0633\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0648 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0634\u062f \u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u062a\u0628\u063a \u062a\u0648 \u062c\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0639\u0636\u0627 \u06a9\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u06af\u0631 \u062c\u0634\u0645 \u0628\u062f\u06cc \u0631\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0622\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0632 \u0642\u0636\u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u0622\u0646\u06a9\u0633 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u06a9 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0633\u062a \u062e\u0630\u0627\u0633\u062a.\n\nWhen Sinjar fled, T\u00e1ju\u2019d-D\u00edn, king of N\u00edmr\u00faz, stood his ground and fought with such valour that the heathen of Cathay were filled with astonishment and admiration, and, when they had taken him captive, brought him before the Ilkh\u00e1n (\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0646), who kept him with himself for a year, and treated him with kindness and consideration. At the end of this period both he and the Queen Turk\u00e1n Kh\u00e1t\u00fan (who had also been taken prisoner) were sent back to Sinjar.\n\nDuring the anarchy caused by Sinjar\u2019s defeat, Atsiz Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h (here printed Atsz) behaved extremely ill, and seized the occasion to loot and plunder Merv and N\u00edsh\u00e1p\u00far; and when Sinjar sent him an arrow on which were inscribed some well-known and oft-cited verses, he despatched in reply the following lines:\n\n\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0630\u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0631\u062e\u0634 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u062a \u0645\u0631\u0627 \u067e\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0645 \u0644\u06af \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u062a\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0627 \u062a\u06cc \u0633\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0631\u0648\u0645\u060c \u062e\u062f\u0627\u064a \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u06af \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a.\n\n1 See my edition of Dawlatsh\u00e1h, p. 107.\n2 These are quoted in a fuller and somewhat different form in the T\u00e1rikh-i-Gusida, in the section dealing with the Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1hs. A well-known parody on them by Ubayd-i-Z\u00e1k\u00e1n\u00ed will be found at p. 290, ll. 4\u20135, of my ed. of Dawlatsh\u00e1h.\nSeven years later, when Sinjar was at Ray (cf. Bund\u0101r\u012b, p. 224), Sult\u0101n Mas\u2018\u016bd came to pay his respects to him, and at the audience the head of S\u016br\u012b, king of Gh\u016br, sent from Ghazna [by Bahr\u0101msh\u0101h], was laid before him. On this occasion Far\u012bd-i-K\u0101tib composed the following quatrain:\n\n\u0622\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0646\u062a \u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646\u060c \u0633\u0631 \u062c\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0634 \u0637\u0627\u0642 \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646\u060c\n\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0631 \u062a\u0648 \u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0633\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0645\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06a9 \u0633\u0631 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0639\u0631\u0642 \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646.\n\nThe S\u0101m to whom allusion is here made was the brother of [Sayfu\u2019d-D\u012bn] S\u016br\u012b, king of Gh\u016br. Sinjar remained at Ray for thirteen days to renew and ratify his treaty with Mas\u2018\u016bd, on whom and the Am\u012brs of \u1e2air\u0101q he conferred robes of honour.\n\nIn Ramad\u0101n, A.H. 543 (= Jan.\u2013Feb., A.D. 1149), he returned to Khur\u0101s\u0101n. A year later \u1e24usayn b. \u1e24asan,\u00b9 king of Gh\u016br, rose in arms to avenge his nephew (bir\u0101dar-z\u0101da), and was joined by \u2018Al\u012b Chatr\u012b. This disloyalty on the part of the latter caused Sinjar bitter vexation, for he had raised him from the post of court jester (\u0644\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0631\u062c\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062e\u0631\u06af\u06cc) to be his chamberlain, and had given him lands in fiefhold about Her\u0101t. The King of Gh\u016br, though supported by a large army of horse and foot, was defeated, and both he and \u2018Al\u012b Chatr\u012b fell into Sinjar\u2019s hands. \u2018Al\u012b Chatr\u012b met with condign punishment, for he was sawn in two under the royal standard, while the King of Gh\u016br was held captive. This victory had a great moral effect, for it was the first gained by Sinjar since the disaster which had befallen him at the hands of the heathen of Kha\u1e6d\u0101.\n\nTowards the end of A.H. 548 (= A.D. 1153\u20134) occurred the disastrous invasion of the fierce tribes of Ghuzz. These were Turkm\u0101ns whose pastures lay about Khatl\u0101n, a dependency of Balkh, and who paid yearly for their grazing rights 24,000 sheep for the King\u2019s kitchen into the hands of the\n\n\u00b9 The MS. has \u1e24asan b. \u1e24usayn, but I suppose that \u1e24usayn Jah\u0101nsh\u0101h, the son of \u2018Izzu\u2019d-D\u012bn \u1e24asan, is meant.\nsteward of his household (khv\u00e1ns\u00e1l\u00e1r). The harshness and greed of this steward and his satellites led to disputes in which blood was shed, and Qum\u00e1j the Isfahs\u00e1l\u00e1r, governor of Balkh, wrote to Sinjar warning him of the growing power and insolence of the Ghuzz, and asking to be made Commissioner (sha\u1e25na) over them, promising to reduce them to obedience and exact from them an increased yearly tribute of 30,000 sheep. This request was granted, but the Ghuzz paid no heed to Qum\u00e1j and drove him out of their lands. He and his son \u2018Al\u00e1\u2019u\u2019d-D\u00edn Maliku\u2019l-Mashriq ('the King of the East') accordingly set out on a punitive expedition against the Ghuzz, but were defeated, and the latter slain. Sinjar's nobles then persuaded him that such insolence could not be passed over, and that it behoved him to march against the Ghuzz in person. On learning this the Ghuzz were frightened and offered apologies for their conduct, and presents of 100,000 din\u00e1rs and 1,000 Turkish slaves as an atonement (f. 74b). Sinjar wished to accept these offers, but unfortunately his nobles overruled him, and he was persuaded to attack the Ghuzz, who came out to meet him as suppliants, accompanied by their women and children, entreating his clemency and forgiveness, and offering seven maunds of silver from each household. Again the King was anxious to accept their proposals, but Am\u00edr Mu\u2019ayyid-i-Buzurg, Yarinqush, and \u2018Umar-i-\u2018Ajam\u00ed seized his reins, crying out that having come so far it was useless to turn back. So battle was joined; and Sinjar\u2019s soldiers, who hated the Mu\u2019ayyid, were half-hearted in the fight, while the Ghuzz, being desperate, fought furiously, and at length put Sinjar\u2019s army to utter rout (f. 75a), and pursued them across the river, wherein many perished. Sinjar himself was taken prisoner and brought to Merv (which, since the time of Chaghr\u00ed Beg, ranked as the Selj\u00faq capital), and his captors looted the city for three days. On the first day they were busy carrying off gold, silver, and silk; on the second, brass, iron, and copper; and on the third, meaner stuffs\u2014\n\n\u0648\u064e\u062d\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0646\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u062e\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064c \u0648\u064e\u062e\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064c\n\n... \u0627\u0641\u0652\u062a\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0648\u064e\u062d\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0646\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u062e\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064c \u0648\u064e\u062e\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064c\nThen they tortured the unfortunate inhabitants to make them disclose hidden treasures, after which, reinforced by thrice their number of disbanded soldiers and other rogues, they pushed on to N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br.

For two years Sinjar remained a captive in their hands, until it happened that they brought him to the gates of Balkh, where some of his old retainers, such as Mu'ayyid\u00e1yi-\u00c1ba (\u0645\u064f\u0624\u064e\u062f\u0650\u0651\u06cc \u0622\u0628\u064e\u0647), escorted by certain Am\u00edrs of the Ghuzz, namely Qurqurd (\u0642\u0631\u0642\u0631\u062f) and T\u00fat\u00ed Beg, waited upon him;\n\n1 The numerous forms under which this name occurs are given by Houtsma on p. 281 of Bund\u00e1ri.\nand Mu\u2019ayyid\u00e1 succeeded in bribing some of the Ghuzz to help him to effect Sinjar\u2019s escape. Sinjar was taken out by these as though on a hunting expedition, but, once in the open, they pushed straight on to the Oxus opposite Tirmidh, where they already had boats waiting, and, evading pursuit, conveyed Sinjar to Merv, where he gradually collected an army. But grief at the ruin and desolation of his country brought on an illness of which he died in A.H. 551 (A.D. 1156).

When, eight months after his accession, his uncle Sinjar came from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n to \u2018Ir\u00e1q, he fought him and was defeated (as narrated above, p. 850), but Sinjar treated him with kindness and consideration, and gave him \u2018Ir\u00e1q as his appanage and his daughter Mah-Malik Kh\u00e1t\u00fan to wife, but she died shortly afterwards. He quarrelled with the Caliph al-Mustarshid b\u2019il-l\u00e1h and besieged and took Baghdad, after which he was reconciled with the Caliph.\n\n9. Tughril b. Mu\u1e25ammad b.

On the death of his brother Ma\u1e25m\u00fad he was made king of \u2018Ir\u00e1q by his uncle Sinjar.

He was very fond of animals, and devoted to the chase.\n\nOn the death of his brother (and immediate predecessor) Tughril I (in A.H. 527=A.D. 1133) in the Palace of 'Al\u00e1'u'd-Dawla in Hamadh\u00e1n, the am\u00edrs summoned him in haste from Baghdad, and at the same time sent a message to Sult\u00e1n D\u00e1'\u00fad, who was at Tabr\u00edz with the At\u00e1bek Qar\u00e1 Sunqur. Mas'\u00fad, however, was first in the field, and though on passing Hulw\u00e1n he found the roads deeply blocked with snow, he caused it to be trampled down by camels until he was able to make his way to Hamadh\u00e1n. Having mounted the throne, he proclaimed D\u00e1'\u00fad his successor, and gave him his daughter Gawhar Kh\u00e1t\u00fan to wife. The Caliph al-Mustarshid came forth from Baghdad on Mas'\u00fad's heels, marching on K\u00fahist\u00e1n, 'Ir\u00e1q, and Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. Mas'\u00fad, to whose support Sult\u00e1n D\u00e1'\u00fad and Qar\u00e1 Sunqur had pledged themselves, came up with him at D\u00ednawar. The Caliph, deserted by his am\u00edrs, who took to flight, fell into Mas'\u00fad's hands, but was treated by him with consideration. Mas'\u00fad then marched into \u00c1dharbayj\u00e1n, and the Caliph al-Mustarshid\n\n\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0686\u06cc\u0646\u06cc (\u0634\u064e\u0639\u0631) \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0633\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u062f\u064d \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0651\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0627\u062d\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0645\u0627 \u0630\u0647\u0628\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0633\u064e\u0623\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062e\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0650 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0641\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e \u0644\u0650\u064a \u0645\u0644\u0650\u064a \u062e\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0630\u0647\u0628\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u06cc\u062a\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0634\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0634\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0637\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0647 \u063a\u0646\u0645\u060c \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0634\u064a\u0639 \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649\u060c\nwas assassinated at Mar\u00e1gha by the Mal\u00e1hid\u00e1, or Assassins. His son, ar-R\u00e1shid, who succeeded to the Caliphate, marched forth from Baghdad at the head of a great host to avenge his father's murder, but, on learning that Mas'\u00fad was advancing against him, withdrew to Isfah\u00e1n, where, as also in Ir\u00e1q and K\u00fahist\u00e1n, famine was severe, so that men were in some cases driven by hunger to eat human flesh. Sa'du'd-Dawla, the governor of Isfah\u00e1n, was at this juncture assassinated by the Mal\u00e1hid\u00e1.\n\nOn the death of al-R\u00e1shid at Isfah\u00e1n, his uncle al-Muqtaff\u00ed, the brother of al-Mustarshid, was made Caliph by Mas'\u00fad, who then returned to Hamadh\u00e1n. Bursuq, the lord of L\u00edstar, conspired with other amirs against Mas'\u00fad, who, however, made a rapid night-march from Hamadh\u00e1n, reached their camp at the time of the midday siesta, when they were all asleep, and established himself in their midst. His presence overawed the rebels, who came in one by one and made their submission to him, and received pardon (f. 96a).\n\nIn the following winter Mas'\u00fad returned to Baghdad and made Muhammad Khiz\u00e1na-d\u00e1r (or al-Kh\u00e1zin, 'the Treasurer') waz\u00edr. This was a man of violent temper, and arrogant towards the amirs, who wrote complaints of his conduct to the At\u00e1bek Qar\u00e1 Sunqur. The At\u00e1bek therefore hastened from Adharbayj\u00e1n with Selj\u00faq Sh\u00e1h, passed by the A'lam district of Hamadh\u00e1n, and alighted at a place called Murghz\u00e1r-i-Sag (\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u063a\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0631 \u0633\u064e\u062c), whence he sent word to the Sult\u00e1n (who had ordered him to proceed to P\u00e1rs to instal his brother Selj\u00faq Sh\u00e1h as governor of that province), saying, \"I will not fulfil this mission till my lord the King sends me the head and the right hand of Muhammad al-Kh\u00e1zin.\" This demand, which was supported by the other amirs, the Sult\u00e1n was unable to resist, and the head and hand of the unfortunate minister were accordingly cut off and sent to Qar\u00e1 Sunqur.\n\n1 This happened on Thursday, the 18th of Dhu'l-Qa'da, A.H. 529 (= Aug. 30, A.D. 1135), according to Bund\u00e1ri (p. 178), who adds that this assassination was instigated by Sinjar. Compare Anecdote viii of the Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la (pp. 37-8) of the separate reprint of my translation.\nThen Qar\u00e1 Sunqur set out for P\u00e1rs, defeated Mank\u00fabars, enthroned Selj\u00faq Sh\u00e1h, and made \u2018Izzu\u2019l-Mulk, who was his kad-khud\u00e1 or steward, waz\u00edr. As soon as he withdrew, however, Mank\u00fabars returned, defeated and captured Selj\u00faq Sh\u00e1h, and imprisoned him in \u2018the White Castle\u2019 (\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u062a), where he died. Qar\u00e1 Sunqur, after being received with honour at Hamadh\u00e1n, went to \u00c1dharbayj\u00e1n, where he too was overtaken by death.\n\nIt was after the death of Qar\u00e1 Sunqur that J\u00e1w\u00e1l\u00ed (\u062c\u0627\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a) the j\u00e1nd\u00e1r became powerful. Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad went from Hamadh\u00e1n to Ray because Sinjar was angered against \u2018Abb\u00e1s (the governor of Ray: see Bund\u00e1ri, pp. 191 et seqq.), and wished to punish him. But when (f. 97a) Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad reached Ray, \u2018Abb\u00e1s propitiated him with rich and costly presents, so that the Sult\u00e1n left him unmolested and returned to Hamadh\u00e1n and \u00cdsfah\u00e1n. \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n the Chamberlain and the other am\u00edrs persuaded the Sult\u00e1n to seize \u2018Izzu\u2019l-Mulk and send him to Hamadh\u00e1n, where he died. Then \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n summoned B\u00faz\u00e1ba (\u0628\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0629) and \u2018Abb\u00e1s, with whom he was conspiring against the Sult\u00e1n; and B\u00faz\u00e1ba arrived at \u00cdsfah\u00e1n bringing with him Malik Muhammad and Maliksh\u00e1h (the sons of Mahm\u00fad and nephews of Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad). The Sult\u00e1n, having no army with him, sent for \u00cdlduguz (\u0625\u064a\u0644\u062f\u063a\u0632), the most loyal and obedient of his servants, to join him from \u00c1dharbayj\u00e1n, while he himself set out for Baghdad; but he had only gone three stages, as far as Kirm\u00e1nsh\u00e1h\u00e1n, when B\u00faz\u00e1ba reached Hamadh\u00e1n. Being joined at Kirm\u00e1nsh\u00e1h\u00e1n by \u00cdlduguz and other am\u00edrs at the head of a large army, Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad pushed on to Hulw\u00e1n, where it was snowing in such wise as it seldom snows even in the coldest countries. He remained for four months at Baghdad, and then proceeded to \u00c1dharbayj\u00e1n by way of the Pass of Qar\u00e1b\u00fal\u00ed (\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0644\u064a), entrusting the princes Malik Arsl\u00e1n and Maliksh\u00e1h b. Selj\u00faq, who were in attendance on him, to Am\u00edr Mas\u2018\u00fad, the governor (sh\u00e1hna) of Baghdad, for safe custody in the Castle of Takr\u00edt. On his arrival at Mar\u00e1gha he was waited\non by J\u00e1wal\u00ed and the amirs of Adharbayj\u00e1n, who accompanied him to Miy\u00e1na (f. 97b). These amirs conspired against the King's favourite, Kh\u00e1s-beg Beg Arsl\u00e1n b. Balankar\u00ed, but a wonderful exhibition of skill in horsemanship on his part turned J\u00e1wal\u00ed from his design. Thence they proceeded to Zanj\u00e1n.\n\n'Abb\u00e1s, accompanied by Malik Sulaym\u00e1n, marched with a large army from A'lam (near Hamadh\u00e1n) to Anbat (\u0627\u0646\u0628\u0637), where he effected a junction with B\u00faz\u00e1ba, with whom were Malik Mu\u1e25ammad and Malik Sh\u00e1h, the sons of the late Sult\u00e1n Ma\u1e25m\u00fad. The army of Sult\u00e1n Mas'\u00fad were alarmed at the sight of this formidable host, but he himself, putting his trust in God, \"accounted them as nobody\" (\u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06a9\u0633 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u0634\u0645\u0631\u062f). While the battle was imminent, Malik Sulaym\u00e1n withdrew towards Ray, and was followed by 'Abb\u00e1s. These desertions alarmed B\u00faz\u00e1ba (f. 98c), who accordingly, on the following day, retired towards I\u1e63fah\u00e1n with Malik Mu\u1e25ammad and Maliksh\u00e1h. He was pursued by Am\u00edr J\u00e1wal\u00ed, but succeeded in effecting his escape. Sult\u00e1n Mas'\u00fad marched from Anbat to Ray, where he encamped at the place called \"Rustam's Stable\" (Akhur-i-Rustam). 'Abb\u00e1s fled to Ardahan (\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0647\u0646), while Malik Sulaym\u00e1n came to meet the King and do obeisance to him, after which he accompanied him to Ray. Now the Chamberlain 'Abdu'r-Rahm\u00e1n and the other amirs were continually saying to the Sult\u00e1n, \"This Malik [Sulaym\u00e1n] is thy brother, and the King's brother is ever the King's enemy\"; until at length they persuaded him to confine Sulaym\u00e1n to his own apartments. 'Abb\u00e1s came from Ardahan, whither he had fled, to pay homage to the King.\n\nJ\u00e1wal\u00ed, on his return from the pursuit of B\u00faz\u00e1ba, was promised the guardianship (\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0628\u06a9\u06cc) of Maliksh\u00e1h, the King's son by 'Arab Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, whom they accordingly brought from the Castle of Farrazin: a little lower it is written (\u062a\u0631\u0632\u06cc\u0646), whither Malik Sulaym\u00e1n was now sent. The King and his nobles then returned to Hamadh\u00e1n, while J\u00e1wal\u00ed departed into Adharbayj\u00e1n, but when he reached Zanj\u00e1n (\u0632\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0646) he desired to be bled, after which he would\nshoot an arrow, and the strain of this effort burst open the vein so that he died of haemorrhage (f. 98b). After his death the King conferred the guardianship of his son, thus rendered vacant, on the Am\u00edr \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n, together with the governments of Ganja and Arr\u00e1n. \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n, however, despatched his ward the Prince (Maliksh\u00e1h) with some of his nobles to Arr\u00e1n, and himself remained at Court, where he was continually saying to Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad, \u201cB\u00faz\u00e1ba is a deserving servant, and must not be allowed to contract a distaste for your service: suffer me, then, to go and bring him to you.\u201d At length he received permission, and set out for P\u00e1rs to bring back B\u00faz\u00e1ba, while Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad came to Hamadh\u00e1n and thence to Jarb\u00e1dhaq\u00e1n, where he received the homage of B\u00faz\u00e1ba and \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n, who remained drinking and feasting with him for two or three days. After this B\u00faz\u00e1ba and Malik[sh\u00e1h] came to Hamadh\u00e1n by way of K\u00e1bila (\u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0629), while the King travelled thither by another route, and on his arrival gave his daughter Gawhar Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, who had been married to Malik D\u00e1\u2019\u00fad, in marriage to [his nephew] Malik Mu\u1e25ammad, whom he nominated his successor to the crown. With the acquiescence of his chamberlain \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n he then made B\u00faz\u00e1ba his chamberlain and the guardian (at\u00e1bek) of Malik Mu\u1e25ammad, and conferred on him a robe of honour. B\u00faz\u00e1ba made \u2018Abb\u00e1s deputy-chamberlain, that he might remain at Court, and made T\u00e1ju\u2019d-D\u00edn of P\u00e1rs waz\u00edr. The latter set out for P\u00e1rs with Malik Mu\u1e25ammad, and \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n departed to Ganja and Arr\u00e1n, taking with him Shamsu\u2019d-D\u00edn At\u00e1bek Ilduguz, Kh\u00e1\u1e63\u1e63-beg, and Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019d-D\u00edn Qay\u1e63ar, whom, because he mistrusted them, he was unwilling to leave behind him at Court (f. 99a); while the Sult\u00e1n, attended by \u2018Abb\u00e1s and T\u00e1ju\u2019d-D\u00edn, went to Baghdad.\n\nNow the three am\u00edrs who had accompanied \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n had heard the King say, \u201cWhen we get the opportunity, we will not leave alive the enemies of the kingdom,\u201d and they were well aware of the schemes harboured by \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n and B\u00faz\u00e1ba, so, when they were a little beyond Ganja, they slew the former, and Kh\u00e1\u1e63\u1e63-beg assumed the\nguardianship of the Prince. When the news of this murder reached Baghdad, the Sult\u00e1n dismissed Fakhru\u2019d-D\u00edn, the son of \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n, from his post of governor (sha\u1e25na) of that city, but did not otherwise harm him. \u2018Abb\u00e1s, with the connivance of the Caliph al-Muqtad\u00ed, had formed a design to seize the King when he should come to public prayer on the occasion of the \u2018\u012ad or Festival; but on that day, as it chanced, the rain was so heavy that it was impossible to go out of doors, and thus did God protect and preserve Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad from their schemes. A week later, when \u2018Abb\u00e1s was preparing for flight, he was arrested, brought to the palace and beheaded, and his body cast over the garden walls on to the shore of the Tigris; and this happened just one month after the violent death of his fellow-conspirator, \u2018Abdu\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1n. The King then dismissed T\u00e1ju\u2019d-D\u00edn and sent him to P\u00e1rs with a message to B\u00faz\u00e1ba, saying, \u201cYou see what hath befallen your confederates: if you would like to join them, Bismi\u2019ll\u00e1h!\u201d\n\nThen the King made Mu\u2019ayyidu\u2019d-D\u00edn Tughr\u00e1\u2019i prime minister. This was an accomplished as well as a virtuous man, and one day of audience he recited before the King a fine Arabic qas\u00edda of 80 couplets (20 given here) which he had composed, beginning:\n\n\u0646\u064e\u0638\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0637\u0650 \u062d\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064b\u0627\u060c \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0651\u0633\u0650\u064a \u0644\u0650\u0635\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\n\n\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u064a\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628\u0627\u064a\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0645 \u0639\u064a\u0648\u0646\u060c\n\n\u201cIn those days,\u201d says the author (f. 100a), \u201cministers composed such verses as they cannot now even read or recite correctly\u201d; and he adds:\n\n\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0627 \u062c\u06af\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0647\u0631\u06a9\u0647 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632\u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u0634 \u0622\u0648\u06cc\u0632\u062a\u0633\u0631\n\n\u0648 \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u06cc\u0632\u062a\u0631 \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0648\u062f\u060c\n\nWhen T\u00e1ju\u2019d-D\u00edn reached P\u00e1rs and communicated the news to B\u00faz\u00e1ba, the latter collected an army and brought Malik Mu\u1e25ammad and Maliksh\u00e1h to I\u1e63fah\u00e1n, where the governor Ghalabak (\u063a\u0644\u0627\u0628\u06a9, Bund\u0101r\u012b, pp. 193, 202) waited\nupon him. B\u00faz\u00e1ba then proclaimed Malik Mu\u1e25ammad king, and caused the five blasts of trumpets to be sounded in his honour (\u0646\u06cc\u062c \u0646\u0648\u0628\u062a \u0628\u0646). Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad, on learning this, hastened to Hamadh\u00e1n from Baghdad with the small army which he had at hand, and thence sent messages to Kha\u1e63\u1e63-beg bidding him hasten to his support with reinforcements from Arr\u00e1n, and to the At\u00e1bek Y\u0131lduguz and the Am\u00edr \u015eirgir (brother of Arsl\u00e1n A\u02bfba) to assemble the army of Adharbayj\u00e1n. Fortunately for the King, B\u00faz\u00e1ba loitered on his march from I\u1e63fah\u00e1n, and when he reached G\u00far\u00e1b the armies of Arr\u00e1n and Adharbayj\u00e1n had already arrived at Hamadh\u00e1n, and, by the King\u2019s directions, were encamped in the Mayd\u00e1n-i-D\u012bh-i-Piy\u00e1z (\u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u0647 \u067e\u06cc\u0627\u0632), whence next day they marched to Murghz\u00e1r-i-Qar\u00e1tag\u00edn, where B\u00faz\u00e1ba came to meet them at the village of Kihr\u00e1n. A fierce fight ensued, which ended in the defeat of B\u00faz\u00e1ba and his capture at the hands of a black named Rustam, formerly one of his servants, but at this time in the service of \u1e24asan the j\u00e1nd\u00e1r (f. 101a). The King gave his sword into the hands of Kha\u1e63\u1e63-beg, who hewed B\u00faz\u00e1ba in twain; and his head was sent to Baghdad and there set up over the palace of the Caliph al-Muqtafi. Malik Mu\u1e25ammad and Maliksh\u00e1h returned to P\u00e1rs and the King to Hamadh\u00e1n, to the Ku\u015fhk-i-kuhan or \u201cOld Summerhouse.\u201d This happened in a.h. 541 (= a.d. 1146\u20137).\n\nThe King spent that winter at S\u00e1wa, whence he went to Adharbayj\u00e1n, and so returned, towards the end of the summer, to Hamadh\u00e1n. In the year a.h. 543, in the month of Sha\u02bfb\u00e1n (= December, a.d. 1148), when winter was at hand, he set out for Baghdad, but first, against the advice of Kh\u00e1\u1e63\u1e63-beg, waited on his uncle (Sinjar) at Ray, where the two rulers remained eighteen days ere they separated, the one to Baghdad, the other to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n.\u00b9 In \u1e62afar, a.h. 544 (= June\u2013July, a.d. 1149), Sult\u00e1n Mas\u2018\u00fad returned from Baghdad to Hamadh\u00e1n.\u2014Malik Mu\u1e25ammad b.

Mu\u1e25ammad Yaminu Amiri'l-M\u00faminin. He was fond of wine and devoted to the chase. His taq\u00ed', or motto, was \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0646\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647. His prime minister was Shamsu'd-D\u00edn Ab\u00fa'n-Naj\u00edb. His chamberlain was Kh\u00e1s\u1e63-beg. He lived 32 years and 2 months, and reigned four months after the death of [his uncle] Sult\u00e1n Mas\u00fad, and once previously to that event for sixteen days at I\u1e63fah\u00e1n (see pp. 867\u20138 supra). He succeeded to the throne in Rajab, A.H. 547 (= October, A.D. 1152), on the death of Mas\u00fad, his uncle; and was deposed in Shaww\u00e1l of the same year (= January, A.D. 1153). His deposition was brought about by his dissolute habits and fondness for low company, especially by his infatuation for a woman\nnamed Jam\u00e1l. Here is cited (f. 105) a qasida of 36 couplets composed in his praise by Sayyid-i-Ashraf.\n\nKh\u00e1s-beg was the prime mover in the King's deposition, for, being suspicious of his master's intentions, \"he break-fasted off him ere he could sup\":\n\nSo he agreed with \u1e24asan the j\u00e1nd\u00e1r that the King should be invited by the latter to his house, where, on his arrival, he was detained with the woman Jam\u00e1l and three or four attendants, while messengers were despatched to fetch his brother Mu\u1e25ammad from Khuzist\u00e1n. On his arrival this Prince was crowned in the summer-house (\u06a9\u0648\u0634\u06a9) of Hamadh\u00e1n, where the deposed ruler was kept a prisoner for fifteen days, when he succeeded in letting himself down over the walls by means of a rope and effecting his escape to Kh\u00fazist\u00e1n,\u00b9 where he remained during his brother's reign, supplied with money and news by his sister Gawhar-nasab. He made an attempt to recover the crown from his brother, but his troops were defeated and dispersed by the At\u00e1bek Ay\u00e1z. Later, when his brother Mu\u1e25ammad died and his uncle Sulaym\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h was crowned at Hamadh\u00e1n, he hurried to I\u1e63fah\u00e1n and proclaimed himself king, but died fifteen days later without having effected anything.\n\n12.

On Chess and the different forms of the game.\n\nHistory of the introduction of Chess from India into Persia, where one new variety (\u0628\u0627\u0628) of the game was invented; and thence into the Byzantine Empire (\u0631\u0648\u0645), where two more varieties were evolved, making four in all. These four games are described with illustrations which sufficiently explain the arrangement of the pieces.\n\n(a) The original Indian game.\n\nThis appears to be identical with the game now played in Europe with 32 pieces on a square board containing $8 \\times 8 = 64$ squares. The pieces bear their usual Persian names: the 16 pawns (\u067e\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u0647, piy\u00e1da) in the advanced line on each side; and in the hinder line on each side, from without inwards, the two castles (\u0631\u062e, rukh); the two knights or 'horses' (\u0641\u0631\u0633, faras, or \u0627\u0633\u0628, asp); the two bishops or 'elephants' (\u0641\u064a\u0644, fil, or \u067e\u064a\u0644, pil); and in the middle the king (\u0634\u0627\u0647, sh\u00e1h) and the queen or 'minister' (\u0641\u0627\u0632\u064a\u0646, farzin).\n\n(b) The Persian variety, invented by Buzurjmihir.\n\nIn this game the board is no longer square; it still contains 64 squares, but they are arranged in 4 rows of 16 each, as follows:\n\n| R | P | P |\n|---|---|---|\n| Q | Kn. | B |\n| K | Kn. | B |\n| R | P | P |\n\nP = Pawn.\nR = Rook, or Castle.\nKn. = Knight, or 'Horse.'\nB = Bishop, or 'Elephant.'\nK = King.\nQ = Queen.\n(c) The first Byzantine variation.\n\nHere the board is circular, consisting of 5 concentric circles, of which the innermost is called 'the Citadel' (\u062d\u0635\u0646, hisn), intersected between the circumferences of the innermost and the outermost circles by 16 radiating lines. It thus contains, besides the central 'Citadel,' $4 \\times 16 = 64$ compartments or 'squares,' on which the pieces are thus arranged:\n\n(d) The second Byzantine variation.\n\nThis game is played with 40 pieces (the additional 8 consisting of 4 extra pawns and 4 new pieces called 'lions,' \u0623\u0633\u062f, asad) on a board of $12 \\times 12 = 144$ squares, of which the outer rows are vacant at the beginning of the game, while the four corner squares are 'citadels' (\u062d\u0635\u0646 or \u062d\u0635\u0646 or hisn or hasin).\nThe ancient game of Chess (f. 160) was originally invented in India by a wise man named \u0633\u06cc\u0628\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a (Sisba, or Sasba, son of B\u00e2hir, the Indian). The Caliph al-Ma'm\u00fbn (ninth century of our era) preferred draughts to chess, because in the former game he could, if vanquished, blame the dice and not himself; but the S\u00e2s\u00e2nian king Khusraw Parw\u00eez (sixth and seventh centuries of our era) would only play chess.\u2014Arabic verses on chess by Ibnu'r-R\u00fbm\u00ee (A.D. 836-896).\n\nAt this point, as I think, should be placed a passage occurring on f. 154a, wherein the author, after eulogizing his patron, Abu'l-Fath Kay-Khusraw, exhorts him to play chess, but not for stakes, \"so that his prayers may not be nullified\" by his indulgence in games which involve the use of the unlawful dice-box, like draughts:\n\n.. \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0637\u0631\u0646\u062c \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0637 \u062c\u0648\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u062f\u0639\u0627\u06af\u0648\u06cc \u0647\u0631\u06af\u0632 \u0628\u06af\u0631\u0648 \u0646\u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u062a\u0627 \u0642\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u062a \u0634\u0631\u0639 \u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645 \u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u06a9\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u062f \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u0633\u0628 \u0634\u0637\u0631\u0646\u062c \u0646\u0645\u0627\u0632 \u0641\u0648\u062a \u0646\u0634\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0641\u0633\u062f\u062a \u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0635\u0644\u062d\u062a \u0628\u062c\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u060c\n18.

XXVIII.\u2014The Author of the Life of Sh\u0101h Isma'il \u0160afav\u012b. By H. BEVERIDGE.\n\nSince writing the letter on this subject which appears in the January number of the J.R.A.S. I have examined the British Museum MS. Or. 3,248 more carefully, and have obtained a clue to its authorship. Dr. Rieu and Professor Denison Ross considered the work to be anonymous, and regarded the name at the end\u2014Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b, son of N\u016bra\u2014as being probably that of the owner or copyist. I am inclined to think that it is the name of the author, and that the work is more recent and less valuable than has hitherto been supposed. No doubt the writer has used some old records, and it would appear from a marginal note that a manuscript called the Qissa \u0160afav\u012b, and which seems to have been lost, was the basis of the work. It is also likely that he used the T\u0101r\u012bkh \u0160\u0101hi of Abdullah Marw\u0101rid, but I think that Or. 3,248 cannot have been put together earlier than the first half of the seventeenth century. We know from Mr. Denison Ross's paper in the J.R.A.S. for April, 1896, that the work must have been composed, in whole or in part, after 946 A.H. (or 1539), as it records the death of Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n Mirz\u0101, which occurred in that year during the flight after Hum\u0101y\u016bn's defeat at Caus\u0101 by Sher Sh\u0101h. But there are two marginal notes in the manuscript which have hitherto escaped notice, and which show, I think, that the work must have been written at a still later period, and also that the author did not expect or intend that he should remain anonymous. These notes are not perfectly intelligible, for the margins have been clipped in binding (before the MS. came into the Museum), and consequently some important words are missing, but their general purport can be understood.\nThe first note occurs on the margin of p. 82a and refers to an embassy undertaken by Qambar \u2018Ali, the lala or guardian of Sh\u0101h Isma\u2018il, to Sultan Mur\u0101d at his Court in Shir\u0101z. Sultan Mur\u0101d was the cousin of Elwand Sh\u0101h, with whom Isma\u2018il was at war, and he was the grandson of Uzan Hasan, the king of the White Sheep. As Isma\u2018il\u2019s mother was a daughter of Uzan Hasan (her mother Martha is said to have been a Christian and was the daughter of the King of Trebizond), Mur\u0101d and Isma\u2018il were also related. Isma\u2018il wrote a letter to Mur\u0101d warning him against joining Elwand Sh\u0101h, and Qambar \u2018Ali, who was an old servant of the Safav\u012b family and seventy years of age, volunteered to convey the letter and also to expostulate with Sultan Mur\u0101d. His embassy and his discussion with Mur\u0101d are related at some length in the manuscript, and then we have the marginal note, of which the translation is as follows:\n\n\u201cLet it not be concealed that the contents of the letter which the \u0100q\u0101 conveyed and his discussion with Sultan (fault, but no doubt Mur\u0101d should be read) are by this humble individual, and are not in the Qissa \u0160af(avi?). The contents of the letter are taken from the loose (or perhaps unauthentic, the Persian being \u0101z\u0101n nas\u1e2ba n\u0101 marb\u016b\u1e6d) which (fault1) had brought. As by the desire of Khusr\u016b \u0100q\u0101, captain of the bodyguard of Kh. (Y\u016bzb\u0101sh\u012b Ghul\u0101m\u0101n Kh.), who was the originator of the completed (?) book (Sark\u0101r-i-tal\u012bf raba\u1e6d kit\u0101br\u0101), several things were inserted in consideration of that book,2 so this humble individual has in some places entered them in this work. Consequently readers will understand the cause of the divergences from the noble book (qu. the Qissa \u0160afav\u012b).\u201d\n\nThe story of the embassy is carried on to 83b, and there we have the following brief note: \u201cThis passage too is by the humble individual.\u201d Apparently these words refer to the part of the narrative which describes Qambar \u2018Ali\u2019s return from Sultan Mur\u0101d\u2019s court. There is here a remarkable difference between Or. 3,248, and the manuscript life of Sh\u0101h\n\n1 The letter Kh remains, and perhaps it is the first letter of the name Khusr\u016b \u0100q\u0101.\n2 The loose or unauthentic book?\nIsma'il in the India Office. The passage in the latter which describes the embassy of Qambar \u2018Ali is at pp. 43a\u201345b, and it has many points of similarity with the account in Or. 3,248. But at p. 45b it is stated that Qambar \u2018Al\u012b was put to death by Mur\u0101d for his boldness of speech, whereas Or. 3,248 describes him as returning and giving Isma\u2019il an account of his treatment. See also p. 52c of the India Office MS., where Isma\u2019il tells his aunt Khadija Begam, who was a daughter of Uzan \u1e24asan, and consequently also an aunt of Mur\u0101d, that he had sworn to put Mur\u0101d to death as a punishment for his having killed Qambar \u2018Al\u012b.\n\nThe next marginal note is at p. 228b, and refers to the description in the text of Sh\u0101h Isma\u2019il\u2019s battle with Ab\u016bl Khair Kh\u0101n, son of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, the ruler of Dasht Qipcaq. The text gives a detailed account of the engagement, and describes how Isma\u2019il slew Ab\u016bl Khair in single combat by cleaving him to the waist. P. 232a also gives a picture of this, in which we see Ab\u016bl Khair holding his shield in front of his face, and Isma\u2019il\u2019s sword cutting through shield, head, and waist.\n\nThe translation of the note is as follows:\n\n\u201cLet it not be concealed that the story of Ab\u016bl Khair Kh\u0101n of Qipcaq, who had died in the year (fault, but presumably hasht) 873, and the description of his having been (fault, qu. killed) by Hazrat Sh\u0101h (i.e. H.M. Isma\u2019il Sh\u0101h), and (this account) of one who had been dead two and forty years has not been found in any chronicle which this humble individual has seen. It has been written at the desire of his master\u00b9 (aq\u0101y\u0101n) and grandfather, the noble Naw\u0101b Aq\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Razi Beg (unintelligible, qu. may God cast his shadow over him?). The account is without foundation (or perhaps is not in the original work). Accordingly he begs that the masters of learning and knowledge will not suspect this humble one of being a liar. God knows what the real truth is.\u201d\n\nThis note shows that it is the author and not the copyist who is writing, and also that he intended or expected to be\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps it should be \u2018the Aq\u0101y\u0101n,\u2019 meaning his relatives or friends of that name and of his grandfather. Aq\u0101y\u0101n appears to be the title of a family or clan.\nknown as the author. Else why should he, if he was anonymous, be anxious to free himself from responsibility? I therefore think that the name Muhammad \u2018Ali, son of Nur\u0101, at the end of the manuscript is that of the author. It appears also that whether the writer of the note is right or wrong in doubting the story, he has expressed himself rather carelessly, for he has confounded Ab\u016bl Khair, the grandfather of Shaib\u0101n\u012b and the son of Daulat Shaikh Oghl\u0101n (Howorth, part ii, p. 686), with the Ab\u016bl Khair of the text, who is there described as the son of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n. Ab\u016bl Khair, the grandfather of Shaib\u0101n\u012b, died in 874 (1469), and so I suppose is the person referred to in the note, though the addition of 42 years will not produce the apparent date of Isma\u2018il\u2019s battle. The battle is represented as occurring after Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s death in 916 and after the death of Najm \u1e62\u0101n\u012b, and so cannot have occurred before 918. Possibly the 3 of 873 of the note should be read as 9, there being no dots, which would give 921 as the date, but then this would make the date of the death of Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s grandfather to be incorrect. In the text I think there is nothing to show the exact year in which the battle is alleged to have occurred. The story of Isma\u2018il\u2019s killing Ab\u016bl Khair is also told, and with still greater detail, in the India Office Manuscript. It also gives a picturesque account of the visit of the Uzbeg Chief J\u0101n\u012b Beg Sul\u1e6d\u0101n to Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n in order to induce him to assist the Uzbegs against Isma\u2018il. We are told (p. 231a) that Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n was then holding his court in \u012al\u0101q (?), and that when he received J\u0101n\u012b Beg he was seated on the golden throne of Cingiz Kh\u0101n. He was then an old man, and was remarkable for having three long hairs hanging down from his chin, two descending to his shoulders, while the third and middle one reached to his navel. This, we are told, proved him to be a lineal descendant of Cingiz Kh\u0101n, and secured to him the reverence of every man in the Qipc\u0101q Steppe. His son Ab\u016bl Khair\n\n1 Perhaps it only means summer quarters.\n2 He traced his descent from J\u016bj\u012b, who was the eldest son of Cingiz.\nwas seated beside him, and was about thirty years of age. Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n is also mentioned at p. 112\u00b0 of the India Office MS. as sending 12,000 men to Shaib\u0101n\u012b to help him in taking Samarkand. No doubt he is meant to be the Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n of the White Horde, who was the son of Ab\u016b S\u0101id surnamed J\u0101m\u012b Beg, and of whom there is an account in Howorth, part ii, pp. 629\u201331 and p. 715. He is also mentioned several times by \u1e24aidar M\u012brz\u0101 in the T\u0101r\u012bkh Rash\u012bd\u012b, translation by Denison Ross, pp. 82 and 273. He is also mentioned by Ab\u016bl Gh\u0101z\u012b, Des Maisons\u2019 translation, p. 188, and in B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs, Erskine, 14. But nothing is said in any of these works about his having a son called Ab\u016bl Khair. \u1e24aidar M\u012brz\u0101 describes him as having made war on the Uzbegs, and not as helping them, and he says he was succeeded by his son Mum\u0101sh and afterwards by his nephew T\u0101hir. To the same effect is Ab\u016bl Gh\u0101z\u012b\u2019s remark that Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n fought with Shaib\u0101n\u012b and was the cause of his death. This must mean, I think, that Shaib\u0101n\u012b was so weakened by his unsuccessful expedition against Q\u0101sim (also described by \u1e24aidar) that he fell an easy prey to Isma\u02bf\u012bl.\n\nI have found nothing about Ab\u016bl Khair, the son of Q\u0101sim, in the \u1e24ab\u012bb-as-siyar, nor in the history by Khwandam\u012br\u2019s son Mahm\u016bd, and we have the authority of the writer of the marginal note for the statement that it does not occur in any chronicle. I therefore think it must be a fiction, like many other statements in the book.\n\nThough the marginal note on p. 228a does not tell us the author\u2019s name, it gives the name of his grandfather, viz. Muhammad Razi Beg. Now there was a Muhammad Razi Beg who went as ambassador to India, and who is described at p. 506a of the B.M. MS. of the \u2018\u0100lam \u0100r\u0101i \u2018Abb\u0101si, Or. 152. He was head of the torchbearers, went on an embassy to Jah\u0101ng\u012br, and died at Lahore in 1026 A.H. (or 1616) as he was returning to Persia. If this was the author\u2019s grandfather the book was probably written after 1616, for it is not likely that the note would be made during the grandfather\u2019s lifetime. The Kh. which occurs on the note at p. 82 after Ghul\u0101m\u0101n is probably the beginning of the\nwords Khud\u0101banda Mirz\u0101, i.e. of Tahm\u0101sp\u2019s eldest son, who reigned for about nine years, viz. from 985 to 994 (=1577\u201386). The Khusr\u016b \u0100q\u0101 of the same note is probably identical with the Khusr\u016b Beg who is mentioned in the \u2018\u0100lam \u0100r\u0101i (B.M. Or. 152, p. 187a, nine lines from foot, and p. 188a, top line) as a leader of the ghul\u0101ms or bodyguard at Ispahan. It appears from the account there given that Khusr\u016b Beg at first refused to submit to \u2018Abb\u0101s Sh\u0101h, and took possession of the fort of Ispahan. Afterwards he and his men came to terms and submitted. This occurrence apparently took place about 994 (or 1586). As Khusr\u016b is described as being the editor or originator of the book, i.e. either Or. 3,248 or its predecessor, the latter cannot be so early as has been supposed.\n\nThe India Office MS. life of Isma\u2018\u012bl\u00b2 is numbered 536, and is described at p. 213 of Dr. Eth\u00e9\u2019s Catalogue. It is, to my thinking, an older and more valuable recension than Or. 3,248, but many pages are identical in both manuscripts. Evidently it has been compiled from the same original. A page of the MS. has been misplaced, for what is marked 312a and placed at the end of the MS. should be reversed and placed at the beginning, the top of p. 312b corresponding to the third line from the foot of p. 2b of Or. 3,248. Similarly 312a corresponds to 3a of Or. 3,248. The story of \u1e24aidar\u2019s dream and the introduction of the \u1e62afav\u012b cap is similarly told in both MSS., p. 15b of the I.O. MS. corresponding to 20b of Or. 3,248. So also 33a of the I.O. MS. corresponds to line 5 of 50b of Or. 3,248. But the I.O. MS. is the more gossipy of the two, and gives details about Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain Baiqara, Shaib\u0101n\u012b, etc. Thus, at 126a it has a long story of how \u1e24usain Baiqara\u2019s daughter, Jahan Sh\u0101h Begam, came to marry a divinity student. It has also many details about Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s marriage with the mother of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b of Samarkand, and says\n\n\u00b9 It occurred shortly after the assassination of Khud\u0101banda\u2019s capable son Hamsa Mirz\u0101 had made the former\u2019s position hopeless.\n\u00b2 The history ends with the accession of Tahm\u0101sp, but a chronological table at the end, and in the same handwriting as the rest of the MS., goes down to 1015, and then breaks off owing to there being a page or pages missing.\nthat she was afterwards stabbed by Shaib\u0101n\u012b's other wife. It is probably, however, all apocryphal, for B\u0101bar does not mention the circumstance, and the name of Sult\u0101n 'Ali's mother is wrongly given. It also (p. 226*) gives an extraordinary and, I should think, a totally false account of how B\u0101bar appeared before Isma'il at His\u0101r Sh\u0101dm\u0101n with a sword and quiver tied round his neck and humbly begged forgiveness for having deserted Najm \u0160\u0101n\u012b at the battle of Ghajdiw\u0101n! Evidently this MS. has been written by a bigoted Shi'a, and the writer has chosen his materials from some hagiographer of Sh\u0101h Isma'il.\n\nThere was also a copy of a life of Isma'il in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, but the latter is now in the possession of Mrs. Rylands, and the MS. is not yet accessible. There is another copy at Cambridge, and it has been described by Mr. Browne.\nART. XXIX.\u2014Zarathushtra and Heraclitus. By Professor Lawrence Mills.\n\nBefore the L\u00f3gos of Heraclitus, as is usual in the cases of all originators, the thing 'originated' was already present in its germ for his use in the half-formed surmises of his predecessors.\n\nFor it was none other than Hesiod who used a word and expressed an idea which, together with the hints of other schemes, led up to the early concept. The first Greek naturalists believed, indeed, in an original substance of the universe, out of which everything arose and in which everything consisted; they also attributed to it life and motion, and gave it different names. One thought it was 'water.' Another called it the infinite (sic), as undefined substance matter. At other times they thought it was 'air.'\n\nParmenides had spoken of trusting only the L\u00f3gos, that is to say, 'reason,' while distrusting the senses, imagination, etc. But this does not seem in itself to possess much speculative importance. He reduced everything to one in his philosophy, and denied development. He did not like the idea of motion, and had no conception of the consciousness of the L\u00f3gos; nor had Heraclitus this latter, for the matter of that. Parmenides' natural philosophy was so bad that he believed in the 'stationary character of all things'; and he earned the name of 'no-naturalist,' \u1f00\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, from Aristotle. We have no analogy with either Asha or Vohumanah here.\n\n1 Op. 692, \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, 718: \"the abundant loveliness of the tongue that moves in rhythmic order.\"\n2 Cf. the Avesta conception of infinite time.\n3 Flourished in the 69th Olympiade, 504\u2013500 B.C.\n4 See Heinze, p. 59, and Zeller, pt. i, pp. 553\u2013584.\nIt was the keen discriminator of Ephesus who first saw a certain something imperative, not to say imperious, in the rhythm of nature, of its motions, and of its developments. I say of this great generalizer; for we must concede him that title however much we may differ from his ultimate conclusions.\n\nHeraclitus did not indeed definitely resolve those secrets which the labours of all these centuries have only just succeeded in discovering, or rediscovering, but he came so near to this that we may fairly say that if he had possessed one fraction of the data which we now have, he would have surpassed most of us of these latter days in the depth of his intuition and in the keenness of his discrimination, for he seems to have surmised what we now know to be the true definition of heat, 'an everliving fire,' 'kindling with regularity, burning out with regularity'; cf. the \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 of Hesiod.\n\n\"The sun shall never pass his measure, for did he do so, the night goddesses, aid of justice, would find him out\" (cf. Plut. de exil., ii, 604, B.). We do not distinctly gather that he held to any unchangeable underlying substance of phenomena. All is 'becoming' with him. But surely one would think he must have seen that an eternal substance was necessary, the everlasting changing of the forms of which constitute perhaps existence, certainly 'creation' and 'events.' The one underlying substance which exists according to his ideas was what he called 'fire.' We should call it 'heat,' the eternal perpetual motion, that is to say, its mode. Nature moves in so far as it is subjected to, or better, in so far as it possesses 'caloric' (sic), from the slowly dissolving ice to the electricity of the atmosphere; and the march of nature is rhythmic; it has reason; for all\n\n1 Died about 470-478 B.C.

Patrick, \"Heraklitus,\" Baltimore, 1889, etc.\nthings adapt themselves each to the other and fall into their places; and out of the clash of seeming discord life, with all its developments, mental, emotional, and moral, arises; there was reason in it, if not a 'reasoner.' He called that reason 'l\u00f3gos' (here in this application), meaning more 'a sentence' than 'mere speech.' And for this discovery or recognition a great Church father reckoned him among the fold of Christians before Christ; \"they who live according to, or 'with' the l\u00f3gos, are,\" said Justin, \"Christians, even if they were thought atheists; and such were Socrates, Heraclitus, and the like and among the Greeks.\"\u00b9\n\nAn incongruous grouping indeed, we should say, but one which perhaps shows the power of the L\u00f3gos all the more. The moral order of the life of Heraclitus was thought of, but it was his theory which was the occasion of the remark. The idea of reason as inherent in nature dominated his philosophy. That philosophy indeed impresses us with its 'one' arising from two opposites, while the opposites become knowable only after the splitting of the unit into two.\n\nIt was hardly, however, as some think,\u00b2 the march of motion by the sublated negation which Fichte and Hegel most prominently revived and elaborated.\u00b3 It was, moreover, wholly materialistic, let it be noted well. Although, as in the case of every similar supposition, we may always understand 'materialism' in a certain deeper and sublimer sense.\u2074 For matter must have been regarded by Heraclitus as a thing which contains within its potentiality all that we know of mind or morals. The L\u00f3gos of Heraclitus is the eternal law of motion in the strife of contending elements; that is to say, in the embrace of opposites, 'splitting all things,' but putting the split together, and again the split,\n\n\u00b9 See Justin Martyr, Apol., i, 85.\n\u00b2 See Lassalle.\n\u00b3 Recall Hegel's remark to the effect \"that there is no sentence of Heraclitus which he had not embodied in his Logik\"; see Patrick upon this.\n\u2074 The word naturally grates upon our ears and upon our feelings. But, after all, not a single item in the myriad experiences of sentiment is denied by any of the so-called materialists. All must concede that if everything is material, then material also is everything, honour, mercy, devotion, everything arises from it, and intellect the first of all.\n\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f44\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b7\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 (see Philo qu. rer. div. her., 1,505 f.). \"By strife alone life becomes possible, disease makes health good and pleasant. There is no harmony without the height and the depth (sic) (the 'flat and the sharp'), and no peace without war.\"\n\nAnd this creative, all-moving 'war' in nature was again the 'L\u00f3gos' under a different name and from another point of view. The L\u00f3gos is also 'fate,' not a blind fate by any manner of means. Fate as the L\u00f3gos was the Creator (sic) of all things, from the running together or conflict of opposites.\n\nJustice is also war, and war is universal, everything takes place with strife. The just, or more properly the exact, is the cause and result of fire (i.e. heat) which is immanent; that is to say, permanently dwelling in the universe of nature; for this 'heat' has its law according to which it unfolds and again folds up the world; that law is its rhythmic reason, or L\u00f3gos. It is conceived of as material, as I have said, and the fire filled with spirit is another representation of the same L\u00f3gos. This L\u00f3gos is one and the same world-forming element as fire (i.e. heat), but viewed from different sides. The L\u00f3gos is as little immaterial as fire. It is material; but then, as before said, matter must have been conceived of in a sense which has made it all inclusive, the sum-total, of universal subjective experience. And he called this comprehensive concept 'L\u00f3gos,' this being the first extended use of the term in this sense by a philosophical teacher in the history of Greek literature. Sextus Empiricus, in his work Adversus math., vii, 2, ff. 5, 397 ff., quoted by Zeller and Heinze, speaks of this L\u00f3gos as the 'divine l\u00f3gos' (see H., p. 44), but he hardly meant to report the expression as having been used by Heraclitus; the \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd are probably due solely to Sextus himself. And with all of this his L\u00f3gos was 'unconscious.' Such was most probably his opinion; and possibly Von Hartmann started from some such hint.\n\nIt, the L\u00f3gos, was a reasonable force which inheres in the substance-matter of the world. There is nothing material without it. It has no pre-existence, except as all things pre-exist in their predecessors, of which they really form\na continuous part. It rules all things, and domineers over the realm of intellect and morality, eliminating all independence from each of them. Such was, in a few words, the scheme, perhaps a little too much portrayed in the sense of Hegel by Zeller, and too much in the sense of mere 'nature' by the other extremists.\n\nOn the fascinating depths of it, with all its errors or its truth, we may not dwell, and in fact I make the above remarks (only) with reserve. But to one habituated to such investigation the gist of the matter is clear at once. We have an astonishing and a pregnant scheme, strangely deep, yet strangely material. And this is the L\u00f3gos which is supposed by some to have been the ancestor of Vohumanah or of Asha. We need hardly have waited for a full discussion of it before we decided whether such a L\u00f3gos was likely to have been their progenitor or not. In some respects, indeed, both Asha and Vohumanah might have been proud of the connection; but that is not our point just here. A radical historical connection of the nature of that between cause and effect is here not to be thought of.\n\nIt is in the sphere of purely mental and, as we may also say, of moral action that, strange as it may appear, we find one delicate item of analogy, though I fear my readers will term it rather too far-fetched. Yet I present it for what it may be worth. As we find in the fragments of Heraclitus the first statement of a self-moving reasonable or reasoning force, so it is in the Avesta that we have, of all possible lores, the first record of the soul's moral self-motion, if I might be permitted to make use of such a form of words,\u2014a pulse of spiritual progress in the thought, in the word, and in the deed, from their inception in the first consciousness of a living subject to their consequences, felicitous or calamitous, first in the future of the present life, and then in a scene beyond it. For these states of moral habit seem actually to be continued on of themselves, not merely as the\n\n1 Surely the progress of development by the supercession of ideas through their opposites applies to natural phenomena as well as to ideas. In so far Hegel most certainly was right in speaking of Heraclitus as he did.\noccasions, but also as the constitutive elements of their own rewards or punishments in the present and in the future state. In Y. 30, 4, 'the worst mind' seems really to be put into the place of the 'worst fate'; while the 'best mind' is 'heaven,' the passage having been beyond a doubt one of the sources, and perhaps the oldest surviving one, of the use of the word 'best' (vahisht) among the Persians for 'heaven.' And distinct departments in the future spiritual home-life had the very words 'good thought,' 'good word,' and 'good deed' for their names. It is the sinner's own conscience which shrieks at him on the Judgment Bridge (see Y. 46); and it is his own good thoughts, words, and deeds which meet him and conduct him to his final happy destiny. Whether our full modern idea was really intended\u2014I mean, of course, the idea that \"virtue is its own reward\"\u2014we may indeed doubt.\n\nZarathushtra would possibly have thought it too extreme a conception to be at all practicable or indeed safe; regarding it as dangerously refined and calculated to suspend all wholesome fear in inferior minds; but that it occurred to him, dimly at least and as if only to be instantly rejected, seems clear. At all events we have here a positively certain case where ideas, like events, cast their shadows before. These remarkable suggestions were the first of their kind, so far as I am aware, in the entire history of speculation, the incipient glimmering of the noblest idea that has ever emerged from the consciousness of man. And the analogy which I would draw is this; and I confess it is an exceedingly subtle one, and only thrown in for a very esoteric circle.\n\nAs Heraclitus was the first to formulate for us the idea of self-motion in the universe of nature physical, but as including more dimly the intellectual and moral world, so Zarathushtra gave us the first hint to our common, but so beautiful modern proverb, the idea of a sort of self-motion of moral economics or in the forces which control them. This, however, is the mere phantom of an analogy, striking though\n\n1 See Yt. 22, Westergaard.\nit be so far as it extends. It is indeed a likeness 'in the air'; and it is mentioned as an interlude and as if in a parenthesis alone.\n\nBut aside from anything like this, to those who study the history of the idea of the Zarathushtrian asha, a certain general analogy with the L\u00f3gos of Heraclitus, when also more closely understood, becomes perceptible. The idea, like its Indian counterpart rit\u00e1, arose from the observed regularity of natural phenomena\u2014the rising, course, decline, and disappearance of the sun and other heavenly bodies, the succession of the seasons, etc. These became imitated in the ceremonies of religious worship, and the priestly officials were termed the rtavan and the ashavan; and there, indeed, we have what reminds us of the L\u00f3gos of Heraclitus in so far as it is likewise a 'rhythm.'\n\nBut as to what the rhythm of material nature actually was, the systems were poles apart. As Zeller himself admits, Heraclitus must have been somewhat aware of the nature of the widespread mazda-worship with which his successors were so familiar. For the Persian forces which looked to Auramazda for victory and hated Angra Mainyu as the author of defeat, surged for years up to the very gates of Ephesus when Heraclitus was in his prime. If he was even invited, as was believed by some, to the Court of Darius, then the false letters are the graphic echoes of the fact. It is therefore very probable indeed, that the stories of the two originally antagonistic divinities of the Persian creed assisted those early impulses which impelled this man of genius as he proceeded to improve still more upon the simple downright statements of the Zoroastrian oracle; but this is only possible.\n\nThe Zoroastrian dualism, only by a very wide inference, bears any marked likeness to its successor; while on the other hand, no one of the known Greek ancients, so far as I am aware, had any conceivably immediate influence upon the plain though grander theory of Zarathushtra.\n\n1 Properly, as I would suggest, arshavan.\nWith Zarathushtra opposition and war were indeed in the nature of things, for there were 'two original spirits'; this was the foundation of his views. But we find no emphatic suggestion with him that this was in any sense ordained for good.\\(^1\\) According to some passages the \"evil are to lie forever in hell.\" If this, however, is to be modified by Yasna 30, 12, \"Upon this shall there be salvation\" (\\textit{usht\u0101},\\(^2\\) the beatific state), then we have indeed a happy result; but there is no statement anywhere to the effect that the strife in nature was conducive to better things even when regarded as an educator. Nor, in fact, is there any precise statements as to physical nature which are so conspicuous with the Ephesian.\n\nUndoubtedly antithesis is the keynote of Zarathushtrianism. Even in the G\u0101thas we have conspicuously the beginning of the pairing. Opposite Ahura Mazda stands Angra Mainyu, the most formidable devil ever developed, actually the maker of one of the two opposing worlds. Opposite Asha, the regularity and truth, we have the Druj, the falsehood in the foe; opposite vohu manah we have aka manah; opposite vahista manah, achishta manah; opposite Khshathra, the dush-khshathra; opposite Aramaiti, taramaiti; opposite Haurvatat and Ameretat\u0101t we have descriptions of woe, as Garodman, heaven, is in the face of the Drujodman, hell; while the eternal antipathetic antagonism between these forces is well expressed in the mutual repudiations of Yasna 45, 2. In the later Avesta and in the later Persian they become still more completely paired, and in the G\u0101thas this conflict seems to have become accentuated by the miseries of warfare, that is to say, if 'the woes of the Kine' were the echo of those of the people. If opposition of powers were the only points at issue, then the two systems were indeed related, and the dualism of Zarathushtra was only repeated in the 'war' of Heraclitus.\n\n\\(^1\\) Here Zeller is correct, though his source of information was at that time naturally so imperfect and now completely antiquated.\n\n\\(^2\\) Really in form adverbial.\nBeyond this point, however, Heraclitus must have made great strides in a definitive philosophical sense. It is profoundly to be regretted that we possess such scanty remains of what he wrote or said. They do not occupy much more space than one of the longer G\u0101thas, and not as much as some two of them together. Heraclitus made this opposition, which Zarathushtrianism also so fully delineates, to be the constitutive law out of which all existing things alone arise, while Zarathushtra only does this by inference, if at all. Here, however, we are not concerned with inferences.\n\nZarathushtra showed the grouping faculty in a remarkable degree, and that compact hard reason which recognized even an horrific fact and an horrific being. He went no half way with his Satan. Heraclitus, however, went even beyond these views, and claimed the terrific in life to be not only its reality, but the source of its vitality. Zarathushtra worked out a clear polarization of all the good and evil elements in preceding systems, if systems they could in any sense be called.\n\nOut of all the gods he grouped all the chief abstracts deified into one small company, even resolving seven of them into one, as Sabellius formed his Trinity. And he grouped all the evil into equally limited masses, and there he left them to fight out their battle in the awful encounters of human and superhuman existence; but Heraclitus quarrelled even with Homer because he seemed to disapprove too much of strife.\n\nThere was one great question, however, in which they were happily agreed: nowhere do we see any indication that Zarathushtra ever supposed evil to inhere in matter, while Heraclitus went so far as to pronounce a materialistic pantheism. As to the fire of Heraclitus, when compared with that of Zarathushtra, it is indeed possible that the smoke of the altars in the Persian camps around his city which remained so loyal to the Persian cause, and the rumoured echoes of their Adar Yasht, or of its predecessors, may have attracted his attention; and upon reflection this may well\nhave confirmed his own convictions as to the supreme position of the 'mode of motion' among the elements. If so, Zoroastrianism did another great service to the world, if only by an accident; but, of course, the sublime concept of Heraclitus went far beyond even the beautiful Zoroastrian worship of the holy thing, which was indeed far more with his successors than the mere altar fire, and should be fully recognized as 'heat,' not flame alone, for we have its varieties at least in the later but still genuine Avesta, as interpreted by the later Zoroastrianism; even the caloric seated in the plants was known as well as that in living creatures. But as to the two systems in their entirety, they were well-nigh contradictory opposites: Zoroaster's (that is, Zarathushtra's) was a harshly limited monotheism, if such a contradiction or confusion in terms can be permitted, to convey a popular idea. It had its good creation and creator in antithesis to its still more limited mono-demonism ('so' again) with its counter creation and Creator. That is to say, it offered 'two worlds' and two quasi-independent deities; its dualism in a certain sense anticipated the more philosophically stated one of Anaxagoras, of Plato, and then of Philo. But Heraclitus banished at once both God and devil. His gods were of a kin to men.\u00b9 The L\u00f3gos of Heraclitus resembles the Asha of the Avesta, indeed, as the rhythm of law, and the latter became, let us not forget it, later actually a name for fire, though chiefly through the ritual, which was indeed an Asha by pre-eminence. But though the Fire-l\u00f3gos of Heraclitus must have been to some degree at least also touched by the universal sanctity of fire upon the altars in India and Persia,\u00b2 as even also, I must insist, in Greece, yet this Fire-l\u00f3gos was in so far radically different from that of the Avesta that it was in no sense whatsoever a created thing. With Heraclitus there was no 'creation' with which to\n\n\u00b9 Recall his saying \"that none of the gods or men had made the world.\"\n\u00b2 Recollect that Persia was on the way from India to Greece (on one way at least), and that the vast Indian philosophies and worship are actually parts of the identical lore reached by Persian sages. The Indians having positively once lived in the primeval Iran or near it, and formed one identical race with the authors of the pre-G\u0101thic G\u0101thas, if such a turn of speech may be allowed.\nassociate it, and no 'Creator,' while both Asha and Vohumanah at their second (logical) stage as concepts were both freely said to be 'created' by the great Good Being as whose attributes they first appeared; he made them as the hypostatization in personification of the great moral instincts of law and of goodness. While, therefore, this identification of the L\u00f3gos with the fire or heat should not disturb us much when 'heat' is understood to be merely the vital force, yet, on the other hand, a self-moved ever-living power which contains within itself the reason of all that 'becomes,' and has never had a beginning, is a thing presented in a very different light from the Asha of Ahura Mazda, even though it be by a figure (and only later) called 'His son.' The Asha of Heraclitus, to use some violence in language, was, together with his Fire-l\u00f3gos, a reason-guided and guiding force which evolves all things out of\u2014what? Out of itself\u2014so it seems. But in the Avesta that fire was not at all originally identified with Asha, for the concepts in the G\u00e1thas show no such connection. And the systems which at first sight look so closely related spread in their developments still further, worlds apart. So that aside from internal characteristics as a rhythm of motion, nothing could be so different from either Asha or Vohumanah, or any of the Ameshaspends, as the L\u00f3gos of the great Asiatic, magnificent though it may well be thought to be.\n\nYet this concept of the bitter misanthropic, so heterogeneous from Avesta, formed the beginning of the Greek idea of 'l\u00f3gos,' and influenced all future thought up to the very days of Philo.\nART. XXX.\u2014Etymological Vocabulary of the M\u0101ldivian Language. By Wilh. Geiger.\n\nIn the title of my paper the stress is to be laid upon the word 'etymological.' The vocabulary does not contain all the M\u0101ldivian words which I collected during the last five or six years, either from printed books, or from manuscripts hitherto unpublished, or from the lips of M\u0101ldivian natives. For it was by no means my intention to compile a M\u0101ldivian dictionary for practical use: this would be premature; it may perhaps be done at some future time. For the present my purpose is purely philological. The present object is to publish linguistic materials which may serve as a basis for a scientific phonology of the M\u0101ldivian language. My vocabulary is, therefore, both an introduction and a supplement to the third part of my \"M\u0101ldivian Studies,\" which deals with that subject. First, I have excluded, of course, from my vocabulary the numerous words borrowed from Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani, as they do not belong to the original stock of the M\u0101ldivian dialect. But I have omitted also generally those words which cannot be explained in a satisfactory way by the help of phonetic laws confirmed by other etymologies which are not open to doubt. There remains, nevertheless, a sufficient number of words to show clearly the character of the M\u0101ldivian language. It is merely a dialect, and not even a very ancient dialect, of Sinhalese. This result is, I think, also of historical interest; for it appears from it that the M\u0101ldive islands were occupied by Sinhalese people, but hardly at an earlier period than about eight or nine centuries ago.\n\nIn order to be as short as possible, I have not added to the single M\u0101ldivian words all the corresponding words\nfrom the other Indo-Aryan languages. Only the Sinhalese and P\u0101li equivalents are given; but with constant reference to my \"Etymologie des Singhalesischen,\" where further material for comparison will be found.\n\nThe abbreviations used in my paper are the following:\n\nES. = Geiger, \"Etymologie des Singhalesischen\": Abhandlungen der k.

This vocabulary is by no means valueless, although it must be used cautiously and with criticism.\n\nFinally, I send from a quiet German study my best greetings to those secluded islands, where the blue waves of the Indian Ocean roll up to the coral reefs, remembering with longing pleasure the wonderful tropical night when I saw on board the steamer, shining from afar through the darkness, the signal-fire of Minicoi.\n\nA.\n\n1. abi, 'wife,' Chr.; Py. amby; abi-kabul\u0113ge, LV. 13 (with honorific).\u2014Sinh. \u0101mbu, ES.

Molesworth Sykes, C.M.G., Royal Gold Medallist of the Royal Geographical Society.\n\nSouth-East Persia, the history of which I propose to discuss very briefly, consists of the provinces of Kirm\u0101n and Persian Baluchist\u0101n, in which I have been travelling since 1893, and where I was commissioned to found a consulate in 1894. Before, however, approaching their history, it seems advisable to recapitulate the physical features of these desert provinces, which, as elsewhere, have mainly owed their history to their geographical conditions.\n\nSouthern Persia and Baluchist\u0101n occupy some twenty degrees of longitude on the map, and lie between the rich alluvial plains and ancient civilizations of the Euphrates, Tigris, and K\u0101run on the west, and that of the Indus on the east. The provinces discussed in this paper hold a central position, with F\u0101rs on the west and British Baluchist\u0101n on the east; they were consequently somewhat remote from both these centres of civilization.\n\nI begin with Kirm\u0101n, which is a province of great interest if only for the various climates, products, and peoples that it contains. In common with the whole coast of Southern Persia, the country lies low for a considerable distance inland; the heat at the ports is terrible, and there are no good harbours, while as there is always either too much or too little wind in the Persian Gulf, navigation is by no means easy. This coast strip is backed by successive ranges all running parallel to the coast, i.e. with a north-west\n\n---\n\n1 In my recently published work, \"Ten Thousand Miles in Persia\" (John Murray), two chapters are devoted to the history of the province of Kirm\u0101n and two to that of Persian Baluchist\u0101n. There is also a chapter which refers to the history of Sistan, and throughout there are many historical notes.\ntrend. In some parts the altitude increases gradually, but in Jiruft the low-lying country runs up to the mighty mountain barrier which holds up the Ir\u0101nian plateau, and, as a consequence, enjoys a comparatively generous rainfall. In this range, to the south of Kirm\u0101n city, I have scaled two peaks, the Kuh-i-Sh\u0101h and Kuh-i-Haz\u0101r, which attain the great altitude of 14,000 feet. North of these Titans the country gradually sinks, although round the capital the ranges touch 13,000 feet, but beyond them are the low-lying wastes of the L\u016bt, the great desert of Persia. This \"land of drought and of the shadow of death\" stretches for hundreds of miles to the north, and forms a greater hindrance to intercourse and invasion than any range of mountains. Just as the traveller from the Persian Gulf has to cross range after range at right angles before reaching the Ir\u0101nian plateau, so too his onward journey is rendered most difficult by the funeral waste of the L\u016bt. It must also be remembered that even outside the sinister influence of the L\u016bt South-East Persia is by no means fertile, and is best described as desert tempered by oases. It is hard for dwellers in Europe to realize what it means to be absolutely dependent for all crops on irrigation, but when that is once grasped the immense importance of the mountains of Persia is evident, as without these storehouses of snow the whole country would be almost uninhabitable except by a few nomads.\n\nThe inhabitants of this huge area number perhaps 750,000, and may be divided into dwellers in towns or villages and nomads. The dwellers in houses are Ir\u0101nians, the pre-Aryan inhabitants and also the successive hordes of invaders having generally continued their wandering life, which is much the same as that depicted in the book of Job. Indeed, the life of a nomad is most antagonistic to civilization. Among the tribes in the province are ancient Persian clans, e.g. the Lak, also Arabs, Mongols, Baluchis, Turks, and gypsies.\n\nWe now come to Persian Baluchist\u0101n, which includes the western half of Makr\u0101n, the eastern and larger portion of\nBaluchist\u0101n being either British or under British influence. The whole country approximately corresponds to the seventeenth satrapy of Darius as recorded by Herodotus.\n\nPhysically speaking, Makr\u0101n includes the coast strip as far inland as the watershed of the first important range of hills. This district is washed by the Arabian Sea, and just as its coastline approximately trends east and west, so too its ranges run parallel to the coast, and are, if anything, more difficult to cross than those further west. North of Makr\u0101n the country slopes down to the level of the L\u016bt, which not only envelops it on the north, but also separates it from Kirm\u0101n, so that few, if any, countries are so inaccessible as Persian Baluchist\u0101n. It is consequently not surprising that, after the expedition of Alexander the Great, no European travelled in this forgotten land until less than a century ago.\n\nIn the district of Sarhad, bordering on S\u012bst\u0101n, is the remarkable Kuh-i-Taft\u0101n or Chahil Tan, which I scaled in 1893 when I discovered a volcano in the solfatara stage of existence. Round this range, which runs up to nearly 13,000 feet, the country is high and should be comparatively fertile, while to the west is the L\u016bt and to the east the equally dreary wilderness of Kh\u0101r\u0101n. Baluchist\u0101n, indeed, is far less fertile than Kirm\u0101n, and is concisely described in the Baluchi proverb which relates that when the Almighty created the world Baluchist\u0101n was formed from the refuse material. Its inhabitants may number 250,000, all of whom rank low in the scale of civilization. The darkest and oldest tribes are probably of Dravidian origin, the Baluchis are Aryans from the vicinity of the Caspian, and there is a medley of Arabs, Tat\u0101rs, Kurds, and Rajputs which causes the anthropologist to despair.\n\nTo sum up, both provinces are difficult of access from the north or south, and Baluchist\u0101n is also flanked on the west by an arm of the L\u016bt. Consequently no invasion has taken place by sea, and the provinces have escaped the fell massacres of Chengiz and Tamerlane. On the other hand, they have paid the penalty of remoteness by remaining\nbackward, and the southern prolongation of the L\u016bt made Baluchist\u0101n, until comparatively recent times, a separate province independent of Persia; Kirm\u0101n, on the other hand, has looked to F\u0101rs and Arabist\u0101n for its civilization, and it was from the west that it was overrun by the Arabs.\n\nAfter this brief description of the province, I now propose to discuss its history. Herodotus mentions the Germanii as forming one of the twelve tribes of Persia, while the fourteenth satrapy of Darius, as he describes it, includes the province of Kirm\u0101n as it is to-day. To this period we may assign the bronzes, an account of which may be of interest.\n\nA Kh\u0101n of Khin\u0101m\u0101n, a small district to the west of Kirm\u0101n city, informed me that he had found a number of these articles, and when I was able I paid him a visit and enquired as to the details of the find. My host said that hundreds of tombs were discovered, some five feet below the surface of the ground. The corpses had crumbled into dust, and it could not be ascertained in what direction they had been laid\u2014a very important point. In each tomb were a yellow jar of pottery, round bowls of three sizes, a pair of bracelets, two pins, and some arrow and spear heads, all of which were of bronze except the vessels. In addition, two or three cornelian gems were found, and some small silver earrings and bracelets, which I did not see. The custom of placing a cornelian in a dead man's mouth, with the names of the twelve Im\u0101m engraved on it, is one that obtains nowadays. An axe-head was also shown me, and there were, in addition, two handles, which may have fitted some other weapon, but not the axe-head. This completed the list of the bronzes. The vessels were of three types, one being clearly a lamp, and of the others one exactly resembled the modern Persian pocket-bowl, which is carried for drinking purposes. Some great jars, much like the khom of to-day, but shorter and wider, were also shown. In them a yellow dust had been found, possibly wheat or millet, but this had all been thrown away.\n\nMr. C. Hercules Read, of the British Museum, has very kindly furnished me with the following note on the axe-head:\nGREEK ALABASTER VASE FROM J\u012aRUFT.\n\"The special interest of the bronze axe found at Khin\u0101m\u0101n is that its form shows it to be, not a useful weapon, but a survival or degradation of such an implement. The angle at which the blade is set to the handle shows that it can have no real utility, while, on the other hand, the exaggerated crest which forms a sort of counterpoise to the blade is out of all proportion to the mass of the weapon as such.\n\n\"The axe from Armenia, a fairly remote district, in Canon Greenwell's collection, has certain analogies with it, but differs essentially in being manifestly a serviceable weapon. The socket, in this case, is large enough to admit a stout strong handle, while the ornamental lion is small, and well adapted as an ornamental appendage. The angle at which the blade is set to the shaft is also a clear indication that it was intended for use. Widely different in general appearance as these two objects are, there seems to me to be a clear resemblance in essentials, and in time this may be made clearer by further excavations and discoveries in the country intervening between South-East Persia and the Black Sea.\"\n\nWe may, I think, conclude that this most interesting find dates from the Achaemenian period, although the pottery tends to show that it belongs to a late stage of that epoch.\n\nThe next historical event of importance to which I would draw your attention is the march of Alexander the Great from the Indus to the K\u0101run. Some years ago I proved that the mighty Iskandar R\u016bmi, as he is termed in the East, halted for a considerable time in the valley of the Halil R\u016bd to the south of Kirm\u0101n. At the end of 1900 I revisited that valley, and one of my servants brought me a vase of Oriental alabaster which he had bartered for an old pair of trousers. This interesting antique is pronounced by the British Museum to be a Greek unguent vase of the fourth century B.C., and was probably left behind by the army of Alexander the Great. It has furnished me with gratifying evidence that my deductions were probably correct.\n\n* Ten Thousand Miles in Persia, p. 173 et seq.\nDuring the period of what is now termed the Parthian dynasty, I have found no reference to Kirm\u0101n, but it became famous when, after the conquest of F\u0101rs, it was seized by Ardesh\u012br, the son of P\u0101pak, who finally defeated Artabanus or Ardav\u0101n in a desperately contested battle near R\u0101m Hurmuz, with the result that, after enduring a foreign yoke for five centuries, a national dynasty was re-established in the house of S\u0101s\u0101n, which lasted until the Arab conquest.\n\nIn connection with the illustrious Ardesh\u012br I would invite attention to Bam, which is situated about 120 miles to the E.S.E. of Kirm\u0101n, and is the last town in Persia in this direction. Indeed, a journey of 600 miles across deserts must be undertaken before Nushki and Quetta are reached. Bam from early times has been of note in Persia. The district was designated Arba\u02bf or Four, from its four cities of Bam, R\u012bg\u0101n, Narm\u0101sh\u012br, and Nisa. Of these, Bam and R\u012bg\u0101n were founded by Bahman, Ardesh\u012br can claim the credit of building the city of Narm\u0101sh\u012br, and his wife constructed the dam on which Nisa depended. It was also the home of Haft\u0101n-bokht, Ardesh\u012br\u2019s great rival, in connection with whom a curious legend is recounted in the Pahlavi K\u0101rn\u0101mak-i-Artaksh\u012br-i-P\u0101pak\u0101n and also in the Sh\u0101h N\u0101meh. The daughter of Haft\u0101n-bokht, when spinning with other maidens, picked up an apple, within which she found a worm. She thereupon vowed that if she completed her allotted task before the others, she would save the worm alive. Almost at once her spinning was miraculously accomplished, and, faithful to her promise, she cherished the worm. From this time the family of Haft\u0101n-bokht prospered exceedingly, until its chief became the ruler of the province of Kirm\u0101n.\n\nAccording to the Pahlavi work, \u201cthe army of Haft\u0101n-bokht attacked a caravan of Ardesh\u012br, and brought the spoils to Guz\u0101r\u0101n, a borough of Gul\u0101r, where the worm had its abode. Now as regards the (worm) idolatry, it (grew) so powerful that five thousand men, who composed its forces in the different frontiers of Sind, assembled, and Haft\u0101n-bokht too collected his army. Ardesh\u012br sent to battle with the worm,\nCOPPER BOWLS FROM VICINITY OF KIRM\u0100N, AND BRONZE IMPLEMENTS FROM KHINAM\u0100N.\nbut its supporters took refuge in the hills and, falling on his army at night, routed it. Ardashir then took the field in person, but was also routed, and barely escaped with his life.\" However, the worm and its supporters were finally defeated by a stratagem, Ardashir or one of his adherents visiting Guz\u0101r\u0101n in disguise, and pouring molten tin down the worm's throat, which effected the death of the monster and the overthrow of Haft\u0101n-bokht. At one time I thought that this fable of the worm was a poetical description of the introduction of the silkworm, but later I came to the conclusion that it must be a legend of snake worship. Professor E. G. Browne, however, makes the happy suggestion that perhaps both these ideas were embodied in the legend, and this seems extremely likely.\n\nGuz\u0101r\u0101n of the Pahlavi and Kuj\u0101r\u0101n of the Sh\u0101h N\u0101meh, which is probably the site of ancient Bam, is situated about a mile above the fort on the river. It is now a ruin and known as Kuz\u0101r\u0101n, which is almost exactly the same word as Guz\u0101r\u0101n, and even to-day one of the gates of the Bam Fort is known as Kut-i-Kirm, or the Fort of the Worm.\n\nI will now discuss the capitals of Kirm\u0101n and give my reasons for having located the Carmana omnium mater of Ammianus Marcellinus in or a little to the north of Jiruft. Modern Kirm\u0101n mainly lies a little to the west of a more ancient city, which, on good authority, is stated to have been founded by Ardashir. But it became the capital of the province about A.H. 315 (928), when Abu Ali Muhammad ibn \u1e2ai\u0101s seized the province. Before this what is now known as the Kala-i-Sang of Sirj\u0101n was the capital. Mr. Guy Le Strange, trusting to the accounts of Arab travellers, and unaware of the results of my visit to Sirj\u0101n, thought that this capital was to be found elsewhere, but my explorations have caused him to change his views. I would beg to express a sense of my gratitude for the assistance which I have derived from his studies.\n\nI would now invite your attention to Sai\u02bfid\u0101b\u0101d, about\n\n---\n\n1 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (April, 1901).\n100 miles south-west of Kirm\u0101n. From this town I rode a few miles east in order to explore thoroughly what is undoubtedly an ancient capital of the province, though, to the best of my knowledge, it has been ignored by the very few travellers who have passed this way. Kal'a-i-Sang, or Stone Fort, is also known as Kal'a-i-Bayz\u0101, and rises in glorious whiteness some 300 feet above the level plain. Its direction is from north-east to south-west, and its length 400 yards, its breadth being rather less than 200 yards. Approached from the north this remarkable limestone crag is surrounded at some fifty yards from its base by a low sun-dried brick wall, which bore traces of having been rebuilt on older foundations. Inside this we found a beautiful stone pulpit some five feet high, on one side of which were four rows of Naskh inscription; a fifth row had been obliterated.\n\nWhile laboriously trying to make out the meaning of the inscription, three ragged peasants appeared and at once began to decipher it. I was not surprised to hear that their leader was the mulla of the village, and we learned from him that the pulpit had been constructed by Sult\u0101n Ahmad, 'Im\u0101d-ud-D\u012bn of the Muzaffar dynasty of Kirm\u0101n in A.H. 789 (1387). The inscription ran: \"The Sovereign, great, just, glorious, and victorious, Sult\u0101n Ahmad.\" We were furthermore informed that the headman of the adjacent village of 'Izzet\u0101b\u0101d had wished to remove the pulpit to his village, and in order to lighten it the top row of the inscription had been hammered off, after which the task was given up, as the pulpit is a monolith, and must exceed two or three tons in weight.\n\nUnder the mulla's guidance we moved round to the southwest corner, where, as also at the north-east angle, there is a high traverse wall, the intervening space to the south having evidently been the ruler's residence. On this side the inner wall is some forty yards from the cliff, and the outer is 200 yards distant, so that the total area enclosed was considerable.\n\nThe sole approach to the fort is on the south-west, where we found a second inscription on the right-hand side, just\nbelow the remains of a brick dam. Nothing, however, could be read until I sent for a skin of water and carefully washed the surface of the rock, when we made out a few lines to the following effect: \"In this blissful abode Amir \u0100'zam Husayn-ibn-Ali constructed the Hamm\u0101m.\" The date was apparently A.H. 410 (1019), but as the third cipher was not clear it may have been anything from A.H. 410 to 420 (1019\u20131029). The individual who thus perpetuated his memory was almost certainly the Deilami Governor, but I have not been able to identify him further. The ruins of the Hamm\u0101m were, however, clearly visible, the foundations of the stove having remained almost intact.\n\nOn the crest of the hill the buildings have practically disappeared, and the same is generally true of the walls, but under the north-east and highest portion of the crag is a fine grotto, known as the \"King's Seat,\" which is faced by the pulpit, and yet a third inscription, giving the name of Muhammad Sh\u0101h, was delicately chiselled in the rock. As there was no date, it was impossible to identify who was the particular sovereign thus commemorated.\n\nBelow is a second grotto, known as the Ander\u016bn, where the ladies spent the heat of the day; and as the cliff is quite inaccessible on this face, it must have formed an ideal retreat for a Persian ruler. No antiquities of any kind were forthcoming, except a lustred tile, which at once showed that this fort was inhabited during the thirteenth century, while history relates that it was the prison of the founder of the Muzaffar dynasty in the middle of the fourteenth century.\n\nAfzal Kirm\u0101ni, who flourished in A.D. 1188, wrote: \"Among the divisions of Kirm\u0101n is Sirj\u0101n, the ancient capital of Bards\u012br, a fine fertile district; and in Seljuk times they drew their troops thence, and kept a large garrison in it, as being on the Kirm\u0101n-F\u0101rs boundary. And in Sirj\u0101n are many old graves, and travellers and Sufis term it Lesser Syria. And there is a great fort reaching to the clouds.\"\n\nSirj\u0101n, as already said, is the older Moslem capital of Kirm\u0101n, but we now come to the question of the ancient\ncapital of the province, known in classic times as Carmana omnium mater, about which we are not without clear information, as already stated in my larger work. Ibn Haukal, in the first place, mentions that \"between Jiruft and Bam is Hurm\u016bz-ul-Malik, now known as Kariatul-Jauz\"; and he gives more than one itinerary, enabling us to fix the site. The first is as follows:\n\nRayin to Sarvist\u0101n ... ... 1 stage.\nSarvist\u0101n to D\u0101rj\u012bn ... ... 1 ,, (short).\nD\u0101rj\u012bn to Bam ... ... 1 ,, \n\nAll these stages are well known to me. Again, starting from Sarvist\u0101n we have a second itinerary as follows:\n\nSarvist\u0101n to Hurm\u016bz ... ... 1 stage.\nHurm\u016bz to Jiruft ... ... 1 ,, \n\nFinally, Mu\u1e33addasi aids us in our identification of the site by the following itinerary:\n\nD\u0101rj\u012bn to Hurm\u016bz ... ... 1 stage.\nHurm\u016bz to Jiruft ... ... 1 ,, \n\nThe site we seek is consequently not in the Jiruft plain, but in the hills of the Jabal B\u0101riz. I have twice travelled along this very route, and have noticed large kiln-burnt bricks and other ruins at Saghd\u0101r. I hope to return to Kirm\u0101n in the autumn, when a careful investigation of Marghak, Deh Bakri, Maskun, and Saghd\u0101r will be made. As there would have been sufficient arable land nowhere else, the search can be confined to these four sites. One of these hamlets, then, is the site of the Carmana omnium mater of Ammianus Marcellinus, and from my local knowledge I should select Saghd\u0101r, which is on the banks of a perennial\n\n---\n\n1 P. 219 of the Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum edition, by De Goeje.\n2 Ibn Haukal, p. 225.

In 1896, when serving on the Perso-Baluch Boundary Commission at J\u0101lk, I visited several domed buildings mainly constructed of sun-dried bricks, inside which were the tombs of a departed race of chiefs, commonly known as the Kay\u0101nian Maliks. This is, however, a mistake, there being little doubt that these chiefs were members of the Saffar family, which ruled in Baluchist\u0101n for more than five centuries after their expulsion from S\u012bst\u0101n. Some of the mausolea consisted of but one chamber, others also possessed an antechamber, and a third kind had two stories. There were remnants of tiling under the line of the dome, and occasionally there were crude drawings of elephants and peacocks, but everything was of the lowest order from an artistic point of view. Later on, at Kuhak, we camped near the pretty little village where, while examining a tomb similar to those described at J\u0101lk, I discovered a brick in one of the walls bearing an inscription, mutilated in places, but with a few lines legible, to the effect that Malik Shams-ud-D\u012bn, who died in A.H. 1027 (1617), was the individual in whose honour the tomb had been built. Now a Persian historian mentions that Ganj Ali Kh\u0101n, under orders from Sh\u0101h Abb\u0101s, invaded Baluchist\u0101n a few years previous to this date, and was opposed by a Baluch confederacy headed by Malik Shams-ud-D\u012bn, of the Saffar dynasty. I think, therefore, that it will be conceded that this corroboration establishes a most important fact in the history of Persian Baluchist\u0101n.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Guy Le Strange informs me that in the abbreviated texts of Idr\u012bs\u012b (e.g. the British Museum MS.) there is no mention of Hurm\u00fcz-al-Malik having been an ancient capital of Kirm\u0101n, whereas from the French translation (\\textit{G\u00e9ographie d\u2019\u00c9drisi}, vol. i, p. 423) it would appear that Idr\u012bs\u012b makes the remark about this Hurm\u00fcz which is quoted in my work. Probably the French translation was made from a more complete MS. than the one in the British Museum; in any case, proofs are sufficiently abundant of the ancient importance of Hurm\u00fcz-al-Malik without the necessity of invoking Idr\u012bs\u012b.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. M\u0101ra in the Guise of Buddha.\n\nW\u00fcrzburg, Sanderring 20.\nJanuary 25, 1902.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014It is, no doubt, very difficult to glean after the rich harvest of information collected by Professor Windisch in his masterly monograph on \"M\u0101ra und Buddha\"; yet, in so wide a field, who could ever hope to attain to completeness? On the other side, the small and insignificant ear which I have picked up while wandering across the same field does not alter the general results arrived at in that monograph; and, withal, the remoteness of the spot where it lay hidden is enough to excuse any omission. When, about five years ago, I first perceived it in Buddhaghosa's Commentary on the Etadagga chapter of the Anguttara (vol. i, pp. 23 sqq.), then to be read only in MSS., whereas at present some portions of this work are printed at Colombo on bad paper in Sinhalese characters, I sent a copy of it, that is to say of the legend in which M\u0101ra assumes the appearance of Buddha, to Professor Windisch, who, in my opinion, is our competent master in this branch of enquiry. And now it is only in the hope that others may be able to adduce more parallels, that I venture to call attention to my gleaning. Such parallels would be welcome from both quarters, from the Buddhist as well as from the Christian. For the legend\nwhich I am concerned with has a counterpart in a legend which relates that once the Evil One appeared to a monk of the Egyptian desert in the guise of Christ.\n\nThe P\u0101li source, i.e. the Manorathap\u016bra\u1e47i, written by Buddhaghosa in the first half of the fifth century A.D., presents us with about a hundred legends, one of which deals with an up\u0101saka, named S\u016bra Amba\u1e6d\u1e6dha or S\u016bramba\u1e6d\u1e6dha, or simply Amba\u1e6d\u1e6dha. He was setthi of S\u0101vatth\u012b and supported the heretics, but one day Gotama Buddha preached the Doctrine to him in a way appropriate to S\u016bramba\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u2019s status in the world, and after establishing him in the fruit of the first stage of the Path he withdrew.\n\n\u201cThen M\u0101ra thought: \u2018This S\u016bramba\u1e6d\u1e6dha is my own. To-day, however, the Teacher has gone to his house, and perhaps through the sermon he heard the Path has become manifest to him. I will ascertain whether he has escaped from my domain, or not.\u2019 Then, by virtue of his power to assume any shape he desired (attano k\u0101mar\u016bpita), M\u0101ra created a shape resembling that of the Buddha, and as even his mode of taking hold of his robe and bowl was the same, he counterfeited the Buddha very well. In this attire he took his stand at S\u016bramba\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u2019s house-door.\n\n\u201cS\u016bramba\u1e6d\u1e6dha, upon hearing that the Buddha had come again, thought: \u2018The Buddhas do not come save for what is conducive to our final emancipation (niyy\u0101nika). Why, then, has he returned?\u2019 Still, because he imagined him to be the Buddha, he speedily went near unto him. After having saluted him, he stood at a short distance, and said:\n\n\u201c\u2018Sir! But a moment ago you finished your meal in this house and went away. What can be the reason that you come back again?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Amba\u1e6d\u1e6dha,\u2019 he answered, \u2018when I taught you the Doctrine, there was one matter which I taught without having previously reflected upon it. I taught that all the five khandhas are impermanent, associated with suffering, and devoid of a Self, but this description does not hold true of all of them. Some, on the contrary, are permanent, stable, and eternal.\u2019\nM\u0100RA IN THE GUISE OF BUDDHA.\n\n\"S\u016bramba\u1e6d\u1e6dha thought: 'This sermon is very hard to believe. For the Buddhas would not teach anything without having reflected upon it beforehand. We know that M\u0101ra is the opponent of the Buddha. Evidently this is M\u0101ra!' 'Thou art M\u0101ra,' he said.\n\n\"As soon as the disciple of Buddha had uttered this word, it was as if a blow with an axe had fallen upon M\u0101ra. He was able no longer to keep up his disguise. 'Yes, Ambat\u1e6dha! I am M\u0101ra!' he said.\n\n\"Whereupon the other: 'If a hundred, yea, if a thousand M\u0101ras like thee should come here, they would be unable to shake my faith! The Great Gotama, the Buddha, when teaching the Doctrine informed me thus: All confections (sa\u1e45kh\u0101ras) are impermanent. Stop no longer at my house-door!' And he snapped his fingers. On hearing this, M\u0101ra kicked at him, but, unable to dispute what was said, then disappeared.\"\n\nEverybody will see that this legend ought to be ranged with those which Professor Windisch alluded to when he said:\n\n\"Als der Herrscher \u00fcber den Sams\u0101ra endlich ist er (M\u0101ra) es, der die verschiedenen Gestalten und Schicksale des Daseins schafft . . . . Damit h\u00e4ngt wohl zusammen, dass M\u0101ra selbst verschiedene Gestalten annimmt, in denen er an Buddha und dessen Anh\u00e4nger herantritt\" (l.c., p. 199).\n\nBut nobody will overlook the many features which distinguish our legend from all such in the M\u0101rasamyutta and Bhikkhunisamyutta of the Samyutta-Nik\u0101ya. Certainly, it is not shaped after the pattern given there. Both form and contents are different. Nowhere else does the Tempter approach an up\u0101saka, nor does he assume anywhere but in our legend the outward appearance of Buddha.\n\nThe name of S\u016bra Ambat\u1e6dha occurs, as far as I know, only once more, in another list of celebrated householders (A\u1e45g., vol. iii, p. 451). In the Sanskrit literature of the Buddhists, or, strictly speaking, in the printed texts, it does not occur. Likewise, no other legend is known to me in\nwhich M\u0101ra appears in the guise of Buddha.\\(^1\\) Nevertheless, I hope that our legend does not stand alone in Buddhist literature, and I am eager to get intelligence, particularly from scholars versed in the Tibetan and Chinese sources.\n\nWhereas the same legend, or a similar one, is as yet wanting in this hemisphere of the *globus religiosus*, we possess a parallel in the other sphere, viz. in the Lausiac history, written by Palladius, a Christian monk, in 420 A.D. It contains a series of biographical sketches of monks who were living in the deserts of Egypt, and is dedicated to Lausus, a chamberlain at the court of Theodosius II. For other details, I may be allowed to refer to the critical Study\\(^2\\) on this work by Dom Cuthbert Butler, to whom I am indebted also for having kindly sent me a proof of the legend which I here discuss, forming part of a forthcoming critical edition of the Greek text of the Lausiac history.\n\nValens, a Palestinian by birth, was exceedingly puffed up with haughtiness, and though he was repeatedly mocked by the devil, still he continued to believe that these mockings proceeded from heavenly powers. Such a behaviour encouraged the devil to carry his mockery to the utmost. \"He turned into Christ (\u03c3\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1) and came to Valens in the night, being himself accompanied by a thousand demons in the disguise of angels, who carried torches. Such was the apparition: A fiery circle became visible, in the centre of which the devil appeared in the figure of Christ. One of the angel-demons went before to tell Valens: 'Christ has taken pleasure in the libertine mode of thy life, and has come to see thee.'\" Thereupon the monk left his cell and adored the Antichrist. The next day he announced, in the presence of all the members of the Community, that he had seen Christ; but the holy Fathers put him in iron fetters for a year, in order to cure\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Divy\u0101vad.*, pp. 360 sqq. (see also Windisch, M\u0101ra u. Buddha, pp. 171 sqq.), was, of course, known to me, but the legend narrated there is, in my opinion, no real parallel to the story in question.\n\n\\(^2\\) *The Lausiac History of Palladius: Texts and Studies, Contributions to Biblical and Patristic Literature*, vol. vi, No. 1; Cambridge, 1898.\nhim of his insanity, in accordance with the maxim, *Contraria contrariis curantur*.\n\nI need not point out that Valens, though he was living the life of an ascetic, is far excelled in perspicacity of mind by S\u016bra Ambattha of the Buddhist story, who was only a layman, although styled ariyas\u0101vaka, i.e. belonging to those disciples of the Buddha who were walking in one of the four Paths. Yet we are here not concerned with the moral and intellectual qualities of the two men, but with the legends alone; and if we undertake to compare them one with the other, there remains only one real similarity between them, to wit, that the Evil One makes an attempt to deceive his victim by taking the outward appearance of his opposite.\n\nThe legend of Valens is told besides in a Syriac version, now printed in P. Bedjan's *Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum*, t. vii, 1897, pp. 93\u201395, which is believed to be the compilation made by '\u0100n\u0101n-\u012ash\u014d' in about 670 A.D., and described by Thomas, Bishop of Marg\u0101 (ninth century), in his Book of the Governors.\u00b9 The Syriac text does not differ from the Greek except in small things, as Professor Oskar Braun, of W\u00fcrzburg, had the kindness to assure me.\n\nI looked round for any other story that might bear resemblance to this one, but my efforts have not been rewarded with success. Neither Sulpitius Severus nor Cassian nor the *Apophthegmata Patrum* afforded me anything. It is quite likely, however, that in Coptic, Ethiopic, and Arabic sources of Christian origin some such story will be found. At present we can only say that the legend of Valens stands alone, and in this respect both sides are equal. Let us hope that future research will free the Buddhist as well as the Christian legend and their common element from an ungenial isolation.\u2014Yours sincerely,\n\nE. Hardy.\n\n\u00b9 See E. A.

A N\u012btim\u0101\u00f1jari Quotation.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In the September number of the Journal for 1900 I traced to the Saptas\u016btra of \u015aa\u1e45kara the verse an\u0101tmabh\u016bte deh\u0101dau, etc., which is quoted by Dy\u0101, and in the Saradar\u015banasamgraha of M\u0101dhava. I have now, however, found the verse in another work of \u015aa\u1e45kara, the Aj\u00f1\u0101nabodhini, of which there is a copy in the Bodleian. As this work is an exposition of the \u0100tmabodha, and as Dy\u0101 expressly cites the verse from the \u0100tmav\u1e5btti, which presumably equals \u0100tmabodhav\u1e5btti, there can be little doubt that this is the work whence the quotation is derived.\n\nI take this opportunity of mentioning that the date given by Peterson for the N\u012btim\u0101\u00f1jari is supported by the statements in a Benares MS. formerly lent to Professor Max M\u00fcller, and in the MS. in his own collection described by Wickremasinghe (supra, p. 643).\u2014Yours truly,\n\nA.

Rhys Davids, Esq.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Want of an atlas of ancient India is no doubt much felt by many students of Indian antiquity, notwithstanding that such an atlas can now be prepared and published. Without pretending to give a complete list of the contents of such an atlas, I may be permitted to put down roughly what it may contain, so as to give some idea of the nature of the book I refer to.\n\nSheet I will show the places mentioned in the Rig Veda.\nSheet II, places mentioned in the later Vedas.\nSheet III, places existing at the time of Buddha, marking also that great reformer's journey in different parts of the country.\nSheet IV, Empire of Asoka, marking also the places where his edicts have been found and the different stupas erected.\n\nSheet V, routes of the more important Chinese travellers.\n\nSheet VI, places mentioned in the Ramayana.\n\nSheet VII, places mentioned in the Mahabharata.\n\nSheet VIII, places mentioned in the works of Kalidasa.\n\nEtc., etc., etc.\n\nThis by no means exhausts the list, for further sheets may be prepared showing the places mentioned in the different Puranas. At all events, this is the idea of the Atlas, the publication of which I wish to suggest for the consideration of the Indian antiquarians, and shall therefore feel obliged if you will kindly give this letter a place in the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\" The boundaries of the different kingdoms and countries cannot, of course, be given; their positions can only be roughly indicated; but those of towns, etc., can be accurately marked.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nJ.

Consul, Kerm\u0101n and Persian Baluchist\u0101n. 8vo. (London: Murray, 1902.)\n\nThis book is the most notable contribution to our knowledge of South-Eastern Persia that has yet appeared, and it forms the necessary complement to the volumes by Lord Curzon which, rather more than ten years ago, summarized all that was then known of the kingdom of the Sh\u0101h. Kerm\u0101n and Sist\u0101n, with the neighbouring Baluch frontier, could then be only partially described, but, thanks to the network of journeys lately carried through by Major Sykes, this southeastern quarter of Persia is now become one of its best known regions. With the purely geographical chapters it is needless to deal in this place; suffice it to say that the narrative is clearly written, and that the humours of the road enliven the many long marches through the wilderness, which everywhere is haunted by the remembrance of a great past.\n\nFrom the historical point of view two chapters in the present work are of importance, in which Major Sykes has discussed \"The March of Alexander the Great from the Indus to the K\u0101r\u016bn\" and \"Marco Polo's Travels in Persia.\" At the present day in Kerm\u0101n the means of locomotion, by mule or camel, are still exactly identical with what existed in the fourteenth century when the Venetian traveller passed through the country. The marches that Marco Polo made\nMajor Sykes could and did make, the possible routes and distances being the same in both cases: and for the matter of that they also are the same now as when Alexander came through the land more than two thousand years since, and they are likely to remain the same for some time yet to come. In regard to the travels of the great Venetian, Major Sykes points out good reasons for doubting the hitherto accepted route into Persia via Baghd\u0101d, through Mesopotamia, and to the Gulf Ports. Had Marco Polo actually seen 'Baudas' he would hardly have failed to give us a clear description of the former City of the Caliphs, already then recovering from the Mongol sack, and fast rising to be the great city which Timur occupied a century and more later. Marco Polo, as Major Sykes points out, more probably entered Persia by Tabr\u012bz, and passing through S\u0101vah to Yazd, thence took the northern of the two roads to Kerm\u0101n. That this last, via B\u0101f\u1e33, was the route followed, is proved conclusively by the date-groves, still existing near B\u0101f\u1e33, which are mentioned by Polo; while the alternative, southern, track from Yazd to Kerm\u0101n keeps to so high an altitude that date-palms are not, and never could have been, met with along it.\n\nOf Marco Polo's Camadi\u2014the place named Kum\u0101din in the Salj\u016bk Chronicle (as General Schindler pointed out in the pages of this Journal many years ago) and now known as Shahr-i-Dak\u012by\u0101n\u016bs, 'the City of Decius'\u2014Major Sykes has much to tell. It was a suburb of the medi\u00e6val town of Jiruft, which last must have been in Greek days an important city, for coins and seals are abundantly found here; also, our author had the good luck to acquire a small alabaster vase which had been dug up near Jiruft, and this the authorities at the British Museum pronounced to be undoubtedly of Greek workmanship, dating from the fourth century B.C., being intended to contain unguents. The unguent-vase is the clinching point in a chain of geographical argument, whereby Major Sykes would seek to prove that the plain of Jiruft is the site of the ancient Greek capital of Kerm\u0101n, the Carmana omnium mater of Ammianus\nMarcellinus. This, of course, needs confirmation by digging and an arch\u00e6ological survey, but there appears to be no doubt that Major Sykes has now at last identified the site of the first Arab capital of Kerm\u0101n, namely Sirj\u0101n, the position of which (as pointed out in the July number of this Journal, p. 530) was matter of much question, and at the same time was a very important place, topographically, to fix. Sirj\u0101n, we now learn, can hardly be other than the great rock fortress and ruins called Kal'ah-i-Sang, lying some five miles to the eastward of Sa'id\u0101b\u0101d on the road to B\u0101ft, which our author visited and has carefully described in chapter xxxvi. Space must forbid further notice of the many other interesting sites described in this volume; but a full account is given of S\u012bst\u0101n and the ruins of its ancient capital, which in early times was known as Zaranj. In later days this name appears to have fallen out of memory, for it is everywhere replaced by the term Madinah S\u012bst\u0101n, 'the City of S\u012bst\u0101n'; and I may note in conclusion that as far as is known Z\u0101hid\u0101n (\"the capital . . . . so far as I can learn,\" as Major Sykes writes) is the name of a quite modern village among the ruins of Zaranj, for according to the Persian writers Z\u0101hid\u0101n was not the name of the city in the time of Timur, for the capital which he stormed was known as Madinah S\u012bst\u0101n.\n\nG.

The ancient town was lavish in its hospitality. The Congress was very fully attended, and was a great success. It was determined to have, in future, a permanent office for the Oriental Congresses, and the place chosen was the office of this Society in London. There the beautiful drinking horn, presented at the Stockholm Congress by H.M. the King of Sweden, will in future be kept. It was also resolved that the proceedings of each Congress, including that at Hamburg, should be published within a short time of the close of the Congress, and that the papers read should appear, in those proceedings, in abstract. As these proceedings, in the case of Hamburg, will no doubt be accordingly accessible before long, it would be unfitting, in our Journal, to attempt to anticipate the official report. Finally, it was decided that the next Congress should be held, in 1905, at Algiers, the Governor-General of that colony having sent a cordial invitation to that effect.\n\nIII.

Mackworth, K.C.S.I.\n\nThe Chairman, in proposing the toast of \"The King and Emperor of India,\" said:\n\nThe auspicious occasion which brings us together is the approaching Coronation of the King. His Majesty's visit to India will enable him to deal with the great interests of his Indian Empire with a personal knowledge enjoyed by none of his predecessors. (Cheers.) His Majesty, as Patron of our Society, shows his interest in the studies of Orientalists. (Cheers.) We are pleased to know that the King has recovered from his indisposition. (Cheers.) I propose to send the following telegram to His Majesty:\u2014\"The Royal Asiatic Society and their guests, Indian Princes and other Indian representatives, with their humble duty, beg to tender the tribute of their loyalty on the approaching Coronation, and their satisfaction at His Majesty's recovery from his indisposition.\" (Loud cheers.)\n\nThe toast was most loyally honoured.\nIn proposing the toast of \"The Queen, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the other Members of the Royal Family,\" the Chairman said:\n\nWe all know that Her Majesty the Queen takes the same interest in the medical relief of Indian women which was taken by our late beloved Sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Victoria. It will secure to Her Majesty the deepfelt gratitude of thousands of Indian women, and will endear the illustrious memory of Queen Victoria to future generations. Among the many benefits of British rule this care for the sick occupies a foremost place. The Prince and Princess of Wales have as yet not been able to visit the Indian Empire. Their Royal Highnesses will meet with as cordial a reception in India as everywhere was given to them in their eventful progress through the Colonies. We trust that visit will not be long delayed. All the members of the Royal Family are constantly active in discharging the duties connected with their high station, and in giving their patronage to movements which promote the welfare of His Majesty's subjects in every part of his dominions.\n\nWith this toast I am allowed to couple the name of General His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught. He has devoted his life to the study of those intricate military problems which sharpen the wits of the greatest intellects on the Continent of Europe, and which, owing to the structure of our empire, are exceptionally intricate. As Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army the Duke was able to improve it in many ways, and all ranks of the British and Native forces recollect with pride the days when they served under His Royal Highness. As a member of Council we had the benefit of his knowledge of Indian affairs and of his insight in the delicate mechanism of Indian society. We remember with cordial gratitude the graceful way in which the Duchess of Connaught dispensed hospitality to all sections of the Bombay community. Wherever the Duke of Connaught has been in command he has endeared himself to all with whom he came in contact by his stern sense of duty and the charming manner in which he discharged his duties. We all wish him a long life and success in all he undertakes.\n\nThe Duke of Connaught, who on rising to respond to the toast was received with great cordiality, said:\u2014\nI rise in the name of Queen Alexandra, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the other members of the Royal Family to thank you most cordially for the manner in which you have drunk their health. Lord Reay has spoken with regard to the deep interest Queen Alexandra takes in everything connected with all social and medical advance in her Eastern Empire. (Cheers.) You are also aware of the great interest which both the Prince and Princess of Wales take in India, and I am sure I am not divulging a secret when I say that I do not think it will be so very long before they both pay a visit to our Indian Empire. (Loud cheers.) With regard to myself, I would wish particularly to thank Lord Reay for the very delicate and charming manner in which he has referred to the important assistance I at all times have received from Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Connaught. (Cheers.) She had the advantage of seeing a great deal of a side of Indian life which none of us men are allowed to see, and she has always looked back with much interest and pleasure to her visits to the Zenanas and other places. (Cheers.) With regard to myself, I feel that I have a greater advantage than probably any other member of the Royal Family in having served for nearly seven years in India. (Cheers.) During that time I was able to travel through much of that vast and interesting country. I was able to be associated with three Viceroys, with numerous Governors and Lieutenant-Governors, and other able administrators in India. I was known myself to most of the Indian Princes, and in their presence I hope they will allow me to say that we heartily welcome them to this country. (Cheers.) Several of them have already done good service to the empire, and wherever they have been they have distinguished themselves and proved their loyalty and fidelity to the King-Emperor. (Loud cheers.) With regard to our Indian empire, even in the presence of Lord Roberts I may be allowed to speak of the Indian Army, for which I have the deepest affection. It was only to-day that I had the great pleasure of inspecting at Hampton Court nearly 1,000 Indian soldiers, of every class, caste, and, I may say, tribe also, that makes up that splendid force of the Indian Army. (Cheers.) All these men have come this long distance at the call of His Majesty the King-Emperor to be present at his Coronation; and I do not suppose that in the history of the world a more representative gathering of all those nationalities which make up our Indian Army could be met together\u2014(cheers)\u2014and all bound together with one common aim\u2014loyalty to the King-Emperor and devotion to the empire in which they are most important entities. (Cheers.)\nLord Reay, in proposing the toast of \"The Indian Visitors,\" said:\n\nWe give you a hearty welcome. (Cheers.) Many of us here present enjoyed your truly princely hospitality, and we have kept a pleasant recollection of it. (Cheers.) The position of an Indian ruler is in many respects most enviable. Good government will always secure to his exchequer a surplus and freedom from debt. He has ample resources to provide for the intellectual and material well-being of his subjects. Trade is free. The Maharaja of Kolhapur will not regret having abolished transit duties. He can and does give liberal encouragement to arts and manufactures. Nothing could compensate us for the loss of the skilled handicraft of the Indian artisan. I have a lively recollection of the interest taken by His Highness the Maharaja of Jaipur in his museum. The principal care of the Indian Princes is the same as that of the British Government; it is wise legislation for the tiller of the soil. In most native States the soil cannot be mortgaged, and the tendency of all recent legislation is to protect the small proprietor. The small proprietor is a bulwark of Indian polity. We are well aware that his existence is threatened by many pitfalls. To strengthen his armour so that he may not fall a victim to the insidious attacks of an enemy always lying in wait for him, is an object which can never be lost sight of. The agricultural prosperity of India has been impaired by a series of famines, but the way in which the native rulers of India have met this calamity and that of the plague, the relief they have given to their distressed subjects, has given them a further title to the traditional devotion of their subjects. (Cheers.) You are fortunately removed from the great competition in armaments amongst European Powers, but we know that it is your wish to co-operate with the Imperial Government in the defence of our common country. The Imperial Service Corps have on several occasions given evidence of their valour, and the way in which Lord Dufferin's invitation to organize such corps was responded to by the Indian Princes has been fully appreciated by the Imperial Government. (Cheers.) But you must allow me to greet you in another capacity\u2014as the representatives of an ancient civilization. The Society which has the honour of entertaining you is devoted to the study of ancient and classical Indian literature. The study of your ancient records fills us with wonder and admiration for the philosophical subtlety displayed by your great thinkers. Whilst recognizing that the development of the material resources of India is an object steadily\nto be kept in view, we think that full justice should be done to the study of those ancient records. It will prevent the rise of a self-sufficient generation, and self-sufficiency is the corollary of a superficial education. Examinations are no substitute for real and serious research; and it would be a cruel irony of fate if we in the West were saving from oblivion those treasures of ancient learning whilst they were being neglected in India by the direct heirs of so valuable a legacy. In close connection with this study is the preservation of ancient monuments and ancient documents. I am sure you will gladly undertake this duty in your several States. The loss of such monuments and of such invaluable archives is irretrievable, and I am afraid that a great deal remains to be done for their maintenance. My wishes for your welfare I cannot summarize better than in the words of Sir Alfred Lyall when he makes the West speak to the East:\n\n\"Let the hard earth soften, and toil bring ease,\nLet the King be just and the laws be strong;\nYe shall flourish and spread like the sheltered trees,\nAnd the storms shall end, and the ancient wrong.\"\n\n(Cheers.) I couple with this toast the name of His Highness the Maharaja Sindhia. I was entertained by His Highness, who then was a boy, at Gwalior, and I now have the pleasure of greeting him as a distinguished Prince. I also remember the Maharaja of Kolhapur as a boy, and the pleasant duty which fell to me to make the arrangements for his education and for that of his brother, the Chief of Kagal, and of his uncle. The Maharaja Sindhia has, with the Maharaja of Idar, taken a prominent part in the Chinese campaign; and by the equipment of a hospital ship His Highness has shown his warm-hearted solicitude for those who fall in battle or are struck down by sickness. I offer His Highness our best wishes for the success of his administration, in which we know he takes a personal and sagacious interest. I also couple with this toast the name of Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, the representative of the Parsee community which has done so much for the improvement of Bombay, for which I venture to claim precedence as the most picturesque city of India. Sir Jamsetjee also represents the Native Civil Service, and speaking in the presence of so many distinguished members of the Indian Civil Service I am sure they will be the first to recognize how valuable is the work done by that large body of officials throughout India.\nColonel Maharaja Sindhia of Gwalior, who was enthusiastically welcomed, said in response:\n\nYour Royal Highness, Lord Reay, and Gentlemen,\u2014I thank you most heartily for the cordial manner in which you have drunk the health of the Indian visitors, most of whom have their feet now for the first time on English soil. We have come to take part in the Coronation ceremony of their Majesties, and we have been deeply touched and gratified by the generous hospitality accorded to us as guests of the King, as well as by the kindness and attention shown by public bodies and private individuals throughout the country. To say that we are enjoying our visit would be but a weak expression of our feelings; we are learning to understand the greatness and strength of England, her unlimited resources, and the character of her people. The only drawback that I can think of has been the weather\u2014(laughter)\u2014which neither kings nor laws can control\u2014(laughter)\u2014but of which we have had the gloomiest forecasts. It was my intention to visit this country in 1897 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, but the distress which prevailed in my State during that year forbade my leaving my territory, and it will be one of the greatest regrets of my life that I never looked on the face of that Sovereign of blessed and glorious memory whom we all with one accord reverenced and loved. His Majesty's present gracious invitation enables me to pay the homage which I owe to my King and Emperor. (Cheers.)\n\nYour Lordship has alluded in flattering terms to the charity and hospitality of the Indian Chiefs, and to the administration of their territories. I trust Gwalior, in common with others, is doing and will continue to do its utmost to deserve your Lordship's praises. (Cheers.)\n\nYour Lordship made special mention of the encouragement of education. So far as boys are concerned, education is sufficiently attractive in the openings it gives for employment or for professional careers, but female education is a more difficult and delicate matter. I am persuaded, however, that once people become accustomed to the idea the difficulties begin to disappear. If I may, without egotism, refer to the case of my own State, I would say that only about four years ago was the first girls' school opened, after much discussion and consideration, and I confess I have myself been surprised at the success of the undertaking, for much opposition and prejudice had to be overcome. More than this, a special institution has been established within the last few months for\nthe daughters of my nobles, a class who keep their daughters in seclusion, and who a short time ago would have been most unwilling to send them to school.\n\nBut, if we Indian Chiefs deserve any credit for furthering the noble cause of education, we in our turn entertain the liveliest sense of gratitude to His Excellency Lord Curzon for the great interest he has shown in our training. He has personally presided over a conference on the subject of Chiefs' Colleges, and has organized the Imperial Cadet Corps to provide a military career for those scions of noble houses whose inclinations lie in that direction. If I may be permitted to say so, there is nothing more calculated in my opinion to stir the loyalty and stimulate the energies of the aristocracy of India than such a scheme. (Cheers.)\n\nAs to the humble service I was able to render during the war in China, I look upon it as my pride and privilege to have personally taken part in the operations and to have aided in ever so small a degree in relieving those who suffered for the Empire. And, gentlemen, it affords me the highest pleasure to see here among the Indian Chiefs some of the comrades who served with me in that distant land, and whom I now meet on the opposite side of the globe, assembled for a common purpose, namely, to testify to our undying loyalty to His Most Gracious Majesty the King-Emperor. (Loud cheers.)\n\nI would beg in conclusion to express our thanks to the Royal Asiatic Society for their hospitality to us to-night. (Cheers.)\n\nSir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, Bart., said:\n\nMr. Chairman, your Royal Highness, your Highnesses, my Lords and Gentlemen,\u2014I feel proud to be called upon in this illustrious assemblage to respond to the toast of the visitors from India which has been so cordially proposed by Lord Reay, and which you have so kindly received. H.H. the Maharaja Scindhia of Gwalior, who has preceded me, has left little for me to say, and yet as we feel that enough cannot be said in adequate recognition of the way in which you have welcomed us to this banquet, I, on behalf of the other Indian visitors as on my own, take this opportunity to assure you that we feel proud to be amongst our fellow-subjects in this city\u2014the metropolis of the British Empire\u2014to witness and to take part in the great historic event which has brought us from India. We feel proud to share with our British fellow-subjects the joys, the glories, and the triumphs of our august Sovereign. India, no less than the other parts of His\nMajesty's wide and ever-widening dominions, feels grateful to Providence for the peace that has been recently effected in South Africa, to mark, as it were, with unalloyed joy and to shed added lustre on the Coronation of His Imperial Majesty. It is one of these epoch-making events in the history of British achievements, the like of which have consolidated various populations into one mighty nation under one flag, by cementing and strengthening the bonds of brotherhood and promoting concord and loyalty amongst the myriad subjects of the British Crown. (Cheers.)\n\nIt is a privilege to be associated with an event which will be lastingly memorable in history, and the heartiness and cordiality of the receptions which have been accorded to us visitors from India in this the centre of His Majesty's empire will ever be cherished by us as a signal mark of that Imperial feeling of sympathy and good-will by which the great British nation is inspired. Of these receptions the one accorded to us to-night is by no means the least important. (Cheers.)\n\nWe have been welcomed here to-day under the chairmanship of Lord Reay, whose name is held in great regard and esteem in India, but more particularly in the Bombay Presidency, from which I came, and the honour which has been so done us is highly augmented by the gracious presence of His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, the recollection of whose valuable services in India and whose affability of manner towards all classes of people are to-day as fresh in the popular mind as when he left our shores. I beg to assure you that the memory of the compliment paid to us by this distinguished assemblage under such happy and illustrious auspices will be cherished by us for many long years to come. (Loud cheers.)\n\nThe Chairman next proposed \"The other Guests,\" which was acknowledged by the Lord Mayor.\n\nLord Elgin gave the toast of \"The Imperial Forces.\" He said:\n\nIt used to be the custom for the proposer of this toast to pass in review the claims of the various services, but I take it that at this moment this is neither required nor desired. All are included when we name the Imperial Forces: Army, Navy, and Volunteers\u2014British, Colonial, and Indian. In the great emergency through which we have passed none have failed us, and all deserve recognition. We feel gratitude for the loyalty they have shown and the sacrifices they have ungrudgingly made. We feel\npride in the unflinching courage which has been manifested, and\nthe full success which has at last crowned their achievement.\nAbove all, we feel admiration for the spirit of discipline and\nof self-control in the highest sense which has animated all\nranks; which has, I believe, won the respect of every impartial\nobserver; and which we may leave with the utmost confidence\nto the ultimate tribunal\u2014the judgment of the historian. May\nI call attention, in a couple of sentences, to a parallel and\na contrast. Once before, in our history, the forces of the Crown\nhave had to meet a great emergency, and at the same time\ncomplications arose in China, which led to military operations\nand an expedition. So far the parallel is complete, but the\ncontrast is even more so. In 1857 the troops destined for the\nChinese expedition were diverted to give welcome assistance to\nthe British Government in India in its time of peril. In 1900\nIndia sent a large proportion of the men who represented British\ninterests in China. And the Indian troops held their own, as\nthose who knew them best fully expected, amongst the troops\nof many nations. Is this not of happy augury, pointing to the\ntime when our antagonists of yesterday, with their undoubted\nbravery and military capacity, will take their place with us in\nthe military forces of the Empire? (Loud cheers.) I said it\nwas not necessary to differentiate, but there is one service to\nwhich the circumstances of this evening compel attention. In the\nChinese Expedition the Imperial Service Troops of India first\nsaw foreign service. I am bound to testify that, if so, it has been\nfrom no lack of honourable ambition; and I mention the fact\nbecause the two corps which first joined a British force in the\nfield were sent out by two of the guests now amongst us. The\nTransport Corps of Jaipur and Gwalior did invaluable service\nin the Chitral Expedition, and again in Tirah, where other\nImperial Service Troops also served. We shall, I think, desire\nspecially to congratulate the representatives of the Imperial Service\nTroops present on the part played by them in the Chinese\nExpedition. (Cheers.)\n\nI am allowed to couple this toast with two names. What is it\nnecessary for me to add after pronouncing the name of Lord\nRoberts? (Loud cheers.) Two years ago I had the honour of\nunveiling in Calcutta the statue which records the appreciation\n\u2014the affectionate appreciation\u2014of his fellow-subjects in India\nof his forty-one years' service in India. Since then another\ncontinent has witnessed a brilliant campaign \u2014 the necessary\nprelude of the strong and persistent effort which has won for\nus an honourable and, as we hope, a lasting peace. And now he has returned, not to rest upon his laurels, but to undertake the vast labours and responsibilities of the Commander-in-Chief. There is no name so completely representative of the Imperial Forces as that of Lord Roberts.\n\nBut no less cordial will be our good wishes to the Maharaja of Idar. I have spoken of the Imperial Service Troops, and I am safe in saying that there is no name so intimately associated with the formation and progress of that force than that of Sir Pertab Singh. (Cheers.) Under him the Jodhpore Lancers established a reputation, which they have fully maintained in China; and he himself has again and again distinguished himself by his zeal and soldierly qualities, and has within the last few days received, not for the first time, from the hands of his Sovereign high marks of consideration for services rendered. (Loud cheers.)\n\nLord Roberts, in responding, said:\n\nThe whole world now knew the meaning of the Imperial forces. It appreciated their real power and strength\u2014strength that had shown that at a moment of alarm the members of those forces would hasten from all parts of the King's dominions to fight His Majesty's battles, impelled by a sentiment of brotherhood and knit together by feelings of loyalty and devotion to the Crown. (Cheers.) That was a good impulse, and what we had witnessed during the last two and a half years\u2014the Imperial forces, the soldiers of the King, united, side by side, fighting for one cause under one flag, the flag which Mr. Schalk Burger the other day described as that glorious Union Jack (cheers)\u2014had been a spectacle that we might all be proud of; and\u2014he said it with no emotional feeling\u2014it had been an object-lesson to the world generally. (Cheers.) On that occasion he would speak particularly of India, and of India's share and right and title in any share that might be given in any congratulation that might be accorded to the Imperial forces. In South Africa it was not thought expedient, for political reasons, to employ Indian troops; but the Indian Army, a magnificent force in the aggregate, of which, perhaps, no one could speak better than he could himself\u2014(cheers)\u2014was ready to go anywhere at a moment's notice, and contributed in no small degree to the support and success of that war. And though during those two and a half years many were the requests by the great feudatories in India that help might be taken from them\u2014and this we are now gladly able to acknowledge and are very proud\nof\u2014and though they were disappointed in their services in South Africa not being accepted, yet an outlet for their zeal and devotion was found in the direction of China. There the Indian chiefs sent horse and foot to fight the battles of their Emperor, and there, too, some of India's chiefs went, foregoing the pleasures of their palaces, to undergo the trials and hardships of a war in an unknown and far-distant country. The Maharaja of Gwalior and Sir Partab Singh not alone cheerfully placed themselves under the orders of the general officer commanding the British forces, but the Maharaja of Gwalior, in addition, fitted out a hospital ship, which he placed at the disposal of the Indian Government during the war. The Maharaja of Jaipur had established some few years ago a transport train which had proved its efficiency on more than one occasion on the North-West Frontier of India. (Cheers.) Besides China, on many other occasions these chiefs had shown that same feeling of loyalty to the Crown, as well as other chiefs not there that night who were quite entitled to our acknowledgments. Whenever the political horizon was darkened and clouds threatened, these chiefs at once came forward to place their troops, their services, and their friends at the disposal of the Indian Government. (Cheers.) A magnificent feeling animated the great feudatories of India; and, while we could show to the whole world such a great example, England might at once feel proud to think that we had succeeded in retaining permanently the respect and affection of such men, and glad to feel that we could depend upon praiseworthy and trusty representatives to come to our aid whenever the occasion called for their assistance. Referring to the peace, Lord Roberts said it had been proclaimed in South Africa when we were welcoming our distinguished visitors from India. That peace we all hoped and believed would be enduring, and we were encouraged and confirmed in that opinion by the very satisfactory manner in which the Boers were meeting us now and carrying out their part in the agreement. (Cheers.) They were brave men, large-hearted, generous, and respected their enemies. We had never in the field met a braver enemy than the Boers, and for this reason his firm belief was that, now that the strife was over, they would prove not only loyal British subjects, but firm and constant friends. (Cheers.) He thought it was no disparagement to the Boers\u2014he thought he might congratulate them on the fact\u2014when he compared their present position to that of the great brave race of the Sikhs. We never had harder fights than with that brave race on the plains of the Punjab. We had received many hard knocks from the Sikhs and many hard knocks from the Boers, but\nwhen peace was made, when the struggle was over, the situation was then accepted, the result being that the Sikhs had been our best friends, our most faithful allies. (Cheers.) And so he firmly believed would be the case with those who had been so recently our enemies, now our friends, the brave Boers. (Cheers.) He had not mentioned the Royal Navy, the Regular Army, or the Militia, Yeomanry, and Volunteers, who had behaved with such distinction in South Africa, nor had he said a word about the heroic and indomitable general, Lord Kitchener, to whose skill in war and tact in diplomacy we owed a deep debt of gratitude. (Cheers.) They all knew as well as he did the extraordinary humanity displayed by those troops in South Africa during a long and weary campaign of two years and a half. (Cheers.) No praise from him, he was sure, was necessary; he only could say he was proud to think he was privileged to take a part with men who had done so much. (Cheers.)\n\nTranslation of Sir Partab Singh's speech:\n\nYour Royal Highness, my Lord Reay, my Lords and Gentlemen,\u2014I hope you will excuse my replying in my own language. It is one of the glories of the King's empire that men of different languages are proud to belong to it and to give their lives in its service, knowing all that it represents\u2014freedom, liberty, and civilization. India knows this well, and therefore her leading princes have gladly undertaken to furnish troops for the defence of the British empire.\n\nMy brother the Maharaja of Jodpore was one of the first to offer two regiments of cavalry for Imperial service, and I as his Minister took great interest in raising and commanding those regiments which had the honour of serving in China for a year under General Gaselee. When I returned from China His Majesty the King graciously invited me to attend his Coronation at the head of those Imperial service troops from different States which are now assembled in London to testify their loyalty to the British Throne, as they did five years ago when Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, of blessed memory, the mother of her people in India as well as in England, permitted me to lead them at Her Diamond Jubilee. That is why I have the great honour of now returning thanks for them and for the kind words which His Excellency Lord Elgin, our former Viceroy, has said about us. We are ready to go anywhere by the King's command, and are very glad to be here for the Coronation of His Majesty and the Queen. The\nPrinces of India are loyal to the Government, and so are the Imperial Service Troops. I can speak for both, having lately become a prince, though in my heart I count myself a soldier first. In former days one of our leaders said that a Rajput's throne is on the back of his horse. That is the throne I know best and love most, much as I value the exalted position to which I have been called as Maharaja of Idar. On this occasion and at all times it is a great pride and pleasure to me to feel that I am one of the Imperial Service Troops\u2014a devoted servant of the King on whose empire the sun never sets.\n\nYour Royal Highness, my Lord Reay and Lords and Gentlemen, I return you our most hearty thanks for the honour you have done us.\n\nLord George Hamilton proposed the health of \"The Royal Asiatic Society.\"\n\nHe briefly recapitulated its history, from its origin when founded about eighty years ago for the encouragement of science, literature, and the arts in relation to Asia, and specially mentioned the services it had rendered to the scholarship of the world by publishing in its Journal, amongst other valuable papers, Sir Henry Rawlinson's translation of the Cuneiform inscriptions at Nineveh. His Lordship referred to the fact that from the first the Sovereign had been a Patron of the Society, and pointed out the appropriateness of their action in establishing a gold medal in recognition of distinguished services in Oriental research in commemoration of the Jubilee of Queen Victoria\u2014a result due in no small degree to the support received from Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy and other friends of the Society in Bombay. His Lordship also called attention to the liberality of H.H. the Raja of Cochin, K.C.S.I., the Maharaja Gajapati Rao, C.I.E., the Raja of Parlakimedi, and other noblemen of Southern India, adding to the list the names of two then present, viz., the Hon. Maharaja of Bobbili, K.C.I.E., and the Hon. Sir Ramaswamay Mudaliyar, C.I.E., which enabled the Royal Asiatic Society to found at the principal Public Schools in this country prizes for the encouragement of Indian studies, a scheme which might lead to important and wide-reaching results.\n\nHis Lordship, in concluding, called attention to the practical value of the work of the Society as drawing nearer the bonds between East and West, in illustration of which he had only to point to the representative character of the distinguished company\nassembled by the Society under the auspices of the Duke of Connaught.\n\nIn responding Professor Macdonell said:\n\nAt this late stage of the evening I must limit myself to a few remarks on the aims of the Society, the studies with which it is identified, and some of the most striking results of those studies.\n\nTo the British Empire, with its vast Asiatic interests and responsibilities, the existence of a Society such as ours is of peculiar importance. For its main object is to make known and interpret to the West the life and thought of the East, which are so fundamentally different from our own. The work of the Society is, however, by no means of a purely abstract character, calculated merely to satisfy intellectual curiosity. On the contrary, it has a distinctly practical aspect. For only intimate knowledge of the languages, modes of thought, and institutions of the governed can render our rule sympathetic and beneficent in the fullest sense. Moreover, by widening our mental horizon, the researches with which this Society is concerned promote enlightenment and so help forward the general progress of mankind. Thus, the study of the languages and inscriptions of ancient India have led to several important discoveries in this direction. We now know that the numerical figures and the decimal system with which the whole world reckons is a debt we owe to India. We now know that the extensive literature of fairy tales and fables which exercised so far-reaching an influence on the intellectual life of medi\u00e6val Europe was for the most part an importation from India. We also know that chess, the most intellectual of games, made its way, at about the same period, from India to Europe. Again, the investigation of the Sanskrit language and literature gave rise, in the last century, to two new and important sciences, the comparative science of religion and comparative philology. The latter science has brought to light the remarkable fact that English, the language of the extreme north-west of Europe and now the official language of India, is derived from the same source as the vernaculars of nearly the whole of that vast country\u2014Marathi, Gujerati, Hindi, Bengali, and the rest.\n\nThe Society has already accomplished much, but much still remains to be done; for example, in encouraging the publication of trustworthy texts and translations of Oriental works, the scientific direction of arch\u00e6ological explorations and investigations, the organization of lectures calculated to arouse a more general interest\nin Oriental studies. The Journal of the Society is an important element in its work. Thanks to the efforts of our Secretary, Professor Rhys Davids, it has for several years maintained a high level of excellence. Not long ago a distinguished German Sanskrit scholar remarked to me that it is now the best Oriental Journal on Indian matters. I may add, in conclusion, that this Society has noted with gratitude the liberality with which Indian Princes have of late years been encouraging the objects which the Society has in view; they will doubtless continue to do so to a still greater extent, the more clearly they see the importance of preserving the records, both literary and archaeological, of their ancient civilization, which has been shown to occupy so important a place in the history of human development.\n\nI beg to thank Lord George Hamilton for the kind words in which His Lordship has expressed his appreciation of the labours of the Society and of myself, its spokesman on the present occasion.\n\nThe Chairman announced that the following gracious reply had been received to the telegram sent earlier in the evening:\n\n\"The King thanks Lord Reay, President, the Royal Asiatic Society, and the Indian Princes who with other Indian representatives were guests of the Society to-night, for their message of loyal congratulations.\"\n\nKnollys.\n\nLord Reay proposed \"The Members of the Committee.\" He said:\n\nEveryone knows the great number of details that have to be settled in organizing a dinner of this kind. Only those who may have had a similar experience know how many important and delicate points have to be determined before those details can be properly dealt with. I am sure you will all agree with me that we owe cordial thanks to Sir Steuart Bayley, the Chairman of the Banquet Committee, upon whose sound judgment the success of this evening's entertainment has so largely depended. And we do not forget the services of the members of the Committee, upon whom also so much of the hard labour has fallen. Gentlemen, I give you \"The Banquet Committee\"; and would couple with the toast, at the special request of Sir Steuart Bayley, the name of Mr. A. N. Wollaston, the Vice-Chairman of the Committee.\nMr. A. N. WOLLASTON said:\u2014\n\nIt is the wish, and therefore the command, of Lord Reay that I should address you a few words; to use the glowing imagery of the East, \"I am yoked to the plough of duty.\" Permit me, therefore, in the name of the Royal Asiatic Society, to welcome you here to-night and to express our satisfaction at this splendid gathering; to each and all of you our warmest thanks are due. The Asiatic Society bear a learned\u2014a very learned\u2014reputation, and there is a general idea that a person is not eligible for membership unless possessing a knowledge of so many Eastern tongues as to qualify for a prominent position in building the Tower of Babel. I wish any poor words of mine could remove such an erroneous impression and lead a wider circle of those interested in our Indian Empire to join our ranks; this would indeed be a glorious return for our efforts of this evening. Once again I most cordially thank you.\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nOF\n\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND:\n\nFOUNDED, March, 1823.\n\nCORRECTED TO 1st JANUARY, 1902.\n\n22, ALBEMARLE STREET,\nLONDON.\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nPATRON:\nHIS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THE KING.\n\nVICE-PATRON:\nH.R.H.
