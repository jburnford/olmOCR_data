H. Medhurst, Esq., President.\nAlex. Wylie, Esq.,\nGeo. F. Seward, Esq., Vice-Presidents.\nT. G. Smith, Esq., Secretary.\nJ. E. Reding, Esq., Treasurer.\nH. Cordier, Esq., Librarian.\nW. B. Pryer, Esq., Curator.\nRev. J. Thomas,\nD. J. Macgowan, M.D.\nT. W. Kingsmill, Esq.,\nA. J. Little, Esq.,\nE. C. Taintor, Esq.,\nF. B. Johnson, Esq., Councillors.\n\nDuring the year only four meetings have been held; at which the following papers were read:\n\n\"Elucidations of Marco Polo's Travels in North-China, drawn from Chinese sources,\"\u2014by Rev. Archimandrite Palladius.\n\"Notes made on a tour through Shan-hai and Shen-hsi,\"\u2014by Rev. C. Holcombe.\n\"Short notes on the identification of the Yu\u00e8-ti and Kiang tribes of Ancient Chinese History,\"\u2014by T. W. Kingsmill, Esq.\n\"Notice of the Medi\u00e6val Geography and History of Central and Western Asia; drawn from Chinese and Mongol writings, and compared with the observations of Western authors in the Middle ages,\"\u2014by E. Bretschneider, Esq. M.D.\nThree members have joined the Society;\u2014five have resigned. The Treasurer also reports a falling off in the aggregate yearly subscriptions.\n\nThe present list of members consists of thirteen honorary\u2014thirty-four corresponding\u2014sixty-six resident\u2014and seventy-six non-resident.\n\nA list of the members is herewith attached.\n\nFor contributions to the Library, see the Librarian's Report. Appended also are the Curator's and Treasurer's Reports, the latter shewing a balance in hand of $238.16.\n\nThe retiring officers recommend that some effort should be made during the ensuing year, to secure an accession of subscribers; there being many residents who would undoubtedly join the Institution, if made fully aware of its purposes and generally useful character.\n\n---\n\nLibrarian's Report.\n\nI have to mention the important addition to the Library of a collection of the *Journal Asiatique*,\u2014of a file, nearly complete, of the *Shanghai Evening Courier* and the *Shanghai Weekly Budget*,\u2014and a set of the publications of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. These valuable donations, the contributions of a few generous authors, and the Transactions of learned Societies, are almost all we have to mention in the list of additions appended to these remarks.\n\nDuring the last five years, the Society has endeavoured to enlist public sympathy and patronage to a greater extent, pointing out the wants of the Library in its annual reports; but the various appeals made have not fully realized the looked-for result. Unremitting attention and care have been bestowed upon the Library of the Asiatic Society; but the time thus spent, if not responded to on the part of the community, by a show of interest in its only literary and scientific institution, is uphill work, and naturally becomes disheartening.\n\nThat the Library meets a real want is proved by the great increase in the number of works consulted or lent out, as shown by the register kept for the purpose.\n\nHENRI CORDIER,\n\nHon.

Librarian, N.-C.B.R.A.S.\n\nSHANGHAI, 31st December, 1875.\n\nCurator's Report.\n\nDuring the last twelve months, we have made considerable addi-\ntions to our set-up collection of birds and other animals; and we\nhave also laid by a considerable number of skins for exchange and\nother purposes. Most of the birds commonest around Shanghai\nare wanted by Museums at home; and although not many of the\ncontributions we almost daily receive are required by ourselves, a\ngreat many skins are set aside for transmission to England. I\nhave in fact received a letter from Mr. Janson the naturalist, asking\nme on behalf of the British Museum authorities, for any skins we\ncan spare, of all our nonmigratory birds.\n\nThe additions to our other departments have not been large, but\nnow that we have the two more interesting divisions\u2014Mammals\nand Birds\u2014well in hand, there will be more time to attend to\nother classes.\nThe case of skins sent to England last spring, arrived back here about two months ago; and aided by the books purchased last spring, and the kind help of Mr. J. P. Martin, who lent several valuable works of reference, and gave his personal assistance besides, the work of naming the various specimens has progressed well, and I am enabled to present with this report, a catalogue of the birds and other animals in the Museum. It has been somewhat hurriedly got up, as the time for having it printed was shortened by the Chinese new-year's holidays.\n\nThe chief difficulty to any one taking an interest in the study of Natural History in China, is the absence of works of reference whereby specimens obtained can be identified. About the most useful of the books existing, for this purpose, are Bentham's Flora Hongkongensis, Gunther's Reptiles of British India, and Jerden's Mammals and Birds of India. Besides these, there are articles, descriptive notices and paragraphs of all kinds bearing on Chinese Natural History, scattered among the various scientific journals of Europe and America. As an instance of this extreme difficulty of getting correct information, I may mention that, although for years aided by some of the best Entomologists at home, my collection of Lepidoptera is not above one-sixth identified yet; a great many of the others are probably new to science, and the remainder are referred to in scientific publications in all the languages of Europe.\n\nThe creation of a Museum in Shanghai is evidently the first and a very large step towards meeting this difficulty. As a centre for giving information on all subjects connected with Natural History in China, it should be invaluable; but something more even than this is needed; the information gained at the Museum should be made available to dwellers at the out-ports; and for this purpose it is desirable that as soon as the Museum has something like a fair collection of the Chinese representatives of all the orders, a catalogue should be issued of all the specimens, accompanied by plates, descriptions, illustrations and remarks generally, when needed. This work if accurately prepared, would be one of the most valuable additions to the science of Natural History ever published.\n\nThe little list of names we have just prepared therefore, must be looked upon as interesting, not on account of its size or the somewhat scanty information it gives, but as the first publication of the Museum, in an endeavour to collect into one book, all the information to be obtained regarding Chinese Zoology and Natural History generally.\n\nW.

ARCHIMANDRITE PALLADIUS.\n\nI INTEND in the following notes to verify, by means of Chinese documents, some of Marco Polo's statements regarding his route from Lobnor, to Shangtu in the northern part of China proper. I do not undertake to explain all the dark and doubtful points in the narrative of the celebrated traveller, but merely offer some information in as far as my acquaintance with Chinese literature may enable me. The abundant and multifarious material found in this literature is well nigh inexhaustible; but a considerable collection of books and a good deal of time are required, to admit of the systematical research necessary for the solution of the questions before us. As a basis for my investigations, I have chosen Col. H. Yule's work, *The Book of Ser Marco Polo*, etc., London, 1871. The vast work of this learned commentator obviates the necessity of discussing many questions which have already been solved by him with the sound critical judgment which distinguishes his conclusions.\n\nBook I.\n\nCh. XXXVIII.\u2014Charchan.\n\n\"Charchan is a Province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east and east. The people worship Mahommet. There are numerous towns and villages, and the chief city of the kingdom bears its name, Charchan. The Province contains rivers which bring down jasper and chaledony, and these are carried for sale into Cathay.\"\n\n* Read before the Society on January 20th, 1875.\nwhere they fetch great prices. The whole of the Province is sandy, and so is the road all the way from Pein, and much of the water that you find is bitter and bad. However at some places you do find fresh and sweet water. When an army passes through the land, the people escape with their wives, children, and cattle a distance of two or three days' journey into the sandy waste; and knowing the spots where water is to be had they are able to live there, and to keep their cattle alive, whilst it is impossible to discover them; for the wind immediately blows the sand over their track.\" (Vol. i, p. 178.)\n\nSuch a name is not met with, either on the 16th century map* or in other extant geographical documents relating to the Mongol period; a name similar to it occurs for the first time in a description of the route from China to the west, as far as the Mediterranean Sea, compiled in the time of the Ming dynasty.\u2020 Eight hundred and fifty li west of Turfan, the town Karahashitie is mentioned in the itinerary. To the south of this town, it is further stated, is a river \u626f\u529b\u660c Ch'e-li-ch'ang. Two hundred li further on (west) is mentioned \u9ed1\u6c34\u6cc9 He-shui-ts'ien \"Black-water's source.\" To the north of this is the town of \u4e49\u529b\u5931 Ch'a-li-shi, and to the south, the town of \u626f\u529b\u660c Ch'e-li-ch'ang.\n\nThree hundred li west of the Black-water's source, is mentioned the well of \u5bdf\u529b\u5bdf Ch'a-li-ch'a; and to the north, \u706b\u70df\u5c71 Ho-yen shan \"the Mountain of Fire.\" There is no necessity to see in this \"Mountain of Fire,\" the mountain \u9152\u7802\u5c71 Nao-sha shan, which lies a hundred li north of Kutch. Chinese geographers state that \"burning caverns\" are found in the mountain range of \u5929\u5c71 Tien shan, on the whole distance from Turfan to Kutch.\u00a7\n\n* Appended to the \u6d77\u56fd\u56fe\u5fd7 Hai kuo tu chi, and to vol iv of the Contributions of the members of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission, Peking.\n\n\u2020 This itinerary, published with some modifications during the present dynasty, is appended to the extensive work, \u5929\u4e0b\u90fd\u56fd\u5229\u75c5\u4e66 T'ien hia kiun ko li ping shu, or \"Strategetical Description of China (commenced in 1639, terminated in 1662).\" There exist also manuscript copies of this itinerary, but they are, like the printed work, full of errors and discrepancies. The compilation of this itinerary, or at least the principal information contained in it, must belong to the beginning of the 16th century. It is mentioned in the \u7687\u660e\u5927\u653f\u7eaa Hwang ming ta ching ki, that in 1415, \u9648\u8aa0 Ch'en Ch'ing returned from the western countries after three years' travels, and that he wrote a detailed description of the countries he visited. This description probably served as a groundwork for the itinerary. There was another traveller, \u5b89\u5fd7\u9053 An Chi-tao, who was despatched to Tamerlan in 1395, and returned in 1407; he also wrote a description of the western countries; but it was not published even in the time of the Ming dynasty. Vide \u91ce\u7372\u7de8 Ye ho pien.\n\n\u2021 See \u56de\u7586\u901a\u5fd7 Hui kiang tung chi, and other works.\nThere seems to be no doubt that Ch'e-li-ch'ang is the \"Charchan\" of Marco Polo, and that it is to be found in the present province of Karashar.\n\nCh. XXXIX.\u2014Lop, etc.\n\n\"Lop is a large town at the edge of the Desert, which is called the Desert of Lop, and is situated between east and north-east. It belongs to the Great Kaan, and the people worship Mahommet. Now, such persons as propose to cross the Desert take a week's rest in this town to refresh themselves and their cattle; and then they make ready for the journey, taking with them a month's supply for man and beast. On quitting this city they enter the Desert. The length of this Desert is so great that 'tis said it would take a year and more to ride from one end of it to the other. And here, where its breadth is least, it takes a month to cross it. 'Tis all composed of hills and valleys of sand, and not a thing to eat is to be found on it. But after riding for a day and a night you find fresh water, enough mayhap for some 50 or 100 persons with their beasts, but not for more. And all across the Desert you will find water in like manner, that is to say, in some 28 places altogether you will find good water, but in no great quantity; and in four places also you find brackish water. Beasts there are none; for there is nought for them to eat. But there is a marvellous thing related of this Desert, which is that when travellers are on the move by night, and one of them chances to lag behind or to fall asleep or the like, when he tries to gain his company again he will hear spirits talking, and will suppose them to be his comrades. Sometimes the spirits will call him by name; and thus shall a traveller oftimes be led astray so that he never finds his party. And in this way many have perished. [Sometimes the stray travellers will hear as it were the tramp and hum of a great cavalcade of people away from the real line of road, and taking this to be their own company they will follow the sound; and when day breaks they find that a cheat has been put on them and that they are in an ill plight.] Even in the daytime one hears those spirits talking. And sometimes you shall hear the sound of a variety of musical instruments, and still more commonly the sound of drums. [Hence in making this journey 'tis customary for travellers to keep close together. All the animals, too have bells at their necks, so that they cannot easily get astray. And at sleeping time a signal is put up to show the direction of the next march.]\" (Pp. 180, 181.)\n\nNeither Chinese history nor Chinese geography contains any mention of the existence of the city of Lop, near the lake of this name. The descriptions of Chinese travellers do not show that the shores of this lake are inhabited at present; the only inhabitants of this locality,\u2014half-savage people numbering several hundred families,\u2014are settled on two little islands in the lake. The villages nearest to the lake are on the basin of the river Tarim, and the line of military posts, which begins at \u6566\u714c\nTun-hwang (the ancient \u9102\u5dde Sha-chow), and turns round the southern part of Lobnor, extends to the Tarim. It may be that in the time of Marco Polo, caravans used to stop on this river also, and proceeded thence by the present line of posts through the desert as far as Sha-chow.\n\nThis desert was known in China of old by the name of \u6d41\u6c99 Lew-sha, i.e., \"Quick-sand,\" or literally \"Flowing sands.\" In Chinese traditions the name of this desert occurs earlier than that of \u6c99\u6f20 Sha-mo, the sandy region of Mongolia. Lew-sha is the western prolongation of Sha-mo; it stretches further south, into Kukunor, under the name of Mo-hai or Mo-ho-yen desert,* gradually diminishing in size; from thence it stretches east, to the sources of the Yellow River, and terminates in a curve on the north. A Chinese traveller, in the time of the T'ang dynasty, saw this termination on his way to Lhassa, or as he calls it, this tail of the great desert; he states that in that place, the desert is not over fifty li wide.\u2020 The Lew-sha was the subject of various most exaggerated stories. We find more reliable accounts of it in the \u5468\u66f8 Chow shu; thus it is mentioned in that history, that there sometimes arises in this desert a \"burning wind,\" pernicious to men and cattle; in such cases the old camels of the caravan, having a presentiment of its approach, flock shrieking to one place, lie down on the ground and hide their heads in the sand; on this signal, the travellers also lie down, close nose and mouth, and remain in this position until the hurricane abates; unless these precautions are taken, men and beasts inevitably perish.\n\nCh. XL.\u2014Sachiu.\n\n\"After you have travelled thirty days through the Desert as I have described, you come to a city called Sachiu lying between the north-east and east; it belongs to the Great Kaan, and is in a province called Tangut. The people are for the most part Idolaters, but there are also some Nestorian Christians and some Saracens. The Idolaters have a peculiar language, and are no traders, but live by their agriculture. They have a great many abbeys and minsters full of idols of sundry fashions, to which they pay great honour and reverence, worshipping them and sacrificing to them with much ado. For example, such as have children will feed up a sheep in honour of the idol, and at the New Year, or on the day of the Idol's Feast, they will take their children and the sheep about with them into the presence of the idol with great ceremony. Then they will have the sheep slaughtered and cooked, and again present it before the idol with like reverence, and leave\n\n* \u8607\u5dde\u5fd7 Su chow chi, \"Description of Suchow.\" 1737.\n\u2020 \u518c\u5e9c\u5143\u9f9c Tz'e fu yuen kui, a collection of the Sung dynasty;\u2014in the division on Embassies.\nit there before him, whilst they are reciting the offices of their worship, and their prayers for the idol's blessing on their children. And if you will believe them the idol feeds on the meat that is set before it! After these ceremonies they take up the flesh and carry it home, and call together all their kindred, to eat it with them in great festivity [the idol-priests receiving for their portion the head, feet, entrails, and skin, with some part of the meat]. After they have eaten they collect the bones that are left and store them carefully in a hutch.\" (P. 184.)\n\n\u6c99\u5dde Sha-chow, the present \u6566\u714c\u7e23 Tun-hwang hien (a few li east of the ancient town), has since the Han dynasty always been considered a very important point; chiefly because all the roads leading to China from the west passed through it; later accounts also confirm the statement that Tun-hwang lies on an important cross-road. Besides communication with Lobnor, it has a desert road to Turfan and another through Sertennor to Kukunor.* In 1820, or about that time, an attempt was made to re-establish the ancient direct way between Sha-chow and Khotan. With this object in view an exploring party of ten men was sent from Khotan towards Sha-chow; this party wandered in the desert over a month and found neither dwellings nor roads, but pastures and water everywhere.\u2020 M. Polo omits to mention a remarkable place at Sha-chow, a sandy hillock (a short distance south of this town) known under the name of \u9cf4\u6c99\u5c71 Ming-sha shan,\u2014the \"rumbling sand hill.\" The sand in rolling down the hill produces a particular sound similar to that of distant thunder.\u2021 In M. Polo's time (1292), Khubilai removed the inhabitants of Sha-chow to the interior of China; \u00a7 fearing probably the aggression of the seditious princes; and his successor, in 1303, placed there a garrison of ten thousand men.|| Some time later granaries were established there, for the supply of the military posts over the site of the present Djungaria. During the emperor K'ien-lung's reign, the Tun-hwang district was colonized on a vast scale; in 1830 it numbered about a hundred thousand inhabitants.\u00b6\n\nCh. XLI.\u2014Camul.\n\n\"Camul is a province which in former days was a kingdom. It contains numerous towns and villages, but the chief city bears the name of Camul. The province lies between two deserts; for on the one side is the Great Desert of Lop, and\n\n* Su chow chi.\n\u2020 \u6566\u714c\u7e23\u5fd7 Tun hwang hien chi,\u2014in fine.\n\u2021 Tun hwang hien chi.\n\u00a7 \u7d93\u901a\u7d93\u7def\u81ea Siu t'ung kien kong mu.\n|| Ib.\n\u00b6 Tun hwang hien chi.\non the other side is a small desert of three days' journey in extent. The people are all Idolaters, and have a peculiar language. They live by the fruits of the earth, which they have in plenty, and dispose of to travellers. They are a people who take things very easily, for they mind nothing but playing and singing and dancing and enjoying themselves. And it is a truth that if a foreigner comes to the house of one of these people to lodge, the host is delighted, and desires his wife to put herself entirely at the guest's disposal, whilst he himself gets out of the way, and comes back no more until the stranger shall have taken his departure. The guest may stay and enjoy the wife's society as long as he lists, whilst the husband has no shame in the matter, but indeed considers it an honour. And all the men of this province are made wittolos by their wives in this way. The women themselves are fair and wanton. Now it came to pass during the reign of Mangu Kaan, that as lord of this province he came to hear of this custom, and hesent forth an order commanding them under grievous penalties to do so no more [but to provide public hostelries for travellers]. And when they heard this order they were much vexed thereat. [For about three years' space they carried it out. But then they found that their lands were no longer fruitful, and that many mis-haps befell them.] So they collected together and prepared a grand present which they sent to their Lord, praying him graciously to let them retain the custom which they had inherited from their ancestors; for it was by reason of this usage that their gods bestowed upon them all the good things that they possessed, and without it they saw not how they could continue to exist. When the Prince had heard their petition his reply was: 'Since ye must needs keep your shame, keep it then,' and so he left them at liberty to maintain their naughty custom. And they always have kept it up, and do so still.\" (P. 189, 190.)\n\nSpeaking of Hami, M. Polo describes a strange custom of the Uigurs, originating in a perverted notion of hospitality. It is remarkable that the Chinese author Hung Hao, who lived a century before M. Polo, makes mention in his memoirs nearly in the same words of this custom of the Uigurs, with whom he became acquainted during his captivity in the kingdom of the Kin. According to the chronicle of the Tangut kingdom of Si-hia, Hami was the nursery of Buddhism in Si-hia and provided this kingdom with Buddhist books and monks.\n\nCh. XLII.\u2014Chingintalas.\n\n\"Chingintalas is also a province at the verge of the Desert, and lying between north-west and north. It has an extent of sixteen days' journey, and belongs to the Great Kaan, and contains numerous towns and villages. There are three different races of people in it\u2014Idolaters, Saracens, and some Nestorian Christians. At the\n\n* Sung mo ki wen.\n+ Si hia shu shi. Edit. 1826.\nnorthern extremity of this province there is a mountain in which are excellent veins of steel and ondanique. And you must know that in the same mountain there is a vein of the substance from which Salamander is made. For the real truth is that the Salamander is no beast, as they allege in our part of the world, but is a substance found in the earth; and I will tell you about it.\" (Pp. 191, 192.)\n\nSupposing that M. Polo mentions this place on his way from Sha-chow to Su-chow, it is natural to think that it is Chi'kin talas i.e. \"Chi-kin plain\" or valley; \u8d64\u65a4 Chi-kin was the name of a lake,* called so even now, and of a defile, which received its name from the lake. The latter is on the way from \u5609\u5cea\u95dc Kia-yu kwan to \u5b89\u897f\u5dde An-si chow. The first mention of the name Chi-kin occurs, as far as I know, in Chinese history, only after the expulsion of the Mongols from China. When the armies of the new (Ming) dynasty were driving out the Mongols from the frontiers of China proper, they found beyond the barrier of Kia-yu kwan several Mongol aymaks (clans), which at once declared themselves subject to the new dynasty; among them was an aymak settled near lake Chi-kin, and composed of five hundred families; the military post \u8d64\u65a4\u885b Chi-kin wei was formed of this aymak, the chief of which, whose father had the honorary title of \u627f\u76f8 Ch'ing-siang, i.e. \"Minister,\" was appointed commander of the post. This happened in 1370 to 1380;\u2020 and since that time a separate chapter was devoted to Chi-kin wei and \u8d64\u65a4\u8499\u53e4 Chi-kin mung-ku \"the Mongols of Chi-kin,\" in all the historical and geographical works of the Ming dynasty. Towards the middle of the 15th century, the Djagataian sultans or beks, having taken possession of Eastern Turkestan, drove out of Hami the Chingiskhanides of the eastern branch, and made incursions as far as Su-chow. The Ming government then removed the Chi-kin and other Mongols to the interior of China, and settled them in the district of Su-chow, in the same way as the emperors Kang-hi and Yung-ching of the present dynasty removed the descendents of these very Djagataians to \u7518\u8085 Kan-su, in consequence of the invasions they suffered on the part of the Djungars. During the war with the Djungars Kang-hi re-established the military post of Chi-kin, but when peace was re-established,\n\n* Chikin, or more correctly Chigin, is a Mongol word, meaning \"ear;\" there was in Mongolia a Chigin ola, \"Ear mountain,\" i.e., a hill bearing a resemblance to an ear; it is probable that the lake has received this name on the same ground. The above-mentioned itinerary observes that there are two Chikin lakes, the great and the little one.\n\n\u2020 \u5927\u660e\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7 Ta ming i t'ung chi,\u2014\u7687\u660e\u5f9e\u4fe1\u9304 Hwang ming ts'ung sin lu, etc.\nthe post was reduced to a postal station, and placed under the administration of An-si.* During the Ming dynasty, Chi-kin was renowned for some natural products, \u786b\u7802 kang-sha \"sal ammoniac,\" \u77f3\u6cb9 shi-yew \"petroleum,\" \u9396\u84c9 te'ung-yung \"orobanche,\" gold sand found in the northern \"Black hills,\" etc.+ Thus the Chinese accounts of Chi-kin are not in contradiction to the statements given by M. Polo regarding the same subject; but when the distances are taken into consideration, a serious difficulty arises; Chi-kin is two hundred and fifty or sixty li distant from Su-chow, whilst according to M. Polo's statement, ten days are necessary to cross this distance. One of the three following explanations of this discordance must be admitted: either Chingintalas is not Chi-kin, or the traveller's memory failed, or lastly an error crept into the number of days' journey. The two last suppositions I consider the most probable; the more so that similar difficulties occur several times in Marco Polo's narrative. However, having set forth the data, I leave it to readers who have thoroughly studied Marco Polo's work, to draw their own conclusion from them.\n\nCh. XLIII.\u2014Sukchur.\n\n\"At the end of those ten days you come to another province called Sukchur, in which there are numerous towns and villages. The chief city is called Sukchu. The people are partly Christians and partly Idolaters, and all are subject to the Great Kaan. The great General Province to which all these three provinces belong is called TANGUT. Over all the mountains of this province rhubarb is found in great abundance, and thither merchants come to buy it, and carry it thence all over the world. [Travellers, however, dare not visit those mountains with any cattle but those of the country, for a certain plant grows there which is so poisonous that cattle which eat it lose their hoofs. The cattle of the country know it and eschew it.] The people live by agriculture, and have not much trade. [They are of a brown complexion. The whole of the province is healthy.]\" (P. 196.)\n\n\u856d\u5dde Su-chow, as a transit-trade point, was always an important town, from the number of its inhabitants and its wealth. Marco Polo, however, does not speak favourably of it,\u2021 and he is right; in his time this town could not yet have recovered from the Mongol devastation of 1226. Chingis khan, on his return from the western countries, laid waste by fire and sword the country from modern Ning-hia to Sha-chow, to avenge the refusal\n\n* \u5927\u6e05\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7 Ta ts'ing i t'ung chi, and Su chow chi.\n+ \u6f5b\u7f85\u985e\u66f8 Tsien k'io lui shu, \"Cyclopedia,\" edit. 1830, art.\u2014Su chow chi, etc.\n\u2021 \"It has not much trade.\"\nof the king of Si-hia to join him in his campaign in the west. Irritated by the obstinate defence of Su-chow by its inhabitants, he slaughtered them all, men and women, young and old, after the town was captured.* With respect to rhubarb, of which M. Polo speaks, the \u9806\u5dde\u5fd7 Su chow chi also makes the remark, that the best rhubarb, with golden flowers in the breaking, is gathered in this province (district of \u5c71\u4e39 Shan-tan), and that it is equally beneficial to men and beasts, preserving them from the pernicious effects of the heat. M. Polo notices that the cattle not indigenous to the province lose their hoofs in the Su-chow mountains; but that is probably not on account of some poisonous grass, but in consequence of the stony ground. The Chinese envoy Kao Kiu-hui, when travelling in A.D. 981, from Kan-chow to Su-chow, fastened wooden shoes to his horses' hoofs, and tied yak's skin round and under the camels' feet.\u2020 The Su chow chi contains the following remarks on cattle-breeding in that province: \"It cannot be said that horses and horned cattle breed here successfully; mules brought from other provinces are sometimes of extraordinary strength, so that they can carry burdens of from seven to eight hundred kins weight;\u2021 but they soon perish, the climate not agreeing with them. Yaks are bred by the Tanguts (settled in the Su-chow province), but they cannot be made use of by our cultivators; it being impossible to employ them in the fields, as they are not accustomed to our fodder. The cross breed of the yak and the common cow is a strong one;\u00a7 and fit both for agricultural purposes and for carrying burdens. The ordinary mode of conveyance here is on donkeys; military provisions are carried on them to Hami and Barkul; the transports leave in spring, and return in autumn. (1737).\"\n\nCh. XLIV.\u2014Campichu.\n\n\"Campichu is also a city of Tangut, and a very great and noble one. Indeed it is the capital and place of government of the whole province of Tangut. The people are Idolaters, Saracens, and Christians, and the latter have three very fine churches in the city, whilst the Idolaters have many minsters and abbeys after their fashion. In these they have an enormous number of idols, both small and great, certain of the latter being a good ten paces\n\n* \u897f\u590f\u66f8\u4e8b Si hia shu shi, Annals, and Biography of Li-kung, a relative of the Tangut kings of Si-hia. His forefather betrayed his king and went over to Chingis khan; he was with him at the siege of Su-chow. It is stated in this biography, that Chingis khan spared a hundred and five families in Su-chow.\n\n\u2020 \u4e94\u4ee3\u53f2\u8a18 Wu tai shi ki.\n\n\u2021 About 1,000 lbs.;\u2014somewhat incredible.\n\n\u00a7 In Ch. lvii, M. Polo says the same in reference to \u897f\u5be7 Si-ning.\nin stature; some of them being of wood, others of clay, and others yet of stone. They are all highly polished, and then covered with gold. The great idols of which I speak lie at length. And round about them there are other figures of considerable size, as if adoring and paying homage before them.\" (Pp. 197, 198.)\n\nKan-chow has occupied rather an important place in the history of North China. In the beginning of the 11th century it was the residence of an Uigur prince. It fell under the Tangut dominion in 1208.* The temple, in which M. Polo saw an idol of Buddha, represented in a lying position, is evidently Wo-fo-sze, i.e., \"Monastery of the lying Buddha.\" It was built in 1103 by a Tangut queen, to place there three idols representing Buddha in this posture, which have since been found in the ground on this very spot.\u2020 Through Kan-chow was the shortest, and most direct and convenient road to I-tsi-nay. The latter post used to be also furnished with provisions through Kan-chow.\u00a7\n\nCh. XLV.\u2014Etzina.\n\n\"When you leave the city of Campichu, you ride for twelve days, and then reach a city called Etzina, which is towards the north on the verge of the Sandy Desert; it belongs to the Province of Tangut. The people are Idolaters, and possess plenty of camels and cattle, and the country produces a number of good falcons, both Sakers and Lanners. The inhabitants live by their cultivation and their cattle, for they have no trade. At this city you must needs lay in victuals for forty days, because when you quit Etzina you enter on a Desert which extends forty days' journey to the north, and on which you meet with no habitation nor baiting-place. In the summer-time, indeed, you will fall in with people, but in the winter the cold is too great. You also meet with wild beasts (for there are some small pine-woods here and there), and with numbers of wild asses.\" (P. 202.)\n\nI-tsi-nay, or Echin\u00e9, is properly the name of a lake. Khubilai, disquieted by his factious relatives on the north, established a military post near lake I-tsi-nay, and built a town, or a fort on the south-western shore of this lake. The name of I-tsi-nay appears from that time; it does not occur in the chronicle of the Tangut kingdom; the lake had then another name. Vestiges of the town are seen to this day; the buildings were of large dimensions, and some of them were very fine.\u00a7 In M. Polo's time there existed a direct route from I-tsi-nay to Kharakhorum; traces of this road are still noticeable, but it is no more used.|| This\n\n* Si hia shu shi, Anno.\n\u2020 Si hia shu shi.\n\u2021 Siu t'ung kien kang mu.\n\u00a7 Su chow chi.\n|| Ib.\u2014The displacing of the political centres, and consequently of those\ncircumstance, i.e., the existence of a road from I-tsi-nay to Kharakhorum, probably led M. Polo to make an excursion (a mental one, I suppose) to the residence of the khans in Northern Mongolia.\n\nCh. XLVI\u2014Caracoron.\n\n\"Caracoron is a city some three miles in compass. [It is surrounded by a strong earthen rampart, for stone is scarce there. And beside it there a great citadel wherein is a fine palace in which the Governor resides.] 'Tis the first city that the Tartars possessed after they issued from their own country.\" (Pp. 203, 204.)\n\nEverything that the studious Chinese authors could gather and say of the situation of Kharakhorum is collected in two Chinese works, \u843d\u99d5\u6a13\u6587\u7a3f Lo fung low wen kao (1849), and \u8499\u53e4\u904a\u7267\u8a18 Mung ku yew mu ki (1859). However, no positive conclusion can be derived from these researches, chiefly in consequence of the absence of a tolerably correct map of Northern Mongolia.*\n\nCh. LI.\n\n\"You should be told also that all the Grand Kaans, and all the descendants of Chinghis their first Lord, are carried to a mountain that is called Altay to be interred. Wheresoever the Sovereign may die, he is carried to his burial in that mountain with his predecessors; no matter, if the place of his death were 100 days' journey distant, thither must he be carried to his burial.\" (P. 227.)\n\nThere are no accurate indications in the documents of the Mongol period on the burial-places of Chingis khan and of the khans who succeeded him. The \u5143\u53f2 Yuan shi, or \"History of the Mongol dynasty in China,\" in speaking of the burial of the khans,\n\nof trade, was followed by a change in the general direction of the routes across the desert. The emperor Kang-hi, who carried on a long struggle with the Dzungars, traced out several military roads across the Mongolian desert in various directions, in 1697. The route from \u6f22\u5dde\u5e9c Liang-chow fu to I-tsi-nay, and farther to the north-west was explored (v. So mo fang lio). In 1719 communications were established from Kuku hoton towards Barkul; this route is described in the Ts'ung si ki lio (translated into Russian by M. P. S. Popoff). Trade was not slow in availing itself of the new routes; the northern limit of I-tsi-nay became the meeting place of caravans from Kuku hoton and Lan-chow fu, on their way to Burkul and Urumtsi. Vide Su chow chi and Mung ku yew mu ki.\n\n* M. Paderin (Secretary to the Russian Consulate, Urga) has recently, on his way from Urga to Uliasutai, set himself to the task of finding the site of Kharakhorum, in following partly the indication contained in the diary of Chang Te-hui, 1248 (the diary is translated and inserted in the Records of the Siberian Branch of the Russ. Geogr. Society, Irkutsk, 1867). His efforts were apparently crowned with success; it is to be regretted that he had no means to determine astronomically the site; his report is probably already published by the Geographical Society of Petersburg.\nmentions only that they used to be conveyed from Peking to the north, to their common burial-ground in the K'i-lien valley. This name cannot have anything in common with the ancient K'i-lien of the Hiung-nu, a hill situated to the west of the Mongol desert; the K'i-lien of the Mongols is to be sought more to the east. When Khubilai marched out against Prince Nayan, and reached the modern Talnor, news was received of the occupation of the khans' burial-ground by the rebels. They held out there very long, which exceedingly afflicted Khubilai;* and this goes to prove that the tombs could not be situated much to the west. Some more positive information on this subject is found in the diary of the campaign in Mongolia in 1410, of the Ming Emperor Yung-lo.\u2020 He reached the Kerulen in the place where this river, after running south, takes an easterly direction. The author of the diary notes, that from a place one march and a half before reaching the Kerulen, a very large mountain was visible to the north-east, and at its foot a solitary, high and pointed hillock, covered with stones. The author says, that the sovereigns of the house of Yuan used to be buried near this hill.\u2021 It may therefore be plausibly supposed, that the tombs of the Mongol khans were near the Kerulen; and that the \"K'i-lien\" of the Yuan-shi is to be applied to this locality; it seems to me even, that K'i-lien is an abbreviation, customary to Chinese authors, of Kerulen. The way of burying the Mongol khans is described in the Yuan shi (chap. On the national religious rites of the Mongols,) as well as in the Ch'ue keng lu, \"Memoirs of the time of the Yuan dynasty.\"\u00a7 When burying, the greatest care was taken to conceal from outside people the knowledge of the locality of the tomb. With this object in view, after the tomb was closed, a drove of horses was driven over it, and by this means the ground was for a considerable distance trampled down and levelled.\n\n* \u5143\u53f2\u985e\u7de8 Yuan shi lei pien.\n\u2020 \u5317\u5f81\u9304 Pe ching lu.\n\u2021 Our well-known Mongolist, N. Golovkin has told us, that according to a story actually current among the Mongols, the tombs of the former Mongol khans are situated near Tas-ola hill, equally in the vicinity of the Kerulen. He states also that even now the Mongols are accustomed to assemble on that hill on the 7th day of the 7th moon (according to an ancient custom), in order to adore Chingis khan's tomb. Altan tobchi (translated into Russian by Galsan Gomboeff), in relating the history of the Mongols after their expulsion from China, and speaking of the khans' tombs, calls them Naiman tzagan gher, i.e. \"Eight White tents\" (according to the number of chambers for the souls of the chief deceased khans in Peking), and sometimes simply Tzagan gher, \"the White tent,\" which according to the translator's explanation, denotes only Chigis khan's tomb.\n\u00a7 Extracts from these memoirs are inserted in vol. iv. of the Contributions of the members of the Russ. Eccl. Mission, Peking.\nis added to this (probably from hearsay), in the \u8349\u6728\u5b50 Ts'ao mu tze Memoirs (also of the time of the Yuan dynasty), that a young camel used to be killed (in the presence of its mother), on the tomb of the deceased khan; afterwards, when the time of the usual offerings on the tomb approached, the mother of this immolated camel was set at liberty, and she came crying to the place where it was killed; the locality of the tomb was ascertained in this way.\n\n\"Let me tell you a strange thing too. When they are carrying the body of any Emperor to be buried with the others, the convoy that goes with the body doth put to the sword all whom they fall in with on the road, saying: 'Go and wait upon your Lord in the other world!' For they do in sooth believe that all such as they slay in this manner do go to serve their Lord in the other world. They do the same too with horses; for when the Emperor dies, they kill all his best horses, in order that he may have the use of them in the other world, as they believe. And I tell you as a certain truth, that when Mongou Kaan died, more than 20,000 persons, who chanced to meet the body on its way, were slain in the manner I have told.\" (P. 217.)\n\nThe burying of living men with the dead was a general custom with the tribes of Eastern Asia. Favourite servants and wives were usually buried in this way. In China, the chief wives and those concubines who had already borne children were exempted from this lot. The Tunguz and other tribes were accustomed to kill the selected victims by strangulation. In China they used to be buried alive; but the custom of burying living men ceased in A.D. 1464.* In the time of the present Manchu dynasty, the burying of living men was prohibited by the emperor Kang-hi, at the close of the 17th century, i.e., the forced burying; but voluntary sepulture remained in force.\u2020 Notwithstanding this prohibition, cases of forced burying occurred again in remote parts of Manchuria; when a concubine refused to follow her deceased master, she was forcibly strangled with a bow-string.\u2021 I must observe, however, that there is no mention made in historical documents, of the existence of this custom with the Mongols; it is only an hypothesis based on the analogy between the religious ideas and customs of the Mongols and those of other tribes.\n\n*\u7687\u660e\u5f9e\u4fe1\u9304 Huang ming ts'ung sin lu,\u2014Ann. The \u570b\u53f2\u7565 Kwo shi liu (Koku-shi riaku) \"Abridged History of Japan,\" under A.D. 646, says, that in this year the burying of living men with the dead was prohibited, and it reproaches China with the tardy stoppage of this inhuman custom.\n\n\u2020 Yu chi wen.

LIII.\n\n\"This is the fashion of their religion. [They say there is a Most High God of Heaven, whom they worship daily with thurible and incense, but they pray to him only for health of mind and body.\" (P. 224.)\n\nThe God of Heaven is evidently the Tengri of the Mongols,\u2021 the highest object of their reverence. They used to apply to it the epithets of Dere, \"Supreme,\" and Munke, \"Eternal.\"\u00a7 The affinity of the Shaman idea of Heaven with that of the Chinese is indubitable. It does not appear, however, that Shamanism admits the idea of a personified and intelligent supreme being, similar to that existing in China, where this idea has inspired some thinkers, and raised their mind to high spiritual conceptions.\u2016 Still the acknowledgment of Heaven as the highest power, was the best side of the coarse religion of Shamanism; as the reverent awe of Heaven was the principal moral check for half savage tribes. The sacrifice to Heaven consisted in the raising of the sacrificial flesh on a stake or pole,\u00b6 and the libation of kumiss, or the milk of a white mare. The sacrificial stake is to this day the indispensable attribute of Shaman ceremonies. With the Manchus it is called somo, and is chiefly employed in the offerings to the Ongons.** It was used also in ancient Corea,\u2020\u2020 and\n\n* Yuan ch'ao pi shi (Mongol text).\n\u2020 Aritomys Bobac.\n\u2021 Dorji Banzaroff, in his dissertation \"On the Black Religion,\" i.e. Shamanism, 1846, has investigated the religious ideas of that system with all possible fullness; I deem it unnecessary therefore to repeat what has been already published by him on the subject.\n\u00a7 Yuan ch'ao pi shi, Mongol text. This ancient text (of the 18th century) is the only unquestionable authority on Mongol antiquities, the influence of extraneous elements not being noticeable in it. Later monuments of the Mongol literature, as the work of Sanang Setzen and Altan tobchi are strongly impregnated with Buddhist ideas.\n\u2016 It is sufficient to quote, for instance, the following sentence of a Confucianist: \"The Supreme Lord (Shang-ti) dwells in an unattainable depth (darkness), but his presence is flaming everywhere.\"\n\u00b6 This sacrificial stake is indubitably \"the tree, to which, as the Russian chronicles narrate, a pious Russian prince refused to bow.\"\n** \u5927\u6e05\u6703\u5178 Ta ts'ing hui tien.\n\u2020\u2020 \u6f22\u66f8 Han shu.\nis even now not unknown in the popular Corean religion.* The author of the \u8a18\u4e8b\u8a9e Y yu (middle of 16th century) relates that in his time, the Mongols used to make human offerings to Heaven. I quote his words: \"The Mongols deeply revere Heaven. . . . Before every important undertaking they offer a human sacrifice to Heaven. For this purpose they usually select a Chinaman (among the prisoners) of as fine a form as possible, strip him of his clothes and pour water over him; . . . . the victim is bound in the field, and a nimble horseman cuts his head-off at a run; his belly is then cut open, and the bowels are spread on the ground (as an offering to Heaven).\" It is difficult to vouch for the accuracy of this statement.\n\nNatigay.\n\n\"But they have [also] a certain [other] god of theirs called Natigay, and they say he is the God of the Earth, who watches over their children, cattle, and crops. They show him great worship and honour, and every man hath a figure of him in his house, made of felt and cloth; and they also make in the same manner images of his wife and children. The wife they put on the left hand, and the children in front. And when they eat, they take the fat of the meat and grease the god's mouth withal, as well as the mouths of his wife and children. Then they take of the broth and sprinkle it before the door of the house; and that done, they deem that their god and his family have had their share of the dinner.\" (P. 224.)\n\nWhether this word is to be taken as a corruption of the word Ongot (according to Yule), or as corresponding to Etugen,\u2020 is equally difficult to verify by means of ancient documents. I cannot find in the Mongol text of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi the word Ongon, or Ongot. The souls of deceased parents and ancestors are called there Ekes, i.e. \"Magnates, Lords;\" Ongon is probably of Tungusian, not Mongol origin. It is necessary to keep in view, that there exist in Shamanism not only local differences, and some belonging to certain tribes, but that in the course of time and under the influence of Buddhism, some essential changes may have happened. It is not altogether easy therefore, to judge of ancient Shamanism by that of the present day. I shall add one new variant to what the learned Col. Yule has collected and set forth with such precision, on the Shaman household gods. \"The Dahurs and Barhus have in their dwellings, according to the\n\n* \u8c61\u80e5\u7d00\u805e Siang siu ki wen.\n\u2020 Dorji Banzaroff is disposed to see in Natigay of M.

They look upon it as a divinity, for its power as Delegei in echen, i.e. \"the Lord of Earth,\" and on account of its productiveness,\u2014Allan delegei, i.e. \"Golden Earth.\"\nnumber of the male members of the family, puppets made of straw, on which eyes, eyebrows and mouth are drawn; these puppets are dressed up to the waist. When some one of the family dies, his puppet is taken out of the house, and a new puppet is made for every newly-born member of the family. On new-year's day, offerings are made to the puppets, and care is taken not to disturb them (by moving them, etc.), in order to avoid bringing sickness upon the family.\"\n\nCh. LVI.\u2014Bargu.\n\n\"And when you leave Caracoron and the Altay, in which they bury the bodies of the Tartar Sovereigns, as I told you, you go north for forty days till you reach a country called the Plain of Bargu. The people there are called Merkits; they are a very wild race, and live by their cattle, the most of which are stags, and these stags, I assure you, they use to ride upon. Their customs are like those of the Tartars, and they are subject to the Great Kaan. They have neither corn nor wine. [They get birds for food, for the country is full of lakes and pools and marshes, which are much frequented by the birds when they are moulting, and when they have quite cast their feathers and can't fly, those people catch them. They also live partly on fish.]\u201d (Pp. 236, 237.)\n\nIn the Mongol text of Chingis khan's biography, this country is called Barhu and Barhuchin; it is to be supposed, according to Col. Yule's identification of this name with the modern Barguzin, that this country was near lake Baikal. The fact that Merkits were in Bargu is confirmed by the following statement in Chingis khan's biography: \u201cWhen Chingis khan defeated his enemies the Merkits, they fled to Barhuchin tokum.\u201d Tokum signifies \u201ca hollow, a low place,\u201d according to the Chinese translation of the above-mentioned biography, made in 1381; thus Barhuchin tokum undoubtedly corresponds to M. Polo's Plain of Bargu. As to M. Polo's statement that the inhabitants of Bargu were Merkits, it cannot be accepted unconditionally. The Merkits were not indigenous to the country near Baikal, but belonged originally,\u2014according to a division set forth in the Mongol text of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi,\u2014to the category of tribes living in yurts, i.e. nomade tribes, or tribes of the desert. Meanwhile we find in the same biography of Chingis khan, mention of a people called Barhun, which belonged to the category of tribes living in the forests; and we have therefore reason to suppose that the Barhuns were the aborigines of Barhu. After the time of Chingis khan, this ethnographic name disappears from Chinese history; it appears again in the middle of the 16th century. The author of the Yu (1543-4) in enumerating the tribes inhabiting Mongolia and the\n\n*\u9ed1\u9f8d\u6c5f\u5916\u8a18 He lung kiang wai ki.\nadjacent countries, mentions the Barhu, as a strong tribe, able to supply up to several tens of thousands (!) of warriors, armed with steel swords; but the country inhabited by them is not indicated. The Mongols, it is added, call them Black Ta-tze (Khara Mongols).* At the close of the 17th century, the Barhus are found inhabiting the western slopes of the interior Hing'an, as well as between lake Kulon and river Khalkha, and dependent on a prince of eastern Khalkhas, Doro beile.\u2020 At the time of Galdan khan's invasion, a part of them fled to Siberia with the eastern Khalkhas, but afterwards they returned.\u00a7 After their rebellion in 1696, quelled by a Manchu general, they were included with other petty tribes (regarding which few researches have been made) in the category butkha, or hunters, and received a military organisation. They are divided into Old and New Barhu, according to the time when they were brought under Manchu rule. The Barhus belong to the Mongolian, not to the Tungusian race; they are sometimes considered even to have been in relationship with the Khalkhas.\u00b6 This is all the substantial information we possess on the Barhu. Is there an affinity to be found between the modern Barhus and the Barhuns of Chinggis khan's biography;\u2014and is it to be supposed, that in the course of time, they spread from lake Baikal to the Hing'an range? or is it more correct to consider them a branch of the Mongol race indigenous to the Hing'an mountains, and which received the general archaic name of Bargu, which might have pointed out the physical character of the country they inhabited,|| just as we find in history the Urianhai of Altai and the Urianhai of Western Manchuria? It is difficult to solve this question for want of historical data.\u00b6\n\nChap. LVII.\n\n\"On leaving Campichu, then, you travel five days across a tract in\n\n* i.e., \"Lower Mongols.\" On the maps of the Ming dynasty time, the name Xiao Ta-tze, or \"Little Mongols\" (near the Amur), probably designates also the Barhu.\n\n\u2020 A Manchu title, conferred on him by the emperor Kang-hi.\n\n\u2021 Mung ku yew mu ki and Lung sha ki lio.\n\n\u00a7 He tung kiang wai ki and Lung sha ki lio.\n\n\u00b6 The Kin shi, or \"History of the Kin dynasty,\" for instance, clearly proves, that all the tribes of Churchin received their names, from the mountains, rivers and lakes, near which they lived.\n\n|| In Eastern Siberia, the Buriats of the Buddhist creed give to Shaman Buriats the name of Bargu Buriats; taking the word Bargu in the sense of stupid and rude. It is also stated that Manchu officials call the modern Barhus indiscriminately Barhus and Barhu Buriats (N. Gomboff). The Buriats are also an ancient tribe, already known in Chinggis khan's time. It was like the Barhun, placed in the category of sylvan tribes. I do not take upon myself to elucidate this ethnographical discrepancy, founded it may be on an error or a misunderstanding.\nwhich many spirits are heard speaking in the night season; and at the end of those five marches, towards the east, you come to a kingdom called Erguiul, belonging to the Great Kaan. It is one of the several kingdoms that make up the great Province of Tangut. The people consist of Nestorian Christians, Idolaters, and worshippers of Mahommet.\" (P. 241.)\n\nErguiul is Erichew of the Mongol text of the Yuen ch'ao pi shi, Si-liang in the Chinese history, the modern Liang-chow fu. Klaproth, on the authority of Rashid-eddin, has already identified this name with that of Si-liang.\n\n\"In this country too is found the best musk in the world; and I will tell you how 'tis produced. There exists in that region a kind of wild animal like a gazelle. It has feet and tail like the gazelle's, and stag's hair of a very coarse kind, but no horns. It has four tusks, two below, and two above, about three inches long, and slender in form, one pair growing upwards, and the other downwards. It is a very pretty creature. The musk is found in this way. When the creature has been taken, they find at the navel between the flesh and the skin something like an impostume full of blood, which they cut out and remove with all the skin attached to it. And the blood inside this impostume is the musk that produces that powerful perfume. There is an immense number of these beasts in the country we are speaking of.\" (P. 242.)\n\nHere M. Polo speaks of musk; musk\u2014and rhubarb (which he mentioned before *) are the most renowned and valuable of the products of the province of Kansu, which comparatively produces very little; the industry in both these articles is at present in the hands of the Tanguts of that province.\u2020\n\nChap. LVIII.\n\n\"Starting from Erguiul you ride eastward for eight days, and then come to a province called Egrigaia, containing numerous cities and villages, and belonging to Tangut.\" (P. 247.)\n\nFrom Liang-chow fu M. Polo follows a special route, leaving the modern postal road on his right; the road he took has since the time of the emperor Kang-hi been called the courier's route.\n\nEgrigaia is Erigaia of the Mongol text. Klaproth was correct in his supposition that it is modern Ning-hia. Even now the Eleuts of Alashan call Ning-hia\u2014Yargai. In M. Polo's time this department was famous for the cultivation of the safflower (carthamus tinctorius).\u2021\n\n* In Chap. xliii, describing Sukchur or Su-chow, he says:\u2014\"Over all the mountains of this province rhubarb is found in great abundance, and thither merchants come to buy it, and carry it thence all over the world.\" (P. 196.)\n\u2020 Su chow chi.\n\u2021 Siu l'ung kien, A.D. 1292.\nErigaia is not to be confounded with Urahai, often mentioned in the history of Chingis khan's wars with the Tangut kingdom. Urahai was a fortress in a pass of the same name in the Alashan mountains. Chingis khan spent five months there (an. 1208), during which he invaded and plundered the country in the neighbourhood.* The Alashan mountains form a semicircle five hundred li in extent, and have over forty narrow passes leading to the department of Ning-hia; the broadest and most practicable of these is now called Ch'i-mu k'ow;\u2020 it is not more than eighty feet broad.\u2021 It may be that the Urahai fortress existed near this pass.\n\n\"The capital city is called Calachan. The people are chiefly Idolaters, but there are fine churches belonging to the Nestorian Christians. They are all subjects of the Great Kaan. They make in this city great quantities of camlets of camel's wool, the finest in the world; and some of the camlets that they make are white, for they have white camels, and these are the best of all. Merchants purchase these stuffs here, and carry them over the world for sale.\" (P. 247.)\n\nCalachan is the chief town of the Erigaia province, according to M. Polo's statement. M. Polo, when describing the Tangut kingdom, apparently spoke of a state of things already past in his time; but preserved in the popular memory. Under the name of Calachan he probably means the summer residence of the Tangut kings, which was sixty li from Ning-hia, at the foot of the Alashan mountains. It was built by the famous Tangut king Yuen-hao, on a large scale, in the shape of a castle, in which were high terraces and magnificent buildings.\u00a7 Traces of these buildings are visible to this day. There are often found coloured tiles and iron nails one foot, and even two feet long.\u2016 The last Tangut kings made this place their permanent residence, and led there an indolent and sensual life. The Chinese name of this residence was Ho-lan shan Li-kung.\u00b6 There is sufficient reason to suppose that this very residence is named (under the year 1226) in the Mongol text Alashai nuntuhi;** and in the chronicles of\n\n---\n\n* Si hia shu shi.\n\u2020 \u8499\u53e4\u53e3.\n\u2021 Ning hia fu chi.\n\u00a7 Si hia shu shi.\n\u2016 Ning hia fu chi.\n\u00b6 Li-kung, literally \"a separate palace,\" cannot be translated a suburban palace, as such palaces in China were often very distant from the capital; it is more correct to render it by \"temporary residence.\" The Tangut kings had besides this a summer palace. Ho-lan-shan is the Chinese form of Alashan; in the Mongol text\u2014Alashai.\n** Nuntuhi (at present Notok) has in the Mongol text the meaning of \"nomadic camp, residence, military quarters and military camps.\"\nthe Tangut kingdom, Halahachar, otherwise Halachar, apparently in the Tangut language. Thus M. Polo's Calachan can be identified with the Halachar of the Si hia shu shi, and can be taken to designate the Alashan residence of the Tangut kings.\n\nCh. LIX.\n\n\"Tenduc is a province which lies towards the east, and contains numerous towns and villages; among which is the chief city also called Tenduc......And when you have ridden seven days eastward through this province you get near the provinces of Cathay. You find throughout those seven days' journey plenty of towns and villages, the inhabitants of which are Mahometans, but with a mixture also of Idolaters and Nestorian Christians. They get their living by trade and manufactures; weaving those fine cloths of gold which are called Nasich and Naques, besides silk stuffs of many other kinds. For just as we have cloths of wool in our country, manufactured in a great variety of kinds, so in those regions they have stuffs of silk and gold in like variety.\" (Pp. 249, 250.)\n\nM. Polo does not speak of the journey from Ning-hia to the boundary of Tenduc through the steppes of the modern Ordos. The principal route from Ning-hia to the east* lies, through the town of Shin-mu hien, to the crossing of the Hoang-ho near the town of Pao-te chow, a distance of 975 li in a straight line; or 1135 li if taking the indirect way through Y\u00fc-lin. It is the direct road from Shensi to the northern part of Shansi. The shortest road to Kuku-hoton (the supposed Tenduc) lies towards a more northern crossing, namely, Hutan-hosho.\u2020 Here was the western boundary of the Tien-te kiun\u2021 (Tenduc), as it is now the boundary of Kuku-hoton. Further, the distances between Pao-te chow and Siuen-hwa fu (Siuen-te chow in M. Polo's time) through Ta-t'ung fu on the one hand, and between Hutan-hosho and Siuen-hwa fu, through Kuku-hoton and Ta-t'ung fu, on the other, are almost equal,\u2014about 950 li. It follows that it comes to the same, whether M. Polo travelled by the one or other of these routes, and that the towns which he saw during his seven days' journey, and which according to his statement belonged to Tenduc, are to be placed inside, not outside the Great Wall; for if from Tenduc he did not go to Ta-t'ung fu, but straight east to Shang-tu, it follows that he could not be in Siuen-te chow, where he would have had to go down from the mountains, in order afterwards nearly to retrace\n\n* Explored in 1697.

It seems to me, then, that M. Polo on his way from the banks of Hoang-ho to Siuen-te chow travelled mostly inside the Great Wall. As to the power and the extent of the dominions of the tribe which inhabited Tenduc, our traveller took historical traditions for actualities.\n\nThe name of Tenduc obviously corresponds to T'ien-te kiun,* a military post, the position of which Chinese geographers identify correctly with that of the modern Kuku-hoton.\u2020 The T'ien-te kiun post existed under this name during the K'itan (Liao) and Kin dynasties;\u2021 up to Khubilai's time (1267); when under the name of Fung-chow it was left only a district town in the department of Ta-t'ung fu.\u00a7 The Kin kept in T'ien-te kiun a military chief Chao-t'ao-shi,|| whose duty it was to keep an eye on the neighbouring tribes, and to use, if needed, military force against them. The T'ien-te kiun district was hardly greater in extent than the modern aimak of Tumot, into which Kuku-hoton was included since the 16th century, i.e. 370 li from north to south and 400 li from east to west;\u00b6 during the Kin it had a settled population numbering twenty-two thousand six hundred families.\n\n\"The king of the province is of the lineage of Prester John, George by name, and he holds the land under the Great Kaan; not that he holds anything like the whole of what Prester John possessed. It is a custom, I may tell you, that these kings of the lineage of Prester John always obtain to wife either daughters of the Great Kaan or other princesses of his family. . . . You must know that it was in this same capital city of Tenduc that Prester John had the seat of his government when he ruled over the Tartars, and his heirs still abide there; for as I have told you this king George is of his line, in fact, he is the sixth in descent from Prester John.\" (Pp. 249, 250.)\n\nT'ien-te kiun was bounded on the north by the Yn-shan mountains, in and beyond which was settled the Sha-t'o Tu-k'iu tribe, i.e. Tu-k'iu of the sandy desert. The K'itans, when they conquered the northern borders of China, brought also under their rule the dispersed family of these Tu-k'iu. With the ac-\n\n---\n\n* \u5929\u5fb7\u8ecd.\n\u2020 Ta ts'ing y t'ung chi, chap. on the Tumots of Kuku-hoton.\n\u2021 Vide the geographical parts of the Liao shi, Kin shi and Yuen shi; M. Polo's commentators are wrong in suspecting an anachronism in his statement, or trying to find Tenduc elsewhere.\n\u00a7 During the Kin dynasty, Tien-te kiun was also the centre of administration for the agricultural population of the district; and as such was also called \u8c50\u5dde Fung-chow.\n|| \u62db\u8a0e\u4f7f.\n\u00b6 Yi t'ung chi, Tumots of Kui-hoa ch'ing.\ncession of the Kin, a Wang-ku family made its appearance, as the ruling family of those tribes; it issued from those Sha-t'ou Tu-k'iu who once reigned in the north of China as the How T'ang dynasty (923 to 936 A.D.).\u2020 It split into two branches, the Wang-ku of the Yn-shan, and the Wang-ku of the Lin-t'ao (west of Kan-su). The Kin removed the latter branch to Liao-tung (in Manchuria).\u2021 The Yn-shan Wang-ku guarded the northern borders of China belonging to the Kin, and watched their herds. When the Kin, as a protection against the inroads of the tribes of the desert, erected a rampart, or new wall, from the boundary of the T'angut kingdom down to Manchuria,\u00a7 they intrusted the defence of the principal places of the Yn-shan portion of the wall to the Wang-ku, and transferred there also the Liao-tung Wang-ku.\n\nAt the time Chingis khan became powerful, the chief of the Wang-ku of the Yn-shan was Alahush; and at the head of the Liao-tung Wang-ku stood Pa-sao-ma-ie-li.|| Alahush proved a traitor to the Kin, and passed over to Chingis khan; for this he was murdered by the malcontents of his family, perhaps by Pa-sao-ma-ie-li, who remained true to the Kin.\u00b6 Later on Chingis khan married one of his daughters to the son of Alahush, by name Po-yao-ho, who however had no children by her. He had three sons by a concubine; the eldest of whom, Kiun-pu-hwa, was married to Kuyuk khan's daughter. Kiun-pu-hwa's son ** Ko-li-ki-sze had two wives, both of imperial blood. During a campaign against Haidu, he was made prisoner in 1298, and murdered. His title and dignities passed over in A.D. 1310 to his son Chuan.\u2020\u2020 Nothing is known of Alahush's later descendants; they probably became entirely Chinese, like their relatives of the Liao-tung branch.\n\nThe Wang-ku princes were thus de jure the sons-in-law of the\n\n* \u738b\u53e4; also called Yung-ku \u96cd\u53e4, Ongot of Rashid-eddin, Ongut of the Mongol text.\n\n\u2020 Yuen shi, Biography of Alahush, chap. cxviii, fol. 19.\n\n\u2021 Yuen shi, Biography of Yue-nai-ho, chap. cxxxiv, fol. 2.\n\n\u00a7 Kin shi, an. 1200; Siu t'ung kien, an. 1199-1200; Si hia shu shi, an. 1201.

Polo's time seems to have been general among the Europeans in China; M. Polo and Johannes de Monte Corvino transfer the title of Prester John from Wang-khan, already perished at that time, to the distinguished family of Wang-ku. Their Georgius is undoubtedly Ko-li-ki-sze, Alashush's great-grandson. That this name is a Christian one is confirmed by other testimonies; thus in the Asu (Azee) regiment of the khan's guards was Ko-li-ki-sze, alias Kow-r-ki, (\u2020 1311) and his son Ti-mi-ti-r.\u2020 There is no doubt that one of them was Georgius, and the other Demetrius. Further, in the Description of Chin-kiang\u2021 in the time of the Yuen, mention is made of Ko-li-ki-sze Ye-li-ko-wen, i.e. Ko-li-ki-sze the Christian, and of his son Lu-ho (Luke).\n\nKo-li-ki-sze of Wang-ku is much praised in history for his valour and his love for Confucian doctrine; he had in consequence of a special favour of the khan two Mongol princesses for wives at the same time (which is rather difficult to conciliate with his being a Christian). The time of his death is correctly indicated in a letter of Joannes de M. Corvino of the year 1305: ante sex annos migravit ad Dominum. He left a young son Chu-an, who probably is the Joannes of the letter of Ioannes (Giovani) de M. C., so called propter nomen meum, says the missionary. In another Wang-ku branch, Si-li-ki-sze reminds one also of the Christian name Sergius.\n\nArgons.\n\n\"The rule of the province is in the hands of the Christians as I have told you; but there are also plenty of Idolaters and worshippers of Mahommet. And there is also here a class of people called Argons, which is as much as to say in French Guasmul, or, in other words, sprung from two different races; to wit, of the race of the Idolaters of Tenduc and of that of the worshippers of Mahommet. They are handsomer men than the other natives of the country, and having more ability they come to have authority; and they are also capital merchants.\" (P. 250.)\n\nIt is impossible to admit that M. Polo had meant to designate the Christians by this name, who were called by the\n\n* \u9ad8\u5510\u738b.\n\u2020 Yuen shi, chap. exxxv, fol. 7.\n\u2021 \u81f3\u9806\u93ae\u6c5f\u5fd7 Chi sun chin kiang chi, chap. xv, fol. 16.\nMongols Erkeun. He was well acquainted with the Christians in China, and of course could not ignore the name under which they were generally known, to such a degree, as to see in it a designation of a cross-race of Mahometans and heathens. It is difficult to understand who is to be meant under the name of Mahometans. I shall, without venturing upon idle hypothesis, lay before the reader whatever I have found in Chinese documents of a nature to elucidate this question.\n\n1.\u2014It is mentioned in the Yuen ch'ao pi shi, that there lived amongst the Wang-ku a certain Aasan, who carried on trade with the nomade tribes; to judge by his name (Hassan) he was a Mahometan. He was, according to the Mongol text of the Yuen ch'ao pi shi a Sartahtai, i.e. native of Sartaul or Sartol. The Mongols generally called this Western Turkestan, not merely because it was the country of the Sartes. We see then that in those times there were, amongst the Wang-kus, emigrants from Western Turkestan.\n\n2.\u2014We find among the tribes mentioned in the Yuen shi one called A-r-hun; in the ethnographical division adopted by the Yuen of the tribes and nations subdued by them, in four groups,* A-r-hun belonged to the second, i.e. to the group of Turk and other western tribes; the Wang-ku belonged also to this group; judging by the name of an A-r-hun (Ali) mentioned in the description of Chin-kiang fu, the A-r-hun were Mahometans.\n\n3.\u2014If A-la-un, mentioned in the Yuen shi and not to be found in the list of tribes, is a variant of A-r-gun, we learn that it was a distinguished family in the western countries (as history says) and that it belonged also to the Mahometan faith, if we take the names into account.\n\nThat is all that I can say about the Argons of M. Polo.\n\nSindachu.\n\n\"All this region is subject to the Great Kaan. There is a city you come to called SINDACHU, where they carry on a great many crafts such as provide for the equipment of the Emperor's troops. In a mountain of the province there is a very good silver mine, from which much silver is got; the place is called YDIFU. The country is well stocked with game, both beast and bird.\" (Pp. 250, 251.)\n\nSiuen-te chow is the modern Siuen-hwa fu. Marco Polo's remark on the existence of silver mines in this country is corroborated in the Yuen shi, in which it is stated that there were\n\n* The 1st group\u2014the Mongols, and other nomade tribes;\u2014the 2nd group: Naiman, Wangku, Arhun, Kipchak, Kankly, etc.;\u20143rd group: the northern Chinese, Coreans, Kitans, etc.;\u20144th group: the southern Chinese.\u2014Vide the list of tribes in the \u6a02\u5e9c\u9304 Ch'ue keng lu.\ngold and silver mines in the districts of Siuen-te chow and Yu chow, as well as in the Ki-ming shan mountain. These mines were worked by the government itself up to 1323, when they were transferred to private enterprise.* M. Polo's Ydifu is probably a copyist's error, and stands instead of Yu chow.\n\nM. Polo stopped in Siuen-te chow on the so-called western road connecting Shangtu with Peking; which ran from Peking to Siuen-te chow through the same places as now; but from the latter town it led,\u2014not to Kalgan as it does now,\u2014but more to the west to a place called now Shan-fang p'u,+ where the pass across the Ye-hu ling range begins. In the town of Hing-ho,\u2021 the modern Kharabalgasun, it joined the present caravan road from Kalgan, and left it again in the same place. The distance from Peking to Shangtu by this road was 1095 li. Besides this western route to Shangtu, there existed yet two other roads, both to the east of the former, and leading to Shangtu through Tu-shi k'ow. One of them diverged at the northern exit of the Kiu-yung-kwan pass.\u00a7 The other left at the place called T'u mu. Both converged in one road towards Tu-shi-k'ow, and then joined the western road, leading through Ye-hu ling, at the lake Chagan-nor, south of Shangtu. By this road it was 750 li from Peking to Shangtu. The Mongol khans when proceeding to Shangtu for the summer season, used to take the eastern road through Tu-shi- k'ow, but for the return journey followed the western road by Ye-hu ling.|| On both these roads nabo,\u2020\u2020 or temporary palaces, were built, as resting-places for the khans; eighteen on the eastern road and twenty-four on the western.**\n\nCh. LXI:\n\n\"And when you have ridden three days from the city last mentioned, between north-east and north, you come to a city called Cilandu, which was built by the Kaan now reigning. There is at this place a very fine marble Palace, the rooms of which are all gilt and painted with figures of men and beasts and birds, and with a variety of trees and flowers, all executed with such exquisite art that you regard them with delight and astonishment.\" (P. 263.)\n\n* Siu lung kien, ann.\n+ \u85e4\u623f\u5821 about 80 li from Kalgan.\n\u2021 Called \u694a\u5dde Fu-chow at the time of the Kin.\n\u00a7 This branch was called the Palankin road.\n|| The greater part of the khan's suite and baggage usually went by the way of Ku-pe k'ow.\n\u2020\u2020 Nabo or Naba is a Kitan name; the Kin adopted it, and it passed from them to the Mongols.\n** \u5143\u4e0a\u90fd\u9a5b\u7a0b\u8003 Yuen shang tu yi ch'ing k'ao (Researches on the routes to Shangtu).\nM. Polo's statement that he travelled three days from Siuen-te-chow to Chagannor, and three days also from the latter places to Shangtu, agrees with the information contained in the \"Researches on the routes to Shangtu.\" The Chinese authors have not given the precise position of lake Chagannor; there are several lakes in the desert on the road to Shangtu, and their names have changed with time. The palace in Chagannor was built in 1280.*\n\nChandu,\u2014Shantu, i.e. \"the upper capital,\" called also Loan king,\u2020 i.e. \"the capital on the Loan river.\" Mangu khan having in 1256 committed to Khubilai the task of building a residence near the limits of China proper, had in view to establish a southern ordo (residence), and in it a fair for the trade between China and Mongolia;\u2021 but violating the will of his predecessors whose plan was not to leave the steppes, but to govern the subjugated populations from the depths of Mongolia, Khubilai preferred a settled abode in Peking, and made of Shangtu a summer residence.\u00a7\n\n\"The Lord abides at this Park of his, dwelling sometimes in the Marble Palace and sometimes in the Cane Palace for three months of the year, to wit June, July, and August; preferring this residence because it is by no means hot; in fact it is a very cool place. When the 28th day of [the Moon of] August arrives he takes his departure, and the Cane Palace is taken to pieces.\" (P. 264.)\n\nThe khans usually resorted to Shangtu in the 4th moon and returned to Peking in the 9th. On the 7th day of the 7th moon there were libations performed in honour of the ancestors; a shaman, his face to the north, uttered in a loud voice the names of Chingis khan and of other deceased khans, and poured mare's milk on the ground. The propitious day for the return journey to Peking was also appointed then.||\n\n\"Moreover [at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood] he has another Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description.

The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken down and put up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is stayed [against mishaps from the wind] by more than 200 cords of silk.\" (P. 264.)\n\nThe Palace of canes is probably the Palm Hall* of the Chinese authors, which was situated in the western palace garden of Shangtu.\u2020\n\nHoriad.\n\n\"You must know that the Kaan keeps an immense stud of white horses and mares; in fact more than 10,000 of them, and all pure white without a speck. The milk of these mares is drunk by himself and his family, and by none else, except by those of one great tribe that have also the privilege of drinking it. This privilege was granted them by Chinghis Kaan, on account of a certain victory that they helped him to win long ago. The name of the tribe is Horiad.\" (Pp. 264, 265.)\n\nIf according to Col. Yule's conjecture we should take this name to designate the Oirat tribe, the honours which, as M. Polo says, were paid to this tribe, were addressed probably to the descendants of Hutukhabeki, one of the Oirat princes, in consideration of his having been the first to submit to Chuchi, Chingis khan's son, and of the aid lent by him for subduing the other Oirat princes. Chingis khan had, for these services, married his daughter Chechegen to Inalchi, Hutukhabeki's son.\u2021 It is, however, strange that the Oirats alone enjoyed the privilege described by M. Polo; for the highest position at the Mongol khan's court belonged to the Kunkrat tribe, out of which the khans used to choose their first wives, who were called Empresses of the first ordo.\u00a7\n\nTebet and Kasimur.\n\n\"But I must now tell you a strange thing that hitherto I have forgotten to mention.

The sorcerers who do this are called TEBET and KESIMUR, which are the names of two nations of Idolaters. Whatever they do in this way is by the help of the Devil, but they make those people believe that it is compassed by dint of their own sanctity and the help of God. [They always go in a state of dirt and uncleanness, devoid of respect for themselves, or for those who see them, unwashed, unkempt, and sordidly attired.] These people also have a custom which I must tell you. If a man is condemned to death and executed by the lawful authority, they take his body and cook and eat it. But if any one die a natural death then they will not eat the body.\" (Pp. 265, 266.)\n\n\"Lamas were of various extraction; at the time of the great assemblies, and of the khan's festivities in Shangtu, they erected an altar near the khan's tent and prayed for fine weather; the whistling of shells rose up to heaven.\" These are the words in which M. Polo's narrative is corroborated by an eye-witness who has celebrated the remarkable objects of Shangtu.* These lamas, in spite of the prohibition by the Buddhist creed of bloody sacrifices, used to sacrifice sheep's hearts to Mahakala. It happened, as it seems, that the heart of an executed criminal was also considered an agreeable offering;\u2020 and as the offerings could be, after the ceremony, eaten by the sacrificing priests, M. Polo had some reason to accuse the lamas of cannibalism.\n\n\"There are some among these Baci who are allowed by their rule to take wives, and who have plenty of children.\" (P. 267.)\n\nA good number of lamas were married, as M. Polo correctly remarks; their wives were known, amongst the Chinese, under the name of Fan-sao.\u2021\n\n\"And when the Idol Festivals come round, these Baci go to the Prince and say: \"Sire, the Feast of such a god is come\" [naming him]. \"My Lord, you know,\" the enchanter will say, \"that this god, when he gets no offerings, always sends bad weather and spoils our seasons. So we pray you to give us such and such a number of black-faced sheep,\" naming whatever number they please. \"And we beg also, good my lord, that we may have such a quantity of incense, and such a quantity of lign-aloes, and\"\u2014so much of this, so much of that, and so much of t'other, according to their fancy\u2014\"that we may perform a solemn service and a great sacrifice to our Idols, and that so they may be induced to protect us and all that is ours.\" The Baci say these thing to the Barons entrusted with the Stewardship, who stand round the Great Kaan, and these repeat them to the Kaan, and he then orders the Barons\n\n* Loan king tsa yung.\n\u2020 Siu t'ung kien, chap. cciii.\n\u2021 Ch'ue keng lu.\nto give everything that the Baci have asked for. And when they have got the articles they go and make a great feast in honour of their god, and hold great ceremonies of worship with grand illuminations and quantities of incense of a variety of odours, which they make up from different aromatic spices. And then they cook the meat, and set it before the idols, and sprinkle the broth hither and thither, saying that in this way the idols get their bellyful. Thus it is that they keep their festivals. You must know that each of the idols has a name of his own, and a feast day, just as our Saints have their anniversaries.\" (Pp. 266, 267.)\n\nThe maintenance of the lamas, of their monasteries, the expenses for the sacrifices and for transcription of sacred books, required enormous sums. The lamas enjoyed a preponderating influence, and stood much higher than the priests of other creeds, living in the palace as if in their own house. The perfumes, which M. Polo mentions, were used by the lamas for two purposes; they used them for joss-sticks,* and for making small turrets, known under the name of ts'a-te'sa;\u2020 the joss-sticks used to be burnt in the same way as they are now; the ts'a-te'sa were inserted in suburgas or buried in the ground.\u2021 At the time when the suburga was built in the garden of the Peking palace in 1271,\u00a7 there were used, according to the Empress' wish, 1008 turrets made of the most expensive perfumes, mixed with pounded gold, silver, pearls and corals, and 130,000 ts'a-te'sa made of ordinary perfumes.\u2016\n\n\"They have also immense Minsters and Abbeys, some of them as big as a small town, with more than two thousand monks (i.e. after their fashion) in a single abbey. These monks dress more decently than the rest of the people, and have the head and beard shaven.\" (P. 267.)\n\nThe monasteries with numbers of monks, who, as M. Polo asserts, behaved decently, evidently belonged to Chinese Buddhists, ho-shang; in Khubilai's time they had two monasteries in Shang-tu, in the N.E. and N.W. parts of the town.\u00b6\n\n\"Then there is another kind of devotees called Sensin, who are men of extraordinary abstinence after their fashion, and lead a life of such hardship as I will describe.

That is their food, bran and nothing but bran, and water for their drink. 'Tis a life-long fast! so that I may well say their life is one of extraordinary asceticism. They have great idols, and plenty of them; but they sometimes also worship fire.\" (Pp. 267, 268.)\n\n*Sensin* is a sufficiently faithful transcription of \u5148\u751f Sien-seng (Sien-shing in Pekinese); the Mongols called thus, as well in conversation as in official documents, the Tao-sze, in the sense of preceptors, just as lamas were called by them Bacehi, which corresponds to the Chinese Sien-seng.* M. Polo calls them fasters and ascetics. It was one of the sects of Taoism. There was another one which practised cabalistic and other mysteries.+ The Tao-sze had two monasteries in Shangtu, one in the east part of the town, the other in the western part.\u2021\n\n\"The other Idolaters who are not of this sect call these people heretics \u2014Patarins as we should say\u2014because they do not worship their idols in their own fashion. Those of whom I am speaking would not take a wife on any consideration.\" (P. 268.)\n\nThe Tao-sze, says M. Polo, were looked upon as heretics by the other sects; that is, of course, by the Lamas and Ho-shangs; in fact in his time a passionate struggle was going on between Buddhists and Tao-sze, or rather a persecution of the latter by the former; the Buddhists attributed to the doctrine of the Tao-sze a pernicious tendency, and accused them of deceit; and in support of these assertions they pointed to some of their sacred books. Taking advantage of their influence at Court, they persuaded Khubilai to decree the burning of these books, and it was carried out in Peking, A.D. 1281.\u00a7\n\n\"They wear dresses of hempen stuff, black and blue, and sleep upon mats; in fact their ascetism is something astonishing.\" (P. 268.)\n\nThe Tao-sze, says M. Polo, wear dresses of black and blue linen; i.e. they wear dresses made of tatters of black and blue linen, as can be seen also at the present day.\n\n\"Their idols are all feminine, that is to say, they have women's names.\" (P. 268.)\n\nThe idols of the Tao-sze, according to M. Polo's statement, have female names; in fact, there are in the pantheon of Taoism a\n\n* Vide Chinese text of the charters granted to monasteries; cf. \"Researches on Christianity in China,\" in the Russian \"Eastern Magazine.\" The Mongols gave no translation of the word Sien-seng in their language, and pronounced it Shan-shing.

The Tao-sze have, besides these a good number of male divinities bearing the title of Kiun in common with female divinities; both these circumstances might have led M. Polo to make the above statement.\n\nBook II.\n\nChap. II., seq.\u2014Nayan.\n\n\"There was a great Tartar Chief, whose name was Nayan, a young man [of thirty], Lord over many lands and many provinces; and he was Uncle to the Emperor Cublay Kaan, of whom we are speaking. And when he found himself in authority this Nayan waxed proud in the insolence of his youth and his great power; for indeed he could bring into the field 300,000 horsemen, though all the time he was liegeman to his nephew the Great Kaan Cublay as was right and reason.\" (Pp. 296, 297.)\n\nHis great grandfather, Belgutai, was Chingis khan's step-brother. The situation and limits of his appanage are not clearly defined in history. According to Belgutai's biography, it was between the Onon and Kerulen,* and according to Shin Yao's researches,\u2020 at the confluence of the Argun and Shilka. Finally, according to Harabadur's biography, it was situated in Abalahu,\u2014which geographically and etymologically corresponds to modern Butkha;\u2021 Abalahu, as Khubilai himself said, was rich in fish; indeed, after the suppression of Nayan's rebellion, the governor of that country used to send to the Peking Court, fishes weighing up to a thousand Chinese pounds (kin). It was evidently a country near the Amur river. But history has apparently connected Nayan's appanage with that of Hatan,\u00a7 whose ordo was contiguous to Nayan's, on the left bank of the Amur, hypothetically east of Blagoveshtshensk, on the spot, where still the traces of an ancient city can be seen.|| Nayan's possessions stretched south to Kuang-ning, which belonged to his appanage, and it was from this town that he had the title of prince of Kuang-ning (Kuang-ning-wang.)\u00b6\n\n* Yuen shi.\n\u2020 Lo fung lo wu wen kao.\n\u2021 Yuen shi.

Now these provinces that had been under the Lordship of Nayan were four in number; to wit, the first called Chorcha; the second Cauly; the third Barscol; the fourth Sikintinju. Of all these four great provinces had Nayan been Lord; it was a very great dominion.\" (Pp. 306, 307.)\n\nAccording to M. Polo's statement, Ch. V., Chorcha, Cauly, Barscol and Sikintinju formed part of Nayan's appanage.\n\nChorcha is Churchin.\u2014Nayan, as vassal of the Mongol khans, had the commission to keep in obedience the people of Manchuria (subdued in 1233), and to care for the security of the country; there is no doubt that he shared these obligations with his relative Hatan, who stood nearer to the native tribes of Manchuria.\n\nCauly is Corea.\u2014The Corean kingdom proper could not be a part of the prince's appanage. M. Polo might mean the northern part of Corea, which submitted to the Mongols in A.D. 1269, with sixty towns, and which was subordinated entirely to the central administration in Liao-yang. As to the southern part of Corea, it was left to the king of Corea, who however, was a vassal of the Mongols.\n\nBarscol.\u2014There are in the Yuen shi the names of the department of \u6ee1\u6d32\u8def P'u-y\u00fc-lu and of the place Pu-lo-ho,\u2020 which, according to the system of Chinese transcription, approach to Barscol; but it is difficult to prove this identification, since our knowledge of these places is a very scanty one; it remains only to identify Barscol with Abalahu, already known, all the more as the two names of P'u-y\u00fc-lu and Pu-lo-ho have also some resemblance with Abalahu.\n\nSikintinju.\u2014It is easy to distinguish in this complicated name, the name of \u5efa\u5dde Kien-chow, belonging to a town which was in Nayan's appanage, and is mentioned in the history of his rebellion. There were two Kien-chow, one in the time of the Kin in the\n\nname, (the ancient \u865e\u56fd Yi-wu-lui.)\n\n* Yuen shi, geograph. part, where five tribes of Churchin are enumerated. One of them was called Odolen, from which the present Manchu race derive their origin.\n\n\u2020 These names existed in the time of the Kin, but were preserved, as many others, by the Mongols; the places to which they refer must have been in the neighbourhood of Nayan's appanage. Compare the map of the dominions of the Kin in the \u5386\u4ee3\u5730\u7406\u6cbf\u9769\u56fe Li tai ti li yon ke t'u published in Nanking 1872.

When Nayan's rebellion broke out, the Court of Peking sent orders to the King of Corea, requiring from him auxiliary troops; this circumstance is mentioned in the Corean Annals, under the year 1288 \u00a7 in the following words:\u2014\"in the present year, in the 4th month, orders were received from Peking to send five thousand men with provisions to Kien-chow, which is three thousand li distant from the king's residence.\"|| This number of li cannot of course be taken literally; judging by the distances estimated at the present day, it was about two thousand li from the Corean K'ai-ch'ing fu to the Mongol Kien-chow; and as much to the Kien-chow of the Kin (through Mukden and the pass of Fa-k'u mun in the willow palisade). It is difficult to decide to which of these two cities of the same name the troops were ordered to go, but at any rate, there are sufficient reasons to identify Sikintinju of M. Polo with Kian-chow.\n\n\"Seeing then what great power he had, he took it into his head that he would be the Great Kaan's vassal no longer; nay more, he would fain wrest his empire from him if he could. So this Nayan sent envoys to another Tartar Prince called Caidu, also a great and potent Lord, who was a kinsman of his, and who was a nephew of the Great Kaan and his lawful liege-man also, though he was in rebellion and at bitter enmity with his Sovereign Lord and Uncle. Now the message that Nayan sent was this: That he himself was making ready to march against the Great Kaan with all his forces (which were great), and he begged Caidu to do likewise from his side, so that by attacking Cublay on two sides at once with such great forces they would be able to wrest his dominion from him. And when Caidu heard the message of Nayan, he was right glad thereof, and thought the time was come at last to gain his object. So he sent back answer that he would do as requested; and got ready his host, which mustered a good hundred thousand horsemen. . . . When the Great Kaan heard what was afoot, he made his preparations in right good heart, like\n\n---\n\n* Kien-chow of the Kin was probably on the site of modern \u957f\u6625\u5821 Ch'ang-ch'un pu, on the boundary of Manchuria and Mongolia, west of Modern Kizin.\n\n\u2020 Man chow yuen lew k'ao.\n\n\u2021 Yuen shi, geograph. part.\n\n\u00a7 Kao li shi, chap. xxx, fol. 11.\n\n|| The Corean capital was at that time in K'ai-ch'ing fu. According to the Siu tung k'ien, the Coreans sent five hundred men instead of five thousand. The Siu tung k'ien places this event in 1287, differently from the Coreans.\none who feared not the issue of an attempt so contrary to justice. Confident in his own conduct and prowess, he was in no degree disturbed, but vowed that he would never wear crown again if he brought not those two traitorous and disloyal Tartar chiefs to an ill end. So swiftly and secretly were his preparations made that no one knew of them but his Privy Council, and all were completed within ten or twelve days. . . . And when he had got ready this handful (as it were) of his troops, he ordered his astrologers to declare whether he should gain the battle and get the better of his enemies. After they had made their observations, they told him to go on boldly, for he would conquer and gain a glorious victory: whereat he greatly rejoiced. So he marched with his army, and after advancing for 20 days they arrived at a great plain, where Nayan lay with all his host, amounting to some 400,000 horse. Now the Great Kaan's forces arrived so fast and so suddenly that the others knew nothing about the matter. For the Kaan had caused such strict watch to be made in every direction for scouts that every one that appeared was instantly captured. Thus Nayan had no warning of his coming and was completely taken by surprise; insomuch that when the Great Kaan's army came up, he was asleep in the arms of a wife of his of whom he was extravagantly fond. So thus you see why it was that the Emperor equipped his force with such speed and secrecy. What shall I say about it [the battle]? When day had well broken, there was the Kaan with all his host upon a hill overlooking the plain where Nayan lay in his tent, in all security, without the slightest thought of any one coming thither to do him hurt. In fact, this confidence of his was such that he kept no vedettes whether in front or in rear; for he knew nothing of the coming of the Great Kaan, owing to all the approaches having been completely occupied as I told you. Moreover the place was in a remote wilderness, more than thirty marches from the Court, though the Kaan had made the distance in twenty, so eager was he to come to battle with Nayan. And what shall I tell you next? The Kaan was there on the hill, mounted on a great wooden bartizan, which was borne by four well trained elephants, and over him was hoisted his standard, so high aloft that it could be seen from all sides. His troops were ordered in battles of 30,000 men apiece; and a great part of the horsemen had each a foot soldier armed with a lance set on the crupper behind him (for it was thus that the footmen were disposed of); and the whole plain seemed to be covered with his forces. So it was thus that the Great Kaan's army was arrayed for battle. When Nayan and his people saw what had happened, they were sorely confounded, and rushed in haste to arms. Nevertheless they made them ready in good style and formed their troops in an orderly manner. And when all were in battle array on both sides as I have told you, and nothing remained but to fall to blows, then might you have heard a sound arise of many instruments of various music, and of the voices of the whole of the two hosts loudly singing. For this is a custom of the Tartars that before they join battle they all unite in singing and playing on a certain two-stringed instrument of theirs, a thing\nright pleasant to hear. And so they continue in their array of battle, singing and playing in this pleasing manner, until the great Naccara of the Prince is heard to sound. As soon as that begins to sound the fight also begins on both sides; and in no case before the Prince's Naccara sounds dare any commence fighting. So then, as they were thus singing and playing, though ordered and ready for battle, the great Naccara of the Great Kaan began to sound. And that of Nayan also began to sound. And thenceforward the din of battle began to be heard loudly from this side and from that. And they rushed to work so doughtily with their bows and their maces, with their lances and swords, and with the arblasts of the footmen, that it was a wondrous sight to see. Now might you behold such flights of arrows from this side and from that, that the whole heaven was canopied with them, and they fell like rain. Now might you see on this side and on that full many a cavalier and man-at-arms fall slain, in so much that the whole field seemed covered with them. From this side and from that such cries arose from the crowds of the wounded and dying that had God thundered, you would not have heard Him! For fierce and furious was the battle, and quarter there was none given. But why should I make a long story of it? You must know that it was the most parlous and fierce and fearful battle that ever has been fought in our day. Nor have there ever been such forces in the field in actual fight, especially of horsemen, as were engaged\u2014for, taking both sides, there were not fewer than 760,000 horsemen, a mighty force! and that without reckoning the footmen, who were also very numerous. The battle endured with various fortune on this side and on that from morning till noon. But at the last, by God's pleasure and the right that was on his side, the Great Kaan had the victory, and Nayan lost the battle and was utterly routed. For the army of the Great Kaan performed such feats of arms that Nayan and his host could stand against them no longer, so they turned and fled. But this availed nothing for Nayan; for he and all the barons with him were taken prisoners, and had to surrender to the Kaan with all their arms. Now you must know that Nayan was a baptized Christian, and bore the cross on his banner; but this nought availed him, seeing how grievously he had done amiss in rebelling against his Lord. For he was the Great Kaan's liegeman, and was bound to hold his lands of him like all his ancestors before him. And when the Great Kaan learned that Nayan was taken right glad was he, and commanded that he should be put to death straightway and in secret, lest endeavours should be made to obtain pity and pardon for him, because he was of the Kaan's own flesh and blood. And this was the way in which he was put to death: he was wrapped in a carpet, and tossed to and fro so mercilessly that he died. And the Kaan caused him to be put to death in this way because he would not have the blood of his Line Imperial spilt upon the ground or exposed in the eye of Heaven and before the Sun.\" (Pp. 297-306.)\n\nThe rebellion of Nayan and Hatan is incompletely and contradictorily related in Chinese history. The suppression of both\nthese rebellions lasted four years. In 1287, Nayan marched from his ordo with sixty thousand men through eastern Mongolia. In the 5th moon (var. 6th) of the same year Khabilai marched against him from Shangtu. The battle was fought in south-eastern Mongolia and gained by Khabilai, who returned to Shangtu in the 8th month. Nayan fled to the south-east, across the mountain range, along which a willow palisade stands now; but forces had been sent beforehand from \u6ee1\u5dde Shin-chow (modern Mukden) and Kuang-ning (probably to watch the pass), and Nayan was made prisoner.*\n\nTwo months had not passed, when Hatan's rebellion broke out\u2020 (so that it took place in the same year 1287). It is mentioned\u2021 under year 1288, that Hatan was beaten and that the whole of Manchuria was pacified; but in 1290, it is again mentioned, that Hatan disturbed southern Manchuria, and that he was again defeated. It is to this time that the narratives in the biographies of Liting, Yuesi Femur, and Mangwu ought to be referred. According to the first of these biographies, Hatan after his defeat by Liting on the river Kui lui (Kuilar?) fled and perished. According to the second biography, Hatan's dwelling (on the Amur river) was destroyed and he disappeared. According to the third, Mangwu and Naimatai pursued Hatan to the extreme north, up to the eastern sea-coast (the mouth of the Amur). Hatan fled, but two of his wives and his son Laoti were taken; the latter was executed, and this was the concluding act of the suppression of the rebellion in Manchuria. We find, however, an important variante in the history of Corea; it is stated there, that in 1290, Hatan and his son Laoti were carrying fire and slaughter to Corea, and devastated that country; they slew the inhabitants and fed on human flesh. The King of Corea fled to the Kiang-hwa \u00a7 island. The Coreans were not able to withstand the invasion. The Mongols sent to their aid, in 1291, troops under the command of two generals, Seshekan (who was at that time governor of Liao tung) and Namantai (evidently the above-mentioned Naimatai). The Mongols conjointly with the Coreans defeated the insurgents, who had penetrated into the very heart of the country; their corpses covered a space thirty li in extent; Hatan and his son made their way through the victorious army and fled,|| finding a refuge in\n\n* Siu t'ung kien; Yuen shi lui pien; and biography of Mangwu, in the Yuen ven cha'o.\n\u2020 Biogr. of Mangwu.\n\u2021 In the Siu t'ung kien.\n\u00a7 \u6c5f\u83ef\u5cf6.\n|| \u6771\u570b\u53f2\u7565 Tsung kwo shi lio, a short history of Corea.\nthe Niuchi (Djurdji) country,* from which Laotai made a later incursion into Corea.\u2020 Such is the discrepancy between historians of the same fact.

For the rest of his vast and innumerable troops were too far off to answer so hasty a summons, being engaged under orders from him on distant expeditions to conquer divers countries and provinces. If he had waited to summon all his forces, the multitude assembled would have been beyond all belief, a multitude such as never was heard of or told of, past all counting! In fact, those 360,000 horsemen that he got together consisted merely of the falconers and whippers in that were about his court!\" (P. 299.)\n\n\"Ramusio has here the following explanatory addition:\u2014'You must know that in all the Provinces of Cathay and Mangi, and throughout the Great Kaan's dominions, there are too many disloyal folk ready to break into rebellion against their Lord, and hence it is needful in every province containing large cities and much population, to maintain garrisons. These are stationed four or five miles from the cities, and the latter are not allowed to have walls or gates by which they might obstruct the entrance of the troops at their pleasure. These garrisons, as well as their commanders, the Great Kaan causes to be relieved every two years; and bridled in this way the people are kept quiet, and can make no disturbance. The troops are maintained not only by the pay which the Kaan regularly assigns from the revenues of each province, but also by the vast quantities of cattle which they keep, and by the sale of milk in the cities, which furnishes the means of buying what they require. They are scattered among their different stations, at distances of 80, 40, or 60 days (from the capital); and had Cublay decided to summon but the half of them, the number would have been incredible,' &c.\" (P. 300.)\n\nCol. Yule extracts from Ramusio M. Polo's statement as to the Mongol garrisons cantonned near the Chinese towns. In the Mongol-Chinese documents \u2021 they are mentioned under the name of Aolu, but no explanation of the term is given; M. Polo gives a clear idea of them.\n\nCh. V.\n\n\"And after the Great Kaan had conquered Nayan, as you have heard, it came to pass that the different kinds of people who were present, Saracens and Idolaters and Jews, and many others that believed\n\n* i.e. the present maritime province, belonging to Russia.\n\u2020 Kao li shi, \"The history of Corea,\" chap. cxiv, fol. 15.\n\u2021 Vide \u7d93\u4e16\u5927\u5178 King shi ta tien (in extracts). Aolu is given in the Mongol text of the Yuen ch'ao pi shi as Aoluh.\nnot in God, did gibe those that were Christians because of the cross that Nayan had borne on his standard, and that so grievously that there was no bearing it.\" (P. 307.)\n\nThe Jews are mentioned for the first time in the Yuen shi under the year 1329,* on the occasion of the re-establishment of the law on the collection of taxes from dissidents. Mention of them is made again under the year 1354,+ when on account of several insurrections in China, rich Mahommetans and Jews were invited to the capital in order to join the army. In both cases they are named \u5c24\u5ffd Chu hu (Djuhud).\n\nCh. VII.\n\n\"So we will have done with this matter of Nayan, and go on with our account of the great state of the Great Kaan. We have already told you of his lineage and of his age; but now I must tell you what he did after his return, in regard to those Barons who had behaved well in the battle. Him who was before captain of 100 he made captain of 1,000; and him who was captain of 1,000 men he made to be captain of 10,000, advancing every man according to his deserts and to his previous rank. Besides that, he also made them presents of fine silver plate and other rich appointments; gave them Tablets of Authority of a higher degree than they held before; and bestowed upon them fine jewels of gold and silver, and pearls and precious stones; insomuch that the amount that fell to each of them was something astonishing. And yet 'twas not so much as they had deserved; for never were men seen who did such feats of arms for the love and honour of their Lord, as these had done on that day of the battle. Now those Tablets of Authority, of which I have spoken, are ordered in this way. The officer who is a captain of 100 hath a tablet of silver; the captain of 1,000 hath a tablet of gold or silver-gilt; the commander of 10,000 hath a tablet of gold, with a lion's head on it. And I will tell you the weight of the different tablets, and what they denote. The tablets of the captains of 100 and 1,000 weigh each of them 120 saggi; and the tablet with the lion's head engraven on it, which is that of the commander of 10,000, weighs 220 saggi. And on each of the tablets is inscribed a device, which runs: \"By the strength of the Great God, and of the great grace which He hath accorded to our Emperor, may the name of the Kaan be blessed; and let all such as will not obey him be slain and be destroyed.\" And I tell you besides that all who hold these tablets likewise receive warrants in writing, declaring all their powers and privileges. I should mention too that an officer who holds the chief command of 100,000 men, or who is general-in-chief of a great host, is entitled to a tablet that weighs 300 saggi. It has an inscription thereon to the same purport that I have told you already, and below the inscription there is the figure of a lion, and below the lion the sun and moon. They have warrants also of their high rank, command, and power.\n\n* Yuen shi, chap. xxxiii, p. 7.\n+ Ib. chap. xliii, fol. 10.\nEvery one, moreover, who holds a tablet of this exalted degree is entitled, whenever he goes abroad, to have a little golden canopy, such as is called an umbrella, carried on a spear over his head in token of his high command. And whenever he sits, he sits in a silver chair. To certain very great lords also there is given a tablet with gerfalcons on it; this is only to the very greatest of the Kaan's barons, and it confers on them his own full power and authority; so that if one of these chiefs wishes to send a messenger any whither, he can seize the horses of any man, be he even a king, and any other chattels at his pleasure. (Pp. 312, 313.)\n\nTiger's tablets,\u2014Sinice Hu fu,* and p'ai tse\u2020 in the common language. The Mongols had them of several kinds, which differed by the metal, of which they were made, as well as by the number of pearls (one, two or three in number), which were incrusted in the upper part of the tablet. Falcon's tablets with the figure of a falcon, were round, and used to be given only to special couriers and envoys of the khan.\u2021 The use of the Hu-fu was adopted by the Mongols probably from the Kin.\n\nCh. VIII.\n\n\"The personal appearance of the Great Kaan, Lord of Lords, whose name is Cublay, is such as I shall now tell you. He is of a good stature, neither tall nor short, but of a middle height. He has a becoming amount of flesh, and is very shapely in all his limbs. His complexion is white and red, the eyes black and fine, the nose well formed and well set on. He has four wives, whom he retains permanently as his legitimate consorts; and the eldest of his sons by those four wives ought by rights to be emperor;\u2014I mean when his father dies. Those four ladies are called empresses, but each is distinguished also by her proper name. And each of them has a special court of her own, very grand and ample; no one of them having fewer than 300 fair and charming damsels. They have also many pages and eunuchs, and a number of other attendants of both sexes; so that each of these ladies has not less than 10,000 persons attached to her Court. When the Emperor desires the society of one of these four consorts he will sometimes send for the lady to his apartment, and sometimes visit her at her own. He has also a great number of concubines, and I will tell you how he obtains them. You must know that there is a tribe of Tartars called Ungrat who are noted for their beauty. Now every year a hundred of the most beautiful maidens of this tribe are sent to the Great Kaan, who commits them to the charge of certain elderly ladies dwelling in his palace. And these old ladies make the girls sleep with them, in order to ascertain if they have sweet breath [and do not snore], and are sound in all their limbs. Then such of them as are of\n\n* \u864e\u7b26.\n\u2020 \u724c\u5b50.\n\u2021 Yuen shi lui pien, and Yuen ch'uo tien chang.\napproved beauty, and are good and sound in all respects, are appointed to attend on the Emperor by turns. Thus six of these dames take their turn for three days and nights, and wait on him when he is in his chamber and when he is in bed, to serve him in any way, and to be entirely at his orders. At the end of three days and nights they are relieved by other six. And so throughout the year, there are reliefs of maidens by six and six, changing every three days and nights.\" (Pp. 318, 319.)\n\nKubilai's four wives, i.e. the empresses of the first, second, third and fourth ordos. Ordo is properly speaking a separate palace of the khan, under the management of one of his wives. Chinese authors translate therefore the word ordo by \"harem.\" The four ordo established by Chingis khan were destined for the empresses, who were chosen out of four different nomad tribes.* During the reign of the first four khans, who lived in Mongolia, the four ordo were considerably distant one from another, and the khans visited them in different seasons of the year; they existed nominally as long as China remained under Mongol domination. The custom of choosing the empress out of certain tribes, was in the course of time set aside by the khans. The empress, wife of the last Mongol khan in China was a Corean princess by birth; and she contributed in a great measure to the downfall of the Mongol dynasty.\u2020\n\nCh. X and XI.\n\n\"You must know that for three months of the year, to wit, December, January, and February, the Great Kaan resides in the capital city of Cathay, which is called CAMBALUC, and which is at the north-eastern extremity of the country. In that city stands this great Palace, and now I will tell you what it is like. It is enclosed all round by a great wall forming a square, each side of which is a mile in length; that is to say, the whole compass thereof is four miles. This you may depend on; it is also very thick, and a good ten paces in height, whitewashed and loop-holed all round. . . .\n\nNow there was on that spot in old times a great and noble city called CAMBALUC, which is as much as to say in our tongue \"The City of the Emperor. But the Great Kaan was informed by his Astrologers that this city would prove rebellious, and raise great disorder against his imperial authority. So he caused the present city to be built close beside the old one, with only a river between them. And he caused the people of the old city to be removed to the new town which he had founded; and this is called Taidu. [However, he allowed a portion of the people which he did not suspect, to remain in the old city, because the new one could not hold the whole of them, big as it is.] As regards the size of this (new) city you must know that it has a\n\n* See Yuen shi, on the empresses, and also Yuen ch'ao pi shi.\n\u2020 See Yuen shi,\u2014Pen ki.\ncompass of 24 miles, for each side of it hath a length of 6 miles, and it is four-square. And it is all walled round with walls of earth which have a thickness of full ten paces at bottom, and a height of more than ten paces; but they are not so thick at top, for they diminish in thickness as they rise, so that at top they are only about three paces thick. And they are provided throughout with loop-holed battlements, which are all whitewashed. There are 13 gates, and over each gate there is a great and handsome palace, so that there are on each side of the square, three gates and five palaces; for (I ought to mention) there is at each angle also a great and handsome palace. In those palaces are vast halls in which are kept the arms of the city garrison.\u201d (Pp. 324, 331, 332.)\n\nPeking.\u2014Abundance of historical and archeological information on Peking is contained in the historical description of the city \u65e5\u4e0b\u66f8\u7c21\u8003 Yi hia kiu wen k'ao, 1774,* but unfortunately without criticism. The Peking of the Mongol time, as well as the palace of the khans, seem to have existed on the site of the modern town, and of the Bogdo khan\u2019s palace. The town was in those times 60 li in circumference, but the Chue keng lu state expressly that those li (field li) are meant, which contain only 240 pu. This will give for the circuit of the Mongol capital only forty geographical li, each of them containing now 360 pu. When the Ming army took possession of Peking, the Emperor Hung-wu reduced its dimensions, but his son Yung-lo, who determined to make it the northern capital, enlarged it again. In his time Peking was 6879,83 chang\u2020 in circumference, i.e. 13759,33 pu,\u2021 not over 640 pu less than during the Mongols. The wall surrounding the palaces of the Mongol khans was 9 li 30 pu in circumference. The square measured from east to west 480 pu, from north to south 615 pu. Consequently the opinion of those who think that the ancient wall 5 or 6 li north of Peking belongs not to the Mongol time but to a remoter period\u00a7 is not unfounded. Besides this, the author of the \u9577\u5b89\u5ba2\u8a71 Ch'ang an ko hua (published during the Ming dynasty) states expressly that Yung lo built the walls of Peking on the walls of the Mongol capital. It is possible, however, to verify this point. The first Nabo (station of khan) on the road from Peking to Shang-tu was 20 li north of the \u5efa\u5fb7\u9580 Kien te men gate, in the small borough \u5927\u53e3 Ta-k'ow. There were three hillocks on that spot and this circumstance caused Ta-k'ow to be called also San-ko-ta (the three humps).|| Physical signs are not destroyed by time as rapidly as\n\n* See Wylie's Notes on Chinese Literature.\n\u2020 Yi hia kiu wen k'ao, chap. xxxviii, fol. 12.\n\u2021 The modern pu equal to 5 large feet = the ancient pu of 6 small feet.\n\u00a7 \u91ce\u7372\u7de8 Ye hu pien, published in 1606.\n|| Researches on the routes to Shang-tu.\nbuildings are; it is probable therefore, that these hillocks still exist; and it is possible by their relative distance from the present northern wall of Peking, to determine how far the Mongol capital stretched to the north. If the wall of modern Peking was built on the wall of the Mongol capital, the Kien-te-men gate of the Mongol time would answer to the present Te-shing-men gate. Twenty li north of this gate, lies now the small town of Ts'ing ho on the river of the same name. There was at this place during the Ming dynasty a temporary palace, on the road to the imperial cemetery. In the time of the Mongols, roads were measured, as they are now, in ordinary li.\n\nAs I know that one of my friends in Peking has undertaken to examine the remains of ancient Peking, and that he intends to publish his archeological investigations, I need not enlarge upon this subject.\n\nCh. XII.\n\n\"You must know that the Great Kaan, to maintain his state, hath a guard of twelve thousand horsemen, who are styled Keshican, which is as much as to say \"Knights devoted to their Lord.\" Not that he keeps these for fear of any man whatever, but merely because of his own exalted dignity. These 12,000 men have four captains, each of whom is in command of 3,000; and each body of 3,000 takes a turn of three days and three nights to guard the palace, where they also take their meals. After the expiration of three days and nights they are relieved by another 3,000, who mount guard for the same space of time, and then another body takes its turn, so that there are always 3,000 on guard. Thus it goes until the whole 12,000, who are styled (as I said) Keshican, have been on duty; and then the tour begins again, and so runs on from year's end to year's end.\" (P. 336.)\n\nBy Keshican in Col. Yule's M. Polo, Keshikten is evidently meant. This is a general Mongol term to designate the Khan's life guard. It is derived from the word keshik meaning a guard by turns, a corps on tour of duty.* Keshik is one of the archaisms of the Mongol language, for now this word has another meaning in Mongol. Col. Yule has brought together several explanations of the term. It seems to me that among his suppositions the following is the most consistent with the ancient meaning of the word:\n\n\"We find Kishik still used at the court of Hindustan, under \"the great kings of Timur's House, for the corps on tour of duty \"at the palace. . . . . . The royal guards in Persia, who \"watch the king's person at night, are termed Keshikchi.\"\n\n* Comp. Yuan ch'ao pi shi. The Mongol as well as the Chinese text give detailed accounts respecting this guard.\nThe Keshikten was divided into a day-watch called *Turgaut* and a night-watch *Kebteul.* The Kebte-ul consisted of pure Mongols, whilst the Turgaut was composed of the sons of the vassal princes and governors of the provinces, and of hostages. The watch of the khan was changed every three days, and contained 400 men. In 1330 it was reduced to 100 men.\n\nCh. XIII.\n\n\"[There are certain Barons specially deputed to see that foreigners, who do not know the customs of the Court, are provided with places suited to their rank; and these Barons are continually moving to and fro in the hall, looking to the wants of the guests at table, and causing the servants to supply them promptly with wine, milk, meat, or whatever they lack. At every door of the hall (or, indeed, wherever the Emperor may be) there stand a couple of big men like giants, one on each side, armed with staves. Their business is to see that no one steps upon the threshold in entering, and if this does happen, they strip the offender of his clothes, and he must pay a forfeit to have them back again; or in lieu of taking his clothes, they give him a certain number of blows. If they are foreigners ignorant of the order, then there are Barons appointed to introduce them, and explain it to them. They think, in fact, that it brings bad luck if any one touches the threshold. Howbeit, they are not expected to stick to this in going forth again, for at that time some are like to be the worse for liquor, and incapable of looking to their steps.]\u201d (Pp. 339, 340.)\n\nThe author of the *Ch'ue keng lu* mentions also the athletes with clubs standing at the door, at the time of the khan's presence in the hall. He adds, that next to the khan, two other life-guards used to stand, who held in their hands \u201cnatural\u201d axes of jade.\n\nCh. XIV.\n\n\u201cYou must know that the Tartars keep high festival yearly on their birthdays. And the Great Kaan was born on the 28th day of the September moon, so on that day is held the greatest feast of the year at the Kaan's Court, always excepting that which he holds on New Year's Day, of which I shall tell you afterwards. Now, on his birthday, the Great Kaan dresses in the best of his robes, all wrought with beaten gold; and full 12,000 Barons and Knights on that day come forth dressed in robes of the same colour, and precisely like those of the Great Kaan, except that they are not so costly; but still they are all of the same colour as his, and are also of silk and gold. Every man so clothed has also a girdle of gold; and this as well as the dress is given him by the Sovereign.\n\n---\n\n* Abulghaji spells this word, *Torgak.*\n\u2020 It is a curious fact, that the tribe of the *Kalmuk\u2014Torgauts* near Astrakhan derive their origin from the life-guard of the Mongol khans.\n\u2021 See *Yuen shi tui pien.*\n\u00a7 i.e. axes found fortuitously in the ground, probably primitive weapons.\nAnd I will aver that there are some of these suits decked with so many pearls and precious stones that a single suit shall be worth full 10,000 golden bezants. And of such raiment there are several sets. For you must know that the Great Kaan, thirteen times in the year, presents to his Barons and Knights such raiment as I am speaking of. And on each occasion they wear the same colour that he does, a different colour being assigned to each festival. Hence you may see what a huge business it is, and that there is no prince in the world but he alone who could keep up such custom as these. On his birthday also all the Tartars in the world, and all the countries and governments that owe allegiance to the Kaan, offer him great presents according to their several ability, and as prescription or orders have fixed the amount. And many other persons also come with great presents to the Kaan, in order to beg for some employment from him. And the Great Kaan has chosen twelve Barons on whom is laid the charge of assigning to each of these supplicants a suitable answer. On this day likewise all the Idolaters, all the Saracens, and all the Christians and other descriptions of people make great and solemn devotions, with much chaunting and lighting of lamps and burning of incense, each to the God whom He doth worship, praying that He would save the Emperor, and grant him long life and health and happiness.\" (Pp. 343, 344.)\n\nThe accounts given by M. Polo regarding the feasts of the khan and the festival dresses at his Court agree perfectly with the statements on the same subject of contemporary Chinese writers. Banquets were called in the common Mongol language chama, and festival dresses chisun.* General festivals used to be held at the new year and at the birthday of the khan.\u2020 In the Mongol-Chinese Code, the ceremonies performed in the provinces on the khan's birthday are described. One month before that day the civil and military officers repaired to a temple, where a service was performed to the khan's health. On the morning of the birthday a sumptuously adorned table was placed in the open air, and the representatives of all classes and all confessions were obliged to approach the table, to prostrate themselves and exclaim three times: wum-sui (i.e. \"ten thousand years\" life to the khan). After that the banquet took place. In the same code (in the article on the Ye li ke un \u2021) it is stated, that in the year 1304,\u2014owing to a dispute, which had arisen in the province of Kiang-nan between the ho-shang (Buddhist priests) and the Christian missionaries, as to precedence in the above-mentioned ceremony,\u2014a\n\n* Comp. the above-mentioned Researches on the routes to Shang-tu.\n\u2020 See Y\u00fcen shi, section on ceremonies, and \u5143\u671d\u5178\u7ae0 Yueu ch'ao tien chang or \"Mongol Chinese Code.\"\n\u2021 \u4e5f\u91cc\u53ef\u6e29 Ye li ke un was the name by which Christians were designated at the time of the Mongol dynasty. The word is Erke-un in Mongol.\nspecial edict was published, in which it was decided that in the rite of supplication, Christians should follow the Buddhist and Taouist priests.*\n\nCh. XVII\u2014seq.\n\n\"The three months of December, January, and February, during which the Emperor resides at his Capital City, are assigned for hunting and fowling, to the extent of some 40 days' journey round the city; and it is ordained that the larger game taken be sent to the Court. To be more particular: of all the larger beasts of the chase, such as boars, roebucks, bucks, stags, lions, bears, &c., the greater part of what is taken has to be sent, and feathered game likewise. The animals are gutted and despatched to the Court on carts. This is done by all the people within 20 or 30 days' journey, and the quantity so despatched is immense. Those at a greater distance cannot send the game, but they have to send the skins after tanning them, and these are employed in the making of equipments for the Emperor's army.\" (P. 352.)\n\nKubilai khan kept a whole army, 14,000 men, huntsmen, distributed in Peking and other cities in the present province of Chili.\u2020 The khan used to hunt in the Peking plain from the beginning of spring, until his departure to Shang-tu. There are in the Peking department many low and marshy places, stretching often to a considerable extent and abounding in game. In the biography of Ai sie, (Yuen shi, chap. cxxxiv), who was a Christian, it is mentioned that Kubilai was hunting also in the department of Pao-ting fu.\n\n\"And when he (the Emperor) has travelled till he reaches a place called Cachar Modun, there he finds his tents pitched, with the tents of his Sons, and his Barons, and those of his Ladies and theirs, so that there shall be full 10,000 tents in all, and all fine and rich ones. And I will tell you how his own quarters are disposed. The tent in which he holds his courts is large enough to give cover easily to a thousand souls. It is pitched with its door to the south, and the Barons and Knights remain in waiting in it, whilst the Lord abides in another close to it on the west side. When he wishes to speak with any one he causes the person to be summoned to that other tent, &c.\" (Pp. 359, 360.)\n\nWith respect to Cachar Modun, Marco Polo intends perhaps by this name \u6cb3\u897f\u52d9 Ho-si wu, which place together with \u963f\u62c9\u4f2f Yang-ts'un were comprised in the general name \u99ac\u982d ma-t'ou (perhaps the modun of M. Polo). Ma-t'ou is even now a general term for a jetty in Chinese. Ho si in the Mongol spelling was Hu shin\u2021. D'Ohsson in his translation of Rashid-eddin renders\n\n* In the Mongol-Chinese Code the whole text of the edict is found.\n\u2020 Yuen shi, \u8d21\u8ca8\u5fd7.\n\u2021 See Mongol text of the Yuen ch'ao pi shi.\nHo si by Co shi,* but Rashid in that case speaks not of Ho-si wu but of the Tangut empire, which in Chinese was called \u6cb3\u897f Ho si, meaning west of the (yellow) river. Ho-si wu as well as Yang ts'un, both exist even now as villages on the Peihuo river, and near the first ancient walls can be seen. Ho-si wu means: \"custom's barrier west of the (Peihuo) river.\"\n\nCh. XIX.\u2014Chinuchi, Cunic.\n\n\"The Emperor hath two Barons who are own brothers, one called Baian and the other Mingan; and these two are styled Chinuchi (or Cunic) which is as much as to say, \"The Keepers of the Mastiff Dogs.\" Each of these brothers hath 10,000 men under his orders; each body of 10,000 being dressed alike, the one in red and the other in blue, and whenever they accompany the Lord to the chase, they wear this livery, in order to be recognized. Out of each body of 10,000 there are 2,000 men who are each in charge of one or more great mastiffs, so that the whole number of these is very large. And when the Prince goes a-hunting, one of those Barons, with his 10,000 men and something like 5,000 dogs, goes towards the right, whilst the other goes towards the left with his party in like manner. They move along, all abreast of one another, so that the whole line extends over a full days' journey, and no animal can escape them. Truly it is a glorious sight to see the working of the dogs and the huntmen on such an occasion! And as the Lord rides a fowling across the plains, you will see these big hounds coming tearing up, one pack after a bear, another pack after a stag, or some other beast, as it may hap, and running the game down now on this side and now on that, so that it is really a most delightful sport and spectacle.\" (P. 356.)\n\nChinuchi, Cunic.\u2014These names are used by M. Polo to designate two dog-keepers of Kubilai, but they have no resemblance with any of the names found in the Yuen shi, chap. xcix, article Ping-chi (military organisation), and relating to the hunting staff of the khan, viz.: \u6614\u5bf6\u8d64 Si pao ch'i (falconers), \u706b\u5152\u8d64 Ho r c'hi (archers), and \u9b3c\u6a5f\u8d64 Ke lien ch'i (probably those who managed the hounds).\n\nCh.

He takes with him full 10,000 falconers, and some 500 gerfalcons besides peregrines, sakers, and other hawks in great numbers; and goshawks also to fly at the waterfowl. But do not suppose that he keeps all these together by him; they are distributed about, hither and thither, one hundred together, or two hundred at the utmost, as he thinks proper. But they\n\n* Hist. des Mong., tom. I, p. 95.\nare always fowling as they advance, and the most part of the quarry taken is carried to the Emperor. And let me tell you when he goes thus a fowling with his gerfalcons and other hawks, he is attended by full 10,000 men who are disposed in couples; and these are called Toscaol, which is as much as to say 'Watchers.' And the name describes their business. They are posted from spot to spot, always in couples, and thus they cover a great deal of ground! Every man of them is provided with a whistle and hood, so as to be able to call in a hawk and hold it in hand. And when the Emperor makes a cast, there is no need that he follow it up, for those men I speak of keep so good a look out that they never lose sight of the birds, and if these hawks have need of help they are ready to render it.\" (Pp. 357, 358.)\n\nI have heard from men well acquainted with the customs of the Mongols, that at the present day the leaders of the two flanks in \"battues,\" which surround the game, are called toscaul in Mongol.\n\nBularguchi.\n\n\"All the Emperor's hawks, and those of the Barons as well, have a little label attached to the leg to mark them, on which is written the names of the owner and the keeper of the bird. And in this way the hawk, when caught, is at once identified and handed over to its owner. But if not, the bird it carried to a certain Baron who is styled Bularguchi, which is as much as to say 'The Keeper of Lost Property.' And I tell you that whatever may be found without a known owner, whether it be a horse, or a sword, or a hawk, or what not, it is carried to that Baron straightway, and he takes charge of it. And if the finder neglects to carry his trover to the Baron, the latter punishes him. Likewise the loser of any article goes to the Baron, and if the thing be in his hands it is immediately given up to the owner. Moreover, the said Baron always pitches on the highest spot of the camp, with his banner displayed, in order that those who have lost or found anything may have no difficulty in finding their way to him. Thus nothing can be lost but it shall be straightway found and restored.\" (Pp. 358, 359.)\n\nBularguchi.\u2014There are two Mongol terms, which resemble this word, viz., Balagachi and Buluguchi. But the first was the name used for the door-keeper of the tent of the khan. By Buluguchi the Mongols understood a hunter and especially sable hunters.* No one of these terms can be made consistent with the accounts given by M. Polo regarding the Bularguchi. In the Kui sin tea shi written by Chow Mi, in the former part of the 14th century,\u2020 interesting particulars regarding Mongol hunting are found.\n\n* See the Man chow yuen liu k'ao.\n\u2020 See Wylie's Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 158.\n\"The Emperor himself is carried upon four elephants in a fine chamber made of timber, lined inside with plates of beaten gold, and outside with lion's skins [for he always travels in this way on his fowling expeditions, because he is troubled with gout]. He always keeps beside him a dozen of his choicest gerfalcons, and is attended by several of his Barons who ride on horseback alongside. And sometimes, as they may be going along, and the Emperor from his chamber is holding discourse with the Barons, one of the latter shall exclaim: 'Sire! Look out for Cranes!' Then the Emperor instantly has the top of his chamber thrown open, and having marked the cranes he casts one of his gerfalcons, whichever he pleases; and often the quarry is struck within his view, so that he has the most exquisite sport and diversion, there as he sits in his chamber or lies on his bed; and all the Barons with him get the enjoyment of it likewise! So it is not without reason I tell you that I do not believe there ever existed in the world or ever will exist, a man with such sport and enjoyment as he has, or with such rare opportunities.\" (P. 359.)\n\nThe gout of Kubilai khan.\u2014In the Corean history allusion is made twice to the khan's suffering from this disease.* Under the year 1267 it is there recorded that in the 9th month, envoys of the khan with a letter to the king arrived in Corea. Kubilai asked for the skin of the Akirho munho, a fish resembling a cow.\u2020 The envoy was informed that, as the khan suffered from swollen feet it would be useful for him to wear boots made of the skin of this animal, and in the 10th month, the king of Corea forwarded to the khan seventeen skins of it.\n\nIt is further recorded in the Corean history, that in the 8th month of 1292, sorcerers and Shaman women from Corea\u2021 were sent at the request of the khan to cure him of a disease of the feet and hands. At that time the king of Corea was also in Peking, and the sorcerers and shaman women were admitted during an audience the king had of the khan. They took the khan's hands and feet and began to recite exorcisms, whilst Kubilai was laughing.\n\nCh.

Perhaps by akirho munho \"the sea cow\" (Rhytina Stelleri) is meant. As Dr. Bretschneider formed me, this large sea beast was found in the sea of Behring, near Kamtchatka, last century by Steller, which however at the present time can be considered as extinct.\n\u2021 The shaman women of Corea were famed all over China for their powers of charming.\naccomplish even much more than I have told you, or am going to tell you, in this Book. For, tell it how I might, you never would be satisfied that I was keeping within truth or reason! The Emperor's Mint then is in this same City of Cambaluc, and the way it is wrought is such that you might say he hath the Secret of Alchemy in perfection, and you would be right! For he makes his money after this fashion. He makes them take of the bark of a certain tree in fact the Mulberry Tree, the leaves of which are the food of the silkworms,\u2014these trees being so numerous that whole districts are full of them. What they take is a certain fine white bast or skin which lies between the wood of the tree and the thick outer bark, and this they make into something resembling sheets of paper, but black. When these sheets have been prepared they are cut up into pieces of different sizes. The smallest of these sizes is worth a half tornesel; the next, a little larger, one tornesel; one, a little larger still, is worth half a silver groat of Venice; another a whole groat; others yet two groats, five groats, and ten groats. There is also a kind worth one Bezzant of gold, and others of three Bezzants, and so up to ten. All these pieces of paper are [issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver; and on every piece a variety of officials, whose duty it is, have to write their names, and to put their seals. And when all is prepared duly, the chief officer deputed by the Kaan smears the Seal entrusted to him with vermilion, and impresses it on the paper, so that the form of the Seal remains stamped upon it in red; the Money is then authentic. Any one forging it would be punished with death]. And the Kaan causes every year to be made such a vast quantity of this money, which costs him nothing, that it must equal in amount all the treasure in the world. With these pieces of paper, made as I have described, he causes all payments on his own account to be made; and he makes them to pass current universally over all his kingdoms and provinces and territories, and whithersoever his power and sovereignty extends. And nobody, however important he may think himself, dares to refuse them on pain of death. And indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go throughout the Great Kaan's dominions he shall find these pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by means of them just as well as if they were coins of pure gold. And all the while they are so light that ten bezants' worth does not weigh one golden bezant. Furthermore all merchants arriving from India or other countries, and bringing with them gold or silver or gems and pearls, are prohibited from selling to any one but the Emperor. He has twelve experts chosen for this business, men of shrewdness and experience in such affairs; these appraise the articles, and the Emperor then pays a liberal price for them in those pieces of paper. The merchants accept his price readily, for in the first place they would not get so good an one from anybody else, and secondly they are paid without any delay. And with this paper-money they can buy what they like anywhere over the Empire, whilst it is also vastly lighter to carry about on their journeys. And it is a truth that the merchants will several\ntimes in the year bring wares to the amount of 400,000 bezants, and the Grand Sire pays for all in that paper. So he buys such a quantity of those precious things every year that his treasure is endless, whilst all the time the money he pays away costs him nothing at all. Moreover several times in the year proclamation is made through the city that any one who may have gold or silver or gems or pearls, by taking them to the Mint shall get a handsome price for them. And the owners are glad to do this, because they would find no other purchaser give so large a price. Thus the quantity they bring in is marvellous, though those who do not choose to do so may let it alone. Still, in this way, nearly all the valuables in the country come into the Kaan's possession. When any of those pieces of paper are spoilt\u2014not that they are so very flimsy neither\u2014the owner carries them to the Mint, and by paying 3 per cent. on the value he gets new pieces in exchange. And if any Baron, or any one else soever, hath need of gold or silver or gems or pearls, in order to make plate, or girdles or the like, he goes to the Mint and buys as much as he list, paying in this paper-money.\" (Pp. 378-380.)\n\nWithout doubt the Mongols borrowed the bank-note system from the Kin. Up to this time there is in Sian fu a block kept, which was used for printing the bank-notes of the Kin dynasty. I have had the opportunity of seeing a print of those bank-notes. They were of the same size and the same shape as the bank-notes of the Ming. A reproduction of the text of the Kin bank-notes is found in the \u91d1\u77f3\u8403\u7de8 Kin shi ts'ui pien.* This copy has the characters \u5bf6\u5238 pao kian (precious charter) and the years of reign \u8c9e\u7950 1213-1216. The first essay of the Mongols to introduce bank-notes dates from the time of Ogodai khan 1229-42, but Chinese history only mentions the fact without giving details. At that time silk in skeins was the only article of a determinate value in the trade and on the project of Ye l\u00fc ch'u ts'ai, minister of Ogodai the taxes were also collected in silk delivered by weight.\u2020 It can therefore be assumed that the name \u7d79\u7d19 sze ch'ao (i.e. bank-notes referring to the weight of silk),\u2021 dates back to the same time. At any rate at a later time, as, under the reign of Kubilai, the issuing of bank-notes was decreed, silk was taken as the standard to express the value of silver and 1,000 liang silk was estimated=50 liang (or 1 ting) silver.\u00a7 Thus, in\n\n* See Wylie's Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 64.\n\u2020 Transactions of that kind were in use until a short time ago in Kiakhta on the Russian-Chinese frontier, where in the retail trade between Russians, Chinese and Mongols, silk skeins took the place of money.\n\u2021 I think that sze-ch'ao cannot mean bank-notes made of silk-paper as has been suggested by some sinologues.\n\u00a7 The ting of the Mongol time as well as during the reign of the Kin, was a unit of weight equivalent to 50 liang, but not to 10 liang as has been suggested by some interpreters of M. Polo. (Comp.

One of them was a Chinese observatory (sze t'ien t'ai), the other a Mohammedan observatory (hui hui sze t'ien t'ai) each with its particular astronomical and chronological systems, its particular astrology and instruments. The first astronomical and calendar system was compiled for the Mongols by Ye-liu Ch'u-ts'ai, who was in Chingis khan's service, not only as a high counsellor, but also as an astronomer and astrologer. After having been convinced of the obsoleteness and incorrectness of the astronomical calculations in the Ta ming li (the name of the calendar system of the Kin dynasty), he thought out at the time he was at Samarcand a new system, valid not only for China, but also for the countries conquered by the Mongols in western Asia; and named it in memory of Chingis khan's expedition \u897f\u5f81\u5e9a\u5348\u5143\u6b77 Si ching keng wu yuan li, i.e. \"Astronomical calendar beginning with the year keng-wu, compiled during the war in the west.\" Keng-wu was the year 1210 of our era. Ye-liu Ch'u-ts'ai chose this year, and the moment of the winter solstice, for the beginning of his period; because according to his calculations, it coincided with the beginning of a new astronomical or planetary period. He took also into consideration, that since the year 1211 Chingis khan's glory had spread over the whole world.* Ye-liu Ch'u-ts'ai's calendar was not adopted in China, but the system of it is explained in the Yuen shi, in the section on Astronomy and the Calendar.\u2020\n\nIn the year 1267 the Mohammedans presented to Kubilai their astronomical calendar, wan nien li, i.e. the calendar of ten thousand years. By taking this denomination in its literal sense, we may conclude, that the Mahommedans brought to China the ancient Persian system, founded on the period of 10,000 years. The compilers of the Yuen shi seem not to have had access to documents relating to this system, for they give no details about it.\n\nFinally by order of Kubilai the astronomers Hiu Heng and Ko Shou-king composed a new calculation under the name of Shou-shi li, which came into use from the year 1280. It is thoroughly explained in the Yuen shi. Notwithstanding the fame this system generally enjoyed, its blemishes came soon to light. In the 6th\n\n* See Ye-liu Ch'u-ts'ai's address to Chingis khan in the \u5143\u6587\u6284 Yuan wen ch'ao.\n\n\u2020 In the Ch'ue keng lu it is stated, that Ye-liu Ch'u-ts'ai was an adherent of the astronomy of the Mohammedans, because he found that there the theory of the five planets was more precisely explained than in Chinese astronomy (probably the hypothesis of the epicycles is meant). Inspired by these theories he compiled the astronomical calculation \u9ebb\u7b54\u628a\u6b77 Ma-ta-pa (evidently a Mohammedan term). I leave to specialists to decide what connection could be supposed between the system of Ch'u-ts'ai and the Ma-ta-pa.\nmonth of 1302 an eclipse of the sun happened, and the calculation of the astronomer proved to be erroneous (it seems the calculation had anticipated the real time).*\n\nThe astronomers of the Ming dynasty explained the errors in the Shou-shi li by the circumstance, that in that calculation the period for one degree of precession of the equinox was taken too long (81 years).\u2020 But they were themselves hardly able to overcome these difficulties.\n\nCh. XXXIV.\n\n\"As we have said before, these people are Idolaters, and as regards their gods, each has a tablet fixed high up on the wall of his chamber, on which is inscribed a name which represents the Most High and Heavenly God; and before this they pay daily worship, offering incense from a thurible, raising their hands aloft, and gnashing their teeth three times, praying Him to grant them health of mind and body; but of Him they ask nought else. And below on the ground there is a figure which they call Natiga\u00ef, which is the god of things terrestrial. To him they give a wife and children, and they worship him in the same manner, with incense, and gnashing of teeth, and lifting up of hands; and of him they ask seasonable weather, and the fruits of the earth, children, and so forth.\" (P. 404.)\n\nBy the \"Most High and Heavenly God\" worshipped by the Chinese, as Marco Polo reports, evidently the Chinese \u5929 T'ien, \"Heaven\" is meant, Lao t'ien ye in the common language. Regarding \"the God of things terrestrial\" whose figure the Chinese, according to M. Polo, \"placed below on the ground\" there can also be no doubt that he understands the \u571f\u5730 T'u-ti, the local \"Lar\" of the Chinese, to which they present indeed sacrifices on the floor, near the wall under the table.\u2021\n\nM. Polo reports, that the Chinese worship their God offering incense, raising their hands aloft, and gnashing their teeth.\u00a7 Of course he means that they placed the hands together, or held kindled joss-stick bundles in their hands, according to the Chinese custom.

It is effected by the four upper and lower fore-teeth. The Taouists are obliged before the service begins to perform a certain number of k'ow-ch'i, turning their heads alternately to the left and to the right, in order to drive away mundane thoughts and aggressions of bad spirits. The k'ow-ch'i repeated three times is called \u9cf4\u6cd5\u9f13 ming fa ku in Chinese, i.e. \"to beat the spiritual drum.\" The ritual says, that it is heard by the most high Ruler, who is moved by it to grace.*\n\nM. Polo observed this custom among the lay heathen. Indeed it appears from a small treatise, written in China more than a hundred years before M. Polo,\u2020 that at the time the Chinese author wrote, all devout men, entering a temple, used to perform the k'ow-ch'i, and considered it an expression of veneration and devotion to the idols. Thus this custom had been preserved to the time of M. Polo, who did not fail to mention this strange peculiarity in the exterior observances of the Chinese. As regards the present time it seems to me, that this custom is not known among the people, and even with respect to the Taouists it is only performed on certain occasions, and not in all Taouist temples.\n\n* See the \u592a\u6e05\u7389\u518c T'ai ts'ing yu ts'e published in 1444.

HOLCOMBE.\n\nThe \"Imperial Highway\" from Peking to the western and southern provinces of China, passes, as is well known, along the great \"Plain of Chih-li\" in a general south-westerly direction, at an average distance of about fifteen English miles from the \"Western Hills,\" until Ching-ting fu (\u6b63\u5b9a\u5e9c) is reached, at a distance of two hundred miles from the Imperial capital. At this point, the \"Great Road\" sends off a branch due south, passing through K'ai-feng fu (\u958b\u5c01\u5e9c), the provincial capital of Ho-nan (\u6cb3\u5357), and thence on to the central and south-eastern provinces. The main road, however, turns due west at Ching-ting fu, and enters Shan-hsi through what is known among Chinese travellers as the \"Ku-kuan\" (\u56fa\u95dc). It is the purpose of the writer to follow this great highway into Shan-hsi (\u5c71\u897f), and then, still following it, or diverging from it at his pleasure, to attempt some descriptions of the geography and natural scenery of that province and of the south-eastern portion of the province of Shen-hsi (\u965d\u897f), adjacent to, and bounding the first named province upon the west.\n\nThe city of Ching-ting fu is like an emptied pea-pod, all shell. Possessing a fine wall, stretching around a very considerable area, the great proportion of the land so enclosed is still devoted to vegetable gardens, and wheat and millet fields; while the few business shops which the city contains, are gathered in a little knot about the intersection and crossing of the two great streets which connect the four gates of the city. The notable, perhaps one might say, the ominous sight to be seen, is found in the north-eastern corner of the city, and consists of a great Buddhist temple with its innumerable rows of outbuildings, all giving evidence of original costliness and former splendour, but now decayed and falling to ruin; while immediately beside it, rise the fair towers, and well proportioned walls of the Romish Cathedral, with its new and finely kept buildings and gardens. It hardly need be added, that although the great Buddha of the temple lifts its impassive bronze face up nearly a hundred feet into the air, the twin\n\n* Read before the Society on June 7th, 1875.\ntowers of the Cathedral mount still higher, and overtop the idol. There again, Christianity looks down upon heathenism. Crossing a small moat of running water, outside the west gate of this city, and travelling ten li to the west, in which distance two heavy dykes are crossed, the Hu-t'ou river (\u6ef9\u6cb1\u6cb3) is reached. To defend the city against the ravages of this river is the evident purpose of the dykes. The stream has its origin upon the western slope of the mountains which separate the provinces of Chih-li and Shan-lsi. We shall meet it again in the course of our journey. It has all the expansive and destructive powers peculiar to the streams of North-China; is not navigable at Ching-ting fu or any point above; and aside from irrigation serves no useful purpose, except turning a few rudely constructed water-wheels.\n\nWilliamson states in his Journeys in North-China, that the name of this stream is properly Poo-too Ho\u2014\"Grape River\" (\u8461\u8404\u6cb3), but is sometimes written Hu-t'ou river incorrectly. The above-named author however, is himself in error, the name given above being invariably found in all Chinese authorities, as well as being the name by which the stream is known all along its course. At the time it was crossed by the writer\u2014in October, 1874, it was very broad, but barely two feet at its greatest depth. The current was rapid and full of sand and earthy substances.\n\nSixty li west of Ching-ting fu, the traveller reaches Huai-lu hsien,\u2014properly pronounced Huo-lu hsien (\u7372\u9e7f\u7e23), a miserable town lying among the foot hills, and at the mouth of the valley, up which the road into Shan-hsi lies. This valley, at first broad, and filled with the pebbly debris from a hundred mountain streams, which in summer, foam and roar down the precipitous hill sides, soon narrowed into a deep-cut gorge,\u2014or rather, our road led into one of many gorges, which by their union form the valley. The mountain walls on either hand were, of dark-blue limestone,\u2014almost black,\u2014and so far as could be seen, bore no traces of fossils. Limestone seemed to be the only material entering into the composition of these hills, at least in their eastern faces, and large quantities of it were being quarried, and burned for building purposes. The mountain faces were bald and barren; but the gorge, up which the path led, was quite thickly populated, and the beautiful brook of mountain water flowing down its center, was turned aside to purposes of utility as well as beauty, and irrigated many little patches of cultivated ground, none of them larger than the floor of a good-sized drawing room.\n\nThe ascent grew more steep as we proceeded, until at a distance of some eight miles from the plain, the gorge shallowed out, and the road, climbing three miles more up the bare precipitous face of the mountain, at last gained the crest of the first range, and passed\nunder the \"Eastern Celestial Gate\" (\u6771\u5929\u9580). The view at this point was worthy the pencil of a painter. At the west, and almost beneath the traveller's feet, so precipitous were the slopes, lay a valley held in the lap of the hills, lifted here, and depressed there, but full of trees and villages; the hill-sides terraced to their summits, and yellow with the ungathered harvest, all lying in the shimmer of the hazy October sun which lit up one slope, and cast another into shadow; and, vibrating through the air, sounded the deep, sweet tone of a distant Temple bell, so deep, and so sweet, that it came, not as made by hands, but as the very throb and pulse of the atmosphere itself. This beautiful landscape seemed to be not without its elevating and refining influences upon the people whose happy lot it is to live in the midst of such beauty. For, as the writer stood drinking in the precious vision, there came near to him a ragged, dirty, verminous Chinese boy, busily engaged in his work as scavenger upon the public highway; and neatly tied to the handle of his basket, was a bunch of purple hare-bells, and other wild flowers!\n\nA few li of slipping and stumbling down the western face of this first line of hills, brings the traveller to a level\u2014only temporary\u2014in the bed of the \"Ching-hsing River\" (\u4e95\u9658\u6cb3). He sees a bright mountain stream of clear water, flashing and making music as it slips over its bed of pebbles and clean gravel. But by the road side, on the brink of the stream, stands a striking monument to the destructive force of the river when it rises in its strength. It\u2014the monument\u2014is the single remaining arch of a massive stone bridge, which once spanned the stream at this point, its central arch being not less than twenty-five feet above the ordinary water mark. The entire bridge has been carried away, this one arch, in the eastern approach to the bridge proper, alone remaining. When crossed by the writer, the stream was about twenty inches deep. It runs in a north-easterly direction, and is one of the main tributaries of the Hu-t'ou river. A large number of grist mills, run by water power, were found upon its banks. In each case, a few large stones were laid across the stream at a considerable distance above the mill, in order to divert a portion of the current to a sluice-way prepared to receive it. The sluice-way terminated in a small dam, so arranged as to give a fall of about three feet, and the water poured over this dam in two streams of unequal size, striking at a slight angle the floats of two upright wheels\u2014like a turbine, minus the inclosing case. Of course there is a very large loss of power. Upon the upper end of the vertical shaft of the larger wheel is fastened the nether millstone, which revolves with the wheel. The upper stone rests upon it and is chained, or roped to the building, to prevent its revolving from\nmotion communicated to it by the lower stone. The grain is fed from a hopper, through a circular opening, in the center of the upper stone. The smaller wheel drives the bolting apparatus. As a rule, the flume of these mills was not provided with any gate. When it was desired to stop the machinery, it was done by applying a brake to the nether millstone, and chaining it so as to prevent not only its revolutions, but those of the wheel as well. These mills were very common throughout the mountain regions of central and southern Shan-hsi.\n\nThe highway follows the course of this stream for a number of miles, going continually up its bed. It finally leaves it, a mile or more, south of Ching-hsing hsien (\u4e95\u9658\u7e23), a decayed and dying city lying upon the bank of the stream. Here again appeared another bridge, built of huge blocks of limestone, wrenched in two, in the middle, and one half destroyed and swept away by the flood. As has been already indicated, both slopes of this valley were susceptible of cultivation. The rock which had on the eastern slope, been all limestone, now alternated between limestone, and clay shale. Signs of coal were abundant, and in several places the mineral itself cropped out, in the cutting of the road along a bluff, or through a bank. At the point, a mile beyond Ching-hsing hsien, where the road finally leaves the river and commences to climb the second range of hills, were some rude furnaces for smelting iron, the ore being brought from a mine some five miles distant. Traces of iron were abundant, in the rock of the immediate vicinity.\n\nThe ascent of the second range was, perhaps, a trifle less precipitous than the first. The road was through a constant succession of villages, each having its own finely-cut gateways, or arches, of stone, at either extremity of the town. The houses were of a good class, for the most part being built of square blocks of limestone, well laid in good lime, and carefully pointed. A large proportion of them had flat and battlemented roofs, and in several instances, a short flight of steps at one corner of the roof was noticed, coming down from the roof to a point reachable by a ladder of moderate length and there ending, flush with the main wall of the building. As the road wound up nearer to the crest of the second line of hills, the foundation became again composed, almost exclusively of limestone, and coal measures and clay shale seemed to disappear in company. Five li below the crown of the ascent stands a stone Pai-lou on the sides of which are cut, respectively, \"Western limit of Chih-li\" and \"Eastern limit of Shan-hsi.\" And upon the crown of the ascent, stands the archway called the \"Northern Celestial Gate.\" Opportunity is here given, to such as desire, to return thanks\u2014in cash\u2014in one, or several temples to Buddha, for the safe ascent of the mountain. Five li down the western face,\nbrings the traveller to the Great Wall, which, as is well known, stretches an arm down this line of mountains between the two provinces. It is really little more than a line of towers, substantially built, surmounting the tops of the hills. Here is the Customs' barrier called Ku Kwan (\u56fa\u95dc).\n\nThe ascent of the third range, which commences only some two or three miles beyond the Customs' barrier is precipitous, and wild in the extreme. The path winds, twists, and turns up the rocky bed of a gorge, cut down deep in the heart of barren desolate mountains. The path is very tortuous, and the traveller frequently finds himself facing a solid wall of rock, hundreds of feet in height, and just as he is debating whether he must indeed, turn back or fly out, a crevice opens at one side, and he slips through that, only to be again confronted with overhanging cliffs, and to turn again. At numerous places the warning is cut into the rock by the path\u2014\"Beware of mountain floods, don't shelter from rain here.\" And the warning would seem to be timely.\n\nThis ascent, gloomy and wild, ends at last at the \"Western Celestial Gate,\" passing which the descent begins down the open face of the mountain. On every side were terraced hill slopes, and villages with their inevitable attending groves of trees. Every inch of ground seemed to be brought under cultivation. The mountain sides were cut into huge flights of stairs, and wheat fields, not large enough to turn a donkey of any enterprise around in, were terraced and notched into every ravine. At one point, fifty-seven distinct and separate terraces were counted, rising from the ravine at the bottom of a long hill side, to the little circle, twice as large as a dining table, which crowned its summit.\n\nA large, beautiful, and fertile valley, ends the western slope of this third range; and at the south-western point of this valley is situated the interesting, and prospectively important city of Ping-ting cho (\u5e73\u5b9a\u5dde). It lies in the center of a region of country, inexhaustible in its mineral resources. Coal and iron might almost be said to make up the hills on every side. It costs nothing to mine the ore, because it lies exposed on the surface of the hill slopes, and only the merest trifle to smelt it, because the coal is even more easily accessible than the iron. Under any proper system of development, this city would at no distant day become the Pittsburg, or Birmingham of China. At present, beautiful for situation, and full of undeveloped wealth, it is principally remarkable for the great number of pai-lous which adorn and obstruct its main street, and for the kindly disposition, and courteous demeanor of all its people, even down to \"the small boys.\"\n\nThe road bends sharply to the south as it leaves Ping-ting cho,\nand after a sharp climb of two miles reaches the summit of the last range of hills, crowned with the last, and \"Southern Celestial Gate.\" Here a picture finer even than any which had preceded it awaits the traveller, doubly beautiful, if he sees it, as the writer did, at sunrise. An oval basin, among the mountains, hollowed out at its bottom and in the direction of its longer diameter; a line of trees, showing where a stream ran; capping the trees, and twisting and writhing beneath the warm rays of the sun, just getting over the hill-tops, lay a long and slender fog line, growing smaller each moment as masses broke off, and wreathed, and rose, and vanished; the lower slopes of the hills terraced, under cultivation, and blocked off into unequal squares of green, from the newly sown wheat, or of yellow, from the ungathered millet; higher up, the bare mountain faces banded with broad stripes of chocolate, and purple, and blue, and grey, and black, from the various mineral substances of which they were composed; and capping all, the many pointed crown of the circling hills. Such was the picture lying there, food for the eyes of the weary traveller as he rests a moment from his steep climb, and gathers breath for his no less precipitous descent. The road winds down into this valley, and follows up the stream for many miles, until it comes to its source among the hills at the southwest. Here the character of the scenery changes as if by magic. Gravel, sand, rocks, and bare mountains, which had formed the characteristic features of the way, suddenly disappear, and in their stead is a table-land, or more correctly a water-shed of yellow slippery clay. Great yawning gullies gape on every side, and deep cuts through the clayey soil continually hide the traveller as he follows his path in its tortuous course along this water-shed. There is still some climbing to be done, until as Shih-lieh is reached, the traveller seems to have gained at last the very ridge-pole of the world, and to stand at an altitude where he can literally \"look down\" upon all the kingdoms and cities of the globe. Indeed this whole pass, although containing some descents is still literally climbing one enormous flight of stairs, stretching over a hundred and fifty miles in length, from Ching-ting fu in Chih-li to Shih-lieh in Shan-hsi. The soil however does not vary, after the sudden change noticed above, but continues the same throughout the greater portion of the province last named.\n\nT'ai-yuen fu, the provincial capital, lies in the extreme northern point of a district which may be called the \"Central plain of Shan-hsi.\" Immediately outside the north gate of the city, a rather low range of hills stretches across, in nearly a western course, and separates this plateau from one still more elevated at the north. The great road which we have followed through the mountain\npass from the plain of Chih-li debouches upon this central plain about ten miles to the south-east of the provincial capital.\n\nThis plain is the garden of Shan-hsi, and so far as the writer's observation extends, of all north China. Its general direction is to the south-west, and it has a length of about ninety-five English miles, by an average breadth of, say eighteen. Along its western border, flows the Fan river (\u6c7e\u6cb3), of no value here except for general purposes of irrigation. Frequent smaller streams come down from the mountains which surround this basin, and these are all utilized, in a manner which puts into most favorable light the far-sightedness of the people, for watering the numerous and carefully cultivated fields. Channels are carefully constructed for these streams, and as carefully kept in order, and suitable gates, frequently of stone, are prepared here and there, by which the water can be let on to any man's land at will. By this care, these streams are carried many miles, and made to increase the fertility and productiveness of large areas of country. The soil is in a high state of cultivation, and supports a very dense population. The hills on every side are rich in coal and iron, the former mainly bituminous and of the best quality; the latter famous all over the empire for its toughness and strength. In the mountains directly west of T'ai-yuen fu, are large deposits of sulphur, which are the personal property of the emperor, and from which large supplies are drawn for preparing munitions of war. Large quantities of cotton, wheat, and millet are grown, besides tobacco and some opium. West of the Fan river, is a large area, close under the hills, almost exclusively given up to the cultivation of the grape. The grapes are unusually large, and of delicious flavor. They were sold to the writer, at about two cents a catty, which, as was subsequently learned, was about double the proper price. North of the grape region, and also west of the Fan river, is a large cluster of villages given exclusively to the manufacture of paper, while still north of them is another the sole business of which is mat weaving. The style of architecture was very noticeable, indicating not only thrift, and a population on the whole well-to-do, but also possessing not a little taste and sense of the beautiful. A large proportion of the houses were built of good kiln-dried brick, comparatively few mud houses were seen, and it was quite common to see these brick residences, built with towers, and a battlemented wall surrounding a courtyard, reminding one strongly of the castles and noble residences of Great Britain and the continent of Europe. These premises would hardly bear very close or searching inspection, but their outlines were in many instances decidedly beautiful, and spoke well for the character of their occupants. In short, everything in this plain,\u2014or perhaps more properly, basin,\u2014\nbetokened an amount of thrift, intelligence, and taste, far above that found among the inhabitants of Chih-li, or other portions of North-China visited by the writer. There are three large centers of trade in this basin,\u2014namely Ta\u2018i-yuen fu, the capital, Fan-how fu on the western edge of the plain and about midway between its northern and southern extremeties, and \u201cPing-yao hsien\u201d (\u5e73\u9059\u7e23), on the great road and nearer the eastern border.\n\nThe great highway, having kept along the eastern edge of the basin through its entire length, and consequently at a very considerable distance from the Fan river, comes into the narrow valley of this river at the lower extremity of the Central plain, and follows along its gorge for about twenty-five miles, to a point ten li south of Ling-shih hsien (\u9748\u77f3\u7e23). Here the stream makes a long curve to the west, while the great road climbs the mountains, crossing at the Han-hou pass (\u97d3\u4faf\u5dba). The bluffs, of clay shale, on either bank of the river for the entire twenty-five miles mentioned above, are literally full of coal, both anthracite and bituminous being found of the best quality and in greatest abundance. As an illustration of the exceeding cheapness with which many kinds of manufacturing industries are carried on, take the following. At one point, a pottery was visited, which made large quantities of the common ware in use among the Chinese, but of a quality rather above the average. The clay, of fine quality, was found in the bluff, and cost merely the labour of digging,\u2014that is about ten cents a day, and coal for burning the crockery was to be had, in inexhaustible quantities and of most excellent quality, for three cents per hundred catties, or about forty-five Mexican dollar cents per ton! In different points in the province, all the necessary materials for manufacturing common window and bottle glass, were found in equal quantities and equally cheap.\n\nThe Han-hou mountains lie in a cluster rather than in an extended line, and fill up the entire space between the two main lines of hills on the eastern and western borders of Shan-hsi, except a very narrow and circuitous gorge, through which the Fan river finds its way. They thus separate the central plain of Shan-hsi, from the smaller and lower Ping-yang fu (\u5e73\u967d\u5e9c) basin, which I will soon describe. The foundation of these mountains seems to be a clay rock, friable and quickly decomposing on exposure to the atmosphere. The cuttings for the roadway through the clay soil are very deep, and the pitch of the road exceedingly great, more than at any point in the pass between Chih-li and Shan-hsi. But the roadway being for the most part smooth and devoid of stones, affords better foot-hold for animals, and is more easily travelled than the other, except during rainy\nweather. Then it would probably be so slippery as to be exceedingly difficult, if not absolutely impassible.\n\nThroughout these hills there is the same beautiful banding of colors spoken of above, and mines of coal are frequent, while unmined seams and measures of coal, are to be found everywhere. Sheep raising is a common occupation, while the less precipitous hill slopes are carefully terraced and sown with wheat and millet, or planted with cotton or potatoes. The style of architecture is quite peculiar. On the slopes of the mountains, whole villages are to be seen, in which the houses are built tier above tier, the flat roof of the lower tier forming the front yard to the tier next above, while the roofs of that tier serve the same purpose for their more exalted neighbours. The house itself is simply an arch laid in brick, about fifteen feet in length, with a diameter of ten feet, and height, to crown, of about eight feet. The rear end of this arch being generally in the hill, has a wall of solid mountain enclosing it, while the front end, is bricked up and fitted with door and windows. This style of architecture proves to be so satisfactory that it was found to be quite commonly adopted, even out on the level plain. Huo-cho (\u970d\u5dde), a miserable opium-stricken city, lies in a valley in the midst of this mountain pass, where the road for a short distance dips down again to the banks of the Fan river. Here large numbers of grist mills are found, driven by water power, and all grinding wheat. The flour is carried up the valley and over the pass into the central plain in great quantities, where it finds ready market; mules and donkeys, mainly the latter, are the means of transportation. The wheat is grown in the deep gorges along the river-side, and is said to be of a superior quality.\n\nThe Han-hou pass is about sixty miles in length, extending from near Chieh-hsin hsien (\u4ecb\u4f11\u7e23) to Chao-ch\u00eang hsien (\u8d99\u57ce\u7e23). Near the latter city the descent is made to the Ping-yang fu basin, a section of country about forty miles in length by eight or ten in width, and lying along the same stream the course of which we have followed so long. The principal centers of trade here, are the cities of Chao-ch\u00eang hsien and Hung-lung-hsien (\u6d2a\u6d1e\u7e23), the more pretentious city of Ping-yang fu being in a state of chronic decay and desolation, owing evidently to an excess of alcohol and opium. Great care is given to proper irrigation upon this plain; in one instance at least, a very considerable stream of water being carried by an aqueduct over another stream, in its course to the fields needing its moisture. The growth of grain is less upon this plain than upon its northern neighbour, while the areas devoted to cotton and opium have increased considerably. This basin is decidedly inferior to the one heretofore described, whether\nregard be had to beauty of prospect, quality of soil, variety of products, or the thrift and general intelligence of the people, or lastly to the density of population. Yet it is superior in the writer's opinion to the plain of Chih-li, in perhaps all these respects, save the one of density of population. Coal and iron abound in the hills.\n\nTwelve miles below Ping-yang fu the road bids a final farewell to the Fan river, which at this point turns more to the westward, which course it keeps until it is swallowed up in the Huang-ho (\u9ec4\u6cb3), while the highway enters another low pass, precisely similar in general character and appearance to the last described, though shorter and less difficult. This low range of hills serves to separate the Ping-yang fu basin from the southern plain of Shan-hsi. This plain extends from the city of W\u00ean-hsi hsien (\u805e\u559c\u7e23), which lies nearly in its north-eastern apex, to the Yellow river, a distance of a hundred and fifteen miles. For about half this distance the plain has mountains on three sides, but finally those on the west, end abruptly in one bold peak, and the plain in that direction is limited by the Yellow river. The character of the soil is essentially the same as that of the Ping-yang fu basin. The areas devoted to the cultivation of cotton and opium have increased, while there has been a corresponding decrease in the acreage of the cereals, and a resultant decrease in the prosperity and intelligence of the people. Large orchards of persimmon trees, grafted, are found, and not infrequently the traveller meets with apparatus by which persimmon whiskey is distilled. The process is simple. The fruit is partially dried in the sun, then mashed to a pulp, and the liquor produced from the fermentation of this pulp is subjected to a process of distillation. The product tastes not unlike a poor quality of Scotch whiskey.\n\nOn the eastern edge of this plain, close under the bordering hills, lies an extensive salt marsh. It is the exclusive property of the emperor; is placed under the superintendence of a Tau-t'ai; and is farmed out to companies who manufacture the salt. The process is the ordinary one of solar evaporation, and of purification by water, leached through clay, and needs no description here. The product is carried into Ho-nan and Shen-hsi, besides supplying the central and southern portions of Shan-hsi. The most important trade-centers of this plain, are Lu-t'sun (\u76e7\u6751) and Chieh-cho (\u89e3\u5dde), at the northern and southern extremities of this salt marsh. W\u00ean-hsi hsien is also a place of very considerable trade.\n\nP'u-cho fu (\u84b2\u5dde\u5e9c) lies on a level with the Yellow river,\nand on the edge of a large extent of worthless marsh land, full of pools of brackish, and in some places, positively salt water. A descent of several hundred feet must be made in getting from the plain of P'u-cho fu to the marsh in which the city itself stands. The city has the general appearance of having slipped from the plain on which it ought to have stood, down into this quagmire,\u2014and to have slipped down from all prosperous growth, and general respectability at the same time. The business of the place is confined to a single dirty street in the eastern suburb. The great road does not pass into the town, having succeeded in maintaining its position on the high ground from which the town has backslid. In the pools of salt water upon the plain, or marsh, surrounding the city, a species of shrimp was found in great numbers, differing somewhat, yet bearing a strong family resemblance to the one ordinarily seen. The great road keeping to the bluff, runs on, turning first south, and then a trifle to the east of south, until the road, the bluff, and Shan-hsi, all end together, making a sudden plunge down a precipice and being lost in the dirty waters of the Yellow river.\n\nAt this point, the three provinces of Shan-hsi, Ho-nan, and Shen-hsi abut upon each other, the river forming the line of division between the first named and the others. The banks just at this point are very steep, and the river, narrowed in between these walls, runs with very great rapidity. It is barely half a mile in width. Williamson states that it was so deep that no bottom could be found by sounding as they crossed. But when it was crossed by the writer, it was nowhere more than six feet deep, and on returning, three of the boatmen sprang into the water in midstream and waded ashore, carrying a line from the ferry-boat to prevent us from rapidly drifting down with the current. The water was just up to their hips. The boat is carried nearly a mile down stream in crossing, and to get from bank to bank is good work for a half day; at least the writer found it so, both times, when he crossed. There seems to be a small amount of traffic on the river for boats drawing when loaded, not more than twelve inches,\u2014and a small Chinese gunboat, of the same fashion as those common on the Pei-ho at Tientsin, was lying at the ferry. The fact seems to be, that this river in many places spreads out to an enormous width,\u2014as it does at a point a few miles above this crossing, and becomes correspondingly shallow,\u2014so shallow as to be impassible to boats of any draft. The large, thriving, business-like city, lying upon the western bank, opposite the ferry, is not, as the above quoted author calls it Tung-kwan (\u6771\u95dc) \"The Eastern Fortress,\" but Tu'ng-kwan (\u6f7c\u95dc).\n\nThe hills on the Shen-hsi bank are very steep and high. They are\nthe range in which the famous Hua-shan (\u83ef\u5c71), one of China's sacred mountains is found. They rise in very abrupt ascent from the bank of the Yellow river, and clinging to their sides, its walls dipping down into the ravines, and capping the highest summits, is the city and fortification of Tu'ng-kwan. The walls and gate-towers are high and in excellent repair, and in conjunction with the bare, brown, hill sides, and their clean-cut sky-line, form a picture peculiarly Chinese, and by no means devoid of beauty.\n\nFrom Tu'ng-kwan to Hsi-an fu (\u897f\u5b89\u5e9c), the capital of the province, the road runs in a direction nearly due west, through a most lovely section of country, having the range of high hills just mentioned upon the south, and the Wei river (\u6e2d\u6cb3), on the north.\n\nThe road lies through one long orchard, and the walled towns and cities lie thickly along, for the most part at a little distance from the highway.\n\nThe only uncomfortable part of the picture was the one or two large towns and cities which had been destroyed during the Mohammedan rebellion, and had not been rebuilt. Hua-cho (\u83ef\u5dde), the city where it first broke out, was in a state of the most utter desolation. Near that city was a genuine bit of wild, New England scenery, with its moss-covered granite rocks and boulders, its many springs of beautiful water, and its thickets of evergreen trees and shrubs. It seemed lost, and out of place, in the midst of scenery which was so unlike it.\n\nAt Lin-tu'ng-hsien (\u81e8\u6f7c\u7e23) is a very large fountain of hot water, bursting from the rocks at the base of the hills, just outside the south gate of the city. Numerous baths have been constructed at the fountain by the Chinese, and the warm water having assisted to cleanse the soiled sons of Han, makes its way down the slope and into the Wei river, by two streams, its course traceable from a distance by the threads of vapor hanging in the air above it.\n\nFrom this point the great road descends very gradually for about five miles, and thus reaches and crosses the marshy bed of a small affluent of the Wei. The traveller crosses this stream upon a fine bridge of wood, resting upon stone piers, and then sees in front, the perpendicular face of a bluff, several hundred feet in height, its face honey-combed with the residences of troglodytic Chinese, whole villages of whom are found snugly ensconced on eligible building sites, having an eastern exposure and protected against the cold winds from the north and west. These villages are composed of those who cultivate the bottom-land near by, and which cannot be built upon as it is flooded several times each year.\nAscending this bluff by a path cut through its face, the traveller comes out upon another plain, and sees at a distance of three miles, the high towers and finely built walls of Si-ngan fu (\u897f\u5b89\u5e9c), the provincial capital, and the ancient capital of the empire. Standing out upon the plain in bold relief, unobscured by trees or other obstructions, it presents a finer appearance than Peking, or any Chinese city yet visited by the writer. The east and west gate-towers are especially fine, being unsurpassed, even by the lofty ones found in the present capital. The walls are high, broad, and kept in excellent repair, and within them is a dense and busy crowd of people. Careful examination of all sections of the city, failed to develop any considerable areas of vacant space. The entire city appeared to be closely built over, and to be crowded with inhabitants. The population is somewhat heterogeneous, being composed of natives of Shen-hsi, Shan-hsi, Ho-nan, Kan-suh, Sze-chuen, not to mention a Manchu garrison of some five thousand families, and a note-worthy sprinkling of Mongols. Thibetans were also seen about the streets. The city is third in population in North-China, Peking and Tientsin only out-numbering it. The old wall enclosing the imperial residence, and some of the palace buildings are still standing. The market is excellent, vegetables of all sorts, with a great variety of fine fruits and nuts, appearing upon the streets every day. The quantity and variety of foreign goods exposed for sale in the fine large shops is something surprising and remarkable. The greater portion of these are obtained from Hankow (\u6f22\u53e3), though some come overland from Russia. So far as could be learned, there is no foreign trade between this city and Tientsin. Indeed, the shortest route to Tientsin in point of time,\u2014is via Hankow and Shanghai. The number of shops given up to the trade in opium is alarming, and the percentage of opium-smokers in the population seems to be much greater than in Chih-li.\n\nHaving thus traversed Shan-hsi from its capital\u2014T'ai-yuen fu\u2014to its southern extremity, allow the traveller to retrace his steps, and from that city as a starting point, to explore in a hasty way, the northern sections of the province.\n\nImmediately outside the north gate of T'ai-yuen, rises a low range of hills, a spur thrown out from the longer range at the east, and which the tourist crossed in the early part of this paper. This range forms the northern limit to the plain on which the city stands. The Fan river at this point makes a sharp turn to the west, and comes down a gorge at a point where the hill-line is quite low, close under the main line of western hills.\n\nThe great road north from T'ai-yuen fu,\u2014through Y\u00ean-mun kuan (\u96c1\u9580\u95dc), and thence to Ta-t'ung fu (\u5927\u540c\u5e9c), where it forks,\none branch continuing north-west to Knei-hua ch'\u00eang (\u6b78\u5316\u57ce), and one north-east to Chang-chia k'ou (\u5f35\u5bb6\u53e3), Kulgan\u2014cuts this line of hills immediately after leaving the gates of the provincial center. The ascent from the south, through the deep cutting, worn by the travel of centuries, in the loess of which the hills are composed, may be two or three hundred feet in excess of the descent upon the north side, which is slight. The road is nearly straight, and good, but not equal to the demands of travel which are very great indeed. These hills, being low and entirely devoid of rocks, are, for the most part, under cultivation. This line of hills forms a water-shed between the head-waters of certain tributaries to the Huang-ho (\u9ec3\u6cb3) and the Pei-ho (\u5317\u6cb3), all streams south of this range finding their way into the former, and all above it into the latter. Having passed this water-shed, the traveller finds himself upon a plateau of slightly rolling ground, the longest diameter of which runs nearly due east and west. It is walled in, by what may fairly be called mountains, upon the east and north, and by hills of moderate elevation, upon the west. The products of the soil indicate a higher altitude than the plains further south. Oats, Irish potatoes, and millet are the staples. Wheat is grown in but small quantities. Coal, or coke prepared from the coal, is the only fuel used, and it is abundant, and in consequence very cheap. Hsin-cho (\u65b0\u5dde), and Tai-cho (\u4ee3\u5dde), are the principal cities, while there are a large number of thriving market towns scattered about. The population, although less in proportion to area than in the center of the province, is still quite dense, and gives evidence of a fair degree of thrift and intelligence. A very fair quality of slate is found in inexhaustible quantities, in the mountains at the east of this plateau, near the Hu-tou river, which here enters the mountains and makes its way to the plain of Chih-li, near Ching-ting fu where we have seen it. And, rising somewhat above their fellows, in the north-eastern corner of this plateau, are the mountains famous and sacred in Buddhistic annals as Wu-t'ai shan (\u4e94\u81fa\u5c71). They seem to form the culminating peaks of all these lines of hills and mountains, and while their summits are not clothed in everlasting snows, they are condemned to stand in everlasting sterility. Down their slopes, and in their narrow ravines, are found the only two crops which grow in their inhospitable neighbourhood, oats, and Buddhist priests. The first are of good quality, but the yield is small. Of the second the yield is ample, but the quality bad. These mountains are accessible from three points. A mule-path will take the traveller to their fastnesses in four or five days, from Pao-ting fu, from which city they lie due west. Or from T'ai-yuan fu, he may go north\nand east, upon the plain which we have just crossed, to Wu-t'ai hsien (\u4e94\u81fa\u7e23), from which point a bridle-path, through country rough and wild in the extreme, will take him by a journey of forty miles to the sacred mountains. The third and most commonly travelled route, brings in the pilgrims from Mongolia. It is impassable for carts, for a distance of about fifty miles from the town, which is the center of the mountains. No one of these peaks is higher in any considerable degree than the others, and the view from the summit of any one is not extensive, being limited to the rough sea of hills, mountain-peaks, ravines, winding gorges, and precipices, which fill the horizon in all directions. There are immense beds of a very superior quality of bituminous coal in these mountains, and the coal is sold for about half a dollar a ton. Insufficient transportation would, however, make it more expensive, delivered in Peking than the best English coal.\n\nThe \"Mongol Pilgrim Road\" out of Wu-t'ai shan, takes a course due west, and having surmounted one of the steepest of the many hills, meets with one of the main tributaries of the Hu-t'ou river at its source, in a beautiful spring, far up the western side of this hill. The path follows the tiny thread of water down the mountain side, and into the cheerless winding gorge which yawns to receive it at the bottom. It follows this stream when it has become a brawling noisy brook, still in this deep mountain walled gorge, and when it has grown into a deeper and more quiet stream, still the pathway keeps by its side, in many turns and twists, but with a general westerly course, until having reached the plain, the stream turns to the north, while the path, now grown to a cart-road still keeps due west to Tai-cho. Here it turns north, and enters the great road to Ta-t'ung fu, at Nan-k'ou (\u5357\u53e3), the southern mouth of the Y\u00ean-m\u00ean kuan (\u96c1\u9580\u95dc).\n\nThis pass, only about fifteen miles long, is in the range of mountains forming the northern boundary of the plain just left. The descent upon the northern slope, is again, much less than the ascent from the southern side. The roadway is for the most part good, speaking from a Chinese point of view, but very slippery and dangerous to animals in winter, from the ice which covers it in great sheets. On its northern declivity the inner line of the great wall is passed, a continuation of the wall seen at Nan-k'ou\u2014thirty miles north of Peking.\n\nOf the plain of Ta-t'ung fu, the northern plateau of Shan-hsi, little need be said. It extends, with but slight variations in its surface, away to the steppes of Mongolia, and is for the most part a miserable, dreary waste, with a poor thin soil of drifting sand, and a sparse, and half-starved population. Its hills, bordering upon the east and west, are rich in coal and iron. Ta-t'ung fu\nthe one city of importance upon it, has considerable trade in these two commodities, but seems to be in a chronic condition of demoralization and decay. A large proportion of the area inclosed within the city walls is vacant, only occupied with the debris of fallen buildings, and, so far as could be discovered, not a single public building was in a creditible state of repair.\n\nIt should be said, in conclusion, that the observations recorded here, were made during a missionary tour of about three months' duration. This may serve to account for the somewhat superficial character of the observations, as the traveller's time was mainly given to other things than to the study of the geography, or the resources of the country.\n\nAs illustrating the peaceful nature, and kind disposition, of the people, it should also be remarked that throughout the entire journey no trouble of any sort was experienced from them, and as a rule, to which there were at most but few exceptions, cordial greetings and a pleasant reception were everywhere met with. Landlords were for the most part courteous in their treatment, and moderate in their charges; officials showed no disposition to place obstacles of any sort in the traveller's way; and the people, few of whom had met with foreigners before, were curious, but as a rule, not rude.\n\nThe journey was throughout pleasant, instructive, and satisfactory beyond expectation.\nARTICLE III.\n\nSHORT NOTES ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE YU\u00c8-TI AND KIANG TRIBES OF ANCIENT CHINESE HISTORY.*\n\nBy T. W. KINGSMILL.\n\nWHEN engaged last year in preparing some notes on the probably recent elevation of Central Asia, I had occasion to insert some remarks with regard to the tribes handed down in Chinese history as the \u6708\u5ead (in modern Chinese Yu\u00e8ti). None of the identifications usually accepted for those tribes seemed to tally with the circumstances of the case, and finding myself without external evidence, I suggested from philological motives alone that the word Vidal would be found an approximation to the actual name of the tribes.\n\nI was unaware at the time that M. Vivien de St. Martin had, in a review of the destruction of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, from historic grounds identified the so-called Yu\u00e8ti with the White Huns, the Hai\u00e1thalah, the Ephthalites of the Greek writers, who about the year 134 B.C. overran that country, and finally destroyed the Grecian dynasty which from the time of Alexander's death had been paramount.\n\nVidhal rather than Vidal should have been the rendering of the old Chinese name, and as this may be considered as identical with the Greek name for the tribe,\u2014the Ephthalites, as well as its Arabic form Hai\u00e1thalah, it may be interesting to review the grounds on which this reconstruction of the ancient sounds of the characters was founded.\n\nThe characters made use of to express the name of the tribes, have in their present form no meaning; they were at first only used as phonetic elements. To arrive at their archaic sounds it will be necessary, however, to analyse their separate meanings; and endeavour if possible to find their analogues in some language making use of an alphabet. Such we find in Sanscrit,\u2014a language having many relations with primitive Chinese.\n\nTaking then the Chinese characters separately, we find the first \u6708 Yu\u00e8, the moon, in Cantonese, the nearest existing dialect to\n\n* Read before the Society on June 7th, 1875.\nthat spoken at the beginning of Chinese history, \u00dat or Y\u00fc\u00e8t; the second \u5e95 ti, in Cantonese tai, meaning fundamental, radical, reaching to the ground. Comparing these words with Sanscrit we find the first represented by a word vidhu, with the same meaning. Bopp gives no derivation, nor does he mention any analogues amongst Aryan languages. It may therefore be fairly accepted as a non-Aryan term for the moon which found acceptance in Sanscrit. The form tai for the second syllable seems to point to a lost liquid termination, l or r, more probably the former. Tai will thus agree in its original sound with the Sanscrit tal, condere. This root is one of extensive distribution; in Sanscrit it gives tala, solum, fundus; in Latin tellus; in Chinese \u5730 ti, the earth, \u5e95 ti, fundamental, &c.\n\nFrom analogy therefore the combination of the two characters would have been pronounced Vidh-tal, Vidal or Vidhal; thus corresponding with the actual name of the tribes as handed down from other sounds.\n\nSimilar reasons would lead me to identify the Kiang tribes of the Chinese with the Kurus of the Indian legends. The change of r into Chinese ng is of the commonest; C\u00fbra, hero, reads Kung in Chinese; kara, tribute, Kung; mri, mori, mong or wang, &c.\n\nThe dawn of Hindoo story finds the Kurus in Central Asia, whence they succeeded in effecting a lodgment in North-western India. The dawn of Chinese legends brings them in contact with the ancestors of the Chinese along their western frontier.\n\nThey are more or less allied to the Yu\u00e8ti, but there is some difficulty in agreeing with the Chinese as to their descent from the Sanmiaou of the Shooking.\n\nThe contest of the Kurus and the P\u00e2ndavas in early Indian legend seems to indicate a struggle between the Scythian and Aryan races for supremacy. The Chinese describe the Kiang as nomadic and little given to agriculture, and this character would probably best suit their compatriots in India.\n\nThe Kurus were, however, advanced to a certain stage of civilization, and Kurukshetra, the plain of the Kurus, becomes the cradle of Indian culture. It is there that the gods themselves offer sacrifice, and here was fought the battle of Panniput. The eponym Kuru founds the two families of the Pandavas by whom the arts were introduced into Hindoostan. He therefore appears to correspond with the Chinese mythical hero Shin-nung or Kiang \u59dc who fashioned timber into ploughs and taught the people husbandry. The legend of Shin-nung belongs to a different cycle from that of the Chow tribes. We read nothing of it in the earlier\nauthors of the Chow dynasty, and the Book of Poetry is silent. It in great part belongs to that period of the early Han when communication with India seems for a time to have been constant, and which has given a distinctly Indian aspect to the later Chinese legends.\n\nKuru was the son of Agnidhra, King of Jambudwipa, while the Chinese story makes Kiang the son of Ngan-teng, its nearest analogue. Ngan-teng was a princess, but changes of sex make little difference in mythology. Kuru dwelt in the Sweta mountain, Mons Candidus, as did Kiang by the Liet-shan of similar meaning, while the former is associated with the Kurab, as the latter with the Kiang-shui river.\n\nThese short notes are only intended to show that in the early Chinese legends, which have hitherto been looked upon as unconnected with those of other countries, there really exists a bond of common origin with those preserved to us in Indian literature. To comprehend this connection thoroughly will need an intimate knowledge of the ancient literature of both countries, to which no one has as yet attained. Points of similarity as well as of difference have in comparative mythology their meaning and power, and we shall be better able to trace the early movements of mankind when we have compared the oldest forms of these legends.\nMAP FROM THE KING SHI TA TIEH, Published A.D. 1831. REPRESENTING THE MONGOL DOMINIONS IN CENTRAL & WESTERN ASIA.\nARTICLE IV.\n\nNOTICES OF THE MEDIEVAL GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN ASIA.\n\nDrawn from Chinese and Mongol writings, and compared with the observations of Western authors in the Middle ages.*\n\nBy E. BRETSCHNEIDER, M.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe restlessly progressing civilization of Europe has led to a high development of the faculties and the critical judgment of European nations. Every day science unveils mysteries and facts, which have been hidden from human knowledge for many thousand years. It is also a merit of our times to have delivered science from all the fables and hypotheses, with which ancient scholars were so much pleased. It is now a rule adopted for all branches of knowledge, that in scientific researches, the leading idea must be to bring to light the truth. With respect to some sciences,\u2014as for instance geography,\u2014this aim can be attained with more or less completeness by means of direct observations. But as to history, and especially history of remote times, we depend entirely upon the statements and views of ancient chroniclers, whose style is often far from being clear, whilst the veracity of their reports is not always to be relied on. The same must be said with respect to ancient geographical accounts and narratives of travels. For researches in these departments it is therefore of great importance, to compare the statements of several contemporaneous authors who have written on the same subject. Judging from this point of view, it seems to me that the ancient historical and geographical accounts of the Chinesc, as far as they treat of nations, countries and events spoken of also by western writers, present a high interest; all the more so, when we have to compare statements on the same subject of nations so diametrically different in their mode of viewing things. In a recently published paper (Notes on Chinese Medi\u00e6val Travellers to the West) I tried to review the narratives of some Chinese travellers to western Asia in the Mongol period, which permit a\n\n* Read before the Society, on November 29th, 1875.\ncomparison with the accounts of those western medi\u00e6val travellers, who went to eastern Asia in the same 13th century. Now I venture to lay before the reader a paper of kindred character. In the present essay I wish to render accessible to European scholars interested in Asiatic history and geography, some accounts of this subject found in ancient Chinese and Mongol works, and referring to the days of Mongol supremacy in Asia. As I have access to many special sources of information, with respect to eastern Asiatic literature, I have been enabled to gather a considerable amount of additional material bearing on the history and the geographical knowledge of that period. These eastern sources of information will generally prove to be meagre and fragmentary; and sometimes they only become intelligible, when compared with the detailed records left behind by the Arabian and Persian chroniclers; but they have nevertheless a considerable interest, and we shall see, that much fresh light is thrown by Chinese and Mongol writers, in corroboration of the statements of European medi\u00e6val travellers across the Asiatic continent, and in elucidating dubious questions with respect to Asiatic history and geography.\n\nThe object, which it was originally proposed to accomplish by the publication of this paper, was the explanation of an ancient Chinese map of western and central Asia, and even eastern Europe, dating from the first half of the 14th century. But in commenting on this map, I was induced to examine for the corroboration of my views, the Chinese historical works of the Mongol period; and I found, that it would be useful for the understanding of the slender information furnished by the ancient map, to give a short but coherent account of the warlike enterprises of the Mongols in the western part of Asia and in eastern Europe, according to the Mohammedan authors, and to add all the information on the same subject, which I have been able to find in Chinese and Mongol works.\n\nI divide my paper into six parts.\n\nIn the first, I review the writings of eastern and western authors, to which reference is made in this essay.\n\nIn the second, I give a full account of the Kara-khitai or Si Liao, an interesting nation originating in eastern Asia, who in the 12th century dominated over the whole of central Asia, and was finally destroyed by Chinghiz khan.\n\nIn the third, I have attempted to bring together the accounts found in Chinese and Mongol medi\u00e6val works with respect to the Mohammedans.\n\nThe fourth and the fifth parts are devoted to the record of the military doings of the Mongols in the far west.\nThe sixth part treats of the above-mentioned ancient map of central and western Asia.\n\nIt may be the proper place here, for a few remarks regarding the Chinese mode of rendering foreign words and proper names, and my mode of romanizing Chinese sounds. In rendering Chinese sounds, representing foreign words met with in Chinese works of the Yuan period, I have found that to use the Russian mode of spelling (in roman letters), restores the original words more closely than any other of the numerous systems invented by the sinologues of various nations. This is easily understood. The official and other documents, on which the Yuan shi or Chinese \"History of the Mongol dynasty,\" and many other Chinese works of that time are based, have been written (in Chinese, or translated into Chinese from the Mongol) in Peking; and the Russian pronunciation of Chinese sounds, established first more than fifty years ago by Father Hyacinth, and adopted subsequently with some insignificant changes by all Russian sinologues, refers to the Peking Mandarin dialect. I have little doubt, that the Peking pronunciation in the days of the Mongols was the same as now. When casting his eyes upon the ancient Chinese map, a facsimile of which is appended to this paper, the reader will admit that with a few exceptions, all the names of countries and places in western Asia are rendered as exactly by the Chinese sounds as the language permits; and when examining the other map, where the Chinese sounds are romanized according to the Russian system, he will easily recognize the Persian or Arabic names intended. It would in some cases be very difficult to identify the names found on the ancient map had I adopted the English or French mode of spelling. Fearing however lest my pleading in favour of the Russian system might prejudice some English linguists, I confess that I am completely ignorant of linguistic theories, and of the rules to be followed in romanizing Chinese and other sounds. I can judge this matter only from a practical point of view.\n\nIt is known, that the Chinese, when rendering a foreign word are obliged to represent every syllable by one of their characters, which are all monosyllabic. But it is not always possible to render correctly the sounds of other languages by Chinese characters. This is the case with the syllables terminating in a consonant. With the exception of n or ng, the Chinese sounds of the Mandarin dialect never have a consonant at the end. Thus the Chinese in rendering the name Thalas, Djand, Nakshab, Chach, are obliged to write \u5854\u524c\u601d T'a-la-sze \u7d0d\u7684 Djan-di, \u90a3\u9ed1\u6c99\u4e0d Na-hei-sha-bu, \u5bdf\u8d64 C'ha-chi (see the ancient map). Sometimes again they do not attempt to render the terminal consonant, e.g. Djambalik, Almalik and Pulad, are termed on the map \u5f6d\u516b\u91cc\nDjang-ba-li, \u963f\u529b\u9ebb\u91cc A-li-ma-li and \u666e\u524c P'u-la. It is difficult for a European to pronounce a Chinese character sounding like \u8033 or \u5152. This sound is rendered culh by French sinologues, which seems to me quite a corrupt spelling; for it is (in Peking at least) the nearest to our r (with rattling), and Russian sinologues render it simply by r, whilst the English write urh. The rule for spelling foreign names adopted by the Chinese of the Mongol period, proves that in some cases, characters like \u8033 and \u5152 were considered as equivalents for our r. Thus they write \u99ac\u624e\u5152 Ma-dja-r, \u6492\u9ebb\u8033\u5e72 Sa-mu-r-kan, \u5e16\u6728\u5152 T'ie-mu-r, for Madjar (Hungaria), Samarcan, Timur. At the present day the Chinese always render our r, or the syllables ri, ra, ru, by characters sounding li, la, lu; and occasionally the Chinese of the Mongol period followed the same rule; e.g. we read on the ancient map, \u6731\u91cc\u7ae0 Dju-li-djang, \u5408\u523a\u706b\u8005 Ho-la-huo-djo, \u6492\u91cc\u77db Sa-li-ya, intended for Djurdjan, Kara-khodjo, Saria.\n\nPART I. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES.\n\n1. IT has appeared desirable to put at the head of this essay, a critical review of the works, from which the information dealt with in these pages has been derived. I may begin with the Chinese and Mongol literature.\n\nAmong the Chinese works extant, treating of the history and geography of Asia in the 13th and 14th centuries, the \u5143\u53f2 Yuan shi, or Chinese \"History of the Mongol Dynasty\" without doubt takes the first rank. It is only to be regretted, that the work has been compiled with great carelessness by the Chinese scholars of the Ming dynasty, who had been entrusted with this task. In the Annals of the Ming shi or \"History of the Ming,\" sub anno 1369 (a year after the expulsion of the Mongols from China), I find the following statement, with respect to the compilation of the Yuan shi. In the above-mentioned year (the Ming) the detailed records of the reigns of the thirteen Yuan emperors (\u5143\u5341\u4e09\u671d\u5be6\u9304) were procured, and the emperor (Hung-wu) gave orders to compile the history of the Yuan, under the direction of \u5b8b\u6fc2 Sung Lien and \u738b\u7995 Wang Wei. The work, which occupied sixteen scholars, was begun in the 2nd month of 1369, and finished in the 8th month of the same year. But as at that time, the record of the reign of Shun-ti (the last Mongol emperor in China) was not yet received, the scholar \u6b50\u967d\u4f51 Ou-yang Yu and others, were sent to \u5317\u5e73 Pei-p'ing to obtain the required\nIn the 6th month of 1270 the Yuan history was complete.\n\nA new edition of the Yuan shi was published during the reign of Kia-tsing (1522\u20141567). The edition to which my frequent quotations from the Yuan shi in these pages always refer, bears the date of 1603. There were several other editions of the work issued during the Ming. My friend Mr. Arendt, of the German Legation, possesses a curious copy of the \"Yuan History,\" which has been printed from blocks of different editions, some pages showing the date of 1609, others 1623 and 1630. One part has no date, but judging from the print, the blocks must have belonged to an early period of the Ming.\n\nAs far as I know, three editions of the Yuan shi have been published during the present dynasty; one in 1659, another about the middle of the last century, and the third in the present century. I may venture a few remarks with respect to the second one, which is an unhappy revision of the former editions.\n\n2. A learned committee, consisting of Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, western Mohammedans, etc. was appointed by the emperor K'ien-lung to revise the Yuan shi, and especially the foreign names of men, places etc. occurring so frequently in that book. These savants in their reformatory zeal, proceeded on the idea, that all the proper names had been incorrectly rendered in the official documents of the Mongols, and had to be changed. They pronounced the same verdict with respect to the histories of the Liao and the Kin. Thus in the new editions of the histories of the Liao, Kin and Yuan, all the original proper names without exception disappeared, and were replaced by names of a new invention, which generally have little resemblance to the original. For further particulars, compare my Notes on Chinese Medieval Travellers, p. 58, note 1. By this way of corrupting the names of the original histories, which have generally rendered foreign sounds as correctly as the Chinese language permits, the K'ien-lung editions of these works have become completely unserviceable for historical and geographical investigations. K'ien-lung was very proud of the happy idea of metamorphosing the ancient proper names, and issued an edict, that in future no Chinese scholar should dare to use the ancient names.\n\nAfter the three histories had been corrupted, K'ien-lung ordered the same committee to explain the meanings of the new names; and this gave rise to a new work entitled: \u907c\u91d1\u5143\u53f2\u8a9e\u89e3\n\n---\n\n1 Pei-p'ing was the name of the present Peking, in the beginning of the Ming. It seems the committee entrusted with the compilation of the Yuan shi was in session at Nanking, which at that time was the capital of the Ming.\nLiao kin yu\u00e1n shi y\u00ec kai, or \"Explanation of words (proper names) found in the histories of the Liao, Kin and Y\u00fcan.\" In this vocabulary, all the names of men, countries, places, mountains, rivers etc.\u2014of the three histories have been systematically arranged, but according to the new spelling. The original spelling of the name however is always given, and the chapters are indicated where the name occurs. This renders the vocabulary very useful for reference, and we may lay aside the fact, that the principal object in view of the learned committee, was the absurd explanation of the meaning of the newly-invented names. I may give a few examples of the sagacity these savants displayed in their etymological commentaries. The city of Derbend (the name means \"gate\" in Persian), situated on the western shore of the Caspian sea, is mentioned in the Yuan shi, as a city of Persia, and the name is written \u6253\u8033\u73ed Da-r-ban. The committee changed the name into \u90fd\u723e\u672c Du-r-ben, and explain that durben in Mongol means, \"four.\" The name of Bardaa, a city of Armenia, is rendered in the original Yuan shi by \u5df4\u8033\u6253\u963f Ba-r-da-a. The committee will have the name to be \u5df4\u52d2\u5854\u54c8 Ba-le-t'a-ha, and comment that this name in Manchu means \"the neck part of a sable skin.\" By \u522b\u5931\u516b\u91cc Bie-shi-ba-li in the uncorrupted Yuan shi, Bishbalik is to be understood. The meaning of this name in Turkish, is \"Five cities,\" and the term \u4e94\u57ce Wu-ch'eng, meaning also \"Five cities,\" occurs repeatedly in the Yuan shi, as a synonym of Bie-shi-ba-li. The committee however transformed the name into \u5df4\u5be6\u4f2f\u91cc Ba-shi-bo-li, and state that Ba-shi in the language of the Mohammedans means \"head\" and bo-li \"kidneys.\"\n\nThe most recent edition of the Yuan shi (also with corrupted proper names) is dated 1824, but Archimandrite Palladius has noticed that it was only finished about twenty years later. This edition is not difficult of purchase, and I fancy it is the only edition of the Yuan shi found in European libraries. The numerous translations from the \"Mongol history,\" found in Pauthier's M. Polo, have all been made from this corrupted text. At the time Klapproth and R\u00e9musat wrote, the Yuan shi was unknown in Europe, and it seems, that even the old Catholic missionaries in Peking had not seen it. The old sinologues knew only an extract of the great \"Mongol History\" (see further on).\n\n3. The Yuan shi has been compiled from official documents. Perhaps we must except the biographies, for which the information was probably often derived from private sources. It seems, that the greater part of the documents on which the Chinese history of the Mongols is based, had been drawn up in the Chinese language; but in some cases they appear to have been translated from the\nMongol. I conclude it from the fact that in the Yuan shi, places are often mentioned, not as usually by their Chinese names, but by their Mongol names represented in Chinese characters. I may quote a few instances, and select such topics, as will at the same time serve to corroborate the statements of Marco Polo and Rashid-eddin, who, as is known, generally mention places and countries of eastern Asia, by their Mongol names.\n\nThe province of \u96f2\u5357 Y\u00fcnnan, in the south-western part of China proper, bears this name,\u2014as in our day,\u2014in the Annals of the Yuan shi; and in the geographical part of it, we find it mentioned as one of the twelve provinces of China. But Marco Polo and Rashid-eddin always term this province Carajan (Yule's M. Polo, vol. ii, p. 36; Cuthay &c. p. 269),\u2014probably a local name, adopted by the Mongols. Polo and Rashid both state, that the capital of this province is called Yachi, which latter place Klaproth tries to identify with \u5a01\u695a Wei-ch'u,\u2014Pauthier with \u9e97\u6c5f\u5e9c Li-kiang fu. Rashid states further (Yule's M. Polo, vol. ii, p. 43), that some of the inhabitants of Kar\u00e1-j\u00e1ng are white, and these are called Chaghan-j\u00e1ng by the Mongols. These names are not met with in the Chinese annals, nor in the description of Y\u00fcnnan in the Yuan shi (geographical part). In the latter account Kara-jang and Chagan-jang (Black and White Jang) are rendered by \u70cf\u883b Wu man and \u767d\u883b Po man (Black and White Barbarians). But in the biographies of Dja-o-a-k'o-p'an, A-r-sze-lan (Y\u00fcan shi, chap. cxiii) and others, these tribes are mentioned under the names of \u54c8\u524c\u7ae0 Ha-la djang and \u5bdf\u7f55\u7ae0 Ch'a-han djang, as the Mongols used to call them; and in the biography of Wu-liang-ho-t'ui (ibid, chap. cxii), the conqueror of Y\u00fcnnan, it is stated, that the capital of the Black Barbarians was called \u62d4\u8d64 Ya-ch'i. It is described there as a city surrounded by lakes on three sides.\n\nIn the Annals of the Yuan shi, the tribe of the Onguts,\u2014so called by Rashid (Polo styles them Ung, l. c. vol. i, p. 250),\u2014is mentioned under its Chinese name \u767d\u9054\u9054 Po Ta-ta (White Tatars), whilst in the biographies it is termed \u6c6a\u53e4 Wang-gu, sometimes \u96cd\u53e4 Yung-gu. There can be no doubt about the identity of the Po Ta-ta and Wang-gu. In the biography of \u963f\u524c\u5140\u601d\u5254\u5409\u5ffd\u91cc A-la-wu-sze T'i-gi Hu-li (Y\u00fcan shi, chap. cxviii), it is stated that he was the chief of the tribe Wang-gu. Chinghiz khan bestowed one of his daughters on A-la-wu-sze's son as wife. But in the Annals of the Yuan shi (sub anno, 1203) the same A-la-wu-sze\n\n---\n\n* Rashid-eddin (D'Ohsson's Hist. d. Mongols, tom. i, p. 84) calls this chief of the Onguts Alacush tikin kuri, stating that tikin kuri is a title.\nis mentioned as the chief of the Po Ta-ta, who surrendered to Chinghiz khan.\n\n\u897f\u590f Si Hia (western Hia) or \u6cb3\u897f Ho-si (west of the Yellow river), was the Chinese name for the Tangut empire. In the Annals of the Yuan shi it always appears under these names; but in the biographies, this kingdom and the people are generally termed by their Mongol name, i.e. \u5510\u5140 T'ang-wu. This name occurs very often; a number of valiant warriors in the Mongol army were of Tangut origin. M. Polo (vol. i, p. 184) speaks of the Great Province of Tangut.*\n\nThe name for the Yellow river in the Yuan shi, is generally \u6cb3 Ho (meaning simply \"the River\"). The Mongols called it (and call it even now) Kara muren, the \"Black River.\" In the narratives of M. Polo and other medieval travellers, and in Rashid's accounts, the river appears under the name of Cara muren. In one instance, this Mongol name is applied to the Yellow river also in the Yuan shi, and written there \u54c8\u523a\u6728\u9023 Ha-la mu-lien (see chap. c. Imperial pasture lands).\n\n4. The Yuan shi comprises 210 chapters, in 4 sections. The first section, \u672c\u7d00 Pen ki (47 chapters), contains the biographies of the thirteen Mongol emperors, and the historical records of their reigns, beginning with Chinghiz, and ending with Shun-ti who was overthrown by the Ming in 1368. The 1st chapter, treats first, of the history of the Mongols before Chinghiz, and then records the doings of the reign of the great conqueror. The 2nd chapter, comprises the reign of Ogotai, and the 3rd that of Mangu. Then next 14 chapters (iv\u2014xvii) are devoted to Kubilai khan. The remainder of the Pen ki continues the history of the Mongol empire in China to the fall of the dynasty.\n\n5. The second section \u7eaa\u4e8b Chi, \"Memoirs,\" chap. xviii\u2014cv, has two chapters (xlviii, xlix) on \"Astronomy,\" \u5929\u6587 T'ien wen, and two (l, li) on \"Elemental influences,\" \u4e94\u884c Wu hing.\n\n* The country of the Tanguts was known to the Mongols also under the name of Cashi or Coshi (D'Ohrsson, l. c. tom. i, p. 95). Rashid reports, that about the time Chinghiz conquered this country, a son was born to Ogotai (the third son of Chinghiz), and he received the name Cashi. At another place (quoted by Klaproth, Nouv. Journ. Asiat. tom. xi, p. 464) Rashid states, that the country of the Tanguts is called also Hoa-si, which means \"west of the great river\" in the language of the Katayans. It seems that Cashi also is intended for the Ho-si.\n\nHo is the name by which the Yellow river is designated in the most ancient Chinese topography, found in the chapter Yu kuang of the Shu king. The name \u9ec4\u6cb3 Huang ho (Yellow river) appears first in the Tai ping huan yu ki, a description of the Chinese empire, published at the end of the 10th century (see Wylie's Notes on Chin. Lit. p. 36).\nThere, remarkable atmospheric and other phenomena are recorded.\n\nChapter lii\u2014lvii are on \u5386 Li, \"Mathematical Chronology and the Calendar.\"\n\nChapters lvii\u2014lxiii comprise \u5730\u7406 Ti li, \"Geography of the empire,\" or rather, an enumeration of the provinces, departments, districts, etc. of China proper, a part of Mongolia, and even Manchuria and Corea, accompanied occasionally by some statistical and historical notes. After this, chapter lxiii contains also a dissertation on the sources of the Yellow river, \u6cb3\u6e90 Ho yuian, an enumeration of countries and places in central and western Asia, \u897f\u5317\u5730 Si pei ti (see Part VI of this paper), and an interesting account of the \u4e5e\u91cc\u5409\u601d K'i-li-qi-sze, or \"Kirghiz.\" The chapter concludes with an enumeration of the cities of \u5b89\u5357 An-nan (the Anin of M. Polo, vol. ii, p. 82, now Tong-king) and some neighbouring countries.\n\nChap. lxiv\u2014lxvi, \u6cb3\u6e20 Ho-ku, treat of the rivers and canals of China.\n\nChap. lxvii\u2014lxxi, \u79ae\u6a02 Li-yo, \"Rites and Music.\"\n\nChap. lxxii\u2014lxxvii, are on \u796d\u7940 Tsai-sze, \"Sacrifices.\"\n\nChap. lxxviii\u2014lxxx comprise \u8f3f\u670d Yu-fu, \"Regulations on chariots and official dress.\"\n\nChap. lxxx\u2014lxxxiv, \u9078\u8209 Suan-ku, \"Regulations on appointments to office.\"\n\nChap. lxxxv\u2014xcii, \u653f\u5b98 Po-kuan, \"Government offices.\"\n\nChap. xciii\u2014xcvii, \u98df\u8ca8 Shi-hua.

Another superintendent was established for the three ports of \u5efa\u5143 King-y\u00fcan (the present Ningpo), \u4e0a\u6d77 Shanghai and \u6f33\u6d66 Gan-p'u. These three ports depended on \u798f\u5efa Fu-kien. Further on, the ports of \u676d\u5dde Hang-chou and \u798f\u5dde Fu-chou are also mentioned in connection with foreign trade. \u6f33\u5dde Chang-chou is only once spoken of,\u2014and in connection with the salt trade. We meet further, the names of \u6e29\u5dde Wen-chou and \u5efa\u5dde Kuang-chou as sea-ports for foreign trade in the Mongol time. But Ts'uan-chou in this article on the sea trade seems to be considered the most important of the sea-ports, and it is repeatedly referred to. I have therefore little doubt that the port of Zaiton of the medieval travellers can only be identified with Ts'uan-chou;\u2014not with Chang-chou as has been suggested by some commentators of M. Polo. There are many other reasons found in Chinese works in favor of this view; but this subject lies beyond the field of my investigations. Gan-p'u of the Chinese authors is the sea-port Ganfu of M. Polo, (vol. ii, p. 149). Hang-chou as is known, is Polo's Kinsay.\nChap. c.\u2014\u99ac\u653f Ma-cheng, \"Administration of the imperial horse pastures;\" and\u2014\u5c6f\u7530 T'un-t'ien, \"Military colonies.\"\n\nChap. ci.\u2014\u4e00\u7ad9\u8d64 Djan-chi, \"Postal communication;\"\u5f13\u624b Kung-shou, \"Convoy;\"\u2014\u6025\u905e\u92ea\u5175 Ki-ti-p'u-ping, \"Foot-runners\" (compare M.

Even in modern Mongol a post-station is called djam. Thus the word is pronounced in southern Mongolia. In the north it sounds dzam. European medieval travellers call the Mongol post-stations Yam or Yamb, and the diarist of the embassy of Shah Rokh to the Chinese court (1420) uses the same name (Yam khaud) for the post-houses in China (Yule's M. Polo, vol. i, p. 388; Cathay, pp. ccii, 137). Pauthier suggests (M. Polo, p. 585), that this word may be intended for \"Yima qui signifie poste aux chevaux.\" But yi-ma in Chinese means a \"post-horse,\" not a station. There is no Chinese etymology in the word yam, which even at the present day is used by the Tatars of Kazan etc. to designate a \"post-station;\" and the Russian word yamschik, meaning \"a coachman carrying the post,\" has evidently been borrowed originally from the Tatars. There are in the Russian language a good many Tatar words. The Russian linguists generally derive the word yam from the Mongol dzam, supposing that it was pronounced yam in former times. But we have seen that the Yuan shi renders quite correctly the Mongol djam; and we may conclude that this was the Mongol term for post-station, even in the 13th and 14th centuries;\u2014all the more as the Mongol text of the Yuan chao pi shi (a work written in 1240, of which I shall speak further on) also uses djam-chi for postal communication. I may observe that the character \u7ad9 djan, by which the Mongol word for station has been rendered in the Yuan shi, means also station in Chinese; but the addition of the character \u8d64 ch'i (meaning \"red\"), which here represents only a sound, proves that djan-ch'i was intended to express a foreign word. Yam is probably of Turkish origin.\nChap. cxii\u2014cxiii, \u4e00\u5bb0\u76f8 Teui-siang, \"List of the Ministers of the Mongol empire.\" This list begins only with Kubilai khan's reign.\n\n7. The fourth section,\u2014\u5217\u50b3 Lie-chuan, chap. cxiv\u2014ccviii, is almost entirely devoted to biographies of men of eminence during the Mongol period. It comprises about a thousand biographies.\n\nIn chap. cxiv, we find the biographies of the principal Empresses, from the time of Chinghiz down to the last Mongol emperor in China.\n\nChap. cxv\u2014cxvii give the biographies of the most distinguished of the Mongol princes, viz.:\n\nChap. cxv,\u2014T'o-lei (son of Chingiz), Chen-kin (son of Kubilai), Gan-ma-la and Ta-la ma-ba-la (both sons of Chen-kin).\n\nChap. cxvi,\u2014biographies of the wives of the afore-mentioned princes.\n\nChap. cxvii,\u2014Bie-li-gu-dai, Chingiz' elder brother (Bilgutei of Rashid); Dju-ch'i (Chingiz' eldest son); T'u-la, a great-grandson of Chagatai (second son of Chingiz); Ya-hu-du, grandson of T'o-lei; K'uan-chi bu-hua and T'ie-mu-r bu-hua both grandsons of Kubilai.\n\nThe remainder of the biographies record the lives and doings of eminent statesmen, officers, generals, scholars, artists, priests, and even remarkable women, &c. (chap. cc, cci). The biographical section of the Yuan shi contains a great amount of information with respect to the ancient geography and history of Asia. It is not easy however to lay it under contribution, for the accounts, which are scattered over nearly a hundred chapters, are generally short and fragmentary, and have chiefly a value with respect to comparative investigations. The biographies found in the \"History of the Mongols\" bear evidence to the liberal views of the latter as to the acknowledgment of merit. They seem never to have been influenced by national considerations. Among the prominent men, whose biographies are included in the Yuan shi, we meet with representatives of most of the nations of Asia subdued by the Mongol arms, viz. Chinese, K'it'on, N\u00fcchi, Tanguts, Onguts, Uigurs, Kanglis, Alans, Kipchuks, Carluks, Merkits, Persians, and other Mohammedans, etc. Some of these foreigners held high offices at the court of the Mongol emperors; others distinguished themselves as valiant captains. The Mongols were conscious of the intellectual superiority of those more civilized nations. Kubilai, after having established his power in China, did not oblige the Chinese to learn Mongol. He was, on the contrary, a protector of Chinese literature, which was very flourishing in the days of the Mongols. Of course the greater part of the biographical section of the Yuan shi is devoted to persons of\nMongol origin; but we are not surprised at finding, that with a few exceptions, all the distinguished Mongols belonged to the army, or were governors (durugachi) in the provinces.\n\n8. The fourth section of the Yuan shi concludes with some accounts of various foreign nations and countries, east and south of China, and of some sea-ports of India (chap. ccviii\u2014ccx). As these countries are beyond the field of my researches, I will give only the names:\n\nChap. ccviii, \u9ad8\u9e97 Kao-li, \"Corea;\" \u803d\u7f85 Tan-lo, a country in the vicinity of Corea; \u65e5\u672c Ji-pen, \"Japan.\"\n\nChap. ccix, \u5b89\u5357 An-non, \"Annam, Tongking.\"\n\nChap. cxc, \u7dad\u7538 Mien, \u2014now \u7f05\u7538 Mien-tien, \"Burma;\" \u5360\u57ce Chen-ch'eng, \"Cochin-China;\" \u66b9 Sien, \u2014now \u66b9\u7f85 Sien-lo, \"Siam;\" \u5370\u5ea6 Diao-wa, \"Java;\" \u5370\u5ea6 Liu-k'iu islands; \u4e09\u5cc7 San-yu (near the Liu-k'iu islands); \u99ac\u516b\u5152 Ma-ba-r, the \"Maabar\" of M.

In 1828 Father Hyacinth translated the first three chapters of the Yuan shi into Russian, and published his translation in the History of the reign of the first four Khans of Chingiz khan's dynasty. His version is very correct; it is to be regretted however, that this accomplished sinologue translated from the corrupted text of the Yuan shi; it is therefore impossible to make use of his version without comparing it with the original Chinese text. A complete translation of the original text of the Yuan shi would be a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of the medi\u00e6val history and geography of Asia. It would throw much fresh light especially on the history of the Mongols, and be serviceable to explain many dubious questions in the narratives of European medi\u00e6val travellers.\n\n10. There is an abridged Chinese history of the Mongol dynasty extant, published in 1699, by \u6212\u5c71 Kiai-shan, under the name of \u5143\u53f2\u985e\u7de8 Yuan shi lei pien, in 42 chapters. It is known also under the name of \u7d93\u5b8f\u7c21\u9304 Su hung kien lu, i.e. \"Continuation of the Hung kien lu,\" the latter being a historical work embracing the annals of the Wu-tai period, A.D. 907\u2014960, the Sung, Liao, Hia and Kin. The Yuan shi lei pien, although only\nan extract from the Yuan shi, is a very valuable book for reference; for the learned author has added a great deal of interesting matter, drawn for the greater part from rare works of the Mongol period. The first 10 chapters comprise an extract from the Annals (Pen ki) of the Yuan shi, and have been translated by Father Gaubil, in his Histoire de Gentchiscan et de toute la dynastie des Mongous, 1739. A curious ancient map is found at the head of the Yuan shi lei pien. It bears the title of So mo tu, \"map of the desert,\" and comprises the Mongol desert and the adjacent countries. The map has the appearance of a reproduction of an ancient map, compiled in the days of the Mongols. There are some names of places marked, especially in the neighbourhood of Karakorum, which are not mentioned in the Yuan shi, or in other works; and it is very unlikely that the author of the Yuan shi lei pien compiled this map from the descriptions at his disposal.\n\n11. In the year 1866, Archimandrite Palladius made the learned world (in Russia) acquainted with a Chinese (or rather Mongol) historical work of considerable importance. In the 4th vol. of the Records of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission at Peking, he presented a Russian translation of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, or \"Secret history of the Mongol Dynasty.\" In the introduction to his translation, Palladius gives a minutely detailed history of the work, from which we learn, that it was originally written in Mongol, and had been finished in A.D. 1240, at the time of a great assembly on the river Kerulen. It treats of the early history of the Mongols, the reign of Chinghiz khan, and the beginning of the reign of Ogotai. In the early Ming time, a Chinese translation of it was made. The text translated by Palladius is included in a collection of reprints published in 1848, the same in which the Si yu ki is found, of which I have given a translation in my Notes on Chinese Medi\u00e6val Travellers (pp. 15\u201456). As stated in the preface to this text of the Chinese Yuan ch'ao pi shi, it had been copied from the original, in the Chinese imperial library. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi is mentioned in the Hung wu shi lu, or \"Detailed record of the reign of Hung-wu,\" under the year 1382. It is stated there, that it had been written\n\n* The name is written Yuan chao mi shi in the Russian translation; but as the reading mi of the character \u7f8e is only the popular pronunciation at Peking, I prefer to write pi, according to the Mandarin dialect, as Palladius does also in his Elucidations of M. Pulo.\n\n* It contains also the \u897f\u57df\u8a18 Si yu ki translated by Stan. Julien (M\u00e9moires sur les Contr\u00e9es Occidentales). The title of the collection reads \u8ffd\u5c0b\u66f8.\nin Mongol, in Uigur letters, and that a Chinese translation of it was made, to which the Mongol text was annexed,\u2014not in the original letters, but by rendering the Mongol sounds by Chinese characters. After Palladius had published his translation, made from the Chinese text in the afore-mentioned collection, he happened to obtain a MS. copy of the Ming edition of the work, accompanied by the Mongol text (in Chinese characters), for the use of which I have to thank the learned owner. It was found, that the text Palladius had translated, was only an extract of the original work, which comprises 15 chapters, but has no title. Although many archaisms and clerical errors occur in this text, the restoration of the Mongol original presents little difficulty for men acquainted with both Chinese and Mongol; the Mongol text (represented by Chinese characters) being accompanied by the Chinese translation. For all who have made the history of the Mongols their study, this rare document of ancient Mongol literature presents a high interest. It corroborates generally Rashid-eddin's records, and occasionally we find passages in it, which sound like a literal translation of the statements of the Persian historiographer. This proves that Rashid had had the same source of information as the unknown author of the Y\u00fcan ch'ao pi shi. As to the dates in the latter work, they are generally in accordance with the dates given by the Mohammedan authors; but in a few cases the Y\u00fcan ch'ao pi shi commits great chronological blunders and misplacements of events, as for instance with respect to the war in the west (see further on).\n\n12. In the Russian Oriental Record, vol. i, 1872, Palladius has published the translation of another ancient historical document, recording also the early history of the Mongols. The Chinese name of the book, of which Palladius possesses only a MS. copy (there is no proof of its having ever been printed), is Huang y\u00fcan sheng wu ts'in cheng lu, a record of Chinghiz khan's warlike doings. It seems to have been compiled from Mongol documents, in the first half of the 14th century; but the author is unknown. The Huang y\u00fcan sheng wu ts'in cheng lu is repeatedly quoted in the Y\u00fcan shi lei pien.\n\n13. I may also mention a history of the Mongols, compiled in the middle of the 17th century, by the Mongol prince Sanan Tsetsen. The title of this manuscript work is Sanan Tsetsen u Namtar. A German translation of it was published in 1829 by J. Schmidt, in St. Petersburg. There is also a Chinese translation of the work extant, known under the name of Meng y\u00fcan liu. It seems that this Mongol history is based principally on traditions, not on official documents; therefore it sometimes\ndiverges widely from the other more authentic records of Mongol history we know; and with respect to the dates it is quite untrustworthy. Professor Berezin in his translation of Rashid-eddin (see further on) says, that the non-existence of Sanan Tsetsen's history, would be no loss to historical science.\n\n14. Finally, in reviewing the Chinese and Mongol works treating of the history of the Mongols, I ought not to omit mentioning the \u8f2f\u8015\u9304 Chue keng lu, written in the middle of the 14th century, by the learned \u95bb\u5b97\u5100 T'ao Tsung-i. It comprises 30 chapters, and contains notes on different matters referring to the time of the Mongol dynasty. There is in it a considerable amount of information with respect to the customs institutions etc. of the Mongols; and we meet also interesting historical and geographical accounts bearing on that period. I have had an opportunity of giving extracts from the Chue keng lu, in my Notes on Chin. Med. Travellers, and in my Archaeological Researches on Peking.\n\n15. As the Chinese and Mongol sources of information, with respect to the Mongol nation, are very little known to European scholars, our historians who have written the history of the Mongols, have relied almost entirely upon the Mohammedan historians of the 13th and 14th centuries, whose conscientious records concerning the Mongol era are indeed, entitled to the greatest confidence. The Chinese and Mongol chroniclers never present so detailed, coherent, and intelligible accounts as do the able Persian historiographers on the same subject. But, as I have stated above, I assign to the authors of the far east, also, a great importance, and especially with respect to comparative historical researches.\n\nThe subsequent notices with respect to the Mohammedan authors, who wrote on the Mongols, are borrowed from D'Ohsou's Histoire des Mongols, where more detailed accounts on this subject will be found. I mention only the most important Persian works.\n\n16. The Tarikh Djihan Kush\u00eb, or \"History of the conqueror of the world,\" written by Ala\u00ef-eddin Atta mulk Djouveini, records the events of the last ten years of Chinghiz khan's reign. It first gives a detailed account of the conquest of Transoxiana and Persia, by the Mongols. After this, the reigns of Ogotai and Cuyuc, and the beginning of the reign of Mangu are treated of, up to the year 1257, where Ala\u00ef-eddin's chronicle concludes. We find also in this history, interesting accounts of the Uigurs and the Kara-khitai, of which I shall give a translation further on.\n\nAla\u00ef-eddin's work has been continued by Abd-ullah, son of\nFazel-ullah, more generally known under his honorific title Vas-\nsuf ul Huzret, or the \"Panegyrist of his Majesty.\" It bears the\ntitle of Kitab tedjziyet ul emssar ve tezuljiyet ul d'esar, \"Division\nof the countries and transition of the centuries,\" and contains the\nhistory of the Mongols from 1257 up to 1327.\n\n17. Among the Persian authors who wrote on the Mongols,\nand the great political events which shook the different states\nof Asia in the 13th century, the first rank is incontestably due\nto the celebrated historiographer Rashid-eddin, who in his re-\nmarkable work Djam\u0131 ut Tevarikh or \"Collection of Annals,\"\ngives the most complete and intelligible record of the history of\nthe Mongols. Besides this, we find in his book very valuable\nand detailed accounts of the nomadic Tartar and Turkish tribes,\nwho in the days of Chinghiz khan lived in Tartary. One chapter\nis devoted to a very interesting and quite exact description of\nChina proper at the close of the 13th century.\n\nRashid-eddin was born at Hamadan about A.D. 1247, and was a\nphysician by profession. Ghazan khan named him vizier of\nthe Persian empire, in 1298, having been retained in this office by\nGhazan's successor Oljaitu. But after the death of Oljaitu,\nRashid was executed, by order of Abu Said in 1318, which was\nalso the fate of many of the eminent statesmen in Persia. Rashid\nstates, in the preface to his work, written by order of Ghazan\nkhan and finished in 1312, that in compiling it he was consider-\nably aided by the great Noyen Pulad Chinkasank (a Mongol\nevidently), generalissimo and minister of the empire, \"who knows\nbetter than any man living, the origin and history of the Turkish\ntribes, and of the Mongols especially.\" Rashid mentions also\n\n---\n\n10 I may quote here a curious statement of a Persian author contempor-\nary with Rashid, which makes the celebrated historiographer of Chinese\nnationality. We read in Abdallah Beidavi's History of China (Latin transla-\ntion by A. M\u00fcller, Greiffenlag, 1689, pp. 5, 6):\u2014\"Tempore Hulagu-chan\nmagna manus Philosophorum & Astronomorum Chataicorum cum illo huc\nprofecti sunt. Ex his Fu-muen-gi erat, Vir Philosophus, Sing-sing cogno-\nmento dictus, h.e. Polyhistor.

Rezido'd\nDin, Vezirius ille supra laudatus, terris Hing-ping-zang oriundus, fidem\nfacit, regnum Magin quotannis nongentos Tumanos seu Myriades in rationes\nImperatoria conferre.\" These passages leave no doubt that Abdallah takes\nRashid to be a Chinese.\nimportant historical documents with respect to the history of the Mongols, preserved in the archives of Ghazan khan, and to which he had access. He speaks further, of the Mongol annals called Altan depter (golden book), kept in the treasure house of the khan, and committed to the charge of the senior of the begs (cf. Prof. Berezin's Russian translation of Rashid-eddin, vol. i, pp. viii, 183).\n\n18. The first attempt to translate Rashid's Djami ut Tevarikh was made by a German orientalist, Hammer Purgstall, who selected for this purpose, one of the most interesting chapters of the book, the account of China proper. But Klaproth found much fault with Hammer's version, especially in the defective decipherment of proper names, and published a new translation in correction of Hammer in 1833, in the Nouveau Journal Asiatique, tom. xi.\n\nAt about the same time a renowned French orientalist Quatrem\u00e8re began to publish in the Collection orientale, 1833, his Histoire des Mongols de la Perse, translated from the Djami ut Tevarikh; but only the fifth part of the history of the Mongol dynasty in Persia appeared.\n\nThe most complete translation of Rashid's history of the Mongol empire, we possess, is found in D'Ohsson's Histoire des Mongols (see further on). The author however does not always give a literal, coherent translation of the Persian historian, but rather works up Rashid's statements, together with those of other writers, into his elaborate History of the Chinghizkhanides.\n\nA complete Russian translation of Rashid's History of the Mongols, has been undertaken by a learned Russian orientalist, Professor T. N. Berezin in St. Petersburg. It is being published in the Journal of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society. The first volume, 322 pages (vol. v. of the Journal), comprising Rashid's accounts of the various nations and tribes of Turkish and Mongol origin, living in the eastern part of Asia, was issued in 1858; the second, containing the early history of the Mongols, up to the time of Chinghiz khan's accession to the throne, A.D. 1206, saw the light in 1868 (vol. xiii of the Journal of the Society), 239 pages Persian text, and 335 of translation and commentary. As the author informs us, four volumes more are to follow; and supposing he continues to publish a volume every ten years we may hope to see the work finished in A.D. 1908. It seems to me that none of the previous translations of Rashid-eddin can enter into competition with that of Mr. Berezin. Not only has he at his disposal several of the best manuscripts of Rashid's work; but he is also considerably aided in the understanding of the Persian author's records, by his acquaintance with eastern Asiatic languages.\nBerezin states in the preface, that Rashid's style is quite easy of understanding, and that the only difficulty the translator meets, is to get the correct reading and pronunciation of the foreign proper names, occurring so frequently in the Persian text, the diacritical points of the letters being often omitted in the manuscripts.\n\n19. In commenting upon geographical names of central and western Asia, mentioned in ancient Chinese and Mongol writings, I was often obliged to refer, for corroboration or elucidation, to the geographical accounts of those countries, as given by western Asiatic authors of the same period. Generally the information drawn from Persian works found in D'Ohsson's *Histoire des Mongols*, proved to be sufficient for my comparative investigations. In some cases only, I felt the want of special Arabic or Persian geographical works for reference, e.g. those of *Yakut* (1179\u20141249), *Abulfeda* (1273\u20141319), etc., and my *ultimum refugium* was then D'Herbelot's *Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale, ou Dictionnaire Universel, contenant tout ce qui fait conna\u00eetre les peuples de l'Orient, leur histoire, etc.*, etc. The first edition was published in Paris in 1697; the second in Maestricht in 1776. I always refer to this second edition in folio. This dictionary of the eminent orientalist, D'Herbelot, is still an indispensable book of reference with respect to Asiatic history and geography, for students in this department who have not access to the original sources, or who are not acquainted with Arabic and Persian. Klaproth calls D'Herbelot, \"le p\u00e8re de nos connaissances sur l'orient.\" The only reproach to which D'Herbelot is open, is that of merely giving translations from Mohammedan authors without venturing any critical remarks, or even taking exception to contradictions in the statements he brings forward. The second edition of the *Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale* has a very valuable appendix. *Suppl\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale par C. Visdelou et A. Galand*. About 200 pages of this supplement are from the pen of Visdelou, and contain a great amount of very valuable information, drawn from Chinese sources, with respect to the history and geography of eastern and central Asia. Claude Visdelou, born in 1656, in Bretagne, went as a missionary to China in 1685, and spent there twenty-two years. I feel no hesitation in asserting, that he was the most accomplished sinologue among the old Jesuit missionaries in China. All his translations shew a profound and critical knowledge of the Chinese language. With respect to China, Visdelou takes the same place, as Klaproth assigned to D'Herbelot with reference to western Asia, and well deserves to be termed the father of our knowledge of Chinese historical records, and especially the history of the nations of central and eastern Asia. In the first part of the Appendix to the *Bibl. Orient.* Visdelou\nexplains from Chinese sources, a number of proper names and terms, used by the Mohammedan authors with reference to China;\u2014for instance, Fugfur, Tencu, Sin, Loukin, Khankou, Namkink, Kha-thai, Khanbalig, Cara-Cathaian, Van, Ca, Bacouk, Dapikhen, Fenek, Giagh or Tchagh. (The latter seven terms refer to chronology and astronomy.) The second part is entitled Histoire de la Tartarie, pp. 18\u2014133, and gives the complete history of the nations and tribes of Mongolia and central Asia; all the information being drawn from the histories of the Chinese dynasties. We find there, the history of the Hiung-nu, the Wei, the Geou-gen, the Tou-kius (Turks), the Hui-ho (Uigurs), the Sie-yen-to, the Kie-kia-sze (Kirghiz) and many others. The next 43 pages are devoted to the histories of the K'it'un (Liao) and the Kin,\u2014translations from the Liao shi and Kin shi. On pp. 117\u2014119 we find an interesting dissertation on the invention of gunpowder by the Chinese, and the cannons they made use of in the middle ages. The accounts Visdelou gives of the Yuen or Mongol dynasty, occupy only one page; the Manchus are treated of in six pages. The third part, contains a dissertation on the term Khan. The fourth part, (30 pages) has further explanations of names of countries, places and nations of central and eastern Asia, occurring in the writings of the Mohammedans, viz. Cara-khotan, Khotan, Aigur, (Uigur), Botom, Turk, Ung, Cathay, Tatar, Mogol and others. Besides this, Visdelou gives a short account of the reigns of the first five Mongol emperors. The fifth part pp. 165\u2014190, is a learned treatise on the Nestorian tablet at Si-an fu.\n\n20. I ought not to omit from my record, an extensive work on the history of Asiatic nations, written last century, by a French orientalist of great repute. It cannot be denied, that Deguignes in his Histoire des Huns, published in Paris, 1756\u20141758, in five volumes, has contributed a great amount of new information, drawn from Mohammedan, Chinese and other sources; but the competent reader will admit, I think, that the vast material brought together has been badly worked up by the author; who in his conclusions and identifications draws too much on his imagination, and seldom deems it necessary to give any evidence for the correctness of his views. In many cases it is impossible to decide, who is responsible for any given account or opinion,\u2014whether it is Deguignes or the ancient writer he quotes. Thus his researches on Asiatic history have but little claim to be considered scientific investigations; and it may be said, that he has rather spread confusion than shed light. Unhappily Deguignes still remains an authority with respect to the ancient history of the nations of Turkish origin,\n\n---\n\nWith respect to the value of Deguignes' historical researches, compare also Klapproth's M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, pp. 391, 396.\nand all who make this department their study cannot avoid referring to his *Histoire des Huns*, of which even the title implies a great error; for he identifies the Huns with the \u9102\u5974 Hiung-nu, a people first mentioned in the Chinese annals in the 3rd century B.C. as living in Mongolia, and who for nearly four hundred years were very troublesome neighbours of the Chinese. In his identification (*l.c.*, tom. i, p. 215), Deguignes was of course only guided by similarity of sound; and Klaproth has already proved that his view is opposed to all that we know regarding the history of the Huns and the Hiung-nu. The same Deguignes has also broached the famous hypothesis, that the Chinese were an Egyptian colony.\n\n21. After Deguignes, a more able and clear-minded orientalist of the present century undertook to write a history of the Mongols. In 1834, the Baron C. D'Ohsson published his *Histoire des Mongols depuis Tchinguiz khan jusqu'\u00e0 Timour Bey ou Tamerlan*, in four volumes. A map, showing the political divisions of Asia in the 13th century is appended. In this elaborate work, which I shall quote frequently in the subsequent pages, the learned author has gathered all the documents bearing on the history of the Mongols, known at the time he wrote. D'Ohsson's information is drawn principally from the Mohammedan authors, of whose records he gives the most satisfactory translations. D'Ohsson was himself of oriental origin (Armenian), and therefore well versed in Persian, Arabic and Turkish. He was also well acquainted with many European languages. His *Histoire des Mongols* is written in an admirably attractive style. It seems to me, that D'Ohsson has exhausted the sources respecting the history of the Mongols, as far at least as information can be drawn from Mohammedan and other western Asiatic and European medi\u00e6val writers. It is only from the ancient records of the Chinese and Mongols that some new light on this subject can be expected.\n\n22. I shall have to quote also repeatedly, in my paper, the narratives of those well-known Christian travellers, who visited eastern Asia in the 13th century. As to Carpini (1246), and Rubruquis (1254), my references invariably are to the pages of the Latin edition in the *Recueil de Voyages et de M\u00e9moires publi\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie*, tom. iv, 1839. Of Haithon's narrative (1254), I shall give an English version at the end of my paper. With respect to Marco Polo and the other medi\u00e6val travellers (Odoric, Marignolli, etc.), I rely upon the magnificent works of Colonel Yule, viz. *The Book of Ser Marco Polo*, 1871,\u00b9\u00b2 and *Cathay and the way thither*, 1866.\n\n\u00b9\u00b2 I have heard, that Col. Yule has lately published a new edition of his *M. Polo*, but have not yet seen it.\nAmong the works to which reference will be made in these pages, I may finally mention Karamzin's History of Russia (in Russian), published in 1815\u20141829, in 12 volumes. This extensive work gives the original text of all the ancient Russian annals in Slavonian. In vols. iii and iv, the invasion of Russia by the Mongols is treated of, principally from Russian sources.\n\nPART II. NOTICE OF THE KARA-KHITAI OR \u897f\u8fbd SI LIAO.\n\n23. Kara-khitai is the name applied by the Mohammedan, and other western authors of the 13th century, to a people originating from eastern Asia, who in the beginning of the 11th century, after an audacious expedition westward, subjugated the territories of central Asia, and penetrated even to Transoxiana. For nearly a century the Kara-khitai maintained their power in Turkistan, until their empire was destroyed by Chinghiz khan, who after having subdued the Tartar tribes in Mongolia, and made several irruptions into China and the Tangut empire, directed his armies towards the west; and there it was next the turn of the Kara-khitai\u2014whose dominions then bordered upon the expanding empire of the conqueror\u2014to experience the invincibleness of his arms. The Kara-khitai in the 12th century had caused much trouble in the Mohammedan countries.\n\nIt is needless to say that the name of Kara-khitai was not invented in western Asia; it seems to be of Turkish or Mongol origin; for kara means \"black\" in both languages, and khitai is intended for K'itan, a people whose original seats were in southern Manchuria, and who in the 10th and 11th centuries were in possession of the northern part of China. Their dynasty in the Chinese annals is called Liao; and as the founder of the dynasty of the Kara-khitai was a prince of the Liao, the Kara-khitai are always called Si Liao or Western Liao by Chinese authors; the other name being unknown to them. The ancient Mongol records style this people Karukitat; which is the plural form of Karakita. The reason why in the middle ages the Western Liao of the Chinese were termed Black Kitan by other Asiatic nations is unknown. The etymology given in the Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale (p. 231,\u2014\"Cara Cathai ou Cathai noir, c'est la partie du Cathai qui est la plus couverte de forets\") is absurd.\n\nD'Ohsson has made accessible to the learned world, the\n\n---\n\n1st I have only once met with the name of Black K'itan in Chinese books. The Chinese medieval traveller Ch'ang Te (1259) mentions the \u9ed1\u5951\u4e39 Hei K'itan (Black Kitan) in Kirman (see my Notes on Chinese Mediev. Trav. p. 90).\naccounts found in the writings of the Mohammedan authors, with respect to the Kara-khitai. In the first volume of his history of the Mongols, pp. 441\u2014444, he gives translations from the *Tarikh Djihan Kushui* and the *Djami ut Tevarikh* regarding this people and their history. Chinese records on the same subject have been translated by Visdelou, and published in the *Suppl. \u00e0 la Bibl. Orient.* pp. 10 sqq. and in Du Mailla's *Histoire de la Chine,* tom. viii, pp. 408, 419. Visdelou translates from the \"History of the Liao,\" giving a very correct and literal version. He has however, occasionally omitted some particulars (*e.g.* proper names), considering them probably unimportant. Du Mailla translates from the Chinese Annals *Kang mu,* the compilers of which seem to have made use of information independent of the *Liao shi.*\n\nI shall present in the following, a new and complete translation of the article on the *Si Liao* found in the *Liao shi,* or \"History of the Liao,\" chap. xxx, at the end of the Annals, reign of T'ien-tso, A.D. 1101\u20141125, the last emperor of that dynasty. This translation will be followed by others on the same subject, not published hitherto, and drawn from the histories of the Kin and Yuan, the *Yuan chao pi shi* and other Chinese or Mongol medieval works.\n\n24. The *Liao shi* (l.c.) reads as follows:\u2014\n\nYe-l\u00fc Ta-shi was the founder of the dynasty called *Si Liao.* He was a descendant in the eighth generation of Tai-tsu (or Apoki, the first emperor of the Liao). The honorific title Chung-te (highly meritorious) had been bestowed upon him. He was well versed in the literature of the Liao, as well as that of the Chinese (\u6f22 Han); and besides this, he was a clever horseman and skilful archer. In 1115 he received the degree of *shi* (doctor) and was admitted a member of the han-lin (national academy); and as he was *lin-ya* in the academy, he was generally called Ta-shi lin-ya. Subsequently he was appointed civil and military Governor in the north-eastern provinces. In the year 1120 the emperor T'ien-tso, pressed hard by the Kin, had abandoned his throne and taken to roving about. Ye-l\u00fc Ta-shi then assembled the dignitaries of the empire, and placed on the throne Shun, a prince of the imperial family. But Shun fell\n\n---\n\nThere are some differences in these two records with respect to the same events; and for the dates, the *Kang mu* is generally one or two years in advance.\n\nYe-l\u00fc was the name of the reigning family of the K'itan or Liao. See my Notes on Chin. Mediev. Trav., p. 109.\n\nLin-ya seems to be a term of the K'itan language. Visdelou translates it by \"acad\u00e9micien.\"\nill and died, and then his wife Siao Te was intrusted with the regency and the defence of \u71d5 Yen (the present Peking, at that time the capital of the Liao). When the army of the Kin arrived at Yen (in 1220 according to the Annals of the Liao shi), Siao Te fled to the emperor Tien-tso, who grew very angry, ordering her to be put to death, and reprimanded Ta-shi for having raised to the throne the Prince Shun, whilst the legitimate emperor was still alive. Ta-shi then answered: 'Even at the time when the empire was still in full vigour, your Majesty had not been able once to repulse the enemy, but had fled far away, abandoning the people in their calamities; and had I then placed prince Shun on the throne, the reigning family would still have been descendants of our ancestor T'ai-tsu. Has it not been the more dignified course now thus to act, instead of imploring the enemy for mercy?' To this the emperor had nothing to reply. He entertained Ta-shi with a feast and pardoned him; but Ta-shi did not feel himself in safety, and after having killed Ki-sie and Po-li-kuo he declared himself sovereign. Then at the head of two hundred well-armed horsemen he departed by night (evidently from T'ien-te), and proceeded northward.\n\n25. \"After a march of three days they crossed the \u9ed1\u6c34 Hei shui. There Ta-shi met with Chuang-gur, the chief of the \u767d\u9054\u9054 Po Ta-ta, who offered him four hundred horses, twenty camels, and about a thousand sheep. Thence proceeding westward, he arrived at the city of \u53ef\u6566 K'o-tun. In\n\n---\n\n17 In the same Liao shi, beginning of chap. xxx, it is stated that Shun was buried on the hill \u9999\u5c71 Hiang shan, west of Yen. Hiang shan is even now the name of a hunting park in the mountains west of Peking, with ruins of ancient palace buildings.\n\n18 The emperor of the Liao was at that time in \u5929\u5fb7 T'ien-te, according to the annals of the Liao shi, sub anno 1120. T'ien-te,\u2014the Tenduc of M. Polo (vol. i, p. 249), was near the modern Ku-ku kho-ton in southern Mongolia, in the vicinity of the great northern bend of the Yellow river.\n\n19 Some details regarding the retreat of Ta-shi from Peking are given in the history of the Kin (see further on, note 30).\n\n20 Probably divinities at the court of the Liao emperor.\n\n21 Hei shui or \"Black river\" may be the same as the Khara gol or \"Black river\" of the Mongols, which is marked also on our maps of Mongolia. It discharges into a lake north of the great bend of the Yellow river.\n\n22 \u8ad6\u58c7 siang-wen. It seems to be a K'itan term.\n\n23 This is the Chinese name for the Ongul tribe. See above, note 3.\n\n24 The existence of a country or city of this name, seems to be corroborated in the Kin shi. In the geographical section (see \u897f\u4eac\u8def Si-king lu, the province comprising at that time, the northern part of the present Shansi and the south-western part of Mongolia), \u547c\u6566 Hu-tun is mentioned among the nine countries or rather tribes (in western Mongolia), governed by a siang-wen (\u8a73\u7a69\u4e5d\u8655). Compare also note 45, Ho-tung.\nPei-t'ing tu-hu-fu he rested for some time, and assembled the chiefs of the seven chou (cities) and the eighteen pu (tribes). The seven chou are enumerated as follows:\n\n1. Wei-wu (Uigurs,\u2014see further on).\n2. Ch'ung-te.\n3. Hui-fan.\n4. Sin. (There is perhaps a character wanting.)\n5. Ta-lin.\n6. Tze-ho.\n7. To.\n\nThe names of the eighteen tribes are also given:\n\n1. Ta-huang shi-wei.\n2. Ti-la.\n3. Wang-ki-la.\n4. Ch'a-ch'i-la.\n5. Ye-si.\n6. Pi-ku-te.\n7. Ni-la.\n8. Ta-la-ch'ui.\n9. Ta-mi-li.\n10. Mi-r-ki.\n11. Ho-chu.\n12. Wu-ku-li.\n13. Tsu-pu.\n14. Pu-su-wan.\n15. Tang-ku.\n16. Hu-mu-sze.\n17. Hi-ti.\n18. Kiu-r-pi.\n\n\"Ta-shi spoke to the assembled chiefs as follows:\u2014\u2018My ancestors had founded a vast empire and had to endure many trials; nine emperors having successively reigned over it for two hundred years. Now the Kin, who are subjects of our dynasty, massacre our people and destroy our cities. Our emperor\n\n---\n\n**Pei-t'ing was situated at about the place where now Urumtsi stands (see further on, the article on Bishbalik). To avoid long explanations I may translate tu-hu-fu by \u201cseat of a military governor.\u201d**\n\n**The Kang mu in recording the same, says:\u2014\u201c\u897f\u9119\u4e03\u5dde the seven chou at the western frontier.\u201d**\n\n**It seems that the tribes here mentioned, occupied the western part and even the east of Mongolia. Shi-wei (1) is a name applied since the 4th century of our era, to a considerable tribe, divided into many branches, and occupying the land near the lake Baikal. See \u201cHistory of the northern Wei\u201d and \u201cHistory of the T'ang,\u201d chap. cclixb. Ti-la (2) are perhaps the T'ie-le of the Tang history (chap. cclviiia) in which name the Teleguts of Rashid may be traced. The Wang-ki-la (3) are perhaps the Cuncrats; Ch'a-ch'i-la (4), the Djudjerats; and Mi-r-ki (10), the Merkits of Rashid. By Tang-ku (15) it seems the Tanguts are meant. The same name appears in the geographical section of the Kin history, Si-king lu (see note 24). There we find also a tribe Wu-ku-li (12) mentioned. We shall see further on, from the accounts of the Kin shi, that Ta-shi's influence extended over the whole of Mongolia.**\nT'ien-tso has been constrained to flee shamefully and abandon the empire, being continually in trouble. Now,\u2014relying on the justice of my cause,\u2014I have come to ask your assistance for the extermination of our common enemy, and the re-establishment of our empire. I am sure you will feel compassion for our distress. Can you see without remorse the destruction of the temples of our tutelary genii. No doubt you will help our emperor and father; nor will you look indifferently upon the misery of our people.' The assembled tribes then raised an army numbering more than ten thousand horsemen, and Ta-shi appointed officers and furnished the troops with arms.\n\n\"In the following year (it seems 1121 is meant), in the second month, on the day kia-wu, Ta-shi, after having sacrificed a black bull and a white horse to Heaven, to Earth, and to his ancestors, put his troops in order and set out for the west. But he had previously sent to the king of the \u540c \u9ce5 Hui-hu (Uigurs), by name \u7562 \u52d2 \u54e5 Pi-le-ko, a letter of the following tenor:\u2014'In times past my ancestor, the emperor Tai-tseu, who directed his army to the north, when passing through the city of \u535c \u53e4 \u982d Bu-gu-han,** sent an envoy to your ancestor Wu-mu-chu, in \u7518 \u5dde Kan-chou, with the following message:\u2014Do you still cherish the remembrance of your ancient country? I shall occupy it for you, if you wish to return.\u2014But your ancestor thanked the emperor, saying, that his people had left their ancient abodes for more than ten generations, that all were quite happy in their present country, and that there was no desire to return to their original patrimony. This proves that we have been for a long time on good terms with your people. It is now my intention to advance westward to the \u5927 \u98df Ta-shi,** and I ask permission to pass through your country. Do not entertain suspicion.' Pi-le-ko having received this letter, immediately went to meet Ta-shi; and on reaching his encampment, three days were spent in entertainment. When Ta-shi started again, the king presented him with six hundred horses, a hundred camels and three thousand sheep; and to prove his sincerity gave some of his sons and grandsons as hostages; and declaring himself a vassal of Ta-shi, accompanied the latter as far as the boundary of his realm.\n\n26. \"Thereupon Ta-shi, proceeding further to the west, vanquished all enemies he met on his road, maintaining peace with\n\n** Bu-gu-han means Boca khan, a famous khan of the Uigurs, who had his residence near the place where afterwards Caracorum was built. For further details see the article on the Uigurs, in Part VI.\n\n** By this name the Arabs were known to the Chinese. See my pamphlet On the knowledge possessed by the ancient Chinese of the Arabs, etc., pp. 6\u201416. London, Tr\u00fcbner 1871.\nthose who surrendered voluntarily. Thus the army advanced ten thousand li, overthrowing kingdoms and taking innumerable camels, horses, cattle, sheep and goods. The power of Ta-shi's arms increased from day to day, and also the valour of the soldiers. When he arrived at \u897f\u57df Sun-sze-kan, he met the united army of all the western kingdoms, numbering a hundred thousand men, and commanded by the \u5ffd\u5152\u73ca Hu-r-shan.\n\nThe two armies were fronting one another at a distance of 2 li apart; when Ta-shi addressed his troops in the following terms:\u2014'We see before us a numerous host, but it wants an able commander. When they are attacked in front, the rear will fail to come to the rescue (\u9996\u5c3e\u4e0d\u6551), and there can be no doubt our army will gain the victory.' After this he formed his troops in three divisions, ordering the princes \u856d\u5e79\u91cc\u523a Siao Wu-li-la, \u8036\u5f8b\u677e\u5c71 Ye-l\u00fc Sung-shan and others, at the head of two thousand five hundred men to attack the right flank of the enemy; whilst the princes \u856d\u523a\u963f\u4e0d Siao La-a-bu and \u8036\u5f8b\u6728\u859b Ye-l\u00fc Mu-sie received orders to lead two thousand five hundred men against the left flank; and Ta-shi himself with the main body of the army, assaulted the centre. These three divisions rushed at the same time upon the Hu-r-shan, whose army was completely defeated; and to an extent of ten li the ground was covered with dead bodies. Ta-shi with his army rested in S\u00fcn-sze-kan ninety days. The \u540c\u540c\u738b Hui-hui wang (king of the Mohammedans) came to offer his submission, and brought products of his country as tribute. After this, Ta-shi proceeded to the west as far as \u8d77\u5152\u6f2b Ki-r-man. There all his officers, civil and military (\u6587\u6b66\u767e\u5b98), assembled and proclaimed Ta-shi emperor (\u5e1d). This happened on the 5th day of the 2nd month of 1124 (according to the Kang mu, 1125). The emperor, who was then thirty-eight years old, assumed at the same time the title of \u845b\u5152\u7f55 Go-r-han (Gurkhan of the Moham. authors), and\n\n---\n\n**Samarcand**, repeatedly mentioned in my Notes on Chin. Medi\u00e6val Travellers.\n\n**Hu-r-shan** has some resemblance in sound with Khorazm Shah. Cutb-eddin Mohamed, 1097\u20141127, first took the title of Khorazm Shah for his dynasty. He was a vassal of the Seljucus, who at that time reigned in Transoxiana and Fergana. The Mohammedan authors however do not record a battle at Samarcand between the Kara-khitai and Khovarezm Shah or the Seljucus, but mention about fifteen years later a great defeat of the Seljuc sultan Sangiar by the gurkhan of Kara-khitai (see note 61).\n\nEvidently Kerman in southern Persia is not meant, as has been suggested by some commentators (Plath's Geschichte Ost Asiens, b. i, p. 100),\u2014but Kerman\u00e9, a place situated between Samarcand and Bokhara, and frequently mentioned by Mohammedan medi\u00e6val authors. The city of Kermin\u00e9 still exists.\nthe Chinese title \u5929\u4f51\u7687\u5e1d T'ien-yu huang-ti; the years of his reign being named \u5ef6\u6176 Yen-k'ing. Ta-shi bestowed also honorary titles upon his ancestors and his wife. After this he assembled the officers and spoke to them as follows:\u2014\u2018We have made together a journey of thirty thousand li; we have crossed deserts and suffered many hardships by night and by day. That you may share in my glory, I am about to grant honorary titles to your ancestors.\u2019 He then conferred posthumous titles upon the ancestors of the prince Siao Wa-li-la and on those of forty-nine other distinguished officers. In the year 1226 Ta-shi conducted his army back to the east. After a journey of twenty days on horseback they reached a fertile land, where a capital was founded, and named \u864e\u601d\u5e79\u5152\u6735 Hu-sze wa-r-do. The name of the reign was then changed to \u5ee3\u570b Kang-kuo.\n\n27. \u201cIn the same year Siao Wa-li-la was appointed commander-in-chief. (I omit the other appointments mentioned in the Chinese text.) An army of seventy thousand horsemen was raised for an expedition to the east. After having sacrificed a black bull and a white horse to Heaven, Ta-shi ordered a banner to be set up, around which he assembled his troops, haranguing them in the following terms:\u2014\u2018Our great Liao dynasty rose under difficult circumstances; and it was due to the merits of my ancestors, (the great work) was accomplished. But their successors were addicted to pleasure and debauchery, and neglected the government of their people; when riots broke out, and our empire was destroyed. Now I wish to conduct you back to the \u8499\u53e4 So-mo (Mongolian desert), and to re-establish our ancient splendour. This is no country for me and my people to dwell in.\u2019 Thereupon Ta-shi enjoined the commander-in-chief Siao Wa-li-la to move out, giving him the following instructions:\u2014\u2018March out now; take care to reward merit and punish those who do not perform their duties. Try to share conscientiously with your troops, fortune and misfortune (\u7518\u82e6); choose places rich in grass and water for encamping; before giving battle, take care duly to estimate the strength of the enemy. Be ever cautious not to draw down upon yourself a defeat.\u2019 Thereupon the army moved out, and made a march of more than ten thousand li, without meeting any success. They lost a great number of horses and cattle, and were constrained to return, the troops being exhausted. Ta-shi then said:\u2014\u2018Heaven is not propitious towards me.\u2019 He died in the\n\n** Visdelou explains the name of Hu-sze wa-r-do by \u201cle fort palais.\u201d Wa-r-do is evidently intended for ordo, \u201cresidence,\u201d hu-sze has some resemblance with ho-sun, meaning \u201cstrength\u201d in Manchu.

He was canonized as \u5fb7\u5b97 Te-tsung.\n\n28. \"When Ta-shi died, his son \u5937\u5217 Yi-lie was not of full age, and Ta-shi's widow, by name \u5854\u4e0d\u7159 T'a-bu-yen, called also \u611f\u5929\u7687\u540e Kan-t'ien huang-hou, was intrusted with the regency. The name of her reign was \u54b8\u6e05 Hien-tsing. Seven years later Yi-lie himself took charge of the government; and the name of his reign was \u7d39\u8208 Shao-hing, which lasted thirteen years (1142\u20141155). He ordered a census of the people over eighteen years old, when it was found that there were eighty-four thousand five hundred families in all. After death he was canonized as \u4ec1\u5b97 Jen-tsung. His son being still a minor, \u96d9\u901f\u5b8c P'u-su-wan, the younger sister of the late emperor, undertook the regency and reigned fourteen years (1155\u20141169). The name of her reign was \u5d07\u798f Ch'ung-fu, and her title was \u627f\u5929\u592a\u540e Ch'eng-t'ien t'ai-hou. She had married Siao To-lu-bu, the son of Siao Wa-li-la (the above-mentioned commander-in-chief), but held illicit intercourse with her husband's younger brother P'u-gu dji-sha-li. She conferred upon her husband the title of \u6771\u5e73\u738b Tsung-p'ing wang, but subsequently gave orders to kill him; Siao Wa-li-la however, surrounded the palace with troops, and the empress was killed, together with her lover, by arrow shots.\n\n\"\u76f4\u9b6f\u53e4 Dji-lu-gu, the second son of Jen-tsung was next proclaimed emperor. His reign was named \u5929\u79a7 T'ien-hi, which lasted thirty-four years (1169\u20141203). It happened in the autumn of 1203 when the emperor was on a hunting excursion, he was made prisoner by \u5c48\u51fa\u5f8b K'\u00fc-ch'\u00fc-l\u00fc prince of the \u4e43\u883b Nai-man, who had been lying in ambush with eight thousand men. K'\u00fc-ch'\u00fc-l\u00fc then took possession of Dji-lu-gu's throne, adopting the dress and customs of the Liao. But he left to the late emperor the title \u592a\u4e0a\u7687 T'ai-shang-huang, and to the empress the title \u7687\u592a\u540e Huang-t'ai-hou. As long as they were alive, K'\u00fc-ch'\u00fc-l\u00fc visited them twice a day. Some time after, Dji-lu-gu died and with him the Liao dynasty became extinct.\"\n\n---\n\n* If we date his reign from 1124,\u2014the year he was proclaimed Emperor,\u2014then he only reigned eleven years.\n\n** K'\u00fc-ch'\u00fc-l\u00fc is the Guchluk of Rashid. He was the son of T'ai-yang, khan of the Naimans, overthrown by Chinghiz. In the Yuan shi Guchluk is termed K'\u00fc-ch'\u00fc-l\u00fc han. The Kang mu places the date of Guchluk's taking possession of the throne of the Si Liao at 1201, in the 8th month; but the Yuan shi states, that he fled to the K'itan only in 1208, which latter date is in accordance with the statements of the Mohammedan authors.\n29. Besides the above Chinese record, regarding the Si Liao or Kara-khitai, many other fragments on the same subject may be found in Chinese literature, especially of the Kin and Mongol periods. I may quote some of them in order to complete my accounts from Chinese sources.\n\nThe Si Liao and Ta-shi's exploits are spoken of with some detail in the Pei shi ki, or \"Account of Western Countries by an Envoy of the Kin emperor, sent to Tchinguz khan in A.D. 1220.\" See my translation of this narrative in Notes on Chinese Medieval Travellers, pp. 100 sqq. Some particulars, which the Kin envoy gives, with respect to the peregrinations of Ta-shi, point to the fact, that his way from Mongolia to Transoxiana led through the Talki defile, north of the present Kuldja (l.c., p. 103). The diarist of Chang-ch'un's travels to the west, as well as the traveller Ch'ang Te, and Ye-liu Ch'u-ts'ai in his narrative, all, when passing through Turkistan mention the traces of the K'itan empire (l.c., pp. 35, 74, 114).\n\nInteresting notices throwing some new light on the Kara-khitai are found in the \"History of the Kin,\" in one of the biographies, which I shall translate presently. The Kin, after having destroyed the empire of the Liao or K'itan in eastern Asia (1125), and established their dynasty in northern China, extending their power also over a great part of Mongolia, being apparently very uneasy about the foundation of a powerful Liao empire in Turki stan, did not let an opportunity slip of gathering information regarding it; and even sent envoys to them. The following account is translated from the biography of Nien-ko Han-nu, in the Kin shi, chap. cxxi, where some particulars of the intercourse between the Kin and the Kara-khitai in the 12th century are recorded:\n\n30. \"Nien-ko Han-nu was a meritorious officer in the army of the Kin (in the first half of the 12th century). The emperor had granted him as a mark of distinction, a harness, a bow and arrows and a war horse.\" (After these statements, the biographer interpolates a long notice of the Si Liao, to whom Nien-ko Han-nu was subsequently sent as an envoy. This account is as follows:)\n\n\"At the time T'ai-tsu passed through \u5c45\u5eb8 Ku-yung Ye-liu Ta-shi, a prince of the Liao withdrew through the defile of \u53e4\u5317\u53e3 Ku-pei k'ou (the capture of Yen\u2014or Peking\u2014by\n\n---\n\n** The first Kin emperor, called also Aguta 1115\u20141128, who overthrew the Liao.\n\n** This is even at the present day the name of a defile and a fortress in it, north-west of Peking. The defile is more generally known to Europeans under the name of the Nan-kou pass.\n\n** The name of an important defile, north-east of Peking.\nthe Kin, is recorded in the Liao shi under the year 1120); but he appeared again, took Feng-sheng chou, and entrenched his troops 25 li east of Long-men. This intrenchment was taken by Lou-shi (a general of the Kin), and Ta-shi with his troops surrendered. Ts'ung wang (also a general of the Kin) captured the heavy baggage of the Liao emperor (the text has \u8ffd\u4e3b), near the place called Ts'ing-chung, and on this occasion Ta-shi served as guide. The (Kin) emperor pardoned all the princes and soldiers of the Liao who had been made prisoners, and ordered a communication to be made to Ta-shi, that, notwithstanding his having been taken in arms, the emperor acknowledged his merits; especially on account of the service he rendered in guiding the (Kin) troops. This happened in 1121; but subsequently Ta-shi fled, and it was unknown in what direction.\n\n\"In the year 1124 a report was received from the chief of some tribes (in Mongolia) who had surrendered to the Kin, stating that Ta-shi had been proclaimed king (\u738b) in the \u5317\u65b9 Pei-fang (northern regions),\u2014that his realm consisted of two provinces, a northern and a southern,\u2014that he possessed ten thousand cavalry horses, numerous herds and great riches in products. The emperor gave orders to continue the pursuit of the Liao prince, and not to neglect at the same time to procure authentic information about Ta-shi.\n\n\"In the next year, 1125, one of the governors at the frontier reported a rumour, that the Hia (Tangut empire) was in\n\n---\n\nNow Pao-an chou (north-west of Peking). I may observe here that my identifications of ancient names of places in China proper, Mongolia and Manchuria, are based upon the geographical dictionary \u5386\u4ee3\u5730\u7406\u5fd7, which is very useful for reference.\n\nA new edition with maps has been lately published. The identifications in this work are quite reliable, for the author has drawn his information from the geographical sections of the Chinese dynastic histories. Biot published in 1842, a dictionary of the ancient and modern names of places in China (Dictionnaire des noms anciens et modernes des Villes et Arrondissements de premier, deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me ordre compris dans l'empire Chinois &c.), but his book is too incomplete for exact and detailed researches.\n\nThere are several defiles of this name (Dragon gate) in the mountains north and west of Peking.\n\nThis happened in 1121 according to the Annals of the Liao shi.\n\nWith respect to Ta-shi's relations with the Kin, the historians of the Liao and the Kin are in contradiction; or at least the Liao shi does not say that Ta-shi had been made prisoner by the Kin; but only states that he repaired to the Liao emperor after the fall of Peking. The Kang wu, which seems to have been made from special sources of information, records (Du Mailla, t. c.), that Ye-l\u00fc Ta-shi, after having been captured by the Kin, near the defile of K\u016b-yang, was released and sent by the Kin emperor to find the Liao emperor, who was wandering about in southern Mongolia.\ncollusion with Ta-shi, and plotting an invasion of the province of Shansi. The emperor again gave orders to inquire into this matter, and at the same time to arm for war.\n\n\"In 1129 a report came to hand from a general commanding in Tai-chou (in eastern Mongolia), in which he notified that Ta-shi had already succeeded in taking the two military encampments situated in the regions of the northern tribes. He expressed his apprehensions with respect to the security of the pasture lands (for the imperial horses), which were situated not far from the above-mentioned places. The emperor was at first afraid that the tribes in the north might revolt, if troops should be collected in those regions. However in 1130 Ye-li Yu-ta, and two other commanders were sent to pursue Ta-shi. They had been ordered also to raise troops from the tribes (in the north), but these tribes refused to obey. This expedition proceeded as far as the river Wu-na and then returned. Ye-li Yu-ta made a report to the staff (\u5143\u5e08\u5e9c), that Ta-shi was said to sojourn in the country of Ho-chou (\u548c\u5dde\u4e4b\u57ce), and to be in collusion with the Hia (Tanguts). Thereupon the emperor sent an envoy to the Hia, to demand an explanation; but they replied that they had heard nothing of Ta-shi, and that their country was not contiguous to Ho-chou.\n\n31. \"In the year 1144, envoys from the Hui-ho came to the capital of the Kin, to pay tribute; and they stated, that Ta-shi was not then alive, but that his people dwelt in their vicinity. Then Han-nu (in whose biography all\n\n---\n\n** A prince of the Liao, who had deserted and entered the army of the Kin.\n\n** Ho-chou is the same as Karakhodjo near Turfan. See further on, article Karakhodjo in Part VI.\n\n** The Kang mu in recording the expedition of Ye-li Yu-ta (Du Mailla, l. c.) states, that he started with ten thousand men to look for Ta-shi, who was said to approach Ho-chou. As the Kin did not put absolute trust in Ye-li Yu-ta, his family were retained as hostages. Yu-ta advanced as far as the city of Ho-tung north of the desert, more than three thousand li distant from Y\u00fcn-chung (the present Ta-tung fu in northern Shansi). But this expedition missed its aim, and only devastated the provinces of Yen (northern Chili), Pin-chung and Ho-tung, which had to furnish the troops with provisions. (See Kang mu, sub anno 1131.) The city of Ho-tung mentioned here is probably the K'o-tun in Ta-shi's itinerary, and the Hu-tun of the Kin shi (see note 24). The rumour spread about the approach of Ta-shi towards Ho-chou in 1130, as reported in the Kin shi and the Kang mu, seems to have been in connection with the great, but unsuccessful expedition sent by Ta-shi to the east about the same time (see above, 27,\u2014the translation from the Liao shi).\n\n** Mohammedans, or perhaps Uigurs are to be understood. Regarding the term Hui-ho, see 41.\nthese accounts are recorded) received orders to accompany the envoys of the Hui-ho to their country; and the honorary title \u6b66\u7fa9\u5c07\u8ecd Wu-yi tsiang-k\u00fcn (the brave and loyal general) was conferred upon him. He departed, and afterwards nothing more was heard of him. Under the reign of Ta-ting 1161\u20141190, a merchant of the Hui-ho, \u79fb\u7fd2\u89bd I-si-lan by name, arrived with three companions at the south-western frontier (of the Kin). These merchants gave the following statement:\u2014\u2018Our native country is called \u912d\u62ec Dsou-gua (the Chinese biographer adds,\u2014that is the name of a foreign tribe). The name of the capital is \u9aa8\u65af\u8a25\u9b6f\u6735 Gu-sze o-lu-do.\u2019 The people of this country are not of warlike character, but are engaged in agriculture, and every year pay one tenth of their produce to the government. Old men state, that in times past, when the K\u2019itan arrived, they (i.e. the people of Dsou-gua) surrendered without offering any resistance. The encampment (\u5c6f\u71df), in which the K\u2019itan live, is so large, that it takes half a day to ride round it. A short time ago the ruler of the K\u2019itan had sent A-ben-sze, his son-in-law, with ten thousand men to subdue the \u8449\u4e0d\u96e3 Ye-bu-lien and other tribes, but his expedition was not successful. The war however is not yet finished.\u2019 The emperor ordered these Hui-ho, who had brought this information, to be settled near \u57ce\u5e73\u5e9c Hien-p\u2019ingfu (now Tieling hien in southern Manchuria), where settlements of the Hui-ho had existed from olden times. In the same year Sa-li-ya chief of the \u7c98\u62d4\u6069 Nien-ba-en, and \u674e\u53e4 Bo-gu chief of the \u5ee3\u91cc K\u2019ang-li and other tribes, sent envoys and begged to be admitted as vassals of the Kin emperor. They offered the seal given to them by Ta-shi, and solicited a new seal from the Kin. The emperor gave orders to instruct the governor at the south-western frontier, to send officers to these countries, to inquire into the sincerity of these tribes; whereupon an envoy was dispatched, together with an interpreter. They saw Sa-li-ya, who maintained his sincerity; and from him they heard also of the fate of Han-nu. Sa-li-ya told them, that many years ago the Kin emperor had sent an envoy named Han-nu, by way of \u548c\u5dde Ho-chou (see note 44) to the dominions of Ta-shi. He had met Ta-shi, when he was on a hunting\n\n---\n\n*Evidently the same as Hu-sze wa-r-do.

Han-nu had replied that he was the envoy of the Kin emperor and that it was the place of Ta-shi to dismount, in order to listen to the imperial message; upon which Tashi had ordered Han-nu to be put to death. Such was the information the envoy brought back to China.\"\n\n32. Let us turn now to the records of Mohammedan historians regarding the Kara-khitai. (Compare D'Ohsen, l.c. tom. i, pp. 441\u2014443.) Rashid-eddin has gathered the following information with respect to this dynasty:\n\n\"After the sovereign of the Church\u00e9s had destroyed the empire of the Kara-khitai, a prince by name Nushi Taifu, standing in high esteem in his own country, fled, first to the country of the Kirghiz, then passed to the Uigurs, and finally arrived in Turkistan. Being a man of high intelligence and capacity, he succeeded in rallying a considerable force in these countries and conquered the whole of Turkistan; whereupon he took the title\n\n---\n\n* The Church\u00e9s of the Mohammedan writers, are the same as the N\u00fc-chi of the Chinese authors,\u2014a people of Manchu race, who came to power in the beginning of the 12th century, overthrew the empire of the Liao, and founded a dynasty in northern China, Mongolia, etc. under the name of the Kin (\"Golden\" dynasty). The Persian chroniclers heard the name Church\u00e9 probably from the Mongols; for this seems to have been the proper name of this nation. In the Ta kin kuo chi, or \"History of the Kin nation\" (see Wylie's Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 24), I find a statement, that the N\u00fc-chi or Kin were properly called Chu-li-chen. The name N\u00fc-chi, was also known to the Mohammedan authors. We read in Abdallah Beidawi's Historia Sinensis, p. 15:\u2014\"Conterminus est hisce alius ruricola populus. Quem Chataji Niu-che vocant. Mogolibus vero aliisque populis Hurge dictum. Ex his vir exit, cui Huonyen Agudai nomen erat; Dai-gim agnomen.\" Here Dai-gim is evidently intended for T'ai kin, the \"Great Kin.\" The name of the founder of the Kin dynasty is written \u963f\u9aa8\u6253 A-gu-da, in the Kin shi.\n\n[Huonyen is the N\u00fc-chi word for \"Prince,\"\u2014\u5b8c\u989c W\u00e4n-yen, in constant use through the Kin history.\u2014Ed. Com.]\n\n* Rashid terms the Liao dynasty in eastern Asia also Kara-khitai.\n\n* On page 168 (tom. i) D'Ohsen states, that Rashid terms the founder of the dynasty of the Kara-khitai Tushi Taifu. Thus Nu-shi must be a misprint or a clerical error in the Persian M8. Tashi seems to be the correct reading, for it is nearest to Tashi, which as we have seen was the name of the founder of the Si Liao dynasty, according to the Liao shi. D'Ohsen states (l.c.), evidently on the authority of some sinologue, that Taifu in Chinese means \"g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en chef.\" This view is not correct. \u592a\u592b T'ai-fu (lit. meaning \"great man\") now means a physician, but only in the popular language;\u2014it is rarely met with in books. But \u592a\u592b Ta-fu (meaning also \"great man\") is an old term, an honorary title, applied however, not to military, but only to civil officers.\nof gurkhan, meaning 'great khan.' These events took place in 1128 and 1129.\n\n\"After Nushi Taifu's death, his son, who was then only seven years old, was proclaimed gurkhan. He lived to the age of ninety-five and died about 1213. When Chinghiz was born, the gurkhan was thirty-four years old, and had already reigned twenty-five years.\"\n\n33. The author of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai gives more detailed accounts of the Kara-khitai. He records as follows:\u2014\"The khans of Kara-khitai derive their origin from Khitai. The founder of this empire had a great reputation among his own people; but had been constrained by political events to leave his native country. He assumed the title gurkhan, meaning 'universal khan.' It is reported that when he left Khitai he was accompanied by only sixty followers; but some assert, that he was at the head of a numerous army. These emigrants first reached the frontier of the Kirghiz, making incursions upon their territories; but after the latter had taken measures to repulse the aggressors, the Khitai withdrew to the country of Imil, where they founded a city, of which the ruins are still to be seen. The tribes of the Turcs submitted to the Khitan prince, who after a short time found himself at the head of forty thousand families. He conducted his army to Bela-sagun, a city which is now called Gu-balik by the Mongols. The sovereign of this country, who\n\n---\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n* **Footnote 33:** Four or five years earlier (1124) according to the Liao shi.\n\n* **Footnote 34:** According to the Chinese authors (Liao shi), Ta-shi was succeeded in turn by his son and grandson. The latter was on the throne thirteen years, 1169\u20141203. Thus Rashid has omitted one of the gurkhans; but he may be more correct than the Liao shi, in stating that the last gurkhan of the Kara-khitai died about 1213. The Liao shi puts this event earlier. As to the dates in the history of the Kara-khitai, the Yilan shi is in accordance with Rashid. See note 35.\n\n* **Footnote 35:** By two hundred, according to the Liao shi.\n\n* **Footnote 36:** Imil or Emil is even in our day the name of a river in Russian Turkistan. I shall speak more fully of this country in Part VI.\n\n* **Footnote 37:** It may be the proper place here, to say a few words on Bela-sagun and its position, as far as it can be ascertained from the fragmentary accounts of this place given by the Mohammedan, Mongol and Chinese authors. We shall see further on (see the article on the Uigurs), that according to the Tarikh Djihan Kushai, the city of Bela-sagun had been founded by a khan of the Uigurs (in the 10th century it seems), in a well-watered plain of Turkistan, with rich pastures. The Bibl. Orient, p. 891, art. Turcs, mentions Bela-sagun as the capital of Turkistan in the first half of the 11th century. We read in the same work, p. 690, art. Otrar (on the Yazartes), that this city was not very far from Bela-sagun; and p. 166, that Bela-sagun lies beyond the Sihon (or Yazartes), and less distant from it than Cashgar. De guignes states (Hist. des Huns, tom. iii. p. 252), that the khan of Turkistan, who had his residence at Bela-sagun and was dethroned by the Kara-khitai, was a Uigur prince, by name Illik-khan. The Mohammedan authors also\nwas descended from *Efrassiyab* (a mythical king of the Turks, spoken of in the ancient Persian chronicles), at that time had lost mention Bela-sagun as the capital of the Kara-khitai in the 12th century and the beginning of the 13th; and for this period we find many notices in Chinese and Mongol works, pointing to the position of this place. We have seen, that according to the *Liao shi*, the founder of the western Liao dynasty had established his residence twenty day's journey east of *Kerman\u00e9* (the latter place being situated between Samarcard and Bokhara). This residence is named there *Hu-sze wa-r-do*. We have further seen, in the report of some Mohammedans, who came to China from the country of the western Liao in the second half of the 12th century, that mention is made of a city *Gu-sze o-lu-do* in the vicinity of the encampment of the Kara-khitai. *Hu-sze wa-r-do* and *Gu-sze o-lu-do* are evidently the same name. *Ye-li Ch'u-t'sai* (1219; \u2014see my Notes on Chin. Mediev. Trav. p. 114) states, that *Hu-sze wo-lu-do* the capital of the Si Liao is situated west of the river *I-lie* (lili). In the *Yilan shi*, chap. cxx, biography of *Ho-sze-mai-li*, the same name is spelt *Gu-dse wa-r-do* (*Chin. Med. Trav.* p. 114, note 24). I have little doubt that these names, applied by the Chinese authors to the capital of the Kara-khitai, are identical with Bela-sagun. In the *Yilan ch'ao pi shi*, we find a more precise indication of the position of this place; for it is stated there (Palladius' translation, p. 72), that *Ung khan* had fled (close of the 12th century) to the gurkhan of the Kitan, who lived on the river *Chu*. This river, marked on our maps as *Chu* or *Choo* (on modern Chinese maps it is still styled *Ch'ui* takes its rise in the mountains west of lake Issikul, and is also connected with that lake. In *Ch'ang-ch'un*'s narrative (*Chin. Med. Trav.* p. 50), the *Ch'ui* river is also noticed. As the *Chu* or *Chui* river and its numerous tributaries now belong to Russian Turkistan, it may be expected, that some vestiges of the ancient capital of the Kara-khitai will be discovered by Russian archeologists. In the *Transactions of the Russian Geograph. Soc.* 1871, vol. ii, p. 365, it is stated, that the best pasture land in Turkistan, is found on the river *Chu*. This agrees well with the statement in the *Tarikh Djihan Kushai* (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 438) that Bela-sagun had been founded in a well-watered plain within rich pastures. I am inclined to suppose, that the name of *Bela-sagun*, or *Balasgun* as it is sometimes spelt, is a corruption of *balgasun*, which in Mongol means \"city.\" It is not unlikely, that this word was used also with the same meaning by the Turkish tribes. The author of the *Tarikh Djihan Kushai* states (*l. c.*), that the Mongols of his time designated Bela-sagun by the name of *Gu Balik*. It seems to me that this latter name presents some resemblance to the Chinese *Gu-sze wa-r-do*, for *balik* and *ordo* (\"city\" and \"residence\") have nearly the same meaning. It is worthy of note, that Mr. Spruner, who, I should think, had not access to the afore-mentioned Chinese and Mongol accounts of the capital of the Kara-khitai, has placed Bela-sagun on the river Chu. Compare his *Historical Maps of Asia*, No. 5. Klaproth was not aware of the position of Bela-sagun; at least he did not mark it on the maps accompanying his *Tabl. Hist. de l'Asie*. Col. Yule, on the map appended to his *Cathay etc.* puts Bela-sagun (with a ? however) between Bishbalik and Caracorum. It is not improbable that ancient Bela-sagun was situated at the same place, where according to the \"History of the T'ang\" (*T'ang shu*, chap. ccivb. sub fine) the khan of one branch of the western *T'u-kite* (Turks) had his residence, in the 8th century. It is stated there, that his residence was on the river *Sui-ye*. A century earlier, the Buddhist monk *Huan-tsang* proceeded from China to Samarcard, by a route south of the Celestial mountains, and along the southern border of the *Te'ing ch'i* (Limpid lake). The descrip-\nhis power, and had ceased to reign over the tribes of the Karluks and Kankalis, who even made incursions upon his territories. When the Kara-khitai approached his country, the sovereign sent envoys to their chief, and invited him to take possession of his realm. The Khitan prince then arrived at Bela-sagun, and the descendant of Efrassiyab abdicated, merely reserving the title Ilk Turkan, or 'Chief of the Turks.' After this the gurkhan of Kara-khitai appointed governors in all the provinces of his empire, from Kum-kidjik to Barser-djan and from Taras to Tamidj. Subsequently he\n\ntion he gives of the lake leaves no doubt that he passed by the lake Issikul). A hundred li north-west of it he arrived at \u7d20\u8449\u6c34\u57ce i.e. \"the city on the river Su-ye,\" where the merchants of different countries met. Huan-tsang's river Su-ye is the same as the Sui-ye of the T'ang history, and only the Ch'ui (or Chu) river can be meant. In the same T'ang shu., chap. cclviiib, article \u77f3 (Shash, Tashkand), we read that the city of Sui-ye was west of the lake \u96ea\u6d77 Jo-hai (hot lake) which does not freeze even in winter. I am not aware whether the Balkash or the Issikul is meant. In the same article it is stated, that the river Sui-ye has a length of a thousand li, and that the city of Sui-ye was destroyed A.D. 748, by a Chinese governor of \u5317\u5ead Pei-t'ing (the present Urumtsi).\n\n** Compare the report of the Mohammedan merchants found in the Kin shi (see above, 31), that Gu-sze o-lu-do had surrendered to Ta-shi without offering resistance.\n\n** With the exception of Taras, the places or countries here noticed are unknown to me. Kum means \"desert.\" With respect to Barser-djan I may mention, that Du Halde, in the map of China appended to his history of China, 1734, places \"Bersagian la Haute ou Sairam,\"\u2014I am not aware on what authority,\u2014on the river Talas. A city of Taras or Talas is often mentioned by the Mohammedan medieval writers, and also by the Chinese authors. Talas is still the name of a river in Russian Turkistan, and the city of the same name seems to have been situated on that river; at least this may be concluded from the narratives of the Chinese medieval travellers Ch'ang-ch'un, Ch'ang Te and Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-t'sai, all of whom went through Turkistan by the same route. The first, mentions the crossing of the river Talas; the others, speak of a city of this name which they passed through. (compare my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 34, 75, 114). Talas was situated on the great highway leading from Mongolia to Persia. Thus Haithon, king of Little Armenia, on his way home from Mongolia in 1255, also passed through Talas, and saw there the prince Hulagu, who was on his way to Persia (see Haithon's narrative at the end of this paper). Mr. Vivien de St. Martin, in his geographical commentary on Stan. Julien's translation of the Si yu ki (M\u00e9m. s. l. Contr\u00e9es Occident. tom. ii, pp. 267\u2014273) places the city of \u963b\u7f85\u79c1 Ta-lo-sze, mentioned in the itinerary of Huan-tsang, near the Yaxartes. Huan-tsang states, that proceeding from the river Su-ye (the Chu as we have seen) 400 li westward, one arrives at a well-watered country called \u5343\u6cc9 Ts'ien-t's'ian (the name means \"thousand springs\"), which on the south is bordered by snowy mountains, and on the three other sides by plains. About 150 li further to the west is the large city of Ta-lo-sze. M. Vivien de St. Martin at first identifies Ts'ien-t's'ian with a place, Ming bulak, found on our maps of Asia, south of the lake Karakul, into which the river Talas\nsubdued the Kankalis. His troops conquered Kashgar and Khotan; he sent also an expedition against the Kirghiz. Bishbalik was taken, and Fergana and Transoxiana submitted. Thus the\n\nempties itself. It seems Mr. Vivien has been guided in his views, only by the fact that Ming bulak also means \"thousand springs\" (in Mongol and other languages); but as I have been assured by a friend, who has travelled much in Russian Turkestan, Ming bulak is a quite frequent name for places there. It is the same with respect to Mongolia. It seems to me that Hian-tsang's \"Thousand springs\" bordered on the south by snowy mountains, must be rather looked for somewhere on the northern slope of the high mountain range, stretching from Lake Issikul westward, and marked on Russian maps as Alexander's chain. Many rivers and torrents, tributaries of the Chu, run down from these mountains, which are very rich in watercourses. The great highway from Kul'dja to Tashkand crosses all these rivers, and also the Talas at Au-lie-ata; and I have little doubt that Hian-tsang's way from the river Chu to Chash (Tashkand) followed the same direct route along the northern slope of Alexander's chain. But Vivien carries the traveller far north to Ming bulak, and then locates his Ta-lo-sze near the Yaxartes, a little east of Otrar (see Vivien's map). Thus he makes the traveller take a round-about way. Klapproth suggests (Neuv. Journ. Asiat. tom. xii, p. 288) also, that the city of Taras was situated on the Yaxartes, and ought not to be confounded with the city of Talas on the river of the same name. But as neither Vivien nor Klapproth have produced evidence for their views, that ancient Taras was situated on the Yaxartes, I maintain my supposition that Taras and Talas of the Mohammedan authors are the same, and that the Ta-lo-sze of the Chinese is also the same place. Rashid states (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 126) that Argun, the Mongol governor in Persia, on his way home to Mongolia (1248 or 1249) passed through Taras, where he heard of the death of Cuyuk khan. There is no necessity for assuming that Argun went from Persia to Mongolia by another way than the afore-mentioned Chinese medieval travellers and king Haithon, who all speak of a city Ta-lo-sze or Talas on their route. As the ancient Chinese itineraries agree in locating Ta-lo-sze on the direct road from Almalik (Kuldja) to Saiiram, the city was probably situated near the place, where on the Russian maps Au-lie-ata is marked. The most ancient mention of a place called Talas occurs, it seems, in the narrative of Zemarchus' embassy to the khan of the Turks, in the 6th century (Yule's Cathay, p. clxv). A century later, the name appears in Hian-tsang's narrative and also in the Chinese annals. In the T'ang shu, chap. cclviiiib, article Shi (Chash,\u2014Tashkand) we find Ta-lo-sze mentioned as a city situated west of the river Sui-ye (Chu,\u2014see above, note 57). The king of Shi is stated to have kept a garrison there. Compare also Deguignes, l. c., tom. ii, p. 500. The Mohammedan authors often associate Taras with Belazagun. It seems the distance between these cities was not great. Compare also Deguignes, tom. iii, pp. 219, 229. Rubruquis mentions a city and a kingdom of Talas, but he was not himself there. As he states (p. 280) he was told, when proceeding from the Volga to Cayalic, that the city of Tales, situated in the vicinity of mountains, was distant six day's journey from the route he followed. On page 279 he says:\u2014\"Quesivi etiam de Talas civitate in qua erant Teutonici servi Buri, etc.\" (on these Germans and Buri, see 81, and article P'u-la in Part VI.\n\nCompare the Chinese records above (82). The Kang-li offered the seal of the Kara-khitai to the Kin emperor.\n\nThe Bibl. Orientale, p. 741, states, that the Soldjuc sultan Sendjar (who reigned over Transoxiana, Fergana, etc.) conducted his host against the\npredecessors of Sultan Osman (of Samarcand) became the gurkhan's vassals. After having accomplished these conquests, he sent his general Ernuz against Khorasm, who carried fire and slaughter through this country. Atsiz Khorasm shah offered his submission and paid a large tribute; when Ernuz withdrew. Some time after, the gurkhan died, and his widow Keuyunk occupied the throne. She was subsequently convicted of an illicit intercourse, and killed together with her lover. One of the two brothers of the deceased was then placed on the throne. The sultan Tacash, successor of Atsiz, continued to pay tribute to the gurkhan of Kara-khitai, and was on good terms with him. He also recommended his son and successor to follow the same policy in regard to the gurkhan, whose empire was a strong barrier to protect Khorasm from the dreaded people of the east.\"\n\n34. The Mohammedan authors do not record the names of the gurkhans of Kara-khitai, as the Liao shi does; but they give detailed accounts of the reign of the last khan of this dynasty, who was dethroned by the Naiman prince Guchluk. The following are the chief points of the Mohammedan records on this subject, translated by D'Ohsson, l. c., tom. i, pp. 105\u2014166:\n\n\"Guchluk,\u2014after his father T'ai-yang, khan of the Naimans had been slain, and the power of the Naimans had been broken by Chinghiz khan,\u2014made a league with Tuota, khan of the Merkits, A.D. 1208. Chinghiz army attacked Guchluk and Tuota,\u2014who had rallied their active force on the river Irtysh,\u2014and defeated them near the river Djem.\" Tucta was slain, but Guchluk escaped and fled, at first to Bishbalik, then to Kudja, and finally arrived, in 1208, in the dominions of the gurkhan of Kara-khitai, where he found shelter, and was well received.\n\nGurgiasb (probably Gurkhan is the correct reading) of the Karakatai (in 1141 according to Deguignes); but he was defeated and the Karakatai captured his harem. Sandjar fled to Termed.\n\nEvidently Pu-su-wan, the younger sister of the successor of Ta-shi (see the Chinese accounts above, 28) is meant. She was in fact killed together with her lover.\n\nA grandson of Ta-shi according to the Chinese authors.\n\nThe Annals of the Yuan shi, sub anno 1208, report the same, without mentioning the river where the battle took place. But in the biography of Ba-r-dju a-r-le te-gin, king of the Uigurs (Yuan shi, chap. cxxii, where the war with Guchluk and Tuota is also recorded), the river in question is styled Ch'en. In the biography of Su-bu-tai (ibid. chap. cxx), it reads Shen. In the Ts'in ch'eng lu, it is Ts'an. Probably one of the affluents of the upper Irtysh, in the Mongol period had a similar name.\n\nAs I shall prove further on, ancient Bishbalik, the capital of the Uigurs was located near the site of the present Urumtsi. D'Ohsson identifies Kudja with Kucha, a place south of the Celestial mountains, west of Kharasha. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi (Palladius' translation, p. 110) states that Guchuluk, after\nat the court. The gurkhan even gave him his daughter in marriage; but some time after, Gucluk formed a plot to dethrone his benefactor. Having obtained the permission of the gurkhan, to receive in his empire the remnants of the Naiman tribes, who were scattered over the countries of Bishbalik, Imil, and Cayalic, Gucluk collected a considerable force, consisting of Naimans and Merkits, and entered into league with Mohammed, sultan of Khovaresm, and Osman prince of Samarcand, both vassals of the gurkhan. Mohammed and Osman attacked the Kara-khitai; and Gucluk tried at the same time to take the capital, Bela-sagun; but his troops were defeated by the Kara-khitai near the river Chinbulje, and Gucluk was obliged to retreat. At the same time the troops of Mohammed and Osman entered the dominions of the gurkhan, and gained a victory over him beyond the city of Taras; when Gucluk taking advantage of this event, succeeded in dethroning his father-in-law. This happened in 1211 or 1212, two years after which, the old gurkhan died. He was however treated with great respect by Gucluk to the end of his days. After having strengthened his authority on the throne of Kara-khitai, Gucluk marched against Ozur prince of Almalik and ordered his execution. The people of Kashgar and Khotan, who had withdrawn allegiance from the usurper, were reduced to obedience by Gucluk's troops, who during several years devastated these countries. Gucluk was a cruel persecutor of Islam. He was himself a Nestorian Christian, as most of the Naimans were; but after his marriage with the daughter of the gurkhan of Kara-khitai, he became Buddhist.\"\n\nDESTRUCTION OF THE EMPIRE OF THE Kara-khitai BY THE MONGOLS IN 1218.\n\n35. With respect to the events above spoken of, the Mohammedan authors give the following short account (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 172):\n\n\"When Chinghiz prepared his expedition to the Mohammedan countries in western Asia, he dispatched a body of twenty thousand men under the command of the Noyen Cheb\u00e9, in 1218,\n\nhaving lost the battle (on the Dicm river) fled through the countries of the Wei-ru (Uigurs) and the Khariu (Karluk) to the river Ch'ui, where he made a league with the gurkhan of the Khara kita. The date 1208, given by the Mohammedan authors for the arrival of Gucluk in Kara-khitai, is in accordance with the Yuan shi.\n\nNoyen is a Mongol title. It occurs frequently in the Yuan shi, where the term is spelt \u90a3\u984f No-yen. Che-b\u00e9 was a famous general in Chinghiz khan's army. His name will be met with frequently in these pages.\nagainst Guchluk, who at that time was in Kashgar. When Cheb\u00e9 approached, Guchluk fled. The Mongol general proclaimed religious liberty, and the people massacred Guchluk's soldiers. After this the Mongols pursued Guchluk, and captured him in the mountains of Budakhshan. Cheb\u00e9 ordered him to be beheaded.\"\n\n36. The accounts of the Chinese and Mongol authors regarding the same events, although only fragmentary, corroborate the statements of the Persian historians, and even throw some new light on the subject.\n\nIn the biography of Ho-sze-mai-li (Ismael?),\u2014Y\u00fcan-shi, chap. cxx,\u2014it is stated, that \"he was a native of \u8c37\u5247\u5e79\u5152\u6735 Gu-dse wa-r-do (see note 57), and a confidant of the \u95bb\u5152\u7f55 kuo-r-han (garkhan) of the Si Liao (or Kara-khitai). He governed the two cities \u53ef\u6563 Ko-sun and \u516b\u601d\u54c8 Bu sze-ha, subject to Gu-dse wa-r-do. At the time of Chinghiz khan's expedition to the west, he surrendered, together with the chiefs of these cities, and then entered the avant-guard commanded by \u54f2\u5225 Dje-bie (Noyen Cheb\u00e9;\u2014see note 66). When the Nai-man were attacked, Ho-sze-mai-li killed their khan \u5c48\u51fa\u5f8b K\u016b-ch'\u00fc-t\u00fc (i.e. Guchluk), and Dje-bie ordered him to take the head of the victim, and carry it through the cities of his empire (i.e. the empire of Kara-khitai). After this, the cities of K'o-shi-hu-r (Kashgar), Ya-r-k'ien (Yarkand) and O-duan (Khotan) surrendered to the Mongols.\"\n\nThe Y\u00fcan ch'ao pi shi states (Palladius' translation, p. 131):\u2014\"Chinghiz ordered Djebie to attack Guch'uluk. Djebie pursued him to the country called Salikhkun, killed him and then returned.\"\n\nAccording to Rashid, who narrates some anecdotes in the life of this hero, he belonged to the Mongol tribe of the Yissuts (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 172). In the Y\u00fcan shi, where mention is repeatedly made of his exploits, the name is written \u54f2\u4f2f Dje-bo or \u54f2\u5225 Dje-bie. It is strange that his biography has been omitted from the Y\u00fcan shi, whilst those of all the other illustrious men of the Mongol period are found there. See further on, 61, on Cheb\u00e9's death.\n\n* When commenting upon Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-ts'ai's travels (Notes on Med. Trav. p. 114), I translated a part of this notice, suggesting that the city of K'o-sun mentioned in it, may be identical with the city of the same name marked on the ancient Chinese map, appended to this paper; north-east of Marghi-nan. But now I see the possibility of another identification, which at the same time would corroborate M. Polo's account of Badakhshan. The great traveller mentions in this country, or about it, the province and town called Casem, subject to a count (vol i, p. 145); and at page 155, the province of Pashai (Ibn Batuta writes the same name Bushai). I am inclined to see in the cities K'o-sun and Bu-sze-ha of the Y\u00fcan shi, M. Polo's Casem and Pashai. It is true, it is nowhere stated that Badakhshan was subject to the Kara-khitai; but it is not impossible that it was so; especially as according to the Persian authors, Guchluk, when pursued by the Mongols fled to Badakhshan.\n\n** As the Mohammedan authors record, that Guchluk was captured and\nThe Yuan ch'ao pi shi records this event erroneously under the year 1206; but the Ts'in ch'eng lu agrees with Rashid, in placing the destruction of the empire of the Kara-khitai under the year 1218. (Palladius' translation, p. 191). It is stated there, that Chinghiz sent the great general Dje-bie against K'\u00fc-chu-lu ho-han. He pursued him to the place Sa-li-huan, where K'\u00fc-chu-lu was defeated.\n\n37. Plano Carpini, who passed through the country of the Kara-khitai in 1246, gives in his narrative, p. 648, some details regarding the struggle between this people and the Mongols. We read there:\n\n\"Naimani etiam et Kara-Kitai, id est nigri Kitai, ex adverso plurimi in quandam vallem strictam inter duos montes, per quam nos eunt ad Imperatorem eorum transivimus.\"*\n\nIt may be concluded from Carpini's report, that the battle of which he speaks took place in western Turkistan. The Mohammedan authors do not mention this expedition.\n\nRubruquis, who saw the country of the Kara-khitai a few years later, states (pp. 259 sqq.), that the Caracatay or niger Catay inhabited in former times certain mountain pastures, which he passed through; and in certain plains among these mountains their Cuir chan dwelt, who was deposed by a Naiman chief (Guchluk). On p. 280, he mentions the country of the Caracatay again, with a great river in it (the Chu), and a valley with old intrenchments of earth.\n\n38. It is a fact worthy of notice, that some descendants of the people of Kara-khitai still exist, it seems, in Fergana. At least Mir I'zzet Ullam, who visited central Asia in 1812, mentions a city called Kara-khatai, between Marghinan and Kokand, inhabited by Kara-khatai people, who are Mohammedans (Klaproth, Magazin Asiatique, tom. ii, p. 45). This Kara-khatai is probably identical with Kitai, marked between Marghinan and Kokand on the map of Turkistan, Kokand etc. in Petermann's Mittheilungen, 1874, vi.\n\nPART III. CHINESE MEDIAEVAL NOTICES OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.\n\n39. It was under the emperor Wu-ti of the great Han dynasty executed in Badakhshan, we have to look for Salikhkun or Sa-li-huan in this country.\n\n* The Chinese traveller Ch'ang Te (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Travelers, p. 74) mentions a place, Yi-tu situated between two mountains in the country of the Kara-khitai. He passed Yi-tu four days before reaching Talas.\n(b. c. 140\u201486), that the Chinese first became acquainted with the countries west of the Bolor mountains. About b. c. 122 the adventurous Chinese general \u5f35\u8cfd Chang Kien returned,\u2014after having been absent for more than ten years,\u2014from the countries of the Yaxartes and Oxus. After he had opened up communication between China and the kingdoms of the far west, the intercourse of the Middle kingdom with western Asia by water or overland, was maintained with short interruptions during many centuries, by the several dynasties which successively reigned over the whole of China or a part of it. Thus the Chinese were acquainted with the nations who now profess Islam, long before Mohammed had made his appearance. The Parthians (dynasty of the Arsacides b. c. 242\u2014a. d. 228) were known to them under the name of \u5b89\u606f An-si. From the middle of the 5th century of our era, mention is made in the Chinese annals, of the country or people of \u6ce2\u65af Po-sze; and the notices given of it leave no doubt, that Persia is meant. Many embassies from Po-sze to China are recorded in Chinese history from the 5th to the 7th century, and in the \"History of the T'ang\" we find even some particulars on Yi-sze-sze (Yezdejerd III) the last king of the Sassanides, who was slain by the Arabs.\n\nThe Arabs are spoken of in the Chinese annals, soon after the rise of Islam. The great T'ang dynasty, 618\u2014907, was contemporary with the rise and prime of Arabian power. In the \"History of the T'ang,\" the Arabs are always styled \u5927\u98df Ta-shi. By these two characters the ancient Chinese represented doubtlessly a foreign name, probably Tazy. According to D'Ohs-son (l. c. tom. i, p. 217), this was the name by which the Arabs were known to the ancient Persians. The Arabian legends regarding Mohammed are recorded by the Chinese authors quite in accordance with Mohammedan tradition; and the accounts of the first conquests of the Arabs are also reported by them with tolerable correctness. The T'ang shu notices also several embassies of the califs to the Chinese court in the 7th and 8th centuries; namely of Han-mi mo-mo-ni (a Chinese corruption of Emir al mumemin, \"Prince of the Believers,\" a title which was assumed by Othman);\u2014A-bo-lo-ba (Abul Abbas);\u2014A-p'u ch'a-fo (Abu Djafar);\u2014A-lun (Harun al Rashid). It is known from Chinese sources, as well as from the accounts given by Arabian travellers to China, that in the 8th century there were great factories of Arabian merchants in Canton.\n\nThe intercourse between the Arabs and the Chinese continued still by land and sea during the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries. The \"History of the Sung,\" 960\u20141280, mentions twenty embassies of the Ta-shi or Arabs. The Sung did not reign over the whole of\nChina; for the northern provinces were subject at first to the Liao, and afterwards to the Kin. The Liao had also communications with the Arabs in the north. In the Liao shi, chap. ii, it is recorded, that the first emperor of the dynasty (A-pao-ki, 916\u2014927) received an embassy from the Tu-shi in 924, at the time he sojourned near the ancient capital of the Uigurs (where afterwards Karakorum was built).\n\nFor further details regarding the intercourse between the Arabs and China, see my pamphlet On the knowledge possessed by the ancient Chinese of the Arabs and Arabian colonies. London, Tr\u00fcbner, 1871.\n\n40. Archimandrite Palladius in his article on \"the Mohammedians in China\" (Records of the Eccles. Miss. in Peking, vol. iv, p. 438) states, that in Si-an fu, where the well-known Nestorian tablet of the time of the T'ang was dug up, another ancient monument has been discovered, referring to the introduction of Islam into China. This Mohammedian tablet is said to bear the date A.D. 742, and records that during the reign of the Sui emperor K'ai-huang (581\u2014600), Islamism first penetrated to China. Palladius gives no details about this tablet; but he has kindly informed me, that it is spoken of in several Chinese works on Mohammedianism. I find in the Ming yi t'ung chi, the great geography of the Ming empire, published in 1461, the following statement, referring evidently to that alleged inscription. In chap. xc, fol. 12, we read, under the head of Mo-de-na, the realm of the ancestor of the Mohammedians (\u9ed8\u5fb7\u90a3\u56de\u56de\u7956\u570b), that during the reign of K'ai-huang of the Sui dynasty, Sa-ha-bu Sa-a-di Gan-go-sze a man who had arrived from that country, first taught his doctrine in the Middle Kingdom (\u968b\u958b\u7687\u4e2d\u5176\u570b\u6492\u54c8\u516b\u6492\u963f\u7684\u5e79\u845b\u601d\u59cb\u50b3\u5176\u6559\u5165\u4e2d\u570b). But at the time assigned here to the introduction of Islamism into China, Mohammed was still an obscure merchant.\n\n[As to the Arabic names in the above-quoted Chinese statement, Sa-ha-bu represents evidently \"Saheb\" which according to the Bibl. Orient. p. 721, means:\u2014\"a companion, a master, a professor.\" Sa-a-di is probably \"Saad\" a favourite Arabic name of persons. I cannot say what words or names are intended by Gan go-sze.]\n\nPalladius quotes also from a biography of Mohammed, written by a Chinese Mohammedan, in which it is stated, that in A.D. 587, the emperor of China sent an embassy to Mohammed in Arabia, to invite him to China. The latter refused, but sent his portrait, which however subsequently disappeared from the canvas, in order that it might not become an object of worship.\n\nIn another Chinese Mohammedan work, the \u56de\u56de\u539f\u4f86 Hui\nhui yuan lai (Mr. Wylie, in his Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 145, calls it \"an apocryphal narrative of the introduction of Mohammedanism into China, bearing date 1754\"), it is recorded that in the year A.D. 628, the emperor of China sent an envoy with a letter to the king of the Mohammedans; and when this embassy returned, it was accompanied by a turbaned Mahommedan priest and three thousand followers. These are said to have formed the foundation of the Mahommedan colonies in China (Palladius, l.c.).\n\nThese tales are not corroborated by the chroniclers of the Sui and T'ang periods. There can, however, be no doubt, that at the time of the T'ang, many Mahommedans were settled in China.\n\n41. In early times, when the Chinese began to extend their power over the countries west of China proper, they denominated them by the general term \u897f\u57df Si-y\u00fc (western countries). It seems this name came first into use, when Chang Kien had returned from western Asia. In the \"History of the anterior Han\" (Han shu, chap. xcvi), where the countries of the Si-y\u00fc are first described, it is stated, that the Si-y\u00fc begins at the Chinese fortresses \u7389\u9580\u95dc Y\u00fc-men kuan and \u9633\u95dc Yang kuan (both were situated in the western part of the present Kansu, west of the \u5609\u5cea\u95dc Kia-y\u00fc kuan, one of the principal gates of the Great wall). The name Si-y\u00fc is still applied in a general sense to the same regions of central and western Asia, inhabited by Mahommedan people. Up to the 12th century, the Mahommedans are not designated by a general name in Chinese history. In the \"T'ang History,\" where they are first mentioned, they go under the name of Ta-shi, which term as we have seen was applied to the Arabs. \u56de\u56de Hui-hui is now the common Chinese name for all professors of Islamism. It seems this term occurs first in the Liao shi, at the beginning of the 12th century. In the article on the Si Liao above translated (26), it is recorded that the \u56de\u56de\u738b Hui-hui wang or \"king of the Mahommedans\" paid tribute to the chief of the Si Liao. The \"History of the Kin\" also once uses this name, stating, that in the 12th century there was a regiment of the Hui-hui in the army of the Kin, who were able to cast inflammable substances (see Archim. Palladius' above-quoted article on \"the Mahommedans in China,\" p. 439). In the Yuan shi, the term \u56de\u56de Hui-hui for Mahommedans is met with in only a few instances; they being generally styled there \u56de\u7ea5 Hui-ho or \u56de\u9e58 Hui-hu. These latter denominations have given rise to a great confusion in Chinese history; for at the time of the T'ang, and even in the 12th century, only the Uigurs were designated by these names (see further on, Part VI). Compare also (25) above, the article on the Si Liao, where it was stated that Ye-l\u00fc Ta-shi sent a letter to the\nking of the Hui-hu in Kan-chou. There Hui-hu can only mean Uigurs. The Yuan shi however, applies to the Uigurs a new name, which reads \u754f\u5140\u5152 Wei-wu-r, and the terms Hui-ho or Hui-hu, when met with in the Yuan shi have always to be translated by Mohammedans. I am not prepared to give a satisfactory explanation of the origin of this strange denomination of the professors of Islamism by the Chinese. (Compare on this subject my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 31, note 68).\n\nIn the Mongol text of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi (13th century), the Mohammedans are always termed Sartol. The Chinese translation of the same work, made in 1388, renders Sartol always by Hui-hu. The Sartol of the Mongols are evidently the same as the Sarti of Carpini, p. 710. Even now the people of Transoxiana are known in western Asia under the name of Sarti (Ritter's Asia, vol. v, p. 725). D'Ohsson is wrong in stating (l. c. tom. i, p. 216), that the Mongols called the Mohammedans Tadjiks. But Tadjik even at the present day means the same people as Sarti, according to Burnes (Trav. into Bokhara, vol. ii, p. 268).\n\nIn a few cases the Chinese writers of the Mongol period call the Musulmans by this very name. In the Yuan shi, chap. v, we read, that in 1262 an imperial decree was given, that young men belonging to the families of the \u6c92\u901f\u9b6f Man Mu-su-man, \u754f\u543e\u5152 Wei-wu-r (Uigurs), \u4e5f\u91cc\u53ef\u6eab Ye-li-k'o-wen (Christians), and \u9054\u5931\u883b Da-shi-man (Mollahs), are to be employed in military service.\n\nThe N\u00fcchi traveller Wu-ku-sun, 1220 (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 104), speaks of the \u6ca1\u901f\u9b6f\u56de\u7d07 Mu-su-lu-man Hui-ho in Persia.\n\nIn Ch'ang-ch'un's narrative (ibid. p. 33) we find a realm of the \u9806\u901f\u6eff Pu-su-man noticed, the ruler of which seems to have had his residence at Almalik. Pu-su-man is evidently the same as the Bussurman in the ancient Russian annals, by which name the Mohammedans are always to be understood (Karamzin, vol. iv, p. 304). Carpini, Rubruquis and M. Polo generally term the Mohammedans\u2014Suracens; but in Carpini's narrative we find also the Besermans.\n\nCarpini states, pp. 749, 750:\u2014\"De terra Cangitarum (Kankalis, see further on, 64) intravimus terram Biserminorum. Isti homines linguam Comanicam (Kiptchak;\u2014see Part VI) loquebantur, et adhuc loquuntur; sed legem Sarracenorum tennent, etc.\"\n\nBenoit, Carpini's travelling companion, identifies the country of the Beserman with Turkya (ibid. pp. 777 and 502).\n\n42. I may quote a statement from the Yuan ch'ao pi shi pointing to the fact, that even before the rise of Chinghiz khan, Mohammedan merchants carried on trade with the nomade tribes in\nthe most eastern part of Mongolia. Compare Palladius' translation, p. 95:\u2014\"When Chinghiz was encamping on the lake Baldjuna (1203),\" a Mohammedan (the Mongol text has Sartatui, i.e. a native of the country of the Sarti) by name Asan (Hassan), arrived from Alahushi digit huri of the tribe Wangut. He took along with him a thousand sheep and a white camel, for his passage down the river Ergunie, to barter for sable and squirrel skins. When he stopped at the lake to water his sheep he met with Chinghiz.\"\n\nThe conquests of Chinghiz and his successors had opened a highway of communication between the east and the west of Asia; and western people began to frequent the far east, and even to settle there. The Mongol emperors patronized the colonization of China by foreigners; and with respect to the Mohammedans, it seems, that since Hulagu khan the brother of Mangu khan, ruled over western Asia, emigration from Persia to China had considerably increased. I think it not unlikely, that the Mohammedans now scattered over the whole of China proper, and forming large communities especially in the provinces of Kansu, Shansi and Chili, are for the greater part descendants of those Saracens mentioned by M. Polo in the same provinces. Rashid-eddin states, in his description of China (Yule's Cathay, p. 269), that in his time all the inhabitants of Karadjang (or Yunnan) were Mohammedans; and I feel tolerably certain also, that the Mohammedan power, which suddenly rose in the Chinese province of Yunnan, about ten years ago, may be traced back to the time of the Mongol emperors.\n\n43. The Yuan-shi gives many biographies of distinguished Mohammedans in the service of the Mongols. A number of them occupied high offices. I may quote the names of the Hui-ho met with in the history of the Mongols, and notice occasionally some particulars from their biographies.\n\nIn chap. cxxv, we find the biography of Sai-dien-ch'i shan-sae-ding, called also Wu-ma-r. He was a Hui-hui and a descendant of the Bie-an-bo-r. In his country Sai-dien-ch'i has the same meaning as \u8d35\u65cf (noble family) in Chinese. There is a long biography of Sai-dien-ch'i,\n\n---\n\n* The Mohammedan authors also mention Chinghiz' encamping there, but they speak of a river Baldjuna (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 72). The Baldjuna lake or river seems to have been somewhere near the Kerulun river. D'Ohsson locates it too far northward.\n\n* Alacush tikin curi of Rashid, chief of the tribe of the Onguts (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 84). See also above, 3.\n\n* The river Argun, a tributary of the Amur. It comes out from the northern corner of the lake Kulon nor, into which the Kerulun empties itself from the south.\n\n* Peighambar in Persian means \"prophet.\"\nfrom which we learn that he submitted to Chinhiz when the latter waged war in western Asia, and entered his life-guard. Under Ogotai and Mangu khans he was governor, and held other offices. Kubilai khan appointed him minister (see also the list of the ministers, in the Yuan shi, chap. cxii). He died in Yunnan, where he had been governor. Five sons of Sai-dien-ch'i are mentioned, viz. \u7d0d\u901f\u524c\u4e01 Na-su-la-ding (Nasr-uddin), \u54c8\u6563 Ha-san (Hassan), \u5ffd\u8f9b Hu-sin (Hussein), \u5584\u901f\u4e01\u5140\u9ed8\u91cc Shan-su-ding wu-mo-li and \u99ac\u901f\u5ffd Ma-su-hu. All these held high offices.\n\nNa-su-la-ding has a separate biography in the same chapter. He was governor in Yunnan, and distinguished himself in the war with the southern tribes of \u4ea4\u8dbe Kiao-chi (Cochin-china) and \u65b0 Mien (Burma). He died in 1292, the father of twelve sons, the names of five of which are given in the biography, viz. \u4f2f\u984f \u5bdf\u5152 Bo-yen ch'a-r, who had a high office, \u70cf\u99ac\u5152 Wu-ma-r, \u7b54\u6cd5\u5152 Dje-fa-r (Djafar), \u5ffd\u5152 Hu-sien (Hussein) and \u6c99\u7684 Sha-di (Saadi).\n\nThe Sai-dien-ch'i of the Chinese authors is without doubt the same personage spoken of by Rashid (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 467) under the name of Sayid Edjell. According to the Persian historian, he was a native of Bokhara, and governor of Karadjang (Yunnan) when Kubilai entered the country, under the reign of Mangu. Subsequently he was appointed vizier, and in the beginning of Kubilai's reign he had charge of the finances. His son Nasr-uddin was appointed governor in Karadjang, and retained his position in Yunnan till his death, which Rashid, writing about A.D. 1300, says occurred five or six years before (according to the Yuan shi, Na-su-la ding died in 1292). Nasr-uddin's son Abu-beker, who had the surname Bayan Fenchan (evidently the Bo-yen ch'a-r of the Yuan shi), was governor in Zaitun at the time Rashid wrote. He bore also his grandfather's title of Sayid Edjell, and was minister of Finance under Kubilai's successor (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 476, 507, 508). Nasr-uddin is mentioned by M. Polo, who styles him Nescrudin (vol. ii, p. 66).\n\n44. In chap. cxxiii of the Yuan shi, we find the biography of \u963f\u524c\u74e6\u800c\u601d A-la-wa-r-sze, who is stated there to have been a Hui-ho and a native of \u516b\u74e6\u8033 Ba-wa-r (probably Baurd a city of Khorassan of which I shall speak further on, in Part VI). He was commander of a thousand in his own country. When Chinghiz arrived at Ba-wa-r, he surrendered and entered his army. His son A-lu-wu-ding (Alai-eddin) was a valiant warrior in Kubilai's\n\n---\n\nThis Bo-yen is not to be confounded with the eminent general of the same name, who was a Mongol, and who is mentioned as Bayan Chinesan by M. Polo (vol. ii, p. 107). The biography of this valiant captain is found in the Yuan shi, chap. cxxvii. He is also spoken of by the Persian historians.\narmy. He died in 1292, at the age of a hundred and two. His son Djan-sze-ding had five sons, namely, Wu-ma-r, A-san-bu-bie, Hin-djo-lan-cha, A-ha-ma (Ahmed) and O-tu-man (Othman).\n\nOther Hui-ho, or Mohammedans, whose biographies have been incorporated in the Yuan shi are the following:\n\nChap. cxxxiv: San-gi-sze.\n\nChap. cxciv: Na-su-la-ding (not the above-mentioned son of Sayid Edjell), the son of Ma-ho-mu (Mahmud).\n\nChap. cxvii: T'ie-li-mi-shi.\n\nChap. ccv: \u963f\u5408\u99ac A-ho-ma (Ahmed). His biography is placed in the Yuan shi under the rubric \u8caa\u81e3 \u201cVillainous Ministers.\u201d This is the \u201ccertain Saracen named Achmath,\u201d to whom M. Polo has devoted a long chapter entitled \u201cOppressions of Achmath\u201d (vol. i, p. 370).\n\nAnother Mohammedan, who held high offices in China under Chinghiz and his successors, was Mahmud Yelvadj. His son Massoud was governor in Turkestan. Both are spoken of by the Persian authors as well as in the Yuan shi. For further details on these personages, see my Notes on Chin, Med. Trav. p. 110.\n\nThe Annals of the Yuan-shi mention further, a Mohammedan named \u5967\u90fd\u524c\u5408\u883b Ao-du-la-ha-man, to whom Ogotai khan had leased on rent all the revenues of his empire. He is stated in the Chinese annals to have caused indirectly the death of Ogotai, by making him a present of wine. The khan, who was given to drinking, found it so delicious, that he drank until midnight, and the next morning expired, in December, 1241 (Yuan shi, sub anno). D\u2019Ohsson (tom. ii, p. 189) calls this man Abdur Rahman. It seems he quotes the name from the Persian authors.\n\n45. In the biographies of the following, where the \u897f\u57df Si-y\u00fc is given as their native country, evidently Persia is meant.\n\nChap. cxx: \u624e\u516b\u5152\u706b\u8005 Dja-ba-r huo-djo, a valiant companion in arms of Chinghiz. In his biography it is stated, that he was a native of \u8d5b\u5937 Sai-yi, which country (or tribe) is said there to be in the Si-y\u00fc. He was the chief of his tribe; wherefore he bore the name Huo-djo, which in their language is the name of an office. He was of a tall figure, had a splendid beard, large eyes (\u65b9\u77b3) and a broad forehead. He was brave, and a skilful rider and archer. Chinghiz khan accidentally seeing this man in his army, was surprised at his appearance, and became interested in him. This must have happened at an early period of Chinghiz khan\u2019s career, for further on Dja-ba-r is stated to have been with the conqueror when he waged war with Wang han (Ong khan of\n\n---\n\n*Perhaps Seyistan is meant.*\n\n**Panthier (M. Polo, p. exxvii, note 2) translates the Persian title Kh\u00f4djah by \u201c\u2018un homme de distinction,\u2019 un \u2018gouverneur.\u2019\u201d\nThus it seems that Mohammedans served in the Mongol army, even before the rise of Chinghiz. The biography states also, that Dja-ba-r had been intrusted by Chinghiz with a mission to the celebrated Taouist monk Kiu Ch'ang-ch'un, who lived among the mountains of \u5d69\u5c71 K'un-lun. Ch'ang-ch'un asked Dja-ba-r which he would prefer,\u2014honors and splendor, or a numerous posterity? Dja-ba-r answered, \"After a hundred years, riches and splendor will be of no value to me; but I should wish my sons and grandsons to be prosperous, and to continue my lineage.\" Ch'ang-ch'un said\u2014\"Your wish shall be realized.\" And indeed it was so; Dja-ba-r died at the age of a hundred and eighteen, and several of his descendants are mentioned in his biography.\n\nChap. cxxxiii: K'ie-lie.\n\nChap. cxlii: Che-lie t'ie-mu-r, a native of \u963f\u9b6f\u6eab A-lu-wen in the Si-y\u00fc (A-lu-wen is perhaps Holvan between Kirmanshah and Bagdad).\n\nChap. cciii: \u963f\u8001\u74e6\u4e01 A-lao-wa-ding (Alai-eddin), a man from \u6728\u767c\u91cc Mu-fa-li in the Si-y\u00fc (Mu-fa-li is probably intended for Moafarin, a fortress north-east of Diarbekir, taken by the Mongols in 1260). \u4ea6\u601d\u99ac\u56e0 I-sze-ma-yin (Ismael), a man from \u80e1\u70c8 H\u00fc-lie in the Si-y\u00fc. (Although by H\u00fc-lie the Chinese text seems to indicate a place, \u897f\u57df\u80e1\u70c8\u4eba, it is possible however, that originally \"a man belonging to Hulagu\" was intended; for in the Yuan shi Hulagu's name is always written \u80e1\u70c8\u5140 H\u00fc-lie-wu). Both A-lao-wa-ding and I-sze-ma-yin were Persian engineers, expert at the construction and working of catapults. They had been sent from Persia to China in 1271, and their machines were employed at the siege of Siang-yang fu.\n\nThe biography of I-sze-ma-yin's son I-ho-di-ya-r-ding is found in chap. cxxxvii.\n\nIn chap. xlviii,\u2014on Astronomy,\u2014mention is made of \u624e\u99ac\u524c\u4e01 Dja-ma-la-ding, a Persian astronomer, who in 1267 brought a number of astronomical instruments from the Si-y\u00fc to the Mongol capital Ta-tu (Peking). The instruments are enumerated by their Persian names, and a description is also given.\n\n46. The historians of the Ming, always term the Mohammedans \u56de\u56de Hui-hui, and as I have stated above, this is the name also by which all professors of Islam in China proper as well as in central and western Asia, are known to the Chinese of our day.\n\nNot to be confounded with the great mountain chain K'un-lun in central Asia. The mountains here spoken of, are in the province of Shantung, the native country of Ch'ang-ch'un, south-east of Ning-hai chou. They are marked on modern Chinese maps. With respect to Ch'ang-ch'un, compare my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 15\u201417. In 1220 Chinghiz sent a second time to invite the sage, who then set out to meet the emperor in western Asia.\nIn concluding my notices of the Mohammedans, I may venture to make a few remarks on the Dungen or Tungan, a name applied by the nations of Turkish race in Asia to the Chinese Mohammedans. It is known that in 1862, the Mohammedans in the Chinese dominions revolted against Chinese (Manchu) authority. The central seat of this rebellion was (and seems to be still) the province of Kansu; whence the insurrection spread rapidly over the whole of eastern Turkistan, and in 1864 reached the province of Ili, bordering on Siberia. Some years later, the Tungan made themselves masters of Ili, but were subsequently expelled by the Russians (by a single cannon shot as I have been told by an eyewitness), who in 1870 took possession of Kuldja, the capital of Ili.\n\nSince the outbreak of the Mohammedan insurrection in Ili, the name of Tungan has become more generally known in Russia, and has given rise to many conjectures by Russian and other orientalists and ethnologists, as to the origin of the people and the etymology of the name. Some have tried to trace the origin of the Tungan back to Alexander the Great; others suggest that they have been left in central Asia by Tamerlane; alleging in favour of their view, that Turmak in Turkish, means \"to leave behind\" (sic!).\n\nCompare General Heins' article on the Dungen in the Proceedings of the Russian Geogr. Soc. 1866, vol. ii, p. 77. General Heins states, that the Dungen call themselves Turgen. Prof. Vambery translates Tungan by \"a convert\" (in Turki). See Col. Yule's M. Polo, vol. i, p. 255. But the strangest hypothesis with respect to the name Tungan,\u2014which I may quote as a curiosity,\u2014has been put forward by Mr. Hoyer in the Russian military journal (The Invalid, 1869, No. 98). He states, that soon after Islamism had spread over central Asia (i.e. in the 9th or 10th century), the Chinese government, apprehensive of the increasing power of the Mohammedans, transferred a number of them from Turkistan to the Chinese province of Kansu, whence they spread gradually over the whole of China; wherefore the Chinese termed the Mohammedans Tung Kan-su, meaning \"the same as the (Mohammedan) people of Kansu\" (sic!).\n\nMr. Hoyer intends probably \u540c\u7518\u82e6 Tung Kan-su; but the name Tungan is completely unknown to the Chinese, who designate all Mohammedans of Asia by the name of Hut-hui.\n\nAll attempts to explain the word Tungan and its origin have proved to be unsatisfactory. We know only that the Tungan are Mohammedans, that they speak Chinese, and are dressed in the Chinese fashion (at least in Ili). Compare General Heins, l.c. p. 80. It is also impossible to say at what time the name Tungan first appeared in central Asia. Among European travellers, Putimtzeff\n\nI may observe that Kan-su as the name of a Chinese province, appears first in the Mongol period (see Yilan shi, geographical part).\nseems to be the first who mentions the Tungan. This Russian traveller, who in 1811 visited Kuldja, published his interesting narrative, in Russian, in a Siberian periodical. Klaproth in his Magasin Asiatique, tom. i, pp. 174, 594 sqq. has given a French translation of it, l. c. p. 215, in which we read:\u2014\"Les principaux habitants de Gouldja sont les Chinois appel\u00e9s Kara-kitat-Noyontuk,\" et des Tougean. Ces derniers se regardent comme les descendants des guerriers de T\u00e9mir-aksa ou Tamerlane. Ils sont rigides sectateurs de l'Islamisme, mais ils parlent Chinois. Ils sont aussi bourrus, grosiers et hautains que les Chinois, dont ils ont emprunt\u00e9 l'habillement, les usages et les vices.\"\u2014I have no doubt that Tougean was a misprint in the Russian text (to which I have not access) for Tungan, all the more so as, on p. 216 in the same translation Klaproth writes the name of the same people Toupgan.\u2014\"Les Chinois de Gouldja exercent diff\u00e9rens m\u00e9tiers. . . . Les Toupgan cultivent des jardins, tiennent auberges et font dans les march\u00e9s le commerce de d\u00e9tail.\" The Toupgan are mentioned also in several other parts of Ili, in Putimtzeff's narrative. Here Klaproth probably took the Russian n (which is written H) for a p (n), or perhaps the misprint was in the Russian text. At the time Klaproth wrote, the name Tungan was completely unknown in Europe; the great orientalist therefore could give no explanation on this subject. However at p. 210, Klaproth in his translation writes correctly:\u2014\"Un Mahom\u00e9tan nomm\u00e9 Toungan, . . . qui tenait auberge, nous invita chez lui.\"\n\nThe Tungan are mentioned also by some Mecca pilgrims, who visited Yarkand, as carrying on trade in that city. Compare Wathen's \"Memoir on Chinese Tartary and Khoten\" in The Journ. of Asiat. Soc. of Bengal, 1835, iv. The same pilgrims report, that the principal seats of the Tungan are in Salar and Seiram.\n\nBurnes, who in 1832 visited Bokhara, gathered some information there from merchants of Yarkand about the Tungan, who are represented by him, as Mohammedans from the adjacent provinces (of Chinese Turkistan it seems), being dressed in the Chinese fashion, and employed for garrisoning the cities of eastern Turkistan.\n\nThis is all that I have been able to gather with respect to the Tungan. I may finally say a few words concerning the places Salar and Seiram, mentioned by the Mecca pilgrims. By the latter, probably Sairam or Sairim in eastern Turkistan west of Kuche is meant. This place is marked on modern Chinese maps as\n\n---\n\n*As I was informed by a Russian gentleman, who lately had been in Kuldja, the Chinese there are indeed called Kara-kitat (by the Kirghiz). This name has no connection with the Kara-khitai of the middle ages. Nogontuk in Mongol means \"the green banner,\" in Chinese \u7da0\u71df lu ying. This is the name for the troops formed exclusively of Chinese.*\nSai-li-mu and Hui-ch'eng (Mohammedan city). It is not to be confounded with Sairam in Russian Turkistan. There is also a lake north-east of Kuldja, which bears the name Sairam.\n\nWith respect to Salar, Archimandrite Palladius in his article on \"the Mohammedans in China,\" l. c. p. 443, gives a detailed account, drawn from Chinese sources, of the Mohammedans of Salar and their origin. We learn from this article that they were originally Uigurs from Khamil. Since the last century, Salar has always been the hotbed of Mohammedan anti-Chinese machinations, and this place also sustained an important r\u00f4le in the last Mohammedan insurrection. The Mohammedan community of Sa-la-r belongs to the district of Ho-chou in Kansu. On Chinese maps it is marked a little north-west of the city of S\u00fcn-hua.\n\nPART IV. CHINGHIZ KHAN'S EXPEDITION TO WESTERN ASIA,\n\nA.D. 1219\u20141225.\n\n47. The material, which hitherto has been worked up by our historians dealing with the conquest of western Asia and eastern Europe by the Mongols, is almost exclusively derived from western, and principally Persian sources. It is only in a few cases, that D'Ohsson in his Histoire des Mongols quotes, with respect to these events, Father Hyacinth's above-mentioned translation of the first three chapters of the Y\u00fcan shi, where the doings of the Mongols are recorded up to the year 1260. It is not to be wondered at, when D'Ohsson, although he possessed a knowledge of the Russian language, has not been able to find in Hyacinth's translation, corroboration of the Persian records; the former being made from a corrupted edition of the Y\u00fcan shi, as I have stated above. I can also understand it, when D'Ohsson says with respect to the Si shi ki (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 57) of which he saw R\u00e9musat's translation:\u2014\"Cet itin\u00e9raire n'a rien ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 nos connaissances\" (D'Ohsson, l. c., tom. iii, p. 138). A correct translation of this ancient narrative, and a translation of an uncorrupted edition of the Y\u00fcan shi would have furnished him with many arguments for his historical researches. I am however far from assigning to the Chinese and Mongol historical accounts regarding the warlike enterprises of the Mongols in the west, a high historical value. These fragmentary and aphoristic notices can often only be understood, when comparing them with the more detailed western records. But it is needless to say that every ancient historical document is calculated to throw some new light, all the more when bearing upon a subject repeatedly ventilated by European savants.\nProceeding from this point of view, I shall present in this part and in the next, comparative notices of western and eastern authors with respect to the Mongol invasions of the countries of the west. I omit the review of Hulagu's expeditions to Persia, Syria, etc. 1258\u20141260; for this subject has already been treated of in my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 60 sqq.\n\n48. I begin with a sketch of the records of Mohammedan writers regarding Chinghiz khan's invasion of western Asia; my notes being an abstract from D'Ohsson's work (tom. i, chap. 7), to which I shall add my remarks.\n\nMohammed Khorazm shah, on his return from an expedition to Irak Adjem in 1218, received at Bokhara some envoys from Chinghiz khan (who however were all subjects of the shah,\u2014it seems Mohammedan merchants returning from Mongolia). They brought presents and a peaceful message, with a proposal of the Mongol khan, to establish regular commercial intercourse between Mongolia and the dominions of the shah. Mohammed apparently received them with cordiality, but felt that it would be to his prejudice to form an alliance with Chinghiz, acknowledging his supremacy. After this Chinghiz dispatched a caravan consisting of four hundred merchants, all Mohammedans, to Khorazm; who were also intrusted with diplomatic messages. But when they arrived at Otrar they were plundered and put to death, by order of the governor of that place, by name Inaldjuc ga\u00efr khan; and this was the origin of the war. Before beginning hostilities, Chinghiz sent a Turk named Bagra, accompanied by two Mongol officers, to ask satisfaction for these outrages; but Bagra was executed by order of Mohammed, and the two Mongol officers were sent back after having been shaved. Some time subsequently, Mohammed began hostilities by attacking a body of Mongols, who had pursued the Merkits to the territories of the Kankali. This battle took place north of the city of Djend on the lower Sihon.\n\nTowards the end of 1218 Chinghiz left his ordo, intrusting his younger brother Uadjukin with the government of his states. The Mongol army spent the whole summer of 1219 on the river Irtysh, in order to equip anew and to complete the cavalry. Chinghiz was joined there by the prince of the Uigurs (Bardjuc) by\n\n---\n\n79 As to the number of merchants sent by Chinghiz to Khorazm, and killed in Otrar, the Mohammedan authors do not agree in their statements. Some assert, that there were only four. Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-tsai, who in his narrative (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 115) speaks of the catastrophe of Otrar, states that several envoys of Chinghiz and several hundreds of merchants had been murdered on this occasion. The Yilan ch'ao pi shi (Palladius' translation, p. 143) says, with respect to the same event:\u2014\"The Sartol had killed Chinghiz khan's envoy Wu-hun, and put to death a hundred men in all.\"\n\n80 See my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 111, note 7.\nSignae Tekin prince of Almalik, and by Arslan khan of the Karluks. The army marched out in autumn; and no resistance was opposed to the Mongol arms, until the Sihon (Yaxartes) had been reached.\n\n49. When the army had arrived at Otrar (end of 1219 it seems), it was divided into four corps, the first of which, commanded by Chinghiz khan's sons Ogota\u00ef and Chagata\u00ef, invested Otrar. The second, under the command of Chinghiz' eldest son Djuchi, was directed to the right, against the city of Djend. The third corps, conducted by the Mongol generals Alac, Sugtu and Togai, marched up the Sihon upon Benaket (written also Fenaket). Chinghiz himself with the main army advanced upon Bokhara.\n\nAfter a five months' siege, Otrar was captured and pillaged; its governor Ga\u00efr khan was taken prisoner, and afterwards put to death by having melted silver poured into his ears and eyes.\n\nDjuchi on his way towards Djend arrived at Signac. The town was captured after having been stormed for seven days. Ozkend, Burkhalighkend and Eshnass suffered the same fate. Djuchi then marched against Djend, which was also stormed. One division was dispatched to take Yenguikend. All these cities were situated on the Sihon; the last at a distance of two days' journey from the lake of Khorazm (Aral). The Uigur troops, numbering ten thousand men, were then allowed to return home, and were replaced by ten thousand Turkmans.\n\nThe left flank of the Mongol army was also successful in its operations. Benaket, which was garrisoned by Turk-Kankalis, surrendered. The Mongols then attacked Khodjend, whose governor was the valiant Timur-melik. Being constrained to abandon Khojend, he retired with a thousand men to a castle on an island in the Sihon, where he held out for a long time. But having lost the greater part of his troops, he was at length forced to fly, and succeeded in reaching Khorazm, where he joined Djelal-eddin, the son of Mohammed shah, from whom he did not separate until the death of that prince.\n\nMeanwhile Chinghiz, accompanied by his son Tului, had advanced into Transoxiana, and in March of 1220 appeared at Bokhara, which was then a large and magnificent city. After\n\n---\n\n*1 The Mohammedan authors give no details regarding the march of Chinghiz from the Irtysh to the Sihon. I have translated from Ye-lii Ch'u-ts'ai's narrative, the itinerary of the way followed by the Mongol armies proceeding to the west (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 108).\n\n*2 This statement does not agree with the Yuan shi; for in the biography of the prince of the Uigurs, it is stated, that he assisted at the storming of Ni-sha-bu-r (see further on, Part VI, article \"Uigurs\").\n\n*3 This is the first date D'Ohsson gives after the starting from the Irtysh\nseveral days' siege, the garrison tried to force its way through the Mongol lines, but was almost destroyed. The city surrendered, but the citadel held out twelve days.\n\nChinghiz next advanced along the fertile valley of the Sogd (Zarafshan river of our maps) towards Samarcan, which was then garrisoned by forty thousand men, most of whom were Kankalis. Samarcan surrendered in April, 1220, when the greater part of the inhabitants were slaughtered.\n\n50. Whilst the Mongols devastated Transoxiana, Mohammed shah behaved with the greatest indifference. He was at Samarcan, when the enemy entered Transoxiana, and then fled to Nakhsheb. He was at first disposed to repair to Ghazna; but when he had reached Balkh, he was persuaded by one of his viziers to retreat to Irak Adjem. On the 18th of April he halted at Nishabur; but after a rest of three weeks was obliged to start again, being informed of the approach of the Mongols through Khorassan. He then took the road to Kasvin, where his son Rokn-eddin was said to have rallied about thirty thousand troops.\n\nWhen sojourning at Samarcan, Chinghiz had sent two corps in pursuit of Mohammed, under the command of Chebe (see note 66) and Subutai bahadur. They crossed the Djihun (Oxus,\u2014Amu-daria) at Pendjab, and advanced into Khorassan. Chebe took the way through Nishabur to Mazanderan, whilst Subutai proceeded through the Cumuss to Irac Adjem, passing through Kubushan, Thus, Esfearin, Damegan and Simnan. Both corps met at Rayi (near the present Teheran).\n\nMohammed trying to flee to Bagdad, was near being taken by the Mongols; but he succeeded in escaping, and retired through the mountainous country of Ghilan to Mazanderan. The Mongols however were already masters of that country, and Amol and Asterabad had been sacked. Mohammed arrived in Mazanderan almost alone, and hid himself for some days in a village on the shore of the Caspian, till his asylum was betrayed, when he fled to a small island in the sea of Absukun (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 255), where he subsequently died from an attack of pleurisy.\n\n(autumn, 1219). The military events above related must have taken place in the beginning of the year 1220.\n\n* * * I shall speak more fully of this valiant Mongol general (see note 103). Bahadur is an honorific title meaning \"brave\" in Turkish (D'Ohsson, tom. i. p. 35). The Russian bogatyry, \"a valiant man,\u2014a champion,\" seems to have the same origin. We meet this title frequently in the Yuan shi, where the term is generally rendered by \u62d4\u90fd\u5152 Ba-du-r. See chap. cxxiii,\u2014biography of Shan-che ba-du-r.\n\n[This is probably the same root as the Manchu honorific title Baluru, meaning \"brave,\"\u2014now conferred as a military distinction.\u2014Ed. Com.]\n\n* * * Ebn Haukal (10th century) states that Absukun is a town on the\nTurkan khatun, the mother of Mohammed, had at that time left Keurcandje the capital of Khorazm, and hid herself with the princesses in the castle of Ilal among the mountains of Mazanderan; but she was discovered and obliged to surrender. Compare Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-t'ei's notice of Turkan khatun, in my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 117.\n\n51. After the fall of Samarcand, Chinghiz encamped his army in the country between this town and Nakhsheb, and spent the whole summer of 1220 there. In autumn the military operations recommenced. One army, commanded by Chinghiz' sons Djuchi, Ogotai and Chagatai, was sent against Keurcandje, or Orcandje, the capital of Khorazm, which at that time had no ruler; for owing to a revolt of the troops, Dsjelal-eddin had been constrained to leave, and had fled to Ghazna. He was accompanied by the valiant Timurmelik (see above). Tului, the fourth son of Chinghiz, received orders to devastate Khorassan; whilst Chinghiz himself directed the main army to the south, beginning this expedition with the siege of Termed, situated on the north bank of the Sihon; which was captured after ten days' storming. Chinghiz then wintered (1220\u20141221) in the district of Seman, whence Badakhshan was invaded.\n\nIn the spring of 1221, Chinghiz crossed the Sihon with his army. The city of Balkh surrendered; but being afraid to leave it, Chinghiz slaughtered the inhabitants and reduced the city to ashes. Hence he advanced upon the fortress of Nuseretkuh, situated in the mountainous country of Talecan. This place had been ineffectually besieged by one of his generals for six months; but was captured when Chinghiz' army arrived.\n\nMeanwhile Tului, executing the orders of his father, had invaded Khorassan, and sent his brother-in-law Togachar with the avant-guard to Nessa. After having sacked this place he advanced upon Nishabur (Nov. 1220), but was killed on the third day of the siege. Tului directed his main army, numbering seventy thousand men, upon Meru shahidjan, which was captured in February, 1221, and then marched upon Nishabur. The latter place was taken by assault, and the destruction of the city occupied fifteen days (April, 1221). Thence Tului pursued his way to Herat (more generally styled Heri in the middle ages). A detachment of his forces destroyed the tomb of the calif Harun al Rashid near the town of\n\nshore of the Caspian, and the sea-port of the city of Djurdjan. Massudi (10th century) speaks also of this city, which he styles Abisgun, as situated on the sea of Khazar, and plundered by the Russians in the 10th century. Compare Klaproth's Magaz. Asiat. tom. i, p. 277. The ruins of the port of Abisgun can still be seen at the mouth of the river Djurdjen (Transactions of the Russian Geogr. Soc. 1871, vol. iv, p. 103).\nThus; and the country of Kuhistan, through which Tului's way lay, was laid waste. The Mongols arrived at Herat, and after eight days' attack, and the death of its governor, the city offered to capitulate. On the capture of this place, Tului joined his father in Talecan.\n\nAt that time Orcandje, the capital of Khorazm had also been taken by the other sons of Chinghiz, after a siege of more than six months. The capture of the place had been partly retarded owing to a disagreement, which had arisen between Djuchi and Chagatai. When Chinghiz heard of this quarrel, he grew very angry and ordered Ogotai to take the command. After the fall of Orcandje, Ogotai and Chagatai both came to join their father. Only Djuchi remained in the country north of the Sihon.\n\n52. Chinghiz after spending the summer of 1221 among the mountains surrounding Talecan, recommenced operations and advanced towards Ghazna, where Djelal-eddin had rallied considerable forces. The Mongols were detained a whole month by the siege of the fortress of Kerduan. After the place had surrendered, Chinghiz crossed the Hindu-kush and attacked Bamian. There one of his favourite grandsons was killed, and to avenge his death, he ordered the city to be destroyed and the whole district to be made a desert.\n\nThe Mongol general Shiki Cutucu had been posted with a corps of observation on the mountainous frontiers of Cabul and Zabelstan, to cover the operations of Chinghiz. This corps was defeated by Djelal-eddin in the plain of Beruan; but the latter was not able to profit by his victory, being abandoned by a part of his troops; he therefore determined to retreat towards the river Sind. He was pursued rapidly by Chinghiz, who arrived at Ghazna fifteen days after the sultan had left it. Djelal-eddin had not yet crossed the river when the Mongols arrived. A desperate battle was fought, in which the sultan's troops were defeated. The sultan jumped into the river with his horse and swam across it. This happened in December, 1221. Some time after, Djelal-eddin was said again to rally some forces beyond the Sind. Chinghiz then sent his two generals Bela and Turtai in pursuit of the sultan, who retired towards Delhi (in spring of 1222). They proceeded to invest Multan; but as it held out bravely, and they were afraid of the terrible heat there, they retired again to Ghazna, after ravaging the provinces of Multan, Lahore, Peshawur and Melikpur.\n\nOn the defeat of Djelal-eddin, Chinghiz sent Ogotai to destroy Ghazna, and the general Ilchikadai received orders to punish Herat, which had revolted. After a siege of six months Herat was taken, on the 14th of June, 1222, and destroyed. Besides this, Meru\nwas plundered for the second time. Ogotai after having destroyed Ghazna, asked permission to attack the city of Sistan; but Chinghiz objected owing to the excessive heat, and recalled his son.\n\nChinghiz spent the summer of 1222 in the plain of Beruan with his troops; and when Bela and Turtai returned from India, the whole army set out again. Ogotai joined the main army with his corps near the fort Gunaun kurgan. The Mongols wintered in the mountainous country of Buya-ketuer, about the sources of the Sind.\n\nIn the spring of 1223, Chinghiz determined to return home to Mongolia by way of India and Tubet. The army indeed moved out in this direction, but was obliged to return to Peshawur, owing to the great difficulties the route presented. Having crossed the mountains of Bamian, the conqueror passed the summer of 1223 in the district of Bacalan, where he had left the heavy baggage. In the autumn he started again; and on passing Balkh, ordered the extermination of the population, who in the meanwhile had reoccupied the ruins. He then crossed the Sihon and advanced to Bokhara.\n\nThe winter of 1223\u20141224 was spent near Samarcand. In the spring of 1224 the army marched out again. On the river Sihon, Chinghiz was joined by his sons Ogotai and Chagatai, who had been engaged in hunting near Bokhara. In the summer of the same year he encamped in the district of Calan tashi, and passed his time in hunting excursions. In February of 1225 Chinghiz reached his ordo in Mongolia.\n\n---\n\n** See my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 48, note 118.\n\nIt is not without interest that we compare these records of the Persian historians regarding Chinghiz' expedition to western Asia, with the Si yu ki or narrative of Ch'ang-ch'un's journey to the conqueror, who was then encamped among the Hindu-kush mountains (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav.). The diarist of Ch'ang-ch'un's expedition writes as an eye-witness, and his dates receive a stamp of authenticity by the fact, that the data he gives for the occurrence of a total solar eclipse they observed on their route, is in perfect accordance with the truth, as has been proved by Mr. A. Wylie's investigations on this subject (see the Appendix to my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav.). It may be said, that all the details in the narrative with respect to Chinghiz and the war in western Asia, agree well with the statements of the Persian authors, with the exception, that according to the latter, Chinghiz sojourned a year longer in western Asia than Ch'ang-ch'un's narrative will admit. I shall point out this discrepancy. With respect to the date of Chinghiz' starting from Mongolia, both the Si yu ki and the Djami ut Tevarikh agree. The latter states, that the Mongol army, after having passed the whole summer of 1219 on the Irtysh, moved out in autumn of the same year. In the Si yu ki we read (l. c., p. 17) that in the 5th month of 1219 Chinghiz was in the country of the Naimans, who as is known dwelt on the Irtysh. In April, 1220, when Ch'ang-ch'un arrived at Peking, he was informed that Chinghiz had left for the west. On the 29th of October, 1221, Ch'ang-ch'un met, between\n53. Let us turn now to the Chinese and Mongol records concerning the events related in the foregoing pages. In the Annals of the Y\u00fcan shi we read sub anno 1219:\n\n\"In summer, in the 6th month (of the preceding year), the envoys of the emperor had been killed in the Si-y\u00fc (see above, 48), and the emperor determined to lead an army in person against these countries. He captured the city of \u8a31\u5854\u523a \u014c-t'a-la (Otrar), and the chief of this place, by name \u54c8\u53ea\u5152\u53ea\u95cd\u79c3 Ha-dji-r dji-lan-to,\" was made prisoner.\n\n\"Ibid. sub anno 1220, in the 3rd month of spring, the emperor took the city of \u6355\u83ef Bu-hua (Bokhara), and in the 5th month \u975e\u601d\u5e72 S\u00fcn-sze-kan (Samarcand). After this he pitched his camp at \u5fc5\u77f3\u7684\u77f3 Ye-shi-di-shi.\" In autumn \u5e79\u812b\u7f85\u5152 Wo-t'o-lo-r was captured.\n\n\"Ibid. sub anno 1221, in spring, the emperor besieged the cities of\n\nTalas and Sairam, a Chinese envoy returning from Chinghiz' encampment, who had seen the conqueror in the beginning of June of the same year, and who reported that he was pursuing the sultan to India (l. c. p. 35). According to Rashid, Chinghiz spent the summer of 1221 among the mountains of Talecan, and arrived at Bamian it seems only in autumn. In December, 1221, Djelal-eddin was defeated on the Sind. Ch'ang-ch'un after his arrival at Samarcand on December 3rd, 1221, went twice to the encampment of the emperor. The first time he started from Samarcan on April 26th, 1222, crossed the Amu-daria on May 10th, saw the emperor on the 16th, and went with him to pass the summer on the snowy mountains. According to Rashid, Chinghiz was at that time in the plain of Beruan by the Hindu-kush (north of Cabul). In June Ch'ang-ch'un returned to Samarcan, set out for the second time on September 14th, and arrived in fourteen days at the encampment of the emperor, which seems then to have been at a distance of only three days' journey from the Amu-daria; for according to the Si yu ki, the emperor set out for the north on October 3rd, and crossed the Amu-daria on the 6th. Ch'ang-ch'un accompanied Chinghiz on his way to Samarcan, where they arrived in November, 1222. Chinghiz' encampment was 30 li east of the city. In March of 1223, Ch'ang-ch'un was with the emperor east of the Sihon, it seems near Tashkand, when the latter was hunting on the mountains to the east; and on the 9th the emperor remarked to the sage:\u2014\"In three or five days my sons will arrive.\" The events there reported are all corroborated by Rashid's records; only there is a discrepancy of just a year between the dates in the two accounts. As I have stated above, according to Rashid, it was only in the spring of 1223 that Chinghiz determined to return home; he spent the winter 1223-1224 near Samarcan. In the summer of 1224, after having crossed the Sihon, he was hunting in the district of Calan tashi, which answers it seems to Tashkand. I am inclined to assume, that Ch'ang-ch'un's narrative gives the correct dates, and that the Persian authors have been mistaken in retaining Chinghiz a year longer in western Asia.\n\n** Here evidently Inaldjuc gair khan (see 48) is meant. Mr. Berezin in his translation of the Djami ut Tevarich, vol. ii, p. 74, writes his full name and title, Hal Sultan Inaldjuc, Gair Sultan.\n\n** According to the Persian authors, Chinghiz encamped in the summer of 1220 between Samarcan and Nakhshreb.\n\u535c\u54c8\u5152 Bu-ha-r and \u859b\u601d\u8ff7\u5e72 Sie-mi-sze-kan.\u00b0\u00b0 Dju-ch'i, the (eldest) son of the emperor, took the cities of \u9806\u5409\u5e72 Yang-gi-kan and \u516b\u5152\u7570 Ba-r-djen.\u00b0 In summer in the 4th month, the emperor moved out to an encampment near the \u9435\u9580\u95dc T'ie-men-kuan (Iron-gate pass).\u00b0 Here he gave audience to an envoy of the Kin, etc.\u00b0\u00b0 In autumn the city of \u73ed\u52d2\u7d07 Ban-le-ho (Balkh) was taken.\u00b0\u00b0 The princes \u694a\u8d64 Dju-ch'i, \u5bdf\u5408\u53f0 Ch'a-ho-tai and \u7aa9\u95cd\u53f0 Wo-k'uo-t'ai captured the city of \u7389\u9f8d\u5091\u8d64 Y\u00fc-lung-gie-ch'i (Orcandje or Urgendj, the capital of Khorazm), and other places. In winter, in the 10th month, the prince \u62d6\u96f7 T'o-let took the cities of \u99ac\u9b6f\u5bdf\u8449\u53ef Ma-lu-ch'a-ye-k'o.\u00b0\u00b0 \u99ac\u9b6f Ma-lu (Meru, Merv) and \u6614\u524c\u601d Si-la-sze.\u00b0\u00b0\n\n\u00b0\u00b0 The Chinese historians, who compiled the Yuan shi from official documents, have evidently been misled by the different spellings of the names of the same cities in different reports; for O-t'a-la and Wo-t'o-la-r both mean Otrar, Bu-hua and Bu-ha-r are both intended for Bokhara, and Siin-sze-kan and Sie-mi-sze-kan (Semiscant) for Samarcand. Thus they report the capture of the cities of Otrar, Bokhara and Samarcand twice under different years. Owing to this mistake some chronological confusion has crept into the Yuan shi with respect to the first Mongol expedition to western Asia. The events, however, are recorded in the Yuan shi with tolerable correctness.\n\n\u00b0\u00b0 According to the Persian authors, Djuchi took Yenguikend and Bar-khalighkend; the former of which was situated on the Sihon. Levshin, in his Description of the country of the Kirghiz Kaisakhs (in Russian), vol. i, p. 212, speaks of the ruins of Yenguikend, known also under the name of Dja-nikend. They are found at a distance of one hour's journey from the left bank of the Sir-daria, and one day's journey from the mouth of this river. D'Ohsson (tom. i, p. 223) places ancient Yenguikend (meaning \"new city\") on the right bank of the Sihon (see his map), and states (evidently on the authority of the Persian authors) that it was distant two days' journey from the lake of Kho-razu (Aral). Yenguikend is mentioned by Abulfeda (14th century). It is not known at what time it was founded. We read in Carpini's narrative, pp. 749, 750:\u2014\"De terr\u00e2 Cangitarum intravimus terram Bisermiorum (see above, 41) ...... h\u00e1c terr\u00e2 invenimus urbes inumeras subversas, et castella diruta, et villas multas desertas. In h\u00e1c terr\u00e2 est quidam fluvius magnus, ejus nomen ignoramus (the Sihon), super quem est civitas quedam que vocatur Ianckint, et alia que vocatur Barchin, et alia que vocatur Ornas (other reading Or-par), etc.\" It seems that Carpini's Ianckint represents Yenguikend, and his Barchin appears to be the same as the Ba-r-djen of the Chinese and the Bar-khalighkend of the Persian authors. The commentators of Carpini have been much puzzled as to the identification of Ornas (Orpar), and there are some contradictions in his narrative. Probably he meant Otrar.\n\n\u00b0\u00b0 The Iron-gate is a defile in the mountains south of Samarcand. For further particulars, see my Notes on Chin. Med.

Together they stormed the fortress of \u5854\u91cc\u5bd2 Ta-li-han (Talecan); and in order to avoid the great heat of the summer, the emperor pitched his camp near that city. \u624e\u862d\u4e01 Dja-lan-ding the king of the Si-y\u00fc (see 41) joined (or was joined by) \u6ec5\u91cc\u53ef\u6c57 Mie-li k'o-han.

In the biography of Su-bu-tai, \u2014 Yuan shi, chap. cxxi,\u2014 some particulars are found regarding the pursuit of Mohammed shah, with which, according to the Persian authors, the\n\n---\n\n**The Mulahida or Isma\u00eblians in Kuhistan.

He is repeatedly mentioned by the Persian authors, as well as in the Yuan shi; and his name is met with even in the ancient Russian annals. Rashid, treating of the Uriankhits, states that Subutai belonged to that Mongol tribe (Berezin, l. c. vol. i, p. 145). In the Yuan shi he has a long biography, in which all his exploits in China, western Asia, Russia and Hungary are recorded with some detail. I shall give successively in the proper places, translations from his biography. The Yuan shi states that \u9060\u4e0d\u53f0 Su-bu-tai belonged to the \u8499\u53e4 Mcn-gu (Mongol) tribe of the \u5143\u826f\u5408 Wu-liang-ho. His ancestors were hunting together with the ancestors of Chinghiz on the river \u85a9\u96e3 Wa-nan (the Onan in north-eastern Mongolia, an affluent of the Shilka,\u2014resp. the Amur). Su-bu-tai entered Chinghiz' army in the beginning of the 13th century.**\ngenerals Cheb\u00e9 noyen (see note 66) and Subutai bahadur had been intrusted. Mohammed in this biography is erroneously called Melik, and it seems is confounded with Timur-melik.\\(^{104}\\) We read there:\u2014\"When the emperor invaded the kingdom of the Hui-hui (Mohammedans), the ruler of it \u6ec5\u91cc Mie-li fled and abandoned his throne. Then Su-bu-t'ai and Dje-bie received orders to pursue him. They arrived at the river \u7070\u91cc, Hui-li, (?) where Dje-bie attacked the enemy, but without success. Then Su-bu-t'ai made a great fire on the eastern bank of the river, to mislead the enemy with respect to the (Mongol) forces. Mie-li was struck with fear, and fled the same night. Su-bu-t'ai with a host of ten thousand men went in pursuit, passed \u4e0d\u7f55\u5ddd Bu-han ch'uan\\(^{105}\\) and the city of \u5fc5\u91cc\u7f55 Bi-li-han.\\(^{106}\\) He pursued Mie-li uninterruptedly day and night through countries destitute of water (the deserts of Khorassan). Finally, when he was about to catch him, Mie-li fled to an island in the sea, where he died a month after (compare above, 50). Su-bu-t'ai captured all his treasures, precious stones, silver vessels, etc. and sent them to the emperor.\"\n\n55. In the Y\u00fcan shi, Annals, 1223, we read:\u2014\"In order to avoid the heat of the summer, the emperor moved to the valley (or river) \u516b\u9b6f\u7063 Ba-lu-wan (the plain of Peruan in Rashid's record); after which he was joined by the princes Dju-ch'i, Ch'a-ho-t'ai and Wo-k'uo-t'ai, and the general Ba-la, on their return from their expeditions.\\(^{107}\\) When the conquered realms in the Si-y\u00fc were pacified,\n\n---\n\n\\(^{104}\\) In the biography of the Uigur prince Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin,\u2014Y\u00fcan shi, chap. cxxii,\u2014Mohammed shah is termed Hun mie-li su-tun (Khan Melik sultan). See further on.\n\n\\(^{105}\\) I.e. the valley or river of Bu-han. I am not prepared to identify either the Hui-li or the Bu-han river. Probably the names are misspelt. One of them is evidently intended for the Amu-daria (Oxus, Sihon) which however is generally styled \u963f\u6728 A-mu or \u5580\u6728 An-mu by the Chinese (or Mongol) authors of that period. Compare Y\u00fcan shi, Annals, A.D. 1251, and the biography of Kao Pao-y\u00fc,\u2014chap. cxlix,\u2014where the crossing of the Oxus by the Mongols is spoken of. See also Notes on Chin. Med.

In the Yuan ch'ao pi shi we find a more detailed description of the military doings of Chinghiz in the west. The events however are not recorded there in chronological order, and there is some confusion also in its statements. I do not wish to trouble the reader with a complete translation, and will therefore confine myself to quoting from this ancient Mongol record only such passages as may present special interest.\n\nThe year 1219 is given also in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi as the date of Chinghiz' departure for the countries of the west, in accordance with the statements of the Persian authors and the Yuan shi. Chinghiz intrusted his brother Ochegin, it is said, with the government of the Mongol empire, and took with him his wife Hulan; Djebe having command of the avant-guard, and Subut'ai the rear.\n\nThe following names of places occur in the record in connection with the first Mongol expedition to western Asia:\u2014Udarar (Otrar), Bukhar (Bokhara), Siemisiqien (Samarcand) and Niesqiab (Nakhsheb).\n\nDjochi, Djaadai (Chagatai) and Ogadai received orders to cross the river Amuy (Amu-daria or Oxus) and attack the city of Urungechi (Orcandje the capital of Khorazm). When they had reached the city, they sent to Chinghiz to ask who should take the supreme command. Chinghiz ordered Ogodai to take it. Tului took\n\n---\n\n108 See my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 6.\n109 By kue-tuan (upright horn) the Chinese chroniclers understand an animal (of course a fabulous one) which is said to have advised the conqueror to go back and cease his conquests. Further particulars regarding it may be seen in the Yuan shi, chap. cxlvii, biography of Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-ts'ui.\n110 This date is in complete accordance with the statements of the Persian authors (see above, 52).\n111 Compare Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 18, note 12.\n112 Palladius' translation, l. c. p. 146. We read in the same Yuan ch'ao pi shi (l. c. p. 109), that in 1204 Dair assun of the tribe Horse Merke surrendered to Chinghiz, and gave him his daughter Hulan. In the list of the empresses,\u2014Yuan shi, chap. cvi,\u2014Hu-lan appears as the second wife of Chinghiz. Compare also D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 90. Rashid states, that Dair assun, chief of the Uhur Merkits surrendered to Chinghiz on the river Tar, and gave him his daughter Culan. Further on (l. c. tom. i, p. 418), Culan is mentioned by Rashid as the emperor's second wife.\n113 The Persian authors speak of the quarrels of Djuchi and Chagatai\nthe cities of Isiepur (Nishabur), Chukhchelien (Ch'o-ch'o-lan of the Yuan shi), Ilu (Heri or Herat) and Sisten (Sistan).\n\nWe read further in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi:\n\n\"The prince Mielik (Timur-melik) fled and joined Djalalding, the king of the Sartol. When they intended to attack Chinghiz, the latter ordered Shiji Hutulu (Shiki Hutuku of Rashid;\u2014see note 102) to command the avant-guard; but he was defeated by Djalalding, who pursued him near to the place where Chinghiz was encamped. Chinghiz then sent Djebie, Subietai and Tohuchar against Djalalding, who was beaten. He tried at first to escape towards Bukhar; but not succeeding, he fled to the river Shin (Sind), to which point he was pursued. Nearly all his troops were drowned in the river; but Djalalding and Miilik escaped. Bala who was sent in pursuit, crossed the river Shin and proceeded to the country of Hindu. Not being able to find Djalalding, he captured a number of camels and sheep, and returned.\"\n\nChinghiz went up the river Shin, took the city of Batkesie, (?) arrived at the rivers Ekie horohan and Geun horohan, and pitched his camp at Barnan keher. According to the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, Chinghiz spent one summer (it is not clear in what year) in the mountains Altan horhuan, where the king of the Mohammedians was accustomed to encamp. Finally we read in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, that Chinghiz, in the seventh year after he had left Mongolia, in the autumn of 1225, returned to his principal encamping place, Karatun on the river Tula.\n\ninterfering with the progress of the siege of Orcandje. Chinghiz appointed his younger son Ogotai to superintend the siege.\n\nThis is an erroneous statement; for Chinghiz himself went to attack Djalal-eddin, Subatai and Chebe at that time were in the countries near the Caucasus. As to Toguchar, he had been killed before, as Rashid records, at the siege of Nishabur in 1220.\n\nProbably Rashid's Gunauin kurgan (see note 107) near the sources of the Sind.\n\nHere doubtlessly the plain of Peruian is meant. Keher in Mongol means \"a steppe.\"\n\nThe Chinese text of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi renders Karatun by \u9ed1\u6797 (black forest); and in the Yuan shi, Hei-lin is also frequently mentioned as the favorite encamping place of Chinghiz. Rashid-eddin terms the same place Caraun cabdjal, explaining that it means \"black forest\" (D'Ohsen, tom. i, p. 73). Indeed kara in Mongol means \"black\" and oi (genitive = oin) \"forest.\" Cabdjal means \"defile.\" Thus Caraun cabdjal = \"defile of the black forest.\"\n\nThe river Tula has the same name even at the present day. It passes near the city of Urga. Another favourite resting-place of Chinghiz was on the river Kerulun; and according to Palladius' researches (Elucidations of M. Polo's travels, p. 12), the tomb of the conqueror was near the river Kerulun.\n57. The accounts given in the Ts'in cheng lu (see above, 12) of Chinghiz' conquest of western Asia are remarkable for their strong accordance with Rashid's records. There is only a difference in the dates, the Ts'in cheng lu being a year in advance. I shall give a complete translation of the respective accounts, i.e. I translate from Palladius' Russian version of the Ts'in cheng lu:\n\n\"In the year 1219 Chinghiz moved out at the head of a great host to subjugate the western countries. He spent the summer of 1220 on the river Yerdishi (Irtysh). In autumn he started again and captured all the cities on his way. Thus the army arrived at Otolar (Otrar). Chinghiz left his second and third sons to invest this place, which was soon taken by assault, and in 1221 marched himself, with his fourth son, upon Bu-ha-r (Bokhara). This city was captured, and also Sie-mi-sze-kan (Samarcand). The eldest son of Chinghiz captured the cities of Yang-gi-kan (Yengikand), Ba-r-djin (see note 91) and others. Chinghiz spent the summer in the summer residence of the su-wan-tan (sultan) of the Si-y\u00fc. Subsequently he ordered Hu-tu no-yen to take command of the avant-guard. In autumn of the same year he sent his eldest, second and third sons with the right flank of the army, to attack Yu-lung-kie-chi (Orcandje) and Bu-djin ye-ha-da (probably a misspelt name). Chinghiz' third son was intrusted with the chief command. The emperor himself with the main army marched upon the Iron-gate, captured Tie-r-mi (Termed), destroyed Ban-le-ho (Balkh), and then besieged Ta-li-han (Talecan). In winter, the fourth prince took the cities of Ma-lu-ch'a-ye-k'o (Maruchak), Wu-lu (probably misspelt for Ma-lu, or Meru), Si-la-sze (Serakhs), Ni-sha-u-r (Nishabur) and Ye-li (Heri or Herat).\n\n\"In the spring of 1222, the fourth prince captured T'u-sze (Thus) and Ni-sha-u-r (Nishabur). At the beginning of the hot season he received orders to make haste to join his father; but before doing so, he made an incursion into the country of the Mu-la-di (see note 97), devastated it, crossed the river So-so-lun (see note 98) and sacked Ye-li (Herat). When the fourth prince had joined the emperor, they attacked Ta-li-han in concert. Chinghiz' three eldest sons had at that time taken the city of Yu-lung-kie-chi, and the eldest prince had arrived at his father's camp.\n\n---\n\n119 In the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, the mountains of Altan horhuan are mentioned as the summer residence of the sultan.\n\n120 See note 102. Cutucu, the foster-son of Chinghiz (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 304).\n\n121 The name of Nishabur occurs here for the second time. Indeed according to the Persian authors, this place was twice sacked.\n\n122 According to the Persian authors, Djuchi, the eldest son of Chinghiz, after the quarrel with his brother, did not return to his father; but died in 1225, without having seen Chinghiz khan. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi however,\nThe second and third sons came only after the fortress had been destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile Dja-lan-ding, the su-li-t'an of the Si-y\u00fc had fled. Chinghiz had sent Dje-bie,\u2014who commanded the avant-guard,\u2014in pursuit; and despatched another corps, under Su-bu-t'ai, to assist Dje-bie. T'o-hu-ch'a-r commanded the rear. Dje-bie proceeded to the city of Mie-li k'o-han, but passed without attacking it. Su-bu-tai did the same; but T'o-hu-ch'a-r had a skirmish with the troops outside the city. Mie-li k'o-han was then struck with fear, left the city and fled. Hu-du-hu no-yen went in pursuit; but Mie-li k'o-han succeeded in joining Dja-lan-ding. The latter then attacked Hu-du-hu and defeated him. A courier was despatched to Chinghiz with a report; whereupon Chinghiz, with a corps of \u00e9lite troops left the mountains of Ta-li-han and marched rapidly upon the enemy, pursued him to the river Sin-tze su, made Mie-li k'o-han prisoner, and destroyed his army. Dja-lan-ding escaped, jumped into the river and swam across it. Chinghiz sent a corps under Ba-la no-yen in pursuit of him. Bala was not able to catch the prince, but captured half of the Hindus, and returned.\n\nIn the spring of 1223, Chinghiz moved out with his army and proceeded northward, following the course of the Sin-tze su.\" (Here is a break in the MS.)\n\nThe third prince reached the city of Bu-si-sze-dan (probably Bost in Seyistan is meant;\u2014see D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 298), and asked permission of Chinghiz to attack it, but the emperor recalled his son in view of the hot season commencing. Chinghiz spent the summer with his troops on the river Ba-lu-wan (Peruan), and defeated the enemy in the adjacent countries. After the arrival of the corps of Ba-la, the army moved to the west, (it seems a mistake for east); and when they had reached the fort of Ke-un (see note 107), the third prince also arrived. After Chinghiz had conquered the western countries, he placed a da-lu-hua-ch'i (Mongol governor) in every city.\n\nIn the year 1224, Chinghiz started on his homeward route, and in the spring of 1225 reached his native land, after an absence of seven years.\"\n\nStates, in accordance with the Ts'in cheng lu, that after the fall of Orcandje, Djuchi, Chagatai and Ogotai repaired to the camp of their father.\n\nSee note 113.\n\nI am not able to say what place is meant here by the city of Melik khan. The accounts are somewhat confused, but they may be made consistent by means of the records of the Persian authors.\n\nSin-tze su means the Sind. Su is \"river\" in Mongol.\nExpedition of the Mongol Generals Subutai and Chebe' to Western Persia and the Region of the Caucasus,\n\nA.D. 1220\u20141224.\n\n58. I may again commence with the records of the Mohammedan authors (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 444). We have seen, that in 1220 Chinghiz had sent out two corps under the command of Subutai and Chebe' in pursuit of Mohammed shah. They ravaged Irac Adjem and Mazanderan; and after the miserable end of Mohammed they continued to carry fire and slaughter over Irac Adjem. The cities of Rayi, Kum, Hamadan, Kasvin and Zendjan were sacked. The two generals then advanced on Tebriz, the capital of Azerbaidjan, which province was ruled by the atabeg Euzbeg, a Turkish prince. He bought off the Mongols by rich presents, who then evacuated Azerbaidjan and wintered in the plain of Mogan on the shore of the Caspian. In the beginning of the year 1221 they advanced into Georgia, nearly as far as Tiflis, and defeated the Georgian army. After this they returned to Tebriz, levied a second contribution upon that city, and then attacked Meraga. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Hamadan had killed the Mongol governor placed there; whereupon the Mongol army proceeded to that city, which was taken and destroyed. Returning to the north, the Mongols captured Erdebil, and appeared for the third time at Tebriz. Euzbeg fled to Nakhshivan, and Tebriz again paid ransom. After this the Mongol host was directed against Georgia, and an army of thirty thousand Georgians was destroyed. Having ravaged the latter country, they turned upon Shirvan and captured Shamartha its capital. Rashid, the shah of Shirvan, had taken refuge in the citadel of Derbend. The Mongols had no difficulty in taking the city, but could not capture its citadel. As they intended to cross the Caucasus, they were in need of good leaders; and by means of cunning and force, they obliged the envoys of Rashid to guide them across the mountains. On the other side of the Caucasus they found the Alans or Ases, the Lerguiz, the Circassians and the Kipchaks leagued together against them. A battle was fought, but the victory remained undecided. The Mongols then had recourse to craft, and persuaded the Kipchaks to desert their allies, who were attacked and vanquished. After this the city of Terki was sacked, and the Mongols invaded the land of the Kipchaks, who dispersed without offering any resistance. A great number of them fled to the Russians; and the Mongols took possession of their country consisting of vast steppes, and\nadvanced as far as the rich city of Sudac,\\textsuperscript{126} which was subject to the Kipchaks.\n\nIn 1223 the Mongols undertook an expedition against the Russians, who had made a league with the Kipchaks. The united host of the Russians and Kipchaks marched out to meet the enemy before they had entered the Russian territories. The Mongols employed their usual stratagem; they first retreated, and after having been followed twelve days by the Russians and Kipchaks, lay in ambush and suddenly rushed out upon the enemy. A battle was fought with great slaughter, which continued several days; but finally the Mongols got the victory, the Russians and Kipchaks being utterly defeated.\\textsuperscript{127} After that, the Mongols entered Russia, and carried fire and slaughter over the country.\n\nAt the close of the year 1223, the Mongols evacuated Russia and invaded the land of the Bulgars. The host sent by the latter to repulse the invaders was defeated with great slaughter. The Mongols then took the route by Saccasin\\textsuperscript{128} to join Chinghiz khan.\n\n59. The Russian annals (see Karamzin; vol. iii, pp. 221 sqq.) give of course a more detailed account of the Mongol invasion of Russia than the Mohammedan authors. Russia was at that time divided into several principalities, of which the chief was that of Vladimir, whose grand-duke, to a certain degree, was accepted as feudal lord by the rest. The residence of the grand-duke was first in Kiev; but after 1169 he dwelt in Vladimir. Amongst the Polovtsy (thus the Russian annals term the Kipchaks) who had fled to Russia, there was a prince Kotian (Kutan in the Hungarian annals), who persuaded his son-in-law the prince Mstislav of Galich of the necessity of taking measures against the Mongols. Mstislav then assembled the princes of southern Russia, who agreed to make common cause with the Polovtsy against the Tatars (thus the Mongols are always styled in the ancient Russian annals). The princes of Kiev, Chernigov, Galich (all three had the name Mstislav) and others, having rallied their troops, marched out and first met the Tatars near the river Khortitsa (an affluent of the Dnieper apparently). Having gained the victory, the Russians\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\\textsuperscript{126} Sudac or Soldaya, situated on the south-eastern coast of the Crimea, and on the Khazarian sea (Black sea).\n\\item\\textsuperscript{127} The author of the Kamil ut Tevarikh, from which the above account is borrowed, means evidently the battle at the river Kalka (see further on).\n\\item\\textsuperscript{128} The Persian geographer Bakuy (14th cent.) states, that Saccasin is a large city in the country of the Khazars (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 846). The Russian annals (Karamzin, vol. iii, p. 270) mention a people called Saxiny, who in 1229 first informed the Russians of the approach of the Mongols. The Saxi of Plano Carpini (p. 710) are probably the same.\n\\end{itemize}\ncrossed the Dnieper, and pursued the Mongols nine days to the river Kalka. The prince of Galich with his troops joined the Polovtsy, imprudently crossed the river and engaged the enemy. They were defeated by the Mongols, who then rushed upon the remaining part of the Russian army and completely destroyed it. This is the famous battle of the Kalka, which took place in 1223 or 1224. The Mongols pursued the Russians as far as the Dnieper. Some of the Russian princes, who had been made prisoners were fastened to planks, upon which the Mongols sat to perform a drinking bout.\n\nThe Russian annals mention also some other nations, who had been subdued by the Mongols at the time they crossed the Caucasus, namely the Yasy, the Obezy, the Kassoggy, etc., seven nations in all (Karamzin, vol. iii, pp. 542, 228). By Yasy doubtless the Asi (Ases) or Alans are to be understood (see further on, Part VI). Carpini (p. 709) has Alani sive Asi. The Obezy of the Russian chroniclers are identical with Carpini's Obesi sive Georgiani. But Carpini apparently commits an error in identifying the Obesi with the Georgians; for his Obesi are the same as the Abazi or Akhazai (of the Byzantine authors), a people found at the present day, in the western part of the Caucasus. Comp. Klaproth's Asia Polyglotta, pp. 129, 131. The Kassoggy are the same as the Cherkess, who according to Klaproth (l.c. p. 130) were formerly called Kassakh.\n\n60. Chinese fragmentary accounts of the Mongol expedition under Subutai and Cheb\u00e9 are found in the Yuan shi, in the biographies of two distinguished Mongol generals.\n\nIn the biography of Su-bu-t'ai, already quoted (see note 103) we read (after the pursuit of Mohammed has been recorded):\n\n\"Su-bu-t'ai asked the favour to be allowed to conquer the country of the Kin-ch'a (Kipchak). He conducted his army round the sea K'uan t'ien-gi-sze,\" and arrived at the mountains\n\n---\n\n129 It is strange that the Russian chroniclers are not in accordance with respect to the date of this battle. The annals of Wosnessensk give the 16th of June 1224; the annals of Novgorod, the 31st of May of the same year, as the day when the battle took place. In other Russian annals, the battle is recorded under the year 1223 (Karamzin, vol. iii, p. 545). This latter date would agree with the year the Mohammedan authors give for the first invasion of Russia by the Mongols. The river Kalka (some Russian chroniclers write Kalak) is identified by Karamzin (vol. iii, p. 232) with the river Kalitsa near Mariupol (on the sea of Azov).\n\n130 \u8cb4\u7530\u5409\u601d\u6d77. The characters t'ien-gi-sze here are evidently intended for denghiz; for this was the name applied by the Turks to the Caspian sea (Bibl. Orient., p. 152a). Denghiz means \"sea.\" The character k'uan in Chinese means \"large;\" but we cannot translate here, \"the large sea.\" At least the Chinese scholars, whom I have consulted in regard to this phrase, agree that k'uan forms part of a foreign proper name, and is not\nthrough which an artificial road was cut. On the other side, Su-bu-t'ai met the chiefs (of the Kin-ch'a it seems) named Yu-li-gi and Ta-t'a-har, who had rallied their troops on the river Bu-dzu. The son of Yu-li-gi was wounded by an arrow, and fled into the forest. His slave came (to the Mongols) and betrayed his master. Subsequently all submitted; and after the country of the Kin-ch'a had been conquered, Su-bu-t'ai penetrated as far as the river Ali-gi, where he met the chiefs of the Wa-lo-sze (Russians;\u2014see further on, Part VI), and the great and the little Mi-ch'i-sze-lao. A battle was fought, when the latter were defeated and surrendered; after which Su-bu-t'ai subdued the A-sz (the Asi or Alans), and then returned home, taking with him the slave, who had betrayed his master. When the emperor had heard his story, he said to Su-bu-t'ai,\u2014\u2018We can scarcely expect fidelity from this man,\u2019\u2014and ordered him to be put to death. On the proposal of Su-bu-t'ai, a special corps was formed, consisting of Mie-li-k'i (Merkits), Nai-man and Kin-ch'a (Kipchaks), who accompanied that general on his return home. He proceeded by the way of Ye-mi-li and Ho-dji.\n\nIn the biography of Ho-sze-mai-li,\u2014Yuan shi, chap. cxx (see above, 36),\u2014the Mongol expedition to western Persia and the countries near the Caucasus is also shortly recorded. We read there (after the pursuit of Mohammed shah to Mazanderan has been related):\u2014\u201cThe emperor (Chinghiz) sent Dje-bo (see note 66) to attack the Kin-ch'a (Kipchaks), and Ho-sze-mai-li received orders to be translated. Perhaps there is one character omitted in the Chinese text, and Abgun denghiz was originally intended. Abukun or Abgun was an important port on the Caspian sea, which was known also under the name of the sea of Abukun (D'Ohoson, tom. i, p. 255; and Bibl. Orient. p. 10). The same name Yuan tien-yu-sze for the Caspian, occurs once more in the Yuan shi (see further on, 68).\n\nTai-ho-ling, literally \u201cthe mountains of great peace,\u201d denotes evidently the Caucasus.\n\nAccording to the Russian annals, one of the khans of the Polovtsy (Kipchaks), by name Yury Konchakowitch was killed by the Mongols in 1223 (Karamzin, vol. iii, p. 228).\n\nPerhaps the river Ali-gi denotes the Kalka; for it is certain that the Chinese author, by the great and the little Mi-ch'i-sze-lao, means the princes Mstislav. As we have seen, three princes of this name fought in the battle of the Kalka.\n\nYe-mi-li denotes doubtless the city of Emil or Imil, repeatedly mentioned by the Persian authors. The name has survived in that of a river (near Chugachak). As to the place Ho-dji, I know nothing about it. A city Hu-dji is mentioned in the itinerary of Ye-l\u00fc Hi-liang (see Appendix to this paper) together with Ye-mi-li.\n(from Dje-bo) to march against the \u66f2\u5152\u5f0f K\u016b-r-t'e and \u5931\u5152\u7063\u6c99 Shi-r-wan sha, and to advance upon several cities, summoning them to surrender. Ho-sze-mai-li then proceeded to the country of the \u8c37\u5152\u53ea Gu-r-dji, and marched against another nation called \u963f\u901f A-su (Asi), capturing the city of \u9ed1\u6797 Hei-lin. After this the Wa-lo-sze (Russians) were defeated at \u9435\u5152\u5c71 T'ie-r-shan, and their king \u5bc6\u53ea\u601d\u81d8 Mi-dji-sze-la (Mstislav) was taken prisoner. Dje-bo ordered Ho-sze-mai-li to convey Mi-dji-sze-la to the emperor's (eldest) son Dju-ch'i, who put him to death. Subsequently the \u5eb7\u91cc Kang-li were attacked, the city of \u5b5d\u5b50\u516b\u91cc Bo-tze-ba-li was captured, and the king of this country \u970d\u812b\u601d\u7f55 Ho'to-sze-hand defeated. When the Kin-ch'a (Kipchaks) had been subdued, the (Mongol) army returned and Dje-bo died.\n\nPART V. EXPEDITION OF THE MONGOLS TO THE COUNTRIES NORTH OF THE CASPIAN SEA AND WEST OF THE VOLGA,\n\nA.D. 1285\u20141242.\n\n62. In this chapter, I shall review the invasion of the countries of the Kipchaks, the Asi and the Bulgars, as also the ravaging of Russia, Poland, Silesia and Hungary by the Mongols; comparing, western accounts with the statements of the Chinese and Mongols, as I have done in the previous chapter.\n\nAfter Chinghiz and his generals had ravaged Persia, the countries of the Caucasus and southern Russia, A.D. 1220\u20141224, the warlike enterprises of the Mongols towards the west were stopped for some years; the armies being occupied in the east, with the conquest of the Kin empire, in northern China. In the beginning of 1234, the dynasty of the Kin was overthrown, and Ogotai khan\n\n---\n\n188 Probably the Kurds are meant. The Mohammedan authors report (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 327), that the Turcomans and the Kurds entered the service of the Mongols; and when the latter invaded Georgia, the Turcomans and Kurds formed the avant-guard.\n\n189 Perhaps the shah of Shirvan, who fled to Derbend, is meant (see 58).\n\n190 Gu-r-dji is the Persian name for the Georgians (Bibl. Orient. p. 378).\n\n191 Hei-lin in Chinese, means \"black forest.\" But it may be, that here a foreign name is rendered by Hei-lin. I can give no explanation regarding this place.\n\n192 As shan in Chinese, means \"mountain,\" or \"hill,\" the name may also be read \"the hill of T'ie-r.\" I may observe, that the Mohammedan authors mention a city Terki, north of the Caucasus, sacked by the Mongols at the time spoken of here. On the Catalan map (see Yule's Cathay) a place Terchi on the north-western shore of the Caspian, not far from the mouth of the Edil (Volga), is marked. Astrakhan on the same map is termed Agitarchan.\n\n193 The Kankalis;\u2014see 64, further on.\n(1229\u20141242) then resumed the conquest of the countries in the west, commenced by his father.\n\nThe Tarikh Djihan Kushai states (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 15), that already in 1229, Ogotai had sent an army of thirty thousand men, under the command of the generals Gueuktai and Sunodai (perhaps a clerical error for Subutai), to conquer the countries of the Kipchaks, Saccasius\\(^{141}\\) and Bulgars. This expedition seems to be alluded to in the Russian annals. Karamzin, vol. iii, p. 270, states:\u2014\"After the battle of the Kalka, for six years nothing was heard of the Mongols; but in the year 1229, certain Saxiny, fugitives of the Polovtsy, and some Bulgars posted at the river Yaik, arrived in Bulgaria, bringing the news that the Mongols were again approaching; but they tarried, for it was not till six years later that Baty appeared at the Volga and wintered near the capital of the Bulgars.\"\n\n63. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi says (Palladius' translation, p. 149):\u2014\"The emperor ordered the valiant Subietai to subdue the eleven nations (who were not yet subject to the Mongols), viz the Kanglin, the Kibcha, the Ubaljuji, the Ulusu, the Madjar, the Asu, the Siezu, the Sierkesu, Keshinir, Bular and Lala,\u2014to cross the two rivers Djayakh and Idil, and to march directly upon the cities Kiwanien and Kernien.\"\n\nThese eleven nations, and the cities against which Subietai directed his host, are twice more mentioned in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi (Pall. transl., pp. 152, 155) with some variations in the spelling of the names. There appear also two new names, Miegie or Meketneng and Kelie. I will try to identify these names as far as my acquaintance with the medi\u00e6val geography of the regions here spoken of may enable me.\n\n64. The Kanglin of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, are without doubt the same as the Kankalis, or Kankly of the Mohammedan authors. According to Rashid-eddin (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 197), this people dwelt\u2014at the beginning of the 13th century\u2014on the steppes north of the sea of Khorazm (Aral), and north-east of the Caspian sea. The Kipchaks were their western neighbours.\n\nPlano Carpini, after having quitted the country of the Comani (same as the Kipchaks;\u2014see further on, Part VI), entered the deserts of the Cangitae, by which name he means the Kankalis; page 749:\u2014\"Post hoc terram intravimus Cangitarum qua magnum habet in pluribus locis penuriam aquarum; in qua etiam homines pauci morantur propter aqu\u00e6 defectum. . . . . . . Et tam Comani quam Cangitae non laborant, sed tantum de animalibus vivebant; nec \u00e6dificabant domos, sed in tabernaculis habitabant.\n\n\\(^{141}\\) See note 128.\nIstos etiam Tartari deleverunt, et habitant in terram ipsorum; et illi qui remanserunt redacti sunt in servitutem eorum.\"\n\nRubruquis terms the same people Cangle; p. 265:\u2014\"Quidam Comani qui dicebantur Cangle;\" and p. 274:\u2014\"Cangle, quaedam parentela Comanorum.\"148\n\nIn the Chinese historical works of the Mongol period, the Kankalis are repeatedly spoken of, but the information the Chinese authors give about this people is very meagre. The name is generally spelt there \u5eb7\u91cc K'ang-li or \u5eb7\u5fb7 K'ang-li,\u2014sometimes also \u9102\u91cc Hang-li. The K'ang-li were known to the Kin, as early as the 12th century (see above, 31), a khan of that nation being desirous of becoming a vassal of the Kin emperor. In the Yuan shi the name K'ang-li occurs repeatedly, and especially in the biographies. As they were a warlike nation, the Mongol khans used to place them in their army, and many brave generals of the Mongol empire belonged to the K'ang-li.\n\n\u4e0d\u5ffd\u6728 Bu-hu-mu, whose biography is found in chap. cxxx of the Yuan shi, was a K'ang-li. It is stated there, that this nation derived its origin from the \u9ad8\u8eca K'ao-ku, a people mentioned in the \"History of the Han.\" Bu-hu-mu's son \u8499\u53e4 K'ui-k'ui has a separate biography,\u2014in chap. cxliii.\n\nIn chap. cxxxvi, we find the biography of \u963f\u6c99\u4e0d\u82b1 A-sha-bu-hua, who was a prince of the reigning family of the K'ang-li. The armies of Chinghiz had ravaged the country of the K'ang-li. When the king died, he left a widow, belonging to the tribe of \u82e6\u6ec5\u53e4\u9ebb\u91cc Shan-mie gu-ma-li; and owing to the ruined state of her affairs, she was for a long time unable to leave her country (she was evidently desirous to proceed to the Mongol court). Subsequently however, through some miraculous agency, she was surprised on one occasion by the appearance of some richly laden camels. Consequent on this, she set out with her two sons \u66f2\u5f8b K'u-l\u00fc and \u7259\u7259 Ya-ya for the residence of the emperor; and after two years returned home, leaving her sons with Ogotai. Thirteen years later she again proceeded to the court of\n\n---\n\n148 The Kankalis and the Kipchaks, or Comans, belonged indeed to the same race (Turks).\n\n149 The character \u9102 is also read ch\u00e9. The German orientalist Hammer, who was scarcely aware of the Chinese form of the name here translated, also identifies the Kao-ch\u00e9 with the Kankalis (Ritter's Asia, vol. v, p. 595). Kao-ch\u00e9 in Chinese means \"high cart;\" and in the \"History of the Wei\" (in the 5th century of our era), the name of this people is explained by the high wheels they used to put on their carts. Hammer was probably led to his identification by a statement of Rashid-eddin (Berezin, l. c. vol. i, p. 18), that kankly in Turkish means \"a cart,\" and that this name was applied to these people because they had first invented carts.\nMengu khan at \u548c\u6797 Ho-lin (Karakorum), to see her sons. A-sha-bu-hua, in whose biography these details are found, was the grandson of this lady, and the son of Ya-ya. A-sha-bu-hua who was a general in Kubilai khan's service, died in 1301. His brother T'o-to was also a distinguished officer in Kubilai's life-guard. He had the title of \u96f2\u4e2d\u738b Y\u00fcn-chung wang. T'o-to's son T'ie-mu-r-ta was minister under the last Mongol emperor Shun-ti. See his biography in chap. cxl. Ya-ya had also a son \u97d3\u79c3\u883b Wa-lo-man (Othman).\n\nBesides this, the name of K'ang-li appears in the biographies of the following distinguished personages, natives of that country:\n\nChap. cxxiii: \u827e\u8c8c Ai-mo, belonged to the tribe \u62d4\u90fd\u5eb7\u91cc Ba-du K'ang-li. He accompanied Su-bu-t'ai no-yen, when the latter waged war in the country of the K'in-cha (Kipchaks). His son \u4e5f\u901f\u53f0\u5152 Ye-su-t'ai-r distinguished himself at the conquest of the Chinese province of Fukien, and at the expedition to Ji-pen (Japan), and died in 1288.\n\nChap. cxxxiii: Ye-su-de-r, the son of Ai-bo Bo-ya-wu.\n\nChap. cxxxiv: T'u-hu-lu,\u2014in the service of Kubilai, was the ninth son of A-li-tu-shi, who was a grandson of the K'ang-li prince I-na.\n\nIn the same chapter is the biography of \u97d3\u7f85\u601d Wa-lo-sze, who was the secretary of Kubilai khan's successor. His father Ming-li T'ie-mu-r had held the same office under Kubilai; and his grandfather Hai-du had served in Mangu khan's army. His great-grandfather \u54c8\u5931\u4f2f\u8981 Ha-shi Bo-yao had surrendered in early times to the Mongols (probably when Chinghiz conquered western Asia), and had been appointed superintendent of the herds belonging to Kubilai khan's mother. Wa-lo-sze's son K'ing-t'ung, who served under the last Mongol emperor Shun-ti, has a separate biography,\u2014in chap. cxlii. Thus the Kankali Ha-shi Bo-yao and his descendants held office in the Mongol empire from the beginning to the end.\n\nChap. cxxxv: T'a-li-ch'i,\u2014served under Kubilai; his father\n\n---\n\n144 Archimandrite Palladius states (Record of Eccles. Miss. vol. iv, p. 249), that her adventures have furnished the material for a Chinese drama.\n\n145 The name of this man is rendered by the same Chinese characters which in the Yuan shi generally represent Russia.\n\n146 The two characters Bo-yao are perhaps intended for Bayaut. This was, according to the Mohammedan authors (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 197), the name of a branch of the Kankalis, to which Turkan khatun, the mother of Mohammed shah of Khorazm belonged. There were a great number of Kankalis in Khovaresm when the Mongols first invaded the country. The above-mentioned Ai-bo Bo-ya-wu was probably also a Bayaut.\nYe-li li-hu having surrendered to Chinghiz. *Ibid*: Ming-an,\u2014was also a Kankali in Kubilai's service.\n\nFinally, in chap. ccv, is the biography of \u5584\u99ac Ha-ma, placed under the rubric of \"Villanous officers.\"\n\nMr. Schott, the well-known sinologue, in an article published in 1844, in the *Abhandl.d.kgl. Akad.d. Wissensch.* of Berlin, tries to identify the Kankali with the \u5eb7\u5c45 K'ang-k\u00fc of the Han dynasty, and the Kanggar of the Byzantine authors of the 10th and 11th centuries. As to the latter identification he may be right; but in regard to K'ang-k\u00fc there is no evidence but some similarity of sound. In the \"History of the T'ang,\" chap. cclviii b, article \"K'ang\" or \"K'ang-k\u00fc,\" we read that this country is also called \u8607\u672b\u97ac Su-mo-gien, and the kingdom mentioned in the itinerary of Hiuan-tsang under the name of Sa-mo-kien is without doubt Samarcan (Julien's *M\u00e9m. s. l. Contr\u00e9es Occid.* tom. i, p. 18).\n\n65. As regards the other countries, cities and rivers, enumerated in the above-quoted passages of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, I may offer the following elucidations.\n\n*Kibcha* denotes Kipchak. Of this people more detailed accounts will be given in Part VI.\n\n*Ubudjigi* seems to be intended for Abkhazi; see above, 59.\n\nThe Ulusu (Orusze) of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi are the Russians.\n\nThe Asu (the name is sometimes written Asut, which is the Mougol plural of Asu) are the Asi or Alans of western medieval authors.\n\nThe Muljar are the Magyars or Hungarians.\n\nThe Sierkesu are the Cherkess.\n\nThe Bular (the name is written also Pular and Pularman) are the Bulgars.\n\nThe Siosu (termed also Sasu) are probably the Saxiny or Saxi (see note 128), or perhaps the Sassans of the Mohammedan authors;\u2014the Saxon colonies in Transylvania (see further on, note 172).\n\nThe name Keshimir occurs also among the names of countries, with the conquest of which Subutai had been intrusted. The celebrated Cashmir lay far out of his way; and according to the Yuan shi, it was only in 1253 that a Mongol corps was sent to that country. I may however mention, that Plano Carpini,\u2014whose information was gathered in 1247,\u2014in enumerating the countries conquered by the Mongols, has noticed Casmir in his list (*l.c.* p. 708).\n\nWe meet further the name Lula among the eleven nations or countries mentioned in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi. This name is replaced by Kelie, where the list is given for the second time (*l.c.* p. 152). It seems to me that by Kelie, the Kelur of the Mohammedan authors is intended. Thus they term the king of Hungary,\nas we shall see further on. By a misunderstanding, the chronicler of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi may have taken Kelar for the name of a country. Sometimes Rashid also takes Kelar for a country. Compare Prof. Berezin's transl. vol. ii, p. 74:\u2014\"Ogotai khan conquered Khatai and the countries of Kelar, Bashkurt, Pula, Deht Kipchak, Russ, Cherkes, As, etc.\" Again, l. c. vol. i, pp. 2, 51, Kelar appears as the name of a country, and Rashid always associates it with Bashkurt, by which name properly the Bashkirs are meant; but the same author applies this name to the Hungarians also (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 621). I cannot therefore agree with Prof. Berezin, who suggests that Kelar may have been a country near the Ural.\n\nThe Yuan ch'ao pi shi mentions two rivers which Subutai had been ordered to cross, viz. the Djayakh and Idil. The Djayakh is the Ural of our day, which discharges into the Caspian sea. It is mentioned by Zemarchus (6th cent.) under the name of Duich (Yule's Cathy, p. clxvi), and is called G\u00ebech by Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Carpini (p. 743) styles the river Jaec.\u2014Rubruquis (p. 274), Jagac; Haithon also writes Jaic; the Catalan map terms it Jayech. Idil or Atel was the medi\u00e6val name for the Volga. It is known that the ancients called this river Rha (Amianus Marcellinus, 4th cent.) or Ra potamos (Ptolemy). Atel or Idil is not a proper name, but means \"river\" in the Turkish dialects (Klaproth, M\u00e9m. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, p. 374). The Mohammedan authors write Atil; Rubruquis (p. 258) calls the Volga Etilia. Carpini (p. 743) gives also the name Volga:\u2014\"tercium Volga, istud flumen est vald\u00e8 magnum, super quod vedit Bati.\" The Catalan map terms the river Edil. There was also a city Athel on the Volga, in the 10th century, and the capital of the Khazars, according to Massudi (Klaproth, Magazin Asiatique, tom. i, pp. 266, 276).\n\nIt remains to identify the three cities mentioned in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi in connection with Subutai's expedition. Miegie (the name is also spelt\u2014erroneously it seems,\u2014Meketmeng) is probably identical with the city of Mie-k'ie-sze or Mai-k'o-sze, mentioned in the Yuan shi, among the cities north of the Caucasus captured by Mangu khan (see further on, 71).\n\nBy Kiwanien (the name is also written Keibie and Kiwa; the latter reading seems to be preferable) evidently the city of Kiev, the capital of Russia up to the year 1169, is meant. Kiev was taken by the Mongols in 1240. On the Catalan map, Kiev is styled Chiva.\n\nI am not prepared to say what place is intended by Kermien; the name is written also Kerman.\n\n66. According to the Tarikh Djihan Kushai and the Djam\u0131 ut\nTevarikh (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 619 sqq), it was resolved at the second kuriltai convoked under the reign of Ogotai, that a vast army should be raised in order to subdue the countries of the Asi, Bulgars, Kipchaks and Russians, all bordering upon the territories allotted to Batu, the son of Chinghiz' eldest son Djuchi. Ogotai designated the following princes to assist Batu in the command: Kuyuk and Kudan, sons of Ogotai; Mangu and Budjec, sons of Tulei; Buri and Baidar, sons of Chagatai; Kulkan, brother of Ogotai; and Orda, Tangut and Shiban, brothers of Batu. The renowned general Subutai bahadur took part also in this expedition, which was set in motion in February, 1236.\n\nA. BEGINNING OF THE CAMPAIGN. INVASION OF THE COUNTRY OF THE ASI AND THE BULGARS, A.D. 1236\u20141237.\n\n67. The Mohammedan authors report (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 619 sqq), that after having marched during the whole summer, the Mongol army arrived in autumn at the ordo of the sons of Djuchi, in the neighbourhood of the realm of the Bulgars, at the river... (the name is illegible in the Persian MS. probably the Volga is meant). In the winter of 1236\u20141237, the Mongol princes detached Subutai bahadur to invade the country of the Asi and the Bulgars. This general proceeded to the city of... (the name is illegible in Rashid's record, but the Tarikh Djihan Kushai states, that in this campaign the celebrated city of Bulgar was first captured, and its inhabitants massacred or dragged away in slavery). Rashid mentions two chiefs,\u2014apparently Bulgarian,\u2014Bayan(?) and Chiku(?), who came in person to render homage to the princes, and\n\n---\n\n147 The Mohammedan authors call him always Batu. In the Yuan shi his name is written \u62d4\u90fd Ba-du;\u2014in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, Batu. To the Russian chroniclers, the conqueror of Russia is known under the name of Baty. Carpini also writes Baty.\n\n148 \u8cb4\u7531 Gai-yu and \u5408\u4e39 Ho-dan in the Yuan shi, chap. cvii, Geneal. tables. Kuyuk was afterwards elected Mongol emperor (1246-1248). Kadan is also called Kadan Ogul by Rashid (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 99).\n\n149 \u8499\u54e5 Meng-k'o in the Yuan shi. Mangu was afterwards Mongol emperor, 1251\u20141259. Budjie is termed \u64ad\u7d50 Bu-ch'o in the Yuan shi, and Budjec by Carpini, p. 667.\n\n150 Buri is mentioned in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi (see further on, 81).\n\n151 \u845b\u5217\u5805 K'uo-tie-kien in the Yuan shi, chap. cvii, Geneal. tables. Kulkan was killed in Russia (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 625).\n\n152 Orda is termed \u97d3\u9b6f\u6735 Wa-tu-do in the Yuan shi. He is mentioned in the Annals of that work sub anno 1236, together with his brother Ba-du. Shiban's name (\u6614\u73ed Si-ban) is met in Subutai's biography;\u2014see further on, 80.\nwere then released; but they afterwards revolted, and Subutai was sent again to subdue them.\n\nThe Russian annals state (Karamzin, vol. iii, p. 270), that Baty wintered near the Volga in 1236\u20141237, not far from the capital of the Bulgars, which was destroyed in the autumn of 1237.\n\nThe Y\u00fcan shi says nothing about the invasion of Bulgaria. In the biography of Subutai, where all the military doings of this famous general are related, no mention is made of Bulgar. But on an ancient Chinese map of the 14th century (see Part VI of this paper), \u4e0d\u91cc\u963f\u5152 Bu-li-a-r is marked to the east of Russia.\n\nB. EXPEDITION AGAINST THE KIPCHAKS, BOKSHAS AND BURTASSES, A.D. 1237.\n\n68. Rashid says (l.c. tom. ii, p. 623):\u2014\"The Mongol princes after deliberation, determined to extend their army and to proceed in a vast line, as is generally done at a battue. Mangu, who commanded the left flank near the (Caspian) sea, captured Bachman, one of the most valiant chiefs of the Kipchaks, who belonged to the tribe of Olerlik, (?) and Kachar Ogola, who belonged to the people of . . . (probably Asi). Bachman, who had for a long time evaded his pursuers, had collected a troop of robbers and fugitives, and was a constant source of trouble to the Mongols, sometimes carrying off considerable booty from them. As he frequently changed his abode, and hid himself in the forests bordering on the river Atil (Volga), it was difficult to catch him. Mangu gave orders to prepare a squadron of two hundred boats, and to put a hundred men in each boat. The prince himself with one part of the squadron, went along one bank of the river, beating the adjacent forests; whilst his brother Budjek, with the rest of the boats, ransacked the opposite bank. At one place the Mongols found vestiges of a recently abandoned encampment, and an old woman informed them that Bachman had retired to an island. As they had no boats near that place, they were unable to pursue Bachman, when suddenly a high wind arose, causing the water to go down. The Mongol troops forded the river, and he was taken a l'improviste; his men being either drowned or killed. The Mongols returned with a large booty, without having lost a single man. Bachman solicited the favour to be killed by Mangu's own hand; but this prince ordered his brother Budjec to cut the Kipchak chief through the middle; and Kachar Ogola, the chief of the Ases was also killed. The Mongol princes passed the summer of 1237 in that country. In the same year Batu, Orda, Barkai, Kadan, Buri and Kulkan attacked the Bokshas and the Burtasses.\"\n\nBy Bokshas we have probably to understand the Mokshas. This is\nThe Yuan shi also reports the capture of Bachman. In the records of the emperor Mangu, in chap. iii we read:\n\n\"In the 3rd month of 1237, Meng-k'o invaded \u91d1\u5bdf Kin-ch'a (Kipchak), and approached the sea called \u5bec\u7530\u5409\u601d H'uan-t'ien-yi-sze (the Caspian sea;\u2014see note 130). The chief of the Kin-ch'a, named \u516b\u8d64\u883b Ba-ch'i-man fled with his family to an island in the sea. Meng-k'o, when informed of this fact, proceeded immediately with his troops to capture him. Happily a strong wind arose, which caused the water to fall, so that it could be forded; and Meng-k'o said\u2014\"Heaven opens up my way.\" Ba-ch'i-man's troops were massacred, and he was made prisoner. Meng-k'o ordered him to kneel down; but he replied\u2014\"I have been myself a king, and do not fear death; I am not a camel, that I should kneel.\"\n\nAfter this he put the Mongols in mind of the rising of the flood, and advised them to think of returning; and indeed part of the troops were obliged to reach the opposite shore by swimming. In the biography of Subutai (Yuan shi, chap. cxxi) the same story is reported, and there the merit of the seizure of Ba-ch'i-man is attributed to this general.\n\nC. Invasion of Northern Russia, A.D. 1237\u20141238.\n\n69, I may begin with the accounts found in the Russian annals, which of course give the fullest information regarding these events. Compare Karamzin, vol. iii, pp. 272 sqq. The following are the chief events found in the Russian records regarding the second Mongol invasion.\n\nAfter the city of Bulgar had been destroyed, the Mongols appeared, towards the end of 1237, on the frontiers of Russia, then bounded on the east by Bulgaria. The cities of Pronsk, Blugarod and Ijestuivets were captured, and they arrived at Riazan, where the prince Yury (George) had shut himself up. This prince was not able to resist the Mongol arms; Riazan was taken by assault on December 21st, 1237, when there was a general massacre of the inhabitants, in which the prince Yury with his family perished. The city of Kolomna, defended by Yury's brother Romun, shared the same fate as Riazan. Vladimir the son of the grand-duke Yury of Vladimir had been intrusted with the defence of Moscow; but he was also defeated by the Mongols and made prisoner. The grand-duke Yury now becoming alarmed, left Vladimir, and posted his army on the banks of the Siti (an affluent of the Mologa). He determined to wait there for auxiliary troops promised by his brothers Yaroslav of Kiev and Sviatoslav; his\n\neven now the name of a people of Finnish race near the Volga. The Bur-tasses are probably identical with the Mordvins, living also on the Volga.\nsons Vsevolod and Mstislav having been left meantime to defend the capital Vladimir. On the 2nd of February, 1238, the Mongols invested Vladimir; and led on by the prince, they summoned the city to surrender. One Mongol detachment had been sent to Suzdal; and after having sacked this place, joined the main army at Vladimir. On the 8th of February the city surrendered, and according to the Mongol custom, the inhabitants were put to the sword; the whole family of the grand-duke having perished on the occasion. After this the Mongol troops were divided into several corps, which moved about in different directions, sacking the cities and ravaging the country. Thus in February, 1238, the cities of Voljsky, Gorodets, Kostromskoi Galich, Pereslav, Rostoff, Yaroslav, Yurieff and Dimitroff were plundered or destroyed. The grand-duke Yury, still on the river Siti awaiting succour from his brothers, was attacked by the Mongols on the 4th of March, and killed with most of his troops. Another Mongol corps had turned towards Novgorod, and after having taken Volok Lamsky and Tver they invested Torjok, which city surrendered on the 5th of March, after a siege of two weeks. When Baty had arrived at a distance of a hundred versts from the rich city of Novgorod, he suddenly marched back (the reason of his return is unknown), and directed his host against Kozelsk (in the province of Kaluga). This insignificant city was able to resist the Mongols for seven weeks, owing to the heroism of its inhabitants. Finally they were obliged to surrender, and suffered the common fate of those who opposed the Mongols. The Russian chroniclers report, that Baty, after having massacred all the inhabitants of the city, named it \"the bad city.\" After this the Mongols returned to the country of the Polovtsy (Kipchaks); and Yaroslav prince of Kiev, the brother of Yury, who had been killed in the battle on the Siti, went to Vladimir and was proclaimed grand-duke.\n\n70. The above-related invasion of Russia by the Mongols is spoken of in the following terms in the Tarikh Djihan Kushai (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 619):\n\n\"After the city of Bulgar had been taken, the Mongol armies invaded Russia, and conquered that country as far as the city of Mocoss; the inhabitants of which were numerous as ants and locusts. The army was obliged to pass through vast forests, so dense that not even a serpent could penetrate them. The Mongol princes therefore ordered roads to be cut across, wide enough for three carts to pass abreast. Catapults were set up to demolish the wall of Mocoss; and after a siege of several days the place surrendered, when immense booty was taken. Orders were given to\n\n---\n\nProbably he named it mao balik, as the Mongols\u2014according to Rashid\u2014called a bad city (\"mauvaise ville;\"\u2014D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 430).\ncut off the right ears of all the corpses; and thus it was found that\nthe number slain amounted to two hundred and seventy thou-\nsand.\"155\n\nRashid-eddin gives a more detailed account of this expedition;\nbut it is to be regretted, that the names of the greater number of the\nplaces mentioned in Russia cannot be ascertained, owing to the\nwant of diacritical marks in the Persian text. He says:\u2014\n\"In the autumn of 1237, the Mongol princes marched all together\nagainst the Russians. Kuyuk, Mangu, Kulkan, Kadan and Buri\nbesieged the city of Ban, (?) and took it after three days. They\nthen stormed the city of Iga, (?)\u2014where Kulkan was mortally\nwounded;\u2014and defeated and killed Urman (the prince Roman of\nKolomna) one of the chiefs of the Russians. The city of . . . . was\ncaptured after a siege of five days (probably Moscow is meant) and\nthe emir Ula-timur (Vladimir, who defended Moscow) killed.\nIt took eight days to capture the city of the great Yurki (Yurki\nbusurgh;\u2014probably Vladimir the capital of the grand-duke Yury\nor George). The city of K...r Nikla (illegible;\u2014D'Ohsson has\nSt. Nicolas), the capital of the country of . . . . (illegible;\u2014D'Ohsson\nhas Venceslav) was taken after only five days' siege. The sove-\nreign of this country, the great Yurki, who had hidden himself in\nthe forests, was made prisoner and executed.\"156 The Mongol prin-\nces now held a kuriltai, where it was determined to proceed to the\ninterior of Russia by different routes; and the Mongols took all the\ncities and fortresses they met with on their way. Batu besieged\nthe city of Kil Acaska for two months157 without success; but\nwhen he had been joined by the princes Kadan and Buri, the city\nwas taken by assault in three days. After this the princes can-\ntoned their troops and took rest for some time.\"\n\nThe information found in the Yuan shi with respect to the\nsecond invasion of Russia is very meagre. In the records of the\nemperor Meng-k'o (chap. iii) it is stated, that after Ba-ch'i-man,\nchief of the Kin-ch'a, had been killed (see above, 68), Meng-k'o\naccompanied Batu in the expedition against the Wa-lo-\nsze (Russians).

He may be right; I would\nhowever observe, that Moscow at the time spoken of was not a large and pop-\nulous city. It had been founded in 1147 by the grand-duke Yury Dolgo-\nruky, but was destroyed in 1176 by a prince of Riazan.\n\n156 There is some confusion in these accounts regarding the names.\n\n157 It seems Kozelsk is meant; which place, according to the Russian\nannals, resisted for seven weeks.\n\n158 It seems that by Ye-lie-dsan, Riazan is meant; and I suppose that\nby a mistake the character ye has been connected with the name; for Lie-\ndsan would be just the proper Chinese spelling of the name Riazan.\nhe fought in person, and it was due to his bravery that the city was taken.\n\nD. Expedition to the Regions of the Caucasus,\nA.D. 1238\u20141239.\n\n71. Rashid reports, that \"in the autumn of 1238...and Kadan marched against the Circasses, and in winter killed their prince Tu-kan. (?) Shiban, Budjec and Buri made an incursion upon the country of the Merins, a portion of the nation called Chinehak. Barkai defeated the Kipchaks and made the chief of the Mekrits prisoner.\n\n\"In the winter of 1238\u20141239,... (probably Mangu's name is to be supplied) with Buri and Kadan invested the city of Mangass (the name may be read also Mikees), which was taken after six weeks' siege. In the spring of 1239, Kukdai was sent to capture Timur kahalia (lit. \"the Iron gate;\" Derbend on the Caspian sea is meant), and to take possession of the adjacent countries.\"\n\nA corroboration of the above-mentioned account of the siege of Mangass or Mikees seems to be given in the Yuan shi. In the Annals, sub anno 1239, we read:\u2014\"Meng-k'o (Mangu) invested the city A-su Mie-k'ie-sze and took it after three months' siege.\" It appears to me that by A-su Mie-k'ie-sze is to be understood Mie-k'ie-sze, a city of the Asi (Asi or Alans). The same name, or nearly the same, occurs several times in the Yuan shi. Thus in chap. cxxii, in the biography of Si-li gan-bu (a Mongol general of Tangut extraction, who took part in the western expeditions under Batu), it is stated, that in 1239, in the 11th month, the city of A-su Mie-k'ie-sze was reached by the army. It was well fortified and difficult to storm. In the spring of 1240 however, Si-li gan-bu conducted an assault, which was successful, and the city was taken. In chap. cxxxii,\u2014biography of Ba-du-r,\u2014the storming of a city Mai-k'o-sze by Meng-k'o is related. A similar name of a city, Mai-k'o-sze is also mentioned in chap. cxxviii, in the biography of the Kipchak prince T'uf-tu-ha. We have seen, that the name of a city Mie-gie appears also in the Yian ch'ao pi shi (see above, 63). I have little doubt that the Mie-k'ie-sze or Mai-k'o-sze of the Yuan shi, and the Miegie of the Mongol annals, are identical with the Mikees of Rashid; but as to the position of this place I can give no information. I may however quote a statement of Professor Grigorief (Russian Oriental Record, vol. i, p. 64), mentioning a city Mokhshi or Mokhshi in the dominions of the khans of the Golden Horde. This may perhaps be the Mie-k'ie-sze of the Chinese authors. But Professor Grigorief says, that the existence of that city is known only from some ancient coins struck there.\nE. The ravaging of Southern Russia by the Mongols,\nA.D. 1240.\n\n72. I may again begin with the accounts drawn from the Russian annals (Karamzin, vol. iv, pp. 6 sqq).\n\nThe grand-duke Yury of Vladimir and his sons had all perished by the sword of the Mongols; and after the latter had retired, Yaroslav of Kiev, the brother of Yury, took possession of the throne of Vladimir, ceding Kiev to Michael of Chernigov. Baty, after having reduced the Polovtsy, again invaded Russia, ravaged the country of the Mordvins, plundered Murom and Gorokovets, and threatened the grand-dukedom of Vladimir; but suddenly he turned his host southward to the rich countries of southern Russia, and destroyed Pereslav. One corps of the Mongol army was directed against Chernigov; which city, defended by the valiant prince Mstislav Glebovich, the cousin of Michael of Kiev, was taken by assault and destroyed. Mstislav however succeeded in making his escape to Hungary.\n\nAfter this the Mongols proceeded to Kiev, which Mengu khan had previously reconnoitred. He had advanced as far as the city of Piassochny on the Dnieper, and was much delighted on getting sight of the magnificent city of Kiev, where his envoys had been killed. When the Mongols approached, Michael fled to Hungary, and the boyar Dmitry took upon himself the defence of the city; while Baty arriving with his immense host, invested it on all sides.\n\nI may here give the translation of a passage of the contemporary Russian annals of Woskressensk (Karamzin, vol. iv, p. 285), referring to the siege of Kiev:\n\n\"Like dense clouds the Tatars pushed themselves forward towards Kiev, investing the city on all sides. The rattling of their innumerable carts, the bellowing of camels and cattle, the neighing of horses, and the wild battle cry were so overwhelming as to render inaudible the conversation of the people inside the city. A Tatar named Taurul had been captured, and he reported that Baty himself was before Kiev;\u2014that his brothers (relations) were all valiant captains; Urdiu (Orda, brother of Batu), Baidar (son of Chagatai), Biriu (Buri, also a son of Chagatai), Kadan (son of Ogotai), Bechak (Budjek;\u2014see note 149), Mengu (son of Tulei) and Kuyuk (Kuyuk, son of Ogotai). When the news of the khan's (Ogotai's) death reached Kuyuk, he returned and became himself khan.\" There was also Sebediai bogatyr,\u2014who did\n\n---\n\n188 The Mongols are always termed Tatars in the Russian annals, as well as by the Hungarian and other western chroniclers. The name Mongol was little known at that time in the west.\n\n189 The latter statement must have been added a few years later; for the\nnot belong to the khan's relatives, but who was considered his first general,\u2014and another by name Burundai. These two had conquered the whole country of Bulgar and Suzdal.\"161\n\nNotwithstanding the stout resistance of the Russians, Kiev was finally taken by assault and destroyed; the brave Dmitry was made prisoner. Batu spared his life, but took him along with him. Dmitry is said to have subsequently persuaded Batu to leave Russia and invade the rich country of Hungary; but before proceeding thither, Batu sacked and plundered the cities of Vladimir in Volhynia, Galich, Ladyjin (in Podolia) and Kamenets. At Kremnits however the Mongols suffered a defeat.\n\n73. The account given by Rashid-eddin of the invasion of southern Russia in 1240, is very confused, and some of the proper names cannot be pronounced. The Persian historian states (l. c. tom. ii, p. 627):\u2014\n\n\"After the princes Kuyuk and Mangu had left the army in the autumn of 1239, the prince Batu with his brothers, and the princes Kadan, Buri and Buchek, marched against the Rusians and the Karakalpaks (black caps). In nine days they took the great Russian city of Mingerkhan, (?) and after this all the cities of Vladimir (Vladimir). After having ravaged the land to a great extent, and sacked all the cities on their way, they invested the city of Uch-ogul Vladimir (in Turkish\u2014\"the three sons of Vladimir\") with their united forces, and captured it in three days.\"\n\nSiege of Kiev took place in 1240, but Ogotai died only at the end of 1241, and Kuyuk was elected khan in 1246 (Chinese annals). There are some discrepancies between the statements of western and eastern authors, as to the date when Kuyuk was recalled by his father, and also respecting the time when Ogotai died. Rashid states (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 118):\u2014\"The princes Kuyuk and Mangu, having received orders from the emperor Ogotai to return, left the army in the autumn of 1239. When they arrived in Tartary, Ogotai had already departed this life.\" But this does not agree with the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, which reports, with many details, Kuyuk's reception by his father, when he had arrived from the west (see further on, 81). According to the Annals of the Yuan shi, in 1240 Kuyuk was still with the army in the west. We read there under this year:\u2014\"The prince Gu-yu had conquered the countries in the west; but there were still some nations who resisted, and he dispatched a courier with a report.\" D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 155, quotes a passage from Roger's Miserabile carmen, in which it is stated that the Tatars suddenly left Hungary, owing to the arrival of a courier bringing the news of the great khan's death. The precise date of the arrival of the courier is not given, but it may be concluded that it happened in the winter of 1241\u20141242. This agrees with the Chinese annals.\n\n161 Sebediai bogatyr is Subutai bahadur, repeatedly spoken of in this paper. I cannot understand why Karamzin will have the name Sebediai to be read Suda\u00ef, and changes Burundai into Bustyr (l. c. vol. iii, p. 11). Burundai of the Russian chroniclers is doubtless the general Buruldai of Rashid's record, who distinguished himself in Poland and Hungary (see further on, 75).\nAs to the Chinese accounts of these events, they are also meagre and unintelligible. In the biography of Subutai, in the Yuan shi it is stated, that in the year 1241, the emperor Ogotai ordered Batu and the other princes to attack Ye-li-ban, king of the Wu-lu-sze (Russians). They then proceeded to invest the city of T'u-li-sze-k'o, which for a long time could not be taken; but when Ye-li-ban had been made prisoner, the city was taken by assault. After this the Russians all surrendered and the army returned.\n\nF. EXPEDITION OF THE MONGOLS TO POLAND, SILESIA, AND MORAVIA, A.D. 1240\u20141241.\n\n74. The following outline of this expedition is drawn from D'Ohsson, who quotes Polish and other European annals (tom. ii, pp. 120 sqq.). After the death of Boleslaus III, in 1139, Poland was divided among his four sons; and when the Mongols proceeded from Russia westward, they found there four realms.\n\nBoleslaus IV, pudicus, reigned over Krakow and Sandomir. Conrad ruled Mazovia and Kuyavia; his residence being in Polotsk. Henry II possessed lower Silesia and the provinces of Gnesen, Posnania and Kalish; residing himself in Vratislav or Breslau. The dukedoms of Oppeln and Ratibor belonged to Miecislav.\n\nThe Tartars first appeared in Poland in the year 1240, plundered the province of Lublin, and then retired to Galicia. The next winter, 1240\u20141241, they crossed the Vistula on the ice, ravaged Sandomir, advanced to within seven miles of Krakow and returned again to Galicia. Vladimir, palatine of Krakow, went in pursuit, and succeeded in rescuing the prisoners and recovering a part of the booty that had been taken; but after a short time the Mongols reappeared, devastating Sandomir, Lencisc and Kuyavia. The Polish army endeavoured to oppose them, but was defeated near Szydlow, on March 18th, 1241. Boleslaus and all the nobles fled to Moravia, Hungary and Germany; and when the Mongols arrived at Krakow, they found it deserted.\n\nAfter this the Mongols entered Silesia; and as the bridges over the Oder had been burnt, they crossed the river at Bativor, swimming, or on extemporized bridges. Miecislav retired to Lignitz, where his cousin Henry rallied an army. The Mongols marched first\n\n---\n\n160 The date 1241 is a mistake for 1240; for the events reported in the biography under the year 1241, are placed there before the expedition to Hungary, which as is well ascertained, took place in 1241.\n\n162 I can give no explanation about the king Ye-li-ban and the city of T'u-li-sze-k'o.\nupon Breslau, the city having been burnt by the inhabitants, who had shut themselves up in the citadel. The Mongol army did not stay there, but proceeded to Lignitz, where Henry of Silesia had succeeded in raising a host of thirty thousand men,\u2014Poles and Germans. Among the latter were the knights of the Teutonic order commanded by Poppo von Osternau. The commander-in-chief of the Mongols is called Peta by the Polish chroniclers. D'Ohsson thinks that Baidar, the son of Chagatai is meant. The Mongols were superior in number to their adversaries. On a great plain near Lignitz, subsequently called Wahlstatt, on the 9th of April, 1241, that memorable battle was fought which terminated in the complete defeat of the Poles and Germans, and in which Henry was killed. The Mongols remained for some time in the country, and then invaded Moravia, which belonged to the states of Venceslav of Bohemia. The latter sent five thousand men under the command of Yaroslav von Sternberg to defend Ollm\u00fctz. This valiant captain not only succeeded in holding out in the fortress, but caused great damage to the Mongols by a sally he made. Finally, they withdrew to join the main body of the army, which had been directed to Hungary.\n\n75. Rashid-eddin's account of this expedition is very incomplete and confused (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 621). He states that Batu, Shibai and Buruldai marched upon the Polo (Poles) and Bashguirds (Hungarians);\u2014see further on, 78). The Polo were a very powerful nation who professed the Christian faith, and whose territories bordered on the country of the Franks. After this, Rashid describes the expedition to Hungary, confounding the Poles with the Hungarians.\n\nAn allusion to the Mongol invasion of Poland and Silesia is found also in the Yuan shi, chap. cxxi, in the biography of Wu-liang-ho-t'ai (the son of Subutai). It is stated there that Wu-liang-ho-t'ai accompanied Batu, when he invaded the countries of the Kin-ch'a (Kipchaks) and Wu-la-sze (Russians). Subsequently he took part also in the expedition against the Nie-mi-eze, Po-lie-r and\n\n---\n\nI have little doubt, that by Po-lie-r the Poles are meant, and by Nie-mi-eze the Germans. In the Russian annals, from the 11th century, the Germans are always termed Niemtsy. This name occurs first, in the annals compiled in the beginning of the 12th century, the authorship of which is attributed to Nestor, the father of Russian history, who lived in the second half of the 11th century (see Schloeger's Russian Annals of Nestor, Russian edition, vol. i, p. 37). Nestor gives the names of the nations living in Russia and around it in the 11th century. His information is partly drawn from Byzantine sources. Even now the Germans are designated in Russia by the same name, and it is a general belief there, that niemtsy (singular = niemets) is derived from niemot, \"dumb;\" and that this name was originally given to the\nG. THE INVASION OF HUNGARY, A.D. 1241\u20141242.\n\n76. Compare D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 132 sqq, for information drawn from the Hungarian annals.\n\nAt the time the Mongols ravaged eastern Europe, Bela IV reigned in Hungary. His states were bounded on the north by the Carpathian mountains, and stretched southward to the gulf of the Adriatic. In 1239 he sheltered in his dominions, Kutan, khan of the Kumans, with forty thousand families who had fled from the Mongols. The princes of Russia, Poland, etc., who had escaped the Mongol sword, had also emigrated to Hungary. Kutan had embraced the Christian religion; but his people, unable to resist their natural tendencies, having plundered the country they were traversing, and thus irritated the Hungarians, Kutan being suspected of collusion with the Mongols, was massacred by the mob in 1241. The Kumans, thus brought into the position of declared enemies of the Hungarians, withdrew to Bulgaria on the Danube, ravaging the country on their way.\n\nWhilst one part of the Mongol army devastated Poland, Silesia and Moravia, the main army, conducted by Batu himself, marched upon Hungary, in 1241. But previous to this he had dispatched an exiled Englishman who was in the Mongol service, to summon Bela to surrender. Batu entered the dominions of Bela in March, 1241, by the so-called Russian gate, a defile in the Carpathian mountains. Peta, who proceeded with his troops from Moravia, reached Hungary some time later, by the defile known as the Hungarian gate. The prince Kudan and the general Subutai directed their corps at the same time through Kumania (Moldavia) to Hungary. Bela sent his family to the Austrian frontier, and remained himself in his capital. Batu made\n\nGermans, on account of their ignorance of the Russian language. This view has also been adopted by the eminent Russian scholar Dahl (see his Russian etymological dictionary). But it seems to me, that such a derivation has no foundation. The French might as well suggest that \"Russe\" is derived from rust\u00e9. Niemets or Niemtsy is not a Russian word, and has no more meaning in Russian than in German. It seems to be of Byzantine Greek origin. Compare Sophocles' Greek lexicon of the Roman and Byzantine periods from B.C. 146 to A.D. 1100. Boston, 1870. There we find on p. 770, \"Nemitzi. Austrians, Germans.\" Pseudo Theophyl. b. iv, 1217, c. The Byzantines would hardly have borrowed from the Russians a name for designating the Germans. I may observe that the Hungarians call a German \"N\u00e9met;\" and to the Turks also, the Germans are known under the name of Niemetsi. Col. Yule in his M. Polo, vol. ii, p. 423, quotes the Masdulukal-Abdur, an Arabic medieval geography, in which it is stated, that the country of the Kipchak extended from the Irtysh to the country of the Nemej.\n\nThe Kumans are the same as the Kipchaks of the Mohammedan authors, and the Polovtsy of the Russian annals. Kutan is termed in the Russian annals, Kotian khan of the Polovtsy.\ndirectly for Pesth, ravaging the country through which he passed. When he reached the capital, the Hungarians were not yet ready for battle. The archbishop of Kolocha, however, ventured a sally from Pesth; but was defeated by the Mongols, and escaped with difficulty. When the archbishop of Varadin had arrived with his troops, it was determined to attack the enemy again. According to their favourite stratagem, the Mongols retired by the way they had come; and the Hungarians then marched out. Bela pitched his camp on the western border of the river Sayo, near the place where this river was spanned by a bridge. As it was believed that this bridge was the only place where the Mongols could cross the river, which was bordered by large swamps, a thousand men were posted there for defence. But the Mongols, who at first had encamped at a distance of five miles, suddenly arrived in the night. One part of them waded through the river, while another forced the bridge, by means of a battery of five catapults. At day-break, the Hungarians found themselves attacked from behind; they were defeated, and for the greater part massacred. Bela however succeeded in escaping, and fled to the castle of Thurocz in the Carpathian mountains. A few days later the Mongols took Pesth.\n\n77. Whilst these events were taking place in the heart of Hungary, the prince Kadan advanced through Transylvania. After marching three days through forests, he appeared suddenly at Rudan, a German city situated in the mountains. The city was captured, and the count of Ariscalde and six hundred German troops were made prisoners. After this, Kadan marched upon Waradin, which was easily taken and destroyed. The Mongols met some difficulty however in storming the citadel. Further on, they reached St. Thomas, and then the great city of Perg, which surrendered after a week's siege. The Mongols forced the captive Russians, Hungarians and Kumans to take part in the assault. A few days later Kadan took the monastery of Egresh. After this he probably joined Batu; but the annals are silent on the subject.\n\nThe whole summer and autumn of 1241, the Mongols encamped on the plain of Hungary, without undertaking any military operation. The following winter, when the Danube was frozen, they crossed the river, and attacked and destroyed the city of Gran; but they could not force the citadel, which was defended by the count Simeon. The thaw which then happened obliged them to withdraw. But there was another reason for their retreat. While they were besieging the fort St. Martin, a courier arrived, bringing news of the Great khan's death, with orders for them to return to Mongolia.\n\n---\n\n166 The Sayo is an affluent of the Theiss. It is distant about a hundred English miles north-east from Pesth.\n\n167 A city of the Saxons settled in Transylvania. See note 172.\nThus the Mongols left Hungary in 1242; only one corps, under the command of Kadan, being left behind to pursue the king Bela. The latter had quitted Thurocz and repaired to his family in Austria. Thence he proceeded to Zagrab (Agram), where he passed the summer of 1242; but when informed of the approach of Kadan, he fled to Dalmatia, going first to Spalatro and then to Trau. Finally, he hid himself on a small island situated near that place.\n\nKadan hastened through Sclavonia and Croatia, appeared at Spalatro, besieged the fort Clissa, and spent the whole month of March (it seems of 1243) on the sea-shore opposite the island to which Bela had retreated. After this the Mongols sacked the cities of Cattaro, Suagio and Drivasto. Finally, Kadan went by the route of Serbia to join Batu's army.\n\n78. The author of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai, as well as Rashid, and Casvini also in his geography, terms the Hungarians Bashguirds. But the name Madjar is also found in Rashid's record. It was the generally adopted view apparently, in the middle ages, that the Hungarians in Europe sprang from the Bashguirds or Bashkirs, a people of Turkish race, who dwelt north-east of the river Jaik or Ural, where they are found even at the present day. I may quote the passages from the narratives of Carpini and Rubruquis, which refer to the Hungarians and the Bashkirs.\n\nCarpini calls Hungary by the same name as it is now known to us. On page 667 he enumerates the Mongol princes, who took part in the expedition to Hungary:\u2014\"Ordu, fuit in Poloni\u00e2 et in Hungari\u00e2; Bati, Cadan, Syban, Burin, et Buigec, isti omnes fuerunt in Hungari\u00e2.\" On pages 677, 708, he speaks of the Bascart (Bashkirs) near great Bulgaria, stating that Bascart is the same as \"magna Hungaria.\"\n\nRubruquis (p. 327) places the country of the Pascacier (or Pascatir), west of the Kerkis (Kirghiz) and the Orengai. Ibid, p. 231, we read:\u2014\"Pascatir, que est major Hungaria;\" and on p. 274 it is stated, that the great river Jagac (see above, 65) comes from the country of the Pascatir in the north, which borders upon \"Major Bulgaria.\" Rubruquis states also:\u2014\"Ideoma Pascatur et Ungariorum idem est.\" This latter statement conflicts with the results of modern research regarding the languages of the Bashkirs and the Hungarians; one being a Turkish, the other a Finnish language. It is certain however, that the Hungarians were aborigines of Asia. They arrived in Europe in the 9th century; and then called themselves Magyar (to be pronounced Modjor) as they do\n\n---\n\n168 The Orengai, are the same as the Uranguiles bishe (sylvestres) of Rashid (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 421).\nto the present time. It is difficult to explain the origin of the names *Hongarian*, *Ungar*, etc. In the Russian annals of the middle ages, they are always termed *Ugry*. The Persian geographer Yacut (13th century), in his *Geographical dictionary*, art. \u201cBashguirds,\u201d calls the Hungarians, *Hongross*. In the Chinese and Mongol annals they appear under the name of \u99ac\u624e\u5152 *Mu-dja-r*.\n\nI may finally observe, that there was also, in the 13th and 14th centuries, a city of *Madjar* on the river *Kuma*, north of the Caucasus. It is mentioned by Ibn Batuta (*Yule\u2019s Cathay*, p. 401), and by Wadding in the 14th century (*Ibid.* p. 233). The latter terms it *Mager*. M. Polo\u2019s *Menjar* (vol. ii, p. 421) seems to denote also Madjar. A city of *Modjary*\u00b9\u2070\u2079 is spoken of also in the Russian annals (*Karamzin*, vol. iv, pp. 176, 404). The Russian grand-duke Michael, executed by order of Euzbeg khan (of the Golden Horde), in 1319, near Derbend, was buried in Modjary. Probably Madjar was a city founded by the *Magyars*, who at one time dwelt north of the Caucasus, but subsequently were forced by the *Pechenegs* to emigrate to the west. The ruins of ancient Madjar may still be seen on the river Kuma. See *Beitr\u00e4ge f. kennt. d. Russ. Reichs*, b. iv, p. 55.\n\n79. The *Tarikh Djihan Kushai* describes the Mongol invasion of Hungary as follows (D\u2019Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 620):\n\n\u201cAfter the Russians, the Alans and the Kipchaks had been exterminated, Batu directed his hosts against the Bashguirds, a considerable Christian nation, who are said to border upon the country of the *Franks*. The expedition commenced in the beginning of 1241, when an army of four hundred thousand men marched to make head against the Mongols. Batu despatched his brother Shiban with ten thousand men to reconnoitre the forces of the enemy. After a week Shiban returned, reporting that the enemy had a superior force. When the two hosts faced each other, Batu ascended a hill, where he retired for a day and a night without speaking to anybody, imploring divine protection. He had also ordered all the Mussulmans in his army to pray to Heaven. Next day the troops prepared for the fight; the two armies being separated by a large river (the *Sayo* apparently is meant). In the night Batu detached one part of his troops, commanded by Shiban, to cross the river and attack the enemy; but the attempt was unsuccessful, on account of the great numbers on the defence. The main body of the Mongol army then rushed upon the Bashguirds, and penetrated to the camp of the *kelar*, cutting the ropes of his\n\n\u00b9\u2070\u2079 Modjary is the Russian plural form of Modjar. The Russians are accustomed to use the plural form for names of places.\ntent. When the Bashguirds saw the tent of their kelar falling down, they took to flight; but only a small number of them escaped, the whole country giving way before the invaders. This victory is one of the most glorious exploits of the Mongols.\"\n\nRashid copies the *Tarikh Djihan Kushai*, concerning the war in Hungary. Probably by a clerical error in Rashid's record, the name of the *Bashguirds* is replaced by that of the *Polo* (Poles). But further on Rashid speaks of both nations, distinctly stating that though the countries of the *Polo* and the *Bashguirds* are very large and have many fortresses, they have nevertheless been conquered by the Mongols. These nations however, subsequently revolted, and in Rashid's time (about A.D. 1300) they were not completely subdued; having still their own kings, whom they called kelar.\u00b9\u2077\u2070\n\nRashid gives yet another description of the Mongol invasion of Hungary (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 627), with reference, it seems, to Kadan's march through Transylvania (see above, the Hungarian record) and the pursuit of Bela to the Adriatic; but the events are confusedly reported, thus:\n\n\"In the spring of 1240 (rather 1241) the princes crossed the mountains . . . and entered the countries of the *Bular*\u00b9\u2077\u00b9 and the *Bashguirds*. Orda, who marched on the right flank, traversed the country of *Ilaut*, and vanquished *Bezerenbam* (?) who had ventured to oppose the Mongol army. Kadan and Buri entered the country of the *Sussans*,\u00b9\u2077\u00b2 and defeated them in three battles. Budjec traversed the mountains of this country and entered the *Kara-Ulag* (D'Ohsson understands that Transylvania and Walachia were intended), vanquished the people of the *Ulag* (Wallachians), crossed the mountains . . . , and invaded the country of *Misheslav* (?) who was also defeated. The princes then marched by five different routes upon the countries of the *Bashguirds*, *Madjars* and *Sassans*, and the king *Kelar* took to flight. The Mongol armies passed the summer on the river *Tissa* (Theiss) and *Tonha* (Danube;\u2014in German *Donau*). Kadan moved out with his troops, conquered the country of *Makut* (?) and pursued the sovereign of these countries,\u2014the\n\n\u00b9\u2077\u2070 In Hungarian *kir\u00e1ly* (to be pronounced *kiral*) means \"king.\"\n\u00b9\u2077\u00b9 The author evidently does not mean Bulgaria east of the Volga (the *magna Bulgaria* of Carpini's narrative, p. 708), but Bulgaria on the Danube, the inhabitants of which had formerly emigrated from their original seats near the Volga. The Catalan map (of A.D. 1375;\u2014see Yule's *Cathay*) is quite in accordance with modern charts for the territories south of the lower Danube, but locates a country *Burgaria* on the north of the same river, where Wallachia is marked on our maps.\n\u00b9\u2077\u00b2 Probably the *Saxons* in Transylvania are meant. As is known, the Saxons from the lower Rhine had settled there in A.D. 1148. Michov, *Chronica Polonorum*, states,\u2014\"Partem orientalem Hungariae, quam Almani inhabitabant, Cadan introivit et eam destruxit.\"\nKelar,\u2014as far as the sea. The latter embarked at the seaport . . . , and fled seaward. Kadan then returned; and captured . . . and . . . \u2014who had determined to resist,\u2014in the city of Ulakut. These events took place before he had received the news of the khan's death.\"\n\n80. Chinese accounts of the Mongol expedition to Hungary, and even some details regarding the battle on the river Sayo, are found in the Yuan shi, in the repeatedly quoted biography of Subutai. After narrating the war against the Russians (see above, 73), the biographer continues:\n\n\"The (Mongol) army crossed the mountains \u54c8\u85a9\u91cc Ha-tsa'a-li,\" and attacked the \u9b4f\u502b K'ie-lien, or king of the \u99ac\u624e\u5152 Ma-dja-r; advancing in five corps by five different roads. Subutai was with Batu, and commanded the avant-guard. The other corps were conducted by \u547c\u91cc\u5140 Hu-li-wu, Si-ban and \u54c8\u62c5 Ha-dan. The K'ie-lien being reputed for his valour, Subutai had recourse to stratagem (i.e., he turned the enemy's flank). When the army had arrived at the river \u6df3\u5be7 T'un-ning, the corps of prince Batu crossed the stream in its upper course, where it was shallower, and where there was also a bridge. Subutai, who had to cross it lower down, where the water was considerably deeper, constructed a bridge by fastening beams.\n\n172 Evidently the name of the city of Trau is to be supplied. See above, 77.\n174 The Carpathian mountains are obviously meant. I cannot however explain the name Ha-tsa'a-li. It may be, that \"mountains of Galicia\" is intended, or perhaps Khazaria (Gazari of Carpini, p. 709). Rashid, it seems, speaks of the same mountains mentioned in the Chinese record, but the name is illegible.\n175 K'ie-lien is evidently the same as Kelar of the Persian authors (see note 170), and Kelie of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi (see above, 65), i.e., kiraly, the Hungarian name for \"king.\"\n176 The name of Ma-dja-r denoting Magyar or the Hungarians, occurs for a second time in the Yuan shi, chap. cxxxiv, in the biography of K'u-o-li-gi-sze, whose great-grandfather Ba-sze bu-hua is stated there to have taken part in the expeditions against the Kin-ch'a (Kipchaks), Wa-lo-sze (Russians) and \u99ac\u624e\u5152 Ma-dja-r.\n177 Rashid also states, that the Mongols when marching upon Hungary, entered the country by five different roads.\n178 I do not know for whom this is meant. Rashid mentions a Mongol general Ilaudar (l.c. tom. ii, p. 629). He may be the Hu-li-wu of the Chinese authors.\n179 Si-ban and Ha-dan are evidently identical with the princes Shiban and Kadan in Rashid's record, and in Carpini's narrative, p. 667. Carpini states, that the princes Bati, Cadan, Syban, Burin, and Buigec, were all in Hungary.\n180 As will appear from the subsequent narrative, the river Sa-yo must be meant; although the name given to the river by the Chinese has no resemblance to the Hungarian one.\ntogether. In the meanwhile Batu had been engaged by the enemy, and had lost thirty men, and one of his adjutants, by name Ba-ha-t'u, had also been killed. Batu began to get discouraged and proposed to retreat; but Subutai said:\u2014'Prince, if you wish to retreat, I cannot hinder you; but as for myself, I am determined not to return before having reached the river\u79c3\u7d0dTu-na (the Danube;\u2014in German Donau), and the city (capital) of the\u99ac\u8336Ma-ch'a, i.e. Pesth.' After this he advanced with renewed ardour, and Batu also rushed upon the enemy, who was defeated in the struggle; and the Mongol army reached the capital. Some time later, at a great meeting, Batu ventured to reproach Subutai, saying:\u2014'When we were fighting together on the river T'un-ning, I lost my Ba-ha-t'u owing to your tarrying.' Subutai replied:\u2014'Prince, you know well, that the river at the place where you crossed it was shallow, and you had also a bridge ready-made before you. You have forgotten that where I was obliged to pass, the water was deep, and the construction of a bridge was necessary.' At another meeting, when Batu had drunk a great quantity of kumiss and wine made from grapes, the same matter was again discussed; but then Batu did Subutai justice, acknowledging that the successful issue of the war against the K'ie-lin was to be ascribed altogether to Subutai. After the death of Ogotai, a great meeting of all the princes was convoked, in the year 1243. Batu refused to go, when Subutai persuaded him, saying:\u2014'You are now the eldest among the princes; it is not wise to refuse.' Batu accordingly left next year to attend the meeting. When Kuyuk was raised to the throne, in 1246, Subutai had arrived at court, and afterwards returned to his native country on the river\u79c3\u524cTu-la, where he died in 1246, sixty years of age.\n\nH. Conclusion.\n\n81. After the Mongols had left Hungary, in 1242, they proceeded eastward and remained several months in the countries north of the Caucasus; where some battles were fought with the Kipchaks. Rashid states, that after passing a summer and winter on the road, the princes arrived at their territories in 1243.\n\nThe Yuan ch'ao pi shi speaks of a quarrel which had broken out,\n\n---\n\n181 The Mohammedan authors also state (D'Ohozon, tom. ii, p. 195), that Batu, after the death of Ogotai, refused to attend the great meeting; for he was on bad terms with Kuyuk, who was about to be placed on the throne (see further on, 81, on their quarrels). Afterwards Batu consented to go, but did not carry out his intention; nor did he ever again see his native soil. He died on the banks of the Volga, about 1256.\n\n182 The river Tura in northern Mongolia. The city of Urga is situated on this river.\nat the time of the western war, between Batu and some of the other princes. We read in Paladius' translation, l.c. p. 155, that Batu sent an envoy from Kibcha to Ogedai with the following report:\n\n\"By the favour of Heaven and an auspicious fate, Oh emperor my uncle! the eleven nations (see above, 63) have been subdued. When the army had returned, a banquet was arranged, at which all the (Mongol) princes were present. Being the eldest, I drank one or two cups of wine before the others. Buri and Guyuk were incensed, left the banquet and mounted their horses; at the same time reviling me. Buri said:\u2014'Batu is not superior to me; why did he drink before I drank? He is an old woman with a beard. By a single kick I could knock him down and crush him.' Guyuk said:\u2014'He is an old woman with bow and arrows. I shall order him to be thrashed with a stick.' Another proposed to fasten a wooden tail to my body. Such is the language that was used by the princes, when after the war with the different nations, we had assembled to deliberate on important matters; and we were obliged to break up without discussing the affairs. Such is what I have to report, Oh emperor, my uncle.\"\n\nOgotai on hearing this report got very angry, and at first refused to see Guyuk (who had in the mean time arrived from the west); but when those around him interceded, Ogedai severely rebuked his son, and gave him to understand, that the subjugation of some tribes of Orusi (Russians) attributed to him, afforded no reason for boasting;\u2014the whole merit being due to Subutai. As to Buri's case, Ogotai ordered, that Batu should apply to Chahadai (Chagatai, Buri's father) for judgment.\n\nThe conflict between Buri and Batu is alluded to also by Rashid-eddin (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 269). The Persian historian states, that Buri, who had taken part in the conspiracy against Mangu khan, was delivered to Batu in 1252, who ordered him to be executed; and thus took vengeance on him for some injurious speeches once uttered against Batu in a state of drunkenness.\n\nIt may not be without interest to cite also what Rubruquis says respecting this case. This traveller, who passed through Turkistan, in 1254, says (l.c. pp. 279, 280):\u2014\"Quesivi etiam de Talas civitate (see note 59) in qua erant Teutonici servi Buri, de quibus dixerat frater Andreas, de quibus etiam quesiveram multum in curia Sartach et Baatu. Nihil poteram intelligere, nisi quod Buri, dominus eorum, fuerat interfactus tali occasione: Ipse non erat in bonis pascauis, et quadam die, dum esset ebrius, loquebatur ita cum hominibus suis: 'Nonne ego sum de genere Chingis Chan sicut Baatu? (et ipse erat nepos Baatu vel frater) Quare non vadam super ripam Etilie sicut Baatu, ut pascam ibi? Que verba fuerunt relata Baatu. Tunc ipse Baatu scripsit hominibus illus, ut adducerent\nei dominum ipsorum vinctum, quod et fecerunt. Tunc Baatu quesivit ab eo si dixisset tale verbum, et ipse confessus est. Tamen excusavit se, quia ebrius erat, quia solent condonare ebris. Et Baatu respondit: 'Quomodo audebas me nominare in ebrietate tua?' Et fecit ei amputare caput.\"\n\nPART VI. EXPLANATION OF A MONGOL-CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN ASIA.\n\nA. PRELIMINARY NOTICES.\n\n82. An interesting ancient document, shewing the geographical knowledge possessed by the Chinese (or rather Mongols), in the 13th and 14th centuries, of the countries west of China, has come down to us in the form of a rude map, which has survived from a large work, treating of the institutes of the Mongol empire, and published in the first half of the 14th century. It may serve as a pendant to the curious Catalan map, of the year 1375, reproduced in Col. Yule's Cathay, etc. The ancient Chinese map, which forms the subject of my investigations in the present chapter, is given in two forms in these pages. One is the true reproduction of the original. The only change I have made, for the convenience of European readers, is to represent it upside down; for in Chinese maps anterior to the arrival of the Jesuits, south is always at the top and north at the bottom. On the second sheet, the reader will find the names of the places marked on the Chinese map, rendered in European spelling.\n\nI have seen two copies of this ancient map. One is in manuscript, in the possession of Archimandrite Palladius, and copied from the original in the Chinese imperial library. It is made on a large scale, being about five feet in length; but I fancy the original was not so large. The other is a reproduction of the same original apparently, and is found in the first edition of the \u6d77\u56fd\u56fe\u5fd7 Hai kuo t'u chi, 1844, a modern Chinese work on the historical geography of Asia. This map is about the same size as the Chinese map accompanying this paper. In comparing the reproduced copy in the Hai kuo t'u chi with Palladius' manuscript, I have found some slight differences, owing evidently to clerical errors in both; and the comparison has enabled me to correct the erroneous characters which have crept in, and to supply the omissions.\n\nThe Hai kuo t'u chi is a book well known to European sinologues. Pauthier, in his M. Polo, quotes it frequently; and Julien, in his M\u00e9langes de G\u00e9ographie Asiatique, tom. i, pp. 124 sqq. gives a long review of it, and explains the numerous historical maps of Asia found at the beginning of the work, with the only exception of that curious map, upon which I am about to comment. Julien\npasses it over in silence, although it is the only interesting map in the book; the rest of the historical maps the Chinese author produces being pure inventions of his fancy, without any value. The great sinologue was apparently puzzled to know what to say of this map; and indeed, when seeing it for the first time, without other indications, it is very difficult to guess what it is intended to represent. I should never have been able to recognize in it a map of central and western Asia, if my attention had not been drawn to it by a short note of Archimandrite Palladius (Record of Eccles. Miss. vol. iv, p. 435), in which the learned author states, that this map, compiled about 1330, represents the dominions of the Mongols in Turkistan and Persia. Palladius reproduces also the map in Russian spelling, without however offering any identification of the geographical and other proper names found in it.\n\nMore than a hundred names of places and countries of central and western Asia, and even eastern Europe, are specified on the map in Chinese characters; and we shall see that with the exception of about five, all these names can be easily identified with the geographical names of Asiatic places, as met with in the writings of the Mohammedan authors of that period, or in the narratives of European medieval travellers. I feel little doubt, that the names for which I have not been able to find medieval corroboration, owing to the want of the necessary works, might be found in the great geographical dictionaries of Yacut or other Mohammedan geographers.\n\n83. The title of our ancient map is \u5143\u7d93\u4e16\u5927\u5178\u897f\u5317\u9119 \u5730\u7406\u5716 Yuan king shi ta tien si pei pi ti li t'u, or \"Map from the King shi ta tien of the Yuan dynasty, representing the countries to the north-west (of China proper).\" The King shi ta tien was an extensive work on the institutes of the Mongol dynasty. It seems that only fragments of it have survived. The library of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission was in former times in possession of one part of this work (a manuscript copy), containing an enumeration of the post roads and stations in China proper and a part of Mongolia, during the Yuan dynasty. This copy is now in the possession of the library of the (Rumiantsoff) Museum at Moscow. As the author of the Hai kuo t'u chi states, the map from the King shi ta tien which he reproduces in his book, is found in the gigantic cyclop\u00e6dia compiled by order of the Ming emperor Yung le in the beginning of the 15th century, and known under the name of \u6c38\u6a02\u5927\u5178 Yung le ta tien (22,877 books in the whole;\u2014see Wylie's Notes on Chin. Liter. p. 149).\n\nI have heard that the map in question is omitted in the second and third editions of the Hai kuo t'u chi; but Julien's review refers to the first edition, which is the one I possess.\nAt the end of the geographical part of the Yuan shi, in chap. lxiii, there is an Appendix entitled \u897f\u5317\u5730 Si-pei-ti, i.e. \"The countries to the north-west (of China proper).\" It consists of an enumeration of names of countries and places. Occasionally some descriptive details are added. Even a superficial comparison proves, that the Si-pei-ti and the ancient map from the King shi ta tien correspond, the former being an enumeration of the countries and places marked on the map. There are however in the Si-pei-ti some places, which are omitted from the map; and a few names appearing on the map are not found in the Si-pei-ti. In my review of the map, I shall mention all the geographical names found either in the one or the other.\n\nI feel little hesitation in claiming for my ancient Chinese map, a higher antiquity than can be proved for any other medi\u00e6val map of Asia extant, constructed either in Europe or China. As to the maps made in Europe however, my conclusion is only based upon Colonel Yule's able review of ancient maps (M. Polo, pp. cli sqq.). With respect to the Chinese, there is no doubt that they possessed maps of China, and even of the countries west of China, in early times. Julien, in his M\u00e9langes de G\u00e9ographie Asiatique, pp. 199 sqq. mentions several Chinese works of the 7th century, treating of the countries west of China and accompanied by maps; viz. the \u968b\u897f\u57df\u5716\u8a18 Sui Si yu t'u ki, \"Description of the countries in the west, accompanied by maps,\" published A.D. 606, during the Sui dynasty. A similar work, entitled \u5510\u897f\u57df\u5716\u5fd7 T'ang Si yu t'u chi, also with maps, was published A.D. 650; but these treatises have long been lost, and only fragments of them have survived as quotations in other works. I have not been able to find in Chinese books of more recent date, any mention of the existence of copies of these ancient maps. The historical maps of western and central Asia presented by the author of the Hai kuo t'u chi, are all his own invention, and therefore mere nonsense, without any value. He used no ancient historical map; nor does he even mention the above-quoted ancient works on western countries. Thus the map of the countries in the west, at the time of the Yuan, as given in the Hai kuo t'u chi, and translated by Pauthier in his M. Polo, is not a genuine map of the Mongol period, as he seems to believe.184\n\n---\n\n184 Pauthier however does not represent the configuration of the original map of the Hai kuo t'u chi; but adapts it to our geographical ideas. The original map has not the slightest resemblance to the truth. Pauthier speaks also (l.c. p. 170) of a genuine map of the Mongol Chinese empire, found in the Ku kin chung wai t'u (\u53e4\u4eca\u4e2d\u5916\u5716); but he is mistaken there also, as the historical maps of that work are modern compositions.\n84. The Chinese medi\u00e6val map on which I venture to comment in this paper, although very interesting as an ancient document, has no high claim to correctness and completeness. At first sight it is even difficult to recognize that a geographical map (in our modern western sense) has been intended. We find no rivers, lakes, or mountains marked. The whole sheet appears covered by regular squares formed by straight rectangular lines. Some of these squares contain Chinese characters. Besides the above-mentioned straight (fine) lines, we observe on the map also some thicker lines, stretching irregularly, and intended evidently to mark political divisions. Thus the map appears divided into three parts, each of the parts being provided with a denomination in large characters. In the same way the list of geographical names in the Si-p\u00e9i-ti is divided into three parts, with the same names respectively as on the map, viz.:\u2014the most eastern part has the characters \u7be4\u4f86\u5e16\u6728\u5152 T'\u00fc-lai t'ie-mu-r; the north-western division is termed \u6708\u7956\u4e0d Y\u00fce-dsu-bu; the south-western, \u4e0d\u8cfd\u56e0 Bu-sai-yin.\n\nI have stated above, that the map in question belonged originally to the King shi ta tien, a work apparently corresponding to the \u5927\u6e05\u6703\u5178 Ta ts'ing hui tien of the present dynasty, which treats of the various institutes of the government. I find in the Yuan shi, Annals, sub anno 1331, the following statement:\u2014\"The emperor ordered the savants of the Han-lin y\u00fcan (National Academy) and others, to collect all the documents referring to the institutes of the (Mongol) dynasty, and to publish a work on the model of the \u6703\u8981 Hui yao of the T'ang and the Sung (see Wylie's Notes on Chin. Lit. p. 56), and to entitle it King shi ta tien.\" This is all I have been able to gather respecting this work. The date of its publication, 1331, or a few years later, aids us to explain the above-mentioned three names on the map, viz.: T'\u00fc-lai t'ie-mu-r, Y\u00fce-dsu-bu and Bu-sai-yin, which can easily be recognized as the names of the Mongol khans reigning, according to the Persian authors, at the time spoken of, in Turkistan, Kipchak and Persia, viz. Dure timur, Uzbeg and Abu said; and thus we are enabled to see that the map is intended to represent the three Mongol\n\n---\n\n188 I may observe that Abu said Ilkhan\u00e8 of Persia, 1317\u20141335, is called Bussay by the Archbishop of Sultaniah (The Book of the Estate of the great Caan, 1330;\u2014see Yule's Cathay, p. 238). Pegoletti, who wrote about the same time, terms him Bonsuet. He is called Busaid by some Arabic writers, and on some Mongol coins. The Pope in addressing him, calls him Boyssethan (i.e. Busain khan). Compare Yule, l. c. p. 299; D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 716. Uzbeg, 1312\u20141342, is called Ozbial: in the Russian annals, and Usbech by the Archbishop of Sultaniah. The Uzbegs of our day derive their name from Uzbeg khan.\nempires west of China, governed by the descendants of Chinghiz khan. All the other names on the map,\u2014written in smaller characters,\u2014denote countries or cities situated in these tracts, and we meet especially with such names as are mentioned by the Mohammedan authors in connection with the wars of that period. The greater part of them do not appear in the Chinese or Mongol annals; whilst others spoken of in these annals have been omitted from the map.\n\nIf we take into consideration the time when this cartographical attempt was executed in the far east, and the great distance from China of the countries represented, we must of course be indulgent of the topographical blunders which occasionally appear on the map. Apparently it has been constructed in China, and that only from hearsay. Hence the relative positions of the places are not always in accordance with fact. It is remarkable however, that the names, when compared with the same as given by the Persian writers, show as close an approximation as the Chinese language is capable of. It is needless to state, that the principal value of the map consists in its high antiquity, and in the picture it gives us of the geographical knowledge the Mongols and Chinese possessed in the middle ages, of the countries west of China.\n\n85. Before commenting upon the places and countries mentioned on the map, or in the Si-pei-ti, it may be well to say a few words on the origin and history of the three great Mongol monarchies in the western half of Asia, which, together with the dominions of the Great khan (China proper, Mongolia and Thibet), formed the vast empire conquered by Chinghiz khan and his successors.\n\nAccording to the instructions given by Chinghiz khan, his empire, after his death was divided among his sons, Ogotai, Djuchi and Chagatai. Ogotai, with the title of Great khan, then reigned over China proper, Mongolia, Thibet, Annam, etc.; Chagatai in Turkistan and Transoxiana; whilst the countries north of the Caspian and around the lake of Khorazm (Aral), Russia, with Poland, etc. had been bestowed upon Djuchi, the eldest son of Chinghiz, or, as he died before his father, these dominions fell to the share of his sons. This dynasty is generally called the Golden Horde (Russian annals) or Desht Kipchak (Mohammedan authors). The khans resided in Serai, on the banks of the Akhtuba, a branch of the Volga. The author of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai states (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 2), that the dominions of Djuchi stretched to the west, as far as the soil had been trodden by Tartar horses. Tului, the third son of Chinghiz, obtained by inheritance only an apanage between the mountains of Caracorum and the sources of the Onan; and also his father's private property. But after the death of Ogotai's son Kuyuk (Great khan 1246\u20141248),\nTului's son Mangu was placed on the throne of China, in 1251; and thus the descendants of Tului became the reigning branch in China. Ogotai had originally his apanage on the river Imil (south of the present Chuguchak), but when the princes of this branch had revolted against Mangu khan, they forfeited their possessions. Kaidu, the grandson of Ogotai, however, subsequently conquered a part of Turkistan, and for thirty years disputed the suzerainty with the Great khan, Kubilai.\n\nThe tract assigned by Chinghiz, in the distribution of his provinces, to his son Chagatai, embraced Mawar-al-nahar (Transoxiana), and part of Khorazm, the Uigur country, Kashgar, Badakhshan, and the province of Ghazna to the banks of the Sind. Bishbalik (near the present Urumtsi) north of the T'ien shan, was at first the head-quarters of the khans; which was afterwards transferred to Almalik (near the present Kul'dja). At an early date however, in the history of Chagatai's dynasty, the claims of Kaidu to the supreme khanship seem to have led to a partition of the Chagatai territory; for Kaidu, who as I have stated was of the lineage of Ogotai, being a son of Kashi, held under his own immediate sway a large tract, the greater part of which belonged apparently to the former apanage as originally constituted. It is not very clear, what were the limits between Kaidu's territory and that of the Chagatai khans; but it may be gathered, that Kaidu's dominions included Kashgar and Yarkand, and all the cities bordering on the south side of the T'ien shan as far east as Karakhodjo, as well as the valley of the Talas river; and all the country north of the T'ien shan from lake Balkash eastward to the lake Chagan-nor (somewhere in western Mongolia), and in the further north between the Upper Yenisei and the Irtysh. During a great part of Kaidu's struggles, he found a staunch ally in Dua, the son of Borak, whom he had set upon the throne of Chagatai, in 1272. After Kaidu's death, in 1301, his son and successor Chabar joined with Dua in rendering submission to Timur, the successor of Kubilai; but before long, the two former princes having quarrelled, Dua seized the territory of Chabar, and thus substantially reunited the whole of the original apanage of Chagatai, as it had been before the schism of Kaidu (compare Yule's Cathay, etc. p. 522).\n\nAt the time our map was composed (1330), there seems to have\n\n---\n\n100 Kaidu is called \u6d77\u90fd Hai-du in the Yuan shi, and his father, \u5408\u5931 Ho-shi (chap. cvii, Genealogical table). Hai-du's name is met with very often in the Annals of the Yuan shi,\u2014reign of Kubilai.\n\n101 Dua's name in the Yuan shi, reads \u7be4\u54c7 Du-wa; Chabar is called \u5bdf\u5165\u5152 Ch'a-ba-r there. The latter had the Chinese title \u6545\u5be7\u738b Ju-ning wang (Yuan shi, chap. cvii, cviii, Genealogical tables).\nbeen only one empire in central Asia, ruled by a khan of the lineage of Chagatai; for the map, and also the Si-pei-ti include all the places of Uiguria, Turkistan, Transoxiana, Kabul, etc., in the empire of T'u-lai t'ie-mur (Dure timur, a son of Dua). Colonel Yule has brought forward proofs (l.c. p. 524), that in the 14th century a new schism took place, the middle empire (Chagatai) being again divided.\n\n86. The countries west of the Djihun (Persia), conquered by Chinghiz, were,\u2014after the death of the conqueror\u2014at first considered as common property by his sons, and accordingly governed by mutual agreement (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 104). When however Hulagu, the brother of Mangu khan, had conquered the rest of Persia, and overthrown the calif of Bagdad in 1258, he was invested by his brother with the title of Ilkhan, and governed Persia, Mesopotamia, Babylon and Armenia. He was the founder of the Mongol dynasty known under the name of Ilkhani, which maintained itself in those countries (partly at least) up to the time when Tamerlane over-ran western Asia (end of the 14th century).\n\nIt may be concluded from the records of the Mohammedan authors, that on the west the Chagatai or middle empire was separated from the dominions of the Ilkhans by the Djihun or Oxus, and the boundary seems to be thus represented also on the ancient map; only there is a discrepancy respecting Kabul, Ghazna and Badakhshan. The map assigns these countries to the middle empire, whilst the Persian history of the Ilkhans seems to point to the fact, that, at least in the beginning of the 14th century, they were subject to Persia. We read in D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 568, that in 1316 Oeldjaitu (of Persia) invested Yassawur, a prince of the Chagatai branch,\u2014who had emigrated from Transoxiana,\u2014with the land between Balkh and Kabul. Subsequently Yassawur revolted and invaded Khorassan and Mazandaran, but was defeated.\n\n87. Thus we have in the first half of the 14th century, three great Mongol monarchies west of China. Nominally the khans of these empires owned a supreme head in the Great khan reigning in China; but practically they are generally considered to have been nearly independent. We know however from letters of the Persian khans Argun and Oeldjaitu, addressed to the king of France in 1289 and 1305, that they continued to use the Chinese seals of state, which the Great khan bestowed upon them (Pauthier's M. Polo, pp. 777, 781). They stamped also the name of the Great khan upon their coins (Yule's M. Polo, p. xli), and designated themselves merely as daruga or \"governors\" (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 410).\n\nIt is also worthy of notice, that the khans of Turkistan and Persia, and even those reigning over the territories east and west\nof the Volga (Golden Horde), had their apanages in China, and that up to the 14th century, as we may fairly assume from the evidence I shall produce from the Yuan shi.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, Annals, sub anno 1236 (northern China then had just been subdued by the Mongols), we read:\u2014\"The emperor granted to the empress dowager, the princes and princesses, apanages in China (they are all enumerated, and also the apanages, of which I will only mention three). \u5e79\u9b6f\u6735 Wa-lu-do and \u62d4\u90fd Ba-du (Orda and Batu, both sons of l'juchi) received the department of \u5e73\u967d Ping-yang (in Shansi); and Ch'a-ha-dai (Chagatai), the department of \u592a\u539f T'ai-y\u00fcan (also in Shansi). Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-ts'ai (the minister of Ogotai) presented a report, pointing out the inadequacy of such a management; whereupon the emperor ordered da-lu-hua-ch'i (daruga or Mongol 'governors') to be appointed over the places given as apanages, and that the princes and others should merely receive the revenues from their lands.\" A whole chapter in the Yuan shi,\u2014xcv (\u6b72\u8cdc Sui-sze), is devoted to the pensions and revenues from apanages, which the princes, princesses, sons-in-law of the emperor and meritorious officers, annually drew from the public treasury; and there we find the names of princes of all branches of Chinghiz khan's house. In chap. cviii, under the head of \u8af8\u738b Chu-wang, we find again the names of the Mongol princes under different reigns, and their apanages also enumerated. Sometimes they are entitled \u738b wang (prince or king), sometimes \u5927\u738b ta wang (great prince). When they had an apanage in China, the name of it is prefixed to the title wang, e.g. \u6c5d\u5be7\u738b Ju-ning wang.\n\nTo elucidate the question of the dependency of the Mongol khans,\u2014of the Golden Horde,\u2014of Persia,\u2014and of the middle empire, I may quote some statements of Mohammedan and Chinese authors, giving an insight into the relations between these rulers and the Great khan in China, in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nWassaf records two embassies from the khans of Persia to the emperor of China. We read in D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 320:\u2014\"In 1298 Ghazan khan sent two ambassadors, the Melik Moa'zzam Fakhr-eddin Ahmed and Boca\u00ef Ilchi, to the court of the Great khan Timur, his suzerain. They carried with them magnificent presents,\u2014big pearls and other rare things of great value. They brought also some hunting leopards (compare M. Polo, vol. i, p. 353)......Ghazan provided the ambassadors with a large sum of money to buy for him certain productions of China......They arrived\n\n---\n\n188 Chu-wang means \"princes of the imperial family.\" Even the khans reigning over Persia, Turkistan and Kipchak are always termed chu-wang in the Yuan shi.\nat Taidu and were kindly received by the Great khan, who gave orders also to pay to the Persian khan in silk stuffs his share in the imperial manufacture, which had not been paid since Hulagu had left Mongolia (1253). Ghazan's embassy remained four years in Taidu.\"\n\nThe Yuan shi also speaks of an embassy sent by Ghazan to the emperor of China, but records it a few years later than Wassaf. Another embassy may be meant. We read there, in the Annals, sub anno 1304:\u2014\"In the 7th month an embassy from the \u8af8\u738b chu-wang (prince) \u54c8\u8d0a Ha-dsan in the Si-y\u00fc (western Asia;\u2014see above, 41) arrived at the court with tribute.\" Ghazan reigned 1295\u20141304. This is probably the embassy to which Monte Corvino alludes in his letter of 1306 (see Yule's Cathay, p. 204). Monte Corvino states in this document, that he had previously sent a letter to the father vicar and the friars of Gazaria, by a certain friend who was attached to the court of the lord Kathan Cham (Ghazan khan), and who had come to his Majesty the Cham (the friend had taken the letter when returning to Persia).\n\nThe second embassy of a Persian khan to the Great khan, recorded by Wassaf, was sent about 1312 (see D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 535). The Chinese emperor Ayur bali batra after his accession to the throne, sent two ambassadors, Ayadji Chinksank and Devlet shah, to Persia. They arrived at Bagdad,\u2014where the sultan Oeldjaitu spent the winter,\u2014in February 1312, when they delivered the presents of the Great khan with letters written in the kindliest terms. Subsequently Oeldjaitu (he reigned in Persia 1304\u20141317) on his part sent an embassy to the Great khan. I may here quote D'Ohsson's original translation:\u2014\"Les ambassadeurs que le sultan de Perse envoya en Orient, \u00e0 cette occasion furent charg\u00e9s de v\u00e9rifier la comptabilit\u00e9 des terres qu'il poss\u00e9dait, comme part h\u00e9ritaire de sa branche, et d'en percevoir le produit, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\"\n\nThe Annals of the Yuan shi record, sub anno 1332, an embassy sent by Bu-sai-yin, prince (or king) of the Si-y\u00fc (\u897f\u57df\u8af8\u738b\u4e0d\u8cfd\u56e0), to the emperor Wen-tsung (Tob timur). The name of the ambassador was \u5408\u53ea\u602f\u99ac\u4e01 Ho-dji k'ie-ma-ding. He brought as tribute, seven precious stones and other articles. Bu-sai-yin is Abu said, khan of Persia, 1317\u20141336, the same whose name appears on the ancient map (see above, 84).\n\n88. In the biography of Dju-ch'i, the eldest son of Chinghiz (Yuan shi, chap. cxvii), it is stated, that his dominions were\n\n---\n\nAi-y\u00fc-li ba-li ba-da in the Yuan shi. His ancestral designation was \u4ec1\u5b97 Jen-tsung, 1312\u20141320.\nsituated very far to the north-west, more than ten thousand li distant from the capital (of China). One of Dju-chi's successors sent an embassy in 1336 to the emperor, soliciting the payment of the money due for his apanages in China,\u2014namely Ping-yang (in Shansi), Tsin-chou (in Chili), and Yung-chou (in Hunan),\u2014this money being required for the establishment of post-stations to facilitate the movement of the troops. The ambassador also reminded the emperor that the post-stations in Yue-dsi-bie's dominions were not kept in repair by the central government in China, but that he himself had to meet the expense.\n\nThe Yuan shi, Annals, 1312, records that the prince Ye-sien bu-hua sent an embassy to the Chinese court. This is evidently Issen buca of the Mohammedan authors, who ascended the throne of Chagatai in 1309. Under the year 1315, it is reported in the Annals of the same Yuan shi, that the people in the dominions of the prince T'ulie t'ie-mu-r being afflicted with dearth, the emperor gave orders to assist them with money. T'ulie t'ie-mur is the same as Du-lai t'ie-mu-r on the ancient map (see above, 84) and Dure timur of the Mohammedan authors, khan of the Chagatai empire, about 1330. See D'Ohsson's Genealogical table III. Dure timur's successor was,\u2014according to the Persian historians,\u2014Tarma shirin. The exact time of his reign is not given. In the Yuan shi, Annals, sub anno 1332, an embassy of the princes T'ar-shi-li and Har-man to the Chinese court is recorded (by the first name, Tarma shirin seems to be intended). They sent as tribute, fine western horses, wine made of grapes, and gold-coloured Ya-hu. On the same page, the death of the prince Ye-sien tie-mur is recorded. Here probably Issen timur of the Mohammedan authors is meant, a grandson of Dua (see D'Ohsson's list).\n\n89. In the genealogical table of the Mongol imperial family (Yuan shi, chap. cvii; compare also chaps. cviii and xcv), we find the pedigrees of the branches of Djuchi and Chagatai, and of Hulagu's dynasty in Persia. The greater part of the names we find in these lists, can easily be identified with the names of the genealogical tables, drawn up by D'Ohsson from the information given by the Persian authors. I shall give the pedigrees of the above-mentioned branches, according to the Yuan shi. The names in\n\n---\n\n100 By Yue-dsi-bie, without doubt is meant Uzbeg khan of the Golden Horde, 1312\u20141343; his name is spelt Yue-dsu-bo on the ancient map.\n\n101 Ya-hu means the precious stone yakut, on which see Notes on Chin. Med. Trar. p. 95.\nparentheses are taken from D'Ohsson's tables. There is some confusion in the Chinese list regarding the degree of kindred.\n\n**Branch of \u864e\u8d64 Dju-ch'i (Djuchi,\u2014Chinghiz' eldest son).**\n\n\u62d4\u90fd Ba-du, \u5927\u738b (Batu,\u2014Djuchi's son, the conqueror of Russia).\n\n\u6492\u91cc\u7b54 Sa-li-ta, \u5929\u738b (Sartac,\u2014son of Batu, 1256; Sartach of Rubruquis).\n\n\u5fd9\u54e5\u5e16\u6728\u5152 Mang-k'o t'ie-mu-r, \u738b (Mangu timur, 1265\u20141280;\u2014grandson of Batu).\n\n\u8131\u8131\u8499\u54e5 Tu-t'u meng-k'o, \u738b (Tuda mangu, 1280\u20141287;\u2014grandson of Batu).\n\n\u8131\u8131 Tu-t'u, \u5be7\u8085\u738b Ning-su wang, 1308 (Tuctuca, 1291\u20141312;\u2014son of Mangu timur).\n\n\u5bec\u6492 Kuan-sa, also Ning-su wang (perhaps the Conchi of M. Polo, vol. ii, p. 410).\n\n\u4f2f\u5ffd Bo-hu, \u5927\u738b (perhaps Tula buca, 1287\u20141291;\u2014great-grandson of Batu).\n\n\u6708\u90ce\u5225 Yue-dei-bie, \u5927\u738b (Uzbeg, 1312\u20141342;\u2014grandson of Mangu timur).\n\n\u672d\u5c3c\u5225 Dja-ni-bie (Djanibeg, 1342\u20141356;\u2014son of Uzbeg).\n\nThus in this Chinese list, almost all the reigning khans of the Golden Horde are enumerated, up to the year 1356.\n\nBatu had many brothers. The Mohammedan authors mention Orda, Tangut, Shiban, Shinkur, Barkai, Toca timur. Orda is termed Wa-lu-do in the Yuan shi (see above, 87); Shiban's name is there written \u6614\u73ed Si-ban (see note 179). The Mohammedan authors report (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 251), that when Mangu was elected Great khan, Batu sent his brothers Barkai and Toca timur to attend this solemnity. We read in the Annals of the Yuan shi, sub anno 1251:\u2014\"At the great meeting on the river \u97d3\u96e3 Wa-nan (Onon), in the sixth month, the princes of the western side (\u897f\u65b9\u8af8\u738b) were represented by \u5225\u5152\u54e5 Bie-r-k'o and \u8131\u54c8\u5e16\u6728\u5152 Tu-ha t'ie-mu-r.\n\n**Branch of \u5bdf\u5408\u53f0 Ch'a-ho-t'ai (Chagatai,\u2014second son of Chinghiz).**\n\n\u4e5f\u901f\u8499\u54e5 Ye-su meng-k'o, \u738b (Yissu mangu, 1247\u20141252;\u2014son of Chagatai).\n\n---\n\nIn the biography of Dju-ch'i,\u2014Yilan shi, chap. cxvii, and also in the genealogical tables, some of Dju-ch'i's grandsons and great-grandsons are erroneously represented as his sons.\nHISTORY OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN ASIA.\n\n\u54c8\u524c\u65ed\u5217 Ha-la h\u00fc-lie, \u5927\u738b (Kara Hulagu, 1242\u20141247;\u2014grandson of Chagatai).\n\u963f\u9b6f\u5ffd A-lu-hu, \u5927\u738b (Algu, 1260\u20141266;\u2014grandson of Chagatai).\n\u516b\u524c Ba-la, \u5927\u738b (Borac, 1268 (?);\u2014great-grandson of Chagatai).\n\u8cb7\u4f4f\u97d3 Mai-dju-han, \u514b\u738b, 1310.\n\u963f\u53ea\u5409 A-dji-gi, \u5a01\u9060\u738b.\n\u5ffd\u90fd\u9435\u6728\u5152 Hu-du t'ie-mu-r.\n\u8d64\u56e0\u9435\u6728\u5152 Ch'i-yin t'ie-mu-r.\n\u79c3\u523a T'u-la, \u8d8a\u738b, 1306.\u00b9\u2070\u00b3\n\u5e16\u6728\u800c\u4e0d\u82b1 T'ie-mu-r bu-hua, \u738b.\n\u5357\u7b54\u5931\u91cc Nan-t'a shi-li.\n\nIt seems that only the first part of the names found in this Chinese genealogical table refers to the reigning branch of the Chagatai lineage. As to the rest of the names, I find no corroboration in D'Ohsson's list. But as I have shown above, note 187, Dua the son of Borac, Issen buca, Dure timur and Tarma shirin, all sons of Dua and reigning khans of the Chagatai empire in the first half of the 14th century,\u2014according to the Mohammedan authors,\u2014are mentioned in other parts of the Yuan shi (see above, 88).\n\nBranch of \u65ed\u70c8\u5140 H\u00fc-lie-wu (Hu-la-gu,\n1258\u20141265, in Persia).\n\n\u963f\u516b\u54c8 A-ba-ha, \u738b (Abaca, 1265\u20141282;\u2014son of Hulagu).\n\u963f\u9b6f\u6e3e A-lu-hun,\u00b9\u2070\u2074 \u5927\u738b (Argun, 1284\u20141291;\u2014son of Abaca).\n\u54c8\u8d0a Ha-dsan, \u9756\u9060\u738b, 1300 (Ghazan, 1295\u20141304).\n\nThe rest of the names in this Chinese genealogical table cannot be identified with the names of the Persian khans in D'Ohsson's list. Probably the Yuan shi gives the names of a lateral branch of Hulagu. Thus the name of Abu said, 1317\u20141335, repeatedly mentioned in other parts of the Yuan shi (see above, 87), does not appear in the Chinese genealogical table of Hulagu's branch.\n\n\u00b9\u2070\u00b3 See T'u-la's biography,\u2014Yuan shi, chap. cxvii.\n\u00b9\u2070\u2074 In the biography of Ai-sie,\u2014Yuan shi, chap. cxxxiv, it is stated, that Ai-sie was sent with a message to \u897f\u5317\u5b97\u738b\u963f\u9b6f\u6e3e, i.e. to A-lu-hun, prince (or king) in the north-west. In the Annals of the Yuan shi, sub anno 1284, the name is \u963f\u5152\u6e3e A-r-hun.\nB. IDENTIFICATION OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES OF THE ANCIENT CHINESE MAP.\n\nI. COUNTRIES AND PLACES EAST AND SOUTH OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE (Chagatai).\n\nAs the Si-pei-ti mentions only countries and places belonging to the three empires of the descendants of Chagatai, Djuchi and Hulagu, the following six names of the ancient map are omitted from the list given in that work.\n\n\u6c99\u5dde Sha-chou.\n\n90. Sha-chou means \"sand city,\" or \"sand district,\" in Chinese. It was a district city, situated in the western part of modern Kansu, west of the gate Kia-y\u00fc kuan, in the great wall, and at the eastern border of the great desert, known to the Chinese from remote time as \u6f20\u6c99 Liu-sha (lit. \"moving sand\"). M. Polo crossed this desert when proceeding from the city of Lop to China (l. c. vol. i, p. 180), and states (Ibid. p. 184):\u2014\"After you have travelled thirty days through the Desert as I have described, you come to a city called Sachiou, lying between north-east and east; it belongs to the Great Kaan.\" In ancient times, the great highway from China to central Asia passed through Sha-chou, and not only the Lop-nor route, taken by M. Polo, but also the northern road leading through Hami touches Sha-chou, as may be proved from ancient, and even more recent Chinese itineraries.\n\nThe city of Sha-chou dates from A.D. 622, when it was founded by the first emperor of the T'ang dynasty. But there was at the same place, or near it, an important out-post of China even in the 2nd century B.C. The Han emperor Wu-ti, B.C. 140\u201486, had established there a fortified town, and a district called \u6566\u714c\u90e1 Tun-huang k\u00fcn. This was the starting point of the early expeditions of the Chinese towards the west. A city (\u7e23 hien) Tun-huang is marked on modern Chinese maps, north-east of \u6545\u6c99\u5dde\u57ce Ku Sha-chou ch'eng, (the ancient city of Sha-chou); but according to Archimandrite Palladius, who has special sources of information, ancient Sha-chou was situated on the spot where the present Tun-huang hien stands (see his Elucidations of M. Polo's Travels, p. 5). The part of Kansu west of the gate Kia-y\u00fc kuan is completely unknown to Europeans, and therefore all the information we possess regarding this tract, is drawn from Chinese sources.\n\nIn the Mongol period, Sha-chou was a \u8def lu, i.e. \"circuit\" or\n\"department.\" At the time of the Ming it was a \u885b wei, or \"military station\" (Ming shi, chap. cccxxix, fol. 22).\n\n\u67ef\u6a21\u91cc Ko-mu-li = Kamul.\n\n91. This is without doubt the Camul of M. Polo. That traveller states (vol. i, p. 189), that this province belonged to the Great Kaan, and thus corroborates the map, which locates Ko-mu-li beyond the middle empire, but close to the frontier. Rashid-eddin, who wrote about the close of the 13th century, when the middle empire was for the greater part in the possession of Kaidu (see above, 85),\u2014then engaged in a struggle with Kubilai,\u2014records (Yule's Cathay, p. 275), that Karakhodjo (see further on, 111), a city of the Uigurs, lies between the two states and maintains neutrality. Karakhodjo is placed on the ancient map opposite Ko-mu-li to the west, but inside the middle empire.\n\nM. Polo is the first western author who mentions Camul, but he did not himself visit the place. Marignolli was in Kamul in 1342 (Yule's Cathay, p. 390), and seems to have spent some considerable time there. Kamul appears to have been the see of a Nestorian bishop; for a bishop of Kamul is mentioned as being present at the inauguration of the Catholicos Denha in 1226 (Yule's M. Polo, vol. i, p. 190). The place is styled Camull on the Catalan map. Shah Rokh's embassy, when proceeding to China, passed through Camul (Yule's Cathay, p. cc), and the Persian merchant Haji Mohammed, 1550, states (l. c. p. cxcvii), that from Succuir (Su-chou) to Camul is fifteen days' journey. Colonel Yule is correct in refuting the view of Foster, that Camexu (Camechu) in Pegoletti's notices of the land-route to Cathay (l. c. p. 288) is to be identified with Camul or Ha-mi chou (\u54c8\u5bc6\u5dde) of the Chinese. Camexu denotes Kan-chou in Kansu. In Chinese books, Kamul never appears as Ha-mi chou; but in the \"History of the Ming,\" chap. cccxxix, fol. 1, it figures as Ha-mi wei (i.e. \"fortified place Hami\"). Benedict Goez, in the beginning of the 17th century, proceeding from India through central Asia to China, went from the fortified town Turphan to Aramuth, and then to Camul, another fortified town (l. c. p. 578).\n\nKamul is the Turkish name of the place. In Chinese works it\n\n---\n\nI possess a detailed Chinese itinerary, of the 15th century, of the route from Kia-y\u00fc kuan through central Asia to the Mediterranean. There I find a city \u524c\u6728 La-mu mentioned between \u54c8\u5bc6 Ha-mi (Kamul) and \u571f\u9b6f\u756a T'u-lu-fan (Turphan). La-mu may be the Aramuth of Goez. However the same Chinese itinerary also mentions a place \u963f\u524c\u6728 A-la-mu west of Turphan.\nis generally termed \u54c8\u5bc6 Ha-mi, which name however appears for the first time, not earlier than the Mongol period. In ancient times it was known to the Chinese by other names. It is first mentioned in Chinese history in the first century of our era, under the name of \u4f0a\u543e\u76e7 I-wu-lu. See the \"History of the later Han,\" chap. cxviii, Si-y\u00fc, where it is stated, that I-wu-lu was an important place 1000 li north of the fortress Y\u00fc-men kuan (see above, 41), and the key to the Si-y\u00fc, or \"western countries.\" I-wu-lu, situated in a very fertile country, belonged originally to the \u5308\u5974 Hiung-nu (the ancient inhabitants of Mongolia). It was taken by the Chinese, A.D. 73; who then established military colonies there. During the T'ang period and later (7th to 11th centuries), I-wu-lu bore the name \u4f0a\u5dde I-chou. Thus the place is termed also in the narrative of Wang Yen-te, who in 981 went from China to Kao-chang (see Julien's M\u00e9l. de G\u00e9ogr. Asiat. p. 90).\n\nIn the Yuan shi we first meet with the present Chinese name of the place \u54c8\u5bc6 Ha-mi. See the biography of the Uignr prince Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin, chap. cxxii. But the Yuan shi writes the name more generally \u5408\u8ff7\u91cc Ho-mi-li (or Ko-mi-li;\u2014see Annals, sub anno 1286). The emperor bestowed money and cattle upon the impoverished people of Ko-mi-li and Hu-la-ho-djo (Karakhodjo, see 111). In the year 1289, the people of Ko-mi-li are stated to have been again afflicted with dearth. The emperor then ordered corn to be sent from Kansu to Ko-mi-li. In the biography of T'a-ben (chap. cxxiv) we read, that he was a man from I-wu-lu; the most ancient name for Kamul being used there. In the biography of Bi-lan (chap. ccii), the name of the realm \u54b8\u6728\u9b6f Kan-mu-lu (apparently Kamul is meant) is found associated with \u5317\u5ead Pei-t'ing (the present Urumtsi;\u2014see below, 108).\n\nIn the \"History of the Ming,\" chap. ccxxix, fol. 1, \u54c8\u5bc6 Ha-mi appears as a fortified place (\u885b wei), 1600 li distant from Kia-y\u00fc kuan, situated on the most important road leading to the western countries. The population is stated to consist of \u56de\u56de Hui-hui (Mohammedans), \u754f\u5140\u5152 Wei-wu-r (Uigurs) and \u54c8\u524c Ha-la (a people unknown to me). At the present day the Chinese term Kamul also Ha-mi, as in the preceding centuries.\n\n\u5854\u5931\u516b\u91cc T'a-shi-ba-li = Tashbalik.\n\n92. Probably by these four Chinese characters, Tashbalik (meaning \"Stone city\" in Turkish) is intended. The place is marked on the ancient map, east of Kamul. I have not been able to trace this name in any western or eastern author applied to a city near Kamul. I may however mention, that the above-quoted\ntraveller Wang Yen-te (A.D. 981), proceeding from China to Kao-chang, before arriving at I-chou (Kamul) passed through \u5c0f\u77f3\u5dde Siao Shi-chou or \"Little stone city.\"\n\n\u571f\u4f2f\u7279 T'u-bo-t'e = Tibet.\n\n93. The Chinese characters here without doubt render Tubot, which even now is the Mongol name for Tibet.\n\nMr. Hodgson (\"The Literature and Religion of the Buddhists,\" in The Phoenix, 1871, p. 94) states respecting Tibet:\u2014\"Bhot is the Sanscrit, and Tibet the Persian name of the country. The native name is Bod, a mere corruption of the Sanscrit appellation, proving that the Tibetans had not reached a general designation for their country, when the Indian teachers came among them.\"\n\nThe names we use in Europe to designate the mountainous country bordering upon China proper on the west (Tibet, T\u00fcbet, T\u00e9bet), are all apparently derived from the Arabic; for the name of Tibet among western authors first occurs in the narrative of those Arabian travellers who visited China about the middle of the 9th century. Compare Reinaud, Relation des Voyages faits par les Arabes et les Persans dans l'Inde et \u00e0 la Chine dans le ix\u00b0 si\u00e8cle, p. 60, where it is recorded that Tibet and the Tagazgaz are the western neighbours of China. Col. Yule (Cathay, p. cx) quotes an Arabian geographer who was contemporary with the earlier of the two compilers of the Relation, and who states that China is bounded by the sea, by Tibet and by the country of the Turks.\n\nThe most detailed accounts of the history of Tibet are to be found in Chinese books, and especially in the histories of the different Chinese dynasties. Father Hyacinth, in his \"History of Tibet and Kukonor\" (in Russian, 2 vols. and a map, 1833), has translated from Chinese authors, all the historical records respecting these countries; but his history concludes with the beginning of the 12th century.\n\nIn the most ancient times the tribes living west of China proper, in the present Tibet and Kukonor, are comprised in the general name \u897f\u7f8c Si K'iang (western Kiang). These names are met with in the Chinese classics. Since the 7th century of our era, Tibet is termed \u5410\u8543 T'u-fan in the Chinese annals. This name in the \"History of the T'ang\" (T'ang shu, chap. colvi) is applied to a powerful kingdom, which during the T'ang period caused much trouble to China. The T'ang history, in the beginning of the article T'u-fan, states that this people originated from the K'iang, and especially from a tribe called \u7f8c Fa K'iang; and then explains that the character \u7f8c is\nvery similar in sound to \u8461. Thus the T'ang shu tries to explain the origin of the name T'u-fan (Hyacinth, l. c. vol. i, p. 125). According to Dr. Williams' Dictionary, \u8461 was in ancient times pronounced bat, and \u8461 bam. It seems to me that the original Chinese reading of T'u-fan was T'u-bot. Perhaps the second character of the name was originally written with another radical: e.g., \u64ad, which in the present day is pronounced bo, the ancient sound being bot. The above-mentioned Arabian travellers in the 9th century, heard of course the name Tibet from the Chinese, who in their annals of that time spell the name of the same country \u5410\u8543. In the history of the Sung, which ruled over the greater part of China, 960\u20141280, Tibet is also termed T'u-fan; whilst the historians of the Liao dynasty, in northern China, and contemporary with the Sung, style the same country \u9435\u4e0d\u5fb7 T'ie-bu-te. We read in the Liao shi, chap. xx, that in 1047, an envoy from the kingdom of T'ie-bu-te, arrived at the court of the Liao, to solicit help against the \u590f Hia (Tangut empire).\n\nFather Hyacinth (l. c. vol. ii, p. 164) quotes a passage from the Sung history in which it is stated, that about A.D. 1060, the emperor of the Liao bestowed a princess of his house upon the son of the king of T'u-fan. The same event is reported in the \"History of the Liao,\" where that kingdom is termed \u5948\u5ba2\u7279 T'u-bo-te.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, Tibet is mentioned under different names. Sometimes the Tibetans are called there \u897f\u756a Si-fan, which is a Chinese name meaning literally the \"western Barbarians.\" This name occurs in the Chinese annals as early as the beginning of the 11th century. Hyacinth thinks, that the authors of the Mongol period, by Si-fan especially understood the people of the Tibetan province Amdo (l. c. Preface, p. ix, and vol. ii, p. 133). During the Ming period, the southern part of Kansu, Kukonor, and the northern part of Tibet, were comprised under the appellation Si-fan. (See Ming shi, chap. cccxxx, fol. 1\u201412, \u897f\u756a\u8af8\u885b Si-fan chu wei, i.e. \"The fortified places in Si-fan,\" and \u5b89\u5b9a\u885b An-ting wei, which place is stated there to have been situated 1500 li south-west of Kan-chou; to the south, it bordered upon Si-fan). In the Yuan shi, the name Si-fan appears in chap. ccii,\u2014biography of Dan-ba. He was a man from T'u-gan-sze dan-ma in Si-fan.\n\nSometimes the Yuan shi uses the ancient name T'u-fan, to designate Tibet. In the Annals, sub anno 1251, we read:\u2014\"Mangu khan intrusted Ho-li-dan with the command of the troops against T'u-fan.\" Sub anno 1254 it is stated, that Kubilai (who at that time was still the heir apparent), after having subdued the tribes of Y\u00fcnnan, entered T'u-fan, when So-ho-to, the ruler of the country\nsurrendered. Again, sub anno 1268:\u2014\u201cThe emperor ordered Meng-gu-dai to invade Si-fan with six thousand men.\u201d Sub anno 1275:\u2014\u201cThe prince A-lu-chi (seventh son of Kubilai) led an expedition to Tu-fan.\u201d Tu-fan is further mentioned in the Yuan shi, as the native country of \u5df4\u601d\u5df4 Ba-sze-ba, the Lama priest who invented Kubilai\u2019s official alphabet (see chap. ccii,\u2014his biography). The Chinese text has \u571f\u756a\u85a9\u65af\u8fe6\u4eba i.e., \u201ca man from Sa-sze-kia in Tu-fan,\u201d or perhaps by Sa-sze-kia jen, \u201ca man of the doctrine of the Sakia-muni (Buddha)\u201d is meant. In chap. cxxii, biography of An-dja-r, we find Tibet designated by \u62d3\u8dcb Tu-bo; and in chap. cxxxiii, in the biography of Djuo-a k'o-pun, it is stated, that he belonged to the people of \u571f\u6ce2\u601d\u70cf\u601d\u85cf\u64a5 Tu-bo-sze wu-sze-dsang-do. In this name we recognize again Tibet in Tu-bo. The name \u70cf\u601d\u85cf Wu-sze-dsang occurs once more in the Yuan shi. In chap. lxxxvii, it is mentioned in connection with the Mongol troops cantoned there. According to the Ming shi, chap. cccxxxi, fol. 1, Wu-sze-dsang was situated west of Yunnan; and thus formed a part of Tibet, and belonged to the \u5927\u5bf6\u6cd5\u738b Ta-pao fa-wang, which was the title of Ba-sze-ba and his successors, as heads of the Lamaite church in Tibet.\n\nAt the present day, Tibet is termed \u897f\u756a Si-fan by the Chinese; but it is more generally known under the name of \u897f\u85cf Si-dsang.\n\nAs I have stated above, Tibet was known to the Mongols in the middle ages, as it is now, under the name of Tubot. In the Mongol text of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi (Palladius\u2019 translation, p. 148), in one case, the valour and fierceness of the Mongols, are compared with those qualities in the dogs of Tubot.196\n\nAs to the Mohammedan and European authors, who mention Tibet in the middle ages, I may quote,\u2014besides the above-noticed Arabian travellers in the 9th century,\u2014the Arabian geographer Edrisi (middle of the 12th century), who calls the country Tobbat. In Rashid-eddin\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Mongols,\u201d the name of Tibet appears repeatedly. The Persian historians also state (D\u2019Ohsson, tom. i, p. 82), that Singun, the son of Ong khan, after the latter had been defeated by Chinghiz, fled to Buri-tibet. The existence of a similar name is corroborated, not only by Carpin (p. 658), who mentions the conquest ef the country Burithabet by the Mongols, but also in the Ts'in cheng lu, compiled from Mongol documents, where we read (Palladius\u2019 translation, p. 176), that\n\n---\n\n196 The Chinese translator (14th century) renders \u201cdogs of Tubot\u201d by \u897f\u756a\u72d7 Si-fan kou. Compare M. Polo, vol. ii, p. 32, on the mastiff dogs of Tebet as big as donkeys.\nOng khan's son fled to the people of Bo-li t'u-fan (Bori Tibet;\u2014for T'u-fan is the same as Tibet).\n\nRubruquis, after having spoken of the Tanguts, says also a few words about the Tibetans; p. 289:\u2014\"Post istos sunt Tebet, homines solentes comedere parentes suos defunctos, ut causa pietatis non facerent aliud sepulcrum eis nisi viscera sua etc.\"\u2014Ibid. p. 329:\u2014\"Thebet scribunt sicut nos, et habent figuras valde similes nostris.\"\n\nIn M. Polo's narrative, two long chapters are found concerning the province of Tebet, in vol. ii, pp. 26 sqq. and in vol. i, p. 265, he speaks of the sorcerers of Tebet and Kesimur at the court of the Great khan.\n\nCol. Yule states (l. c. vol. ii, p. 29), that it is not very clear how Tibet came under subjection to the Mongols, no conquest of their armies being related by either the Mohammedan or the Chinese historians. Indeed, it seems, that with the exception of the above-quoted passages, in the Chinese annals, respecting Tibet, nothing more is said of the warlike enterprises of the Mongols against this country.\n\n\u5929\u7afa T'ien-chu = India.\n\n94. T'ien-chu is the name by which India was known to the Chinese from the beginning of our era. See the \"History of the Posterior Han,\" chap. cxviii. But the most ancient Chinese name for India is \u8eab\u6bd2 Shin-du. This name first appears in the Chinese annals about B.C. 120, after the expedition of Chang Kien to western Asia (see above, 39). The Chinese authors, of the Mongol period generally call India \u6b23\u90fd\u601d Hin-du-sze (Y\u00fcan shi, Annals, sub anno 1253), or \u5370\u5ea6 Yin-du (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 35, 39, 89, 104, 117).\n\n\u4e5e\u5931\u8ff7\u8033 K'i-shi-mi-r = Cashmere.\n\n95. Respecting Cashmere,\u2014for evidently this country is intended,\u2014I have only a few words to say. It was known to the Chinese under about the same name during the T'ang period. See T'ang shu, chap. ccviii, article \u9806\u5931\u5bc6 K'o-shi-mi. Under the name of \u8fe6\u6fd5\u5f4c\u7f85 Kia-shi-mi-lo it appears in the narrative of Huan-tsang, in the 7th century (comp. Julien's M\u00e9m. s. l. Contr\u00e9es Occidentales, tom. i, p. 167). The Chinese traveller Ch'ang Te (1258) also speaks of the Buddhist kingdom K'i-shi-mi, to the north-west of Yin-du (India). See my Notes on Chin. Med. Travellers, p. 81. With respect to Cashmere, see also above, 65.\nII. Countries and Places in the Empire of Du-lai T'ie-mu-r (the Middle Empire).\n\nWei-wu-r = Uigurs.\n\n96. The map has only the characters Wei-wu-r; but in the list of the Si-pei-ti, the character \u5730 ti, \"country\" is added to the name. There is also a short note, stating that in the year 1283, post-stations were established in four places (cities) of that country, and also a treasury was founded for the exchange of paper money (\u4ea4\u949e\u5e93).\n\nThe name Wei-wu-r was applied in the days of the Mongols to the Uigurs, a nation who before the time of Chinghiz, had played an important role in the history of central Asia. In the 7th century they had their abode in the western part of Mongolia; and in the 8th century, their capital was near the place where afterwards Karakorum was built. It seems that at the time of their greatest power, the Uigurs extended their rule far to the west, and their dominions reached the Caspian sea. In the middle of the 9th century, the power of the Uigurs in Mongolia was broken by the Kirghiz, and they were dispersed. But some time later, there were again Uigur kingdoms in Kan-chou and in the country south and north of the eastern T'ien shan. In the latter tracts especially, the Uigurs were known to the Mongols as Wei-wu-r. Very little is known about the western Uigurs. The Mohammedan authors of the 11th and 12th centuries seem to comprise them under the general name of eastern Turks. The name Uigur is first found in the writings of the Mohammedan authors in the 12th century; and in the same period the name Wei-wu-r first appears in the Chinese annals. Before that time, the Chinese termed them \u80e1\u80e1 Hui-ho, by which, in the Mongol period, the Mohammedans were generally designated. Thus the question regarding the names by which the Uigurs and Mohammedans were known to the Chinese is somewhat complicated.\n\nAs the Uigurs originate from eastern Asia, we have of course to look for their history to the Chinese historical records, where bulky articles are devoted to them. It is not my intention here to give a complete translation of these accounts, which would be very tedious to the reader. The history of the Uigurs from Chinese sources has long been made accessible to European savants. A good translation of these accounts has been given by Visdelou in the Suppl. \u00e0 la Bibl. Orient. Father Hyacinth in his work \"The Nations of Central Asia\" (in Russian), gives the most detailed information on the history of the Uigurs; but his accounts conclude with the 10th century. Besides these, Klaproth\nhas written several very able articles on the Uigurs (M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, pp. 301 sqq.\u2014Tableaux Historiques de l'Asie, etc.) in which he proves convincingly, that the Hui-ho of the Chinese authors (anterior to the Mongol period) are identical with the Uigurs;\u2014that the idiom of this people belongs to the stock of the Turk languages;\u2014and that the Mohammedan authors are right in classing the Uigurs among the eastern Turks.\n\nThus I may confine myself to a brief summary of the leading facts in the history of the Uigurs; but I shall occasionally dwell longer upon topics not previously published, and upon questions not yet satisfactorily elucidated.\n\n97. In the \"History of the T'ang dynasty\" (618\u2014907), a long article is devoted to the \u56de\u7d07 Hui-ho or Uigurs (chap. ccviiia). It is there stated, that at the time of the Northern Wei (386\u2014558), the same people were called \u9ad8\u8eca Kao-ch\u00e9 (it may also be pronounced Kuo-k\u00fc). During the Sui dynasty (589\u2014618), they were known under the name of \u8349\u7d07 Wei-ho. They were sometimes also termed \u70cf\u7d07 Wu-ho, \u70cf\u8b77 Wu-hu and \u58f9\u7d07 Yuan-ho. Properly it was only one of the tribes of the Kao-ch\u00e9, called Yuan-ho, from which, according to the T'ang history, the Hui-ho derive their origin.107 They were at first tributaries of the \u7a81\u53a5 Tu-k\u00fce (Turks); but from the beginning of the 7th century the Hui-ho formed an independent kingdom. Their dominions were then situated north of the \u859b\u5ef6\u9640 Sie-yen-t'o (another tribe of the Kao-ch\u00e9). They had their capital on the river \u5854\u9675 So-ling (probably the Selenga is meant, a southern affluent of lake Baikal). It was distant 7,000 li from the capital of the T'ang (Chang-an, the present Si-an fu in Shensi). \u5019\u65a4 Sze-gin was the name of the ruler of the Hui-ho, who declared himself independent. He had the title \u7279\u5065 Te-gien.108 His successor \u8457\u85a9 Pu-sa established his residence on the river \u7368\u6a02 Tu-le (the Turca, an affluent of the Orkhon, which discharges into the Selenga). In the year 629, he dispatched an envoy to the emperor of China. His successor Hu-lu-sze-li-fa-tu-mi-du subdued the tribe of the Sie-yen-t'o (see above), crossed the mountains \u8cc0\u862d\u5c71 Ho-lan shan,109 arrived at the Yellow river, and in\n\n---\n\n107 In the \"History of the Northern Wei\" it is said, that the \u9ad8\u8eca Kao-ch\u00e9 (these two characters mean \"high cart\" in Chinese; and the Wei shu explains the name, by the big wheels of their carts) originally dwelt south of the Mongolian desert, and west of the Yellow river; but towards the end of the 4th century of our era, they emigrated to the northern verge of Gobi.\n\n108 Teghin was in ancient times the title of the rulers of the Turks;\u2014e.g. Alpteghin, Sebegteghin of the Ghaznevid dynasty (10th century).\n\n109 The mountain of A-la shan near the left bank of the Yellow river,\n630, sent an envoy to the emperor of China in acknowledgment of his supremacy; whereupon the Chinese considered the kingdom of the Hui-ho as a vassal state. About twenty khans of the Hui-ho are mentioned in the T'ang history, and many particulars regarding their wars etc. are given there. I shall only speak of the most distinguished rulers.\n\nP'ei-lo (or Ku-li; P'ei-lo) came to the throne in 742. He destroyed the empire of the Tu-kuie (Turks) in 744, and then ruled over the territory of the ancient Hiung-nu (see above, 91). His dominions stretched to the east, as far as Shi-wei, and westward to the Kin shan (Altai mountains), while they were bounded by the desert on the south. The Chinese emperor bestowed upon P'ei-lo, the title Gu-du-lu Pi-k'ie-kuie k'o-han. P'ei-lo established his residence among the Wu-te-kien mountains on the river Kun, where previously the Tu-kuie (Turks) had dwelt.\n\nWe learn further from the T'ang shu, that the Hui-ho nation was divided into nine tribes, viz. Yo-lo-ge,\u2014which was the tribe of the family of the khan (\u53ef\u6c57\u4e4b\u59b9),\u2014Hu-du-go, A-wu-ch'ai, Le-wu-go, Du-lo-wu, Go-sa, Hi-ye-wu, Mo-go-sze-go and Hu-wen-so.\n\nThe Hui-ho were at first on good terms with China, but subsequently when they grew stronger, they often disturbed the Chinese frontier by their predatory incursions. Moyen-djo, called also Go-le k'o-han (perhaps gurkhan;\u2014see above, 33), the successor of P'ei-lo, came to the throne in 756. He was a valiant warrior and gave assistance to the Chinese emperor against the rebellion raised by An-lu-shan. The emperor bestowed upon him a Chinese princess, by name Ning-kuo. The princess was accompanied by a Chinese envoy to the court of the Hui-hui, where she was handed over to the khan. Moyen-djo visited a few years ago by Colonel Przczwalsky. On modern Chinese maps this mountain is still termed Ho-lan shan.\n\nA people of the same stock as the K'tan.\n\nKutuk, in Turkish means \"happy,\" k'o-han is evidently intended for khan, the title of the Turkish sovereigns in Asia. See Bibl. Orient p. 502, where this term is translated by \"Grand et puissant seigneur.\" I may observe, that in the Chinese annals, the title khan appears for the first time under the year A.D. 812. It is there stated that in this year the Han I-li of the tribe T'o-bo (afterwards the dynasty of Northern Wei) gave assistance to the Chinese against the Hiung-nu.\n\nAs we shall see further on, Rashid-eddin states, that the Uigurs dwelt near the mountains of Karakorum and on the river Orkun. One of their tribes was called Uteken. This latter name sounds like the Chinese Wu-te-kien. The Kun river of the Chinese authors may be identified with the Orkun, or Orkhon river.\ndied the year after this marriage, and the princess returned to China; but her younger sister, who had accompanied her, became the wife of Mo-yen-djo's successor \u79fb\u5730\u5065 I-di-gien, called also \u8f66\u7fbd\u53ef\u6c57 Mou-y\u00fc k'o-han, A.D. 762. After the death of this khan in 779, this princess lived for many years apart from the court of the Hui-ho, and died in that country in 790. In 788 another Chinese princess, named \u54b8\u5b89 Hien-an, was given as wife to the khan of the Hui-ho. She lived twenty years at the court, having been the wife of four khans in succession.\n\nIn the year 788, the Hui-ho solicited the permission of the Chinese emperor to change their former name Hui-ho into \u56de\u9dbb Hui-hu, which would better answer their warlike character (hu means a falcon in Chinese). The emperor acceded to this request, and some years later the Hui-hu assisted the Chinese in their war against the T'u-fan (Tibetans;\u2014see above, 93), by expelling the latter from Pet-t'ing (the present Urumtsi;\u2014see further on, 108), which had been previously captured by the Tibetans, while they sent the prisoners to the emperor of China. Again, in the year 822, a Chinese princess, by name \u592a\u548c T'ai-ho, was given in marriage to a khan of the Hui-hu. His name and title were \u767b\u7f85\u7fbd\u9304\u6c92\u5bc6\u65bd\u53e5\u4e3b\u9304\u6bd7\u4f3d\u5d07\u5fb7\u53ef\u6c57 Deng-lo y\u00fc-lu-mo mi-shi G\u00fc-dju-lu P'i-kie ch'ung-te k'o-han. A Chinese envoy accompanied the princess to the capital of the Hui-ho. She kept her own court there and was assisted by two ministers. In the year 840, the \u7570\u8b8a\u65af K'ie-gia-sze (Kirghiz) destroyed the empire of the Hui-hu. Their capital was taken and the khan slain, while the people were all dispersed. One of the ministers of the late khan, named \u9f8d\u7279\u52d2 P'ang-t'e-le, at the head of fifteen tribes (of the Hui-hu) fled to the \u845b\u908f\u797f Ko-lo-lu (probably the Karluks;\u2014see further on, 121). The rest of the Uigurs emigrated to the south, and finally established themselves near the mountain \u932b\u5b50\u5c71 T'so-tze shan, where they elected a new khan. After this they frequently disturbed the Chinese frontier, and even succeeded in taking \u5929\u5fb7 T'ien-te (see note 18), \u96f2\u4e2d Y\u00fcn-chung (the present Ta-t'ung fu in Shansi), and \u80af\u65b9 So-fang (also in Shansi). But in 847 the Hui-hu suffered a total defeat by the Chinese army. The last khan fled to the west; and such of his people as were left went over to P'ang-te-le, who in the meantime had taken possession of \u7518\u5dde Kan-chou (in Kansu).\n\n---\n\n* * * G\u00fc-dju-lu in this long name and title is probably Guchluk, a name of Turkish (?) origin. As we have seen (above, 34), the Naiman prince who usurped the throne of Karakhitai, in the beginning of the 13th century, was called Guchluk. P'i-k'ie seems to represent the Turkish Buku (see further on, 103). Ch'ung-te is a Chinese honorary title meaning \"Highly virtuous.\"\nand of the cities west of the stony desert (\u7cbe\u897f\u8af8\u57ce). He was finally recognized as khan by the emperor of China. The Hui-hu however, could never again recover their strength. Such is a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the accounts regarding the Hui-hu, given in the T'ang shu.\n\n99. In the Wu-tai period (first half of the 10th century), the Hui-ho of Kan-chou sent several envoys to the Chinese court. In the Liao shi, chap. ii, it is stated, that when A-pao-ki, the first emperor of the Liao, in 923, was encamped near the ancient capital of the Hui-hu (see note 237), the khan of the Hui-hui came to pay tribute (it is not said from what part; but further on we read in that record, that in the same year, A-pao-ki captured one of the governors of the Hui-hu of Kan-chou, and sent one of his officers to the khan,\u2014probably to summon him to submit).\n\nIn chap. xxx of the Liao shi, the khan of the Hui-hu of Kan-chou is again spoken of. When Ye-l\u00fc Ta-shi, the founder of the Si Liao dynasty (Kara-khitai), had quitted his native country, in 1221, Pi-le-ko, the khan of the Hui-hu of Kan-chou came to meet him and made rich presents, etc. (see above, 25).\n\nMention is made also of the Hui-hu of Kan-chou in the \"History of the Sung dynasty\" up to the year 1126. In 1128 the Hia, or Tanguts, took Kan-chou, and subsequently also other cities of the Hui-hu; from which time this branch of the Uigurs is no more heard of in Chinese history. It seems that in the \"History of the Kin\" (12th century), nothing is recorded of the Hui-hu.\n\n100. In the Y\u00fcan shi we read again of the Uigurs, but now they are mentioned by another name and in another country.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** See my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 28, note 53.\n\nI may notice here a curious tradition recorded by Chinese authors, that in the time of their power, the Hui-hu once made prisoner one of the chiefs of the K'itan (Liao) and forced him to tend cattle. I do not remember in what Chinese book I saw the original account; but allusion is made to this tradition in the narrative of Wang Yen-te; who was sent by the Sung to Kao-ch'ang (the present Karakhodjo) towards the end of the 10th century. He notices a valley through which he passed (somewhere south-east of Kamul), in which, according to tradition, the K'itan had tended the herds of the Hui-hu (see Julien's M\u00e9langes de G\u00e9ogr. Asiat. p. 90). I notice this insignificant record, because it seems to me that the story M. Polo relates in two chapters (l.c. vol. ii, p. 9\u201412) about the Golden king taken prisoner by Prester John, and forced to look after cattle, might perhaps be traced back to this old Chinese tradition; M. Polo having merely changed the names. It is impossible to reconcile Polo's story with the history of the Kin. It is not without interest to observe, that the Y\u00fcan ch'ao pi shi relates the same story; but the Mongol tradition represents Wang khan (Ung khan, the same as Prester John, according to M. Polo, vol. i, p. 204) as having been made prisoner, together with his mother, by the Tatars, who forced them to tend their cattle (Palladius' transl. p. 76).\nThey are termed Wei-wu-r in the \"History of the Mongols;\" and this name was applied in the Yuan period, to the people living about the present Urumtsi, Turphan, Karakhodjo, etc. The accounts of the Uigurs found in the Yuan shi, consist generally of fragmentary statements scattered over the whole work, but met with especially in the biographies of distinguished Uigurs in the service of the Mongol emperors. Interesting details of their ancient history are given in chap. cxxii, in the biography of Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin, prince of the Uigurs in the days of Chinghiz. As the traditions related there show a remarkable coincidence with the accounts of the Mohammedan authors regarding the Uigurs; and as the Persian historians profess to have derived their information from the Uigur annals, there can be no doubt that the biographer of the Uigur prince was also acquainted with the historical records of the Uigurs. The biography of Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin reads as follows:\n\n\"\u4ea6\u90fd\u8b77 I-du-hu is the title of the kings of \u9ad8\u660c Kao-ch'ang (see further on, 111, and note 220), who in former times dwelt in the country called Wei-wu-r. There was in that country (where the Uigurs originally lived) a mountain called Ho-lin, from which two rivers take their rise, the Tu-hu-la and the Sie-ling-k'o. It happened once in the night time, that a stream of light fell from heaven upon a tree standing between the two rivers; whereupon the tree began to swell like a pregnant woman, and after nine months and ten days, gave birth to five boys. The youngest received the name Bu-k'o-han. He was afterwards elected king, and subdued the neighbouring countries.\"\n\nNotes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 31).\n\nCompare note 198.\n\nThe same title reads Iduhut in the Yuan ch'ao yi shi (see note 245), and Idicu in the Djami ut Tcvvarikh (see further on, 105). Compare also 98 supra, I-di-gien. Thus the T'ang shu calls one of the Uigur khans.\n\nHo-lin is the Chinese name for Karakorum. In speaking of the ancient territory of the Wei-wu-r, the Chinese biographer means the country about Karakorum.\n\nEvidently the river Tura and Selenga are meant.\n\nBu-k'o-han seems to be the same as the Pi-k'iie k'o-han of the T'ang\nsors was called Yu-lun di-gin. He was valiant and powerful, and frequently engaged in war with the T'ang emperor, who tried to form an alliance with him by marriage. A Chinese princess, named Kin-lien, was given in marriage to Go-li di-gin, the son of Yu-lun di-gin. She lived near Ho-lin, at a place called Bie-li bo-li da, meaning \"the hill, where the spouse lives.\" There was also another mountain called Tien-ko-li yu da-ho, meaning \"mountain of heavenly reason.\" South of it stood a mountain Hu-li da-ho, or \"mountain of happiness.\"\n\nWhen the envoy of the T'ang arrived at the frontier of the Wei-wu-r, he was told, that the supremacy of Ho-lin depended on the possession of the Mountain of Happiness;\u2014if the T'ang could destroy it, the power of the Uigurs would be broken. The Chinese envoy accordingly asked from the khan of the Uigurs, merely the Mountain of Happiness, as a price for the Chinese princess given in marriage; to which the khan agreed. As the hill was big, the Chinese made a great fire around and then poured vinegar on it. After it had been broken into pieces, it was placed on carts and carried away to China. Subsequently beasts and birds began to utter plaintive cries predicting mischief. Yu-lun di-gin died seven days after, and the empire was troubled by the outbreak of rebellions and calamities of all kinds. Several generations later, the dynasty of the Wei-wu-r was extinguished, and the people were compelled to emigrate. They removed their abodes to Xiao-chou, which is the same as Huo-chou, and occupied the whole country comprised under the name of Bie-shi-ba-li (Bishbalik). Their dominions then stretched to the north as far as A-shu (unknown to me), and south as far as Tsiu-\n\nshu (see above, 97), and the Buku khan of the Mohammedan authors (108).\n\n*13 Thirty is probably a misprint.\n\n*14 Tengri, in all Turkish dialects means \"Heaven;\" taq, means \"mountain;\" yuz, means \"modus, ratio\" (compare Klaproth's Mem. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, p. 841).\n\n*15 Kol in Turkish means \"accident heureux\" (Klaproth, l. c.).\n\n*16 Comparing this Uigur tradition with the statements in the T'ang history on the same subject, we find that they agree in the chief points; although there are some differences between them respecting the names of the khans and the Chinese princesses. Besides this, the Uigur accounts present some anachronisms. Goli digin, who\u2014according to Bardju's biography\u2014married the Chinese princess, is probably identical with the Go-le k'o-han of the T'ang shu.\n\n*17 \u9077\u4e8e\u4ea4\u5dde\u5373\u706b\u5dde\u7d71\u5225\u5931\u516b\u91cc\u4e4b\u5730. On Bishbalik and Huo-chou (Karakhodjo), see further on, 109, 111.\non the east they bordered upon Wu-tun and Gia-shi-ha, and on the west were contiguous to Si-fan. There they dwelt more than nine hundred and seventy years, up to the time of Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin.\n\n\"Ba-r-dju was a vassal of the K'itan (Kara-khitai), but after hearing (1209) that Chinghiz was about to move on an expedition to So-fang, he ordered the officers of the K'itan who were stationed in his country to be slain, and sent to Chinghiz to offer his submission. The emperor then sent envoys to the I-du-hu,\n\nAn ancient name for the present Su-chou, in Kansu. The district of Tsiu-ts'ian was established during the Han.\n\nIt seems to me that by Wu-tun, the same country is meant as the Hu-tun of the Kin shi (see note 24). Regarding Gia-shi-ha I may observe, that, according to Rashid, the Mongols called the Tangut empire Ka-shi (D'Ohson, tom. i, p. 95).\n\nTibet (see above, 93). At the time here spoken of (10th or 11th century), the dominions of the Tibetans extended much further north than they do now.\n\nThere seems to be a mistake again in the figure, owing to which Klaproth has fallen into a historical error respecting the early history of the Uigurs. Klaproth suggests, that, according to the Chinese authors, the country of Che-shi (pronounced also Ku-shi or Ku-sze), termed also Ku-she (Ku-sze), first mentioned in the Han history before our era, and known under the name of Kao-ch'ang at the time of the T'ang dynasty, was the seat of the Uigurs two centuries before our era (see M\u00e9m. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, pp. 821\u2014861). Klaproth always considers Ku-sze and Kao-ch'ang to be identical with the Uigurs; but no corroboration of this view can be found in Chinese works. The Chinese historians anterior to the Mongol period, call the Uigurs Hui-ho or Hui-hu; and in recording the history of the Ku-sze and Kao-ch'ang, they do not mention this people. As we have seen, the Yuan shi clearly states, that the Uigurs emigrated to Kao-ch'ang, only after the extinction of their empire in Mongolia. Klaproth was misled by Chinese statements of more recent date, that the country of the Wei-wu-r in the days of the Mongols, was the same as the Kao-ch'ang of the T'ang and the Ku-sze of the Han. This statement is quite correct, but it does not involve the occupation of this country by the Uigurs at so early a date. Julien in his M\u00e9moire de G\u00e9ographie Asiat. p. 103, gives a translation of the history of Kao-ch'ang, and always identifies this name with the country of the Uigurs. In the Chinese text he translated (from the Wen hien t'ung k'ao) however, the name of the Uigurs appears only once. Ma Tuan-lin, the author of the Wen hien t'ung k'ao, who wrote in the 13th century, states, that Kao-ch'ang was also called the country of the Hui-hu; for many Hui-hu or Uigurs were settled there. But he speaks of a time posterior to the T'ang and the destruction of the empire of the Hui-hu in Mongolia. At the time of the T'ang dynasty, Kao-ch'ang belonged to China, not to the Uigurs; and the Chinese changed the name into Si-chou (see article Kao-ch'ang in the T'ang shu, chap. clxviii). There is no doubt, that in the 10th century, Kao-ch'ang was inhabited by Uigurs. The \"History of the Sung\" records, under the year 965, that the khan of the Hui-hu of Si-chou sent a Buddhist priest with presents to the emperor of China.\n\nSo-fang means \"the northern regions (of China).\"\nwho was much delighted, and dispatched another embassy to Chinghiz with the following answer:\u2014\"Your servant has heard of Your Majesty. I hate the K'itan, and for a long time I have entertained the desire to submit to your power. Now that the message of Your Highness has reached me, I am happy to have an opportunity of accomplishing my desire; and I shall rejoice to hear, that all nations have acknowledged Your Majesty's supremacy.\" Chinghiz then attacked T'ai-yang han (khan of the Naimans) and T'o-t'o (khan of the Merkits).\n\n\"After the latter had been slain, his four sons (their names are given in the text) fled with the head of their father to the river Ye-r-di-shi (Irtysh). Then Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin joined (the Mongol army), and defeated and killed the four sons in a battle on the river Ts'an (Dsan).\" After this he sent envoys with valuable presents to the emperor; and when Chinghiz was encamped on the river K'ie-lu-lien (Kerulun), the I-du-hu arrived himself (in the spring of 1211, according to the Annals of the Yuan shi), and solicited permission to make a present of horses and dogs to the sons of the emperor. Chinghiz was moved by the I-du-hu's words; bestowed upon him his daughter Ye-li an-dun, and received him as his son. Subsequently Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin accompanied Dje-bie no-yen (see note 66) in the war against Han Mien-li so-tan (Khan Melik sultan) the chief of the Mohammedans. He distinguished himself at the siege of Ni-sha-bu-li (Nishabur), and (after returning from the west) took part in the expedition to Ho-si (the Tangut empire). He had previously crushed a rebellion of ten thousand men of his troops, who had been unwilling to submit to the new institutions. After his death the title of I-du-hu passed successively to his (eldest) son, grandson, etc. (I omit the details regarding his successor).\"\n\nThere are many other biographies in the Yuan shi, devoted to Uigurs of eminence in the service of the Mongol emperors. I will give their names, as they may perhaps present some interest.\n\n---\n\n*** See above, 34, and note 64.\n\n*** Rashid-eddin calls this princess Altun bigui (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 111).

Compare chap. cix, Table of the princesses, where another daughter of Chinghiz is styled Huo-ch'en bie-gi.

Let us turn now to the western medi\u00e6val accounts of the Uigurs. As to the records of the Persian historians on this subject, I invariably depend upon the excellent translations of D'Ohsson.\n\nAss\u00e9mani, the celebrated orientalist (1768), in his Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino Vaticana, states, that in the history of the Nestorians, the name of Ighur or Iaghur is often mentioned, and denotes the eastern Turks of Khatai (Klaproth, l. c.).\n\nAbulfaradj or Bar Hebraeus (1226\u20141286), in his chronicle (written in Syriac, and published in Latin in the middle of the 17th century at Oxford, under the title Historia compendiosa dynastiarum), p. 32, speaks of the prince of the Ighurs, who submitted to Chinghiz, and adds, that the Ighurs are a numerous tribe of the eastern Turks belonging to Khatai.\nIt seems that the Uigurs were not known by this name in western Asia before the beginning of the 13th century; but as Klapproth has proved, that long before this time they had extended their power far to the west, it may be assumed, that by the Turks and the khans of Turkistan,\u2014who according to the Mohammedan authors were often at war with the Samanids, Ghaznevids and Seljucks in the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries,\u2014we are to understand the western Uigurs.\n\nIn Deguignes' Hist. des Huns, tom. iii, p. 29, we read (he translates apparently from Abulfaradj), that in A.D. 993, Bogran Khan Harun, khan of the Turks, whose residence was at Bela-sagun,\u2014who reigned also over Kashgar, Khoten and Taras, and whose dominions stretched as far as the frontier of China,\u2014took Bokhara from Noe, sultan of the Samanids. His son Illik ilkhan waged war with the Ghaznevids (who had overthrown the Samanids), and in 1006, together with another khan called Cadar, advanced as far as Balkh (Deguignes, tom. iii, p. 163). Finally, Deguignes speaks (tom. iiiib, p. 252) of a khan of the Uigurs, Illik, residing in Bela-sagun, when the Kara-khitai arrived in 1125.\n\nIt seems that the Persian and Arabian historians of the 13th century applied the name Uigur,\u2014which in Mohammedan writings is first met with about this time,\u2014only to that branch of the Uigurs known to the Chinese and Mongols under the name of Wei-wu-r, and established in the eastern part of eastern Turkistan (Urumtsi, Turphan, etc.). The statements of the Mohammedan authors regarding the Uigurs, are as we shall see, in substantial accordance with what the Yuan shi records of the history of the Wei-wu-r.\n\n103. The Tarikh Djihan Kushhai gives accounts of the Uigurs in great detail. I present in the following, an English version of D'Ohsson's translation (tom. i, pp. 430 sqq.), omitting however, some unimportant particulars. The author of the Tarikh Djihan Kushhai\n\n---\n\n*** The Turks, mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the 6th to the 8th century, are the \u7a81\u53a5 T'u-k\u00fce. That nation, according to the Chinese authors, was in power in Mongolia and central Asia from the 5th to the 8th century. Their empire was destroyed by the Hui-ho or Uigurs, and the T'ang shu records, that about the middle of the 8th century, the Hui-ho conquered the land of the western T'u-k\u00fce and took their capital, situated on the river Su-ye (Chu). Compare note 57, on Bela-sagun and the Chu river.\n\n** Here, as usual, it is impossible to make out where Deguignes' information is drawn from. He feels no hesitation in asserting: \"Illik khan que les Chinois appellent Pi-le-ko.\" He means the khan of the Hui-ho, who came to meet Ye-l\u00fc Ta-shi when he started from Pei-t'ing (Urumtsi) and proceeded westward (compare above, 25). But the Liao shi, in the narrative of Ye-l\u00fc Ta-shi's wanderings, seems to intimate that Pi-le-ko resided in Kan-chou, not in Bela-sagun.\nfirst states, in the introduction of the article, that his information has been drawn from Uigur books; but signifies his disbelief in these tales, which he quotes only as a curiosity. After that he continues as follows:\u2014\n\n\"The Uigurs have a tradition, that they originally dwelt on the banks of the river Orkun,\" which takes its rise in the mountains called Karakorum, whence the name of the city, recently built by the khan (Ogotai), has been derived. Thirty rivers take their rise among these mountains, and thirty tribes dwelt on their banks. These Uigurs, who had their abodes in the valley of the Orkun, were divided into two tribes. After having considerably increased in number they elected a king, and five hundred years later Buku khan appeared. People say, that he is the same as Efrassiaab. There is among the mountains of Karakorum an ancient pit, called the pit of Pijen. The vestiges of a city and a palace are to be seen on the banks of the Orkun. The ancient name of this city was Ordu balik, but it is known now under the name of Mao balik. Before the palace are found some stones covered with inscriptions, which we have seen. In the reign of the khan (Ogotai) these stones were removed, when a pit was discovered, in which was a great stone tablet with an inscription. The emperor ordered it to be examined by people of different nations; but no one was found who could read it.\n\n\"Finally, the khan sent to China for men, who are called (the name is wanting in the manuscript;\u2014D'Ohsson supplies kames;\u2014see further on, 104). The inscription, which proved to be in their language and character, was as follows:\u2014\n\n\"At a place called Kumlandju, situated at the junction of the rivers Tugola and Selinga, which take their rise in the mountains of Karakorum, there were two trees close together; one of them a fistuk tree, resembling a pine, evergreen like a cypress, and with cone-like fruit; the other, a wild pine. Between these two trees\n\n---\n\n*** The Orkhon of our maps. Probably the Kun river of the T'ang annals is the same. See note 202.\n*** See note 209.\n*** The mountains around Karakorum in fact abound in water. All these rivers belong to the system of the Selenga.\n*** Efrassiaab is the name of a (mythical) king of the Turks, mentioned by the ancient Persian authors.\n*** Pijen is the name of a Persian hero, who was taken prisoner by Efrassiaab and kept for some time in a well. He was delivered by the famous Rustem.\n*** Ordu balik, means \"the city of the ordu, or residence of the khan.\" D'Ohsson translates Mao balik by \"mauvaise ville,\u2014ville ruin\u00e9e.\"\n*** The rivers Tura and Selenga;\u2014see above, 97.\n*** Fistuk, in Arabic means the \"pistacia tree;\" but the description given\na hillock appeared, upon which a stream of light descended from heaven; whereupon the hillock began to grow, and marvellous things were seen about it. Just after the lapse of the period of a woman's pregnancy, the hillock opened, and five hillocks resembling tents were seen. In each tent was a little boy; and to these boys the people paid the greatest respect. The youngest of them, called Buku tegin, was very intelligent, and subsequently the Uigurs made him their khan. The reign of Buku khan was very prosperous, and he was marvellously assisted by three ravens sent by Heaven. They knew all the languages of the world, and brought news whencesoever it was required. It happened once, that a spirit under the shape of a maid appeared to Buku khan in a dream, and conducted him to the mountain Kut tag. There they had conferences every night for seven years six months and twenty-two days. On the last night the maid took leave, and revealed to Buku that he would rule over the whole world. He then rallied his troops and sent his brothers to wage war against the Mongols, the Kirghiz, the Tanguts and the Khitai. All returned to the river Orkun with great booty and a large number of captives. After this the city of Ordu balik was built. Buku khan had\n\nhere does not agree with pistacia vera. Besides, this tree is not found in Mongolia.\n\nProbably the same as the Hu-li da-ho or \"Mountain of Happiness\" in the Chinese records;\u2014see note 214.\n\nIn the T'ang annals it is stated (see above, 97), that Gu-an-lu P'i-k'ie-k'ie k'o-han, in the middle of the 8th century established his residence on the river Kun (Orkun of the Turikh Djihan Kushai). I have no doubt that P'i-k'ie k'o-han is the Buku khan of the Persian records, and the Bu-k'o han of the Yuan shi (see above, 100). The ancient map of Mongolia in the Yuan shi lei pien (see above, 10), marks the city of Bo-ko han north-east of Karakorum. The existence of the ancient capital of the Uigurs, near the place where Karakorum was built, and of the ancient inscriptions there, is corroborated by the narrative of an expedition of the first Liao emperor to the north, recorded in the Liao shi, chap. ii. We read there:\u2014\n\n\"T'ai-isu (A-pao-ki, 916\u2014925), in 923, undertook an expedition through the ancient territories of the Shan-yii (the khans of the ancient Hiung-nu in Mongolia). On the first day of the 9th month he encamped near the ancient city of the Hui-hu, where he ordered a marble tablet to be erected, with the accounts of his victories engraved. He gave orders also to take water from the Kiu ho (Golden river), and stones from the Wushen (\"black hills,\" probably the Karakorum mountains), and carry them home on carts to the river Huang ho (the Shara muren in eastern Mongolia) and the mount Mu-ye (a sacred mount of the Liao, situated at the junction of the Lo-ha river and the Shara muren), to build a monument for posterity, to prove that the rivers and the mountains have come to offer tribute. On the 29th of the same month (the emperor sojourned still at the same place), he ordered the ancient monument of...\nanother dream, in which he saw a man dressed in white, who gave him a piece of jade, in the form of a pine tree, and said to him:\u2014As long as you are able to keep this piece of jade in your possession, you will rule over the four quarters of the globe. His minister had the same dream. Buku khan then directed his armies to the west, and arrived in Turkistan, where he established his residence on a beautiful plain, abounding in water and pasture. There he built the city of Bela-sagun, now called Gu balik (see above, note 57). In the space of twelve years Buku khan succeeded in subduing the whole world. His armies advanced as far as the regions where the people resembled brutes; and they were informed, that no inhabitants were to be found beyond. The kings of all the subdued countries were carried to Buku khan, who received them with benevolence; with the single exception however of the king of India, to whom an audience was refused, owing to his extreme ugliness. All were allowed to return to their countries after tribute had been imposed upon them. When Buku khan had completed this great enterprise he left Bela-sagun and returned to his native country.\n\n104. \u201cAs to the religion of the Uigurs at the time spoken of, they had certain magicians, which they called kam.\u201d The same are found even now among the Mongols. These magicians say, that they are possessed by demons, who inform them of everything they wish to know. Even now the greater part of the descendants of Chinghiz have the firmest faith in them. Nothing of importance is undertaken without consulting the astrologers. These kam also cure maladies. The Uigurs sent to the khan of Khitai\u2014an idolatrous country\u2014for the men called numi. These have a sacred book called num, which is their moral code,\u2014a collection of fables and tales interspersed with good precepts. Amongst many things it is enjoined, to abstain from injuring other persons, or even dumb animals. There are several sects of the numi, who differ in their dogmas. The most wide-spread is the sect believing in the doctrine of metempsychosis, etc. When the numi had arrived from Khitai, the Uigurs arranged a discussion between them and\n\n* * * P'i-k'o han to be restored. Besides this, an inscription was made in letters of the K'ti-lan, T'u-kile and Chinese, to glorify the seats of P'i-k'o han.\n\n* * * There can scarcely be any doubt that by kam, the shamans are meant, who up to this time sustain an important role in Mongolia and Siberia. As far as I know, the term kam is unknown at the present day; it was probably a Uigur word, and its existence at the period and in the regions here spoken of by the Persian author, is corroborated by the \"History of the T'ang.\" In chap. cclixb, article K'te-gia-sze (Kirghiz), we find a statement that in this country the fortune-tellers (or diviners) are called Kan (\u547c\u5deb\u70ba\u7518).\n\n* * * D'Ohsson renders numi, by \"lamas.\" He may be right. In modern Mongol, nom means \"a sacred book.\"\nthe kam, in order to test the respective merits of the two religions; but after the numi had read some chapters of their books, the kam could say nothing in reply. The Uigurs thereupon embraced the religion of the numi. Among all the idolaters of the east, these are the bitterest enemies of Islamism. We have not given more than the hundredth part of the absurdities found in the Uigur books, in order to show the ignorance and stupidity of this people. One of my friends told me, that he had read in a book, the above-related story of the two trees;\u2014with the explanation, that a man had scooped out the trunks of these trees, put his boys in the cavities, and placed a light in the vicinity.\n\n\"Buku khan was happy to the end of his life, and was succeeded by one of his sons. Subsequently the Uigurs observed, that all beasts, domestic as well as wild, and even the little children, uttered the words ghech, ghech,\\(^{440}\\) which means 'go away.' They took this for a divine command and emigrated; but the same sounds continued to be heard by the Uigurs, until they had arrived at the plain, where subsequently the city of Bishbalik was founded.\\(^{441}\\) There they settled and established five divisions, which they called Bishbalik (five cities).\\(^{442}\\) From that time the descendants of Buku khan have continued to rule over this country, and their kings bear the title Idikut. The above-mentioned trees were placed in their temples.\"\n\n105. Rashid-eddin gives some new information in his account of the Uigurs. The name Uigur, which means \"allies,\u2014auxiliaries\" in Turkish, he explains by the tradition, that Oghuz khan, the progenitor of all the Turk tribes, had bestowed this name on some of his relatives, who adhered to him when he was attacked by the others. Rashid states further:\n\n\"It is reported, that in the (ancient) country of the Uigurs, there are two ridges of mountains; one is called Bukratu turluk; the other Uskun luk tangrim. Between them are the mountains of Karakorum, the name of which has been given to the city built by Ogota\u00ef khan. Near the two chains there is yet another mountain called Kut tag (see note 236). There is in these regions,\u2014occupied\n\n\\(^{440}\\) Ghech, in Turkish is the imperative of the verb ghechmek \"to go away.\" (Klaproth, Mem. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, p. 341).\n\n\\(^{441}\\) It is not stated in the record of the Persian historian, at what time this emigration of the Uigurs took place; but as according to the Chinese accounts of the Uigurs, \\(P^c-k^c'e k^o-han\\) or Buku khan, lived in the middle of the 8th century,\u2014and the empire of the Hui-hu or Uigurs was destroyed in 840 by the Kirghiz,\u2014they probably emigrated to the T'ien shan after this event.\n\n\\(^{442}\\) I am not aware what D'Ohsson intended by,\u2014\"ils b\u00e2tirent cinq quartiers auquels ils donn\u00e8rent le nom de Bishbalik;\"\u2014it is not clear whether he means one city with five divisions, or five separate cities.\nanciently by the Uigurs,\u2014a country irrigated by ten rivers, and another with nine rivers. Those tribes who dwelt on the borders of the ten rivers were called On Uigurs; those who settled in the valleys of the nine rivers, Tokuz Uigurs. The following are the names of the Ten-rivers tribes, called also On Orkun:\n\nIshkil, in some MSS. Ishlik.\n\nOniguer (perhaps the river Onghin, south of Karakorum).\n\nTukair.\n\nUzkaider, in some MSS.

But (in 1209) Bardjuk, Idikut of the Uigurs (Ba-r-dju a-r-te di-gin in the Yuan shi) gave orders to kill the Kara-khitai governor in the city of Karakhodjo (see further on, 111), named Shukem, who was much disliked on account of his extortions. When Chinghiz had heard of this event, he dispatched two of his officers, Alb utuk and Derbay, to the Idikut. Bardjuk then sent two envoys to Chinghiz. (I may here quote D'Ohsson's original translation from the Djami ut Tevarikh):\n\n\"L'Idicut fit partir deux envoy\u00e9s charg\u00e9s de dire \u00e0 Tchinguiz-khan que, sur la renomm\u00e9 de sa grandeur et de sa puissance, il allait lui envoyer des ambassadeurs, pour l'instruire de ses nouvelles\n\n---\n\n*** On, in Turkish means \"ten;\" tokuz means \"nine\" (D'Ohsson).\n\n**** My identifications of the rivers here enumerated, refer to the excellent map of western Mongolia in Petermann's Geograph. Mitth. 1872, tab. 17. In the \"History of the T'ang\" (see above, 98) nine tribes of the Uigurs are enumerated. As these names have no resemblance to the names given by Rashid, it may be assumed, that the T'ang history records the names of the tokuz, or Nine-rivers Uigurs. The Yi t'ung chi, or \"Great geography of the Chinese empire\" states, that the Selenga has six sources and three affluents; but only the principal sources and affluents are enumerated there. The system of the Selenga abounds in watercourses.\nrelations avec le Gour-khan de Cara-khitai, lorsque l'arriv\u00e9e inattendue de ses envoy\u00e9s lui avait caus\u00e9 la plus agr\u00e9able surprise;\u2014que, de m\u00eame que les nuages laissent voir, en se dissipant, le soleil brillant d'un nouvel \u00e9clat, ou que la glace, lorsqu'elle \u00e9tait bris\u00e9e, d\u00e9couvrait l'onde pure et limpide, de m\u00eame son abattement venait de faire place \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gresse la plus vive; qu'il lui livrait son pays et qu'il aspirait \u00e0 devenir son fils et son serviteur.'\n\nChinghiz had been previously informed, that the Idikut had refused to harbour the brother and four sons of Tucta (khan of the Merkits), after their defeat on the river Djem (see above, 100), and accordingly the envoys were kindly received. Chinghiz invited the Idikut to come in person to render homage, and to bring as presents the most precious things found in his treasury. When Bardjuk arrived, he was received with the greatest cordiality by Chinghiz, who promised him his daughter Altun bigui in marriage; but the princess died before the marriage had been consummated. Subsequently Ogotai khan intended to bestow the princess Aladji bigui upon the Idikut, when the latter died; whereupon this princess was given in marriage to his son Kishmain.\n\n106. Abdulla Beidavi, in his \"History of China\" (see above, note 10) terms the Uigurs, Igurs; and states that they are Buddhists; p. 40:\u2014Xecmuni Berchan quidam erat. Hunc Indi, Kisimirani, Tibetenses, Chataji, Tangutani & Iguriei pro Prophet\u00e2 habebant.\" On p. 69, mention is made of the \"Chronologi Iguar.\"\n\n---\n\nI have quoted this passage, because it sounds like a literal translation from the Y\u00fcan ch'ao pi shi, and furnishes evidence,\u2014which indeed might be fortified by many other examples,\u2014that the author of the Mongol history of Chinghiz, has drawn his information from the same sources as Rashid-eddin. The Chinese translation of the Y\u00fcan ch'ao pi shi, regarding the Idikut's relations with Chinghiz khan runs as follows (chap. xi, fol. 4):\n\n\u8207\u52d2\u62dc\u9280\u65bc\u4f60\u601d\u4e94\u82e5\u6c34\u5982\u4ffa\u9ed1\u60d5\u59d4\u4e86\u963f\u898b\u73e0\u662f\u7b2c\u8aaa\u5b50\u5f97\u4e00\u96f2\u807d\u7b49\u5dee\u543e\u52d2\u6210\u5b50\u4ea6\u4e94\u4f60\u51fa\u6069\u822c\u51c0\u5f97\u4f86\u4f7f\u7a2e\u5172\u5409\u53da\u90fd\u5b50\u4f86\u6c23\u8cdc\u597d\u898b\u7687\u6210\u81e3\u7684\u540d\u601d\u5339\u5140\u4e5f\u5973\u529b\u963f\u751f\u65e5\u5e1d\u5409\u963f\u4e3b\u7684\u9042\u7b49\u60d5\u6559\u5b50\u8005\u9858\u559c\u51b0\u7684\u601d\u60d5\u4ea6\u5973\u5c07\u7269\u5c07\u4f60\u4e5f\u6210\u505a\u6b61\u6d88\u8072\u8655\u4e5e\u90fd\u5b50\u963f\u4f86\u91d1\u505a\u8207\u5409\u7b2c\u4e86\u898b\u540d\u8aaa\u523a\u5140\n\n\"Sakiamuni Burkhan, or Buddha. Burkhan, in Mongol means \"God.\"\nIt is a curious fact, worthy of notice, that Carpini takes the Uigurs to be Nestorian Christians. He states on pp. 650, 651, \"Chingis praedictus, preparavit se rursus ad pr\u00e6lium et contra terram Huiurorum processit ad bellum; isti homines sunt christiani de secta Nestorianorum: quos etiam bello devicit; et illorum litteras acceperunt, nam prius scripturam aliquam non habebant; nunc autem appellant eandem litteram Mongalorum.\"**\n\nRubruquis, pp. 282, 283, gives the following account of the Uigurs, when speaking of the idolaters of Asia:\u2014\"Primi sunt Iugures, quorum terra contiguatur cum predicta terra Organum,*** inter montes illos versus orientem; et in omnibus civitatibus eorum sunt mixti Nestorini et Saraceni, et ipsi etiam sunt diffusi versus Persidem in civitatibus Saracenorum. In predicta civitate Caalac**** habebant ipsi tres ydolatrias, quarum duas intravi ut viderem stultitias eorum. In prima inveni quemdam qui habebat cruciculam de atramento super manum suam, unde credidi quod esset christianus, quia ad omnia que querebam ab eo respondebat ut christianus. Unde quesivi ab eo: 'Quare ergo non habetis hic crucem et ymaginem Jhesu Christi?' Et ipse respondit: 'Non habemus consuetudinem.' Unde ego credidi quod essent christiani, sed ex defectu doctrine omitterent. Videbam enim ibi post quamdam cistam, que erat eis loco altaris, super quam ponunt lucernas et oblationes, quamdam yimaginem habentem alas quasi sancti Michaelis, et alias quasi episcoporum tenentes digitos sicut ad benedicendum.\"*****\n\nAfter this Rubruquis gives a detailed account of the worship of the Uigurs.\n\nHailon (the historian) in his Historia Orientalis (edition of M\u00fcller, Greiffenlag, p. 3), applies the name Tarsae****** to the country of the Uigurs, whom he terms Iogure:\u2014\n\nWith reference to the Uigur written characters, see Colonel Yule's Cathay, p. 205.\n\nThe country of Organum, of Rubruquis, seems to be identical with the present Ili. See my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 62.\n\nI think Colonel Yule is right in stating (Cathay, p. ccxii) that Kayalik or Caillac, may be placed near the modern Russian city of Kopal. See also note 271.\n\nThese particulars, recorded by Rubruquis, of the idol-worship of the Uigurs, explain Carpini's view, that they were Christians.\n\nTersa is a name applied properly by the Persians to the Christians. Colonel Yule thinks that its application to the Uigurs indicates the extensive prevalence of Nestorian Christianity among them. John of Monte Corvino, in a letter written in the beginning of the 14th century at Peking, and referred to by R\u00e9musat in his Nouv. M\u00e9l. Asiat. tom. ii, p. 198, speaks of Tarsic characters, meaning evidently Uigur letters. Archimandrite Palladius has proved (Russian Oriental Record, p. 23) that the term \u62dc\u5e08 Tie-sie, of frequent occurrence in Chinese works of the Mongol period, is intended to render the word Tersa. In Ch'ang-ch'un's narrative (Chin. Med. Trav. p. 31), a chief of the Tie-sie is mentioned in the Uigur country.\n\"In regno Tarse sunt tres provinciae quarum dominatores se reges faciunt appellare. Homines illius patriae nominantur Jogur, semper idola coluerunt et adhuc colunt omnes, praeter decem cognationes illorum regum, que per demonstrationem stellae venerunt adorare nativitatem in Betlehem Judae. Et adhuc multi magni et nobiles inveniuntur inter Tartaros de cognatione illa qui tenent firmiter fidem Christi. Istud regnum Tarse ex parte orientis suos habet confines cum regno Cathay, ex parte occidentis cum regno Turquestan, ex parte septentrionis cum quodam deserto, **ex parte vero meridiei cum quadam ditissima provincia qua vocatur Sym, qua inter regnum Indiae et regnum Cathay habet citum. Et in illa provincia inveniuntur lapides adamantis.\"\n\n107. In the Ming period, 1368\u20141644, the Uigurs were known to the Chinese under the name of Wei-wu-r, as in the days of the Mongols, and they then lived in the same countries as in the 13th century. The \"History of the Ming,\" in the section on foreign countries, gives some particulars regarding their location. They are mentioned as living in Ha-mi or Kamul (see above, 91), in Huo-chou and Liu-ch'eng (see further on, 112), and also as inhabitants of the three military stations or districts (wei) An-ting, A-tuan and K'\u00fc-sien. The position of these three wei is indicated in the Ming shi (chap. ccxxx, pp. 12\u201416); the first, 1,500 li south-west of Kan-chou; K'\u00fc-sien, to the east of An-ting; and A-tuan, formed originally a part of An-ting. It is further stated there, that An-ting at the time of the Yuan was called Sa-li wei-wu-r. This name occurs only once in the Yuan shi, in Subutai's biography (Yuan shi, chap. cxxi).\n\nCarpini, on p. 615, mentions Suri-Huiur among the countries conquered by Chinghiz.\n\nIt seems that even in our day, the Uigurs still live in the same countries they inhabited seven hundred years ago. At least the Yi t'ung chi of the present dynasty speaks of some begs of the Yugur (see Klaproth, M\u00e9m. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, p. 346). These countries are still unexplored; and all that we know of them is from Chinese sources.\n\n\u522b\u5931\u516b\u91cc Bie-shi-ba-li = Bishbalik.\n\n108. Respecting Bishbalik, we may infer from the statements of Persian authors, as also from Chinese accounts, that there was a city of this name in the middle ages; and at the same time it is clear that during the Mongol period, Bishbalik was a general term applied to the country of the Uigurs, comprising, as I have shown,\n\n* * * This desert, north of the country of the Uigurs, was crossed by Ch'ang-ch'un in 1221 (see Notes on Chin., Med. Trav. pp. 28, 29).\nthe present Urumtsi, the cities of Huo-chou, Luktsin, and other places south of the Celestial mountains. In the \"History of the Ming\" however, chap. cccxxxii, fol. 9, Bie-shi-ba-li is spoken of, in the 15th and 16th centuries, as a great kingdom in central Asia, bordering westward on the kingdom of Samarcand, southward on Y\u00fc-tien (Khotan;\u2014see 129), eastward on Huo-chou (see 111), and northward on Wa-la (the Eleuths). It comprised also Karashar and Kuch\u00e9. It is further stated there that Bie-shi-ba-li is distant north-west from Kia-y\u00fc kuan (see above, 41) 3,700 li (here probably the capital of the kingdom is meant). Bie-shi-ba-li, in the Ming period, had frequent intercourse with China, and several embassies of the khans of that kingdom are recorded.\n\nBy Bie-shi-ba-li on the ancient map, and in the list of the Si-pei-ti, the city of Bishbalik seems to be meant;\u2014not a country. A note explanatory of this name is found in the Si-pei-ti as follows:\n\n\"In the year 1278, Ba-sa-ch'a-li received a tiger tablet, investing him with authority to direct the military post-stations in Bie-shi-ba-li, the (other) cities of the country of the Wei-wu-r (Uigur) and Tze-li (a place unknown to me). In 1280 the wan-hu (commander of ten thousand) K'i-kung-chi (see his biography, Yuan shi, chap. clxv) was sent (by the emperor Kubilai) to guard the frontier at Bie-shi-ba-li. In 1281, the prince A-dji-gi requested, that thirty new post-stations might be established between the mountains T'ai-lo ling and Bie-shi-ba-li. In 1283, the emperor appointed a governor for Bie-shi-ba-li, Huo-chou and the other places (of Uiguria). In 1284, the prince A-dji-gi sent an envoy to the emperor with a memorial, stating that among the twenty-four cities formerly under the command of Dji-bi t'ie-mu-r, there were two, namely Cha and Dai, then governed by da-lu-hua-ch'i (daruyachi,\u2014Mongol governors) and annexed,\u2014not to (the province of) Bie-shi-ba-li, but to K'uo-duun (probably Khotan;\u2014see further on, 129). He prayed that they might be restored to Bie-shi-ba-li; to which the emperor acceded. In 1287, a military colony was established at Bie-shi-ba-li formed of a thousand of the troops which had recently\n\nA-dji-gi was,\u2014according to the Yuan shi, Geneal. tables, chap. cvii, cviii,\u2014a grandson of Chagatai, a son of Ha-la h\u00fc-lie (Kara Hulagu of Rashid). Adjigi is not mentioned by Rashid.\n\nIn the biography of Subutai, the name T'ai-lo ling (Mountains of Great peace) is applied to the Caucasus (see above, 60); but I do not think that the Caucasus can be intended here.\n\nDji-bi t'ie-mu-r,\u2014according to the Yuan shi, chap. cvii, Geneal. tables,\u2014was a grandson of Ogotai, and a son of K'uo-duun (Cotan of Rashid).\nsurrendered; to which also the commandery in chief (\u5143\u5e2b\u5e9c) for the whole country (of the Uigurs) was transferred.\n\nBie-shi-ba-li is repeatedly mentioned in the Yuan shi. This place it seems, played an important r\u00f4le in the war between Kubilai khan and the revolted prince Kaidu. Compare Yuan shi, Annals, under the years 1278 and 1284. Sometimes we meet in the Yuan history, the phrase, \"Bie-shi-ba-li and the other places.\" It seems, that the other cities of the Uigur country are meant, viz. Karakhodjo, Lu-gu ch'en, Ch'ang-ba-li, Ta-gu-sin, etc. (see further on). The term \u4e94\u57ce Wu-ch'eng (five cities), which is a literal translation of Bishbalik, meaning \"Pentapolis\" in Turkish, occurs also occasionally in the Yuan shi, to designate this place or country. Compare the note on A-li-ma-li, in the Si-pei-ti, where it is stated, that six thousand li north-west of Shang-tu (Kubila\u00ef's summer residence, in southern Mongolia) is \u90a3\u5140\u5152\u4e94\u57ce Wei-wu-r wu-ch'eng (five cities of the Uigurs), which at the time of the T'ang was called \u5317\u5ead Pei-t'ing, and was the seat of a governor-general (\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c). The term Wu-ch'eng or \"Pentapolis\" is found also in the biography of T'ie-k'o-shu, chap. cxxxv.\n\n109. Klaproth has already proved (M\u00e9m. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, pp. 355 sqq.) from Chinese sources, that Bishbalik of the medi\u00e6val authors is to be identified with the present Urumtsi, a city situated near the northern slope of the eastern T'ien shan. But I think this identification must not be taken \u00e0 la lettre, for all that can be proved is, that Urumtsi, a place still known only from Chinese descriptions, lies not very far from the spot where ancient Bishbalik stood. Klaproth's view is based upon a statement found in a modern Chinese work, that Urumtsi and Pei-t'ing of the T'ang are the same, and upon a passage in the Si shi ki, stating that the Ulungur river is five hundred li north of Bishbalik (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 69). It is corroborated by several ancient Chinese itineraries. Wang Yen-te's narrative of a journey to Kao-ch'ang permits us to determine the position of Pei-t'ing (see the translation of this narrative in Julien's M\u00e9langes de G\u00e9ographie Asiatique, pp. 86 sqq.). In A.D. 983, Wang Yen-te was sent by the Sung emperor T'ai-tsong to the king of Kao-ch'ang. The envoy, after crossing the desert, passed through \u4f0a\u5dde I-chou (Kamul;\u2014see 91), and arrived at \u9ad8\u660c Kao-ch'ang (Karakhodjo;\u2014see 111). The king of Kao-ch'ang is called \u7345\u5b50\u738b Shi-tze wang in the narrative; and Ma Tuan-lin states, that in the language of the country his name reads \u963f\u53ae\u862d\u6f22 A-sze-lan han.*\n\n* Ma Tuan-lin, the author of the well-known work Wen hien t'ung k'ao, where Wang Yen-te's narrative is found in chap. ccxxxvi, lived in the\nOwing to the great heat the king had retired to Pei-t'ing, and Wang Yen-te was invited to visit him in his summer residence. Before arriving at this place he had to cross a high mountain covered with snow (T'ien shan), by the pass called Kin-ling. The traveller states, that Pei-t'ing is situated in a long wide valley. In the time of Chinghiz khan and his successors, the great highway from Mongolia to western Asia passed through Bishbalik. Thus this place is mentioned by Ch'ang-ch'un in 1221, as a city on the northern slope of the T'ien shan (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 30). He was told by the people that its ancient name was Pei-t'ing. Ye-liu Ch'u-ts'ai in 1219 (l. c. p. 112) also passed through Bishbalik. He states that Huo-chou (Karakhodjo) lies five hundred li south of this place. Haithon's route (1254) likewise led through Bishbalik (see Appendix to this paper). Neither Carpini, Rubruquis, nor M. Polo speaks of it. Polo's way lay south of the country of the Uigurs; but the other two medieval travellers probably saw the capital of that country. The name of Bishbalik appears in Ibn Batuta's narrative (Yule's Cathay, p. 506). He states that when he arrived at Khanbalik, the khan was absent; for he had gone forth to fight Firuz, the son of his uncle, who had raised a revolt against him in the territory of Karakorum and Bishbalik.\n\nThe name of Bie-shi-ba-li is repeatedly mentioned in the biographies of the Yuan shi. Sometimes it appears under its ancient name Pei-t'ing.\n\nIn chap. cxxiv, we read in the biography of Meng-su-sze that he was a Wei-wu-r, and that his ancestors lived in Bie-shi-ba-li.\n\nIn chap. cxxxvii.\u2014T'o-lie-hai-ya a Wei-wu-r, was from Bie-shi-ba-li. Pei-t'ing is given as the native country of Bai-kiang (chap. cxxxii), Ch'a-han t'ie-mu-r (chap. cxli), Bu-lia-dun (chap. cxcv), and Bi-lan-no shi-li (chap. ccii).\n\n110. I may finally say a few words on modern Urumtsi. This is a Dzungar name which appears first in the Chinese annals in 1717. Compare the San chou ts'i lio, a topographical and historical description of the three districts of Hami, Turphan and Urumtsi. The Chinese write the name Wu-lu-mu-t's'i. After the army of the emperor K'ien-lung had conquered Dzungaria, in the middle of the last century, Urumtsi became better known to the Chinese; and the emperor built a new city at a distance of eight li from the ancient capital. In 1775 it received the Chinese name Ti-hua chou. On the great Chinese\n\n---\n\n12th and 13th centuries. Shi-tze wang in Chinese, means \"lion king.\" Arslan khan, in the Uigur language, has the same meaning.\n\nCompare the Si yu wen kien lu.\nmap of the empire, Wu-lu-mu-tse'i bears also the Chinese name \u970d\u57ce Kung-ning ch'eng; but this seems to be a mistake, for in Col. Wenyukoff's \"Review of the Russian frontier in Asia,\" an itinerary from Kuldja to Urumtsi is given (according to Russian merchants), in which Kung-ning is located twenty-two versts north-west of Urumtsi. On the same Chinese map, \u8fea\u5316\u5dde Ti-hua chou is marked about twelve li south of Urumtsi, and a third city Ti-hua ch'eng, about twelve li south-east of Ti-hua ch'ou. There may be some confusion about these names. Klapproth (l. c. tom. ii, p. 356) gives the latitude of Urumtsi 43\u00b0 60' N. (sic!), the longitude 87\u00b0 1' E. Paris; but Biot (Dictionnaire des noms anciens et modernes des villes etc.) has 43\u00b0 45' N. lat. and 86\u00b0 40' E. lon. Paris, for the same place. In the great Manchu calendar published every year in Peking, and also in the Ta ts'ing hui tien, published in 1818, 43\u00b0 27' is the N. lat. assigned to Urumtsi, and 27\u00b0 56' the W. lon. Peking. I do not know from what source these figures are taken. As far as I am aware, Urumtsi is not mentioned among the places astronomically determined by the old Catholic missionaries.\n\n\u5408\u523a\u706b\u8005 Ho-la-huo-djo = Karakhodjo.\n\n111. Karakhodjo is frequently mentioned by Rashid-eddin, as a place in the country of the Uigurs. Bardjuk, when he determined to submit to Chinghiz, gave orders to kill the Kara-khitai governor in Karakhodjo (see above, 105). At the end of his notices of Kathai, Rashid states (Yule's Cathay, p. 274), that one of the bodies of troops protecting the frontier of the Great khan is posted in the vicinity of Karakhodjo, a city of the Uigurs, which lies between the dominions of Kubilai and those of Kaidu and Dua (the rebellious princes), and maintains neutrality.\n\nThe Chinese name of Karakhodjo in the Mongol period was \u706b\u5dde Huo-chou (fire city); sometimes the name is also written \u5408\u5dde Ho-chou or \u548c\u5dde Ho-chou. In the Si yu ki, and also in the Si yu lu (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 29, 113), Ho-chou is stated to be situated five hundred li south of Bishbalik (beyond the T'ien shan), and is identified in the latter narrative with \u9ad8\u660c Kao-ch'ang of the T'ang (see note 220). In the Yuan shi, the same place is noticed several times under its different names. In the Annals, su\u00f0 anno 1286, it is recorded, that Kubilai ordered cattle and corn to be given to the people of Ho-la-hus-djo and Ho-mi-li (Kamul), who suffered from dearth. Karakhodjo is further mentioned in chap. cxxviii, in the biography of A-shu, who was a grandson of the famous Subutai. A-shu had been sent, in 1286, against a rebellious prince, and died in \u54c8\u524c\u970d\u5dde Ha-la-ho-djou.\nIn the biographies of the following distinguished Uigurs of the Mongol period, Kao-ch'ang (as I have stated, the ancient Chinese name for Karakhodjo) appears as their native country:\n\nChap. cxxxv, T'ie-k'o-shu; chap. cxliv, T'a-li-ma; ibid. Daotung; chap. cxcv, Ts'ian-p'u-an sa-li; ibid. Bo-lo t'ie-mu-r.\n\nIn the Ming shi, or \"History of the Ming,\" chap. cccxxix, fol. 19, Karakhodjo is spoken of in the following terms:\n\n\"\u706b\u5dde Huo-chou or \u54c8\u523a Ha-la (the characters huo-djo are omitted in the text) is situated seventy li west of Liu-ch'eng (see 112), and thirty li east of \u571f\u9c81\u756a T'u-lu-fan (Turphan). At the time of the Han dynasty, this place belonged to the kingdom of anterior \u59d1\u5e08 Ku-sze.\" During the Sui dynasty it belonged to Kao-ch'ang. After the T'ang emperor T'si-tsung (627\u2014650) had destroyed the power of Kao-ch'ang, the city of \u897f\u5dde Si-chou was established here. In the Sung period it belonged to the Hui-hu (here the Uigurs are to be understood). At the time of the Mongols it was known under the name of Huo-chou, and was comprised in the country of the Wei-wu-r (Uigurs).\"\n\nThe embassy of Shah Rokh to the court of China (1419\u20141422) passed through Turphan and Karakhodjo (Yule's Cathay, p. cc).\n\nThe city of Karakhodjo still exists; at least on the great Chinese map of the empire, a place \u54c8\u62c9\u548c\u5353 Ha-la-ho-djo appears about sixty li south-east of Turphan.\n\n\u9b6f\u53e4\u76e7 Lu-gu-ch'en = Lukchak.\n\n112. This name appears on the map east of Ho-la-huo-djo. In the Yuan shi it is only once noticed, in the list of places and countries of the Si-pei-ti. The \"History of the Ming,\" chap. cccxxix, fol. 18, gives a short note on this place, styling it \u67f3\u57ce Liu-ch'eng (willow city) or \u9b4f\u90e1 Lu-ch'en. It is stated there, that it is distant one thousand li from Ha-mi. At the time of the Han it was called \u67f3\u4e2d Liu-chung. In the T'ang period Liu-chung belonged to Kao-ch'ang.\n\nIt seems that in the repeatedly-quoted narrative of Wang Yen-te (A.D. 982;\u2014see above, 109), this place is also noticed; for the traveller is stated to have passed through the country of Lu-chung before reaching Kao-ch'ang.\n\n---\n\n*** The name of this kingdom is written also \u8eca\u5e2b Che-sze (pronounced also Ku-sze) in the Han shu. There were two kingdoms of this name, an anterior and a posterior. Compare note 220.\n\n*** Compare \"History of the Posterior Han,\" chap. cxviii, Si-y\u00fc, introduction. Since the year A.D. 123, the Chinese military governor of the Si-y\u00fc had his residence in Liu-chung.\nOn the above-mentioned modern Chinese map, we find a place \u9c81\u514b\u6c81 Lu-k'o-t's'in marked, sixty li south-east of Turphan and thirty li north-east of Ha-la-ho-djo.\n\nFurther details on this place, which is properly called Lukchak, may be read in Klaproth's above-mentioned article (l. c. tom. ii, p. 342).\n\n\u4ed6\u53e4\u65b0 T'a-gu-sin = Toksun(?)\n\n113. I know nothing regarding this place, marked on the ancient map between Kamul and Bishbalik. I may however observe, that on modern Chinese maps a city termed \u6258\u514b\u5b6b T'o-k'o-sun appears west of Turphan.\n\n\u5f70\u516b\u91cc Djang-ba-li = Djambalik.\n\n114. A city \u660c\u516b\u524c Ch'ang-ba-la is mentioned in Ch'ang-ch'un's narrative of travel in 1221, west of Bishbalik. The city was ruled by a Uigur prince (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 31). The name of a city Djang-ba-li appears also in the itinerary of Ye-l\u00fc Hi-liang (see Appendix). It is stated there, that it was east of the river Ma-na-sze. The latter name is still applied to a river and a city on the great highway from Urumtsi to Kuldja. Haithon on his way from Karakorum to western Asia, passed through Djambalekh, west of Bishbalik (see Appendix).\n\nOn modern maps we find between Urumtsi (ancient Bishbalik) and Manass, a town Ch'ang-gi (\u660c\u5409 on Chinese maps). Perhaps this may be ancient Djambalik. It is known that balik means \"city\" in Turkish.\n\n\u53e4\u5854\u5df4 Gu-t'a-ba = Khutukbai.\n\n115. Gu-t'a-ba on the ancient map is located west of Djambalik. I have little doubt that this place is the Khutukbai on Wenyukoff's map of western Mongolia (Petermann's Geogr. Mitth. 1872, map 17), the name of a river and a city west of Ch'ang-gi. The Chinese write the name \u963f\u56fe\u513f Hu-t'u-bi. It seems also that Gu-t'a-ba is identical with Haithon's Khutaiyai, mentioned in his itinerary between Djambalekh and Yankibalekh, of which I shall speak presently.\n\n\u4ef0\u5409\u516b\u91cc Yang-gi-ba-li = Yankibalik.\n\n116. On the ancient map, Yang-gi-ba-li lies west of Gu-t'a-ba. A place Yankibalik appears in Haithon's itinerary, west of Khutaiya. A city Yang bulgasun is placed on Wenyukoff's map, west of Khutukbai, and east of Manass. It lies also on the great\nhigh-way from Urumtsi to Kuldja. I may observe that *balgasun* (in Mongol) has the same meaning as *balik*, i.e. \"city.\"\n\n\u963f\u91cc\u9ebb\u91cc *A-li-ma-li* = Almalik.\n\n117. *A-li-ma-li*, the *Almalig* of the Mohammedan authors, is repeatedly spoken of by the historians of the Mongol era, and by the travellers of the same period, passing from western Asia to Mongolia or vice versa. With respect to this place therefore, I beg to refer to my *Notes on Chin. Mediev. Travellers*, and especially to pp. 33, 62, 71, 114, where some particulars about *A-li-ma-li* as given by Chinese travellers, will be found. As I have proved in that paper, *A-li-ma-li* in the 13th and 14th centuries lay on the great highway from Mongolia to Persia, and was situated near the place where modern *Kuldja* stands.\n\nIt seems, the Persian authors first mention Almalig in 1211, in recording, that *Ozar*, prince of Almalig acknowledged the supremacy of Chinghiz (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 111). This prince was afterwards slain by Gucluk, gurkhan of Kara-khitai; and his son *Siknak tekin* succeeded him on the throne, by order of Chinghiz, who gave to Siknak in marriage, a daughter of his son Djuchi. When the conqueror directed his army to western Asia, he was joined by Siknak (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 212). We know nothing more about Siknak and the fate of Almalik in the days of Chinghiz; but afterwards this place seems to have been the capital of the middle Mongol empire, or the empire of Chagatai. According to the *Tarikh Djihan Kushai* (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 100), Chagatai had his residence in the country of the Uigurs; but the same work states also (*l. c.* tom. ii, p. 100) that he was in the habit of spending the summer in the country of Almalik, near the high mountains Gueuk, and the mount Kut, whilst he preferred to pass the winter in Meruzik-Ila. Sometimes the residence of the khans of Chagatai is also called *Oluk iff* (*l. c.* tom. iii, pp. 119, 122). When Hulagu passed through Almalik (*Notes on Chin. Med. Trav.* p. 62) in 1253, he was well entertained there by the princess Organa, the widow of Kara Hulagu, the son of Chagatai.\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, Almalik sustained an important r\u00f4le in the struggle between the khans of the different branches of Chinghiz' lineage. When Kubilai ascended the throne,\n\n---\n\n*In the narrative of Tamerlane's warlike doings, a place *Gheuk topa* is mentioned (between Kashgar and the Ili river) near the Issikul lake (De guignes, tom. v, pp. 8, 18). Again, *l. c.* tom. v, p. 81, we read, that in 1390, Tamerlane sent an army to the country of the Getes. It passed by Tashkand, lake Issikul, *Gheuk topa*, the mountains *Ardjatu*, proceeded to *Almalig*, etc.*\nin 1260, his brother Arik-buga laid claim to the crown, and collected troops in the north. After he had been defeated by Kubilai, he went westward with the rest of his host and attacked Algu, who at that time ruled over the empire of Chagatai. Algu had been allied with Arik-buga; but after the defeat of the latter, had refused to assist him. Arik-buga's avant-guard, when first meeting with the troops of Algu, suffered a defeat near the city of Pulad (see further on, 122) and the lake Sult (Sairam lake). Algu then returned to his residence on the river Hil\u00e9 (Ili); shortly after which Arik-buga's army arrived, advanced through the defile called Iron-gate and took Almalik; when Algu retired towards Samarcand. In 1264, Arik-buga made peace with Kubilai, and in 1266, Kara Hulagu's son Mubarek shah became khan of the Uluss of Chagatai. The above details are taken from the Persian authors (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 340\u2014356).\n\n118. The Chinese annals record the war between Kubilai and Arik-buga, but not the struggle between Algu and Arik-buga. Alimali is for the first time mentioned in the Yuan shi, Annals, sub anno 1277, in connection with the war against Kaidu (see above, 85). This war, which was continued for about twenty-five years, caused much trouble to Kubilai, who was obliged to maintain a considerable army at the north-western frontier against his nephew. The expeditions against Kaidu are recorded in some detail by the Chinese authors as well as by the Persian historians. M. Polo also has devoted a chapter to the battles between Caidu and the Great Kaan (l.c. vol. ii, pp. 389 sqq.).\n\nAccording to the great traveller, in the year 1266, King Caidu and another prince called Yesudar made an expedition to attack the Great Kaan's Barons Chibai and Chiban, sons of Chagatai, and defeated them. In 1268, Caidu attacked the Great Kaan's son Nomogan, and George the grandson of Prester John, who were at Caracoron. The battle was without victory on either side; but Caidu hearing, that the Great Kaan was sending a\n\n---\n\n262 \u963f\u91cc\u4e0d\u54e5 A-li bu-k'o in the Yuan shi.\n\n263 Respecting the Iron-gate, situated in the Talki mountains north of Kuldja, see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 71.\n\n264 The name Ye-su-da-r occurs repeatedly in the Yuan shi. In chap. cxxix and cxxxiii, we find the biographies of two persons of this name. I am not however, prepared to identify the Yesudar of M. Polo.\n\n265 Perhaps M. Polo means by Chibai the prince Chi-bie t'ie-mu-r; who however, according to the Yuan shi, was a son of Ogotai. He is there mentioned as a general under Kubilai, and in connection with the war against Hai-du (Kaidu). As to Polo's Chiban, he may be identical with Rashid's Sarban, a son of Chagatai, mentioned in the record of Kubilai's war with Kaidu (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 452).\nlarge army to reinforce his son, retired to Great Turkey and Samarcan.\n\nThere are some discrepancies between the records of these events in the Chinese annals and those given by M. Polo; especially respecting the dates. I may quote some passages from the Yuan shi and the Yuan shi lei pien bearing upon this subject. The Si-pei-ti (Yuan shi, chap. lxiii) gives the following account of A-li-ma-li and the expeditions against Kaidu:\n\n\"The prince \u6d77\u90fd Hai-du had his encampment, (\u884c\u71df) in A-li-ma-li and the other places. Proceeding from Shang-tu (Kubilai's summer residence) in a north-western direction six thousand li, one reaches the Five cities (Bishbalik;\u2014see above, 108) of the Uigurs. Four to five thousand li further to the west lies A-li-ma-li. In the year 1268, Hai-du revolted, raised an army and went southward (evidently a mistake for eastward). Shi-teu (Kubilai) repelled his aggression near \u5317\u5ead Pei-t'ing (Bishbalik), and he was pursued as far as A-li-ma-li. Hai-du fled more than two thousand li beyond A-li-ma-li, and the emperor gave orders to discontinue the pursuit. At the same time he conferred the chief command of the troops in the country of A-li-ma-li, on the \u5317\u5e73\u738b Pei-p'ing wang. The latter was assisted by the minister \u5b89\u7ae5 An-t'ung.\"\n\n---\n\n*Kaidu's apanage was originally, it seems, at Kayalik, a place or country mentioned in the Tarikh Djihan Kushai (see further on, 121). It is the Cailac of Rubruquis. In the Yuan shi, Annals, sub anno 1252, it is recorded, that Mangu had ordered Hai-du to live in \u6d77\u62bc\u7acb\u4e4b\u5730, \"the country of Hai-ja-li.\"*\n\n*Pei-p'ing wang was the title of \u90a3\u6728\u7f55 Na-mu-han, the fourth son of Kubilai. In the short biographical note devoted to this prince in the Yuan shi lei pien, chap. xxx, fol. 16, we read that he was gazetted with this title in 1266. In 1282 it was changed into \u5317\u5b89\u738b Pei-an wang.*\n\n*An-tung of the Yuan shi is evidently the Noyan hantum of Rashid (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 452). His biography is found in the Yuan shi, in chap. cxxvi. It is stated there, that he was a great-grandson of the celebrated Mongol general Mu-hua-li, the conqueror of northern China. In the year 1275 he went with Na-mu-han, who was sent by the emperor to defend \u548c\u6797 Ho-lin (Karakorum) against Hai-du. They passed ten years at the northern frontier,\u2014were made prisoners by the revolted prince Si-li-ki,\u2014and finally returned to China in 1284. Detailed accounts of the treason of Si-li-ki and the seizure of Na-mu-han may be read in Du Mailla's History of China, vol. ix, p. 389; and Rashid's report on the same subject is given by D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 452 sqq. Si-li-ki (Shireki of Rashid), a son of Mangu khan was in the army of Na-mu-han, when he formed a conspiracy against Kubilai. Na-mu-han and An-t'ung were made prisoners by the conspirators, who directed their forces towards Karakorum; but the latter were defeated by Kubilai's valiant general Pe-yen. According to the Yuan shi, Na-mu-han was made prisoner by Si-li-ki in 1277, in the country of A-li-ma-li; but it is not stated when he was released.*\nIt seems, that in the expeditions sent by Kubilai against Kaidu, the armies of the Great khan advanced sometimes to great distances. Thus in the biography of Yu-wa-shi in the Yuan shi, chap. cxxxii, this general is stated to have given battle to Hai-du in the country of I-bir Shi-bir (Siberia;\u2014Rashid also speaks of the country of Ibir Sibir). Wassaf states, that in 1301, the hosts of Kaidu and Dua met with the army of the Great khan some days' journey distant from Kayalik; and adds, that this city was situated on the frontier of the two empires (I understand the empires of Dua and Kaidu). There Kaidu fought his last battle, for he died soon after (D'Ollsson, tom. ii, p. 516).\n\n119. Mention is made of Almalik by most of the medieval travellers who traversed central Asia. As to the reports of Chinese travellers respecting this place, I have already presented all the information I could gather about it in my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. It remains to review the statements of western travellers regarding Almalik.\n\nIn the narratives of Carpini and Rubruquis, a name like Almalik does not appear; but it seems that Rubruquis applies the name Organum to the country of Almalik, confounding the name of the princess Organa, who ruled over that country when Rubruquis passed through, with the name of her dominions (see Yule's Cathay, p. 522).\n\nHaithon, the king of Little Armenia, calls the city Halualek. He passed through it on his way home from Mongolia, before arriving at Ilanbalek and crossing the Ili river, in 1255.\n\nAlmalik in the 14th century was a Latin missionary bishopric, and it seems, also a metropolitan see of the Nestorian church (Yule l. c. p. ccxlv). Col. Yule (l. c. p. 231) reproduces a letter from a Franciscan missionary, dated at Armalec, A.D. 1338, in the empire of the Medes (the missionary means probably imperium medium).\n\nMurignolli was in Almalik in 1341, a year after the bishop and six Minorites had suffered martyrdom there. He terms the city Armalek (the capital) of the Middle Empire (Yule, l. c. p. 338).\n\nIbn Batuta (middle of the 14th century) speaks of Almalik as situated at the extremity of Maver-al-nahr (Transoxiana), near the place where Sin (China) begins (Yule, l. c. p. 503).\n\nPegoletti, in his notices of the land route to Cathay (first half of the 14th century;\u2014Yule, l. c. p. 288), reckons a distance of forty-five days' journey with pack-asses, between Oltrare (Otrar;\u2014see further on, 139) and Armalec, and a journey of seventy days from Armalec to Kamezu (Kan-chou) \u5361\u5dde.\n\nSultan Baber, who wrote in the beginning of the 16th century, speaks of Almalik, as of a city which did not exist in his time;\nhaving been previously destroyed by the Mongols or Uzbeks (Klapr. M\u00e9m. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, p. 137).\n\nThat is all I have been able to gather respecting ancient Almalik. As to its position, I find in the Russian translation of Ritter's Asia (by Mr. Semenoff, now Vice-president of the Russian Geographical Society), vol. ii, p. 96, a note by the learned translator, stating, that the ancient city of Almalik was situated forty versts west-north-west of the present Kuldja (New Kuldja), also in the valley of the Ili river. Mr. Semenoff speaks apparently from his own observation.\n\n120. Thus the ancient name Almalik, applied also to the country by medi\u00e6val writers, covers the territories which in our day are known under the name of Ili,\u2014\u4f0a\u7281 I-li\u00b2\u2070\u2070 of the Chinese; Kuldja being the capital of this province, conquered by the army of the emperor Kien-lung, in 1755. In the year 1264, a city was built by the Chinese on the right bank of the Ili river, not far from the spot where the Uklyk discharges into the Ili. It received the Chinese name \u60e0\u9060\u57ce Hui-yian ch'eng, but in Europe it is better known under its Dsungar (?) name, Kuldja. There was probably a city of this name before the Chinese built Hui-yian ch'eng. On the Russian maps it is designated New Kuldja, to distinguish it from Old Kuldja, located on the same maps also on the right bank of the Ili, about a hundred versts east of New Kuldja. The Russians call Old Kuldja also Tarachinskaya Kuldja; for soon after the conquest of Ili, the Chinese transferred to this place the Taranchi, a Turkish tribe from eastern Turkistan, who still live there. Old Kuldja is a small city of about four thousand inhabitants, whilst New or Manchurian Kuldja, the seat of the Chinese authorities, before the last Mohammedan insurrection, numbered sixty thousand inhabitants (compare Col. Wenyukoff's Review of the Russian frontiers in Asia, pp. 258\u2014262).\n\nThe earliest European account of Kuldja we owe to the Russian\n\n---\n\n*** The territories of Ili, Tarbagatai, Karkara usu, Urumtsi, etc. are known to our geographers under the general name Dsungaria. Dsun-gar in Mongol means the \"left hand,\" and thus the Mongols designate the most western branch of the Eleuths. The latter, as is known, constitute one of the great divisions of the Mongol nation. They were known in the Ming period to the Chinese under the name of \u8499\u53e4 Wa-la. In the Ming shi (chap. ccxxxviii, fol. 1); these are located to the west of the \u9054\u977c Ta-ta or \u8499\u53e4 Meng-gu (Mongols). In modern Chinese geographical works, they are styled \u7dad\u543e\u723e E-tu-t'e and the Dsungars, \u6ef4\u683c\u723e Djun-gie-r. The Kalmuks belong also to the Eleuths.\n\n** Kuldja kure or Dzianq-ghiun khoto (i.e. the city of the military governor) according to Putimtseff.\ntraveller Putimteff, who visited the place in 1811 (see above, 46).\n\nCountry of the Ko-r-lu = Karluks.\n\n121. Rashid-eddin,\u2014who traces the origin of the Karluks back to Oghuz khan, also the progenitor of the Uigurs, Kankalis, Kipchaks and other Turkish tribes,\u2014gives the following historical etymology of the name Karluk (see Berezin, l. c. vol. i, p. 19):\n\n\"It happened once, that Oghuz khan, when returning from an expedition, had to cross a high mountain. Owing to a great fall of snow, some families could not follow, and preferred to remain behind. Oghuz khan reprimanded them for their conduct, and henceforth they were derisively called Karluk,\u2014a name meaning in Turkish 'inhabitants of the snow.'\"\n\nRashid says nothing about the abodes of the Karluks; but it may be concluded from a statement of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai, that they dwelt not far from Kayalik. It is there recorded (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 111), that Arslan khan, chief of the Turk Karluks and prince of Kayalik, acknowledged himself a vassal of Chinghiz, who gave him a princess of his house in marriage.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, Annals, sub anno 1211, it is stated, that A-si-lan han from the Si-y\u00fc (western countries), the chief of the tribe Ha-la-lu, surrendered to Chinghiz.\n\nIn the Yuan ch'ao pi shi we read (Palladius' transl. p. 130):\n\n\"Chinghiz sent Kubilai (of course not the celebrated emperor) to subdue the people of the Kharluut, but their chief Arslan surrendered voluntarily, and presented himself to Chinghiz, who gave him one of his daughters in marriage.\"\n\nThe same is recorded in about the same terms by Rashid (Berezin, vol. i, p. 132):\n\n\"In the days of Chinghiz, the chief of the Karluks was Arslan khan. Chinghiz sent Kubilai noyen, of the tribe Berulass, to subdue the Karluks, but Arslan surren-\n\n---\n\n271 Regarding the position of ancient Kayalik, compare above, note 266, and Yule's Cathay, pp. cxiii, 576. Col. Yule is correct I think, in placing Kayalik near the present Kopal. Kayalik is also mentioned by Wassaf (see above, 87). It is an interesting fact, noticed in the Transactions of the Russian Geogr. Soc. 1867, I, p. 290, that in a tumulus (kurgan) in Kopal, an ancient gold ring with precious stones was found by a Tatar in 1857. This ring which was sold by the Tatar for 250 rubles, bore the inscription \"Arslan\" in Turkish letters.\n\n272 The marriage of A-r-sze-lan with a Mongol princess is also mentioned in the Yuan shi, chap. cix, Table of the princesses.\n\n273 This is the Mongol plural form of Kharlu.\n\n274 In the Yuan shi, chap. cvii (see also Yuan shi lei pien, chap. xxx, fol. 1), the Berulass are termed Ba-lu-la-sze. They were divided into the great and the little Ba-lu-la-sze.\ndered voluntarily to Kubilai; when Chinghiz gave him a princess of his house in marriage, and granted him the title Sart, i.e., Tadjik, observing that it was impossible to give him the title khan. Arslan khan accompanied Chinghiz in the expedition to western Asia (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 212).\n\nIt seems that the Chinese annals mention the Karluks as early as the 7th or 8th centuries. In the \"History of the T'ang,\" chap. ccvii, there is a long article on the \u9435\u52d2 T'ie-le, a people inhabiting western Mongolia and central Asia. It was divided into many tribes, which are all enumerated. The Hui-ho or Uigurs also are stated to belong to the T'ie-le. One of these tribes is termed \u5580\u9081\u797f Ko-lo-lu, and said to be descended from the T'u-k\u00fce (Turks). The T'ang shu assigns to the Ko-lo-lu the mountainous country north-west of Pei-t'ing (Urumtsi), near the river \u5091\u500b\u632f P'u-ku-ch'en. There are in their country many cross mountain ridges. We have seen, that according to the Chinese history of the Uigurs (see above, 98), when that people was dispersed by the Kirghiz in the 9th century, P'ang-t'e-le with fifteen aimaks fled to the Ko-lo-lu. It is very probable, that the Ko-lo-lu of the T'ang period were the Karluks. Our ancient map assigns to them the country north-east of A-li-ma-li.\n\nI have no doubt, that the Corola mentioned by Carpini, p. 709, among the nations and tribes of central Asia means the Karluks.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, the Karluks are generally termed Ha-la-lu. In chap. cxxxiii, biography of Ye-han di-gin, the name is written \u5308\u523a\u9b6f Hia-la-lu. Ye-han di-gin, who was a general under Kubilai, belonged to this nation. It is stated in his biography, that his grandfather, by name Hia-ta-r mi-li, was in the country of \u5e72\u601d\u5805 Wa-sze-gien (Uzgend;\u2014see further on, 133), with three thousand troops of the Hia-la-lu, when Chinghiz invaded western Asia. He came to the emperor to surrender, and presented a great number of cattle and sheep. Ye-han di-gin's father was called Ye-mi huo-dji;\u2014his sons, Ho-na-ch'i di-gin and Ye-su-sha. These were all in the service of the Mongol emperors.\n\nSha-teiian (biography in chap. cxxxii) was also a Ha-la-lu or Karluk. His father Sha-di had been a general under Chinghiz, and distinguished himself in the war with the Kin.\n\nIn chap. cxc, Ha-la-lu appears again as the native country of Bo-yen (see note 74).\n\n---\n\nD'Ohsson, who translates the same passage (tom. i, p. 218), writes Arslan Siraki (le Syriaque), instead of Arslan Sart. There was probably a clerical error in his text. We have seen above (41) that Sartol was the Mongol name for the Mohammedan people. Thus they are always termed in the Yuan ch'ao pi shi.\n122. This is without doubt the city of Pulad of the Persian authors, mentioned in connection with the war between Algu and Arik-buga (see above, 117), and situated near the lake Sult. Haithon, when proceeding homeward from Mongolia, passed through Pulad, and then arrived at the lake Sutkul (the lake Sairam;\u2014see Haithon's itinerary in the Appendix to this paper).\n\nRashid-eddin, enumerating the countries and places inhabited by Turk tribes, also mentions Pula (Berezin, l. c. vol. i, p. 2).\n\nRubruquis, when speaking of the Germans (Teutonicici) in the service of Buri (see above, 81) says (p. 280):\n\n\"De illis Teutonicis nichil potui cognoscere usque ad curiam Manguchan......Quando veni in curia Manguchan intellecti quod ipse Mangu transtulerat eos, de licencia Batu, versus orientem (they had been before in Talas) spacio itineris unius mensis a Talas, ad quamdam villam que dicitur Bolat, ubi fodiunt aurum et fabricant arma, unde non potui ire nec redire per eos.\"\n\nAs to the Chinese medieval authors who mention this place, I may quote Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-t'ei, who accompanied Chinghiz to western Asia. He states in his narrative (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 113, 114), that \"at a distance of more than a thousand li (westward), after having crossed the han-hai, one arrives at the city of Bu-la. South of this city is the Yin-shan mountain......On the top of the mountain is a lake.\"\n\nIn the itinerary of Ye-l\u00fc Hi-liang the name of the same city Bu-la appears again (see Appendix to this paper).\n\nThe city of Bo-lo, through which Ch'ang Te came, before crossing the defile T'ie-mu-r ts'an-ch'a (in the Talki mountains), seems also to be identical with Pu-lad (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 70). Pulad was situated evidently on the great highway from Mongolia to Persia. As Rubruquis states expressly that Bulat lay out of his way, his route was probably more to the north than that of the Chinese travellers.\n\n123. Ye-mi-shi is placed on the ancient map to the north-east of P'u-la; and I feel no hesitation in identifying it with Emil or Imil, the name of a river and a city, repeatedly mentioned by the Chinese as well as by the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period. There can be no doubt that the character shi in the name is a misprint or clerical error; for the Yuan shi writes the name Ye-mi-li. There is still a river Emil, south of Chuguchak, emptying itself into the lake Alak-kul.\nWe have seen (above, 33) that the Kara-khitai on their peregrinations to the west, had founded a city in the country of Imil. This explains Carpin's statements, p. 648:\n\n\"In terr\u00e2 autem predictorum Kara-Kitaorum Occoday-can filius Chinghis-can, postquam positus fuit imperator, quandam civitatem \u00e6dificavit, quam Omyl appellavit.\"\n\nIbidem, p. 751:\u2014\"Deinde terram nigrorum Kitaorum fuimus ingressi; in qu\u00e2 tantum de novo unam civitatem \u00e6dificaverunt, quae Omyl appellatur; ubi Imperator domum \u00e6dificavit, in qu\u00e2 vocati fuimus ad bibendum; etc.\"\n\nI have been informed by Russian travellers, that in the valley of the river Imil, famed for its pastures, the ruins of an ancient city can still be seen.\n\nThe Mohammedan authors state (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 323), that Chinghiz khan, when returning in 1224 from western Asia, passed by the river Imil, where he was met by his grandsons Kubila\u00ef and Hulagu.\n\nAccording to the Tarikh Djihan Kushai, Ogotai the second son of Chinghiz had his apanage on the river Imil; and Ogotai's son Kuyuk,\u2014Great khan, 1246\u20141248,\u2014left the Mongol capital (Karakorum) in the spring of 1248, and set out for his apanage on the river Imil, where he hoped the climate would better agree with the broken state of his health; but he died when seven days' journey from Bishbalik the capital of the Uigurs (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 2, 234).\n\nA place or country Ye-mi-li is mentioned three times in the Yuan shi. In chap. cxxi, in the biography of Su-bu-tai we read, that after having accomplished the conquest of the countries north of the Caucasus (see above, 60), he went home by the way of \u8449\u5bc6\u7acb Ye-mi-li and \u970d\u53ea Ho-dji.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, Annals, sub anno 1252, it is stated, that \u8131\u8131 T'o-t'o was ordered by the emperor Mangu to live in the country of \u8449\u5bc6\u7acb Ye-mi-li.\n\n---\n\nI may observe, that in the Annals of the Yuan shi, it is stated, that after the death of Chinghiz, his son Ogotai arrived from the country of \u970d\u535a Ho-bo. It seems that this country was somewhere near Imil. At least in the itinerary of Ye-l\u00fc Hi-liang, a country \u706b\u5b5b Huo-bu is mentioned after \u8449\u5bc6\u7acb (Imil).\n\nYe-mi-li, as I have stated is intended for Imil; but as to Ho-dji, coupled with Ye-mi-li, I cannot identify it. I may however observe, that in the history of Tamerlane, translated by Petis de la Croix, the royal (summer) residence of Mogolistan (not to be confounded with Mongolia proper; here the eastern branch of the Chagatai empire is meant), taken in 1389 by Tamerlane, is called Aymul Guya (Yule's Cathay, p. 524). This name has some resemblance to the Chinese Ye-mi-li Ho-dji.\n\nT'o-t'o, according to the Yuan shi, chap. cvii, Genealogical table,\nThe name of the country of Ye-mi-li occurs in the biography of Ye-l\u00fc Hi-liang (Yuan shi, chap. clxxx). See Appendix.\n\n\u4ea6\u523a\u516b\u91cc I-la-ba-li = Ilbalik.\n\n124. This name represents probably Ilbalik or \"the city of Ili.\" On the map it appears to the south-west of A-li-na-li. Haiton, proceeding from Almalik westward, arrived at Ilan-baleck and then crossed the Ilan (Ili) river.\n\nThis seems to be the only instance, that any medieval author mentions a city of this name. The city was evidently situated on the Ili river, perhaps at that place, where on the Russian maps Iliskoye (scil. Selenie), the borough of Ili, is marked, south-west of Kul'dja, on the river Ili.\n\nIn the \"Ming History,\" chap. cccxxii, fol. 12, 13, a country of \u8d64\u529b\u628a\u91cc I-li-ba-li is mentioned west of the kingdom of Bie-shi-ba-li. It is stated there, that in 1418, the ruler of the kingdom of Bie-shi-ba-li had been slain by his younger brother, who after this declared himself king, emigrated with his tribe to the west, and changed his national designation to I-li-ba-li. This is probably the reason that the Ming yi t'ung chi, or \"Geography of the Ming empire\" confounds I-li-ba-li with Bie-shi-ba-li.\n\n\u4e5f\u4e91\u8d64 Ye-y\u00fcn-ch'i.\n\n125. It is impossible to identify this name, which on the ancient map is marked west of I-li-ba-li. I may however observe, that a similar-sounding name appears, as that of a river, in the Si shi ki (compare my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 74).\n\nIn this narrative, a river \u8d64\u904b Yi-y\u00fcn is mentioned in the country of the Kara-khitai, somewhere near the river Chu.\n\n\u82e6\u706b K'u-ch'a = Kucha.\n\n126. Here the city of Kucha in eastern Turkistan is meant. On modern Chinese maps the name is written \u5ee3\u8eca K'u-ch\u00e9.\n\nRashid-eddin records (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 105), that Guchluk, the son of the khan of the Naimans, after having been defeated by the Mongols, fled through Bishbalik and Kudja to the khan of Kara-khitai. Under the article Sunit, Rashid mentions a corps\n\nwas a grandson of Ogotai and son of Ha-la-ch'a-r. The latter is mentioned by Rashid (l. c. tom. ii, p. 99) under the name of Karadjar; but T'o-t'o, it seems, is not spoken of by the Persian historians.\n\n\u81ea\u7acb\u5f9e\u5176\u90e8\u843d\u897f\u53bb\u66f4\u570b\u865f\u65e5\u4ea6\u529b\u628a\u91cc.\nof the Mongol army composed of Uigurs, Karluks, Turkmans, and men from Kashgar and Kuchai (Berezin, l. c. vol. i, p. 46).\n\nIt seems that Kucha is not mentioned by the Chinese authors of the Ming period. It is only since last century that the name appears again in Chinese geographical works (see note 284). Modern Chinese geographers identify \u5ee3\u8eca K'u-ch\u00e9 with the ancient \u9f8d\u57ce Kui-tze, a kingdom in central Asia, first mentioned in the \"History of the Anterior Han,\" before our era.\n\n\u502d\u8d64 Wo-ch'i = Uch or Ush.\n\n127. This name is assigned on the map to a place between Kucha and Kashgar. It may be identified with the modern city of Uch (thus the name is written on Russian maps; on English maps it is written Ush) in eastern Turkistan, west of Aksu, situated on the great highway from Kamul to Kashgar, south of the T'ien shan. On modern Chinese maps the name is written \u70cf\u4ec0 Wu-shi. The emperor K'ien-lung,\u2014who after the conquest of eastern Turkistan and Ili in the last century, bestowed Chinese names upon the principal cities there,\u2014named Uch, \u6c38\u5be7\u57ce Yung-ning ch'eng.\n\nThe ancient Chinese map and the list in the Si-pei-ti are, it seems, the only instances in which Ush is mentioned in Chinese works of the Mongol time; but there is a place with a name sounding like Ush, in the \"History of the Ming.\" There is however no doubt that Ush was known in the days of Tamerlane. In the narrative of his expedition to eastern Turkistan, in 1375, the place is called Utche-ferman (Deguignes, tom. v, p. 8). It is stated there, that it lies east of Kashgar. We read further (l. c. p. 30), that Tamerlane, who was with his army at Yulduz, sent his son Omer Sheikh back to Andekan (written also Andidjan) in Fergana. He went by the Kaluga (Iron-gate), Couzan (probably Kucha is meant) and Utche-ferman (Uch), and arrived at Andekan. The modern Chinese geographers identify Uch with the kingdom of \u5c04\u982d Yu-t'ou mentioned in the histories of the Han (see further on, note 284).\n\n\u516b\u91cc\u832b Ba-li-mang.\n\n128. I can make nothing of this name, which is placed on the map north of Wo-ch'i or Uch.\n\n---\n\n* * * Yulduz is still the name of a river in the country north-east of Kucha. It is an affluent of the Kaidu, which discharges into the Bosteng nor near Karashar. Shah Rokh's ambassadors passed a place named Yulduz in 1420 on their way to Turphan and Kamul.\n\n* * * Not to be confounded with the defiles south of Samarcand and north of Kuldja respectively, which in ancient records are also called Iron-gate.\nHu-t'an = Khotan.\n\n129. Khotan, a city and country of eastern Turkistan, was well known to the Chinese, as also to western people, in the middle ages.\n\nThe most ancient notice of Khotan by Mohammedan authors occurs it seems, in the Tarikh Tabari, the great chronicle written in the 10th century. There it is reported, that Kataiba, the valiant general of the calif Valid, 707\u2014715, sent envoys to Khotan. The king of this country dispatched four of his sons to Kataiba, who carried with them much tribute, and also earth from Khotan, upon which Kataiba might tread to make his oath.\n\nI will not enter into details respecting the history of Khotan; for a special pamphlet has been devoted to this subject by Abel R\u00e9musat (Histoire de la ville de Khotan, tir\u00e9e des annales de la Chine). I may therefore confine my remarks to a brief notice of what is generally known of the place, with the addition of some new information from Chinese sources.\n\nIn the \"History of the Anterior Han,\" chap. xcvii, where Khotan is first mentioned in Chinese works,\u2014in the second century before our era,\u2014this kingdom is styled \u7389\u95d5 Y\u00fc-tien; and Khotan is spoken of under the same name in all the succeeding Chinese dynastic histories up to our own day. Sometimes, and especially in modern Chinese works, the name is written \u7389\u95d5\u7389\u95d5 Y\u00fc-tien. The first character means \"jade\" in Chinese, and was chosen probably in allusion to the fame which Khotan has had from the most ancient time for its fine jade, so highly prized in China. Y\u00fc-tien or Khotan was visited by the Buddhist monk Fa-hien, on his way to India, A.D. 400 (see R\u00e9musat's translation of the Fo\u00eb ku\u00f6 ki).\n\nIn the \"History of the T'ang,\" chap. ccviii, the following synonyms for Y\u00fc-tien are given: \u85cd\u862d\u4e14\u90a3 K\u016b-sa-tan-na, \u6f22\u90a3 Huan-na and \u5c45\u4e39 K'\u00fc-tan. The first of these names is the Sanscrit name of Khotan. Under this name it appears also in the narrative of Huan-tsang in the 7th century (Julien, M\u00e9m. s. l. Conr\u00e9es Occid.). By K\u016b-tan, the Turkish (?) name Khotan seems to be rendered. Besides this, the T'ang shu states that the northern nomades \u5317\u72c4 call the same realm \u7389\u9053 Y\u00fc-tun, whilst western people \u80e1 term it \u80e1\u4e14 Huo-tan.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, Khotan is repeatedly mentioned, but seldom by its Chinese name Y\u00fc-tien. The Chinese historians of the Mongol period generally try to render the name Khotan, which was in use with the Mongols.\n\nIn chap. cxx, in the biography of Ho-sze-mai-li, it is stated, that after the khan of Kara-khitai had been slain (see above, 34), the\ncities of \u53ef\u5931\u54c8\u5152 K'o-shi-ha-r (Kashgar), \u6291\u5152\u79e6 Ya-r-k'ien (Yarkand) and \u9102\u7aef O-duan (Khotan) surrendered. Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-tsa\u00ef (see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 113) writes the same name \u4e94\u7aef Wu-duan, and adds that this is the same as the Y\u00fc-tien of the T'ang.\n\nIn the Annals of the Yuan shi, sub anno 1274, we read \u7acb\u4e8e\u95cd\u9d09\u5152\u770b\u5169\u57ce\u6c34\u9a5b\u5341\u4e09\u6284\u5dde\u5317\u9678\u9a5b\u4e8c, \"Thirteen water-stations (on rivers of course)\" were established (by imperial order) between the two cities Y\u00fc-tien (Khotan) and Ya-r-k'ian (Yarkand), and two land-stations north of Sha-chou (see above, 90). On the same page, the Annals state, that the people of Y\u00fc-tien were relieved from the onus of collecting jade.\n\nUnder the same year it is recorded, that the emperor bestowed the sum of one hundred liang of silver upon each family of the two hundred and forty-nine soldiers from \u5408\u5931\u54c8\u5152 Ho-shi-ha-r, \u9d09\u5152\u770b Ya-r-k'ian and \u9102\u7aef Wu-duan (Khotan), who were killed at the siege of Siang-yang fu and Fan-ch'eng.\n\nUnder the year 1271, Khotan is also termed Wa-duan.\n\nUnder the year 1288, mention is made of a military colony composed of workmen from Ka-shi-ha-r and \u9102\u7aef O-duan.\n\nOn modern Chinese maps, and in Chinese geographical works published in the last century, Khotan appears under the names of \u548c\u95d0 Ho-tien and \u4f0a\u91cc\u9f4a I-li-tsi'i. Ilchi or Elchi is indeed, as we know from the reports of modern European travellers, the real name of the capital of Khotan.\n\nKhotan is frequently mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the middle ages. It was famed in the west for its musk (Bibl. Orient. art. \"Khotan\"), as well as for its jade (Klaproth, M\u00e9m. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, p. 289).\n\nIn the beginning of the 13th, and probably also in the 12th century, Khotan, Kashgar, Yarkand and the other cities of eastern Turkistan belonged to the dominions of the gurkhan of Kara-khitai (D'Ohsson, tom. i, pp. 170 sqq.). In 1218 the empire of the Kara-khitai was destroyed, and the Mongols took possession of eastern Turkistan, which after Chinghiz' death reverted to Chagatai. It seems, however from the above quotations, selected from the Yuan shi, that M. Polo may be right in stating (vol. i, p. 173), that the people of Cotan are subject to the Great khan. During the struggle between Kubila\u00ef and the Great khan, the latter may\n\n---\n\n*** It seems that communication by water was established between Khotan and Yarkand. Both places are situated on rivers, affluents of the Tarim. Or perhaps there was a direct watercourse connecting the two cities.\n\n*** Siang-yang fu had been taken by the Mongols in March, 1278. Fan-ch'eng is a town situated opposite Siang-yang, on the left bank of the Han.\nhave taken possession of the eastern part of the middle empire.\n\n\u53ef\u5931\u54c8\u8033 K'o-shi-ha-r = Kashgar.\n\n130. Kashgar also is often mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the middle ages. The earliest occurrence of the name in their writings seems to be in Firdusi's \"History of Persia\" (Deguignes, tom. ii, p. 333). Under the reign of Anushirvan (531\u2014579), Firdusi states, that a khan of China proceeded with his host to Transoxiana and defeated the khan of the Turks, who were in possession of this country. Anushirvan married the daughter of the khan of China, who then retired to Kashgar. Of course khan of China here is not to be taken \u00e0 la lettre.\n\nDeguignes further states (tom. iii, p. 219) on the authority of the Mohammedan authors, that the king of Kashgar came to Urkend (Uzgend) to render hommage to Malek shah of the Seldjuks (end of the 11th century).\n\nIn Chinese works, the name Kashgar first appears in the Mongol period, and as we have seen, in the Yuan shi, this name is generally found associated with Khotan and Yarkand (see 129).\n\nIn the itinerary of Ye-l\u00fc Hi-liang (see Appendix), the name of Kashgar is written \u53ef\u5931\u54c8\u91cc K'o-shi-ha-li.\n\nIn the \"History of the Ming,\" chap. cccxxxii, fol. 20, \u54c8\u5bc6\u54c8\u5152 Ha-shi-ha-r is mentioned as a small country in the Si-yu, which used to send embassies to the Chinese court.\n\nYarkand, although repeatedly noticed in the Yuan shi (see above),\u2014and the name of a city \u4e5f\u91cc\u8654 Ye-li-k'ien is also found in the itinerary of Ye-l\u00fc Hi-liang,\u2014has been omitted from the ancient map; neither is it found in the list of the Si-pei-ti. It seems that Yarkand is not spoken of in the Ming shi.\n\nI may finally mention concerning Kashgar and Yarkand, that both names appear in the itinerary of M. Polo. Compare vol. i, pp. 169, 173, on the kingdom of Cascar and the province of Yarcan. Col. Yule observes, that Yarkan or Yarken seems to be the general pronunciation of the name, though we write Yarkand. The Chinese medi\u00e6val authors also write Yarkan or Yerkien, as I have shown. M. Polo reports, that in his time Yarcan belonged to Caidu, whilst Cascar was subject to the Great Kaan. Col. Yule justly observes, that this statement is not easy to understand. Perhaps by the above-quoted fragmentary accounts from the Yuan shi, some new light may be thrown on the subject.\n\nKashgar (Kashimgar) was, it seems, a metropolitan see of the Nestorian church in the middle ages (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxlv).\n\nOn modern Chinese maps, Kashgar is styled \u5580\u4ec0\u5676\u723e\nK'o-shi-go-r, and Yarkand, \u8449\u723e\u7f8c Ye-r-k'iang. Kashgar is identified by the geographers of the present dynasty with the country \u758f\u52d2 Shu-le, mentioned in the histories of the Han; Yarkand with the ancient country \u838e\u8eca So-ku. Although the modern Chinese geographers in their identifications generally draw on their imagination, they may perhaps be right respecting Shu-le; for in the \"History of the T'ang,\" chap. ccviii, where Shu-le is also spoken of, it is stated, that at that time the capital of this country was \u9054\u5e2b Kia-shi. This name has at least some resemblance to Kashgar.\n\n\u9014\u9b6f\u5409 T'u-lu-ki = Turkey.\n\n131. The name is placed on our map west of Uch and north\n\n---\n\nIt is a curious fact, that up to the middle of last century, eastern and western Turkistan were almost unknown to the Chinese of the present dynasty, whilst the Y\u00fcan and the Ming were well acquainted with these countries. At least this may be inferred from the geographical works published during the present dynasty anterior to the time of K'ien-lung. The \u5927\u6e05\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7 Ta ts'ing yi t'ung chi, or great geography of the Chinese empire under the present dynasty, was first issued in 1748; but it is only in the second edition of this work, published in 1764 in 500 chapters, that we find a description of eastern and western Turkistan. The Chinese had again become acquainted with these countries,\u2014well known to their ancestors eighteen centuries ago,\u2014when the emperor K'ien-lung's armies made the conquest of eastern Turkistan and Dzungaria in 1755. In the new edition of the Yi t'ung chi, the countries of Ili, Tarbagatai, Karkara usu, Urumtsi, Kucha, Kharasha, Uch, Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, etc. and even some places of western Turkistan are treated of at length. All these countries in the Yi t'ung chi are comprised under the general name \u65b0\u7586 Sin-kiang, \"The new frontier.\" After the conquest of these countries, K'ien-lung sent some of the Catholic missionaries, namely Felix d'Arocha, Espinha, and Halderstein, to determine the position of the principal cities there, and to compile maps of those countries. Thus the modern Chinese description of Dzungaria and eastern Turkistan, set down by imperial order, dates from about the middle of last century. Respecting our knowledge of central Asia, we are for the greater part still obliged to draw from these Chinese accounts, and our maps of central Asia are still based merely upon Chinese maps. It cannot be denied, that the Chinese description of central Asia compiled in the days of K'ien-lung, and translated into many European languages, contains information of much value; I would however caution the reader against placing too much reliance on the notes respecting the ancient history of these countries, and their identifications with ancient names. Although some of these identifications seem to be well founded, the greater part are merely the imagination of the learned committee appointed by K'ien-lung;\u2014the same committee that corrupted the proper names in the Pit'an shi. The views of these savants were not founded on historical documents, and their identifications have much the same value as those of Deguignes. European sinologues are accustomed to attach absolute credit to all that the Chinese in modern times say regarding the ancient history and geography of Asia, without attempting to discover what their views are founded on.\nof Kashgar. Although no indication is found either on the map or in the list of the Si-pei-ti, that T'u-lu-ki is intended for the name of a country, I am nevertheless inclined to suppose that Turkistan is meant, or Great Turkey of M. Polo, vol. ii, p. 385:\u2014\n\n\"Great Turkey lies towards the north-west (north-east) when you travel from Hormos. It begins on the further bank of the river Jon (Jihon or Oxus), and extends northward (!) to the territory of the Great Kaan.\"\n\nFriar Benedict, the Pole who travelled with Carpini, states, l. c. p. 777:\u2014\"Post terram Kangitarum (Kankali;\u2014see above, 64) venerunt Turkyami... habet autem Turkya legem Machometi.\"\n\nCarpini calls the same region, the country of the Bisermans.\n\nIn the Si-pei-ti, the name T'u-lu-ki is put at the head of the places and countries comprised in the middle empire, which, as is known, embraced the whole of Turkistan.\n\nI may also observe, that on the map in Yule's Cathay, showing the metropolitan sees of the Nestorian church in the 14th century, the name Tarak appears between Samarcand and Armalek. Col. Yule explains:\u2014\"Turkish tribes beyond Samarkand probably.\"\n\n\u963f\u6b66\u516b\u5931 A-t'e-ba-shi = Atapasha.\n\n132. This name appears on the map north-west of Kashgar. A place \u963f\u6b66\u516b\u5931 A-t'e-ba-sheng is mentioned in the itinerary of Ye-liu Hi-liang after Kashgar.\n\nIn the narrative of Tamerlane's exploits (Deguignes, tom. v, p. 10) it is stated, that Camar-eddin of Kashgar encamped in 1376, at Atbash, a place situated towards the lake Pulkuti (Balkash), into which the river Ili discharges its waters.\n\nIn accordance with the place assigned to A-t'e-ba-shi on the ancient map, about ten years ago a river was discovered, the native name of which is Atapasha. It is a southern affluent of the Naryn, one of the rivers which form the Sir-daria, and can be found on new maps of Turkistan. Baron F. von der Osten Sacken, late secretary of the Russian Geographical Society, who if I am not mistaken, was the first scientific explorer of the country of the upper Naryn, has had the kindness to inform me, that he saw in the valley of the river Atpasha, very interesting remains of an ancient fortress of strong appearance. The place where Baron Sacken crossed the Atpasha in 1867, is situated a little north of 41\u00b0 N. lat. and about 75\u00b0 40' E. long. Greenwich.\n\nMy identification however, is not free from doubt. On the map of Kokand and Turkistan, in Peterman's Geogr. Mitth. 1874, tab. 11, a fortress Atbash is marked north-west of Kashgar, on the route from this city to lake Chatyr-kul, about 40\u00b0 N. lat. and\n75\u00b0 40' E. long. Greenwich. It is difficult to say whether this or the fortress on the river Atpasha is to be identified with the place nearly the same name, mentioned in the Yuan shi and on the ancient map.\n\n\u8a1b \u8def \u90a6 O-dsi-han = Uzgend.\n\n133. The place assigned on the map to O-dsi-han or O-dsi-idsien, between Atpasha and Marghinan, points to its position in Fergana. The name has some resemblance to Uzgend. A city of this latter name still exists in the eastern part of the khanate of Kokand (see the afore-mentioned map in Petermann's Geogr. Mitth.). It was also known in ancient times under the names of Urkend or Aderkend and Awerkend. Ebn Haukal (10th century) speaks of Awerkend as of a city near the eastern border of Fergana; Edrisi (12th century) calls it Aderkend; Abulfeda and Nasr-uddin (13th century), Urkend (cf. Ritter's Asia, vol. v, p. 749).\n\nNeumann (Geschichte d. Engl. Reichs in Asien, vol. i, p. 115) translates from the Kitab Jemini, that Ilek, khan of the Turks (Uigurs) proceeded from Kashgar to Bokhara in 999, took the city and sent Abdal melek, the last sultan of the Samanides to Urkend, two days' journey from Khodjend. The Bibl. Orientale, p. 453,\u2014where is a record of the same events, apparently derived from other sources,\u2014instead of Urkend, has \"Dizghend, place forte qui est fort avant dans le Turkestan.\"\n\nDeguignes (tom. iii, p. 219) translates from the Ben Elathir, that Malek shah of the Seldjuks, in 1089, went to Uzkend, where the king of Kashgar repaired to render homage. This passage proves,\u2014supposing Deguignes has exactly rendered the name as given in the manuscript,\u2014that Uzkend was an ancient name of the place.\n\nI have not been able to find in D'Ohsson's \"History of the Mongols,\" that mention is made by the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period, of this city of Urkend or Uzgend. It is only on the map appended to his work, and containing nothing but ancient names, that a place Euzkend appears in Fergana. Besides this, a city Ozkend is marked on the same map on the river Sihon towards the Aral lake. This city is also spoken of in the Tarikh Djihan Kushai, as having been taken by the Mongols in 1219 (see above, 49). It is of course out of the question, its being the place O-dsi-han on the ancient map.\n\nA city of Ozkend is mentioned by the Mohammedan authors as a place, where the gurkhan of Kara-khitai had a treasury. It was\n\n*** The third character in this name is uncertain. It is written dsien in the Si-pei-ti.\nplundered by Guchluk (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 167). In D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 182 we read, that in 1209, Mohammed Khorazm shah invaded the dominions of the gurkhan of Kara-khitai and conquered Turkistan as far as Ozkend.\n\nAs I have stated in the article on the Karluks (121), the Yuan-shi speaks of a city Wa-sze-gien (somewhere in Turkistan) which sounds like Uzgend.\n\nThe unfortunate traveller, Professor Fedchenko, in 1871 visited Uzgent (thus he writes the name) in the khanate of Kokand. He speaks of the ruins of the tomb of Illik Mozi there, where he saw also some remarkable buildings dating from the beginning of the 12th century. The city is now in ruins, and from their extent it may be concluded, that the ancient city was very large (see Proceedings of Russ. Geogr. Soc. 1872, vol. viii, p. 8).\n\n\u67ef\u6492 Ko-san = Kassan.\n\n134. The position assigned to Ko-san on the ancient map permits its identification with the city of Kassan in Fergana.\n\nKassan is mentioned as early as the 8th century, as having been taken by the Arabs (Deguignes, tom. ii, p. 497). Edrisi (11th century) states that Kassan is situated in the northern part of Fergana, in a fertile country (Ritter's Asien, vol. v, p. 748). Abulfeda (13th century) calls Kassan a great city of Fergana, but destroyed in his days by the Turks (Bibl. Orient. p. 238).\n\nSultan Baber in his description of Fergana (Klaproth's M\u00e9m. rel. \u00e0 l'Asie, tom. ii, p. 145), written in the beginning of the 16th century, speaks of the same place as a little town north of Akhsia, and adds, that the river which passes by Akhsia comes from Kassan.\n\nKassan is marked on Petermann's afore-mentioned map of Kokand, etc. a little north of 41\u00b0 N. lat. and about 71\u00b0 30' E. long. A river passing near Kassan runs southward, and seems to discharge into the Sir-daria near a place called Akhsy. On a Russian map of Tashkand, etc. found in the Proceedings of the Russ. Geogr. Soc. vol. ii, 1867, Kassan appears as a fortress.\n\n\u5df4\u752b Ba-bu.\n\n135. The only corroboration I can adduce of the existence of a city of this name,\u2014which is placed on the Chinese map between Kassan and Marghinan,\u2014is the mention of it in the Si yu lu\n\n*** Akhsia, called also Akhsiket according to sultan Baber. Under the latter name it is mentioned by Ebn Haukal (10th century) as the capital of Fergana, situated on the Sihon (Ritter l. c. vol. v, p. 743).\nThe name is written there \u516b\u666e Ba-p'u, and associated with Khodjend, Kassan and Balan (Badam).\n\n\u9ebb\u8033\u8d64\u56ca Ma-r-i-nang = Marghinan.\n\n136. This is doubtless the city of Marghinan mentioned by Ebn Haukal in the 10th century, as a city of Fergana (Ritter, l. c. vol. v, p. 745), and spoken of also by sultan Baber, who states that the city was famed for its pomegranates and other fruits and flowers. The Bibl. Orient. records, p. 565, that Marghinan was in former times the capital of Il\u0131k khan (a khan of Turkistan). Marghinan still exists. See Petermann's map, on which it is termed Margijan.\n\nIn the Yi t'ung chi, or great geography of the present Chinese empire, and on modern Chinese maps, the name is written \u99ac\u5152\u5580\u6717 Ma-r-k'o-lang. Mir Izzet, a Mohammedan traveller (1812), states that Marghinan is also called Margilan (Klaproth Magaz. Asiat. tom. ii, p. 45).\n\nP. Nazaroff, a Russian traveller to Kokand, 1813\u20141814, who was detained three months in Marghilan, gives a detailed description of the city, which at that time was thirty versts in circumference (Magaz. Asiat. tom. i, p. 53).\n\n\u5ffd\u4e7e Hu-djan = Khodjend.\n\n137. There can be no doubt, that by Hu-djan on the ancient map, the city of Khodjend on the Sir-daria is meant.\n\nThe Mohammedan annals mention Khodjend in the 8th century. Deguignes, tom ii, p. 497, states, that in 719 the Arabs conquered Fergana, and captured the cities of Khodjend, Kassan (see above, 134) and Shash (Tashkand;\u2014see 138). When Chinghiz' armies invaded Fergana, the valiant Timur-melik defended Khodjend (see above, 49). Abulfeda in the 13th century, calls the city Khojanda (Ritter, vol. v, p. 749). It is also mentioned by Nasr-uddin, who has determined its latitude and longitude. Sultan Baber (Klaproth, l. c. tom. ii, p. 143) speaks of Khodjend as of a very ancient city in Fergana, and praises its excellent fruits,\u2014especially pomegranates,\u2014stating, that the pomegranates of Samarqand and Khodjend are proverbial. Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-ts'ai, when speaking of \u845b\u4e7e Ku-djan, also mentions the fine pomegranates there (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 115).\n\nIn the Y\u00fcan shi, chap. cli,\u2014biography of Sie-t'a-la-hai, one of Chinghiz' generals, who was with the conqueror in western Asia,\u2014the name of Khodjend is written \u5ffd\u4e7e Hu-ch'ian.\nThe city of Huo-djan mentioned in the Ming shi, chap. cccxxii, fol. 29, among the twenty-nine small kingdoms of western and central Asia, which used to send tribute every three or five years, seems to denote Khodjend.\n\nPhilippe Nazaroff, sent in 1813 by the Russian government on a mission to the khan of Kokand, (Klaproth, Magazin Asiat. tom. i, p. 34) was, it seems, the first European, who saw Khodjend in modern times. It is known that in 1866, Khodjend was taken by the Russians, and belongs now to Russian Turkistan.\n\nThe river Sir-daria on which Khodjend is situated,\u2014the Sihon of the Persian authors, the Yaxartes of the ancients,\u2014is termed Ho-ch\u2019an or Hu-k\u2019ien by Chinese medi\u00e6val travellers (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 37, 75). This appellation may be explained by the statement in the Bibl. Orient. p. 791, that the Arabs call the Sihon generally Nahar Khodjand, \u201cthe river of Khodjend.\u201d Thus the Sihon is also termed by sultan Baber.\n\n\u5bdf\u8d64 Ch\u2019a-ch\u2019i = Chach or Tashkand.\n\n138. A place of this name is marked on the map, north-west of the afore-named cities of Fergana; and this position permits its identification with Chach, which was as is generally believed, the ancient name for the present Tashkand.\n\nSultan Baber (Klaproth, M\u00e9m. tom. ii, p. 147), when speaking of Tashkand, states, that in books this city is generally called Shash, and that some authors also write Tchatch. Julien (M\u00e9m. s. l. Contr\u00e9es Occid. tom. i, p. 16) writes the name Tchadj.\n\nDeguignes, tom. ii, p. 497, states on the authority of the Mohammedan authors, that Shash was conquered by the Arabs in 719.\n\nEbn Haukal (10th century) mentions the city of Chaje as one of the strongest places on the frontier of Turkistan.\n\nThe Bibl. Orient. has an article on Shash (p. 762), and another on Tashkand (p. 866), but does not say that the two names denote the same place. In D\u2019Ohsson\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Mongols,\u201d the name of Shash or Chach does not appear. Tashkand is only once mentioned, under the year 1306 (tom. iv, p. 557). It is marked also on D\u2019Ohsson\u2019s map.\n\nIn the days of Tamerlane, Tashkand played an important r\u00f4le, and frequent mention is made of this place in the Mohammedan records of the conqueror\u2019s warlike doings (Deguignes, tom. v, pp. 26, 31).\n\nThe embassy of Shah Rokh to the Chinese emperor, in 1419, proceeded from Herat to Balkh, Tashkand, Sairam, etc. (Yule\u2019s Cathay, p. cc).\n\nAncient Chach or Shash has been identified by Ritter (Asien,\nvol. v, p. 670) with the realm of \u77f3 Shi, also called \u67cf\u652f Che-chi or \u67cf\u6298 Che-che, of which mention is made in the \"T'ang History,\" chap. colviiiib. The accounts there given of this country are very vague, but not in contradiction with Ritter's suggestion. With respect to Shi, compare also notes 57 and 59.\n\nThe Buddhist monk Huan-teang, who visited Turkistan in the 7th century, travelled westward and south-westward from Talas, and arrived at \u6492\u77f3 Che-shi or Tchadj (Julien, l. c. tom. i, p. 16). I suppose he travelled by the great highway leading now from the Talas river to Tashkand (see note 59).\n\nThe name Tashkand in Chinese works seems to occur as early as the Mongol period; at least in the Annals of the Yuan shi, under the year 1309, mention is made of the taxes which had to be gathered from the cities of \u6492\u99ac\u5e72 Sa-ma-r-kam (Samarcand) \u5854\u524c\u601d Ta-la-sse (Taras;\u2014see note 59) and \u5854\u5931\u5143 Ta-shi-yuan. I think the last name is intended for Tashkand.\n\nIn the Ming shi, Tashkand is termed \u9054\u5931\u5e72 Ta-shi-kan (chap. ccxxxii, fol. 8), and in the great geography of the present Chinese empire, as well as on modern Chinese maps, the same name is written \u5854\u4ec0\u5e72 Ta-shi-kan.\n\nRitter states (l. c. vol. v, p. 543), that in 1759, the Catholic missionary Felix D'Arocha made twelve astronomical determinations in Fergana, Badakhshan, etc. by order of the Chinese emperor. I have not been able to find any particulars regarding this scientific mission. In the M\u00e9moires concernant les Chinois, tom. i, pp. 399, 400, where it seems the calculations of the missionaries,\u2014in the second half of the last century\u2014were first published, not a word is said as to their origin. The determinations given there deviate most widely from the new Russian determinations in those countries. Errors in the observations of the missionaries respecting the longitudes would be explicable; but the so-called observations of D'Arocha show a difference of from $1^\\circ 40'$ to $1^\\circ 52'$ even in the latitudes, when compared with the Russian calculations. Thus the correct latitude of Tashkand according to Russian observation is $41^\\circ 19'$, whilst D'Arocha carries this place north to $43^\\circ, 3'$. It is known that all the astronomical determinations made by the Jesuit missionaries in China, even so early as the beginning of last century are very correct. I therefore feel some doubt, whether D'Arocha ever travelled from China to Fergana.\n\nI may finally mention, that for the first European accounts of\n\n---\n\n*Shi in Chinese means \"stone.\" Tash in the Turkish dialects has the same meaning.*\nTashkand, based upon local observation, we are indebted to the above-mentioned Russian traveller Nazaroff in 1813, who in his narrative gives a good description of the city (Klaproth, Magaz. Asiat. tom. i, p. 31). It is needless to say, that since Tashkand was taken by the Russians in 1864, and made the capital of Russian Turkistan, the city is as well known (in Russia at least) as any other city of the empire.\n\n\u5140\u63d0\u523a\u8033 U-ti-la-r=Otrar.\n\n139. The position of Otrar seems to be erroneously marked on the ancient map, in relation to Tashkand and Sairam. I have not been able to find in my books, any statements regarding the position of ancient Otrar; and I cannot say whether it has been ascertained. The name of Otrar does not appear on the Russian maps of Turkistan which I have seen. But Dr. Petermann,\u2014whose information is always drawn from the best sources,\u2014on his excellent map of western Turkistan, Chiva, etc. (Mittheil. 1873, tab. 9), places the ruins of Otrar on the northern bank of the Sir-daria, between Fort Perowsky and the city of Turkistan.\n\nThis position agrees well with Pegoletti's notices of the land route to Cathay, written in the first half of the 14th century (Yule's Cathay, p. 288). This itinerary mentions Gintarchan (Astrachan), Sara (Serai) and Saracanco (Sarachik on the river Jaik). The distance from the latter place to Organci (Urgendj) is estimated at twenty days' journey in camel-waggon, and from Organci to Oltrarre (Otrar) thirty-five to forty days; but the direct way from Saracanco to Oltrarre is stated to take only fifty days. From Oltrarre to Armalec (Almalik), Pegoletti reckons forty-five days' journey.\n\nIt seems that the name Otrar is first mentioned by the Mohammedian authors in the 13th century. The Bibl. Orient. states, pp. 313, 690, that this city was previously called Farab. It was at one time considered the capital of Turkistan. The Mohammedian authors also state, that it was not very far from Bela-sagun (see note 57). Ebn Haukal (10th century) describes Farab as a large city in the western part of Turkistan.\n\nThe history of Otrar presents two remarkable events. Its capture by the Mongols, in 1219, was the commencement of the conquest of western Asia; and it was at Otrar, that the great Tamerlane died, on the 17th of February, 1405, just when he was about to move out on a great expedition against the emperor of China.\n\nHaithon the Armenian, in his Historia Orientalis, p. 4, calls\nOctorar (Otrar) the greatest city of Turkistan. Haithon the traveller writes the name correctly Otrar.\n\nCol. Yule states (Cathey, p. 288), that Otrar stood on the frontier between the khanates of Kipchak and Chagatai (he does not say from whom this is quoted). The ancient Chinese map places it near the frontier of Kipchak, but as I observed above, this does not seem to be its proper place on the map.\n\nThe name Ornas (or Orpar) in Carpini's narrative, p. 750, is perhaps intended for Otrar. There is however some confusion in his statements about this place, which do not permit any identification (see note 91).\n\nConcerning the siege and capture of Otrar, in 1219, by the Mongols,\u2014which is recorded with more or less detail by the Mohammedan authors, and also by the Chinese authors,\u2014see above, 49. The Yuan shi spells the name \u8131\u65a1\u7f85\u5152 Wa-t'o-lo-r or \u9102\u5854\u523a O-ta-la. Yeliu Ch'u-ts'ai also mentions \u9102\u6253\u523a O-ta-la (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 115).\n\n\u6492\u99ac\u8033\u5e72 Sa-ma-r-kan = Samarcand.\n\n140. Samarcand,\u2014in times past the capital of Maver-al-nahr or Transoxiana,\u2014is one of the most ancient and celebrated cities of Asia. The fertile valley of the Zarafshan, in which Samarcand was founded, is mentioned under the name of Sogdo in the ancient traditions of Iran. The Zend Avesta enumerates it among the places of abundance created by Ormuzd. From Sogdo, the name Sogdiana of the Greek and Roman authors is derived. It is not ascertained when the name Samarcand first appeared, but it is generally believed, that the place Maracanda visited by Alexander the Great (cf. Arrian's History, book iii, chap. xxx), is identical with Samarcand.\n\nThe Bibl. Orient. quotes some Mohammedan writers, who assert, that Samarcand was founded by Kishtasp (Darius Hystaspes, B.C. 521\u2014485. It seems, that very little is known of the ancient history of Samarcand. Before it was taken by the Arabs and Islam carried to Transoxiana, Samarcand was in the possession of the western Turks. In the 10th century it belonged to the Samanides, who reigned over Transoxiana and Khorassan. In the 11th and 12th centuries it was comprised in the dominions of the Seldjuks; and in the 12th century it seems that the rulers of Samarcand were for some time tributary to the Kara-khitai. When Chinghiz arrived in Transoxiana, Samarcand was subject to Mohammed Shah of Khorazm; and it was taken by the Mongols in April, 1220. Samarcand in the days of the Mongols was repeatedly visited by Europeans. There was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian church,\nand also a Latin missionary bishopric there (Yule's Cathay, pp. ccxliv and 192). The Christian missionaries in the middle ages called it Semiscant. Marco Polo (vol. i, pp. 170 sqq.) devotes a chapter to the great city of Samarcan. Haithon the traveller terms it Semergent. Clavijo and Schildberger, who both lived at the court of Tamerlane, at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th centuries, have left behind some accounts of the capital of Tamerlane. Clavijo states, that Samarcand was also called Cimes-quinte (Yule's Cathay, pp. cxxxv and 192).\n\nAfter Clavijo and Shildberger, for nearly four centuries no European visited Samarcand; so that Ritter in his Asia, could give no information respecting it, during that period, except some ancient Chinese historical accounts. For the first authentic accounts of Samarcand, we are indebted to the members of a Russian scientific expedition sent to Transoxiana in 1841. This expedition was composed of the well-known orientalist Khanikoff and two other savants, Lehmann (naturalist) and Bogoslawsky. They visited Bokhara and Samarcand, and Khanikoff subsequently published a \"Description of the Khanate of Bokhara\" (in Russian), St. Petersburg, 1843. A good map of Transoxiana, and also maps of the cities of Samarcand and Bokhara are appended.\n\nThe reports of this expedition are also found in Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Russischen Reiches, b. xvii. In 1863, the well-known traveller Prof. Vambery was in Samarcand; and in May, 1868, the Russian army took possession of the city.\n\n141. Let me now show what the Chinese report respecting Samarcand. There can be no doubt that Sogdiana was known to them as early as the 2nd century B.C., since the famous Chinese general Chang Kien had visited the countries of the far west. From the vague accounts found in the histories of the Han, it is not easy to identify the ancient Chinese names applied to the countries of western Asia; it seems however, that the country of \u5eb7\u5c45 K'ang-k\u00fci,\u2014first mentioned in the \"History of the Anterior Han,\"\u2014before our era, included Sogdiana; for in the \"History of the Northern Wei (386\u2014558),\" a country in the west, \u5eb7 K'ang, is described; and it is further stated there, that the people of K'ang are a branch of the K'ang-k\u00fci of the Han period. In the \"History of the T'ang,\" chap. clviii, the kingdom of K'ang is again spoken of; and among the synonyms given for the same country, we find \u9686\u672b\u7e23 Sa-mo-kien, which is intended for Samarcand. This identification is corroborated by the narrative\n\n---\n\n*** Khanikoff states l.c. p. 104, that he was not the first Russian who saw Samarcand, the place having been visited towards the end of last century by Yefremoff.\nof Huan-t'sang who visited Sa-mo-kien; and his itinerary leaves no doubt, that by this name Samarcand is to be understood.\n\nWe find Samarcand again mentioned in the Chinese annals, in the first half of the 12th century. As has been stated above (26), Ye-l\u00fc Ta-shi, the founder of the dynasty of the Western Liao, advanced as far as Samarcand, and even beyond it. In the narrative of his expedition, Samarcand is termed \u6492\u99ac\u53ef\u6c57 S\u00fcn-sze-kan. The same name was also in use in the east during the Mongol period. I have shown in my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. (cf. pp. 23, 38, 48, 76), that Samarcand is repeatedly mentioned by Chinese medi\u00e6val travellers to the west in the 13th century; sometimes under the name of S\u00fcn-sze-kan, and sometimes \u897f\u7c73\u585e\u6c57 Sie-mi-sze-kan; the latter name is evidently intended for Semiscant (see above). Ch'ang-ch'un states (l. c. p. 44), that the same city was also called \u6cb3\u4e2d\u5e9c Ho-chung fu (the city between the rivers) by the Kara-khitai. This Chinese term is a literal translation of the Arabic Bein naharein. Thus,\u2014according to the Bibl. Orient. p. 738,\u2014Samarcand was called in ancient times, on account of its position between the Djihun and Sihon (Oxus and Yaxartes).\n\nAn interesting explanation is given by Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-ts'ai of the name S\u00fcn-sze-kan (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 116). He states, that \"western people say, that the meaning of this name is 'fat' (\u80a5 fei), and as the land there is very fertile, the city received this name.\"* Indeed semiz in the Turkish languages means \"fat.\"\n\nIn the Annals of the Yuan shi, where Chinghiz' expedition to the west is reported, both the above-mentioned Chinese names for Samarcand appear (see above, 53).\n\nIn the Si-pei-ti, and on the ancient map, Samarcand is termed \u6492\u99ac\u53ef\u6c57 Sa-ma-r-kan; and in the Annals of the Yuan shi, sub anno 1309, the city is spoken of once more under the same name (see above, 138).\n\nFinally, I may mention respecting Samarcand in the middle ages, an interesting ancient Chinese document translated by Archimandrite Palladius, and published in The Chinese Recorder, vol. vi, p. 108. An ancient monument in Chin-kiang fu commemorative of Ma Sie-li-ki-sze, a Christian and a native of Samarcand, mentions Sie-mi-sze-hien as a country where the religion of the Ye-li-k'o-ven (Christians) dominates; and speaks of a miraculous\n\n---\n\n* It may be interesting to compare with this, the etymology given by Clavijo. He says:\u2014\"The city is so large, and so abundantly supplied, that it is wonderful; and the name of Samarcand or Cimes-quinte is derived from the two words cimes great, and quinte a town.\" (Narrative of the Embassy of Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, p. 170).\u2014Ed. Com.\ntemple there, one pillar of which was in a hanging position, etc. This statement has special interest; for M. Polo (vol. ii, p. 139, speaks of the Baron Mar Sarghis, a Nestorian Christian and governor of Chinghianfu. Polo also records (vol. i, p. 171) the miracle in the Christian church of Samarcan, where one of the columns was without support.\n\nThe \"History of the Ming\" (Ming shi, chap. cccxxxii, fol. 1 sqq.) devotes a long article to \u6492\u99ac\u5152\u7f55 Sa-ma-r-han, from which it appears, that in the days of Tamerlane, and also in the 15th and 16th centuries, active intercourse existed between China and the countries in the west, as Samarcan, Herat and Fergana.\n\n\u90a3\u9ed1\u6c99\u4e0d Na-hei-sha-bu = Nakhshab (Karshi).\n\n142. By Na-hei-sha-bu,\u2014placed on the map south-west* of Samarcan, and south-east of Bokhara,\u2014only Nakhshab can be meant, which has the same position on D'Ohsson's map. This name is not found on modern maps, but I read in the Bibl. Orient. p. 664, that Nekhaeb, a city of Transoxiana,\u2014according to Abulfeda and Arabshah is also known under the name of Karshi, and that it is situated on the way leading from the banks of the Djihun to the city of Kesh.*** The country between the Djihun and Nakhshab is stated there to be a sterile desert. As to Karshi, this name appears on modern maps, south-west of Samarcan (see Petermann's map;\u2014Mitth. 1873, tab. 9). This place has been astronomically determined.\n\nIt seems, that Nakhshab is spoken of in the \"History of the Wei dynasty (386\u2014558).\" At least, the name of \u90a3\u8272\u6ce2 Na-she-bo mentioned there, under the article K'ang (Samarcand;\u2014see above), as that of a small realm dependant on K'ang, has a strong resemblance to Nakhshab.\n\nFirdusi, in his \"History of Persia\" (Deguignes, tom. ii, p. 333) relates, that at the time of Khosru Anushirvan, A.D. 531\u2014579, the khan of China invaded Transoxiana and defeated the khan of the Turks, near Nakhshab.\n\nNakhaeb is more than once mentioned in D'Ohsson's \"History of the Mongols.\" When the Mongol armies appeared in Transoxiana, Mohammed shah of Khorazm left Samarcan and fled by way of Nakhshab (tom. i, p. 241). After the capture of Samarcan, Chinghiz encamped the whole summer of 1220, between\n\n* By a typographical error, NA-HEI-SHA-BU is placed about a \u00bd inch too much to the right on our transliterated map.\u2014Ed. Com.\n\n*** Kesh, the native place of Tamerlane, lies south of Samarcan. Ch'ang-ch'un, when proceeding from Samarcan to the Hindu-kush, in 1222, passed through Kesh and the Iron-gate (see Notes on Chien. Med. Trav. p. 41).\nthat city and Nakhsheb (tom. i, p. 262). See also tom. i, p. 315.\n\nIn the narrative of the exploits of Tamerlane, Nakhsheb is also mentioned (Deguignes, tom. v, p. 9).\n\n\u4e0d\u82b1\u523a Bu-hua-la = Bokhara.\n\n143. All Mohammedan authors agree in stating that Bokhara is one of the most ancient cities in the world. Oghuz khan the (half-mythical) progenitor of all the Turk tribes is said to have resided in Bokhara. In the political changes, which have successively taken place in Transoxiana, Bokhara has generally shared a common fate with Samarcand. Thus it was conquered by the Arabs in the beginning of the 8th century. In the 10th century, it was the capital of the dynasty of the Samanides. In 999, a khan of the Turks overran Transoxiana and took Bokhara. Abdalmelek, the last Samanide ruler was made prisoner. Subsequently a Seljuk dynasty reigned over Transoxiana. When Chinghiz arrived, Bokhara belonged to the shah of Khorazm. The place surrendered to the Mongols in 1220 (see above, 49).\n\nThe Chinese annals, apparently, first mention Bokhara in the 7th century. In the \"T'ang History\" (chap. ccviii), after the description of K'ang (Samarcand), nine smaller realms are mentioned, which were dependent on Samarcand. One of them is termed \u5b89 An, and also \u5e03\u8c41 Bu-huo or \u6355\u559d Bu-ho. Bu-ho, which probably means Bokhara, is there stated to be bounded on the west by the river \u9ce5\u6ef8 Wu-hu. In Huan-tsang's itinerary the kingdom of Bu-ho is also noticed. It is said to resemble Samo-kien or Samarcand (Julien, l. c. tom. i, p. 21).\n\nThe capture of Bokhara by Chinghiz is also recorded in the Yuan shi, where the name is written \u84b2\u83ef P'u-hua, and also \u535c\u54c8\u5152 Bu-ha-r (see above, 53). Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-t'sai (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 117) says P'u-hua is richer than Samarcand.\n\nIn the Ming shi, chap. cccxxxii, fol. 9, a short article is devoted to \u535c\u82b1\u5152 Bu-hua-r. The Ming emperors several times sent envoys to Bokhara.\n\nAfter Bokhara had been,\u2014like Samarcand,\u2014for long centuries a terra incognita to Europeans, it was first visited, in 1833, by Sir A. Burnes. In 1842, a Russian scientific expedition (Khankoff, Lehmann, etc.;\u2014see above, 140) went to Bokhara and Samarcand; subsequent to which several political missions have been sent by the Russian government to the khan of Bokhara,\n\n---\n\n* The river Wu-hu seems to be the Oxus. It is again mentioned in the T'ang shu, in the articles T'u-huo-lo (Tokharestan;\u2014see note 292) and Ho-li-si-mi (Khorazm;\u2014see further on, 161).\nwho finally lost the province of Samarcand, in warlike contest with that empire.\n\n\u7684\u91cc\u5b89 Di-li-an = Daran (?)\n\n144. Thus the name is written in the list of the Si-pei-ti; but on the ancient map it is spelt \u7684\u5b89\u91cc Di-an-li. I am not prepared to say which may be the correct reading. The map places this name between Bokhara and Ko-t'i (Kath). Perhaps the city of Daran, mentioned in the Bibl. Orient. p. 513, among the cities of Khorazm, is intended.\n\n\u67ef\u63d0 Ko-t'i = Kath.\n\n145. This name appears on the ancient map to the south-east of the place where Khorazm (see 161) is marked. I think Kath is meant, which according to the Bibl. Orient, pp. 241, 513, was a city of Khorazm, at one time the capital of that country, and situated on the eastern bank of the Djihun, eighteen parasangs (16 French lieues;\u2014D'Herbelot) distant from Hazarasp, which lies on the western bank of the same river. Kath has disappeared from the maps, but Hazarasp still exists, a little north of 41\u00b0 lat. west of the Amu-daria, about twelve English miles distant from the river (see Petermann's Mitth. 1873, tab. 9).\n\nIt seems the city of Kath is not mentioned by D'Ohsson; but in the relation of Tamarlane's war with Khorazm this name repeatedly occurs (Deguignes, tom. v, pp. 5, 7, 9). In 1388, Tamerlane gave orders to fortify the city of Kath, and it was still in existence in the middle of the 16th century (Deguignes, tom. iv, p. 472).\n\n\u6b66\u8033\u8ff7 T'e-r-mi = Termed.\n\n146. Termed lies on the northern bank of the Amu-daria, north of Balkh. This city was in existence in the 5th century of our era. Deguignes states (tom. ii, p. 328), on the authority of Firdusi it seems, that about A.D. 460, Firuz, the brother of Hormuz, king of Persia, asked auxiliary troops from the khan of the Euthalites (Indo-scytha) in Maver-al-nahr, to dethrone his brother. They made an agreement that Firuz should cede to the khan the cities of Termed and Vasjard on the Djihun.\n\nEdrisi (12th century) states, that the river Wakhsh-ab (thus he terms the Oxus) runs along the frontier of the country of Balkh, reaches Tarmedh, etc. and finally discharges its waters into the lake of Khorazm (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxxxv).\nChinghiz khan took Termed by assault in the autumn of 1220 (see above, 51).\n\nAs to the Chinese authors who mention Termed, it seems that the kingdom of Ta-mi in Huan-tsang's narrative (Julien, M\u00e9m. s. l. Contr\u00e9es Occid., tom. i, p. 25) denotes Termed.\n\nThe Chinese annals Kang mu record the capture of \u8fe6\u91cc\u5bc6 Tie-li-mi by Chinghiz (see note 94); and in the Yuan shi, where the same fact is related in chap. cli, biography of Sie-t'a-la-hai the name of Termed is written \u5e16\u91cc\u9ebb Tie-li-ma.\n\nSome particulars regarding Termed are also found in the Ming shi, chap. cccxxii, fol. 9. It is stated there amongst others, that \u8fe6\u91cc\u5bc6 Tie-li-mi is situated east of the river \u963f\u6728 A-mu (Amu-daria), south-west of Samarcand, and distant two thousand li from \u54c8\u70c8 Ha-lie (Herat).\n\n\u9014\u601d T'u-sze = Thus.\n\n147. The compiler of the ancient map has committed a grave error respecting the position of Thus and Talecan; carrying the first too far east (east of Balkh), and assigning it to Chagatai's empire, whilst Talecan (see 169) is marked too far west (north-west of Balkh). It seems these two places have simply been confounded; for Talecan belonged in fact to the middle empire, whilst Thus, at the time of the Mongols, was the capital of Khorassan, a province of Persia.\n\nThus is a very ancient and celebrated city. The foundation of it is attributed to Giamshid, a mythical king of Persia. The calif Harun al Rashid died in Thus, A.D. 809. His tomb there was destroyed by the Mongols in 1221 (see above, 51). Thus is the native place of the celebrated Persian poet Firdusi (940\u20141020), and of the great astronomer Nasr-uddin (1201\u20141274), for whom Hulagu built an observatory near Meragha. Thus had much to suffer from the Mongol invasion, being first sacked by Subutai, in 1220, and destroyed the following year by Tului. It was restored in 1239 by Kueurgueuz, who had been appointed Mongol governor of Khorassan, and who established his residence there (D'Ohs-son, tom. iii, pp. 116, 117). In 1256, Hulagu, on his expedition to Persia, spent several days in Thus and its neighbourhood (D'Ohs-son, tom. iii, p. 190). Haithon the traveller, on his way back from Karakorum, passed through Thus. All the Mohammedan geographers speak of this place. Ibn Batuta (middle of the 14th century) calls it one of the largest cities of Khorassan.\n\nThus at an early day was an episcopal see of the Nestorian church. Col. Yule states (Cathay, p. xc), that the existence of an\nepiscopal see in Merv and Thus A.D. 334 is ascertained. In 420 they were raised to the metropolitan dignity.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, the city of Tu-sze is twice mentioned. The Annals record its capture by Tului in the year 1222, and its name appears in the list of the Si-pei-ti.\n\n\u5df4\u5854\u54c8\u5c71 Ba-da-ha-shang = Badakhshan.\n\n148. Badakhshan, the mountainous country where the Oxus takes its rise, so little known to Europeans in our day, is spoken of by most of the ancient Persian and Arabic geographers. It has always been famed for its rubies. An important trade route passes by Badakhshan, crossing the high mountain chain of Bolor tagh (the\u8471\u5dba Ts'ung-ling or Onion mountains of the ancient Chinese geographers), and connecting eastern Turkistan with the countries situated on the Oxus. Go\u00ebs, on his journey from India to China, in the beginning of the 17th century, followed this route, which in the middle ages seems to have been of much greater importance than it is now. M. Polo also, when proceeding from western Asia to China, crossed the country of Badakhshan (l.c. vol. i, p. 149).\n\nSome of the ancient Mohammedan geographers consider Badakhshan to be a part of Tokharestan; others distinguish it from the latter (Bibl. Orient. p. 870). Ebn Haukal, in the 10th century, understood by Tokharestan, the province east of Balkh, comprising Taikan (Talecan), Anderabeh, Badakhshan and Penjhir (Ritter, l.c. vol. v, p. 701).\n\nEdrisi (12th century) states (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxxxiv):\u2014\n\n\"The Djihun takes its rise in the country of Wakhan on the frontier of Badakhshan, and there it bears the name of Khari-ab. It receives five considerable tributaries, which come from the countries of Khutl (see note 294) and Watsch......Badakhshan is built on the west bank of the Khari-ab, the most considerable of the rivers that fall into the Djihun. They bring to Badakhshan the musk of the regions of Tibet, adjoining Wakhan.\"\n\nD'Ohsson (tom. i, p. 272) quotes an Arabic geographical dictionary, in which it is stated, that the trade route from Persia to Tibet passes through Badakhshan. This country is twice again mentioned by D'Ohsson;\u2014in tom. i, p. 172, it is recorded, that Guchluk, the gurkhan of Kara-khitai was slain in Badakhshan in 1218 (see above, 35); and in tom. i, p. 272, we read of the Mongol invasion of the country in 1221.\n\nTokharestan seems to be a name of very ancient date, for Strabo and Pliny mention the Tocharoi or Tochari. The Tochari were also known in the 2nd century of our era to Ptolemy, as a people among the mountains of the Oxus.\nBadakhshan was known to the Chinese at an early date; not at first by this name, but under the general appellation \u5410\u706b\u7f85 T'u-huo-lo, which doubtless denotes Tokharestan (see above). This name first appears in the \"History of the Northern Wei,\" (A.D. 386\u2014558). In the \"History of the T'ang\" we read, that the country of T'u-huo-lo is situated west of the Te'ung-ling mountains (Bolor tagh;\u2014see above), on the southern bank of the river \u9ce5\u95ca Wu-hu. The name of Badakhshan is first met with in Chinese books in the Y\u00fcan period, and it seems to be only once mentioned in the Y\u00fcan shi, viz. in the list of the countries situated to the north-west, where the name is written as on the ancient map.\n\nIn the \"History of the Ming,\" Chap. cccxxii, fol. 17, some information is given about \u516b\u7b54\u9ed1\u5546 Ba-da-hei-shang. It is stated there, that it lies to the north-east of \u5112\u90fd\u6dee An-du-huai (Andkhui), and the (principal) city is ten li in circuit. In Ba-da-hei-shang a great trade is carried on in products from the Si-y\u00fc; from which source the people have become very wealthy. The country belongs to the son of \u62c9\u54c8\u9b6f Sha-ha-lu, the king of \u54c8\u70c8 Ha-li\u00e9. The intercourse of Badakhshan with China (in the Ming period) began in the year 1408, when envoys from that country arrived at the Chinese court, together with envoys from Ha-shi-ha-r (Kashgar) and \u845b\u6b66\u90ce Ko-t'e-lang.\n\nBadakhshan is spoken of also in the great geography of the present Chinese empire. The name is written there \u5df4\u9054\u514b\u5c71 Ba-da-k'o-shan.\n\nBadakhshan is quoted by Ritter (l.c. vol. v, p. 543) among the places said to have been astronomically determined by Felix D'Arocha (see above, 138).\n\n149. Kabul, the capital of modern Afghanistan,\u2014in times\n\nBy this name, occurring repeatedly in the T'ang shu (see note 290), evidently the Oxus is meant; and it seems Wu-hu is intended for Wakh. We have seen that Edrisi terms the Oxus Wakh-ab. See above, 146.\n\nSha-ha-lu denotes Shah Rokh; and Ha-li\u00e9 is Herat. There is in the Ming shi, chap. cccxxii, fol. 18, a special article on Ha-li\u00e9, where the king of this country is termed \u62c9\u54c8\u9b6f\u628a\u90fd\u5152 Sha-ha-lu ba-du-r (Shah Rokh bahadur).\n\nIn chap. cccxxxii, fol. 28, of the Ming shi, the same name is written \u845b\u6b66\u90ce Ha-li-lan. This is probably the country of Koltan mentioned in the history of Tamerlane (Deguignes, tom. v, p. 28), and the Kult of Edrisi, where the Oxus takes its rise.\n\nThe name of the Afghan nation appears first in history, it seems, in the days of Tamerlane. Deguignes (tom. v, p. 41) states:\u2014\"Pir Mohammed, the grandson of Tamerlane, who governed the provinces of Condoz, Baklan,\npast the capital of Kabulistan,\u2014bears an ancient name, which can be traced back more than seventeen centuries; for Ptolemy mentions the city of Kaboura,\u2014Kabur being the original Persian name of it (Ritter, l. c. vol. v, p. 237).\n\nEbn Haukal (10th century) writes the name, Kabul. He states that the castle is in the possession of the Mussulmans, but the city is still in the power of the infidels. In the 10th century Kabul belonged, it seems, to the empire of the Samanides, but in the 11th and 12th centuries it was under the rule of the Ghaznevids.\n\nChinghiz khan's armies probably entered Kabul, although the Mohammedan authors do not expressly state it. We have seen (52) that Chinghiz was at Beruan, which is situated among the mountains north of Kabul.\n\nThe Chinese probably knew Kabul in the time of the T'ang (7th to 9th century). I am not however prepared to say, which of the kingdoms in the west, mentioned in the T'ang shu, could be identified with Kabul. The identifications of Ritter and R\u00e9musat are unfounded.\n\nIt seems, that the list of the Si-pei-ti is the only instance of the mention of Kabul in the Yuan shi. I have never met with this name elsewhere in Chinese books.\n\nK'o-dei-ning = Ghizning, or Ghazna.\n\n150. Ghizin or Ghazna is also a very ancient city, and was the capital of Zabelstan, a country contiguous to and south-west of Kabulistan. It was celebrated in the days of Ebn Haukal; and towards the end of the 10th century, it became the capital of the Ghaznevid dynasty.\n\nGhazna played an important r\u00f4le at the time of the Mongol invasion of Persia. It then belonged to the empire of Khovareem shah, and Djelal-eddin rallied his forces in Ghazna (see above, 52). It was destroyed in 1222, but was afterwards rebuilt. In the 14th century, the Mohammedan authors mention Ghazna repeatedly.\n\nI have stated above (86), that according to the Mohammedan records, the countries of Badakhshan, Kabul and Ghazna seem to have been subject to Parsia in the Mongol period. The map however assigns them to the middle empire. They may have been for a time in the possession of the Chagatai branch, the princes of which often passed the Djihun, invading the Persian territories.\n\nKabul, Ghazna and Kandahar, received orders in 1397 to attack the Uganis or Aghuans, who dwelt among the mountains of Solimankuh.\"\nIII. Countries and Places in the Empire of Yue-dsu-bu (Uzbek).\n\n\u91d1\u585e Kin-ch'a = Kipchak.\n\n151. The name of Kin-ch'a has been applied by Chinese authors, since the year 1223, to the land of the Kipchaks or Desht Kipchak, as the Mohammedan authors term the tract of land situated north of the Black sea, the Caucasus mountains, and the Caspian sea, and covered by vast steppes. The Bibl. Orient. translates the Persian word desht, by \"campagne d\u00e9serte, o\u00f9 il n'y a ni villes ni villages.\"\n\nThe Kipchak nation belonged to the great stock of the Turks, whose progenitor, according to the Mohammedan authors, was the famous Oghuz khan. Rashid-eddin gives the following legend of the origin of the Kipchaks (Berezin, vol. i, p. 18):\n\n\"Oghuz khan, having been defeated by the tribe of Itbarak, was forced to retire to an island between two rivers. At that time it happened, that a woman whose husband had been killed in the battle, was delivered of a child in the hollow of a large tree. When Oghuz heard of this he said,\u2014'As this woman has no husband, I shall adopt her son.' The child received the name Kipchak, which is derived from the Turkish word kubuk meaning 'a tree worn hollow by decay.' All the people of Kipchak are descended from this adopted son of Oghuz. After seventeen years had elapsed, Oghuz succeeded in gaining the superiority over the Itbarak. He conquered Iran and returned to his original country; and afterwards when the Itbarak revolted, Oghuz settled the Kipchak between their country and the river Jaik. Since that time the Kipchaks have remained both in summer and winter in the same country.\"\n\nIt is a curious fact that the people here spoken of were known to their neighbours by quite different names. In the Russian annals they are always termed Polovtsy; for as to the identity of these and the Kipchaks of the Mohammedan writers, there can be no doubt. The Polovtsy are first mentioned in Russian history in the middle of the 11th century, as the southern neighbours of Russia, inhabiting the steppes north of the Black sea, the Caucasus, etc. (Karamzin, vol. ii, p. 67). Before that time these tracts had been occupied by the Pechenegs. The Polovtsy are described as an audacious, nomadic people and skilful horsemen. The Russians were frequently at war with them, and it was only when the Polovtsy had been defeated by the Mongols, that they made a league with the Russians against them (Karamzin, vol. iii, p. 228).\n\nD'Ohsson (tom. i, p. 388) states, that Polovtsy in Russian means\nIn the Hungarian and Byzantine annals, the same people bear the name of Kumans. Their country was known also to Marco Polo under the name of Comania (M. Polo, vol. i, p. 50; vol. ii, p. 421). Carpini states, pp. 742, 743:\n\n\"Ivimus autem per totam terram Comanorum, quae tota est plana, et habet quatuor flumina magna: primum Neper (Dnieper) appellatur, juxta quod, ex parte Rusciae, ambulabat Corenza (a Mongol general), et ex parte altera, per illa campestria, Mauci, qui major est quam Corenza; secundum Don, super quod ambulat quidam princeps qui habet sororem Bati in uxorem, qui Cartan appellatur; tertium Volga, istud flumen est valde magnum, super quod vadit Bati; quartum Juec appellatur (see above), super quod millenarii duo, unus ex una parte fluminis et alter ex altera parte, vadunt.\"\n\nOn p. 747 in Carpini's narrative, we read:\n\n\"Comania ver\u00f2 habet ab aquilone, immediat\u00e8 post Rusciam, Morduinos, Bileros id est magnam Bulgariam, Bascartos id est magnam Hungariam (Bashkirs;\u2014see above).\"\n\nRubruquis, p. 246 describes his journey through the steppes of the Comans, in the following terms:\n\n\"Et tendebamus recte in orientem ex quo exivimus predictam provinciam Gasarie, habentes mare ad meridiem et vastam solitudinem ad aquilonem, que durat per xxx dietas alicubi in latitudine, in qua nulla silva, nullus mons, nullus lapis, herba est optima. In hac solebant pascere Commani, qui dicuntur Capchat.\" (Thus Rubruquis identifies the Commans and Kipchaks.)\n\nHaithon the historian also has a chapter on the kingdom of the Comans.\n\nThe Mongols came first in contact with the Kipchaks in 1223, when Subutai with his army crossed the Caucasus (see above); but it was only about twelve years later their country was subdued, when Batu undertook his famous expedition against the nations north of the Caspian and Black seas. After Batu had returned from Hungary, in 1242, he established his residence in Desht Kipchak near the lower Volga.\n\n---\n\n\"inhabitants of the plain;\" but he is wrong, for the name has no meaning in Russian; and Polovtsy can by no means be derived from polye, \"field,\" as D'Ohsson intimates.\n\nD'Ohsson (tom. i, p. 838) derives the name from the river Kuban, which empties into the Black sea; but it seems more reasonable to bring the Kumans into connection with the large river Kuma, discharging into the Caspian.\n\nThe Mordwins still live on the Volga.\n\nThis capital of the Golden Horde was known in the middle ages under the name of Sarai, and is mentioned in the Russian annals, as well as by medieval travellers and Mohammedan geographers, e.g. Ibn Batuta (middle of the 14th century) and Abulfeda (beginning of the 14th century). Sara is one of the principal stations in Pegoletti's itinerary to Cathay (Yule's Cathay,\n152. Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-ts'ai, who accompanied Chinghiz to western Asia, is the first Chinese author, who mentions the country of the Kipchaks, terming it \u53ef\u5f17\u4e49 K'o-fu-ch'a. He describes it also as a country without cities, consisting of vast plains, where many horses and much cattle are bred (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 118).\n\nThe Yuan ch'ao pi shi calls the Kipchaks, Kibcha (see above, 63). The Yuan shi always spells the name \u91d1\u5bdf Kin-ch'a, as it is rendered on the ancient map. I need not here repeat the accounts given in the Yuan shi and the Yuan ch'ao pi shi respecting the conquest of Kin-ch'a by the Mongols (see Part V).\n\nThe Chinese annals Kang mu, sub anno 1237, state concerning Kin-ch'a, that this country is distant thirty thousand li from China. In summer the nights there are extremely short; soon after the sun has set it rises again. There are fine horses; and wealthy people breed a large number of them. The people are skilful in working leather and metal. They are manly, valiant, strong and impetuous. They have blue eyes and red hair.\n\nIn the biography of \u571f\u571f\u54c8 Tu-tu-ha (Yuan shi, chap. cxxviii), who was a Kipchak prince, and general in Kublai khan's army, the following somewhat obscure accounts are given of Kin-ch'a:\n\n\"The ancestors of the people of Kin-ch'a originally dwelt north of \u6b66\u5e73 Wu-p'ing, on the river \u6298\u9023 Dje-lien, near the mountain \u6309\u7b54\u7f55 An-da-han. K'\u00fc-ch'u emigrated to the northwest, to the mountain called \u7389\u91cc\u4f2f\u91cc Yu-li-bo-li, and this name was then adopted for the reigning family. K'\u00fc-ch'u had a son So-mo-na, who also had a son I-no-sze. They were all hereditary princes of Kin-ch'a. When Chinghiz was at war with the Mie-li-ki (Merkits), their prince \u706b\u90fd Huo-du fled to Kin-ch'a.\"\n\np. 287). Carpini, who was at the court of Batu in 1246, and Rubruquis, in 1254, both speak of the residence of Batu; but the name Sarai does not occur in their narratives. Marignolli passed the winter of 1339 at the court of Uzbeg khan of the Kipchaks, but the name Sarai seems to have been unknown to him also (Yule's Cathay, p. 321). M. Polo states, (vol. i, p. 4), that the residences of Barca Kaan (a son of Djuchi, in 1257\u20141265) were at Sarai and Bolgara. Towards the end of the 14th century, Sarai is enumerated among the Latin bishoprics in Asia (Yule's Cathay, p. 172). For further particulars on Sarai and its position, see Yule's M. Polo, vol. i, pp. 5, 6.\n\nEdrisi writes Kipchak (Ritter, l. c. vol. v, p. 702).\n\nEvidently the Kipchaks are here confounded with the Russians.\n\nAll these names are unknown to me.\n\nRashid-eddin states, that Khudu, a Merkit prince attempted to flee to Kipchak, but was slain by the Mongols (Berezin, vol. i, p. 78). In the biography of Subutai (Yuan shi, chap. cxxi) also it is stated, that \u706b\u90fd Huo-du, chief of the Merkits fled to the Kin-ch'a. He was pursued by Su-bu-tai, who vanquished the Kin-ch'a at \u7389\u8c37 Yu-yu. The Mohammedan\nChinghiz demanded his delivery, which was refused, when the emperor gave orders to attack Kin-ch'a. When I-no-sze became old, his realm was troubled by insurrections; and his son Hu-lu-su-man then determined to send envoys to Chinghiz, and offered his submission. Meng-k'o (Mangu,\u2014subsequently emperor) received orders to occupy Kin-ch'a. Hu-lu-su-man's son Ban-du-ch'a surrendered with his people. Black-mare's milk\u2014which was very pleasant to the taste\u2014used to be sent from Kin-ch'a to the court of China; whence the Kin-ch'a were called also \u54c8\u523a\u8d64 Ha-la-ch'i. T'u-t'u-ha, whose biography is found in the Yuan shi, was a son of Ban-du-ch'a. He died in 1279. His son Chuang-wu-r who died in 1322, was also a renowned general; and his son Yien-tie-mu-r (see his special biography in chap. cxxxviii) was a minister of China 1328\u20141333. Yien-tie-mu-r's brother San-tun, was also minister; as was San-tun's son likewise.\n\nThe name Kin-ch'a appears also in the biographies of the following persons, who belonged to that people.\n\nChap. cxxiii,\u2014Shan-ch'e ba-du-r. Chap. cxxxii,\u2014Wun-djo-du. Ibid.,\u2014Bo-tie-mu-r. Chap. cxxxiii,\u2014Wan-djo ba-du-r. Ibid.,\u2014Si-du-r. His father's name was T'o-sun.\n\n\u963f\u7f85\u601d A-lo-sze = Russia.\n\n153. A-lo-sze is the Chinese mode of spelling the Mongol Oros, by which name the Russians are known to the Mongols even to the present day.\n\nThe name of Russia is not of very ancient origin. We learn from the Byzantine authors, a. d. 865, that under the reign of the emperor Michael III, a heathen people, previously unknown, arrived from Scythia at the Bosphorus in two hundred ships and besieged Constantinople. The name of this people was Ross. The emperor Michael, who at that time was at war with the Arabs in Asia, made haste to return to deliver his capital; and the fleet of the Ross sailed away. Subsequently Greek missionaries were sent among the Ross, many of whom were converted. It is a remarkable fact, that about the same time, the name of Ross first appears in the Russian annals.\n\nThe oldest Arabic author who mentions the Russians, is Ibn\n\nauthors also record the appearance of the Merkits conducted by their chief, Tuk Togan, north of the Aral lake, and their pursuit by the Mongols (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 208).\n\nKhara in Mongol means \"black.\" Rashid-eddin terms one of the five principal tribes of the Turks,\u2014to which the Kipchaks also belonged,\u2014Kalladij.\n\nCompare Photii Epistolae (Photius, 891), and Sophocles' \"Greek Lexicon of the Roman and Byzantine periods.\"\nFozlan, who accompanied an embassy from the court of Bagdad to Bulgar, A.D. 921. He gives detailed and very curious accounts of them (compare Fraehn's Ibn Fozlan. St. Petersburg, 1823, p. 5), stating among other things, that he never saw people of more perfectly developed form; they were tall as palm trees, and of ruddy countenance; but at the same time the most uncleanly people that God had created, drunken and frightfully gross in their manners.\n\nThe Ross or Russians are spoken of by all the Arabic and Persian geographers and historians, from the 10th to the 14th century (Massudi, Edrisi, Ibn Alverdi, Yacut, Abulfeda, etc.); and of course also by Ala-eddin, Juveni and Rashid.\n\nWe have seen from the records of the Russian, Mohammedan, Chinese and Mongol chronicles (see above, Part IV), that the Mongols first became acquainted with the Russians in 1223, when Subutai invaded the countries north of the Caucasus. The Russians were then defeated, together with the Kipchaks on the river Kalka. Fourteen years later, Russia was again attacked by the Mongol armies (Part V). They appeared on the eastern frontier, ravaged northern Russia in the winter of 1237\u20141238, and in 1230 devastated the southern principalities. After returning from Hungary in 1242, Batu established his residence near the lower Volga. His dynasty is known to the Mohammedan authors under the name of Desht Kipchak, whilst the Russian annals term it the Golden Horde. Russia was for more than two hundred years under its yoke. The Russian grand-dukes and all her other princes were forced to repair to the court of the Golden Horde to pay homage. Whoever attempted to disobey, or incurred the khan's displeasure, met with death at the hands of the Mongol executioner. Thus e.g. Michael of Chernigov, who refused to bow before the Mongol idols, was executed in the ordo of Batu khan in 1246. The tragedy is reported with some detail in the Russian annals, as well as by Carpini (621), who speaks as an eye-witness. Another cruel execution of a Russian prince, is recorded under the reign of Uzbeg khan. After the death of the grand-duke Andre\u00ef of Vladimir, two Russian princes, Michael of Twer and Yury of Moscow disputed the throne. Yury was defeated by Michael, and the wife of the former, being a sister of Uzbeg, was made prisoner and died soon after. Michael was then summoned\n\n---\n\nRasmussen in his pamphlet, De Orientis commercio cum Russia et Scandinavia medio \u00e6vo, 1825, translates many details respecting the Russians, from Arabic and Persian medieval authors. One curious passage there, about the uncleanness of the Russians reads as follows (p. 35):\u2014\"Omnium sunt sordidissimi: neque se mandant post alvi dejectionem, neque post pollutionem vel coitum se abluunt, ac si asini errantes essent.\"\nto appear before the khan, who at that time was travelling towards Derbend. Michael obeyed and was cruelly put to death in 1319. His son Dmitry was executed in 1325.\n\n154. After Russia was subdued by the Mongols, the grand-duke Yaroslav II of Vladimir (1238\u20141247) appeared in person before Batu, who acknowledged his supremacy over the other Russian principalities. Yaroslav sent his son Constantine to Karakorum to the Great khan Ogotai. Constantine returned in 1245, after having been absent for two years (Russian annals;\u2014Karamzin, vol. iv, pp. 31, 295). A few years later, Yaroslav was again summoned to repair with his family to Batu's ordo, and then forced to proceed to the court of the Great khan, to exculpate himself on account of some denunciations brought against him by one of the Russian noblemen. After an audience with Kuyuk khan, Yaroslav was allowed to return. He died on his way home however, in September, 1246, and his body was carried to Vladimir.\n\n---\n\nCarpini, who spent more than three months (July to November, 1246) at the court of Kuyuk khan near Karakorum, saw Yaroslav there. According to this traveller, the grand-duke had been poisoned, and died at the court during his own residence there. He writes, pp. 761, 762:\u2014\"Eodem tempore mortuus fuit Ieroslaus, dux magnus in quaedam parte Rusciae quae Susdal nominatur. Hic modo fuit vocatus ad matrem Imperatoris, quae dedit ei manducare et bibere, quasi pro honore, de manu ipsius; et reversus est ad hospicium incontinenti, et infirmatus, et fuit mortuus post septem dies, et totum corpus ejus miro modo factum est glaucum; quare credebatur ab omnibus quod potionatus esset ibidem, ut suam terram liberet et plenari\u00e8 possiderent: et ad hoc est argumentum quod incontinenti, neicientibus hominibus suis qui erant ibi, misit nuncium festinante in Rusciam ad Alexandrum filium ejus ut veniret ad ipsam, quia vellat ei terram patris dare; qui ire noluit, sed remansit: et medio tempore dabat litteras ut ipse veniret ut terram patris sui haberet. Credebatur tamen ab omnibus quod eum occideret si veniret, vel etiam perpetuo captivaret.\" Susdal is the name of a city north of Vladimir. It was in ancient times the capital of a considerable principality, belonging originally to the house of Yaroslav, grand-duke of Vladimir. Carpini therefore is correct in calling him duke of Susdal. As to Yaroslav's son Alexander, mentioned by Carpini, the latter speaks of the Russian hero Alexander Nevsky, thus named on account of the victory he gained over the Swedes in 1240 on the river Neva. Yaroslav is again mentioned in Carpini's narrative, p. 771, in the chapter\u2014De testibus qui in terr\u00e2 Tartarorum nos invenerunt.\u2014\"In reversione in terram Biserminorum (see above, 41), in civitate Lemfinc (1) invenimus Ugneum, qui de mandato axoris Ieroslai et Batib ibat ad predictum Ierosalam, et Cocteleban et omnem societatem ejus. Isti omnes reversi sunt in terram Susdalensium in Rusci\u00e2; a quibus poterit, si oportuerit, veritas inveniri. Apud Mauci (1) invenerunt socios nostros qui remanserant dux Ieroslaus et societas ejus; etc.\" On p. 749 he alludes to the journey of some Russians, who went through the country of the Kan-kalis to join Yaroslav (see above, 64):\u2014\"Post hoc terram intravimus Canditarum quae magnum habet in pluribus locis penuriam aquarum; in qua etiam homines panci morantur propter aquae defectum: und\u00e8 homines Ieroslai ducis Russiae, qui in terram Tartarorum ibant ad ipsum, fuerunt, propter situm, plures mortui in illo deserto.\"\nAlexander Nevsky, prince of Novgorod, the son of Yaroslav, was also obliged to undertake the painful journey to the Great khan; in which he was accompanied by his younger brother Andrei. They returned in 1249, and three years later he ascended the throne of Vladimir.\n\nThe subjection of Russia to the khans of the Golden Horde, referred chiefly to the tribute the Russians were obliged to pay. At first the khans farmed out the tribute, due by the Russians, to some Mohammedan merchants (called Bussurman merchants in the Russian annals;\u2014Karamzin, vol. iv, p. 329), and the tax-gatherers collected the dues with the greatest rigour and cruelty. They were assisted by Mongol officers, called baskaks in the Russian annals (l. c. vol. iv, p. 97). In the 14th century, the Russian princes succeeded in obtaining permission to collect the taxes themselves, and to carry the tribute directly to the khans. Besides the heavy taxes, there was another duty imposed on them by the Mongols. At the demand of the khan, they had to supply troops and fight against the enemies of the Mongols. We shall see further on, that in the time of Kubilai, a division composed of Russian soldiers was met with even in China. As to the administration of Russia however, and its political relations, the Mongols did not change the then existing state of things. The grand-dukes and princes were allowed to rule their people as they liked, and the Christian religion was also respected. Karamzin gives (vol. iv, p. 179) the translation of a yarlykh, or written patent, granted in the beginning of the 14th century to the Russian clergy, by Uzbeg khan. This patent exempted the clergy from taxation.\n\nAfter the death of Uzbeg (1312\u20141342), the dynasty of the Golden Horde began to decline. The first attempt to profit by this debility of the Mongols was made by Dmitry, grand-duke of Moscow, who in 1380 defeated the khan Mamai with great slaughter. This memorable battle, known in Russian history as the battle of the \"field of snipes\" (kulikowoye polye), was fought at the place where the river Nepriavda discharges into the Don. Dmitry received the surname Donskoi on this account. This brilliant victory did not break down the Mongol power however; for a few years later, Mamai's successor Tokhtamysh unexpectedly appeared at Moscow, and sacked and burnt the capital, when Dmitry again became a vassal of the Mongols. At the end of the 14th century, the khanate of the Golden Horde experienced a serious shock by the invasions of Tamerlane; and in 1395, when pursuing Tokhtamysh, Tamerlane advanced as far as Yelets (near the river\n\n---\n\n** Compare Carpini, p. 703\u2014\"Baschates sive prefectos suos ponunt in terr\u00e2 illorum quos redire permittunt; etc.\"\nDon, in the province of Orel), devastating the land adjacent to the Don. After the conqueror left Russia, the grand-duke Vassily I (1389\u20141425), refused to Tokhtamysh the payment of tribute; but he had under-estimated the power of the khan, who in 1408 arrived with a great host, and imposed a heavy fine on Moscow as indemnity. In the first half of the 15th century, the Mongol empire of Kipchak was much weakened, owing to the rise of two other khanates, viz. those of Kazan and the Crimea. The subjection of Russia to the Golden Horde then became quite nominal, and the tribute paid to the khans consisted merely in presents sent from time to time by the grand-dukes, who were on good terms with the Horde of the Crimea. The Mongol dynasty of Kipchak, or the Golden Horde, was destroyed in 1502, by Mengli Girei, khan of the Crimea; and in Russian history this date marks the end of the period designated by the name \"the Mongol yoke.\"\n\n155. It seems that Russia was unknown to the nations of eastern Asia before the Mongol period. In the Mongol and Chinese annals, the Russians are first mentioned after Subutai's invasion of southern Russia, in 1223. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi terms Russia or the Russians Orus, as they are called even now by the Mongols. The Chinese of the Mongol period write \u963f\u7f85\u601d A-lo-sze, sometimes also \u963f\u7f85\u601d Wa-lo-sze or \u5143\u9b6f\u601d U-lu-sze. All these names evidently render the Mongol appellation Orus.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, the name of Russia is frequently met with. Regarding the Chinese and Mongol accounts of the conquest of Russia, I beg to refer to Parts IV and V of my paper, where all the information on this subject has been collected. I may notice here some other instances, where the Russians are spoken of in the Yuan shi.\n\nWe read in the Annals, sub anno 1253, that the emperor Meng-k'o ordered \u5fc5\u95cd\u5225\u5152\u54e5 Bi-dje Bie-r-k'o to be sent to Wu-lo-sze (Russia), in order to take a census of the people.\n\n---\n\n*100* I may observe, that no word in Mongol begins with the consonant r. Thus the Mongols in rendering the word Russ, prefix a vowel to the name.\n\n*110* This statement seems to be corroborated by the Russian annals, in which it is recorded (but a few years later), that in 1257, Mongol officers arrived at Suzdal, Riazan and Murom, to take a census of the people, and special officers were appointed to collect the taxes, when none but the clergy were exempt. In the year 1259, two Mongol officers, named Berkai and Kassachik, arrived with their families and many Mongols on the banks of the river Volkhov, in order to number the Russian people. This measure caused a revolt in Novgorod (Karamzin, vol. iv, pp. 71, 74). I am inclined to identify the Berkai of the Russian annals with the Bi-dje Bie-r-k'o in the Yuan shi. Bi-dje, properly \u5fc5\u95cd\u8d64 Bi-dje-ch'i, is a Mongol title, which may be translated by \"secretary.\" The dictionary appended to the new edition of the Yuan shi (see above,\u2014Introduction) explains the term by\nIt is an interesting fact, recorded in the Yuan shi, that there was in the beginning of the 14th century, a settlement of Russians near Peking. We read in the Annals, sub anno 1330, chap. xxxiv, that the emperor Wen-tsung (Tob timur,\u20141329\u20141332,\u2014the great-grandson of Kubilai) formed a regiment composed of U-lo-sze or \"Russians.\" This regiment, being commanded by a wan-hu (commander of ten thousand of the third degree, received the name \u5ba3\u5fe0\u5143\u7f85\u601d\u61c9\u885b\u89aa\u8ecd Siian-chung U-lo-sze hu-wei ts'in-k\u00fcn, \"the ever faithful Russian life-guard.\" It was placed under the direct control of the council of war. Further on in the same chapter it is stated, that one hundred and thirty king of land, north of \u5927\u90fd Tu-tu (Peking), was bought from the peasants and allotted to these Russians, to establish a camp and to form a military colony. We read again in the same chapter:\u2014\"They were furnished with implements of agriculture, and were bound to present for the imperial table, every kind of game, fish, etc. found in the forests, rivers and lakes of the country where their camp was situated.\" The Russian regiment is again mentioned in chap. xxxv.\n\nIn chap. xxxvi of the Yuan shi, mention is made in three places, of Russian prisoners sent to the emperor of China.\n\nIn the year 1232, the prince Djang-gi presented a hundred and seventy Russian prisoners, and received a pecuniary reward. On the same page we read that clothes and corn were bestowed on a thousand Russians.\n\nIn the same year the prince Yen-t'ie-mu-r presented fifteen hundred Russian prisoners to the Chinese emperor;\n\n\u5beb\u5b57\u4eba. In modern Mongol, \"a letter,\" is bichik. In Rashid's \"History of the Mongols,\" we often meet with the term bitikchis. D'Ohsson (tom. iv, pp. 871, 880, 381, 410) translates it by \"officiers du d\u00e9partement des finances.\" According to the Yuan shi, chap. lxxv, there were in the hu-pu or \"board of revenue,\" seven bi-dje-ch'i. Cf. chap. xcix, on the emperor's body-guard. There the emperor's secretaries are called bi-dje-ch'i (\u5929\u5b50\u4e3b\u6587\u53f2\u8005\u66f0\u5fc5\u95cd\u8d64).\n\nIt seems from this latter statement, that the Russian colony was established somewhere about the southern border of Mongolia.\n\nThe prince Djang-gi here, is probably the Djinkshi of the Mohammedian authors, noticed as khan of the middle empire between 1330 and 1333. He reigned only a short time (see D'Ohsson, tom. iv, Geneal. tables). The khans of the middle empire were often at war with the khans of Kipchak, and thus it is not unlikely, that Russian soldiers had been made prisoners by Djinkshi.\n\nThe genealogical table of Chinghiz khan's house in the Yuan shi, chap. cvii, mentions a prince Yen-t'ie-mu-r, a descendant of Kubilai khan's brother Bo-ch'e. It is however difficult to understand how he should have captured one thousand five hundred Russians. The annals speak probably of another prince of this name.\nand another prince, \u963f\u5152\u52a0\u5931\u91cc A-r-gia shi-li, presented thirty.\n\nFinally, in the biography of Bo-yen (chap. cxxxviii), he is stated to have been appointed (in 1334) commander of the emperor's life-guard, composed of Mongols, Kin-ch'a (Kipchaks) and Russians.\n\nSuch is all I have been able to find in the Yuan shi regarding the Russians. It seems that no one of the Russians in the service of the Mongol emperors in China has played a conspicuous part. At least among the biographies in the Yuan shi the Russians have no representatives, whilst many distinguished statesmen and captains of the Mongol-Chinese empire were from the Kipchaks, Kan-kalis, Alans and other nations subdued by the Mongols.\n\nI am not aware, that any mention is made of Russia by Chinese authors of the Ming period. All that we know of the intercourse between Russia and China during that dynasty, is the narrative of a Russian embassy to the Chinese court, in the beginning of the 17th century. In 1619, the prince Kurakin, Russian military governor of Tobolsk, sent two Cossacks, Ipashka Petlin and Potunka Kusselep, from Tomsk through Mongolia to Kalgan and Peking. Compare Fisher's \"History of Siberia,\" 1774 (in Russian), p. 267; and Bergeron, Trait\u00e9 des Tartares, p. 106.\n\nIt does not come within the scope of this paper, to record the political and commercial intercourse between Russia and China during the present dynasty. An interesting pamphlet on this subject was published a few years ago by my friend and colleague Dr. J. Dudgeon. I may therefore confine myself to the remark, that the present Chinese official name for Russia is \u4fc4\u7f85\u65af O-lo-sze; being in fact the same as in the Yuan period, only represented by other characters.\n\n\u4e0d\u91cc\u963f\u8033 Bu-li-a-r = Bulgar.\n\n156. Both copies of the map write this name \u4e0d\u601d\u963f\u8033 Bu-sze-a-r and place it east of Russia; but the list in the Si-pei-ti has Bu-li-a-r, which is the correct reading; for it is evidently Bulgar to the east of the Volga that is meant. According to the Bibl. Orient. the Mohammedan authors call Bulgar also Bular.\n\nBulgar\\(^{214}\\) was the name of a rich country situated on the Volga and the Kama. The capital of it had the same name. It was a renowned emporium in the middle ages, and also a centre of Mohammedan learning. The Bulgars seem to have been a mixture of Finns, Slavs and Turks (Fraehn). The ruins of the ancient city of Bulgar still exist, and have been the subject of learned investigation.\n\n\\(^{214}\\) The name of the river Volga and Bulgar are probably the same word. See Bibl. Orient. p. 305, art. \"Efil,\" where it is stated, that some oriental geographers call the Volga, \"Bulgar.\"\nby several Russian scholars (Pallas, Fraehn, Erdmann, etc.). In 1853, the Russian orientalist Prof. Berezin published an interesting pamphlet,\u2014\u201cBulgar on the Volga\u201d (in Russian), in which detailed accounts are given of the antiquities of the place. The remains of ancient Bulgar are found on the spot, where now the village of Uspenskoye (called also Bolgarskoye) stands, in the district of Spassk, and province of Kazan. This village is six versts (four English miles) distant from the Volga, on the east, and one hundred and twenty-five versts from Kazan. Prof. Berezin proves, that there is no reason for the view, suggested by some authors, that the city of Bulgar in the 10th century was not on the same site as the Bulgar of the time of the Mongols. According to a work published in the Tatar language, in the first half of the 16th century, and translated by Berezin, Islam penetrated to Bulgar at an early date,\u2014in the 9th year of the Hegira. Massudi (A.D. 943) however states, that the king of Bulgar embraced Islam in the beginning of the 10th century (Klaproth, Magaz. Asiat. tom. i, p. 270). Col. Yule thinks, that the Bulgars, before they had been converted to Islamism professed Christianity; but the above-mentioned Tatar work, translated by Berezin states, that the Bulgars were fire worshippers before they embraced Islamism.\n\nBulgar is of course mentioned by the Russian chroniclers at an early date of Russian history; i.e. in the 10th century, and also by the Byzantine authors; but the fullest ancient account of Bulgar which we possess, is that of Ibn Fozlan, an Arabic writer, who accompanied an embassy from the court of Bagdad to Bulgar, A.D. 921 (compare Fraehn\u2019s translation of this narrative).\n\nAccording to Ebn Haukal (10th century) and Edrisi (12th century), Bulgar was the limit of the countries towards the north, known to the orientals. Most of the old Arabic writers tell wonders of the cold and the brief summer nights in Bulgar. Peltrey, wax, honey, hazel-nuts and Russian leather, formed the staple articles of trade. The last item derived from Bulgar the name which it still bears all over Asia (Yule\u2019s M. Polo, vol. i, p. 6).\n\nAccording to the Mohammedan authors (D\u2019Ohsson, tom. i, p. 345), the Mongols first invaded the country of Bulgar at the end of 1223 (under Subutai;\u2014see above, 58); and in 1236, when a new Mongol expedition had been directed to the west, Subutai was again detached with a division to sack the city of Bulgar, when the country submitted (D\u2019Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 111). Colonel Yule states (l.c. vol. i, p. 7) that Bulgar was first captured by the Mongols in 1225; but he does not say whence his information is derived. Prof. Berezin, in the afore-mentioned pamphlet (p. 61), mentions a strange Arabic inscription very frequently met with, not only among the ruins of Bulgar, but also in some other places\nin the province of Kazan. This inscription reads meaning literally, *adventus oppressionis*. Berezin thinks, that this inscription is an allusion to the Mongol invasion. The anagram of the Arabic letters converted into numbers gives the year 623 of the Hegira, or A.D. 1226. It does not appear however, from the Mohammedan records above quoted, that the Bulgars had been troubled in that year.\n\nBerezin states further (p. 63), that all the ruins of Bulgar belong to the Mohammedan period (10th to 15th century), and that the most ancient inscriptions found there cannot be traced back earlier than the Mongol invasion. The same writer proves also, that Bulgar even in the days of the Mongols, had preserved its importance as a place of trade and a centre of Mohammedan learning.\n\nCarpini, in his narrative, mentions the Bulgars three times (pp. 677, 708, 747) and always under the double name of \"Bileri id est magna Bulgaria.\"\n\nRubruquis, p. 252, states:\u2014\"Post istos est Etilia (Volga), que est major fluvius quam unquam viderim, et venit ab aquilone, de majori Bulgaria tendens ad meridiem, etc.\"\n\nM. Polo (*l.c.* vol. i, p. 4) states, that Barca Kaan (see note 299) was accustomed to reside at Sara and Bolgara.\n\nThe well-known Arabian traveller Ibn Batuta visited Bolgar in the middle of the 14th century, in order to witness with his own eyes the shortness of the northern summer nights. North of Bulgar was the land of darkness (*Yule's Cuthay*, p. 401).\n\nIn the *Yuan ch'ao pi shi*, the name of Bulgar is rendered by *Bular* (see above). In the *Yuan shi*, Bulgar is only once mentioned, i.e. in the list of the Si-pei-ti. The *Yuan shi* does not record the capture of Bulgar by Su-bu-tai.\n\nThe city of Bulgar seems to have perished early in the 15th century, after which Kazan practically took its place (*Yule, l.c.* vol. i, p. 7).\n\n\u6492\u5409\u523a Sa-gi-la = Solgat. (?)\n\n157. The identification of this name presents some difficulty. On the map it is placed west of Russia. The only place, the\n\n---\n\nBy Little Bulgaria in the middle ages, was understood, the country inhabited by those Bulgars, who had emigrated to the Danube in the 5th century. The Russian annals state, that in the second half of the 10th century, Sviatoslav invaded the country of the Bulgars on the Danube. The Catalan map applies the name *Bulgaria* to the country south of the lower Danube, which even now bears the same name. Opposite Bulgaria, north of the Danube, we read on the Catalan map the name *Burgaria*, whilst the original country of the Bulgars, east of the Volga is termed there *Borgar*.\nmedieval name of which has some resemblance to Sa-gi-la is Sol-\ngat, which was an ancient appellation for the Crimea, on the\nsouth-eastern coast of which Soldaya or Soldachia was situated in\nthe 13th century, the great port of intercourse with what is now\nRussia. The place was called Sudak by the orientals. It was\ntaken by the Mongols in 1223.\n\nThe name of Sa-gi-la has also some resemblance to Sarkel, which\nwas an ancient fortress in the country of the Khazars, according\nto Constantine Porphyrogenitus, who wrote in the 10th century;\nbut Sarkel is not noticed by the writers of the 13th and 14th\ncenturies.\n\n\u963f\u862d\u963f\u601d A-lan A-sze = Alans or Ases.\n\n158. This name is intended for the people termed \"Alani sive\nAssi\" by Carpini (p. 709), and \"Alani sive Aas\" by Rubruquis.\n\nThe Alans, a people settled north of the Caucasus, have been\nknown to the Roman and Greek authors since the beginning of\nour era. They are mentioned in the 1st century by Suetonius,\nLucan and Pliny. The Greek author Lucian (2nd century) terms\nthem Alanoi. Ammianus Marcellinus (4th century) gives a full\naccount of the Alans. Vologesus, king of the Parthians, is re-\nported to have called upon Vespasian (A.D. 69\u201479) for assistance\nagainst this people. Arrian, when he was governor of Cappadocia\n(2nd century), waged war with the Alans. In the 5th century,\nthe Alans accompanied the Sueves and Vandals, when they\ninvaded Gaul.\n\nIn the second half of the 6th century, Zemarchus the Cilician,\nwho had been sent by the Byzantine emperor Justin to the Turks,\non his way back visited the chief of the Alans (Yule's Cathay,\np. clxvi). Constantine Porphyrogenitus (middle of the 10th\ncentury) states, that the country of the Alans is situated beyond\n(i.e., north of) the Caucasus mountains (Klaproth, Asia Poly-\nglotta, p. 85). Klaproth in his Maqaz. Asiat. tom. i, pp. 258\u2014\n302, gives a translation of Massudi's (A.D. 943) account of the\nCaucasus and the countries on the confines of the Black sea and\nthe Caspian. Massudi calls the Alans,\u2014Lan, and their resi-\ndence\u2014Maae. He states, that these people in former times were\nidolaters. They embraced the Christian religion in the time of\nthe Abbaside califs; but in 320 of the Hegira (beginning of\nthe 10th century), they repudiated this faith and drove away the\nbishops sent by the emperor of Constantinople. The same author\ntells us, that in the middle of the country of the Alans, among the\nCaucasus mountains, there is a fort, and a bridge spanning a large\nriver. The fort is called the castle of the Alan gate. It was\nbuilt in ancient times by a king of Persia, to prevent the invasion of the Alans.\\footnote{Klaproth thinks that the Alan gate was at Darion on the river Terek, not far from mount Kazbek, where the great road from Tiflis to Russia now passes.}\n\nIn the Russian annals, the Alans are always termed \\textit{Yasy}. In A.D. 936, Swiatoslav is reported to have captured the city of Bielowej on the Don, belonging to the Khazars, and to have waged war with the \\textit{Yasy}\\footnote{Deguignes (tom. iv, p. 344) tries to identify the Yasy, spoken of in the Russian annals, (misunderstood by him) with the Yazyges south of Lithuania.} and the \\textit{Kassogy}. The Yasy are also spoken of by the Russian chroniclers of the 13th century, as a people near the Caucasus, beyond the river Terek (Karamzin, vol. iv, pp. 119, 355).\n\nThe Mongols, when they had passed the Caucasus in 1223, found the Alans living on the northern skirts of those mountains. Fifteen years later, the Alans became subject to Batu khan, after they had made a stout resistance to the Mongols. The Mohammedan historians, who report the expeditions against this people, call them indiscriminately \\textit{Alans} or \\textit{Asi} (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, pp. 619, 620).\n\nCarpini and Rubruquis, as we have seen, also identify the \\textit{Alans} and \\textit{Asi}. The former mentions their settlements south of Comania (p. 748). Rubruquis (p. 246) says:\u2014\u201cIn hac solebant pascere Comani, qui dicuntur Capthat; a Teutonicis vero dicuntur Valani, et provincia Valania. Ab Ysidoro vero dicitur, a flumine Tanay (Don) usque paludes Meotidis et Danubium, Alania.\u201d On p. 252 we read:\u2014\u201cHabebamus autem ad meridiem montes maximos, in quibus habitant, in lateribus versus solitudinem illam, Cherkiis et Alani, sive Aas, qui sunt christiani et adhuc pugnant contra Tartaros.\u201d On. p. 243 Rubruquis says:\u2014\u201cIn vigilia Pentecostes venerunt ad nos quidam Alani, qui ibi dicuntur Aas, christiani secundum ritum Graecorum, et habentes litteras grecas et sacerdotes grecos. Tamen non sunt scismatici sicut Greci, sed sine acceptione persone venerantur omnem christianum, etc.\u201d\n\nM. Polo (vol. ii, p. 421) mentions \\textit{Alania} among the countries conquered by the Mongols; and in another place (vol. ii, p. 140), devotes a whole chapter to the history of the slaughter of certain Alans, who were Christians, and formed a corps in Kubilai\u2019s army. This slaughter took place in the city of Chinginju (\\textit{Chang-chou fu} in Kiangsu).\n\nMarignolli (middle of the 14th century) writes regarding the \\textit{Alans} (Yule\u2019s \\textit{Cathay}, p. 373):\u2014\u201cThey form at this day the greatest and noblest nation in the world, the fairest and bravest of...\u201d\nmen. 'Tis by their aid that the Tartars have won the empire of the east, and without them they have never gained a single important victory. For Chinguis Caan, the first king of the Tartars, had seventy-two of their princes serving under him, when he went forth under God's providence to scourge the world.\"\n\nKlaproth (Asia Polyglotta, p. 82) identifies the Alans or Assy (and the like) with the Osethi, a people still found in the Caucasus, north of Georgia. He states, that they are known to the Georgians under the name of Ost. Vivien de St. Martin however, has adduced reasons against this identification; though he considers both tribes to have been originally members of one great stock of Asi, who by different routes and at times widely separated, severally found their way from central Asia to the region of the Caucasus. According to the same authority, the Georgians, who always distinguished between the Alanethi and Osethi, still recognize a people of the former branch in the interior of the Abaz country (Yule, l. c. p. 317).\n\n159. Col. Yule states (l. c. p. 316):\u2014\u201cThe Alans were known to the Chinese by that name, in the ages immediately preceding and following the Christian era, as dwelling near the Aral, in which original position they are believed to have been closely akin to, if not identical with, the famous Massagetae.\u201d\n\nThis statement, respecting the early knowledge possessed by the Chinese of the Alans, brought forward by Col. Yule, probably on the authority of Deguignes (tom. ii, p. 279), requires some elucidation and correction. I may be allowed to show on what facts Deguignes' identification is based. In the \u201cHistory of the Anterior Han (B. C. 202\u2014A. D. 25),\u201d chap. xcvi, a realm \u5944\u8521 Yen-t'sai is spoken of, 2,000 li north-west of K'ang-k\u00fc (Samarkand;\u2014see above, 141). The people of this country are stated to be nomades, and to resemble the people of K'ang-k\u00fc. It is further stated, that Yen-t'sai is situated on a great lake (\u6e56, properly a marsh), with flat shores, which is called the Northern sea. In the \u201cHistory of the Later Han (A. D. 25\u2014221),\u201d chap. cxviii, Yen-t'sai is again mentioned, and it is noticed there, that the name of the country had been changed to \u963f\u862d\u963f A-lan-ya (Deguignes' Alans). In the \u201cHistory of the Wei (386\u2014558),\u201d mention is made of a kingdom \u7c9f\u7279 Su-t'e, north-west of K'ang-k\u00fc, situated on a great lake, and anciently called Yen-t'sai and \u6e29\u90a3\u6c99 Wen-na-sha. I am unable to decide, whether these vague accounts\n\n---\n\nAs I shall show further on, Marignolli's statement about the prominent position of the Alans in the Mongol-Chinese empire, is fully corroborated by the Yilan shi; but he is mistaken as to the Alans in Chinghiz khan's service. As we have seen, the country of the Alans was only conquered under the reign of Ogotai.\nof Yen-t'sai and the resemblance of the name A-lan-ya with Alania are sufficient to establish the identity of these names. At any rate it cannot be ascertained that the Alans were known to the Chinese by that name before the Christian era.\n\nWe learn from the Yuan shi, that during the Mongol period, the Alans were not only well known in China, but their nation furnished many able officers to the Mongol-Chinese empire. Several of them held high offices, or distinguished themselves as valiant captains. Among the biographies in the Yuan shi, more than twenty meritorious Alans, some of them of royal blood, have been immortalized, and besides these the names of many others are mentioned there.\n\nThey are generally termed \u963f\u901f A-su, and sometimes also \u963f\u601d A-sze. The name A-lan occurs there only once, viz. in the Si-pei-ti, where the name is coupled with A-sze, as it is on the map. As we have seen, the Yuan shi mentions the A-su first in the year 1223 (see above, 59).\n\nI may give a list of the Alans, whose names appear in the biographies of the Yuan shi.\n\nChap. cxxxii.\u2014\u676d\u5ffd\u601d Hang-hu-sze (the name is also written Ang-ho-sze). When the army of the emperor Ogota had reached the country of the A-su, the ruler of it, named Hang-hu-sze, surrendered spontaneously; whereupon the emperor granted him the title \u62d4\u90fd\u5152 ba-du-r (bahadur), and a golden tablet of authority, confirming him as the ruler of his principality. Order was given also to form a regiment of a thousand men of the A-su people (for the life-guard of the khan). Hang-hu-sze had two sons, \u963f\u5854\u8d64 A-t'a-ch'i and \u5b89\u6cd5\u666e An-fa-p'u; the former of whom took service in the emperor's life-guard. Hang-hu-sze, after he had returned home, was slain in an insurrection, and his widow \u5916\u9ebb\u601d Wai-ma-sze was then placed at the head of the government. She put on armour, quelled the riot, and handed over the power to her son An-fa-p'u.\n\nHang-hu-sze's eldest son A-t'a-ch'i, whose biography is found in chap. cxxxv, was a valiant captain under Mangu and Kubilai, and distinguished himself in China in the war against the Sung. He had a son named Bo-tu-r, who was the father of O-lo-sze, who had two sons Du-dan and Fu-ding. All these were officers in the Mongol army.\n\nIn chap. cxxxii, is also the biography of \u7389\u54c7\u5931 Y\u00fc-wa-shi, another Alan, who distinguished himself as captain during the reign of Kubilai. He was sent against the revolted princes in the north-west (Kaidu, etc.), and carried the Mongol arms as far as the country of I-bi-r Shi-bi-r (Siberia;\u2014see above, 118). The\nfather of Y\u00fc-wa-shi, by name Ye-lie ba-du-r (Elias bahadur,\u2014also a prince it seems) had surrendered at the same time as Hang-hu-sze. Others of Y\u00fc-wa-shi's descendants are also mentioned.\n\nIn chap. cxxiii, we have the biography of the A-su (or Alan) Nie-gu-la (Nicholas), who is stated to have surrendered at the same time as Ye-li-ya A-su (probably the afore-mentioned Elias is meant) and others, thirty-eight in all. Nie-gu-la was with the emperor Mangu, when he waged war in China with the Sung. His son A-t'a-ch'i (this name occurs for the second time as an Alan) distinguished himself at the siege of Siang-yang fu, and in the expedition against the revolted prince No-yen. In the reign of the emperor Jen-tsung 1312\u20141321, he was still active. His son Kiao-hua held a high office at court.\n\nIn the same chapter we find also the biography of the A-su prince A-r-sze-lan. It is stated there that his city was besieged by Mangu, when A-r-sze-lan together with his son A-san-djen repaired to the camp of that prince, and offered his submission. The Mongol granted A-r-sze-lan a patent to rule his people the A-su, but enrolled half of A-r-sze-lan's troops in his own life-guard, whilst the other half was left to him, to protect his dominions. A-san-djen remained with Mangu, but was subsequently killed, when fighting against the revolted troops of She-r-k'o. Mangu ordered his body to be embalmed and sent back to his native country. When A-r-sze-lan had been informed of the death of his son, he said\u2014\"My eldest son is cut off in early life, before he could be of service to the emperor. There is my second son Nie-gu-lai (Nicholas), whom I offer to your Magesty.\" Nie-gu-lai was a valiant warrior, and took part in Wu-liang-ho-dai's expedition to Ha-djang (the Karadjang of Rashid,\u2014Y\u00fcnnan). He left a son Hu-r-du-da, who, by order of Kubilai accompanied Bu-lu no-yen when he was sent to the country of Ha-r-ma-mou. Hu-r-du-da had a son Hu-du t'io-mu-r. All these served in the emperor's life-guard.\n\nIn chap. cxxxii, we meet with the names of three Alans, who surrendered when Mangu invaded their country, viz Ba-du-r and his brothers U-tso-r-bu-han and Ma-t'ar-sha. The latter was in the avant-guard of the Mongol army when the city of Mai-k'o-sze was stormed (see above, 71).\n\nI do not know whether this is the name of a man or a country.\nIn chap. cxxxv, is the biography of \u53e3\u5152\u5409 K'ou-r-gi (George) a native A-su, who served in the Mongol army during the reign of Kubilai. His father Fu-de-lai-sze had been in the life-guard of the emperor Mangu. K'ou-r-gi's son was called \u7684\u901f\u7684\u5152 Di-mi-di-r (Demetrius).\n\nIn the same chapter are the biographies of two other Alans, Shila ba-du-r and Ch'e-li, both in Kubilai's army. The father of the latter, Bie-gi-ba, had accompanied the emperor Mangu in his expedition against the Sung.\n\nWe may conclude from some of the names of the Alans mentioned in the Yuan shi, that they were Christians.\n\nThe Yuan ch'ao pi shi terms the Alans\u2014Asut, or Asu. I may observe, that Asut is the Mongol plural form of Asu.\n\n\u6492\u8033\u67ef\u601d Sa-r-ko-sze = Circassia.\n\n160. There can be no doubt, that the name Sa-r-ko-sze is intended for the country of the Circassians or Cherkess, as they are termed by Rashid-eddin (Berezin, vol. i, p. 2). In the ancient Russian annals, they appear repeatedly under the name Cherkassy, a name still in use. Compare Karamzin, vol. iv, p. 304 (71), and p. 466 (the people of the Cherkassy afflicted with plague).\n\nRubruquis writes (p. 252):\u2014\"Habebamus autem ad meridiem montes maximos (Caucasus), in quibus habitant, in lateribus versus solitudinem illam, Cherkis et Alanii, sive Aas, etc.\" Some of the manuscripts have Cergis or Kerke instead of Cherkis.\n\nCarpini speaks repeatedly of the Kerkis, but there is some confusion in his narrative as to the application of this name. On pages 678, 679 he seems to mean by Kerkis, the Circassians; for in recording the Mongol conquests in the west, he states:\u2014\n\n\"Chirpodan ver\u00f2 eodem tempore misit Occoday-can cum exercitu ad meridiem contra Kergis, quos in bello devicit . . . . Quibus devictis, ad meridiem ivit contra Armenos.\" But on page 659, where the same name again appears, the Kirghiz seems to be meant:\u2014\n\n\"Chirgis can . . . . . ivit in expeditione contra Orientem (mistake for Occidentem) per terram Kergis, quos bello non victit.\"\n\nOn page 708, where Carpini enumerates in a certain geographical order, the nations subdued by the Mongols, he associates the Kergis with the Bascart (Bashkirs), Sarracens, etc. not with the Alanii and Georgianii.\n\n\u82b1\u524c\u5b50\u6a21 Hua-la-tze-mu = Khorazm.\n\n161. Khorazm is a name of very ancient date. It has been\napplied for long centuries to the country south and south-west of lake Aral. The present khanate of Khiva covers for the greater part ancient Khorazm. The name of Qaraqumia, written in cuneiform characters, is found on the ancient monuments of Persepolis, in the enumeration of the countries and nations of Iran (Ritter's Asia, vol. vi, p. 100). Herodotus, the most ancient of the Greek geographers (5th century B.C.) terms the same country Chorasmia (book iii, ss. 93, 117).\n\nWhen Chinghiz invaded western Asia, the sultan of Khorazm was a powerful sovereign, ruling also over Transoxiana and Iran.\n\nHaithon in his Historia Orientalis (13th century) states, that Khorazm is bordered by a certain desert, and stretches westward as far as the Caspian sea. On the north it is bounded by the kingdom of the Kumans (Kipchaks); on the south (evidently a mistake for east) by Turkistan.\n\nThe ancient capital of Khorazm was Urgendj; which the Mohammedan authors spell Keurcandje, or Orcandje; the latter being, according to D'Ohsson (tom. i, p. 265) the Mongol appellation; the Arabs write Djordjaniah. The city was situated on both banks of the Djihun, i.e. on the ancient channel; for now Kunia Urgendj (or Ancient Urgendj) is far west of the Amu-daria. The Mongols took Urgendj in 1221, after a stout resistance by the inhabitants. It was then destroyed (see above, 51); but it must have recovered to some considerable extent in the next hundred years, according to the accounts given by Pegoletti and Ibn Batuta. Pegoletti in his itinerary (beginning of 14th century) calls it Organici (Yule's Cathay, p. 294). A Franciscan missionary, in a letter dated 1338, speaks of Urganth, a city at the extremity of the empire of the Tartars and the Persians (l.c. p. 234). It is the Urghanj of Marignolli, who visited the place in 1339 (l.c. p. 321). Urgendj was destroyed by Tamerlane in 1378 (Deguignes, tom. v, p. 11), but was subsequently rebuilt.\n\nThere is a curious ancient Russian geographical treatise extant, compiled towards the end of the 16th century, entitled Kniga bolshomu cherteju (\"The Book on the Great Map;\"\u2014cf. Transact. of Russ. Geogr. Soc. 1871, p. 110). In it some distances are given, respecting the routes near the Caspian sea, lake Aral, the Sir-daria and Amu-daria. There Urgendj is called Yurgens; the lake Aral is termed Sineye more (blue sea); the Caspian, Hwalimskoye more (the sea of Hwalim).\n\n---\n\n**220** This desert is marked on Petermann's map (Mittheil. 1873, tab. 9) as Desert of Khorasm south of the khanate of Khiva.\n\n**221** This name for the Caspian sea occurs in the Russian annals as early as the 10th century. The lake Aral was known to the Persians under the name of Lake of Khorazin.\nIn 1603, the Cosacks of the Ural plundered the city of Urgendj, and towards the end of the 17th century it was entirely destroyed by the Kalmuks. In an article on the ancient channel of the Amudaria,\u2014translated from the Russian,\u2014in Petermann's Geogr. Mitth. vol. xx, p. 25, it is stated, that a remarkable tower, about two hundred feet high, has survived from the ancient splendour of Urgendj.\n\nThe Chinese knew Khorazm as early as the 7th century of our era. In the \"T'ang History,\" in the section treating of western countries, we find the following accounts of \u8ca8\u5229\u667a\u7f85 Ho-li-si-mi, called also \u706b\u5c0b Hua-sin and \u904e\u5229 Kuo-li:\u2014\"This country is situated on the river \u9ce5\u6ef8 Wu-hu (the Djihun or Oxus, as has been proved in notes 290, 292). On the south-west it is bounded by \u6ce2\u65af Po-sze (Persia); to the north-west, it extends as far as the \u842c\u85a9 K'o-sa, who belong to the stock of the T'u-k\u00fce (Turks). In this country (of Ho-li-si-mi) in the time of the Han was the city of \u5967\u97ac Ao-gien. The ruler of Ho-li-si-mi resides in \u6025\u591a\u5ead\u906e Ts'i-to-pei-che. Among the countries of the \u80e1 Hu (people of western Asia) this is the only one where carts drawn by oxen are found. The merchants travel in these carts to other countries. Several embassies proceeding from Ho-li-si-mi to the Chinese court are recorded.\"\n\nThe Buddhist monk H\u00fcan-tsang, also,\u2014in his peregrinations from China to India in the 7th century,\u2014passed through Khorazm. He writes the name of this country \u8ca8\u5229\u667a\u7f85\u8fe6 Ho-li-si-mi-kia, and states that this kingdom is situated on both banks of the river \u7d30\u82bb Fo-ch'u, extending from north to south five hundred li, and from east to west twenty or thirty li.\n\nKhiva, the present capital of Khorazm, or the khanate of Khiva, is situated about one hundred English miles south-east of ancient Urgendj. It became the capital of the Uzbek dynasty,\u2014now ruling over Khorazm,\u2014in the 17th century. It seems that a place of that name already existed in the days of Tamerlane. We read in Degnignes, tom. v, p. 5, that the cities of Kath (see above, 145) and Kayuk or Kivek, in 1871, were in the possession of the chief of the Kumkurats (there is probably a connection between these Kumkurats and the city named Kungrat near the mouth of the Amu-daria).\n\nIn the article \u62c2\u83c8 Fo-lin (the Byzantine empire) in the same \"T'ang History,\" it is said that this kingdom is opposite the country of \u53ef\u85a9 K'o-sa. I think that by Ko-sa or K'o-sa, the Khazars are meant.\n\nIn the \"History of the Anterior Han,\" art. Kang-kit (Samarcand,\u2014see above, 141), Ao-kien is mentioned among the small realms dependent on Samarcand, distant about one thousand four hundred li from the latter place.\n\nVatsh or Oxus. See Julien's M\u00e9m. s.l. Contr\u00e9es Occid. tom. i, p. 22.\n\nEvidently the author takes into consideration only the cultivated land in the valley of the Oxus. Even now the khanate of Khiva consists properly only of the valley of the Amu-daria, the rest being deserts.\nIn the Yuan shi, the name of Khorazm occurs only once, i.e., in the list of the Si-pei-ta. Urgendj is not marked on the ancient map, but as we have seen above (53), the Yuan shi records its capture by the Mongols, spelling the name \u7389\u9f8d\u5091\u8d64 Yu-lung-gie-ch'i. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi writes it Urungechi (Palladius' transl. p. 147). Ye-li Ch'u-ts'ai states (Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 117):\u2014\u201cWest of P'u-hua (Bokhara) there is a great river, flowing to the west, which enters a sea. West of this river is the city of \u4e94\u91cc\u6839 U-li-gen, where the mother of the so-li-t'an is living. This city is still more rich and populous than Bokhara.\u201d\n\n\u8d5b\u862d Sai-lan = Sairam.\n\n162. Sairam is still the name of a city in Russian Turkestan, north-east of Tashkand. It was situated at the time of the Mongols, as it is even now, on the great highway leading from Almalik (Kuldja) to Samarcand; and thus it is spoken of by the Chinese medieval travellers, who took this route (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 36, 75); and also by Haithon. In the biography of Sie-t'a-la-hai,\u2014one of Chinghiz khan's generals,\u2014(Yuan shi, chap. cli), the capture of \u8d5b\u862d Sui-lan by the Mongols is recorded. The Mohammedan authors do not mention Sairam among the cities taken by Chinghiz khan's army; but this place is spoken of, it seems, by Rashid-eddin, in the chapter on the Turkish tribes. Compare Berezin's translation, vol. i, p. 2, where Talas and Sairam appear in the list of countries and places inhabited from ancient time by Turkish tribes. On page 13 of the same translation, the same place apparently is called Kary Sairam, and associated again with Talas. Rashid states that Kary Sairam and Talas are said to be situated in the country, where Abuldja khan was in the habit of encamping in winter time. He states further, that Kary Sairam is an ancient and very large city with forty gates. To cross it takes a whole day. In Rashid's day Kary Sairam was inhabited by Turk Mussulmans and was subject\n\n*** Turkan khatun, the mother of sultan Mohammed of Khorazm.\n\n*** I may observe, that there is in central Asia a lake and a city, which on our maps bear the same or nearly the same name. The lake Sairam, of which I have given more detailed accounts in my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. (pp. 82, 71, 114) is situated north-east of Kuldja and is termed \u8d5b\u91cc\u6728 Sai-li-mu on modern Chinese maps. The city of Sairam (thus the name is written on Russian maps) in eastern Turkestan is situated between Kucha and Aksu, and marked on modern Chinese maps as \u8d5b\u91cc\u6728 Sai-li-mu. The name appears on English maps as Sailim or Sairim.\n\n*** Abuldja khan was the ancestor of the famous Oghuz khan, the progenitor of all the Turk tribes, according to Rashid-eddin.\nto Kaidu. Ibid. p. 17 we read again, that Oghuz khan, after having got the supremacy over his relatives who had attacked him, ruled over the whole country stretching from Telash and Syrym (I think Talas and Sairam are meant) to Bokhara.\n\nIn the Ming shi, chap. cccxxxii, fol. 8, the following account is given of Sai-lan:\u2014\"It is situated in the middle of a plain, east (a mistake for north-east) of Ta-shi-kan (Tashkand), more than a thousand li distant from Samarcand. The city is two or three li in circuit (probably a mistake in the figures). The country is fertile, produces the five kinds of grain and many fruits, and is well populated. There is found in the grass, a little black spider, the sting of which is poisonous. The people cure the wound from its sting with Po-ho.\"**\n\n\u5df4\u8033\u8d64\u5229\u520a Ba-r-ch'i-li-han = Barkhalighkend.\n\n163. I have no doubt that Ba-r-ch'i-li-han of the map is the same as the city of Barkhalighkend, situated according to Rashid on the Sihon, and taken in 1219 (or 1220) by Chinghiz khan's eldest son Djuchi (see above). The Yuan shi states (see 58), that Djuchi captured the city of Ba-r-djen. This name is evidently intended for the same place. As I have proved in note 91, the name Barchin in Carpin's narrative (p. 750) refers also to this city. Haithon the traveller writes the same name Phartchin. He also mentions however a city Barkant.\n\n\u5377\u7684 Djan-di = Djend.\n\n164. Djend, according to D'Ohsson's map was situated on the Sihon (Sir-daria, or Yaxartes) towards its mouth. The Bibl. Orient. writes the name Giund.\n\nIt was near Djend that the troops of Mohammed Khorazm shah had the first opportunity of fighting with the Mongols (see above, 48), before the main body of Chinghiz khan's army had arrived in Turkistan. In 1220, Djuchi captured Djend (see 49).\n\nIV. Countries and Places in the Empire of Bu-sa-yin, = Persia.\n\n\u5df4\u67d0 Ba-mou = Bamian(?)\n\n165. This name appears only in the list of the Si-pei-ti, as a\n\n** This is the karakurt of the Kirghiz,\u2014latrodetes lugubris.\n** This name is applied in China to several species of mentha.\ncity belonging to Persia, without further notice. It is omitted from the ancient map, so that it cannot be decided what place is meant. *Ba-mou* may be intended for *Bamian*, a district and important fortress in the Hindu-kush, taken and destroyed by Chinghiz khan in 1221 (see above, 52). A place of this name still exists, and was visited by Burnes in 1832. I may however observe, that there is also a place called *Bam*, south-east of Kcrman, which name also has some resemblance to Ba-mou, and is also of ancient origin; for Bam is mentioned by Ebn Haukal (Ritter, *l. c.* vol. vii, p. 734).\n\n\u5854\u516b\u8f9b T'a-ba-sin = Thabas Sistan.\n\n166. This name also is not marked on the map, but is noticed in the Si-pei-ti; which, as has been previously stated, is the list of the proper names occurring on the original ancient map of central and western Asia. I am inclined to identify T'a-ba-sin with Thabas, a city occasionally mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period (D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 679). The *Bibl. Orient.* p. 856, states, that there are two cities of this name in Persia; one of them, *Thabas keilar*, situated near Yezd, whilst the other is a city of Sistan; wherefore it is also called *Thabas Sistan*. Both places are found on modern maps.\n\n\u4e0d\u601d\u6b66 Bu-sze-t'e = Bost.\n\n167. This name is placed on our ancient map south-west of Ghazna (see 150), and this position agrees well with *Bost*, a city in Seyistan (Sistan), on the river Hilmand. Compare *Bibl. Orient.* pp. 779, 174.\n\n*Bost* is an ancient city, which Isidore of Charax (1st century of our era) calls Bis (Ritter's *Asien*, vol. vi, p. 120). Bost is frequently mentioned in the ancient history of Persia. In the 10th century it belonged to the Ghaznevids (Deguignes, tom. ii, p. 332; tom. iii, p. 157). It is also spoken of by the Mohammedan chroniclers, in connexion with Chinghiz' invasion of western Asia (D'Ohsson, tom. i, pp. 195, 298), and is noticed in the relation of Tamerlane's wars (Deguignes, tom. v, p. 20).\n\nIn the *Ts'in cheng lu* (see above, 57) we read:\u2014\"In the spring of 1223, Chinghiz moved out with his army and proceeded northward, following the course of the Sin-tze su. The third prince reached the city of *Bu-si-sze-dan*, and asked permission of Chinghiz to attack it; but the emperor recalled his son in view of the hot season commencing.\"\n\n*** About a hundred and twenty English miles north-east of Yezd.\nIt seems that the Chinese characters Bu-si-size-dan here represent the combined names Bost and Sistan.\n\nIn the Yuan ch'ao pi shi, the invasion of Sistan by Tului, Chinghiz' third son, is also recorded (see above, 56). Rashid-eddin however states (see above, 52) that \"Ogotai after having destroyed Ghazna, asked permission to attack the city of Sistan; but Chinghiz objected owing to the excessive heat, and recalled his son.\"\n\n\u6cd5\u56e0 Fa-yin = Ca\u00efn.(1)\n\n168. This name also is met with only in the list of the Si-pei-ti. Perhaps Cain is meant, a city south-west of Herat. Ca\u00efn in times past, was the capital of the mountainous country called Kuhistan, and belonged to the Isma\u00eflians, when Hulagu began the conquest of Persia (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, pp. 158, 175). Tun was another city of Kuhistan, M. Polo (tom. i, p. 79) notices Tunoca\u00efn as a kingdom of Persia.\n\n\u5854\u91cc\u5e72 T'a-li-gan = Talecan.\n\n169. I have noticed above (147) the erroneous position assigned to Talecan on the ancient map. This place seems to have been confounded with Thus by the compiler of the map.***\n\nTalecan or Ta\u00efkan was an ancient city in the region of the sources of the Oxus or Djihun. The Arabic historians state, that in the middle of the 7th century it was taken by the Arabs, Ebn Haukal (10th century) mentions Ta\u00efkan among the cities of Tokharestan (Ritter, l. c. vol. v, p. 701). Edrisi (12th century) gives a description of Talecan (Ritter, l. c. vol. v, p. 787). Nussret-kul, the fortress of Talecan, resisted the Mongols for seven months; but was finally taken, when Chinghiz himself arrived, in 1221 (see above, 51).\n\nM. Polo visited Talecan, which in his narrative bears the same name as in Ebn Haukal's geography. Polo states (vol. i, p. 144):\u2014\n\n\"After those twelve days' journey (from Balc) you come to a fortified place called Ta\u00efcan, where there is a great corn market. It is a fine place, and the mountains that you see towards the south are all composed of salt.\"***\n\nG\u00f6es on his way from India to China, in the beginning of the 17th century, halted for a month in Talhan. The place was also visited about thirty-eight years ago by Wood.\n\n*** There were three places called Talecan; the one here mentioned, in Badakhshan; that in Khorassan; and a third in Dilem (see further on, 182).\n\n*** Compare my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 46. Ch'ang-ch'un also noticed the salt in the mountains on his way from Samarcand to the Hindu-kush.\nTalecan was known to the Chinese in the 7th century. The kingdom of \u5854\u524c\u5065 Ta-la-kien, described by Huan-tsang (Julien, l. c. tom. i, p. 35), can only be identified with Talecan. The Chinese annals mention the capture of Talecan by Chinghiz (see above, 53). The Yuan shi writes the name \u5854\u91cc\u5bd2 T'a-li-han.\n\n\u5df4\u91cc\u9ed1 Ba-li-hei = Balkh.\n\n170. According to the Bibl. Orient. p. 167, Balkh is one of the most ancient cities of Persia. Kai khosru, one of the kings of the second dynasty (Kayanides) who lived in the 6th century B.C. is said to have established his residence in Balkh. It has always been considered one of the principal cities of Khorassan.\n\nThe country of Balkh is identical with the Bactris of the Zend texts and the cuneiform inscriptions found on the ruins of Persepolis. To the ancient Greek authors, this country,\u2014and it is believed especially the city of Balkh,\u2014was known by the name of Bactria or Bactriana. The Bibl. Orient. p. 151, explains this name by bakhter, meaning \"east\" in Persian. It is known that after Alexander the Great, on his expedition to India, had passed through Bactria, this country was for many centuries under Greek culture, of which the traces can still be found there.\n\nBalkh suffered terribly from Chinghiz. Though the city surrendered without resistance, the whole population was massacred by the Mongols in 1221; and in 1223, when Chinghiz again passed through Balkh, he ordered the slaughter of the inhabitants who had meanwhile settled there (see above, 51, 52).\n\nM. Polo says (vol. i, p. 142):\u2014\"Balc is a noble city and a great, though it was much greater in former days. But the Tartars and other nations have greatly ravaged and destroyed it. There were formerly many fine palaces and buildings of marble, and the ruins of them still remain. The people of the city tell that it was here that Alexander took to wife the daughter of Darius. Here, you should be told, is the end of the empire of the Tartar Lord of the Levant. And this city is also the limit of Persia in the direction between east and north-east.\"\n\nBalkh was in the middle ages a metropolitan see of the Nestorian church (Yule's Cathay, p. 179).\n\nThis statement is in accordance with the ancient map; but as has been stated on a former page, the frontier between Persia and the middle empire has often changed (see above, 36, 150). We read further in D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 268, that in 1300, Dua, khan of the middle or Chagatai empire, invested his son Kutlug shah with the countries of Ghazna, Seyistan Badakhshan, Balkh and Meru. Thus these countries seem then to have belonged to the middle empire.\nBalkh was probably known to the Chinese at an early date; it is difficult however to venture any identification upon the vague descriptions of the countries of western Asia, as found in the histories of the Han, Wei, etc. It is generally believed that the kingdom of \u5927\u590f Ta-hia, reached by the Chinese general Chang Kien (see above, 39) in the second century B.C. answers to Bactria. Hsuan-tsang in his accounts of western countries mentions a kingdom \u7d20\u559d\u7f85 Fo-ho-lo, bounded on the north by the river Fo-ch'u (Oxus). Vivien de St. Martin identifies Fo-ho-lo with Balkh (see Julien's M\u00e9m. s.l. Contr. Occid. tom. i, p. 29; tom. ii, p. 289). He may be right.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, Balkh is repeatedly mentioned, and the name is differently written. In the Annals, sub anno 1221, the capture of \u65af\u52d2\u8a36 Ban-le-ho by Chinghiz is recorded. In Subuta's biography, the name is written \u5fc5\u91cc\u7f55 Bi-li-han (see above, 54); in Ho-sze-mai-li's biography, Yuan shi, chap. cxx, \u963f\u523a\u9ed1 A-la-hei. In the biography of Ch'a-han (Djihan), Ibid. chap. cxxxvii, the name of Balkh reads \u677f\u52d2\u8a36 Ban-le-ho. Ch'a-han was a native of Balkh.\n\nThe Taoist monk Ch'ang-ch'un, on his way from Samarcand to the Hindu-kush passed through the city of \u65af\u91cc Ban-li, by which name again Balkh is meant (see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 47). Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-t's'ai (Ibid. p. 117) designates Balkh by the single character \u65af Ban.\n\n\u4e43\u6c99\u4e0d\u8033 Nai-sha-bu-r = Nishabur.\n\n171. This name is found in the list of the Si-pei-ti, but not on the map. There can however be no doubt that Nishabur is meant, the ancient capital of Khorassan; for Nishabur is repeatedly mentioned under almost the same name in the Yuan shi, in connection with the Mongol invasion of Persia. In the Annals, sub anno 1221, the name of Nishabur is rendered by \u90a3\u5bdf\u5140\u5152 Ni-ch'a-wu-r (see above, 53); in the biography of Ba-r-chu a-r-to di-gin, by \u4f60\u6c99\u535c\u91cc Ni-sha-bu-li (see above, 100); and in the biography of Ho-sze-mai-li, Yuan shi, chap. cxx, by \u4f60\u6c99\u4e0d\u5152 Ni-sha-bu-r. Compare also (51 above) the statements of the Mohammedan authors respecting the siege and capture of Nishabur by the Mongols.\n\nNishabur is also an ancient city, and is generally believed to be identical with the Nisaya of the Zend text, and the Nisaia or\n\n*** It is an interesting fact, that in the ancient list of metropolitan sees in the middle ages, Balkh is termed Halaka (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxlvi). This name has a great resemblance to A-la-hei.\nNisaea of the ancient Greek and Roman authors (Ritter, l.c. vol. vii, p. 56). The Bibl. Orient. however states, p. 659, that the celebrated city of Nishabur was founded by king Sapor II (A.D. 310\u2014380) of the Sassanide dynasty, and that the name is derived from nei, meaning \"reed,\" and the name of its founder. The sultans of the Seljuk dynasty, in the 11th century, were accustomed to reside at Nishabur.\n\n\u6492\u524c\u54c8\u5915 Sa-la-ha-si = Serakhs.\n\n172. This place also is only found in the Si-pei-ti, and not on the map; and it seems, that Serakhs a city of Khorassan (Bibl. Orient. p. 744) is meant. I know nothing about the history of this place; but it is mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the 13th century (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 281); and the capture of a place \u666e\u523a\u601d Si-la-sze by the Mongols, is recorded in the Yuan shi (see above, 53). I think Si-la-sze, which in the Chinese text is associated with Meru and Maruchak, also denotes Serakhs.\n\n\u5df4\u74e6\u5152\u7684 Ba-wa-r-di = Bavurd.\n\n173. Ba-wa-r-di also is missing from the ancient map. In the list of the Si-pei-ti, it is placed between Serakhs (172) and Meru (174). The Bibl. Orient. states, p. 179, that Bavurd is a city of Khorassan, where in times past the Seljuks, after having crossed the Djihun, remained for a time. With the capture of Bavurd, Tamerlane began the conquest of Persia. I have not met with the name of Bavurd in D'Ohsson's \"History of the Mongols;\" but it seems that in the Yuan shi it is spoken of once more. In chap. cxxiii, biography of A-la-wa-r-sze, we read, that he was a Hui-hu (Mohammedan) from \u516b\u74e6\u8033 Ba-wa-r, a commander of a thousand in his country. When Chinghiz' armies arrived at Ba-wa-r, A-la-wa-r-sze surrendered, and subsequently entered the Mongol service.\n\nI can give no information about the exact position of Bavurd, the place not being marked, it seems, on modern maps. I may however notice, that the Turkish admiral Sidi Ali, who in the 16th century travelled from India through Persia to Constantinople, passed through Bavurd and then proceeded to Thus (Journal Asiatique, tom. ix, p. 287).\n\n\u9ebb\u91cc\u5140 Ma-li-wu = Meru or Merv.\n\n174. Ma-li-wu is marked on the ancient map south of Bokhara, and evidently denotes Meru or Merv, also a celebrated city of Khorassan, and one of the four capitals of this province (Meru,\nNishabur, Herat, Balkh;\u2014D\u2019Ohsson, tom. i, p. 245). The name is of very ancient origin; for Meru is mentioned in the Zend Avesta, as one of the places of abundance (Ritter, l. c. vol. vi, p. 52). The province Margiane of Isidore of Charax, with the city of Antiochia, is the same as Meru.\n\nThe ancient Mohammedan authors (Ebn Haukal and others) distinguish two cities of Meru; one of which is called Meru Shahjan (Meru, king of the world); the other Meru-al-rud. Both are situated on the river Meru-rud (now Murgab). Meru-al-rud, known also under the name of Maruchak, lies about one hundred and forty English miles south-east of Meru Shahjan; which is the more celebrated of the two cities, and believed to be the same as ancient Antiochia, founded by the Greeks. It is praised by all the ancient Mohammedan geographers. Ebn Haukal states, that near this city is the mill, where Yezdejerd the last king of the Sassanides was slain (Ritter, l. c. p. 232). Meru was for a time the residence of the Seldjuk sultans.\n\nThe fate of Meru at the time of the first Mongol invasion, has been recorded above (51). In the Yuan shi mention is made of both cities of Meru. Meru Shahjan is termed there \u99ac\u9b6f Ma-lu, whilst Meru-al-rud is mentioned by its other name Maruchak, rendered by the Chinese characters \u99ac\u9b6f\u5bdf\u8449\u53ef Ma-lu-ch\u2019a-ye-k'o (see above, 53).\n\n\u7684\u5e0c\u601d\u4e39 Di-hi-sze-dan = Dahistan.\n\n175. Dahistan is still the name of the country bordering on the south-eastern corner of the Caspian sea (Petermann\u2019s Geogr. Mitth. 1873, tab. 9). Hammer derives the name from the D\u0101oi, of Herodotus (book i, sec. 125), and the Daai, a people of Hyrcania according to Strabo.\n\nThe Tarikh Dijhan Kushai spells the name Dihistan, being nearly the same as on the map (D\u2019Ohsson, tom. i, p. 259). Turkan khatun, the mother of Mohammed shah, proceeded from Urgendj to Mazanderan through Dihistan. The name of Dihistan appears once more in D\u2019Ohsson\u2019s translations from the Persian historians. In tom. iv, p. 685, we read that Hassan and Talish, the sons of Choban, a revolted general of Abu Said, khan of Persia, in 1327 fled from Mazanderan through Dihistan to Khovaresm.\n\nOn the Catalan map, Deystam is marked on the south-eastern corner of the Caspian sea.\n\n\u6731\u91cc\u7ae0 Dju-li-djang = Djurdjan.\n\n176. Djurdjan or Gurkana in the middle ages, was a famous\ntown situated on the river Giurgen or Gurgan, which discharges into the south-east corner of the Caspian sea. According to *Ibn Khordad Bek* (quoted in the \"Transactions of the Russian Geographical Society,\" 1871, vol. iv, p. 103), in ancient times the trade of Russia with Balkh, Rayi (near modern Teheran) and Bagdad, passed through Djurdjan. Compare also note 85.\n\nDjurdjan is mentioned by the Mohammedan authors as early as the 7th century, in connection with the warlike enterprises of the Arabs. Massudi and Ebn Haukal speak also of Djurdjan.\n\nIt is believed that Djurdjan or Gurkana is the *Vehrkana* of the Zend Avesta, and that the *Hyrcania* of the ancient Greek and Roman writers denotes the same name (Ritter, *l. c.* vol. vi, p. 61).\n\nAfter Tamerlane had subdued Mazanderan, in 1392, he ordered the magnificent palace of *Shasman* to be built near Djurdjan (Deguignes, tom. v, p. 32).\n\nThe ruins of ancient Djurdjan still exist. Mention is made of them by Fraser, who in 1822 visited the Gurgan river and the place where Djurdjan stood, of which a remarkable tower has been preserved.\n\n\u5854\u7c73\u8a2d *T'a-mi-she* = Damegan.\n\n177. This name is placed on the map between Djurdjan and Simnan (see the following), and I have little doubt *Damegan* is intended. The character *she* is probably erroneous.\n\nDamegan, also an ancient city, was the capital of the country known under the name of *Cumuss* (*Bibl. Orient.* p. 259). The place,\u2014which still exists,\u2014is repeatedly mentioned by the Persian writers of the Mongol period (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 248; tom. iii, pp. 22, 23).\n\nHaithon the traveller calls this city *Thamghain*. Compare also note 341.\n\n\u897f\u6a21\u5a18 *Si-mu-niang* = Simnan.\n\n178. Simnan, also a city of Cumuss (*Bibl. Orient.* p. 249), is frequently mentioned by Rashid-eddin and other Mohammedan authors, speaking of the Mongol invasions of Persia (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 248; tom. iii, p. 194; tom. iv, pp. 177, 675).\n\n\u6492\u91cc\u7259 *Sa-li-ya* = Saria or Sari.\n\n179. *Sari* is still the name of a city in the Persian province of Mazanderan. In the ancient Mohammedan records, this place is generally styled *Sari*; but the biographers of Tamerlane write the\nname Saria (Deguignes, tom. v, pp. 22, 33), and thus justify the spelling Sa-li-ya on the map.\n\nSari is considered to be an ancient city. It has been identified with Sauloe, capital of the ancient Persian province of Parthyene (Ritter, l. c. vol. via, pp. 527, 118), mentioned by Isidore of Charax in the 1st century. Firdusi and Ebn Haukal speak of Sari as a large city, and call it the capital of Tabristan (Ritter, l. c. pp. 478, 529).\n\nIn the 18th century, Sari was for a long time the royal residence of the Kadjar dynasty, now reigning over Persia.\n\nIn the \"History of the T'ang dynasty,\" Suri is mentioned as a city (capital) of Tabristan in the 8th century or earlier. We read in the T'ang shu, chap. ccviiiib, at the end of the article \u6ce2\u65af Po-sze (Persia), of a country \u9640\u677f\u65af\u55ae T'o-po-sze-tan, \"bounded on three sides by mountains, and on the north by a little sea (Caspian). The ruler of this realm has his residence in \u6ce2\u91cc Sa-li. From ancient times these princes were commanders-in-chief of the Persian eastern army (\u4e16\u70ba\u6ce2\u65af\u6771\u5927\u5c07). When Persia was destroyed by the \u5927\u98df Ta-shi (Arabs), T'o-po-sze-tan refused to surrender. A prince of this country named \u5ffd\u9b6f\u6c57 Hu-lu-han, sent an envoy in 746 to the Chinese court. The Chinese emperor granted him the title of king, and Hu-lu-han's son Tze-hui-lo entered the Chinese service. The realm of T'o-po-sze-tan was finally destroyed by the black-coated Ta-shi (Arabs).\n\n\u963f\u6a21\u91cc A-mu-li = Amol.\n\n180. Amol is correctly placed on the map west of Sari. It is still the name of a city in the western part of Mazanderan.\n\nAmol has also been in times past the capital of Tabristan. Ebn Haukal mentions it as an important place of trade for silk,\n\n---\n\n*** Ritter, l. c. vol. via, p. 418, states, that in the Pehlvi or ancient language of western Persia, Tabristan (Trafestan) means \"a woody, mountainous region.\" In Vuller's Lexicon Persico-Latinum, the name Thabristan is derived from thaber, \"a kind of willow.\" It has been suggested, that the country of the Tapuri mentioned by Arrian, book iii, ch. 23, par. 3, 5, denotes Tabristan. Amru, in the middle of the 14th century, in his list of metropolitan sees of the Nestorian church, mentions Tabaristan together with Rai (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxlv).\n\n*** The Chinese text has in fact \u6ce2\u91cc Po-li; but I feel no hesitation in correcting the first character, which has evidently been confounded with the very similar-looking character \u8428 so, pronounced sa in ancient times (Williams' Dictionary).\n\n*** See my pamphlet On the Knowledge possessed by the Ancient Chinese of the Arabs, &c. p. 9.\nfrom which many routes diverge. It was a renowned trading-place in the time of Harun al Rashid. The author of the *Tarikh-i Thabrestan*, who wrote in the 13th century, states, that in his time Amol was a great emporium, where the nations of the west used to meet, being frequented by the Saccasins (see note 128), Bulgars and Russians, as well as the merchants of Hindustan.\n\nIn 1220 Amol was sacked by the Mongol troops under the command of Cheb\u00e9, sent in pursuit of Mohammed shah (see above, 50).\n\n\u80e1\u74e6\u8033 Hu-wa-r = Khavar.\n\n181. *Hu-wa-r* is marked on the map south of Sari, and is without doubt intended for the *Choar\u0113n\u0113* of Isidore of Charax,\u2014the *Choara* of Pliny near the \"Caspiae Portae;\"\u2014*Parth\u00e6 am\u0153nissimus situs* (*Plinius*, tom. vi, p. 15), or the *Khavar* of the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period. This latter name has survived in that of a defile and a plain to the south-east of the present Teheran, between fifty and sixty English miles distant from the capital. The defile of Khavar or Khar, answering to the *Port\u00e6 Caspiae* of Pliny, or the *Caspiae pyl\u00e6* of Arrian, leads through a southern spur of the Alburs chain, which projects into the plain country, separating the fertile plain of Veramin (situated towards Teheran) from that of Khavar. I can speak of this region from personal observation.\n\nThe Mohammedan authors translated by D'Ohsson, frequently mention Khavar in connection with the Mongol invasions (tom. iii, p. 193; tom. iv, pp. 177, 678, etc).\n\n\u4f4e\u5ec9 Di-lien = Dilem.\n\n182. *Dilem* is a name applied to a region situated in the Alburs mountains, south of Ghilan. The traveller, who crosses the Alburs chain, on his way from Kasvin to Resht, has to pass through Dilem, which in times past was an independent kingdom with the capital *Shaherek.*\n\nThe kings of Dilem conquered a great part of Persia in the 10th century. Their dynasty is known in history under the name of *Dilemits* or *Buyids.*\n\nWhen the Mongols first invaded Persia, Dilem was in possession of the Isma'ilians, who had there several strong castles (Alamut, see 183; Lembasser, see 184; Me\u00efmundiz, etc). When Hulagu,\n\n---\n\n*240 Ritter is wrong in identifying (i.e. vol. via, p. 418) Dilem with Tabristan; but it may be that Tabristan at one time belonged to Dilem.*\nin 1256, went to attack Alamut, he passed through Shaherek (D'Ohsson, tom. iii. p. 197).\n\nOldjaitu, khan of Persia in 1307, was obliged to undertake an expedition against the people of Dilem, who refused to acknowledge the supremacy of the khan (D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 188).\n\n\u963f\u524c\u6a21\u5fd2 A-la-mu-t'e = Alamut.\n\n183. The castle of Alamut, one of the strongest among the Isma\u00eblian mountain castles, was built in 860 by a prince of Dilem, on an inaccessible rock. In the 13th century it was the headquarters of the chief of the Isma\u00eblians or the \"Old man of the mountain,\" as the crusaders used to call him, and as he is termed also by M. Polo (vol. i, p. 132). The siege of the castle of Alamut by Hulagu's host and its surrender in 1256, are related by D'Ohsson, tom. iii, pp. 197, 198. Mohammed of Nessa states, that Kasvin is the nearest city to Alamut.\n\nColonel Monteith, who in 1832 visited the ancient country of the Assassins or Isma\u00eblians, has rediscovered mount Alamut, northeast of Kasvin. The river Shah-rud takes its rise in this region (Ritter, l. c. vol. vi, p. 592).\n\n\u862d\u5df4\u6492\u8033 Lan-ba-sa-r = Lembesser.\n\n184. Lembesser was the name of another castle of the Isma\u00eblians, also situated in Dilem. It is sometimes termed Lemeher (D'Ohsan, tom. iii, p. 191). On the siege of Lembesser by the Mongols, see Ibid. tom. iii, p. 200.\n\nThe position of Lembesser it seems has not been ascertained; we only know from ancient authors that it was in Dilem. The position of Alamut and Lembesser as given on the map, is not correct. 441\n\n---\n\nThere is yet a third castle of the Isma\u00eblians, mentioned by the Chinese authors of the Mongol period, the castle of Girdkuh, which according to the Mohammedan historians opposed a strong resistance to the Mongols. The siege began in 1253, but they could not take it till 1256. At least D'Ohsson states, that in 1256 the whole country of the Isma\u00eblians had surrendered, and they had been all exterminated. Colonel Yule however records (M. Polo, vol. i, p. 140) on the authority of Rashid, that Girdkuh surrendered only in 1270. Haithon (Historia Orientalis, chap. xxiv) states, that the Assassins had an impregnable castle, called Tigado, and that the Tartars besieged it for seven whole years, after which time the Assassins surrendered. In the Yuan shi, chap. cxix, biography of Ho-sze-mai-li, the name of Girdkuh is rendered by \u7389\u5152\u8c37 Yu-r-gu. In the biography of Kuo Khan, Ibid. chap. cxlix, where some details are given with respect to the capture of Girdkuh, the name is written \u514b\u90fd\u535c K'i-du-bu, (see my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 79), and it is stated there that this fortress was situated on\n185. *K'o-dsi-y\u00fcn* on the map denotes the well-known city of Kasvin, situated on the great highway from Teheran (Rayi in ancient times) to Tebriz, south of the Alburn chain. It is said to have been founded by the Sassanide king Sapor II, A.D. 310\u2014380. Kasvin was taken by the Mongols (Subutai and Cheb\u00e9) in 1221, and the inhabitants were massacred (see above, 58). Hulagu in 1257, when attacking the castles of the Isma\u00e9lians in Dilem, had his head-quarters in Kasvin (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 200). Ghazan khan of Persia died near Kasvin in 1304 (*l. c.* tom iv, p. 349).\n\nHaithon the traveller terms this city Khezovin.\n\nM. Polo (vol. i, p. 79) calls Casvin one of the eight kingdoms of Persia.\n\n186. On the map, Sa-wa is marked between Kasvin and Isfahan. This position suits well the city of Sava, which still exists, fifty miles south-west of Teheran. It is described by consul Abbott, who visited it in 1849 (Yule's *M. Polo*, vol. i, p. 76). This is the top of the mount Yen-han. In the narrative of Ch'ang Te (Ibid. p. 78) we read:\u2014The realm of the Mu-nai-hi (Moulahids or Isma\u00e9lians;\u2014Ibid. p. 63, note 12) \"had three hundred and sixty mountain fortresses, all which had been reduced. There was however, west of Tan-han, a mountain fortress K'i-du-bu-gu on a very steep rock, which could not be reached either by arrows or by stones (thrown by catapults). In the year 1256 the imperial army arrived at the foot of this fortress. The rock was so steep, that when one looked upwards his cap fell off.\" After this Ch'ang Te gives some details with respect to the capture of K'i-du-bu-gu, which occurred in the same year. In the Annals of the Yuan shi, sub anno 1252, the siege of Girdkuh is also reported, and the name is written there quite correctly Gi-r-du-kie. In my *Notes on Chin. Med. Trav.* I suggested (p. 64, and p. 78, note 85), on the authority of D'Ohsson (tom. iii, p. 189), that the castle of Guirdcouch was situated in Couhistan (the hill country between Nishabur, Herat and Yezd). I was misled it seems by D'Ohsson. Col. Yule writes (M. Polo, vol. i, p. 139):\u2014\"Girdkuh... has not, as far as I know, been identified by modern travellers, but it stood within 10 or 12 miles of Damghan (to the west or north-west).\" I do not know where Yule obtained his information about the position of Girdkuh; but it is in accordance with the map of northern Persia appended to Buhse's *Reise in Persien*. It seems to be the only map which marks Girdkuh (I possess only the map of this work). Mr. Buhse, a Russian botanist, who travelled in Persia about twenty years ago, places Girdkuh, which lay on his way, about fourteen English miles west-north-west of Damegan. Now I have little doubt that in the above-quoted Chinese statement, about K'i-du-bu-gu being situated west of Tan-han, the latter name denotes Damegan.\nthe city of Saba in Persia, from which according to M. Polo (l. c. p. 73) the three Magi set out, when they went to worship Jesus Christ. Sava was destroyed by the Mongols in 1224 (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 349).\n\n\u67ef\u5fb7 Ko-shang = Kashan.\n\n187. Ko-shang on the ancient map is placed between Khavar (181) and Isfahan; the city of Kashan, north of Isfahan, being intended.\n\nKashan is said to have been built by Zobeide khatun, wife of Harun al Rashid; but Ouseley in his Oriental Geography, proves, that this city existed at a much earlier date (Ritter, l. c. vol. vii, p. 35).\n\nKashan was for the first time plundered by the Mongols in 1224. D'Ohsson (tom. i, p. 349) states, that in the beginning of 1224, a Mongol detachment proceeded from Khorassan to Rayi, plundered and destroyed this city, and then attacked Sava (Sava; \u2014see 186), Kum and Kashan, which cities suffered the same fate.\n\nOdoric (Yule's Cathay, p. 50) calls Cassan, which he passed through, a royal city of great repute, the city of the three Magi.\n\n\u4ea6\u601d\u6cd5\u676d I-sze-fa-hang = Isfahan.\n\n188. Isfahan or Ispahan is perhaps the same as the Aspadan\u00eb of Ptolemy (tom. vi, ch. 4, fol. 150). All the Mohammedan geographers agree that Isfahan is a very ancient city (Bibl. Orient. p. 301). Kai kobad, the founder of the second Persian dynasty (Kayanides), is reported to have established his residence in Isfahan; but the capital of Persia was subsequently transferred in turn to Susa, Persepolis and Madain. When the Seljuk dynasty ruled over Iran, in the 11th and 12th centuries, Isfahan again became the capital. At the end of the 12th century, Iran was conquered by the sultan of Khorazm. When Chinghiz first invaded Iran, his troops did not advance so far as Isfahan; nor when Hulagu subdued the whole of Persia, did this city share the common fate of the other cities of that realm. At least D'Ohsson does not mention its name in connection with the Mongol invasion. Under the reign of Shah Abbas the Great, 1585\u20141627, the court of Persia was again established in Isfahan.\n\nIn the Annals of the Yuan shi, sub anno 1229,\u2014reign of Ogotai,\u2014it is recorded, that the \"chief\" (\u90fd\u9577) of the city of\n\n---\n\nWe have seen that M. Polo considers Sava to be the city of the three Magi.\nI-sze-ba-la-na in the Si-y\u00fc (western Asia) surrendered. The Ts'in cheng lu (Palladius' translation, p. 196) states under the same year, that the chief of the city of I-sze-ba-la-na sent an envoy with tribute to the Mongol court. I am not prepared to say, whether by I-sze-ba-la-na here, Isfahan is meant. D'Ohsson relates (tom. ii, p. 92), that the brother of the prince of Fars arrived at the court of Ogotai with valuable presents (see further on, 205). If I am not mistaken, at the time here spoken of, Isfahan belonged to Fars. I may however observe, that there was in Khorassan a city of Esferain (Bibl. Orient p. 302). This name rendered by Chinese characters would also read like I-sze-ba-la-na.\n\nIn the \"History of the Ming,\" chap. cccxxxii, fol. 20, a short account of \u827e\u601d\u5f17\u7f55 I-sze-fu-han is found, and some details are given regarding the intercourse between that city and the court of China.\n\n\u963f\u516b\u54c8\u8033 A-ba-ha-r = Abhar.\n\n189. This name is marked on the map between Zendjan (191) and Kasvin (185); and is intended, it seems, for Abhar, placed on modern maps west-south-west of Kasvin, and south-east of Zendjan. There is also a river of this name. Abhar (Bibl. Orient. p. 10), or Ebber as D'Ohsson spells the name, is frequently mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period. (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 49; tom. iv, pp. 8, 566, 706, 734).\n\nIt seems that in the days of the Mongols, the great highway from Rayi (near the present Teheran) to Tebriz passed through Abhar. The stations enumerated in Haithon's itinerary when returning from Mongolia, are,\u2014Hre\u00ef, Khezovin, Avakhr (Abhar), Zanghian, etc. As I know from personal observation, Abhar lies a little south of the present post-road between Kasvin and Zendjan (resp. Teheran, Tebriz), which passes directly from Kasvin to Sain kala.\n\n\u5b6b\u4e39\u5c3c\u7259 Sun-dan-ni-ya = Sultaniah.\n\n190. Sultaniah was the name given to the city founded in 1305 in Media (between Kasvin and Zendjan), by Ol'djaitu, the grandson of Hulagu. For further details, see D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 485. Oldjaitu established his residence here, and his successor Abu Said, resided also in Sultaniah. Thus at the time our map was compiled, Sultaniah was the royal residence of Persia. Abu Said, who died in 1335, was buried in his mausoleum at Sultaniah (D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 720).\n\nOdoric, who saw Sultaniah about 1320, says (Yule's Cathay,\np. 49):\u2014\u201cDeparting from the city of Tauris (Tebriz), I travelled for ten days and reached a certain city called Soldania, in which dwelleth the emperor of the Persians in the summer season.\u201d\n\nOn the Catalan map, the same city is termed Sodania. It was the seat of an archbishop about A.D. 1330 (Yule\u2019s Cathay, p. 238).\n\nSultanah was destroyed by Tamerlane, at the end of the 14th century. The ruins of the city may still be seen south-east of Zendjan, on the great caravan and post road from Teheran to Tebriz. The magnificent ancient mosque there was described by Chardin more than two hundred years ago, and is still admired by travellers who pass that way.\n\nThe position assigned to Sultanah on the ancient map, in relation to Kasvin and Abhar, is not correct.\n\nDsan-djang = Zendjan.\n\n191. I know nothing respecting the ancient history of Zendjan, a city which also lies on the great trade route from Teheran to Tebriz. It is often mentioned by D\u2019Ohsson. Subutai sacked the city in 1221 (see above, 58). It was near Zendjan, that sultan Abu Said in 1319 defeated the troops of a revolted general (D\u2019Ohsson, tom. iv, pp. 635, 640).\n\nDu-r-ben = Derbend.\n\n192. Derbend is a very common name in Persian geography. The word means, according to the Bibl. Orient. p. 267, \u201cpassage \u00e9troit et ferm\u00e9.\u201d By Du-r-ben on the ancient map,\u2014a place located in the north-western part of Persia,\u2014only Derbend on the western shore of the Caspian can be meant, a very important place in the middle ages, and long before that period.\n\nMasudi, who wrote in the middle of the 10th century, has left a description of the Caucasus (Djebal ul Ka\u00eftak) and the adjacent countries. His treatise has been translated by Klapproth, and published in the Magazin Asiatique, tom. i, pp. 258 sqq. We learn from it, that the Persian king Khosru Anushirvan,\u2014A.D. 531\u2014579,\u2014in order to protect Persia against the invasions of the nations north of the Caucasus,\u2014Khazars, Alans and Turks,\u2014constructed a wall, which ran along the ridges of the mountains for forty parasangs, and was prolonged into the sea for a mile. At certain distances iron gates were placed in the wall, and troops posted there to defend the passages. One of these gates (the principal one) was called Bab-ul-avab (the gate of the gates) and a city was built there which bears the same name.\nBab-ul-avab is the Arabic name for Derbend. The Turks call it Demir kapi or \"Iron-gate.\"\n\nThere is also another oriental tradition, reported by M. Polo (vol. i, p. 50), according to which the wall in question was built by Alexander the Great, and therefore it was also known under the name of Sedd Eskanderi (Bibl. Orient. p. 267). It is possible that the Sassanian king only renewed the original wall, which may have been of more ancient date. Moses of Chorene,\u2014who wrote a little after, A.D. 440,\u2014on page 356 of his Geographia Armenia speaks of the Murus Darbandus.\n\nAbout the end of the 7th century, Derbend was taken by the Arabs. The place sustained an important r\u00f4le during the middle ages, and is often spoken of by the Mohammedan writers who relate the wars of the Persian khans with the khans of Kipchak.\n\nAs is known, a splendid artificial road, crossing the middle of the Caucasus chain near the Kazbek, now connects Russia with the Transcaucasian provinces; but it seems that in ancient times, the only practicable road leading from Persia to the regions north of the Caucasus, passed by Derbend.\n\nWe have seen (see above, 58) that in 1222 Subutai, who first carried the Mongol arms to the countries north of the Caucasus, passed through Derbend. He was not able to take the citadel, where Rashid Shirvan shah had shut himself up.\n\nIn 1262 Barkai, khan of Kipchak, sent a host of thirty thousand men under the command of Nogai against Hulagu. Nogai passed through Derbend into the province of Shirvan. He was at first successful, but was afterwards forced to retire, and Hulagu passed through Derbend in pursuit of him. Some time after, Hulagu's son Abaka was defeated by Barkai, and pursued as far as Derbend (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 379).\n\nIn 1266, there was another battle fought between Barkai and Abaka near Derbend, in which the former was vanquished (D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 180).\n\nIn 1318, Uzbeg, khan of Kipchak, invaded the dominions of Abu Said and attacked Derbend (Ibid. 613).\n\nIn 1325, Choban, one of the Abu Said's generals, passed through Derbend and advanced as far as the Terek (Ibid. 666). Under the date 1334, another invasion of Uzbeg through Derbend is recorded (Ibid. 716).\n\nThe first European traveller who mentions Derbend, is the Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela in 1170 (see the English translation of his itinerary). He terms Derbend the Iron-gate of Alexander.\n\n*** Edrisi however, in the 12th century, enumerates twelve defiles by which the Caucasus could be crossed (Klaproth, Magaz. Asiat. tom. i, p. 260).\n\n*** This war is also recorded by M. Polo (vol. ii, p. 424).\nRubruquis writes (p. 252):\u2014\"Post hos (Lesgos) est porta ferrea, quam fecit Alexander ad excludendos barbaros gentes de Perside, de cujus situ dicam vobis postea, quia transivi per eam in reditu.\" On p. 381, Rubruquis relates his passing through the Iron-gate on his way back. On p. 263, he also mentions the Iron-gate or Derbend in the following terms:\n\n\"Est aliis qui dicitur Jerra (Berca), frater Baatu qui pascit versus Portam Ferream, ubi est iter Sarracenorum omnium venientium de Perside et de Turkia.\"\n\nHaithon the traveller calls Derbend by its Persian name; M. Polo terms it Iron Gate. In Turkish Derbend is still called Demir kapi (Iron gate). The ancient Russian annals of the 13th century also speak of the Jeleznja vorota (Iron gate), by which the high mountains of the Yasy (Asi or Alans) and Cherkees might be avoided. (Karamzin, vol. iv, p. 355).\n\nIn the days of Tamerlane, Derbend still retained its strategical importance. In 1387, Tamerlane when encamped on the Araxes, sent his troops against the Kipchaks who had passed Derbend.\n\nDerbend, which since the year 1806 has belonged to Russia, is now one of the finest cities in the region of the Caucasus, situated very picturesquely on the Caspian sea, on the slope of the eastern termination of the Caucasian mountains. A good view of Derbend is given in Yule's M. Polo, vol. i, p. 53; and a detailed description of the city is found in the great Russian encyclopedical dictionary. As Col. Yule complains (l. c. vol. i, p. 51) that he was not able to find any modern information of a precise kind regarding the ancient wall of Derbend, I may translate a few details from the above-quoted encyclopaedia:\n\n\"The city of Derbend is located on the slope of the mountains, which descend toward the sea-shore. It is bounded on three sides by walls, of which the northern and southern are about three versts in length. These walls project into the sea; and to the southwest they ascend a steep rock more than a thousand feet high, and join the citadel called Naryn kal\u00e9. Near Derbend; at the village of Djelgan begins the famous Daghbar (mountain wall) provided with towers and bastions at distances of from a thousand to fourteen hundred feet. The ancient wall stretches towards the mountains of Derbend. About the commencement it is in a demolished state, but among the mountains it is well preserved. The outer stones of it are well hewn, three feet and a half square and nearly a foot thick. The middle of the wall consists of smaller stones, which though not hewn are closely fitted in. At some\n\nThis citadel is the same as that which the Mongols were unable to take (see above).\nplaces the wall measures more than twenty feet in height, the thickness being not less than seven feet. Trees of remarkable size have grown upon the wall, and frequently these have caused it to fall to pieces. This wall has been followed for ten versts from its commencement. It then ascends the high mountains of Tabas-seran, and its existence there has not been ascertained; but thirty-six versts from Derbend, at the village of Lidjili, a well-preserved ancient gate can be seen. Remains of the ancient wall have been also discovered not far from the river Alazan, on the frontier of Kakhetia. At some places the ancient forts of the wall have been preserved, e.g. the fort called Kedjeli kal\u00e9, which is twenty-eight feet high, thirty-six feet long, and twenty-four feet broad.\"\n\n\u5df4\u8033\u6253\u963f Ba-r-da-a=Bardaa.\n\n193. Bardaa was in ancient times a celebrated city in Armenia. There is a tradition, that it was founded by Alexander the Great (Bibl. Orient. p. 173). According to other Mohammedan sources, Kobad, king of Persia,\u2014A.D. 491\u2014531,\u2014was its founder (Bullet. de l'Acad. de St. Petersbourg, vol. viii). Bardaa is mentioned in connection with the war between the calif Harun al Rashid and the king of the Khazars. According to Ebn Haukal, it was a large city of Aran, situated in a fertile and pleasant country.\n\nBardaa is a city of special interest in Russian history; for the ancient Mohammedan authors record, that in the 10th century it was attacked by Russians. The celebrated Massudi in his \"Golden Meadows\" states, that the Russians undertook an expedition against Bardaa in the 10th century (Nouv. Journ. Asiat. tom. ii, p. 450; Klapproth, Magaz. Asiat. tom. i, p. 276). Abulfeda records, that the Russians crossed the Caspian sea, entered the river Kur and carried fire and slaughter over Bardaa (Annales Musulmici, tom. ii, p. 426). This warlike enterprise of the Russians has been the subject of a bulky dissertation by a Russian orientalist (Erdmann, De Expeditione Russorum Berdaam versus, Casani, 1828). It seems D'Ohsson mentions Bardaa only once, tom. iii, p. 178. A vizier of sultan Djelal-eddin sojourned there in 1228.\n\nBardaa was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian church in the 14th century (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxlv). This place is often mentioned in the history of Tamerlane. The conqueror encamped ten days in the plain of Bardaa, which at that time was the capital of the Karabagh (Petis de Lacroix, Hist. de Timour, tom. iii, p. 239).\n\n---\n\nThe author of this article wrote in 1839. I have no doubt, that now the Caucasian wall has been explored throughout its whole extent.\n\nAran was the name of a little realm in Armenia.\nMassudi states that the river Kuru (Kur) passes at a distance of three miles from Bardaa (Klaproth, Mag. Asiat. tom. i, p. 300). The ruins of ancient Bardaa can still be seen on the right bank of the Tertar (an affluent of the Kur), near the village of Bardeh, which is situated on the left bank of the river, 40\u00b0 20' N. lat.\n\n\u8a2d\u91cc\u6c6a She-li-wang = Shirvan.\n\n194. By She-li-wang, the compiler of the ancient map apparently means Shirvan, a small realm in the eastern part of Transcaucasia; but he is mistaken respecting its position, locating the name too far south.\n\nShirvan is, it seems, first mentioned by Massudi, who states (Mag. Asiat. tom. i, p. 261), that after Anushirvan had founded Derbend (in the 6th century), he established several kingdoms in the region of the Caucasus. The ruler of the province of Shirvan bore the name Shirvan shah. Filan shah reigned in Shirvan, when the calif Vathek (A.D. 842\u2014847) reached the country and subdued it (Bibl. Orient. p. 772).\n\nShirvan was ravaged by the Mongols, and its capital Shamakha burnt in 1221 or 1222. Rashid Shirvan shah had fled and shut himself up in the citadel of Derbend.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, chap. cxx, biography of Ho-sze-mai-li, \u5931\u5152\u7063\u6c99 Shi-r-wan sha is mentioned in connection with Sutuata's and Che-be's expedition to the region of the Caucasus (see above, 61).\n\nShirvan is still the name of a province in Transcaucasia, having for its capital Shamakha.\n\n\u6492\u91cc\u8292 So-li-mang = Takht i Soleiman.\n\n195. The Si-pei-ti writes the name Sa-li-mang, whilst the map has Sa-li-shi (\u5931). I have adopted the former reading, for it seems to me that the name Soleiman is intended.\n\nOn modern maps we find a city Soleimania, midway between Tebriz and Bagdad; but this place is out of the question, being founded in 1788 (Ritter, l. c. vol. vii, p. 566).\n\nI am inclined to identify So-li-mang with Takht i Soleiman. The ruins of this name are considered by Sir Henry Rawlinson to be identical with the ancient capital of Azerbaidjan (Ritter, l. c. vol. vii, pp. 1040 sqq.). They are situated west of Zendjan (So-li-mang,\u2014or Sa-li-shi of the map is placed north of Zendjan), in the mountains, where the river Chagatu, a southern affluent of the Urumia lake, partly takes it rise.\n\nRashid reports that Hulagu died in 1265, on the river Chogotu,\nwhere he was accustomed to stay in winter. Ritter states (l. c. p. 1041), it seems on the authority of Rawlinson, that Abaka khan, the son of Hulagu had a palace at Takht i Soleiman, the ruins of which can still be seen.\n\n\u6bdb\u5915\u91cc Mao-si-li = Mosul.\n\n196. Mosul, the celebrated city of Mesopotamia, situated on the Tigris, near the place where ancient Nineveh stood, is first mentioned by Mohammedan writers in connection with the first conquest of the Arabs (Ritter, l. c. vol. viib, p. 176).\n\nWhen Hulagu invaded western Asia, Mosul was a small principality, governed by Bedr-eddin Lulu, who went in person to Meraga in 1258, to offer his submission to the Mongol prince (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 258). Thus Mosul at first escaped destruction by the Mongols, but after Bedr-eddin's death the inhabitants revolted. The Mongols besieged the city for nine months, and after its capture, in 1262, utterly destroyed it (l. c. tom. iii, p. 372).\n\nMosul was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian church in the middle ages (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxliv).\n\nM. Polo devotes a chapter of his book to the kingdom of Mausul (vol. i, p. 57). He states among other things:\u2014\"All the cloths of gold and silk that are called Mosolins are made in this country.\" It seems from this statement of M. Polo, that mosolin or muslin had a very different meaning from what it has now. I may observe however, that in the narrative of Ch'ang-ch'un's travels to the west in 1221 (see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 45), it is stated that in Samarcand the men of the lower classes (on the same page lower down it is said only the priests) wrap their heads about with a piece of white \u65af mo-sze. There can be no doubt that mo-sze here denotes \"muslin,\" and the Chinese author seems to understand by mo-sze the same material which we now call \"muslin.\"\n\nMarignolli, speaks of Monsol (probably a clerical error for Mousul) on the Tygris, a city built out of the ruins of Nymoe (Yule's Cathay, p. 351).\n\n\u5140\u4e5e\u516b\u524c U-k'i-ba-la = Okbara.\n\n197. U-k'i-ba-la, placed on the map south-east of Mosul, is without doubt the city of Okbara mentioned by Edrisi and Abulfeda, situated at a distance of fifteen hours' journey from Bagdad up the Tigris, on its eastern bank (Ritter, l. c. vol. viia, pp. 208, 237).\nBenjamin of Tudela (12th century) reached Bagdad from Okbara in two days (Ritter, l. c. p. 256).\nIt seems that Okbara has disappeared from the maps.\n\n\u516b\u5409\u6253 Ba-gi-da = Bagdad.\n\n198. This name has been omitted from the map, but is found in the list of the Si-pei-ti.\n\nAs is well known, Bagdad was founded by Almansur, the second of the Abbaside califs, A.D. 762, who before that time resided in Anbar. Originally a city was built on the western bank of the Tigris; but some years later it was found more convenient to lay out one on the opposite bank; and this then became the celebrated city of Bagdad, where the calif established his residence. The western city was afterwards considered only a suburb, and called Karshi (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 248).\n\nBagdad was taken by Hulagu in 1258, and some details respecting its capture will be found in my Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 66. Subsequently the Mongol khans of Persia were accustomed to pass the winter in Bagdad (Ghazan and Oldjaitu;\u2014see D'Ohsson, tom. iv, p. 172; tom. ii, p. 535).\n\nCarpini (p. 710) terms Bagdad, Baldas or Baldach. The latter spelling is also met with in Haithon's Historia Orientalis, and on the Catalan map. Bagdad in the middle ages was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian church (Yule's Cathay, p. ccxliv).\n\nM. Polo devotes several chapters of his book to the great city of Baudas (as he writes the name of Bagdad), the last calif, and the end of its supremacy (vol. i, pp. 60 sqq.).\n\nThe Chinese medi\u00e6val traveller Ch'ang Te applies nearly the same name to Bagdad as M. Polo, in styling it Bao-da. He also gives many details about the calif and the capture of the city by the Mongols (see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 82 sqq.).\n\nCh'ang Te states, in accordance with the Mohammedan authors, that ancient Bagdad consisted of a western and an eastern city, a large river running between them. The western city had no wall, whilst the eastern one was well fortified.\n\nIn the Yuan ch'ao pi shi the name of Bagdad appears several times. It is spelt there Bakhtat, and the calif is termed Khalibo (Palladius' translation, p. 148). In the unabbreviated text of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi (see above, 11), a list is given of articles, animals, etc. sent from western Asia to Ogotai khan. They are there stated to be the productions of Bagdad. I may give the names of these articles, and venture an identification of\n\nAlso situated on the Tigris, south-east of Bagdad.\nsome of them. The Chinese translation of the Yuan ch'ao pi shi (made as I have intimated in the 14th century) furnishes some explanations of these names, which for the greater part may be Persian or Arabic words. I add a translation of the Chinese explanations in parentheses.\n\nShiramala(?)\nNakhut (a kind of gold brocade).\nNachidut (a silk stuff interwoven with gold).\nDardus (a stuff embroidered in gold).\nSubut (pearls).\nTanas (great pearls).\nTobichaut (horses from Bageda with long legs and long necks).\nGurin eleut (camels).\nDuo-u-si(?)\nKichidut (camels).\nKhachidut (mules).\n\nWith respect to nakhut and nachidut I may observe, that these words represent the Mongol plural form of nakh and nachid; and the latter apparently represent the stuffs nacchi and nachetti, spoken of by Pegoletti in his notices of the trade at Constantinople (Yule's Cathay, p. 306). The stuff nakh is named several times by Ibn Batuta, and explained by him as cloths of silk and gold. Rubruquis tells us (p. 317), that Mangu khan made him a present of nasic. M. Polo (vol. i, p. 60) speaks of \"gold brocades, such as nasich and nac,\" woven in Baudas. I may finally mention, that in the Yuan shi, chap. lxxviii (on official dresses) a stuff \u9285\u77f3\u5931 na-shi-shi is repeatedly named, and the term is explained there as \u91d1\u9326 or \"gold brocade.\" In the same chapter we also meet with the term \u9060\u4e0d\u90fd su-bu-du (evidently the same as subut in the above list). It is explained as \u73cd\u73e0 \"pearls.\" Subut even now is the Mongol name for pearls. There is also the term \u5854\u7d0d t'a-na, explained as \u6771\u73e0 tung-chu. At the present day, tung-chu is the name applied in Peking to the finest and largest kind of pearls; but in modern Mongol ta-na means mother-of-pearl (see Schmidt's \"Mongol Russian German Dictionary\").\n\nAs to the horses from Bagdad called tobichaut, they are also spoken of by the Chinese traveller Ch'ang Te, who applies to them the same name (see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 84).\n\n199. K'u-fa also is not marked on the map, but the name appears in the list of the Si-pei-ti.\n\nThe city of Kufah was founded near the ancient city of Hira, in 638, during the reign of the calif Omar. The calif Abul Abbas\n(A.D. 750\u2014754) established his residence there, but afterwards transferred it to Anbar. In the first period of Islam, Kufah was a very celebrated city and a centre of Mohammedan learning. It is known that the appellation of the most ancient Arabic characters employed in writing is derived from the city of Kufah. Benjamin of Tudela visited Kufah in the 12th century (Ritter, l.c. vol. viia, p. 266).\n\nThe Mohammedan historians mention the capture of Kufah by the Mongols in 1258 (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 255). Ibn Batuta in 1325, found it in a ruined state, but calls it the mother of cities in Irac (Ritter, l.c. p. 281).\n\nThe ruins of Kufah are marked on modern maps 32\u00b0 N. lat. west of the Euphrates.\n\n200. This name also, occurs only in the list of the Si-pei-ti. As it is associated there with K'u-fa, there can be no doubt, that the city of Wassit is meant, founded also by the califs before Bagdad existed. The year A.D. 702 is given as the date of its foundation. It was situated midway between Kufah and Bassra, and also between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris; wherefore it received the name Wassit, meaning \"the middle\" in Arabic (Bibl. Orient. p. 901).\n\nWassit was sacked by Hulagu's troops in 1258, and its population slaughtered (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 255). Ghazan khan (A.D. 1295\u20141304) was accustomed to hunt near Wassit (l.c. tom. iv, pp. 200, 315).\n\nOn modern maps a city Wasset e Hie is marked, between the Euphrates and Tigris, a little south of 32\u00b0. Ritter (l.c. vol. via, p. 191) thinks, that the identity of this place with the Wassit founded in 702, has not been established.\n\n201. Kirmanshah, a city situated on the great route leading from Teheran to Bagdad, between Hamadan and the latter place, is of ancient origin. It was founded by the Sassanide king Bahram (Vararanes IV, 388\u2014399), who, on account of his having been governor of Kirman in the life-time of his father Sapor II, had the surname Kirman shah. The newly-built city then became the residence of Bahram; and Khosru Nushivan (539\u2014572) and Khosru Parvez (590\u2014628) also held their courts at Kirmanshah.\n\n---\n\n240 Founded A.D. 636.\nIt is worthy of notice, that whilst the name of this place is generally written Kirmanshah by the Mohammedan geographers, Ebn Haukal styles it Kirman Shahan, which evidently is the name rendered by the Chinese sounds K'i-li-mang-sha-hang. Rashid-eddin also writes Kermanshahan (D'Ohsson, tom iv, p. 313).\n\n\u90a3\u54c8\u5b8c\u7684 Na-ha-wan-di = Nahavand.\n\n202. Nahavand is placed on modern maps south of Hamadan and south-east of Kirmanshah. According to the Mohammedan authors, it is a very ancient city. Some geographers (as Kazwini) assert, that it was founded by Noah, and that the name reads properly Nuhawend (Ritter, vol. vii, p. 95).\n\nThis place is of historic celebrity; for it was at Nahavand, that the famous battle was fought, A.D. 641, in which Yezdejerd III, the last king of the Sassanides was defeated by the Arabs.\n\n\u7f85\u8033 Lo-r = Lor or Luristan.\n\n203. Lor, Lur or Luristan, is still the name of the mountainous country situated between Kuzistan and Irac Adjem. When the Mongols invaded western Asia, Lur was divided into two principalities, Little Lur (to the west) and Great (or eastern) Lur (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 261; tom. iv, p. 171). This distinction still exists.\n\nM. Polo (vol. i, p. 79) terms one of the kingdoms of Persia\u2014Lor.\n\n\u8a2d\u523a\u5b50 She-la-tze = Shulist\u00e1n.\n\n204. The position assigned to She-la-tze on the ancient map, between Shiraz (205) and Kazerun (206), seems to point to Shulist\u00e1n. The latter name is applied to the country of the Shuls, a people who long occupied a part of Luristan, but were expelled by the Lurs in the 12th century, and then settled in the country between Shiraz and Kuzistan.\n\nM. Polo names [Suolstan],\u2014Cielstan (Shelst\u00e1n), as a kingdom of Persia (vol. i, p. 79). Ibn Batuta going from Shiraz to Kazerun, encamped the first day in the country of the Shuls.\n\n\u6cc4\u523a\u5931 Sie-la-shi = Shiraz.\n\n205. The history of Shiraz, the capital of Fars or Persia proper, does not begin earlier, it seems, than Islam. Ebn Haukal calls Shiraz a new city (Ritter, l. c. vol. via, p. 854).\n\nAt the time of the rise of the Mongol power, the dynasty of the Salghar atabegs,\u2014who were descended from Salghar, a governor\nof Fars,\u2014reigned in that country. Salghar's grandson Sankor had profited by the weakness of the Seldjuks, and in 1148 made himself independent. His successors reigned under the title of atabegs in Fars, and had their capital in Shiraz. When the Mongols for the first time ravaged western Asia, they did not reach Shiraz; and atabeg Abubekr, A.D. 1231\u20141260, who was anxious to be on good terms with the Great khan, sent his brother with rich presents to the court of Ogotai, and received the title of Kutlug khan (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 92). When Hulagu passed the Djihun in 1256, Abubekr sent his nephew to compliment the Mongol prince. Thus Shiraz was spared by the Mongols until 1262, when the troops of the latter were sent to this city to punish Seldjuk shah, who was guilty of several acts of violence. After a stout resistance, the latter was made prisoner in Kazerun (see 206) and executed. From that time a Salgharian princess, married to a son of Hulagu, had the mere title of atabeg; but the province of Fars was under Mongol administration (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, pp. 400 sqq.).\n\nM. Polo speaks of the kingdom of Serazy in Persia (vol. i, p. 79).\n\nIn the biography of Kuo Khan, found in the Yuan shi, chap. cxlix, and in the narrative of Ch'ang Te's travels (see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. pp. 88, 89), Shiraz is termed \u77f3\u7f85\u5b50 Shilo-tze, and the title atabeg of the princes of Fars, is rendered there by \u963f\u5854\u5152 a-t'a-bei.\n\nIn the Ming shi, Chap. cccxxxii, fol. 19, there is an article on \u5931\u523a\u601d Shi-la-sze or Shiraz, from which it appears, that in the 15th century, envoys were repeatedly sent from Shiraz to the court of China.\n\n\u53ef\u54b1\u9686 Ko-dsa-lung = Kazerun.\n\n206. Kazerun, still the name of a city of Fars, is said to have been founded by king Kobad in the 6th century. In D'Ohsson's Hist. d Mongols, this place is twice mentioned, viz. tom. iii, p. 401, in connection with the capture of Seldjuk shah (see 205); and in tom. iv, p. 270, it is reported that Kutlug khodja, a Mongol prince of the Chagatai branch, ravaged Fars in 1300, and proceeded through Shiraz and Kazerun to Kuzistan and Guermsir.\n\n\u602f\u5931 K'ie-shi = Kish.\n\n207. Kish or Kais is an island in the Persian gulf, on which was \"for a long time one of the chief ports of trade with India and the East\" (Yule's Polo, vol. i, p. 61). This place, believed\nto be identical with the *Cataea* of Arrian, is the *Kisi* of M. Polo, situated where the merchants coming from Baudas enter the Indian sea. Opposite this island of Kish, was, according to Ritter (*l. c.* vol. vii, p. 752) the ancient sea-port of *Siraf*, flourishing in the 9th century;\u2014compare Reinaud's *Relation des voyages faits par les Arabes et les Persans dans l'Inde et \u00e0 la Chine dans le ix\u1d49 si\u00e8cle*, tom. i, pp. 13, 14. Ebn Haukal mentions Siraf in the 10th century; and Edrisi, two centuries later, speaks of Siraf still as an important place. Hamdallah Kazwini, who wrote in the 14th century, attributes the decline of Siraf, to the rise of *Kish* as a trading place in the 11th century (Ritter, *l. c.* pp. 774, 775).\n\n**\u516b\u5408\u523a\u56e0 Ba-ha-la-yin = Bahara\u00efn.**\n\n208. *Bahara\u00efn* was,\u2014according to the *Bibl. Orient.* p. 158,\u2014in ancient times the name of a province of Arabia, stretching along the western shore of the Persian gulf, and famed for the pearl fishing on its coast. On modern maps, this name is applied especially to an island in the Persian gulf near the coast of Arabia. Bahara\u00efn is well known also in our day, for the pearl-oyster beds in its neighbourhood. Some Chinese medi\u00e6val accounts of pearl-fishing in the Persian gulf, will be found in my *Notes on Chin. Med. Trav.* pp. 88, 89.\n\n**\u5ffd\u91cc\u6a21\u5b50 Hu-li-mu-tze = Hormuz.**\n\n209. The name *Hu-li-mu-tze* is not found on the map. It occurs only in the list of the Si-pei-ti. Probably Hormuz, the celebrated emporium at the entrance of the Persian gulf is meant.\n\nThe name of Hormuz seems to be of very ancient origin, for Arrian tells us, that Nearchus, the admiral of Alexander the Great, when returning from India beached his fleet on the shore of *Har-mozia* (*Indian History*, chap. xxxiii). A place *Armusa* appears in Ptolemy; but it was only in the 10th or 11th century, that Hormuz acquired its importance as a sea-port of Indian trade. It had been preceded by *Kish* as the principal port of the Persian gulf; and as we have seen, before Kish, in the 9th century *Siraf* occupied the most prominent place among the Persian sea-ports.\n\nThe port of Hormuz, which before the Mongol era belonged to the atabegs of Fars, originally stood upon the main-land. M. Polo, who repeatedly visited this place, terming it generally *Hormos* (once also *Curmowa*), states expressly, that it is situated on the shore of the sea (vol. i, pp. 79, 101). It is known, that when the great traveller, in 1293, returned from China by the sea route,\nentrusted with the important mission of accompanying a Mongol princess from China to the court of the Persian khan, he landed at Hormuz.\n\nThe Ormes visited by Odoric in about 1320 (Yule's Cathay, p. 56), was on an island some five miles distant from the main-land. A few years later Ibn Batuta saw Hormuz, or New Hormuz as he calls the city on the celebrated island (Ibid. p. 400).\n\nAbulfeda reports that ancient Hormuz on the main-land had been devastated by the incursions of the Tartars, wherefore its inhabitants had transferred their abode to an island in the sea, near the continent lying west of the old city.\n\nWhen the Portuguese made their first appearance in the Persian gulf, in the beginning of the 16th century, Hormuz was a rich entrep\u00f4t of Indian trade. It was taken in 1509 by Albuquerque, and in the 16th century, flourished as one of the richest ports of the east. But in 1623 the Portuguese were expelled from the island by the united English and Persian forces. Shah Abbas destroyed the city of Hormuz and built another sea-port on the opposite shore (north), which was named Bender Abbasi. In our day Bender Bushir is the principal Persian port of the gulf.\n\nWe learn from M. Polo, that in the time of Kubilai khan Chinese vessels visited Hormuz. The Yuan shi mentions several sea-ports of India as carrying on trade with China; but Hormuz is not spoken of there. I may however quote from the \"Yuan History,\" a curious statement which perhaps refers to this port. In chap. cxxiii, biography of Arszelan, it is recorded, that his grandson Hurdutai, by order of Kubilai khan, accompanied \u4e0d\u7f85\u90a3\u984f Bu-lo no-yen on his mission to the country of \u54c8\u5152\u99ac\u67d0 Ha-r-ma-mou. I am inclined to suppose that the character \u67d0 is a misprint for \u65af sze, and that the name should be read Ha-r-ma-sze or \"Hormuz.\" I do not think that by the no-yen Bu-lo, M. Polo could be meant, for the title noyen would hardly have been applied to him; but as I have already noticed, Rashid-eddin mentions a distinguished Mongol, by name Pulad, with whom he was acquainted in Persia, and who furnished him much information regarding the history of the Mongols.\n\nIn the Ming shi, chap. cccxxvi, fol. 13 sqq. some details are given regarding Hormuz. It is there stated that \u5ffd\u9b6f\u8b28\u65af Hu-lu-mu-sze is a great kingdom, situated on the western sea northwest of \u53e4\u91cc Ku-li (probably Kalikut); from which place it can be reached in twenty-five days. In the year 1412, the emperor\n\n---\n\n**Note:** I omit in my translation, some passages of the Chinese account of \"z, being absurd statements, or of little interest.\nYung-le sent \u912d\u548c Cheng Ho to the countries of the western sea. Gifts were bestowed upon the ruler of Hu-lu-mu-sze, his wives and ministers, and subsequently he sent an envoy named \u5df2\u90ce\u4e01 I-dsi-ding, to the Chinese court. He brought a letter written on gold paper, and presented horses and products of his country as tribute. After this the embassies from Hu-lu-mu-sze were four times repeated, and Cheng Ho was sent thither for a second time in 1430. The kingdom was then ruled by \u8cfd\u5f17\u4e01 Sai-fu-ding. Three years later, an embassy sent by this prince, reached Peking and presented tribute, which was courteously received by the emperor.\n\n\"The country of Hu-lu-mu-sze is situated on the utmost border of the western sea. The trading vessels of the southern barbarians come thither, and the nations of the great western sea, as well as the merchants of the Si-y\u00fc (western Asia) meet there for commercial purposes; wherefore the country is very rich. Snow is unknown there, but hoar-frost occurs; it seldom rains, and the soil is sterile; so that corn has to be brought from abroad. The people are wealthy. The women, when they go out of doors, veil their faces. Every necessary is to be had in the markets; but wine is forbidden, and whoever violates the interdict is severely punished, and sometimes even put to death. The ruler of Hu-lu-mu-sze, the officers and the people, profess the Mohammedan religion (\u56de\u6559). They wash and pray five times a day. The soil there is covered with \u9e7f kien; wherefore grass and trees do not thrive. Cattle and horses are fed on dried fish. As regards fruits, there are walnuts, \u7d05\u679c ba-dan, pine seeds, pomegranates, grapes and dates.\n\n\"There is a great hill (mountain) in that country, which is differently coloured on each of its four sides. One side consists of red rock-salt, of which the people make vessels; and when they put flesh in these, it is not necessary to add salt for its preservation. Another side is of white clay, used for whitewashing walls.\n\n---\n\n**Kien** in Peking is a kind of impure carbonate of soda, used for soap. But in this case probably salt is to be understood.\n\nM. Polo reports the same of Esher on the south coast of Arabia; and Col. Yule (l. c. vol. ii, p. 879) states that \"this custom holds more or less on all the Arabian coast from Shehr to the Persian Gulf, and on the coast east of the Gulf also.\" Compare Strabo's account of the Ichthyophagi on the coast of Mekram (b. xv, par. 11).\n\nBadam is the Persian name for \"almonds.\"\n\n\u842c\u5e74\u679c Wan-nien tsao, \"ten thousand year's jujubes,\"\u2014called also \u6ce2\u65af\u679c Posse tsao, or \"Persian jujubes.\" These names and others were applied in the time of the T'ang dynasty to the dates brought from Persia. See on this subject my pamphlet, On the Study and Value of Chinese Botanical Works.\nthird and fourth sides of the hill are of reddish carnation (\u8d64) and yellow clay, which is also brought into use.\n\n\"The country produces lions, \u9e92\u9e9f k'i-lin,\" and \u798f\u7984\u7f8a fu-lu ling yang.\" Great pearls and various precious stones are also found there.\"\n\nV. COUNTRIES AND PLACES MARKED ON THE MAP WEST OF THE DOMINIONS OF ABU SAID.\n\n\u5409\u601d\u7b54\u4f60 Ki-sze-da-ni = Constantinah or Constantinople.\n\n210. Constantinah was the name by which the Arabs, Persians and Turks used to designate Constantinople (Bibl. Orient. p. 252). The Mongol khans in Persia were generally on good terms with the Byzantine emperors, and several marriages of Byzantine princesses with Mongol khans are recorded by the Byzantine chroniclers. Hulagu demanded in marriage a daughter of Michael Paleologus, named Mary, who was sent in compliance with this demand; but when she arrived in Persia, Hulagu was dead, and she was married to his son and successor Abaka khan. This princess is mentioned by Rashid under the name of Tespina (D'Ohsson, tom. iii, p. 418),\u2014evidently the Greek Despoina. Andronicus the elder is said to have given his natural daughter to Ghazan khan of Persia, and a few years later his sister Mary to Oldjaitu khan (D'Ohsson, tom. iv, pp. 315, 318). Other Byzantine princesses were married to the khans of Kipchak.\n\n\u8ff7\u601d\u8033 Mi-sze-r = Misr or Egypt.\n\n211. By Mi-sze-r, doubtless the original name of Egypt is rendered, that being Misr in Arabic. Misr properly means \"a great city\" (Bibl. Orient. p. 585). The Hebrew name for Egypt is Mizra m.\n\nIn the Yuan shi, the name of \u5bc6\u6614\u5152 Mi-si-r, or Egypt, occurs several times; e.g. the biography of Kuo Khan in chap. cxlix, and\n\n\"... k'i-lin is a fabulous Chinese animal,\u2014the Chinese unicorn. K'i is the appellative for the male, and lin for the female. It is known that the ancients in the west also believed in the existence of the unicorn, or an animal with one horn; and even now the people of western Asia and Africa still believe in its existence. Some modern zoologists are of opinion, that the antelope, called oryx leucoryx, and found in Nubia, has given rise to the belief in the unicorn.\n\n\"... T'o-ki or \"camel fowl\" is the \"ostrich.\" See Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 88.\n\n\"... I know nothing about fu-lu. Perhaps the foreign name of a bird or beast is represented by this sound. With respect to ling yang this term is given in the Pen ts'ao kang mu (chap. i, fol. 34) as a synonyme of \u5927\u5c3e\u7f8a ta-wei yang or \"broad-tailed sheep.\"\nAnnals, sub anno 1353. Ch'ang Te in his account of the countries of the west, gives some particulars respecting Mi-si-r (see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 85).\n\nThe Ming shi, chap. ccxxxii, fol. 22, has also an article on \u7c73\u6614\u5152 Mi-si-r. Several embassies from Egypt to the Chinese court, in the 15th century, are there recorded. One was sent in 1441 by su-li-tan A-shi-la-fu.\n\n\u7684\u8ff7\u5931\u5409 Di-mi-shi-gi = Dimishik or Damascus.\n\n212. The history of Damascus can be traced back to the narratives of Holy Scripture, where this city, the capital of one of the kingdoms of Syria, is often mentioned. Dimishik is the Arabic name of Damascus. It appears frequently in the Persian annals, in connection with the wars of the Mongol khans of Persia with the sultans of Egypt, in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nIn a letter addressed by Arghun khan of Persia to king Philip of France, written in Mongol in 1289, and preserved in the French archives, Damascus is termed Dimiski (Pauthier's M. Polo, p. 776).\n\nIn the M\u00e9m. cone. les Chinois, tom. xiv, Father Amiot has translated a number of letters, sent by some sovereigns of western Asia to the Ming emperors of China. On page 246, the translation of a letter by the sovereign of Ty-mi-shi is found. As Amiot had sent to Paris a copy of the original text of the letters (written in Persian), together with the Chinese translation, R\u00e9musat was enabled to ascertain that by Ty-mi-shi, Damascus was meant.\n\n\u4e39\u7259 Dan-ya = Damiath or Damietta.\n\n213. Although the position assigned to Dan-ya on the ancient map (north of Constantinople) does not suit Damietta, I suppose that this city was meant. At least there was no country or city north of Constantinople bearing a similar name.\n\nThe original name of Damietta is Damiath (Bibl. Orient. p. 266). The Catalan map has Damyat. This ancient city, situated on the eastern mouth of the Nile, played an important part in the crusades. The Mongol armies never advanced so far as Damietta, but of course the name was well known to them.\n\n---\n\nAshref was a favorite name among the Mameluke sultans of Egypt.\n\nIn my pamphlet, \"On the knowledge possessed by the Chinese of the Arabs etc.\" on p. 22, I stated that these letters had been addressed to the emperor K'ang-hi of the present dynasty. I did so on the authority of A. R\u00e9musat (M\u00e9langes Asiatiques, tom ii, p. 249). But now, when referring to Amiot's original translation, I see that R\u00e9musat misunderstood Amiot; for the latter clearly says, that the letters in question date from the time of the Ming.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nI may be allowed to review here, in completion of my notices of the medi\u00e6val geography of central and western Asia, two narratives of Asiatic travel in the 13th century, to which frequent reference has been made in these pages. The first comprises the journey of Haithon, king of little Armenia, to Mongolia and back; the second records the adventures of a Mongol officer during his peregrinations in central Asia. These two itineraries mention many places marked on the ancient Chinese map, which has been reviewed in the foregoing part, and thus furnish corroborative evidence of its authenticity.\n\nI. THE JOURNEY OF HAITHON, KING OF LITTLE ARMENIA,\nTO MONGOLIA AND BACK, A.D. 1254\u20141255.\n\nThis narrative of the journey was originally written in Armenian, by Kirakos Kaidzaketsi, who accompanied king Haithon to Mongolia. A manuscript copy of it, dated 1616, was found in the monastery of Sanahin in southern Georgia, and was translated into Russian by the Armenian prince Argutinsky, and published in the Russian periodical Sibirsky Vestnik, 1822, pp. 69 sqq. Klapproth translated it from the Russian version into French:\u2014see Nouv. Journal. Asiat. tom. xii, pp. 214, 273 sqq.\n\nI shall not here give a complete English version of Haithon's narrative, but intend merely to review that part of the journey bearing directly upon the subject of my investigations in this paper.\n\nHaithon I (or Hethum as the name is written in the Armenian text), son of Constantine Rupen, became king by his marriage with Isabella, daughter and only child of Leon II, king of Little Armenia. Haithon ascended the throne in 1224, abdicated in 1269, in favor of his son Leon III, and then became a monk. The narrative of his journey is entitled:\n\nTRAVELS OF HAITHON, THE PIous KING OF THE ARMENIANS,\nTO BATU AND MANGU KHANS, IN 703 AND 704 OF\nTHE ARMENIAN ERA (A.D. 1254\u20141255).\n\nHaithon, who resided in the city of Sis in Cilicia, sent (in 1246) his brother Sempad, commander-in-chief of his troops, to Kuyuk khan, with presents. Sempad returned from the court\n\n---\n\n* * * King Haithon I is not to be confounded with his kinsman Haithon, prince of Gorhigos, who also became a monk, and is the author of the Histoire des Pays Orientaux, written in 1307 by N. Salcon (Faulcon) in Poitiers, from the dictation of Haithon. Compare Bergeron's Voyages en Asie.\nof the Great khan,\u2014where he had been well received,\u2014bringing letters from the monarch.\n\nAfter Mangu khan's accession, the great basileopater and general Batu,\u2014who had established himself in the north, on the borders of a large river called Ethil (Volga), which empties into the Caspian sea,\u2014sent to king Haithon, inviting him to come and proceed to the court of Mangu khan. The king, who was in fear of Batu, departed secretly and disguised; for he had to pass through the dominions of the sultan of Rum, who hated him on account of the assistance he had received from the Tartars. He arrived safely at the city of Kars (north-east of Erzerum), where he saw Bachu nuin, the commander-in-chief of the Tartar army in the east. After this, Haithon proceeded through the country of the Aghovans, passed the gate of Darband (192) and the fortress Djora, and then went to see Batu, and his son Sartakh who was a Christian. Both treated him with honour, and sent him on to the court of Mangu khan, by a very long route beyond the Caspian sea.\n\nHaithon (and his companions) started on the 13th of May, 1254. After crossing the river Aiekh, they arrived at Hor, which was midway between Batu and Mangu khans. Thence they proceeded to Erthidj, entered the country of the A\u00efmani, and then got to Khara-khitai.\n\n---\n\n**Sempad was four years absent. We possess a letter from him written on the journey. See Yule's Cathay, p. cxxvii.**\n\n**The Baidju noyen of the Persian historians.**\n\n**Perhaps Madjar. See above, 63.**\n\n**The \u6492\u91cc\u7b54 Sa-li-t'a of the Chinese authors. See above, 89.**\n\nRubruquis says however, p. 263:\u2014\"De Sartach autem, utrum credit in Christum vel non, nescio.

Habet etiam circa se nestorinos sacerdotes, qui pulsant tabulam et cantant officium suum.\"\n\n**The Yaikh of the middle ages, now Emba, an affluent of the Caspian.**\n\nJudging from the position assigned to this place in the itinerary, we must look for it somewhere near lake Balkash, or in Tarbagatai. I have not been able however, to find such a name in other medi\u00e6val authors.\n\nBy Erthidj evidently the river Irtysh is meant, and A\u00efmani is intended for Naiman, a people to whom Rashid assigns the country near the sources of the Irtysh. The Chinese authors term them \u4e43\u86ee Nai-man.\n\nThe country Haithon now passed through belonged indeed to the Kara-khitai, before this people went to Turkistan (see Part I). Ch'ang-ch'un, in 1221, saw the ruins of a city of the Kara-khitai somewhere between the present Urga and Uliassutai. See Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 23.\nOn the 13th of September, Haithon had an audience with Mangu khan (in or near Karakorum I suppose), and offered his gifts. He was treated with all the honour due to his rank, and staid ten days with Mangu khan's son. A diploma with the imperial seal was granted him, insuring his safety throughout the Mongol states.\n\nThe party set out on their homeward journey on November 1st, 1254. They arrived in three hundred and thirty days at Ghumshghur, went on to Berbaligh and then to Beshbaligh. After this a desert is spoken of by the diarist, inhabited by naked wild men, who have their heads covered with horse-hair. The breasts of their women are extremely large and pendent; the people being indeed veritable brutes. There are also wild horses of a yellow and black colour. They are bigger in size than common horses and donkeys. Wild camels with two humps are also met with there.\n\nFurther on, the way of king Haithon led through Yarlekh, Kuluk, Henkukh, Djambalekh, Khuta\u00efya\u00ef and Yankibalekh, after which they entered Turkistan.\n\nRubruquis had left the court of Mangu two or three months before Haithon arrived.\n\nThis figure is without doubt a clerical error.\n\nA place unknown to me, but situated probably near the lake Kizilbash. As the diarist states that Haithon passed through Bishbalik, it may be assumed that he travelled by the same route as Ch'ang-ch'un.\n\nBishbalik, the present Urumtsi;\u2014see above, 108.\n\nThe story of wild men in the desert of Dsungaria seems to have been current in the middle ages. Carpini's report on the subject reads as follows (pp. 648, 649):\u2014\"In terr\u00e2 autem Kara-Kitaorum Occoday-can filius Chingiscan, postquam positus fuit imperator, quandam civitatem edificavit, quam Omyl appellavit: prope quam ad meridiem est quoddam desertum magnum, in quo sylvestres homines pro certo habitate dicuntur, qui nullo modo loquuntur, nec in cruribus habent juncturas; et si quando cadunt, per se surgere sine aliorum adjutorio minime possunt; sed tantam discretionem habent quod faciunt filtra de lan\u00e2 camelorum, quibus vestiuntur, et ponunt etiam contra ventum; et si aliqui Tartari vadunt ad eos et vulnerant eos sagittis, ponunt gramin\u00e6 in vulneribus et fortiter fugiunt ant\u00e8 eos.\"\n\nWild horses, known under the name of tarpan are still found in the steppes of Mongolia, as also djigeta\u00efs, which are called \"wild mules\" (equus hemionus). The djigeta\u00ef is about the size of a mule, and is of a yellowish color. Perhaps by \"wild horses,\" the diarist means the djigeta\u00ef. As to the wild camels, their existence in our day in the deserts of western Mongolia, has been ascertained by Col. Przewalsky; and Col. D. Forsyth proves, that they are found also in the deserts near Turphan (Proc. Roy. Geogr. Soc. No. xviii, \"Elias, on Przewalsky's travels\"). The embassy of Shah Rokh, sent to China in 1419, fell in with a wild camel between Kamul and the Chinese frontier.\n\nAs to the first three of these names, I cannot trace them in any itinerary of other medieval travellers, nor can I find similar names on the maps referring to those regions. With respect to Djambalekh, see above, 114. Khuta\u00efya\u00ef is probably the Gu-ta-ba of the ancient map (115) and the Khotukhai of modern maps. Yankibalekh is the Yang-gi-ba-li of the ancient\nThe next stations mentioned in the itinerary are,\u2014Tsokopruk, Dinkabalekh, Pulad, Sutkul,\u2014the last name is explained by the diarist by \"Sea of milk,\"\u2014Halualekh and Ilan-baleck. Further on, they passed over the river Ilan su, crossed a branch of the Thoros mountains, and arrived at Talas, where they saw Hulavu the brother of Mangu khan, who had taken the east as his portion.\n\nThence they proceeded in a north-westerly direction, passing through Kutughchin, Barkant, Sulghan, Urusoghan, Kayi-kant, Khuzark or Kamots, Khendakhoir and Senghakh. There is the mountain Kharchuk, whence the Seldjuks came; where is also the beginning of the mount Thoros. Further on they reached Phartchin, and turned aside in order to meet Sartakh, the son of Batu, who was on his way to Mangu khan. They then returned to Senghakh and continued their route to the large city of Savran, after which they passed through Kharchulch, Yasun, Savri, Otrar, Zurnukh and Dizak.\n\nmap (116), and Yangibalgasun of modern maps. All these places are situated on the great highway between Urumtsi and Kuldja.\n\nDinkabalekh may perhaps be traced in modern Dzing-ho, the name of a river and of a city situated on the great route from Urumtsi to Kuldja, east of lake Sairam. Regarding Pulad, the Pu-la of the Chinese authors, see above, 122. The name Sutkul and the appellation \"Sea of milk\" have been satisfactorily explained by Klapproth. In the language of the Kirghiz, Sutkul even now means \"Lake of milk;\" and this name is applied by the Kirghiz to lake Sairam of our maps, north-east of modern Kuldja. Sairam, or as Klapproth correctly writes Sairim or Chagan Sairim nor (the white lake of tranquility) is its Mongol name. Halualekh is evidently a corruption of Almalik (117), situated near the present Kuldja. Ilan-baleck is probably the I-la-ba-li of the ancient Chinese map (124).\n\nSu or usu in Mongol means \"river.\" By Ilan su probably the Ilis river is meant.\n\nBy Thoros probably the Alatau is meant, the high mountain chain which stretches along the northern shore of lake Issikul. The traveller proceeding from Kuldja to Tashkand has to cross the north-western spur of the Alatau, by the defile of Kastek. The Chinese traveller Ch'ang Te in 1259, after having left Alimali (Kuldja), and before reaching the country where the Kara-khitai had dwelt (on the Chu river), mentions a place Yi-tu on the way, situated between two mountains. I have little doubt, that the Chinese traveller alludes to the Kastek pass. Compare Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 74.\n\nWith respect to Talas, see note 59.\n\nBy east here, western Asia, i.e., the Orient in our sense is meant.\n\nOf the greater part of these names I can make nothing. They may partly refer to obscure places not mentioned by other medieval authors. Haithon left for a while the direct road leading from Talas through Sairam to Samarcan, and went in a north-westerly direction to meet Sartakh. Among the cities he passed through, Senghakh is noticed also by Rashid-eddin. When Chinghiz' host had reached Otrar, it was divided into four corps. One under the command of Djuchi was sent along the border of the\nFrom Dizak they reached Semergend in thirty days. Next they came to Sariphuch, Kerman and Bokura; reached the great river Djehun (Amu-daria); crossed it and then proceeded to Mermen, Serakhs and Thus; the last place is on the border of Khorassan, called also Raughastan. After that they entered Mozanderan, passed through Bestan and the country of Eraz, situated at the frontier of the Mulliet, and then came to Thamghain and the great city of Hrei.\n\nSihon downward, and the first city captured by the Mongols on this way was Signac (see above, 49). After this Uzkend and Barkhalighkend were taken. The latter, as has been pointed out on a previous page, is the same as the Ba-r-ch'i-li-han of the map, the Ba-r-djen of the Yuan shi, the Barchin of Carpini, and the Phartchin of Haithon (see above, 163 and note 91). The mountain Kharchuk, where the Thoros begins, is the mountain chain stretching in a north-western direction between the river Talas and the Sir-daria, and named Karatau on modern maps. The diarist of Haithon's journey seems to comprise in the name Thoros, the Alatau, Alexander's chain, and the Karatau. The great city Savran in the itinerary has been identified by Klapproth with a place of a similar name situated on the Sir-daria; but Savran on modern maps is located in the vicinity of the ruins of Otrar, whilst our itinerary puts three stations between Savran and Otrar. I should rather think that the great city Savran of Haithon is the same as Sairam (162), of which Rashid-eddin also says, that it is a very large city. Supposing I am right, then the diarist of the ancient itinerary would intimate, that Otrar was situated on the way from Sairam to Samarcan. It is worthy of notice, that our map also places Otrar between Sairam and Samarcan. On modern maps we find the ruins of ancient Otrar marked north-west of Sairam, near the city of Turkistan. I am not aware whether the position of ancient Otrar indeed has been ascertained. In the books at my disposal, I find nothing with respect to modern researches concerning the ruins of this city. Zurnukh of Haithon is the same as Zernuk of the Persian authors (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 227). When Chinghiz proceeded from Otrar to Bokhara, Zernuk was the first place he attacked. Dizak in the ancient itinerary is the Djizak of modern maps, situated north-east of Samarcan.\n\nThere is a mistake again in the figure, for the distance between Dizak and Samarcan is only eighty English miles.\n\nWith respect to Sariphuch I may observe, that Mr. Khanikoff, in his itinerary from Samarcan to Bokhara (\"Description of the Khanate of Bokhara,\" p. 98), mentions a place Shahri khatyn between Samarcan and Kermin\u00e9, the latter being identical with the Kerman of Haithon. The same place is spoken of in the Liao shi, under the name of \u8d77\u5152\u6f2b K'i-i-r-man (see above, 26).\n\nMermen is intended, it seems, for Meru Shahjan (see above, 174). Serakhs is mentioned by Rashid (172). On modern maps it is found about forty-six English miles north-east of Meshed. Concerning Thus, see 147.\n\nThis is still the name of a Persian province, on the southern shore of the Caspian sea.\n\nBestan or Bistam, as Rashid writes it, is still the name of a city on the route from Meshed to Teheran. It is situated north-east of Damegan (see above, 177), which is the Thamghain of Haithon. The name Eraz is probably a mistake. Haithon really passed through the country of Cumuss, of which Damegan was the capital. Mulhet denotes the Mulahida, Ismaelians\nFurther on, the itinerary mentions Khezovin (Kasvin;\u2014185), Avakhr (Abhar, 189), Zanghian (Zendjan, 191), and Miana; from which place they reached Tavrej in twelve days.\n\nEight months after quitting the court of Mangu khan, Haithon arrived at the frontier of Armenia, in July, 1255.\n\nII. THE PEREGRINATIONS OF YE-L\u00dc HI-LIANG IN CENTRAL ASIA, A.D. 1260\u20142162.\n\nTranslated from his biography in the Yuan shi, chap. clxxx.\n\nYe-l\u00fc Hi-liang was the great-grandson of Ye-l\u00fc Ch'u-t's'ai (Chinghiz khan's and Ogotai's minister;\u2014see Notes on Chin. Med. Trav. p. 108). The name of Hi-liang's father was Chu. Hi-liang was born near Ho-lin (Karakorum). Father and son were both distinguished scholars, and held offices under Suan-tsung (Mangu khan). In the year 1258, when the emperor encamped among the mountains Liu-pan shan, Hi-liang was with him; and when Mangu subsequently directed his host southward, Hi-liang and his father accompanied him.\n\nor Assassins (see above, 183, 184). Here is the same as ancient Rayi, of which the ruins may be seen about six English miles south of Teheran.\n\nThe city of Miana, famed for its poisonous bugs (argas persicus), is only fifty English miles distant from Tavrej or Tebriz, the capital of Azerbaijan. The figures in the distances given in Haithon's itinerary are all exaggerated, or perhaps Haithon travelled very slowly.\n\nThe mountain Liu-pan shan has still the same name. On modern Chinese maps it is marked in the department of Ping-liang in Kansu, south of the city of Ku-yilan chou. According to the Chinese annals T'ung kien kang mu, Chinghiz died near this mountain, in 1227, after having subdued the Tangut empire. The Yuan shi however, implies that he died in northern Mongolia. We read there in the Annals, under the year 1227, that \"in the 5th intercalary month the emperor moved to the mountain Liu-pan shan in order to avoid the heat of the summer. In the 6th month, the empire of the Hia (Tangut) submitted. Chinghiz rested on the river Si-kiang, in the district of Ts'ing-shui (in Kansu; it has still the same name).\n\nIn autumn, in the 7th month, on the day jen-wu, the emperor fell ill, and eight days later died in his 'palace,' ha-lao-t'u, on the river Sa-li.\" The river Sa-li is repeatedly mentioned in the Yuan shi, viz.\u2014in the first chapter, in connection with the first military doings of Chinghiz. Rashid reports (D'Ohsson, tom. i, p. 58) that Chinghiz, in 1199, retired to his residence Sari kihar. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi (Palladius' translation, p. 81) writes the same name Saari kchor. Keber in modern Mongol means \"plain.\" On the ancient map of Mongolia found in the Yuan shi lei pien (see above, 10), Sa-li k'ie-r is marked south of the river Wa-nan (the Onon of our maps), and close to Sa-li k'ie-r we read the characters \u5143\u521d\u8d77\u6b64; i.e., \"here was the original abode of the...\"\nIn the year 1259, the emperor died in \u8700 Shu, when Hi-liang with the heavy baggage (of the army) proceeded northward to the province of Shensi. In the next year, 1260, Shi-tsu (Kubilai) was elected emperor, when \u963f\u91cc\u4e0d\u54e5 A-li-bu-ko revolted (against his brother). Kubilai sent to \u6f22\u90fd\u6d77 Hun-du-hai, to require him to appear. Chu (the father of Hi-liang) tried to persuade him and the other officers; but Hun-du-hai refused. Chu thereupon left his wife and his sons, and made haste to Kubila\u00ef to offer his service. Hun-du-hai then became enraged and sent a hundred horsemen in pursuit, but they could not catch him. Hun-du-hai then arrested Hi-liang, his mother and his son, and forced them to accompany him. They started from \u9748\u6b66 Ling-wu, passed through \u5ef6\u5409\u91cc Ying-gi-li and \u897f\u51c9 Si-liang, and arrived at \u7518\u5dde Kan-chou.\n\nMongols.\" Thus it seems the above-translated passage in the Yilan shi intimates that Chinghiz died in Mongolia, and not at the Liu-pan shan as is generally believed. The Yilan ch'ao pi shi (Palladius' translation, p. 152) and the Ts'in cheng lu (Palladius' translation, p. 195) both agree in stating, that after having subdued the Tangut empire, Chinghiz returned home and then died. Col. Yule in his M. Polo (vol. i, p. 216) states, that Rashid-eddin calls the place of Chinghiz' death Leung-Shan, which appears to be intended for Liu-pan shan. It is strange that D'Ohsson does not mention this statement of the Persian historian. In 1268, when Mangu khan waged war with the Sung, and commanded his host in person, he had for a time established his head-quarters among the mountains of Liu-pan shan (Yilan shi, sub anno), and then proceeded to Sze-ch'nan, where he died.\n\nShu is the ancient name for what is now called the province of Sze-ch'uan. There are some discrepancies in the reports of the chroniclers respecting the death of Mangu khan. The Chinese annals T'ung kien kang mu records, that he died in the 7th month of 1259, before the walls of \u5408\u5dde Ho-chou, which city had been besieged without success for several months (Ho-chou, a city in Sze-ch'uan still bears the same name;\u201430\u00b0 8' N. lat.). The Yilan shi gives the 13th of the 7th month as the date of Mangu's death, and states that he died after an illness of several weeks, near the hill \u9b5a\u9b5a\u5c71 Tiao-yii shan. This name is not found on modern Chinese maps; but it appears from the Yilan shi, that this hill or mountain was in the vicinity of Ho-chou. M. Polo (vol. i, p. 216) makes Mangu die by an arrow shot. Haithon says, that he was drowned.\n\nThe Persian authors call him Arik-buga. He was the youngest brother of Mangu and Kubilai; and when Mangu departed for China, Arik-buga was intrusted with the regency. He had his residence in Karakorum, and after Mangu's death and the election of Kubilai, laid claim to the supreme khanship.\n\nAfter the death of Mangu khan, Kondukai was left at the head of the Mongol troops in Shensi. He embraced the cause of Arik-buga (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 346).\n\nAn ancient city situated near the present Ling-chou, south-east of Ning-hia fu in Kansu.\n\nThe present Ning-hia chung-wei 37\u00b0 40' N. lat.\n\nNow Liang-chou fu.\n\nThe present Kan-chou fu.\nMeanwhile \u963f\u862d\u7b54\u5152 A-lan-da-r, the commander-in-chief of A-li-bu-ko's troops, marched out from Ho-lin (Karakorum) to effect his junction with Hun-du-hai, and arrived at the mountain \u7121\u652f\u5c71 Yen-chi shan. When he saw Hi-liang, he inquired about his father. Hi-liang answered, that he knew nothing about him, and that if he could have known where he was fleeing to, he would have been with him. Some while after, they met the imperial army (of Kubila\u00ef), and A-lan-da-r and Hun-du-hai were both defeated and killed. The remains of their troops went to the north, where they rallied under the command of \u54c8\u524c\u4e0d\u82b1 Ha-la bu-hua. Hi-liang, succeeded in escaping, and hid himself in the \u6c99\u9640 sha-t'o, north of Kan-chou, and east of \u9ed1\u6c34 Hei-shui. Ha-la bu-hua passed there with his army, without detecting Hi-liang; but some time after, when some straggling soldiers arrived, looking for horses, an old woman betrayed his retreat, and he was then arrested and brought to \u8607\u5dde Su-chou, to the commander-in-chief. Ha-la bu-hua was related to Hi-liang's father; they had served together in the last campaign in Shu (Szech'uan); and it had once happened, that Ha-la bu-hua fell ill, when Chu sent him a physician and supplied him with meat and wine. In grateful remembrance of these things, Ha-la bu-hua released Hi-liang, saying:\u2014\u201cYour father did me friendly service, I am happy to repay it now in granting you your freedom.\u201d\n\nHi-liang then proceeded to the northern river of \u6c99\u5dde Sha-chou. He was obliged to travel on foot with his brothers; and they carried their own baggage, without eating cooked food for many days. Being then winter time, they had to walk through the snow. After crossing the \u5929\u5c71 T'ien shan (Celestial mountains) Hi-liang arrived at \u5317\u5ead\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c Pei-t'ing tu-hu fu.\n\nIn 1261 they arrived at the city of \u660c\u516b\u91cc Djang-ba-li. In summer they crossed the river \u99ac\u7d0d\u601d Ma-na-sze, and\n\n---\n\n307 The Karabuka of Rashid.\n308 The literal meaning of sha-t'o is \u201csandy downs.\u201d This is the name applied by the Chinese to the sandy part of the great Mongolian desert.\n309 Sha-chou in western Kansu (see above, 90). The Chinese text has \u6c99\u5dde\u5317\u5ddd Sha-chou pei-chuan, \u201cthe northern river of Sha-chou.\u201d But perhaps Pei-chuan is the name of a place.\n400 The same as Bishbalik, or the present Urumtsi. See above, 109. Hi-liang went, it seems, from Sha-chou to Pei-t'ing by the common route, leading through the desert, and then passing through Kamul, Karakhodjo, etc.\n401 Djambalik, mentioned in Haithon's itinerary, and marked on the ancient map (114).\n402 Manass is still the name of a city in Dzungaria. It lies on the great road from Urumtsi to Kuldja, on the river of the same name.\nfinally reached \u8449\u5bc6\u91cc Ye-mi-li. This city was the capital of the apanage given to Ting-tsung (Kuyuk khan) when he was heir-apparent. At that time the younger sister of the sixth empress was queen regent (in that country). She and the prince Ho-hu were desirous of presenting themselves to the emperor (Kubilai). Hi-liang's mother, who was well aware of their situation, was desirous that her son should see the queen regent, but it was not possible. In winter of the same year Hi-liang proceeded to the country of \u706b\u5b5b Huo-bu.\n\nIn 1262 the \u5927\u540d\u738b Ta-ming wang, Ting-tsung's (Kuyuk's) youngest son, who commiserated Hi-liang in his misfortunes, in that he was unable to return home, made him a present of silk stuffs and a saddled horse. Hi-liang accompanied the prince to the country of \u5ffd\u53ea\u5152 Hu-dji-r.\n\nAt that time it happened that the prince \u963f\u9b6f\u5ffd A-lu-hu gave orders to kill the officer appointed by A-li-bu-ko, and was desirous of submitting to the emperor (Kubila\u00ef). Hi-liang joined the two princes A-lu-hu and Ta-ming wang, who returned to\n\n---\n\n403 The city of Emil or Imil.

After the death of her husband, she was, according to the Persian historians, for eight years (1252\u20141260) regent of the middle empire and resided in Almalik. She was dethroned by Arik-buga, who set upon the throne of Chagatai, another of his grandsons named Algu. Algu subsequently married Organa.\n406 Ho-hu was the third and youngest son of Kuyuk khan (Yilan shi, chap. cvii, genealogical table).\n407 This country belonged also to the apanages of Kuyuk's and Ogota\u00ef's descendants. In the Yilan shi, beginning of chap. ii, it is stated, that after Chinghiz died, Ogota\u00ef came from the country of \u970d\u535a Ho-bo to attend the funeral.\n408 Ta-ming wang = \"prince of Ta-ming.\" The latter is the name of a department in the province of Chili. According to the Annals of the Yilan shi, sub anno 1236, Ta-ming was given as an apanage to Ku-yuk. It seems, that the afore-mentioned prince Ho-hu and Ta-ming wang are identical.\n409 In the biography of Subutai (see above, 60) a similar name of a place or country is mentioned. It is stated there that Subutai, after having finished the campaign in the west, went home by the way of Ye-mi-li (Imil) and \u970d\u53ea Ho-dji. There is a place Boro huljir marked on the Russian maps of central Asia, on the road from Kuldja to Kopal; but it may be questioned whether this name occurs so early.\n410 Rashid-eddin tells us (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 352) that Algu (see note 405), who at first was allied to Arik-buga, after having heard of the defeat of the latter, declared himself for Kubilai khan, and ordered the three commissaries left by Arik-buga in Algu's states, to be put to death. Arik-buga then marched against Algu.\nYe-mi-li. The Ta-ming wang offered to Hi-liang a present of pendants, consisting of two pearls as large as hazel-nuts and worth a thousand liang, wishing that he might wear them in his ears. But Hi-liang declined to receive the present, saying, that he dared not injure the body received from his father and mother, and that besides this he had no merits. The prince then unfastened his own girdle richly adorned with gold, and gave it to Hi-liang, saying:\u2014\"I hope this present will not injure your body.\"\n\nIn the 5th month (1262) they met the army of A-li-bu-ko and were forced to retreat westward for fifteen hundred li. They reached the country of \u62c9\u5229\u6492\u91cc Bu-lie sa-li, and in the 6th month the country of \u6a2a\u624e\u5b6b Huan-dja-sun. They passed through the city of \u4e0d\u523a Bu-la, and proceeding westward for six hundred li, arrived at the mountain \u5fb7\u5fb7\u91cc\u6fa4\u523a Ch'e-ch'e-li tse-la. The queen regent and the heavy baggage were left behind. Hi-liang's mother and brothers also remained there. Hi-liang departed alone on horseback, and after riding more than two hundred li, reached the city of \u51fa\u5e03\u5152 Ch'u-bu-r, and a hundred li further on arrived at the city of \u4e5f\u91cc\u5ea6 Ye-li-k'ien, where he met the host of Ha-la-bu-hua (Arik-buga's general;\u2014see above.) He then again joined the two princes, who had rallied their forces, and returned to the city of Bu-la, where a battle was fought with Ha-la-bu-hua, who was defeated and lost his life. His head was then packed up and sent by a courier to the emperor (Kubilai).\n\nIn the 11th month they went to the country of Y\u00fc-i-sze-kuan (Uzkend ?), and in the year 1263, reached \u53ef\u5931\u54c8\u91cc K'o-shi-ha-li (Kashgar;\u2014130). In the 4th month they\n\n---\n\n411 On this name and the next I can throw no light; but it may be noticed that the name Sari occurs frequently on modern maps of the regions here spoken of, e.g. Gurban Sari, Sari Bulak, etc.\n\n412 The city of Pulad, situated as has been proved above (122), near lake Sairam. It is the Pulad of Haithon.\n\n413 I know nothing about this mountain.\n\n414 Perhaps Yarkand is meant; but the indications in Hi-liang's itinerary are so vague that it is quite impossible to venture any identification of the places last mentioned.\n\n415 This statement about the battle at Bu-la corresponds in a general way with Rashid's record (D'Ohsson, tom. ii, p. 353). The Persian historian reports, that Karabuka, who commanded the avant-guard of Arik-buga, met the troops of the prince Algu, near the city of Pulad and the lake Sut (the Sutkul of Haithon,\u2014the lake Sairam). A battle was fought there and Karabuka was defeated and killed. Subsequently however Algu was attacked and defeated by Assutai, who had arrived at the head of Arik-buga's forces. Algu was forced to abandon his apanage and retreat to Khotan and Kashgar with his right flank, and finally withdrew towards Samarcan.\nwere again attacked by the host of Ha-la-bu-hua, near the city of Hun-ba-sheng. At that time the mother of Hi-liang was still with the queen regent, who spent the summer in the mountains of A-ti-ba-sheng.\n\nMeanwhile Chu (the father of Hi-liang) had put the emperor (Kubilai) in mind of his son's being still in the countries of the north-western frontier; whereupon the emperor sent letters to the two princes, ordering them to dispatch Hi-liang as a courier. In the 6th month, the latter passed through the city of K'u-sien, reached Ha-la-huo-djo and I-chou, crossed the ta-mo (great desert), and in the 8th month presented himself to the emperor in Shang-tu and reported on the state of things at the frontier etc.\n\n---\n\n415 Probably Alapasha is meant.

LITTLE, F.R.G.S.\n\nThe year just past has been marked by two events of great importance, in so far as this part of the world is concerned: the murder of Augustus Raymond Margary, assistant in H. B. M.'s Consular service, and the death of the Emperor known by the style of T'ung-chi. Both events created great excitement at the time and promised momentous changes in the foreign relations of the empire; but in the one case a mission of enquiry has staved off the impending trouble, and in the other case the succession to the throne has been peacefully transferred to the infant under whose reign of Kwang-s\u00fc we are now living.\n\nThe news of the death of Mr. Margary reached us on the fifth of April by the mail steamer from India, but the news was known to the Chinese in Peking some ten days earlier. The sad event occurred on the 21st February at a place called Manwyne, a walled village in the Sanda valley in the \"Shan\" territory, called by the Chinese, the land of the Pa i (\u516b\u5937) or \"eight barbarian\" tribes. The attack is said to have taken place in the \"Khyong\" a sort of temple and \"guest-house\" which exists in all these towns.\u00b9 The Shans are feudatory to the Chinese. This city is often confounded with Momein in the Chinese jurisdiction of Teng-yueh chow in Yunnan: the proper name for which is Teng-yueh-ting (\u9a30\u8d8a\u5ead) a town registered in the \"Tsin-shen\" or Chinese Civil List, as a residence of a \"Ting\" magistrate, under the prefecture of Yung ch'ang foo (\u6c38\u660c\u5e9c). Mr. Margary had, after a long and adventurous journey, already passed through both cities on his way westward; and had joined Colonel Browne, who had been appointed leader of the proposed expedition through the western provinces of China in Bhamo. It was on his return journey while prospecting in advance of the party that he was fallen upon and killed; report\n\n\u00b9 Vide \"Memorial\" from the Tsungli Yam\u00ean, 28th August 1875. \"The British Interpreter Margary and his party were proceeding from Burmah into Yunnan, when, at a town fifty li southwest from the seat of government at the Shan principality of Sanda, subject to the prefecture of Yung-chang they were attacked by troops in the service of the government and [Mr. Margary was] murdered,\" &c.\nsays under the direction of the high Chinese officials of Yunnan without whose connivance the Shaus, a semi-civilised race would not have ventured such an act: whether truly or not the investigations of the commission now on its way thither, will ere long inform us. The horror and disgust which this cold blooded crime inspired in the breasts of poor Margary's fellow-countrymen, and indeed of all foreigners throughout China, led people to look for war as the only means of duly avenging the murder on the native officials who were supposed to be its instigators, and on the literati class generally who are believed to approve it. As time wore on, however, these feelings calmed down and the complicity of the mandarins was no longer felt to be an absolute certainty. Meanwhile the joint commission was determined upon by our minister at Peking; and it was hoped and believed that the real truth would be ferreted out, and the guilty brought to punishment. This commission was composed, on the British side, of the Honourable T. G. Grosvenor, second secretary of H. M. Legation at Peking and Mr. Baber, consular interpreter; together with Mr. Davenport, the then vice-consul at Shanghai, attached as a sort of legal assessor and accompanied by Sung Pao hwa: on the Chinese side, of Li Han chang, governor-general of the two Hu. They were preceded by Liu*and assisted by Ch\u00ean, late judge of the Shanghai Mixed Court; altogether a body so constituted as to ensure a fair hearing and a thorough investigation. This party started on the fifth of October from Hankow, reached Shasi on the 25th November, Ichang on the 1st December and Kwei chow fu on the 13th of that month. Li Han chang and his colleagues arrived in Yunnan fu on the 13th November and immediately sent a report to the Peking government; who published an edict on the 9th day of December last, degrading the officials concerned in the outrage, preparatory to their formal trial.\n\nSix months thus elapsed from the time the news of the murder was received to the final despatch of the commission to adjudicate upon it. The interval was filled with negotiations between the British government, represented by Mr. Wade, on the one part; and the Peking authorities, who deputed Li Hung chang, viceroy of Chihli as their plenipotentiary, on the other part. The agreement was not arrived at without enormous difficulty; and the greatest credit is due to Mr. Wade for his patience and pertinacity in bringing the negotiations to a successful issue, without having recourse to that force, which would have been the resource of a less able diplomatist. People at the time, especially his fellow-\n\n---\n\n* Liu Y\u014d-chao, Governor-General of Yunnan and Kweichow had gone to his native place in Hunan. He was now ordered to return and \"cooperate with the Governor (Ts'en y\u00fc-ying) in selecting officials of intelligence and ability to deal with the matter as justice requires.\"\ncountrymen here in China, annoyed at the long delay in exacting retribution, hardly gave Mr. Wade that full credit for his action in the matter which time is beginning to award him; and which his government has deservedly acknowledged with a K.C.B. Mr. Wade, now Sir Thomas, had an extremely difficult task to fulfil; and a slight sketch of the negotiations, as far as known, will hardly be out of place; as showing the system pursued, and at the same time the great difficulty of obtaining redress from the Chinese government in dealing with foreign affairs.\n\nNews of the outrage reached Peking at the end of March; and H. B. M.'s minister at once demanded the despatch of a high Chinese commission to investigate the crime on the spot, and bring the guilty parties, whatever their position, to punishment: at the same time insisting that no one should be sentenced until a commission of foreigners, appointed by himself, should have had the opportunity of investigating the evidence and assuring themselves of the real guilt of the accused. The Chinese were long in yielding a general compliance to this demand; until a threat of hauling down his flag induced them to give way, and to appoint Li Han chang, viceroy of the two Hu and brother of Li Hung chang as special commissioner. Meanwhile a memorial was received at Peking from the governor of Yunnan, in which the attack upon Margary was attributed to a popular outbreak, and that the only blame due to the officials was an inability to foresee the disturbance, or quell it in time. On the 19th June the first notification on the subject appeared in the Peking Gazette; viz. the appointment of Li Han chang to proceed to Yunnan \"to enquire into and settle a certain affair which had occurred in that province,\" no notice of foreigners or foreign troubles having been made. To this apparent disposition of the Chinese authorities to gloss over the matter, and let it seem to their own people one of comparative insignificance, must be attributed the hitch which about this time occurred; and which led to a renewal of negotiations and the postponement of the departure of the commission. At the same time too, the strongest orders appear to have been received from the home government by Sir Thomas Wade ordering a firm stand to be made for all the points demanded; viz. a full investigation, degradation and punishment of the guilty however high-placed; acknowledgment of the status of British subjects, and their right to travel in the country; the publication of these facts in the Government Official Gazette; and the establishment of direct intercourse with the Heads of Departments in Peking, in lieu of being limited to the Tsung-li yam\u00ean or department of Foreign Affairs as heretofore. Sir Thomas Wade spent the early summer in Shanghai, presumably in order to remain in telegraphic com-\nmunication with his government, while these negotiations were pending; and, it is said, to arrange with the Admiral of the British fleet in these waters in the event of the situation demanding ulterior measures. Colonel Browne who was in command of the escort which was attacked by the Chinese militia on the frontier of Yunnan was also present here. In August Sir Thomas, armed with full powers, returned to the north, and in Tientsin met Li Hung chang, who had been appointed as plenipotentiary on the Chinese side. Lengthened negotiation ensued, and war, which at one time was confidently expected, was prevented, it is reported, by Li's firmness in pressing on his own government the true state of affairs. For there is little doubt that in August last the Empress and her entourage were eager to fight, and if possible, oust the barbarian altogether; for which purpose they believed the Chinese army to be now, both in equipment and numbers, fitted. Prince Ch'un, the father of the boy emperor, is described as a rash man and fanatical barbarian-hater; and to his influence is attributed the qualification of Li's powers to the extent of not allowing him to concede the arraignment of Liu Yoh-chao the governor-general of Yunnan. This restriction was only made known apparently at the last moment, and our minister then retired from Tientsin to Chefoo in a gun-boat, threatening war. As the Chinese know that Sir Thomas Wade is not a man to utter empty threats, Li hereupon determined to apply once more to Peking; knowing full well that the Chinese army was in no position to face a foreign foe. He succeeded in impressing his views upon the Empresses; and upon Sir Thomas Wade's returning to Tientsin with Admiral Ryder, he met a messenger from Li conceding the point. Thus, as ever, the Chinese, finding the foreigner to be in earnest, gave way; and thus a second time has Sir Thomas by his tact and firmness saved this unwieldy empire from plunging into war, and probable self destruction. Such we believe to have been the main steps in the negotiations, the details of which we must await the publication of a blue book to confirm.\n\nOn the 28th September an edict appeared in the Peking Gazette conceding intercourse with the Great Departments of State; and on the 10th October appeared another ordering action to be taken by Li Han chang in the matter of the murder of Margary; declaring the right of foreigners to travel in the interior, and requiring the officials to take cognizance of the provisions of the treaty in this regard. Further in the Gazette of the 9th December, the failure of the prefect of Yunnan-foo to control his lawless subjects, and the neglect of the brigadier commanding the district to take cognizance of the murder of Margary and the attack on Colonel Browne's escort, and to arrest those concerned in it, is admitted, and both\nofficials (Wu K'i liang and Tsiang Tsung han) are temporarily degraded from their posts, with a view to their examination. Here the matter now stands. It remains to be seen whether the Chinese hope seriously to palm off upon the British minister a tale which requires him to believe the officials were ignorant and quiescent, and that such events as a spontaneous assembly of the militia could have taken place. It may be that the British government, anxious not to press the reigning dynasty too hard, may be satisfied with the degradation of the officials and the execution of the immediate murderers of Margary, if these can be discovered; and wink at the subterfuges of the Peking government to conceal their dishonour. Such seems to be the present home policy; but we believe that as in Turkey, the support given to an effete, corrupt and obsolete system, is a mistake, and that it would be better to let both governments collapse on the chance of something better arising to take their places; as, without external props, they would inevitably do from their own rottenness.\n\nThe accession of the Emperor, whose style or Kwo-hao is Kwang-s\u00fc (\u5149\u7dd2), was announced in the Peking Gazette of 16th January; and we learn from the North-China Herald, to which able periodical, and notably to the translations of the Peking Gazettes regularly published therein, we are indebted for many of the facts of this Retrospect, that this name was selected from a sentence occurring in a state paper of the Sung dynasty, entitled \"Memorial requesting the bestowal of a title of honour.\" The sentence is as follows: \u5149\u5fa9\u4e0d\u7dd2 Kwang fuh-p'ei s\u016b i.e. \"gloriously renew the dynastic continuation,\" so that Kwang-s\u00fc may be freely rendered as \"Glorious succession.\" The boy's own name is Tsai t'ien (\u8f09\u6e49), and he is a cousin of the late emperor, styled T'ung-chi (\u540c\u6cbb) or \"Law and order,\" who had commenced his reign in August 1861. He is the ninth of the line of the T'sing or Manchu dynasty, inaugurated in the year 1644 by the Tartar conqueror, Shun-che.\n\nThe late emperor, T'ung-che, was born on the 27th April 1856, his death thus occurring in his 19th year. The death of his father Hien-feng (\"Plenty\") which took place at Jehol on the 17th August 1861, after his flight from Peking in the autumn of the previous year, when the allied forces menaced the capital, left the guardianship of the young heir apparent a prize to be disputed for by the powers at court. The dispute which was naturally to be expected in an Oriental palace took place. The princes Su-chun, Ts'ai-yuen and Twan-hwa, members of the Blood Royal, strongly opposed to the peace policy of which prince Kung was the foremost representative, having proclaimed the emperor, endeavoured to seize the reins of\ngovernment and form a regency in which their own party should have unlimited sway. The Empress Dowager (\"Mother of the State\"), and the mother of the sovereign, were admitted to the Council of the Regency, nominally as guardians of the boy emperor. Prince Kung was excluded, and the empresses, being dissatisfied with Su-shun's conduct, arranged a coup d'\u00e9tat with the former prince. The three conspiring princes were arrested, tried and condemned to be cut to pieces: this sentence was commuted to the decapitation of Su-shun, and the self-strangulation of the other two.\n\nThe young emperor ascended the throne, nominally at the commencement of the year 1862, which is called the first of T'ung-che, (the year in which one emperor dies continues to be called by his style), the administration of the government devolving upon the Empresses Dowager as Regents, with his uncle Prince Kung as chief adviser. On the 16th October 1872, he was married; and on the 23rd February following he assumed the reins of government. We know little of the character or capacity of the deceased emperor; but there are grounds for believing that he inherited some of the energy which distinguished the earlier monarchs of the dynasty. Opportunity of the crisis produced by his death was taken to make Li Hung chang, a Chinese (native of Ngan-hui) senior of the Ta hio aze or Grand Secretaries of State, a precedence hitherto assigned to a Manchu. Speculations have been rife as to the likelihood of this powerful viceroy overturning the Manchus and establishing a native dynasty in his own person; but all we can learn goes to show that no such disloyalty is felt either by Li or any other of the high Chinese officials; and that the Manchu dynasty are no more regarded as intruders than is the German family that now sits on the throne of England. In both instances as long as the government is carried on in accordance with the ancient principles of constitutionalism on the one side, and of a democratic autocracy on the other, no opposition is likely or even conceivable. No: the danger to the Manchu dynasty is from without.\n\nOn the morning following the death of T'ung-chi, which took place on the 12th January, it was reported in Peking that a grand child of his eldest uncle, the Prince of Tun had, in the absence of a direct heir, been selected for the succession; but later in the day it became known that the two Empresses (i.e. the Empress Dowager and Empress Mother of T'ung-chi) had selected the only son of the seventh prince, the Prince of Ch'un. This child, who was born in 1871 and is thus five years old, was designated as a successor to the throne in a decree of the Empresses, sanctioned, it was said, in a valedictory manifesto of the departed sovereign. The Empress Mother and the Princess of Ch'un are sisters, and are said to be daughters of a Manchu functionary, formerly in office as\nTao-tai of the Kwei-sui district in Shansi, named Ch\u00eang-lin \u5f81\u9e9f.\n\nThe result shews that the empresses have known how to maintain and exalt the position gained by their coup d'\u00e9tat in 1861, when they seized the reins of power after the death of Hien-feng; and we cannot but admire the vigour, and determination with which they appear to dominate the rival parties, and bend princes and ministers to their will. We believe that, in truth, the Empresses Regent are now carrying on personal government in a way hardly credited in Europe. Placing themselves behind a curtain they receive the numerous officials daily going up from all parts of the vast empire to Peking for audience, and we are told that the Empress Mother particularly shews no little discernment in judging of the character of the officials brought before her, and in selecting them for appropriate posts.\n\nThe past year has witnessed the evacuation of Formosa by the Japanese troops, who have been replaced by large bodies of Chinese sent across to subdue the natives. Very little has been done beyond organising the coast districts already in Chinese possession and extending new roads. Of the actual operations of the troops little is known with certainty, but the reports received state that in their encounters with the aborigines they were regularly repulsed as soon as they left the settled districts, notwithstanding that the men were well armed with foreign rifles and equipped for the field as no other Chinese force has yet been. At the recommendation of Shen Pao chen, the Imperial commissioner, some wise edicts encouraging the settlement of the country were issued, and the Futai of Fokien was ordered to reside in the island. The show of pacification over, the majority of the Chinese troops were withdrawn and passed through Shanghai during the summer on the way back to the districts north of the Yang-tsze, from which they had been drawn, and disbanded. To cover the expenses of this expedition and of that in the north-west against Kashgar, two small loans, secured on the Customs' revenues, were privately negotiated, one of two million taels with the Oriental Bank, and one of one million taels with the British firm of Jardine, Matheson & Co. The rate of interest upon these loans is ten per cent per annum, being an increase upon the rate at which the first loan was borrowed in the previous year through the medium of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation\u2014\u00a3627,615 at eight per cent.\n\nTurkistan has been another source of anxiety and expenditure to China during the past twelve months. Not content with quelling the rebellion in Shensi and Kansuh, the Peking government, it is said, much against the advice of the high officials outside the cabidet, desired to reduce the Mohammedan tribes beyond the wall; and to reconquer the revolted provinces of Turkistan which have\nbeen welded into a kingdom by Yacoob khan. These further efforts have been, however, unsuccessful: indeed it is reported that Tso Ts'ung t'ang's army of 100,000 men has been utterly destroyed, all but the rear guard, which had not advanced far beyond the wall, and with which was the general himself. It has been obvious from the commencement that China was in no condition to attempt the reduction of Kashgar; and the enterprise has only added to the many other heavy embarrassments of the country.\n\nThe interests of the foreigners settled in the country have continued to retrograde, and although the Chinese may have no premeditated policy of starving us out, they appear to be slowly but surely doing so. The establishment of a subsidiary line of coast steamers in the shape of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company has proved a formidable blow to foreign shipping. In this as in other instances the Chinese government has shewn itself by no means unwilling to avail of foreign arts, but with the hope of using them to keep foreigners at a distance. So of the Woosung railway, built to connect Shanghai with its port of Woosung, ten miles distant. The Chinese government possibly does not object to railways in themselves, but solely as a weapon in foreign hands. It is willing to buy and work the road itself, but not to permit foreigners to introduce the thin end of the wedge, if it can prevent it. Foreign machinery has been introduced to work the Keelung (Formosa) coal-mines, but no foreign company is allowed to own or work them. In the lower walks of trade the superior economy of the natives is fast ousting foreigners from ground once their own, such as storekeeping, printing, carpentering and blacksmith work; whereby the number of foreigners able to make a living in China is daily diminishing. This is but natural and hardly regrettable; but that the field to foreign enterprise on a large scale should be entirely closed against us is a sad disappointment to those who have lived here in the expectation of sooner or later seeing the country \"opened up.\" That the Chinese have a right so to hold us at a distance is, if we treat them as equals, undeniable, but our existence here at all is a violation of this right, and most foreign residents in China were of the belief that, in the interests of humanity in general, and of the Chinese in particular, this supposed right would continue to be violated. For what have we here but a country, richly endowed by nature, filled with a frugal and industrious population, yet decaying through absence of organisation and want of leadership. Every year a famine is recorded in some portion or other of the interior of the empire, but the rich crops of the more fruitful provinces are of small avail in allaying the curse. Want of means of communication and accumulated\ntaxation check the overflow of one province into the void of another, and the starving people, no other resource left them, rise in rebellion. The dry provinces of the north-west have to depend on their own precarious crops for food, and are prevented as much by the want of funds from paying for it, as by the want of roads from importing supplies from a distance. The mineral resources at their feet are untouched, and regions which, if report speaks true, are as rich in the materials of wealth as any portion of the known globe, vegetate in miserable poverty. If these things were as well known to our rulers at home as they are to us here, less pusillanimity would be shown in dealing with the position of foreigners in China; for our prestige is sufficient to enable us to gain all that we can in reason ask, and, should it fail for the moment, the first renewal of a display of force would revive it. Properly administered the resources of the country are ample; but as the government is now managed, each province, in the memorials of its governors to headquarters, vies with the others in proclaiming its insolvency.\n\nIt is beyond the province of this retrospect to enumerate the mercantile disabilities under which we labour; instanced by the taxation of our goods, over and above the five per cent. Customs tax levied on landing, even in this our own settlement; by the seizure, without previous warning, of the Carisbrooke steamer off Hainan; and by the nullification of Treaty Transit-passes at the outports, and the attempt to starve out our colony of Hongkong by a Customs' cordon surrounding it. Here in Shanghai we have one of the most important sea ports in the world being gradually closed up by what the highest official in the province was not ashamed to call the heaven-sent (see Fu-t'ai's despatch to Consul Medhurst) barrier of the Woosung bar. It is an astonishing sight to see the rapid encroachments of the Yang-tsze mud, which in fifteen years has narrowed our river by nearly one-third; and in no other country but China would a river serving such a trade as this be left to its natural devices. Mainly at the expense of the foreign community, some Dutch engineers were summoned from Japan to examine the bar; but their report has not yet been published, nor when published is there any reason to hope that action will be taken upon it. The condition of the settlement is an abnormal one; and the governing powers of the Municipality established by the foreign residents are being daily encroached upon. To ensure a continuance of the prosperity brought to the place by foreigners an extension of these powers is needed: the jurisdiction of the foreign residents needs to be extended, as in the time of the thirty mile radius, so that fresh roads could be made, the conservancy of the river taken in hand, waterworks and other appliances of civilisation established; in short power taken\nfrom those who won't govern, and given to those who will.\n\nAt the time when war with Japan was imminent the government of Fuh-kien, under whose administration the island of Formosa is placed, saw the necessity of availing themselves of the telegraphic facilities which the Great Northern Telegraph Company has provided on this coast. But Foochow, although the largest tea-port in China, exporting annually nearly 100,000,000 lbs. of tea, has no direct communication, the wire being landed at the neighbouring and more accessible port of Amoy. To set up a wire overland between the two ports, and thus put Foochow in direct communication with the rest of the world was a very simple matter, but no permission could be gained from the Chinese, and the affair was given up, until in 1874 the difficulty with Japan induced the viceroy to consent to the undertaking. The Great Northern Telegraph Company immediately set to work; but before the line was completed, by the good offices of Mr. Wade, a peace was settled, and the wire no longer needed. The Telegraph Company were forced to receive payment for the work done, and the posts were pulled down. Thus, in nothing but the direct appliances of war has the Chinese government shewn itself really progressive. In obtaining these they have spared no cost, even in the face of the financial embarrassment which is disclosed in memorials from every part of the empire. Frigates and gun-boats of the most approved designs have been constructed at the arsenals of Foochow and Shanghai, or imported from abroad. Enormous orders have been sent to the Krupp factory, and scarcely a steamer has arrived from Europe during the year without bringing out a heavy consignment of war material of some sort or another for the government. Powder-mills and cartridge manufactories on a large scale have been added to the Shanghai arsenal, and forts of the most approved modern type have been erected at the mouths of the principal rivers, notably at Woosung and Taku, and at the head of the more commanding reaches of the Yang-tsze and the Min. This ceaseless activity in the War Department has been in marked contrast with the apathy and obstructiveness shewn in all other quarters, and bodes little good for the pacific progress of foreign interests, which all who have cast in their lot with this country are so anxiously watching for.\n\nAs an instance of the energy of our residents in the cause of science we may mention, apart from the work accomplished by the members of this Society, the establishment of an Astronomical Observatory on a modest scale by Doctor L. S. Little; whose labours we confidently expect will in time produce good fruit. Opportunity has been taken of the determination of the Longitude of Nagasaki by the American \"Transit of Venus\" expedition in 1874 accurately to fix the Longitude of Shanghai.\nA first need of the American party, upon their arrival in Nagasaki, was to determine the longitude of their observatory. The cable to Vladivostock enabled them to do this by putting themselves in communication with the Siberian astronomers; and last year the cable between this and Nagasaki was placed at the disposal of Mr. A. C. Taintor and Dr. Little for a like work here.\n\nAnother addition has been made to our local scientific resources during the year in the shape of a \"Chinese Polytechnic Institution and Reading-Room.\" This institution has originated in a desire, on the part of some of our foreign residents, seconded by one or two enlightened Chinamen, to bring home to the natives generally a knowledge and appreciation of foreign arts and sciences. Mr. Fryer, who holds an appointment at the Chinese Arsenal as translator of foreign scientific works, H. M. Consul Mr. Medhurst, together with Mr. T. W. Kingsmill and the Chinese Hs\u00fc, Wang and Tong-king-sing (the latter being the official manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Co.), have been the prime movers of the scheme and now form the Committee. A modest building has been erected in the settlement in the Chinese style, and the nucleus of a Library bought, and various models collected. The cost has been defrayed partly by subscriptions from the foreign community, but mainly by contributions from high Chinese officials. The Prospectus states that the object of the institution is to bring the Sciences, Arts and Manufactures of Western Nations in the most practicable manner possible before the notice of the Chinese; the means proposed being, 1st. an Exhibition of machinery, apparatus, manufactured goods etc. 2nd. Lectures and classes for scientific instruction; and 3rd. a Chinese Library and Reading Room. It adds that it is hoped Foreign Mercantile Firms in Shanghai and other ports of China will see that it will be greatly to their advantage, not only to countenance this exhibition themselves, but also to prevail on the Firms they are connected with at home to render as much assistance as possible. In how far the very sanguine results aimed at in the original prospectus are likely to be attained it is hard to say: at present Chinese officials appear to be mainly interested in foreign science only in so far as it may aid them to keep foreigners at bay. The best means in our opinion to enlighten the Chinese people and open the country to foreign enterprise and capital is the using of diplomatic pressure to remove the official obstructions to our free intercourse. Left to themselves the Chinese officials, however much we may teach them to appreciate the advantages to be gained by the application of our mechanical arts to the natural resources of the country, will fear to apply their knowledge, until such time as they feel themselves strong enough to do\nso without foreign aid; and we therefore are somewhat dubious of the gain to ourselves in subscribing money for an institution thus placed. The permission to a foreign company to rent and open one coal-mine, and connect it by rail with the nearest port, would teach the Chinese by practical experience that which, as long as they are confined to books and models, they will never really appreciate. The peaceful and profitable nature of such undertakings would become obvious, and the absurd concession to Chinese official prejudice, which denies to a foreigner the right to rent land or occupy a house for business purposes outside the limits of the treaty ports, be broken through. We have heard Chinese officials say \"we acknowledge your superiority in mechanics, but we deny it in ethics or morals.\" Had we access to the country they would soon see that, apart from missionaries whom, wisely or not, our governments compel the Chinese to tolerate, in improving their mechanical knowledge we should be quite content to leave their superiority on this latter point undisturbed, while our welcome from the wage-receiving class would be of the warmest character.\n\nThe year 1875 has been almost barren of geographical discoveries which might come within the province of this Society. The practical withdrawal of diplomatic communication with Kashgar, and the delay in taking effective steps after the murder of Margary, have stood in the way of opening up two promising routes. The unsettled position of affairs and the want of confidence thereby engendered has prevented exploration in other quarters, so that so far as any increase in our geographical knowledge of the outlying portions of the Chinese empire is concerned, the year has remained almost a blank. To this the only exception has been the mission of enquiry sent into Yunnan. At the end of the year the mission had hardly advanced beyond Hankow; whatever its results therefore, they will be for a future chronicle.\n\nOn the side of India geographical research likewise met with a sudden check. It seems as if the fatal result of Margary's journey had paralysed the Indian government; and as if, in lieu of urging them to push on with greater vigour, and morally, if not physically, to avenge such a disgrace on their own frontiers, they had submitted to the check the Chinese had designedly imposed upon them. The expeditions of the pundits under Colonel Montgomery still continue, but scarcely with the energy which marked former years. Not one well organised expedition had set out, and the frontiers between India and Central Asia and China remain still practically closed to intercourse. Yet the pundits did good work. That hitherto enigmatic district known vaguely as the Pamir steppe is by degrees being conquered for geography. The hitherto unknown\nhighlands of Thibet have been to a certain extent explored, and one of the pundits has passed round the Tengri nor and connected those wild regions with the series of observations made at Yarkand and Kashgar. Of Chinese Turkistan our knowledge has met with no increase during the year, as the British government has deferred taking advantage of the right of travel and residence stipulated for by Sir Douglas Forsyth at Kashgar.\n\nLittle has been done during the past year towards the surveys of the coast of China. An accurate re-survey of the mouth of the Yang-tze would be invaluable both in commercial and scientific points of view. One of H. M. naval officers has been told off for the duty but has since been invalided; but without ample assistance the work he will be able to perform will be of little utility. The rate of advance of the delta of the Yang-tze is a matter of the highest scientific interest, apart from the bearing it has on the future development, not to say existence, of our trade. Taken in connection with Chinese statistics which, in a more or less trustworthy form, reach back some twenty centuries, there is here afforded a means of gauging the ancient condition of the eastern portion of the Asiatic continent. The old coast-line is clearly marked and the area of the alluvial plain can be accurately measured. A clue to the age of the River Yang-tze may thus be obtained, by measuring its present rate of growth, and comparing it with such facts as we can gather from the ancient records. The changes going on are so vast and rapid as to have altered the face of the country during the stay of many of our foreign residents, and it is much to be wished that permanent measures should be taken for marking the changes as they occur on a complete and accurate scale. No rapid currents exist in the Yellow Sea, and their action on the growth of the delta has hence been comparatively trifling, and not such as seriously to affect any calculations based upon these measures.\n\nWhile, however, Great Britain has been inactive in the west and south-west, the Russians have made another great stride in the north-west. The remaining portion of Kokand has been overrun, and the Russian dominion is now conterminous with the T'ien-shan; that great range of mountains, whose flanks have, since the beginning of history afforded the highway for nations east and west.\n\nThe Khanate of Kokand comprises the richest basin of Central Asia: it is well watered by the Naryn and it produces all the crops and fruits of temperate latitudes. Its climate is not marked with the severity which generally characterises the plateau, and it is abundantly supplied with mineral wealth in the shape of coal, petroleum, iron, lead and most of the other useful metals. Already one of the coal-fields has been opened and a coal of excellent\nquality extracted. The importance of this supply, readily accessible to the Jaxartes and the Aral can scarcely be over-estimated. Two mines have also opened in the Karatau; one near Khojend, and another not far from Tashkand. If freedom of trade were encouraged, or permitted, the future of central Asia would be assured. The question of the feasibility of again connecting the Aral and the Caspian seas by means of the old bed of the Oxus has attracted attention during the year. The surveys and observations made appear to show that as far as levels go, no difficulty would be experienced. The dessication of central Asia seems however to have been progressive, and there is not now a sufficient supply of water in the upper Oxus to carry the stream across the intervening tract. Partially, at least, this is due to the waste incurred through the present system of irrigation, which allows large bodies of water to run off uselessly into the desert.\n\nJapan has shewn us an example of activity in providing in her treaty with Corea, for a survey of the coast. It is to be hoped that this useful work will shortly be put in hand. Our present charts of the Corean coast are most defective. A farther survey of the gulf of Tonquin and the coast of Cochin-China generally is also much needed: and now that the port of Kiung-chow in Hainan has been opened, we hope soon to see the work taken up and our knowledge of those seas extended. The French marine has surveyed the approaches to the newly opened ports in Annam, and has published charts of the entrance to the Caocam from the sea to Haiphong, and of the river mouths and internal waters of the provinces of Haichong and Quangyen. The Russians, on their part have surveyed some 450 miles of the eastern coast of Siberia from Imperial Harbour to Castries bay.\n\nIn our own Journal Dr. Bretschneider gives valuable notes of the medi\u00e6val geography of central and eastern Asia; and the Archimandrite Palladius throws new light on the travels of Marco Polo in north China. The Reverend Mr. Holcombe describes in picturesque language a journey through Shansi and Shensi; which, although passing over little actually new ground adds much to our knowledge of these not easily accessible provinces.\n\nThe Chinese Review continues a series of valuable papers by Mr. W. F. Mayers on Chinese explorations in the Indian Ocean, while Mr. T. W. Kingsmill makes an attempt to explain the geographical puzzle of the Yu-king.\n\nThe Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal completed during the year the memoranda written by Dr. Bretschneider upon Chinese Medi\u00e6val Travels to the west, which has since been published in a separate form; and which will remain a valuable aid to all engaged in the study of Asiatic antiquities. Mr. G. Phillips contributes\nnotes on the position of the Zaitun of Marco Polo, in reference to which he has carried on an interesting discussion with Colonel Yule. Of a more historical character was a paper read by Mr. Clements Markham on the 26th April before the Royal Geographical Society giving a resum\u00e9 of explorations in Thibet, and more especially of the very remarkable journey of Mr. Bogle in 1774. The trade routes to Southern China were likewise the subject of a paper by Mr. J. Corryton. Major Herbert Wood, who accompanied the Russian expedition to the Oxus, has made valuable notes on his journey, which it is understood will shortly be published.\n\nIn the Berlin Geographical Society Baron von Richthoven read some interesting notes on the population of China, which, contrary to the general opinion of those calculated to judge, he rates at the enormous amount of 415 millions. The publication of the Baron's work upon China, more particularly upon the geology and mineral resources of the country is still delayed. The cost of the Baron's explorations, were, it will be remembered borne by the merchants of China in the hope that a knowledge of her undeveloped resources would lead to the throwing upon of the country to their enterprise. Alas! It now looks as though it would be left to their posterity to reap any reward of their enterprise. A Russian Traveller, Mr. Sasnofelsy left Hankow on the 11th December, 1874 on a journey overland to Siberia. He hoped to be able to pass through Kansuh and thence by way of Ulia-sutai. An account of his journey has not yet been received.\n\nUpon the whole the geographical interest of the year has been mainly retrospective; and but little really new has been added to our stock of knowledge. It is to be hoped, however, that the present state of stagnation may not long be allowed to continue; that the check given to the Yunnan expedition will lead to a strong rebound, and that the blood of poor Margary will not have been shed in vain. If the Chinese are taught to respect and aid foreign explorers as they can and should, there will be doubtless many more capable men entering the field, and much of the remaining terra incognita of China and Central Asia will be cleared up. The late edicts on the duty of protecting men from the west, drawn from the authorities at Peking will, we trust have due weight with the officials throughout the country; for it is from the official class alone that our obstacles come; the masses of the people are curious but mostly inoffensive: they take their cue from the mandarins, and if the authorities treat us with respect we shall hear no more of mob disturbances impeding the progress of a traveller.\n\nThe condition of our settlement during the past year has, so far as the general health of the foreign residents is concerned, been eminently satisfactory. Indeed if we take 1875 as a standard we\nmay class Shanghai as an eminently healthy locality. The number of foreigners, resident and non-resident, is estimated as about 3,000 and the total of deaths during the year was only 67, giving a mortality of 22.3 per mille. Too much reliance must not, however, be placed upon these figures, as many, who fall dangerously ill, are sent home; it is consequently impossible to frame statistics of any accurate scientific nature, except for the comparison of one year with another: all we can positively state is that the mortality of 1875 was considerably lower than that of any previous year.\n\nAn outbreak of cholera occurred in the year, chiefly among the non-resident (floating) population: the range of the epidemic was limited, less than twenty persons being attacked by the disease, of whom, however, more than half died. The disease was seemingly not imported by sea; it would appear to be present among the natives every year at certain seasons. It is noticeable that the past year was remarkable for heavy rainfalls and higher maximum temperatures than usual, and these phenomena may have influenced the disease. It is to be expected that the settlements should gradually become more healthy, as year by year the ground is being raised and the drainage improved. Paddy fields are giving place to cotton, and thus the unwholesome swamps of which the former consist are rapidly being driven from our immediate neighbourhood. In increasing the area of under-ground drainage, however, much care is needed to have the drains constantly flushed and properly ventilated: for this reason in a place like Shanghai surface drains are safer and can, we think, be make equally efficient.\n\nIn concluding our review of the scientific progress of the year in this part of the world, we must not omit to chronicle the very satisfactory progress of the Museum of natural history established in connection with our society, a separate report upon which is in this number.\n\nShanghai, 29th April, 1876.\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nLIST\n\nOF THE\n\nPRINCIPAL TEA DISTRICTS\n\nIN CHINA.\nLIST OF\nTHE PRINCIPAL TEA DISTRICTS IN CHINA\nAND\nNOTES ON THE NAMES APPLIED TO THE VARIOUS KINDS\nOF\nBLACK AND GREEN TEA.\n\nBLACK TEA DISTRICTS.\n\n\u6e56\u5317\u7701\n\nPROVINCE OF HOO-PEH.\n\n| Districts in the prefecture of Woo-chang |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| Han-ning                                 |\n| P'oo-ke                                   |\n| Ts'ung-yang                               |\n| Tung-shan                                 |\n| Hing-kwo                                  |\n\n| Districts in the prefecture of E-chang    |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| Chang-yang                               |\n| Ho-fung                                  |\nThe Yang-tze is divided into two branches which diverge past the city of Hing-kwei, falls into the Yang-tze at Foo-chow-fu, just below the Split Hill, and about 40 miles above Kow-kiang.\n\u6e56\u5357\u7701\n\nPROVINCE OF HOO-NAN.\n\n\u81e8\u6e58\u7e23 Lin-s\u00ebang\n\u5e73\u6c5f\u7e23 P'ing-k\u00ebang\n\u5b89\u5316\u7e23 Ngan-hwa\n\u6e58\u6f6d\u7e23 S\u00ebang-t'an\n\u700f\u967d\u7e23 Lew-yang\n\u91b4\u9675\u7e23 Le-ling\n\nDistricts in the prefecture of Y\u014d-chow.\n\n\u5cb3\u5dde\u5e9c\n\n\u9577\u6c99\u5e9c\n\nDistricts in the prefecture of Chang-sha.\n\n\u96f2\u6eaa Yun-kh'e is a small town, about 18 miles South of the city of Lin-s\u00ebang.\n\n\u8042\u5bb6\u5e02 N\u0113r-k\u0113a-she is about 27 miles from the city of Lin-s\u00ebang.\n\n\u767d\u8346\u6a4b Peh-king-kh'eaou is about 18 miles from the city of Lin-s\u00ebang.\n\nTeas from these districts pass down to the Yang-tsze at Taou-kh'ow.\n\n\u9577\u58fd\u8857 Chang-show-keae is an important town, about 2\u00bd miles East of the city of P'ing-k\u00ebang.\n\n\u9ad8\u6a4b Kaou-kh'eaou is distant 24 miles from P'ing-k\u00ebang.\n\n\u6649\u5751 Tsin-kh'\u0103ng is 9 miles West of P'ing-k\u00ebang, on the river running from Chang-show-keae past the city of P'ing-k\u00ebang to the Tung-t'ing lake.\n\n\u6f41\u53e3 Yu-kh'ow is 9 miles below Tsin-kh'\u0103ng on the same river.\n\nThe teas from these districts, after passing through the Tung-t'ing lake, enter the Yang-tsze at Y\u014d-chow.\nProvince of G\u00eang-se.\n\nK\u00eang-t\u00eah, a district in the prefecture of Nan-chang.\n\nLi\u00ean-ho, a district in the prefecture of K\u00eah-men.\n\nK\u00ean-ho, a district in the prefecture of Kow-huang.\n\nTwo miles North of the city of Nan-chang, in the prefecture of Kuang-shan.\n\nFrom these districts are brought by water to Kow-si\u00e2ng.\n\nProvince of Ngan-hwuy.\n\nK\u00ean-t\u00eah, a district in the prefecture of Che-chow.\n\nLi\u00ean-ngan (chow), an inferior prefecture in the West of the province.\nProvince of F\u016bh-K\u0113en.\n\nChing-ho\nSung-kh'e\nKeen-yang\nTs'ung-ngan\n\nShaou-woo\nKwang-tseh\n\nYew-kh'e\nSha (h\u0113en)\nYung-ngan\nShun-chang\nTs\u0113ang-lo\n\nChang-p'ing\nNing-yang\n\nNgan-kh'e\n\nDistricts in the prefecture of K\u0113en-ning.\n\nDistricts in the prefecture of Shaou-woo.\n\nDistricts in the prefecture of Yen-p'ing.\n\nDistricts in the inferior prefecture of Lung-yen (chow) \u9f8d\u5dd6\u5dde.\n\nDistrict in the prefecture of Ts'euen-chow \u6cc9\u5dde\u5e9c.\n\n\u8d64\u77f3\u8857 Ch'\u012bh-sh\u012bh-keae, a small town, 5 miles to the South of the city of Ts'ung-ngan.\n\n\u661f\u6751 Sing-ts'un, a town in the district of Ts'ung-ngan, situated on the celebrated \u4e5d\u66f2\u6eaa Kew-kh'e\u016dh-kh'e or stream of the nine windings.

The teas are conveyed from Tun-kh'e to Ningpo for shipment to Shanghae. The natural route for the tea is through the city of Hang-chow to Shanghae, but this would involve the export duty falling into the hands of the Governor-General of K\u00ebang-nan and K\u00ebang-se; the Governor-General of F\u00fch-k\u00eben and Che-k\u00ebang therefore places a prohibitive duty on Tea at Hang-chow, thus diverting the Teas to Ningpo where they pay export duty within his jurisdiction.\n\u6c5f\u897f\u7701\n\nPROVINCE OF K\u00c9ANG-SE.\n\n\u5fb7\u8208\u7e23 Teh-hing\n\u6d6e\u6881\u7e23 Fow-leang\n\nDistricts in the prefecture of Jaou-chow.\n\nTeas from these districts, and also from Woo-yuen and Ke-mun in Ngan-hwuy, pass down by water to the P'yang lake, and then on to Kew-k\u00e9ang.\n\n\u6d59\u6c5f\u7701\n\nPROVINCE OF CHE-K\u00c9ANG.\n\n\u5e73\u6c34 Ping-shuwy, a small town, about 9 miles South of the city of \u7d39\u8208\u5e9c Shaou-hing.\n\n\u83ef\u5872 Hwa-fow, a small town, about 7 miles Southwest of the district city of \u958b\u5316\u7e23 Kh'ae-hwa, in the prefecture of \u8862\u5dde\u5e9c Kh'eu-chow.\n\nTeas from these places pass through Ningpo to Shanghai for reasons already given.\nNOTES ON THE NAMES APPLIED TO TEA.\n\nBefore proceeding with these notes, it may be as well to mention that the word \"Tea\" is derived from \"T\u00e2y,\" the pronunciation in the Amoy dialect of \u8336. This character is pronounced in various ways throughout China, and it is generally represented in English by Cha. It is used not only for Tea, but for the Tea oil tree, and other members of the Camellia family.\n\nBLACK TEAS.\n\nThese are called by the Chinese \u7d05\u8336 (Hung Cha) Red Teas.\n\nCongou is derived from Kong-hoo, the Amoy pronunciation of \u5de5\u592b (Kung-foo) which means \"work or labour.\"\n\nSouchong is derived from \u5c0f\u7a2e (Seaou-chung) which means \"small sort.\"\n\nPaou-chong is derived from \u5305\u7a2e (Paou-chung), which means \"wrapped sort.\" This is also called Padre Souchong from the fact of the priests, at the Woo-e shan (Bohea hills) and other celebrated places, cultivating and preparing very choice teas, which are packed in small paper bundles, each of which is supposed to be the produce of one shrub only.\n\nFlowery Pekoe.\u2014This is called in Chinese \u767d\u6beb (Pehi-haou), which means \"white down,\" because it is picked before the leaf-bud has expanded, at which time the convoluted part is covered with a down-like substance.\n\nOolong is a corruption of \u9ce5\u9f8d (Woo-lung), which means literally Black Dragon. The origin of this term\nbeing applied to a description of Tea is stated to be as follows:\u2014A Tea-planter named Soo \u8607 noticed that one of his plants bore leaves of remarkable fragrance, and, after carefully watching the plant day by day so as to ascertain the cause, discovered a Black Serpent coiled round the stem of the bush, which remained there for a considerable period. The tree then became known as the 'Black Dragon,' and it was in great repute for grafting. The seeds of this tree did not produce such good plants as those propagated by grafts. This is said to have occurred at Seao-hoo on the river between the city of Keen-ning and Shwuy-keth.\n\n*Caper* is called in Chinese \u96d9\u88fd (Shwang-che), which means \"doubly manipulated,\" much labour being bestowed on its preparation with the feet as well as hands. The term Caper was probably given, owing to its resemblance to the flower buds of the Caper bush.\n\n*Scented Caper* is called in Chinese \u73e0\u862d (Choo-lan), on account of its being scented with the flowers of the \u8cc8\u73e0\u862d Chin-choo-lan or \u9b5a\u5b50\u862d Yu-tsze-lan (Aglaia odorata).\n\n*Scented Orange Pekoe* is called in Chinese \u82b1\u9999 (Hwa-heang), which means literally \"aroma of flowers.\" The blossom of the \u6842\u82b1 Kwei-hwa is most commonly used for scenting this description of tea.\n\n*Bohea* is derived from Bo\u00f3-\u00ea, the Amoy pronunciation of \u6b66\u5937 (Woo-e), the name of the celebrated hills in the province of Fuh-keen. It is somewhat surprising that this name should be given to the very commonest description of Black Tea, while the hills themselves have been always famous for producing the very finest kinds.\nGREEN TEAS.\n\nThese are called by the Chinese \u7da0\u8336 (L\u00fch-cha) Green Teas, and \u6851\u9732\u8336 (Sung-lo-cha), Sung-lo being the name of a hill where Green Tea is supposed to have been first discovered.\n\nGunpowder is called \u5c0f\u73e0 (Seaou-choo) \"small pearls,\" and various expressions are used to designate the different qualities, thus:\n\n\u85e4\u73e0 (Ma-choo) Hemp (seed) pearls.\n\u5bf6\u73e0 (Paou-choo) Precious pearls.\n\u829d\u73e0 (Che-choo) Sesamun (seed) pearls.\n\nThe very best Gunpowders from the P'ing-shwuy district are called \u8766\u76ee (Hea-m\u00fchl) Crabs-eyes.\n\nImperial is called \u5927\u73e0 (Ta-choo) \"large pearls,\" and the different qualities are designated, thus:\n\n\u73cd\u73e0 (Chin-choo) Oyster pearls.\n\u5713\u73e0 (Yuen-choo) Round pearls.\n\u9ed1\u73e0 (He-choo) Pearly hyson kind.\n\nYoung Hyson is so called, because it is similar to but smaller than Hyson. The Chinese call it \u96e8\u524d (Yu-tseen), literally \"before Yu,\" which implies that it is picked before \u6851\u96e8 K\u00fch-yu, a term which falls on or about 20th April every year. The different qualities are distinguished, thus:\n\n\u5a25\u7709 (Ngo-mei) Imperial concubine's eyebrows.\n\u7709\u96e8 (Mei-yu) Eyebrows picked before K\u00fch-yu.\n\u82bd\u96e8 (Ya-yu) Buds do.\n\u7199\u96e8 (He-yu) Hyson kind do.\n\nOther expressions are also used, such as:\n\n\u9cf3\u7709 (Fung-mei) Phoenix eyebrows.\n\u79c0\u7709 (Sew-mei) Elegant eyebrows.\nHyson.\u2014This word is a corruption of \u7199\u6625 (He-hun), which means literally \"vigorous or flourishing spring,\" but the characters do not bear translating in this case.\n\nBall in his work on the cultivation and manufacture of tea, states that the characters \"He-chun\" formed the hong name of a Tea merchant named Le, who was engaged in the Tea-trade in the district of Hew-ning, during the reign of Kh\u2019ang-he (A.D. 1662-1722).\n\nAnother explanation is that He-chun was the name of the daughter of the Tea merchant Le, and that this particular kind of tea was called after her, because she was the first person to separate the leaves, so as to make what is called Hyson.\n\nMembers of this same family are still engaged in the Green Tea trade, and the celebrated chop \u674e\u4ea6\u99a8 (Le-yih-hing) continues to be made by them.\n\nThe different qualities of Hyson are described as follows:\n\n\u7709\u7199 (Mei-he) Eyebrows Hyson.\n\u6b63\u7199 (Ching-he) Best Hyson.\n\u526f\u7199 (Foo-he) Second (best) Hyson.\n\nTwankay.\u2014This term is derived from \u5c6f\u6eaa Tun-kh\u2019e, the well known mart about 15 miles to the Southwest of the city of Hwuy-chow.\n\nThis description of tea is, however, generally called by the Chinese \u6851\u843d (Sung-lo), from the celebrated Sung-lo shan before alluded to; and here we have another instance of the commonest descriptions of tea being named from places most celebrated for producing and manufacturing the very best kinds.\n\nSung-lo shan is a small hill about 4 miles to the\nNorth of the city of Hew-ning. It is also called \u91d1\u4f5b\u5c71 (Kin-fuh shan) \"Golden Buddha hill,\" and is stated to be 160 jin in height, or say about 1,500 English feet. This hill was visited by Fortune in 1848, when he found that tea was no longer cultivated upon it.\n\nIn describing the different qualities, the following characters are used as prefixes:\n\n- \u516c\u53f8 Kung-sze.\n- \u912d\u5c71 Chang-shan.\n- \u9ec3\u5c71 Hwang-shan.\n- \u5929\u90fd T'ien-too.\n- \u767d\u5dbd Peh-yo.\n- \u83ef\u5c71 Hwa-shan.\n- \u773c\u751f Yen-sang.\n- \u4e0a\u54c1 Shang-pin.\n- \u64c7\u9078 Keen-seuen.\n\nKung-sze, which means literally \"public company,\" stands for the old East India Company.\n\nChang-shan is the name of a famous hill in the Northern part of the Woo-yuen district.\n\nHwang-shan, meaning Imperial or Yellow Mountains is a celebrated group of spiculated hills in the prefecture of Hwuy-chow, famous for producing the best Tea.\n\nT'ien-too is the name of one of the highest and most noted peaks in this group; the Chinese call it 900 jin in height, or about 8,500 English feet.\n\nPeh-yo stands for Peh-yo shan, also called \u9752\u96f2\u5dd6 Tse-yun-yen. This is another celebrated group of peaks about 9 miles to the West of the city of Hew-ning.\n\nHwa-shan is a contraction of \u4e5d\u83ef\u5c71 Kew-hwa-shan, a cluster of peaks in the district of \u9752\u967d\u7e23 Ts'ing-yang, and about 20 miles from the town of Ta-tung on the Yang-tsze.\nYen-s\u0103ng is ambiguous, but means generally \"very fine.\"\n\nShang-pin means \"best,\" and K\u00eben-seuen, \"selected.\"\n\nIt is now very generally recognised that either Black or Green Tea can be made from the same plant. No doubt some districts produce Tea more suitable for being made into Black than Green, but it is well known that at one time the leaf in the Woo-ning district was made into Green Tea, while it is now made into Black; and in Keen-teh the leaf is made into Black or Green, or Black and Green, according to the demand at the time.\n\nThe essential difference between Black Tea and Green Tea is, that the former is sun-dried soon after being picked and before it is first roasted, while the latter is roasted immediately after being picked, and is not exposed to the sun at all.\n\nThe baskets used by the pickers in the Green Tea districts are very similar to fishing baskets, having small mouths and long necks, while the baskets used in the Black Tea districts are open. It is even said that, in picking the leaves to be made into the choicest Green Tea, the pickers stand with their backs to the sun, so as to prevent the sun's rays acting upon the leaf after being picked from the tree.\n\nMorrison's orthography is used throughout this paper, as being the most suitable for proper names.\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nOBSERVATOIRE\n\nM\u00c9T\u00c9OROLOGIQUE ET MAGN\u00c9TIQUE,\n\nDES P\u00c8RES DE LA COMPAGNIE DE JESUS,\n\n\u00c0 ZI-KA-WEI.\nA.

Cette d\u00e9termination en valeur absolue de la composante horizontale a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au moins deux fois par mois ; depuis le 1 Janvier 1875, quatre observations compl\u00e8tes donnent la moyenne mensuelle.\n\nJe ne donnerai qu'une valeur approch\u00e9e de l'Inclinaison magn\u00e9tique, bien que j'aie fait chaque mois quatre observations de cet important \u00e9l\u00e9ment du magn\u00e9tisme terrestre ; mais parmi ces observations, les unes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur des pieds mobiles en diff\u00e9rents endroits, d'autres sur un pilier en bois, d'autres enfin sur un pilier de briques ; or, j'ai tout derni\u00e8rement reconnu que ces briques, provenant du Tch\u00e9 Kiang, sont notablement magn\u00e9tiques (celles qui viennent de Tien-tsin ou du Tch\u00e9-ly le sont au m\u00eame degr\u00e9) et que la correction \u00e0 apporter \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res observations est assez forte ; mais comme il me serait presque impossible de les reconna\u00eetre au milieu des autres, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, pour ne point donner de valeurs erron\u00e9es, rejeter toute cette s\u00e9rie et ne pr\u00e9senter que les valeurs dont je puis r\u00e9pondre.\n\nJ'observe toujours directement l'Inclinaison dans deux Azimuts rectangulaires en dehors du M\u00e9ridien magn\u00e9tique et je calcule l'Inclinaison vraie par la formule \"Cotg.\u00b2 I = cotg.\u00b2 i' + cotg.\u00b2 i\".\"\n\nLa D\u00e9clinaison magn\u00e9tique est le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment que la nature de mes appareils m'ait permis d'\u00e9tudier avec suite. Je me suis servi du Magn\u00e9tom\u00e8tre unifilaire de d\u00e9clinaison comme d'une boussole des variations ; quatre fois par mois pendant l'ann\u00e9e 1874, et 8 fois depuis le commencement de l'ann\u00e9e 1875, j'ai relev\u00e9 de demi-heure en demi-heure, depuis 6h. du matin jusqu'\u00e0 6h. du soir, la position de l'axe magn\u00e9tique\nde l'aimant par rapport au r\u00e9ticule de la lunette fixe. Pendant la nuit le mouvement de l'aiguille, chaque fois que j'ai fait des observations de 24 heures, a \u00e9t\u00e9 excessivement faible et difficile \u00e0 saisir avec le d\u00e9clinom\u00e8tre ; n\u00e9anmoins je donnerai ce que j'ai pu obtenir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. J'ai r\u00e9duit toutes ces observations horaires de la d\u00e9clinaison au Temps vrai de Zi-ka-wei.\n\nLa D\u00e9clinaison et l'Intensit\u00e9 horizontale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9es de l'erreur que le voisinage des briques magn\u00e9tiques, dont j'ai parl\u00e9 plus haut, avait introduite dans les valeurs absolues de ces deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments : des observations sp\u00e9ciales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans ce but en 4 endroits diff\u00e9rents(*) assez distants de l'Observatoire qui est tout entier construit avec ces m\u00eames briques. La correction pour la d\u00e9clinaison a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u20142\u00b0 30\" .\n\nLe terrain de toute la contr\u00e9e est enti\u00e8rement s\u00e9dimentaire : soumise \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de la boussole, la terre du pays n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun caract\u00e8re magn\u00e9tique sensible.\n\nL'observatoire de Zi-ka-wei est \u00e0 6 kilom. environ au SO de Chang-Hai et \u00e0 30 kilom. de la mer de Chine.\n\nM. DECHEVRENS, S.J.\n\n(1) Le pilier qui m'a servi pendant toute cette ann\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la D\u00e9clinaison en valeur absolue est \u00e0 10 m\u00e8tres de l'Observatoire. Deux autres piliers en bois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis l'un \u00e0 70 m\u00e8tres environ, l'autre \u00e0 100 m\u00e8tres au moins de tout b\u00e2timent en briques ; enfin une observation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sur pied mobile \u00e0 plus de 500 m\u00e8tres en rase campagne. Cette derni\u00e8re observation, aussi bien que celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 diverses reprises sur les deux nouveaux piliers m'ont montr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire la correction indiqu\u00e9e ici. Pour toutes ces observations de comparaison, le M\u00e9ridien astronomique a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par l'observation r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e de la Polaire \u00e0 son \u00e9longation maxima et par le Passage de quelques \u00e9toiles au M\u00e9ridien.\nI.\u2014D\u00c9CLINAISON MAGN\u00c9TIQUE.\n\n\u00a7 1.\u2014Tableaux des Observations Horaires de la D\u00e9clinaison,\nAvril 1874\u2014Avril 1875.\n\nLes grandes perturbations magn\u00e9tiques, je le sais, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rares cette ann\u00e9e et elles ont pu se manifester en des jours o\u00f9 je n'ai pas fait d'observations horaires ; cependant, on peut justement encore s'\u00e9tonner de l'extr\u00eame r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des mouvements de l'aiguille de d\u00e9clinaison \u00e0 Zi-ka-wei, r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 attest\u00e9e non-seulement par la courbe diurne moyenne, mais encore et aussi bien par chacune des courbes particuli\u00e8res obtenues durant le printemps, l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et l'automne. J'excepte les observations d'hiver qui indiquent toutes une oscillation diurne remarquablement faible et une certaine h\u00e9sitation dans la marche de l'aiguille.\n\nJe ne puis mieux commencer cet article qu'en donnant les deux belles courbes diurnes, obtenues l'une le 23 Mars 1874, l'autre le 22 Mars 1875, jours o\u00f9 s'est rencontr\u00e9 l'\u00e9quinoxe de printemps (Tableau, I.). Ouvrant et fermant cette premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d'observations magn\u00e9tiques \u00e0 Zi-ka-wei, elles sont un remarquable exemple de la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des mouvements diurnes de l'aiguille de d\u00e9clinaison, en m\u00eame temps qu'elles manifestent une diff\u00e9rence notable entre l'amplitude de l'oscillation pendant le jour et celle de l'oscillation pendant la nuit. Enfin on pourra juger d'un coup d'\u0153il le changement de d\u00e9clinaison survenu entre les deux \u00e9poques, changement confirm\u00e9 par les observations ult\u00e9rieures.\n\nLa D\u00e9clinaison magn\u00e9tique \u00e0 Zi-ka-wei est Occidentale et elle va en augmentant. Le 23 Mars 1874 l'observation a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 6h. du matin, et non \u00e0 minuit comme le 22 Mars 1875 : j'ai donc \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de rapporter au commencement de la courbe, en le corrigean de la variation d'un jour \u00e0 l'autre, ce qui appartient r\u00e9ellement au 24 Mars 1874.\n\nAyant commenc\u00e9, sans parti pris, cette s\u00e9rie d'observations horaires le jour m\u00eame de l'\u00e9quinoxe de Printemps, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 naturellement amen\u00e9 \u00e0 les diviser en 4 parties, correspondant aux quatre saisons de l'ann\u00e9e. Chaque partie contient donc 3 mois d'observations et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement chacun d'eux comprend 4 observations r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement distribu\u00e9es.\n\nUn tableau sp\u00e9cial, annex\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque saison, donne le minimum et le maximum semi-diurnes des jours d'observation, la moyenne de ces deux valeurs, enfin l'amplitude de l'oscillation semi-diurne, ou diff\u00e9rence entre les maximums et minimum principaux de chaque jour.\n\nComme je n'ai observ\u00e9 que pendant le jour, et que je ne parlerai jamais que des maximum et minimum principaux, j'appellerai d\u00e9sormais Oscillation diurne et non semi-diurne, le mouvement de l'aiguille effectu\u00e9 d'Orient en Occident entre 9h. du matin et 2h. de l'ap\u00e8s-midi.

Dans l'un et l'autre cas, absence absolue de toute irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, si ce n'est une l\u00e9g\u00e8re h\u00e9sitation vers 10h. du matin dans la courbe du 20 F\u00e9vrier. Les trois mouvements de l'aiguille le 1 Juin, se sont, le 20 F\u00e9vrier, augment\u00e9s de deux autres, de telle sorte qu'outre les deux inflexions principales de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, la courbe diurne en hiver poss\u00e8de en plus un maximum \u00e0 7h. du matin et un minimum secondaire vers 4h du soir.\n\nOn voit enfin, par la comparaison de ces deux courbes extr\u00eames, que la variation annuelle de l'amplitude de l'oscillation diurne de la d\u00e9clinaison magn\u00e9tique \u00e0 Zi-ka-wei est assez faible puisqu'elle n'a pas d\u00e9pass\u00e9 9\u00b0 92.

D\u00c9CLINAISON MAGN\u00c9TIQUE DANS SES RAPPORTS AVEC LA D\u00c9CLINAISON DU SOLEIL.\n\nLa position de l'aiguille aimant\u00e9e \u00e0 un instant quelconque d\u00e9pend de la situation du soleil relativement au M\u00e9ridien du lieu d'observation et \u00e0 l'Equateur terrestre. La premi\u00e8re de ces deux influences est la plus importante et elle est facilement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en calculant la variation horaire moyenne de l'ann\u00e9e au moyen de toutes les observations faites dans tous les mois. On \u00e9limine ainsi ce qu'il y a de variable dans chacune de ces observations pour ne plus laisser subsister que ce qu'elles renferment de constant, le mouvement diurne de l'aiguille aimant\u00e9e sous l'influence de la rotation diurne apparente du soleil autour de la Terre. Le Tableau II montre ce mouvement pour l'ann\u00e9e 1874-75 \u00e0 l'Observatoire de Zi-ka-wei.\n\nLa seconde influence, que le soleil a sur les mouvements de l'aiguille, tient \u00e0 son changement de d\u00e9clinaison durant le cours de l'ann\u00e9e. Pendant les six mois que le soleil est dans l'h\u00e9misph\u00e8re nord, l'amplitude de l'oscillation diurne est notablement sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle que l'on observe pendant les six autres mois de l'ann\u00e9e : on est donc naturellement amen\u00e9 \u00e0 rechercher la nature de cette influence de la d\u00e9clinaison du soleil.\n\nJe ne veux point ici d\u00e9terminer la perturbation apport\u00e9e, chaque mois, dans le mouvement moyen de l'aiguille, par la variation de la d\u00e9clinaison du soleil ; je me contenterai de l'indiquer pour les quatre saisons de l'ann\u00e9e.\n\nAu moyen des observations horaires faites dans chaque mois, je calcule les moyennes horaires de chaque trimestre ; j'ai ainsi pour chaque heure quatre valeurs de la d\u00e9clinaison dont la moyenne est \u00e9videmment la position qu'occuperait \u00e0 cette heure-l\u00e0, par rapport au M\u00e9ridien du lieu d'observation, l'aiguille aimant\u00e9e si la d\u00e9clinaison du soleil \u00e9tait constante. Cela fait, on n'a plus qu'\u00e0 retrancher chacune de ces valeurs moyennes de chaque valeur correspondante de la d\u00e9clinaison dans les quatre saisons : le reste est \u00e9videmment l'effet du changement de position du soleil par rapport \u00e0 l'Equateur ou de sa variation en d\u00e9clinaison.\nLes tableaux suivants donnent ces diff\u00e9rentes valeurs ainsi que les courbes qui repr\u00e9sentent ces effets. Les Tableaux V et VI en particulier montrent en valeur absolue et relative la variation diurne de la d\u00e9clinaison en \u00e9t\u00e9 et en hiver, c.a.d. quand le soleil \u00e9tait au-dessus ou au-dessous de l'\u00c9quateur. La Moyenne de ces deux courbes est la reproduction de celle du Tableau II et n'est autre que la courbe de la variation diurne de la d\u00e9clinaison magn\u00e9tique sous la seule influence de la rotation diurne apparente du soleil. Le Tableau VII au contraire montre les perturbations apport\u00e9es dans la variation diurne de la d\u00e9clinaison par ce changement de position du soleil sur l'Ecliptique.\n\n**VARIATION DIURNE CORRESPONDANT AUX QUATRE SAISONS DE L'ANN\u00c9E.**\n\n| Temps vrai | Printemps | \u00c9t\u00e9 | Automne | Hiver | Moyennes annuelles |\n|------------|-----------|-----|---------|-------|--------------------|\n| 6h. matin  | -1\u00b0 21\"   | -1\u00b0 52\" | +0\u00b0 12\" | +0\u00b0 34\" | -0\u00b0 86\",7          |\n| 7h.        | -2\u00b0 33    | -3\u00b0 9  | +0\u00b0 4   | +0\u00b0 17  | -1\u00b0 20,2           |\n| 8h.        | -3\u00b0 41    | -3\u00b0 53 | -0\u00b0 42  | -0\u00b0 46  | -2\u00b0 18             |\n| 9h.        | -3\u00b0 24    | -3\u00b0 18 | -1\u00b0 22  | -1\u00b0 30  | -2\u00b0 23,5           |\n| 10h.       | -2\u00b0 21    | -1\u00b0 21 | -0\u00b0 35  | -1\u00b0 18  | -1\u00b0 28,7           |\n| 11h.       | 0         | +0\u00b0 48 | -0\u00b0 16  | -0\u00b0 22  | +0\u00b0 2,5            |\n| Midi       | +1\u00b0 54    | +2\u00b0 28 | +0\u00b0 59  | +0\u00b0 50  | +1\u00b0 32,8           |\n| 1h. soir   | +3\u00b0 4     | +3\u00b0 35 | +1\u00b0 21  | +1\u00b0 26  | +2\u00b0 21,5           |\n| 2h.        | +3\u00b0 32    | +3\u00b0 23 | +1\u00b0 16  | +1\u00b0 16  | +2\u00b0 21,7           |\n| 3h.        | +2\u00b0 41    | +2\u00b0 15 | +0\u00b0 28  | +0\u00b0 33  | +1\u00b0 29,2           |\n| 4h.        | +1\u00b0 24    | +0\u00b0 58 | -0\u00b0 13  | -0\u00b0 7   | +0\u00b0 30,5           |\n| 5h.        | +0\u00b0 44    | +0\u00b0 9  | -0\u00b0 83  | -0\u00b0 27  | -0\u00b0 1,8            |\n| 6h.        | +0\u00b0 4     | +0\u00b0 1  | -0\u00b0 88  | -0\u00b0 9   | -0\u00b0 10,5           |\n\nAmplitude: 7\u00b0 18\" 7\u00b0 35\" 2\u00b0 47\" 3\u00b0 4\" 5\u00b0 2\"\n\n**PERTURBATIONS DUES AU CHANGEMENT DE LA D\u00c9CLINAISON DU SOLEIL.**\n\n| Temps vrai | Printemps | \u00c9t\u00e9 | Automne | Hiver |\n|------------|-----------|-----|---------|-------|\n| 6h. matin  | -0\u00b0 44\",3 | -1\u00b0 15\",3 | +0\u00b0 48\",7 | +1\u00b0 10\",7 |\n| 7h.        | -1\u00b0 12,8  | -1\u00b0 48,8 | +1\u00b0 24,2 | +1\u00b0 37,2 |\n| 8h.        | -1\u00b0 23    | -1\u00b0 85  | +1\u00b0 36  | +1\u00b0 32  |\n| 9h.        | -1\u00b0 0,5   | -0\u00b0 54,5 | +1\u00b0 1,5  | +0\u00b0 53,5 |\n| 10h.       | -0\u00b0 57,8  | +0\u00b0 2,7  | +0\u00b0 48,7 | +0\u00b0 5,7  |\n| 11h.       | -0\u00b0 2,5   | +0\u00b0 45,5 | -0\u00b0 18,5 | -0\u00b0 24,5 |\n| Midi       | +0\u00b0 21,2  | +0\u00b0 55,2 | -0\u00b0 33,8 | -0\u00b0 42,8 |\n| 1h. soir   | +0\u00b0 42,5  | +1\u00b0 13,5 | -1\u00b0 0,5  | -0\u00b0 55,5 |\n| 2h.        | +1\u00b0 10,8  | +1\u00b0 1,8  | -1\u00b0 5,7  | -1\u00b0 5,7  |\n| 3h.        | +1\u00b0 11,8  | +0\u00b0 45,8 | -1\u00b0 1,2  | -0\u00b0 56,2 |\n| 4h.        | +0\u00b0 58,5  | +0\u00b0 27,5 | -0\u00b0 43,5 | -0\u00b0 37,5 |\n| 5h.        | +0\u00b0 45,8  | +0\u00b0 10,8 | -0\u00b0 81,2 | -0\u00b0 25,2 |\n| 6h.        | +0\u00b0 14,5  | +0\u00b0 11,5 | -0\u00b0 27,5 | +0\u00b0 1,5  |\n\n**Nota.** \u2014 Le signe + indique que l'aiguille est \u00e0 l'Occident de sa position moyenne et le signe \u2014 qu'elle est \u00e0 l'Orient.\n\n(Tableaux graphiques V, VI et VII).\nTel serait dans les quatre saisons de l'ann\u00e9e l'effet du d\u00e9placement du Soleil sur l'Ecliptique. On peut remarquer que ces quatre courbes (Tableau VII) sont d'une forme pareille \u00e0 celle de la courbe diurne annuelle, due \u00e0 la rotation diurne apparente du Soleil ; qu'elles sont oppos\u00e9es pour les \u00e9poques de d\u00e9clinaison oppos\u00e9e ; qu'elles sont un peu moins prononc\u00e9es pour les deux saisons \u00e9quinoxiales. La plus grande excursion a lieu en \u00c9t\u00e9 et la plus faible au Printemps ; lorsque le Soleil est au-dessus de l'\u00c9quateur, son action perturbatrice est en tous points inverse de celle qu'il poss\u00e8de dans l'h\u00e9misph\u00e8re austral, et de plus elle est de m\u00eame sens que l'action constante due \u00e0 sa rotation : de l\u00e0 les grandes amplitudes en \u00c9t\u00e9 et les faibles en Hiver.\n\n\u00a7 7.\u2014VARIATION DIURNE DE LA VITESSE DE L'AIGUILLE DE D\u00c9CLINAISON.\n\nOn d\u00e9termine cette variation en calculant les diff\u00e9rences successives que pr\u00e9sentent entre elles les valeurs des d\u00e9clinaisons horaires moyennes pour l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et pour l'hiver.

Nord 31\u00b0 12' 30\"\n\nLes instruments employ\u00e9s pour ces observations sont d\u00e9crits dans les \"Instructions for magnetic surveys by land and sea\" du Major-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Sabine ; les m\u00e9thodes d'observation sont aussi celles qu'on y trouve recommand\u00e9es ; toutefois j'ai cru devoir adopter, pour la recherche de l'Inclinaison, l'observation directe dans deux azimuts rectangulaires : le calcul donne ensuite l'Inclinaison vraie par la formule\n\n\\[ \\cotg. I = \\cotg. i' + \\cotg. i'' \\]\n\nLe bulletin de 1874 renferme d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelques observations de la d\u00e9clinaison pour les trois premiers mois de 1875 ; j'ai cru utile de les reporter dans le bulletin de 1875, afin que cette ann\u00e9e soit compl\u00e8te ; en outre, pour ne point sortir du cadre que je m'\u00e9tais fix\u00e9 dans la discussion des observations de 1874, j'avais d\u00fb laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 environ des observations horaires faites pendant ces trois mois et je m'\u00e9tais aussi contents de les donner d'heure en heure. Mais comme ces mois sont plus irr\u00e9guliers sous le rapport de la marche diurne de l'aimant, je crois bon de les publier ici, comme je les ai faites, c'est-\u00e0-dire de \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) heure en \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) heure, depuis 6h. A.M. jusqu'\u00e0 6h. P.M.\n\nCes observations semi-horaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 continues jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de Juin ; \u00e0 partir du mois de Juillet de nouvelles occupations m'ont forc\u00e9 \u00e0 les interrompre et \u00e0 me contenter d'une dizaine d'observations isol\u00e9es par mois : je me suis astreint cependant \u00e0 les faire toujours \u00e0 11h. du matin (temps moyen) ; c'est, en effet, d'apr\u00e8s mes observations de 1874, le moment o\u00f9 l'aimant atteint sensiblement sa position moyenne de la journ\u00e9e. Enfin, depuis le 15 Octobre, j'ai pu relever la position de l'aimant trois fois par jour : \u00e0 7h. et \u00e0 11h. du matin et \u00e0 4h. du soir, la moyenne des observations de 7h. A.M. et de 4h. P.M. ne s'\u00e9carte que tr\u00e8s-peu de la moyenne diurne.\n\nPour les 6 premiers mois de l'ann\u00e9e, les observations de la d\u00e9clinaison sont rapport\u00e9es au Temps vrai, tandis que pour les 6 derniers, elles le sont au Temps moyen de Zi-ka-wei.\n\nLa D\u00e9clinaison magn\u00e9tique \u00e0 Zi-ka-wei est Occidentale.\n\nLa Planche, jointe \u00e0 ce bulletin, pr\u00e9sente en valeurs absolues la variation diurne moyenne de la d\u00e9clinaison magn\u00e9tique pendant les six premiers mois de l'ann\u00e9e 1875, et le d\u00e9placement de l'aimant d'un mois \u00e0 l'autre. Ces courbes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es avec les valeurs horaires moyennes de chaque mois.\n\nM.
